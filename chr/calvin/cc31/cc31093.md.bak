<span id="ix.lxxxv-p9"></span> 

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p10"></span><span id="ix.lxxxv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p11"></span>The injunctions which Matthew has
hitherto related had no farther reference than to that former expedition
or commission, which was to be terminated in a few days. But now Christ
proceeds farther, and prepares them for a future period, by informing
them, that they were not merely chosen for that brief exercise of
preaching, but that an office of greater difficulty and of far higher
importance awaited them. Though they were not immediately brought into
those contests of which Christ speaks, yet it was advantageous for them
to have previous warning, that any uneasiness which they might then
suffer might be known to be a sort of preparative for a fiercer warfare
to which they had been destined. It was no doubt true in reference to
the first mission, that the apostles were *like sheep in the midst of
wolves:* but as the Lord spared their weakness, and restrained the
cruelty of *the wolves* from doing them any injury, these words properly
relate to a subsequent period, when the Lord treated them more harshly.
Before his resurrection, while *the bridegroom* was present, they were
treated, so to speak, like guests at a marriage: but after the departure
of *the bridegroom,* that softness and gentleness ceased, and they were
reduced to such hardships as made them aware, that there were good
reasons why they had been early furnished with those arms.

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p12"></span>Perhaps, too, Matthew may have collected
into one passage discourses which were delivered at different times: for
Luke, as we shall afterwards see, (<span id="ix.lxxxv-p12.1"></span>[Lu
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#017.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxv-p12.1"></span>) relates that the same things were said to
the *seventy* disciples, who were placed in the room of the apostles.
One thing is beyond dispute: These words did not merely foretell the
consequences of that journey which they were now commencing, but gave
them warning as to the whole course of their apostleship.

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p13"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxv-p13.1"></span>[Matthew
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxv-p13.1"></span>.** *Behold, I send you out* The exhortation
which immediately follows plainly shows the design of this admonition;
and therefore the order of the passage must be explained in this manner:
“You have need of *wisdom* and of *harmlessness,* because you will be
*like sheep in the midst of wolves* *”* The reason is drawn from the
necessity of the case: for if they did not *wisely* exercise caution,
they might be immediately devoured by the *wolves;* and, on the other
hand, if they trembled at the rage of the *wolves,* or were incautious,
they would presently waver, and would at length fail to perform their
duty.

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p14"></span>We shall first inquire what is meant by
their being sent out *as sheep in the midst of wolves* Though men are
cruel and bloody, the Lord might soften their ferocious temper; for he
tames and subdues, whenever he pleases, the beasts of prey. When God
does not subdue a considerable portion of mankind to the obedience of
the gospels but leaves them in their own savage nature, he does it on
purpose to try his ministers. Though all whom God does not regenerate
with the spirit of gentleness are by nature *wolves* yet this
designation is applied by Christ chiefly to the enraged enemies of the
gospel, who are so far from being softened by hearing the voice of the
pastor that they are inflamed to greater cruelty. The Lord sends the
ministers of his word on the condition of dwelling *in the midst of
wolves;* that is, of having many determined enemies and of being beset
on every hand by many dangers, which render it no easy matter to
discharge their duty in the midst of hindrances. To make the trial more
severe, he does not supply them with defensive armor, but exposes them
naked and defenseless to the teeth of the *wolves*

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p15"></span>By calling them *sheeps* he does not
refer to the sweetness and mildness of their manners, or to the
gentleness of their mind, but only means that they will have no greater
strength or fitness for repelling the violence of enemies than *sheep*
have against the rage of *wolves* Christ requires no doubt, from his
disciples that they shall resemble *sheep* in their dispositions, by
their patience in contending against the malice of wicked men, and by
the meekness with which they endure injuries, but the simple meaning of
this passage is, that many powerful and cruel enemies are arrayed
against the apostles, while they, on their part, are furnished with no
means of defense,  <span id="fr_581"></span>[582](#fn_581.md) If it be
objected, that in this way there is no contrast between *sheep* and
*wolves,* the reply is easy. Though the Lords by calling the enemies of
the gospel *wolves,* expressed their power rather than their desire to
do injury, yet as no man is known to be a *wolf* but by his rage against
the gospel, Christ has joined these two things together, the fierce
cruelty which impels them to shed blood, and the power with which they
are armed.

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p17"></span>*Be therefore wise* The general meaning
is, that their *wisdom* in exercising caution must be so regulated, as
to prevent them from being more timid than is necessary, or from
becoming more sluggish in duty. We see that those who wish to pass for
cautious and circumspect persons are, for the most part, timorous and
lazy. It is no doubt proper for the disciples of Christ, surrounded as
they are by dangers on every hand, to maintain the strictest caution;
but as they are in extreme danger of being kept back by slothfulness, he
bids them move forward honestly wherever their calling leads them.

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p18"></span>This is pointed out by a twofold
comparison, *wise as serpents, and harmless as doves*. Serpents*,* being
aware that they are hated, carefully avoid and shrink from every thing
that is hostile to them. In this manner he enjoins believers to take
care of their life, so as not to rush heedlessly into danger, or lay
themselves open to any kind of injury. *Doves,* on the other hand,
though naturally timid, and liable to innumerable attacks, fly in their
simplicity, imagine themselves safe till they are struck, and in most
cases place themselves within the reach of the fowler’s snares. To such
simplicity Christ exhorts his disciples, that no excess of terror may
hinder them from pursuing their course. There are some who carry their
ingenious reasonings still farther as to the nature of the *serpent* and
of the *dove,* but this is the utmost extent of the resemblance. We see
that Christ condemns that carnal wisdom, or rather that trickery, in
which the greater part of men are too fond of indulging, while they look
around them on every hand to discover how far it will be safe for them
to proceed; and thus, from an unwillingness to encounter danger, they
renounce the call of Christ.  <span id="fr_582"></span>[583](#fn_582.md)

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p20"></span><span id="ix.lxxxv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p21"></span>**17.** *But beware of men* Erasmus has
inserted the word *these, (beware of these men,)* supposing that the
article has the force of a demonstrative pronoun.  <span
id="fr_583"></span>[584](#fn_583.md) But in my opinion it is better to view
it as indefinite, and as conveying a declaration of Christ, that caution
ought to be exercised in dealing with men, among whom every thing is
full of snares and injuries. But he appears to contradict himself: for
the best way of exercising caution would have been to remain at home,
and not to venture to appear in public. I reply, he points out here a
different sort of caution, — not that terror and alarm which would keep
them from discharging their duty, but a dread of being excessively
annoyed by sudden calamities. We know that those who are surprised by
unexpected afflictions are apt to fall down lifeless. Christ, therefore,
desired that his disciples should foresee at a distance what would
happen, that their minds might be early prepared for maintaining a
conflict. In short, he sounds the trumpet to them, that they may quickly
make ready for the battle: for as foresight, when it is excessive or
attended by unnecessary anxiety, reduces many to a state of weakness, so
many are intoxicated by an indolent security, and, rushing on
heedlessly, give way at the critical moment.

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p23"></span>*For they will deliver you up to
councils* It may readily be inferred from these words, that the contests
of which Christ forewarns the apostles must not be limited to the first
journey, in which they met with nothing of this description. The object
of this prediction is to prevent them from being ever cast down: for it
was no ordinary attainment for poor and despised men, when they came
into the presence of princes, to preserve composure, and to remain
unmoved by any worldly splendor. He warns them, too, that not in Judea
only, but in more distant places, they will be called to fight; and he
does so, not merely for the purpose of preparing them by long meditation
for that warfare, but that, as instructed and experienced masters, they
might not scruple to yield themselves to heavenly guidance.

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p24"></span>*For a testimony to them and to the
Gentiles* This means that the will of God must be proclaimed even to
foreign princes, and to distant nations, that they may be without
excuse. Hence it follows, that the labor of the apostles will not be
lost, for it will vindicate the judgment of God, when men shall be
convicted of their obstinacy.

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p25"></span><span id="ix.lxxxv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p26"></span>**19.** *Be not anxious*  <span
id="fr_584"></span>[585](#fn_584.md) A consolation is added: for in vain
would Christ have given a hundred exhortations to the disciples, if he
had not, at the same time, promised that God would be with them, and
that through his power they would assuredly be victorious. Hence we
infer, that Christ is very far from intending, by announcing those
dangers, to abate the fervor of that zeal with which it would be
necessary for the disciples to burn if they wished to discharge their
duty in a proper manner. It is, no doubt, a great matter to endure the
presence of princes; for not only fear, but even shame, sometimes
overpowers well-regulated minds. What, then, may be expected, if princes
break out into furious anger, and almost thunder?  <span
id="fr_585"></span>[586](#fn_585.md) Yet Christ charges his disciples not
to be anxious.

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p29"></span>*For in that hour shall be given to you
what you shall speak* The Spirit will suggest words to them. The more a
man distrusts himself through consciousness of his own weakness, the
more is he alarmed, unless he expect assistance from another quarter.
Accordingly, we see that the reason why most men give way is, that they
measure by their own strength, which is very small or almost nothing,
the success of their undertakings. Christ forbids the disciples to look
at their own strength, and enjoins them to rely, with undivided
confidence, on heavenly grace. “It is not,” he says, “your ability that
is in question, but the power of the Holy Spirit, who forms and guides
the tongues of believers to a sincere confession of their faith.”

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p30"></span>That they may not be alarmed by their
present deficiency, he assures them that assistance will come *at the
very instant* when it is needed. Frequently does it happen that the Lord
leaves believers destitute of the gift of eloquence, so long as he does
not require that they give him a testimony, but, when the necessity for
it arrives, those who formerly appeared to be dumb are endued by him
with more than ordinary eloquence. Thus, in our own time, we have seen
some martyrs, who seemed to be almost devoid of talent, and yet were no
sooner called to make a public profession of their faith, than they
exhibited a command of appropriate and graceful language altogether
miraculous.  <span id="fr_586"></span>[587](#fn_586.md)

<span id="ix.lxxxv-p32"></span>Yet it was not the will of Christ that
the apostles should be free from all care: for it was advantageous to
them to have such a measure of anxiety, as to supplicate and entreat
that the Spirit might be given to them; but he desired to remove that
deep and uneasy thought which almost always tends to perplex and
embarrass. So long as men indulge in conjecture what is to take place,
or whether this or the other thing will happen, and do not rely on the
providence of God, they are kept in a wretched state of trouble and
uneasiness. And, indeed, those who do not render such honor to the
providence of God, as to believe that it will seasonably relieve their
wants, deserve to be tormented in this manner.
