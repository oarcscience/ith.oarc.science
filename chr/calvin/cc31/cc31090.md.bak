<span id="ix.lxxxii-p5"></span>**28**.** **And when he had come to the
opposite bank,  <span id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541.md) into the country
of the Gergesenes, two demoniacs, who had come from among the tombs, met
him: and they were fierce beyond measure, so that no man could pass
along that road. **29**.** **And, lo, they cried out, saying, What have
we to do with thee, Jesus, Son of God? Hast thou come hither before the
time to torment us? **30**.** **And at a distance from them there was a
herd of many swine feeding. **31**.** **And the devils entreated him,
saying, If thou cast us out, permit us to remove into the herd of swine.
**32**.** **And he said to them, Go. And when they had gone out, they
went away into the heard of swine. And, lo, the whole herd was carried
headlong into the sea, and perished in the waters. **33**.** **And those
who had the charge of them fled; and going away into the city, they
related all things, and what had happened to the demoniacs,
**34**.** **And, lo, the whole city went out to meet Jesus; and when
they saw him, they entreated him, that he would depart from their
territories.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p7"></span>**1**.** **And having crossed the sea,
they came into the country of Gaderanes. **2**.** **And when he left the
ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man possessed by an
unclean spirit, **3**.** **Who had a dwelling among the tombs,  <span
id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542.md) and no man could bind him, not even
with chains: **4**.** **Because frequently, when he had been bound with
fetters and chains, the chains were torn asunder by him, and the fetters
were broken in pieces, so that no man could tame him. **5**.** **And
always, day and night, he was in the mountains, and among the tombs,
crying, and cutting himself with stones. **6**.** **And when he saw
Jesus at a distance, he ran and worshipped him: **7**.** **And, crying
with a loud voice, he said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of
the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, that thou do not torment me.
**8**.** **For he said to him, Go out of the man, unclean spirit.
**9**.** **And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying
to him, My name is Legion: for there are many. **10**.** **And he
entreated him earnestly, that he would not send him out of the country.
**11**.** **And there was there, near the mountains, a great herd of
swine feeding. **12**.** **And all the devils besought him, saying, Send
us into the swine, that we may enter into them. **13**.** **And
immediately Jesus permitted them. And the unclean spirit having gone
out, entered into the swine, and the herd was carried headlong into the
sea: and they were about two thousand, and were choked in the sea.
**14**.** **Then those who tended the swine fled, and told it in the
city and in the fields. And they went out to see what it was that had
happened. **15**.** **And they come to Jesus, and see the demoniac who
had had the Legion, sitting and clothed, and in his right mind, and they
were afraid. **16**.** **And those who had seen, related how it had
happened to the demoniac, and concerning the swine. **17**.** **And they
began to request him to depart from their territories. **18**.** **And
when he entered into a ship, he who had been possessed by a devil
besought him that he might be with him. **19**.** **But Jesus did not
permit him: but said to him, Go to thy home, to thy friends, and relate
to them how great things God hath done to thee, and hath pitied thee.
**20**.** **And he went away, and began to publish in Decapolis how
great things Jesus had done for him: and all wondered.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p9"></span>**26**.** **And they sailed to the
country of the Gaderenes, which is opposite to Galilee. **27**.** **And
when he had gone out of the ship into the land, there met him a certain
man out of the city, who had devils for along time, and wore no clothes,
and did not dwell in a house, but among the tombs. **28**.** **When he
saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him,  <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md) and said with a loud voice, What have
I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech thee, do
not torment me. **29**.** **For he was commanding the unclean spirit to
go out of the man: for many times it had seized him, and he was bound by
chains, and kept in fetters, and he broke the chains, and was driven by
the devil into the deserts. **30**.** **And Jesus asked him, saying,
What is thy name? And he said, Legion: for many devils had entered into
him. **31**.** **And they entreated him that he would not command them
to go into the deep. **32**.** **And there was there a herd of many
swine feeding on the mountains, and they requested him to permit them to
enter into them: and he permitted them. **33**.** **And the devils going
out of the man entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down
headlong into the lake, and were choked. **34**.** **And when those who
tended them saw what was done, they fled, and told it in the city and in
the villages. **35**.** **And they went out  <span
id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md) to see what was done, and came to
Jesus, and found the man from whom the devils and had gone out, clothed,
and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus; and they were afraid.
**36**.** **And those who had seen, related to them how the demoniac had
been cured. **37**.** **And the whole multitude of the country of the
Gadarenes besought him to depart from them: for they were seized with a
great fear; and he went up into the ship, and returned back again.
**38**.** **And the man out of whom the devils had departed requested to
be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, **39**.** **Return to thy
house, and relate what things God hath done to thee.  <span
id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md) And he went away through the whole
city proclaiming what thing Jesus had done to him.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p13"></span> 

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p14"></span><span id="ix.lxxxii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p15"></span>The error of those who think that Mark
and Luke relate a different miracle from this, has been already refuted.
It is the same country which was opposite, as Luke expressly states, to
Galilee, that is described by the three Evangelists, and all the
circumstances agree. Who then will believe that the same things, so
fully coincident at all points, happened at different times?

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p16"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p16.2"></span>[Matthew
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p16.2"></span>** *Two demoniacs met him* Commentators have
been led into the error of separating Matthew’s narrative from that of
the others by this single difference, that he mentions *two,* while the
others mention but one. There is probability in the conjecture of
*Augustine,* who thinks that there were two, but accounts for not more
than one being mentioned here by saying, that this one was more
generally known, and that the aggravation of his disease made the
miracle performed on him the more remarkable. And, indeed, we see that
Luke and Mark employ many words in describing the extraordinary rage of
the devil, so as to make it evident that the wretched man, of whom they
speak, was grievously fomented. The circumstance of their holding up to
commendation one singular instance of Christ’s divine power is not
inconsistent with the narrative of Matthew, in which another, though
less known man,  <span id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) is also
mentioned.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p18"></span><span id="ix.lxxxii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p19"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p19.2"></span>[Luke
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#026.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p19.2"></span>.** *There met him a certain man out of the
city* It is uncertain whether Luke means that he was a citizen of
Gadara, or that he came out of it to meet Christ. For, when he was
ordered to go home and proclaim among his friends the grace of God, Mark
says, that he did this in Decapolis, which was a neighboring country
stretching towards Galilee; and hence it is conjectured that he was not
a native of Gadara. Again, Matthew and Mark expressly state that he did
not go *out of the city,* but *from the tombs,* and Luke himself,
throughout the whole passage, gives us to understand that the man lived
in solitary places. These words, therefore, *there met him a certain man
out of the city,* I understand to mean, that, before Christ came near
the city, the demoniac met him in that direction.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p20"></span>As to the opinion that the man dwelt
among the graves, either because devils are delighted with the stench of
dead bodies, or gratified by the smell of oblations, or because they
watch over souls which are desirous to approach their bodies; it is an
idle, and, indeed, a foolish conjecture. On the contrary, this wretched
man was kept among the graves by *an unclean spirit,* that he might have
an opportunity of terrifying him continually with the mournful spectacle
of death, as if he were cut off from the society of men, and already
dwelt among the dead. We learn from this also that the devil does not
only torment men in the present life, but pursues them even to death,
and that in death his dominion over them is chiefly exercised.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p21"></span><span id="ix.lxxxii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p22"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p22.2"></span>[Mark
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#003.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p22.2"></span>.** *And no man could bind him, not even
with chains* Naturally, he was not able to break the chains; and hence
we infer that Satan is sometimes permitted to make extraordinary
movements, the effect of which goes beyond our comprehension and beyond
ordinary means. We often perceive in madmen much greater strength than
belongs to their natural capacity; and we are not at liberty to deny
that, in such cases, the devil does his part when God permits him: but
the force, which is described by the Evangelists, was far greater.
 <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md) It was indeed a sad and
shocking exhibition, but may serve to remind us how wretched and
alarming it is to be placed under the tyranny of Satan, and also that
bodily agony, however violent or cruel, is not more to be dreaded than
distress of mind.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p24"></span><span id="ix.lxxxii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p25"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p25.1"></span>[Mark
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#006.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p25.1"></span>** *Worshipped him*  <span
id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) The arrangement of the narrative may
be thus stated. When the demoniacs came to meet him, Christ ordered *the
unclean spirits to go out of them,* and then they prayed and entreated
that he would not *torment them before the time* The *worship,*
therefore, did not precede Christ’s words: nor did they complain that
Christ gave them uneasiness,  <span id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md)
till he urged them to go out. We ought to be aware that they did not
come of their own accord into the presence of Christ, but were drawn by
a secret exercise of his authority. As they had formerly been accustomed
to carry men off, in furious violence, to *the tombs,* so now a superior
power compels them to appear reluctantly at the tribunal of their judge.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p28"></span>Hence we infer, that the whole of
Satan’s kingdom is subject to the authority of Christ.  <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) For the devils, when Christ summons
them to appear before him, are not more at their own disposal than were
the wretched men whom their tyranny was wont to drive about in every
direction. At length, by the secret power of Christ, they are dragged
before him, that, by casting them out, he may prove himself to be the
deliverer of men. Reluctantly too they *worship* him, and their
rebellious complaints testify that their confession was not made from
choice, but was drawn from them by force.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p30"></span><span id="ix.lxxxii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p31"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p31.2"></span>[Matthew
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p31.2"></span>.** *What have we to do with thee?*
Willingly would they, by this word, drive him far from them. But when
they see that they are held under restraint, and that it is in vain for
them to decline his authority, they complain that they are *tormented
before the time,* and likewise mingle entreaty. Thus we see that the
devils breathe nothing but rebellion against God; and yet, with all
their swelling pride, they are crushed and fall in a moment: for their
malice and obstinacy, which is never subdued, ceases not to struggle
against the government of God, and yet it is compelled to yield.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p32"></span>Christ does not openly reject, as he did
on other occasions, the confession of the devil; and the reason appears
to be, that their enmity towards him was so manifest, as to remove every
opportunity of unfavorable or calumnious imputation. Besides, Christ
paid regard to the spectators. Accordingly, when malicious and wicked
men were present, he was more eager to repress calumnies, and more
inclined to put a severe restraint on devils. On the present occasion,
it was quite enough that the devils, while they were offering a prayer
and entreaty, raged and stormed against him.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p33"></span>*Hast thou come hither before the time
to torment us?* Some explain this kind of *torment* as consisting in
their being compelled to set at absolute liberty the man whom they
possessed. Others understand it as referring to the last day of
judgment. My view of it is, that they trembled in the presence of their
Judge, while they thought of their punishment: for, though Christ said
nothing,  <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md) a bad conscience told
them what they deserved. As criminals, when they come to the
judgment-seat, expect their punishment, so devils and all wicked men
must tremble at the sight of God, as truly as if they already
experienced hell, the unquenchable fire, and the torments that await
them. Now, the devils knew that Christ was the Judge of the world; and
therefore we need not wonder that the sight of him impressed them with
dread of immediate torment.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p35"></span>Were they acquainted with the day of the
last judgment? This question, which some have proposed, is uncalled for.
What, then, is the meaning of the phrase, *before the time?* It means
that the reprobate never reckon that *the time* for punishing them is
fully come: for they would willingly delay it from day to day.  <span
id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) Any measure of delay, which the Lord
is pleased to allow them, is counted gain; and thus by subterfuges they
endeavor to avoid his sentence, though the attempt is to no purpose.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p37"></span><span id="ix.lxxxii-p37.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p38"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p38.2"></span>[Mark
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#009.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p38.2"></span>** *My name is Legion.* The devil was
compelled by Christ to pronounce this word, that he might more fully
display the greatness and excellence of his grace. There must have been
good reasons why this man should have endured so severe a punishment as
to have an army of devils, so to speak, dwelling within him. What
compassion then was it, to rescue from so many deaths a man who was more
than a thousand times ruined! It was a magnificent display of the power
of Christ., that by his voice not one devil, but a great multitude of
devils, were suddenly driven out. *Legion* denotes here not a definite
number of men, but merely a great multitude.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p39"></span>Hence it is evident what a wretched
creature man is, when he is deprived of the divine protection. Every man
is not only exposed to a single devil, but becomes the retreat of vast
numbers. This passage refutes also the common error, which has been
borrowed by Jews and Christians from the heathens, that every man is
attacked by his own particular devil? On the contrary, Scripture plainly
declares, that, just as it pleases God, one devil  <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) is sometimes sent to punish a whole
nation, and at other times many devils are permitted to punish one man:
as, on the other hand, one angel sometimes protects a whole nation, and
every man has many angels to act as his guardians. There is the greater
necessity for keeping diligent watch, lest so great a multitude of
enemies should take us by surprise.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p41"></span><span id="ix.lxxxii-p41.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p42"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p42.2"></span>[Mark
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#010.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p42.2"></span>.** *And entreated him earnestly* Luke says,
they requested that they might not be sent *into the deep* Some explain
these words to mean that they wished to avoid uninhabited places.  <span
id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) I rather view it as referring to their
rage for doing mischief. As the devils have no other object than to
prowl among men, like lions in search of prey, they are grieved at being
plunged into the deep, where they will have no opportunity of injuring
and ruining men. That this is the true meaning may be inferred from the
words of Mark, who says that they requested that they might not be
compelled to go *out of the country* In a word, they manifest their
disposition to be such, that there is nothing which they more eagerly
desire than the destruction of mankind.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p44"></span><span id="ix.lxxxii-p44.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p45"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p45.2"></span>[Matthew
8:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#031.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p45.2"></span>.** *Permit us to depart into the herd of
swine* Some conjecture that they wished to attack the swine, because
they are filled with enmity to all God’s creatures. I do admit it to be
true, that they are entirely bent on confounding and overthrowing the
whole order of nature which God has appointed. But it is certain that
they had a more remote object in view, to excite the inhabitants of that
country to curse God on account of the loss of the swine. When the devil
thunders against Job’s house, he does so not from any hatred he bears to
timber or stones, but in order that the good man, through impatience at
suffering loss, may break out against God. Again, when Christ consents,
he does not listen to their prayers, but chooses to try in this manner
what sort of people the Gadarenes are. Perhaps, too, it is to punish
their crimes that he grants to the devils so much power over their
swine. While the reason of it is not known by us with certainty, it is
proper for us to behold with reverence and to adore with devout
humility, the hidden judgment of God. This passage shows also the
foolish trifling of some irreligious men, who imagine that the devils
are not actually existing spirits, but merely the depraved affections of
men: for how could covetousness, ambition, cruelty, and deceit, enter
into the swine? Let us learn also, that *unclean spirits* (as they are
devoted to destruction) are the enemies of mankind; so that they plunge
all whom they can into the same destruction with themselves.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p46"></span><span id="ix.lxxxii-p46.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p47"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p47.2"></span>[Mark
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#015.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p47.2"></span>.** *And they come to Jesus* We have here a
striking proof that not all who perceive the hand of God profit as they
ought to do by yielding themselves to him in sincere godliness. Having
seen the miracle, the Gadarenes were afraid, because the majesty of God
shone brightly in Christ. So far they did right but now that they send
him out of their territories, what could have been done worse than this?
They too were scattered, and here is a shepherd to collect them or
rather, it is God who stretches out his arms, through his Son, to
embrace and carry to heaven those who were overwhelmed by the darkness
of death. They choose rather to be deprived of the salvation which is
offered to them, than to endure any longer the presence of Christ.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p48"></span>The apparent ground of their offense is
the loss of the swine, but Luke assigns a loftier cause, that they were
*seized with a great fear*;  <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md) and
certainly, if they had been exasperated by the loss which they
sustained, they would not have *requested* him, but would rudely have
driven him out. They honor him as God’s minister, and yet are so struck
with dread as to desire that he will go to a distance from them. Thus we
see that they were not at all moved by a sense of the divine grace. And
indeed, though all wicked men adore God, and bestow great pains on
appeasing him, yet if they had their choice, they would withdraw to the
greatest possible distance from him: for his face is terrible, so long
as they contemplate him as a Judge, and not as a Father. The consequence
is, that the gospel, which is more delightful than any thing that can be
conceived, is everywhere considered to be so dismal and severe, that a
good part of the world would wish that it were buried.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p50"></span>And yet it is true that their fear was
partly occasioned by their loss. Thus at the present day, so long as men
believe that the kingdom of God is opposed to their interest, either of
a public or private nature, they are prepossessed by a depraved and
carnal fear, and have no relish for his grace. Accordingly, when he
comes, they think that God does not regard them with favor, but rather
with anger, and, so far as lies in their power, they send him to another
place. It is a mark of shameful insensibility in those men, that the
loss of their swine gives them more alarm than the salvation of their
soul would give them joy.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p51"></span><span id="ix.lxxxii-p51.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p52"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p52.2"></span>[Luke
8:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#038.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxii-p52.2"></span>.** *And the men requested* The Gadarenes
cannot endure to have Christ among them but he who has been delivered
from the devil is desirous to leave his own country and follow him.
Hence we learn how wide is the difference between the knowledge of the
*goodness,* and the knowledge of the *power,* of God. *Power* strikes
men with terror, makes them fly from the presence of God, and drives
them to a distance from him: but *goodness* draws them gently, and makes
them feel that nothing is more desirable than to be united to God. Why
Christ refuses to have this man as one of his followers we cannot
determine with certainty, if it was not that he expected the man to make
himself more extensively useful by communicating to his Gentile
countrymen the remarkable and extraordinary act of kindness which he had
received; and this he actually did, as we are assured by Mark and Luke.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p53"></span><span id="ix.lxxxii-p53.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p54"></span>**39.** *Relate those things which God
hath done for thee*. He bids him *relate* not his own work, but the work
of *God* His design in doing so is, that he may be acknowledged to be
the true minister and prophet of God, and may thus acquire authority in
teaching. In this gradual manner it was proper to instruct an ignorant
people who were not yet acquainted with his divinity. Though Christ is
the ladder by which we ascend to God the Father, yet, as he was not yet
fully manifested, he begins with the Father, till a fitter opportunity
occurred.

<span id="ix.lxxxii-p55"></span>We must now add the symbolical meaning.
 <span id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) In the person of one man Christ
has exhibited to us “proof of his grace” which is extended to all
mankind. Though we are not tortured by the devil, yet he holds us as his
slaves,  <span id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) till the Son of God
delivers us from his tyranny.  <span id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md)
Naked, torn, and disfigured, we wander about,  <span
id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md) till he restores us to soundness of
mind. It remains that, in magnifying his grace, we testify our
gratitude.

id="ix.lxxxii-p49.1"></span>,) is by most Commentators understood of

addenda est anagoge. — “<span id="ix.lxxxii-p56.3"></span>Maintenant il
rested adjouster la deduction ou derivation;” — “it now remains to add
the inference or remoter instruction.” — The word *anagoge,* or rather
ἀναγωγὴ was technically employed by divines of the *allegorizing* school
to denote the *mystical* meaning, which was the last and most recondite,
as the *literal* was the first and most obvious, of the various meanings
which they supposed to be contained in every verse of the Bible. Never
did those men encounter a more zealous or more formidable opponent than
Calvin. But, while he manfully sets his face against all that is
*mystical,* when it can plead no higher authority than the ravings of a
wild imagination, he is equally careful that those instructions which
are indicated, though not directly conveyed, by the sacred writers,
shall receive due consideration. He lays down as a general principle,
which he endeavors to support by the word of God, that the cures of
bodily diseases, performed by our Lord and his apostles, were intended
to be *symbolical of* the removal of spiritual diseases by the power and
grace of the Great Physician. Seldom does he close his illustration of
one of those miracles without adverting to the loftier and more
important occasions on which the arm of the Deliverer will put forth its
strength. It is to this *symbolical* meaning that Calvin, under the word
ἀναγωγὴ, borrowing the language, but disavowing the principles, of an
ancient school, now proceeds to draw the attention of his reader. The
grounds of his opinion it were foreign to our purpose to examine, but we
have judged it necessary to append this note, in order to bring out
clearly what the Author means. — *Ed.*
