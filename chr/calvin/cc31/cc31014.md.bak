<span id="ix.vi-p1"></span>LUKE 1:26-33

<span id="ix.vi-p2"></span><span id="ix.vi-p2.1"></span>[Luke
1:26-33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#026.md)<span id="ix.vi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p3"></span>**26**.** **Now in the sixth month the angel
Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,
**27**.** **To a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the
house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. **28**.** **And the
angel, coming in to her, said, Hail, thou who hast found favor, the Lord
is with thee: blessed art thou among women. **29**.** **But when she had
seen him, she was agitated by his address, and was considering what that
salutation would be. **30**.** **And the angel saith to her, Fear not,
Mary: for thou hast found favor with God. **31**.** **Behold, thou shalt
conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son, and thou shalt call
his name JESUS. **32**.** **He shall be great, and shall be called the
Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of
David his father: **33**.** **And he shall reign over the house of Jacob
for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.

<span id="ix.vi-p5"></span><span id="ix.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p6"></span>**26.** *Now in the sixth month* It was a
wonderful dispensation of the divine purpose, and far removed from the
ordinary judgment of men, that God determined to make the beginning of
the generation of the herald more illustrious than that of his own Son.
The prophecy respecting John was published in the temple and universally
known: Christ is promised to a virgin in an obscure town of Judea, and
this prophecy remains buried in the breast of a young woman. But it was
proper that, even from the birth of Christ, that saying should be
fulfilled,

<span id="ix.vi-p7"></span>*“*it pleased God by foolishness to save them
that believe,”  
(<span id="ix.vi-p7.2"></span>[1Co
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#021)<span id="ix.vi-p7.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.vi-p8"></span>The treasure of this mystery was committed by
him to a virgin in such a manner, that at length, when the proper time
came, it might be communicated to all the godly. It was, I own, a mean
kind of guardianship; but whether for trying the humility of faith, or
restraining the pride of the ungodly, it was the best adapted. Let us
learn, even when the reason does not immediately appear, to submit
modestly to God, and let us not be ashamed to receive instruction from
her who carried in her womb Christ the eternal *“*wisdom of God*,”*
(<span id="ix.vi-p8.1"></span>[1Co
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#024)<span id="ix.vi-p8.1"></span>..md)
There is nothing which we should more carefully avoid than the proud
contempt that would deprive us of the knowledge of the inestimable
secret, which God has purposely *“hid from the wise and prudent, and
revealed*” to the humble and *“to babes*,” (<span
id="ix.vi-p8.2"></span>[Lu 10:21](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#021.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p8.2"></span>.)

<span id="ix.vi-p9"></span>It was, I think, for the same reason that he
chose *a virgin betrothed to a man* There is no foundation for Origen’s
opinion, that he did this for the purpose of concealing from Satan the
salvation which he was preparing to bestow on men. The marriage was a
veil held out before the eyes of the world, that he who was commonly
*“supposed to be the son of Joseph*” (<span id="ix.vi-p9.1"></span>[Lu
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#023)<span id="ix.vi-p9.1"></span>.md)
might at length be believed and acknowledged by the godly to be the Son
of God. Yet the entrance of Christ into the world was not destitute of
glory; for the splendor of his Godhead was manifested from the
commencement by his heavenly Father. Angels announced that *“a Savior
was born,”* (<span id="ix.vi-p9.2"></span>[Lu
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#011)<span id="ix.vi-p9.2"></span>;.md)
but their voice was only heard by the shepherds, and traveled no
farther. One miracle, — everywhere published by *“the wise men who came
from the east*,” (<span id="ix.vi-p9.3"></span>[Mt
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001)<span id="ix.vi-p9.3"></span>.md) that
they had seen a star which proclaimed the birth of the Highest King,—may
have been highly celebrated. Yet we see how God kept his Son, as it
were, in concealment, until the time of his full manifestation arrived,
and then erected for him a platform, that he might be beheld by all.

<span id="ix.vi-p10"></span>The participle <span
id="ix.vi-p10.1"></span>μεμνηστευμένην, which is employed by the
Evangelist, signifies that the virgin had then been engaged to her
bridegroom, but was not yet given as a wife to her husband. For it was
customary among Jewish parents to keep their daughters some time at
home, after they had been betrothed to men; otherwise, the law relating
to the seduction of a *“*betrothed damsel” (<span
id="ix.vi-p10.2"></span>[De 22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p10.2"></span>) would have been unnecessary. Luke says that
*Joseph was of the house of David;* for families are usually reckoned by
the names of the men; but on this point we shall speak more fully in
another place.

<span id="ix.vi-p11"></span><span id="ix.vi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p12"></span>**28.** *Hail, thou who hast obtained favor*
The angel’s commission being of an astonishing and almost incredible
description, he opens it with a commendation of the grace of God. And
certainly, since our limited capacities admit too slender a portion of
knowledge for comprehending the vast greatness of the works of God, our
best remedy is, to elevate them to meditation on his boundless grace. A
conviction of the Divine goodness is the entrance of faith, and the
angel properly observes this order, that, after preparing the heart of
the virgin by meditation on the grace of God, he may enlarge it to
receive an incomprehensible mystery. For the participle <span
id="ix.vi-p12.1"></span>κεχαριτωμένη, which Luke employs, denotes the
undeserved favor of God. This appears more clearly from the Epistle to
the Ephesians, (<span id="ix.vi-p12.2"></span>[Eph
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006)<span id="ix.vi-p12.2"></span>,.md)
where, speaking of our reconciliation to *God,* Paul says, God *“*hath
made us accepted (<span id="ix.vi-p12.3"></span>ἐχαρίτωσεν) in the
Beloved:” that is, he has received into his favor, and embraced with
kindness, us who were formerly his enemies.

<span id="ix.vi-p13"></span>The angel adds, *the Lord is with thee* To
those on whom he has once bestowed his love God shows himself gracious
and kind, follows and *“*crowns them with loving-kindness,” (<span
id="ix.vi-p13.1"></span>[Ps 103:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#004.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p13.1"></span>.) Next comes the third clause, that she is
*blessed among women. Blessing* is here put down as the result and proof
of the Divine kindness. The word *Blessed* does not, in my opinion,
mean, Worthy of praise; but rather means, Happy. *Thus,* Paul often
supplicates for believers, first “grace” and then “peace,” (<span
id="ix.vi-p13.2"></span>[Ro 1:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#007.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p13.2"></span>; <span id="ix.vi-p13.3"></span>[Eph
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#002)<span id="ix.vi-p13.3"></span>,.md)
that is, every kind of blessings; implying that we shall then be truly
happy and rich, when we are beloved by God, from whom all blessings
proceed. But if Mary’s happiness, righteousness, and life, flow from the
undeserved love of God, if her virtues and all her excellence are
nothing more than the Divine kindness, it is the height of absurdity to
tell us that we should seek from her what she derives from another
quarter in the same manner as ourselves. With extraordinary ignorance
have the Papists, by an enchanter’s trick, changed this salutation into
a prayer, and have carried their folly so far, that their preachers are
not permitted, in the pulpit, to implore the grace of the Spirit, except
through their *Hail, Mary*  <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) But not
only are these words a simple congratulation. They unwarrantably assume
an office which does not belong to them, and which God committed to none
but an angel. Their silly ambition leads them into a second blunder, for
they salute a person who is absent.

<span id="ix.vi-p15"></span><span id="ix.vi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p16"></span>**29.** *When she had seen him, she was
agitated* Luke does not say that *she was agitated* by the presence of
the angel, but *by his address.* Why then does he also mention his
presence?  <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) The reason, I think, is
this. Perceiving in the angel something of heavenly glory, she was
seized with sudden dread arising out of reverence for God. *She was
agitated,* because she felt that she had received a salutation, not from
a mortal man, but from an angel of God. But Luke does not say that she
was so *agitated* as to have lost recollection. On the contrary, he
mentions an indication of an attentive and composed mind; for he
afterwards adds, *and was considering what that salutation would be:*
that is, what was its object, and what was its meaning. It instantly
occurred to her that the angel had not been sent for a trifling purpose.
This example reminds us, first, that we ought not to be careless
observers of the works of God; and, secondly, that our consideration of
them ought to be regulated by fear and reverence.

<span id="ix.vi-p18"></span><span id="ix.vi-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p19"></span>**30.** *Fear not, Mary* He bids her lay
aside fear. Let us always remember—what arises from the weakness of the
flesh—that, whenever the feeblest ray of the Divine glory bursts upon
us, we cannot avoid being alarmed. When we become aware, in good
earnest, of the presence of *God,* we cannot think of it apart from its
effects.  <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) Accordingly, as we are
all amenable to his tribunal, fear gives rise to trembling, until God
manifests himself as a Father. The holy virgin saw in her own nation
such a mass of crimes, that she had good reason for dreading heavier
punishments. To remove this fear, the angel declares that he has come to
certify and announce an inestimable blessing. The Hebrew idiom, Thou
*hast found favor,* is used by Luke instead of, “God has been merciful
to thee:” for a person is said to *find favor,* not when he has sought
it, but when it has been freely offered to him. Instances of this are so
well known, that it would be of no use to quote them.

<span id="ix.vi-p21"></span><span id="ix.vi-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p22"></span>**31.** *Behold, thou shalt conceive in thy
womb* The angel adapts his words, first to Isaiah’s prophecy, (<span
id="ix.vi-p22.1"></span>[Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p22.1"></span>,) and next to other passages of the Prophets,
with the view of affecting more powerfully the mind of the virgin: for
such prophecies were well known and highly esteemed among the godly. At
the same time, it ought to be observed that the angel did not merely
speak in private to the ear of the virgin, but brought *glad tidings,
(*<span id="ix.vi-p22.2"></span>εὐαγγέλιον*,)* which were shortly
afterwards to be published throughout the whole world. It was not
without the purpose of God, that the agreement, between ancient
prophecies and the present message respecting the manifestation of
Christ, was so clearly pointed out. The word *conceive* is enough to set
aside the dream of Marcion and Manichaeus: for it is easy to gather from
it that Mary brought forth not an ethereal body or phantom, but the
fruit which she had previously conceived in her womb.

<span id="ix.vi-p23"></span>*Thou shalt call his name Jesus* The reason
of the name is given by Matthew: *for he shall save his people from
their sins,* **(**<span id="ix.vi-p23.1"></span>[Mt
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#021.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p23.1"></span>**.)** And so the name contains a promise of
salvation, and points out the object for which *Christ* was sent by the
Father into the world, as he tells us that he “came not to judge the
world, but to save the world,” (<span id="ix.vi-p23.2"></span>[Joh
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#047)<span id="ix.vi-p23.2"></span>..md)
Let us remember that not by the will of men, but by the command of God,
was this name given to him by the angel, that our faith may have its
foundation, not in earth, but in heaven. It is derived from the Hebrew
word <span id="ix.vi-p23.3"></span>ישע, salvation, from which comes
<span id="ix.vi-p23.4"></span>הושיע, which signifies to save. It is a
waste of ingenuity to contend that it differs from the Hebrew name <span
id="ix.vi-p23.5"></span>יהושוע, (Jehoshua or Joshua.) The Rabbins
everywhere write the word *Jesu;* and they do this with evident malice,
that they may not bestow on Christ an honorable name, but, on the
contrary, may insinuate that he is some pretended Jew. Their manner of
writing it, accordingly, is of no more importance than the barking of a
dog. The objection that it is far beneath the dignity of the Son of God
to have a name in common with others, might equally apply to the name
*Christ,* or *Anointed* But the solution of both is easy. What was
exhibited in shadow under the law is fully and actually manifested in
the Son of God; or, what was then a figure is in him a substance. There
is another objection of as little weight. They assert that the name of
Jesus is not worthy of veneration and awe, that at the name of Jesus
every knee should bow, (<span id="ix.vi-p23.6"></span>[Phil.
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010)<span id="ix.vi-p23.6"></span>,.md) if
it does not belong exclusively to the Son of God. For Paul does not
attribute to him a magical name, as if in its very syllables majesty
resided, but his language simply means that Christ has received from the
Father the highest authority, to which the whole world ought to submit.
Let us then bid adieu to such imaginations, and know, that the name
*Jesus* was given to Christ, in order that believers may be instructed
to seek in him what had formerly been shadowed out under the Law.

<span id="ix.vi-p24"></span><span id="ix.vi-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p25"></span>**32.** *He shall be great* The angel had
said the same thing about John the Baptist, and yet did not intend to
make him equal to Christ. But the Baptist is great in his own class,
while the greatness of Christ is immediately explained to be such as
raises him above all creatures. For to him alone this belongs as his own
peculiar prerogative to be called the Son of God. So the apostle argues.

<span id="ix.vi-p26"></span>Unto which of the angels said he at any
time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? (<span
id="ix.vi-p26.1"></span>[Heb 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p26.1"></span>.)

<span id="ix.vi-p27"></span>Angels and kings, I admit, are sometimes
dignified with this title in Scripture; but they are denominated in
common the sons of God, on account of their high rank. But it is
perfectly clear and certain, that God distinguishes his own Son from all
the others, when he thus addresses him particularly, Thou art my Son,
(<span id="ix.vi-p27.1"></span>[Ps
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007)<span id="ix.vi-p27.1"></span>..md)
Christ is not confounded either with angels or with men, so as to be one
of the multitude of the sons of God; but what is given to him no other
has a right to claim. The sons of God are kings, not certainly by
natural right, but because God has bestowed on them so great an honor.
Even angels have no right to this distinction, except on account of
their high rank among creatures, in subordination to the Great Head,
(<span id="ix.vi-p27.2"></span>[Eph
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021)<span id="ix.vi-p27.2"></span>..md)
We too are sons, but by adoption, which we obtain by faith; for we have
it not from nature: Christ is the only Son, the only-begotten of the
Father, (<span id="ix.vi-p27.3"></span>[Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014)<span id="ix.vi-p27.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.vi-p28"></span>The future tense of the verb, he shall be
called *the Son of the Highest,* is tortured by that filthy dog  <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) Servetus to prove that Christ is not the
eternal Son of *God,* but began to be so considered, when he took upon
him our flesh. This is an intolerable slander. He argues that Christ was
not the Son of God before he appeared in the world clothed with flesh;
because the angel says, *He shall be called* On the contrary, I
maintain, the words of the angel mean nothing more than that he, who had
been the Son of God from eternity, would be manifested as such in the
flesh, (<span id="ix.vi-p29.4"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)<span id="ix.vi-p29.4"></span>;.md)
for *to be called* denotes clear knowledge. There is a wide difference
between the two statements, — that Christ began to be the Son of God,
which he was not before, — and that he was manifested among men, in
order that they might know him to be the person who had been formerly
promised. Certainly, in every age God has been addressed by his people
as a Father, and hence it follows, that he had a Son in heaven, from
whom and by whom men obtained the sonship. For men take too much upon
them, if they venture to boast of being the sons of God, in any other
respect than as members of the only-begotten Son, (<span
id="ix.vi-p29.5"></span>[Joh 1:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#018.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p29.5"></span>.) Certain it is, that confidence in the Son
alone, as Mediator, inspired the holy fathers with confidence to employ
so honorable an address. That more complete knowledge, of which we are
now speaking, is elsewhere explained by Paul to mean, that we are now at
liberty not only to call God our Father, but boldly to cry, Abba,
Father, (<span id="ix.vi-p29.6"></span>[Ro
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md)<span id="ix.vi-p29.6"></span>;
<span id="ix.vi-p29.7"></span>[Ga
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#006)<span id="ix.vi-p29.7"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.vi-p30"></span>*The Lord God will give unto him the throne
of his father David* We have said that the angel borrows from the
prophets the titles which he bestows on Christ, in order that the holy
virgin might more readily acknowledge him to be the Redeemer formerly
promised to the fathers. Whenever the prophets speak of the restoration
of the church, they direct all the hope of believers to the kingdom of
David, so that it became a common maxim among the Jews, that the safety
of the church would depend on the prosperous condition of that kingdom,
and that nothing was more fitting and suitable to the office of the
Messiah than to raise up anew the kingdom of David. Accordingly, the
name of David is sometimes applied to the Messiah. *“*They shall serve
the Lord their God, and David their king,” (<span
id="ix.vi-p30.1"></span>[Jer 30:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#009.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p30.1"></span>.) Again, “my servant David shall be a prince
among them,” (<span id="ix.vi-p30.2"></span>[Ezek.
34:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#024.md), [Ezek.
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#024)<span id="ix.vi-p30.2"></span>..md)
“They shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king,” (<span
id="ix.vi-p30.3"></span>[Ho 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p30.3"></span>.) The passages in which he is called *“*the son
of David” are sufficiently well known. In a word, the angel declares
that in the person of Christ would be fulfilled the prediction of Amos,
*“*In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen,”
(<span id="ix.vi-p30.4"></span>[Am
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#011)<span id="ix.vi-p30.4"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.vi-p31"></span><span id="ix.vi-p31.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p32"></span>**33.** *And he shall reign over the house
of Jacob* As salvation was promised, in a peculiar manner, to the Jews,
(the covenant having been made with their father Abraham, <span
id="ix.vi-p32.1"></span>[Ge 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p32.1"></span>,) and Christ, as Paul informs us, “was a
minister of the circumcision,” (<span id="ix.vi-p32.2"></span>[Ro
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008)<span id="ix.vi-p32.2"></span>,.md)
the angel properly fixed his reign in that nation, as its peculiar seat
and residence. But this is in perfect accordance with other predictions,
which spread and extend the kingdom of Christ to the utmost limits of
the earth. By a new and wonderful adoption, God has admitted into the
family of Jacob the Gentiles, who formerly were strangers; though in
such a manner that the Jews, as the first-born, held a preferable rank;
as it is said, “The Lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of
Zion,” (<span id="ix.vi-p32.3"></span>[Ps
110:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003)<span id="ix.vi-p32.3"></span>..md)
Christ’s throne was, therefore, erected among the people of Israel, that
he might thence subdue the whole world. All whom he has joined by faith
to the children of Abraham are accounted the true Israel. Though the
Jews, by their revolt, have separated themselves from the church of God,
yet the Lord will always preserve till the end some “remnants” (<span
id="ix.vi-p32.4"></span>[Ro 11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p32.4"></span>;) for his “calling is without repentances”
(<span id="ix.vi-p32.5"></span>[Ro
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029)<span id="ix.vi-p32.5"></span>..md)
The body of the people is apparently cut off; but we ought to remember
the *mystery* of which Paul speaks, (<span id="ix.vi-p32.6"></span>[Ro
11:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#025)<span id="ix.vi-p32.6"></span>,.md)
that God will at length gather some of the Jews out of the dispersion.
Meanwhile, the church, which is scattered through the whole world, is
the spiritual *house of Jacob;* for it drew its origin from Zion.

<span id="ix.vi-p33"></span>*For ever* The angel points out the sense in
which it was so frequently predicted by the prophets that the kingdom of
David would be without end. It was only during his own reign and that of
Solomon, that it remained wealthy and powerful Rehoboam, the third
successor, hardly retained a tribe and a half. The angel now declares
that, when it has been established in the person of Christ, it will not
be liable to destruction, and, to prove this, employs the words of
Daniel, (<span id="ix.vi-p33.1"></span>[Da
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014)<span id="ix.vi-p33.1"></span>,.md)
*of his kingdom there shall be no end*  <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) Though the meaning of the words is, that
God will for ever protect and defend the kingdom of Christ and the
church, so that it shall not perish on the earth “as long as the sun and
moon endure,” (<span id="ix.vi-p34.1"></span>[Ps.
72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#017)<span id="ix.vi-p34.1"></span>,.md)
yet its true perpetuity relates to the glory to come. So then, believers
follow each other in this life, by an uninterrupted succession, till at
length they are gathered together in heaven, where they shall reign
without end.

reconciled to the refinements of modern taste; but, three centuries ago,
few readers would be startled by them, and they are much more sparingly
employed by Calvin than by many of his contemporaries. Not to mention
that Paul says, *Beware of dogs,* (<span id="ix.vi-p29.1"></span>[Php
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#002)<span id="ix.vi-p29.1"></span>,.md)
and that the statement, *Without are dogs,* (<span
id="ix.vi-p29.2"></span>[Re 22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p29.2"></span>,) bears the impress of the *Alpha and Omega,*
(<span id="ix.vi-p29.3"></span>[Re
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#013)<span id="ix.vi-p29.3"></span>,.md)
Servetus, to whom the epithet *“filthy”* is applied, had denied the
fundamental doctrine of our Lord's supreme Divinity, and had luxuriated

<span id="ix.vi-p34"></span> Daniel's prediction referred to runs thus:
“His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and
his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.” The angel does not
employ these words; but his departure from them is not strongly marked,
and it can scarcely be doubted that he had this passage in his eye. —
*Ed.*
