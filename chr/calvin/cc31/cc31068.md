<span id="ix.lx-p4"></span>**31**.** **Be not therefore anxious, saying,
What shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or with what shall we be
clothed? **32**.** **For all those things the Gentiles seek: for your
heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of these things.
**33**.** **But rather seek first the kingdom of God, and his
righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.
**34**.** **Be not therefore anxious about tomorrow: for tomorrow will
take care of itself. Its own affliction is sufficient for the day.

<span id="ix.lx-p5"></span>**29**.** **And seek not what you shall eat,
or what you shall drink, and be not lifted on high. **30**.** **For all
these things the nations of the world seek: and your Father knoweth that
you have need of these things. **31**.** **But rather seek the kingdom
of God, and all these things shall be added to you. **32**.** **Fear
not, little flock: for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the
kingdom.

<span id="ix.lx-p6"></span> 

<span id="ix.lx-p7"></span><span id="ix.lx-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lx-p8"></span>This has the same object with the former
doctrine. Believers ought to rely on God’s fatherly care, to expect that
he will bestow upon them whatever they feel to be necessary, and not to
torment themselves by unnecessary anxiety.

<span id="ix.lx-p9"></span>He forbids them to be *anxious,* or, as Luke
has it, to *seek,* that is, to *seek* in the manner of those who look
around them in every direction, without looking at God, on whom alone
their eye ought to be fixed; who are never at ease, but when they have
before their eyes an abundance of provisions; and who, not admitting
that the protection of the world belongs to God, fret and tease
themselves with perpetual uneasiness.

<span id="ix.lx-p10"></span><span id="ix.lx-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lx-p11"></span>**<span id="ix.lx-p11.2"></span>[Matthew
6:32](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#032)<span id="ix.lx-p11.2"></span>.**
*For all those things the Gentiles seek* This is a reproof of the gross
ignorance, in which all such anxieties originate. For how comes it, that
unbelievers never remain in a state of tranquillity, but because they
imagine that God is unemployed, or asleep, in heaven, or, at least, that
he does not take charge of the affairs of men, or feed, as members of
his family, those whom he has admitted to his friendship. By this
comparison he intimates, that they have made little proficiency, and
have not yet learned the first lessons of godliness, who do not behold,
with the eyes of faith, the hand of God filled with a hidden abundance
of all good things, so as to expect their food with quietness and
composure. *Your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of those
things:* that is, “All those persons who are so anxious about food, give
no more honor, than unbelievers do, to the fatherly goodness and secret
providence of God.”

<span id="ix.lx-p12"></span><span id="ix.lx-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lx-p13"></span>**<span id="ix.lx-p13.2"></span>[Luke
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#029)<span id="ix.lx-p13.2"></span>.**
*And be not lifted on high*  <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459)
This clause corresponds to the last sentence in the passage taken from
Matthew, Be *not anxious about tomorrow* Our Lord now charges them with
another fault. When men wish to make arrangements in their own favor,
they would willingly embrace five centuries.  <span
id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460) The verb <span
id="ix.lx-p15.2"></span>μετεωρίζεσθαι*,* which Luke employs, properly
signifies *to survey from a lofty situation,* or, as we commonly say, to
make long discourses:  <span id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461) for the
intemperate desires of the flesh are never satisfied without making a
hundred revolutions of heaven and earth. The consequence is, that they
leave no room for the providence of God. This is a reproof of excessive
curiosity; for it leads us to bring upon ourselves uneasiness to no
purpose, and voluntarily to make ourselves miserable *before the time,*
(<span id="ix.lx-p16.2"></span>[Mt
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#029)<span id="ix.lx-p16.2"></span>.)
The expression used by Matthew, *its own affliction is sufficient for
the day,* directs believers to moderate their cares, and not to attempt
to carry their foresight beyond the limits of their calling: For, as we
have said, it does not condemn every kind of care, but only that which
wanders, by indirect and endless circuits, beyond limits.

<span id="ix.lx-p17"></span><span id="ix.lx-p17.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lx-p18"></span>**<span id="ix.lx-p18.2"></span>[Matthew
6:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033)<span id="ix.lx-p18.2"></span>.**
*But rather seek first the kingdom of God* This is another argument for
restraining excessive anxiety about food. It argues a gross and indolent
neglect of the soul, and of the heavenly life. Christ reminds us that
there is the greatest inconsistency in men, who are born to a better
life, being wholly employed about earthly objects. He who assigns the
first rank to *the kingdom of God,* will not carry beyond moderation his
anxiety about food. Nothing is better adapted to restrain the wantonness
of the flesh from breaking out in the course of the present life, than
meditation on the life of the heavens. The word *righteousness* may be
either understood as applying to *God,* or to *the kingdom:*  <span
id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462) for we know that the kingdom of God
consists in *righteousness,* (<span id="ix.lx-p19.1"></span>[Ro
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#017)<span id="ix.lx-p19.1"></span>,)
that is, in the newness of spiritual life. *All other things shall be
added* This means, that those things which relate to the present life
are but favorable appendages, and ought to be reckoned greatly inferior
to *the kingdom of God*

<span id="ix.lx-p20"></span><span id="ix.lx-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lx-p21"></span>**<span id="ix.lx-p21.2"></span>[Luke
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032)<span id="ix.lx-p21.2"></span>.**
*Fear not, little flock* By this declaration our Lord strengthens the
confidence to which he had exhorted his people: for how would God refuse
worthless and perishing food to those whom he has adopted as heirs of
his *kingdom?* And he expressly calls his own people *a little flock,*
to hinder them from thinking that they are of less value in the sight of
God, because, on account of their small numbers, they are held in little
estimation before the world. The verb <span
id="ix.lx-p21.3"></span>εὐδοκεῖν conveys the idea, that eternal life
flows to us from the fountain of undeserved mercy. For the same purpose
the word *give* is added. When Christ plainly declares, that God *hath
given us the kingdom,* and for no other reason, but because it so
*pleased* him, it is perfectly manifest, that it is not obtained by any
merits of works. At whatever time the Lord raises our minds to the
expectation of eternal life, let us remember, that we have no cause for
fear as to daily food.
