<span id="ix.xv-p1"></span>MATTHEW 1:18-25

<span id="ix.xv-p2"></span><span id="ix.xv-p2.1"></span>[Matthew
1:18-25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#018.md)<span id="ix.xv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xv-p3"></span>**18**.** **Now the birth of Jesus Christ was
in this manner. For when his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before
they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
**19**.** **And Joseph her husband, as he was a just man, and was
unwilling to injure her reputation, intended to send her away secretly.
**20**.** **And while he was considering these things, lo, the angel of
the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear
not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her
is by the Holy Spirit. **21**.** **And she shall bear a son, and thou
shalt call his name JESUS. For he shall save his people from their sins.
**22**.** **Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, **23**.** **Behold, a
virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, and they shall call
his name Immanuel: which, if one interprets it, means, God is with us.
**24**.** **Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of
the Lord had commanded him, and took unto him his wife: **25**.** **And
knew her not, till she brought forth her first-born son: and called his
name JESUS.

<span id="ix.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.xv-p5"></span><span id="ix.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xv-p6"></span>**18.** *Now the birth of Jesus Christ*
Matthew does not as yet relate the place or manner of Christ’s birth,
but the way in which his heavenly generation was made known to Joseph.
First, he says that Mary *was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit*
Not that this secret work of God was generally known: but the historian
mixes up, with the knowledge of men,  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) the power of the Spirit, which was still
unknown. He points out the time: *When she was espoused to Joseph,* and
*before they came together* So far as respects conjugal fidelity, from
the time that a young woman was betrothed to a man, she was regarded by
the Jews as his lawful wife. When a “damsel betrothed to an husband” was
convicted of being unchaste, the law condemned both of the guilty
parties as adulterers:

<span id="ix.xv-p8"></span>“the damsel, because she cried not, being in
the city;  
and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbor’s wife,”  
(<span id="ix.xv-p8.3"></span>[Deut.
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#023.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#024)<span id="ix.xv-p8.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xv-p9"></span>The phrase employed by the Evangelist,
*before they came together,* is either a modest appellation for conjugal
intercourse, or simply means, “before they came to dwell together as
husband and wife, and to make one home and family.” The meaning will
thus be, that the virgin had not yet been delivered by her parents into
the hands of her husband, but still remained under their roof.

<span id="ix.xv-p10"></span><span id="ix.xv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xv-p11"></span>**19.** *As he was a just man* Some
commentators explain this to mean, that Joseph, *because* he was a just
man, determined to spare his wife:  <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md)
taking *justice* to be only another name for humanity, or, a gentle and
merciful disposition. But others more correctly read the two clauses as
contrasted with each other: that Joseph *was a just man,* but yet that
he was anxious about the reputation of his wife. That justice, on which
a commendation is here bestowed, consisted in hatred and abhorrence of
crime. Suspecting his wife of adultery, and even convinced that she was
an adulterer, he was unwilling to hold out the encouragement of lenity
to such a crime.  <span id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) And certainly he
is but a pander  <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) to his wife, who
connives at her unchastity. Not only is such wickedness regarded with
abhorrence by good and honorable minds, but that winking at crime which
I have mentioned is marked by the laws with infamy.

<span id="ix.xv-p15"></span>Joseph, therefore, moved by an ardent love
*of justice,* condemned the crime of which he supposed his wife to have
been guilty; while the gentleness of his disposition prevented him from
going to the utmost rigor of law. It was a moderate and calmer method to
depart privately, and remove to a distant place.  <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) Hence we infer, that he was not of so
soft and effeminate a disposition, as to screen and promote uncleanness
under the pretense of merciful dealing: he only made some abatement from
stern justice, so as not to expose his wife to evil report. Nor ought we
to have any hesitation in believing, that his mind was restrained by a
secret inspiration of the Spirit. We know how weak jealousy is, and to
what violence it hurries its possessor. Though Joseph did not proceed to
rash and headlong conduct, yet he was wonderfully preserved from many
imminent dangers, which would have sprung out of his resolution to
depart.

<span id="ix.xv-p17"></span>The same remark is applicable to Mary’s
silence. Granting that modest reserve prevented her from venturing to
tell her husband, that *she was with child by the Holy Spirit,* it was
not so much by her own choice, as by the providence of God that she was
restrained. Let us suppose her to have spoken. The nature of the case
made it little short of incredible. Joseph would have thought himself
ridiculed, and everybody would have treated the matter as a
laughing-stock: after which the Divine announcement, if it had followed,
would have been of less importance. The Lord permitted his servant
Joseph to be betrayed by ignorance into an erroneous conclusion, that,
by his own voice, he might bring him back to the right path.

<span id="ix.xv-p18"></span>Yet it is proper for us to know, that this
was done more on our account than for his personal advantage: for every
necessary method was adopted by God, to prevent unfavorable suspicion
from falling on the heavenly message. When the angel approaches Joseph,
who is still unacquainted with the whole matter, wicked men have no
reason to charge him with being influenced by prejudice to listen to the
voice of God. He was not overcome by the insinuating address of his
wife. His previously formed opinion was not shaken by entreaties. He was
not induced by human arguments to take the opposite side. But, while the
groundless accusation of his wife was still rankling in his mind, God
interposed between them, that we might regard Joseph as a more competent
witness, and possessing greater authority, as a messenger sent to us
from heaven. We see how God chose to employ an angel in informing his
servant Joseph, that to others he might be a heavenly herald, and that
the intelligence which he conveyed might not be borrowed from his wife,
or from any mortal.

<span id="ix.xv-p19"></span>The reason why this mystery was not
immediately made known to a greater number of persons appears to be
this. It was proper that this inestimable treasure should remain
concealed, and that the knowledge of it should be imparted to none but
the children of God. Nor is it absurd to say, that the Lord intended, as
he frequently does, to put the faith and obedience of his own people to
the trial. Most certainly, if any man shall maliciously refuse to
believe and obey God in this matter, he will have abundant reason to be
satisfied with the proofs by which this article of our faith is
supported. For the same reason, the Lord permitted Mary to enter into
the married state, that under the veil of marriage, till the full time
for revealing it, the heavenly conception of the virgin might be
concealed. Meanwhile, the knowledge of it was withheld from unbelievers,
as their ingratitude and malice deserved.

<span id="ix.xv-p20"></span><span id="ix.xv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xv-p21"></span>**20.** *And while he was considering these
things* We see here how seasonably, and, as we would say, at the very
point, the Lord usually aids his people. Hence too we infer that, when
he appears not to observe our cares and distresses, we are still under
his eye. He may, indeed, hide himself, and remain silent; but, when our
patience has been subjected to the trial, he will aid us at the time
which his own wisdom has selected. How slow or late soever his
assistance may be thought to be, it is for our advantage that it is thus
delayed.

<span id="ix.xv-p22"></span>*The angel of the Lord appeared to him in a
dream* This is one of two ordinary kinds of revelations mentioned in the
book of Numbers, where the Lord thus speaks:

<span id="ix.xv-p23"></span>“If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord
will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in
a dream. My servant Moses is not so. With him will I speak mouth to
mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speechess,”  
(<span id="ix.xv-p23.2"></span>[Nu
12:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006)<span id="ix.xv-p23.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xv-p24"></span>But we must understand that dreams of this
sort differ widely from natural dreams; for they have a character of
certainty engraven on them, and are impressed with a divine seal, so
that there is not the slightest doubt of their truth. The dreams which
men commonly have, arise either from the thoughts of the *day,* or from
their natural temperament, or from bodily indisposition, or from similar
causes: while the dreams which come from God are accompanied by the
testimony of the Spirit, which puts beyond a doubt that it is God who
speaks.

<span id="ix.xv-p25"></span>*Son of David, fear not* This exhortation
shows, that Joseph was perplexed with the fear of sharing in the
criminality of his wife, by enduring her adultery. The angel removes his
suspicion of guilt, with the view of enabling him to dwell with his wife
with a safe conscience. The appellation, *Son of David,* was employed on
the present occasion, in order to elevate his mind to that lofty
mystery; for he belonged to that family, and was one of the surviving
few,  <span id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) from whom the salvation
promised to the world could proceed. When he heard the name of *David,*
from whom he was *descended,* Joseph ought to have remembered that
remarkable promise of God which related to the establishment of the
kingdom, so as to acknowledge that there was nothing new in what was now
told him. The predictions of the prophets were, in effect, brought
forward by the angel, to prepare the mind of Joseph for receiving the
present favor.

<span id="ix.xv-p27"></span><span id="ix.xv-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xv-p28"></span>**21.** *And thou shalt call his name*
*JESUS*. I have already explained briefly, but as far as was necessary,
the meaning of that word. At present I shall only add, that the words of
the angel set aside the dream of those who derive it from the essential
name of God, Jehovah; for the angel expresses the reason why the Son of
God is so called, *Because he shall* *SAVE* *his people;* which suggests
quite a different etymology from what they have contrived. It is justly
and appropriately added, they tell us, that Christ will be the author of
salvation, because he is the Eternal God. But in vain do they attempt to
escape by this subterfuge; for the nature of the blessing which God
bestows upon us is not all that is here stated. This office was
conferred upon his Son from the fact, from the command which had been
given to him by the Father, from the office with which he was invested
when he came down to us from heaven. Besides, the two words <span
id="ix.xv-p28.1"></span>᾿Ιησοῦς and <span id="ix.xv-p28.2"></span>יהוה*,
Jesus* and *Jehovah,* agree but in two letters, and differ in all the
rest; which makes it exceedingly absurd to allege any affinity whatever
between them, as if they were but one name. Such mixtures I leave to the
alchymists, or to those who closely resemble them, the Cabalists who
contrive for us those trifling and affected refinements.

<span id="ix.xv-p29"></span>When the Son of God came to us clothed in
flesh, he received from the Father a name which plainly told for what
purpose he came, what was his power, and what we had a right to expect
from him. for the name *Jesus* is derived from the Hebrew verb, in the
Hiphil conjugation, <span id="ix.xv-p29.1"></span>הושיע, which signifies
*to save* In Hebrew it is pronounced differently, *Jehoshua;* but the
Evangelists, who wrote in Greek, followed the customary mode of
pronunciation; for in the writings of Moses, and in the other books of
the Old Testament, the Hebrew word <span id="ix.xv-p29.2"></span>יהושוע,
*Jehoshua,* or *Joshua,* is rendered by the Greek translators <span
id="ix.xv-p29.3"></span>᾿Ιησοῦς, *Jesus* But I must mention another
instance of the ignorance of those who derive — or, I would rather say,
who forcibly tear — the name *Jesus* from *Jehovah* They hold it to be
in the highest degree improper that any mortal man should share this
name in common with the Son of God, and make a strange outcry that
Christ would never allow his name to be so profaned. As if the reply
were not at hand, that the name *Jesus* was quite as commonly used in
those days as the name *Joshua* Now, as it is sufficiently clear that
the name *Jesus* presents to us the Son of God as the Author of
salvation, let us examine more closely the words of the angel.

<span id="ix.xv-p30"></span>*He shall save his people from their sins*
The first truth taught us by these words is, that those whom Christ is
sent to save are in themselves lost. But he is expressly called the
Savior of the Church. If those whom God admits to fellowship with
himself were sunk in death and ruin till they were restored to life by
Christ, what shall we say of “strangers” (<span
id="ix.xv-p30.1"></span>[Eph 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md)<span
id="ix.xv-p30.1"></span>) who have never been illuminated by the hope of
life? When salvation is declared to be shut up in Christ, it clearly
implies that the whole human race is devoted to destruction. The cause
of this destruction ought also to be observed; for it is not unjustly,
or without good reason, that the Heavenly Judge pronounces us to be
accursed. The angel declares that we have perished, and are overwhelmed
by an awful condemnation, because we stand excluded from life by our
sins. Thus we obtain a view of our corruption and depravity; for if any
man lived a perfectly holy life, he might do without Christ as a
Redeemer. But all to a man need his grace; and, therefore, it follows
that they are the slaves of sin, and are destitute of true
righteousness.

<span id="ix.xv-p31"></span>Hence, too, we learn in what way or manner
Christ saves; he delivers us from sins This deliverance consists of two
parts. Having made a complete atonement, he brings us a free pardon,
which delivers us from condemnation to death, and reconciles us to God.
Again, by the sanctifying influences of his Spirit, he frees us from the
tyranny of Satan, that we may live “unto righteousness,” (<span
id="ix.xv-p31.1"></span>[1Pe 2:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024.md)<span
id="ix.xv-p31.1"></span>.) Christ is not truly acknowledged as a Savior,
till, on the one hand, we learn to receive a free pardon of our sins,
and know that we are accounted righteous before God, because we are free
from guilt; and till, on the other hand, we ask from him the Spirit of
righteousness and holiness, having no confidence whatever in our own
works or power. By Christ’s *people* the angel unquestionably means the
Jews, to whom he was appointed as Head and King; but as the Gentiles
were shortly afterwards to be ingrafted into the stock of Abraham,
(<span id="ix.xv-p31.2"></span>[Ro
11:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#017)<span id="ix.xv-p31.2"></span>,.md)
this promise of *salvation* is extended indiscriminately to all who are
incorporated by faith in the “one body” (<span
id="ix.xv-p31.3"></span>[1Co
12:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#020)<span id="ix.xv-p31.3"></span>.md)
of the Church.

<span id="ix.xv-p32"></span><span id="ix.xv-p32.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xv-p33"></span>**22.** *Now all this was done* It is
ignorant and childish trifling to argue, that the name *Jesus* is given
to the Son of God, because he is called *Immanuel* For Matthew does not
confine this assertion to the single fact of the name, but includes
whatever is heavenly and divine in the conception of Christ; and that is
the reason why he employs the general term *all* We must now see how
appropriately the prediction of Isaiah is applied. It is a well-known
and remarkable passage, (<span id="ix.xv-p33.1"></span>[Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)<span id="ix.xv-p33.1"></span>,.md)
but perverted by the Jews with their accustomed malice; though the
hatred of Christ and of truth, which they thus discover, is as blind and
foolish as it is wicked. To such a pitch of impudence have many of their
Rabbins proceeded, as to explain it in reference to King Hezekiah, who
was then about fifteen years of age. And what, I ask, must be their rage
for lying, when, in order to prevent the admission of clear light, they
invert the order of nature, and shut up a youth in his mother’s womb,
that he may be born sixteen years old? But the enemies of Christ deserve
that God should strike them with a spirit of giddiness and
insensibility, should

<span id="ix.xv-p34"></span>“pour out upon them a spirit of deep sleep
and close their eyes,”  
(<span id="ix.xv-p34.2"></span>[Isa
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#010)<span id="ix.xv-p34.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xv-p35"></span>Others apply it to a creature of their own
fancy, some unknown son of Ahaz, whose birth Isaiah predicted. But with
what propriety was he called *Immanuel,* or the land subjected to his
sway, who closed his life in a private station and without honor? for
shortly afterwards the prophet tells us that this child, whoever he was,
would be ruler of the land. Equally absurd is the notion that this
passage relates to the prophet’s son. On this subject we may remark,
that Christian writers have very strangely misapprehended the prediction
contained in the next chapter, by applying it to Christ. The prophet
there says, that, instructed by a vision, he “went unto the prophetess;
and she conceived, and bare a son,” and that the child whom she bore was
named by Divine command, ”Maher-shalal-hash-baz,” “Making speed to the
spoil, hasten the prey,” (<span id="ix.xv-p35.1"></span>[Isa
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#003)<span id="ix.xv-p35.1"></span>..md)
All that is there described is approaching war, accompanied by fearful
desolation; which makes it very manifest that the subjects are totally
different.

<span id="ix.xv-p36"></span>Let us now, therefore, investigate the true
meaning of this passage. The city of Jerusalem is besieged. Ahaz
trembles, and is almost dead with terror. The prophet is sent to assure
him that God will protect the city. But a simple promise is not
sufficient to compose his agitated mind. The prophet is sent to him,
saying,

<span id="ix.xv-p37"></span>“Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God;  
ask it either in the depth, or in the height above,”  
(<span id="ix.xv-p37.3"></span>[Isa
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#011)<span id="ix.xv-p37.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xv-p38"></span>That wicked hypocrite, concealing his
unbelief, disdains to ask a sign. The prophet rebukes him sharply, and
at length adds,

<span id="ix.xv-p39"></span>“The Lord himself shall give you a sign;
Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
Immanuel,”  
(<span id="ix.xv-p39.2"></span>[Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)<span id="ix.xv-p39.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xv-p40"></span>We expound this as relating to Christ in the
following manner: “You, the whole posterity of David, as far as lies in
your power, endeavor to nullify the grace which is promised to you;”
(for the prophet expressly calls them, by way of disgrace, the *house of
David,* <span id="ix.xv-p40.1"></span>[Isa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013)<span id="ix.xv-p40.1"></span>;.md)
“but your base infidelity will never prevent the truth of God from
proving to be victorious. God promises that the city will be preserved
safe and unhurt from its enemies. If his word is not enough, he is ready
to give you the confirmation of such a sign as you may demand. You
reject both favors, and spurn them from you; but God will remain steady
to his engagement. For the promised Redeemer will come, in whom God will
show himself to be fully present to his people.”

<span id="ix.xv-p41"></span>The Jews reply, that Isaiah would have been
at variance with everything like reason or probability, if he had given
to the men of that age a sign, which was not to be exhibited till after
the lapse of nearly eight hundred years. And then they assume the airs
of haughty triumph,  <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) as if this
objection of the Christians had originated in ignorance or
thoughtlessness, and were now forgotten and buried. But the solution, I
think, is easy; provided we keep in view that a covenant of adoption was
given to the Jews, on which the other acts of the divine kindness
depended. There was then a general promise, by which God adopted the
children of Abraham as a nation, and on which were founded all the
special promises. Again, the foundation of this covenant was the
Messiah. Now we hold, that the reason for delivering the city was, that
it was the sanctuary of God, and out of it the Redeemer would come. But
for this, Jerusalem would a hundred times have perished.

<span id="ix.xv-p43"></span>Let pious readers now consider, when the
royal family had openly rejected the sign which God had offered to them,
if it was not suitable that the prophet should pass all at once to the
Messiah, and address them in this manner: “Though this age is unworthy
of the deliverance of which God has given me a promise, yet God is
mindful of his covenant, and will rescue this city from its enemies.
While he grants no particular sign to testify his grace, this one sign
ought to be deemed more than sufficient to meet your wishes. from the
stock of David the Messiah will arise.” Yet it must be observed that,
when the prophet reminds unbelievers of the general covenant, it is a
sort of reproof, because they did not accept of a particular sign. I
have now, I think, proved that, when the door was shut against every
kind of miracle, the prophet made an appropriate transition to Christ,
for the purpose of leading unbelievers to reflect, that the only cause
of the deliverance was the covenant that had been made with their
fathers. And by this remarkable example has God been pleased to testify
to all ages, that he followed with uninterrupted kindness the children
of Abraham, only because in Christ, and not through their own merits, he
had made with them a gracious covenant.

<span id="ix.xv-p44"></span>There is another piece of sophistry by which
the Jews endeavor to parry our argument. Immediately after the words in
question, the prophet adds:

<span id="ix.xv-p45"></span>“Before the child shall know to refuse the
evil and choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken
of both her kings,”  
(<span id="ix.xv-p45.2"></span>[Isa
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#016)<span id="ix.xv-p45.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xv-p46"></span>Hence they infer, that the promised birth of
the child would be delayed for a very short time; otherwise, it would
not agree with the rapidly approaching change of the kingdoms, which,
the prophet announeed, would take place before that child should have
passed half the period of infancy. I reply, when Isaiah has given a sign
of the future Savior, and declared that a child will be born, who is the
true *Immanuel,* or — to use Paul’s language — *God manifest in the
flesh,* (<span id="ix.xv-p46.1"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)<span id="ix.xv-p46.1"></span>,.md)
he proceeds to speak, in general terms, of all the children of his own
time. A strong proof of this readily presents itself; for, after having
spoken of the general promise of God, he returns to the special promise,
which he had been commissioned to declare. The former passage, which
relates to a final and complete redemption, describes one particular
child, to whom alone belongs the name of God; while the latter passage,
which relates to a special benefit then close at hand, determines the
time by the childhood of those who were recently born, or would be born
shortly afterwards.

<span id="ix.xv-p47"></span>Hitherto, if I mistake not, I have refuted,
by strong and conclusive arguments, the calumnies of the Jews, by which
they endeavor to prevent the glory of Christ from appearing, with
resplendent luster, in this prediction. It now remains for us to refute
their sophistical reasoning about the Hebrew word <span
id="ix.xv-p47.1"></span>עלמה*, virgin*  <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) They wantonly persecute Matthew for
proving that Christ was born of a virgin,  <span
id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) while the Hebrew noun merely signifies
*a young woman;* and ridicule us for being led astray by the wrong
translation  <span id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) of a word, to
believe that he was born by the Holy Spirit, of whom the prophet asserts
no more than that he would be the son of a young woman. And, first, they
display an excessive eagerness for disputation, by laboring  <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) to prove that a word, which is
uniformly applied in Scripture to *virgins,* denotes here a young woman
who had known a man. The etymology too agrees with Matthew’s translation
of the word: for it means *hiding,*  <span
id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) which expresses the modesty that
becomes a virgin.  <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) They produce
a passage from the book of Proverbs, “the way of a man with a maids,”
<span id="ix.xv-p53.2"></span>בעלמה, (<span id="ix.xv-p53.3"></span>[Pr
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#019)<span id="ix.xv-p53.3"></span>..md)
But it does not at all support their views. Solomon speaks there of a
young woman who has obtained the affections of a young man: but it does
not follow as a matter of course, that the young man has seduced the
object of his regard; or rather, the probability leans much more
strongly to the other side.  <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)

<span id="ix.xv-p55"></span>But granting all that they ask as to the
meaning of the word, the subject demonstrates, and compels the
acknowledgment, that the prophet is speaking of a miraculous and
extraordinary birth. He exclaims that he is bringing a sign from the
Lord, and not an ordinary sign, but one superior to every other.

<span id="ix.xv-p56"></span>The Lord himself shall give you a sign.  
Behold, a virgin shall conceive,  
(<span id="ix.xv-p56.3"></span>[Isa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014)<span id="ix.xv-p56.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xv-p57"></span>If he were only to say, that a woman would
bear a child, how ridiculous would that magnificent preface have been?
Thus we see, that the insolence of the Jews exposes not only themselves,
but the sacred mysteries of God, to scorn.

<span id="ix.xv-p58"></span>Besides, a powerful argument may be drawn
from the whole strain of the passage. *Behold, a virgin shall conceive*
Why is no mention made of a man? It is because the prophet draws our
attention to something very uncommon. Again, the virgin is commanded to
name the child. *Thou shalt call his name Immanuel* In this respect,
also, the prophet expresses something extraordinary: for, though it is
frequently related in Scripture, that the names were given to children
by their mothers, yet it was done by the authority of the fathers. When
the prophet addresses his discourse to the virgin, he takes away from
men, in respect to this child, that authority which is conferred upon
them by the order of nature. Let this, therefore, be regarded as an
established truth, that the prophet here refers to a remarkable miracle
of God, and recommends it to the attentive and devout consideration of
all the godly, — a miracle which is basely profaned by the Jews, who
apply to the ordinary method of conception what is said in reference to
the secret power of the Spirit.

<span id="ix.xv-p59"></span><span id="ix.xv-p59.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xv-p60"></span>**23.** *His name Immanuel* The phrase, *God
is with us,* is no doubt frequently employed in Scripture to denote,
that he is present with us by his assistance and grace, and displays the
power of his hand in our defense. But here we are instructed as to the
*manner* in which God communicates with men. For out of Christ we are
alienated from him; but through Christ we are not only received into his
favor, but are made one with him. When Paul says, that the Jews under
the law *were nigh* to God, (<span id="ix.xv-p60.1"></span>[Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017)<span id="ix.xv-p60.1"></span>,.md)
and that a deadly *enmity* (<span id="ix.xv-p60.2"></span>[Eph
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#015)<span id="ix.xv-p60.2"></span>.md)
subsisted between him and the Gentiles, he means only that, by shadows
and figures, God then gave to the people whom he had adopted the tokens
of his presence. That promise was still in force, “The Lord thy God is
among you,” (<span id="ix.xv-p60.3"></span>[De
7:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#021)<span id="ix.xv-p60.3"></span>,.md)
and, “This is my rest for ever,” (<span id="ix.xv-p60.4"></span>[Ps
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014)<span id="ix.xv-p60.4"></span>..md)
But while the familiar intercourse between God and the people depended
on a Mediator, what had not yet fully taken place was shadowed out by
symbols. His seat and residence is placed “between the Cherubim,” (<span
id="ix.xv-p60.5"></span>[Ps 80:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa080.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.xv-p60.5"></span>,) because the ark was the figure and visible
pledge of his glory.

<span id="ix.xv-p61"></span>But in Christ the actual presence of God
with his people, and not, as before, his shadowy presence, has been
exhibited.  <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) This is the reason,
why Paul says, that “in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead
bodily,” (<span id="ix.xv-p62.2"></span>[Col
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#009)<span id="ix.xv-p62.2"></span>..md)
And certainly he would not be a properly qualified Mediator, if he did
not unite both natures in his person, and thus bring men into an
alliance with God. Nor is there any force in the objection, about which
the Jews make a good deal of noise, that the name of God is frequently
applied to those memorials, by which he testified that he was present
with believers.

<span id="ix.xv-p63"></span>For it cannot be denied, that this name,
*Immanuel,* contains an implied contrast between the presence of God, as
exhibited in Christ, with every other kind of presence, which was
manifested to the ancient people before his coming. If the reason of
this name began to be actually true, when Christ appeared in the flesh,
it follows that it was not completely, but only in part, that God was
formerly united with the Fathers.

<span id="ix.xv-p64"></span>Hence arises another proof, that Christ is
*God manifested in the flesh,* (<span id="ix.xv-p64.1"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)<span id="ix.xv-p64.1"></span>..md)
He discharged, indeed, the office of Mediator from the beginning of the
world; but as this depended wholly on the latest revelation, he is
justly called Immanuel at that time, when clothed, as it were, with a
new character, he appears in public as a Priest, to atone for the sins
of men by the sacrifice of his body, to reconcile them to the Father by
the price of his blood, and, in a word, to fulfill every part of the
salvation of men.  <span id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) The first
thing which we ought to consider in this name is the divine majesty of
Christ, so as to yield to him the reverence which is due to the only and
eternal God. But we must not, at the same time, forget the fruit which
God intended that we should collect and receive from this name. For
whenever we contemplate the one person of Christ as God-man, we ought to
hold it for certain that, if we are united to Christ by faith, we
possess God.

<span id="ix.xv-p66"></span>In the words, *they shall call,* there is a
change of the number. But this is not at all at variance with what I
have already said. True, the prophet addresses the virgin alone, and
therefore uses the second person, *Thou shalt call* But from the time
that this name was published, all the godly have an equal right to make
this confession, that God has given himself to us to be enjoyed in
Christ.  <span id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md)

<span id="ix.xv-p68"></span><span id="ix.xv-p68.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xv-p69"></span>**24.** *Joseph, being raised from sleep*
The ready performance, which is here described, serves not less to
attest the certainty of Joseph’s faith, than to commend his obedience.
For, if every scruple had not been removed, and his conscience fully
pacified, he would never have proceeded so cheerfully, on a sudden
change of opinion, *to take unto him his wife,* whose society, he lately
thought, would pollute him.  <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) The
dream must have carried some mark of Divinity, which did not allow his
mind to hesitate. Next followed the effect of faith. Having learned the
will of God, he instantly prepared himself to obey.

<span id="ix.xv-p71"></span><span id="ix.xv-p71.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xv-p72"></span>**25.** *And knew her not* This passage
afforded the pretext for great disturbances, which were introduced into
the Church, at a former period, by Helvidius. The inference he drew from
it was, that Mary remained a virgin no longer than till her first birth,
and that afterwards she had other children by her husband. Jerome, on
the other hand, earnestly and copiously defended Mary’s perpetual
virginity. Let us rest satisfied with this, that no just and
well-grounded inference can be drawn from these words of the Evangelist,
as to what took place after the birth of Christ. He is called
*first-born;* but it is for the sole purpose of informing us that he was
born of a virgin.  <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) It is said
that Joseph *knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born
son:* but this is limited to that very time. What took place afterwards,
the historian does not inform us. Such is well known to have been the
practice of the inspired writers. Certainly, no man will ever raise a
question on this subject, except from curiosity; and no man will
obstinately keep up the argument, except from an extreme fondness for
disputation.
