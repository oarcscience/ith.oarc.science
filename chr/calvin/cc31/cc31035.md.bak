<span id="ix.xxvii-p11"></span>**<span id="ix.xxvii-p11.2"></span>[Mark
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p11.2"></span>.** *The beginning of the Gospel.* Though
what we have hitherto taken out of Matthew and Luke is a part of *the
Gospel,* yet it is not without reason that Mark makes *the beginning of
the Gospel* to be the preaching of John the Baptist. For the Law and the
Prophets then came to an end, (<span id="ix.xxvii-p11.3"></span>[Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p11.3"></span>.) “*The Law and the Prophets were until
John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached*,” **(**<span
id="ix.xxvii-p11.4"></span>[Lu
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#016.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p11.4"></span>**.)** And with this agrees most fully the
quotation which he makes from the Prophet Malachi, (<span
id="ix.xxvii-p11.5"></span>[Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)<span id="ix.xxvii-p11.5"></span>..md)
In order to inflame the minds of his people with a stronger desire of
the promised salvation, the Lord had determined to leave them, for a
time, without new prophecies. We know that the last of the true and
lawful prophets was Malachi.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p12"></span>That the Jews, in the meantime, may not
faint with hunger, he exhorts them to continue under the Law of Moses,
until the promised redemption appear. He mentions *the law* only, (<span
id="ix.xxvii-p12.1"></span>[Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p12.1"></span>,) because the doctrine of the Prophets was
not separate from the law, but was merely an appendage and fuller
exposition of it, that the form of government in the Church might depend
entirely on the Law. It is no new or uncommon thing in Scripture, to
include the Prophets under the name of *the Law:* for they were all
related to it as their fountain or design. The Gospel was not an
inferior appendage to the Law, but a new form of instruction, by which
the former was set aside.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p13"></span>Malachi, distinguishing the two
conditions of the Church, places the one under the Law, and commences
the other with the preaching of John. He unquestionably describes the
Baptist, when he says, “Behold, I send my messenger,” (<span
id="ix.xxvii-p13.1"></span>[Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)<span id="ix.xxvii-p13.1"></span>:.md)
for, as we have already said, that passage lays down an express
distinction between the Law and the new order and condition of the
Church. With the same view he had said a little before, (which is quoted
by Mark, \[<span id="ix.xxvii-p13.2"></span>[Mr
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#013.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p13.2"></span>;\] for the passages are quite similar,)
“Behold, I send you Elijah the Prophet, before the coming of the great
and dreadful day of the Lord,” (<span id="ix.xxvii-p13.3"></span>[Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005)<span id="ix.xxvii-p13.3"></span>..md)
Again,

<span id="ix.xxvii-p14"></span>“Behold, I send my messenger, and he
shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall
suddenly come to his temple,” (<span id="ix.xxvii-p14.1"></span>[Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)<span id="ix.xxvii-p14.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xxvii-p15"></span>In both passages, the Lord promises a
better condition of his Church than had existed under the Law, and this
unquestionably points out *the beginning of the Gospel* But *before the
Lord came* to restore the Church, a forerunner or herald was to come,
and announce that he was at hand. Hence we infer, that the abrogation of
the Law, and *the beginning of the Gospel,* strictly speaking, took
place when John began to preach.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p16"></span>The Evangelist John presents to us Christ
clothed in flesh, “the Word made flesh,” (<span
id="ix.xxvii-p16.1"></span>[Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p16.1"></span>;) so that his birth and the whole history of
his appearance are included in the Gospel. But here Mark inquires, when
the Gospel began to be published, and, therefore, properly begins with
John, who was its first minister. And with this view the Heavenly Father
chose that the life of his Son should be buried, as it were, in silence,
until the time of the full revelation arrived. For it did not happen
without the undoubted Providence of God, that the Evangelists leave out
the whole period which Christ spent in private, and pass at once from
his earliest infancy to his thirtieth year, when he was openly exhibited
to the world, invested with his public character as a Redeemer; Luke
excepted, who slightly touches one indication of his future calling,
which occurred about his twelfth year, **(**<span
id="ix.xxvii-p16.2"></span>[Lu
2:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#042.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p16.2"></span>**.)**

<span id="ix.xxvii-p17"></span>It had a very close connection with this
object, that we should be informed, first, that Christ is a true man,
(<span id="ix.xxvii-p17.1"></span>[Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p17.1"></span>,) and next, that he is “*the Son of Abraham
and of David*,” **(**<span id="ix.xxvii-p17.2"></span>[Mt
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p17.2"></span>**;)** as to both of which, the Lord has been
pleased to give us an attestation. The other matters which we have
examined, relating to *“the shepherds*,” **(**<span
id="ix.xxvii-p17.3"></span>[Lu
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p17.3"></span>**,)** the *“Magi,”* **(**<span
id="ix.xxvii-p17.4"></span>[Mt
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p17.4"></span>**,)** and *“Simeon,”* **(**<span
id="ix.xxvii-p17.5"></span>[Lu
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p17.5"></span>**,)** were intended to prove his Divinity.
What Luke relates about John and his father Zacharias, **(**<span
id="ix.xxvii-p17.6"></span>[Lu
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p17.6"></span>**,)** was a sort of preparation for the
Gospel.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p18"></span>There is no impropriety in the change of
the person which is here made, in quoting the words of Malachi.
According to the prophet, God says, *I send my messenger, and he shall
prepare the way Before Me*. Mark introduces God as addressing the Son,
*Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way
Before Thee*. But we see that Mark had no other intention, than to
express more clearly the prophet’s meaning. Mark designates Christ *the
Son of God* The other Evangelists testify that he was born of the seed
of Abraham and David, and therefore was *the Son of man,* **(**<span
id="ix.xxvii-p18.1"></span>[Mt
8:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#020.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p18.1"></span>**.)** But Mark shows us, that no redemption
is to be expected but from *the Son of God*

<span id="ix.xxvii-p19"></span><span id="ix.xxvii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxvii-p20"></span>**<span
id="ix.xxvii-p20.2"></span>[Matthew
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.xxvii-p20.2"></span>**
*Now in those days* **<span id="ix.xxvii-p20.3"></span>[Luke
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p20.3"></span>.** *And in the fifteenth year* It could not
be gathered from Matthew and Mark in what year of his age John began to
preach: but Luke shows sufficiently, that he was about thirty years of
age. The ancient writers of the Church are almost unanimously agreed,
that he was born fifteen years before the death of Augustus. His
successor Tiberius had held the government of the Roman Empire for
fifteen years, when the same John began to preach. In this way are made
up the thirty years which I have mentioned. Hence it follows, that he
did not long discharge the office of teacher, but, in a short time, gave
way to Christ; for we shall soon find, that Christ also was baptized in
the thirtieth year of his age, when he was immediately installed into
the discharge of his public office. Now as John, the morning-star, or
dawn, was immediately followed by Christ, “the Sun of Righteousness,”
(<span id="ix.xxvii-p20.4"></span>[Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002)<span id="ix.xxvii-p20.4"></span>,.md)
there is no reason to wonder, that John disappeared, in order that
Christ might shine alone in greater brightness.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p21"></span><span id="ix.xxvii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxvii-p22"></span>**<span id="ix.xxvii-p22.2"></span>[Luke
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p22.2"></span>.** *When Pontius Pilate was governor of
Judea* It is probable that this was the second year of Pilate’s
government: for since Tiberius had held the reins of government, he had,
as Josephus informs us, (xviii. 2:2,) appointed Valerius Gratus to be
governor of Judea, in room of Annius Rufus. This change might take place
in his second year. The same Josephus writes, that Valerius was governor
of Judea for “eleven years, when Pontius Pilate came as his successor,”
(Ant. 18:2:2.) Pilate, therefore, had governed the province for two
years, when John began to preach the Gospel. This Herod, whom Luke makes
tetrarch of Judea, was the second heir of Herod the Great, and succeeded
to his father by will. Archelaus had received the ethnarchy of Judea,
but, when he was banished to Vienna (Jos. Wars, 2, vii. 3) by Augustus,
that portion fell into the hands of the Romans. Luke mentions here two
sons of Herod, — Herod Antipas, who had been made tetrarch of Galilee,
and governed Samaria and Peraea, — and Philip, who was tetrarch of
Trachonitis and Iturea, and reigned from the sea of Tiberias, or
Gennesareth, to the foot of Lebanon, which is the source of the river
Jordan.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p23"></span>Lysanias has been falsely supposed to be
the son of Ptolemy Mennaeus, King of Chalcis, who had been long before
put to death by Cleopatra, about thirty years before the birth of
Christ, as Josephus relates, (Ant. 15:4:1.) He could hardly even be the
grandson of Ptolemy, who, as the same Josephus records, kindled the
Parthian war, (Wars, 1, xiii. 1;) for then he must have been more than
sixty years of age at the time of which Luke speaks. Besides, as it was
under Antigonus that the Parthian war commenced, he must even then have
been a full-grown man. Now Ptolemy Mennaeus died not long after the
murder of Julius Caesar, during the triumvirate of Lepidus, Antony, and
Octavius, (Jos. Wars, 1, xiii. 1.) But as this grandson of Ptolemy bore
the name of Lysanias as well as his father, he might have left a son who
had the same surname. Meanwhile, there can be no hesitation in rejecting
the error of those who make Lysanias to live sixty years after he had
been slain by Cleopatra.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p24"></span>The word *Tetrarch* is here used in a
sense not quite accurate, as if the whole country had been divided into
four parts. But as at first there was a fourfold division into
districts, so afterwards, when other changes took place, the names
*Tetrarch* and *Tetrarchies* were retained by way of honor. In this
sense Pliny enumerates seventeen *tetrarchies* of one country.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p25"></span><span id="ix.xxvii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxvii-p26"></span>**<span id="ix.xxvii-p26.1"></span>[Luke
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#002.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p26.1"></span>.** *Annas and Caiaphas being the high
priests* It is certain, that there never were two persons who held the
office of *high priest* at the same time. Josephus states, that Valerius
Gratus made Caiaphas *high priest,* a short time before he left the
government. During the time that Pilate was governor of Judea, Josephus
does not speak of him as having made any change in this respect;  <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) but, on the contrary, states that,
when Pilate had been recalled from the government, and sent to plead his
cause at Rome, Vitellius, who was at that time governor of Syria,
reduced Caiaphas to a private rank, and transferred the high priesthood
to Jonathan, the son of Ananus, (Ant. 18:4:3.) When Luke says that there
were two *high priests,* we must not understand him to mean, that both
held the same title, but that the honor of the priesthood was partly
shared with him by Annas his father-in-law. Luke’s narrative indicates
such a state of trouble and confusion, that, though there was not more
than one person who was actually *high priest,* the sacred office was
torn in pieces by ambition and tyranny.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p28"></span>*The word of the Lord came upon John*
Before relating, as the other Evangelists do, that John began to
exercise his office of teaching, Luke asserts that he was divinely
called to that office: and he does so, in order to assure us, that the
ministry of John carried undoubted authority. Why the interpreters have
chosen to translate the word, <span id="ix.xxvii-p28.1"></span>ἐπὶ
᾿Ιωάννην, *UPON John,* instead of *TO John,* I do not see: but because
there is no ambiguity as to the meaning, that this commission was
entrusted to him, and that he received a command to preach, I have
followed the received version. Hence infer, that there are no regular
teachers, but those on whom God has conferred the office; and that it is
not enough to have the word of God, if there be not likewise a special
calling.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p29"></span>Matthew and Mark do not speak of the
preaching of John as extending beyond *the wilderness,* while Luke says,
that he *came into all the country around Jordan* These statements may
be reconciled by observing, that John discharged the office of teaching
among the neighbors, with whom he dwelt; but that his Gospel spread more
widely, and became known in many places, so that the report of it, in a
short time, reached Jerusalem. Indeed, the whole of that tract of the
Jordan might be called a *wilderness:* for the word does not mean “a
solitude,” but “a rough, and mountainous, and thinly inhabited
district.”

<span id="ix.xxvii-p30"></span><span id="ix.xxvii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxvii-p31"></span>**<span
id="ix.xxvii-p31.2"></span>[Matthew
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p31.2"></span>.** *Repent ye* Matthew differs from the
other two Evangelists in this respect, that he relates the substance of
John’s doctrine, as uttered by John himself, while they relate it in
their own words; though Mark has one word more than Luke: for he says,
*he came Baptizing, and preaching the baptism of repentance* But in
substance there is the most perfect agreement: for they all connect
*repentance* with *the forgiveness of sins.* The *kingdom of God* among
men is nothing else than a restoration to a happy life; or, in other
words, it is true and everlasting happiness. When John says, that *the
kingdom of God is at hand,* his meaning is, that men, who were alienated
from the righteousness of God, and banished from *the kingdom of
heaven,* must be again gathered to God, and live under his guidance.
This is accomplished by a free adoption and *the forgiveness of sins,*
by which he reconciles to himself those who were unworthy. In a word,
the kingdom of heaven is nothing else than “newness of life,” (<span
id="ix.xxvii-p31.3"></span>[Ro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)<span id="ix.xxvii-p31.3"></span>,.md)
by which God restores us to the hope of a blessed immortality. Having
rescued us from the bondage of sin and death, he claims us as his own;
that, even while our pilgrimage on earth continues, we may enjoy the
heavenly life by faith: for he

<span id="ix.xxvii-p32"></span>“hath blessed us with all spiritual
blessings in heavenly places in Christ,”  
(<span id="ix.xxvii-p32.2"></span>[Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003)<span id="ix.xxvii-p32.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xxvii-p33"></span>Though we are like dead men, yet we know
that our life is secure; for it “is hid with Christ in God,” (<span
id="ix.xxvii-p33.1"></span>[Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003)<span id="ix.xxvii-p33.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xxvii-p34"></span>From this doctrine, as its source, is
drawn the exhortation to *repentance.* For John does not say, “Repent
ye, and in this way *the kingdom of heaven* will afterwards be *at
hand;”* but first brings forward the grace of God, and then exhorts men
to *repent* Hence it is evident, that the foundation of repentance is
the mercy of God, by which he restores the lost. In no other sense is it
stated by Mark and Luke, that he *preached repentance for the
forgiveness of sins* Repentance is not placed first, as some ignorantly
suppose, as if it were the ground of the forgiveness of sins, or as if
it induced God to begin to be gracious to us; but men are commanded to
repent, that they may receive the reconciliation which is offered to
them. Now, as the undeserved love of God — by which he receives into his
favor wretched men, “not imputing their trespasses unto them,” (<span
id="ix.xxvii-p34.1"></span>[2Co
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019)<span id="ix.xxvii-p34.1"></span>.md)
— is first in order; so it must be observed, that pardon of sins is
bestowed upon us in Christ, not that God may treat them with indulgence,
but that he may heal us from our sins. And, indeed, without hatred of
sin and remorse for transgressions, no man will taste the grace of God.
But a definition of *repentance* and *faith* may explain more fully the
manner in which both are connected; which leads me to handle this
doctrine more sparingly.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p35"></span>With regard to the meaning of the present
passage, it is proper to observe, that the whole Gospel consists of two
parts, — *forgiveness of sins,* and *repentance* Now, as Matthew
denominates the first of these *the kingdom of heaven,* we may conclude,
that men are in a state of deadly enmity with God, and altogether shut
out from the heavenly kingdom, till God receives them into favor. Though
John, when he introduces the mention of the grace of God, exhorts men to
repentance, yet it must not be forgotten that repentance, not less than
the inheritance of the heavenly kingdom, is the gift of God. As he
freely pardons our sins, and delivers us, by his mercy, from the
condemnation of eternal death, so also does he form us anew to his
image, that we may live unto righteousness. As he freely adopts us for
his sons, so he regenerates us by his Spirit, that our life may testify,
that we do not falsely,  <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) address
him as our Father. In like manner, Christ washes away our sins by his
blood, and reconciles our Heavenly Father to us by the sacrifice of his
death; but, at the same time, in consequence of

<span id="ix.xxvii-p37"></span>“our old man being crucified with him,
and the body of sin destroyed,”  
(<span id="ix.xxvii-p37.2"></span>[Ro
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006)<span id="ix.xxvii-p37.2"></span>.md)

<span id="ix.xxvii-p38"></span>he makes us “alive” unto righteousness.
The sum of the Gospel is, that God, through his Son, takes away our
sins, and admits us to fellowship with him, that we, *“denying
ourselves*” and our own nature, may “live soberly, righteously, and
godly,” and thus may exercise ourselves on earth in meditating on the
heavenly life.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p39"></span><span id="ix.xxvii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxvii-p40"></span>**<span id="ix.xxvii-p40.2"></span>[Luke
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#003.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p40.2"></span>.** *Preaching the baptism of repentance*
This form of expression shows first, generally, what is the right use of
the Sacraments; and next, why *baptism* was instituted, and in what it
consists. A sacrament, then, is not a dumb ceremony, exhibiting some
unmeaning pomp without doctrine; but the Word of God is joined to it,
and gives life to the outward ceremony. By *the Word* I mean, not
mutterings of a magical character, made by some exorcist between his
teeth, but what is pronounced with a clear and distinct voice, and leads
to the edification of faith. For we are not simply told, that John
*baptized unto repentance,* as if the grace of God were contained in a
visible sign; but that he explained, in his preaching, the advantage of
baptism, that the sign, through the word preached, might produce its
effect. This is the peculiarity of baptism, that it is said to be an
outward representation of *repentance for the forgiveness of sins* Now,
as the meaning, power, and nature of that baptism are the same as ours,
if we judge of the figure from its true import, it is incorrect to say,
that the baptism of John is different from the baptism of Christ.  <span

wilderness* Though this passage of the prophet Isaiah (40:3) ought not
to be limited exclusively to John, yet he is one of the number of those
to whom it certainly refers. After having spoken of the destruction of
the city, and of the awful calamities that would befall the people, he
promises a restoration that would follow. His words are,

sacrifices abolished, and the people led away into captivity, their
affairs seemed to be desperate. And as their ears had been deaf to the
uninterrupted voice of the prophets, the Lord kept silence for a time.
 <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) That pious minds may not be
cast down during this melancholy silence, the prophet announces, that
other preachers of grace will yet arise, to awaken in the people a hope
of salvation. Such were Zechariah, Haggai, Malachi, and the like.  <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) But as the restoration promised is
perpetual, and not for a time only, and as Isaiah refers chiefly to the
redemption, which was to be expressed at the coming of Christ, John the
Baptist is justly considered the chief minister of consolation.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p48"></span>Next follows in the words of the prophet,
*The voice of one crying* That *voice* is contrasted with the temporary
silence,  <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) which I have just
mentioned: for the Jews were to be deprived, for a time, of the
instruction, which they had wickedly despised. The word *wilderness* is
here used metaphorically for *desolation,* or the frightful ruin of the
nation, such as existed in the time of the captivity. It was so dismally
shattered, that it might well be compared to a *wilderness* The prophet
magnifies the grace of God. “Though the people,” says he, “have been
driven far from their country, and even excluded from the society of
men, yet the voice of God will yet be heard in *the wilderness,* to
revive the dead with joyful consolation.” When John began to preach,
Jerusalem was in this sense a *wilderness:* for all had been reduced to
wild and frightful confusion. But the very sight of a visible
*wilderness* must have had a powerful effect on stupid and hardened men,
leading them to perceive that they were in a state of death, and to
accept the promise of salvation, which had been held out to them. We now
see, that this prediction actually relates to John, and is most properly
applied to him.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p50"></span>*Prepare the way of the Lord* The prophet
undoubtedly addresses Cyrus and the Persians, whose agency the Lord
employed in this matter. The meaning is: by his wonderful power, God
will open a way to his people through impassable forests, through broken
rocks, through a sandy desert; for he will have at hand the ministers of
his grace, to remove all hindrances out of the way. But that was a
shadowy anticipation of redemption. When the spiritual truth is about to
appear, John is sent to remove obstacles. And even now the same voice
sounds in our ears, that we may *prepare the way of the Lord:* that is,
that we may take out of the way those sins which obstruct the kingdom of
Christ, and thus may give access to his grace. To the same purpose are
the following words of the prophet: *the crooked shall be made
straight,* (<span id="ix.xxvii-p50.1"></span>[Isa
40:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#004.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p50.1"></span>.) All that they mean is: there are intricate
and crooked windings in the world, but through such appalling
difficulties the Lord makes a way for himself, and breaks through, by
incredible means, to accomplish our salvation.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p51"></span><span id="ix.xxvii-p51.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxvii-p52"></span>**<span id="ix.xxvii-p52.2"></span>[Luke
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#006.md)<span id="ix.xxvii-p52.2"></span>**
*And all flesh shall see the salvation of God* That salvation will not
be at all obscure, or experienced by a small number of persons, but will
strike every eye, and will be common to all. Hence it follows that this
prediction was far from being accomplished, when the people returned
from Babylon:  <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) for though the
Lord gave, at that time, a memorable display of his grace, yet he did
not reveal his *salvation* to the whole world. On the contrary, the
prophet’s design was, to present the uncommon excellence of the
salvation which was to be manifested, in contrast with God’s former
benefits, and thus to inform believers, that the dispensations of God
towards his Church had never been so remarkable, nor his power so
illustriously displayed in their deliverance. *Flesh* is here put for
*men,* without being intended to denote their depravity.  <span

id="ix.xxvii-p56.2"></span>[Matthew
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#004.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p56.2"></span>.** *And the same John had his raiment of
camel’s hair* The Evangelist does not desire us to reckon it as one of
John’s chief excellencies, that he followed a rough and austere way of
living, or even that he avoided a moderate and ordinary degree of
elegance: but, having already stated that he was an inhabitant of the
mountains, he now adds, that his food and clothing were adapted to his
residence. And he mentions this, not only to inform us, that John was
satisfied with the food and dress of the peasants, and partook of no
delicacies; but that, under a mean and contemptible garb, he was held in
high estimation by men of rank and splendor. Superstitious persons look
upon righteousness as consisting almost entirely of outward appearances,
and have commonly thought, that abstinence of this kind was the
perfection of holiness. Nearly akin to this is the error, of supposing
him to be a man who lived in solitude, and who disdained the ordinary
way of living; as the only superiority of hermits and monks is, that
they differ from other people. Nay*,* gross ignorance has gone so far
that, out of *camel’s hair* they have made an entire skin.

<span id="ix.xxvii-p57"></span>Now, there can be no doubt, that the
Evangelist here describes a man of the mountains,  <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) widely distant from all the refinement
and delicacies of towns,—not only satisfied with such food as could be
procured, but eating only what was fit to be used in its natural state,
such as *wild honey,* which is supplied by that region in great
abundance, and *locusts,* with which it also abounds. Or he may have
intended to point out that, when a man of mean aspect, and without any
polite accomplishments, appeared in public life, it was attended by this
advantage, that the majesty of God shone alone in him, and yet struck
all with admiration. For we must observe what is added, that there was a
great concourse of people from all directions; from which we infer, that
his fame was very widely spread.  <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) Or the Evangelist may have signified
the design of God, to present, in the person of John, a singular
instance of frugality, and, in this manner, to fill the Jews with
reverence for his doctrine, or at least to convince them of ingratitude,
according to that saying of our Lord, *John the Baptist came neither
eating bread nor drinking wine,* (<span id="ix.xxvii-p59.2"></span>[Lu
7:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#033.md)<span

<span id="ix.xxvii-p61.3"></span>[Mark
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#005.md)<span
id="ix.xxvii-p61.3"></span>.** *And were baptized, confessing their
sins* This *confession* was a testimony of *repentance:* for, as the
Lord, in the sacraments, brings himself under obligation to us, as if he
had given his own hand-writing, so it is our duty, on the other hand, to
reply to him. In *Baptism,* he declares that our sins are forgiven, and
calls us to repentance. That men may come forward, in a right manner, to
be baptized, *confession of sins* is demanded from them: otherwise the
whole performance would be nothing but an idle mockery  <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) Let it be observed, that we are here
speaking of adults, who ought not, we. are aware, to be admitted
indiscriminately into the Church, or introduced by Baptism into the body
of Christ,  <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) till an examination
has been previously made.  <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md)

<span id="ix.xxvii-p65"></span>Hence it is obvious, how absurdly this
passage has been tortured by the Papists, to support auricular
confession. There were no priests at hand, in whose ears each individual
might privately mutter  <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) his
sins; nor is it said that they enumerated all their sins; nor are we
told that John left in charge to his disciples an ordinary rule for
confession. Even granting to Papists all that they ask, confession will
belong to Catechumens alone,  <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md)
and will have no place after Baptism. At all events, the law which they
lay down for confession after Baptism, derives no countenance from
John’s example.  <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md)

<span id="ix.xxvii-p27"></span> The whole passage is remarkable, and
proves that the appointment to the sacred office of *high priest* was
entirely at the disposal of the Roman Governor. “This man (Valerius
Gratus) deprived Ananus of the high priesthood, and appointed Ishmael,
the son of Phabi, to be high priest. He also deprived him in a little
time, and ordained Eleazar, the son of Ananus, who had been high priest
before, to be high priest: which office, when he had held for a year,
Gratus deprived him of it, and gave the high priesthood to Simon, the
son of Camithus; and, when he had possessed that dignity no longer than
a year, Joseph Caiaphas was made his successor. When Gratus had done
those things, he went back to Rome, after he had tarried in Judea eleven
years, when Pontius Pilate came as his successor.” — (*Ant. 18:2:2.*)
