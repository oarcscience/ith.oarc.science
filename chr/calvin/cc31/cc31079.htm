<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p9"></A><b><a name="ix.lxxi-p9.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#005">Matthew 8:5</a><a name="ix.lxxi-p9.2"></A>.</b> <i>And when Jesus had entered</i> Those who think that Matthew and Luke give different narratives, are led into a mistake by a mere trifle. The only difference in the words is, that Matthew says that <i>the centurion came to him, </i>while Luke says that he sent some of the Jews to plead in his name. But there is no impropriety in Matthew saying, that the centurion did what was done in his name and at his request. There is such a perfect agreement between the two Evangelists in all the circumstances, that it is absurd to make two miracles instead of one.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p10"></A>The band of soldiers, which the centurion had under his command, was stationed, I have no doubt, in the town of Capernaum, in the same manner as garrisons were usually appointed for the protection of the towns. Though he perceived the morals of the people to be very vicious and depraved, (for we know that Capernaum, being on the seacoast, must have been more dissolute   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">499</FONT></A>
 			  than other towns,) yet this did not prevent him from condemning the superstitions of his country, and acquiring a taste for true and sincere piety. He had not built a synagogue for the Jews without exposing himself to some hatred and to some risk: and the only reason why <i>he loved that nation</i> was, that he had embraced the worship of one God. Before 			 Christ healed his servant, he had been healed by the Lord.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p12"></A>This was itself a miracle. One who belonged to the military profession, and who had crossed the sea with a band of soldiers, for the purpose of accustoming the Jews to endure the yoke of Roman tyranny, submits willingly, and yields obedience to the God of Israel. Luke says that this <i>servant was very dear to him;</i> and thus anticipates a doubt which might have arisen in the mind of the reader: for we know that slaves   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">500</FONT></A>
 			  were not held in such estimation, as to make their masters so solicitous about their life, unless by extraordinary industry, or fidelity, or some other virtue, they had secured their favor. By this statement Luke means, that this was not a low or ordinary slave, but a faithful servant, distinguished by many excellencies, and very highly esteemed by his master; and that this was the reason why he was so anxious about his life, and recommended him so earnestly. From 			 both Evangelists it is evident that it was a sudden palsy, which, from the first attack, took away all hope of life: for slow palsies are not attended by severe pain. Matthew says, that he was <i>grievously tormented, </i>and Luke, that he was <i>near death</i>  Both descriptions &#8212; pain or agony, and extreme danger &#8212; serve to enhance the glory of the miracle: and for this reason I am the more unwilling to hazard any absolute assertion as to the nature of the disease.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p14"></A><a name="ix.lxxi-p14.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p15"></A><b><a name="ix.lxxi-p15.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#005">Luke 7:5</a><a name="ix.lxxi-p15.2"></A>.</b> <i>For he loveth our nation</i>  This was, no doubt, a commendation given him by the Jews on account of his piety:   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_500"></A><A HREF="#fn_500"><FONT SIZE="1">501</FONT></A>
 			  for his <i>love of a nation </i>universally hated could proceed only from zeal for the Law, and from reverence for God. By <i>building a synagogue, </i>he showed plainly that he favored the doctrine of the Law. The Jews had therefore good grounds for saying that, as a devout worshipper of God, he had claims on Christ for receiving such a favor. They discover, at the same time, a 			 marvellous stupidity in admitting, by their own acknowledgment, that a Gentile possesses that grace of God which they despise and reject. If they consider Christ to be the minister and dispenser of the gifts of God, why do they not receive the grace offered to them before bringing foreigners to enjoy it? But hypocrites never fail to manifest such carelessness and presumption, as not to hesitate to look upon God as under some sort of obligations to them, and to dispose of his grace at their 			 pleasure, as if it were in their own power; and then, when they are satisfied with it, or rather because they do not deign to taste it, they treat it as useless, and leave it to others.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p17"></A><a name="ix.lxxi-p17.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p18"></A><b><a name="ix.lxxi-p18.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#008">Matthew 8:8</a><a name="ix.lxxi-p18.2"></A>.</b> <i>Lord, I do not deserve that thou shouldest come under my roof</i>  Matthew&#8217;s narrative is more concise, and represents the man as saying this; while Luke explains more fully, that this was a message sent by his friends: but 			 the meaning of both is the same. There are two leading points in this discourse. The centurion, sparing Christ by way of honoring him, requests that Christ will <i>not trouble himself, </i>because he reckons himself unworthy to receive a visit from him. The next point is, that he ascribes to Christ such power as to believe, that by the mere expression of his will, and by a word, his servant may recover and live. There was astonishing humility in 			 exalting so highly above himself a man who belonged to a conquered and enslaved nation. It is possible, too, that he had become accustomed to the haughty pretensions of the Jews, and, being a modest man, did not take it ill to be reckoned a heathen, and therefore feared that he would dishonor a Prophet of God, if he pressed him to enter the house of a polluted Gentile. However that may be, it is certain that he speaks sincerely, and entertains such reverence for Christ, that he does not venture 			 to invite him to his house, nay, as is afterwards stated by Luke, he reckoned himself unworthy to converse with him.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">502</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p20"></A>But it may be asked, what moved him to speak of Christ in such lofty terms? The difficulty is even increased by what immediately follows, <i>only say the word, and my servant will be healed,</i> or, as Luke has it, <i>say in a word: </i>for if he had not acknowledged Christ to be the Son of God, to transfer the glory of God to a man would have been superstition. It is difficult to believe, on the other hand, that he was properly informed about Christ&#8217;s divinity, of which almost all were at that time ignorant. Yet Christ finds no fault with his words,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">503</FONT></A>
 			  but declares that they proceeded from faith: and this reason has forced many expositors to conclude, that the centurion bestows on Christ the title of the true and only God. I rather think that the good man, having been informed about the uncommon and truly divine works of Christ, simply acknowledged in him the power of God. Something, too, he had undoubtedly heard about the promised Redeemer. Though he does not distinctly understand that Christ is <i>God manifested in the flesh,</i> (<a name="ix.lxxi-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016">1Ti 3:16</a><a name="ix.lxxi-p21.2"></A>,) yet he is convinced that the power of God is manifested in him, and that he has received a commission to display the presence of God by miracles. He is not therefore chargeable with superstition, as if he had ascribed to a man what is the prerogative of God: but, looking at 			 the commission which God had given to Christ, he believes that by a word alone he can heal his servant.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p22"></A>Is it objected, that nothing belongs more peculiarly to God than to accomplish by a word whatever he pleases, and that this supreme authority cannot without sacrilege be yielded to a mortal man? The reply is again easy. Though the centurion did not enter into those nice distinctions, he ascribed this power to the word, not of a mortal man, but of God, whose minister he fully believed Christ to be: on that point he entertained no doubt. The 			 grace of healing having been committed to Christ,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">504</FONT></A>
 			 he acknowledges that this is a heavenly power, and does not look upon it as inseparable from the bodily presence, but is satisfied with the word, from which he believes such a power to proceed.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p24"></A><a name="ix.lxxi-p24.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p25"></A><b><a name="ix.lxxi-p25.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#009">Matthew 8:9</a><a name="ix.lxxi-p25.2"></A>.</b> <i>For I am a man subject to the power of another</i>  This comparison does not imply equality between the two cases, but is taken from the less to the greater. He forms a higher conception of the divine power, which is 			 manifested in Christ, than of the authority which was possessed by himself over servants and soldiers.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p26"></A><a name="ix.lxxi-p26.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p27"></A><b>10. </b><i>Jesus wondered.</i> Wonder cannot apply to God, for it arises out of what is new and unexpected: but it might exist in Christ, for he had clothed himself with our flesh, and with human affections. <i>Not 			 even in Israel have I found so great faith</i>  This is not spoken absolutely, but in a particular point of view. For, if we consider all the properties of faith, we must conclude that the faith of Mary was greater, in believing that she would be with child by the Holy Ghost, and would bring forth the only-begotten Son of God, and in acknowledging the son whom she had borne to be her God, and the Creator of the 			 whole world, and her only Redeemer.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p28"></A>But there were chiefly two reasons why Christ preferred the faith of a Gentile to the faith of all the Jews. One was, that a slight and inconsiderable acquaintance with doctrine yielded so sudden and abundant fruit. It was no small matter to declare, in such lofty terms, the power of God, of which a few rays only were yet visible in Christ. Another reason was, that while the Jews were excessively eager to obtain outward signs, this Gentile 			 asks no visible sign, but openly declares that he wants nothing more than the bare word. Christ was going to him: not that it was necessary, but to try his faith; and he applauds his faith chiefly on the ground of his resting satisfied with the bare word. What would another have done, and he too one of the Apostles? Come, Lord, see and touch. This man asks no bodily approach or touch, but believes the word to possess such efficacy as fully to expect from it that his servant will be cured.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p29"></A>Now, he ascribes this honor to the word, not of a man, but of God: for he is convinced that Christ is not an ordinary man, but a prophet sent by God. And hence may be drawn a general rule. Though it was the will of God that our salvation should be accomplished in the flesh of Christ, and though he seals it daily by the sacraments, yet the certainty of it must be obtained from the word. Unless we yield such authority to the word, as to 			 believe that, as soon as God has spoken by his ministers, our sins are undoubtedly forgiven, and we are restored to life, all confidence of salvation is overthrown.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p30"></A><a name="ix.lxxi-p30.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p31"></A><b>11. </b><i>Many will come from the east and west</i>  In the person of the servant, Christ gave to the Gentiles a taste and a kind of first-fruits of his grace. He now shows, that the master is an example of the future calling of the Gentiles, and of the spread of faith throughout the whole 			 world: for he says that <i>they will come, </i>not only from the neighboring countries, but from the farthest bounds of the world. Though this had been clearly foretold by many passages of the prophets, it appeared at first strange and incredible to the Jews, who imagined that God was confined to the family of Abraham. It was not without astonishment that they heard, that those who were at that time strangers, would be citizens and heirs of the kingdom 			 of God: and not only so, but that the covenant of salvation would be immediately proclaimed, that the whole world might be united in one body of the Church. He declares, that the Gentiles, who shall come to the faith, will be partakers of the same salvation <i>with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</i>  Hence we draw the certain conclusion, that the same promise, which has been held out to us in Christ, was 			 formerly given to the fathers; for we would not have had an inheritance in common with them, if the faith, by which it is obtained, had not been the same. The word <a name="ix.lxxi-p31.1"></A>&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#955;&#953;&#952;&#8053;&#963;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953;, <i>shall recline, </i>contains an allusion to a banquet: but as we know, that the heavenly life does not require meat and drink, this phrase has the same meaning as if he had 			 said, <i>they shall enjoy the same life</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p32"></A><a name="ix.lxxi-p32.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p33"></A><b>12. </b><i>But the children of the kingdom</i>  Why does he call those persons <i>children of the kingdom, </i>who were nothing less than children of Abraham? for those who are aliens from the faith have no right to be considered 			 a part of God&#8217;s flock. I answer: Though they did not actually belong to the Church of God, yet, as they occupied a place in the Church, he allows them this designation. Besides, it ought to be observed that, so long as the covenant of God remained in the family of Abraham, there was such force in it, that the inheritance of the heavenly kingdom belonged peculiarly to them. With respect to God himself, at least, they were <i>holy branches from a holy root,</i> (<a name="ix.lxxi-p33.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016">Ro 11:16</a><a name="ix.lxxi-p33.2"></A>) and the rejection of them, which afterwards followed, shows plainly enough, that they belonged, at that time, to the family of God. Secondly, it ought to be observed, that Christ does not now speak of individuals, but of the whole nation. This was still harder to endure than the 			 calling of the Gentiles. That the Gentiles should be admitted, by a free adoption, into the same body with the posterity of Abraham, could scarcely be endured: but that the Jews themselves should be driven out, to make way for their being succeeded by the Gentiles, appeared to them altogether monstrous. Yet Christ declares that both will happen: that God will admit strangers into the bosom of Abraham, and that he will exclude <i>the children</i>  There is an implied contrast in the phrase, <i>the darkness that is without</i>  It means that out of the kingdom of God, which is the kingdom of light, nothing but darkness reigns. By <i>darkness </i>Scripture points out that dreadful anguish, which can neither be expressed nor conceived in this 			 life.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">505</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p35"></A><a name="ix.lxxi-p35.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.lxxi-p36"></A><b>13. </b><i>Go away, and as thou believest, so may it be to thee</i>  Hence it is evident how graciously Christ pours out his grace, when he finds the vessel of faith open. Though he addresses these words to the centurion, there can be no doubt that, in his person, he 			 invites us all to strong hope. Hence we are also taught the reason why God is, for the most part, so limited in his communications to us: it is because our unbelief does not permit him to be liberal. If we open up the entrance to him by faith, he will listen to our wishes and prayers.</p>
