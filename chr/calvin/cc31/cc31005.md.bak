<span id="vi-p1"></span>THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY

<span id="vi-p2"></span>TO THE OLD TRANSLATION

<span id="vi-p3"></span>To the right honorable

<span id="vi-p4"></span>FRANCIS, EARL OF BEDFORD,

<span id="vi-p5"></span>Of the noble order of the garter, knight,  
One of the lords of her majesty’s most hon. Privy council;  
Grace and peace from god, with the increase of that true  
Honor which is from god, and lasteth for ever.

<span id="vi-p6"></span>\[*Prefixed to the Original English Translation,
London,* 1584 *and* 1610.\]

<span id="vi-p7"></span>The choice (Right Honourable) which Luke the
Evangelist made in dedicating this History of the Gospel, which he
wrote, to that noble man Theophilus, and which that man of worthy
memory, M. John Calvin, took in dedicating these his labors to the Lords
of Frankfort, driveth me to dedicate this my small labor of translating
this book into the English tongue. And though it is but little that I
have done, in comparison of the labors of the other two, and not worth
the offering to men of great estate; yet, lest that I should seem
singular in dissenting from these two singular instruments in the Church
of God, and that in one and the selfsame book I have presumed to make
bold of your Lordship’s name, hoping that your Honor will not mislike to
have it written in the forehead of this book with noble Theophilus and
the Lords of Frankfort; specially, sith that I do it in testimony of my
dutiful love to you, for the manifold grace of God in you, and benefits
which I have received from you. Men do commonly, in their Epistles,
write either in the commendation of the work, or in the praise of their
patron, or in discharging of themselves of the discredit which their
enemies would lay upon them. But I crave pardon of your Honor, if, in
studying to be short, I omit these things.

<span id="vi-p8"></span>For, first, the very name of The Gospel of Jesus
Christ and then the names of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the Evangelists,
and of M. Calvin, the gatherer of The Harmony and the writer of The
Commentary, do yield more credit and commendation to the matter than all
that I can say of it, all the days of my life. Only this I say of M.
Calvin’s labors here, that in my simple judgment it is one of the
profitablest works for the Church that ever he did write.

<span id="vi-p9"></span>Next, for your praises, as you like not to hear
them, so I will not offend you in setting them down, nor give others
occasion to condemn me of flattery. They which have best known you say,
that you began a good course in your youth; that you witnessed a good
confession in the late time of persecution; that your constancy hath
been testified by your troubles at home and travels in foreign
countries: You have continued your profession in the midst of your
dignity, lordships, and living, left by your parents, and in the seat of
government wherein our sovereign and most gracious Queen hath placed
you; not falling asleep, in security, in this so peaceable a time.

<span id="vi-p10"></span>My Lord, continue to the end, so shall you be
safe. I speak not this as if it were your own strength that hath holden
you up all this while; but meditate sometimes, I pray you, upon the
seventy-first Psalm; and pray that Lord, as David did, who kept you in
your youth, that He will keep you in your old age, now that your hair is
hoar and hairs grey. And I beseech the mighty Lord to thrust them
forward which are drawn back by their youthly affections, and to raise
up them that fell away for fear of troubles, and to waken those which in
this quiet and calm time do sleep in security, or wax wanton with the
wealth of the world; that we may meet the Lord with true humility and
earnest repentance, to see if He will be intreated to continue His
mercies towards us; lest he turn his correcting rod, which he hath so
oft shaken over us, into a devouting sword to consume us.

<span id="vi-p11"></span>Of myself I will say nothing. The mouths of the
wicked cannot be stopped. Their false tongues, I hope, shall teach me to
walk warily; and I have learned, I thank my God, to pass through good
report and through evil, and to commit myself and my cause to Him that
judgeth right.

<span id="vi-p12"></span>The Lord of lords preserve your Honour in
safety, and multiply all spiritual blessings upon you and yours. From
Kiltehampton, in Cornwall, this 28th of, January, 1584.

<span id="vi-p13"></span>The Lord’s most unworthy Minister, lame

<span id="vi-p14"></span>Eusebius Paget
