<span id="ix.xxv-p6"></span> 

<span id="ix.xxv-p7"></span><span id="ix.xxv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxv-p8"></span>**40.** *And the child grew* From the
infancy of Christ Matthew passes immediately to his manifestation.
 <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) Luke relates here a single
fact, which well deserved to be recorded. In the midst of his boyhood,
Christ gave a specimen of his future office, or at least indicated, by a
single attempt, what he would afterwards be. *The child grew, and was
invigorated in spirit* These words show, that the endowments of his mind
grew with his age.  <span id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) Hence we
infer, that this progress, or advancement, relates to his human nature:
for the Divine nature could receive no increase.

<span id="ix.xxv-p11"></span>But a question arises. From the time that
he was conceived in his mother’s womb, did he not abound in all fullness
of spiritual gifts? for it appears absurd to say, that the Son of God
wanted any thing that was necessary to perfection. The reply is easy. If
it takes nothing from his glory, that he was altogether, “emptied,”
*(*<span id="ix.xxv-p11.1"></span>ἑαυτὸν ἐκένωσε*,* <span
id="ix.xxv-p11.2"></span>[Php 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md)<span
id="ix.xxv-p11.2"></span>,) neither does it degrade him, that he chose
not only to grow in body, but to make progress in mind. And certainly
when the Apostle declares, that, “in all things he was made like unto
his brethren,”(<span id="ix.xxv-p11.3"></span>[Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017)<span id="ix.xxv-p11.3"></span>,.md)
and “was in all points tempted like as we are, sin excepted,” (<span
id="ix.xxv-p11.4"></span>[Heb
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015)<span id="ix.xxv-p11.4"></span>,.md)
he no doubt includes, that his soul was subject to ignorance. There is
only this difference between us and him, that the weaknesses which press
upon us, by a necessity which we cannot avoid, were undertaken by him
voluntarily, and of his own accord. Christ received, in his human
nature, according to his age and capacity, an increase of the free gifts
of the Spirit,  <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) that “out of his
fullness” (<span id="ix.xxv-p12.2"></span>[Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016)<span id="ix.xxv-p12.2"></span>.md)
he may pour them out upon us; for we draw grace out of his grace.

<span id="ix.xxv-p13"></span>Some excessively timid persons restrict
what is here said to outward appearance, and make the meaning to be,
that Christ appeared to make progress, though, in point of fact, no
addition was made to his knowledge. But the words have a quite different
meaning, and this mistaken opinion is still more fully refuted by what
Luke shortly afterwards adds, that *he grew in age and wisdom with God
and man,* (<span id="ix.xxv-p13.1"></span>[Lu
2:52](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052)<span id="ix.xxv-p13.1"></span>..md)
We are not at liberty to suppose, that knowledge lay concealed in
Christ, and made its appearance in him in progress of time. There is no
doubt whatever, that it was the design of God to express in plain terms,
how truly and completely Christ, in taking upon him our flesh, did all
that was necessary to effect his brotherly union with men.  <span
id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md)

<span id="ix.xxv-p15"></span>And yet we do not in this way suppose a
double Christ:  <span id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) for, though
*God* and *man* are united in one person, it does not follow, that the
human nature received what was peculiar to the Divine nature: but*,* so
far as was necessary for our salvation, the Son of God kept his divine
power concealed. What Irenaeus says, that his Divine nature was
quiescent when he suffered,  <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) I
understand to refer, not only to bodily death, but to that amazing
distress and agony of soul, which drew from him the complaint, “*My God,
my God, why hast thou forsaken me?”* (<span id="ix.xxv-p17.2"></span>[Mt
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046)<span id="ix.xxv-p17.2"></span>..md)
In a word, if we do not choose to deny, that Christ was made a real man,
we ought not to be ashamed to acknowledge, that he voluntarily took upon
him everything that is inseparable from human nature.

<span id="ix.xxv-p18"></span>It is a foolish objection, that ignorance
does not apply to Christ, because it is the punishment of sin: for the
same thing might be said of death. Scripture declares, on the contrary,
that he performed the office of Mediator: for all the punishment which
we deserved was transferred from us to him.  <span
id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) Besides, it is a foolish mistake to
say, that ignorance is the punishment of sin. For we must not suppose
that Adam, while he remained in innocence, knew all things. Angels also
are, to some extent, ignorant, and yet they do not endure the punishment
of sin.

<span id="ix.xxv-p20"></span>A more refined argument is employed by
some, that there was no ignorance in Christ, because ignorance is sin.
But those persons assume a principle which is altogether false and
groundless: otherwise, the angels must either be equal to God, or they
must be sinful.  <span id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) There is no
doubt a sinful blindness of the human mind, which is justly reckoned a
part of original sin: but here we ascribe to Christ no other ignorance
than what may fall upon a man who is pure from every taint of sin.

<span id="ix.xxv-p22"></span>*He was invigorated in spirit, and was full
of wisdom* Luke thus declares, that whatever wisdom exists among men,
and receives daily accessions, flows from that single fountain, from the
Spirit of God. The following phrase is more general, *and the grace of
God was upon him:* for it includes all the excellence of every
description that shone brightly in Christ.

<span id="ix.xxv-p23"></span><span id="ix.xxv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxv-p24"></span>**41.** *And his parents went every year to
Jerusalem* It is mentioned in commendation of the piety of Mary and
Joseph, that they gave diligent attendance to the outward worship of
God. It was not of their own accord, but by a divine command, that they
undertook this annual journey. The law enjoins the, males “only to,
appear before the Lord,” (<span id="ix.xxv-p24.1"></span>[Ex
23:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#017)<span id="ix.xxv-p24.1"></span>..md)
This arrangement does not entirely exclude females, but spares them by
an exercise of kindness. This mark distinguishes the true religion from
vain and wicked superstitions. The former confines itself within the
limits of obedience to God, and of compliance with the enactments of his
law. The latter wander, at their own pleasure, beyond the limits of
God’s word, without any fixed rule. The worship of the temple was, no
doubt, infected with many corruptions, the priesthood was sold for
money, and doctrine was involved in many errors. Yet, as legal
ceremonies were still in force, and the outward rite of sacrifice was
observed as it is laid down in the law, believers were bound to perform
such exercises in testimony of their faith. The name *father* is here
given to Joseph, not with strict accuracy, but according to the opinion
generally entertained respecting him.

<span id="ix.xxv-p25"></span><span id="ix.xxv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxv-p26"></span>**44.** *And thinking that he was in the
company* Many passages of Scripture show plainly, that those who came
from a distance, at the festivals, to worship in the temple, were
accustomed to travel in *companies.* There is no reason, therefore, to
wonder that, on the first day, Joseph and Mary were less anxious about
the child; and their subsequent conduct shows that this was not owing to
indolence or carelessness.

<span id="ix.xxv-p27"></span><span id="ix.xxv-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxv-p28"></span>**46.** *Sitting in the midst of the
doctors* Rays of divine brightness must have evidently shone in this
child: otherwise those haughty men would not have permitted him to sit
along with them. Though it is probable that he occupied a lower seat,
and not the rank of the doctors, yet such disdainful men would not have
condescended to give him an audience in a public assembly, if some
divine power had not constrained them. This was a sort of prelude to his
public calling, the full time of which had not yet arrived. In this way,
however, he intended to give nothing more than a taste, which would
immediately have faded from the recollection of men, had not Mary *kept*
it for us *laid up in her heart,* (<span id="ix.xxv-p28.1"></span>[Luke
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#019.md),
[51](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#051)<span id="ix.xxv-p28.1"></span>,.md)
to bring it out afterwards, along with other treasures, for the use of
all the godly.

<span id="ix.xxv-p29"></span><span id="ix.xxv-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxv-p30"></span>**47.** *And all who heard him* Two things
here claim our attention. *All who heard him were astonished:* for they
reckoned it a miracle, that a child should frame his questions with such
correctness and propriety. Again, they *heard* Christ, and thus acted
the part rather of scholars than of teachers. He had not yet been called
by the Father, to avow himself a public teacher of the Church, and
therefore satisfied himself with putting modest questions to the
doctors. Yet there is no room to doubt that, in this first attempt, he
already began to tax their perverse way of teaching: for what Luke
afterwards says about *answers,* I consider as denoting, agreeably to
the Hebrew idiom, any kind of discourse.
