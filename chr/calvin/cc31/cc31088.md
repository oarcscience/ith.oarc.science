<span id="ix.lxxx-p3"></span>**35**.** **And Jesus went about all the
cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the
gospel of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every sickness among
the people. **36**.** **And when he saw the multitudes, he was moved
with compassion towards them, because they were destitute and scattered,
as sheep not having a shepherd. **37**.** **Then he saith to his
disciples, The harvest is indeed abundant, but the laborers are few.
**38**.** **Pray therefore to the Lord of the harvest, to send forth
laborers into his harvest.

*And Jesus went about* This statement is made by way of anticipating an
objection, and is intended to inform us that the whole ministry of
Christ is not minutely described: for he was constantly employed in the
discharge of his office; that is, in proclaiming the doctrine of
salvation, and in confirming it by the addition of miracles. *The gospel
of the kingdom,* we have already said, is a designation given to it from
its effect,  <span id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md) for in this way God
gathered to himself a people sadly scattered, that he might *reign* in
the midst of them; and, indeed, he erected his throne for the express
purpose of bestowing on all his people perfect happiness. Yet let us
remember that we must be subject to God, in order that we may be exalted
by him to the heavenly glory.

<span id="ix.lxxx-p8"></span><span id="ix.lxxx-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxx-p9"></span>**36.** *He was moved with compassion
towards them* Hence we infer, first, how great was the indolence of the
priests, who, though they were scattered over the whole country, in
order to enlighten the people with heavenly doctrine, were
*slow-bellies,* (<span id="ix.lxxx-p9.1"></span>Titus 1:12.) True, they
boasted that they were superintendents of the people; and the number of
those who gloried in that title was not small. Yet not one of them does
Christ own to be a pastor. A similar confusion may now be observed in
Popery, though it is full of persons who are called pastors: for there
is a prodigious crowd of those who under the name of clergy, eat up the
flock. They are *dumb dogs,* (<span id="ix.lxxx-p9.2"></span>[Isa
56:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa056.htm#010)<span id="ix.lxxx-p9.2"></span>,.md)
and yet are not ashamed to make a vehement sound about their hierarchy.
But we must listen to the voice of Christ, who declares, that where
there are no *laborers* there are no shepherds, and that those sheep are
wandering and scattered which are not collected into the fold of God by
the doctrine of the gospel. His being *moved with compassion* proves him
to be the faithful servant of the Father in promoting the salvation of
his people, for whose sake he had clothed himself with our flesh. Now
that he has been received into heaven, he does not retain the same
feelings to which he chose to be liable in this mortal life: yet he has
not left off the care of his church, but looks after his wandering
sheep, or rather, he gathers his flock which had been cruelly chased and
torn by the wolves.

<span id="ix.lxxx-p10"></span><span id="ix.lxxx-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxx-p11"></span>**37.** *The harvest is indeed abundant*
By this metaphor he intimates, that many of the people are ripe for
receiving the gospel. Though the greater number afterwards rejected
basely and with vile ingratitude the salvation offered to them, yet the
limited number of the elect, who were mixed with unbelievers, is
compared to an *abundant harvest,* because God values a small band of
his own people more highly than the rest of the world. Though there were
at that time many who assumed this character, yet as few of them
discharged it faithfully, he does not rank them among *laborers:* for he
employs the word *laborers* in a good sense. When Paul complains (<span
id="ix.lxxx-p11.2"></span>[2Co
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013)<span id="ix.lxxx-p11.2"></span>.md)
of bad *laborers,* he refers to their boasting: for he would not have
bestowed the designation of *laborers*  <span
id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) on those who devoted all their
exertions to ruin and waste the flock, had it not been that they gloried
in the false pretense.

<span id="ix.lxxx-p13"></span><span id="ix.lxxx-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxx-p14"></span>**38.** *Pray therefore to the Lord of the
harvest* As no man will of himself become a sincere and faithful
minister of the gospel, and as none discharge in a proper manner the
office of teacher but those whom the Lord raises up and endows with the
gifts of his Spirit, whenever we observe a scarcity of pastors, we must
raise our eyes to him to afford the remedy. There never was greater
necessity for offering this prayer than during the fearful desolation of
the church which we now see every where around us.
