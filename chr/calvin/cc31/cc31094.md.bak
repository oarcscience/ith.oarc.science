<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p2"></span><span id="ix.lxxxvi-p2.1"></span>[Matthew

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p4"></span>**21**.** **And the brother will deliver
up the brother to death, and the father the son, and the children will
rise up against the parents, and will put them to death. **22**.** **And
you will be hated by all on account of my name: but he who shall endure
to the end  <span id="fr_587"></span>[588](#fn_587.md) will be saved.
**23**.** **And when they shall persecute you in this city, flee into
another: for verily I say unto you, You will not have gone over  <span
id="fr_588"></span>[589](#fn_588.md) all the cities of Israel, till the Son
of man bec ome. **24**.** **The disciple is not above his master, nor
the servant above his lord. **25**.** **It is enough for the disciple
that he be as his master, and that the servant be as his lord: if they
have called the master of the house himself Beelzebub, how much more his
household servants?

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p7"></span>**40**.** **The disciple is not above his
master, but every one shall be to his master.

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p8"></span> 

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p9"></span><span id="ix.lxxxvi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p10"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p10.1"></span>[Matthew
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#021.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p10.1"></span>.** *And the brother will deliver up the
brother to death.* He first gives warning what heavy calamities await
them, and then adds a remarkable consideration, which sweetens all their
bitterness. First, he announces that those circumstances which other men
find to be the means of protection, or from which they obtain some
relief, will prove to the disciples a fresh addition to their misery.
*Brothers,* who ought to assist them when oppressed, to stretch out
their hand to them amidst their distresses, and to watch over their
safety, will be their mortal enemies.

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p11"></span>It is a mistake however, to suppose that
it happens to none but believers to be *delivered up to death by their
brethren:* for it is possible that a father may pursue his son with holy
zeal,  <span id="fr_589"></span>[590](#fn_589.md) if he perceives him to
have apostatized from the true worship of God; nay, the Lord enjoins us
in such a case (<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p12.2"></span>[De
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#009.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p12.2"></span>) to forget flesh and blood, and to bestow
all our care on vindicating the glory of his name.  <span
id="fr_590"></span>[591](#fn_590.md) Whoever has fear and reverence for God
will not spare his own relatives, but will rather choose that all of
them should perish, if it be found necessary, than that the kingdom of
Christ should be scattered, the doctrine of salvation extinguished, and
the worship of God abolished. If our affections were properly regulated,
there would be no other cause of just hatred among us.

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p14"></span>On the other hand, as Christ not only
restores the kingdom of God, and raises godliness to its full vigor, but
even brings men back from ruin to salvation, nothing can be more
unreasonable than that the ministers of so lovely a doctrine should be
hated on his account. A thing so monstrous, and so contrary to nature,
might greatly distress the minds of simple men:  <span
id="fr_591"></span>[592](#fn_591.md) but Christ foretells that it will
actually take place.

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p16"></span><span id="ix.lxxxvi-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p17"></span>**22.** *But he who endured to the end
shall be saved* This single promise ought sufficiently to support the
minds of the godly, though the whole world should rise against them: for
they are assured that the result will be prosperous and happy. If those
who fight under earthly commanders, and are uncertain as to the issue of
the battle, are carried forward even to death by steadiness of purpose,
shall those who are certain of victory hesitate to abide by the cause of
Christ to the very last?

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p18"></span><span id="ix.lxxxvi-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p19"></span>**23.** *And when they shall persecute
you.* He anticipates an objection that might arise. If we must encounter
the resentments of the whole world, what shall be the end of all this?
 <span id="fr_592"></span>[593](#fn_592.md) Though it may not be safe for
them to remain in any place, yet Christ warns them not to despair, but,
on the contrary, when they have been driven from one place, to try
whether their labors in some other place may be of any avail. It is a
mistake, however, to suppose that this is a bare permission: for it is
rather a command given to the disciples, what it is the will of Christ
that they should do. He who has sustained one persecution would
willingly withdraw as a soldier who has served his time. But no such
exemption is granted to the followers of Christ, who commands them to
fulfill their whole course with unabated zeal. In short, the apostles
are enjoined to enter into fresh contests, and not to imagine that, when
they have succeeded in one or two cases, they have fully discharged
their duty. No permission is granted to them to flee to a retired spot,
where they may remain unemployed, but though their labor may have been
unsuccessful in one place, the Lord exhorts them to persevere.

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p21"></span>And yet the command implies also a
permission. As to avoiding persecution, it ought to be understood in
this manner: we must not condemn without distinction all who flee, and
yet it is not every kind of flight that is lawful. Some of the ancients
carried their zeal in this matter to an extreme and condemned flight as
a species of disavowal. Were this true, some part of the disgrace would
fall on Christ and his apostles. Again, if all without distinction are
at liberty to flee, a good pastor could not be distinguished from a
hireling during a season of persecution. We must abide by the moderation
which Augustine recommends, when writing to Honoratus: No man must quit
his station through timidity, either by betraying the flock through
cowardice, or by giving an example of slothfulness; and yet no man must
expose himself precipitately, or at random. If a whole church is
attacked, or if a part of them is pursued to death, the pastor, whose
duty it is to expose his life in place of any individual among them,
would do wrong in withdrawing. But sometimes it may happen, that by his
absence he will quell the rage of enemies, and thus promote the
advantage of the church. In such cases, the *harmlessness of the dove*
must be his guide, that effeminate persons may not seize on his conduct
as an excuse for their timidity: for the flesh is always too ingenious
in avoiding what is troublesome.

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p22"></span>*For verily I say to you.* These words
cannot be understood in the sense which some have given to them as
relating to the first mission,  <span id="fr_593"></span>[594](#fn_593.md)
but embrace the whole course of their apostleship. But the difficulty
lies in ascertaining what is meant by the *coming of the Son of man*
Some explain it as denoting such a progress of the gospel, as may enable
all to acknowledge that Christ is truly reigning, and that he may be
expected to restore the kingdom of David. Others refer it to the
destruction of Jerusalem, in which Christ appeared taking vengeance on
the ingratitude of the nation. The former exposition is admissible: the
latter is too far-fetched. I look upon the consolation here given as
addressed peculiarly to the apostles. Christ is said *to come,* when
matters are desperate, and he grants relief. The commission which they
received was almost boundless: it was to spread the doctrine of the
Gospel through the whole world. Christ promises that he will *come*
before they have traveled through the whole of Judea: that is, by the
power of his Spirit, he will shed around his reign such luster, that the
apostles will be enabled to discern that glory and majesty which they
had hitherto been unable to discover.

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p24"></span><span id="ix.lxxxvi-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p25"></span>**24.** *The disciple is not above his
master* By his own example he now exhorts them to perseverance; and,
indeed, this consolation is enough to banish all sadness, if we consider
that our lot is shared with the Son of God. To make us feel deeper
shame, he borrows a twofold comparison from what is customary among men.
*The disciple* reckons it honorable to be placed on a level with *his
master,* and does not venture to wish a higher honor, and again,
*servants* do not refuse to share that condition to which their
*masters* willingly submit. In both respects, the Son of God is far
above us: for the Father has given to him the highest authority, and has
bestowed on him the office of a teacher. We ought, therefore, to be
ashamed of declining what he did not scruple to undergo on our account.
But there is more need to meditate on these words than to explain them:
for, in themselves, they are sufficiently clear.

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p26"></span><span id="ix.lxxxvi-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p27"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p27.2"></span>[Luke
6:40](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#040.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p27.2"></span>.** *The disciple is not above his master,
but every one shall be conformed to his master* Luke gives this sentence
without any connection, as if it had been spoken abruptly in the midst
of other discourses; but as Matthew explains very clearly, in this
passage, to what it relates, I have chosen not to insert it in any other
place. With respect to the translation, I have chosen neither to follow
Erasmus nor the old translator, and for the following reason: — The
participle <span id="ix.lxxxvi-p27.3"></span>κατηρτισμένος, signifies
*perfect,* but signifies also *fit and suitable* Now, as Christ is
speaking, not about perfection, but about resemblance, and must
therefore mean, that nothing is more *suitable* for a *disciple* than to
be formed after the example of his *master,* the latter meaning appeared
to me to be more appropriate.

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p28"></span><span id="ix.lxxxvi-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p29"></span>**25.** *If they have called the master
of the house Beelzebub* This is equivalent to calling himself Lord of
the Church, as the apostle, when comparing him to Moses and the
prophets, (<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p29.3"></span>[Heb
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p29.3"></span>,) says, that they were *servants,* but that
he is the Son and heir. Though he bestows on them the honor of *calling
them brethren,* (<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p29.4"></span>[Heb
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#011.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p29.4"></span>,) yet he is *the first-born* (<span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p29.5"></span>[Ro
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p29.5"></span>) and head of the whole church; and, in
short, he possesses supreme government and power. Nothing, therefore,
can be more unreasonable than to wish to be accounted believers, and yet
to murmur against God when he *conforms us to the image of his Son,*
whom he has placed over all his family. To what sort of delicacy do we
pretend, if we wish to hold a place in his house, and to be above the
Lord himself? The general meaning is, that we carry our delicacy and
tenderness to excess, if we account it a hardship to endure reproaches
to which our Prince willingly submitted.

<span id="ix.lxxxvi-p30"></span>*Beelzebub* is a corrupted term, and
would have been more correctly written *Baalzebub*. This was the name
given to the chief of the false gods of the Philistines, who was
worshipped by the inhabitants of Ekron, (<span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p30.1"></span>[2Ki
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002.md)<span
id="ix.lxxxvi-p30.1"></span>.) *Baalim* was the name of the inferior
deities, whom the Papists of our day call *patrons*. Now, as Baalzebub
means *the patron of the fly,* or *of the flies,* some have thought that
he was so called on account of the great multitude of *flies* in the
temple, occasioned by the number of sacrifices; but I rather conjecture
that the assistance of the idol was implored against *the flies* which
infested that place. When Ahazlah, under the influence of superstition,
applied to him to be informed about his recovery, he gave him this name,
which would appear from that circumstance not to be a term of reproach.
But as the name *gehenna* was applied by holy men to hell, in order to
stamp that place with infamy, so, in order to express their hatred and
detestation of the idol, they gave the name *Beelzebub* to the devil.
Hence we infer that wicked men, for the purpose of rendering Christ
detestable to the multitude, employed the most reproachful term which
they could invent, by calling him *the devil,* or, in other words, the
greatest enemy of religion. If we happen to be assailed by the same kind
of reproach, we ought not to think it strange, that what began in the
head should be completed in the members.
