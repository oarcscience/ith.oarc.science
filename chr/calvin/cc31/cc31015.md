<span id="ix.vii-p1"></span>LUKE 1:34-38

<span id="ix.vii-p2"></span><span id="ix.vii-p2.1"></span>[Luke
1:34-38](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#034.md)<span id="ix.vii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p3"></span>**34**.** **And Mary said to the angel, How
shall this be, since I know not a man? **35**.** **And the angel
answering said to her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy
thing which shall be born shall be called the Son of God.
**36**.** **And, behold, Elisabeth thy cousin, even she hath conceived a
son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her who was called
barren: **37**.** **For no word shall be impossible with God.
**38**.** **And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto
me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.

<span id="ix.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.vii-p5"></span><span id="ix.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p6"></span>**34.** *How shall this be?* The holy virgin
appears to confine the power of God within as narrow limits as Zacharias
had formerly done; for what is beyond the common order of nature, she
concludes to be impossible. She reasons in this manner. *I know not a
man:* how then can I believe that what you tell me will happen? We ought
not to give ourselves very much trouble,  <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) to acquit her of all blame. She ought
immediately to have risen by faith to the boundless power of God, which
is not at all lettered to natural means, but sways the whole world.
Instead of this, she stops at the ordinary way of generation. Still, it
must be admitted that she does not hesitate or inquire in such a manner
as to lower the power of God to the level of her senses; but is only
carried away by a sudden impulse of astonishment to put this question.
That she readily embraced the promise may be concluded from this, that,
though many things presented themselves on the opposite side, she has no
doubt but on one point.

<span id="ix.vii-p8"></span>She might instantly have objected, where was
that *throne of David?* for all the rank of kingly power had been long
ago set aside, and all the luster of royal descent had been
extinguished. Unquestionably, if she had formed her opinion of the
matter according to the judgment of the flesh, she would have treated as
a fable what the angel had told her. There can be no doubt that she was
fully convinced of the restoration of the church, and easily gave way to
what the flesh would have pronounced to be incredible. And then it is
probable that the attention of the public was everywhere directed at
that time to the prediction of Isaiah, in which God promises that he
would raise up a rod out of the despised stem of Jesse, (<span
id="ix.vii-p8.1"></span>[Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.vii-p8.1"></span>.) That persuasion of the kindness of God, which
had been formed in the mind of the virgin, led her to admit, in the
fullest manner, that she had received a message as to raising up anew
the throne of David. If it be objected that there was also another
prediction, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, (<span
id="ix.vii-p8.2"></span>[Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md)<span
id="ix.vii-p8.2"></span>,) I reply, that this mystery was then very
imperfectly understood. True, the Fathers expected the birth of a King,
under whose reign the people of God would be happy and prosperous; but
the manner of its accomplishment lay concealed*,* as if it had been
hidden by a veil. There is no wonder, therefore, if the holy virgin puts
a question on a subject hitherto unknown to her.

<span id="ix.vii-p9"></span>The conjecture which some have drawn from
these words, that she had formed a vow of perpetual virginity, is
unfounded and altogether absurd. She would, in that case, have committed
treachery by allowing herself to be united to a husband, and would have
poured contempt on the holy covenant of marriage; which could not have
been done without mockery of God. Although the Papists have exercised
barbarous tyranny on this subject, yet they have never proceeded so far
as to allow the wife to form a vow of continence at her own pleasure.
Besides, it is an idle and unfounded supposition that a monastic life
existed among the Jews.

<span id="ix.vii-p10"></span>We must reply, however, to another
objection, that the virgin refers to the future, and so declares that
she will have no intercourse with a man. The probable and simple
explanation is, that the greatness or rather majesty of the subject made
so powerful an impression on the virgin, that all her senses were bound
and locked up in astonishment. When she is informed that the Son of God
will be born, she imagines something unusual, and for that reason leaves
conjugal intercourse out of view. Hence she breaks out in amazement,
*How shall this be?* And so God graciously forgives her, and replies
kindly and gently by the angel, because, in a devout and serious manner,
and with admiration of a divine work, she had inquired *how that would
be,* which, she was convinced, went beyond the common and ordinary
course of nature. In a word, this question was not so contrary to faith,
because it arose rather from admiration than from distrust.

<span id="ix.vii-p11"></span><span id="ix.vii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p12"></span>**35.** *The Holy Ghost shall come upon
thee* The angel does not explain the manner, so as to satisfy curiosity,
which there was no necessity for doing. He only leads the virgin to
contemplate the power of the Holy Spirit, and to surrender herself
silently and calmly to his guidance. The word <span
id="ix.vii-p12.1"></span>ἐπελεύσεται, *shall come upon,* denotes that
this would be an extraordinary work, in which natural means have no
place. The next clause is added by way of exposition, *and the power of
the Highest shall overshadow thee:* for the Spirit may be regarded as
the essential power of God, whose energy is manifested and exerted in
the entire government of the world, as well as in miraculous events.
There is an elegant metaphor in the word <span
id="ix.vii-p12.2"></span>ἐπισκιάσει*, overshadow.* The *power* of God,
by which he guards and protects his own people, is frequently compared
in Scripture to a *shadow,* (<span id="ix.vii-p12.3"></span>[Ps
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#008.md)<span id="ix.vii-p12.3"></span>;
<span id="ix.vii-p12.4"></span>[Ps
57:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.vii-p12.4"></span>;
<span id="ix.vii-p12.5"></span>[Ps
91:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#001)<span id="ix.vii-p12.5"></span>..md)
But it appears to have another and peculiar meaning in this passage. The
operation of the Spirit would be secret, as if an intervening cloud did
not permit it to be beheld by the eyes of men. Now, as God, in
performing miracles, withholds from us the manner of his proceedings, so
what he chooses to conceal from us ought to be viewed, on our part, with
seriousness and adoration.

<span id="ix.vii-p13"></span>*Therefore also the holy thing which shall
be born* This is a confirmation of the preceding clause: for the angel
shows that Christ must not be born by ordinary generation,  <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) that he may be *holy,* and that he may be
the *Son of God;* that is, that in holiness and glory he may be high
above all creatures, and may not hold an ordinary rank among men.
Heretics, who imagine that he became the Son of God after his human
generation, seize on the particle *therefore* as meaning that he would
be called the Son of God, *because* he was conceived in a remarkable
manner by the power of the Holy Spirit. But this is a false conclusion:
for, though he was manifested to be the Son of God in the flesh, it does
not follow that he was not the Word begotten of the Father before the
ages. On the contrary, he who had been the Son of God in his eternal
Godhead, appeared also as the Son of God in human flesh. This passage
not only expresses a unity of person in Christ, but at the same time
points out that, in clothing himself with human flesh, Christ is the Son
of God. As the name, Son *of God,* belonged to the divine essence of
Christ from the beginning, so now it is applied unitedly to both
natures, because the secret and heavenly manner of generation has
separated him from the ordinary rank of men. In other passages, indeed,
with the view of asserting that he is truly man, he calls himself the
Son of man, (<span id="ix.vii-p14.2"></span>[Joh
5:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#027)<span id="ix.vii-p14.2"></span>;.md)
but the truth of his human nature is not inconsistent with his deriving
peculiar honor above all others from his divine generation, having been
conceived out of the ordinary way of nature by the Holy Spirit. This
gives us good reason for growing confidence, that we may venture more
freely to call God our Father, because his only Son, in order that we
might have a Father in common with him, chose to be our brother.

<span id="ix.vii-p15"></span>It ought to be observed also that Christ,
because he was conceived by a spiritual power, is called *the holy seed*
For, as it was necessary that he should be a real man, in order that he
might expiate our sins, and vanquish death and Satan in our flesh; so
was it necessary, in order to his cleansing others, that he should be
free from every spot and blemish, (<span id="ix.vii-p15.1"></span>[1Pe
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#019)<span id="ix.vii-p15.1"></span>..md)
Though Christ was formed of the seed of Abraham, yet he contracted no
defilement from a sinful nature; for the Spirit of God kept him pure
from the very commencement: and this was done not merely that he might
abound in personal holiness, but chiefly that he might sanctify his own
people. The manner of conception, therefore, assures us that we have a
Mediator separate from sinners, (<span id="ix.vii-p15.2"></span>[Heb
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#026)<span id="ix.vii-p15.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.vii-p16"></span><span id="ix.vii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p17"></span>**36.** *And, behold, Elisabeth thy cousin*
By an instance taken from her own relatives, the angel encourages the
faith of Mary to expect a miracle. If neither the barrenness nor the old
age of Elisabeth could prevent God from making her a mother, there was
no better reason why Mary should confine her view within the ordinary
limits of nature, when she beheld such a demonstration of divine power
in her *cousin* He mentions expressly *the sixth month;* because in the
fifth month a woman usually feels the child quicken in the womb, so that
the *sixth month* removes all doubt. True, Mary ought to have placed
such a reliance on the bare word of God as to require no support to her
faith from any other quarter; but, to prevent farther hesitation, the
Lord condescends to strengthen his promise by this new aid. With equal
indulgence does he cheer and support us every day; nay, with greater
indulgence, because our faith is weaker. That we may not doubt his
truth, testimonies to confirm it are brought by him from every
direction.

<span id="ix.vii-p18"></span>A question arises, how Elisabeth, who was
*of the daughters of Aaron,* (<span id="ix.vii-p18.1"></span>[Lu
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#005)<span id="ix.vii-p18.1"></span>,.md)
and Mary, who was descended from the stock of David, could be *cousins*
This appears to be at variance with the law, which prohibited women from
marrying into a different tribe from their own, (<span
id="ix.vii-p18.2"></span>[Nu 36:6](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#006.md)<span
id="ix.vii-p18.2"></span>.) With respect to the law, if we look at its
object, it forbade those intermarriages only which might “remove
inheritances from tribe to tribe,” (<span id="ix.vii-p18.3"></span>[Nu
36:7](../../../bib/kjv/num036.htm#007)<span id="ix.vii-p18.3"></span>..md)
No such danger existed, if any woman of the tribe of Judah married a
priest, to whom an inheritance could not be conveyed. The same argument
would hold if a woman of the tribe of Levi passed into another tribe. It
is possible that the mother of the holy virgin might be descended from
the family of Aaron, and so her daughter might be *cousin* to Elisabeth.

<span id="ix.vii-p19"></span><span id="ix.vii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p20"></span>**37.** *For no word shall be impossible
with God* If we choose to take <span id="ix.vii-p20.1"></span>ῥη̑μα,
*word,* in its strict and native sense, the meaning is, that God will do
what he hath promised, for no hinderance can resist his power. The
argument will be, God hath promised, and therefore he will accomplish
it; for we ought not to allege any impossibility in opposition to his
*word* But as a *word* often means a *thing* in the idiom of the Hebrew
language, (which the Evangelists followed, though they wrote in Greek,)
 <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) we explain it more simply, that
*nothing is impossible with God* We ought always, in- deed, to hold it
as a maxim, that they wander widely from the truth who, at their
pleasure, imagine the power of God to be something beyond his *word;*
for we ought always to contemplate his boundless power, that it may
strengthen our hope and confidence. But it is idle, and unprofitable,
and even dangerous, to argue what God can do unless we also take into
account what he resolves to do. The angel does here what God frequently
does in Scripture, employs a general doctrine to confirm one kind of
promise. This is the true and proper use of a general doctrine, to apply
its scattered promises to the present subject, whenever we are uneasy or
distressed; for so long as they retain their general form, they make
little impression upon us. We need not wonder if Mary is reminded by the
angel of the power of God; for our distrust of it diminishes very
greatly our confidence in the promises. All acknowledge in words that
God is Almighty; but, if he promises any thing beyond what we are able
to comprehend, we remain in doubt.  <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md)
Whence comes this but from our ascribing to his power nothing more than
what our senses receive? Thus Paul, commending the faith of Abraham,
says, that he

<span id="ix.vii-p23"></span>“gave glory to God, being fully persuaded
that what he had promised he was able also to perform,” (<span
id="ix.vii-p23.1"></span>[Rom. 4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021)<span id="ix.vii-p23.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.vii-p24"></span>In another passage, speaking of the hope of
eternal life, he sets before him the promise of God. “I know,” says he,

<span id="ix.vii-p25"></span>“whom I have believed, and I am persuaded
that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him,” (<span
id="ix.vii-p25.1"></span>[2Ti
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012)<span id="ix.vii-p25.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.vii-p26"></span>This may seem to be a small portion of
faith; for no man, however wicked, openly denies God’s claim to be
Almighty. But he who has the power of God firmly and thoroughly fixed in
his heart will easily surmount the other obstacles which present
themselves to faith. It ought to be observed, however, that the power of
God is viewed by true faith, if I may use the expression, *as
efficacious*  <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) For God is and wishes
to be acknowledged as powerful, that by the accomplishment itself he may
prove his faithfulness.

<span id="ix.vii-p28"></span><span id="ix.vii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p29"></span>**38.** *Behold the handmaid of the Lord*
The holy virgin does not allow herself to dispute any farther: and yet
many things might unquestionably have obtruded themselves, to repress
that faith, and even to draw off her attention from what was said to her
by the angel. But she stops the entrance of opposing arguments, and
compels herself to obey. This is the real proof of faith, when we
restrain our minds, and, as it were, hold them captive, so that they
dare not reply this or that to God: for boldness in disputing, on the
other hand, is the mother of unbelief. These are weighty expressions,
*Behold the handmaid of the Lord:* for she gives and devotes herself
unreservedly to God, that he may freely dispose of her according to his
pleasure. Unbelievers withdraw from his hand, and, as far as lies in
their power, obstruct his work: but faith presents us before God, that
we may be ready to yield obedience. But if the holy virgin was *the
handmaid of the Lord,* because she yielded herself submissively to his
authority, there cannot be worse obstinacy than to fly from him, and to
refuse that obedience which he deserves and requires. In a word, as
faith alone makes us obedient servants to God, and gives us up to his
power, so unbelief makes us rebels and deserters. *Be it unto me* This
clause may be interpreted in two ways. Either the holy virgin, leaving
her former subject,  <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) betakes
herself suddenly to prayers and supplications; or, she proceeds in the
same strain  <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) to yield and surrender
herself to God. I interpret it simply that she is convinced of the power
of God, follows cheerfully where he calls, trusts also to his promise,
and not only expects, but eagerly desires, its accomplishment. \[We must
also observe that she is convinced on the word of the angel, because she
knows that it proceeded from God: valuing its credit, not with reference
to him who was its messenger, but with reference to him who was its
author.  <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) \]
