<span id="ix.xxix-p9"></span> 

<span id="ix.xxix-p10"></span><span id="ix.xxix-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxix-p11"></span>The three Evangelists relate the Baptist’s
discourse in the same words. In one respect, Luke’s account is more
full: for he opens it by explaining the occasion on which this discourse
was delivered. It arose from the people being in danger of being led, by
a false opinion, to convey to him the honor which was due to Christ. To
remove, as soon as possible, every occasion of such a mistake, he
expressly declares, that he is not the Christ, and draws such a
distinction between Christ and himself as to maintain Christ’s
prerogative. He would have done this of his own accord, by *handing them
over, to* use a common expression, as disciples to Christ: but he takes
up the matter at an earlier stage, lest, by remaining silent any longer,
he should confirm the people in an error.

<span id="ix.xxix-p12"></span>*He who cometh after me is stronger than
I* Christ is thus declared to be so far superior in power and rank,
that, with respect to him, John must occupy a private station.  <span
id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) He uses ordinary forms of speech to
magnify the glory of Christ, in comparison of whom he declares that he
himself is nothing. The chief part of his statement is, that he
represents Christ as the author of spiritual baptism, and himself as
only the minister of outward baptism. He appears to anticipate an
objection, which might be brought forward. What was the design of the
Baptism which he had taken upon himself? For it was no light matter to
introduce any innovation whatever into the Church of God, and
particularly to bring forward a new way of introducing persons into the
Church, which was more perfect than the law of God. He replies, that he
did not proceed to do this without authority; but that his office, as
minister of an outward symbol, takes nothing away from the power and
glory of Christ.

<span id="ix.xxix-p14"></span>Hence we infer, that his intention was not
at all to distinguish between his own baptism, and that which Christ
taught his disciples, and which he intended should remain in perpetual
obligation in his Church. He does not contrast one visible sign with
another visible sign, but compares the characters of master and servant
with each other, and shows what is due to the master, and what is due to
the servant. It ought not to have any weight with us, that an opinion
has long and extensively prevailed, that John’s baptism differs from
ours. We must learn to form our judgment from the matter as it stands,
and not from the mistaken opinions of men. And certainly the comparison,
which they imagine to have been made, would involve great absurdities.
It would follow from it, that the Holy Spirit is given, in the present
day*,* by ministers. Again, it would follow that John’s baptism was a
dead sign, and had no efficacy whatever. Thirdly, it would follow, that
we have not the same baptism with Christ: for it is sufficiently
evident, that the fellowship, which he condescends to maintain with us,
was ratified by this pledge,  <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md)
when he consecrated baptism in his own body.

<span id="ix.xxix-p16"></span>We must therefore hold by what I have
already said, that John merely distinguishes, in this passage, between
himself and the other ministers of baptism, on the one hand, and the
power of Christ, on the other, and maintains the superiority of the
master over the servants. And hence we deduce the general doctrine, as
to what is done in baptism by men, and what is accomplished in it by the
Son of God. To men has been committed nothing more than the
administration of an outward and visible sign: the reality dwells with
Christ alone.  <span id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md)

<span id="ix.xxix-p18"></span>Scripture does sometimes, though not in a
literal sense,  <span id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) ascribe to men
what John here declares not to belong to men, but claims exclusively for
Christ. In such cases, however, the design is not to inquire, what man
has separately and by himself, but merely to show, what is the effect
and advantage of signs, and in what manner God makes use of them, as
instruments, by his Spirit. Here also is laid down a distinction between
Christ and his ministers, that the world may not fall into the mistake,
of giving to them what is justly due to him alone: for there is nothing
to which they are more prone, than to adorn creatures with what has been
taken from God by robbery. A careful attention to this observation will
rid us of many difficulties. We know what disputes have arisen, in our
own age, about the advantage and efficacy of signs, all of which may be
disposed of in a single word. The ordinance of our Lord, viewed as a
whole, includes himself as its Author, and the power of the Spirit,
together with the figure and the minister: but where a comparison is
made between our Lord and the minister, the former must have all the
honor, and the latter must be reduced to nothing.

<span id="ix.xxix-p20"></span>**<span id="ix.xxix-p20.1"></span>[Matthew
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011.md)<span
id="ix.xxix-p20.1"></span>.** *He* *shall baptize you with the Holy
Spirit and with fire* It is asked, why did not John equally say, that it
is Christ alone who washes souls with his blood? The reason is, that
this very washing is performed by the power of the Spirit, and John
reckoned it enough to express the whole effect of baptism by the single
word *Spirit* The meaning is clear, that Christ alone bestows all the
grace which is figuratively represented by outward baptism, because it
is he who “sprinkles the conscience” with his blood. It is he also who
mortifies the old man, and bestows the Spirit of regeneration. The word
*fire* is added as an epithet, and is applied to the Spirit, because he
takes away our pollutions, *as fire* purifies gold. In the same manner,
he is metaphorically called *water* in another passage, (<span
id="ix.xxix-p20.2"></span>[Joh
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#005)<span id="ix.xxix-p20.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xxix-p21"></span><span id="ix.xxix-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxix-p22"></span>**12.** *Whose winnowing-fan is in his
hand* In the former verse, John preached concerning the grace of Christ,
that the Jews might yield themselves to him to be renewed: now he
discourses of judgment, that he may strike despisers with terror. As
there are always many hypocrites who proudly reject the grace of Christ
offered to them, it is also necessary to denounce the judgment that
awaits them. For this reason John here describes Christ as a severe
judge against unbelievers. And this is an order which must be observed
by us in teaching, that hypocrites may know, that their rejection of
Christ will not go unpunished. They will thus be roused from their
lethargy, and begin to dread him as an avenger, whom they despised as
the author of salvation.

<span id="ix.xxix-p23"></span>I have no doubt, that John intended also
to show, what Christ accomplishes by means of his Gospel. The preaching
of the Gospel, then, is the *winnowing-fan* Before the Lord *sifts* us,
the whole world is involved in confusion, every one flatters himself,
and the good are mixed with the bad in short, it is only necessary that
the *chaff* be blown. But when Christ comes forward with his Gospels, —
when he reproves the consciences and summons them to the tribunal of
God, the *chaff* is sifted out,  <span id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md)
which formerly occupied a great part of the *thrashing-floor* It is true
that, in the case of individuals, the Gospel effects a separation from
the *chaff:* but in this passage, John compares the reprobate to
*chaff,* and believers to *wheat* The *thrashing floor* accordingly
denotes — not the world, (as some people imagine,) but the Church: for
we must attend to the class of persons whom John addresses. The mere
title filled the Jews with pride,  <span
id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) but John tells them that it is foolish
in them to be proud of it, because they hold but a temporary place in
the Church of God, from which they are soon to be thrown out, like
*chaff* from the *thrashing-floor*. In this way, he gives a rapid glance
at the corrupt state in which the Church then was: for it was covered
with husks, and straws, and other rubbish, but would soon be cleansed by
the strong breeze of the Gospel. But how is Christ said to separate the
*chaff* from the *wheat,* when he can find nothing in men but mere
*chaff?* The answer is easy. The elect are formed into *wheat,*  <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) and are then separated from the
*chaff,* and *collected into the granary*

<span id="ix.xxix-p27"></span>*He will thoroughly cleanse his
thrashing-floor* This work was begun by Christ, and is daily going
forward: but the full accomplishment of it will not be seen till the
last day. This is the reason why John draws our attention to the
subject. But let us remember, that believers even now enter, by hope,
into the *granary* of God, in which they will actually have their
everlasting abode; while the reprobate experience, in their convictions
of guilt, the heat of that *fire,* the actual *burning* of which they
will feel at the last day.

<span id="ix.xxix-p28"></span>Many persons, I am aware, have entered
into ingenious debates about the eternal *fire,* by which the wicked
will be tormented after the judgment. But we may conclude from many
passages of Scripture, that it is a metaphorical expression. For, if we
must believe that it is real, or what they call material *fire,* we must
also believe that the *brimstone* and the *fan* are material, both of
them being mentioned by Isaiah.

<span id="ix.xxix-p29"></span>“For Tophet is ordained of old; the pile
thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of
brimstone, doth kindle it,” (<span id="ix.xxix-p29.1"></span>[Isa
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md)<span
id="ix.xxix-p29.1"></span>.)

<span id="ix.xxix-p30"></span>We must explain the fire in the same
manner as the *worm,* (<span id="ix.xxix-p30.1"></span>[Mark
9:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#044.md),
[46](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#046.md),
[48](../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#048)<span id="ix.xxix-p30.1"></span>..md)
and if it is universally agreed that the *worm* is a metaphorical term,
we must form the same opinion as to the fire. Let us lay aside the
speculations, by which foolish men weary themselves to no purpose, and
satisfy ourselves with believing, that these forms of speech denote, in
a manner suited to our feeble capacity, a dreadful torment, which no man
can now comprehend, and no language can express.
