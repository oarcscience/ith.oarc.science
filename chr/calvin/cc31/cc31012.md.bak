<span id="ix.iv-p3"></span>**18**.** **And Zacharias said to the angel,
How shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is at an
advanced age. **19**.** **And the angel answering said to him, I am
Gabriel, who stand before God, and have been sent to speak to thee, and
to convey to thee these glad tidings. **20**.** **And, behold, thou
shalt be dumb, and shalt not be able to speak, until the day when these
things shall happen; because thou hast not believed my words, which
shall be fulfilled in their time,

<span id="ix.iv-p5"></span>*And Zacharias said to the angel* Next
follows the doubt of Zacharias, and the punishment which the Lord
inflicted on his unbelief. He had prayed that he might obtain offspring,
and now that it is promised, he distrusts, as if he had forgotten his
own prayers and faith. It might, at first sight, appear harsh that God
is so much offended by his reply. He brings forward his old age as an
objection. Abraham did the same; and yet his faith is so highly
applauded that Paul declares, he

<span id="ix.iv-p6"></span>“considered not his own body now dead,
neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb,” (<span
id="ix.iv-p6.1"></span>[Ro 4:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019.md)<span
id="ix.iv-p6.1"></span>,)

<span id="ix.iv-p7"></span>but unhesitatingly relied on the truth and
power of God. Zacharias inquires how, or by what proof, he might arrive
at certainty. But Gideon was not blamed for twice asking a sign, (<span
id="ix.iv-p7.1"></span>[Judg. 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#017.md),
[37](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#037.md),
[39](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#039)<span id="ix.iv-p7.1"></span>..md) Nay
more, we are shortly after this informed of Mary’s objection, *How shall
this be, since I know not a man?* (ver. 34,) which the angel passes over
as if it contained nothing wrong. How comes it then that God punishes
Zacharias so severely, as if he had been guilty of a very heinous sin? I
do acknowledge that, if the words only are considered, either all were
equally to blame, or Zacharias did nothing wrong. But as the actions and
words of men must be judged from the state of the heart, we ought rather
to abide by the judgment of God, to whom the hidden secrets of the heart
are naked and opened, (<span id="ix.iv-p7.3"></span>[Heb
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013)<span id="ix.iv-p7.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.iv-p8"></span>Unquestionably, the Lord beheld in Zacharias
something worse than his words may bear, and therefore his anger was
kindled against him for throwing back with distrust the promised favor.
We have no right, indeed, to lay down a law to God which would not leave
him free to punish in one the fault which he pardons in others. But it
is very evident that the case of Zacharias was widely different from
that of Abraham, or Gideon, or Mary. This does not appear in the words;
and therefore the knowledge of it must be left to God, whose eyes pierce
the depths of the heart. Thus God distinguishes between Sarah’s laugh
(<span id="ix.iv-p8.1"></span>[Ge
18:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#012)<span id="ix.iv-p8.1"></span>.md)
and Abraham’s, (<span id="ix.iv-p8.2"></span>[Ge
17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017)<span id="ix.iv-p8.2"></span>,.md)
though the one apparently does not differ from the other. The reason why
Zacharias doubted was, that, stopping at the ordinary course of nature,
he ascribed less than he ought to have done to the power of God. They
take a narrow and disparaging view of the works of God, who believe that
he will do no more than nature holds out to be probable, as if his hand
were limited to our senses or confined to earthly means. But it belongs
to faith to believe that more can be done than carnal reason admits.
Zacharias had no hesitation with regard to its being the voice of God,
but as he looked too exclusively at the world, an indirect doubt arose
in his mind if what he had heard would really happen. In that respect he
did no slight injury to God, for he went so far as to reason with
himself, whether God, who had undoubtedly spoken to him, should be
regarded as worthy of credit.

<span id="ix.iv-p9"></span>At the same time, we ought to know that
Zacharias was not so unbelieving as to turn aside wholly from the faith;
for there is a general faith which embraces the promise of eternal
salvation and the testimony of a free adoption. On the other hand, when
God has once received us into favor, he gives us many special promises,
— that he will feed us, will deliver us from dangers, will vindicate our
reputation, will protect our life; — and so there is a special faith
which answers particularly to each of these promises. Thus, it will
sometimes happen, that one who trusts in God for the pardon of his sins,
and for salvation, will waver on some point, — will be too much alarmed
by the dread of death, too solicitous about daily food, or too anxious
about his plans. Such was the unbelief of Zacharias; for while he held
the root and foundation of faith, he hesitated only on one point,
whether God would give to him a son. Let us know, therefore, that those
who are perplexed or disturbed by weakness on some particular occasion
do not entirely depart or fall off from the faith, and that, though the
branches of faith are agitated by various tempests, it does not give way
at the root. Besides, nothing was farther from the intention of
Zacharias than to call in question the truth of a divine promise; but
while he was convinced generally that God is faithful, he was cunningly
drawn by the craft and wiles of Satan to draw a wicked distinction. It
is all the more necessary for us to keep diligent watch: for which of us
shall be secure against the snares of the devil, when we learn that a
man so eminently holy, who had all his life maintained strict
watchfulness over himself, was overtaken by them?

<span id="ix.iv-p10"></span><span id="ix.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p11"></span>**19.** *I am Gabriel* By these words the
angel intimates that it was not his veracity, but that of God who sent
him, and whose message he brought, that had been questioned; and so he
charges Zacharias with having offered an insult to God. To *stand before
God* signifies to be ready to yield obedience. It implies that he is not
a mortal man, but a heavenly spirits — that he did not fly hither at
random, but, as became a servant of God, had faithfully performed his
duty: and hence it follows that *God,* the author of the promise, had
been treated with indignity and contempt in the person of his
ambassador. Of similar import is the declaration of Christ, “*he that
despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that
sent me,”* (<span id="ix.iv-p11.1"></span>[Lu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016)<span id="ix.iv-p11.1"></span>..md)
Although the preaching of the gospel is not brought to us from heaven by
angels, yet, since God attested by so many miracles that he was its
author, and since Christ, the Prince and Lord of angels, once published
it with his own mouth, (<span id="ix.iv-p11.2"></span>[Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)<span id="ix.iv-p11.2"></span>,.md)
that he might give it a perpetual sanction, its majesty ought to make as
deep an impression upon us, as if all the angels were heard loudly
proclaiming its attestation from heaven. Nay, the apostle, in the
Epistle to the Hebrews, not satisfied with elevating the word of the
gospel, which speaks by the mouth of men, to an equality with the law
brought by angels, draws an argument from the less to the greater.

<span id="ix.iv-p12"></span>“If the word spoken by angels was stedfast,
and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of
rewards”  
(<span id="ix.iv-p12.2"></span>[Heb
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#002)<span id="ix.iv-p12.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="ix.iv-p13"></span>*“*of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye,
shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of
God,”  
(<span id="ix.iv-p13.2"></span>[Heb
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#029)<span id="ix.iv-p13.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="ix.iv-p14"></span>whose “voice shakes not the earth only, but
also heaven?” (<span id="ix.iv-p14.1"></span>[Heb
12:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#026)<span id="ix.iv-p14.1"></span>..md)
Let us learn to render to God the obedience of faith, which he values
more highly than all sacrifices. *Gabriel* means the strength, or power,
or pre-eminence of God, and this name is given to the angel on our
account, to instruct us that we must not ascribe to angels any thing of
their own, for whatever excellence they possess is from God. The Greek
participle, <span id="ix.iv-p14.2"></span>παρεστηκὼς, *(standing,)* is
in the past tense, but everybody knows that the past tense of such verbs
is often taken for the present, and particularly when a continued act is
expressed. The word <span id="ix.iv-p14.3"></span>εὐαγγελίσασθαι *(to
convey glad tidings) aggravates* the crime of Zacharias; for he was
ungrateful to God, who kindly promised a joyful and desirable event.

<span id="ix.iv-p15"></span><span id="ix.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p16"></span>**20.** *And, behold, thou shalt be dumb* It
was suitable that this kind of punishment should be inflicted on
Zacharias, that, being dumb, he might await the fulfillment of the
promise, which, instead of interrupting it by noisy murmurs, he ought to
have heard in silence. Faith has its silence to lend an ear to the Word
of God. It has afterwards its turn to speak and to answer Amen,
according to that passage,

<span id="ix.iv-p17"></span>“I will say to them, Thou art my people, and
they shall say,  
Thou art my God,” (<span id="ix.iv-p17.2"></span>[Ho
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023)<span id="ix.iv-p17.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.iv-p18"></span>But as Zacharias had rashly interrupted the
Word of God, he is not allowed this favor of breaking out immediately in
thanksgiving, but is denied for a time the use of his tongue, which had
been too forward. Yet God is pleased graciously to mitigate the
punishment, first, by limiting its duration to ten months, and next by
not withholding from Zacharias the favor which he was unworthy to enjoy.
With the same gentleness does he treat us every day: for when our faith
is weak, and we throw out many obstacles, the truth of God, in
continuing to flow toward us, must of necessity break through them with
a kind of violence. That is the angel’s meaning, when he reproaches
Zacharias with unbelief, and yet declares that those things which
Zacharias did not believe would be *accomplished in due time* And so
Zacharias is not a little relieved by learning that his fault has not
made void the promise of God, which will afterwards be displayed in a
more remarkable manner. It does sometimes happen that, notwithstanding
the opposition made by unbelievers, the Lord bestows and fulfils what he
had promised to them. We have a remarkable instance of this in King
Ahaz, who rejected the promised safety, and yet was delivered from his
enemies, (<span id="ix.iv-p18.1"></span>[Isa
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#012)<span id="ix.iv-p18.1"></span>..md)
But that resulted, without any advantage to him, in the salvation of the
chosen people. It was otherwise with Zacharias, in whom the Lord
chastises, and at the same time pardons, the weakness of faith.
