6:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#019.md)<span id="ix.lvii-p8.1"></span>.**
*Lay not up.* This deadly plague reigns everywhere throughout the world.
Men are grown mad with an insatiable desire of gain. Christ charges them
with folly, in collecting wealth with great care, and then giving up
their happiness to *moths* and to *rust,* or exposing it as a prey to
thieves. What is more unreasonable than to place their property, where
it may perish of itself, or be carried off by men?  <span
id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md) Covetous men, indeed, take no thought
of this. They lock up their riches in well-secured chests, but cannot
prevent them from being exposed to *thieves* or to *moths* They are
blind and destitute of sound judgment, who give themselves so much toil
and uneasiness in amassing wealth, which is liable to putrefaction, or
robbery, or a thousand other accidents: particularly, when God allows us
a place *in heaven for laying up a treasure,* and kindly invites us to
enjoy riches which never perish.

<span id="ix.lvii-p10"></span><span id="ix.lvii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lvii-p11"></span>**20.** *But lay up for yourselves
treasures in heaven* They are said to do so, who, instead of entangling
themselves in the snares of this world, make it their care and their
business to meditate on the heavenly life. In Luke’s narrative, no
mention is made of the contrast between *laying up treasures on the
earth* and *laying up treasures in heaven;* and he refers to a different
occasion for the command of Christ *to prepare bags, which do not grow
old:* for he had previously said, *Sell what you possess, and give alms*
It is a harsh and unpleasant thing for men to strip themselves of their
own wealth; and with the view of alleviating their uneasiness, he holds
out a large and magnificent hope of remuneration. Those who assist their
poor brethren *on the earth lay up for themselves treasures in heaven,*
according to the saying of Solomon,

<span id="ix.lvii-p12"></span>“He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth
to the Lord, and that which he hath given will he pay him again,”  
(<span id="ix.lvii-p12.2"></span>[Pr
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017.md)<span
id="ix.lvii-p12.2"></span>.)

<span id="ix.lvii-p13"></span>The command to *sell possessions* must not
be literally interpreted, as if a Christian were not at liberty to
retain any thing for himself. He only intended to show, that we must not
be satisfied with bestowing on the poor what we can easily spare, but
that we must not refuse to part with our estates, if their revenue does
not supply the wants of the poor. His meaning is, “Let your liberality
go so far as to lessen your patrimony, and dispose of your lands.”

<span id="ix.lvii-p14"></span><span id="ix.lvii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lvii-p15"></span>**21.** *Where your treasure shall be* By
this statement Christ proves that they are unhappy men who have their
treasures laid up on the earth: because their happiness is uncertain and
of short duration. Covetous men cannot be prevented from breathing in
their hearts a wish for heaven: but Christ lays down an opposite
principle, that, wherever men imagine the greatest happiness to be,
there they are surrounded and confined. Hence it follows, that they who
desire to be happy in the world  <span id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md)
renounce heaven. We know how carefully the philosophers conducted their
inquiries respecting the supreme good.  <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) It was the chief point on which they
bestowed their labor, and justly: for it is the principle on which the
regulation of our life entirely depends, and the object to which all our
senses are directed. If honor is reckoned the supreme good, the minds of
men must be wholly occupied with ambition: if money, covetousness will
immediately predominate: if pleasure, it will be impossible to prevent
men from sinking into brutal indulgence. We have all a natural desire to
pursue happiness;  <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) and the
consequence is, that false imaginations carry us away in every
direction. But if we were honestly and firmly convinced that our
happiness is in heaven, it would be easy for us to trample upon the
world, to despise earthly blessings, (by the deceitful attractions of
which the greater part of men are fascinated,) and to rise towards
heaven. For this reason Paul, with the view of exciting believers to
look upwards, and of exhorting them to meditate on the heavenly life,
(<span id="ix.lvii-p18.2"></span>[Col
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#001)<span id="ix.lvii-p18.2"></span>,.md)
presents to them Christ, in whom alone they ought to seek perfect
happiness; thus declaring, that to allow their souls to grovel on the
earth would be inconsistent and unworthy of those whose *treasure is in
heaven*

<span id="ix.lvii-p17"></span> “<span id="ix.lvii-p17.1"></span>Nous
savons comment les Philosophes se sont amusez a traiter subtilemerit du
souverain bien des hommes.” — “We know to what trouble the Philosophers
submitted in ingenious discussions about the supreme good of men.” —
“The allusion is chiefly to the Greeks: for the philosophy of the Romans
was at second hand, though nothing can be more ingenious or beautiful
than the reasonings of Cicero in his Dissertations *“*<span
id="ix.lvii-p17.2"></span>*De* Finibus Bonorum et Malorum.” He inquires
into the τέλος, or *end,* of good and evil actions. In examining the
principles of Epicurus, he professes to feel very much at ease, but
approaches the Stoics with greater respect, and acknowledges the ability
with which they had conducted their argument. The perusal of the whole
treatise will gratify a reader prepared to accompany powerful minds in
their most intricate researches, or to hail abstruse disquisition
clothed in the choicest language by one who, as Robert Hall said of
Pascal, “can invest the severest logic with the charms of the most
beautiful composition, and render the most profound argumentation as
entertaining as a romance.” But those studies have a far higher value.
When we see the greatest minds tasked to their utmost strength, and yet
utterly failing to discover, by unassisted reason, the path which leads
to happiness, we appreciate more highly Leland's argument “On the
advantage and necessity of Divine Revelation,” and bless the name of the
Great Prophet, *who hath brought life and immortality to light by the
Gospel,* (<span id="ix.lvii-p17.3"></span>[2Ti

<span id="ix.lvii-p18"></span> “<span id="ix.lvii-p18.1"></span>Car
naturellement nous tendons tous a desirer ce qui nous semble estre le
souverain bien.” — “For we have all a natural tendency to desire what
appears to us to be the supreme good.”
