<span id="ix.i-p2"></span>**1**.** **Forasmuch as many have undertaken
to compose a narrative of those things which are most surely believed
among us, **2**.** **Even as they delivered them unto us, who from the
beginning were eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word; **3**.** **It
seemed good to me also, having carefully examined all things from the
beginning, to write to thee in detail, most excellent Theophilus,

whereof thou hast been instructed.

<span id="ix.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.i-p4"></span><span id="ix.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p5"></span>Luke is the only Evangelist who makes a
preface to his Gospel, for the purpose of explaining briefly the motive
which induced him to write. By addressing a single individual he may
appear to have acted foolishly, instead of sounding the trumpet aloud,
as was his duty, and inviting all men to believe. It appears, therefore,
to be unsuitable that the doctrine which does not peculiarly belong to
one person or to another, but is common to all, should be privately sent
to his friend Theophilus. Hence some have been led to think that
*Theophilus is* an appellative noun, and is applied to all godly persons
on account of their *love of God;* but the epithet which is joined to it
is inconsistent with that opinion. Nor is there any reason for dreading
the absurdity which drove them to adopt such an expedient. For it is not
less true that *Paul’s* doctrine belongs to all, though some of his
Epistles were addressed to certain cities, and others to certain men.
Nay, we must acknowledge, if we take into account the state of those
times, that Luke adopted a conscientious and prudent course. There were
tyrants on every hand who, by terror and alarm, were prepared to
obstruct the progress of sound doctrine. This gave occasion to Satan and
his ministers for spreading abroad the clouds of error, by which the
pure light would be obscured. Now, as the great body of men cared little
about maintaining the purity of the Gospel, and few considered
attentively the inventions of Satan or the amount of danger that lurked
under such disguises, every one who excelled others by uncommon faith,
or by extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, was the more strongly bound to
do his utmost, by care and industry, for preserving the doctrine of
godliness pure and uncontaminated from every corruption. Such persons
were chosen by God to be the sacred keepers of the law, by whom the
heavenly doctrine committed to them should be honestly handed down to
posterity. With this view therefore, Luke dedicates his Gospel to
Theophilus, that he might undertake the faithful preservation of it; and
the same duty Paul enjoins and recommends to Timothy, (<span
id="ix.i-p5.1"></span>[2 Tim. 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#014.md), [2
Tim. 3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#014.md)<span
id="ix.i-p5.1"></span>.)

<span id="ix.i-p6"></span>**1.** *Forasmuch as many.* He assigns a
reason for writing which, one would think, ought rather to have
dissuaded him from writing. To compose a history, which had already
employed many authors, was unnecessary labor, at least if they had
faithfully discharged their duty. But no accusation of imposture, or
carelessness, or any other fault, is in the slightest degree insinuated.
It looks, therefore, as if he were expressing a resolution to do what
had been already done. I reply, though he deals gently with those who
had written before him, he does not altogether approve of their labors.
He does not expressly say that they had written on matters with which
they were imperfectly acquainted, but by laying claim to certainty as to
the facts, he modestly denies their title to full and unshaken
confidence. It may be objected that, if they made false statements, they
ought rather to have been severely censured. I reply again, they may not
have been deeply in fault; they may have erred more from want of
consideration than from malice; and, consequently, there would be no
necessity for greater fierceness of attack. And certainly there is
reason to believe that these were little more than historical sketches
which, though comparatively harmless at the time, would afterwards, if
they had not been promptly counteracted, have done serious injury to the
faith. But it is worthy of remark that, in applying this remedy through
Luke to unnecessary writings, God had a wonderful design in view of
obtaining, by universal consent, the rejection of others, and thus
securing undivided credit to those which reflect brightly his adorable
majesty. There is the less excuse for those silly people, by whom
disgusting stories, under the name of Nicodemus, or some other person,
are, at the present day, palmed upon the world.

<span id="ix.i-p7"></span>*Are most surely believed among us* The
participle <span id="ix.i-p7.1"></span>πεπληροφορημένα, which Luke
employs, denotes things fully ascertained, and which do not admit of
doubt. The old translator has repeatedly fallen into mistakes about this
word, and through that ignorance has given us a corrupted sense of some
very beautiful passages. One of these occurs in the writings of Paul,
where he enjoins every man to be fully persuaded in his own mind, (<span
id="ix.i-p7.2"></span>[Ro 14:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#005.md)<span
id="ix.i-p7.2"></span>,) that conscience may not hesitate and waver,
tossed to and fro (<span id="ix.i-p7.3"></span>[Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014)<span id="ix.i-p7.3"></span>.md) by
doubtful opinions. Hence, too, is derived the word <span
id="ix.i-p7.4"></span>πληροφορία*,* which he erroneously renders
*fullness,* while it denotes that strong conviction springing from
faith, in which godly minds safely rest. There is still, as I have said,
an implied contrast; for, by claiming for himself the authority of a
faithful witness, he destroys the credit of others who give contrary
statements.

<span id="ix.i-p8"></span>*Among us*  <span
id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) has the same meaning as *with us.*  <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) He appears to make faith rest on a weak
foundation, its relation to men, while it ought to rest on the Word of
God only; and certainly the *full assurance* <span
id="ix.i-p10.2"></span>(πληροφορία) of faith is ascribed to the sealing
of the Spirit, (<span id="ix.i-p10.3"></span>[1Th
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/th1001.htm#005.md)<span id="ix.i-p10.3"></span>;
<span id="ix.i-p10.4"></span>[Heb
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#022)<span id="ix.i-p10.4"></span>..md) I
reply, if the Word of God does not hold the first rank, faith will not
be satisfied with any human testimonies, but, where the inward
confirmation of the Spirit has already taken place, it allows them some
weight in the historical knowledge of facts. By historical knowledge I
mean that knowledge which we obtain respecting events, either by our own
observation or by the statement of others. For, with respect to the
visible works of God, it is equally proper to listen to *eye-witnesses*
as to rely on experience. Besides, those whom Luke follows were not
private authors, but were also *ministers of the Word* By this
commendation he exalts them above the rank of human authority; for he
intimates that the persons from whom he received his information had
been divinely authorized to preach the Gospel. Hence, too, that security
which he shortly afterwards mentions, and which, if it does not rest
upon God, may soon be disturbed. There is great weight in his
denominating those from whom he received his Gospel *ministers of the
Word;* for on that ground believers conclude that the witnesses are
beyond all exception, as the Lawyers express it, and cannot lawfully be
set aside.

<span id="ix.i-p11"></span>Erasmus, who has borrowed from Virgil  <span
id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) a phrase used in his version, did not
sufficiently consider the estimation and weight due to a Divine calling.
Luke does not talk in a profane style, but enjoins us in the person of
his friend Theophilus to keep in view the command of Christ, and to hear
with reverence the Son of God speaking through his Apostles. It is a
great matter that he affirms them to have been *eye-witneses,* but, by
calling them *ministers,* he takes them out of the common order of men,
that our faith may have its support in heaven and not in earth. In
short, Luke’s meaning is this: “that, since thou now hast those things
committed faithfully to writing which thou hadst formerly learned by
oral statements, thou mayest place a stronger reliance on the received
doctrine.” It is thus evident that God has employed every method to
prevent our faith from being suspended on the doubtful and shifting
opinions of men. There is the less room for excusing the ingratitude of
the world, which, as if it openly preferred the uncertainty arising out
of vague and unfounded reports, turns from so great a Divine favor with
loathing. But let us attend to the remarkable distinction which our Lord
has laid down, that foolish credulity may not insinuate itself under the
name of faith. Meanwhile, let us allow the world to be allured, as it
deserves, by the deceitful baits of foolish curiosity, and even to
surrender itself willingly to the delusions of Satan.

<span id="ix.i-p13"></span><span id="ix.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p14"></span>**3.** *Having carefully examined all things*
The old translator has it, *having followed out all things;*  <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) and the Greek verb <span
id="ix.i-p15.2"></span>παρακολουθεῖν is taken metaphorically from those
who tread in the footsteps of others, that nothing may escape them. So
that Luke intended to express his close and laborious investigation,
just as Demosthenes employs the same word, when, in examining an embassy
against which he brings an accusation, he boasts of his diligence to
have been such, that he perceived every thing that had been done as well
as if he had been a spectator.
