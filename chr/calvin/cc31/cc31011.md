exultation, and many shall rejoice on account of his birth.
**15**.** **For he shall be great before the Lord, and shall drink
neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy
Ghost, even from his mother's womb. **16**.** **And many of the children
of Israel shall he bring back to the Lord their God. **17**.** **And he
shall go before him with the spirit and power of Elijah, that he may
bring back the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the
disobedient to the wisdom of the just, that he may make ready a people
prepared for the Lord.

<span id="ix.iii-p5"></span><span id="ix.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p6"></span>**14.** *He shall be to thee joy* The angel
describes a greater joy than what Zacharias could derive from the recent
birth of a child; for he informs him that he would have such a son as he
had not even ventured to wish. He even proceeds farther to state that
the joy would not be domestic, enjoyed by the parents alone, or confined
within private walls, but shared alike by strangers, to whom the
advantage of his birth should be made known. It is as if the angel had
said that a son would be born not to Zacharias alone, but would be the
Teacher and Prophet of the whole people. The Papists have abused this
passage for the purpose of introducing a profane custom in celebrating
the birth-day of John. I pass over the disorderly scene of a procession
accompanied by dancing and leaping, and licentiousness of every
description, strangely enough employed in observing a day which they
pretend to hold sacred, and even the amusements authorized on that day
taken from magical arts and diabolical tricks, closely resembling the
mysteries of the goddess Ceres. It is enough for me, at present, to show
briefly that they absurdly torture the words of the angel to mean the
annual joy of a birth-day, while the angel restricts his commendation to
that joy which all godly persons would derive from the advantage of his
instruction. They rejoiced that a prophet was born to them, by whose
ministry they were led to the hope of salvation,

<span id="ix.iii-p7"></span><span id="ix.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p8"></span>**15.** *For he shall be great* He confirms
what he said *about joy,* for John had been selected for a great and
extraordinary purpose. These words are not so much intended to extol his
eminent virtues as to proclaim his great and glorious office; as Christ,
when he declares that *among them that are born of women there hath not
risen a greater than John the Baptist,* (<span
id="ix.iii-p8.1"></span>[Mt 11:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#011.md)<span
id="ix.iii-p8.1"></span>,) refers less to the holiness of his life than
to his ministry. What follows immediately afterwards, *he shall drink
neither wine nor strong drink,* must not be understood to mean that
John’s abstemiousness was a singular virtue, but that God was pleased to
distinguish his servant by this visible token, by which the world would
acknowledge him to be a continual Nazarite. The priests too abstained
from wine and strong drink, while they were performing their duties in
the temple, (<span id="ix.iii-p8.2"></span>[Le
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009)<span id="ix.iii-p8.2"></span>..md)
The same abstinence was enjoined on the Nazarites, (<span
id="ix.iii-p8.3"></span>[Nu 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#003.md)<span
id="ix.iii-p8.3"></span>,) until their vow should be fulfilled. By a
striking mark God showed that John was dedicated to him to be a Nazarite
for his whole life, as we learn was also the case with Samson, (<span
id="ix.iii-p8.4"></span>[Judg. 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#004)<span id="ix.iii-p8.4"></span>..md) But
we must not on this ground imagine that the worship of God consists in
abstinence from wine, as apish copyists select some part of the actions
of the fathers for an object of imitation. Only let all practice
temperance, let those who conceive it to be injurious to drink wine
abstain of their own accord, and let those who have it not endure the
want with contentment. As to the word <span
id="ix.iii-p8.5"></span>σίκερα, I fully agree with those who think that,
like the Hebrew word <span id="ix.iii-p8.6"></span>שכר, it denotes any
sort of manufactured wine.

<span id="ix.iii-p9"></span>*He shall be filled with the Holy Ghost*
These words, I think, convey nothing more than that John would manifest
such a disposition as would hold out the hope of future greatness. By
disposition I mean not such as is found even in ungodly men, but what
corresponds to the excellence of his office. The meaning is, the power
and grace of the Spirit will appear in him not only when he shall enter
upon his public employment, but even from the womb he shall excel in the
gifts of the Spirit, which will be a token and pledge of his future
character. *From the womb,* means from his earliest infancy. The power
of the Spirit, I acknowledge, did operate in John, while he was yet in
his mother’s womb; but here, in my opinion, the angel meant something
else, that John, even when a child, would be brought forward to the
public gaze, accompanied by extraordinary commendation of the grace of
God. As to *fullness,* there is no occasion for entering into the subtle
disputations, or rather the trifling, of the sophists; for Scripture
conveys nothing more by this word than the pre-eminent and very uncommon
abundance of the gifts of the Spirit. We know, that to Christ alone the
Spirit was given without measure, (<span id="ix.iii-p9.1"></span>[Joh
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#034)<span id="ix.iii-p9.1"></span>,.md)
that we may draw out of his fullness, (<span
id="ix.iii-p9.2"></span>[Joh 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016.md)<span
id="ix.iii-p9.2"></span>;) while to others it is distributed according
to a fixed measure, (<span id="ix.iii-p9.3"></span>[1Co
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#011.md)<span id="ix.iii-p9.3"></span>;
<span id="ix.iii-p9.4"></span>[Eph
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#007)<span id="ix.iii-p9.4"></span>..md)
But those who are more plentifully endued with grace beyond the ordinary
capacity, are said to be full of the Holy Ghost. Now, as the more
plentiful influence of the Spirit was in John an extraordinary gift of
God, it ought to be observed that the Spirit is not bestowed on all from
their very infancy, but only when it pleases God. John bore from the
womb a token of future rank. Saul, while tending the herd, remained long
without any mark of royalty, and, when at length chosen to be king, was
suddenly turned into another man, (<span id="ix.iii-p9.5"></span>[1Sa
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#006)<span id="ix.iii-p9.5"></span>..md)
Let us learn by this example that, from the earliest infancy to the
latest old age, the operation of the Spirit in men is free.

<span id="ix.iii-p10"></span><span id="ix.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p11"></span>**16.** *And many of the children of Israel
shall he bring back* These words show the shamefully dissolute conduct
which then prevailed in the Church, for those in whom conversion to God
could take place must have been apostates. And certainly corrupt
doctrine, depraved morals, and disorderly government, were such as to
render it next to a miracle that a very few continued in godliness. But
if the ancient Church was so awfully dissolute, it is a frivolous
pretext by which the Papists defend their own superstitions, that it is
impossible for the Church to err, particularly since they include under
this designation not the genuine and elect children of God, but the
crowd of the ungodly.

<span id="ix.iii-p12"></span>But John appears to have more ascribed to
him here than belongs to man. For conversion to God renews men to a
spiritual fife, and therefore is not only God’s own work, but surpasses
even the creation of men. In this way ministers might seem to be made
equal, and even superior, to God viewed as Creator; since to be born
again to a heavenly life is a greater work than to be born as mortals on
the earth. The answer is easy; for when the Lord bestows so great praise
on the outward doctrine, he does not separate it from the secret
influence of his Spirit. As God chooses men to be his ministers whose
services he employs for the edification of his Church, he at the same
time operates by them, through the secret influence of his Spirit, that
their labors may be efficacious and fruitful. Wherever Scripture
applauds this efficacy in the ministry of men, let us learn to attribute
it to the grace of the Spirit, without which the voice of man would have
spent itself uselessly in the air. Thus, when Paul boasts that he is a
minister of the Spirit, (<span id="ix.iii-p12.1"></span>[2Co
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006)<span id="ix.iii-p12.1"></span>,.md)
he claims nothing separately for himself, as if by his voice he
penetrated into the hearts of men, but asserts the power and grace of
the Spirit in his ministry. These expressions are worthy of remark;
because Satan labors, with amazing contrivance, to lower the effect of
doctrine, in order that the grace of the Spirit connected with it may be
weakened. The outward preaching, I acknowledge, can do nothing
separately or by itself; but as it is an instrument of divine power for
our salvation, and through the grace of the spirit an efficacious
instrument, *what God hath joined together let us not put asunder,*
(<span id="ix.iii-p12.2"></span>[Mt
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006)<span id="ix.iii-p12.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.iii-p13"></span>That the glory of conversion and faith, on
the other hand, may remain undivided with God alone, Scripture
frequently reminds us that ministers are nothing in themselves; but in
such cases he compares them with *God,* that no one may wickedly steal
the honor from God and convey it to them. In short, those whom God, by
the aid of the minister, converts to himself, are said to be converted
by the minister, because he is nothing more than the hand of God; and
both are expressly asserted in this passage. Of the efficacy of the
doctrine we have now said enough. That it lies not in the will and power
of the minister to bring men back to God, we conclude from this that
John did not indiscriminately bring all back, (which he would
unquestionably have done, if every thing had yielded to his wish,) but
only brought those back whom it pleased the Lord effectually to call. In
a word, what is here taught by the angel is laid down by Paul in his
Epistle to the Romans, that faith cometh by hearing, (<span
id="ix.iii-p13.1"></span>[Ro
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017)<span id="ix.iii-p13.1"></span>,.md)
but that those only to whom the Lord inwardly reveals his arm (<span
id="ix.iii-p13.2"></span>[Isa
53:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.iii-p13.2"></span>;
<span id="ix.iii-p13.3"></span>[Joh
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#038)<span id="ix.iii-p13.3"></span>.md)
are so enlightened as to believe.

<span id="ix.iii-p14"></span><span id="ix.iii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p15"></span>**17.** *And he shall go before him* By
these words he points out what would be John’s office, and distinguishes
him by this mark from the other prophets, who received a certain and
peculiar commission, while John was sent for the sole object of going
before Christ, as a herald before a king. Thus also the Lord speaks by
Malachi,

<span id="ix.iii-p16"></span>“Behold, I will send my messenger, and he
shall prepare the way before me,”  
(<span id="ix.iii-p16.2"></span>[Mal
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001)<span id="ix.iii-p16.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.iii-p17"></span>In short, the calling of John had no other
design than to secure for Christ a willing ear, and to prepare for him
disciples. As to the angel making no express mention of Christ in this
passage, but declaring John to be the usher or standard-bearer of the
eternal God, we learn from it the eternal divinity of Christ. *With the
spirit and power of Elijah* By the words *spirit and power,* I
understand the power or excellency of the Spirit, with which Elijah was
endued; for we must not here indulge in a dream like that of Pythagoras,
that the soul of the prophet passed into the body of John, but the same
Spirit of God, who had acted efficaciously in Elijah, afterwards exerted
a similar power and efficacy in the Baptist. The latter term, *power,*
is added, by way of exposition, to denote the kind of grace which was
the loftiest distinction of Elijah, that, furnished with heavenly power,
he restored in a wonderful manner the decayed worship of God; for such a
restoration was beyond human ability. What John undertook was not less
astonishing; and, therefore, we ought not to wonder if it was necessary
for him to enjoy the same gift.

<span id="ix.iii-p18"></span>*That he may bring back the hearts of the
fathers* Here the angel points out the chief resemblance between John
and Elijah. He declares that he was sent to collect the scattered people
into the unity of faith: for to *bring back the hearts of the fathers*
is to restore them from discord to reconciliation; from which it
follows, that there had been some division which rent and tore asunder
the people. We know how dreadful was the revolt of the people in the
time of Elijah, how basely they had degenerated from the fathers, so as
hardly to deserve to be reckoned the children of Abraham. Those who were
thus disunited Elijah brought into holy harmony. Such was the reunion of
parents with children, which was begun by John, and at length finished
by Christ. Accordingly, when Malachi speaks of “turning the hearts of
the fathers to the children,” (<span id="ix.iii-p18.1"></span>[Mal
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#005)<span id="ix.iii-p18.1"></span>,.md)
he intimates that the Church would be in a state of confusion when
another Elijah should appear; and what was that state is plain enough
from history, and will more fully appear in the proper place. The
doctrine of Scripture had degenerated through countless inventions, the
worship of God was corrupted by very gross superstition, religion was
divided into various sects, priests were openly wicked and Epicureans,
the people indulged in every kind of wickedness; in short, nothing
remained sound. The expression, *bring back the hearts of the fathers to
the children,* is not literally true; for it was rather the *children*
who had broken the covenant and departed from the right faith of their
fathers, that needed to be *brought back* But though the Evangelist does
not so literally express that order of *bringing back,* the meaning is
abundantly obvious, that, by the instrumentality of John, God would
again unite in holy harmony those who had previously been disunited.
Both clauses occur in the prophet Malachi, who meant nothing more than
to express a mutual agreement.

<span id="ix.iii-p19"></span>But as men frequently enter into mutual
conspiracies which drive them farther from God, the angel explains, at
the same time, the nature of that *bringing back* which he predicts,
*the disobedient to the wisdom of the just.* This deserves attention,
that we may not foolishly allow ourselves to be classed with ungodly men
under a false pretense of harmony. Peace is a sounding and imposing
term, and, whenever the Papists meet with it in scripture, they eagerly
seize upon it for the purpose of raising dislike against us, as if we,
who are endeavoring to withdraw the world from its base revolt, and
bring it back to Christ, were the authors of divisions. But this passage
affords a fine exposure of their folly, when the angel explains the
manner of a genuine and proper conversion; and declares its support and
link to be *the wisdom of the just* Accursed then be the peace and unity
by which men agree among themselves apart from God.

<span id="ix.iii-p20"></span>By *the wisdom of the just* is
unquestionably meant Faith, as, on the contrary, by the *disobedient*
are meant Unbelievers. And certainly this is a remarkable encomium on
faith, by which we are instructed, that then only are we truly wise unto
righteousness when we obey the word of the Lord. The world too has its
wisdom, but a perverse and therefore destructive wisdom, which is ever
pronounced to be vanity; though the angel indirectly asserts that the
shadowy wisdom, in which the children of the world delight, is depraved
and accursed before God. This is therefore a settled point, that, with
the view of becoming reconciled to each other, men ought first to return
to peace with God.

<span id="ix.iii-p21"></span>What immediately follows about *making
ready a people prepared for the Lord,* agrees with that clause, that
John, as the herald of Christ, would *go before* his face, (<span
id="ix.iii-p21.1"></span>[Mal 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.iii-p21.1"></span>;) for the design of his preaching was to make
the people attentive to hear the instruction of Christ. The Greek
participle <span id="ix.iii-p21.2"></span>κατεσκευασμένον, it is true,
does not so properly mean perfection as the form and adaptation by which
things are fitted for their use. This meaning will not agree ill with
the present passage. John was commissioned to fit or mould to Christ a
people which, formerly ignorant and uneducated, had never shown a desire
to learn.
