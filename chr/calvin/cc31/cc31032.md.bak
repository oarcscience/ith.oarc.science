<span id="ix.xxiv-p1"></span>MATTHEW 2:19-23

<span id="ix.xxiv-p2"></span><span id="ix.xxiv-p2.1"></span>[Matthew
2:19-23](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#019.md)<span id="ix.xxiv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxiv-p3"></span>**19**.** **But when Herod was dead, lo,
the angel of the Lord appeareth, by a dream, to Joseph in Egypt,
**20**.** **Saying, Arise, and take the child and his mother, and go
into the land of Israel: for they are dead who sought the life  <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) , of the child. **21**.** **And he
rose and took  <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) the child and his
mother, and came into the land of Israel. **22**.** **But when he had
heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in the room of his father
Herod, he was afraid to go thither: but, warned by a heavenly
communication through a dream, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee.
**23**.** **Having come there, he dwelt in the city  <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) which is called Nazareth, that what
had been spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, He shall be called a
Nazarene.

<span id="ix.xxiv-p7"></span> 

<span id="ix.xxiv-p8"></span><span id="ix.xxiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxiv-p9"></span>**19.** *But when Herod was dead* These
words show the perseverance of Joseph’s faith. He kept his feet firm in
Egypt, till he was recalled to his native country by a command of God.
We see, at the same time, that the Lord never disappoints his own
people, but renders them seasonable aid. It is probable that Joseph
returned from Egypt immediately after the death of Herod, before
Augustus Caesar had issued his decree, appointing Archelaus to be
governor of Judea. Having been declared by his father’s will to be
successor to the throne, he undertook the whole charge of the
government, but abstained from taking the title of king, saying that
this depended on the will and pleasure of Caesar. He afterwards went to
Rome, and obtained confirmation; only the name of king was refused,
until he had merited it by his actions. The governor of Galilee was
Philip, a man of gentle disposition, and almost like a private
individual. Joseph complied with the suggestion of the angel, because,
under a prince who had no delight in shedding blood, and who treated his
subjects with mildness, there was less danger.

<span id="ix.xxiv-p10"></span>We must always bear in mind the purpose of
God, in training his Son, from the commencement, under the discipline of
the cross, because this was the way in which he was to redeem his
Church. He bore our infirmities, and was exposed to dangers and to
fears, that he might deliver his Church from them by his divine power,
and might bestow upon it everlasting peace. His danger was our safety:
his fear was our confidence. Not that he ever in his life felt alarm;
but as he was surrounded, on every hand, by the fear of Joseph and Mary,
he may be justly said to have taken upon him our fears, that he might
procure for us assured confidence.

<span id="ix.xxiv-p11"></span><span id="ix.xxiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxiv-p12"></span>**23.** *He shall be called a Nazarene*
Matthew does not derive *Nazarene* from *Nazareth,* as if this were its
strict and proper etymology, but only makes an allusion. The word <span
id="ix.xxiv-p12.1"></span>נזיר, or *Nazarite,* signifies *holy and
devoted to God,* and is derived from <span
id="ix.xxiv-p12.2"></span>נזר, *to separate.* The noun <span
id="ix.xxiv-p12.3"></span>נזר, indeed, signifies a *flower:*  <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) but Matthew refers, beyond all doubt,
to the former meaning. For we nowhere read that *Nazarites* meant
*blooming* or *flourishing,* but persons who were *consecrated to God,*
according to the directions given by the Law, (<span
id="ix.xxiv-p13.7"></span>[Nu
6:1-21](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.xxiv-p13.7"></span>) The meaning is: though it was by fear that
Joseph was driven into a corner of Galilee, yet God had a higher design,
and appointed *the city of Nazareth* as the place of Christ’s residence,
that he might justly be called a *Nazarite* But it is asked, who are the
prophets that gave this name to Christ? for there is no passage to be
found that answers to the quotation. Some think it a sufficient answer,
that Scripture frequently calls him *Holy:* but that is a very poor
explanation. For Matthew, as we perceive, makes an express reference to
the very word, and to the ancient Nazarites, whose holiness was of a
peculiar character. He tells us, that what was then shadowed out in the
Nazarites, who were, in some sense, selected as the first-fruits to God,
must have been fulfilled in the person of Christ.

<span id="ix.xxiv-p14"></span>But it remains to be seen, in what part of
Scripture the prophets have stated that this name would be given to
Christ. Chrysostom, finding himself unable to loose the knot, cuts it by
saying, that many books of the prophets have perished. But this answer
has no probability: for, though the Lord, in order to punish the
indifference of his ancient people, deprived them of some part of
Scripture, or left out what was less necessary, yet, since the coming of
Christ, no part of it has been lost. In support of that view, a strange
blunder has been made, by quoting a passage of Josephus, in which he
states that Ezekiel left two books: for Ezekiel’s prophecy of a new
temple and kingdom is manifestly distinct from his other predictions,
and may be said to form a new work. But if all the books of Scripture
which were extant in the time of Matthew, remain entire to the present
day, we must find somewhere the passage quoted from the prophets.

<span id="ix.xxiv-p15"></span>*Bucer*  <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) has explained it, I think, more
correctly than any other writer. He thinks that the reference is to a
passage in the Book of Judges: *The child shall be a Nazarite unto God
from the womb,* (<span id="ix.xxiv-p16.1"></span>[Jud
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005)<span id="ix.xxiv-p16.1"></span>..md)
These words, no doubt, were spoken with regard to Samson. But Samson is
called the “Redeemer” or “Deliverer”  <span
id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) of the people, only because he was a
figure of Christ, and because the salvation, which was accomplished by
his instrumentality, was a sort of prelude of the full salvation, which
was at length exhibited to the world by the Son of God.  <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) All that Scripture predicts, in a
favorable manner, about Samson, may justly be applied to Christ. To
express it more clearly, Christ is the original model: Samson is the
inferior antitype.  <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) When he
assumed the character of a *Redeemer,*  <span
id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) we ought to understand, that none of
the titles bestowed on that illustrious and truly divine office apply so
strictly to himself as to Christ: for the fathers did but taste the
grace of redemption, which we have been permitted to receive fully in
Christ.

<span id="ix.xxiv-p21"></span>Matthew uses the word *prophets* in the
plural number. This may easily be excused: for the Book of Judges was
composed by many *prophets.* But I think that what is here said about
*the prophets* has a still wider reference. For Joseph, who was a
temporal Savior of the Church, and was, in many respects, a figure, or
rather a lively image of Christ, is called *a Nazarite of his brethren,*
 <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) (<span
id="ix.xxiv-p22.4"></span>[Ge
49:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#026.md)<span id="ix.xxiv-p22.4"></span>;
<span id="ix.xxiv-p22.5"></span>[De
33:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#016.md)<span
id="ix.xxiv-p22.5"></span>.) God determined that the distinguished
honor, of which he had given a specimen in Joseph, should shine again in
Samson, and gave him the name of *Nazarite,* that believers, having
received those early instructions, might look more earnestly at the
Redeemer who was to come, who was to be *separated* from all,

<span id="ix.xxiv-p23"></span>“That he might be the first-born among
many brethren,”  
(<span id="ix.xxiv-p23.2"></span>[Ro
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029)<span id="ix.xxiv-p23.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.xxiv-p4"></span> “<span id="ix.xxiv-p4.1"></span>Qui
demandoyent l’ame, *ou la vie,* du petit enfant;” — “who demanded the
soul, *or the life,* of the little child.”

<span id="fn_218"></span>[219](cc31032.htm#fr_218.md) <span
id="ix.xxiv-p4.2"></span>

<span id="ix.xxiv-p5"></span> “<span id="ix.xxiv-p5.1"></span>Surgens
assumpsit;” — “rising took.” — “<span id="ix.xxiv-p5.2"></span>Joseph
donc esveille print;” — “Joseph then awakened took.”

id="ix.xxiv-p12.4"></span>

<span id="ix.xxiv-p13"></span> It would have been more correct to say
that the noun <span id="ix.xxiv-p13.1"></span>נזר signifies *a crown*
than a flower. *“Thou* shalt put *the holy crown,”* <span
id="ix.xxiv-p13.2"></span>את נזר הקדש, (<span
id="ix.xxiv-p13.3"></span>[Ex
29:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#006)<span id="ix.xxiv-p13.3"></span>..md)
“Thou hast profaned *his crown,”* <span id="ix.xxiv-p13.4"></span>נזרו,
(<span id="ix.xxiv-p13.5"></span>[Ps
89:39](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#039.md)<span
id="ix.xxiv-p13.5"></span>.) It is satisfactory to have the support of
so eminent a critic as Dr Tholuck, who, in his very correct edition of
Calvin's Commentary on the New Testament, after the word florem,
*flower,* places in brackets an emendation similar to what we have
suggested: “<span id="ix.xxiv-p13.6"></span>*vel potius, diadematis
insigne,”* —*”*or rather, the emblem of a crown.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_221"></span>[222](cc31032.htm#fr_221.md) <span
id="ix.xxiv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxiv-p16"></span> A contemporary of our author, who was
greatly admired, not only for the extent of his learning in a very
learned age, but for the soundness of his judgment. He is hardly ever
mentioned but with deep respect. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_222"></span>[223](cc31032.htm#fr_222.md) <span
id="ix.xxiv-p16.2"></span>

<span id="ix.xxiv-p17"></span> The remaining words of the passage (<span
id="ix.xxiv-p17.1"></span>[Jud
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#005)<span id="ix.xxiv-p17.1"></span>.md)
are: *and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hands of the
Philistines;* which our author interprets as having a prophetic
reference to Christ. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_223"></span>[224](cc31032.htm#fr_223.md) <span
id="ix.xxiv-p17.2"></span>

<span id="ix.xxiv-p18"></span> “<span id="ix.xxiv-p18.1"></span>Le salut
qu'a receu le peuple par son moyen, a este comme une representation
ayant quelques traces du vray et parfait salut, lequel finalement le
Fils de Dieu a apporte et presente au monde.” — “The salvation which the
people received by his agency was, as it were, a representation, having
some traces of the true and perfect salvation, which the Son of God
finally brought and presented to the world.”

<span id="fn_224"></span>[225](cc31032.htm#fr_224.md) <span
id="ix.xxiv-p18.2"></span>

<span id="ix.xxiv-p19"></span> “<span id="ix.xxiv-p19.1"></span>Pour le
dire plus clairement en deux mots, Christ est le vray patron accompli en
perfection, mais Samson est un pourtrait legerement tire et trac,
dessus.” — “To state it more clearly in two words, Christ is the true
Defender fulfilled in perfection: but Samson is a portrait lightly
traced and drawn below.”

<span id="fn_225"></span>[226](cc31032.htm#fr_225.md) <span
id="ix.xxiv-p19.2"></span>

<span id="ix.xxiv-p20"></span> Deliverer.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[227](cc31032.htm#fr_226.md) <span
id="ix.xxiv-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ix.xxiv-p22"></span> In both of the passages quoted above, the
words <span id="ix.xxiv-p22.1"></span>נזיר אחיו are rendered, in the
English version, *separated from his brethren.* This brings out pretty
faithfully the meaning of <span id="ix.xxiv-p22.2"></span>נזיר,
*separated,* but does not suggest the allusion, which Calvin supposes to
be made to the peculiar acceptation given by the ceremonial law to <span
id="ix.xxiv-p22.3"></span>נזיר, from which our word *Nazarite* is
derived. Hebrew scholars must judge for themselves as to the probability
of the allusion. Without entering into that inquiry, which would occupy
more space than we could easily spare, we have thought it due to our
Author to hint, that the two passages which he quotes, and which at
first sight appear to have no bearing on his argument, contain the very
*word* in questlon. — *Ed.*
