<span id="ix.v-p1"></span>LUKE 1:21-25

<span id="ix.v-p2"></span><span id="ix.v-p2.1"></span>[Luke
1:21-25](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#021.md)<span id="ix.v-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p3"></span>**21**.** **And the people were waiting for
Zacharias, and wondered that he tarried in the temple. **22**.** **And
when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they perceived that he
had seen a vision in the temple. And he made them to understand by
signs,  <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) and remained speechless.
**23**.** **And it happened, when the days of his office were fulfilled,
he departed to his own house. **24**.** **Now after these days Elisabeth
his wife conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,
**25**.** **Thus hath the Lord done to me in the days when he looked,
that he might take away my reproach among men.

<span id="ix.v-p5"></span> 

<span id="ix.v-p6"></span><span id="ix.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p7"></span>**21.** *And the people were waiting* Luke now
relates that the people were witnesses of this vision. Zacharias had
tarried in the temple longer than usual. This leads to the supposition
that something uncommon has happened to him. When he comes out, he makes
known, by looks and gestures, that he has been struck dumb. There is
reason to believe, also, that there were traces of alarm in his
countenance. Hence they conclude that God has appeared to him. True,
there were few or no visions in that age, but the people remembered that
formerly, in the time of their fathers, they were of frequent
occurrence. It is not without reason, therefore, that they draw this
conclusion from obvious symptoms: for it was not an ordinary occurrence,
\[it was not a common accident, but rather an astonishing work of God,
 <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) \] that he became suddenly dumb
without disease, and after a more than ordinary delay came out of the
temple in a state of amazement. The word *temple,* as we have already
mentioned, is put for the sanctuary, where the altar of incense stood,
(<span id="ix.v-p8.2"></span>[Ex
30:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo030.htm#001)<span id="ix.v-p8.2"></span>..md)
From this place the priests, after performing their sacred functions,
were wont to go out into their own court, for the purpose of blessing
the people.

<span id="ix.v-p9"></span><span id="ix.v-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p10"></span>**23.** *When the days were fulfilled* <span
id="ix.v-p10.1"></span>Λειτουργία is employed by Luke to denote a charge
or office, which passed, as we have said, to each of them in regular
order, (<span id="ix.v-p10.2"></span>[1Ch
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/ch1024.htm#003)<span id="ix.v-p10.2"></span>..md) We
are told that, when the time of his office had expired, Zacharias
returned home. Hence we conclude that, so long as the priests were
attending in their turns, they did not enter their own houses, that they
might be entirely devoted and attached to the worship of God. For this
purpose galleries were constructed around the walls of the temple, in
which they had “chambers,” (<span id="ix.v-p10.3"></span>[1Ki
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1006.htm#005)<span id="ix.v-p10.3"></span>..md) The
law did not, indeed, forbid a priest to enter his house, but, as it did
not permit those who ate the show-bread to come near their wives, (<span
id="ix.v-p10.4"></span>[1Sa 21:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#004.md)<span
id="ix.v-p10.4"></span>,) and as many persons were disposed to treat
sacred things in an irreverent manner, this was probably discovered to
be a remedy, that, being removed from all temptations, they might
preserve themselves pure and clear from every defilement. And they were
not only discharged from intercourse with their wives, but from the use
of wine and every kind of intoxicating drink, (<span
id="ix.v-p10.5"></span>[Le 10:9](../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#009.md)<span
id="ix.v-p10.5"></span>.) While they were commanded to change their mode
of living, it was advantageous for them not to depart from the temple,
that the very sight of the place might remind them to cultivate such
purity as the Lord had enjoined. It was proper also to withdraw every
means of gratification, that they might devote themselves more
unreservedly to their office.

<span id="ix.v-p11"></span>The Papists of the present day employ this as
a pretense for defending the tyrannical law of celibacy. They argue
thus. The priests were formerly enjoined to withdraw from their wives,
while they were engaged in religious services. Most properly is
perpetual continence now demanded from the priests, who not in their
turn, but every day, offer sacrifices; more especially since the
importance of religious services is far higher than it was under the
law. But I should like to know why they do not also abstain from wine
and strong drink. For we are not at liberty to separate commandments
which God has joined, so as to keep the one half and disregard the
other. Intercourse with wives is not so expressly forbidden as the
drinking of wine, (<span id="ix.v-p11.1"></span>[Eze
44:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze044.htm#021)<span id="ix.v-p11.1"></span>..md)
If, under the pretense of the law, the Pope enjoins celibacy on his
priests, why does he allow them wine? Nay, on this principle, all
priests ought to be thrown into some retired apartments of the churches,
to pass their whole life immured in prisons, and excluded from the
society of women and of the people.

<span id="ix.v-p12"></span>It is now abundantly clear that they wickedly
shelter themselves under the law of God, to which they do not adhere.
But the full solution of the difficulty depends on the distinction
between the law and the gospel. A priest stood in the presence of God,
to expiate the sins of the people, to be, as it were, a mediator between
God and men. He who sustained that character ought to have had something
peculiar about him, that he might be distinguished from the common rank
of men, and recognised as a figure of the true Mediator. Such, too, was
the design of the holy garments and the anointing. In our day the public
ministers and pastors of the church have nothing of this description. I
speak of the ministers whom Christ has appointed to feed his flock, not
of those whom the Pope commissions, as executioners rather than priests,
to murder Christ. Let us therefore rest in the decision of the Spirit,
which pronounces that “marriage is honorable in all,” (<span
id="ix.v-p12.1"></span>[Heb 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#004.md)<span
id="ix.v-p12.1"></span>.)

<span id="ix.v-p13"></span><span id="ix.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p14"></span>**24.** *And hid herself* This appears very
strange, as if she had been ashamed of the blessing of God. Some think
that she did not, venture to appear in public, so long as the matter was
uncertain, for fear of exposing herself to ridicule, if her expectation
were disappointed. In my opinion, she was so fully convinced of the
promise made to her, that she had no doubt of its accomplishment. When
she saw a severe punishment inflicted on her husband for *“*speaking
unadvisedly with his lips,” (<span id="ix.v-p14.1"></span>[Ps
106:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#033)<span id="ix.v-p14.1"></span>,.md)
did she, for five successive months, cherish in her mind a similar
doubt? But her words show clearly that her expectation was not doubtful
or uncertain. By saying, *thus hath the Lord done to me,* she expressly
and boldly affirms that his favor was ascertained. There might be two
reasons for the delay. Until this extraordinary work of God was
manifest, she might hesitate to expose it to the diversified opinions of
men, for the world frequently indulges in light, rash, and irreverent
talking about the works of God. Another reason might be that, when she
was all at once discovered to be pregnant, men might be more powerfully
excited to praise God. \[For, when the works of God show themselves
gradually, in process of time we make less account of them than if the
thing had been accomplished all at once, without our having ever heard
of it—*Fr*.\] It was not, therefore, on her own account, but rather with
a view to others, that Elisabeth *hid herself*

<span id="ix.v-p15"></span><span id="ix.v-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p16"></span>**25.** *Thus hath the Lord done to me* She
extols in private the goodness of God, until the time is fully come for
making it generally known. There is reason to believe that her husband
had informed her by writing of the promised offspring, in consequence of
which she affirms with greater certainty and freedom that God was the
author of this favor. This is confirmed by the following words, *when he
looked, that he might take away my reproach;* for she assigns it as the
cause of her barrenness that the favor of God had been at that time
withdrawn from her. Among earthly blessings, Scripture speaks in the
highest terms of the gift of offspring. And justly: for, if the
productiveness of the inferior animals is his blessing, the increase and
fruitfulness of the human race ought to be reckoned a much higher favor.
It is no small or mean honor, that God, who alone is entitled to be
regarded as a Father, admits the children of the dust to share with him
this title. Let us, therefore, hold this doctrine, that

<span id="ix.v-p17"></span>“children are an heritage of the Lord,  
and the fruit of the womb is his reward,”  
(<span id="ix.v-p17.3"></span>[Ps
127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003)<span id="ix.v-p17.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.v-p18"></span>But Elisabeth looked farther; for, though
barren and old, she had conceived by a remarkable miracle, and contrary
to the ordinary course of nature.

<span id="ix.v-p19"></span>*That he might take away my reproach* Not
without reason has barrenness been always accounted a *reproach:* for
the blessing of the womb is enumerated among the signal instances of the
divine kindness. Some think that this was peculiar to the ancient
people: because Christ was to come from the seed of Abraham. But this
had no reference, except to the tribe of Judah. Others think more
correctly that the multiplication of the holy people was happy and
blessed, as was said to Abraham, “I will make thy seed as the dust of
the earth,” (<span id="ix.v-p19.1"></span>[Ge
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#016)<span id="ix.v-p19.1"></span>;.md)
and again,

<span id="ix.v-p20"></span>“Tell the stars, if thou be able to number
them: so shall thy seed be,”  
(<span id="ix.v-p20.2"></span>[Ge
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005)<span id="ix.v-p20.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.v-p21"></span>But we ought to connect the universal
blessing, which extends to the whole human race, with the promise made
to Abraham, which is peculiar to the church of God, (<span
id="ix.v-p21.1"></span>[Ge 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015.md)<span
id="ix.v-p21.1"></span>.) Let parents learn to be thankful to God for
the children which he has given them, and let those who have no
offspring acknowledge that God has humbled them in this matter.
Elisabeth speaks of it exclusively as a reproach *among men:* for it is
a temporal chastisement, from which we will suffer no loss in the
kingdom of heaven.
