<span id="ix.lxxiv-p5"></span>**1**.** **And entering into a ship, he
passed over, and came into his own city. **2**.** **And, lo, they
brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their
faith, he said to the paralytic, Take courage, my son, thy sins are
forgiven thee. **3**.** **And, lo, some of the scribes said among
themselves, This man blasphemeth. **4**.** **And when Jesus saw their
thoughts, he said, Why do you think evil in your hearts? **5**.** **For
whether is it easier to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say,
Arise, and walk? **6**.** **But that you may know that the Son of man
hath authority on earth to forgive sins, (then he saith to the
paralytic,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go away to thy house.
**7**.** **And he arose, and went away to his house. **8**.** **And the
multitudes who saw it wondered, and glorified God, who had given such
authority to men.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p6"></span>**1**.** **And again he entered into
Capernaum after some days; and it was reported that he was in the house.
**2**.** **And immediately many were assembled, so that the places which
were around the door did not now contain them, and he preached the word
to them. **3**.** **And they come to him, bringing a paralytic, who was
carried by four persons. **4**.** **And when they could not approach him
on account of the crowd, they uncovered the roof of the house in which
he was, and having made an opening in the roof, they lower the couch on
which the paralytic lay. **5**.** **And when Jesus saw their faith, he
said to the paralytic, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee. **6**.** **And
some of the scribes were sitting there, and thinking  <span
id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) in their hearts, **7**.** **Why does
this man thus speak blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?
**8**.** **And immediately when Jesus knew by his Spirit that they
thought thus within themselves, he said to them, Why do you think those
things in your hearts? **9**.** **Whether it is easier to say to the
paralytic, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Rise, and take up thy
bed, and walk? **10**.** **But that you may know that the Son of man
hath authority on earth to forgive sins, (he saith to the paralytic,)
**11**.** **I say to thee, Arise, take up thy bed, and go away to thy
house. **12**.** **And immediately he arose, and having taken up the
bed, went out in the presence of all, so that all were astonished, and
glorified God, saying, We never saw such a thing.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p8"></span>**17**.** **And it happened on a certain
day, and he was teaching: and Pharisees and doctors of the law were
sitting, who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judea, and
from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
**18**.** **And, lo, men carrying on a bed, a man who was a paralytic,
and they sought to bring him in, and to place him before him.
**19**.** **And not finding a way by which they could bring him in on
account of the crowd, they went up to the roof, and lowered him by cords
with the bed into the midst before Jesus. **20**.** **And when he saw
their faith, he said to him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
**21**.** **And the scribes and Pharisees began to think, saying, Who is
this that speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?
**22**.** **And when Jesus knew their thoughts, he answering said to
them, What do you think in your hearts? **23**.** **Whether it is easier
to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise, and walk?
**24**.** **But that you may know that the Son of man hath authority on
earth, (he saith to the paralytic,) I say to thee, Arise, take up thy
bed, and go to thy house. **25**.** **And immediately rising up before
them, he took up the bed on which he had been lying, and went away to
his own house, glorifying God. **26**.** **And amazement seized all, and
they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen
incredible things today.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p9"></span> 

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p10"></span><span id="ix.lxxiv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p11"></span>**<span
id="ix.lxxiv-p11.2"></span>[Matthew
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.lxxiv-p11.2"></span>.** *And came into his own city.* This
passage shows, that *Capernaum* was generally believed to be the
birth-place of Christ, because his visits to it were frequent: for there
is no room to doubt, that it is the same history which is related by the
three Evangelists, though some circumstances may be more exactly related
by one of them than by another. Luke says that scribes had come from
various parts of Judea, who were spectators when Christ *healed* the
p*aralytic;* and at the same time states indirectly, that there were
others who also received *healing* through the grace of Christ. For,
before he comes to the *paralytic,* he speaks in the plural number, and
says, that the power of God was displayed for healing *their* diseases;
*the power of the Lord was present to heal them* The glory of this
miracle was very remarkable. A man destitute of the use of all his
limbs, lying on a bed, and lowered by cords, suddenly rises up in
health, vigor, and agility. Another special reason why the Evangelists
dwell more on this miracle than on others is, that the scribes were
offended at Christ for claiming power and *authority to forgive sins;*
while Christ intended to confirm and seal that authority by a visible
sign.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p12"></span><span id="ix.lxxiv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p13"></span>**2.** *And when Jesus saw their faith.*
It is God alone, indeed, who knows *faith:* but they had given evidence
of *faith* by the laboriousness of that attempt: for they would never
have submitted to so much trouble, nor contended with such formidable
hindrances, if they had not derived courage from entire confidence of
success. The fruit of their faith appeared in their not being wearied
out, when they found the entrance closed up on all sides. The view which
some take of these words, that Christ, as a divine person, knew their
faith, which lay concealed within them, appears to me a forced
interpretation.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p14"></span>Now, as Christ granted to their *faith*
the favor which he bestowed on the p*aralytic,* a question is usually
raised on this passage how far do men derive advantage from the faith of
others? And, first, it is certain, that the faith of Abraham was of
advantage to his posterity, when he embraced the free covenant offered
to him and to his seed. We must hold a similar belief with regard to all
believers, that, by their faith, the grace of God is extended to their
children and their children’s children even before they are born. The
same thing takes place in infants, who are not yet of such an age as to
be capable of faith. With regard to adults, on the other hand, who have
no faith of their own, (whether they be strangers, or allied by blood,)
the faith of others can have nothing more than an indirect influence in
promoting the eternal salvation of their souls. As the prayers, by which
we ask that God will turn unbelievers to repentance, are not without
advantage, our faith is evidently of such advantage to them, that they
do not arrive at salvation, till they have been made partakers of the
same faith with us in answer to our prayers. But where there is a mutual
agreement in faith, it is well known that they promote the salvation of
each other. It is also beyond all question, that earthly blessings are
often, for the sake of the godly, bestowed on unbelievers.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p15"></span>With regard to the present passage,
though Christ is said to have been moved by the faith of others, yet the
*paralytic* could not have obtained *the forgiveness of his sins,* if he
had had no faith of his own. Unworthy persons were often restored by
Christ to health of body, as God daily *maketh his sun to rise on the
evil and the good,* (<span id="ix.lxxiv-p15.1"></span>[Mt
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045)<span id="ix.lxxiv-p15.1"></span>.md)
but there is no other way in which he is reconciled to us than by faith.
There is a *synecdoche,* therefore, in the word *their,* when it is said
that *Jesus saw their faith:* for Christ not only looked at those who
brought the paralytic, but looked also at *his* faith.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p16"></span>*Thy sins are forgiven thee*. Christ
appears here to promise to the paralytic something different from what
he had requested: but, as he intends to bestow health of body, he begins
with removing the cause of the disease, and at the same time reminds the
paralytic of the origin of his disease, and of the manner in which he
ought to arrange his prayers. As men usually do not consider that the
afflictions which they endure are God’s chastisements, they desire
nothing more than some alleviation in the flesh, and, in the meantime,
feel no concern about their sins: just as if a sick man were to
disregard his disease, and to seek only relief from present pain.  <span
id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) But the only way of obtaining
deliverance from all evils is to have God reconciled to us. It does
sometimes happen, that wicked men are freed from their distresses, while
God is still their enemy: but when they think that they have completely
escaped, the same evils immediately return, or more numerous and heavier
calamities overwhelm them, which make it manifest that they will not be
mitigated or terminated. until the wrath of God shall be appeased, as
God declares by the Prophet Amos

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p18"></span>If thou escape a lion, a bear shall meet
thee;  
if thou shut thyself up at home, a serpent shall bite thee,  
(<span id="ix.lxxiv-p18.3"></span>[Am
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019.md)<span
id="ix.lxxiv-p18.3"></span>.)

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p19"></span>Thus it appears that this is a frequent
and ordinary way of speaking in the Scriptures, to promise the pardon of
sins, when the mitigation of punishments is sought. It is proper to
attend to this order in our prayers. When the feeling of afflictions
reminds us of our sins, let us first of all be careful to obtain pardon,
that, when God is reconciled to us, he may withdraw his hand from
punishing.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p20"></span><span id="ix.lxxiv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p21"></span>**3.** *And, lo, some of the scribes*
They accuse Christ of blasphemy and sacrilege, because he claims for
himself what is God’s prerogative. The other two Evangelists tell us
also that they said, *Who can forgive sins but God alone? It* is beyond
all question, that their eagerness to slander drove them to this wicked
conclusion. If they think that there is any thing which deserves blame,
why do they not inquire into it?  <span
id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) Besides, as the expression admits of
more than one meaning, and as Christ said nothing more than what the
Prophets frequently say when they announce the grace of God, why do they
take in a bad sense what admits of a favorable interpretation? They must
have been already poisoned by malice and envy, otherwise they would not
so eagerly have seized an occasion of blaming Christ. They remain
silent, but *think in their hearts,* that they may slander him when
absent among people of their own class. It is no doubt true, that God
alone has power and *authority to forgive sins:* but they are wrong in
concluding that it does not belong to Christ, for he is *God manifested
in the flesh,* (<span id="ix.lxxiv-p22.2"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md)<span
id="ix.lxxiv-p22.2"></span>.) They had a right to inquire on what
grounds Christ laid claim to such *authority:* but, without any inquiry,
they suppose him to be one of the common rank of men, and proceed rashly
to condemn him.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p23"></span><span id="ix.lxxiv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p24"></span>**4.** *And when Jesus saw their
thoughts* He now gives a proof of his Divinity in bringing to light
their secret thoughts: *for who knoweth the things of a man but the
spirit of man which is in him?* (<span id="ix.lxxiv-p24.2"></span>[1Co
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#011.md)<span
id="ix.lxxiv-p24.2"></span>.) And so Mark adds, that *Jesus knew by his
Spirit:* which means, that what was concealed in their hearts could not
be perceived by man, but that Christ by his Divine Spirit knew it
thoroughly. *Why do you think evil?* This does not imply that it gave
them pain to see a mortal man assuming what God claims as his own
prerogative, but that they proudly and wickedly rejected God, who was
openly manifested to them.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p25"></span><span id="ix.lxxiv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p26"></span>**5.** *Whether is it easier to say?* The
meaning is, that, as it is not easier to quicken by a word a body which
is nearly dead than to forgive *sins,* there is no reason to wonder that
he *forgives sins,* when he has accomplished the other. The argument
which our Lord uses may appear to be not well-founded: for, in
proportion as the soul is more excellent than the body, the forgiveness
of sins is a greater work than the healing of the body. But the reply is
easy. Christ adapts his discourse to their capacity: for, being carnal,
they were more powerfully affected by outward signs, than by all the
spiritual power of Christ, which related to eternal salvation. Thus he
proves the efficacy of the Gospel for quickening men from the fact, that
at the last day he will raise the dead by his voice out of their graves.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p27"></span>Wonder not at this: for the hour is
coming, in which all who are in the graves shall hear his voice, and
shall come forth,  
(<span id="ix.lxxiv-p27.2"></span>[John
5:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#028.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#029)<span id="ix.lxxiv-p27.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p28"></span>This was a sufficiently powerful argument
to refute those who reckoned a visible miracle of more importance than
all things else. They could not say that he had no right to *forgive the
sins* of the paralytic, when he restored to him health and rigour: for
this was a result which followed from the forgiveness of sins.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p29"></span><span id="ix.lxxiv-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p30"></span>**6.** *That the Son of man hath
authority on earth.* This *authority* is very different from what was
given to the apostles, and from what is now exercised by the pastors of
the Church: for they cannot so properly be said to *pardon sins,* as to
declare that they are pardoned, when they deliver the commission which
is entrusted to them. By these words Christ declares that he is not only
the minister and witness, but likewise the author, of this grace. But
what means this restriction, *on earth?* Of what avail will it be to us
to have obtained pardon here, if it be not ratified in heaven? Christ’s
meaning was, that forgiveness of sins ought not to be sought from a
distance: for he exhibits it to men in his own person, and as it were in
his hands. So strong is our inclination to distrust, that we never
venture to believe that God is merciful to us, till he draws near, and
speaks familiarly to us. Now, as Christ descended to earth for the
purpose of exhibiting to men the *grace* of God as present, he is said
to *forgive sins* visibly, because in him and by him the will of God was
revealed which, according to the perception of the flesh, had been
formerly hidden above the clouds.

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p31"></span><span id="ix.lxxiv-p31.1"></span>

<span id="ix.lxxiv-p32"></span>**8.** *And the multitudes who saw*
Instead of *astonishment* which Matthew mentions,  <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) the other two Evangelists employ the
word <span id="ix.lxxiv-p33.3"></span>ἔκστασις, or amazement: and Luke
adds *fear* But the design of all the Evangelists is to show, that the
power of God was not merely acknowledged, but that all were struck with
*astonishment,* and compelled to give glory to God. *The fear,* which
followed the *astonishment,* had the effect of preventing them from
opposing Christ, and of making them submit to him with reverence as a
Prophet of God. Matthew expressly says, *that they glorified God, who
had given such authority to men* Here they appear to be partly mistaken:
for, though they see a man with their eyes, they ought to have perceived
in him, by the mind, something higher than man. They are no doubt right
in saying, that the nature of man received great honor in Christ for the
general advantage of the human race: but as they do not perceive him to
be *God manifested in the flesh,* (<span id="ix.lxxiv-p33.4"></span>[1Ti
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#006)<span id="ix.lxxiv-p33.4"></span>,.md)
their confession is involved in some error.  <span
id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) In a word, it was true, that *God gave
such authority to* men: but the form and manner of giving was not yet
understood by those who were not aware that the majesty of God was
united to flesh.

a slip of Calvin's pen, and would have been permitted to remain in the
