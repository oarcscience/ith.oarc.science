<span id="viii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 55.

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Isaiah
55:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye
to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea,
come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Heus sitientes omnes, venite ad
aquas; et qui non habetis pecuniam, venite, emite, et comedite. Venite,
inquam; emite absque pecunia, et absque ullo pretio vinum et lac.

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span>**2.** Wherefore do ye spend money for t*hat
which is* not bread? and your labour for *that which* satisfieth not?
hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye *that which* *is* good, and let
your soul delight itself in fatness.

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Quare expenditis pecuniam, non in
panem? et laborem vestrum, non ad saturitatem? Audite audiendo me, et
comedite bonum, et oblectet se pinguedine anima vestra.

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span>**3.** Incline your ear, and come unto me:
hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant
with you, *even* the sure mercies of David.

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Inclinate aurem vestram, et venite ad
me; audite, et vivet anima vestra. Et percutiam vobiscum foedus deculi,
misericordias Davidis fideles.

<span id="viii.i-p8"></span>**4.** Behold, I have given him *for* a
witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.

<span id="viii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Ecce testem populis dedi eum, ducem
et praeceptorem populis.

<span id="viii.i-p10"></span>**5.** Behold, thou shalt call a nation
*that* thou knowest not, and nations *that* knew not thee shall run unto
thee because of the LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he
hath glorified thee.

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Ecce gentem quam ignoras vocabis; et
gens quae to non cognovit current ad to; propter Iehovam Deum tuum, et
Sanctum Israel; quia glorificavit to.

<span id="viii.i-p12"></span>**6.** Seek ye the LORD while he may be
found, call ye upon him while he is near:

<span id="viii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Quaerite Iehovam, dum invenitur;
invocate eum, dum prope est.

<span id="viii.i-p14"></span>**7.** Let the wicked forsake his way, and
the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and
he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly
pardon.

<span id="viii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Derelinquat impius viam suam, et vir
iniquus cogitationes suas; revertatur ad Iehovam, et miserebitur ejus;
ad Deum nostrum, quia multus est ad remittendum.

<span id="viii.i-p16"></span>**8.** For my thoughts *are* not your
thoughts, neither *are* your ways my ways, saith the LORD.

<span id="viii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Neque enim cogitationes meae
cogitationes vestrae, neque viae vestrae viae meae, dicit Iehova.

<span id="viii.i-p18"></span>**9.** For *as* the heavens are higher than
the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than
your thoughts.

<span id="viii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Nam quanto excelsiores sunt coeli
terra, tantum superant viae meae vias vestras, et cogitationes meae
cogitationes vestras.

<span id="viii.i-p20"></span>**10.** For as the rain cometh down, and
the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth,
and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower,
and bread to the eater:

<span id="viii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Certe, quemadmodum descendit pluvia
et nix e coelis, neque illuc revertitur, sed irrigat terram, et eam
facit concipere et germinare, ut det semen seminanti et panem comedenti;

<span id="viii.i-p22"></span>**11.** So shall my word be that goeth
forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall
accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper *in the thing*
whereto I sent it.

<span id="viii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Sic erit verbum meum quod
egredietur ex ore meo; non redibit ad me vacuum, donec faciat quod volo,
et successum afterat, quo misi ipsum.

<span id="viii.i-p24"></span>**12.** For ye shall go out with joy, and
be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth
before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap
*their* hands.

<span id="viii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Itaque cum laetitia egrediemini, et
cum pace deducemini; montes et colles erumpent coram vobis in gaudium,
et omnia ligna agri plaudent manu.

<span id="viii.i-p26"></span>**13.** Instead of the thorn shall come up
the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree:
and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign *that*
shall not be cut off.

<span id="viii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Pro rubo ascendet abies, et pro
urtica (*vel, spina*) myrtus (*vel, ulmus*) crescet; et erit Iehovae in
nomen, in sugnum perpetuum quod non auferetur.

<span id="viii.i-p28"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p29"></span><span id="viii.i-p29.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p30"></span>**1.** *Ho, all that are thirsty.* Here the
Prophet describes in lofty terms of commendation the goodness of God,
which was to be poured down more copiously and abundantly than before
under the reign of Christ, “in whose hand are hid all the treasures”
(<span id="viii.i-p30.1"></span>[Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003)<span id="viii.i-p30.1"></span>.md) of
the grace of God; for in him God fully explains his mind to us; so that
the saying of John is actually fulfilled, “We have all drawn from his
fullness, and have received grace for grace.” (<span
id="viii.i-p30.2"></span>[Joh
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#016)<span id="viii.i-p30.2"></span>.md)
The fathers were, indeed, partakers of that divine goodness and
spiritual kindness which is here mentioned. “How great,” says David, “is
thy goodness, which hath been laid up for them that fear thee!” (<span
id="viii.i-p30.3"></span>[Ps
31:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#019)<span id="viii.i-p30.3"></span>.md)
But he hath poured it out far more liberally and abundantly in Christ.
Thus, it is a remarkable commendation of the grace of God, which is
exhibited to us in the kingdom of Christ; for the Prophet does not
instruct us what has been done once, but also what is done every day,
while the Lord invites us by his doctrine to the enjoyment of all
blessings.

<span id="viii.i-p31"></span>*Come to the waters.* Some view the word
“waters” as referring to the doctrine of the Gospel, and others to the
Holy Spirit; but neither of these expositions, in my opinion, is
correct. They who think that it denotes the doctrine of the Gospel, and
who contrast it with the law, (of which the Jewish writers think that
the Prophet speaks in this passage,) include only one part of what the
Prophet meant. They who expound it as denoting the Holy Spirit have
somewhat more plausibility, and quote that passage of John’s Gospel,

<span id="viii.i-p32"></span>“If thou knewest the gift of God, and who
it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of
him, and he would have given thee living water.” (<span
id="viii.i-p32.1"></span>[Joh
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#010)<span id="viii.i-p32.1"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.i-p33"></span>And a little after, Christ appears to
expound this passage when he says,

<span id="viii.i-p34"></span>“Every one that drinketh of this water
shall thirst again; but whosoever shall drink of the water which I shall
give to him shall never thirst; but the water which I shall give to him
shall become in him a fountain of water springing up to everlasting
life.” (<span id="viii.i-p34.1"></span>[John
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014)<span id="viii.i-p34.1"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.i-p35"></span>But I have no doubt that under these words,
“waters, milk, wine, bread,” Isaiah includes all that is necessary for
spiritual life; for the metaphors are borrowed from those kinds of food
which are in daily use amongst us. As we are nourished by “bread, wine,
milk, and water,” so in like manner let us know that our souls are fed
and supported by the doctrine of the Gospel, the Holy Spirit, and other
gifts of Christ.

<span id="viii.i-p36"></span>The Prophet exclaims, as with a voice above
the usual pitch, *He!* for so great is the sluggishness of men that it
is very difficult to arouse them. They do not feel their wants, though
they are hungry; nor do they desire food, which they greatly need; and
therefore that indifference must be shaken off by loud and incessant
cries. So much the more base and shameful is the indolence of those who
are deaf to this exhortation, and who, even when they are so sharply
urged forward, still indulge in their slothfulness. Besides, the
invitation is general; for there is no man who is not in want of those
“waters,” and to whom Christ is not necessary; and therefore he invites
all indiscriminately, without any respect of persons. But men are so
miserable that, although they know that they are in need of Christ, they
contrive methods by which they may be deprived of this benefit, and
rather believe the devil, who offers various obstructions, than this
kind invitation.

<span id="viii.i-p37"></span>We must therefore inquire what is the true
preparation for receiving this grace. The Prophet describes it by the
word “thirsty.” Those who are puffed up with vain confidence and are
satiated, or who, intoxicated by earthly appetites, do not feel thirst
of soul, will not receive Christ; because they have no relish for
spiritual grace. They resemble those persons who are in want of
nourishments, but who, because they are filled and swollen with wind,
loathe food, or who, being carried away by their own vain imaginations,
feed on their own stupidity, as if they were in want of nothing. The
consequence is, that they who are puffed up with pride or a false
opinion of their own righteousness, or whom the allurements of the flesh
have seized with lethargy, despise or reject the grace of God. It is
therefore necessary that we have “thirst,” that is, an ardent desire, in
order that it may be possible for us to receive so great blessings.

<span id="viii.i-p38"></span>*Buy without money.* He does not mean that
there are any persons who have money in abundance, but the words ought
to be explained thus. “Although they are poor, although they are sunk in
the deepest poverty, yet the way is open for them to come to Christ,
through whom these blessings are freely bestowed.” “But how is it
possible,” it will be said, “to buy without a price?” I reply, “buying”
denotes figuratively the method by which we procure anything; and <span
id="viii.i-p38.1"></span>שבר (*shabar*) is here put for “procure,” and
“price” for labor or industry, or any other method by which men obtain
anything, he shows that we are poor and utterly destitute, and that we
have nothing by which we can become entitled to God’s favor; but that he
kindly invites us, in order that he may freely bestow everything without
any recompense.

<span id="viii.i-p39"></span><span id="viii.i-p39.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p40"></span>**2.** *Wherefore do ye spend money?*
 <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) He complains of the ingratitude
and madness of men, in rejecting or disdaining the kindness of God who
offers all things freely, and yet harassing themselves greatly about
various trifles which cannot yield them any advantage. Men are so
enchanted by the devil, that they choose rather to wander through
deserts, and to vex themselves in vain, than to rely on the grace which
God offers to them. The experience of the present age abundantly shows
that the Prophet not only expostulated with his own nation, but
exclaimed against all men, to whatever age they might belong; for all
the posterity of Adam have been seized with such madness that, in
seeking the road to a heavenly life,  <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) they altogether go astray, and follow
their own vain opinions rather than the voice of God.

<span id="viii.i-p43"></span>The Prophet does not complain of the
slothfulness of those who, altogether forgetful of themselves and of
God, take no concern about the spiritual life of the soul; (there are
many such persons;) but of those who desire life, and yet do not
understand the method or way of obtaining it, and wander in uncertainty
through deserts and untrodden paths. Here, therefore, are condemned all
the methods which men contrive, in opposition to the Word of God, for
obtaining salvation, and they are pronounced to be useless expenses; for
by the word “money” he denotes all the industry, study, or labor which
belongs to man. Not that God values a single farthing all our idle
attempts to worship him, but because labors foolishly undertaken are
reckoned valuable by the judgment of the flesh.

<span id="viii.i-p44"></span>*And your labor, not so as to be
satisfied.* We see that by the word “bread” is here meant the same as
was formerly meant by “waters,” and that he gives the name “labor” to
that which he formerly called “money.” As if he had said, “Men toil
without any advantage; for, when they follow their own inventions,
however eagerly they may vex and weary themselves, they have no right to
expect any reward.” Thus he affirms that they who labor in an
inconsiderate manner cannot “be satisfied;“ for they who forsake God,
and attempt new methods of salvation, can never “be satisfied.” “They
feed on wind,” as Hosea says. (<span id="viii.i-p44.1"></span>[Ho
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001)<span id="viii.i-p44.1"></span>.md)
They may, indeed, imagine that they are full, when they are swelled with
vain confidence, but are like persons who, in consequence of being
swollen with wind, do not perceive their hunger. Yet it would be better
for them to be sore pressed by hunger and thirst, that it might lead
them to call on the Lord with earnestness of heart, as it is said in the
Psalm, “My soul is as a thirsty land before thee.” (<span
id="viii.i-p44.2"></span>[Ps
143:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#006)<span id="viii.i-p44.2"></span>.md)
But bread alone, or water alone, would not be enough to “satisfy,” and
by neither of them could life be supported; and that is the reason why
the Prophet has made use of a variety of terms, in order to show that
the Lord abundantly supplies everything that is necessary for life, that
we may not think that we ought to seek aid from any other quarter.

<span id="viii.i-p45"></span>*Hear ye by hearing me.*  <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) Because every person is led into error by
his own counsel, and all who neglect God vanish away in wicked
imaginations, the Prophet here adds the remedy, which is, that we must
depend entirely on the mouth of God. Whoever shall submit to his word
will have no reason to fear that he shall spend his strength on things
of no value. Here we see the amazing goodness of God, who offers his
grace to men, though they are unthankful and unworthy.

<span id="viii.i-p47"></span>But he adds the condition; for there is no
way by which we can enter into life but by “hearing” him; and as the
cause of our destruction is, that we are deaf to the voice of God, so
the road to life is open, if we lend our ears to him.  <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) In order to make a deeper impression upon
us, he repeats the same admonition, and doubles the same word, “Hear ye
by hearing;“ and, in order to draw us more gently, he solemnly declares
that it depends entirely on ourselves whether or not he will “delight”
us even to fullness with all abundance of blessings.

<span id="viii.i-p49"></span><span id="viii.i-p49.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p50"></span>**3.** *Incline your ear.* This assemblage
of words makes still more evident what I slightly mentioned a little
before, that God leaves nothing undone which is fitted to correct and
arouse our tardiness. Yet there is an implied reproof; for they must be
excessively stupid who, when they are so gently called, do not instantly
obey. This is a remarkable passage, from which we see that our whole
happiness lies in obeying the word of God. When God speaks in this
manner, the object which he has in view is to lead us to life;  <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) and therefore the blame lies wholly with
ourselves, because we disregard this saving and life­giving word.

<span id="viii.i-p52"></span>*And come unto me.* If God only commanded
what we ought to do, he would indeed lay down the method of obtaining
life, but without advantage; for the Law, which proceeded from the mouth
of God, is the minister of death; but when he invites us “to himself,”
when he adopts us as children, when he promises pardon of sin and
sanctification, the consequence is, that they who hear obtain life from
him. We ought, therefore, to take into view the kind of doctrine which
contains life, in order that we may seek our salvation from it; and
hence we infer that there is no hope of salvation if we do not obey God
and his word. This reproves all mankind, so that they can plead no
excuse for their ignorance; for he who refuses to hear can have no solid
argument to defend his cause.

<span id="viii.i-p53"></span>These repetitions describe the patience of
God in calling us; for he does not merely invite us once, but when he
sees that we are sluggish, he gives a second and even a third warning,
in order to conquer our hardheartedness. Thus he does not all at once
reject those who despise him, but after having frequently invited them.

<span id="viii.i-p54"></span>Besides, this is a description of the
nature of faith, when he bids us “come to himself.” We ought to hear the
Lord in such a manner that faith shall follow; for they who by faith
receive the word of God have laid aside their desires and despised the
world, and may be said to have broken their chains, so that they readily
and cheerfully “draw near to God.” But faith cannot be formed without
hearing, (<span id="viii.i-p54.1"></span>[Ro
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017)<span id="viii.i-p54.1"></span>,.md)
that is, without understanding the word of God, and so he bids us “hear”
before we “come to him.” Thus, whenever faith is mentioned, let us
remember that it must be joined to the word, in which it has its
foundation.

<span id="viii.i-p55"></span>*And I will strike a covenant of eternity
with you.* It is asked, Did not the Jews formerly enter into an
everlasting covenant with God? For he appears to promise something that
is new and uncommon. I reply, nothing new is here promised for which the
Lord did not formerly enter into an engagement with his people; but it
is a renewal and confirmation of the covenant, that the Jews might not
think that the covenant of God was made void on account of the
long­continued banishment. For when they were banished from the country
that had been promised to them,  <span id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md)
when they had no temple or sacrifices, or any marks of the “covenant”
except circumcision, who would not have concluded that it was all over
with them? This mode of expression, therefore, Isaiah accommodated to
the capacity of the people, that they might know that the covenant into
which God entered with the fathers was firm, sure, and eternal, and not
changeable or temporary.

<span id="viii.i-p57"></span>This is also what he means by *the mercies
of David,* but by this phrase he declares that it was a covenant of free
grace; for it was founded on nothing else than the absolute goodness of
God. Whenever, therefore, the word “covenant” occurs in Scripture, we
ought at the same time to call to remembrance the word “grace.” By
calling them “the *faithful* mercies of David,”  <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) he declares that he will be faithful in
it, and at. the same time states indirectly that he is faithful and
steadfast, and cannot be accused of falsehood, as if he had broken his
covenant; that the Jews, on the other hand, are covenant­breakers and
traitors, (for they have revolted from him,) but that he cannot repent
of his covenant or his promise.

<span id="viii.i-p59"></span>He calls them “the mercies *of David*,”
because this covenant, which has now been solemnly confirmed, was made
in the land “of David.” The Lord indeed entered into a covenant with
Abraham, (<span id="viii.i-p59.1"></span>[Gen.
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md), [Gen.
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007)<span id="viii.i-p59.1"></span>.md)
afterwards confirmed it by Moses, (<span id="viii.i-p59.2"></span>[Exod.
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#024.md), [Exod.
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#001)<span id="viii.i-p59.2"></span>.md)
and finally ratified this very covenant in the hand of David, that it
might be eternal. (<span id="viii.i-p59.3"></span>[2Sa
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#012)<span id="viii.i-p59.3"></span>.md)
Whenever, therefore, the Jews thought of a Redeemer, that is, of their
salvation, they ought to have remembered “David” as a mediator who
represented Christ; for David must not here be regarded as a private
individual, but as bearing this title and character. Yet some regard
must be had to the time when this prophecy was uttered; for, since the
rank of the kingdom had been obliterated, and the name of the royal
family had become mean and contemptible during the captivity in Babylon,
it might seem as if, through the ruin of that family, the truth of God
had fallen into decay; and therefore he bids them contemplate by faith
the throne of David, which had been cast down.

<span id="viii.i-p60"></span><span id="viii.i-p60.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p61"></span>**4.** *Behold, I have given him a witness
to the peoples.* The Prophet now explains more fully the reason why he
mentioned “David.” It was because into his hand had been committed the
promise of a Redeemer that was to come, and this discourse might be
expressed with a view to his public character, so far as he was the
surety of the covenant; for he did not act for himself individually, but
was appointed to be a sort of mediator between God and the people. Yet
it is beyond all doubt that the Prophet leads them directly to Christ,
to whom the transition from David was easy and natural; as if he had
said, “That successor of David shall come forth, by whose hand perfect
salvation and happiness hath been promised.”

<span id="viii.i-p62"></span>By calling him “a witness,” he means that
the covenant into which he entered shall be ratified and confirmed in
Christ. There is a weighty meaning in the word “witness;” for he clearly
shows that this covenant shall be proved in Christ, by whom the truth of
God shall be made manifest. He will! testify that God is not false. But
this testimony consists in doctrine; and if it were not added, we should
receive little benefit from Christ’s coming, as it is said, “I will
publish the command.” (<span id="viii.i-p62.1"></span>[Ps
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007)<span id="viii.i-p62.1"></span>.md) In
this sense also Isaiah said in another passage, that Christ will have a
mouth like a sword or an arrow. (<span id="viii.i-p62.2"></span>[Isa
49:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#002)<span id="viii.i-p62.2"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.i-p63"></span>*A leader and instructor.* This is added,
in order to procure attention to his doctrine; for, if we do not hear
him when he speaks, and if we do not embrace by assured faith what he
makes known to us concerning the Father’s good pleasure, his power is
set aside. In like manner, the name of Christ is pronounced loudly
enough by the Papists; but since they refuse to receive him as a teacher
and instructor, and acknowledge him merely by name, their boasting is
idle and ridiculous.

<span id="viii.i-p64"></span>*To the peoples.* This was added for the
purpose of amplification, because the Church could not be restored to
her ancient dignity, or be enlarged, but by assembling the Gentiles; and
therefore it was necessary that the voice of Christ should pierce even
to the remotest countries, because he has been appointed a “witness,
leader, and instructor” to the whole human race.

<span id="viii.i-p65"></span><span id="viii.i-p65.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p66"></span>**5.** *Behold, thou shalt call a nation
which thou knowest not.* Isaiah explains more largely what he formerly
glanced at by a single word; for he declares that Christ shall be the
“leader,” not of a single people, but of all the peoples. “To call” here
denotes possession; for there is a mutual relation between the words
“call” and “answer.” Christ therefore “calls” in the exercise of
authority, as one who is invested with supreme power; and he “calls” the
Gentiles, that he may bring them into a state of obedience, and may
cause them to submit to his word.

<span id="viii.i-p67"></span>He says that they shall be ready to obey,
though hitherto they were unknown; not that the Son of God, by whom they
were created, did not know them, but because he paid no regard to them
 <span id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) until they began to be reckoned as
belonging to the Church. God had in a peculiar manner called the Jews;
the Gentiles appeared to be excluded as if they did not at all belong to
him. But now, addressing Christ,  <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md)
he promises that Christ shall constrain the Gentiles to obey him, though
formerly they were opposed to his authority. He expresses this still
more plainly in what immediately follows.

<span id="viii.i-p70"></span>*A nation that knew not thee shall run to
thee.* By putting the verb <span id="viii.i-p70.1"></span>ירוצו
(*yarutzu*) *shall run,* in the plural number, he intends to explain
more fully that the Church shall be collected out of various peoples, so
that they who were formerly scattered shall be gathered into one body;
for the word “run” relates to harmony of faith. When he now says that
the Gentiles “did not know Christ,” he employs the expression in a
different sense from that in which he said, a little before, that they
were unknown to Christ; for all heathens and unbelievers are declared,
in a literal sense, to be in a state of ignorance, in consequence of
their being destitute of the light of heavenly doctrine, without which
they cannot have the knowledge of God. Although by nature the knowledge
of God is engraven on the hearts of all men, yet it is so confused and
dark, and entangled by many errors, that, if the light of the word be
not added to it, by knowing they know not God, but wander miserably in
darkness.

<span id="viii.i-p71"></span>Here we have a remarkable testimony of God
as to the calling of the Gentiles, for whom, as well as for the Jews,
Christ was appointed. Hence also we learn that God takes care of us, if
we bow to his authority, and not only such care as he takes of all the
creatures, but such care as a father takes of his children.

<span id="viii.i-p72"></span>Yet the word “run” describes more fully the
efficacy of this calling, for the object of it is, that we shall obey
God, that we shall readily and cheerfully place ourselves before him as
teachable, and ready to comply with any expression of his will; in like
manner, as Paul shows that obedience is the end of our calling. (<span
id="viii.i-p72.1"></span>[Rom. 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md),
[Rom. 16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026.md)<span
id="viii.i-p72.1"></span>) But as the Gentiles were at a great distance
from God, it was necessary that they should labor earnestly to surmount
every obstacle, that they might draw near to him.

<span id="viii.i-p73"></span>*For the sake of Jehovah thy God.* He shows
what is the source of this readiness and cheerfulness. It is because the
Gentiles shall know that they have to do with God; for, if we
contemplate Christ merely as man, we shall not be powerfully affected by
his doctrine, but when we behold God in him, an astonishing warmth of
affection is kindled in our hearts. Now, Christ is here described as a
minister appointed by God to perform his work; for he assumes the
character of a servant along with our flesh, and in this respect there
is no impropriety in his being subjected to the Father, as if he
belonged to the rank of other men.

<span id="viii.i-p74"></span>Yet we ought to keep in remembrance what we
have frequently seen as to the union of the Head and the members; for
what is now said concerning Christ relates to the whole body, and
therefore the glorifying is common to the whole Church. Yet Christ
always holds the highest rank; for, being raised on high, he is exalted
above the whole world, that to him there may be a concourse of all
nations. In a word, he shows that men obey Christ and submit to his
doctrine, because God hath exalted him, and hath determined to make his
pre-eminence known to all men; for otherwise the preaching of the gospel
would be of little use, if God did not give power and efficacy to his
doctrine by the Spirit.

<span id="viii.i-p75"></span><span id="viii.i-p75.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p76"></span>**6.** *Seek ye Jehovah.* After having
spoken of the good success of the gospel among the Gentiles, who
formerly were strangers to the kingdom of God, he urges the Jews to be
ashamed of loitering while others run; for since they were the first who
were called, it is shameful that they should be last. This exhortation,
therefore, relates strictly to the Jews, to whom the example of the
Gentiles is held out in order to excite their jealousy; in the same
manner as the Lord hath foretold that “he would provoke the Jews to
jealousy by a foolish nation.” (<span id="viii.i-p76.1"></span>[De
32:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#021)<span id="viii.i-p76.1"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.i-p77"></span>*While he is found.* “The time of finding”
is here used not exactly in the same sense as in <span
id="viii.i-p77.1"></span>[Ps 32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)<span
id="viii.i-p77.1"></span>,  <span id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) but as
the time when God offers himself to us, as in other passages he has
limited a fixed day for his good­pleasure and our salvation. (<span
id="viii.i-p78.1"></span>[Isa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008)<span id="viii.i-p78.1"></span>.md)
Yet I readily admit that it likewise denotes the time when necessity
prompts us to seek God’s assistance; but we ought chiefly to remember
that God is sought at a seasonable time, when of his own accord he
advances to meet us; for in vain shall indolent and sluggish persons
lament that they had been deprived of that grace which they rejected.
The Lord sometimes endures our sluggishness, and bears with us; but if
ultimately he do not succeed, he will withdraw, and will bestow his
grace on others. For this reason Christ exhorts us to walk while it is
day, for the night cometh when the means of pursuing our journey shall
be taken from us. (<span id="viii.i-p78.2"></span>[Joh
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035)<span id="viii.i-p78.2"></span>.md)
We ought to draw high consolation from being assured that it is not in
vain for us to seek God. “Seek,” says Christ, “and ye shall find; knock,
and it shall be opened; ask, and it shall be given to you.” (<span
id="viii.i-p78.3"></span>[Mt 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md)<span
id="viii.i-p78.3"></span>)

<span id="viii.i-p79"></span>*Call upon him while he is near.* The word
“call” may here be taken in a general sense; but I think that it denotes
one description of” seeking” God, which is of more importance than all
the others, as if he commanded us to betake ourselves to him by prayers
and supplications. He says that he is “near,” when he opens the door and
gently invites us to come to him, or when he comes forth publicly, so
that we do not need to seek him through long windings. But we must
attend to Paul’s definition, who tells us that it denotes the preaching
of the gospel. (<span id="viii.i-p79.1"></span>[Ro
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008)<span id="viii.i-p79.1"></span>.md)
“The Lord is nigh,” (<span id="viii.i-p79.2"></span>[Php
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#005)<span id="viii.i-p79.2"></span>.md)
and exhibits himself to us, when the voice of the gospel cries aloud;
and we do not need to seek far, or to make long circuits, as unbelievers
do; for he exhibits himself to us in his word, that we, on our part, may
draw near to him.

<span id="viii.i-p80"></span><span id="viii.i-p80.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p81"></span>**7.** *Let the wicked man forsake his
way.* He confirms the former statement; for, having formerly called men
to receive the grace of God, he now describes more largely the manner of
receiving it. We know how hypocrites loudly call on God whenever they
desire relief from their distresses, and yet shut up their hearts by
wicked obstinacy;  <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) and therefore,
that the Jews may not be hypocritical in seeking God, he exhorts them to
sincere piety. Hence we infer that the doctrine of repentance ought
always to accompany the promise of salvation; for in no other way can
men taste the goodness of God than by abhorring themselves on account of
their sins, and renouncing themselves and the world. And indeed no man
will sincerely desire to be reconciled to God and to obtain pardon of
sins till he is moved by a true and earnest repentance.

<span id="viii.i-p83"></span>By three forms of expression he describes
the nature of repentance, — *first,* “Let the wicked man forsake, his
way;” *secondly,* “The unrighteous man his thoughts;” *thirdly,* “Let
him return to the Lord.” Under the word *way* he includes the whole
course of life, and accordingly demands that they bring forth the fruits
of righteousness as witnesses of their newness of life. By adding the
word thoughts he intimates that we must not only correct outward
actions, but must begin with the heart; for although in the opinion of
men we appear to change our manner of life for the better, yet we shall
have made little proficiency if the heart be not changed.

<span id="viii.i-p84"></span>Thus repentance embraces a change of the
whole man; for in man we view inclinations, purposes, and then works.
The works of men are visible, but the root within is concealed. This
must first be changed, that it may afterwards yield fruitful works. We
must first wash away from the mind all uncleanness, and conquer wicked
inclinations, that outward testimonies may afterwards be added. And if
any man boast that he has been changed, and yet live as he was wont to
do, it will be vain-boasting; for both are requisite, conversion of the
heart, and change of life.

<span id="viii.i-p85"></span>Besides, God does not command us to return
to him before he has applied a remedy to revolt; for hypocrites will
willingly endure that we praise what is good and right, provided that
they be at liberty to crouch amidst their filth. But we can have nothing
to do with God if we do not withdraw from ourselves, especially when we
have been alienated by wicked variance; and therefore self-denial goes
before, that it may lead us to God.

<span id="viii.i-p86"></span>*And he will have mercy on him.* We ought
carefully to examine this context, for he shows that men cannot be led
to repentance in any other way than by holding out assurance of pardon.
Whoever, then, inculcates the doctrine of repentance, without mentioning
the mercy of God and reconciliation through free grace, labors to no
purpose; just as the Popish doctors imagine that they have discharged
their duty well when they have dwelt largely on this point, and yet do
but chatter and trifle about the doctrine of repentance. But although
they taught the true method of repenting, yet it would be of little
avail, seeing that they leave out the foundation of freely­bestowed
pardon, by which alone consciences can be pacified. And indeed, as we
have formerly said, a sinner will always shrink from the presence of God
so long as he is dragged to his judgment-seat to give an account of his
life, and will never be subdued to fear and obedience till his heart is
brought into a state of peace.

<span id="viii.i-p87"></span>*For he aboundeth in pardoning.* Now,
because it is difficult to remove terror from trembling minds, Isaiah
draws all argument from the nature of God, that he will be ready to
pardon and to be reconciled. Thus the Holy Spirit dwells on this part of
doctrine, because we always doubt whether or not God is willing to
pardon us; for, although we entertain some thoughts of his mercy, yet we
do not venture fully to believe that, it belongs to us. It is not
without reason, therefore, that this clause is added, that we may not be
hindered by uncertainty or doubt as to his infinite compassion toward
us.

<span id="viii.i-p88"></span><span id="viii.i-p88.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p89"></span>**8.** *For my thoughts are not your
thoughts.* This passage is expounded in various ways. Some think that it
condemns universally the life of men, that they may not be satisfied
with it or flatter their vices; for we cannot approach to God but by
taking away a false conviction of our own righteousness. And indeed none
call for physicians but those who are driven by the violence of disease
to seek both health and remedies. Accordingly, this passage is compared
by them to that saying of our Lord,

<span id="viii.i-p90"></span>“What ranks high among men is abomination
in the sight of God.” (<span id="viii.i-p90.1"></span>[Lu
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015)<span id="viii.i-p90.1"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.i-p91"></span>But the Prophet’s meaning, I think, is
different, and is more correctly explained, according to my judgment, by
other commentators, who think that he draws a distinction between God’s
disposition and man’s disposition. Men are wont to judge and measure God
from themselves; for their hearts are moved by angry passions, and are
very difficult to be appeased; and therefore they think that they cannot
be reconciled to God, when they have once offended him. But the Lord
shows that he is far from resembling men. As if he had said, “I am not a
mortal man, that I should show myself to be harsh and irreconcilable to
you.  <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) My thoughts are very
different from yours. If you are implacable, and can with difficulty be
brought back to a state of friendship with those from whom you have
received an injury, I am not like you, that I should treat you so
cruelly.”

<span id="viii.i-p93"></span><span id="viii.i-p93.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p94"></span>**9.** *For as the heavens are higher than
the earth.* This agrees well with that passage in which David,
describing the mercy of God, says, (<span id="viii.i-p94.1"></span>[Ps
103:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#011)<span id="viii.i-p94.1"></span>.md)
that it is as much more excellent “as the heavens are higher than the
earth;” for although the application is different, yet the meaning is
the same. In short, God is infinitely compassionate and infinitely ready
to forgive; so that it ought to be ascribed exclusively to our unbelief,
if we do not obtain pardon from him.  <span
id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md)

<span id="viii.i-p96"></span>There is nothing that troubles our
consciences more than when we think that God is like ourselves; for the
consequence is, that we do not venture to approach to him, and flee from
him as an enemy, and are never at rest. But they who measure God by
themselves as a standard form a false idea and altogether contrary to
his nature; and indeed they cannot do him a greater injury than this.
Are men, who are corrupted and debased by sinful desires, not ashamed to
compare God’s lofty and uncorrupted nature with their own, and to
confine what is infinite within those narrow limits by which they feel
themselves to be wretchedly restrained? In what prison could any of us
be more straightly shut up than in our own unbelief?

<span id="viii.i-p97"></span>This appears to me to be the plain and
simple meaning of the Prophet. And yet I do not deny that he alludes, at
the same time, to the life of men such as he formerly described it to
be. In a word, he means that men must forget themselves, when they wish
to be converted to God, and that no obstacle can be greater or more
destructive than when we think that God is irreconcilable. We must
therefore root out of our minds this false imagination.

<span id="viii.i-p98"></span>Moreover, we learn from it how widely they
err who abuse the mercy of God, so as to draw from it greater
encouragement to sin. The Prophet reasons thus, “Repent, forsake your
ways; for the mercy of God is infinite.” When men despair or doubt as to
obtaining pardon, they usually become more hardened and obstinate; but
when they feel that God is merciful, this draws and converts them. It
follows, therefore, that they who do not cease to live wickedly, and who
are not changed in heart, have no share in this mercy.

<span id="viii.i-p99"></span><span id="viii.i-p99.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p100"></span>**10.** *Surely, as the rain cometh down.*
After having spoken of God’s tender affection and inconceivable
forbearance towards us, he again brings forward the promises, that, by
relying on them, we may banish all doubt of being free from every
danger. It would be of little avail to speak to us about the nature or
the secret purpose of God, if we were not reminded of “the word,” by
which he reveals himself. Now, God speaks openly to us, so that it is
unnecessary to make longer inquiry. We must therefore come to the word,
in which his will is declared without obscurity, provided that all our
senses are confined within those limits; for otherwise we remain in
suspense, and doubt what he has determined concerning us, even though
the Lord declare a thousand times that he is altogether unlike men; for,
although men acknowledge this, yet they wish to be certain about
themselves and their salvation.  <span id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md)
For this reason we ought carefully to observe the order which is
followed by the Prophet. Thus also Moses recalled the people to the
knowledge of God. “Say not thou, Who shall ascend to heaven? or, Who
shall descend into the deep? The word is nigh, in thy mouth and in thy
heart.” (<span id="viii.i-p101.2"></span>[De
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#012)<span id="viii.i-p101.2"></span>.md)
“That is,” saith Paul, “the word of faith which we preach.” (<span
id="viii.i-p101.3"></span>[Ro
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008)<span id="viii.i-p101.3"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.i-p102"></span>He employs a comparison drawn from daily
experience and wonderfully appropriate; for, if we see great efficacy in
the rain, which waters and fertilizes the earth, much greater efficacy
will God display in his word. The rain is transitory and liable to
corruption; but the word is eternal, unchangeable, and incorruptible,
and cannot, like the rain, vanish away.

<span id="viii.i-p103"></span>That we may more fully understand the
Prophet’s words, we must keep in view the end at which he aims. Men
doubt if God will actually perform what he promises in his word; for we
look upon the word, as if it were suspended in the air and had no
effect. How shocking this is, he demonstrates from the very course of
nature; for it is in the highest degree unreasonable to ascribe less to
the word than to a dumb creature; and therefore he teaches us, that his
word never fails of its effect. Some understand this to mean that the
preaching of the Gospel is never unprofitable, but always produces some
fruit. This is true in itself; for the Lord worketh by his Spirit, and
“giveth increase,” (<span id="viii.i-p103.1"></span>[1Co
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007)<span id="viii.i-p103.1"></span>.md)
so that the labor of his servants is not unproductive. But the Prophet’s
meaning was different; namely, that God does not speak in vain or
scatter his promises into the air, but that we shall actually receive
the fruit of them, provided that we do not prevent it by our unbelief.

<span id="viii.i-p104"></span>*But watereth the earth, and causeth it to
bring forth.* He mentions two effects produced by the watering of the
rain, which fertilizes the earth; first, that men have abundance of food
for their support; and secondly, that they have seed for procuring a
crop in the following year. If therefore in things of a transitory
nature the power of God is so great, what must we think of the word?
 <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md)

<span id="viii.i-p106"></span><span id="viii.i-p106.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p107"></span>**11.** *So shall my word be.* The word
goeth out of the mouth of God in such a manner that it likewise “goeth
out of the mouth” of men; for God does not speak openly from heaven, but
employs men as his instruments, that by their agency he may make known
his will. But the authority of the promises is more fully confirmed,
when we are told that they proceed from the sacred mouth of God.
Although, therefore, he brings forward witnesses from the earth, he
declares that all that they have promised shall be ratified and sure;
and, in order to impress more deeply on the minds of men the power and
efficacy of preaching, he declares that he does not cast that precious
seed at random, but appoints it for a fixed purpose, and consequently
that we ought to entertain no doubt as to the effect; for there is
nothing to which mortals are more prone than to judge of God from
themselves so as to withhold belief from his voice.

<span id="viii.i-p108"></span>This doctrine must be frequently repeated
and inculcated, that we may know that God will do what. he hath once
spoken. For this reason, when we hear the promises of God, we ought to
consider what is his design in them; so that, when he promises the free
pardon of our sins, we may be fully assured that we are reconciled
through Christ. But, as the word of God is efficacious for the salvation
of believers, so it is abundantly efficacious for condemning the wicked;
as Christ also teacheth, “The word which I have spoken, that shall judge
him at the last day.”

<span id="viii.i-p109"></span><span id="viii.i-p109.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p110"></span>**12.** *Therefore ye shall go out with
joy.* The Prophet concludes the subject of this chapter; for, when he
spoke of the mercy of God, his object was, to convince the Jews that the
Lord would deliver them. He now applies to his purpose what was
contained in his discourse concerning the infinite goodness of God, and
shows that his thoughts are very unlike the thoughts of men. And the
true way of teaching is this, that we should apply general statements
for present use. Finally, he treats of the restoration of the people,
which depended on the undeserved mercy of God.

<span id="viii.i-p111"></span>*The mountains and hills shall break out
before you.* By “the mountains and hills” he means that everything which
they shall meet in the journey, though in other respects it be
injurious, shall aid those who shall return to Jerusalem. They are
metaphors, by which he shows that all the creatures bow to the will of
God, and rejoice and lend their aid to carry on his work. He alludes to
the deliverance from Egypt, (<span id="viii.i-p111.1"></span>[Ex
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#022)<span id="viii.i-p111.1"></span>.md)
as is customary with the Prophets; for thus is it described by the
Psalmist, “The mountains leaped like rams, and the hills like lambs.
What ailed thee, O sea, that thou fleddest, and Jordan, (<span
id="viii.i-p111.2"></span>[Jos
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/jos003.htm#016)<span id="viii.i-p111.2"></span>.md)
that thou wast driven back? (<span id="viii.i-p111.3"></span>[Ps.
114:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#005)<span id="viii.i-p111.3"></span>.md)
For the restoration of the Church may be regarded as a renovation of the
whole world, and in consequence of this, heaven and earth are said to be
changed, as if their order were reversed. But all this depended on
former predictions, by which they had received a promise of their
return.

<span id="viii.i-p112"></span><span id="viii.i-p112.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p113"></span>**13.** *Instead of the bramble*  <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) *shall come up the fir-tree.* He still
extols the power of God, which would be visible in the restoration of
the people; for he shows that the change will be such that they shall
have an easy road to return. Some explain it allegorically, and suppose
that by “brambles” are meant men who wish to do injury, and who inflict
wounds on others, and that these shall be “fir­trees,” that is, trees
that bear fruit and that are useful to their neighbors; but in
expositions of that kind ingenuity is carried to excess. When they say
that these things relate to the kingdom of Christ, and on that account
ought to be understood in a spiritual sense, I agree with them; for the
Prophet begins with the departure from Babylon, and includes the whole
condition of the Church, till Christ was manifested to the world. But
the propriety of that allegory must not therefore be admitted; for he
speaks of the departure from Babylon, and, in order to open it up for
his people, he says that he will remove every obstacle, and will supply
them with everything necessary, so that they shall suffer no
inconvenience. In like manner, when Christ promises the benefit of
redemption, he likewise takes away everything that would injure or
retard, and even turns those things to a different and totally opposite
purpose, that from them also they may receive some benefit. All things
(<span id="viii.i-p114.1"></span>[Ro
8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028)<span id="viii.i-p114.1"></span>.md)
tend to the advantage of believers, and those things which would
otherwise be injurious and destructive, are employed by God as remedies
to purify them, that they may not be devoted to the world, but may
become more ready and cheerful in the service of their Master.  <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md)

<span id="viii.i-p116"></span>*And shall be to Jehovah for a name.* When
he says that it shall be to God “for a name,” he shows what is the
design of the restoration of the Church. It is, that the name of God may
be more illustrious among men, and that the remembrance of him may
flourish and be maintained. On this account he adds that it shall be a
perpetual sign, that is, a monument, and, as we commonly say, a
memorial; and although, amidst these tempests, the Church be tossed and
agitated in various ways, yet, because the Lord wishes that the
remembrance of his name may be everlasting, he will guard and defend
her.

<span id="viii.i-p95"></span> “Do not think,” saith God, “that what I
promise is difficult, and let it not seem incredible to you, that a
wicked and unjust man, or the people of the Jews, or all who among the
Gentiles knew not God, can be saved. Consider this, that there is a wide
difference between your purposes and mine, and that the difference of
will is as great as the difference of nature; for there are many
thoughts in the heart of a man, but the purpose of the Lord endureth for
ever. You, like men who often repent of what they have promised, have
thrown down the ancient will, and have set up in its place a modern
will. But the thoughts of his heart are from generation to generation,
and whatever he hath decreed cannot be changed.” ­ *Jerome*.

them.”

<span id="viii.i-p105"></span> “These words depend on what goes before,
and their meaning may thus be briefly stated. Let not the people refuse
to believe that a wicked man, after having committed great crimes, shall
suddenly be saved. For my thoughts are not as the thoughts of men; and
as far as heaven is distant from the earth, so are my thoughts separated
from the thoughts of men. I am most merciful and ready to forgive. Would
you wish to have another metaphor? As the rain and snow come down from
heaven, and do not return thither, but water and refresh the earth, and
cause it to bring forth various productions, that the corn-fields may
produce abundance of bread for the use of men; so the word of my
promise, which I have promised once and again, and which hath gone out
of my mouth, shall not be void, but all shall be actually fulfilled.” ­
*Jerome*.
