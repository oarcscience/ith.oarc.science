<span id="v-p1"></span>EPISTLE DEDICATORY

<span id="v-p2"></span>JOHN CALVIN

<span id="v-p3"></span>TO THE MOST MIGHTY AND MOST SERENE PRINCE,

<span id="v-p4"></span>SIGISMUND AUGUSTUS,

<span id="v-p5"></span>by the Grace of God, the King of Poland,  
Great Duke of Lithuania, Russia, Prussia,  
and Lord and Heir of Muscovy, etc.

<span id="v-p6"></span>There are at this day many foolish men, who
everywhere, through a vain desire for writing, engage the minds of
ignorant and thoughtless readers with their trifles. And to this evil,
most illustrious King, is added another indignity — that while they
inscribe to kings and princes their silly things, to disguise, or at
least to cover them by borrowed splendor, they not only profane sacred
names, but also impart to them some measure of their own disgrace. Since
the unreasonable temerity of such men makes it necessary for serious and
sober writers to frame an excuse, when they publicly dedicate their
labors to great men, while yet there is nothing in them but what
corresponds with the greatness of those to whom they are offered, it was
necessary to make this remark, lest I should seem to be of the number of
those who allow themselves, through the example of others, to render
public anything they please, however foolish it may be. But it has not
escaped me how much it has the appearance of foolish confidence, that I,
(not to speak of other things,) who am an unknown and obscure man,
should not hesitate to address your royal Majesty. Let my reasons be
heard, and if you, O King, approve of what I do, what others may judge
will cause me no great anxiety.

<span id="v-p7"></span>First, then, though I am not forgetful of mine
insignificance, nor ignorant of the reverence due to your Majesty, yet
the fame of your piety, which has extended almost to all who are zealous
for the sincere doctrine of Christ, is alone sufficient to remorse any
fear; for I bring with me a present which that piety will not allow you
to reject. Since the Epistle inscribed to the Hebrews contains a full
discussion respecting the eternal divinity of Christ, his government,
and only priesthood, (which are the main points of celestial wisdom,)
and as these things are so explained in it, that the whole power and
work of Christ are set forth in the most graphic manner, it deservedly
ought to obtain in the Church the place and the honor of an invaluable
treasure. By you also, who desire that the Son of God should reign alone
and be glorified, I doubt not but that it will be valued.

<span id="v-p8"></span>In the interpretation which I have undertaken, I
say not that I have succeeded; but I feel confident that when you have
read it you will approve at least of my fidelity and diligence. And as I
claim not the praise of great knowledge or of erudition, so what has
been given me by the Lord for the purpose of understanding the
Scripture, (since this is to glory in him,) I am not ashamed to profess;
and if in this respect I have any capacity to assist the Church of God,
I have endeavored to give an evident proof of it in these my labors. I
therefore hope that the present (as I have said) which I offer will not
only avail, O King, as an excuse to your Majesty, but also procure for
me no small favor.

<span id="v-p9"></span>This may possibly be also a new encouragement to
your Majesty, who is already engaged in the work of restoring the
kingdom of Christ, and to many who live under your government to further
the same work. Your kingdom is extensive and renowned, and abounds in
many excellences; but its happiness will then only be solid, when it
adopts Christ as its chief ruler and governor, so that it may be
defended by his safeguard and protection; for to submit your scepter to
him, is not inconsistent with that elevation in which you are placed;
but it would be far more glorious than all the triumphs of the world.
For since among men gratitude is deemed the proper virtue of a great and
exalted mind, what in kings can be more unbecoming than to be ungrateful
to the Son, by whom they have been raised to the highest degree of
honor? It is, therefore, not only an honorable, but more than a royal
service, which raises us to the rank of angels, when the throne of
Christ is erected among us, so that his celestial voice becomes the only
rule for living and dying both to the highest and to the lowest. For
though at this day to obey the authority of Christ is the common
profession, made almost by all, yet there are very few who render this
obedience of which they boast.

<span id="v-p10"></span>Now this obedience cannot be rendered, except
the whole of religion be formed according to the infallible rule of his
holy truth. But on this point strange conflicts arise, while men, not
only inflated with pride, but also bewitched by monstrous madness, pay
less regard to the unchangeable oracles of our heavenly Master than to
their own vain fictions; for whatever pretenses they may set up, who
oppose us and strive to assist the Roman Antichrist, the very fountain
of all the contentions, by which the Church for these thirty years has
been so sorely disturbed, will be found to be, that they who seek to be
deemed first among Christ’s disciples, cannot bear to submit to his
truth. Ambition as well as audacity has so far prevailed, that the truth
of God lies buried under innumerable lies, that all his institutions are
polluted by the basest corruptions; his worship is in every part
vitiated, the doctrine of faith is wholly subverted, the sacraments are
adulterated, the government of the Church is turned into barbarous
tyranny, the abominable sale of sacred things has been set up, the power
of Christ has been abused for the purpose of sustaining the tyranny of
the ungodly, and in the place of Christianity is substituted a dreadful
profanation, full of the grossest mummeries of every kind. When for
these so many and so atrocious evils we bring this one remedy — to hear
the Son of God speaking from heaven, we are instantly opposed by these
Atlases, not those who support the Church on their shoulders, but who
elevate on high by vain boastings of empty titles an idol devised and
formed by themselves. They also adduce this as a pretext for their
fierce recriminations, that we by our appeals disturb the peace of the
Church. When we come to know things aright, we see that these subtle
artifices devise for themselves a Church wholly different from that of
Christ! And what else is this but a wicked and sacrilegious attempt to
separate the body from its head? It hence appears how frivolous is the
boasting of many as to Christianity; for the greatest part suffer
themselves to be governed by nothing less than by the pure teaching of
the Gospel.

<span id="v-p11"></span>But what you acknowledge, O King, that in order
that Christ may take an entire possession of his own kingdom, it is
necessary to clear away all superstitions, is a proof of singular
wisdom; and to undertake and attempt what you judge to be thus
necessary, is an evidence of rare virtue. That you are indeed like
another Hezekiah or Josiah, destined by God to restore shortly to the
kingdom of Poland a purer teaching of that gospel, which has been
throughout the world vitiated by the craft of Satan and perfidy of men,
there are many things which give almost a certain hope to all good men.
For, to omit other superior qualities, which even foreigners proclaim
and men of your own kingdom observe with great advantage, there has ever
appeared in you a wonderful concern for religion, and religion itself
appears eminent in you in the present day. But the chief thing is, that
Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, has so irradiated your mind with the
light of his Gospel, that you understand that the true way of governing
the Church is no other than what is to be derived from him, and that you
at the same time know the difference between that genuine form of
religion which he has instituted, and that fictions and degenerate form
which was afterwards introduced; for you wholly understand that God’s
worship has been corrupted and deformed, as innumerable superstitions
have crept in, that the grace of Christ has been unworthily involved in
great darkness, that the virtue of his death has been annihilated, that
he himself has been almost lacerated and torn in pieces, that assurance
of salvation has been plucked up by the roots, that consciences have
been miserably and even horribly vexed and tormented, that wretched men
have been led away from the sincere and right worship of God into
various and perplexed labyrinths, that the Church has been cruelly and
tyrannically oppressed; and, in short, that no real Christianity has
been left.

<span id="v-p12"></span>It is not to be believed, O most noble King,
that you have been in vain endowed by God with this knowledge; doubtless
he has chosen you as his minister for some great purposes. And it has
hitherto happened through God’s wonderful Providence that no innocent
blood has been shed in the renowned kingdom of Poland — no, not a drop,
which by calling for vengeance might retard so great a benefit. It was
through the clemency and gentleness of King Sigismund, of happy memory,
the father of your Majesty, that this did not take place; for, while the
contagion of cruelty was spreading through the whole of the Christian
world, he kept his hands pure. But now your Majesty and some of the most
eminent of your princes not only receive Christ willingly when offered
to them, but anxiously desire him. I also see John a Lasco, born of a
noble family, carrying the torch to other nations.

<span id="v-p13"></span>The presumption of Eckius is by no means to be
endured, who dedicated to King Sigismund, the father of your Majesty,
his book on The Sacrifice of the Mass; for he thus, as far as he could,
affixed a base blot to your illustrious kingdom! At the same time, it
was nothing strange in that *Silenus*, who, being the prince of
drunkards, was wont to vomit at the altar as well as at the dunghill.
Now, by dedicating this my labor to your Majesty, I shall at least
effect this, that I shall wash away from the name of Poland the base
filth of *Eckius*, so that it may not stick where it has been so
unworthily fixed. And by doing so I shall not, as it seems to me, attain
a small object; and no book of Scripture could hardly be chosen so
suitable for such a purpose. For here our Apostle shows in an especial
manner, that the sacrifice which *Eckius* advocates is manifestly
inconsistent with the priesthood of Christ. There is here, indeed, no
mention of the mass, which Satan had not then vomited out of hell. But
by bidding the Church to be satisfied with the one only true sacrifice
which Christ offered on the cross, that all rites of sacrificing might
cease forever, he doubtless closes the door against all their new
glosses. The Apostle cries aloud that Christ was sacrificed on the cross
once for all, while *Eckius* feigns that this sacrifice is daily
renewed! The Apostle declares that the only Son of God was the fit
priest to offer himself to the Father, and hence he was constituted by
an oath; but *Eckius* denies that he alone is the priest, and transfers
that function to hired sacrificers! At the same time, I am not ignorant
of the evasions by which they elude these and similar arguments; but
there is no fear that he will deceive any but those who are blind or who
shun the light. He was at the same time so inebriated with Thrasonic
haughtiness that he labored more in insolent boasting than in subtle
demonstration. That I may not, however, seem to triumph over a dead dog,
I will add nothing more at present than that my Commentary may serve to
wipe off the filthy stain which that unprincipled and Scottish man
attempted to fix on the name of Poland; and there is no fear that they
who will read will be taken by his baits.

<span id="v-p14"></span>Moreover, as I wish not in offering this my
labor to your Majesty, only to show privately a regard for you, O King,
but especially to make it known to the whole world, it remains now for
me humbly to implore your Majesty not to repudiate what I do. If indeed
a stimulus be thereby given to encourage your pious endeavors, I shall
think it an ample remuneration. Undertake, then, I pray, O magnanimous
King, under the auspicious banner of Christ, a work so worthy of your
royal elevation, as well as of your heroic virtue, so that the eternal
truth of God, by which his own glory and the salvation of men are
promoted, may, wherever thy kingdom spreads, recover its own authority,
which has been taken away by the fraudulent dealings of Antichrist. It
is truly an arduous work, and of such magnitude as is sufficient to fill
even the wisest with solicitude and fear.

<span id="v-p15"></span>But first, there is no danger which we ought not
cheerfully to undergo, no difficulty which we ought not resolutely to
undertake, no conflicts in which we ought not boldly to engage, in a
cause so necessary. Secondly, as it is the peculiar work of God, we
ought not in this case to regard so much the extent of human powers as
the glory due to his power; so that, relying on that not only to help
us, but also to guide us, we may venture on things far beyond our own
strength; for the work of restoring and establishing the church is not
without reason everywhere assigned in Scripture to God. Besides, the
work itself is altogether divine; and as soon as any beginning is made,
whatever arts of injury Satan possesses, he employs them all either to
stop or to delay a further progress. And we know that the prince of this
world has innumerable agents who are ever ready to oppose the kingdom of
Christ. Some are instigated by ambition, others by gain. These contests
try us in some degree in our humble condition; but your majesty will
have, no doubt, to experience far greater difficulties. Therefore, all
those who undertake to promote the doctrine of salvation and the
well­being of the Church must be armed with invincible firmness. But as
this business is above our strength, aid from heaven will be granted to
us.

<span id="v-p16"></span>It is in the meantime our duty to have all these
promises which everywhere occur in Scripture inscribed on our hearts.
The Lord who has himself as it were by his own hand laid the foundations
of the Church, will not suffer it to remain in a decayed state, for he
is represented as solicitous to restore it and to repair its ruins; for,
by speaking thus, he in effect promises that he will never fail us when
engaged in this work. As he would not have us to sit down as idle
spectators of his power, so the presence of his aid in sustaining the
hands which labor, clearly proves that he himself is the chief
architect. What, therefore, he so often repeats and inculcates, and not
without reason, is, that we are not to grow weary, however often we may
have to contend with enemies, who continually break forth into
hostility; for they are, as we have said, almost infinite in number, and
in kinds various. But this one thing is abundantly sufficient, that we
have such an invincible Leader, that the more he is assailed the greater
will be the victories and triumphs gained by his power.

<span id="v-p17"></span>Farewell, invincible King. May the Lord Jesus
rule you by the spirit of wisdom, sustain you by the spirit of valor,
bestow on you all kinds of blessings, long preserve your Majesty in
health and prosperity, and protect your kingdom. Amen.

<span id="v-p18"></span>Geneva, May 23, 1549
