<span id="xvii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 11

<span id="xvii.i"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 11:1

<span id="xvii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Now faith is the substance of things
hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.

<span id="xvii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Porro fides est rerum sperandarum
substantia, demonstratio eorum quae non videntur.

<span id="xvii.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.i-p5"></span><span id="xvii.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p6"></span>**1.** *Now faith,* *etc.* Whoever made this
the beginning of the eleventh chapter, has unwisely disjointed the
context; for the object of the Apostle was to prove what he had already
said ­that there is need of patience.  <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) He had quoted the testimony of
Habakkuk, who says that the just lives by faith; he now shows what
remained to be proved — that faith can be no more separated from
patience than from itself. The order then of what he says is this, — “We
shall not reach the goal of salvation except we have patience, for the
Prophet declares that the just lives by faith; but faith directs us to
things afar off which we do not as yet enjoy; it then necessarily
includes patience.” Therefore the minor proposition in the argument is
this, *Faith is the substance of things hoped for,* *etc.* It is hence
also evident, that greatly mistaken are they who think that an exact
definition of faith is given here; for the Apostle does not speak here
of the whole of what faith is, but selects that part of it which was
suitable to his purpose, even that it has patience ever connected with
it.  <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) Let us now consider the
words.

<span id="xvii.i-p9"></span>He calls faith the *hypostasis,* the
substance of things hoped for. We indeed know that what we hope for is
not what we have as it were in hand, but what is as yet hid from us, or
at least the enjoyment of which is delayed to another time. The Apostle
now teaches us the same thing with what we find in <span
id="xvii.i-p9.1"></span>[Ro 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024.md)<span
id="xvii.i-p9.1"></span>; where it is said that what is hoped for is not
seen, and hence the inference is drawn, that it is to be waited for in
patience. So the Apostle here reminds us, that faith regards not present
things, but such as are waited for. Nor is this kind of contradiction
without its force and beauty: Faith, he says, is the hypostasis, the
prop, or the foundation on which we plant our foot, — the prop of what?
Of things absent, which are so far from being really possessed by us,
that they are far beyond the reach of our understanding.

<span id="xvii.i-p10"></span>The same view is to be taken of the second
clause, when he calls faith the *evidence* or demonstration of things
*not seen;* for demonstration makes things to appear or to be seen; and
it is commonly applied to what is subject to our senses.  <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md)

<span id="xvii.i-p14"></span>Then these two things, though apparently
inconsistent, do yet perfectly harmonize when we speak of faith; for the
Spirit of God shows to us hidden things, the knowledge of which cannot
reach our senses: Promised to us is eternal life, but it is promised to
the dead; we are assured of a happy resurrection, but we are as yet
involved in corruption; we are pronounced just, as yet sin dwells in us;
we hear that we are happy, but we are as yet in the midst of many
miseries; an abundance of all good things is promised to us, but still
we often hunger and thirst; God proclaims that he will come quickly, but
he seems deaf when we cry to him. What would become of us were we not
supported by hope, and did not our minds emerge out of the midst of
darkness above the world through the light of God’s word and of his
Spirit? Faith, then, is rightly said to be the subsistence or substance
of things which are as yet the objects of hope and the evidence of
things not seen. *Augustine* sometimes renders evidence “conviction,”
which I do not disapprove, for it faithfully expresses the Apostle’s
meaning: but I prefer “demonstration,” as it is more literal.

<span id="xvii.ii"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 11:2-4

<span id="xvii.ii-p2"></span>**2.** For by it the elders obtained a good
report.

<span id="xvii.ii-p3"></span>**2.** Per hane enim testimonium consequuti
sunt seniores.

<span id="xvii.ii-p4"></span>**3.** Through faith we understand that the
worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen
were not made of things which do appear.

<span id="xvii.ii-p5"></span>**3.** Fide intelligimus aptata esse secula
verbo Dei, ut non apparentium spectacula fierent.

<span id="xvii.ii-p6"></span>**4.** By faith Abel offered unto God a
more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he
was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet
speaketh.

<span id="xvii.ii-p7"></span>**4.** Fide Abel praestantiorem hostiam
quam Cain obtulit Deo; per quam testimonium abtinuit quod justus esset,
testimonium reddente Deo ejus donis: et per ipsam mortuus adhuc
loquitur.

<span id="xvii.ii-p8"></span> 

<span id="xvii.ii-p9"></span><span id="xvii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p10"></span>**2.** *For by it the elders,*  <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) *etc.* He handles this subject to the
end of the chapter — that the fathers obtained salvation and were
accepted by God in no other way than by faith.

<span id="xvii.ii-p12"></span>The Jews indeed had some reasons for
paying great deference to the fathers; but a foolish admiration of the
fathers had so prevailed among them, that it proved a great hindrance to
a thorough surrender of themselves to Christ and to his government. It
was occasioned either by ambition or superstition, or by both. For when
they heard that they were the blessed and holy seed of Abraham, inflated
with this distinction they fixed their eyes on men rather than on God.
Then added to this was a false emulation; for they did not consider what
was mainly worthy of imitation in their fathers. It thus happened that
they became attached to the old ceremonies, as though the whole of
religion and perfect holiness consisted in them. This error the Apostle
exposes and condemns; and be shows what was the chief excellency of the
fathers, in order that their posterity might understand how they might
become really like them.

<span id="xvii.ii-p13"></span>Let us then bear in mind that the main
point and the very hinge on which the Apostle’s argument turns is this,
— That all the fathers from the beginning of the world, were approved by
God in no other way than by being united to him by faith: and this he
shows, that the Jews might know that by faith alone they could be bound
together in holy unity with the fathers, and that as soon as they
renounced faith, they became banished from the Church, and that they
were then no longer the legitimate children of Abraham, but a degenerate
race and bastards.  <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md)

<span id="xvii.ii-p15"></span><span id="xvii.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p16"></span>**3.** *Through,* or by, *faith we
understand,*  <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) *etc.* This is a
most striking proof of the last verse; for we differ nothing from the
brute creation, if we understand not that the world has been created by
God. To what end have men been endued with understanding and reason,
except that they might acknowledge their Creator? But it is by faith
alone we know that it was God who created the world. No wonder then that
faith shone forth in the fathers above all other virtues.

<span id="xvii.ii-p20"></span>But it may be here asked, Why does the
Apostle assert that what even infidels acknowledge is only understood by
faith? For the very appearance of heaven and earth constrains even the
ungodly to acknowledge some Maker; and hence Paul condemns all for
ingratitude, because they did not, after having known God, give him the
honor due to him. (<span id="xvii.ii-p20.1"></span>[Ro
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#025)<span id="xvii.ii-p20.1"></span>..md)
And no doubt religion would not have so prevailed among all nations, had
not men’s minds been impressed with the convictions that God is the
Creator of the world. It thus then appears that this knowledge which the
Apostle ascribes to faith, exists without faith.

<span id="xvii.ii-p21"></span>To this I reply, — that though there has
been an opinion of this kind among heathens, that the world was made by
God, it was yet very evanescent, for as soon as they formed a notion of
some God, they became instantly vain in their imaginations, so that they
groped in the dark, having in their thoughts a mere shadow of some
uncertain deity, and not the knowledge of the true God. Besides, as it
was only a transient opinion that flit in their minds, it was far from
being anything like knowledge. We may further add, that they assigned to
fortune or chance the supremacy in the government of the world, and they
made no mention of God’s providence which alone rules everything. Men’s
minds therefore are wholly blind, so that they see not the light of
nature which shines forth in created things, until being irradiated by
God’s Spirit, they begin to understand by faith what otherwise they
cannot comprehend. Hence most correctly does the Apostle ascribe such an
understanding to faith; for they who have faith do not entertain a
slight opinion as to God being the Creator of the world, but they have a
deep conviction fixed in their minds and behold the true God. And
further, they understand the power of his word, not only as manifested
instantaneously in creating the world, but also as put forth continually
in its preservation; nor is it his power only that they understand, but
also his goodness, and wisdom, and justice. And hence they are led to
worship, love, and honor him.

<span id="xvii.ii-p22"></span>*Not made of things which do appear.* As
to this clause, all interpreters seem to me to have been mistaken; and
the mistake has arisen from separating the preposition from the
participle φαὶνομένων. They give this rendering, “So that visible things
were made from things which do not appear.” But from such words hardly
any sense can be elicited, at least a very jejune sense; and further,
the text does not admit of such a meaning, for then the words must have
been, ἐκ μὴ φαινομένων: but the order adopted by the Apostle is
different. If, then, the words were rendered literally, the meaning
would be as follows, — “So that they became the visible of things not
visible,” or, not apparent. Thus the preposition would be joined to the
participle to which it belongs. Besides, the words would then contain a
very important truth, — that we have in this visible world, a
conspicuous image of God; and thus the same truth is taught here, as in
<span id="xvii.ii-p22.1"></span>[Ro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p22.1"></span>,
where it is said, that the invisible things of God are made known to us
by the creation of the world, they being seen in his works. God has
given us, throughout the whole framework of this world, clear evidences
of his eternal wisdom, goodness, and power; and though he is in himself
invisible, he in a manner becomes visible to us in his works.  <span
id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md)

<span id="xvii.ii-p27"></span>Correctly then is this world called the
mirror of divinity; not that there is sufficient clearness for man to
gain a full knowledge of God, by looking at the world, but that he has
thus so far revealed himself, that the ignorance of the ungodly is
without excuse. Now the faithful, to whom he has given eyes, see sparks
of his glory, as it were, glittering in every created thing. The world
was no doubt made, that it might be the theater of the divine glory.

<span id="xvii.ii-p28"></span><span id="xvii.ii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p29"></span>**4.** *By faith Abel offered,* *etc.* The
Apostle’s object in this chapter is to show, that however excellent were
the works of the saints, it was from faith they derived their value,
their worthiness, and all their excellences; and hence follows what he
has already intimated, that the fathers pleased God by faith alone.

<span id="xvii.ii-p30"></span>Now he commends faith here on two
accounts, — it renders obedience to God, for it attempts and undertakes
nothing, but what is according to the rule of God’s word, — and it
relies on God’s promises, and thus it gains the value and worth which
belongs to works from his grace alone. Hence, wherever the word faith is
found in this chapter, we must bear in mind, that the Apostle speaks of
it, in order that the Jews might regard no other rule than God’s word,
and might also depend alone on his promises.

<span id="xvii.ii-p31"></span>He says, first, that Abel’s *sacrifice*
was for no other reason preferable to that of his brother, except that
it was sanctified by faith:  <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) for
surely the fat of brute animals did not smell so sweetly, that it could,
by its odor, pacify God. The Scripture indeed shows plainly, why God
accepted his sacrifice, for Moses’s words are these, “God had respect to
Abel, and to his gifts.” It is hence obvious to conclude, that his
sacrifice was accepted, because he himself was graciously accepted. But
how did he obtain this favor, except that his heart was purified by
faith.

<span id="xvii.ii-p34"></span>*God testifying,* etc. He confirms what I
have already stated, that no works, coming from us can please God, until
we ourselves are received into favor, or to speak more briefly, that no
works are deemed just before God, but those of a just man: for he
reasons thus, — God bore a testimony to Abel’s gifts; then he had
obtained the praise of being just before God.  <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md)

<span id="xvii.ii-p37"></span>This doctrine is useful, and ought
especially to be noticed, as we are not easily convinced of its truth;
for when in any work, anything splendid appears, we are immediately rapt
in admiration, and we think that it cannot possibly be disapproved of by
God: but God, who regards only the inward purity of the heart, heeds not
the outward masks of works. Let us then learn, that no right or good
work can proceed from us, until we are justified before God.

<span id="xvii.ii-p38"></span>*By it he being dead,* *etc.* To faith he
also ascribes this, — that God testified that Abel was no less the
object of his care after his death, than during his life: for when he
says, that though dead, he still speaketh, he means, as Moses tells us,
that God was moved by his violent death to take vengeance. When,
therefore, Abel or his blood is said to speak, the words are to be
understood figuratively. It was yet a singular evidence of God’s love
towards him, that he had a care for him when he was dead; and it hence
appears, that he was one of God’s saints, whose death is precious to
him.  <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md)

<span id="xvii.iii"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 11:5-6

<span id="xvii.iii-p2"></span>**5.** By faith Enoch was translated that
he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated
him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased
God.

<span id="xvii.iii-p3"></span>**5.** Fide Enoch translatus est ne
videret mortem; neque inventus est propterea quod Deus illum
transtulerat; nam ante translationem suam testimonium adeptus erat quod
placuisset Deo.

<span id="xvii.iii-p4"></span>**6.** But without faith *it is*
impossible to please *him*: for he that cometh to God must believe that
he is, and *that* he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

<span id="xvii.iii-p5"></span>**6.** Sine fide autem impossibile est
placere Deo; nam qui ad Deum accedit, eum credere oportet quod sit, et
quod remunerator sit iis qui eum quaerunt.

<span id="xvii.iii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xvii.iii-p7"></span><span id="xvii.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p8"></span>**5.** *By faith Enoch,* *etc.* He chose a
few of the most ancient, that he might make a transition to Abraham and
his posterity. He teaches us that through faith, it was that Enoch was
translated.

<span id="xvii.iii-p9"></span>But we ought especially to consider the
reason why God in so unusual a manner removed him from the earth. The
event was remarkable, and hence all may know how dear he was to God.
Impiety and all kinds of corruptions then prevailed everywhere. Had he
died as other men, it would have not occurred to any, that he was thus
preserved from the prevailing contagion by God’s providence; but, as he
was taken away without dying, the hand of God from heaven, removing him
as it were from the fire, was openly manifested. It was not to then an
ordinary honor with which God had favored him. Moses indeed tells us,
that he was a righteous man, and that he walked with God; but as
righteousness begins with faith, it is justly ascribed to his faith,
that he pleased God.  <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md)

<span id="xvii.iii-p11"></span>As to the subtle questions which the
curious usually moot, it is better to pass them over, without taking
much notice of them. They ask, what became of these two men, Enoch and
Elijah? And then, that they may not appear merely to ask questions, they
imagine that they are reserved for the last days of the Church, that
they may then come forth into the world; and for this purpose the
Revelation of John is referred to. Let us leave this airy philosophy to
those light and vain minds, which cannot be satisfied with what is
solid. Let it suffice us to know, that their translation was a sort of
extraordinary death; nor let us doubt but that they were divested of
their mortal and corruptible flesh, in order that they might, with the
other members of Christ, be renewed into a blessed immortality.  <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md)

<span id="xvii.iii-p14"></span><span id="xvii.iii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p15"></span>**6.** *But without faith,* *etc.* What
is said here belongs to all the examples which the Apostle records in
this chapter; but as there is in the passage some measure of obscurity,
it is necessary to examine its meaning more closely.

<span id="xvii.iii-p16"></span>But there is no better interpreter than
the Apostle himself. The proof, then, which he immediately subjoins, may
serve as an explanation. The reason he assigns why no one can please God
without faith, is this, — because no one will ever come to God, except
he believes that God is, and is also convinced that he is a remunerator
to all who seek him. If access then to God is not opened, but by faith,
it follows, that all who are without it, are the objects of God’s
displeasure. Hence the Apostle shows how faith obtains favor for us,
even because faith is our teacher as to the true worship of God, and
makes us certain as to his goodwill, so that we may not think that we
seek him in vain. These two clauses ought not to be slightly passed
over, — that we must believe that God is, and that we ought to feel
assured that he is not sought in vain.  <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md)

<span id="xvii.iii-p18"></span>It does not indeed seem a great matter,
when the Apostle requires us to believe that God is; but when you more
closely consider it, you will find that there is here a rich, profound,
and sublime truth; for though almost all admit without disputing that
God is, yet it is evident, that except the Lord retains us in the true
and certain knowledge of himself, various doubts will ever creep in, and
obliterate every thought of a Divine Being. To this vanity the
disposition of man is no doubt prone, so that to forget God becomes an
easy thing. At the same time the Apostle does not mean, that men ought
to feel assured that there is some God, for he speaks only of the true
God; nay, it will not be sufficient for you to form a notion of any God
you please; but you must understand what sort of Being the true God is;
for what will it profit us to devise and form an idol, and to ascribe to
it the glory due to God?

<span id="xvii.iii-p19"></span>We now then perceive what the Apostle
means in the first clause; he denies that we can have an access to God,
except we have the truth, that God is deeply fixed in our hearts, so as
not to be led here and there by various opinions.

<span id="xvii.iii-p20"></span>It is hence evident, that men in vain
weary themselves in serving God, except they observe the right way, and
that all religions are not only vain, but also pernicious, with which
the true and certain knowledge of God is not connected; for all are
prohibited from having any access to God, who do not distinguish and
separate him from all idols; in short, there is no religion except where
this truth reigns dominant. But if the true knowledge of God has its
seat in our hearts it will not fail to lead us to honor and fear him;
for God, without his majesty is not really known. Hence arises the
desire to serve him, hence it comes that the whole life is so formed,
that he is regarded as the end in all things

<span id="xvii.iii-p21"></span>The second clause is that we ought to be
fully persuaded that God is not sought in vain; and this persuasion
includes the hope of salvation and eternal life, for no one will be in a
suitable state of heart to seek God except a sense of the divine
goodness be deeply felt, so as to look for salvation from him. We indeed
flee from God, or wholly disregard him, when there is no hope of
salvation. But let us bear in mind, that this is what must be really
believed, and not held merely as a matter of opinions; for even the
ungodly may sometimes entertain such a notion, and yet they do not come
to God; and for this reason, because they have not a firm and fixed
faith.  <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) This then is the other
part of faith by which we obtain favor with God, even when we feel
assured that salvation is laid up for us in him.

<span id="xvii.iii-p23"></span>But many shamefully pervert this clause;
for they hence elicit the merits of works, and the conceit about
deserving. And they reason thus: “We please God by faith, because we
believe him to be a rewarder; then faith has respect to the merits of
works.” This error cannot be better exposed, than by considering how God
is to be sought; while any one is wandering from the right way of
seeking him,  <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) he cannot be said
to be engaged in the work. Now Scripture assigns this as the right way,
— that a man, prostrate in himself, and smitten with the conviction that
he deserves eternal death, and in self­despair, is to flee to Christ as
the only asylum for salvation. Nowhere certainly can we find that we are
to bring to God any merits of works to put us in a state of favor with
him. Then he who understands that this is the only right way of seeking
God, will be freed from every difficulty on the subject; for reward
refers not to the worthiness or value of works but to faith.

<span id="xvii.iii-p25"></span>Thus, these frigid glosses of the
Sophists, such as, “by faith we please God, for we deserve when we
intend to please,” fall wholly to the ground. The Apostle’s object was
to carry us much higher, even that conscience might feel assured that it
is not a vain thing to seek God; and this certainty or assurance far
exceeds what we can of ourselves attain, especially when any one
considers his own self. For it is not to be laid down as an abstract
principle, that God is a rewarder to those who seek him; but every one
of us ought individually to apply this doctrine to himself, so that we
may know that we are regarded by God, that he has such a care for our
salvation as never to be wanting to us, that our prayers are heard by
him, that he will be to us a perpetual deliverer. But as none of these
things come to us except through Christ, our faith must ever regard him
and cleave to him alone.

<span id="xvii.iii-p26"></span>From these two clauses, we may learn how,
and why it is impossible for man to please God without faith; God justly
regards us all as objects of his displeasure, as we are all by nature
under his curse; and we have no remedy in our own power. It is hence
necessary that God should anticipate us by his grace; and hence it
comes, that we are brought to know that God is, and in such a way that
no corrupt superstition can seduce us, and also that we become assured
of a certain salvation from him.

<span id="xvii.iii-p27"></span>Were any one to desire a fuller view of
this subject, he should make his commencement here, — that we in vain
attempt to try anything, except we look to God; for the only true end of
life is to promote his glory; but this can never be done, unless there
be first the true knowledge of him. Yet this is still but the half of
faith, and will profit us but little, except confidence be added. Hence
faith will only then be complete and secure us God’s favor, when we
shall feel a confidence that we shall not seek him in vain, and thus
entertain the certainty of obtaining salvation from him. But no one,
except he be blinded by presumption, and fascinated by self­love, can
feel assured that God will be a rewarder of his merits. Hence this
confidence of which we speak recumbs not on works, nor on man’s own
worthiness, but on the grace of God alone; and as grace is nowhere found
but in Christ, it is on him alone that faith ought to be fixed.

<span id="xvii.iv"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 11:7

<span id="xvii.iv-p2"></span>**7.** By faith Noah, being warned of God
of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the
saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became
heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

<span id="xvii.iv-p3"></span>**7.** Fide Noe, divinitus admonitus de iis
quae nondum videbantur, veritus apparavit arcam in salutem domus suae;
per quam condemnavit mundum, et ejus (quae secundum fidem est) justitiae
factus est haeres.

<span id="xvii.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xvii.iv-p5"></span><span id="xvii.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p6"></span>**7.** *By faith Noah,* *etc.* It was a
wonderful example of magnanimity, that when the whole world were
promising themselves impunity, and securely and unrestrainedly indulging
themselves in sinful pleasures, Noah alone paid regard to Gods vengeance
though deferred for a considerable time, — that he greatly wearied
himself for a hundred and twenty years in building the ark, — that he
stood unshaken amidst the scoffs of so many ungodly men, — that he
entertained no doubt but that he would be safe in the midst of the ruin
of the whole world, — yea, that he felt sure of life as it were in the
grave, even in the ark. It is briefly that I shall touch on the subject;
each one can better for himself weigh all the circumstances.

<span id="xvii.iv-p7"></span>The Apostle ascribes to faith the praise of
so remarkable a fortitude. He has been hitherto speaking of the fathers
who lived in the first age of the world; but it was a kind of
regeneration when Noah and his family emerged from the deluge. It is
hence evident that in all ages men have neither been approved by God,
nor performed anything worthy of praise otherwise than by faith.

<span id="xvii.iv-p8"></span>Let us now then see what are the things he
presents to our consideration in the case of Noah. They are the
following, — that having been warned of things to come, but not yet made
visible, he feared, — that he built an ark, — that he condemned the
world by building it, — and that he became the heir of that
righteousness which is faith.  <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md)

<span id="xvii.iv-p12"></span>What I have just mentioned is that which
especially sets forth the power of faith; for the Apostle ever reminds
us of this truth, that faith is the evidence of things not seen; and
doubtless it is its peculiar office to behold in God’s word the things
which are hid, and far removed from our senses. When it was declared to
Noah that there would be a deluge after one hundred and twenty years,
first, the length of time might have removed every fear; secondly, the
thing in itself seemed incredible; thirdly, he saw the ungodly
heedlessly indulging in sinful pleasures; and lastly, the terrible
announcement of a deluge might have appeared to him as intended only to
terrify men. But Noah attended so much to God’s word, that turning away
his eyes from the appearance of things at that time, he feared the
destruction which God had threatened, as though it was present. Hence
the faith which he had in God’s word prepared him to render obedience to
God; and of this he afterwards gave a proof by building the ark.

<span id="xvii.iv-p13"></span>But here a question is raised. Why does
the Apostle make faith the cause of fear, since it has respect to
promises of grace rather than to threatening? For Paul for this reason
calls the Gospel, in which God’s righteousness is offered to us for
salvation, the word of faith. It seems then to have been improperly
stated, that Noah was by faith led to fear. To this, I reply, that faith
indeed properly springs from promises; it is founded on them, it rests
on them. We hence say that Christ is the real object of faith, for
through him our heavenly Father is reconciled to us, and by him all the
promises of salvation are sealed and confirmed. Yet there is no reason
why faith should not look to God and reverently receive whatever he may
say; or if you prefer another way of stating the subject, it rightly
belongs to faith to hear God whenever he speaks, and unhesitatingly to
embrace whatsoever may proceed from his sacred mouth. Thus far it has
regard to commands and threatening, as well as to gratuitous promises.
But as no man is moved as he ought and as much as is needful, to obey
God’s commands, nor is sufficiently stirred up to deprecate his wrath,
unless he has already laid hold on the promises of grace, so as to
acknowledge him as a kind Father, and the author of salvation, — hence
the Gospel is called the word of faith, the principal part being stated
for the whole; and thus is set forth the mutual relation that there is
between them both. Faith, then, though its most direct regard is to
God’s promises, yet looks on his threatening so far as it is necessary
for it to be taught to fear and obey God.

<span id="xvii.iv-p14"></span>*Prepared an ark,* *etc.* Here is pointed
out that obedience which flows from faith as water from a fountain. The
work of building the ark was long and laborious. It might have been
haltered by the scoffs of the ungodly, and thus suspended a thousand
times; nor is there a doubt but they mocked and derided the holy man on
every side. That he then bore their wanton insults with an unshaken
spirit, is a proof that his resolution to obey was not of an ordinary
kind. But how was it that he so perseveringly obeyed God except that he
had previously rested on the promise which gave him the hope of
deliverance; and in this confidence he persevered even to the last; for
he could not have had the courage willingly to undergo so many toils,
nor could he have been able to overcome so many obstacles, nor could he
have stood so firm in his purpose for so long a time, had he not
beforehand possessed this confidence.

<span id="xvii.iv-p15"></span>It hence appears that faith alone is the
teacher of obedience; and we may on the contrary draw this conclusion,
that it is unbelief that prevents us to obey God. And at this day the
unbelief of the world exhibits itself dreadfully in this way, for there
are a very few who obey God.

<span id="xvii.iv-p16"></span>*By the which he condemned the world,*
*etc.* It were strange to say that Noah’s deliverance condemned the
world, and the context will hardly allow faith to be meant; we must then
understand this of the ark. And he is said on two accounts to have by
the ark condemned the world; for by being so long occupied in building
it, he took away every excuse from the wicked; — and the event which
followed proved how just was the destruction of the world; for why was
the ark made the means of deliverance to one family, except that the
Lord thus spared a righteous man that he should not perish with the
ungodly. Had he then not been preserved, the condemnation of the world
would not have been so apparent. Noah then by obeying God’s command
condemned by his example the obstinate disobedience of the world: his
wonderful deliverance from the midst of death, was an evidence that the
world justly perished; for God would have doubtless saved it, had it not
been unworthy of salvation

<span id="xvii.iv-p17"></span>*Of the righteousness which is by faith.*
This is the last thing in the character of Noah, which the Apostle
reminds us to observe. Moses records that he was a righteous man:
history does not expressly say that the cause and root of his
righteousness was faith, but the Apostle declares that as arising from
the facts of the case. And this is not only true, because no one ever
devotes himself really and sincerely to God’s service, but he who relies
on the promises of his paternal kindness, and feels assured that his
life is approved by him; but also on this account, because the life of
no one, however holy it may be, when tried by the rule of God’s law, can
please him without pardon being granted. Then righteousness must
necessarily recumb on faith.

<span id="xvii.v"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 11:8-12

<span id="xvii.v-p2"></span>**8.** By faith Abraham, when he was called
to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance,
obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.

<span id="xvii.v-p3"></span>**8.** Fide Abraham, quum vocatus est,
obedivit ut exiret in locum quem accepturus erat in haereditatem; et
exivit nesciens quo veniret.

<span id="xvii.v-p4"></span>**9.** By faith he sojourned in the land of
promise, as *in* a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac
and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:

<span id="xvii.v-p5"></span>**9.** Fide peregrinatus est in terra
promissa quasi aliena, in tabernaculis habitans cum Isaac et Jacob,
cohaeredibus ejusdem promissionis:

<span id="xvii.v-p6"></span>**10.** For he looked for a city which hath
foundations, whose builder and maker *is* God.

<span id="xvii.v-p7"></span>**10.** Expectavit enim civitatem habentem
fundamenta, cujus architectus et opifex est Deus.

<span id="xvii.v-p8"></span>**11.** Through faith also Sara herself
received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when
she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.

<span id="xvii.v-p9"></span>**11.** Fide et ipsa Sara facultatem ad
conceptionem seminis accepit, et praeter tempus aetatis peperit, quia
fidelem existimavit eum qui promiserat.

<span id="xvii.v-p10"></span>**12.** Therefore sprang there even of one,
and him as good as dead, *so many* as the stars of the sky in multitude,
and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.

<span id="xvii.v-p11"></span>**12.** Propterea etiam ex uno geniti sunt,
et quidem emortuo, multitudine tanquam astra coeli et quasi arena quae
est juxta marginem maris innumerabilis.

<span id="xvii.v-p12"></span> 

<span id="xvii.v-p13"></span><span id="xvii.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p14"></span>**8.** *By faith Abraham,* *etc.* He comes
now to Abraham, who is the chief father of God’s church on earth, and in
whose name the Jews gloried, as though by the distinction of being the
holy race of Abraham alone, they were removed from the common order of
men. But he now reminds them of what they ought to possess as the main
thing, that they might be counted among his children. He therefore calls
their attention to faith, for Abraham himself had no excellency which
did not proceed from faith.

<span id="xvii.v-p15"></span>He first teaches us that faith was the
cause why he immediately obeyed God when he was commanded to remove from
his own country; and then that through the same faith it was that he
went on without wavering, according to what he was called to do even to
the end. By these two things, — his promptness in obeying, and his
perseverance, was Abraham’s faith most clearly proved.

<span id="xvii.v-p16"></span>*When he was called,* *etc.* The old Latin
translator and Erasmus apply this to his name, which is extremely tame
and frigid. On the contrary, I refer it to the oracle by which he was
called from his own country. He indeed did in this way undergo a
voluntary exile, while yet he did nothing but by God’s command; and no
doubt it is one of the chief things which belong to faith, not to move a
step except God’s word shows us the way, and as a lantern gives us
light, according to what David says. (<span id="xvii.v-p16.1"></span>[Ps
119:105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105.md)<span
id="xvii.v-p16.1"></span>.) Let us then learn that it is a thing to be
observed through life, that we are to undertake nothing to which God
does not call us.

<span id="xvii.v-p17"></span>*To go out into a place,*  <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) *etc.* To the command was added a
promise, that God would give him a land for an inheritance. This promise
he immediately embraced, and hastened as though he was sent to take
possession of this land. It is a no ordinary trial of faith to give up
what we have in hand, in order to seek what is afar off, and unknown to
us. For when God commanded him to leave his own country, he did not
point out the place where he intended him to live, but left him in
suspense and perplexity of mind: “go”, he said, “into the place that I
will show thee.” (<span id="xvii.v-p18.1"></span>[Ge
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001)<span id="xvii.v-p18.1"></span>..md)
Why did he defer to point out the place, except that his faith might be
more and more exercised? Besides, the love of his native land might not
only have retarded the alacrity of Abraham, but also held him so bound
to it, so as not to quit his home. His faith then was not of an ordinary
kind, which thus broke through all hindrances and carried him where the
Lord called him to go.

<span id="xvii.v-p19"></span><span id="xvii.v-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p20"></span>**9.** *By faith he sojourned,* *etc.* The
second particular is, that having entered into the land, he was hardly
received as a stranger and a sojourner. Where was the inheritance which
he had expected? It might have indeed occurred instantly to his mind,
that he had been deceived by God. Still greater was the disappointment,
which the Apostle does not mention, when shortly after a famine drove
him from the country, when he was compelled to flee to the land of
Gerar; but the Apostle considered it enough to say, as a commendation to
his faith, that he became a sojourner in the land of promise; for to be
a sojourner seemed contrary to what had been promised. That Abraham then
courageously sustained this trial was an instance of great fortitude;
but it proceeded from faith alone.

<span id="xvii.v-p21"></span>*With Isaac and Jacob,* *etc.* He does not
mean that they dwelt in the same tent, or lived at the same time; but he
makes Abraham’s son and grandson his companions, because they sojourned
alike in the inheritance promised to them, and yet failed not in their
faith, however long it was that God delayed the time; for the longer the
delay the greater was the trial; but by setting up the shield of faith
they repelled all the assaults of doubt and unbelief.  <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md)

<span id="xvii.v-p23"></span><span id="xvii.v-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p24"></span>**10.** *For he looked for,* *etc.* He
gives a reason why he ascribes their patience to faith, even because
they looked forward to heaven. This was indeed to see things invisible.
It was no doubt a great thing to cherish in their hearts the assurance
given them by God respecting the possession of the land until it was
after some ages realized; yet as they did not confine their thoughts,
no, not to that land, but penetrated even into heaven, it was still a
clearer evidence of their faith.

<span id="xvii.v-p25"></span>He calls heaven a *city that has
foundations,* because of its perpetuity; for in the world there is
nothing but what is transitory and fading. It may indeed appear strange
that he makes God the Maker of heavens as though he did not also create
the earth; to this I answer, that as in earthly buildings, the hands of
men make use of materials, the workmanship of God is not unfitly set in
opposition to them. Now, whatever is formed by men is like its authors
in instability; so also is the perpetuity of the heavenly life, it
corresponds with the nature of God its founder.  <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) Moreover, the Apostle teaches us that
all weariness is relieved by expectation, so that we ought never to be
weary in following God.

<span id="xvii.v-p27"></span><span id="xvii.v-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p28"></span>**11.** *Through faith also, Sarah
herself,* *etc.* That women may know that this truth belongs to them as
well as to men, he adduces the example of Sarah; which he mentions in
preference to that of others, because she was the mother of all the
faithful.

<span id="xvii.v-p29"></span>But it may seem strange that her faith is
commended, who was openly charged with unbelief; for she laughed at the
word of the angel as though it were a fable; and it was not the laugh of
wonder and admiration, for otherwise she would not have been so severely
reproved by the angel. It must indeed be confessed, that her faith was
blended with unbelief;  <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) but as
she cast aside her unbelief when reproved, her faith is acknowledged by
God and commended. What then she rejected at first as being incredible,
she afterwards as soon as she heard that it came from God, obediently
received.

<span id="xvii.v-p32"></span>And hence we deduce a useful doctrine, —
that when our faith in some things wavers or halts, it ceases not to be
approved of God, provided we indulge not the spirit of unbelief. The
meaning then is, that the miracle which God performed when Isaac was
born, was the fruit of the faith of Abraham, and of his wife, by which
they laid hold on the power of God.

<span id="xvii.v-p33"></span>*Because she judged him faithful,* *etc.*
These reasons, by which the power and character of faith are set forth,
ought to be carefully noticed. Were any one only to hear that Sarah
brought forth a child through faith, all that is meant would not be
conveyed to him, but the explanation which the Apostle adds removes
every obscurity; for he declares that Sarah’s faith was this, — that she
counted God to be true to his word, that is, to what he had promised.

<span id="xvii.v-p34"></span>There are two clauses to this declaration;
for we hence learn first, that there is no faith without God’s word, for
of his faithfulness we cannot be convinced, until he has spoken. And
this of itself is abundantly sufficient to confute the fiction of the
sophists respecting implicit faith; for we must ever hold that there is
a mutual relation between God’s word and our faith. But as faith is
founded chiefly, according to what has been already said, on the
benevolence or kindness of God, it is not every word, though coming from
his mouth, that is sufficient; but a promise is necessary as an evidence
of his favor. Hence Sarah is said to have counted God faithful who had
promised. True faith then is that which hears God speaking and rests on
his promise.

<span id="xvii.v-p35"></span><span id="xvii.v-p35.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p36"></span>**12.** *Therefore sprang there even of
one,* *etc.* He now also reminds the Jews, that it was by faith that
they were the descendants of Abraham; for he was as it were half dead,
 <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) and Sarah his wife, who had
been barren in the flower of her age, was now sterile, being far
advanced in years. Sooner then might oil be expected to flow from a
stone, than a nation to proceed from them: and yet there sprang from
them an innumerable multitude. If now the Jews are proud of their
origin, let them consider what it was. Whatever they are, everything is
doubtless to be ascribed to the faith of Abraham and Sarah. It hence
follows, that they cannot retain and defend the position they have
acquired in any other way than by faith.

<span id="xvii.vi"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 11:13-16

<span id="xvii.vi-p2"></span>**13.** These all died in faith, not having
received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded
of *them*, and embraced *them*, and confessed that they were strangers
and pilgrims on the earth.

<span id="xvii.vi-p3"></span>**13.** Secundum fidem mortui sunt isti
omnes non acceptis promissionibus, sed quum procul eas vidissent et
credidissent  <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) et salutassent et
confessi essent quod hospites et peregrini erant super terram.

<span id="xvii.vi-p5"></span>**14.** For they that say such things
declare plainly that they seek a country.

<span id="xvii.vi-p6"></span>**14.** Sane qui haec dicunt ostendunt se
patriam inquirere:

<span id="xvii.vi-p7"></span>**15.** And truly, if they had been mindful
of that *country* from whence they came out, they might have had
opportunity to have returned.

<span id="xvii.vi-p8"></span>**15.** Et si quidem illius meminissent a
qua exierant, habebant tempus revertendi:

<span id="xvii.vi-p9"></span>**16.** But now they desire a better
*country*, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be
called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.

<span id="xvii.vi-p10"></span>**16.** Nunc vero meliorem appetunt, id
est, coelestem; quare non erubescit Deus vocari Deus ipsorum, paravit
enim illus civitatem.

<span id="xvii.vi-p11"></span> 

<span id="xvii.vi-p12"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p13"></span>**13.** *These all died in faith,* *etc.*
He enhances by a comparison the faith of the patriarchs: for when they
had only tasted of the promises, as though fully satisfied with their
sweetness, they despised all that was in the world; and they never
forgot the taste of them, however small it was either in life or in
death.  <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md)

<span id="xvii.vi-p15"></span>At the same time the expression *in
faith,* is differently explained. Some understand simply this that they
died in faith, because in this life they never enjoyed the promised
blessings, as at this day also salvation is hid from us, being hoped
for. But I rather assent to those who think that there is expressed here
a difference between us and the fathers; and I give this explanation, —
“Though God gave to the fathers only a taste of that grace which is
largely poured on us, though he showed to them at a distance only an
obscure representation of Christ, who is now set forth to us clearly
before our eyes, yet they were satisfied and never fell away from their
faith: how much greater reason then have we at this day to persevere? If
we grow faint, we are doubly inexcusable”. It is then an enhancing
circumstance, that the fathers had a distant view of the spiritual
kingdom of Christ, while we at this day have so near a view of it, and
that they hailed the promises afar off, while we have them as it were
quite near us; for if they nevertheless persevered even unto death, what
sloth will it be to become wearied in faith, when the Lord sustains us
by so many helps. Were any one to object and say, that they could not
have believed without receiving the promises on which faith is
necessarily founded: to this the answer is, that the expression is to be
understood comparatively; for they were far from that high position to
which God has raised us. Hence it is that though they had the same
salvation promised them, yet they had not the promises so clearly
revealed to them as they are to us under the kingdom of Christ; but they
were content to behold them afar off.  <span
id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md)

<span id="xvii.vi-p17"></span>*And confessed that they were strangers,*
*etc.* This confession was made by Jacob, when he answered Pharaoh, that
the time of his pilgrimage was short compared with that of his fathers,
and full of many sorrows. (<span id="xvii.vi-p17.1"></span>[Ge
47:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#009)<span id="xvii.vi-p17.1"></span>..md)
Since Jacob confessed himself a pilgrim in the land, which had been
promised to him as a perpetual inheritance, it is quite evident that his
mind was by no means fixed on this world, but that he raised it up above
the heavens. Hence the Apostle concludes, that the fathers, by speaking
thus, openly showed that they had a better country in heaven; for as
they were pilgrims here, they had a country and an abiding habitation
elsewhere.

<span id="xvii.vi-p18"></span>But if they in spirit amid dark clouds,
took a flight into the celestial country, what ought we to do at this
day? For Christ stretches forth his hand to us, as it were openly, from
heaven, to raise us up to himself. If the land of Canaan did not engross
their attention, how much more weaned from things below ought we to be,
who have no promised habitation in this world?

<span id="xvii.vi-p19"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p20"></span>**15.** *And truly if they had been
mindful,* *etc.* He anticipates an objection that might have been made,
— that they were strangers because they had left their own country. The
apostle meets this objection, and says, that though they called
themselves strangers, they yet did not think of Mesopotamia; for if they
had a desire to return, they might have done so: but they had willingly
banished themselves from it, nay, they had disowned it, as though it did
not belong to them. By another country, then, they meant, that which is
beyond this world.  <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md)

<span id="xvii.vi-p22"></span><span id="xvii.vi-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vi-p23"></span>**16.** *Wherefore God is not ashamed,*
*etc.* He refers to that passage, “I am the God of Abraham, the God of
Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” (<span id="xvii.vi-p23.1"></span>[Ex
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#006)<span id="xvii.vi-p23.1"></span>..md)
It is a singular honor when God makes men illustrious, by attaching his
name to them; and designs thus to have himself distinguished from idols.
This privilege, as the Apostle teaches us, depends also on faith; for
when the holy fathers aspired to a celestial country, God on the other
hand counted them as citizens. We are hence to conclude, that there is
no place for us among God’s children, except we renounce the world, and
that there will be for us no inheritance in heaven, except we become
pilgrims on earth; Moreover, the Apostle justly concludes from these
words, — “I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,” that they
were heirs of heaven, since he who thus speaks is not the God of the
dead, but of the living.

<span id="xvii.vii"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 11:17-22

<span id="xvii.vii-p2"></span>**17.** By faith Abraham, when he was
tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered
up his only begotten *son*,

<span id="xvii.vii-p3"></span>**17.** Fide Abraham obtulit Isaac quum
tentatus est; ac unigenitum obtulit quum promissiones accepisset;

<span id="xvii.vii-p4"></span>**18.** Of whom it was said, That in Isaac
shall thy seed be called:

<span id="xvii.vii-p5"></span>**18.** Ad quem dictum erat, In Isaac,
vocabitur tibi semen:

<span id="xvii.vii-p6"></span>**19.** Accounting that God *was* able to
raise *him* up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in
a figure.

<span id="xvii.vii-p7"></span>**19.** Quum reputasset Deum etiam ex

<span id="xvii.vii-p10"></span>**21.** By faith Jacob, when he was a

<span id="xvii.vii-p14"></span> 

<span id="xvii.vii-p15"></span><span id="xvii.vii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p16"></span>**17.** *By faith Abraham,* *etc.* He
proceeds with the history of Abraham, and relates the offering up of his
son; and it was a singular instance of firmness, so that there is hardly
another like it to be found. Hence for the sake of enhancing it, he
adds, *when he was tempted,* or tried. Abraham had indeed already proved
what he was, by many trials; yet as this trial surpassed every other, so
the Apostle would have it to be regarded above all his trials. It is
then as though he had said, “The highest excellency of Abraham was the
sacrificing of his son:” for God is said to have then in an especial
manner tried him. And yet this act flowed from faith; then Abraham had
nothing more excellent than faith, which brought forth such
extraordinary fruit.

<span id="xvii.vii-p17"></span>The word, *tempted* or *tried*, means no
other thing than proved. What James says, that we are not tempted by
God, is to be understood differently, (<span
id="xvii.vii-p17.1"></span>[Jas
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013.md)<span
id="xvii.vii-p17.1"></span>;) he means that God does not tempt us to do
evil; for he testifies that this is really done by every man’s own lust.
At the same time he says not that God does not try our integrity and
obedience, though God does not thus search us, as if he knew not
otherwise what is hid in our hearts; nay, God wants no probation that he
may know us; but when he brings us to the light, that we may by our
works show what was before hid, he is said to try or prove us; and then
that which is made openly manifest, is said to be made known to God. For
it is a very usual and frequent mode of speaking in Scripture, that what
is peculiar to men is ascribed to God.

<span id="xvii.vii-p18"></span>The sacrificing of Isaac is to be
estimated according to the purpose of the heart: for it was not owing to
Abraham that he did not actually perform what he was commanded to do.
His resolution to obey was then the same, as though he had actually
sacrificed his son.

<span id="xvii.vii-p19"></span>*And offered up his only-begotten Son,*
*etc.* By these various circumstances, the Apostle intended to show, how
great and how severe the trial of Abraham was; and there are still other
things related by Moses, which had the same tendency. Abraham was
commanded to take his own son, his only begotten and beloved son Isaac,
to lead to the place, which was afterwards to be shown to him, and there
to sacrifice him with his own hands. These tender words God seems to
have designedly accumulated, that he might pierce the inmost heart of
the holy man, as with so many wounds; and then that he might more
severely try him, he commanded him to go a three­days’ journey. How
sharp, must we think, was his anguish to have continually before his
eyes his own son, whom he had already resolved to put to a bloody death!
As they were coming to the place, Isaac pierced his breast with yet a
new wound, by asking him, “Where is the victim?” The death of a son,
under any circumstances, must have been very grievous, a bloody death
would have still caused a greater sorrow; but when he was bidden to slay
his own, — that indeed must have been too dreadful for a father’s heart
to endure; and he must have been a thousand times disabled, had not
faith raised up his heart above the world. It is not then without
reason, that the apostle records that he was then *tried.*

<span id="xvii.vii-p20"></span>It may, however, be asked, why is Isaac
called the only begotten, for Ishmael was born before him and was still
living. To this the answer is, that by God’s express command he was
driven from the family, so that he was accounted as one dead, at least,
he held no place among Abraham’s children.

<span id="xvii.vii-p21"></span>*And he that received the promises,*
*etc.* All the things we have hitherto related, however deeply they must
have wounded the heart of Abraham, yet they were but slight wounds
compared with this trial, when he was commanded, after having received
the promises, to slay his son Isaac; for all the promises were founded
on this declaration, “In Isaac shall thy seed be called,” (<span
id="xvii.vii-p21.1"></span>[Ge
21:12](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#012.md)<span
id="xvii.vii-p21.1"></span>;)  <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md)
for when this foundation was taken away, no hope of blessing or of grace
remained. Here nothing earthly was the matter at issue, but the eternal
salvation of Abraham, yea, of the whole world. Into what straits must
the holy man have been brought when it came to his mind, that the hope
of eternal life was to be extinguished in the person of his son? And yet
by faith he emerged above all these thoughts, so as to execute what he
was commanded. Since it was a marvelous fortitude to struggle through so
many and so great obstacles, justly is the highest praise awarded to
faith, for it was by faith alone that Abraham continued invincibly.

<span id="xvii.vii-p23"></span>But here arises no small difficulty, How
is it that Abraham’s faith is praised when it departs from the promise?
For as obedience proceeds from faith, so faith from the promise; then
when Abraham was without the promise, his faith must have necessarily
fallen to the ground. But the death of Isaac, as it has been already
said, must have been the death as it were of all the promises; for Isaac
is not to be considered as a common man, but as one who had Christ
included in him. This question, which would have been otherwise
difficult to be solved, the Apostle explains by adding immediately, that
Abraham ascribed this honor to God, that he was able to raise his son
again from the dead. He then did not renounce the promise given to him,
but extended its power and its truth beyond the life of his son; for he
did not limit God’s power to so narrow bounds as to tie it to Isaac when
dead, or to extinguish it. Thus he retained the promise, because he
bound not God’s power to Isaac’s life, but felt persuaded that it would
be efficacious in his ashes when dead no less than in him while alive
and breathing.

<span id="xvii.vii-p24"></span><span id="xvii.vii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p25"></span>**19.** *From whence also,* *etc.* As
though he said, “Nor did hope disappoint Abraham, for it was a sort of
resurrection, when his son was so suddenly delivered from the midst of
death. The word *figure,* which is here used, is variously explained. I
take it simply as meaning likeness; for though Isaac did not really rise
from the dead, yet he seemed to have in a manner risen, when he was
suddenly and wonderfully rescued through the unexpected favor of God.
 <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) However, I do not dislike what
some say, who think that our flesh, which is subject to death, is set
forth in the ram which was substituted for Isaac. I also allow that to
be true which some have taught, that this sacrifice was a representation
of Christ. But I have now to state what the Apostle meant, not what may
in truth be said; and the real meaning here, as I think, is, that
Abraham did not receive his Son otherwise than if he had been restored
from death to new life.

<span id="xvii.vii-p27"></span><span id="xvii.vii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p28"></span>**20.** *By faith Isaac,* *etc.* It was
also the work of faith to bless as to future things; for when the thing
itself does not exist and the word only appears, faith must necessarily
bear rule. But first we must notice of what avail is the blessing of
which he speaks. For to *bless* often means to pray for a blessing. But
the blessing of Isaac was very different; for it was as it were an
introduction into the possession of the land, which God had promised to
him and his posterity. And yet he had nothing in that land but the right
of burial. Then strange seemed these high titles, “Let people serve
thee, and tribes bow down to thee,” (<span
id="xvii.vii-p28.1"></span>[Ge
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029.md)<span
id="xvii.vii-p28.1"></span>;) for what dominion could he have given who
himself was hardly a free man? We hence see that this blessing depended
on faith; for Isaac had nothing which he could have bestowed on his
children but the word of God.

<span id="xvii.vii-p29"></span>It may, however, be doubted whether there
was any faith in the blessing given to Esau, as he was a reprobate and
rejected by God. The answer is easy, for faith mainly shone forth, when
he distinguished between the two twins born to him, so that he gave the
first place to the younger; for following the oracle of God, he took
away from the firstborn the ordinary right of nature. And on this
depended the condition of the whole nation, that Jacob was chosen by
God, and that this choice was sanctioned by the blessing of the father.

<span id="xvii.vii-p30"></span><span id="xvii.vii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p31"></span>**21.** *By faith Jacob,* *etc.* It was
the Apostle’s object to attribute to faith whatever was worthy of
remembrance in the history of the people: as, however, it would have
been tedious to recount everything, he selected a few things out of
many, such at this. For the tribe of Ephraim was so superior to the
rest, that they in a manner did lie down under its shade; for the
Scripture often includes the ten tribes under this name. And yet Ephraim
was the younger of the two sons of Joseph, and when Jacob blessed him
and his brother, they were both young. What did Jacob observe in the
younger, to prefer him to the first born? Nay, when he did so, his eyes
were dim with age, so that he could not see. Nor did he lay his right
hand by chance on the head of Ephraim, but he crossed his hands, so that
he moved his right hand to the left side. Besides, he assigned to them
two portions, as though he was now the Lord of that land, from which
famine had driven him away. There was nothing here agreeable to reason;
but faith ruled supreme. If, then, the Jews wish to be anything, they
should glory in nothing else, but in faith.

<span id="xvii.vii-p32"></span>*And worshipped on the top,* *etc.* This
is one of those places from which we may conclude that the points were
not formerly used by the Hebrews; for the Greek translators could not
have made such a mistake as to put staff here for a bed, if the mode of
writing was then the same as now. No doubt Moses spoke of the head of
his couch, when he said <span id="xvii.vii-p32.1"></span>על ראש המטה but
the Greek translators rendered the words, “On the top of his staff” as
though the last word was written, *mathaeh.* The Apostle hesitated not
to apply to his purpose what was commonly received: he was indeed
writing to the Jews; but they who were dispersed into various countries,
had changed their own language for the Greek. And we know that the
Apostles were not so scrupulous in this respect, as not to accommodate
themselves to the unlearned, who had as yet need of milk; and in this
there is no danger, provided readers are ever brought back to the pure
and original text of Scripture. But, in reality, the difference is but
little; for the main thing was, that Jacob worshipped, which was an
evidence of his gratitude. He was therefore led by faith to submit
himself to his son.  <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md)

<span id="xvii.vii-p35"></span><span id="xvii.vii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p36"></span>**22.** *By faith Joseph,* *etc.* This is
the last thing which Moses records respecting the patriarchs, and it
deserves to be particularly noticed; for wealth, luxuries, and honors,
made not the holy man to forget the promise, nor detained him in Egypt;
and this was an evidence of no small faith. For whence had he so much
greatness of mind, as to look down on whatever was elevated in the
world, and to esteem as nothing whatever was precious in it, except that
he had ascended up into heaven. In ordering his bones to be exported, he
had no regard to himself, as though his grave in the land of Canaan
would be sweeter or better than in Egypt; but his only object was to
sharpen the desire of his own nation, that they might more earnestly
aspire after redemption; he wished also to strengthen their faith, so
that they might confidently hope that they would be at length delivered.

<span id="xvii.viii"></span>

<span id="xvii.viii-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 11:23-27

<span id="xvii.viii-p2"></span>**23.** By faith Moses, when he was born,
was hid three months of his parents, because they saw *he was* a proper
child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.

<span id="xvii.viii-p3"></span>**23.** Fide Moses, quum natus esset,
occultatus est menses tres a parentibus suis, quia videbant elegantem
puellum; et non timuerunt edictum regis.

<span id="xvii.viii-p4"></span>**24.** By faith Moses, when he was come
to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;

<span id="xvii.viii-p5"></span>**24.** Fide Moses jam grandis renuit
vocari filius filiae Pharaonis;

<span id="xvii.viii-p6"></span>**25.** Choosing rather to suffer
affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin
for a season;

<span id="xvii.viii-p7"></span>**25.** Potius eligens malis affici cum
populo Dei quam temporales habere peccati delicias;

<span id="xvii.viii-p8"></span>**26.** Esteeming the reproach of Christ
greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the
recompense of the reward.

<span id="xvii.viii-p9"></span>**26.** Majores existimans divitias
probrum Christi quam Aegypti thesauros; intuebatur enim in
remunerationem.

<span id="xvii.viii-p10"></span>**27.** By faith he forsook Egypt, not
fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is
invisible.

<span id="xvii.viii-p11"></span>**27.** Fide reliquit Aegyptum, nec
timuit furorem regis; quasi enim invisibilem vidisset, obduraverat.

<span id="xvii.viii-p12"></span> 

<span id="xvii.viii-p13"></span><span id="xvii.viii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.viii-p14"></span>**23.** *By faith Moses,* *etc.* There
have been others, and those heathens, who from no fear of God, but only
from a desire of propagating an offspring, preserved their own children
at the peril of life; but the Apostle shows that the parents of Moses
were inducted to save him for another reason, even for this, — that as
God had promised to them, under their oppression, that there would come
some time a deliverer, they relied confidently on that promise, and
preferred the safety of the infant to their own.

<span id="xvii.viii-p15"></span>But he seems to say what is contrary to
the character of faith, when he says that they were induced to do this
by the beauty of the child; for we know that Jesse was reproved, when he
brought his sons to Samuel as each excelled in personal appearance; and
doubtless God would not have us to regard what is externally attractive.
To this I answer, that the parents of Moses were not charmed with
beauty, so as to be induced by pity to save him, as the case is commonly
with men; but that there was some mark, as it were, of future excellency
imprinted on the child, which gave promise of something extraordinary.
There is, then, no doubt but that by his very appearance they were
inspired with the hope of an approaching deliverance; for they
considered that the child was destined for the performance of great
things.

<span id="xvii.viii-p16"></span>Moreover, it ought to have had a great
weight with the Jews, to hear that Moses, the minister of their
redemption, had been in an extraordinary manner rescued from death by
means of faith. We must, however, remark, that the faith here praised
was very weak; for after having disregarded the fear of death, they
ought to have brought up Moses; instead of doing so, they exposed him.
It is hence evident that their faith in a short time not only wavered,
but wholly failed; at least they neglected their duty when they cast
forth the infant on the bank of the river. But it behaves us to be more
encouraged when we hear that their faith, though weak, was yet so
approved by God as to secure that life to Moses, on which depended the
deliverance of the Church.

<span id="xvii.viii-p17"></span><span id="xvii.viii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.viii-p18"></span>**24.** *By faith Moses, when he was
come to years,* *etc.* The example of Moses ought to have been
remembered by the Jews, more than that of any other; for through him
they were delivered from bondage, and the covenant of God was renewed,
with them, and the constitution of the Church established by the
publication of the Law. But if faith is to be considered as the main
thing in Moses, it would be very strange and unreasonable that he should
draw them away to anything else. It hence follows that all they make a
poor proficiency in the Law who are not guided by it to faith.

<span id="xvii.viii-p19"></span>Let us now see what the things are for
which he commends the faith of Moses. The first excellency he mentions
is, that when grown up, he disregarded the adoption of Pharaoh’s
daughter. He refers to his age, for had he done this when a boy, it
might have been imputed to his levity, or his ignorance; for as
understanding and reason are not strong in children, they heedlessly
rush headlong into any course of life; young people also are often
carried here and there by unreflecting ardor. That we may then know that
nothing was done thoughtlessly, and without a long deliberation, the
Apostle says, that he was of mature age, which is also evident from
history.  <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md)

<span id="xvii.viii-p22"></span>But he is said to have disregarded his
adoption; for when he visited his brethren, when he tried to relieve
them, when he avenged their wrongs, he fully proved that he preferred to
return to his own nation, rather than to remain in the king’s court: it
was then the same as a voluntary rejection of it. This the Apostle
ascribes to faith; for it would have been much better for him to remain
in Egypt, had he not been persuaded of the blessing promised to the race
of Abraham; and of this blessing, the only witness was God’s promise;
for he could see nothing of the kind with his eyes. It hence appears,
that he beheld by faith what was far removed from his sight.

<span id="xvii.viii-p23"></span><span id="xvii.viii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.viii-p24"></span>**26** *Esteeming the reproach of Christ
greater riches,* *etc.* This clause ought to be carefully noticed; for
we here learn that we ought to shun as a deadly poison whatever cannot
be enjoyed without offending God; for the *pleasures of sin* he calls
all the allurements of the world which draw us away from God and our
calling. But the comforts of our earthly life, which we are allowed by
pure conscience, and God’s permission to enjoy, are not included here.
Let us then ever remember that we ought to know and understand what God
allows us. There are indeed some things in themselves lawful, but the
use of which is prohibited to us, owing to circumstances as to time,
place, or other things. Hence as to all the blessings connected with the
present life, what is ever to be regarded is, that they should be to us
helps and aids to follow God and not hindrances. And he calls these
pleasures of sin temporary or for *a time,* because they soon vanish
away together with life itself.  <span id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md)

<span id="xvii.viii-p26"></span>In opposition to these he sets the
*reproach of Christ,* which all the godly ought willingly to undergo.
For those whom God has chosen, he has also foreordained to be conformed
to the image of his own son; not that he exercises them all by the same
kind of reproaches or by the same cross, but that they are all to be so
minded as not to decline to undertake the cross in common with Christ.
Let every one then bear in mind, that as he is called to this fellowship
he is to throw off all hindrances. Nor must we omit to say, that he
reckons among the reproaches of Christ all the ignominious trials which
the faithful have had to endure from the beginning of the world; for as
they were the member of the same body, so they had nothing different
from what we have. As all sorrows are indeed the rewards of sin, so they
are also the fruits of the curse pronounced on the first man: but
whatever wrongs we endure from the ungodly on account of Christ, these
he regards as his own.  <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) Hence
Paul gloried that he made up what was wanting as to the sufferings of
Christ. Were we rightly to consider this, it would not be so grievous
and bitter for us to suffer for Christ.

<span id="xvii.viii-p33"></span>He also explains more fully what he
means in this clause by the *reproach of Christ,* by what he has
previously declared when he said, that Moses chose to *suffer affliction
with the people of God.* He could not have otherwise avowed himself as
one of God’s people, except he had made himself a companion to his own
nation in their miseries. Since, then, this is the end, let us not
separate ourselves from the body of the Church: whatever we suffer, let
us know that it is consecrated on account of the head. So on the other
hand he calls those things the *treasures of Egypt,* which no one can
otherwise possess than by renouncing and forsaking the Church.

<span id="xvii.viii-p34"></span>*For he had respect unto the recompense
of the reward,* or for he looked to the remuneration.  <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) He proves by the description he gives,
that the magnanimity of Moses’ mind was owing to faith; for he had his
eyes fixed on the promise of God. For he could not have hoped that it
would be better for him to be with the people of Israel than with the
Egyptians, had he not trusted in the promise and in nothing else.

<span id="xvii.viii-p36"></span>But if any one hence concludes, that his
faith did not recumb on God’s mercy alone, because he had respect to the
reward; to this I answer, that the question here is not respecting
righteousness or the cause of salvation, but that the Apostle generally
includes what belongs to faith. Then faith, as to righteousness before
God, does not look on reward, but on the gratuitous goodness of God, not
on our works but on Christ alone; but faith, apart from justification,
since it extends generally to every word of God, has respect to the
reward that is promised; yea, by faith we embrace whatever God promises:
but he promises reward to works; then faith lays hold on this. But all
this has no place in free justification, for no reward for works can be
hoped for, except the imputation of gratuitous justification goes before

<span id="xvii.viii-p37"></span><span id="xvii.viii-p37.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.viii-p38"></span>**27.** *By faith he forsook Egypt,*
*etc.* This may be said of his first as well as of his second departure,
that is, when he brought out the people with him. He then indeed left
Egypt when he fled from the house of Pharaoh. Add to this, that his
going out is recorded by the Apostle before he mentions the celebration
of the Passover. He seems then to speak of the flight of Moses; nor is
what he adds, that he *feared not the wrath of the king,* any objection
to this, though Moses himself relates that he was constrained to do so
by fear. For if we look at the beginning of his course he did not fear,
that is, when he avowed himself to be the avenger of his people.
However, when I consider all the circumstances, I am inclined to regard
this as his second departure; for it was then that he bravely
disregarded the fierce wrath of the king, being armed with such power by
God’s Spirit, that he often of his own accord defied the fury of that
wild beast. It was doubtless an instance of the wonderful strength of
faith, that he brought out a multitude untrained for war and burdened
with many incumbrances, and yet hoped that a way would be opened to him
by God’s hand through innumerable difficulties. He saw a most powerful
king in a furious rage, and he knew that he would not cease till he had
tried his utmost. But as he knew that God had commanded him to depart,
he committed the event to him, nor did he doubt but that he would in due
time restrain all the assaults of the Egyptians.

<span id="xvii.viii-p39"></span>*As seeing him who is invisible.* Nay,
but he had seen God in the midst of the burning bush: this then seems to
have been said improperly, and not very suitable to the present subject.
I indeed allow, that Moses was strengthened in his faith by that vision,
before he took in hand the glorious work of delivering the people; but I
do not admit that it was such a view of God, as divested him of his
bodily senses, and transferred him beyond the trials of this world. God
at that time only showed him a certain symbol of his presence; but he
was far from seeing God as he is. Now, the Apostle means, that Moses so
endured, as though he was taken up to heaven, and had God only before
his eyes; and as though he had nothing to do with men, was not exposed
to the perils of this world and had no contests with Pharaoh. And yet,
it is certain, that he was surrounded with so many difficulties, that he
could not but think sometimes that God was far away from him, or at
least, that the obstinacy of the king, furnished as it was with so many
means of resistance, would at length overcome him.

<span id="xvii.viii-p40"></span>In short, God appeared to Moses in such
a way, as still to leave room for faith; and Moses, when beset by
terrors on every side, turned all his thoughts to God. He was indeed
assisted to do this, by the vision which we have mentioned; but yet he
saw more in God than what that symbol intimated: for he understood his
power, and that absorbed all his fears and dangers. Relying on God’s
promise, he felt assured that the people, though then oppressed by the
tyranny of the Egyptians, were already, as it were, the lords of the
promised land.  <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md)

<span id="xvii.viii-p42"></span>We hence learn, that the true character
of faith is to set God always before our eyes; secondly, that faith
beholds higher and more hidden things in God than what our senses can
perceive; and thirdly, that a view of God alone is sufficient to
strengthen our weakness, so that we may become firmer than rocks to
withstand all the assaults of Satan. It hence follows, that the weaker
and the less resolute any one is, the less faith he has.

<span id="xvii.ix"></span>

<span id="xvii.ix-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 11:28-31

<span id="xvii.ix-p2"></span>**28.** Through faith he kept the Passover,
and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should
touch them.

<span id="xvii.ix-p3"></span>**28.** Fide fecit pascha et aspersionem
sanguinis, ut qui perdebat primogenita non tangeret eos.

<span id="xvii.ix-p4"></span>**29.** By faith they passed through the
Red sea as by dry *land*: which the Egyptians assaying to do were
drowned.

<span id="xvii.ix-p5"></span>**29.** Fide transierunt mare rubrum quasi

<span id="xvii.ix-p6"></span>**30.** By faith the walls of Jericho fell

<span id="xvii.ix-p7"></span>**30.** Fide conciderunt moenia Jericho,

<span id="xvii.ix-p8"></span>**31.** By faith the harlot Rahab perished

<span id="xvii.ix-p10"></span> 

<span id="xvii.ix-p11"></span><span id="xvii.ix-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ix-p12"></span>**28.** *Through faith he kept the
Passover,* *etc.* This ought to have availed much to commend faith to
the Jews; for they held this first sacrifice of the Passover in the
highest esteem. But, he says, that it was kept by faith, not because the
Paschal lamb was a type of Christ, but because its benefit did not
appear, when he sprinkled the doorposts with blood: when therefore the
effect was yet hid, it was necessarily looked for by faith. Nay, it
might have seemed strange, that Moses should set a few drops of blood,
as a remedy, in opposition to God’s vengeance; but being satisfied with
God’s word alone, that the people would be exempt from the scourge that
was coming on the Egyptians, he did not hesitate. Hence the Apostle
justly commends his faith in this respect.

<span id="xvii.ix-p13"></span>They who explain that the Passover was by
faith celebrated by Moses, because he had respect to Christ, say indeed
what is true; but the Apostle here records simply his faith, because he
acquiesced in God’s word alone, when the effect did not appear:
therefore out of place here are philosophical refinements. And the
reason why he mentions Moses alone, as celebrating the Passover, seems
to be this, that God through him instituted the Passover.  <span
id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md)

<span id="xvii.ix-p15"></span><span id="xvii.ix-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ix-p16"></span>**29.** *By faith they passed,* *etc.* It
is certain, that many in that multitude were unbelieving; but the Lord
granted to the faith of a few, that the whole multitude should pass
through the Red Sea dry­shod. But in doing the same thing, there was a
great difference between the Israelites and the Egyptians; while the
former passed through safely, the latter coming after them were drowned.
Whence was this difference, but that the Israelites had the word of God,
and that the Egyptians were without it. The argument then derives its
force from what happened to the contrary; hence, he says, that the
*Egyptians were drowned.* That disastrous event was the punishment of
their temerity, as on the other hand, the Israelites were preserved
safe, because they relied on God’s word, and refused not to march
through the midst of the waters.

<span id="xvii.ix-p17"></span><span id="xvii.ix-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ix-p18"></span>**30.** *By faith the walls of Jericho
fell,* *etc.* As he had before taught us, that the yoke of bondage was
by faith broken asunder, so now he tells us, that by the same faith the
people gained the possession of the promised land. For at their first
entrance the city Jericho stood in their way; it being fortified and
almost impregnable, it impeded any farther progress, and they had no
means to assail it. The Lord commanded all the men­of­war to go round it
once every day, and on the seventh day seven times. It appeared to be a
work childish and ridiculous; and yet they obeyed the divine command;
nor did they do so in vain, for success according to the promise
followed. It is evident, that the walls did not fall through the shout
of men, or the sound of trumpets; but because the people believed that
the Lord would do what he had promised.

<span id="xvii.ix-p19"></span>We may also apply this event to our
benefit and instruction: for it is not otherwise, than by faith, that we
can be freed from the tyranny of the Devil, and be brought to liberty;
and by the same faith, it is that we can put to flight our enemies, and
that all the strongholds of hell can be demolished.

<span id="xvii.ix-p20"></span><span id="xvii.ix-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ix-p21"></span>**31.** *By faith the harlot Rahab,*
*etc.* Though at the first view, this example may seem, on account of
the meanness of the person, hardly entitled to notice, and even unworthy
of being recorded, yet it was not unsuitably, nor without reason,
adduced by the Apostle. He has hitherto shown that the Patriarchs, whom
the Jews most honored and venerated, did nothing worthy of praise except
through faith; and that all the benefits conferred on us by God, even
the most remarkable, have been the fruits of the same faith: but he now
teaches us, that an alien woman, not only of a humble condition among
her own people, but also a harlot, had been adopted into the body of the
Church through faith.

<span id="xvii.ix-p22"></span>It hence follows, that those who are most
exalted, are of no account before God, unless they have faith; and that,
on the other hand, those who are hardly allowed a place among the
profane and the reprobate, are by faith introduced into the company of
angels.

<span id="xvii.ix-p23"></span>Moreover, James also bears testimony to
the faith of Rahab, (<span id="xvii.ix-p23.1"></span>[Jas
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025)<span id="xvii.ix-p23.1"></span>,.md)
and it may be easily concluded from sacred history, that she was endued
with true faith; for she professed her full persuasion of what God had
promised to the Israelites; and of those whom fear kept from entering
the land, she asked pardon for herself and her friends, as though they
were already conquerors; and in all this, she did not consider men, but
God himself. The evidence of her faith was, that she received the spies
at the peril of her life: then, by means of faith, she escaped safe from
the ruin of her own city. She is mentioned as a *harlot,* in order to
amplify the grace of God.

<span id="xvii.ix-p24"></span>Some, indeed, render <span
id="xvii.ix-p24.1"></span>זונה a hostess, as though she kept a public
house, or an inn; but as the word means a harlot everywhere in
Scripture, there is no reason why we should explain it otherwise in this
place. The Rabbis, thinking it strange and disgraceful to their nation,
were it said, that the spies entered into the house of a harlot; have
invented this forced meaning.  <span id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md)
But such a fear was groundless; for in the history of Joshua, this word,
harlot, is expressly added, in order that we may know that the spies
came into the city Jericho clandestinely, and concealed themselves in a
harlot’s house. At the same time this must be understood of her past
life; for faith is an evidence of repentance.

<span id="xvii.x-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 11:32-34

<span id="xvii.x-p2"></span>**32.** And what shall I more say? for the
time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and *of* Barak, and *of* Samson,
and *of* Jephthae; *of* David also, and Samuel, and *of* the prophets:

<span id="xvii.x-p3"></span>**32.** Et quid amplius dicam? deficiet enim
me tempus narrantem de Gedeon, Barac, et Samson, et Jephta, et David, et
Samuel, et Prophetis;

<span id="xvii.x-p4"></span>**33.** Who through faith subdued kingdoms,
wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,

<span id="xvii.x-p5"></span>**33.** Qui per fidem expugnaverunt regna
operati sunt justitiam, adepti sunt promissiones, obturarunt ora leonum.

<span id="xvii.x-p6"></span>**34.** Quenched the violence of fire,
escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed
valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.

<span id="xvii.x-p7"></span>**34.** Extinxerunt vim ignis, effugenunt
aciem gladii, robusti facti sunt ex infirmatate, fortes redditi sunt in
praelio, profligarunt exercitus alienorum.

<span id="xvii.x-p8"></span> 

<span id="xvii.x-p9"></span><span id="xvii.x-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.x-p10"></span>**32.** *And what shall I say more?* *etc.*
As it was to be feared, that by referring to a few examples, he should
appear to confine the praises of faith to a few men; he anticipates
this, and says, that there would be no end if he was to dwell on every
instance; for what he had said of a few extended to the whole Church of
God.

<span id="xvii.x-p11"></span>He first refers to the time that intervened
between Joshua and David, when the Lord raised up judges to govern the
people; and such were the four he now mentions, *Gideon, Barak, Samson*,
and *Jephthah.*

<span id="xvii.x-p12"></span>It seemed indeed strange in *Gideon,* with
three hundred men to attack an immense host of enemies, and to shake
pitchers appeared like a sham alarm. *Barak* was far inferior to his
enemies, and was guided only by the counsel of a woman. *Samson* was a
mere countryman, and had never used any other arms than the implements
of husbandry: what could he do against such proved conquerors, by whose
power the whole people had been subdued? Who would not at first have
condemned the rashness of *Jephthah*, who avowed himself the avenger of
a people already past hope? But as they all followed the guidance of
God, and being animated by his promise, undertook what was commanded
them, they have been honored with the testimony of the Holy Spirit.
 <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md)

<span id="xvii.x-p14"></span>Then the Apostle ascribes all that was
praiseworthy in them to faith; though there was not one of them whose
faith did not halt. *Gideon* was slower to take up arms than what he
ought to have been; nor did he venture without some hesitation to commit
himself to God. *Barak* at first trembled, so that he was almost forced
by the reproofs of Deborah. *Samson* being overcome by the blandishments
of a concubine, inconsiderately betrayed the safety of the whole people.
*Jephthah*, hasty in making a foolish vow, and too obstinate in
performing it, marred the finest victory by the cruel death of his own
daughter. Thus, in all the saints, something reprehensible is ever to be
found; yet faith, though halting and imperfect, is still approved by
God. There is, therefore, no reason why the faults we labor under should
break us down, or dishearten us, provided we by faith go on in the race
of our calling.

<span id="xvii.x-p15"></span>*Of David,* *etc.* Under David’s name he
includes all the pious kings, and to them he adds *Samuel* and the
*Prophets.* He therefore means in short to teach us, that the kingdom of
Judah was founded in faith; and that it stood to the last by faith. The
many victories of David, which he had gained over his enemies, were
commonly known. Known also, was the uprightness of Samuel, and his
consummate wisdom in governing the people. Known too were the great
favors conferred by God on prophets and kings. The Apostle declares that
there are none of these things which ought not to be ascribed to faith.

<span id="xvii.x-p16"></span>But it is to some only of these innumerable
benefits of God that he refers, in order that the Jews might from them
draw a general conclusion, — that as the Church has always been
preserved by God’s hand through faith, so at this day there is no other
way by which we may know his kindness towards us.

<span id="xvii.x-p17"></span>It was by faith that David so many times
returned home as a conqueror; that Hezekiah recovered from his sickness;
that Daniel came forth safe and untouched from the lions’ den, and that
his friends walked in a burning furnace as cheerfully as on a pleasant
meadow. Since all these things were done by faith, we must feel
convinced, that in no other way than by faith is God’s goodness and
bounty to be communicated to us. And that clause ought especially to be
noticed by us, where it is said that they *obtained the promises* by
faith;  <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) for though God continues
faithful, were we all unbelieving, yet our unbelief makes the promises
void, that is, ineffectual to us.

<span id="xvii.x-p20"></span><span id="xvii.x-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.x-p21"></span>**34.** *Out of weakness were made strong,*
*etc.* Chrysostom refers this to the restoration of the Jews from exile,
in which they were like men without hope; I do not disapprove of its
applications to Hezekiah. We might at the same time extend it wider,
that the Lord, by his hand, raised on high his saints, whenever they
were cast down; and brought help to their weakness, so as to endue them
with full strength.

<span id="xvii.xi"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 11:35-40

<span id="xvii.xi-p2"></span>**35.** Women received their dead raised to
life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that
they might obtain a better resurrection:

<span id="xvii.xi-p3"></span>**35.** Receperunt mulieres resurrectione
mortuos suos; alii vero distenti fuerunt, non amplexi redemptionem, ut
meliorem resurrectionem obtinerant;

<span id="xvii.xi-p4"></span>**36.** And others had trial of *cruel*
mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:

<span id="xvii.xi-p5"></span>**36.** Alii autem lubidbria et flagella
experti sunt, praeterea vincula et carceres;

<span id="xvii.xi-p6"></span>**37.** They were stoned, they were sawn
asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in
sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;

<span id="xvii.xi-p7"></span>**37.** Lapidata sunt, dissecti sunt,
tentati sunt, occisione gladii mortui sunt, oberrarunt in pellibus
ovillis, in tergoribus caprinis, destituti, afflicti, malis affecti;

<span id="xvii.xi-p8"></span>**38.** (Of whom the world was not worthy:)
they wandered in deserts, and *in* mountains, and *in* dens and caves of
the earth.

<span id="xvii.xi-p9"></span>**38.** Quibus mundus non erat dignus; in
desertis errantes, in montibus et speluncis et cavernis terrae.

<span id="xvii.xi-p10"></span>**39.** And these all, having obtained a
good report through faith, received not the promise:

<span id="xvii.xi-p11"></span>**39.** Et hi omnes testimonium consequuti
per fidem, non consequuti sunt promissionem:

<span id="xvii.xi-p12"></span>**40.** God having provided some better
thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.

<span id="xvii.xi-p13"></span>**40.** Deo quiddam pro nobis providente,
ne sine nobis perficerentur.

<span id="xvii.xi-p14"></span> 

<span id="xvii.xi-p15"></span><span id="xvii.xi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p16"></span>**35.** *Women received,* *etc.* He had
already mentioned instances in which God had remunerated the faith of
his servants, he now refers to examples of a different kind, — that
saints, reduced to extreme miseries, struggled by faith so as to
persevere invincible even to death. These instances at the first view
widely differ: some triumphed gloriously over vanquished enemies, were
preserved by the Lord through various miracles, and were rescued by
means new and unusual from the midst of death; while others were
shamefully treated, were despised by almost the whole world, were
consumed by want, were so hated by all as to be compelled to hide
themselves in the coverts of wild beasts, and lastly, were drawn forth
to endure savage and cruel tortures: and these last seemed wholly
destitute of God’s aid, when he thus exposed them to the pride and the
cruelty of the ungodly. They seem then to have been very differently
treated from the former ones; and yet faith ruled in both, and was alike
powerful in both; nay, in the latter its power shone forth in a much
clearer light. For the victory of faith appears more splendid in the
contempt of death than if life were extended to the fifth generation. It
is a more glorious evidence of faith, and worthy of higher praise, when
reproaches, want, and extreme troubles are borne with resignation and
firmness, than when recovery from sickness is miraculously obtained, or
any other benefit from God.

<span id="xvii.xi-p17"></span>The sum of the whole is, that the
fortitude of the saints, which has shone forth in all ages, was the work
of faith; for our weakness is such that we are not capable of overcoming
evils, except faith sustains us. But we hence learn, that all who really
trust in God are endued with power sufficient to resist Satan in
whatever way he may assail them, and especially that patience in
enduring evils shall never be wanting to us, if faith be possessed; and
that, therefore, we are proved guilty of unbelief when we faint under
persecutions and the cross. For the nature of faith is the same now as
in the days of the holy fathers whom the Apostle mentions. If, then, we
imitate their faith, we shall never basely break down through sloth or
listlessness.

<span id="xvii.xi-p18"></span>*Others were tortured,* *etc.* As to this
verb, ἐτυμπανίσθησαν, I have followed Erasmus, though others render it
“imprisoned.” But the simple meaning is, as I think, that they were
stretched on a rack, as the skin of a drum, which is distended.  <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) By saying that they were *tempted,* he
seems to have spoken what was superfluous; and I doubt not but that the
likeness of the words, ἐπρίσθησαν and ἐπειρὰσθησαν, was the reason that
the word was added by some unskillful transcriber, and thus crept into
the text, as also Erasmus has conjectured.  <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) By *sheepskins* and *goatskins* I do
not think that tents made of skins are meant, but the mean and rough
clothing of the saints which they put on when wandering in deserts.

<span id="xvii.xi-p21"></span>Now though they say that Jeremiah was
stoned, that Isaiah was sawn asunder, and though sacred history relates
that Elijah, Elisha, and other Prophets, wandered on mountains and in
caves; yet I doubt not but he here points out those persecutions which
Antiochus carried on against God’s people, and those which afterwards
followed.

<span id="xvii.xi-p22"></span>*Not accepting deliverance,* *etc.* Most
fitly does he speak here; for they must have purchased a short lease of
life by denying God; but this would have been a price extremely
shameful. That they might then live forever in heaven, they rejected a
life on earth, which would have cost them, as we have said, so much as
the denial of God, and also the repudiation of their own calling. But we
hear what Christ says, that if we seek to save our lives in this world,
we shall lose them for ever. If, therefore, the real love of a future
resurrection dwells in our hearts, it will easily lead us to the
contempt of death. And doubtless we ought to live only so as to live to
God: as soon as we are not permitted to live to God, we ought willingly
and not reluctantly to meet death. Moreover, by this verse the Apostle
confirms what he had said, that the saints overcome all sufferings by
faith; for except their minds had been sustained by the hope of a
blessed resurrection, they must have immediately failed.  <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md)

<span id="xvii.xi-p24"></span>We may hence also derive a needful
encouragement, by which we may fortify ourselves in adversities. For we
ought not to refuse the Lord’s favor of being connected with so many
holy men, whom we know to have been exercised and tried by many
sufferings. Here indeed are recorded, not the sufferings of a few
individuals, but the common persecutions of the Church, and those not
for one or two years, but such as continued sometimes from grandfathers
even to their grandchildren. No wonder, then, if it should please God to
prove our faith at this day by similar trials; nor ought we to think
that we are forsaken by him, who, we know, cared for the holy fathers
who suffered the same before us.  <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md)

<span id="xvii.xi-p26"></span><span id="xvii.xi-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p27"></span>**38.** *Of whom the world was not
worthy,* *etc.* As the holy Prophets wandered as fugitives among wild
beasts, they might have seemed unworthy of being sustained on the earth;
for how was it that they could find no place among men? But the Apostle
inverts this sentiment, and says that the world was not worthy of them;
for wherever God’s servants come, they bring with them his blessing like
the fragrance of a sweet odor. Thus the house of Potiphar was blessed
for Joseph’s sake, (<span id="xvii.xi-p27.1"></span>[Ge
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#005)<span id="xvii.xi-p27.1"></span>;.md)
and Sodom would have been spared had ten righteous men been found in it.
(<span id="xvii.xi-p27.2"></span>[Ge
18:32](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#032.md)<span
id="xvii.xi-p27.2"></span>.) Though then the world may cast out God’s
servants as offscourings, it is yet to be regarded as one of its
judgments that it cannot bear them; for there is ever accompanying them
some blessing from God. Whenever the righteous are taken away from us,
let us know that such events are presages of evil to us; for we are
unworthy of having them with us, lest they should perish together with
us.

<span id="xvii.xi-p28"></span>At the same time the godly have abundant
reasons for consolation, though the world may cast them out as
offscourings; for they see that the same thing happened to the prophets,
who found more clemency in wild animals than in men. It was with this
thought that Hilary comforted himself when he saw the church taken
possession of by sanguinary tyrants, who then employed the Roman emperor
as their executioner; yea, that holy man then called to mind what the
Apostle here says of the Prophets; — “Mountains and forests,” he said,
“and dungeons and prisons, are safer for me than splendid temples; for
the Prophets, while abiding or buried in these, still prophesied by the
Spirit of God.” So also ought we to be animated so as boldly to despise
the world; and were it to cast us out, let us know that we go forth from
a fatal gulf, and that God thus provides for our safety, so that we may
not sink in the same destruction.

<span id="xvii.xi-p29"></span><span id="xvii.xi-p29.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p30"></span>**39.** *And these all,* *etc.* This is an
argument from the less to the greater; for if they on whom the light of
grace had not as yet so brightly shone displayed so great a constancy in
enduring evils, what ought the full brightness of the Gospel to produce
in us? A small spark of light led them to heaven; when the sun of
righteousness shines over us, with what pretense can we excuse ourselves
if we still cleave to the earth? This is the real meaning of the
Apostle.  <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md)

<span id="xvii.xi-p37"></span>I know that Chrysostom and others have
given a different explanation, but the context clearly shows, that what
is intended here is the difference in the grace which God bestowed on
the faithful under the Law, and that which he bestows on us now. For
since a more abundant grace is poured on us, it would be very strange
that we should have less faith in us. He then says that those fathers
who were endued with so remarkable a faith, had not yet so strong
reasons for believing as we have. Immediately after he states the
reason, because God intended to unite us all into one body, and that he
distributed a small portion of grace to them, that he might defer its
full perfection to our time, even to the coming of Christ.

<span id="xvii.xi-p38"></span>And it is a singular evidence of God’s
benevolence towards us, that though he has shown himself bountifully to
his children from the beginning of the world, he yet has so distributed
his grace as to provide for the well­being of the whole body. What more
could any of us desire, than that in all the blessings which God
bestowed on Abraham, Moses, David, and all the Patriarchs, on the
Prophets and godly kings, he should have a regard for us, so that we
might be united together with them in the body of Christ? Let us then
know that we are doubly and treble ungrateful to God, if less faith
appears in us under the kingdom of Christ than the fathers had under the
Law, as proved by so many remarkable examples of patience. By the words,
that they received not the promise, is to be understood its ultimate
fulfillment, which took place in Christ, on which subject something has
been said already.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[200](cc44016.htm#fr_199.md) <span
id="xvii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p7"></span> Griesbach makes the division at the
thirty-eighth verse of the last chapter, and this is no doubt what the
subject requires. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[201](cc44016.htm#fr_200.md) <span
id="xvii.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p8"></span> “Faith is here generally described, not
only as it justifies, but also as it acts towards God and lays hold on
his promises, works, and blessings revealed in his word, past, present,
and future." — *Pareus.*

<span id="fn_201"></span>[202](cc44016.htm#fr_201.md) <span
id="xvii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p11"></span> The two words “substance” and “evidence”
have been variously rendered, though the meaning continues materially
the same: “substinance” and “demonstration” by Beza: “confident
expectation” and “conviction” by Grotius and Doddridge: “confidence” and
“evidence” by Macknight: “confidence” and “convincing evidence” by
Stuart. When the primary meaning of words is suitable, there is no
necessity of having recourse to what is secondary. The first word means
properly a foundation, a basis, a prop, a support: and what can be more
appropriate here? Faith is the basis or the prop (as Calvin renders it
in his exposition) of things hoped for; that is, faith is the foundation
of hope; it is the fulcrum on which hope rests. The other word is
properly “demonstration” a proof supported by reasons — what is made
clear and evident. Conviction is the result of demonstration. So, then,
the meaning is this — faith sustains hope, and exhibits to view things
unseen: it is the basis on which the objects of hope rest, and the
demonstration or manifestation of what is not seen.

<span id="xvii.i-p12"></span>The word “substance” is derived from the
Vulgate: though its etymological meaning corresponds with the original,
yet its received meaning is quite different. The original word occurs
five times in the New Testament, and is rendered “confidence” in <span
id="xvii.i-p12.1"></span>[2 Cor. 9:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#004.md),
[2 Cor. 11:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#017.md)<span
id="xvii.i-p12.1"></span>; <span id="xvii.i-p12.2"></span>[Heb
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb003.htm#014.md)<span id="xvii.i-p12.2"></span>, —
“person” in <span id="xvii.i-p12.3"></span>[Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003.md)<span id="xvii.i-p12.3"></span>, —
and here “substance;” but why not its more literal meaning,
“foundation?”

<span id="xvii.i-p13"></span>The things “hoped for” include the
promises; but the things “not seen,” all that is revealed as to what is
past and is to come, — the creation, the future destiny of man, etc. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[203](cc44016.htm#fr_202.md) <span
id="xvii.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p11"></span> Macknight and Stuart render the word
“ancients” and more suitably in our language. The word “elders” most
commonly refers to age, but “ancients” to time: those meant here were
such as lived before and under the Law. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[204](cc44016.htm#fr_203.md) <span
id="xvii.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p14"></span> The verb rendered in our version
“obtained a good report,” is rendered by Calvin, “obtained a testimony;”
by Beza, “were approved;” by Macknight “were born witness to;” and
Stuart, “obtained commendation”. It is better to retain the idea of a
testimony, as a reference is made either to the written testimony of
Scripture, or to some express testimony given by God, as in the case of
Abel. As the verb is everywhere used in a good sense, as referring to a
good testimony, “the good report” of our version, or “the honorable
testimony” of Doddridge, seems to convey the right meaning. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[205](cc44016.htm#fr_204.md) <span
id="xvii.ii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p17"></span> That is “We, by faith in God’s word which
gives the record, understand, or know how the world was made.” This the
heathens did not know by the light of reason, and yet they might have
known this, as the Apostle declares in <span
id="xvii.ii-p17.1"></span>[Ro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p17.1"></span>.
The reference here, according to this view, is to the fact, to the case
as it was, but in the Romans to what ought to have been the case.

<span id="xvii.ii-p18"></span>Why “worlds?” the same word, though in the
plural number is rendered “world” in <span id="xvii.ii-p18.1"></span>[Ro
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#036.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p18.1"></span>
and <span id="xvii.ii-p18.2"></span>[1Co
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p18.2"></span>,
and so here by Beza and others. The universe, the whole visible
creation, is what is meant, as it appears from “seen” in the next
clause: and the word αἰὼν, in the singular number, says Stuart, is not
employed to designate the “world” that is the universe. It is said to be
used plurally to express the various parts of which the world is
composed. But the term “world” in our language comprehends the whole: it
means the whole visible creation.

<span id="xvii.ii-p19"></span>The verb “framed,” is rendered “compacted”
by Beza — “adjusted” by Doddridge — “produced” by Macknight — and
“formed” by Stuart. Calvin has “fitted” or joined together, <span
id="xvii.ii-p19.1"></span>aptata, the word used by the Vulgate. It is
justly said by Leigh, that the verb properly means to compact or knit
together disjointed parts, either of a body or a building. But it is
used also in the sense of adjusting, fitting, preparing, setting in
order, and perfecting, or completing. It is most commonly used in the
sense of making perfect or complete. But we may render the words “the
world was set in order by the word of God.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[206](cc44016.htm#fr_205.md) <span
id="xvii.ii-p22.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p23"></span> Moderns no less than the ancients differ
from Calvin as to this clause; and yet his explanation is more suited to
the passage, and especially to εἰς τὸ which means properly, to the end
that, or, in order to, denoting the object or final cause. But there is
no authority for making ἐκ and φαινομένων one word as he proposes: yet
if the transposition of μὴ be admitted, which both ancient and modern
critics allow, the meaning advocated by Calvin may still be defended:
“in order that of things not apparent there might be things visible;”
the things not apparent or visible being the power, wisdom and goodness
of God, in exact harmony with <span id="xvii.ii-p23.1"></span>[Ro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p23.1"></span>,
where God’s power and divinity are said to be “invisible things” — τὰ
ἀόρατα: they are things not apparent.

<span id="xvii.ii-p24"></span>Again, the verb κατηρτίσθαι denotes not
creation, but the fitting or adjusting, or setting in order of things
previously created: it seems to designate the work done, not as
described in the first verse of Genesis, but in the following verses: so
that the object or design of this adjustment or arrangement is what is
expressed in this clause; it was, that there might be visible things as
evidence or manifestations of things invisible.

<span id="xvii.ii-p25"></span>It may be further said, that the world is
said to have been set in order by the word of God: and so it is recorded
in Genesis: but this word or fiat is not mentioned in the first verse of
that book, in which the heavens and the earth are said to have been
created. It hence appears that the reference here is to the setting in
order of this world, and not to the first creation of its materials; and
if so, the second clause cannot refer to the creation of the world out
of nothing, as it is necessarily connected with what the first clause
contains.

<span id="xvii.ii-p26"></span>“Faith” then refers here, if this view
must be taken, not to the fact that the world was made by God, which
even heathens admitted, but to the design of God in creation, the
manifestation of his own glory. “The heavens,” says the Psalmist
“declare the glory of God,” etc. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[207](cc44016.htm#fr_206.md) <span
id="xvii.ii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p32"></span> “Abel’s offering was more acceptable than
that of Cain, because he had faith.” — Grotius.

<span id="xvii.ii-p33"></span>The word “sacrifice,” θυσία, means
properly an offered victim, but sometimes anything offered to God.
Indeed Abel’s sacrifice is called in <span id="xvii.ii-p33.1"></span>[Ge
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p33.1"></span>,
an offering. The word πλείων is literally more, but is used in the sense
of more in number, quantity or excellency. The last is evidently the
meaning here; for Abel’s offering, according to the account given, was
not in the number or quantity, but in quality. Then a better or a more
excellent sacrifice, and not a fuller, as some have rendered it, is the
right version. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_207"></span>[208](cc44016.htm#fr_207.md) <span
id="xvii.ii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p35"></span> What the Apostle evidently refers to are
these words, “the Lord had respect to Abel and to his offering.” He
calls this “testifying.” How this was done, we are not told. The divine
approbation was in some way conveyed; there was respect had to Abel and
to his offering, but not to Cain nor to his offering. The Apostle says
here first, that Abel “obtained a testimony that he was righteous,” and
then he adds by way of explanation: God testifying of his gifts. It
seems then that the approbation of his gifts was the testimony he
received that he was righteous, this was evidently the meaning of the
Apostle. Now the question is, how was this testimony as to that
sacrifice. What was it? Such, we may reasonably conclude as was given in
other recorded instances; it was by fire sent from heaven to consume the
sacrifice. See <span id="xvii.ii-p35.1"></span>[Le
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/lev009.htm#024.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p35.1"></span>;

<span id="xvii.ii-p36"></span>“By which,” and “by it,” are commonly
referred to faith, but the passage would be plainer, by referring them
to “the sacrifice.” It was by the means or medium of the sacrifice, that
the testimony was given, and it was on the account of it that Abel was
put to death; “and through it, having died, he yet speaketh;” that is,
though he died, owing to his sacrifice being approved, he yet speaketh,
that is, by his example as a believer, say some, in the atonement; as a
sufferer in behalf of the truth, say others. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[209](cc44016.htm#fr_208.md) <span
id="xvii.ii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.ii-p39"></span> Though this view has been taken by
Grotius and many others, yet the one suggested above is what has been
mostly adopted. It is Abel himself who here speaks as a man of faith; it
is the voice of his blood that is referred to in <span
id="xvii.ii-p39.1"></span>[Heb
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#024.md)<span id="xvii.ii-p39.1"></span>.

id="xvii.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iii-p12"></span> It is the Sept. that is followed by the
Apostle. Instead of “he walked with God,” we have here, “he pleased
God;” and for, “he was not,” the phrase is “he was not found.” One part
of the verse is nearly a literal quotation, “and he was not found,
because God had translated him;” and this ought to be put
parenthetically, for what follows is connected with the first clause, as
it contains a reason for what is there asserted; Enoch was through faith
translated, for he had a testimony that he pleased God; and to please
God is an evidence of faith, as proved by the following verse.

<span id="xvii.iii-p13"></span>Strange are the vagaries of learned men!
Some of the German divines have attempted to prove that Enoch was not
translated without dying. Though no words can express the event more
clearly than those of the Apostle. This is an instance of what men will
do to support a false system, when once fully imbibed. — *Ed*.

<span id="xvii.iii-p17"></span> To “come to God,” is very expressive,
and is literally the word. To “approach to” by Doddridge, and “to
worship,” by Macknight, are no improvements, but otherwise. God is
represented as sitting on the throne of grace; hence the idea of coming
to him. Enoch walked with God, as though God was a friend and a
companion; hence to come to him is the appropriate expression. Stuart
says, that it is a metaphor derived from the practice of coming to the
temple to worship, God being represented as there present. — *Ed*.

<span id="xvii.iii-p24"></span> Calvin does not connect “diligently”
with seeking, as in our version. Merely to seek, is what the verb means.
It is rendered in <span id="xvii.iii-p24.1"></span>[Ac
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017.md)<span
id="xvii.iii-p24.1"></span>, “to seek after,” and so in <span

12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017.md)<span
id="xvii.iii-p24.3"></span>. It is found often in the Sept. in the sense
of seeking, and stands for a verb in Hebrew, which means simply to seek.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[215](cc44016.htm#fr_214.md) <span
id="xvii.iv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.iv-p9"></span> This is a very clear statement of the case
of Noah. Many learned critics have given a different view, among
moderns, Stuart and Dr. Bloomfield. The word rendered very correctly in
our version, “being moved with fear,” they have rendered “with
reverence” connecting it with “prepared.” The only other instance in
which it occurs, it has the meaning of fear or dread, as to the
consequences, see <span id="xvii.iv-p9.1"></span>[Ac
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#010.md)<span id="xvii.iv-p9.1"></span>.
Besides, the whole tenor of the passage comports with this meaning: what
was the warning? It was that of a dreadful judgment; and how is judgment
to be regarded, but with fear? Faith, as Calvin will tell us presently,
regards judgments as well as promises. Men are exhorted to flee from the
wrath to come: when they believe that there is a wrath to come, do not
they fear? Doddridge and Scott coincide with Calvin.

<span id="xvii.iv-p10"></span>The other difference is, as to δἰ ἦς, “by
which,” before “condemned.” This is not so manifestly wrong as the
other, yet the meaning which Calvin gives is the most obvious, and the
most suitable. Stuart refers “which” to faith, while it ought evidently
to be referred to the ark; Noah by building the ark which he did by
faith, condemned the conduct of others in neglecting to provide for the
coming destruction. His preparation, done by faith, condemned their
neglect, which was owing to unbelief.

<span id="xvii.iv-p11"></span>As to the word “heir,” it means an heir in
prospect, and an heir in possession, as in <span
id="xvii.iv-p11.1"></span>[Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md)<span id="xvii.iv-p11.1"></span>.
So it is evidently to be understood here. Noah became heir or possessor
of the righteousness, which is by faith. The rendering of Stuart is
nothing so expressive as the literal, “and obtained the justification
which is by faith.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[216](cc44016.htm#fr_215.md) <span
id="xvii.v-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p18"></span> This is differently connected by Calvin,
his version is “by faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed, so that he
went forth,” etc. Bloomfield by supposing ωστε understood before
ἐξελθεῖν, seems to be of the same opinion. Beza renders the verb by a
gerund, “abiendo,” by departing. This construction is more agreeable to
the location of the words; the other introduces an unnatural
transposition. Besides, the idea is somewhat different. There are thus
two things in the verse stated more directly, as evidences and proofs of
faith, — his departure from his own country, and his ignorance as to the
country where he was going. His faith was such that he obeyed, so as to
leave his own country, and also to go to a country, of which he knew
nothing. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_216"></span>[217](cc44016.htm#fr_216.md) <span

<span id="xvii.v-p22"></span> The preposition μετὰ may often be rendered
“as well as.” See <span id="xvii.v-p22.1"></span>[Mt

“dwelling in tents, as well as Isaac and Jacob, co-heirs to the same

to what is stated. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_217"></span>[218](cc44016.htm#fr_217.md) <span
id="xvii.v-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.v-p26"></span> The words, “builder and maker,” are
rendered by Calvin, “master builder and maker.” The terms seem reversed.
The first word means the maker or worker; and the second, the
master-builder or planner. Beza’s version is, “the maker, (artifex) and
the founder, (conditor).” The order is, according to what is very common
in Scripture, the effect mentioned first, then the cause, of the maker
first, then the contriver. The last word, no doubt used in the sense of
a worker or maker, but also in the sense of an architect or planner; but
the former word means a skillful worker or artificer, but not a
master-builder. In order, therefore, to give a sistant meaning to each,
the sentence is to be thus rendered, — “Whose maker and planner is God;”
he not only made it, but also planned and contrived it. — *Ed*.

<span id="xvii.v-p30"></span> “The same thing is affirmed of Abraham,
<span id="xvii.v-p30.1"></span>[Ge

The truth is the first annunciation, that a child would spring from
them, occasioned both in his and Sarah’s mind a feeling of incongruity,
of impossibility, that the course of nature should be so reversed.
Subsequent consideration brought both to a full belief in the reality of
the promised blessing.” — Stuart.

<span id="xvii.v-p31"></span>It is remarkable, that at the first
announcement Abraham laughed, as Sarah did afterward; and not only so,
but he also said, “O that Ishmael might live before thee!” evidently
showing that he did not then believe the promise which had been made to
him. In the following chapter, <span id="xvii.v-p31.1"></span>[Ge
18:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#010.md)<span

<span id="xvii.v-p37"></span> Calvin renders ταῦτα adverbially “quidem,”

id="xvii.v-p37.1"></span>, “in the like manner;” and this would be the

begetting children, — “Therefore even from one, and him in a like manner
dead, there sprang so many as the stars,” etc. — *Ed*

<span id="xvii.vi-p16"></span> Mention is made of “promises;” and then
“heavenly country” is the only thing afterwards specified. Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob had received many promises which were not fulfilled to
them — a numerous seed, the land of Canaan, the Messiah, the
resurrection (implied in the promise of being their God) and the
heavenly country. There is no reason why all these should not form the
“promises” which they saw afar and embraced, though the promise of the
heavenly country is alone afterwards, expressly mentioned, it being as
it were the completion of all the other promises, and suitably referred
to after the acknowledgment they made of being strangers and sojourners
on the earth. Their faith embraced all the promises, while it had a
especial reference to the eternal inheritance, which though they entered
into rest, as to their spirits, they have not yet attained, and which
shall not be attained either by them, or by us, until Christ’s second
coming, when we shall together be introduced into the heavenly country.

<span id="xvii.vi-p21"></span> “But now they desire,” etc. The
historical present is used here instead of the past tense — “But now
they desired, etc.” So Beza, Grotius, and others. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[225](cc44016.htm#fr_224.md) <span
id="xvii.vii-p21.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p22"></span> The words literally are “In Isaac shall
be called to thee a seed.” But the Hebrew <span
id="xvii.vii-p22.1"></span>ב and the Greek ἐν, mean often by or through,
or by the means of: and the Hebrew verb, to be called, as well as the
Greek, may sometimes be rendered to be. Hence Macknight seems to have
been right in his version of the clause, “By Isaac a seed shall be
thee;” which is better than that of Stuart, “After Isaac shall thy seed
be named,” for this is less literal, and the meaning is not conveyed. —
*Ed*

<span id="fn_225"></span>[226](cc44016.htm#fr_225.md) <span
id="xvii.vii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p26"></span> The meaning given by Stuart and some
others is very far fetched, though said to be natural, that “Abraham
believed that God could raise Isaac from the dead, because he had, as it
were, obtained him from the dead, i.e., he was born of those who were
dead as to these things.” Hence the rendering given is “comparatively.”
Abraham had, as to his purpose, sacrificed him, so that he considered
him as dead; and he received him back from the dead, not really, but in
a way bearing a likeness to such a miracle. This sense is alone
compatible with the former clause, which mentions Abraham’s faith in
God’s power to raise his son from the dead; he believed that God was
able to do this; and then it is added that Abraham had received back his
son as though he had sacrificed him, and as though God had raised him
from the dead. What actually took place bore a likeness to the way which
he had anticipated. Costallio gives the meaning, “it was the same as
though he had sacrificed him, and received him also in a manner he
received him.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[227](cc44016.htm#fr_226.md) <span
id="xvii.vii-p32.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.vii-p33"></span> Various have been the opinions on this
clause. It is clear that the words here refer to a time different from
that mentioned in <span id="xvii.vii-p33.1"></span>[Ge
47:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen047.htm#031.md)<span
id="xvii.vii-p33.1"></span>. They are connected in Genesis with the oath
which Joseph made to his father to bury him in Canaan; but here with the
blessing of his sons recorded in the following chapter, <span
id="xvii.vii-p33.2"></span>[Gen.
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#016.md)<span id="xvii.vii-p33.2"></span>.
These were two separate transactions, and the words only occur in the
first; and it seems from the words of the Apostle, that the act and
position of Jacob were also the same in the second instance.

<span id="xvii.vii-p34"></span> The points are of no authority; and the
Apostle adopted the Septuagint version, and thus sanctioned it: and
there is no reason to dispute that sanction. David is said to worship
upon his bed, (<span id="xvii.vii-p34.1"></span>[1Ki
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#047.md)<span
id="xvii.vii-p34.1"></span>;) but the word for bed there is different.
All the difficulty here vanishes, if we throw aside as we ought to do,
the points. The word for worship in Hebrew means to prostrate one’s self
on the ground, the humblest mode of adoration; but it is used also to
designate merely an act of worship. See <span
id="xvii.vii-p34.2"></span>[1Sa
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#003.md)<span id="xvii.vii-p34.2"></span>;

id="xvii.viii-p20.1"></span>, about forty years of age. The word
“great,” both in Hebrew and Greek, has sometimes this meaning. “When
arrived at mature age,” by Stuart, is better than “when he was grown
up,” by Doddridge and Macknight.

<span id="xvii.viii-p21"></span>It is said that he refused, that is by
his conduct. He acted in such a way as to show that he rejected the
honor of being adopted son of Pharoah’s daughter. The verb means to
deny, to renounce, to disown. He renounced the privilege offered to him.
Others are said to “deny the power” of godliness, that is by their
works. <span id="xvii.viii-p21.1"></span>[2Ti

“than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin:” by Macknight, “than to

words seem rather to refer to the sin of indulgence in vain and

<span id="xvii.viii-p29"></span>The reproach like that of Christ: as
Christ, though rich, became poor to redeem mankind, so Moses despised
the treasures of Egypt, for the purpose of delivering Israel from
bondage. A similar construction is found in <span

“The sufferings of Christ,” that is, like those of Christ. — Stuart.

<span id="xvii.viii-p30"></span>The reproach for Christ, that is, for
avowing his expectation of him in common with the distressed people.
Macknight, Scott, Bloomfield. For this opinion there is not a particle
of evidence from the account we have in Exodus. The Egyptians knew
nothing of the redeemer; they therefore could not have reproached the
Israelites on his account.

<span id="xvii.viii-p31"></span>The reproach of Christ’s people, the
word Christ being sometimes taken for his Church, <span

<span id="xvii.viii-p32"></span>The second view is the most
satisfactory, and is confirmed by <span id="xvii.viii-p32.1"></span>[Heb

<span id="xvii.viii-p35"></span> The words are very striking, “For he
looked away,” that is, from difficulties or present trials, “unto the
retribution,” the rendering of the recompose. What was the retribution?
It was what corresponded with what he did by faith: he engaged by faith
in the work of delivering his brethren from bondage. His retribution in
this work was, no doubt, then undertaking for his own nation. What his
faith in God’s promise enabled him to look to, was the deliverance of
his people, which was to be his retribution. In this respect he acted,
though in a business infinitely inferior, on the same principle with the
Savior, “who for the joy (of redeeming mankind) that was set before him,
endured the cross,” etc. <span id="xvii.viii-p35.1"></span>[Heb

persevered; for the reference is not to sufferings, but to trials and
difficulties: he was made strong by faith in an invisible God to resist
and surmount them all. “He was strengthened,” Doddridge; “he
courageously persevered,” Macknight; “he continued steadfast,” Stuart.

instituted the Passover.” The verb is properly to make, but like <span

senses. Doddridge has “celebrated;” Macknight, “appointed;” and Stuart,
“observed.” To make the Passover is, no doubt, to keep or observe it;
for such is the meaning of the phrase, as it appears from <span
id="xvii.ix-p14.2"></span>[Num. 9:10](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#011.md)<span id="xvii.ix-p14.2"></span>.
The word πάσχα is doubtless a Syriac term, and derived originally from
the Hebrew <span id="xvii.ix-p14.3"></span>פסה which means to pass over;
though several of the Greek fathers derived it from πάσχειν, to suffer.
It sometimes means the paschal feast, <span
id="xvii.ix-p14.4"></span>[Lu
22:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#011.md)<span id="xvii.ix-p14.4"></span>,
and sometimes the paschal Lamb, <span id="xvii.ix-p14.5"></span>[Mr
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#012.md)<span id="xvii.ix-p14.5"></span>;
<span id="xvii.ix-p14.6"></span>[1Co

id="xvii.ix-p24.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.ix-p25"></span> And it has been adopted by many of the
German divines, who seem in many instances to follow any vagary,
Rabbinical or heathen, rather than the word of God. There is nothing in
Scripture that countenances this notion. The word is never used in the
sense of a hostess: and the ancient versions ever render the Hebrew word
by πόρνη, a harlot. — *Ed*

<span id="xvii.x-p13"></span> The history of Gideon we have in <span
id="xvii.x-p13.1"></span>[Jud
6:11-8:35](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#011.md)<span
id="xvii.x-p13.1"></span>: of Barak, in <span
id="xvii.x-p13.2"></span>[Jud
4:6-5:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#006.md)<span
id="xvii.x-p13.2"></span>: of Samson, in <span
id="xvii.x-p13.3"></span>[Jud
13:24-16:31](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#024.md)<span
id="xvii.x-p13.3"></span>: and of Jephthah, in <span
id="xvii.x-p13.4"></span>[Jud
11:1-12:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#001.md)<span
id="xvii.x-p13.4"></span>. Thus we see that the order of time in which
they lived is not here observed, it being not necessary for the object
of the Apostle. Barak was before Gideon, Jephthah before Samson, and
Samuel before David. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[236](cc44016.htm#fr_235.md) <span
id="xvii.x-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.x-p18"></span> The previous sentence, “wrought
righteousness,” is differently understood. Some refer it to a righteous
and upright course of life, and others to the conduct of rulers and
judges. The latter is the most suitable meaning here; and the words may
be rendered “executed justice.” Samuel was an example of this.

<span id="xvii.x-p19"></span>To “obtain promises” is to receive the
things promised. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[237](cc44016.htm#fr_236.md) <span
id="xvii.xi-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p19"></span> The τύμπανον was, according to
Schleusner, a machine on which the body was stretched; and then cudgels
or rods, and whips were used. This appears from the account given in
<span id="xvii.xi-p19.1"></span>[2 Macc.
6:19](../../../bib/apo/ma2006.htm#019.md),
[30](../../../bib/apo/ma2006.htm#030.md)<span id="xvii.xi-p19.1"></span>.
It is said that Eleasar, rather than transgress the Law, went of his own
accord “to the torment” — ἐπὶ τὸ τύμπανον, and in the 30th verse mention
is made of stripes or strokes — πληγαῖς, and of being lashed or whipped
— μαστιγούμενος. This was to be tympanized or tortured. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_237"></span>[238](cc44016.htm#fr_237.md) <span
id="xvii.xi-p19.2"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p20"></span> This conjecture not countenanced by any
MSS. that are considered to have much weight. What has led to this
conjecture has evidently been a misunderstanding as to the import of the
word in this connection. Being a word of general import, it has been
viewed as inappropriate here among words of specified meaning: it refers
to the temptation or trial to which those who were condemned for their
religion were commonly exposed — the offer of life and of favors and
recantation: that seems to have been the special temptation here
intended. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[239](cc44016.htm#fr_238.md) <span
id="xvii.xi-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p23"></span> The verse concludes with these words
“that they might obtain a better resurrection,” — better than what?
Better than the resurrection referred to at the beginning of the verse,
when it is said that “women received their dead raised to life again;”
or better than the life promised by persecutors to those doomed to die,
in case they renounced their religion. The former is the view taken by
Scott and Stuart, and the latter by Doddridge: but as deliverance and no
deliverance are facts in contrast, the first is the most obvious
meaning.—*Ed*.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[240](cc44016.htm#fr_239.md) <span
id="xvii.xi-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p25"></span> The conclusion of the 37th verse is,
“being destitute, afflicted, tormented:” this is said of those who
“wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins.” They were destitute,
they had been oppressed or persecuted and unjustly dealt with. Wrong
treatment and oppression or persecution drove them from there homes and
destitution followed. This is the way in which things are often stated
in Scripture; the effect or the present state first, and then the cause
or what led to it. The words are rendered “destitute, afflicted,
maltreated,” by Macknight, — and “suffering want, afflicted, injuriously
treated,” by Stuart. The second word often means oppression or
persecution. The third word is found only here and <span
id="xvii.xi-p25.1"></span>[Heb
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002.md)<span id="xvii.xi-p25.1"></span>
where it is rendered “suffer adversity.” It is found in the Sept., in
<span id="xvii.xi-p25.2"></span>[1Ki
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#026.md)<span id="xvii.xi-p25.2"></span>,
twice and <span id="xvii.xi-p25.3"></span>[1Ki
11:39](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#039.md)<span id="xvii.xi-p25.3"></span>.
It is used by Aqula in <span id="xvii.xi-p25.4"></span>[Ex
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#022.md)<span id="xvii.xi-p25.4"></span>,
and in <span id="xvii.xi-p25.5"></span>[Job
37:23](../../../bib/kjv/job037.htm#023.md)<span id="xvii.xi-p25.5"></span>.
Its meaning properly is, to be ill or wrongfully treated. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[241](cc44016.htm#fr_240.md) <span
id="xvii.xi-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.xi-p31"></span> This is materially the view taken by
Beza, Doddridge, Scott and Stuart. The “promise” is deemed to be
especially that of Christ. The ancients heard of him, believed in his
coming, but did not witness it. The “some better thing” is considered to
be the same with the promise, or to be the Gospel as revealed, or in the
words of Stuart, “the actual fulfillment of the promise respecting the
Messiah.”

<span id="xvii.xi-p32"></span>Still there is something unsatisfactory in
this view as to “the promise,” as Stuart seems to intimate. There are
two verses, <span id="xvii.xi-p32.1"></span>[Heb.
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036.md), [Heb.
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#015.md)<span id="xvii.xi-p32.1"></span>,
which seem to throw light on this subject: by the first we find that
“the promise” is future to us as well as to the ancient saints; and by
the second, that “the better thing” is the atoning death of Christ,
which was to the ancient saints an unfulfilled event, but to us
fulfilled and clearly revealed, and yet its benefits extended to them as
well as to us.

<span id="xvii.xi-p33"></span>The “promise” throughout this Epistle is
that of “the eternal inheritance” and “the promises” in <span
id="xvii.xi-p33.1"></span>[Heb
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md)<span id="xvii.xi-p33.1"></span>
include this and others, and especially “the better things,” that is the
Gospel, or fulfillment of what was necessary to attain the inheritance,
even the death and resurrection of Christ; or we may say that it is “the
better hope,” (<span id="xvii.xi-p33.2"></span>[Heb
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#019)<span id="xvii.xi-p33.2"></span>.md)
or the “better covenant, which was established on better promises,”
(<span id="xvii.xi-p33.3"></span>[Heb
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb008.htm#006)<span id="xvii.xi-p33.3"></span>..md)
The verses may be thus rendered —

<span id="xvii.xi-p34"></span>“And all these, having obtained a good
report through faith, have not received the promise: 40. God having
foreordained as to us something more excellent, so that they without us
might not be perfected;” that is, in body as well as in soul.

<span id="xvii.xi-p35"></span>The sentiment seems to be this, — “the
ancient saints believed God’s promise, respecting an eternal inheritance
after the resurrection: they died in hope of this, they have not yet
obtained it, and for this reason, because God had designed to fulfill to
us what he had also promised to them, even the coming of a Redeemer; it
is necessary that this more excellent thing than what had in this world
been vouchsafed to them, should take place, as on it depended everything
connected with the promise of the ‘heavenly city:’ so that without the
more excellent thing fulfilled to us, their perfect state, in body as
well as in soul, was not to be attained.”

<span id="xvii.xi-p36"></span>Their souls are perfect, for we as
Christians are said to have come “to the spirits of just men made
perfect,” (<span id="xvii.xi-p36.1"></span>[Heb
12:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#023.md)<span
id="xvii.xi-p36.1"></span>;) they who die in the Lord are said to “rest
from their labors,” and are pronounced blessed or happy. (<span
id="xvii.xi-p36.2"></span>[Re
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rev014.htm#013.md)<span
id="xvii.xi-p36.2"></span>.) But they are not in possession of the
inheritance promised them, neither the ancients nor those who now die in
the Lord.The promise as to both will not be fulfilled until the glorious
day of the resurrection. Then all the saints, whether before or after
the coming of Christ, will at the same time, with pure and immortal
bodies, united to pure spirits, be together introduced into their
eternal inheritance which he promised to Abraham and his seed, when he
said that he would be their God. Christ referred to that declaration as
an evidence of the resurrection. (<span id="xvii.xi-p36.3"></span>[Lu
20:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#037.md)<span
id="xvii.xi-p36.3"></span>.) Then the Patriarchs believed that there
would be a resurrection. — *Ed.*
