<span id="iv-p1"></span>TO THE READER

<span id="iv-p2"></span>Dear Christian Reader, among the many helps
wherewith God has furnished thee for the furtherance of thy godly
Meditations and spiritual growth in Christ, I pray thee accept of this
amongst the rest; of which (if I may so speak) thou has been too long
unfurnished. Diverse good and godly men have labored, some by their own
writings, and some again by translating the works of others, to store
thee with Sermons and Expositions in English, upon all the books of the
New Testament, this Epistle to the Hebrews lonely excepted: which lack,
rather than it should be unsupplied, has caused me (the unfittest I
confess at many thousands) to undertake the translation of the
Commentary ensuing: which being finished, I have been bold (for thy
benefit Christian Reader) now to publish. Hoping therefore of thy
friendly allowance and acceptance of these my poor endeavors: I beseech
thee, if thou reap that benefit thereby, which I heartily with thou may,
to give God the praise, and to help me with thy prayers. Thus commending
thee and thy studies to the grace of God, I bid thee farewell.

<span id="iv-p3"></span>Thine ever in Christ,  
C.C.
