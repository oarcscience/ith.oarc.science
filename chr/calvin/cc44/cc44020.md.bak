<span id="xxi-p1"></span>A TRANSLATION OF

<span id="xxi-p2"></span>CALVIN’S VERSION OF

<span id="xxi-p3"></span>THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS

<span id="xxi.i"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="xxi.i-p3"></span>**1** God having formerly spoken many times
and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets,

<span id="xxi.i-p4"></span>**2** Has in these last days spoken to us by
the Son, whom he has constituted the heir of all things, by whom also he
made the worlds;

<span id="xxi.i-p5"></span>**3** Who being the effulgence of his glory,
and the impress of his person, and sustaining all things by his powerful
word, having by himself effected the purgation of our sins, sat down on
the right hand of Majesty on high;

<span id="xxi.i-p6"></span>**4** Being so much superior to the angels,
as he has inherited a name more excellent than they.

<span id="xxi.i-p7"></span>**5** For to whom of the angels has he ever
said, “My Son art thou, I have this day begotten thee?”

<span id="xxi.i-p8"></span>**6** And again, “I will be to him a Father,
and he shall be to me a Son?” and again, when he introduces the
first­begotten into the world, he says, “And adore him let all the
angels of God.

<span id="xxi.i-p9"></span>**7** And of the angels he saith, “Who makes
his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire:”

<span id="xxi.i-p10"></span>**8** But of the Son, “Thy throne, O God, is
for ever and ever; a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy
kingdom:

<span id="xxi.i-p11"></span>**9** Thou hast loved righteousness and
hated iniquity; therefore God hath anointed thee, *even* thy God, with
the oil of joy above thy companions:”

<span id="xxi.i-p12"></span>**10** And, “Thou art from the beginning, O
Lord, thou hast founded the earth, and the works of thine hands are the
heavens;

<span id="xxi.i-p13"></span>**11** They shall perish, but thou
continuest; and all as a garment shall become old,

<span id="xxi.i-p14"></span>**12** And as a vesture shalt thou roll them
up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years
shall not fail.”

<span id="xxi.i-p15"></span>**13** But to whom of the angels has he ever
said, “Sit at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?”

<span id="xxi.i-p16"></span>**14** Are they not all administrative
spirits, who are sent forth to minister for those who are to inherit
salvation?

<span id="xxi.ii"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="xxi.ii-p3"></span>**1** Wherefore we ought to attend more to
those things which we hear, lest at any time we let *them flow* away.

<span id="xxi.ii-p4"></span>**2** For if the word which had been
declared by angels, was sure, and every transgression and disobedience
received a just recompense of reward;

<span id="xxi.ii-p5"></span>**3** How shall we escape, if we neglect so
great a salvation? which, having first been begun to be declared by the
Lord, has been confirmed to as by those who had heard him;

<span id="xxi.ii-p6"></span>**4** While God was at the same time bearing
a testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles, and gift
distributed by the Holy Spirit, according to his will.

<span id="xxi.ii-p7"></span>**5** For to the angels has he not subjected
the future world of which we speak:

<span id="xxi.ii-p8"></span>**6** But one has in a certain place
testified, saying, “What is man, that thou art mindful of him” or the
son of man, that thou visitest him?

<span id="xxi.ii-p9"></span>**7** Thou hast made him a little inferior
to the angels; with glory and honor hast thou crowned him, and hast set
him over the works of thine hands:

<span id="xxi.ii-p10"></span>**8** All things hast thou made subject
under his feet.” Doubtless in making subject all things to him, he left
nothing that is not made subject: notwithstanding we do not as yet see
all things made subject to him;

<span id="xxi.ii-p11"></span>**9** But we behold Jesus, who was made a
little inferior to the angels, (crowned with glory and honor for having
suffered death,) that he might by the grace of God taste death for all.

<span id="xxi.ii-p12"></span>**10** For it became him, for whom *are*
all things, and through whom *are* all things, in leading many sons to
glory, to consecrate the leader of their salvation by sufferings:

<span id="xxi.ii-p13"></span>**11** For he who sanctifies and they who
are sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call
them brethren;

<span id="xxi.ii-p14"></span>**12** Saying, “I will declare thy name to
my brethren; in the midst of the Church will I sing to thee:” and again,
“I will trust in him;”

<span id="xxi.ii-p15"></span>**13** And again, “Behold I and the
children whom God has given me.”

<span id="xxi.ii-p16"></span>**14** Since then the children partake of
flesh and blood, he also in like manner was partaker of the same, that
by death he might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the
devil;

<span id="xxi.ii-p17"></span>**15** And might deliver them who through
fear of death were all their life subject to bondage.

<span id="xxi.ii-p18"></span>**16** For he nowhere takes hold on angels;
but on the seed of Abraham does he take hold.

<span id="xxi.ii-p19"></span>**17** It hence behooved him to become in
all things like his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful
high priest in things respecting God, in order to atone for the sins of
the people:

<span id="xxi.ii-p20"></span>**18** For as it happened to him to be
tried, he is able to succor them who are tried.

<span id="xxi.iii"></span>

<span id="xxi.iii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.iii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="xxi.iii-p3"></span>**1** Therefore, holy brethren, partakers
of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and the High Priest of our
profession, Christ Jesus:

<span id="xxi.iii-p4"></span>**2** Who was faithful to him who had
appointed him, as Moses also was in his whole house.

<span id="xxi.iii-p5"></span>**3** For of greater glory was he counted
worthy than Moses, as the builder has greater honor than the house
itself

<span id="xxi.iii-p6"></span>**4** Every house is indeed built by some
one; but he who has built all things is God.

<span id="xxi.iii-p7"></span>**5** And Moses was indeed faithful in his
whole house as a minister, for a testimony to those things which were
afterwards to be declared;

<span id="xxi.iii-p8"></span>**6** But Christ as a Son over his own
house; whose house we are, if we hold firm the confidence and the
glorying of our hope to the end.

<span id="xxi.iii-p9"></span>**7** Therefore (as the Holy Spirit saith,
“Today, if ye will hear his voice,

<span id="xxi.iii-p10"></span>**8** Harden not your hearts, as in the
provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness,

<span id="xxi.iii-p11"></span>**9** When your fathers tempted me, proved
me, and saw my works forty years:

<span id="xxi.iii-p12"></span>**10** I was therefore offended with that
generation, and said, They always err in heart, and they have not known
my ways;

<span id="xxi.iii-p13"></span>**11** So I swore in my wrath, They shall
not enter into my rest”)

<span id="xxi.iii-p14"></span>**12** See, brethren, that there be not at
any time in any of you the wicked heart of unbelief, by departing from
the living God:

<span id="xxi.iii-p15"></span>**13** But exhort one another daily, while
it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through the deception of
sin.

<span id="xxi.iii-p16"></span>**14** For we are become partakers of
Christ, if indeed we hold firm the beginning of our confidence to the
end,

<span id="xxi.iii-p17"></span>**15** since it is said, “Today, if ye
will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation:”

<span id="xxi.iii-p18"></span>**16** For some, when they had heard, did
provoke; but not all who had come out of Egypt by Moses.

<span id="xxi.iii-p19"></span>**17** With whom then was he offended for
forty years? was it not with them who had sinned, whose carcasses fell
in the wilderness

<span id="xxi.iii-p20"></span>**18** And to whom did he swear that they
should not enter into his rest, except to the unbelieving?

<span id="xxi.iii-p21"></span>**19** We then see that they could not
enter in on account of unbelief.

<span id="xxi.iv"></span>

<span id="xxi.iv-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.iv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="xxi.iv-p3"></span>**1** Let us then fear, lest, when a promise
of entering into his rest remains, any of us should seem to be
disappointed of it;

<span id="xxi.iv-p4"></span>**2** For to us has the promise been
announced as well as to them; but the word heard did not profit them,
for it was not connected with faith in those who heard *it.*

<span id="xxi.iv-p5"></span>**3** For we enter into his rest when we
believe; as he has said, “As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall
enter into my rest;” though the works were done at the creation of the
world;

<span id="xxi.iv-p6"></span>**4** For he has said thus in a certain
place of the seventh day, “And God rested on the seventh day from all
his works:”

<span id="xxi.iv-p7"></span>**5** And here again, “If they shall enter
into my rest.”

<span id="xxi.iv-p8"></span>**6** Seeing then it remains that some do
enter into it, but they to whom it was first preached did not enter in
on account of unbelief.

<span id="xxi.iv-p9"></span>**7** Again he defines a certain day, saying
by David, “Today,” after so long a time, (as it is said,) “Today, if ye
will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.”

<span id="xxi.iv-p10"></span>**8** For if Joshua had given them rest, he
would not have spoken of another after those days.

<span id="xxi.iv-p11"></span>**9** Then there remains a Sabbath­rest for
the people of God;

<span id="xxi.iv-p12"></span>**10** For he who is entered into his rest,
has also himself rested from his own works, as God from his.

<span id="xxi.iv-p13"></span>**11** Let us then strive to enter into
that rest, lest no one fail according to the same example of unbelief.

<span id="xxi.iv-p14"></span>**12** For living is the word of God and
efficacious, and more penetrating than any two­edged sword, reaching
even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow,
and *is* a discerner of the thoughts and intentions of the heart:

<span id="xxi.iv-p15"></span>**13** For there is no creature which does
not appear before him; nay, all things are naked and open to the eyes of
him with whom we have to do.

<span id="xxi.iv-p16"></span>**14** Having then a great high priest, who
has entered into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our
profession:

<span id="xxi.iv-p17"></span>**15** For we have not a high priest who
cannot sympathize with our infirmities; but *was in* all things tempted
like as we are, yet without sin.

<span id="xxi.iv-p18"></span>**16** Let us then come with confidence to
the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace for a
seasonable help.

<span id="xxi.v"></span>

<span id="xxi.v-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.v-p2"></span>CHAPTER 5

<span id="xxi.v-p3"></span>**1** For every high priest, taken from men,
is appointed for men as to things pertaining to God, that he may offer
gifts and sacrifices for sins;

<span id="xxi.v-p4"></span>**2** Who can render himself gentle to the
ignorant and the erring, since he himself is also surrounded with
infirmity:

<span id="xxi.v-p5"></span>**3** And on this account he ought, as for
the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.

<span id="xxi.v-p6"></span>**4** And no one takes to himself this honor,
but he, who is called by God, as Aaron also *was.*

<span id="xxi.v-p7"></span>**5** *So* also Christ glorified not himself
that he became a high priest, but he who said to him, “My Son art thou,
I have this day begotten thee;”

<span id="xxi.v-p8"></span>**6** As also he says in another place, “Thou
art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec:”

<span id="xxi.v-p9"></span>**7** Who in the days of his flesh, when he
offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, to
him who was able to save him from death, and was heard in what he
feared;

<span id="xxi.v-p10"></span>**8** Though he was a Son, yet learned
obedience from those things which he suffered;

<span id="xxi.v-p11"></span>**9** And being sanctified, he became to all
who obey him the author of eternal salvation;

<span id="xxi.v-p12"></span>**10** Having been called by God a priest
according to the order of Melchisedec:

<span id="xxi.v-p13"></span>**11** If whom we have much to say to you,
and difficult to be explained, since ye are dull of hearing.

<span id="xxi.v-p14"></span>**12** For when ye ought for the time to be
teachers, ye have again need that one should teach you the elements of
the beginning of God’s words, and are become such as have need of milk,
And not of strong meat:

<span id="xxi.v-p15"></span>**13** For every one who partakes of milk is
inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is an infant;

<span id="xxi.v-p16"></span>**14** But strong meat is for the perfect,
who through practice have their senses exercised so as to distinguish
between good and evil.

<span id="xxi.vi"></span>

<span id="xxi.vi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.vi-p2"></span>CHAPTER 6

<span id="xxi.vi-p3"></span>**1** Therefore, passing by the first
doctrine of Christ, let us be born onward to perfection, not laying
again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God,

<span id="xxi.vi-p4"></span>**2** (of the doctrine of baptisms and of
the imposition of hands,) and of resurrection of the dead, and of
eternal judgment;

<span id="xxi.vi-p5"></span>**3** And this we shall do, if God will
permit.

<span id="xxi.vi-p6"></span>**4** For it is impossible that those who
have been once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have
been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,

<span id="xxi.vi-p7"></span>**5** And have tasted the good word of God,
and the powers of the world to come,

<span id="xxi.vi-p8"></span>**6** And have fallen away, should be
renewed again into repentance, they having again crucified to themselves
the Son of God, and exposed him to open shame.

<span id="xxi.vi-p9"></span>**7** For the earth, which drinketh the rain
which often cometh upon it, and bringeth forth a blade meet for them by
whom it is cultivated, receiveth a blessing from God:

<span id="xxi.vi-p10"></span>**8** But that which beareth thorns and
briers is worthless and nigh a curse, the end of which is to be burned.

<span id="xxi.vi-p11"></span>**9** But we are persuaded, beloved, of
better things respecting you, and those connected with salvation, though
we thus speak:

<span id="xxi.vi-p12"></span>**10** For God is not unjust, that he
should forget your work, and the labor of that love which yon have
shewed towards his name, since ye have ministered to the saints, and do
minister.

<span id="xxi.vi-p13"></span>**11** But we desire that every one of you
should shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the
end;

<span id="xxi.vi-p14"></span>**12** So that ye may not become slothful,
but be followers of those who by faith and patience have inherited the
promises.

<span id="xxi.vi-p15"></span>**13** For when God made a promise to
Abraham, since he bad none greater by whom he could swear, he swore by
himself,

<span id="xxi.vi-p16"></span>**14** Saying, “Blessing I will bless thee,
and multiplying I will multiply thee:”

<span id="xxi.vi-p17"></span>**15** And so after having patiently
waited, he obtained the promise.

<span id="xxi.vi-p18"></span>**16** For men indeed swear by one who is
greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all dispute:

<span id="xxi.vi-p19"></span>**17** Therefore God, willing more
abundantly to shew to the heirs of salvation the immutability of his
counsel, interposed an oath;

<span id="xxi.vi-p20"></span>**18** That by two immutable things, in
which it was impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong
consolation, who have fled to lay hold on the hope set before us:

<span id="xxi.vi-p21"></span>**19** Which we have as an anchor of the
soul, safe and firm, and entering into what is within the veil;

<span id="xxi.vi-p22"></span>**20** Where our forerunner, Jesus, has
entered, having been made a high priest for ever, according to the order
of Melchisedec.

<span id="xxi.vii"></span>

<span id="xxi.vii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.vii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 7

<span id="xxi.vii-p3"></span>**1** For this Melchisedec, the king of
Salem, *was a* priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning
from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,

<span id="xxi.vii-p4"></span>**2** To whom also Abraham divided the
tenth of all; who is first indeed, by interpretation, called the King of
righteousness, and then also the King of Salem, that is, the King of
peace;

<span id="xxi.vii-p5"></span>**3** Without father, without mother,
without kindred, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but
being made like to the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.

<span id="xxi.vii-p6"></span>**4** Now consider how great is he, to whom
the patriarch Abraham gave even the tenth of the spoils.

<span id="xxi.vii-p7"></span>**5** And they indeed who receive the
priesthood, even those who are of the sons of Levi, have a command to
take the tenth, according to the law from the people, that is, from
their brethren, though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham:

<span id="xxi.vii-p8"></span>**6** But he whose kindred is not counted
from them, took the tenth from Abraham, and blessed him who had the
promises:

<span id="xxi.vii-p9"></span>**7** And without all controversy, the less
is blessed by the greater.

<span id="xxi.vii-p10"></span>**8** And here indeed men who die receive
the tenth; but there he, of whom it is testified that he liveth;

<span id="xxi.vii-p11"></span>**9** And as I may so say, Levi who is
wont to receive the tenth, paid the tenth in Abraham;

<span id="xxi.vii-p12"></span>**10** For he was as yet in the loins of
his father when Melchisedec met him.

<span id="xxi.vii-p13"></span>**11** If then there was perfection by the
Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what
need there was still, that another priest should rise after the order of
Melchisedec, and should not be called after the order of Aaron?

<span id="xxi.vii-p14"></span>**12** For when the priesthood is changed,
there is also necessarily *a* change of the law.

<span id="xxi.vii-p15"></span>**13** Doubtless he of whom these things
are said, was from another tribe, from which no one attended at the
altar:

<span id="xxi.vii-p16"></span>**14** For it is clear that our Lord
descended from the tribe of Judah, of which tribe Moses has said nothing
as to the priesthood;

<span id="xxi.vii-p17"></span>**15** And it is still more clear, since
another priest was to rise according to the order of Melchisedec;

<span id="xxi.vii-p18"></span>**16** Who was not made according to the
law of a carnal command, but according to the power of a permanent life;

<span id="xxi.vii-p19"></span>**17** For he thus testifies, “Thou art a
priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.”

<span id="xxi.vii-p20"></span>**18** For there is an abrogation of the
former command, on account of its weakness and uselessness;

<span id="xxi.vii-p21"></span>**19** For the law perfected nothing, but
*was* an introduction to a better hope, by which we draw nigh to God;

<span id="xxi.vii-p22"></span>**20** And this *is* better, because it
was not done without an oath:

<span id="xxi.vii-p23"></span>**21** For they indeed are made priests
without an oath; but he with an oath by him who said to him, “Thou art a
priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.”

<span id="xxi.vii-p24"></span>**22** Of so much a better covenant is
Jesus made the surety.

<span id="xxi.vii-p25"></span>**23** And they indeed being many were
made priests, for they were not suffered by death to continue:

<span id="xxi.vii-p26"></span>**24** But he, as he remains perpetually,
has an unchangeable priesthood.

<span id="xxi.vii-p27"></span>**25** Hence he is able also to save for
ever those who through him come to God, always living, that he may
intercede for them.

<span id="xxi.vii-p28"></span>**26** For such a high priest became us,
being holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and higher than
the heavens;

<span id="xxi.vii-p29"></span>**27** Who has no need, as the priests,
daily to offer sacrifices, first for their own sins, and then for *the
sins* of the people; for this he did once when he offered up himself.

<span id="xxi.vii-p30"></span>**28** The law indeed makes men priests
who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the Law,
the Son, made perfect for ever.

<span id="xxi.viii"></span>

<span id="xxi.viii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.viii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 8

<span id="xxi.viii-p3"></span>**1** Now of the things which have been
said the sum is, — Such an high priest have we, that hath sat down on
the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,

<span id="xxi.viii-p4"></span>**2** A minister of the sanctuary, even of
the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched and not man.

<span id="xxi.viii-p5"></span>**3** For every high priest is appointed
to offer gifts and sacrifices: it is hence necessary that he also should
have that which he might offer.

<span id="xxi.viii-p6"></span>**4** If indeed he were on earth, he could
not be a priest, since there are priests who offer gifts according to
the law;

<span id="xxi.viii-p7"></span>**5** Who minister in \[that which *is*\]
the exemplar and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was warned by the
oracle, when he was about to make the tabernacle, “See,” he says, “that
thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn to thee in
the mount.”

<span id="xxi.viii-p8"></span>**6** But now he has obtained a more
excellent ministry, inasmuch as he is the Mediator of a better covenant,
which has been established on better promises.

<span id="xxi.viii-p9"></span>**7** For if the first had been faultless,
there would have been no place sought for the second.

<span id="xxi.viii-p10"></span>**8** For finding fault with them, he
says, “Behold, the days are coming, saith the Lord, when I shall make
with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant;

<span id="xxi.viii-p11"></span>**9** Not according to the covenant I
made with their fathers in the day when I laid hold on their hand to
lead them up from the land of Egypt; because they have not continued in
my covenant and I disregarded them, saith the Lord:

<span id="xxi.viii-p12"></span>**10** For this is the covenant which I
will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord, I
will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts will I write them;
and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people;

<span id="xxi.viii-p13"></span>**11** And they shall not teach every one
his neighbor, and every one his brother, saying, Know thou the Lord; for
all shall know me, from the least among them to the greatest;

<span id="xxi.viii-p14"></span>**12** For I will be merciful to their
unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities will I no more remember.”
By calling it new, he hath made old the first; and that which is old and
aged is on the eve of vanishing.

<span id="xxi.ix"></span>

<span id="xxi.ix-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.ix-p2"></span>CHAPTER 9

<span id="xxi.ix-p3"></span>**1** The first then had indeed ordinances
of worship and a worldly sanctuary:

<span id="xxi.ix-p4"></span>**2** For there was made the first
tabernacle in which *were* the candlestick, and the table, and the
shew­bread, which is called the sanctuary;

<span id="xxi.ix-p5"></span>**3** And after the second vail, the
tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies, which has the golden
censer, and the ark

<span id="xxi.ix-p6"></span>**4** Of the covenant covered around with
gold, in which is the golden pot which has manna, and Aaron’s rod which
had budded, and the tables of the covenant;

<span id="xxi.ix-p7"></span>**5** And over it the cherubim of glory
overshadowing the mercy­seat: of which it is not for us now to speak
particularly.

<span id="xxi.ix-p8"></span>**6** Now these things being thus set in
order, into the first tabernacle the priests always enter who perform
the service;

<span id="xxi.ix-p9"></span>**7** But into the second, the high priest
alone once a year, not without blood, which he offers for the ignorances
of himself and of the people;

<span id="xxi.ix-p10"></span>**8** The Holy Spirit intimating this, —
That the way to the holiest was not yet made manifest while the first
tabernacle was yet standing;

<span id="xxi.ix-p11"></span>**9** Which was a likeness for the time
present, in which gifts and sacrifices are offered, which cannot as to
conscience sanctify the worshipper,

<span id="xxi.ix-p12"></span>**10** Being imposed only with meats and
drinks, and divers washings and sanctifications of the flesh, until the
time of emendation.

<span id="xxi.ix-p13"></span>**11** But Christ, having afterwards come a
high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect
tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this creation,

<span id="xxi.ix-p14"></span>**12** Nor by the blood of goats and
calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the holy place, having
obtained eternal redemption.

<span id="xxi.ix-p15"></span>**13** For if the blood of bulls and of
goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkled on the unclean, sanctifies
to the purifying of the flesh;

<span id="xxi.ix-p16"></span>**14** How much more shall the blood of
Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself, *being* faultless, to
God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

<span id="xxi.ix-p17"></span>**15** And for this reason he is the
Mediator of a new testament, that by means of death for the redemption
of transgressions under the first testament, they who were called might
receive the promise of the eternal inheritance

<span id="xxi.ix-p18"></span>**16** For where a testament is, there must
necessarily be the death of the testator:

<span id="xxi.ix-p19"></span>**17** For a testament is of force as to
the dead, for it is never valid as long as the testator is living.

<span id="xxi.ix-p20"></span>**18** Hence the first was not dedicated
without blood:

<span id="xxi.ix-p21"></span>**19** For when every command according to
the law had been spoken by Moses to the whole people, taking the blood
of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he
sprinkled the book and all the people,

<span id="xxi.ix-p22"></span>**20** Saying, “This is the blood of the
testament which God hath commanded you.”

<span id="xxi.ix-p23"></span>**21** And he sprinkled also in a like
manner with blood the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry;

<span id="xxi.ix-p24"></span>**22** And nearly all things are cleansed
by blood according to the law: and without shedding of blood there is no
remission.

<span id="xxi.ix-p25"></span>**23** It is then necessary that the
exemplars of those things which are in heaven should be cleansed with
these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than
these.

<span id="xxi.ix-p26"></span>**24** For Christ has not entered into holy
places made with hands, the exemplars of the true, but into heaven
itself, that he may now appear before God for us;

<span id="xxi.ix-p27"></span>**25** Not indeed that he may often offer
himself, as the high priest *who* enters into the holiest every year
with another’s blood,

<span id="xxi.ix-p28"></span>**26** (for then he must have often
suffered since the creation of the world;) but now at the end of the
ages hath he once appeared for the destruction of sin by the sacrifice
of himself.

<span id="xxi.ix-p29"></span>**27** And as it is appointed to men once
to die, and after this the judgment;

<span id="xxi.ix-p30"></span>**28** So Christ, having been once offered,
that he might take away the sins of many, will appear the second time
without sin unto salvation, to those who wait for him.

<span id="xxi.x"></span>

<span id="xxi.x-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.x-p2"></span>CHAPTER 10

<span id="xxi.x-p3"></span>**1** For the law, having the shadow of good
things to come, not the very living image of things, can never by the
sacrifices which are offered continually every year, sanctify those who
come;

<span id="xxi.x-p4"></span>**2** Would they not have otherwise ceased to
be offered? because the worshippers, once cleansed, would have no more
conscience of sins

<span id="xxi.x-p5"></span>**3** But in these there is a remembrance of
sins every year;

<span id="xxi.x-p6"></span>**4** For it is impossible that the blood of
bulls and goats should take away sins.

<span id="xxi.x-p7"></span>**5** Therefore when coming into the world,
he saith, “Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast
thou prepared for me;

<span id="xxi.x-p8"></span>**6** Burnt­offerings and *sacrifices* for
sin thou hast not approved;

<span id="xxi.x-p9"></span>**7** Then said I, Lo, I am coming (in the
volume of the book it is written of me) that I may do, O God, thy will.”

<span id="xxi.x-p10"></span>**8** After having said above, “Sacrifice
and offering, burnt­offering and *sacrifices* for sin thou wouldest not,
nor hast thou approved,” which are offered according to the law;

<span id="xxi.x-p11"></span>**9** Then he said, “Lo, I am coming that I
may do, O God, thy will,” —he takes away the first, that he may
establish the second;

<span id="xxi.x-p12"></span>**10** By which will we are sanctified
through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once *made.*

<span id="xxi.x-p13"></span>**11** And every priest stands, indeed,
daily to minister and to offer often the same sacrifices which can never
take away sins;

<span id="xxi.x-p14"></span>**12** But he, having offered one sacrifice
for sins, sits down perpetually at the right hand of God,

<span id="xxi.x-p15"></span>**13** Henceforth waiting until his enemies
be made his footstool:

<span id="xxi.x-p16"></span>**14** For by one offering he hath
consecrated for ever those who are sanctified.

<span id="xxi.x-p17"></span>**15.** Now the Holy Spirit also bears
witness to us; for after having previously said,

<span id="xxi.x-p18"></span>**16** “This is the covenant which I will
make with them after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws in
their hearts, and in their minds will I write them,” \[he adds,\]

<span id="xxi.x-p19"></span>**17** “And their sins and their iniquities
will I remember no more.”

<span id="xxi.x-p20"></span>**18** Now, where there is remission of
these, there is no more offering for sin.

<span id="xxi.x-p21"></span>**19** Having then, brethren, confidence to
enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,

<span id="xxi.x-p22"></span>**20** By a new and living way which he hath
consecrated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh,

<span id="xxi.x-p23"></span>**21** And having a great priest over the
house of God,

<span id="xxi.x-p24"></span>**22** Let us draw near with a sincere
heart, in a full assurance of faith, sprinkled in our hearts from an
evil conscience, and washed in our body with pure water;

<span id="xxi.x-p25"></span>**23** Let us hold the confession of our
hope with out wavering, for faithful is he who has promised;

<span id="xxi.x-p26"></span>**24** And let us consider one another for
the purpose of emulation in love and in good works;

<span id="xxi.x-p27"></span>**25** Nor let us neglect the assembling of
ourselves together, as the custom with some is; but let us exhort *one*
another, and so much the more as ye see the day approaching.

<span id="xxi.x-p28"></span>**26** For to those who willingly sin, after
having received the knowledge of the truth, there is no more left a
sacrifice for sins,

<span id="xxi.x-p29"></span>**27** But a dreadful expectation of
judgment, and a fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries.

<span id="xxi.x-p30"></span>**28** He who cast aside the law of Moses
died without mercy under two or three witnesses: of how much heavier
punishment,

<span id="xxi.x-p31"></span>**29** Think ye, shall he be deemed worthy,
who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted unholy the blood
of the testament by which he has been sanctified, and has treated
scornfully the Spirit of grace?

<span id="xxi.x-p32"></span>**30** For we know who says, “Mine is
vengeance, I will repay,” saith the Lord; and again, “The Lord will
judge his people.”

<span id="xxi.x-p33"></span>**31** It is a dreadful thing to fall into
the hands of the living God.

<span id="xxi.x-p34"></span>**32** But remember the former days, in
which, after being illuminated, ye endured a great conflict of
sufferings; partly when ye were exposed to public shame by reproaches
and distresses,

<span id="xxi.x-p35"></span>**33** And partly when ye became the
companions of those who were thus treated:

<span id="xxi.x-p36"></span>**34** For ye sympathized with me in my
bonds, and took the plunder of your goods with joy, knowing that ye have
a better and an enduring substance in heaven.

<span id="xxi.x-p37"></span>**35** Cast not then away your confidence
which has a great recompense of reward.

<span id="xxi.x-p38"></span>**36** Ye have truly need of patience, so
that having done the will of God, ye may obtain the promise:

<span id="xxi.x-p39"></span>**37** For it will yet be a little while,
when he who is coming will come, and will not delay.

<span id="xxi.x-p40"></span>**38** But the just, by faith shall he live;
and if he draws back, my soul shall have no delight in him.

<span id="xxi.x-p41"></span>**39** But we are not of those who draw back
to perdition, but of those who believe to the salvation of the soul.

<span id="xxi.xi"></span>

<span id="xxi.xi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.xi-p2"></span>CHAPTER 11

<span id="xxi.xi-p3"></span>**1** Now faith is the substance of things
hoped for, the demonstration of things not seen:

<span id="xxi.xi-p4"></span>**2** For by it the elders obtained a
testimony.

<span id="xxi.xi-p5"></span>**3** By faith we understand that the worlds
were set in order by the Word of God, so that of things not visible they
became visible.

<span id="xxi.xi-p6"></span>**4** By faith Abel offered to God a more
excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained a testimony that he
was righteous, God bearing a testimony to his gifts; and by it, he being
dead, yet speaketh.

<span id="xxi.xi-p7"></span>**5** By faith Enoch was translated, so as
not to see death; nor was he found, because God had translated him; for
before his translation he had received a testimony that he pleased God.

<span id="xxi.xi-p8"></span>**6** But without faith it is impossible to
please him; for he who comes to God must believe that he is, and that he
is the rewarder of those who seek him.

<span id="xxi.xi-p9"></span>**7** By faith Noah, having been warned by
God of things which did not as yet appear, being moved with fear,
prepared an ark for the preservation of his house; by which he condemned
the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.

<span id="xxi.xi-p10"></span>**8** By faith Abraham, when he was called,
obeyed, so that he went out into the place which he was to receive for
an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.

<span id="xxi.xi-p11"></span>**9** By faith he sojourned in the promised
land, as though it was a foreign country, dwelling in tents together
with Isaac and Jacob, co­heirs to the same promise;

<span id="xxi.xi-p12"></span>**10** For he expected a city having
foundations, whose master­builder and maker is God.

<span id="xxi.xi-p13"></span>**11** By faith also Sarah herself received
power to conceive seed; and beyond the time of age she brought forth,
because she counted him faithful who had promised.

<span id="xxi.xi-p14"></span>**12** Therefore there have been begotten
even of one, and him indeed dead, *those* in multitude as the stars of
heaven, and as the numberless sand which is on the sea­shore.

<span id="xxi.xi-p15"></span>**13** All these died in faith, not having
received the promises, but having afar off seen, and believed, and
embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on
the earth:

<span id="xxi.xi-p16"></span>**14** Verily they who say such things shew
that they seek a country.

<span id="xxi.xi-p17"></span>**15** And if indeed they had remembered
that from which they had come out, they had time to return:

<span id="xxi.xi-p18"></span>**16** But they now desire a better, even
that which is heavenly: hence God is not ashamed to be called their God,
for he has prepared for them a city.

<span id="xxi.xi-p19"></span>**17** By faith Abraham offered up Isaac,
when he was tried; and he offered up the only­begotten after having
received the promises,

<span id="xxi.xi-p20"></span>**18** Respecting whom it had been said,
“In Isaac shall thy seed be called;”

<span id="xxi.xi-p21"></span>**19** Accounting that God was able to
raise him even from the dead; whence also he received him in a type.

<span id="xxi.xi-p22"></span>**20** By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and
Esau concerning things to come. By faith Jacob, when dying,

<span id="xxi.xi-p23"></span>**21** Blessed both the sons of Joseph, and
worshipped on the head of his couch.

<span id="xxi.xi-p24"></span>**22** By faith Joseph, when dying, made
mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave an order
respecting his bones.

<span id="xxi.xi-p25"></span>**23** By faith Moses, when born, was hid
three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful
child, and feared not the decree of the king.

<span id="xxi.xi-p26"></span>**24** By faith Moses, when grown up,
refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,

<span id="xxi.xi-p27"></span>**25** Choosing rather to suffer evils with
the people of God than to have the temporary pleasures of sin;

<span id="xxi.xi-p28"></span>**26** Esteeming the reproach of Christ
greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked on the
recompense of reward.

<span id="xxi.xi-p29"></span>**27** By faith he left Egypt, having not
feared the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is
invisible.

<span id="xxi.xi-p30"></span>**28** By faith he appointed the passover,
and the sprinkling of blood, that he who destroyed the first­born should
not touch them.

<span id="xxi.xi-p31"></span>**29** By faith they passed through the Red
Sea as through a dry land; which when the Egyptians attempted, they were
drowned.

<span id="xxi.xi-p32"></span>**30** By faith the walls of Jericho fell,
having been surrounded seven days.

<span id="xxi.xi-p33"></span>**31** By faith Rahab the harlot perished
not with the unbelieving, after having received the explorers in peace.

<span id="xxi.xi-p34"></span>**32** And what more shall I say? for the
time would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak, of Samson and Jephthae;
of David, and of Samuel, and the Prophets;

<span id="xxi.xi-p35"></span>**33** Who by faith subdued kingdoms,
wrought righteousness, obtained promises, closed the mouths of lions,

<span id="xxi.xi-p36"></span>**34** Quenched the violence of fire,
escaped the edge of the sword, became strong in weakness, were made
valiant in battle, put to flight the armies of aliens:

<span id="xxi.xi-p37"></span>**35** Women, by a resurrection, received
their dead; and some were tortured, not having received deliverance,
that they might obtain a better resurrection;

<span id="xxi.xi-p38"></span>**36** And others experienced mockings and
scourgings, and further, bonds and imprisonment:

<span id="xxi.xi-p39"></span>**37** They were stoned, sawn asunder,
tempted, slain with the sword: they wandered in sheep­skins and
goat­skins, being destitute, oppressed, ill­treated,

<span id="xxi.xi-p40"></span>**38** (of whom the world was not worthy;)
wandering in deserts, and on mountains, and in dens and caves of the
earth.

<span id="xxi.xi-p41"></span>**39** And all these, having received a
testimony by faith, did not obtain the promise:

<span id="xxi.xi-p42"></span>**40** God having provided some better
thing for us, that they might not without us be made perfect.

<span id="xxi.xii"></span>

<span id="xxi.xii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.xii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 12

<span id="xxi.xii-p3"></span>**1** Therefore, as we are surrounded by
such a cloud of witnesses, laying aside every weight, and the sin which
besets us, let us also run with patience in the race set before us,

<span id="xxi.xii-p4"></span>**2** Looking to Jesus, the author and
finisher of our faith; who, for the joy set before him, endured the
cross, having despised shame, and sat down on the right hand of the
throne of God:

<span id="xxi.xii-p5"></span>**3** For consider who he was who endured
from sinners such contradiction against himself,

<span id="xxi.xii-p6"></span>**4** That ye may not be wearied, being
faint in your souls; ye have not as yet resisted unto blood, while
striving against sin.

<span id="xxi.xii-p7"></span>**5** And ye have forgotten the exhortation
which speaks to you as to children, “My son, despise not the chastening
of the Lord, nor be faint when thou art reproved by him:

<span id="xxi.xii-p8"></span>**6** For whom the Lord loveth he
chasteneth; and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.”

<span id="xxi.xii-p9"></span>**7** If ye endure chastening, God dealeth
with you as with sons: for what son is he whom the father chasteneth
not?

<span id="xxi.xii-p10"></span>**8** But if ye be without chastisement,
of which all \[sons\] are partakers, then ye are bastards, and not sons.

<span id="xxi.xii-p11"></span>**9** Since we had the fathers of our
flesh as our chastisers, and we reverenced them, shall we not much more
be subject to the Father of spirits, and live?

<span id="xxi.xii-p12"></span>**10** For they indeed for a few days
chastised us according to their own will: but he for our benefit, that
he may impart to us his holiness.

<span id="xxi.xii-p13"></span>**11** But no chastening seems indeed for
the present to be joyful, but grievous; yet afterwards it renders the
peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who are by it exercised.

<span id="xxi.xii-p14"></span>**12** Raise ye up, therefore, the remiss
hands, and the relaxed knees,

<span id="xxi.xii-p15"></span>**13** And make straight paths for your
feet, that halting may not lead you astray, but rather that it may be
healed.

<span id="xxi.xii-p16"></span>**14** Follow peace with all, and
holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord;

<span id="xxi.xii-p17"></span>**15** Taking heed, lest any one should
come short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness, growing up,
should disturb you, and many be through it defiled;

<span id="xxi.xii-p18"></span>**16** Lest there should be any fornicator
or a profane person, like Esau, who for one meal sold his birthright:

<span id="xxi.xii-p19"></span>**17** For ye know that when afterwards he
wished to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place
for repentance, though he sought it with tears.

<span id="xxi.xii-p20"></span>**18** For we have not come to the mount
that might be touched, and to the burning fire, and to blackness, and
darkness, and tempest,

<span id="xxi.xii-p21"></span>**19** And to the sound of a trumpet, and
the voice of words, which they having heard entreated that the word
should not be proclaimed to them;

<span id="xxi.xii-p22"></span>**20** For they could not bear what was
enjoined, “If a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned or pierced
through with a dart;”

<span id="xxi.xii-p23"></span>**21** And so terrible was the sight,
*that* Moses said, “I fear and tremble.”

<span id="xxi.xii-p24"></span>**22** But ye have come to Mount Sion, the
city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to the company of
innumerable angels,

<span id="xxi.xii-p25"></span>**23** And to the Church of the
first­born, who are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and
to the spirits of just men made perfect,

<span id="xxi.xii-p26"></span>**24** And to Jesus the Mediator of the
New Testament, and the blood of sprinkling, which speaks better things
than that of Abel.

<span id="xxi.xii-p27"></span>**25** See that ye despise not him that
speaketh; for if they escaped not who despised him who spoke on earth,
how much less we, if we turn away from him *who speaks* from heaven?

<span id="xxi.xii-p28"></span>**26** Whose voice then shook the earth;
but now he has promised, saying, “Yet once I shake, not only the earth,
but also heaven:”

<span id="xxi.xii-p29"></span>**27** And this, “Set once,” signifies the
removal of the things shaken, that the things unshaken might remain.

<span id="xxi.xii-p30"></span>**28** Hence we, who receive a kingdom
which is not shaken, have grace, by which we serve God acceptably with
reverence and fear:

<span id="xxi.xii-p31"></span>**29** “For our God is a consuming fire.”

<span id="xxi.xiii"></span>

<span id="xxi.xiii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxi.xiii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 13

<span id="xxi.xiii-p3"></span>**1** Let brotherly love continue.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p4"></span>**2** Be not unmindful of hospitality; for
by this some have unawares received angels.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p5"></span>**3** Remember those in bonds, as bound
with them, *and* the afflicted, as ye yourselves are in the body.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p6"></span>**4** Honorable is marriage in all, and
the unpolluted bed; but fornicators and adulterers God will condemn.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p7"></span>**5** *Let your* conduct *be* without
avarice; be content with what ye have; for he has said, “I will not
leave thee, nor forsake thee;”

<span id="xxi.xiii-p8"></span>**6** So that we may confidently say, “The
Lord is to me a helper, nor will I fear what man may do to me.”

<span id="xxi.xiii-p9"></span>**7** Remember those who are set over you,
who have spoken to you the Word of God; whose faith follow, considering
the end of their conduct.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p10"></span>**8** Jesus Christ, yesterday and today,
is even the same for ever;

<span id="xxi.xiii-p11"></span>**9** Be not carried about by various and
foreign doctrines; for it is good that the heart should be strengthened
by grace, not by meats, which have not profited those who have been
conversant in them.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p12"></span>**10** We have an altar, from which they
have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p13"></span>**11** For the beasts, whose blood for
sin is brought by the high priest into the holiest, their bodies are
burnt without the camp.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p14"></span>**12** Hence Jesus also, that he might
sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the camp.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p15"></span>**13** Let us then go forth to him
without the gate, bearing his reproach.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p16"></span>**14** For we have not here an abiding
city, but we seek one to come.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p17"></span>**15** By him, then, let us continually
offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips,
giving thanks to his name:

<span id="xxi.xiii-p18"></span>**16** But to do good, and to
communicate, forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p19"></span>**17** Obey those who are set over you,
and be submissive; for they watch for your souls, as those who are to
render an account; so that they may do this with joy, and not with
grief, for that would be unprofitable to you.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p20"></span>**18** Pray for us; for we trust that we
have a good conscience, desiring in all things to live honestly:

<span id="xxi.xiii-p21"></span>**19** But I beseech you the more to do
this, that I may the sooner be restored to you.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p22"></span>**20** Now may the God of peace, who
brought up from the dead the great pastor of the sheep in the blood of
the eternal covenant,

<span id="xxi.xiii-p23"></span>**21** Even our Lord Jesus, confirm you
in every good work, that ye may do his will, doing in you what is
acceptable before him through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever
and ever. Amen.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p24"></span>**22** But I beseech you, brethren, bear
the word of exhortation; for a few words have I written to you.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p25"></span>**23** Know ye that brother Timothy is
set at liberty; with whom, if he comes shortly, I shall see you.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p26"></span>**24** Salute all those who are set over
you, and all the saints; they from Italy salute you.

<span id="xxi.xiii-p27"></span>**25** Grace be with you all. Amen.
