<span id="ix-p1"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="ix.i"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 3:1-6

<span id="ix.i-p2"></span>**1.** Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of
the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our
profession, Christ Jesus;

<span id="ix.i-p3"></span>**1.** Unde fratres sancti vocationis
coelestis participes, considerate Apostolum et sacerdotem confessionis
nostrae, Christum Iesum;

<span id="ix.i-p4"></span>**2.** Who was faithful to him that appointed
him, as also Moses *was faithful* in all his house.

<span id="ix.i-p5"></span>**2.** Qui fidelis est ei qui constituit eum,
quemadmodum et Moses in Tota domo ejus.

<span id="ix.i-p6"></span>**3.** For this *man* was counted worthy of
more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath
more honor than the house.

<span id="ix.i-p7"></span>**3.** Majore quippe gloria hic dignus habitus
est quam Moses, quanto majorem habet honorem architectus domus quam
ipsa.

<span id="ix.i-p8"></span>**4.** For every house is builded by some
*man*; but he that built all things *is* God.

<span id="ix.i-p9"></span>**4.** Omnis enim domus construitur ab aliquo,
qui autem omnia construxit Deus est.

<span id="ix.i-p10"></span>**5.** And Moses verily *was* faithful in all
his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to
be spoken after;

<span id="ix.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et Moses quidem fidelis in tota domo
ejus tanquam minister in testimonium eorum quae post dicenda erant;

<span id="ix.i-p12"></span>**6.** But Christ as a son over his own
house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the
rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.

<span id="ix.i-p13"></span>**6.** Christus autem tanquam filius supra
domum ipsius; cujus nos domus sumus, si fiduciam et gloriationem spei ad
finem usque firmam tenuerimus.

<span id="ix.i-p14"></span> 

<span id="ix.i-p15"></span><span id="ix.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p16"></span>**1.** *Wherefore, holy brethren,* *etc.* He
concludes the preceding doctrine with a necessary exhortation, that the
Jews should attentively consider what sort of being and how great Christ
is. As he had before, by naming him a teacher and a priest, briefly
compared him with Moses and Aaron, so he now includes both clauses; for
he adorns him with two titles, as he sustains a twofold character in the
Church of God. Moses was a prophet and a teacher, and Aaron was a
priest; but the two offices belong to Christ. If then we seek rightly to
know him, we must inquire what sort of being he is; yea, he must be
clothed with his own power, lest we lay hold on an empty shadow and not
on him.  <span id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md)

<span id="ix.i-p18"></span>First, the word *consider,* is important, for
it intimates that singular attention is required, as he cannot be
disregarded with impunity, and that at the same time the true knowledge
of Christ is sufficient to dissipate the darkness of all errors. And to
encourage them the more to pursue this study, he reminds them of their
*calling*; as though he had said, “God favored you with no common grace
when He called you into his kingdom;  <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) it now remains that you have your eyes
fixed on Christ as your leader in the way.”  <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) For the calling of the godly cannot be
otherwise confirmed than by a thorough surrender of themselves to
Christ. We ought not therefore to regard this as said only to the Jews,
but that it is a general truth addressed to all who desire to come into
the kingdom of God; they ought sedulously to attend to Christ, for he is
the sole instructor of our faith, and has confirmed it by the sacrifice
of himself; for *confession,* or profession, is to be taken here for
faith, as thought he had said, that the faith we profess is vain and of
no avail, unless Christ be its object.  <span
id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md)

<span id="ix.i-p23"></span><span id="ix.i-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p24"></span>**2.** *Who was,* or *is* *faithful,* *etc.*
This is a commendation of the apostleship of Christ, in order that the
faithful may securely acquiesce in him; and he commends it on two
grounds, because the Father has set him to be over us as our teacher,
and because Christ himself has faithfully performed the office committed
to him. These two things are always necessary to secure authority to a
doctrine; for God alone ought to be attended to, as the whole Scripture
testifies; hence Christ declares, that the doctrine which he delivered
was not his own, but the Father’s, (<span id="ix.i-p24.1"></span>[Joh
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#016)<span id="ix.i-p24.1"></span>;.md)
and in another place he says, “He who received me, receiveth him who has
sent me.” (<span id="ix.i-p24.2"></span>[Lu
9:48](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#048)<span id="ix.i-p24.2"></span>..md)
For we say of Christ, that as he is clothed with our flesh, he is the
Father’s minister to execute his commands. To the calling of God is
added the faithful and upright performance of duty on the part of
Christ; and this is required in true ministers, in order that they may
obtain credence in the Church. Since these two things are found in
Christ, doubtless he cannot be disregarded without despising God in him.

<span id="ix.i-p25"></span>*As also Moses,* *etc.* Omitting for a while
the priesthood, he speaks here of his apostleship. For as there are two
parts in God’s covenant, the promulgation of the truth, and so to speak,
its real confirmation, the full perfection of the covenant would not
appear in Christ, were not both parts found in him. Hence the writer of
the epistle, after having mentioned both, roused attention by a brief
exhortation. But he now enters on a longer discussion, and begins with
the office of a teacher: he therefore now compares Christ only with
Moses. The words, *in all his house,* may be applied to Moses; but I
prefer to apply them to Christ, as he may be said to be faithful to his
Father in ruling his whole house. It hence follows, that none belong to
the Church of God except those who acknowledge Christ.  <span
id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md)

<span id="ix.i-p28"></span><span id="ix.i-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p29"></span>**3.** *For this man* (or, *he*) *was counted
worthy,* *etc.* Lest he might appear to make Moses equal to Christ, he
reminds us of his superior excellency; and this he proves by two
arguments, ­Moses so ruled the Church, that he was still a part and
member of it; but Christ being the builder, is superior to the whole
building, — Moses while ruling others, was ruled also himself, as he was
a servant; but Christ being a Son possesses supreme power.

<span id="ix.i-p30"></span>It is a frequent and well­known metaphor used
in Scripture to call the Church the house of God. (<span
id="ix.i-p30.1"></span>[1Ti 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015.md)<span
id="ix.i-p30.1"></span>.) And as it is composed of the faithful, each of
them is called a living stone. (<span id="ix.i-p30.2"></span>[1Pe
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005)<span id="ix.i-p30.2"></span>..md)
They are also sometimes called the vessels with which the house is
furnished. (<span id="ix.i-p30.3"></span>[2Ti
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#020)<span id="ix.i-p30.3"></span>..md)
There is then no one so eminent that he is not a member, and included in
the universal body. God being the builder, alone is to be set above his
own work; but God dwells in Christ, so that whatever is said of God is
applicable to him.

<span id="ix.i-p31"></span>If any one objects and says that Christ is
also a part of the building because he is the foundation, because he is
our brother, because he has a union with us and then that he is not the
master­builder because he himself was formed by God: in reply to these
things we say that our faith is so founded on him that he still rules
over us that he is in such a way our brother that he is yet our Lord,
that he was so formed by God as man that he nevertheless by his Spirit
revives and restores all things as the eternal God. The Scripture
employs us various metaphors to set forth Christ s grace towards us; but
there is no one which derogates from his honor mentioned here by the
Apostle; for what is stated here is that all ought to be brought down to
their own state because they ought to be in subjection to the head and
that Christ alone is exempt from this submission, because he is the
head.

<span id="ix.i-p32"></span>If it be again objected and said that Moses
was no less a master­builder than Paul who gloried in this title: to
this I reply that this name is applied to prophets and teachers but not
with strict correctness; for they are only the instruments and indeed
dead instruments, except the Lord from heaven gives efficacy to what
they do; and then they so labor in building the Church, that they
themselves form a part of the structure; but the case is wholly
different as to Christ, for he ever builds up the Church by the power of
his own Spirit. Besides, he stands far above the rest, for he is in such
a way the true temple of God, that he is at the same time the God who
inhabits it.

<span id="ix.i-p33"></span><span id="ix.i-p33.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p34"></span>**4.** *He that built,* *etc.* Though these
words may be extended to the creation of the whole world, yet I confine
them to the present subject. We are then to understand that nothing is
done in the Church which ought not to he ascribed to Gods power; for he
alone has founded it by his own hand, (<span id="ix.i-p34.1"></span>[Ps
87:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005)<span id="ix.i-p34.1"></span>;.md)
and Paul says of Christ that he is the head, from whom the whole body,
joined together and connected by every subservient juncture, makes an
increase according to what is done proportionally by every member.
(<span id="ix.i-p34.2"></span>[Eph
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#016)<span id="ix.i-p34.2"></span>..md)
Hence he often declares that the success of his ministry was God’s work.
In a word, if we take a right view of things, it will appear that how
much soever God may use the labors of men in building his Church, yet he
himself performs everything — the instrument derogates nothing from the
workman.  <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md)

<span id="ix.i-p36"></span><span id="ix.i-p36.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p37"></span>**5.** *And Moses verily was faithful in all
his house, as a servant,* *etc.* The second difference is, that to Moses
was committed a doctrine to which he, in common with others, was to
submit; but Christ, though he put on the form of a servant, is yet
Master and Lord, to whom all ought to be subject; for, as we found in
<span id="ix.i-p37.1"></span>[Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md)<span id="ix.i-p37.1"></span>, he
is constituted heir of all things.

<span id="ix.i-p38"></span>*For a testimony of those things which were
to be spoken after,* or *which were afterwards to be said* or
*declared*. I explain this simply in this way, — that Moses, while a
herald of that doctrine which was to be published for a time to the
ancient people, did at the same time render a testimony to the Gospel,
the publication of which was not as yet to be made; for it is doubtless
evident, that the end and completion of the Law is that perfection of
wisdom contained in the Gospel. This exposition seems to comport with
the future tense of the participle. The meaning indeed is, that Moses
faithfully delivered to the people what the Lord had committed to him,
but that limits were prescribed to him which it was not lawful for him
to pass. God formerly spoke at different times and in various ways by
the prophets, but he deferred to the fullness of time the complete
revelation of the Gospel.

<span id="ix.i-p39"></span><span id="ix.i-p39.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p40"></span>**6.** *Whose house are we,* *etc.* As Paul
in his Epistle to the Romans, after having prefaced that he was
appointed to be the Apostle of the Gentiles, adds, for the sake of
gaining credit among them, that they were of that number; so now the
author of this epistle exhorts the Jews who had already made a
profession of Christ to persevere in the faith, that they might be
deemed as being in Gods household. He had said before that God’s house
was subject to the authority of Christ. Suitably to this declaration is
added the admonition that they would then have a place in God’s family
when they obeyed Christ. But as they had already embraced the gospel, he
mentions their condition if they persevered in the faith. For the word
*hope* I take for faith; and indeed hope is nothing else but the
constancy of faith. He mentions *confidence* and *rejoicing,* or
glorying, in order to express more fully the power of faith.  <span
id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) And we hence conclude that those who
assent to the Gospel doubtfully and like those who vacillate, do not
truly and really believe; for faith cannot be without a settled peace of
mind, from which proceeds the bold confidence of rejoicing. And so these
two things, confidence and rejoicing, are ever the effects of faith, as
we stated in explaining Romans the 5th chapter, and Ephesians the 3rd
chapter

<span id="ix.i-p44"></span>But to these things the whole teaching of the
Papists is opposed; and this very fact, were there nothing else,
sufficiently proves that they pull down the Church of God rather than
build it. For the certainty by which alone we are made, as the Apostle
teaches us, holy temples to God, they not only darken by their glosses,
but also condemn as presumption. Besides, what firmness of confidence
can there be when men know not what they ought to believe? And yet that
monstrous thing, implicit faith, which they have invented, is nothing
else than a license to entertain errors. This passage reminds us that we
are always to make progress even unto death; for our whole life is as it
were a race.

<span id="ix.ii"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 3:7-13

<span id="ix.ii-p2"></span>**7.** Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To
day if ye will hear his voice,

<span id="ix.ii-p3"></span>**7.** Quare (sicut dicit Spiritus Sanctus,
Hodie si vocem ejus audieritis,

<span id="ix.ii-p4"></span>**8.** Harden not your hearts, as in the
provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:

<span id="ix.ii-p5"></span>**8.** Ne obduretis corda vestra, sicut in
exacerbatione, in die tentationis in deserto;

<span id="ix.ii-p6"></span>**9.** When your fathers tempted me, proved
me, and saw my works forty years.

<span id="ix.ii-p7"></span>**9.** Ubi tentaverunt me patres vestri,
probaverunt me, et viderunt opera mea

<span id="ix.ii-p8"></span>**10.** Wherefore I was grieved with that
generation, and said, They do always err in *their* heart; and they have
not known my ways.

<span id="ix.ii-p9"></span>**10.** Quadraginta annis: quamobrem infensus
fui generationi illi, et dixi, semper errant corde; ipsi vero non
cognoverunt vias meas;

<span id="ix.ii-p10"></span>**11.** So I sware in my wrath, They shall
not enter into my rest.)

<span id="ix.ii-p11"></span>**11.** Sicut juravi in ira mea, Si
ingressuri sint in requiem meam.)

<span id="ix.ii-p12"></span>**12.** Take heed, brethren, lest there be
in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living
God.

<span id="ix.ii-p13"></span>**12.** Videte fratres, ne quando sit in
ullo vestrum cor pravum incredulitatis (*vel, pravum et incredulum,*)
deficiendo a Deo vivente:

<span id="ix.ii-p14"></span>**13.** But exhort one another daily, while
it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the
deceitfulness of sin.

<span id="ix.ii-p15"></span>**13.** Sed exhortamini vos ipsos quotidie,
quandiu vocatur dies hodiernus; nequis ex vobis induretur deceptione
peccati.

<span id="ix.ii-p16"></span> 

<span id="ix.ii-p17"></span><span id="ix.ii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p18"></span>He proceeds in his exhortation, that they
were to obey Christ speaking to them; and that he might add more weight
to it, he confirms it by the testimony of David; for since they were to
be sharply goaded, it was better, for the sake of avoiding offense, to
bring forward another person. Had he simply reproached them for the
unbelief of the fathers, they would have less favorably attended to him;
but when he brought forward David, it was less offensive. Now, the
import of the whole is, — As God from the beginning would his voice
obeyed, and could not endure perverseness without punishing it severely,
so at this day he will not lightly punish our stubbornness, unless we
become teachable. But the discourse is suspended until we come to the
words, “Take heed, brethren, lest there be at any time in any of you,”
*etc.* That the passage, then, may flow better, it would be proper to
include the rest in a parenthesis.  <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md)
Let us now consider the words in order.

<span id="ix.ii-p20"></span>**7.** *As the Holy Ghost saith,* *etc.*
This availed much more to touch their hearts than if he had quoted David
by name. And it is useful for us to familiarize ourselves with such
expressions, so that we may remember that the words adduced from the
books of the prophets are those of God and not of men.

<span id="ix.ii-p21"></span>But as this sentence*, Today, if ye will
hear his voice,* is a part of a former verse, some have not unsuitably
rendered it thus, “Would to God you would this day hear his voice.” It
is indeed certain that when David called the Jews God’s people, he
immediately drew this conclusion, that the voice of God ought to have
been heard by them; for as to those whom he there invited to sing
praises to God and to celebrate his goodness, he reminded them at the
same time that obedience was the chief worship which he required, and
that it was better than all sacrifices. The chief thing, then, was to
obey the word of God.

<span id="ix.ii-p22"></span><span id="ix.ii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p23"></span>**8.** Then follows<span
id="ix.ii-p23.1"></span>, *Harden not your hearts* By which words is
intimated that our rebellion against God flows from no other fountain
than willful wickedness, by which we obstruct the entrance of his grace,
We have indeed by nature a heart of stone, and there is in all an innate
hardness from the womb, which God alone can mollify and amend. That we,
however, reject the voice of God, it happens through a spontaneous
obstinacy, not through an external impulse, a fact of which every one is
a witness to himself. Rightly, then, does the Spirit accuse all the
unbelieving that they resist God, and that they are the teachers and
authors of their own perverseness, so that they can throw the blame on
none else. It is hence, however, absurdly concluded that we have, on the
other hand, a free power to form the heart for God’s service; nay
rather, it must ever be the case with men, that they harden their heart
until another be given them from heaven; for as we are bent towards
wickedness, we shall never cease to resist God until we shall be tamed
and subdued by his hand.

<span id="ix.ii-p24"></span>*As in the provocation,* *etc.* It was for
two reasons necessary for them to be reminded of the disobedience of
their fathers; for as they were foolishly inflated on account of the
glory of their race, they often imitated the vices of their fathers as
though they were virtues, and defended themselves by their examples; and
further, when they heard that their fathers were so disobedient to God,
they were thus more fully taught that this admonition was not
superfluous. As both these reasons existed even in the Apostle’s time,
he readily accommodated to his own purpose what had been formerly said
by David, in order that those whom he addressed might not imitate their
fathers too much.

<span id="ix.ii-p25"></span>And hence may be learnt a general truth,
that we are not to defer too much to the authority of the fathers lest
it should draw us away from God; for if any fathers have ever been
worthy of honor, no doubt the Jews possessed that preeminence; and yet
David distinctly commanded their children to beware of being like them.

<span id="ix.ii-p26"></span>And I have no doubt but that he referred to
the history recorded in <span id="ix.ii-p26.1"></span>[Ex
17:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.ii-p26.1"></span>:
for David uses here the two names which Moses relates were given to a
certain place, <span id="ix.ii-p26.2"></span>מרבה Meribah, which means
strife or provocation, and <span id="ix.ii-p26.3"></span>מסה Massah,
which means temptation. They tempted God by denying that he was in the
midst of them, because they were distressed for want of water; and they
also provoked him by contending with Moses. Though indeed they gave many
examples of unbelief, yet David selected this in an especial manner,
because it was more memorable then any other, and also, because in order
of time it followed for the most part the rest, as it evidently appears
from the fourth book of Moses, where from chap. 10 to 20 a series of
many temptations is described; but this narrative is given in the
twentieth chapter. This circumstance increased not a little the atrocity
of their wickedness; for they had often experienced the power of God,
and yet they perversely contended with him, and renounced all confidence
in him: how great was their ingratitude! He then mentioned one
particular instance instead of many.

<span id="ix.ii-p27"></span><span id="ix.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p28"></span>**9.** *Tempted,* *etc.* This word is to be
taken in a bad sense; it means to provoke in a proud and insulting
manner, which we express in French by saying, <span
id="ix.ii-p28.1"></span>*defier comme en depitant* For though God had
often brought them help, yet they forgot all, and scornfully asked,
where was his power. *Proved,* *etc.* This clause is to be thus
explained, “When yet they had proved me and seen my works”. For it
enhanced the guilt of their impiety, that having been taught by so many
evidences of divine power, they had made so bad a progress. For it was a
marvelous supineness and stupidity to esteem God’s power as nothing,
which had been so fully proved.  <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md)

<span id="ix.ii-p30"></span>*Forty years.* These are connected by David
with what follows. But we know that the Apostles in quoting passages
attend more to the general meaning than to the words. And no doubt God
complained that the people had been vexatious to him for forty years,
because so many benefits had availed nothing for the purpose of teaching
them; for though God did good continually to them who were wholly
unworthy, they yet never ceased to rise up against him. Hence arose his
continual indignation, as though he had said “Not once or for a short
time have they provoked me, but by their incessant wickedness for forty
years.” *Generation* means race, or men of one age.

<span id="ix.ii-p31"></span><span id="ix.ii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p32"></span>**10.** *And I said,* *etc.* This was God’s
sentence, by which he declared that they were destitute of a sound mind,
and he adds the reason, *For they have not known my ways.* In short, he
regarded them as past hope, for they were without sense and reason. And
here he assumed the character of man, who at length after long trials
declares that he has discovered obstinate madness, for he says that they
always went astray, and no hope of repentance appeared.

<span id="ix.ii-p33"></span><span id="ix.ii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p34"></span>**11.** *So I sware,* *etc.* It was the
punishment of their madness, that they were deprived of the rest
promised them. Moreover, the Lord calls the land, where they might have
had their dwelling*, his rest.* For they had been sojourners in Egypt
and wanderers in the wilderness; but the land of Canaan was to be,
according to the promise, their perpetual inheritance; and it was in
reference to this promise that God called it *his* rest: for nowhere can
we have a settled dwelling, except where we are fixed by his hand. But
their right to a sure possession was founded on what God said to
Abraham,

<span id="ix.ii-p35"></span>“To thy seed will I give this land.” (<span
id="ix.ii-p35.1"></span>[Ge 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007.md)<span
id="ix.ii-p35.1"></span>.)

<span id="ix.ii-p36"></span>By God swearing, *If they shall enter,*
*etc.*, the atrocity of their evil conduct is made more evident and is
more forcibly set forth, for it is an evidence of wrath greatly
inflamed. “If they shall enter,” is in the form of an oath, in which
something is to be understood, as an imprecation, or some such thing,
when men speak; but when God speaks, it is the same as though he said,
“Let me not be deemed true,”, or, “Let me not be hereafter believed, if
such a thing shall not be so.” However, this defective mode of speaking
recommends fear and reverence to us, so that we may not rashly swear, as
many do, who are often in the habit of pouring forth dreadful curses.

<span id="ix.ii-p37"></span>But as to the present passage, we ought not
to think that they were then for the first time denied entrance into the
land by God’s oath, when they tempted him in Rephidim; for they had long
before been excluded, even from the time they had refused to march
forward at the report of the spies. God then does not here ascribe their
expulsion from the land to this instance of tempting him as to the first
cause; but he intimates that by no chastisement could they have been
restored to a sound mind, but that they continually added new offenses:
and thus he shows that they fully deserved to be thus severely punished,
for they never ceased to increase more and more his wrath by various
sins, as though he had said, “This is the generation to which I denied
the possession of the promised land, for during whole forty years
afterwards it betrayed its obstinate madness by innumerable sins.”

<span id="ix.ii-p38"></span><span id="ix.ii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p39"></span>**12.** *Take heed,* (or *See*,) *brethren,
lest there be at any time in any of you a wicked heart of unbelief,*
*etc.* I have preferred to retain literally what the Apostle states,
rather than to give a paraphrase as to the wicked or depraved *heart of
unbelief,* by which he intimates that unbelief would be connected with
depravity or wickedness, if after having received the knowledge of
Christ they departed from his faith. For he addressed them who had been
imbued with the elements of Christianity; hence he immediately added,
*By departing;* for the sin of defection is accompanied with perfidy.
 <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md)

<span id="ix.ii-p42"></span><span id="ix.ii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p43"></span>**13.** He also pointed out the remedy, so
that they might not fall into this wickedness, and that was, to *exhort
one another.* For as by nature we are inclined to evil, we have need of
various helps to retain us in the fear of God. Unless our faith be now
and then raised up, it will lie prostrate; unless it be warmed, it will
be frozen; unless it be roused, it will grow torpid. He would have us
then to stimulate one another by mutual exhortations, so that Satan may
not creep into our hearts, and by his fallacies draw us away from God.
And this is a way of speaking that ought to be especially observed; for
we fall not immediately by the first assault into this madness of
striving against God; but Satan by degrees accosts us artfully by
indirect means, until he holds us ensnared in his delusions. Then indeed
being blinded, we break forth into open rebellion.  <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md)

<span id="ix.ii-p45"></span>We must then meet this danger in due time,
and it is one that is nigh us all, for nothing is more possible than to
be deceived; and from this deception comes at length hardness of heart.
We hence see how necessary it is for us to be roused by the incessant
goads of exhortations. Nor does the Apostle give only a general precept,
that all should take heed to themselves, but he should have them also to
be solicitous for the salvation of every member, so that they should not
suffer any of those who had been once called to perish through their
neglect, and he who feels it his duty so to watch over the salvation of
the whole flock as to neglect no one sheep, performs in this case the
office of a good shepherd.

<span id="ix.ii-p46"></span>*While it is called today.* He now applies
what David said more particularly to his own subjects; for he reminds us
that the word *today,* mentioned in the Psalm, ought not to be confined
to the age of David, but that it comprehends every time in which God may
address us. As often, then, and as long as he opened his sacred mouth to
teach us, let this sentence come to our minds, “Today, if ye will hear
his voice”. In the same way Paul teaches us that when the Gospel is
preached to us, it is the accepted time in which God hears us, and the
Day of salvation in which he helps us. (<span
id="ix.ii-p46.1"></span>[2Co 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002.md)<span
id="ix.ii-p46.1"></span>.)

<span id="ix.ii-p47"></span>Now, of this opportunity we ought to avail
ourselves; for if through our sloth we suffer it to pass by, we shall
hereafter in vain deplore its loss. So Christ says,

<span id="ix.ii-p48"></span>“Walk while ye have the light; come shortly
shall the night.” (<span id="ix.ii-p48.1"></span>[Joh
12:35](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#035)<span id="ix.ii-p48.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.ii-p49"></span>The particle *while,* then, or as long as,
intimates that, The seasonable time will not continue always, if we be
too slothful to follow when the Lord calls us. God knocks at our door;
unless we open to him he will no doubt in his turn close against us the
gate of his kingdom. In a word, too late will be their groans who
despise the grace offered to them today. As, then, we know not whether
God will extend his calling to tomorrow, let us not delay. Today he
calls us; let us immediately respond to him, for there is no faith
except where there is such a readiness to obey.

<span id="ix.iii"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 3:14-19

<span id="ix.iii-p2"></span>**14.** For we are made partakers of Christ,
if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end;

<span id="ix.iii-p3"></span>**14.** Participes enim facti sumus Christi,
siquidem initium fiduciae (*vel, subsistentiae*) ad finem usque firmum
tenuerimus;

<span id="ix.iii-p4"></span>**15.** While it is said, To day if ye will
hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.

<span id="ix.iii-p5"></span>**15.** In hoc quod dicitur, Hodie si vocem
ejus audieritis, ne obduretis corda vestra sicut in exacerbatione.

<span id="ix.iii-p6"></span>**16.** For some, when they had heard, did
provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.

<span id="ix.iii-p7"></span>**16.** Quidam enim quum audissent,
exacerbarunt; at non omnes qui egressi fuerant ex AEgypto per Mosen.

<span id="ix.iii-p8"></span>**17.** But with whom was he grieved forty
years? *was it* not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in
the wilderness?

<span id="ix.iii-p9"></span>**17.** Quibus autem infensus fuit
quadraginta annis? an non iis qui peccaverant, quorum membra ceciderunt
in deserto?

<span id="ix.iii-p10"></span>**18.** And to whom sware he that they
should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?

<span id="ix.iii-p11"></span>**18.** Quibus autem juravit, non
ingressuros in requiem suam nisi incredulis (*aut, inobedientibus*)?

<span id="ix.iii-p12"></span>**19.** So we see that they could not enter
in because of unbelief.

<span id="ix.iii-p13"></span>**19.** Et videmus non potuisse ingredi
propter infidelitatem.

<span id="ix.iii-p14"></span> 

<span id="ix.iii-p15"></span><span id="ix.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p16"></span>**14.** *For we are made partakers,* *etc.*
He commends them for having begun well; but lest, under the pretext of
the grace which they had obtained, they should indulge themselves in
carnal security, he says that there was need of perseverance; for many
having only tasted the Gospel, do not think of any progress as though
they had reached the summit. Thus it is that they not only stop in the
middle of their race, yea, nigh the starting­posts, but turn another
way. Plausible indeed is this objection, “What can we wish more after
having found Christ?” But if he is possessed by faith, we must persevere
in it, so that he may be our perpetual possession. Christ then has given
himself to be enjoyed by us on this condition, that by the same faith by
which we have been admitted into a participation of him, we are to
preserve so great a blessing even to death.  <span
id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md)

<span id="ix.iii-p18"></span>Hence he says *beginning,* intimating that
their faith was only begun. As *hypostasis* sometimes means
*confidence,* it may be so taken here; yet the term *substance,* as some
have rendered it, I do not dislike, though I explain it in a way
somewhat different. They think that faith is thus called, because the
whole of what man may have without it is nothing but vanity; but I so
regard it, because we recumb on it alone, as there is no other support
on which we can rely. And suitable to this view is the word *steadfast*
or firm; for we shall be firmly fixed and beyond the danger of
vacillating, provided faith be our foundation. The sum of the whole then
is, that faith whose beginnings only appear in us, is to make constant
and steady progress to the end.  <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md)

<span id="ix.iii-p20"></span><span id="ix.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p21"></span>**15.** *While it is said,* *etc.* He
intimates that the reason for making progress never ceases as long as we
live, because God calls us daily. For since faith responds to the
preaching of the Gospel, as preaching continues through the whole course
of our life, so we ought to continue growing in faith. The phrase, then,
*while it is said,* is the same as though he had said, “Since God never
makes an end of speaking, it is not enough for us readily to receive his
doctrine, except we exhibit the same teachableness and obedience
tomorrow and every following day.”  <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md)

<span id="ix.iii-p25"></span><span id="ix.iii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p26"></span>**16** *For some, when they had heard,*
*etc.* David spoke of the fathers as though that whole generation were
unbelieving; but it appears that some who truly feared God mingled with
the wicked. The apostle mentions this to modify what had been more
severely said by David, in order that we may know that the word is
preached to all for this end, that all may obey it with one consent, and
that the whole people were justly condemned for unbelief, when the body
was torn and mutilated by the defection of the greatest part.

<span id="ix.iii-p27"></span>But by saying that some *provoked,* while
yet they were by far the greatest part, this object was not only to
avoid giving offense, but also to encourage the Jews to imitate those
who believed; as though he had said, “As God forbids you to follow the
unbelief of the fathers, so he sets before you other fathers whose faith
is to be your example”. Thus is mitigated what otherwise might have
appeared too hard; that is, had they been commanded wholly to dissent
from their fathers. *To come out by Moses,* means by the hand of Moses,
for he was the minister of their deliverance. But there is an implied
comparison between the benefit which God had bestowed on them by Moses,
and the participation of Christ previously mentioned.

<span id="ix.iii-p28"></span><span id="ix.iii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p29"></span>**17.** *But with whom was he grieved,* or
*angry, etc.* He means that God had never been angry with his people
except for just causes, as Paul also reminds us in <span
id="ix.iii-p29.1"></span>[1 Cor. 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#006.md)<span id="ix.iii-p29.1"></span>.
Therefore as many chastisements of God as we read were inflicted on the
ancient people, so many grievous sins shall we find which provoked God’s
vengeance. At the same time we must come to this conclusion, that
unbelief was the chief of all their evils; for though he mentions this
the last, he yet means that it was the primary cause of their curse; and
no doubt from the time they once became unbelievers, they never ceased
to add one sin to another, and thus they brought on themselves new
scourges continually. Hence those very persons who through unbelief
rejected the possession of the land offered to them, pursued their own
obstinacy, now lusting, then murmuring, now committing adultery, then
polluting themselves with heathen superstitions, so that their depravity
became more fully manifested.

<span id="ix.iii-p30"></span>The unbelief, then, which they showed from
the beginning, prevented them from enjoying the kindness of God; for the
contempt of his word ever led them to sin. And as at first they deserved
through their unbelief that God should deprive them of the promised
rest, so whatever sin they committed afterwards flowed from the same
fountain.

<span id="ix.iii-p31"></span>It may be further asked, whether Moses, and
Aaron, and those like them, were included in this number? To this I
answer, that the Apostle speaks of the whole community rather than of
individuals. It is certain that there were many godly men who were
either not entangled in the general impiety or soon repented. Moses’
faith was once shaken and only once, and that for a moment. The
Apostle’s words, therefore, contain a statement of the whole instead of
a part, a mode of speaking frequently employed when a multitude or body
of people are spoken of.

id="ix.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p17"></span> He calls them “holy brethren.” Stuart takes
holy as meaning “consecrated, devoted, i.e. to Christ, set apart as
Christians.” The people of Israel were called holy in the same sense,
not because they were spiritually holy, but because they were set apart
and adopted as God’s people. The word saints, at the commencement of
Paul’s Epistles, means the same thing. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_53"></span>[54](cc44008.htm#fr_53.md) <span
id="ix.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p19"></span> The word heavenly, may also mean a call from
heaven. See <span id="ix.i-p19.1"></span>[Heb
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#025.md)<span id="ix.i-p19.1"></span>. It
is no doubt both, it is a call to the enjoyment of heavenly things, as
well as a call that comes from heaven. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_54"></span>[55](cc44008.htm#fr_54.md) <span
id="ix.i-p19.2"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p20"></span> This is the only place in which Christ is
called an Apostle, the design no doubt was to institute a comparison
between him and Moses, who is often said to have been sent by God, as
Christ is said to have been sent by the Father: they might both
therefore be rightly called Apostles, i.e., messengers sent by God. And
then he adds, high priest, that he might afterwards make a comparison
between him and Aaron.

<span id="ix.i-p21"></span>He had before exalted Christ as a teacher
above all the prophets, including no doubt Moses among the rest; but
here refers to Moses as the leader of the people, as one sent especially
by God to conduct them from Egypt through the wilderness to the land of
Canaan. But as our call is from heaven and to heaven, Christ is sent as
a messenger to lead us to the heavenly country. We hence see that in
this connection the “heavenly calling” is to be taken most suitably as a
call to heaven. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_55"></span>[56](cc44008.htm#fr_55.md) <span
id="ix.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p22"></span> The simpler meaning of this phrase is to
view it as sort of Hebraism, when a noun is put for an adjective or a
participle; and it is so rendered by Schleusner and Stuart, “professed
by us,” or, “whom we profess.” See similar instances in chapter <span
id="ix.i-p22.1"></span>[Heb 10:23](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#023.md)<span
id="ix.i-p22.1"></span>, and in <span id="ix.i-p22.2"></span>[2Co
9:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#013.md)<span id="ix.i-p22.2"></span>. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_56"></span>[57](cc44008.htm#fr_56.md) <span
id="ix.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p26"></span> This testimony as to Moses is found in <span
id="ix.i-p26.1"></span>[Nu 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#007.md)<span
id="ix.i-p26.1"></span>. God says there “in all mine house;” we ought
therefore to consider “his” here as referring to God or to Christ, and
not to Moses.

<span id="ix.i-p27"></span>“For this man,” οὖτος; it is better to render
it here he, as it is sometimes rendered, and is so rendered in this
place by Doddridge, Macknight and Stuart. The connection is with
“consider,” in the first verse; “for,” a reason is given for the
exhortation; “for he,” i.e., the apostle and high priest before
mentioned, etc. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_57"></span>[58](cc44008.htm#fr_57.md) <span
id="ix.i-p34.3"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p35"></span> See Appendix L

<span id="fn_58"></span>[59](cc44008.htm#fr_58.md) <span
id="ix.i-p40.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p41"></span> It is better for “hope” here to be retained
in its proper meaning; for in verse 12 the defect of it is traced to
unbelief. Were the words “confidence” and “rejoicing” rendered
adjectivally, the meaning would be more evident, — “If we hold firm our
confident and joyful hope to the end.” So we may render a similar form
of expression in verse 13, “through deceitful sin,” as “newness of life”
in <span id="ix.i-p41.2"></span>[Ro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md)<span id="ix.i-p41.2"></span>,
means “new life.” The most common practice is to render the genitive in
such instances as an adjective, but this is not always the case.

<span id="ix.i-p42"></span>Hope is “confident” or assured, while it
rests on the word of God, and is “joyful” while it anticipates the glory
and happiness of the heavenly kingdom.

<span id="ix.i-p43"></span>But Beza and Doddridge take words apart,
“freedom of profession and boasting of hope,” or according to Beza, “the
hope of which we boast.” Macknight renders them “the boldness and the
glorifying of the hope.” The secondary meaning of the word παρρησία is
confidence, and of καύχημα, joy or rejoicing, and the most suitable
here, as it comports better with holding fast, or firm. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_59"></span>[60](cc44008.htm#fr_59.md) <span
id="ix.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p19"></span> There is the same parenthesis in our
version; but Beza, Doddridge, Macknight, and Stuart, do not use it, but
connect “therefore” or wherefore with “harden not,” which seems more
suitable. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_60"></span>[61](cc44008.htm#fr_60.md) <span
id="ix.ii-p28.2"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p29"></span> See Appendix M.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[62](cc44008.htm#fr_61.md) <span
id="ix.ii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p40"></span> The word connected with “heart” is ἐν τῶ,
which properly means diseased and hence corrupted, depraved, wicked.
Depraved or wicked would perhaps be the best rendering of it here.
“Unbelief” is a genitive used for an adjective or a participle, — “a
wicked unbelieving heart.” It is unbelieving owing to its wickedness or
depravity. Grotius says, that there are two kinds of unbelief, — The
first the rejection of the truth when first offered, — and the second
the renouncing of it after having once professed it. The latter is the
more heinous sin.

<span id="ix.ii-p41"></span>“The departing,” etc.; ἐν τῶ is rendered
“by” by Macknight: it is considered by Grotius to be for εἰς τὸ, which
word makes the meaning more evident, “so as to depart,” etc. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_62"></span>[63](cc44008.htm#fr_62.md) <span
id="ix.ii-p43.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p44"></span> “Deceitfulness of sin” is rendered by
Stuart “sinful delusion.” It ought rather to be “deceitful (or
seductive) sin” as “deceitfulness of riches” in <span
id="ix.ii-p44.2"></span>[Mt 13:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#022.md)<span
id="ix.ii-p44.2"></span>, means “deceitful riches.” The “sin” was
evidently that of apostasy: and it was deceitful, because there was a
present prospect of relief from troubles and persecutions. The power of
any sin to deceive and seduce, consists in some present gratification or
interest. See note on verse 6. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_63"></span>[64](cc44008.htm#fr_63.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p17"></span> What is implied here is that we may
professedly be partakers of Christ: that is of his blessings as a
Savior, and yet be not really so: the proof of the reality is
perseverance. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_64"></span>[65](cc44008.htm#fr_64.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p19"></span> Here is another instance of the genitive
being the main subject, “the beginning of our confidence,” i.e., our
first confidence, which the Apostle calls “first faith” in <span
id="ix.iii-p19.1"></span>[1Ti
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#012.md)<span id="ix.iii-p19.1"></span>.
Macknight renders it “the begun confidence.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_65"></span>[66](cc44008.htm#fr_65.md) <span
id="ix.iii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p22"></span> Most connect this verse with the
preceding, as in our version, and as Doddridge thus “forasmuch as it is
said;” and Macknight thus “as ye may know by the saying.” So does Beza;
and Calvin seems to do the same; but some connect it with the 13th and
others with the 14th verse. Modern authors, such as Stuart and
Blooomfield, regard it as the commencement of a paragraph, and connect
it with what follows. Stuart’s version is —

<span id="ix.iii-p23"></span>15. With regard to the saying, “today while
ye hear his voice, harden  
16. Not your hearts as in the provocation;” who now were they that when
they heard did provoke? Nay, did not all who came out of Egypt under
Moses? Etc.

<span id="ix.iii-p24"></span>Bloomfield approves of this version, only
he considers the quotation is confined to the words, “Today, while ye
hear his voice,” and regards what follows, “harden not,” etc., as said
by the writer: See Appendix N. — *Ed.*
