<span id="xiii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 7

<span id="xiii.i"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p1"></span><span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>[Hebrews
7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#001.md)<span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p2"></span>**1.** For this Melchisedec, king of Salem,
priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the
slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;

<span id="xiii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Hic enim erat Melchisedec rex Salem,
pontifex Dei altissimi, qui occurrit Abrahae revertenti a caede regum,
et benedixit illi;

<span id="xiii.i-p4"></span>**2.** To whom also Abraham gave a tenth
part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and
after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;

<span id="xiii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Cui et decimas ex omnibus impartitus
est Abraham; qui primum quidem ex interpretatione dicitur Rex justitiae,
deinde etiam Rex Salem, quod est Rex pacis;

<span id="xiii.i-p6"></span>**3.** Without father, without mother,
without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but
made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.

<span id="xiii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Sine patre, sine matre, sine genere,
nec initium dierum, nec vitae finem habens; sed assimilatus Filio Dei
manet sacerdos in perpetuum.

<span id="xiii.i-p8"></span> 

<span id="xiii.i-p9"></span><span id="xiii.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p10"></span>**1.** *For this Melchisedec,* *etc.* He
has hitherto been stimulating the Jews by exhortations, that they might
attentively consider the comparison between Christ and Melchisedec. At
the end of the last chapter, that he might return from his digression to
his subject, he quoted again the passage from the Psalms; and now he
enters fully into what he had before slightly referred to; for he
enumerates particularly the things connected with Melchisedec, in which
he resembled Christ. It is indeed no wonder that he dwells so minutely
on this subject. It was doubtless no common thing that in a country
abounding in the corruptions of so many superstitions, a man was found
who preserved the pure worship of God; for on one side he was nigh to
Sodom and Gomorrah, and on the other to the Canaanites, so that he was
on every side encompassed by ungodly men. Besides, the whole world was
so fallen into impiety, that it is very probable that God was nowhere
faithfully worshipped except in the family of Abraham; for his father
and his grandfather, who ought to have retained true religion, had long
before degenerated into idolatry. It was therefore a memorable fact,
that there was still a king who not only retained true religion, but
also performed himself the office of a priest. And it was doubtless
necessary that in him who was to be a type of the Son of God all things
excellent should be found: and that Christ was shadowed forth by this
type is evident from the Psalm referred to; for David did not say
without reason, “Thou art a priest forever after the order Melchisedec;”
no, but on the contrary, by these words a sublime mystery was
recommended to the Church.

<span id="xiii.i-p11"></span>Let us now consider each of those
particulars in which the Apostle makes Christ like Melchisedec.  <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)

<span id="xiii.i-p15"></span>The first likeness is in the name; for it
was not without a mystery that he was called *the King of
righteousness*. For though this honor is ascribed to kings who rule with
moderation and in equity, yet this belongs really to Christ alone, who
not only exercises authority justly as others do, but also communicates
to us the righteous of God, partly when he makes us to be counted
righteous by a gratuitous reconciliation, and partly when he renews us
by his Spirit, that we may lead a godly and holy life. He is then called
the King of righteousness, because of what he effects in diffusing
righteousness on all his people.  <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) It hence follows, that out of his
kingdom nothing but sin reigns among men. And therefore Zechariah, when
he introduces him, as by the solemn decree of God, into the possession
of his kingdom, thus extols him, —

<span id="xiii.i-p17"></span>“Rejoice, O daughter of Sion, Behold thy
righteous King  
cometh to thee,” (<span id="xiii.i-p17.2"></span>[Zec
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#010)<span id="xiii.i-p17.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="xiii.i-p18"></span>intimating that the righteousness, which is
otherwise wanting to us, is brought to us by the coming of Christ.

<span id="xiii.i-p19"></span>The second likeness which the Apostle
states is as to the kingdom of *peace.* This peace indeed is the fruit
of that righteousness which he has mentioned. It hence follows that
wherever Christ’s kingdom extends, there peace ought to be, as we find
in <span id="xiii.i-p19.1"></span>[Isa.
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001.md), [Isa.
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001.md)<span id="xiii.i-p19.1"></span>,
and in other places. But as peace among the Hebrews means also a
prosperous and happy state, it may be so taken here: yet I prefer to
understand it here of that inward peace which tranquilizes the
conscience and renders it confident before God. And the excellency of
this blessing cannot be sufficiently estimated, unless you consider on
the other hand, how miserable a thing it is to be tormented by constant
inquietude; which must necessarily be the case until we have our
consciences pacified by being reconciled to God through Christ.

<span id="xiii.i-p20"></span><span id="xiii.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p21"></span>**3.** *Without father,* *etc.* I prefer
this rendering to that of “unknown father;” for the Apostle meant to
express something more emphatic than that the family of Melchisedec was
obscure or unknown. Nor does this objection disturb me, that the reality
does not correspond with the figure or type, because Christ has a Father
in heaven, and had a mother on earth; for the Apostle immediately
explains his meaning by adding *without descent,* or kindred. He then
exempts Melchisedec from what is common to others, a descent by birth;
by which he means that he is eternal, so that his beginning from men was
not to be sought after. It is indeed certain that he descended from
parents; but the Apostle does not speak of him here in his private
capacity; on the contrary, he sets him forth as a type of Christ. He
therefore allows himself to see nothing in him but what Scripture
contains. For in treating of things respecting Christ, such reverence
ought to be observed as not to know anything but what is written in the
Word of the Lord. Now, as the Holy Spirit in mentioning this king, the
most illustrious of his age, is wholly silent as to his birth, and makes
afterwards no record of his death, is not this the same thing as though
eternity was to be ascribed to him? And what was shadowed forth in
Melchisedec is really exhibited in Christ. It behooves us then to be
satisfied with this moderate view, that while Scripture sets forth to us
Melchisedec as one who had never been born and never died, it shows to
us as in a mirror, that Christ has neither a beginning nor an end.
 <span id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md)

<span id="xiii.i-p23"></span>But we hence also learn how much reverence
and sobriety is required as to the spiritual mysteries of God: for what
is not found read in Scripture the Apostle is not only willing to be
ignorant of, but also would have us to seek to know. And surely it is
not lawful for us to allege anything of Christ from our own thoughts.
And Melchisedec is not to be considered here, as they say, in his
private capacity, but as a sacred type of Christ; nor ought we to think
that it was accidentally or inadvertently omitted that no kindred is
ascribed to him, and that nothing is said of his death; but on the
contrary, that this was done designedly by the Spirit, in order to give
us an idea of one above the common order of men. There seems therefore
to be no probability in the conjecture of those who say that Melchisedec
was Shem the son of Noah; for if we make him to be some known
individual, we destroy this third likeness between Melchisedec and
Christ.

<span id="xiii.i-p24"></span>*Made like,* or *assimilated, etc.* Not as
far as what was typified required; for we must always bear in mind that
there is but an analogy between the thing signified and the sign; for
they make themselves ridiculous who imagine that he came down from
heaven, in order that there might be a perfect similarity. It is enough
that we see in him the lineaments of Christ, as the form of the living
man may be seen in his picture, while yet the man himself is very
different from what represents him.  <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) It seems not to be worth one’s while
to refute the delirious notions of those who dream that Christ himself,
or the holy Spirit, or an angel, appeared at that time; unless indeed
one thought it to be the duty of a right­minded man to dispute with
Postillus and such fanatics; for that impostor asserts that he is
Melchisedec with no less supercilious folly than those mad spirits of
old, mentioned by Jerome, who pretended that they were Christ.

<span id="xiii.ii"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 7:4-10

<span id="xiii.ii-p2"></span>**4.** Now consider how great this man
*was*, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the
spoils.

<span id="xiii.ii-p3"></span>**4.** Considerate autem quantus sit hic,
cui et decimas dedit de spoliis Abraham patriarcha.

<span id="xiii.ii-p4"></span>**5.** And verily they that are of the sons
of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to
take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their
brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:

<span id="xiii.ii-p5"></span>**5.** Atque ii quidem qui sacerdotium
accipiunt, qui scilicet sunt ex filiis Levi, praeceptum habent a populo
decimas sumendi juxta legem, hoc est, a fratribus suis licet egressis ex
lumbis Abrahae:

<span id="xiii.ii-p6"></span>**6.** But he whose descent is not counted
from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the
promises.

<span id="xiii.ii-p7"></span>**6.** Cujus autem genus non recensetur ex
ipsis, decimas sumpsit ab Abraham, et habentem promissiones benedixit.

<span id="xiii.ii-p8"></span>**7.** And without all contradiction the
less is blessed of the better.

<span id="xiii.ii-p9"></span>**7.** Porro sine controversia quod minus
est a potiore benedicitur.

<span id="xiii.ii-p10"></span>**8.** And here men that die receive
tithes; but there he *receiveth them*, of whom it is witnessed that he
liveth.

<span id="xiii.ii-p11"></span>**8.** Atque hic quidem homines qui
moriuntur, decimas accipiunt; illic autem is de quo testatum est quod
vivat:

<span id="xiii.ii-p12"></span>**9.** And as I may so say, Levi also, who
receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.

<span id="xiii.ii-p13"></span>**9.** Et ut ita loquar, in Abraham
decimatus est ipse Levi qui decimas solet accipere;

<span id="xiii.ii-p14"></span>**10.** For he was yet in the loins of his
father, when Melchisedec met him.

<span id="xiii.ii-p15"></span>**10.** Nam is adhuc in lumbis patris erat
quum occurrerit Abrahae Melchisedec.

<span id="xiii.ii-p16"></span> 

<span id="xiii.ii-p17"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p18"></span>**4.** *Now consider*, *etc.* This is the
fourth comparison between Christ and Melchisedec, that Abraham presented
tithes to him. But though tithes were instituted for several reasons,
yet the Apostle here refers only to what serves his present purpose. One
reason why tithes were paid to the Levites was, because they were the
children of Abraham, to whose seed the land was promised. It was, then,
by a hereditary right that a portion of the land was allotted to them;
for as they were not allowed to possess land, a compensation was made to
them in tithes. There was also another reason, — that as they were
occupied in the service of God and the public ministry of the Church, it
was right that they should be supported at the public cost of the
people. Then the rest of the Israelites owed them tithes as a
remuneration for their work. But these reasons bear not at all on the
present subject; therefore, the Apostle passes them by. The only reason
now alleged is, that as the people offered the tithes as a sacred
tribute to God, the Levites only received them. It hence appears that it
was no small honor that God in a manner substituted them for himself.
Then Abraham, being one of the chief sergeants of God and a prophet,
having offered tithes to Melchisedec the priest, thereby confessed that
Melchisedec excelled him in dignity. If, then, the *patriarch* Abraham
owned him more honourable than himself, his dignity must have been
singular and extraordinary. The word *patriarch* is mentioned for the
sake of setting forth his dignity; for it was in the highest degree
honourable to him to have been called a father in the Church of God.

<span id="xiii.ii-p19"></span>Then the argument is this, — Abraham, who
excelled all others, was yet inferior to Melchisedec; then Melchisedec
had the highest place of honor, and is to be regarded as superior to all
the sons of Levi. The first part is proved, for what Abraham owed to God
he gave to Melchisedec: then by paying him the tenth he confessed
himself to be inferior.

<span id="xiii.ii-p20"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p21"></span>**5.** *And verily they,* *etc.* It would
be more suitable to render the words thus, “because they are the sons of
Levi.” The Apostle indeed does not assign it as a reason that they
received tithes because they were the sons of Levi; but he is comparing
the whole tribe with Melchisedec in this way. Though God granted to the
Levites the right of requiring tithes from the people, and thus set them
above all the Israelites, yet they have all descended from the same
parent; and Abraham, the father of them all, paid tithes to a priest of
another race: then all the descendants of Abraham are inferior to this
priest. Thus the right conferred on the Levites was particular as to the
rest of their brethren; yet Melchisedec, without exception, occupies the
highest place, so that all are inferior to him. Some think that the
tenths of tenths are intended, which the Levites paid to the higher
priests; but there is no reason thus to confine the general declaration.
The view, then, I have given is the most probable.

<span id="xiii.ii-p22"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p23"></span>**6.** *Blessed him,* *etc.* This is the
fifth comparison between Christ and Melchisedec. The Apostle assumes it
as an admitted principle that the less is blessed by the greater; and
then he adds that Melchisedec blessed Abraham: hence the conclusion is
that the less was Abraham. But for the sake of strengthening his
argument he again raises the dignity of Abraham; for the more glorious
Abraham is made, the higher the dignity of Melchisedec appears. For this
purpose he says that Abraham had the *promises;* by which he means that
he was the first of the holy race with whom God made the covenant of
eternal life. It was not indeed a common honor that God chose him from
all the rest that he might deposit with him the privilege of adoption
and the testimony of his love. But all this was no hindrance that he
should not submit himself in all his preeminence to the priesthood of
Melchisedec. We hence see how great he was to whom Abraham gave place in
these two things, — that he suffered himself to be blessed by him, and
that he offered him tithes as to God’s vicegerent.

<span id="xiii.ii-p24"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p25"></span>**7.** *The less is,*  <span
id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) *etc.* Let us first know what the word
*blessed* means here. It means indeed a solemn praying by which he who
is invested with some high and public honor, recommends to God men in
private stations and under his ministry. Another way of blessing is when
we pray for one another; which is commonly done by all the godly. But
this blessing mentioned by the Apostle was a symbol of greater
authority. Thus Isaac blessed his son Jacob, and Jacob himself blessed
his grandsons, Ephraim and Manasseh. (<span
id="xiii.ii-p26.3"></span>[Gen. 27:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#027.md),
[Gen. 48:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#015.md)<span
id="xiii.ii-p26.3"></span>.) This was not done mutually, for the son
could not do the like to the father; but a higher authority was required
for such a blessing as this. And this appears more evident still from
<span id="xiii.ii-p26.4"></span>[Nu
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p26.4"></span>,
where a command is given to the priest to bless the people, and then a
promise is immediately added, that they would be blessed whom they
blessed. It hence appears that the blessing of the priest depended on
this, — that it was not so much man’s blessing as that of God. For as
the priest in offering sacrifices represented Christ, so in blessing the
people he was nothing more than a minister and legate of the supreme
God. In the same sense ought to be understood what Luke records when he
says, that Christ lifted up his hands and blessed the Apostles. (<span
id="xiii.ii-p26.5"></span>[Lu
24:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050.md)<span
id="xiii.ii-p26.5"></span>.) The practice of lifting up the hands he no
doubt borrowed from the priests, in order to show that he was the person
by whom God the Father blesses us. Of this blessing mention is also made
in <span id="xiii.ii-p26.6"></span>[Ps.
116:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#017.md), [Ps.
118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p26.6"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p27"></span>Let us now apply this idea to what the
apostle treats of: The blessing of the priest, while it is a divine work
is also an evidence of a higher honor; then Melchisedec, in blessing
Abraham, assumed to himself a higher dignity. This he did, not
presumptuously, but according to his right as a priest: then he was more
eminent than Abraham. Yet Abraham was he with whom God was pleased to
make the covenant of salvation; though, then, he was superior to all
others, yet he was surpassed by Melchisedec.  <span
id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md)

<span id="xiii.ii-p29"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p30"></span>**8.** *Of whom it is witnessed that he
liveth.* He takes the silence respecting his death, as I have said, as
an evidence of his life. This would not indeed hold as to others, but as
to Melchisedec it ought rightly to be so regarded, inasmuch as he was a
type of Christ. For as the spiritual kingdom and priesthood of Christ
are spoken of here, there is no place left for human conjectures; nor is
it lawful for us to seek to know anything farther than what we read in
Scripture. But we are not hence to conclude that the man who met Abraham
is yet alive, as some have childishly thought, for this is to be applied
to the other person whom he represented, even the Son of God. And by
these words the Apostle intended to show, that the dignity of
Melchisedec’s priesthood was to be perpetual, while that of the Levites
was temporary.  <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md)

<span id="xiii.ii-p32"></span>For he thus reasons, — those to whom the
Law assigns tithes are dying men; by which it was indicated that the
priesthood would some time be abrogated, as their life came to an end:
but the Scripture makes no mention of the death of Melchisedec, when it
relates that tithes were paid to him; so the authority of his priesthood
is limited by no time, but on the contrary there is given an indication
of perpetuity. And this is added for this purpose, lest a posterior law,
as it is usual, should seem to take away from the authority of a former
law. For it might have been otherwise objected and said, that the right
which Melchisedec formerly possessed is now void and null, because God
had introduced another law by Moses, by which he transferred the right
to the Levites. But the Apostle anticipates this objection by saying,
that tithes were paid to the Levites only for a time, because they did
not live; but that Melchisedec, because he is immortal, retains even to
the end what was once given to him by God.

<span id="xiii.ii-p33"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p34"></span>**9.** *Levi also,* *etc.* He advances
farther, and says, that even Levi himself, who was then *in the loins of
Abraham*, was not exempt from the same subordination; for Abraham, by
paying tithes, made himself and his posterity inferior to the priesthood
of Melchisedec.  <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) But here one,
on the other hand, may say, that in the same way Judas also of whose
seed Christ was born, paid tithes. But this knot can be easily untied,
when one considers two things which are settled beyond all dispute among
Christians: first, Christ is not to be counted simply as one of the sons
of Abraham, but is to be exempted by a peculiar privilege from the
common order of men; and this is what he himself said, “If he is the son
of David, then does David call him his Lord?” (<span
id="xiii.ii-p35.2"></span>[Mt
22:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#045.md)<span
id="xiii.ii-p35.2"></span>;) secondly, since Melchisedec is a type of
Christ, it is by no means reasonable that the one should be set in
opposition to the other; for we must remember that common saying, that
what is subordinate is not in opposition: hence the type, which comes
short of the reality, ought by no means to be opposed to it, nor can it
be, for such is the conflict of equals.

<span id="xiii.ii-p36"></span>These five particulars, mentioned by the
Apostle, complete the comparison between Christ and Melchisedec, and
thus is dissipated the gloss of those who seek to show that the chief
likeness between them is in offering of bread and wine. We see that the
Apostle carefully, and even scrupulously, examines here each of these
points; he mentions the name of the man, the seat of his kingdom, the
perpetuity of his life, his right to tithes, and his benediction.

<span id="xiii.ii-p37"></span>There is, forsooth! in these things, less
importance than in the oblation! Shall we say that the Spirit of God,
through forgetfulness, omitted this, so that he dwelt on minor things,
and left unnoticed the chief thing, and what was most necessary for his
purpose? I marvel the more that so many of the ancient doctors of the
Church were so led away by this notion, that they dwelt only on the
offering of bread and wine. And thus they spoke, “Christ is a priest
according to the order of Melchisedec; and Melchisedec offered bread and
wine; then the sacrifice of bread and wine is suitable to the priesthood
of Christ.” The Apostle will hereafter speak largely of the ancient
sacrifices; but of this new sacrifice of bread and wine he says not a
word. Whence then did ecclesiastical writers derive this notion?
Doubtless, as one error usually leads to another, having of themselves
imagined a sacrifice in Christ’s Supper without any command from him,
and thus adulterated the Supper by adding a sacrifice, they afterwards
endeavored to find out plausible arguments here and there in order to
disguise and cover their error. This offering of bread and wine pleased
them, and was instantly laid hold on without any discretion. For who can
concede that these men were more intelligent than the Spirit of God? Yet
if we receive what they teach, we must condemn God’s Spirit for
inadvertence in having omitted a matter so important, especially as the
question is avowedly handled!

<span id="xiii.ii-p38"></span>I hence conclude, that the ancients
invented a sacrifice, of which Moses had never thought; for Melchisedec
offered bread and wine, not to God, but on the contrary to Abraham and
his companions. These are the words, “Melchisedec, king of Salem, went
out to meet him, and brought forth bread and wine; and the same was
priest to the most high God, and blessed him.” (<span
id="xiii.ii-p38.1"></span>[Ge
14:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#018.md)<span
id="xiii.ii-p38.1"></span>.) The first thing mentioned was a royal act;
he refreshed those wearied after the battle and their journey with
sustenance; the blessing was the act of a priest. If then his offering
had anything mystical in it, the completion of it is to be found in
Christ, when he fed the hungry and those wearied with fatigue. But the
Papists are extremely ridiculous, who though they deny that there is
bread and wine in the Mass, yet prattle about the sacrifice of bread and
wine.

<span id="xiii.iii"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 7:11-14

<span id="xiii.iii-p2"></span>**11.** If therefore perfection were by
the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,)
what further need *was there* that another priest should rise after the
order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

<span id="xiii.iii-p3"></span>**11.** Porro si consummatio per Leviticum
sacerdotium erat (populus enim sub eo legem accepit) quid adhuc opus
fuit secundum ordinem Melchisedec alterum exoriri sacerdotem, et non
secundum ordinem Aaron dici?

<span id="xiii.iii-p4"></span>**12.** For the priesthood being changed,
there is made of necessity a change also of the law.

<span id="xiii.iii-p5"></span>**12.** Etenim dum transfertur
sacerdotium, necessario etiam fit legis translatio.

<span id="xiii.iii-p6"></span>**13.** For he of whom these things are
spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at
the altar.

<span id="xiii.iii-p7"></span>**13.** Certe is de quo haec dicuntur,
alterius fuit tribus particeps, ex qua nemo adstitit altari.

<span id="xiii.iii-p8"></span>**14.** For *it is* evident that our Lord
sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning
priesthood.

<span id="xiii.iii-p9"></span>**14.** Clarum enim est quod ex tribu
Judae natus sit Dominus noster, de qua tribu nihil loquutus est Moses
quod ad sacerdotium spectat.

<span id="xiii.iii-p10"></span> 

<span id="xiii.iii-p11"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p12"></span>**11.** *If therefore perfection,* or,
moreover if perfection,  <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) *etc.*
From the same testimony the Apostle concludes, that the old covenant was
abrogated by the coming of Christ. He has hitherto spoken of the office
and person of the priest; but as God had instituted a priesthood for the
purpose of ratifying the Law, the former being abolished, the latter
necessarily ceases. That this may be better understood, we must bear in
mind the general truth, — That no covenant between God and man is in
force and ratified, except it rests on a priesthood. Hence the Apostle
says, that the Law was introduced among the ancient people under the
Levitical priesthood; by which he intimates, that it not only prevailed
during the time of the Law, but that it was instituted, as we have said
for the sake of confirming the Law.

<span id="xiii.iii-p14"></span>He now reasons thus, If the ministry of
the Church was perfect under the order of Aaron, why was it necessary to
return to another order? For in perfection nothing can be changed. It
then follows, that the ministry of the Law was not perfect, for that new
order was to be introduced of which David speaks.  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md)

<span id="xiii.iii-p16"></span>*For under it the people received the
Law,* *etc.* This parenthesis is inserted in order that we may know that
the Law was annexed to the priesthood. The Apostle had in view to prove
that in the Law of Moses there was no ultimate end at which we ought to
stop. This he proves by the abrogation of the priesthoods and in this
way: Had the authority of the ancient priesthood been such as to be
sufficient fully to establish the Law, God would have never introduced
in its place another and a different priesthood. Now, as some might
doubt whether the abolition of the Law followed the abolition of the
priesthood, he says that the Law was not only brought in under it, but
that it was also by it established.  <span
id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md)

<span id="xiii.iii-p18"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p19"></span>**12.** *For the priesthood being
changed,* or, *transferred, etc.* As the authority of the Law and the
priesthood is the same, Christ became not only a priest, but also a
Lawgiver; so that the right of Aaron, as well as of Moses, was
transferred to him. The sum of the whole is, that the ministry of Moses
was no less temporary than that of Aaron; and hence both were annulled
by the coming of Christ, for the one could not stand without the other.
By the word *Law*, we understand what peculiarly belonged to Moses; for
the Law contains the rule of life, and the gratuitous covenant of life;
and in it we find everywhere many remarkable sentences by which we are
instructed as to faith, and as to the fear of God. None of these were
abolished by Christ, but only that part which regarded the ancient
priesthood.

<span id="xiii.iii-p20"></span>For Christ is here compared with Moses;
whatever then they had in common, is not to be taken to the account, but
only the things in which they differ. They in common offer God’s mercy
to us, prescribe the rule of a holy and godly life, teach us the true
worship of God, and exhort us to exercise faith and patience, and all
the duties of godliness. But Moses was different from Christ in this
respect, that while the love of the Gospel was not as yet made known, he
kept the people under veils, set forth the knowledge of Christ by types
and shadows, and, in short, accommodated himself to the capacity of
ignorant people, and did not rise higher than to puerile elements. We
must then remember, that the Law is that part of the ministration which
Moses had as peculiarly his own, and different from that of Christ. That
law, as it was subordinate to the ancient priesthood, was abolished when
the priesthood was abolished. And Christ, being made a priest, was
invested also with the authority of a legislator, that he might be the
teacher and interpreter of the new covenant. At the same time, the word
Law is applied, though not in its strict sense, to the Gospel; but this
impropriety of language is so far from having anything harsh in it, that
on account of the contrast it adds beauty to the sentence, as we find in
the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans

<span id="xiii.iii-p21"></span>Moreover, the impiety of the Pope is
extremely arrogant, who has inserted this article in his decretals, that
he himself is now invested with the same authority as Aaron formerly
had, because the Law and also the priesthood have been transferred to
him. We see what the Apostle says; he maintains that ceremonies have
ceased since the time when Christ came forth with command to proclaim
the new covenant. It is then absurd hence to conclude, that anything has
been transferred to the ministers of Christ; for Christ himself is alone
contrasted here with Moses and Aaron. Under what pretext then can
Antichrist arrogate to himself any such authority? I do not indeed speak
now for the sake of disproving so gross an arrogance; but it is worth
while to remind readers of this sacrilegious audacity, that they may
know that this notorious servant of the servants of Christ wholly
disregards the honor of his Master, and boldly mangles the Scriptures,
that he may have some cloak for his own tyranny.

<span id="xiii.iii-p23"></span>**13.** *For he of whom these things are
spoken,* or, *said*,  <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) *etc.* As
the Apostle was speaking to them who confessed Jesus the Son of Mary to
be the Christ, he proves that an end was put to the ancient priesthood,
because the new Priest, who had been set in the place of the old, was of
another tribe, and not of Levi; for according to the Law the honor of
the priesthood was to continue, by a special privilege, in that tribe.
But he says that it was *evident* that Christ was born of the tribe of
Judah, for it was then a fact commonly known. As then they acknowledged
that he was the Christ, it was also necessary that they should be
persuaded that he was the son of David; for he who had been promised
could derive his origin from no other.

<span id="xiii.iv"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 7:15-22

<span id="xiii.iv-p2"></span>**15.** And it is yet far more evident: for
that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,

<span id="xiii.iv-p3"></span>**15.** Idque magis etiam liquet, siquidem
ad similitudinem Melchisedec exoritur sacerdos alius;

<span id="xiii.iv-p4"></span>**16.** Who is made, not after the law of a
carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.

<span id="xiii.iv-p5"></span>**16.** Qui non juxta legem mandati
carnalis factus fuit, sed secundum potentiam vitae insolubilis.

<span id="xiii.iv-p6"></span>**17.** For he testifieth, Thou *art* a
priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

<span id="xiii.iv-p7"></span>**17.** Testatur enim ad hunc modum, Tu

<span id="xiii.iv-p8"></span>**18.** For there is verily a disannulling
of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness
thereof.

<span id="xiii.iv-p9"></span>**18.** Abrogatio enim sit prioris mandati
propter imbecillitatem et inutilitatem.

<span id="xiii.iv-p10"></span>**19.** For the law made nothing perfect,
but the bringing in of a better hope *did*; by the which we draw nigh
unto God.

<span id="xiii.iv-p11"></span>**19.** Nihil enim lex perfecit, sed

<span id="xiii.iv-p12"></span>**20.** And inasmuch as not without an
oath *he was made priest*:

<span id="xiii.iv-p13"></span>**20.** Atque hoc potiorem, quod non

<span id="xiii.iv-p14"></span>**21.** (For those priests were made
without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The
Lord sware and will not repent, Thou *art* a priest for ever after the
order of Melchisedec:)

<span id="xiii.iv-p15"></span>**21.** Hic vero cum jurejurando, per eum

<span id="xiii.iv-p19"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p20"></span>**15.** *And it is yet far more evident,*
*etc.* He proves by another argument, that the Law is abolished. He
reasoned before as to the person of the priest, but now as to the nature
of the priesthood, and the reason for which it was appointed. The
ancient priesthood, he says, had to do with external rites; but in
Christ’s priesthood there is nothing but what is spiritual. It hence
appears, that the former was evanescent and temporary; but that the
latter was to be perpetual.

<span id="xiii.iv-p21"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p22"></span>**16.** *Carnal commandment,* *etc.* It
was called *carnal*, because it refers to things corporal, that is, to
external rites. We know how Aaron and his sons were initiated into their
office. What was fulfilled in Christ by the hidden and celestial power
of the Spirit, was shadowed forth under the Law by ointment, various
vestments, the sprinkling of blood, and other earthly ceremonies. Now
this kind of institution was suitable to the nature of the priesthood;
it hence follows, that the priesthood itself was liable to change. At
the same time, as we shall hereafter see, the priesthood was not so
carnal, but that it was still spiritual; but the Apostle here refers
only to the difference between Christ and Aaron. However spiritual then
might have been the meaning of these shadows, they were yet but shadows
in themselves; and as they were made up of the elements of this world,
they may justly be called earthly.

<span id="xiii.iv-p23"></span>*After the power of an endless life,* or,
of an indissoluble life. As Christ is a perpetual priest, it was
necessary, that he should be different from Aaron as to the manner of
his appointment; and so it was, for it was not Moses, a mortal man, who
consecrated him, but the Holy Spirit, and that not with oil, nor with
the blood of goats, nor with the outward pomp of vestments, but with
celestial power, which the Apostle here sets in opposition to weak
elements. We hence see how the eternity of his priesthood was exhibited
in Christ.

<span id="xiii.iv-p24"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p25"></span>**17.** *Thou art a priest forever,*
*etc.* It is on the single word *forever,* that the Apostle lays stress
in this passage; for he confirms what he said of an *indissoluble life*.
He then shows that Christ differs from the whole race of Levi, because
he is made a priest for ever.  <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md)

<span id="xiii.iv-p27"></span>But here it may be objected, as the Jews
also do, that the word,<span id="xiii.iv-p27.1"></span>לעולם *laoulam,*
does not always mean eternity, but the extent of one age, or, at
farthest, a long time; and it is added, that when Moses speaks of the
ancient sacrifices, he often uses this expression, “This ordinance shall
be forever.” (<span id="xiii.iv-p27.2"></span>[Exod.
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#017.md), [Exod.
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#009)<span id="xiii.iv-p27.2"></span>..md)
To this I answer that whenever the sacrifices of the Law are mentioned,
“forever” is to be confined to the time of the Law; nor ought this to be
deemed strange; for by the coming of Christ a certain renovation of the
world was effected. Whenever, then, Moses speaks of his own
ministration, he extends the longest time no farther than to Christ. It
must yet be also observed, that “forever” is applied to the ancient
sacrifices, not with regard to the external ceremony, but on account of
their mystical signification. On the present occasion, however, this
reason ought to be sufficient, that Moses and his ministrations were for
ever; that is, until the coming of the kingdom of Christ, under whom the
world was renovated. Now when Christ is come, and a perpetual priesthood
is given to him, we can find no end to his age, so that it cannot
terminate after a certain period of time. So when applied to him, the
word ought to be understood in the sense of eternity; for by the context
we are always to judge of the meaning of the word, <span
id="xiii.iv-p27.3"></span> לעולם*laoulam*

<span id="xiii.iv-p28"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p29"></span>**18.** *For there is verily a
disannulling,* or *abrogation, etc.* As the Apostle’s discourse depends
on this hinge, that the Law together with the priesthood had come to an
end, he explains the reason why it ought to have been abolished, even
because it was weak and unprofitable. And he speaks thus in reference to
the ceremonies, which had nothing substantial in them, nor in themselves
anything available to salvation; for the promise of favor annexed to
them, and what Moses everywhere testifies that God would be pacified by
sacrifices and that sins would be expiated, did not properly belong to
sacrifices, but were only adventitious to them. For as all types had a
reference to Christ, so from him they derived all their virtue and
effect; nay, of themselves they availed nothing or effected nothing; but
their whole efficacy depended on Christ alone

<span id="xiii.iv-p30"></span>But as the Jews foolishly set up these in
opposition to Christ, the Apostle, referring to this notion, shows the
difference between these things and Christ. For as soon as they are
separated from Christ, there is nothing left in them, but the weakness
of which he speaks; in a word, there is no benefit to be found in the
ancient ceremonies, except as they refer to Christ; for in this way they
so made the Jews acquainted with God’s grace, that they in a manner kept
them in expectation of it. Let us then remember that the Law is useless,
when separated from Christ. And he also confirms the same truth by
calling it the *commandment going before;* for it is a well­known and
common saying, that former laws are abrogated by the latter. The Law had
been promulgated long before David; but he was in possession of his
kingdom when he proclaimed this prophecy respecting the appointment of a
new priest; this new Law then annulled the former.

<span id="xiii.iv-p31"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p31.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p32"></span>**19.** *For the Law made nothing
perfect,* *etc.* As he had spoken rather harshly of the Law, he now
mitigates or, as it were, corrects that asperity; for he concedes to it
some utility, as it had pointed out the way which leads at length to
salvation. It was, however, of such a kind as to be far short of
perfection. The Apostle then reasons thus: The Law was only a beginning;
then something more perfect was necessarily, to follow; for it is not
fit that God’s children should always continue in childish elements. By
the word *bringing in,* or introduction, he means a certain preparation
made by the Law, as children are taught in those elements which smooth
the way to what is higher. But as the preposition ἐπὶ denotes a
consequence, when one thing follows another; it ought, as I think, to be
thus rendered, “but added was an introduction into a better hope.” For
he mentions two introductions, according to my view; the first by
Melchisedec as a type; and the second by the Law, which was in time
later. Moreover, by *Law* he designates the Levitical priesthood, which
was superadded to the priesthood of Melchisedec.

<span id="xiii.iv-p33"></span>By a *better hope* is to be understood the
condition of the faithful under the reign of Christ; but he had in view
the fathers, who could not be satisfied with the state in which they
were then, but aspired to higher things. Hence that saying, “Many kings
and prophets desired to see the things which ye see.” (<span
id="xiii.iv-p33.1"></span>[Lu
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024.md)<span
id="xiii.iv-p33.1"></span>.) They were therefore led by the hand of the
Law as a schoolmaster, that they might advance farther.  <span
id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md)

<span id="xiii.iv-p35"></span>*By the which we draw nigh,* *etc.* There
is to be understood here an implied contrast between us and the fathers;
for in honor and privilege we excel them, as God has communicated to us
a full knowledge of himself, but he appeared to them as it were afar off
and obscurely. And there is an allusion here made to the tabernacle or
the temple; for the people stood afar off in the court, nor was there a
nearer access to the sanctuary opened to any one except to the priests;
and into the interior sanctuary the highest priest only entered; but
now, the tabernacle being removed, God admits us into a familiar
approach to himself, which the fathers were not permitted to have. Then
he who still holds to the shadows of the Law, or seeks to restore them,
not only obscures the glory of Christ, but also deprives us of an
immense benefit; for he puts God at a great distance from us, to
approach whom there is a liberty granted to us by the Gospel. And
whosoever continues in the Law, knowingly and willingly deprives himself
of the privilege of approaching nigh to God.

<span id="xiii.iv-p36"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p36.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p37"></span>**20.** *And inasmuch as not without an
oath,* *etc.* Here is another argument, why the Law ought to give place
to the Gospel; for God has set Christ’s priesthood above that of Aaron,
since in honor to the former he was pleased to make an oath. For when he
appointed the ancient priests, he introduced no oath; but it is said of
Christ, the Lord swore; which was doubtless done for the sake of
honoring him. We see the end for which he again quotes the Psalmist,
even that we may know, that more honor through God’s oath was given to
Christ than to any others. But we must bear in mind this truth, that a
priest is made that he may be the surety of a covenant. The Apostle
hence concludes, that the covenant which God has made by Christ with us,
is far more excellent than the old covenant of which Moses was the
interpreter.

<span id="xiii.v"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 7:23-28

<span id="xiii.v-p2"></span>**23.** And they truly were many priests,
because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:

<span id="xiii.v-p3"></span>**23.** Et illi quidem plures facti fuerunt
sacerdotes, quod prohiberentur morti permanere:

<span id="xiii.v-p4"></span>**24.** But this *man*, because he
continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.

<span id="xiii.v-p5"></span>**24.** Hic autem quia perpetuo manet
immutabile habet sacerdotium.

<span id="xiii.v-p6"></span>**25.** Wherefore he is able also to save
them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth
to make intercession for them.

<span id="xiii.v-p7"></span>**25.** Unde et servare in aeternum potest
eos qui per ipsum Deo appropinquant, semper vivens ut intercedat pro
nobis.

<span id="xiii.v-p8"></span>**26.** For such an high priest became us,
*who is* holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made
higher than the heavens;

<span id="xiii.v-p9"></span>**26.** Talis enim nos decebat Pontifex,
sanctus, innocens, impollutus, segregatus a peccatoribus, et excelsior
coelis factus;

<span id="xiii.v-p10"></span>**27.** Who needeth not daily, as those
high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then
for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.

<span id="xiii.v-p11"></span>**27.** Qui non necesse habeat quotidie,
quemadmodum sacerdotes, primum pro suis peccatis hostias offerre, deinde
pro populi: hoc enim semel fecit, quum seipsum obtulit.

<span id="xiii.v-p12"></span>**28.** For the law maketh men high priests
which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law,
*maketh* the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.

<span id="xiii.v-p13"></span>**28.** Lex quidem homines constituit
sacerdotes habentes informatem; sermo autem jurisjurandi, quod lege
posterius est, Filium in aeternum perfectum.

<span id="xiii.v-p14"></span> 

<span id="xiii.v-p15"></span><span id="xiii.v-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p16"></span>**23.** *And they truly,* *etc.* He had
already touched on this comparison; but as the subject deserved more
attention, he unfolds it more fully, though the point discussed is
different from what it was before; for then he concluded that the
ancient priesthood was to come to an end because they who exercised it
were mortal; but now he simply shows that Christ remains perpetually a
priest. This he does by an argument taken from things unequal; the
ancient priests were many, for death put an end to their priesthood; but
there is no death to prevent Christ from discharging his office. Then he
alone is a perpetual priest. Thus a different cause produces different
effects.

<span id="xiii.v-p17"></span><span id="xiii.v-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p18"></span>**25.** *Wherefore he is able to save,*
*etc.* This is the fruit of an eternal priesthood, even our salvation,
if indeed we gather this fruit by faith as we ought to do. For where
death is or a change, you will there seek salvation in vain; hence they
who cleave to the ancient priesthood, can never attain salvation. When
he says, *them that come unto God,* or who approach God, by this phrase
he points out the faithful who alone enjoy the salvation procured by
Christ; but he yet at the same time indicates what faith ought to regard
in a mediator. The chief good of man is to be united to his God, with
whom is the fountain of life and of all blessings; but their own
unworthiness drives all away from any access to him. Then the peculiar
office of a mediator is to bring us help in this respect, and to stretch
out his hand to us that he may lead us to heaven. And he ever alludes to
the ancient shadows of the Law; for though the high priest carried the
names of the twelve tribes on his shoulders and symbols on his breast,
yet he alone entered the sanctuary, while the people stood in the court.
But now by relying on Christ the Mediator we enter by faith into heaven,
for there is no longer any veil intervening, but God appears to us
openly, and lovingly invites us to a familiar access.  <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md)

<span id="xiii.v-p21"></span>*Seeing he ever liveth,* *etc.* What sort
of pledge and how great is this of love towards us! Christ liveth for
us, not for himself! That he was received into a blessed immortality to
reign in heaven, this has taken place, as the Apostle declares, for our
sake. Then the life, and the kingdom, and the glory of Christ are all
destined for our salvation as to their object; nor has Christ any thing,
which may not be applied to our benefit; for he has been given to us by
the Father once for all on this condition, that all his should be ours.
He at the same time teaches us by what Christ is doing, that he is
performing his office as a priest; for it belongs to a priest to
*intercede* for the people, that they may obtain favor with God. This is
what Christ is ever doing, for it was for this purpose that he rose
again from the dead. Then of right, for his continual intercession, he
claims for himself the office of the priesthood.

<span id="xiii.v-p22"></span><span id="xiii.v-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p23"></span>**26.** *For such an high priest,* *etc.*
He reasons from what is necessarily connected with the subject. These
conditions, or qualifications, as they commonly say, are of necessity
required in a priest — that he should be just, harmless, and pure from
every spot. This honor belongs to Christ alone. Then what was required
for the real discharge of the office was wanting in the priests of the
law. It hence follows, that there was no perfection in the Levitical
priesthood; nor was it indeed in itself legitimate, unless it was
subservient to that of Christ; and, doubtless, the external ornaments of
the high priest indicated this defect; for why were those costly and
splendid vestments used with which God commanded Aaron to be adorned
while performing holy rites, except that they were symbols of a holiness
and excellency far exceeding all human virtues? Now, these types were
introduced, because the reality did not exist. It then appears that
Christ alone is the fully qualified priest.

<span id="xiii.v-p24"></span>*Separate from sinners,* *etc.* This clause
includes all the rest. For there was some holiness, and harmlessness,
and purity in Aaron, but only a small measure; for he and his sons were
defiled with many spots; but Christ, exempt from the common lot of men,
is alone free from every sin; hence in him alone is found real holiness
and innocency. For he is not said to be separate from us, because he
repels us from his society, but because he has this excellency above us
all, that he is free from every uncleanness.  <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md)

<span id="xiii.v-p26"></span>And we hence conclude, that all prayers,
which are not supported by Christ’s intercession, are rejected.

<span id="xiii.v-p27"></span>It may, however, be asked as to angels,
whether they are separate from sinners? And if so, what prevents them
from discharging the offices of the priesthood, and from being our
mediators with God? To this there is an easy reply: — No one is a lawful
priest, except he is appointed by God’s command; and God has nowhere
conferred this honor on angels. It would then be a sacrilegious
usurpation, were they, without being called, to intrude into the office;
besides, it is necessary, as we shall presently see at the beginning of
the next chapter, that the Mediator between God and men should himself
be a man. At the same time the last thing mentioned here by the Apostle
is abundantly sufficient as an answer to the question; for no one can
unite us to God but he who reaches to God; and this is not the privilege
of angels, for they are not said to have been *made higher than the
heavens.* It then belongs to Christ alone to conciliate God to us, as he
has ascended above all the heavens. Now, these words mean the same as
though Christ were said to have been placed above all orders of
creatures, so that he stands eminent above all angels.

<span id="xiii.v-p28"></span><span id="xiii.v-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p29"></span>**27.** *Who needeth not,* *etc.* He
pursues the contrast between Christ and the Levitical priests; and he
points out especially two defects, so to speak, in the ancient
priesthood, by which it appears that it was not perfect. And here,
indeed, he only touches briefly on the subject; but he afterwards
explains every particular more at large, and particularly that which
refers to the daily sacrifices, as the main question was respecting
these. It is briefly also that I will now touch on the several points.
One of the defects of the ancient priesthood was, that the high priest
offered sacrifices for his own sins; how then could he have pacified God
for others, who had God justly displeased with himself? Then they were
by no means equal to the work of expiating for sins. The other defect
was, that they offered various sacrifices daily; it hence follows, that
there was no real expiation; for sins remain when purgation is repeated.
The case with Christ was wholly different; for he himself needed no
sacrifice, as he was sprinkled with no spot of sin; and such was the
sacrifice, that it was alone sufficient to the end of the world, for he
offered himself.  <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md)

<span id="xiii.v-p31"></span><span id="xiii.v-p31.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p32"></span>**28.** *For the law,* *etc.* From the
defects of men he draws his conclusion as to the weakness of the
priesthood, as though he had said, “Since the law makes no real priests,
the defect must by some other means be remedied; and it is remedied by
the *word of the oath;* for Christ was made a priest, being not of the
common order of men, but the Son of God, subject to no defect, but
adorned and endowed with the highest perfection.” He again reminds us,
that the *oath* was posterior to the law, in order to show that God,
being not satisfied with the priesthood of the law, designed to
constitute a better priesthood; for in the institutions of God what
succeeds advances the former to a better state, or it abolishes what was
designed to exist only for a time.

<span id="xiii.i-p16"></span> It is not as a king, but as a priest that
Christ is our righteousness. Therefore strictly speaking, as a king, he
administers righteousness, or acts righteously. “The king of
righteousness,” may be rendered, as Stuart does, a righteous king. See
<span id="xiii.i-p16.1"></span>[Ps
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa045.htm#007.md)<span id="xiii.i-p16.1"></span> —

<span id="fn_111"></span>[112](cc44012.htm#fr_111.md) <span
id="xiii.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p22"></span> Some regard what is said of Melchisedec
being without father, etc., as meaning that he was so in his office as a
king and priest, there being no account of a predecessor or of a
successor to him; but this view cannot be taken on account of these
words, “without mother, without descent,” etc., Calvin gives the
explanation commonly received. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[113](cc44012.htm#fr_112.md) <span
id="xiii.i-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p25"></span> Our version “made like,” etc., is objected
to by Stuart; and he renders it, “being like,” alleging that the
Apostle’s object is to show, not that Melchisedec was “made like” to
Christ as a priest, but the contrary, according to <span
id="xiii.i-p25.1"></span>[Ps
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md)<span id="xiii.i-p25.1"></span>.
But the object here seems to be different: he shows why it is that there
is no record of Melchisedec’s office as to its beginning or end; it was
that he might be made a fit type to represent the Son of God. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[114](cc44012.htm#fr_113.md) <span
id="xiii.ii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p26"></span> The words are in the neuter gender, “what
is less blessed by the greater.” This is an idiom; the neuter is put for
the masculine, as πᾶν is used for all men in <span
id="xiii.ii-p26.1"></span>[Joh
6:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#037.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p26.1"></span>,
and πᾶν μωρὰ for foolish men in <span id="xiii.ii-p26.2"></span>[1Co
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#027.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p26.2"></span>.
The meaning is, “the inferior is blessed by his superior.” — *Ed*

<span id="fn_114"></span>[115](cc44012.htm#fr_114.md) <span
id="xiii.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p28"></span> There are three kinds of blessing
mentioned in Scripture, — prayer for a blessing, <span
id="xiii.ii-p28.1"></span>[Mt
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p28.1"></span>;
prophetic blessing, as in the case of the patriarchs, <span
id="xiii.ii-p28.2"></span>[Heb. 11:20](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#021.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p28.2"></span>;
and sacerdotal blessing, as recorded in <span
id="xiii.ii-p28.3"></span>[Nu
6:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023.md)<span
id="xiii.ii-p28.3"></span>. The latter is what is meant here. It was a
blessing announced in the name of the Lord, or a prayer offered in his
name, and by his authority. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[116](cc44012.htm#fr_115.md) <span
id="xiii.ii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p31"></span> Critics often make a difficulty where is
none. The obvious meaning of this verse is given by Calvin, — continual
succession, owing to death, betokened the unenduring character of the
Levitical priesthood; but the perpetuity of that Melchisedec is proved
by this, that he lives. To live often means to be perpetual; and to die
intimates what is evanescent. The Levites were dying men, which showed
the character of their office, Melchisedec is represented as not dying,
which betokens that his office as a priest is perpetual. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_116"></span>[117](cc44012.htm#fr_116.md) <span
id="xiii.ii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p35"></span> Our version is “For he was yet,” etc.,
ἔπι, here is not yet, but even, as in <span
id="xiii.ii-p35.1"></span>[Lu
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#015.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p35.1"></span>,
or then, as rendered by Stuart; “For he was even (or then) in the loins
of his father when Melchisedec met him.” — *Ed*

<span id="fn_117"></span>[118](cc44012.htm#fr_117.md) <span
id="xiii.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p13"></span> The particles Εἰ μὲν οὖν, are rendered
by Elsner, “but if,” — by Doddridge, “now if,” — by Stuart, “moreover
if,” and by Macknight, “moreover, if indeed;” and all these consider
that there is here a commencement from what has preceded. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_118"></span>[119](cc44012.htm#fr_118.md) <span
id="xiii.iii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p15"></span> “Perfection,” or completion, rather than
consummation is no doubt the best word τελείωσις. To render it “perfect
expiation,” as Schleusner does, is not to render the word, but to
explain it. The imperfection of the Levitical priesthood was doubtless
its capacity really to make an atonement for sin, as its work was
ceremonial and typical: but it was enough for the present purpose merely
to say that it was not perfect, as it failed to answer the great end of
establishing a priesthood. And the Apostle grounds its deficiency, or
imperfect character, on the fact that a priest of another order had been
promised. This was an argument which the Jews could not resist, as it
was founded on the Scriptures, which they themselves acknowledged as
divine. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_119"></span>[120](cc44012.htm#fr_119.md) <span
id="xiii.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p17"></span> See Appendix Z.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[121](cc44012.htm#fr_120.md) <span
id="xiii.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p24"></span> Calvin renders “for”, γὰρ, “doubtless —
certe,” and Stuart, “now;” but it may better be rendered here, “for,” as
a reason is given for a change in “the law” respecting the priesthood.
The γὰρ in the former verse may be rendered “indeed,” or “wherefore” as
by Macknight. In the 11th verse, the Apostle proves the imperfection or
defectiveness of the Levitical priesthood, by the promise of another
priest after the order of Melchisedec for Christ was not of the tribe
specified by the Law. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_121"></span>[122](cc44012.htm#fr_121.md) <span
id="xiii.iv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p26"></span> This paragraph extends from the 11th
verse to the end of the 17th. The “law” parenthetically referred to in
the 11th, seems not to be the Mosaic Law generally, as too commonly
supposed, but the law respecting the Levitical priesthood, as it appears
evident from the 12th and the following verses, for what is spoken of is
Christ as being a priest not in succession from Aaron, but according to
the order of Melchisedec. See Appendix A 2. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[123](cc44012.htm#fr_122.md) <span
id="xiii.iv-p33.2"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p34"></span> Calvin is peculiar in his view of this
verse. He considered the Law to be “an introduction to a better hope.”
Many agree with our version, such as Beza, Doddridge, Macknight, Stuart,
etc. But there are those who render “introduction” in connection with
“disannulling.” See Appendix B 2. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[124](cc44012.htm#fr_123.md) <span
id="xiii.v-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p19"></span> Calvin’s version of the former part of the
verse is, “Hence he is also able to save for ever those who through him
draw nigh to God.” Instead of “to the uttermost” of our version, we have
here “forever,” according to the Vulg. Macknight renders the phrase the
same and Stuart “always.” But the original, εἰς τὸ παντελὲς, do not
refer to time, but to what is fully or perfectly done. It is so taken by
Erasmus, Beza, Capellus and Schleusner. There is another difference,
whether to connect the words with “able” or with “save.” Most join them
with “save,” “he is able also fully (or, for ever) able to save.” When
we consider what the subject is — the perfection of Christ as a priest,
and not the character of his salvation. We must see that the latter is
the right view, and that the passage ought to have been thus rendered, —
“And hence he is fully (or perfectly) able to save those who through him
come to God.” And the words which follow may be deemed as affording a
reason for this, “always living in order to intercede for them,” or, “to
interpose in their behalf.”

<span id="xiii.v-p20"></span>However, there is not much difference in
the meaning, whether the word “fully” or perfectly be connected with
“able” or with “save;” the same truth is essentially conveyed. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[125](cc44012.htm#fr_124.md) <span
id="xiii.v-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p25"></span> Christ as a priest was “holy” with regard
to God; “harmless,” or innocent, or guileless, according to Chrysostom,
with respect to men; “undefiled” as to himself, morally so, as the
priests under the law were so ceremonially; “separate,” or separated
“from sinners” removed from their society to another place, and “exalted
higher than the heavens.” There is an allusion to the Levitical high
priest, especially in the three last words, and a contrast in the two
last; the Levitical high priest continued among sinners, Christ is
removed from them; the former entered into the holy of holies, the
latter has entered into a place higher that the heavens, even the
heavens of heavens. How immeasurable is the superiority of our high
priest! — *Ed*.
