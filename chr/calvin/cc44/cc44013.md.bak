<span id="xiv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 8

<span id="xiv.i"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 8:1-6

<span id="xiv.i-p2"></span>**1.** Now of the things which we have spoken
*this is* the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right
hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;

<span id="xiv.i-p3"></span>**1.** Porro eurum quae dicuntur summa est,
Talem habemus pontificem qui consedit in dextera throni majestatis in
coelis;

<span id="xiv.i-p4"></span>**2.** A minister of the sanctuary, and of
the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.

<span id="xiv.i-p5"></span>**2.** Sanctorum minister et tabernaculi veri
quod fixit Dominus et non homo.

<span id="xiv.i-p6"></span>**3.** For every high priest is ordained to
offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore *it is* of necessity that this man
have somewhat also to offer.

<span id="xiv.i-p7"></span>**3.** Omnis enim pontifex ad offerendum dona
et sacrificia constituitur; unde necesse est hunc quoque habere quod
offerat.

<span id="xiv.i-p8"></span>**4.** For if he were on earth, he should not
be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to
the law:

<span id="xiv.i-p9"></span>**4.** Sane si in terra esset, ne pontifex
quidem esset, quamdiu essent sacerdotes qui secundum legem offerrent
dona;

<span id="xiv.i-p10"></span>**5.** Who serve unto the example and shadow
of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to
make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, *that* thou make all things
according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.

<span id="xiv.i-p11"></span>**5.** Qui in exemplari et umbra ministrant
coelestium, quemadmodum oraculo admonitus fuit Moses, quum tabernaculum
esset perfecturus, Vide, inquit, ut facias omnia secundum typum qui tibi
ostensus fuit in monte.

<span id="xiv.i-p12"></span>**6.** But now hath he obtained a more
excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better
covenant, which was established upon better promises.

<span id="xiv.i-p13"></span>**6.** Nunc autem excellentius obtinuit
ministerium, quanto et potioris testamenti Mediator, quod supeer
praestantioiribus promissionibus promulgatum fuit.

<span id="xiv.i-p14"></span> 

<span id="xiv.i-p15"></span><span id="xiv.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p16"></span>**1.** *Now of the things*, *etc.* That
readers might know the subject he handles, he reminds them that his
object is to prove that Christ’s priesthood, by which that of the law
had been abolished, is spiritual. He, indeed, proceeds with the same
argument; but as he contends with various reasonings, he introduced this
admonition, that he might keep his readers attentive to what he had in
view.

<span id="xiv.i-p17"></span>He has already shown that Christ is a high
priest; he now contends that his priesthood is celestial. It hence
follows, that by his coming the priesthood established by Moses under
the law was made void, for it was earthly. and as Christ suffered in the
humble condition of his flesh, and having taken the form of a servant,
made himself of no reputation in the world, (<span
id="xiv.i-p17.1"></span>[Php 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md)<span
id="xiv.i-p17.1"></span>;) the Apostle reminds us of his ascension, by
which was removed not only the reproach of the cross, but also of that
abject and mean condition which he had assumed together with our flesh;
for it is by the power of the Spirit which gloriously appeared in the
resurrection and the ascension of Christ, that the dignity of his
priesthood is to be estimated. He then reasons thus — “Since Christ has
ascended to the right hand of God, that he might reign gloriously in
heaven, he is not the minister of the earthly but of the heavenly
sanctuary.  <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md)

<span id="xiv.i-p19"></span><span id="xiv.i-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p20"></span>**2.** *Of the sanctuary,* or, literally,
*of holy things, etc.* The word is to be taken, as being in the neuter
gender; and the Apostle explains himself by saying, *of the true
tabernacle.*  <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md)

<span id="xiv.i-p23"></span>But it may be asked, whether the tabernacle
built by Moses was a false one, and presumptuously constructed, for
there is an implied contrast in the words? To this I answer, that to us
mentioned here is not set in opposition to what is false, but only to
what is typical; as we find in <span id="xiv.i-p23.1"></span>[Joh
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#017.md)<span id="xiv.i-p23.1"></span>,
“The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.”
Then the old tabernacle was not the empty inventions of man, but the
effigy of the heavenly tabernacle. As, however, a shadow differs from
the substance, and the sign from the thing signified, the Apostle denies
it to have been the true tabernacle, as though he had said, that it was
only a shadow.

<span id="xiv.i-p24"></span>*Which the Lord pitched,* or, *fixed, etc.*
What does the Apostle mean by locating Christ’s priesthood in heaven?
For doubtless he suffered on earth, and by an earthly blood he atoned
for our sins, for he derived his origin from the seed of Abraham; the
sacrifice of his death was visible; and lastly, that he might offer
himself to the Father, it was necessary for him to descend from heaven
to the earth, and as man to become exposed to the sorrows of this mortal
life, and at length to death itself. To all this I reply, that whatever
of an earthly kind appears at first sight to be in Christ, it is to be
viewed spiritually by the eye of faith. Thus his flesh, which proceeded
from the seed of Abraham, since it was the temple of God, possessed a
vivifying power; yea, the death of Christ became the life of the world,
which is certainly above nature. The Apostle therefore does not refer to
what belongs peculiarly to human nature, but to the hidden power of the
Spirit; and hence it is, that the death of Christ has nothing earthly in
it. When therefore we speak of Christ, let us learn to raise up all our
thoughts to the kingdom of God, so that no doubt may remain in us.

<span id="xiv.i-p25"></span>Nearly to the same purpose is the language
of Paul in <span id="xiv.i-p25.1"></span>[2Co
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md)<span id="xiv.i-p25.1"></span>; he
calls God the builder of this tabernacle, in order to set forth its
stability and perpetuity; for, on the other hand, what is built by men’s
hands, is unstable, and at last sure to perish. But he says this,
because redemption was truly a divine work, attained by the death of
Christ; and in this the power of Christ manifested itself in a wonderful
manner.

<span id="xiv.i-p26"></span><span id="xiv.i-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p27"></span>**3.** *For every high priest,* *etc.* The
Apostle intends to show, that Christ’s priesthood cannot coexist with
the Levitical priesthood. He proves it in this way, — “The Law appointed
priests to offer sacrifices to God; it hence appears that the priesthood
is an empty name without a sacrifice. But Christ had no sacrifice, such
as was offered under the Law; it hence follows, that his priesthood is
not earthly or carnal, but one of a more excellent character.”

<span id="xiv.i-p28"></span>Let us now examine every clause. The first
thing that deserves notice, is that which he teaches that no priest is
appointed except to offer gifts; it is hence evident, that no favor from
God can be obtained for men except through the interposition of a
sacrifice. Hence, that our prayers may be heard, they must be founded on
a sacrifice; their audacity, therefore, is altogether pernicious and
fatal, who pass by Christ and forget his death, and yet rush into the
presence of God. Now, if we wish to pray in a profitable manner, we must
learn ever to set before us the death of Christ, which alone sanctifies
our prayers. For God will never hear us unless he is reconciled; but he
must be first pacified, for our sins cause him to be displeased with us.
Sacrifice must necessarily precede, in order that there may be any
benefit from prayer.

<span id="xiv.i-p29"></span>We may hence further conclude, that no one
either among men or angels is qualified for pacifying God, for all are
without any sacrifice of their own which they can offer to appease God.
And hereby is abundantly exposed the effrontery of the Papists who make
Apostles and martyrs to share with Christ as mediators in the work of
intercession; for in vain do they assign them such an office, except
they supply them with sacrifices.  <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md)

<span id="xiv.i-p31"></span><span id="xiv.i-p31.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p32"></span>**4.** *For if he were on earth,* *etc.* It
is now beyond dispute that Christ is a high priest; but as the office of
a judge does not exist without laws and statutes, so the office of
sacrificing must be connected with Christ as a priest: yet he has no
earthly or visible sacrifice; he cannot then be a priest on earth. We
must always hold this truth that when the Apostle speaks of the death of
Christ, he regards not the external action, but the spiritual benefit.
He suffered death as men do, but as a priest he atoned for the sins of
the world in a divine manner; there was an external shedding of blood,
but there was also an internal and spiritual purgation; in a word, he
died on earth, but the virtue and efficacy of his death proceeded from
heaven.

<span id="xiv.i-p33"></span>What immediately follows some render thus,
“He could not be a priest of the number of those who offer gifts
according to the Law.” But the words of the Apostle mean another thing;
and therefore I prefer this rendering, “He could not be a priest as long
as there are priests who,” etc. For he intends to show one of these two
things, either that Christ is no priest, while the priesthood of the Law
continued, as he had no sacrifice, or that the sacrifices of the law
ceased as soon as Christ appeared. The first of these is against all
reason, for it is an act of impiety to deprive Christ of his priesthood.
It then remains for us to confess, that the Levitical order is now
abolished.

<span id="xiv.i-p34"></span><span id="xiv.i-p34.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p35"></span>**5.** *Who serve unto the example,* *etc.*
The verb λατρεύειν to serve, I take here to mean the performing of
sacred rites; and so ἐν or ἐπὶ is to be understood. This is certainly
more appropriate than the rendering given by some, “Who serve the shadow
and example of heavenly things; and the construction in Greek will admit
naturally of the meaning I have proposed. In short, he teaches us that
the true worship of God consists not in the ceremonies of the Law, and
that hence the Levitical priests, while exercising their functions, had
nothing but a shadow and a copy, which is inferior to the prototype, for
this is the meaning of the word ὑποδείγμα, exemplar. And he thus
anticipates what might have been raised as an objection; for he shows
that the worship of God, according to the ancient sacrifices, was not
superfluous, because it referred to what was higher, even to heavenly
realities.  <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md)

<span id="xiv.i-p38"></span>*As Moses was admonished by God,* *etc.*
This passage is found in <span id="xiv.i-p38.1"></span>[Ex
25:40](../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#040.md)<span id="xiv.i-p38.1"></span>;
and the apostle adduces it here on purpose, so that he might prove that
the whole service, according to the Law, was nothing more than a picture
as it were, designed to shadow forth what is found spiritually in
Christ. God commanded that all the parts of the tabernacle should
correspond with the original pattern, which had been shown to Moses on
the mount. And if the form of the tabernacle had a reference to
something else, then the same must have been the case as to the rituals
and the priesthood; it hence follows that there was nothing real in
them.

<span id="xiv.i-p39"></span>This is a remarkable passage, for it
contains three things entitled to special notice.

<span id="xiv.i-p40"></span>First, we hence learn that the ancient
rituals were not without reason appointed, as though God did by them
engage the attention of the people as with the diversions of children;
and that the form of the tabernacle was not an empty thing, intended
only to allure and attract the eyes by its external splendor; for there
was a real and spiritual meaning in all these things, since Moses was
commanded to execute every thing according to the original pattern which
was given from heaven. Extremely profane then must the opinion of those
be, who hold that the ceremonies were only enjoined that they might
serve as means to restrain the wantonness of the people, that they might
not seek after the foreign rites of heathens. There is indeed something
in this, but it is far from being all; they omit what is much more
important, that they were the means of retaining the people in their
expectation of a Mediator.

<span id="xiv.i-p41"></span>There is, however, no reason that we should
be here overcurious, so as to seek in every nail and minute things some
sublime mystery, as Hesychius did and many of the ancient writers, who
anxiously toiled in this work; for while they sought refinedly to
philosophize on things unknown to them, they childishly blundered, and
by their foolish trifling made themselves ridiculous. We ought therefore
to exercise moderation in this respect, which we shall do if we seek
only to know what has been revealed to us respecting Christ.

<span id="xiv.i-p42"></span>Secondly, we are here taught that all those
modes of worship are false and spurious, which men allow themselves by
their own wit to invent, and beyond God’s command; for since God gives
this direction, that all things are to be done according to his own
rule, it is not lawful for us to do anything different from it; for
these two forms of expression, “see that thou do all things according to
the patterns,” and, “See that thou do nothing beyond the pattern,”
amount to the same thing. Then by enforcing the rule delivered by
himself, he prohibits us to depart from it even in the least thing. For
this reason all the modes of worship taught by men fall to the ground,
and also those things called sacraments which have not proceeded from
God.

<span id="xiv.i-p43"></span>Thirdly, let us hence learn that there are
no true symbols of religion but those which conform to what Christ
requires. We must then take heed, lest we, while seeking to adapt our
own inventions to Christ, transfigure him, as the Papists do, so that he
should not be at all like himself; for it does not belong to us to
devise anything as we please, but to God alone it belongs to show us
what to do; it is to be “according to the pattern” showed to us.

<span id="xiv.i-p44"></span><span id="xiv.i-p44.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p45"></span>**6.** *But now has he obtained a more
excellent ministry,* *etc.* As he had before inferred the excellency of
the covenant from the dignity of the priesthood, so also now he
maintains that Christ’s priesthood is more excellent than that of Aaron,
because he is the interpreter and Mediator of a better covenant. Both
were necessary, for the Jews were to be led away from the superstitious
observance of rituals, by which they were prevented from advancing
directly forward to the attainment of the real and pure truth of the
Gospel. The Apostle says now that it was but right that Moses and Aaron
should give way to Christ as to one more excellent, because the gospel
is a more excellent covenant than the Law, and also because the death of
Christ was a nobler sacrifice than the victims under the Law.

<span id="xiv.i-p46"></span>But what he adds is not without some
difficulty, — that the covenant of the Gospel was proclaimed on better
promises;  <span id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) for it is certain
that the fathers who lived under the Law had the same hope of eternal
life set before them as we have, as they had the grace of adoption in
common with us, then faith must have rested on the same promises. But
the comparison made by the Apostle refers to the form rather than to the
substance; for though God promised to them the same salvation which he
at this day promises to us, yet neither the manner nor the character of
the revelation is the same or equal to what we enjoy. If anyone wishes
to know more on this subject, let him read the 4th and 5th chapter of
the Epistle to the Galatians and my Institutes.

<span id="xiv.ii"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p1"></span>Hebrews Chapter 8:7-13

<span id="xiv.ii-p2"></span>**7.** For if that first *covenant* had been
faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.

<span id="xiv.ii-p3"></span>**7.** Si enim primum ellud reprehensione
caruisset, non fuisset secundo quaesitus locus.

<span id="xiv.ii-p4"></span>**8.** For finding fault with them, he
saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new
covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:

<span id="xiv.ii-p5"></span>**8.** Porro incusans eos, dicit, Ecce dies
veniunt, dicit Dominus, quum perficiam super domum Israel, et super
domum Juda foedus novum:

<span id="xiv.ii-p6"></span>**9.** Not according to the covenant that I
made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead
them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my
covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.

<span id="xiv.ii-p7"></span>**9.** Non secundum foedus quod feci cum
patribus eorum in die, quo apprehendi manum eorum, ut educerem eos e
terra, Aegypti, quai ipsi non perstiterunt in foedere meo, et ego
neglexi eos, dicit Dominus.

<span id="xiv.ii-p8"></span>**10.** For this *is* the covenant that I
will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I
will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I
will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:

<span id="xiv.ii-p9"></span>**10.** Quia hoc est foedus quod disponam
domui Israel illus diebus, dicit Dominus, Ponam leges meas in mente
ipsorum, et in cordibus eorum scribam eos; et ero illis in deum et ipsi
erunt mihi in populum:

<span id="xiv.ii-p10"></span>**11.** And they shall not teach every man
his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all
shall know me, from the least to the greatest.

<span id="xiv.ii-p11"></span>**11.** Et non docebunt unusquisque civem
suum et unusquisque fratrem suum, dicendo, Cognosce Dominum; quia omnes
me scient a parvo inter vos usque ad magnum.

<span id="xiv.ii-p12"></span>**12.** For I will be merciful to their
unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no
more.

<span id="xiv.ii-p13"></span>**12.** Quoniam propitius ero injustitiis,
et peccatorum eorum et iniquitatum non recordabor amplius.

<span id="xiv.ii-p14"></span>**13.** In that he saith, A new *covenant*,
he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old *is*
ready to vanish away.

<span id="xiv.ii-p15"></span>**13.** Dicende novum antiquavit prius;
quod autem antiquatur et veterascit prope est ut evanescat.

<span id="xiv.ii-p16"></span> 

<span id="xiv.ii-p17"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p18"></span>**7.** *For if that first,* *etc.* He
confirms what he had said of the excellency of the covenant which God
has made with us through Christ; and he confirms it on this ground,
because the covenant of the Law was neither valid nor permanent; for if
nothing was wanting in it, why was another substituted for it? But
another has been substituted; and from this it is evident that the old
covenant was not in every respect perfect. To prove this he adduces the
testimony of Jeremiah, which we shall presently examine.

<span id="xiv.ii-p19"></span>But it seems hardly consistent to say, that
after having said that no place would have been sought for the second
covenant, had the first been faultless, he should then say that the
people were at fault, and that for this cause the new covenant was
introduced as a remedy; and thus it appears unjust, that if the blame
was in the people it should be transferred to God’s covenant. Then the
argument seems not valid, for though God might have a hundred times
blamed the people, yet the covenant could not on that account be deemed
faulty. The answer to this objection may be easily given. Though the
crime of violating the covenant was justly imputed to the people, who
had through their own perfidy departed from God, yet the weakness of the
covenant is also pointed out, because it was not written in their
hearts. Then, to render it perfect and valid, God declares that it
needed an amendment. It was not, therefore, without reason that the
Apostle contended that a place was to be sought for a second.  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md)

<span id="xiv.ii-p21"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p22"></span>**8.** *Behold, the days come,* *etc.*
(<span id="xiv.ii-p22.1"></span>[Jer
31:31-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md)<span
id="xiv.ii-p22.1"></span>.) The Prophet speaks of future time; he
arraigns the people of perfidy, because they continued not faithful
after having received the Law. The Law, then, was the covenant which was
broken, as God complains, by the people. To remedy this evil, he
promised a new and a different covenant, the fulfillment of which
prophecy was the abrogation of the old covenant.

<span id="xiv.ii-p23"></span>But it may be said, the Apostle seems
unreasonably to turn this prophecy to suit his own purpose; for here the
question is respecting ceremonies, but the Prophet speaks of the whole
Law: what has it to do with ceremonies, when God inscribes on the heart
the rule of a godly and holy life, delivered by the voice and teaching
of men? To this I reply that the argument is applied from the whole to a
part. There is no doubt but that the Prophet includes the whole
dispensation of Moses when he says, “I have made with you a covenant
which you have not kept.” Besides, the Law was in a manner clothed with
ceremonies; now when the body is dead, what is the use of garments? It
is a common saying that the accessory is of the same character with his
principal. No wonder, then, that the ceremonies, which are nothing more
than appendages to the old covenant, should come to an end, together
with the whole dispensation of Moses. Nor is it unusual with the
Apostles, when they speak of ceremonies, to discuss the general question
respecting the whole Law. Though, then, the prophet Jeremiah extends
wider than to ceremonies, yet as it includes them under the name of the
old covenant, it may be fitly applied to the present subject.

<span id="xiv.ii-p24"></span>Now, by the *days* which the prophet
mentions, all agree that Christ’s kingdom is signified; it hence
follows, that the old covenant was changed by the coming of Christ. And
he names *the house of Israel and the house of Judah,* because the
posterity of Abraham had been divided into two kingdoms. So the promise
is to gather again all the elect together into one body, however
separated they may have been formerly.

<span id="xiv.ii-p25"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p26"></span>**9.** *Not according to the covenant,*
*etc.* Here is expressed the difference between the covenant which then
existed and the new one which he caused them to expect. The Prophet
might have otherwise said only: “I will renew the covenant which through
your fault has come to nothing;” but he now expressly declares that it
would be one unlike the former. By saying that the covenant was made in
the day when he laid holds on their hand to rescue them from bondage, he
enhanced the sin of defection by thus reminding them of so great a
benefit. At the same time he did not accuse one age only of ingratitude;
but as these very men who had been delivered immediately fell away, and
as their posterity after their example continually relapsed, hence the
whole nation had become covenant­breakers.

<span id="xiv.ii-p27"></span>By saying that he *disregarded* them or
cared not for them, he intimates that it would profit them nothing to
have been once adopted as his people, unless he succored them by this
new kind of remedy. At the same time the Prophet expresses in Hebrew
something more; but this has little to do with the present question.
 <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md)

<span id="xiv.ii-p29"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p30"></span>**10** *For this is the covenant that I
will make,* *etc.* There are two main parts in this covenant; the first
regards the gratuitous remission of sins; and the other, the inward
renovation of the heart; there is a third which depends on the second,
and that is the illumination of the mind as to the knowledge of God.
There are here many things most deserving of notice.

<span id="xiv.ii-p31"></span>The first is, that God calls us to himself
without effect as long as he speaks to us in no other way than by the
voice of man. He indeed teaches us and commands what is right but he
speaks to the deaf; for when we seem to hear anything, our ears are only
struck by an empty sound; and the heart, full of depravity and
perverseness, rejects every wholesome doctrine. In short, the word of
God never penetrates into our hearts, for they are iron and stone until
they are softened by him; nay, they have engraven on them a contrary
law, for perverse passions rule within, which lead us to rebellion. In
vain then does God proclaim his Law by the voice of man, unless he
writes it by his Spirit on our hearts, that is, unless he forms and
prepares us for obedience. It hence appears of what avail is freewill
and the uprightness of nature before God regenerates us. We will indeed
and choose freely; but our will is carried away by a sort of insane
impulse to resist God. Thus it comes that the Law is ruinous and fatal
to us as long as it remains written only on tables of stone, as Paul
also teaches us. (<span id="xiv.ii-p31.1"></span>[2Co
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#003)<span id="xiv.ii-p31.1"></span>..md)
In short, we then only obediently embrace what God commands, when by his
Spirit he changes and corrects the natural pravity of our hearts;
otherwise he finds nothing in us but corrupt affections and a heart
wholly given up to evil. The declaration indeed is clear, that a new
covenant is made according to which God engraves his laws on our hearts,
for otherwise it would be in vain and of no effect.  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md)

<span id="xiv.ii-p33"></span>The second particular refers to the
gratuitous pardon of sins. Though they have sinned, saith the Lord, yet
I will pardon them. This part is also most necessary; for God never so
forms us for obedience to his righteousness, but that many corrupt
affections of the flesh still remain; nay, it is only in part that the
viciousness of our nature is corrected; so that evil lusts break out now
and then. And hence is that contest of which Paul complains, when the
godly do not obey God as they ought, but in various ways offend. (<span
id="xiv.ii-p33.1"></span>[Ro 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013.md)<span
id="xiv.ii-p33.1"></span>.) Whatever desire then there may be in us to
live righteously, we are still guilty of eternal death before God,
because our life is ever very far from the perfection which the Law
requires. There would then be no stability in the covenant, except God
gratuitously forgave our sins. But it is the peculiar privilege of the
faithful who have once embraced the covenant offered to them in Christ,
that they feel assured that God is propitious to them; nor is the sin to
which they are liable, a hindrance to them, for they have the promise of
pardon.

<span id="xiv.ii-p34"></span>And it must be observed that this pardon is
promised to them, not for one day only, but to the very end of life, so
that they have a daily reconciliation with God. For this favor is
extended to the whole of Christ’s kingdom, as Paul abundantly proves in
the fifth chapter of his second Epistle to the Corinthians. And
doubtless this is the only true asylum of our faith, to which if we flee
not, constant despair must be our lot. For we are all of us guilty; nor
can we be otherwise released then by fleeing to God’s mercy, which alone
can pardon us.

<span id="xiv.ii-p35"></span>*And they shall be to me,* *etc.* It is the
fruit of the covenant, that God chooses us for his people, and assures
us that he will be the guardian of our salvation. This is indeed the
meaning of these words, *And I will be to them a God;* for he is not the
God of the dead, nor does he take us under his protection, but that he
may make us partakers of righteousness and of life, so that David justly
exclaims, “Blessed are the people to whom the Lord is God (<span
id="xiv.ii-p35.1"></span>[Ps
144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015.md)<span
id="xiv.ii-p35.1"></span>.) There is further no doubt but that this
truth belongs also to us; for though the Israelites had the first place,
and are the proper and legitimate heirs of the covenant, yet their
prerogative does not hinder us from having also a title to it. In short,
however far and wide the kingdom of Christ extends, this covenant of
salvation is of the same extent.

<span id="xiv.ii-p36"></span>But it may be asked, whether there was
under the Law a sure and certain promise of salvation, whether the
fathers had the gift of the Spirit, whether they enjoyed God’s paternal
favor through the remission of sins? Yes, it is evident that they
worshipped God with a sincere heart and a pure conscience, and that they
walked in his commandments, and this could not have been the case except
they had been inwardly taught by the Spirit; and it is also evident,
that whenever they thought of their sins, they were raised up by the
assurance of a gratuitous pardon. And yet the Apostle, by referring the
prophecy of Jeremiah to the coming of Christ, seems to rob them of these
blessings. To this I reply, that he does not expressly deny that God
formerly wrote his Law on their hearts and pardoned their sins, but he
makes a comparison between the less and the greater. As then the Father
has put forth more fully the power of his Spirit under the kingdom of
Christ, and has poured forth more abundantly his mercy on mankind, this
exuberance renders insignificant the small portion of grace which he had
been pleased to bestow on the fathers. We also see that the promises
were then obscure and intricate, so that they shone only like the moon
and stars in comparison with the clear light of the Gospel which shines
brightly on us.

<span id="xiv.ii-p37"></span>If it be objected and said, that the faith
and obedience of Abraham so excelled, that hardly any such an example
can at this day be found in the whole world; my answer is this, that the
question here is not about persons, but that reference is made to the
economical condition of the Church. Besides, whatever spiritual gifts
the fathers obtained, they were accidental as it were to their age; for
it was necessary for them to direct their eyes to Christ in order to
become possessed of them. Hence it was not without reason that the
Apostle, in comparing the Gospel with the Law, took away from the latter
what is peculiar to the former. There is yet no reason why God should
not have extended the grace of the new covenant to the fathers. This is
the true solution of the question.

<span id="xiv.ii-p38"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p39"></span>**11.** *And they shall not teach,* *etc.*
We have said that the third point is as it were a part of the second,
included in these words, *I will put my laws in their mind*; for it is
the work of the Spirit of God to illuminate our minds, so that we may
know what the will of God is, and also to bend our hearts to obedience.
For the right knowledge of God is a wisdom which far surpasses the
comprehension of man’s understanding; therefore, to attain it no one is
able except through the secret revelation of the Spirit. Hence Isaiah,
in speaking of the restoration of the Church, says, that all God’s
children would be his disciples or scholars. (<span
id="xiv.ii-p39.1"></span>[Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016)<span id="xiv.ii-p39.1"></span>..md)
The meaning of our Prophet is the same when he introduces God as saying,
*They shall know me.* For God does not promise what is in our own power,
but what he alone can perform for us. In short, these words of the
Prophet are the same as though he had said, that our minds are blind and
destitute of all right understanding until they are illuminated by the
Spirit of God. Thus God is rightly known by those alone to whom he has
been pleased by a special favor to reveal himself.

<span id="xiv.ii-p40"></span>By saying, *From the least to the
greatest,* he first intimates that God’s grace would be poured on all
ranks of men, so that no class would be without it. He, secondly,
reminds us that no rude and ignorant men are precluded from this
heavenly wisdom, and that the great and the noble cannot attain it by
their own acuteness or by the help of learning. Thus God connects the
meanest and the lowest with the highest, so that their ignorance is no
impediment to the one, nor can the other ascend so high by their own
acumen; but the one Spirit is equally the teacher of them all.

<span id="xiv.ii-p41"></span>Fanatical men take hence the occasion to do
away with public preaching, as though it were of no use in Christ’s
kingdom; but their madness may be easily exposed. Their objection is
this: “After the coming of Christ every one is to teach his neighbor;
away then with the external ministry, that a place may be given to the
internal inspiration of God.” But they pass by this, that the Prophet
does not wholly deny that they would teach one another, but his words
are these, *They shall not teach, saying, Know the Lord;* as though he
had said, “Ignorance shall not as heretofore so possess the minds of men
as not to know who God is.” But we know that the use of teaching is
twofold; first, that they who are wholly ignorant may learn the first
elements; and secondly, that those who are initiated may make progress.
As then Christians, as long as they live, ought to make progress, it
cannot surely be said, that any one is so wise that he needs not to be
taught; so that no small part of our wisdom is a teachable spirit. And
what is the way of making progress if we desire to be the disciples of
Christ? This is shown to us by Paul when he says, that Christ gave
pastors and teachers. (<span id="xiv.ii-p41.1"></span>[Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011)<span id="xiv.ii-p41.1"></span>..md)
It hence appears that nothing less was thought of by the Prophet than to
rob the Church of such a benefit.  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) His only object was to show that God
would make himself known to small and great, according to what was also
predicted by <span id="xiv.ii-p42.1"></span>[Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md)<span id="xiv.ii-p42.1"></span>.
It ought also in passing to be noticed, that this light of sacred
knowledge is promised peculiarly to the Church; hence this passage
belongs to none but to the household of faith.  <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md)

<span id="xiv.ii-p44"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p44.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p45"></span>**13.** *In that he saith, A new,* *etc.*
From the fact of one covenant being established, he infers the
subversion of the other; and by calling it the old covenant, he assumes
that it was to be abrogated; for what is old tends to a decay.  <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) Besides, as the new is substituted, it
must be that the former has come to an end; for the second, as it has
been said, is of another character. But if the whole dispensation of
Moses, as far as it was opposed to the dispensation of Christ, has
passed away, then the ceremonies also must have ceased.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[127](cc44013.htm#fr_126.md) <span
id="xiv.i-p17.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p18"></span> See Appendix D 2.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[128](cc44013.htm#fr_127.md) <span
id="xiv.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p21"></span> It is better to take “holy things” as
designating the holy duties of the priest, afterwards specified when the
offering of gifts and sacrifices is mentioned, than as signifying “the
sanctuary.” Christ is a priest and a minister in sacred things, and a
minister in the true tabernacle. He has holy things to do, and he does
them, not in the shadowy and typical tabernacle, but in that which is
real and celestial.

<span id="xiv.i-p22"></span>We find, that the word in the next chapter
means the holiest place, accompanied as here with the article, <span
id="xiv.i-p22.1"></span>[Heb
9:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#008.md)<span id="xiv.i-p22.1"></span>,
and without the article, the holy place or the sanctuary, <span
id="xiv.i-p22.2"></span>[Heb 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#002.md)<span
id="xiv.i-p22.2"></span>. So then if this meaning be taken, the
rendering here ought to be, “the minister of the holiest;” and then
“tabernacle” is used as including the whole building, as in chapter 9:2.
But the context here seems to favor the former meaning. The version of
Doddridge is, “A minister of holy things.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[129](cc44013.htm#fr_128.md) <span
id="xiv.i-p29.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p30"></span> “This man” of our version, in the latter
clause of the verse, should be either “he,” or “this high priest,” in
contrast with the high priest at the beginning of the verse. Such is the
rendering of Macknight and Stuart. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[130](cc44013.htm#fr_129.md) <span
id="xiv.i-p35.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p36"></span> Our version of this clause is hardly
intelligible. Calvin’s rendering with a little addition would convey a
clear meaning. “Who do service in that which is the exemplar and shadow
of celestial things.” Stuart considers “tabernacle” as being understood.
We have the words, “who serve the tabernacle,” in <span
id="xiv.i-p36.1"></span>[Heb
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md)<span id="xiv.i-p36.1"></span>,
that is, “who do the service belonging to the tabernacle,” or, “who
attend on the tabernacle.” So the literal rendering here is, “who serve
the model and shadow of celestial things,” which means, “who do the
service belonging to the model and shadows of celestial things.” The
tabernacle no doubt is what is meant; and it is called a “model,” or
likeness, because it emblematically represented, or exhibited things
heavenly, and a “shadow,” because it was not the substance or the
reality. Stuart seems to have unwisely combined the two words, “a mere
copy;” for the two ideas they convey are not thus so clearly seen.

<span id="xiv.i-p37"></span>But to “serve,” or to do service, includes
what was done by the people as well as by the priests. Those who offered
the sacrifices, as well as the priests through whom they offered the
sacrifices, or performed the services belonging to the tabernacle; the
latter are meant here, and the former or both in <span
id="xiv.i-p37.1"></span>[Heb. 10:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#002.md),
[Heb. 13:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#010.md)<span
id="xiv.i-p37.1"></span>. To serve the Lord, and to offer sacrifices to
him, are in Exodus represented as the same; see <span
id="xiv.i-p37.2"></span>[Exod. 8:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo008.htm#001.md),
[Exod. 10:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#007.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#026.md)<span id="xiv.i-p37.2"></span>. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[131](cc44013.htm#fr_130.md) <span
id="xiv.i-p46.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p47"></span> Instead of “proclaimed,” it is
“established” in our version, and in that of Doddridge, and Macknight,
and of Stuart, “sanctioned.” The verb means what is set as a law; that
is, firmly and irrevocably fixed. It was a covenant firmly set or
founded on more excellent promises. What these are, we learn in the
following verses.

<span id="xiv.i-p48"></span>This verse is connected with the fourth; and
the fifth is to be put in a parenthesis. The reasoning is, — Though he
is no priest on earth, yet he has a higher ministry, inasmuch as the
covenant of which he is the Mediator is far superior to that of priests
on earth; that is, the Levitical priests. Then he proceeds to the end of
the chapter with the covenant, and shows its superiority. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[132](cc44013.htm#fr_131.md) <span
id="xiv.ii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p20"></span> This apparent inconsistency is avoided by
some by rendering the 8th verse differently, “But finding fault,” that
is, with the first covenant, “he” Chrysostom, Beza, Doddridge, our own
version, as well as Calvin and the Vulgate, connect “them” with “finding
fault with,” and more correctly too; for the Israelites are blamed in
the very passage that is quoted. There was a double fault or defect,
which is explained in <span id="xiv.ii-p20.1"></span>[Ro
8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md)<span id="xiv.ii-p20.1"></span>,
“For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,”
etc. This double fault or weakness more fully sets forth the excellency
of the new covenant. —*Ed*.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[133](cc44013.htm#fr_132.md) <span
id="xiv.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p28"></span> See Appendix E 2.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[134](cc44013.htm#fr_133.md) <span
id="xiv.ii-p31.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p32"></span> The Apostle adopts here the Septuagint
version. The Hebrew is “I will put my law in their inmost part, and on
their heart will I write (or engrave) it.” The word “law” and “heart”,
are put here in the plural number, and the “inmost part” is rendered
“mind.” These changes are according to the peculiar character of the two
languages. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[135](cc44013.htm#fr_134.md) <span
id="xiv.ii-p41.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p42"></span> It is a sufficient answer to the fanatics
here alluded to, that their conclusion from his text militates against
the practice of the apostolic Church as established by Christ himself,
he having sent apostles, evangelists, pastors and teachers. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[136](cc44013.htm#fr_135.md) <span
id="xiv.ii-p42.2"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p43"></span> The 12th verse is passed over. It differs
in words, though not in substance, both from the Hebrew and the Sept. It
is indeed the latter version with the addition of these words, “and
their iniquities.” The nouns are in the singular number in Hebrew,
“unrighteousness” and “sin.” When the Apostle quotes again the passage
in <span id="xiv.ii-p43.1"></span>[Heb
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#017.md)<span id="xiv.ii-p43.1"></span>,
he leaves out “unrighteousness,” and mentions only “sins and
iniquities.” There is also a shade of difference as to the first verb.
In Hebrew remission or forgiveness is its meaning, but here the idea is
mercy. The Apostle no doubt considered that the truth was essentially
conveyed in the Greek version. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[137](cc44013.htm#fr_136.md) <span
id="xiv.ii-p45.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p46"></span> This verse may be thus rendered, —

<span id="xiv.ii-p47"></span>“By saying, ‘a new covenant,’ he has made
ancient the first: now what is ancient and becomes old is nigh a
dissolution (or disappearing.)”

<span id="xiv.ii-p48"></span>It is said to be ancient in contrast with
the new; and old or aged is afterwards added to be ancient in order to
show its weak and feeble character, being like an old man tottering on
the brink of the grave, who, when buried, disappears from among the
living. It is supposed that there is here an intimation of the
dissolution of the whole Jewish polity, which soon afterwards took
place. — *Ed*.
