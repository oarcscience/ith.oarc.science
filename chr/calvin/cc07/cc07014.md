Israel *for* a possession according to their divisions;

in campo Libani, usque ad montem Laevem qui assurgit in Seir, et

<span id="xv.i-p51"></span><span id="xv.i-p51.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p52"></span>**1.** *NOW these are the kings,* etc This
chapter does not need a lengthened exposition, as it only enumerates the
kings of whose territories the Israelites gained possession. Two of them
are beyond the Jordan, Og and Sihon, whose rule was extensive; in the
land of Canaan there are thirty-one. But though each of those now
summarily mentioned was previously given more in detail, there is very
good reason for here placing before our eyes as it were a living picture
of the goodness of God, proving that there had been a complete
ratification and performance of the covenant made with Abraham as given
in the words, “Unto thy seed will I give this land.” (<span
id="xv.i-p52.1"></span>[Ge 12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007)<span
id="xv.i-p52.1"></span>; <span id="xv.i-p52.2"></span>[Ge
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#015)<span id="xv.i-p52.2"></span>;
<span id="xv.i-p52.3"></span>[Ge
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018)<span id="xv.i-p52.3"></span>)
This living image of the grace of God is here set before us as if the
reality were actually present.  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122)
Joshua was eighty years of age when he entered the land. In this aged
man how could there be so much vigor  <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123) as to fit him for carrying on so many
wars and enduring the fatigues of warfare, had not celestial virtue
furnished him with more than mortal strength? And were not his
uninterrupted career of victory, his success under all circumstances,
the ease, free from doubt and uncertainty, with which he stormed cities,
the rapidity of his movements, and his inflexible firmness — were not
all these clear evidences of the hand of God, just as if it had appeared
from heaven?

<span id="xv.i-p55"></span>The object of defining the countries by their
boundaries was to give a better display of the divine power by setting
forth their extent; but this of course was only for those to whom their
site was known. Hence, for any one not acquainted with the geography to
dwell upon the names, would be vain and foolish curiosity. I admit,
indeed, that it is useful to pay attention to the places with which,
from their being often mentioned in Scripture, our knowledge ought to be
somewhat more familiar, as when the boundaries are fixed by the brook
Jabok, in the district of Lebanon and the lake of Gennesaret, here
called the Sea of Cineroth, and elsewhere Cinereth. For a slight
attention will help us to understand the narrative. If we cannot go
farther, let us leave those who are better skilled to give a more
searching discussion of what is beyond our reach.  <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124) But although the dominions of these
petty kings were narrow and not very populous, we shall however see that
many towns were annexed to their principal cities; their number may be
ascertained especially from what is said of the lot of the Levites. On
the other hand, if we reflect how one small territory could receive and
maintain old men, women, and children, nay, a great part of the people
with their domestic animals, we cannot fail to admire the inestimable
goodness of God which prevented all things from being thrown into
complete and irremediable confusion.  <span

<span id="xv.i-p53"></span> Latin, “<span id="xv.i-p53.1"></span>Quam si
nos Deus in rem praesentem adduceret.” French, “<span
id="xv.i-p53.2"></span>Comme si Dieu nous mettoit presentement sur le
faict, pour nous faire voire la chose de nos yeux;” “As if God were
putting us actually upon the spot to make us see the thing with our own
eyes.” — *Ed.*

<span id="xv.i-p54"></span> French, “<span

<span id="xv.i-p56"></span> It is evident from these remarks, that
though in some other passages Calvin seems to speak rather disparagingly
of the elucidation which the Scripture narrative may receive from
geography, he did not so much underrate its importance as lament its
imperfection at the period when he wrote. All complaint on this head has
now been happily removed; and it may safely be affirmed, that nothing
has done more to clear up obscurities in the Sacred Volume and
triumphantly establish its strict and literal accuracy, then the labors
and discoveries of recent travelers.

<span id="xv.i-p57"></span> Latin, “<span id="xv.i-p57.1"></span>Ne
horribili confusione, omnia miscerentur.” French, “<span
id="xv.i-p57.2"></span>Que tout ne vint a estre brouille pesle mesle
d’une confusion horrible;” “That every thing was not hurled pell-mell
into horrible confusion.” — *Ed.*
