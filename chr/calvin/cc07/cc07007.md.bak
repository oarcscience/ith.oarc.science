<span id="viii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 5

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
5:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And it came to pass, when all the
kings of the Amorites, which *were* on the side of Jordan westward, and
all the kings of the Canaanites, which *were* by the sea, heard that the
LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of
Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was
there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Fuit autem quum audissent omnes reges
Aemorrhaei qui erant trans Jordanem ad Occidentem, et omnes reges
Chananaei, qui juxta mare, quod siccasset Jehova aquas Jordanis a facie
filiorum Israel donec transirent, liquefactum fuit cor eorum neque fuit
amplius in eis, Spiritus a facie filiorum Israel.

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span>**2.** At that time the LORD said unto
Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of
Israel the second time.

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Eo tempore dixit Jehova ad Josuam,
Fac tibi cultros acutos, et iterum circuncide filios Israel secundo.

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span>**3.** And Joshua made him sharp knives, and
circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et fecit sibi Josue cultros acutos,
circunciditque filios Israel in colle praeputiorum.

<span id="viii.i-p8"></span>**4.** And this *is* the cause why Joshua
did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, *that were*
males, *even* all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way,
after they came out of Egypt.

<span id="viii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Haec autem est causa cur
circunciderit Josue: Universus populus qui egressus fuerat ex Aegypto,
masculi omnes viri bellatores mortui erant in deserto in itinere
posteaquam egressi erant ex Aegypto.

<span id="viii.i-p10"></span>**5.** Now all the people that came out
were circumcised: but all the people *that were* born in the wilderness
by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, *them* they had not
circumcised.

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Nam circuncisus fuerat totus populus
qui egressus est, at totum populum, qui natus fuerat in deserto in
itinere, postquam egressi erant ex Aegypto, non circunciderant.

<span id="viii.i-p12"></span>**6.** For the children of Israel walked
forty years in the wilderness, till all the people *that were* men of
war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the
voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD swear that he would not show them
the land, which the LORD swear unto their fathers that he would give us,
a land that flows with milk and honey.

<span id="viii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Nam quadraginta annis ambulaverunt
filii Israel per desertum, donec consumeretur universa gens virorum
bellatorum, qui egressi fuerant ex Aegypto, qui non audierant vocem
Jehovae, quibus juraverat Jehova quod non ostenderet terram de qua
juraverat Jehova patribus eorum, se daturum illis terram fluentem lacte
et melle.

<span id="viii.i-p14"></span>**7.** And their children, *whom* he raised
up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised,
because they had not circumcised them by the way.

<span id="viii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Filios itaque eorum quos substituit
in locum ipsorum circuncidit Josue, quia incircuncisi erant: neque enim
eos circunciderat in itinere.

<span id="viii.i-p16"></span>**8.** And it came to pass, when they had
done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the
camp, till they were whole.

<span id="viii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Quum autem fuit circuncisus
universus populus, manserunt in loco suo in castris donec sanarentur.

<span id="viii.i-p18"></span>**9.** And the LORD said unto Joshua, This
day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the
name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.

<span id="viii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Dixit Jehova ad Josuam, Hodie
devolvi opprobrium Aegypti a vobis. Et vocavit nomen loci illius Gilgal,
usque in hunc diem.

<span id="viii.i-p20"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p21"></span><span id="viii.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p22"></span>**1.** *And it came to pass when,* etc The
recognition of the fearful power of God had such an effect upon them
that they were astonished and fainted with terror, but it did not
incline their minds to seek a remedy for the evil. Their heart was
melted inasmuch as destitute of counsel and strength they did not bestir
themselves, but in regard to contumacy they remained as hard-hearted as
before. We have already seen elsewhere how unbelievers, when smitten
with fear, cease not to wrestle with God, and even when they fall,
continue fiercely to assail heaven. Hence the dread which ought to have
urged them to caution had no other effect than to hurry them on
headlong. They were, however, terrified from above for the sake of the
people, that victory might be more easily obtained, and the Israelites
might be emboldened when they saw they had to do with an enemy already
broken and stricken with dismay. Thus God spared their weakness, as if
he had opened up the way by removing obstacles, because they had already
proved themselves to be otherwise more sluggish and cowardly than was
meet. The substance then is, that before the conflict commenced, the
enemy were already routed by the terror which the fame of the miracle
had inspired.

<span id="viii.i-p23"></span><span id="viii.i-p23.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p24"></span>**2.** *At that time the Lord said,* etc It
seems very strange and almost monstrous, that circumcision had so long
been laid aside, especially as it became those who were receiving daily
admonitions to be more than usually careful to cultivate the exercises
of piety. It was the symbol of the adoption to which they owed their
freedom. And it is certain that when they were reduced to extremity and
groaning under tyranny, they always circumcised their children. We know
also how sternly God threatened to be an avenger against any one who
should allow the eighth day to pass. Had the observance been neglected
in Egypt their carelessness might have admitted of excuse, as at that
time the covenant of God appeared to have become in a manner obsolete.
But now when the divine faithfulness in establishing the covenant is
once more refulgent, what excuse could there be for not testifying on
their part that they are the people of God

<span id="viii.i-p25"></span>The apology which commentators offer is
altogether frivolous. I admit that they were constantly under arms, and
always uncertain when they would require to move. But I hold it
erroneous to infer from this that they had not a day’s leisure, and that
it would have been cruel to circumcise tender infants when the camp must
shortly after have been moved. Nothing ought to have weighed so much
with them as to produce a contemptuous disregard of what had been said
to Abraham, (<span id="viii.i-p25.1"></span>[Ge
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#014)<span id="viii.i-p25.1"></span>.md)
The soul that is not circumcised shall be cut off from the people. But
if there was risk of life in the circumcision, the best and only method
was to trust to the paternal providence of God, who certainly would not
have allowed his own precept to become fatal to infants. In short, the
omission from a fear of danger, could not originate in any other cause
than distrust. But even had it been certain that infants would be
brought into danger, God ought nevertheless to have been obeyed,
inasmuch as the seal of the covenant by which they were received into
the Church was more precious than a hundred lives. Nor would Moses have
suffered such cowardly procedure had he not been influenced by some
different motive. Moreover, though the point is doubtful, I presume that
they did not desist from circumcising their children, the very first day
after their departure, but only after they had been obliged to retrace
their steps through their own perverseness. And in this way both the
defection and the punishment are accurately expressed, For it is not
said that circumcision was resumed, because the constant change of place
during their wanderings made it previously impossible, but because forty
years behooved to elapse until those wicked apostates who had cut
themselves off from the promised inheritance were consumed.

<span id="viii.i-p26"></span>Attention should be paid to the reason here
given, namely, that the children of Israel wandered through the desert
till the whole of the generation which had refused to follow God was
extinct; from this we may, in my opinion, infer, that the use of
circumcision ceased during the whole of that period as a sign of
malediction or rejection. It is true, indeed, that the penalty was
inflicted on the innocent, but it was expedient that the fathers should
be chastised in their person, as if God were repudiating them for the
time to come. When they saw that their offspring differed in no respect
from profane persons and strangers, they had a plain demonstration of
what they themselves deserved.

<span id="viii.i-p27"></span>Here, however, an inconsistency seems to
arise in respect, *first,* that while they were condemned, their
offspring were immediately received into favor; and *secondly,* that to
themselves also was left a hope of pardon; and more especially, that
they were not deprived of the other sacraments of which they could not
be partakers, except on the ground of their being separated from profane
nations.

<span id="viii.i-p28"></span>The Lord, I admit, in rejecting them,
declares at the same time that he will be propitious to their children,
but to behold in their offspring a sign of repudiation till they
themselves all perished, was salutary chastisement. For God withdrew the
pledge of his favor only for a time, and kept it, as it were, locked up
until their death. This punishment, therefore, was not properly
inflicted on the children who were afterwards born, but had the same
effect as a suspension, just as if God were making it manifest that he
had put off circumcision for a time lest it should be profaned, but was
waiting for an opportunity of renewing it.

<span id="viii.i-p29"></span>Should any one object that it was absurd to
celebrate the Passover in uncircumcision, I admit that it was so
according to the usual order. For none were admitted to the Passover and
the sacrifices save those who were initiated into the worship of God;
just as in the present day the ordinance of the Supper is common only to
those who have been admitted into the Church by baptism. But the Lord
might choose for a time to alter the ordinary rule, and allow those from
whom he had taken away circumcision to be partakers of other sacred
rites. Thus the people were excommunicated in one matter, and yet, in
the meanwhile, furnished with fit aids to prevent them from falling into
despair; just as if a father, offended with his son, were to raise his
fist, apparently to drive him away, and were at the same time to detain
him by his other hand, — were to frighten him by threats and blows, and
yet be unwilling to part with him. This seems to me to have been the
reason why God, while depriving the people of the special pledge of
adoption, was, however, unwilling to deprive them of other ordinances.

<span id="viii.i-p30"></span>Should it be objected that there is a
distinct assertion that none were circumcised on the way after they had
set out, I answer, that, with a view to brevity, all things are not
stated exactly, and yet that it may be gathered from the context that
none remained uncircumcised but those who were born after the sedition.
For it is said that their sons, whom God substituted for them, were
circumcised by Joshua. From this it appears that a new people were then
created to supply the place of perverse rebels. It was, moreover, a sad
and severe trial that God did not choose to have the people circumcised
till they were hemmed in by enemies on every side. It would, certainly,
have been safer and more convenient to perform the rite before crossing
the Jordan, in the land of Bashan, which had been reduced to peace by
the overthrow of the inhabitants. The Lord waits till they are shut up
in the midst of enemies, and exposed to their lust and violence, as if
he were purposely exposing them to death; since all weakened by their
wound must have given way at once, and been slaughtered almost without
resistance. For if in similar circumstances (<span
id="viii.i-p30.1"></span>[Ge 34](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#000.md)<span
id="viii.i-p30.1"></span>) two sons of Jacob, were able to force their
way into the town of Sichem and plunder it, after slaying its citizens,
how much more easy would it have been for the neighboring nations to
attack the Israelites while thus wounded, and make a general massacre of
them.

<span id="viii.i-p31"></span>This was, therefore, as I have said, a very
harsh trial, and hence the readiness with which it was submitted to is
deserving of the greater praise. The place itself, however, appears to
have been purposely selected by the divine wisdom, that they might be
more disposed to obey. Had the same command been given on the other side
of the Jordan, there was reason to fear that they might be cast into
despondency, and from the delay thus interposed might again decline to
enter the land. But now, when they had been brought into possession
under happy auspices, as if by the hand of God, and conceived from the
removal of this one obstacle a sure hope of warring with success, it is
not wonderful if they obey more willingly than they might have done if
they had not been so singularly strengthened. The very sight of the
promised land must have furnished additional incentives, when they
understood that they were again consecrated to God, in order that their
uncircumcision might not pollute the holy land.

<span id="viii.i-p32"></span><span id="viii.i-p32.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p33"></span>**9.** *And the Lord said unto Joshua,* etc
The disgrace of Egypt is expounded by some as meaning that the want of
circumcision rendered them similar to the Egyptians, in other words,
profane and marked with a stigma; as if it had been said that they were
again made the peculiar property of God when they were anew stamped with
this mark, to distinguish them from the nations that were unclean.
Others understand it actively, as meaning that they would no longer be
scorned by the Egyptians, as if God had deceived them. This I have no
hesitation in rejecting as too far fetched. Others understand that they
would no longer lie under the false imputation of worshipping the gods
of that nation. I rather understand the meaning to be, that they were
freed from an invidious charge, by which they were otherwise overborne.
It was disreputable to have shaken off the yoke and revolted from the
king under whose government they lived. Moreover, as they gave out that
God was the avenger of unjust tyranny, it was easy to upbraid them with
using the name of God as a mere color for their conduct. They might,
therefore, have been regarded as deserters, had not the disgrace been
wiped off by the appeal to circumcision, by which the divine election
was sealed in their flesh before they went down into Egypt. It was
accordingly made plain by the renewal of the ancient covenant that they
were not rebels against legitimate authority, nor had rashly gone off at
their own hand, but that their liberty was restored by God, who had long
ago taken them under his special protection.

<span id="viii.i-p34"></span>From the removal of disgrace the place
obtained its name. For those who think that the prepuce cut off was
called Gilgal, because it was a kind of circle, abandon the literal
meaning, and have recourse to a very unnecessary fiction; while it is
perfectly obvious that the place was called *Rolling Off,* because God
there rolled off from his people the disgrace which unjustly attached to
them. The interpretation of *liberty,* adopted by Josephus, is vain and
ridiculous, and makes it apparent that he was as ignorant of the Hebrew
tongue as of jurisprudence.

<span id="viii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
5:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/jos005.htm#010.md)<span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>**10.** And the children of Israel encamped
in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at
even in the plains of Jericho.

<span id="viii.ii-p3"></span>**10.** Itaque castrametati sunt filii
Israel in Gilgal, et fecerunt Paesah quartadecima die mensis ad vesperum
in campestribus Jericho.

<span id="viii.ii-p4"></span>**11.** And they did eat of the old corn of
the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched
*corn* in the selfsame day.

<span id="viii.ii-p5"></span>**11.** Et comederunt e fructu terrae
postridie Paesah infermentata, et polentam ipsomet die.

<span id="viii.ii-p6"></span>**12.** And the manna ceased on the morrow
after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the
children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the
land of Canaan that year.

<span id="viii.ii-p7"></span>**12.** Et cessavit man postridie postquam
comederunt e frumento terrae; neque fuit ultra filiis Israel man, sed
comederunt e fructu terrae Chanaan eo anno.

<span id="viii.ii-p8"></span>**13.** And it came to pass, when Joshua
was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold,
there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and
Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, *Art* thou for us, or for our
adversaries?

<span id="viii.ii-p9"></span>**13.** Contigit autem quum esset Josue
apud Jericho, ut levaret oculos suos ac aspiceret: et ecce vir stabat
contra eum, in cujus manu erat gladius evaginatus: et ivit Josue ad eum,
dixitque illi, Ex nostris es? An ex adversariis nostris?

<span id="viii.ii-p10"></span>**14.** And he said, Nay; but *as* captain
of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to
the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What says my lord unto
his servant?

<span id="viii.ii-p11"></span>**14.** Et dixit Non: sed sum princeps
exercitus Jehovae: nunc veni. Et cecidit Josue in faciem suam ad terram,
et adoravit, dixitque ei: Quid Dominus meus loquitur ad servum suum?

<span id="viii.ii-p12"></span>**15.** And the captain of the LORD’S host
said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place
whereon thou stands *is* holy. And Joshua did so.

<span id="viii.ii-p13"></span>**15.** Et dixit princeps exercitus
Jehovae ad Josuam: Solve calceamentum tuum e pedibus tuis: quia locus
super quem stas, sanctitas est. Et ita fecit Josue.

<span id="viii.ii-p14"></span> 

<span id="viii.ii-p15"></span><span id="viii.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p16"></span>**10.** *And the children of Israel. kept
the Passover,* etc Here it is stated that the Passover was celebrated on
the regular day, although there are some who think that the words used
imply that the practice was unusual. They hence infer that, like
circumcision, it had been interrupted for a period of forty years, as it
would have been absurd for persons uncircumcised to take part in a
sacred feast. To confirm this view, they observe that we do not read of
the Passover having been observed after the beginning of the second
year. But it is not probable that that which God had lately ordered to
be perpetual, (<span id="viii.ii-p16.1"></span>[Ex
12:42](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#042)<span id="viii.ii-p16.1"></span>.md)
was suddenly cast aside. For it had been said to them, It is a night to
be observed by the children of Israel in all their generations. How
inconsistent, then, would it have been had this practice, which was to
be observed throughout all ages, become obsolete in the course of two
years! And again, how heartless it would have been to bury the memory of
a recent favor within so short a period!

<span id="viii.ii-p17"></span>But it is said that the want of
circumcision must have kept back a large proportion, that the mystery
might not be profaned; for at its institution it had been declared, No
uncircumcised person shall eat of it. To this I have already answered,
that it was an extraordinary privilege; as the children of Israel were
freed from the law.  <span id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) For it is
certain that they continued to use sacrifices, and to observe the other
parts of legal worship, although this was unlawful, unless something of
the form prescribed by the law had been remitted by divine authority. It
is certain that unclean persons were prohibited from entering the court
of the tabernacle, and yet the children of Israel, while uncircumcised,
offered sacrifices there, thus doing what was equivalent to the slaying
of the Passover. They were therefore permitted, by sufferance, to do
that which it was not lawful to do according to the rule of the law.

<span id="viii.ii-p19"></span>The mention made by Moses of the second
celebration of the Passover (<span id="viii.ii-p19.1"></span>[Nu
9](../../../bib/kjv/num009.htm#000)<span id="viii.ii-p19.1"></span>.md) is
for a different purpose, namely, for the purpose of indirectly censuring
the carelessness and sluggishness of the people, who would not have
observed the sacred anniversary at the end of the first year if they had
not been reminded of it. For although God had proclaimed that they
should through all ages annually renew the memory of their deliverance,
yet they had grown so oblivious before the end of the year, that they
had become remiss in the discharge of the duty. It is not without cause
they are urged by a new intimation, as they were not sufficiently
attentive of their own accord. That passage, therefore, does not prove
that the use of the Passover was afterwards interrupted; on the
contrary, it may, with some probability, be inferred from it that it was
annually observed; as the Lord, towards the end of the year, anticipates
the observance, telling them to make careful provision for it in future,
and never deviate from the command which had been given them.  <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md)

<span id="viii.ii-p21"></span><span id="viii.ii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p22"></span>**11.** *And they did eat of the old
corn,* etc Whether they then began first to eat wheaten bread is not
very clear. For they had dwelt in a country that was not uncultivated,
and was tolerably fertile. At least in the territories of the two kings
there was enough of corn to supply the inhabitants. It does not seem
reasonable to suppose that the children of Israel allowed the corn which
they found there to rot and perish by mere waste. And I have no doubt
that they ate the flesh which remained over of the sacrifices. It is
quite possible, therefore, that they did not wholly abstain from wheaten
bread, and yet did not abandon their accustomed food. For a country
which was assigned to a tenth part could not have furnished food
sufficient for the whole multitude, as there cannot be a doubt that a
just estimate was made when Moses settled in it only two tribes and a
half tribe. As yet, therefore, the twelve tribes had not found
sufficient food, more especially as the country had been devastated by
war, and the Israelites, who were not in safety to leave the camp, could
not devote their attention to agriculture. The manna was thus necessary
to feed them until a more abundant supply was obtained. This took place
in the land of Canaan, and then, accordingly, they returned to common
food. But why they deferred it till that day is not known, unless it be
that after their wound was cured, some days behooved to be spent in
collecting corn, while religion did not permit them to bake bread lest
they should break the Sabbath. But although that rest was sacred, we
gather from the circumstances that they made haste, as the flour must
have been previously prepared, seeing they could not grind it and bake
it in a single day.

<span id="viii.ii-p23"></span>Be this as it may, the Lord furnished them
with provision as long as their want required to be supplied. The
failure of the manna on a sudden, and at the very moment, must have
furnished an additional attestation to the kindness of God, inasmuch as
it was thence apparent that the manna was a temporary resource, which
had descended not so much from the clouds as from a paternal providence.
It is moreover plain, that this is to be understood of the produce of
the former year, and it is needless to raise any question in regard to
it; for it would have implied too much precipitation to rush upon the
produce of the present year when not yet properly matured, and a whole
month would scarcely have sufficed to collect enough for the supply of
so great a multitude. I cannot see why expounders should give themselves
so much trouble with so clear a matter.

<span id="viii.ii-p24"></span><span id="viii.ii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p25"></span>**13.** *And it came to pass when Joshua,
etc* Here we have the narrative of a remarkable vision, by which Joshua
was greatly encouraged and emboldened. For though he was strenuously
discharging his office, the application of an additional stimulus was
not without its use. The angel, however, did not appear solely on his
private account, but for the confirmation of the whole people: nay, the
Lord looked further forward, that he might furnish posterity with
stronger proofs of a kindness which was never duly considered. For
although they boasted in lofty terms of having been planted by the hand
of God in a holy land, they were scarcely induced by all the miracles to
acknowledge in good earnest that they were placed there as God’s
vassals. This vision, therefore, must have been beneficial to all ages,
by leaving no doubt as to the divine kindness bestowed. Its being said
that he lifted his eyes, tends to confirm the certainty of the vision,
lest any one might suppose that his eyesight had merely been dazzled by
some evanescent phantom.

<span id="viii.ii-p26"></span>The spectacle, when first presented, must
have inspired fear; for it is probable that Joshua was then alone,
whether he had withdrawn from public view to engage in prayer, or for
the purpose of reconnoitering the city. I am rather inclined to think it
was the latter, and that he had gone aside to examine where the city
ought to be attacked, lest the difficulty might deter others. It appears
certain that he was without attendants, as he alone perceives the
vision; and there can be no doubt that he was prepared to fight had he
fallen in with an enemy. But he puts his question as if addressing a
man, because it is only from the answer he learns that it is an angel.
This doubt gives more credibility to the vision, while he is gradually
led from the view of the man whom he addresses to the recognition of an
angel. The words, at the same time, imply that it was not an ordinary
angel, but one of special excellence. For he calls himself captain of
the Lord’s host, a term which may be understood to comprehend not merely
his chosen people, but angels also.

<span id="viii.ii-p27"></span>The former view, however, is the more
correct, as God does not produce anything of an unwonted nature, but
constitutes that which we previously read that he performed to Moses.
And we know that Moses himself preferred this favor to all others; and
justly, for God there manifested his own glory in an open and familiar
manner. Accordingly, he is indiscriminately called an angel, and
distinguished by the title of the eternal God. Of this fact Paul is a
competent witness, who distinctly declares that it was Christ. (<span
id="viii.ii-p27.1"></span>[1Co
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#004)<span id="viii.ii-p27.1"></span>..md)
And Moses himself embraced God as present in the person of the Mediator.
For when God declares, after the making of the calf, (<span
id="viii.ii-p27.2"></span>[Ex
33:2-3](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#002.md)<span id="viii.ii-p27.2"></span>
 <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55) .md) that he would no longer be the
Leader of the people, he at the same time promises that he will give one
of his angels, but only one, as it were taken out of the general body of
the angelic host.  <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) This Moses
earnestly deprecates, obviously because he could have no hope that God
would be propitious if the Mediator were removed. It was thus a special
pledge of the divine favor that the Captain and Head of the Church, to
whom Moses had been accustomed, was now present to assist. And indeed
the divine adoption could not be ratified in any other way than in the
hand of the Mediator.

<span id="viii.ii-p30"></span><span id="viii.ii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p31"></span>**14.** *And he said, Nay; but as
captain,* etc Although the denial applies equally to both parts of the
question, namely, that he was neither an Israelite nor a Canaanite, and
was thus equivalent to a denial of his being a mortal man, yet it seems
to be more properly applicable to the second, or to that part of the
question in which Joshua asked if he were one of the enemy. This,
however, is a matter of little moment; the essential thing is to
understand that he had come to preside over the chosen people whom he
honorably styles the Lord’s host. In his representing himself as
different from God, a personal distinction is denoted, but unity of
essence is not destroyed.

<span id="viii.ii-p32"></span>We have said that in the books of Moses
the name of Jehovah  <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) is often
attributed to the presiding Angel, who was undoubtedly the only-begotten
Son of God. He is indeed very God, and yet in the person of Mediator by
dispensation, he is inferior to God. I willingly receive what ancient
writers teach on this subject, — that when Christ anciently appeared in
human form, it was a prelude to the mystery which was afterwards
exhibited when God was manifested in the flesh. We must beware, however,
of imagining that Christ at that time became incarnate, since, *first,*
we nowhere read that God sent his Son in the flesh before the fullness
of the times; and, *secondly,* Christ, in so far as he was a man,
behooved to be the Son of David. But as is said in Ezekiel, (<span
id="viii.ii-p33.2"></span>[Eze 1](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#000.md)<span
id="viii.ii-p33.2"></span>) it was only a likeness of man. Whether it
was a substantial body or an outward form, it is needless to discuss, as
it seems wrong to insist on any particular view of the subject.  <span
id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md)

<span id="viii.ii-p35"></span>The only remaining question is, how the
Captain of the Lord’s host can speak of having *now* come, seeing he had
not deserted the people committed to his trust, and had lately given a
matchless display of his presence in the passage of the Jordan. But
according to the common usage of Scripture, God is said to come to us
when we are actually made sensible of his assistance, which seems remote
when not manifested by experience. It is therefore just as if he were
offering his assistance in the combats which were about to be waged, and
promising by his arrival that the war would have a happy issue. It
cannot be inferred with certainty from the worship which he offered,
whether Joshua paid divine honor to Christ distinctly recognized as
such; but by asking, What command does my Lord give to his servant? he
attributes to him a power and authority which belong to God alone.

<span id="viii.ii-p36"></span><span id="viii.ii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p37"></span>**15.** *Loose thy shoe from off thy
foot,* etc To give additional sanctity to the vision, the great Angel
requires as a sign of reverence and fear that Joshua put off his shoes.
Moses relates, (<span id="viii.ii-p37.1"></span>[Ex
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#005)<span id="viii.ii-p37.1"></span>.md)
that the same command was given to him on Mount Sinai, and for no other
reason than that the Lord there manifested his glory. For one place
cannot have a greater sanctity than another, except God deigns specially
to make it so. Thus Jacob exclaims, (<span id="viii.ii-p37.2"></span>[Ge
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#017.md)<span id="viii.ii-p37.2"></span>
 <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59) .md) that the place where he had
known God more nearly is the house of God, a dreadful place, and the
gate of heaven. Here, therefore, when God orders his holy servant to
take off his shoes, he by this ceremony attests the reality of his
presence, and adds more weight to the vision; not that nakedness of feet
is of itself of any value in the worship of God, but because the
weakness of men requires to be aided by helps of this kind, that they
may the better excite and prepare themselves for veneration. Moreover,
as God by his presence sanctifies the places in which he appears, I
think it probable that the expression, holy ground, is in part
commendatory of the excellence of the land of Canaan, which God had
chosen for his own habitation and the seat of his pure worship. Hence in
various passages it is called “his rest.” (<span
id="viii.ii-p38.2"></span>[Ps
95:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#011.md)<span id="viii.ii-p38.2"></span>,
and <span id="viii.ii-p38.3"></span>[Ps
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md)<span id="viii.ii-p38.3"></span>
 <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60) .md) In the end of the verse Joshua
is praised for his obedience, that posterity might learn by his example
to cultivate pure piety in that land. There seems thus to be a kind of
tacit comparison or antithesis, by which the land of Canaan is extolled
above all other countries.  <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md)

<span id="viii.ii-p20"></span> These remarks place the view which Calvin
takes in its most favorable light; but, on the other hand, it is
strongly argued, 1. That the eating of the Passover by an uncircumcised
person was expressly prohibited, (<span id="viii.ii-p20.1"></span>[Ex
12:48](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#048)<span id="viii.ii-p20.1"></span>.md)
2. That the observance of it during the wandering in the desert is, by
implication at least, dispensed with in the words, “And it shall come to
pass, when you be come to the land which the Lord will give you,
according as he has promised, that you shall keep this service.” (<span
id="viii.ii-p20.2"></span>[Ex
12:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#025)<span id="viii.ii-p20.2"></span>.md)
3. That the observance of the Passover at Mount Sinai was in compliance
with a special mandate, and would not have taken place without it. 4.
The assumption that sacrifices were offered in the desert is questioned
as inconsistent with <span id="viii.ii-p20.3"></span>[Am
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#025.md)<span id="viii.ii-p20.3"></span>.
It may be added, that the order to circumcise, evidently intended as a
preparation for the celebration of the approaching Passover, seems to
imply that there had previously been a similar omission of both
ordinances. It must also have been difficult, if not impossible, while
in the wilderness, to obtain flour in sufficient quantity to make
unleavened Passover bread for a whole people. — *Ed.*

the angel, and that God will no longer 'go out before' the people of

<span id="viii.ii-p34"></span> Several modern commentators, among others
Grotius, have maintained that the personage who thus appeared was merely
a created angel. In this they have only followed in the steps of the
Jewish Rabbis, who not satisfied with holding that he was an angel, have
gone the farther length of fixing what particular angel it was. With
almost unanimous consent they declare it to have been Michael, though
they are unable to support their opinion by anything stronger than the
first verse of the twelfth chapter of Daniel, \[<span
id="viii.ii-p34.1"></span>[Da
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.ii-p34.1"></span>\]
in which it is said, that “at that time shall Michael stand up, the
great prince which stands for the children of thy people.” The sounder
view here advocated by Calvin, and generally adopted by the early
Christian Fathers, is well expressed by Origen, who says, in his Sixth
Homily on this Book, “Joshua knew not only that he was of God, but that
he was God. For he would not have worshipped, had he not recognized him
to be God. For who else is the Captain of the Lord’s host but our Lord
Jesus Christ?” It would make sad havoc with our ideas of divine worship
to admit that the homage which Joshua here pays could be lawfully
received, or rather could, so to speak, be imperiously demanded by one
creature from another. — *Ed.*
