<span id="v-p1"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="v.i"></span>

<span id="v.i-p1"></span><span id="v.i-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
2:1-24](../../../bib/kjv/jos002.htm#001.md)<span id="v.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p2"></span>**1.** And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of
Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho.
And they went, and came into an harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged
there.

<span id="v.i-p3"></span>**1.** Miserat  <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) autem Josue filius Nun viros duos
exploratores clam,  <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) dicendo: Ite,
considerate terram et Jericho. Profecti sunt igitur et ingressi sunt
domum mulieris meretricis, cujus nomen erat Rahab, et dormierunt illic.

<span id="v.i-p6"></span>**2.** And it was told the king of Jericho,
saying, Behold, there came men in hither tonight of the children of
Israel to search out the country.

<span id="v.i-p7"></span>**2.** Dictum autem fuit regi Jericho, Ecce
venerunt huc viri nocte hac e filiis Israel ad explorandum terram.

<span id="v.i-p8"></span>**3.** And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab,
saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered
into thine house they be come to search out all the country.

<span id="v.i-p9"></span>**3.** Tunc misit rex Jericho ad rahab,
dicendo; Educ viros qui ingressi sunt ad te, qui venerunt domum tuam;
quia ad explorandum totam terram venerunt.

<span id="v.i-p10"></span>**4.** And the woman took the two men, and hid
them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they
*were:*

<span id="v.i-p11"></span>**4.** Sumpserat autem mulier duos viros, et
absconderat eos: Tunc ait, Venerunt quidem ad me viri, sed non noveram
undenam essent.

<span id="v.i-p12"></span>**5.** And it came to pass, *about the* *time*
of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out;
whither the men went, I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for you
shall overtake them.

<span id="v.i-p13"></span>**5.** Fuit autem dum porta clauderetur in
tenebris, egressi sunt viri; nec cognovi quo abierint. Sequimini cito
eos quia comprehendetis eos.

<span id="v.i-p14"></span>**6.** But she had brought them up to the roof
of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid
in order upon the roof.

<span id="v.i-p15"></span>**6.** Ipsa autem ascendere fecerat eos in
tectum, et absconderat eos sub culmis lini ab ea ordinatis super tectum.

<span id="v.i-p16"></span>**7.** And the men pursued after them the way
to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them
were gone out, they shut the gate.

<span id="v.i-p17"></span>**7.** Viri autem persequuti sunt eos itinere
Jordanis usque ad vada: portam vero clauserunt, simul ac egressi sunt
qui eos persequebantur.

<span id="v.i-p18"></span>**8.** And, before they were laid down, she
came up unto them upon the roof;

<span id="v.i-p19"></span>**8.** Antequam vero dormirent, ipsa ascendit
super tectum ad eos.

<span id="v.i-p20"></span>**9.** And she said unto the men, I know that
the Lord has given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us,
and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.

<span id="v.i-p21"></span>**9.** Et ait ad viros: Novi quod Jehova
dederit vobis terram, eo quod cecidit terror vester super nos, et quod
defluxerunt omnes habitatores terrae a facie vestra.

<span id="v.i-p22"></span>**10.** For we have heard how the Lord dried
up the water of the Red sea for you, when you came out of Egypt; and
what you did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that *were* on the
other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.

<span id="v.i-p23"></span>**10.** Audivimus enim quomodo arefecerit
Jehova aquas maris Supli a facie vestra dum exiistis ex Aegypto; et quae
fecistis duobus regibus Aemorrhaei, qui erant trans Jordanem: Sihon et
Og quos interemistis.

<span id="v.i-p24"></span>**11.** And as soon as we had heard these
things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage
in any man, because of you; for the Lord your God, he is God in heaven
above, and in earth beneath.

<span id="v.i-p25"></span>**11.** Audivimus, et dissolutum est cor
nostrum, neque constitit ultra spiritus a facie vestra. Jehova enim Deus
vester Deus est in coelo sursum et super terram deorsum.

<span id="v.i-p26"></span>**12.** Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto
me by the Lord, since I have showed you kindness, that you will also
show kindness unto my father’s house, and give me a true token:

<span id="v.i-p27"></span>**12.** Nunc ergo jurate mihi, quaeso, per
Jehovam (feci enim vobiscum misericordiam) quod facietis etiam vos cum
domo patris mei misericordiam, et dabitis mihi signum verum,

<span id="v.i-p28"></span>**13.** And that you will save alive my
father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that
they have, and deliver our lives from death.

<span id="v.i-p29"></span>**13.** Quod vivos servabitis fratrem meum, et
matrem meam, et fratres meos, et sorores meas, et omnes qui sunt eorum,
eruetisque animas nostras a morte.

<span id="v.i-p30"></span>**14.** And the men answered her, Our life for
yours, if you utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the
Lord has given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with
thee.

<span id="v.i-p31"></span>**14.** Dixerunt ei viri: Anima nostra pro
vobis ad moriendum: modo non prodideris sermonem nostrum hunc: tunc
erit, ubi tradiderit Jehova nobis terram, faciemus tecum misericordiam
et veritatem.

<span id="v.i-p32"></span>**15.** Then she let them down by a cord
through the window; for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt
upon the wall.

<span id="v.i-p33"></span>**15.** Demisit itaque eos fune per fenestram:
domus enim ejus erat in pariete muri, et in muro ipsa habitabat.

<span id="v.i-p34"></span>**16.** And she said unto them, Get you to the
mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three
days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may you go your way.

<span id="v.i-p35"></span>**16.** Dixit autem eis: Ad montem pergite, ne
forte occurrant vobis qui insequuntur, et latitate illic tribus diebus,
donec redeant qui insequuntur, et postea ibitis per viam vestram.

<span id="v.i-p36"></span>**17.** And the men said unto her, We will be
blameless of this thine oath which thou has made us swear:

<span id="v.i-p37"></span>**17.** Tunc dixerunt ei viri, Innoxii erimus
a juramento tuo hoc quo nos adjurasti.

<span id="v.i-p38"></span>**18.** Behold, when we come into the land,
thou shall bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou did
let us down by: and thou shall bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy
brethren, and all thy father’s household, home unto thee.

<span id="v.i-p39"></span>**18.** Ecce, quum ingrediemur terram,
funiculum hunc fili coccinei ligabis in fenestra, per quam demiseris
nos: patrem vero tuum et matrem tuam congregabis ad te in domum, et
omnem familiam patris tui.

<span id="v.i-p40"></span>**19.** And it shall be, that whosoever shall
go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be
upon his head, and we will be guiltless; and whosoever shall be with
thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon
him.

<span id="v.i-p41"></span>**19.** Erit autem, quicunque egressus fuerit
e valvis domus tuae foras, sanguis ejus erit in caput ejus, nos vero
innoxii: quicunque vero tecum fuerit in domo, sanguis illius in caput
nostrum, si manus injecta fuerit in eum.

<span id="v.i-p42"></span>**20.** And if thou utter this our business,
then we will be quit of thine oath which thou has made us to swear.

<span id="v.i-p43"></span>**20.** Si vero prodideris sermonem hunc
nostrum, erimus innoxii a juramento quo adjurasti nos.

<span id="v.i-p44"></span>**21.** And she said, According unto your
words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she
bound the scarlet line in the window.

<span id="v.i-p45"></span>**21.** Respondit illa: Ut loquuti estis, ita
sit. Tunc dimisit eos, et abierunt, ligavitque filum coccineum in
fenestra.

<span id="v.i-p46"></span>**22.** And they went, and came unto the
mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned.
And the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.

<span id="v.i-p47"></span>**22.** Profecti venerunt ad montem, et
manserunt ibi tribus diebus, donec reverterentur qui insequuti fuerant,
qui quaesierunt per omnem viam, nec invenerunt.

<span id="v.i-p48"></span>**23.** So the two men descended from the
mountain, and returned, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of
Nun, and told him all things that befell them:

<span id="v.i-p49"></span>**23.** Reversi ergo duo illi, postquam
descenderunt e monte, transierunt, veneruntque ad Josue filium Nun, et
narraverunt ei quaecunque acciderant sibi.

<span id="v.i-p50"></span>**24.** And they said unto Joshua, Truly the
Lord has delivered into our hands all the land: for even all the
inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.

<span id="v.i-p51"></span>**24.** Dixeruntque ad Josue, Tradidit Jehova
in manus nostras totam terram. Dissoluti enim sunt omnes habitatores
terrae a facie nostra.

<span id="v.i-p52"></span> 

<span id="v.i-p53"></span><span id="v.i-p53.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p54"></span>**1.** *And Joshua the son of Nun sent,* etc.
The object of the exploration now in question was different from the
former one, when Joshua was sent with other eleven to survey all the
districts of the land, and bring back information to the whole people
concerning its position, nature, fertility, and other properties, the
magnitude and number of the cities, the inhabitants, and their manners.
The present object was to dispose those who might be inclined to be
sluggish, to engage with more alacrity in the campaign. And though it
appears from the first chapter of Deuteronomy, (<span
id="v.i-p54.1"></span>[De 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.i-p54.1"></span>,) that Moses, at the request of the people, sent
chosen men to spy out the land, he elsewhere relates (<span
id="v.i-p54.2"></span>[Nu 13:4](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.i-p54.2"></span>) that he did it by command from God. Those
twelve, therefore, set out divinely commissioned, and for a somewhat
different purpose, viz., to make a thorough survey of the land, and be
the heralds of its excellence to stir up the courage of the people.

<span id="v.i-p55"></span>Now Joshua secretly sends two persons to
ascertain whether or not a free passage may be had over the Jordan,
whether the citizens of Jericho were indulging in security, or whether
they were alert and prepared to resist. In short, he sends spies on
whose report he may provide against all dangers. Wherefore a twofold
question may be here raised — Are we to approve of his prudence? or are
we to condemn him for excessive anxiety, especially as he seems to have
trusted more than was right to his own prudence, when, without
consulting God, he was so careful in taking precautions against danger?
But, inasmuch as it is not expressly said that he received a message
from heaven to order the people to collect their vessels and to publish
his proclamation concerning the passage of the Jordan, although it is
perfectly obvious that he never would have thought of moving the camp
unless God had ordered it, it is also probable that in sending the spies
he consulted God as to his pleasure in the matter, or that God himself,
knowing how much need there was of this additional confirmation, had
spontaneously suggested it to the mind of his servant. Be this as it
may, while Joshua commands his messengers to spy out Jericho, he is
preparing to besiege it, and accordingly is desirous to ascertain in
what direction it may be most easily and safely approached.

<span id="v.i-p56"></span>*They came into a harlot’s house,* etc. Why
some try to avoid the name *harlot,* and interpret <span
id="v.i-p56.1"></span>זונה as meaning *one who keeps an inn,* I see not,
unless it be that they think it disgraceful to be the guests of a
courtesan, or wish to wipe off a stigma from a woman who not only
received the messengers kindly, but secured their safety by singular
courage and prudence. It is indeed a regular practice with the Rabbins,
when they would consult for the honor of their nation, presumptuously to
wrest Scripture and give a different turn by their fictions to anything
that seems not quite reputable.  <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md)
But the probability is, that while the messengers were courting secrecy,
and shunning observation and all places of public intercourse, they came
to a woman who dwelt in a retired spot. Her house was contiguous to the
wall of the city, nay, its outer side was actually situated in the wall.
From this we may infer that it was some obscure corner remote from the
public thoroughfare; just as persons of her description usually live in
narrow lanes and secret places. It cannot be supposed with any
consistency to have been a common inn which was open to all
indiscriminately, because they could not have felt at liberty to indulge
in familiar intercourse, and it must have been difficult in such
circumstances to obtain concealment.

<span id="v.i-p58"></span>My conclusion therefore is, that they obtained
admission privily, and immediately betook themselves to a hiding-place.
Moreover, in the fact that a woman who had gained a shameful livelihood
by prostitution was shortly after admitted into the body of the chosen
people, and became a member of the Church, we are furnished with a
striking display of divine grace which could thus penetrate into a place
of shame, and draw forth from it not only Rahab, but her father and the
other members of her family. Most assuredly while the term <span
id="v.i-p58.1"></span>זונה, almost invariably means *harlot,* there is
nothing here to oblige us to depart from the received meaning.

<span id="v.i-p59"></span><span id="v.i-p59.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p60"></span>**2.** *And it was told the king,* etc. It is
probable that watchmen had been appointed to take notice of suspicious
strangers, as is wont to be done in doubtful emergencies, or during an
apprehension of war. The Israelites were nigh at hand; they had openly
declared to the Edomites and Moabites that they were seeking a
settlement in the land of Canaan; they were formidable for their number;
they had already made a large conquest after slaying two neighboring
kings; and as we shall shortly perceive, their famous passage of the Red
Sea had been noised abroad. It would therefore have argued extreme
supineness in such manifest danger to allow any strangers whatever to
pass freely through the city of Jericho, situated as it was on the
frontiers.

<span id="v.i-p61"></span>It is not wonderful, therefore, that men who
were unknown and who appeared from many circumstances to have come with
a hostile intention, were denounced to the king. At the same time,
however, we may infer that they were supernaturally blinded in not
guarding their gates more carefully; for with the use of moderate
diligence the messengers after they had once entered might easily have
been detained. Nay, a search ought forthwith to have been instituted,
and thus they would to a certainty have been caught. The citizens of
Jericho were in such trepidation and so struck with judicial amazement,
that they acted in everything without method or counsel. Meanwhile the
two messengers were reduced to such extremities that they seemed on the
eve of being delivered up to punishment. The king sends for them; they
are lurking in the house; their life hangs upon the tongue of a woman,
just as if it were hanging by a thread. Some have thought that there was
in this a punishment of the distrust of Joshua, who ought to have boldly
passed the Jordan, trusting to the divine guidance. But the result would
rather lead us to conclude differently, that God by rescuing the
messengers from extreme danger gave new courage to the people; for in
that manifestation of his power he plainly showed that he was watching
over their safety, and providing for their happy entrance into the
promised land.

<span id="v.i-p62"></span><span id="v.i-p62.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p63"></span>**4.** *And the woman took the two men,* etc.
We may presume that before Rahab was ordered to bring them forth the
rumor of their arrival had been spread, and that thus some little time
had been given for concealing them.  <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) And indeed on receiving the king’s
command, had not measures for concealment been well taken, there would
have been no room for denial; much less would she have dared to lie so
coolly. But after she had thus hidden her guests, as the search would
have been difficult, she comes boldly forward and escapes by a crafty
answer.

<span id="v.i-p65"></span>Now, the questions which here arise are,
first, Was treachery to her country excusable? Secondly, Could her lie
be free from fault? We know that the love of our country, which is as it
were our common mother, has been implanted in us by nature. When,
therefore, Rahab knew that the object intended was the overthrow of the
city in which she had been born and brought up, it seems a detestable
act of inhumanity to give her aid and counsel to the spies. It is a
puerile evasion to say, that they were not yet avowed enemies, inasmuch
as war had not been declared; since it is plain enough that they had
conspired the destruction of her fellow-citizens.  <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) It was therefore only the knowledge
communicated to her mind by God which exempted her from fault, as having
been set free from the common rule. Her faith is commended by two
Apostles, who at the same time declare, (<span
id="v.i-p66.1"></span>[Heb 11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031.md)<span
id="v.i-p66.1"></span>; <span id="v.i-p66.2"></span>[Jas
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025)<span id="v.i-p66.2"></span>,.md)
that the service which she rendered to the spies was acceptable to God.

<span id="v.i-p67"></span>It is not wonderful, then, that when the Lord
condescended to transfer a foreign female to his people, and to engraft
her into the body of the Church, he separated her from a profane and
accursed nation. Therefore, although she had been bound to her
countrymen up to that very day, yet when she was adopted into the body
of the Church, her new condition was a kind of manumission from the
common law by which citizens are bound toward each other. In short, in
order to pass by faith to a new people, she behooved to renounce her
countrymen. And as in this she only acquiesced in the judgment of God,
there was no criminality in abandoning them.  <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md)

<span id="v.i-p69"></span>As to the falsehood, we must admit that though
it was done for a good purpose, it was not free from fault. For those
who hold what is called a dutiful lie  <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) to be altogether excusable, do not
sufficiently consider how precious truth is in the sight of God.
Therefore, although our purpose, be to assist our brethren, to consult
for their safety and relieve them, it never can be lawful to lie,
because that cannot be right which is contrary to the nature of God. And
God is truth. And still the act of Rahab is not devoid of the praise of
virtue, although it was not spotlessly pure. For it often happens that
while the saints study to hold the right path, they deviate into
circuitous courses.

<span id="v.i-p71"></span>Rebecca (<span id="v.i-p71.1"></span>[Ge
27](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#000.md)<span id="v.i-p71.1"></span>.  <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37) .md) in procuring the blessing to her son
Jacob, follows the prediction. In obedience of this description a pious
and praiseworthy zeal is perceived. But it cannot be doubted that in
substituting her son Jacob in the place of Esau, she deviated from the
path of duty. The crafty proceeding, therefore, so far taints an act
which was laudable in itself. And yet the particular fault does not
wholly deprive the deed of the merit of holy zeal; for by the kindness
of God the fault is suppressed and not taken into account. Rahab also
does wrong when she falsely declares that the messengers were gone, and
yet the principal action was agreeable to God, because the bad mixed up
with the good was not imputed. On the whole, it was the will of God that
the spies should be delivered, but he did not approve of saving their
life by falsehood.

<span id="v.i-p73"></span><span id="v.i-p73.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p74"></span>**7.** *And the men pursued,* etc. Their great
credulity shows that God had blinded them. Although Rahab had gained
much by deluding them, a new course of anxiety intervenes; for the gates
being shut, the city like a prison excluded the hope of escape. They
were therefore again aroused by a serious trial to call upon God. For
seeing that this history was written on their report, it is impossible
they could have been ignorant of what was then going on, especially as
God, for the purpose of magnifying his grace, purposely exposed them to
a succession of dangers. And now when they were informed that search was
made for them, we infer from the fact of their being still awake, that
they were in anxiety and alarm. Their trepidation must have been in no
small degree increased when it was told them that their exit was
precluded.

<span id="v.i-p75"></span>It appears, however, that Rahab was not at all
dismayed, since she bargains with so much presence of mind, and so
calmly, for her own safety and that of her family. And in this composure
and firmness her faith, which is elsewhere commended, appears
conspicuous. For on human principles she never would have braved the
fury of the king and people, and become a suppliant to guests half dead
with terror. Many, indeed, think there is something ridiculous in the
eulogium bestowed upon her both by St. James and the author of the
Epistle to the Hebrews, (<span id="v.i-p75.1"></span>[Jas
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#025.md)<span id="v.i-p75.1"></span>;
<span id="v.i-p75.2"></span>[Heb
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#031)<span id="v.i-p75.2"></span>,.md)
when they place her in the catalogue of the faithful. But any one who
will carefully weigh all the circumstances will easily perceive that she
was endowed with a lively faith.

<span id="v.i-p76"></span>*First,* If the tree is known by its fruits,
we here see no ordinary effects, which are just so many evidences of
faith. *Secondly,* A principle of piety must have given origin to her
conviction that the neighboring nations were already in a manner
vanquished and laid prostrate, since terror sent from above had filled
all minds with dismay. It is true that in profane writers also we meet
with similar expressions, which God has extorted from them that he might
assert his power to rule and turn the hearts of men in whatever way he
pleases. But while these writers prate like parrots, Rahab declaring in
sincerity of heart that God has destined the land for the children of
Israel, because all the inhabitants have fainted away before them,
claims for him a supreme rule over the hearts of men, a rule which the
pride of the world denies.

<span id="v.i-p77"></span>For although the experience of all times has
shown that more armies have fallen or been routed by sudden and
un-looked for terror than by the force and prowess of the enemy, the
impression of this truth has forthwith vanished away, and hence
conquerors have always extolled their own valor, and on any prosperous
result gloried in their own exertions and talents for war. They have
felt, I admit, that daring and courage are occasionally bestowed or
withheld by some extraneous cause, and accordingly men confess that in
war fortune does much or even reigns supreme. Hence their common proverb
with regard to panic terrors, and their vows made as well to Pavor
*(Dread)* as to Jupiter Stator.  <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md)
But it never became a serious and deep-seated impression in their minds,
that every man is brave according as God has inspired him with present
courage, or cowardly according as he has suppressed his daring. Rahab,
however, recognizes the operation of a divine hand in striking the
nations of Canaan with dismay, and thus making them as it were by
anticipation pronounce their own doom; and she infers that the terror
which the children of Israel have inspired is a presage of victory,
because they fight under God as their Leader.

<span id="v.i-p79"></span>In the fact, that while the courage of all had
thus melted away, they however prepared to resist with the obstinacy of
despair; we see that when the wicked are broken and crushed by the hand
of God, they are not so subdued as to receive the yoke, but in their
terror and anxiety become incapable of being tamed. Here, too, we have
to observe how in a common fear believers differ from unbelievers, and
how the faith of Rahab displays itself. She herself was afraid like any
other of the people; but when she reflects that she has to do with God,
she concludes that her only remedy is to eschew evil by yielding humbly
and placidly, as resistance would be altogether unavailing. But what is
the course taken by all the wretched inhabitants of the country?
Although terror-struck, so far is their perverseness from being overcome
that they stimulate each other to the conflict.

<span id="v.i-p80"></span><span id="v.i-p80.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p81"></span>**10.** *For we have heard how,* etc. She
mentions, as the special cause of consternation, that the wide-spread
rumor of miracles, hitherto without example, had impressed it on the
minds of all that God was warring for the Israelites. For it was
impossible to doubt that the way through the Red Sea had been
miraculously opened up, as the water would never have changed its nature
and become piled up in solid heaps, had not God, the author of nature,
so ordered. The transmutation of the element, therefore, plainly showed
that God was on the side of the people, to whom he had given a dry
passage through the depths of the sea.

<span id="v.i-p82"></span>The signal victories also gained over Og and
Bashan, were justly regarded as testimonies of the divine favor towards
the Israelites. This latter conclusion, indeed, rested only on
conjecture, whereas the passage of the sea was a full and irrefragable
proof, as much so as if God had stretched forth his hand from heaven.
All minds, therefore, were seized with a conviction that in the
expedition of the Israelitish people God was principal leader;  <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) hence their terror and consternation. At
the same time, it is probable that they were deceived by some vain
imagination that the God of Israel had proved superior in the contest to
the gods of Egypt; just as the poets feign that every god has taken some
nation or other under his protection, and wars with others, and that
thus conflicts take place among the gods themselves while they are
protecting their favorites.

<span id="v.i-p84"></span>But the faith of Rahab takes a higher flight,
while to the God of Israel alone she ascribes supreme power and
eternity. These are the true attributes of Jehovah. She does not dream,
according to the vulgar notion, that some one, out of a crowd of
deities, is giving his assistance to the Israelites, but she
acknowledges that He whose favor they were known to possess is the true
and only God. We see, then, how in a case where all received the same
intelligence, she, in the application of it, went far beyond her
countrymen.

<span id="v.i-p85"></span><span id="v.i-p85.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p86"></span>**11.** *The Lord your God, he is God,* etc.
Here the image of Rahab’s faith appears, as if reflected in a mirror,
when casting down all idols she ascribes the government of heaven and
earth to the God of Israel alone. For it is perfectly clear that when
heaven and earth are declared subject to the God of Israel, there is a
repudiation of all the pagan fictions by which the majesty, and power,
and glory of God are portioned out among different deities; and hence we
see that it is not without cause that two Apostles have honored Rahab’s
conduct with the title of *faith* This is sneered at by some proud and
disdainful men, but I wish they would consider what it is to distinguish
the one true God from all fictitious deities, and at the same time so to
extol his power as to declare that the whole world is governed at his
pleasure. Rahab does not speak hesitatingly, but declares, in absolute
terms, that whatever power exists resides in the God of Israel alone,
that he commands all the elements, that he orders all things above and
below, and determines human affairs. Still I deny not that her faith was
not fully developed, nay, I readily admit, that it was only a germ of
piety which, as yet, would have been insufficient for her eternal
salvation. We must hold, nevertheless, that however feeble and slender
the knowledge of God which the woman possessed may have been, still in
surrendering herself to his power, she gives a proof of her election,
and that from that seed a faith was germinating which afterwards
attained its full growth.

<span id="v.i-p87"></span><span id="v.i-p87.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p88"></span>**12.** *Now, therefore, I pray you, swear,*
etc. It is another manifestation of faith that she places the sons of
Abraham in sure possession of the land of Canaan, founding on no other
argument than her having heard that it was divinely promised to them.
For she did not suppose that God was favoring lawless intruders who were
forcing their way into the territories of others with unjust violence
and uncurbed licentiousness, but rather concluded that they were coming
into the land of Canaan, because God had assigned them the dominion of
it. It cannot be believed that when they sought a passage from the
Edomites and others, they said nothing as to whither they were going.
Nay, those nations were acquainted with the promise which was made to
Abraham, and the memory of which had been again renewed by the rejection
of Esau.

<span id="v.i-p89"></span>Moreover, in the language of Rahab, we behold
that characteristic property of faith described by the author of the
Epistle to the Hebrews, when he calls it a vision, or sight of things
not appearing. (<span id="v.i-p89.1"></span>[Heb
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001)<span id="v.i-p89.1"></span>.md)
Rahab is dwelling with her people in a fortified city: and yet she
commits her life to her terrified guests, just as if they had already
gained possession of the land, and had full power to save or destroy as
they pleased. This voluntary surrender was, in fact, the very same as
embracing the promise of God, and casting herself on his protection.
She, moreover, exacts an oath, because often, in the storming of cities,
the heat and tumult of the struggle shook off the remembrance of duty.
In the same way she mentions the kindness she had shown to them, that
gratitude might stimulate them the more to perform their promise. For
although the obligation of the oath ought of itself to have been
effectual, it would have been doubly base and inhumane not to show
gratitude to a hostess to whom they owed deliverance. Rahab shows the
kindliness of her disposition, in her anxiety about her parents and
kindred. This is, indeed, natural; but many are so devoted to
themselves, that children hesitate not to ransom their own lives by the
death of their parents, instead of exerting courage and zeal to save
them.

<span id="v.i-p90"></span><span id="v.i-p90.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p91"></span>**14.** *Our life for yours,* etc. They
imprecate death upon themselves, if they do not faithfully make it their
business to save Rahab. For the interpretation adopted by some, We will
pledge our lives, seems far-fetched, or too restricted, since their
intention was simply to bind themselves before God. They constitute
themselves, therefore, a kind of expiatory victims, if any evil befalls
Rahab through their negligence. The expression, *for yours,* ought,
doubtless, to be extended to the parents, brothers, and sisters. They
therefore render their own lives liable in such a sense, that blood may
be required of them, if the family of Rahab do not remain safe. And
herein consists the sanctity of an oath, that though its violation may
escape with impunity, so far as men are concerned, yet God having been
interposed as a witness, will take account of the perfidy. In Hebrew, to
do mercy and truth, is equivalent to performing the office of humanity
faithfully, sincerely, and firmly.

<span id="v.i-p92"></span>A condition, however, is inserted, — provided
Rahab do not divulge what they have said. This was inserted, not on
account of distrust, as is usually expounded, but only to put Rahab more
upon her guard, on her own account. The warning, therefore, was given in
good faith, and flowed from pure good will: for there was a danger that
Rahab might betray herself by a disclosure. In one word, they show how
important it is that the matter should remain, as it were, buried, lest
the woman, by inconsiderately talking of the compact, might expose
herself to capital punishment. In this they show that they were
sincerely anxious for her safety, since they thus early caution her
against doing anything which might put it out of their power to render
her a service. In further distinctly stipulating, that no one should go
out of the house, or otherwise they should be held blameless, we may
draw the important inference, that in making oaths soberness should be
carefully attended to, that we may not profane the name of God by making
futile promises on any subject.

<span id="v.i-p93"></span>The advice of Rahab, to turn aside into the
mountain, and there remain quiet for three days, shows that there is no
repugnance between faith and the precautions which provide against
manifest dangers. There is no doubt that the messengers crept off to the
mountain in great fear, and yet that confidence which they had
conceived, from the remarkable interference of God in their behalf,
directed their steps, and did not allow them to lose their presence of
mind.

<span id="v.i-p94"></span>Some have raised the question, whether, seeing
it is criminal to overleap walls, it could be lawful to get out of the
city by a window? But it ought to be observed, *first,* that the walls
of cities were not everywhere sacred, because every city had not a
Romulus, who could make the overleaping a pretext for slaying his
brother;  <span id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) and *secondly,* That law,
as Cicero reminds us, was to be tempered by equity, inasmuch as he who
should climb a wall for the purpose of repelling an enemy, would be more
deserving of reward than punishment. The end of the law is to make the
citizens secure by the protection of the walls. He, therefore, who
should climb over the walls, neither from contempt nor petulance, nor
fraud, nor in a tumultuous manner, but under the pressure of necessity,
could not justly on that account be charged with a capital offence.
Should it be objected that the thing was of bad example, I admit it; but
when the object is to rescue one’s life from injury, violence, or
robbery, provided it be done without offence or harm to any one,
necessity excuses it. It cannot be charged upon Paul as a crime, that
when in danger of his life at Damascus, he was let down by a basket,
seeing he was divinely permitted to escape, without tumult, from the
violence and cruelty of wicked men.  <span
id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md)

<span id="v.i-p97"></span><span id="v.i-p97.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p98"></span>**24.** *And they said unto Joshua,* etc. This
passage shows that Joshua was not mistaken in selecting his spies; for
their language proves them to have been right-hearted men possessed of
rare integrity. Others, perhaps, not recovered from the terror into
which they had once been thrown, would have disturbed the whole camp,
but these, while they reflect on the wonderful kindness of God,
displayed in their escape from danger, and the happy issue of their
expedition, exhort Joshua and the people to go boldly forward. And
although the mere promise of possessing the land ought to have been
sufficient, yet the Lord is so very indulgent to their weakness, that,
for the sake of removing all doubt, he confirms what he had promised by
experience. That the Lord had not spoken in vain, was proved by the
consternation of the nations, when it began already to put them to
flight., and to drive them out, as if hornets had been sent in upon
them. For they argue in the same way as Rahab had done, that the land
was given to them, as the inhabitants had almost fainted away from fear.
I have therefore used the illative particle *for*, though the literal
meaning is, *and also.* But it is sufficiently plain, that in the other
way there is a confirmation of what they had said. And, indeed, the
courage of all melted away, as if they felt themselves routed by the
hand of God.

<span id="v.i-p4"></span> Calvin’s “<span id="v.i-p4.1"></span>miserat,”
“had sent,” is in accordance with his opinion, that the spies had been
sent some time before the transactions with which the first chapter
concludes actually took place, but is not justifed either by the Hebrew
or by the Septuagint, which has simply <span
id="v.i-p4.2"></span>ἀπέστειλεν. It is worthy of remark, however, that
Luther’s German agrees with Calvin, and renders “<span
id="v.i-p4.3"></span>hatte zween funtidchafter heimlich ausgefaubt von
Gittim;” “had sent out two spies secretly from Sittim.” The mention of
the place, Sittim or Shittim, occurs in the French version, but is
omitted without explanation in Calvin’s Latin. It was situated in the
plains of Moab near the left bank of the Jordan, and is particularly
mentioned in <span id="v.i-p4.4"></span>[Nu
25:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#001.md)<span id="v.i-p4.4"></span> as
the abode of the Israelites, when they allowed themselves to be seduced
into gross idolatry by the daughters of Moab, and were in consequence
signally punished. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_31"></span>[32](cc07004.htm#fr_31.md) <span
id="v.i-p4.5"></span>

<span id="v.i-p5"></span> This word “clam” may refer either to the
secrecy of Joshua in sending the spies, or to the secrecy which they
were to employ in making their inquiries. Either meaning seems good. The
latter is countenanced by the Septuagint, which unites the secrecy and
the spying in the single compound word <span
id="v.i-p5.1"></span>κατασκοπεῦσαι; but it is evident, both from the
version and the Commentary, that Calvin prefers the former. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_32"></span>[33](cc07004.htm#fr_32.md) <span
id="v.i-p56.2"></span>

<span id="v.i-p57"></span> In the present instance they set no limits to
their extravagances, and gravely tell us, that instead of leading a life
of infamy, she was merely an innkeeper or “hostess,” and was afterwards
honored to be the wife of Joshua. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_33"></span>[34](cc07004.htm#fr_33.md) <span
id="v.i-p63.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p64"></span> Had the season of the year when these
transactions took place not been known from other sources, the mode of
concealment to which Rahab resorted would have gone far to fix it. The
“stalks of flax” with which she covered them, was evidently the crop of
flax as it had been taken from the ground after attaining maturity, and
laid out in the open air to dry, agreeably to a custom still practiced,
before it was subjected to the process of *skutching*, for the purpose
of being deprived of its woody fiber. The flax sown about the end of
September was pulled in the end of March or beginning of April, which
accordingly was the period when the Israelites began to move their camp.
— *Ed.*

<span id="fn_34"></span>[35](cc07004.htm#fr_34.md) <span
id="v.i-p65.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p66"></span> It may either mean that “they” (the
Israelites) “had conspired,” as here translated, or as the French has
it, that “Rahab had conspired,” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_35"></span>[36](cc07004.htm#fr_35.md) <span
id="v.i-p67.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p68"></span> Latin, “<span id="v.i-p68.1"></span>Nullum in
proditione fuit crimen;” literally, “there was no crime in the
treachery.” French, “<span id="v.i-p68.2"></span>Il n’y a point eu de
crime de trahison en ce faict;” “There was no crime of treachery in the
act.” Neither of these properly conveys Calvin’s meaning. From what
follows it is evident that he held all treachery to be criminal as
implying a deviation from truth; while he also held, that under the
special circumstances Rahab was justified in withdrawing her allegiance
from her countrymen and transferring it to the Israelites. He therefore
only justifies the *act* without approving of the *mode* of it. This
view appears to be accurately expressed by the term “abandoning,” which
has accordingly been substituted in the translation. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_36"></span>[37](cc07004.htm#fr_36.md) <span
id="v.i-p69.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p70"></span> Latin, “<span id="v.i-p70.1"></span>Mendacium
officiosum.” French, “<span id="v.i-p70.2"></span>Le mensonge qui tend
au profit du prochain;” “The lie which tends to our neighbor’s profit.”
The <span id="v.i-p70.3"></span>*mendacium officiosum* is an expression
of frequent use among the Casuists, and properly means, “a lie which it
may be an act of duty to tell.” One of the most common instances given
is the case in which a simple statement of the truth might essentially
endanger the interest, or, it may be, the life of an individual whom we
are under a natural or conventional obligation to defend from all
injury. A son, for example, is pursued by murderers; he takes shelter
under the paternal roof; his mother has just succeeded in concealing him
when the murderers arrive. Is she entitled to give a false answer to
their interrogatories? The question is one of the most difficult and
delicate that can be raised; but Calvin has undoubtedly given the right
decision when he lays down the broad principle, that those who hold any
lie to be excusable, “do not sufficiently consider how precious truth is
in the sight of God.” Were anything necessary to reconcile us to this
decision, we may easily find it in the havoc which has been made of all
morality by acting on its opposite, as evinced particularly in the case
of Jesuit and other Romish casuists. — *Ed.*

<span id="v.i-p78"></span> French, “<span id="v.i-p78.1"></span>Et y a

dont le cause n’apparoit point; (car ils les appeloyent Epouvantemens
Paniques;) aussi ils faisoyent voeus a un Juppiter qu’ils appeloyent
Stator, c’est a dire Arrestant; et a une deesse qu’ils nommoyent Pavor,
c’est a dire Peur afin que les armees tinssent bon, et ne s’en fuissent
de peur;” “And there was a common proverb among them to denote the
sudden alarms of which the cause does not appear; for they called them
Panic Terrors; in like manner they made vows to a Jupiter, whom they
called Stator, that is, Staying; and to a goddess whom they named
*Pavor*, that is Fear, in order that armies might stand good, and not
flee from fear.” — *Ed.*

<span id="v.i-p83"></span> French, “<span id="v.i-p83.1"></span>Que Dieu
estoit le principal conducteur de l’entreprise du peuple d’Israel, et
qu’il marchoit avec iceluy;” “That God was the principal conductor of
the enterprise of the people of Israel, and that he was marching along
with them.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_40"></span>[41](cc07004.htm#fr_40.md) <span
id="v.i-p94.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p95"></span> This is an instance of the quiet and almost
sly humor which occasionally betrays itself in Calvin’s other writings,
and shows, that had it comported with the general gravity of his
character, he might easily have added wit to the other weapons with
which he fought the battles of the faith. In private life, when greater
freedom was allowable, it appears, according to Beza’s statement, to
have not infrequently contributed to the charm of his conversations. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_41"></span>[42](cc07004.htm#fr_41.md) <span
id="v.i-p95.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p96"></span> The whole objection, as to the overleaping of
walls, is so ridiculous in itself, and so very inapplicable to the
circumstances of all parties at the time, that it is difficult to
understand why Calvin should have condescended to notice it at all, or,
at least, given himself so much trouble to refute it. If one might
hazard a conjecture, it would be that some question of a similar nature
had been raised in regard to the walls of Geneva, and given a local
interest to a discussion which otherwise seems somewhat out of place. —
*Ed.*
