<span id="xxii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 19

<span id="xxii.i"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p1"></span><span id="xxii.i-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
19:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#001.md)<span id="xxii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And the second lot came forth to
Simeon, *even* for the tribe of the children of Simeon according to
their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the
children of Judah.

<span id="xxii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Egressa est autem sors secunda ipsi
Simeon, tribui filiorum Simeon per familias suas: et fuit haereditas
eorum in medio haereditatis filiorum Jehuda.

<span id="xxii.i-p4"></span>**2.** And they had in their inheritance
Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,

<span id="xxii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Fuitque eis in haereditate eorum
Beer-seba, et Seba, et Moladah,

<span id="xxii.i-p6"></span>**3.** And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,

<span id="xxii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et Hasar-sual, et Balah, et Asen,

<span id="xxii.i-p8"></span>**4.** And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

<span id="xxii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et Eltholad, et Bethul, et Hormah,

<span id="xxii.i-p10"></span>**5.** And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and
Hazarsusah,

<span id="xxii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et Siclag, et Beth-Marcaboth, et
Hasarsusa,

<span id="xxii.i-p12"></span>**6.** And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen;
thirteen cities and their villages:

<span id="xxii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et Beth-Lebaoth, et Saruhen: urbes
tredecim, et villae earum.

<span id="xxii.i-p14"></span>**7.** Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan;
four cities and their villages:

<span id="xxii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Aim, Rimmon, et Ether, et Asan:
urbes quatuor, et villae earum.

<span id="xxii.i-p16"></span>**8.** And all the villages that *were*
round about these cities to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This *is*
the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Simeon according to
their families.

<span id="xxii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et omnes villae quae erant per
circuitus urbium istarum usque ad Baalath-beer, Ramath Australem. Ista
est haereditas tribus filiorum Simeon per familias suas.

<span id="xxii.i-p18"></span>**9.** Out of the portion of the children
of Judah *was* the inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part
of the children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the children
of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of them.

<span id="xxii.i-p19"></span>**9.** De portione filiorum Jehuda facta
fuit haereditas filiorum Simeon: erat enim portio filiorum Jehuda major
ipsis; itaque haereditatem acceperunt filii Simeon in medio haereditatis
eorum.

<span id="xxii.i-p20"></span> 

<span id="xxii.i-p21"></span><span id="xxii.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p22"></span>Next followed the lot of the tribe of
Simeon, not as a mark of honor, but rather as a mark of disgrace. Jacob
had declared with regard to Simeon and Levi, “I will divide them in
Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.” (<span id="xxii.i-p22.1"></span>[Ge
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007)<span id="xxii.i-p22.1"></span>.md)
The punishment of Levi, indeed, was not only mitigated, but converted
into an excellent dignity, inasmuch as his posterity were placed on a
kind of watch-towers to keep the people in the paths of piety. In regard
to Simeon, the dispersion of which Jacob prophesied, manifestly took
place when certain cities within the territory of Judah were assigned to
his posterity for their inheritance. For although they were not sent off
to great distances, yet they dwelt dispersed, and as strangers in a land
properly belonging to another. Therefore, on account of the slaughter
which they had perpetrated with no less perfidy than cruelty, they were
placed separately in different abodes. In this way the guilt of the
father was visited upon his children, and the Lord ratified in fact that
sentence which he had dictated to his servant. The truth of the lot also
was clearly proven.

<span id="xxii.i-p23"></span>In the circumstance of a certain portion
being withdrawn from the family of Judah, we again perceive that though
the dividers had carefully endeavored to observe equity, they had fallen
into error, which they were not ashamed to correct as soon as it was
discovered. And though they were guided by the Spirit, there is nothing
strange in their having been partially mistaken, because God sometimes
leaves his servants destitute of the spirit of judgment, and suffers
them to act like men on different occasions, that they may not plume
themselves too much on their clear-sightedness. We may add that the
people were punished for their carelessness and confident haste, because
they ought at the outset to have ascertained more accurately how much
land could be properly assigned to each. This they neglected to do.
Through their unskillful procedure, the children of Judah had received a
disproportion accumulation of territory, and equity required that they
should relinquish a part. It would also have been better for themselves
to have their limits fixed with certainty at once than to be subjected
to a galling spoliation afterwards. Add that each tribe had indulged the
vain hope that its members would dwell far and wide, as if the land had
been of unlimited extent.

<span id="xxii.i-p24"></span><span id="xxii.i-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p25"></span>**9.** *Out of the portion of the children
of Judah,* etc The praise of moderation is due to the tribe of Judah for
not contending that the abstraction of any part of the inheritance
already assigned to them was unjust. They might easily have obtruded the
name of God, and asserted that it was only by his authority they had
obtained that settlement. But as it is decided by the common consent of
all the tribes that more has been given to them than they can possess
without loss and injury to the others, they immediately desist from all
pretext for disputing the matter. And it is certain that if they had
alleged the authority of God, it would have been falsely and wickedly,
inasmuch as though their lot had been determined by him in regard to its
situation, an error had taken place with regard to its extent, their
limits having been fixed by human judgment wider than they ought.
Therefore, acknowledging that it would have been wrong to give them what
would occasion loss to others, they willingly resign it, and give a
welcome reception to their brethren, who must otherwise have remained
without inheritance, nay, submit to go shares with them in that which
they supposed they had acquired beyond controversy.

<span id="xxii.ii"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
19:10-31](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010.md)<span
id="xxii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p2"></span>**10.** And the third lot came up for the
children of Zebulun according to their families: and the border of their
inheritance was unto Sarid:

<span id="xxii.ii-p3"></span>**10.** Ascendit autem sors tertia filiis
Zabulon per familias suas: et fuit terminus haereditatis eorum usque ad
Sarid.

<span id="xxii.ii-p4"></span>**11.** And their border went up toward the
sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river
that *is* before Jokneam;

<span id="xxii.ii-p5"></span>**11.** Ascenditque terminus eorum ad mare:
et Maralah, et pertingit ad Dabbaseth: pervenitque ad flumen quod est e
regione Jocneam.

<span id="xxii.ii-p6"></span>**12.** And turned from Sarid eastward
toward the sunrising unto the border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth
out to Daberath, and goeth up to Japhia,

<span id="xxii.ii-p7"></span>**12.** Revertiturque a Sarid ad orientem,
id est, ad ortum solis, ad terminum Chisloth-Thabor, et illinc egreditur
ad Dobrath, et ascendit in Japhia.

<span id="xxii.ii-p8"></span>**13.** And from thence passes on along on
the east to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar
to Neah;

<span id="xxii.ii-p9"></span>**13.** Inde praeterea transit ad orientem,
ad ortum, ad Githah-Hepher, et ad Ihtah-casin: et illinc exit in Rimmon,
et gyrat ad Neah:

<span id="xxii.ii-p10"></span>**14.** And the border compasseth it on
the north side to Hannathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the valley
of Jiphthahel:

<span id="xxii.ii-p11"></span>**14.** Gyrat item idem terminus ab
aquilone ad Hannathon: suntque egressus ejus ad vallem Iphthael.

<span id="xxii.ii-p12"></span>**15.** And Kattath, and Nahallal, and
Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

<span id="xxii.ii-p13"></span>**15.** Et Catthath, et Nahalal, et
Simron, et Idalah, et Bethlehem: urbes duodecim, et villae earum.

<span id="xxii.ii-p14"></span>**16.** This *is* the inheritance of the
children of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their
villages.

<span id="xxii.ii-p15"></span>**16.** Haec est haereditas filiorum
Zabulon per familias suas: urbes istae, et villae earum.

<span id="xxii.ii-p16"></span>**17.** *And* the fourth lot came out to
Issachar, for the children of Issachar according to their families.

<span id="xxii.ii-p17"></span>**17.** Ipsi Issachar egressa est sors
quarta, filiis inquam, Issachar per familias suas.

<span id="xxii.ii-p18"></span>**18.** And their border was toward
Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,

<span id="xxii.ii-p19"></span>**18.** Et fuit terminus eorum Jezrael, et
Chesuloth, et Sunem,

<span id="xxii.ii-p20"></span>**19.** And Hapharaim, and Shion, and
Anaharath,

<span id="xxii.ii-p21"></span>**19.** Et Hapharaim, et Sion, et
Anaharath,

<span id="xxii.ii-p22"></span>**20.** And Rabbith, and Kishion, and
Abez,

<span id="xxii.ii-p23"></span>**20.** Et Rabbith, et Cicion, et Abeth,

<span id="xxii.ii-p24"></span>**21.** And Remeth, and Engannim, and
Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;

<span id="xxii.ii-p25"></span>**21.** Et Remeth, et Engannin, et
Enhaddah, et Beth-passes.

<span id="xxii.ii-p26"></span>**22.** And the coast reacheth to Tabor,
and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were
at Jordan: sixteen cities with their villages.

<span id="xxii.ii-p27"></span>**22.** Et pervenit terminus in Thabor, et
Sahasima, et Beth-semes: eruntque exitus termini eorum ad Jordanem:
urbes sedecim, et villae earum.

<span id="xxii.ii-p28"></span>**23.** This *is* the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Issachar according to their families, the
cities and their villages.

<span id="xxii.ii-p29"></span>**23.** Haec est haereditas tribus
filiorum Issachar per familias suas: urbes et villae earum.

<span id="xxii.ii-p30"></span>**24.** And the fifth lot came out for the
tribe of the children of Asher according to their families.

<span id="xxii.ii-p31"></span>**24.** Egressa est autem sors quinta
tribui filiorum Aser per familias suas.

<span id="xxii.ii-p32"></span>**25.** And their border was Helkath, and
Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,

<span id="xxii.ii-p33"></span>**25.** Fuitque terminus eorum Helcath, et
Hali, et Bethen, et Achsaph,

<span id="xxii.ii-p34"></span>**26.** And Alammelech, and Amad, and
Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;

<span id="xxii.ii-p35"></span>**26.** Et Alamelech, et Amad, et Misal,
et pervenit in Carmel ad mare, et in Sihor Libnath.

<span id="xxii.ii-p36"></span>**27.** And turns toward the sunrising to
Bethdagon, and reacheth to Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel
toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on
the left hand,

<span id="xxii.ii-p37"></span>**27.** Et revertitur ad ortum solis in
Beth-dagon, et pervenit in Zabulon, et in vallem Iphtahel ad aquilonem,
et in Beth-emec, et Neel: et exit ad Chabul a sinistra.

<span id="xxii.ii-p38"></span>**28.** And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon,
and Kanah, *even* unto great Zidon;

<span id="xxii.ii-p39"></span>**28.** Et Ebron, et Rehob, et Hamon, et
Canah, usque ad Sidon magnam:

<span id="xxii.ii-p40"></span>**29.** And *then* the coast turns to
Ramah, and to the strong city Tyre; and the coast turns to Hosah; and
the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:

<span id="xxii.ii-p41"></span>**29.** Revertiturque terminus in Rama,
usque ad urbem munitam petrae: inde revertitur terminus in Hosah:
suntque exitus ejus ad mare a funiculo Achzib,

<span id="xxii.ii-p42"></span>**30.** Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob:
twenty and two cities with their villages.

<span id="xxii.ii-p43"></span>**30.** Et Ummah, et Aphec, et Rehob:
urbes viginti duae, et villae earum.

<span id="xxii.ii-p44"></span>**31.** This *is* the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Asher according to their families, these cities
with their villages.

<span id="xxii.ii-p45"></span>**31.** Haec est haereditas tribus
filiorum Aser per familias suas: urbes istae, et villae earum.

<span id="xxii.ii-p46"></span> 

<span id="xxii.ii-p47"></span><span id="xxii.ii-p47.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p48"></span>**10.** *And the third lot came up,* etc
In the lot of Zebulun there is a clear fulfillment of the prophecy of
Jacob, which had foretold that they would dwell on the sea-coast. An old
man, an exile who could not set a foot on his own land,  <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) assigned a maritime district to the
posterity of his son Zebulun. What could be more extravagant? But now,
when the lot assigns them a maritime region, no clearer confirmation of
his decision could be desired. It was just as if God were twice
thundering from heaven. The tribe of Zebulun, therefore, do not occupy
the shore of their own accord or by human suffrage, but a divine
arrangement fixes their habitation contiguous to the sea. Thus, although
men erred, still the light was always seen shining brightly in the
darkness. Jacob goes farther, and makes a clear distinction between
Zebulun and Issachar. The former tribe will travel far and wide,
carrying on trade and commerce; the latter remaining in his tents, will
cultivate ease and a sedentary life. (<span
id="xxii.ii-p49.2"></span>[Ge
49:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#013.md)<span
id="xxii.ii-p49.2"></span>) Hence it is probable that the sea-coast
where Zebulun settled, was provided with harbors and well adapted for
the various forms of commercial intercourse,  <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) whereas the children of Issachar were
contented with their own produce, and consumed the fruits which they had
raised by their own labor and culture at home.

<span id="xxii.ii-p51"></span>Those who are thought to be well
acquainted with these countries, affirm that the land of the tribe of
Asher was fertile in corn.  <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) This
is in complete accordance both with the letter and the spirit of Jacob’s
prophecy. (<span id="xxii.ii-p52.1"></span>[Ge
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#020)<span id="xxii.ii-p52.1"></span>.md)
From the fact that only a small number of cities are designated by name,
we may infer that there were then many ruined cities which were not
taken into account, and from the other fact that the people dwelt
commodiously, we may also infer that they built many cities, with which
it is plain from other passages that the land was adorned. And it is
certainly apparent that only a summary of the division is briefly
glanced at, and that thus many things were omitted which no religious
feeling forbids us to investigate, provided we do not indulge in an
excessive curiosity leading to no beneficial result. There cannot be a
doubt that those to whom twenty or even only seventeen cities are
attributed, had more extensive territories. Therefore, all we have here
is a compendious description of the division as it was taken from the
general and confused notes of the surveyors.

<span id="xxii.ii-p53"></span><span id="xxii.ii-p53.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p54"></span>The next lot mentioned is that of
Naphtali, and it seems to correspond with the disposition and manners of
that tribe. For Jacob had testified, Naphtali is a hind let loose; he
gave goodly words. For this reason they seem to have been contiguous on
one side to the children of Judah, and to have been surrounded on other
sides by the enclosures of their brethren.  <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) Indeed, in its being said that the
tribe of Dan took Lesen, there seems to be a tacit comparison, because
the children of Naphtali did not employ arms to force their way into
their inheritance, but kept themselves quietly in a subdued territory,
and thus enjoyed safety and tranquillity under the faith, and, as it
were, protection of Judah and the other tribes. The capture of Lesen by
the children of Dan, in accordance with the divine grant which they had
received of it, did not take place till after the death of Joshua. But
the fact which is more fully detailed in the book of Judges is here
mentioned in passing, because praise was due to them for their boldness
and activity in thus embracing the right which God had bestowed upon
them, and so trusting in him as to go down bravely and defeat the enemy.

<span id="xxii.iii"></span>

<span id="xxii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xxii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
19:32-51](../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#032.md)<span
id="xxii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.iii-p2"></span>**32.** The sixth lot came out to the
children of Naphtali, *even* for the children of Naphtali according to
their families.

<span id="xxii.iii-p3"></span>**32.** Filiis Nephtali exivit sors sexta,
filiis inquam, Nephtali, per familias suas.

<span id="xxii.iii-p4"></span>**33.** And their coast was from Heleph,
from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and
the outgoings thereof were at Jordan:

<span id="xxii.iii-p5"></span>**33.** Fuitque terminus eorum ab Heleph,
et ab Elon in Saanannim, et Adami, Neceb, et Jabneel, usque ad Lacum:
suntque exitus ejus ad Jordanem.

<span id="xxii.iii-p6"></span>**34.** And *then* the coast turns
westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and
reacheth to Zebulun on the south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west
side, and to Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.

<span id="xxii.iii-p7"></span>**34.** Postea revertitur terminus ad mare
ad Aznoth-thabor: et progreditur illinc in Huccoc, et pervenit ad
Zabulon a meridie, et ad Aser pervenit ab occidente, et ad Jehuda in
Jordanem, ad ortum solis.

<span id="xxii.iii-p8"></span>**35.** And the fenced cities *are*
Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth,

<span id="xxii.iii-p9"></span>**35.** Et urbes munitae, Siddim, Ser, et
Hammath, Raccath, et Chinnereth.

<span id="xxii.iii-p10"></span>**36.** And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

<span id="xxii.iii-p11"></span>**36.** Et Adamah, et Ramah, et Hasor,

<span id="xxii.iii-p12"></span>**37.** And Kedesh, and Edrei, and
Enhazor,

<span id="xxii.iii-p13"></span>**37.** Et Cedes, et Hedrei, et En-Hasor,

<span id="xxii.iii-p14"></span>**38.** And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem,
and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities with their villages.

<span id="xxii.iii-p15"></span>**38.** Et Iron, et Migdal-el, Horem, et
Beth-anath, et Beth-semes: urbes novemdecim, et villae earum.

<span id="xxii.iii-p16"></span>**39.** This *is* the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Naphtali according to their families, the
cities and their villages.

<span id="xxii.iii-p17"></span>**39.** Haec est haereditas tribus
filiorum Nephtali per familias suas, urbes istae et villae earum.

<span id="xxii.iii-p18"></span>**40.** *And* the seventh lot came out
for the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families.

<span id="xxii.iii-p19"></span>**40.** Tribui filiorum Dan per familias
suas exivit sors septima.

<span id="xxii.iii-p20"></span>**41.** And the coast of their
inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh,

<span id="xxii.iii-p21"></span>**41.** Fuitque terminus haereditatis
eorum, Sorah, et Esthaol, et Itsemes,

<span id="xxii.iii-p22"></span>**42.** And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and
Jethlah,

<span id="xxii.iii-p23"></span>**42.** Et Saalabbin, et Ajalon, et
Ithlah,

<span id="xxii.iii-p24"></span>**43.** And Elon, and Thimnathah, and
Ekron,

<span id="xxii.iii-p25"></span>**43.** Et Elon, et Thimnathah, et Ecron,

<span id="xxii.iii-p26"></span>**44.** And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and
Baalath,

<span id="xxii.iii-p27"></span>**44.** Et Elthece, et Gibbethon, et
Baalath,

<span id="xxii.iii-p28"></span>**45.** And Jehud, and Beneberak, and
Gathrimmon,

<span id="xxii.iii-p29"></span>**45.** Et Jehud, et Bene-berak, et
Gath-rimon,

<span id="xxii.iii-p30"></span>**46.** And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with
the border before Japho.

<span id="xxii.iii-p31"></span>**46.** Et Mehajarcon, et Raccon, cum
termino contra Japho.

<span id="xxii.iii-p32"></span>**47.** And the coast of the children of
Dan went out *too little* for them: therefore the children of Dan went
up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of
the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan,
after the name of Dan their father.

<span id="xxii.iii-p33"></span>**47.** Et exivit terminus filiorum Dan
ab eis ascenderuntque filii Dan, et pugnaverunt cum Lesem, ceperuntque
eam, ac percusserunt eam acie gladii, et haereditate acceperunt eam,
habitaveruntque in ea: et vocaverunt Lesem Dan, secundum nomen Dan
patris sui.

<span id="xxii.iii-p34"></span>**48.** This *is* the inheritance of the
tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities
with their villages.

<span id="xxii.iii-p35"></span>**48.** Haec est haereditas tribus
filiorum Dan per familias suas, civitates istae, et villae earum.

<span id="xxii.iii-p36"></span>**49.** When they had made an end of
dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of
Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun among them:

<span id="xxii.iii-p37"></span>**49.** Quum autem finem fecissent
partiendi terram ut possiderent singuli terminos suos, dederunt filii
Israel haereditatem ipsi Josue filio Nun in medio sui.

<span id="xxii.iii-p38"></span>**50.** According to the word of the LORD
they gave him the city which he asked, *even* Timnathserah in mount
Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt therein.

<span id="xxii.iii-p39"></span>**50.** Secundum sermonem Jehovae
dederunt ei urbem quam petivit, Thimnath-serah in monte Ephraim, et
edificavit urbem, habitavitque in ea.

<span id="xxii.iii-p40"></span>**51.** These *are* the inheritances,
which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of
the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an
inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the
country.

<span id="xxii.iii-p41"></span>**51.** Istae sunt haereditates quas
tradiderunt possidendas Eleazar sacerdos, et Josue filius Nun, et
principes patrum tribuum filiorum Israel per sortem in Silo coram Jehova
ad ostiam tabernaculi conventionis, et finem fecerunt dividendi terram.

<span id="xxii.iii-p42"></span> 

<span id="xxii.iii-p43"></span><span id="xxii.iii-p43.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.iii-p44"></span>**49.** *When they had made an end of
dividing,* etc We have here, at length, an account of the gratitude of
the people towards Joshua. For although the partition of the land of
Canaan, among the posterity of Abraham, behooved to be equitable, yet
Joshua, by his excellent virtues, deserved some honorary reward. Nor
could any complain that a single individual was enriched at their
expense. For, first, in the delay there was a striking proof of the
moderation of this holy servant of God. He does not give any heed to his
own interest till the commonweal has been secured. How seldom do we find
any who, after they have given one or two specimens of valor, do not
forthwith make haste to the prey? Not so Joshua, who thinks not of
himself till the land has been divided. In the reward itself also the
same temperance and frugality are conspicuous. The city he asks to be
given to himself and his family was a mere heap of stones, either
because it had been demolished and converted into a heap of ruins, or
because no city had yet been built upon it.

<span id="xxii.iii-p45"></span>It is conjectured with probability, that
with the view of making the grant as little invidious as possible, the
city he requested was of no great value. If any one thinks it strange
that he did not give his labor gratuitously, let him reflect that Joshua
liberally obeyed the divine call, and had no mercenary feelings in
undergoing so many labors, dangers, and troubles; but having
spontaneously performed his duty, he behooved not to repudiate a
memorial of the favor of God, unless he wished by perverse contempt to
suppress his glory. For the grant voted to him was nothing else than a
simple testimonial of the divine power, which had been manifested
through his hand. Truly no ambition can be detected here, inasmuch as he
desires nothing for himself, and does not rashly act from a feeling of
covetousness, but seeks in the popular consent a confirmation of the
honor which God had already bestowed upon him. To have been silent in
such a case, would have been more indicative of heartlessness than of
modesty. The statement in the concluding verse of the chapter, that
Joshua and Eleazar made an end of dividing the land, points to the
perpetuity of the boundaries, which had been fixed, and warns the
children of Israel against moving in any way to unsettle an inviolable
decree.

pas un pied de terre a luy ou il peust marcher;” “Being an old man, a
poor exile, who had not a foot of land of his own on which he could
walk.” — *Ed.*

<span id="xxii.ii-p50"></span> The extent of coast possessed by Zebulun
was of very limited extent, but included the large and beautiful bay of
Acre, which commences in the north at the promontory on which the town
of Acre stands, and is terminated magnificently in the south by the
lofty heights of Mount Carmel. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_169"></span>[170](cc07021.htm#fr_169.md) <span

<span id="xxii.ii-p52"></span> The greater part of it consisted of a
rich and undulating plain, diversified by gentle hills, well watered by
the Leontes and other streams which derived their supplies from the
snowy heights of Lebanon, and sloping gradually to that part of the
sea-coast, on which were built the famous cities of Tyre and Sidon.
According to Clarke, the plain of Asher and Zebulun bore a considerable
resemblance to the southern districts of England. — *Ed.*

<span id="xxii.ii-p55"></span> The tribe of Naphtali, as marked out by
Joshua, Eleazar, and the heads of the tribes, harmonizes well with the
figurative description of it given by Jacob, for both in scenery and
fertility it is one of the fairest in the Promised Land, but the
locality assigned to it in the Commentary is singularly inaccurate. In
the Latin it is said that the children of Naphtali “<span
id="xxii.ii-p55.1"></span>Videntur contigui ab una parte fuisse filiis
Juda: alibi autem cincti coste ils estoyent contigus aux enfans de Juda;
et d’autrepart qu’ils estoyent environnez du secours de leurs freres;”
“It seems that on one side that they were surrounded by the help of
their brethren.” The fact, however, is that Judah and Naphtali are at
the opposite extremities of the country, and so far from being
contiguous to each other, are widely separated by the intervention of no
fewer than five tribes, which commencing on the frontiers of Judah, and
proceeding northwards, are, in succession, Benjamin, Ephraim, Manasseh,
Issachar, and Zebulun. Then, as it stretched from the shores of the lake
of Gennesaret, north to the roots of Lebanon, it cannot well be said to
have been surrounded on all sides by the enclosures of other tribes. It
certainly had Zebulun on the south-west, and Asher on the west, but on
the north and east, it formed the extreme frontiers of the Promised
Land, and, of course, bounded with foreign and hostile settlements. —
*Ed.*
