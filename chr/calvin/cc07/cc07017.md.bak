<span id="xviii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 15

<span id="xviii.i"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p1"></span><span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
15:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#001.md)<span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p2"></span>**1.** *This* then was the lot of the tribe
of the children of Judah by their families; *even* to the border of Edom
the wilderness of Zin southward *was* the uttermost part of the south
coast.

<span id="xviii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Fuitque sors tribui filiorum Jehuda
per familias eorum juxta terminum Edom, et desertum Sin ad austrum ab
extremo austri.

<span id="xviii.i-p4"></span>**2.** And their south border was from the
shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:

<span id="xviii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Fuitque ejus terminus meridici ab
extremo maris salis, hoc est a petra quae respicit ad meridiem.

<span id="xviii.i-p6"></span>**3.** And it went out to the south side to
Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south
side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar,
and fetched a compass to Karkaa:

<span id="xviii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et egreditur versus meridiem
Maale-acrabim, et illinc transit in Sin: progrediens autem a meridie in
Cades-barnea transit illinc in Esron, et rursum ascendit in Adar, unde
circuit in Carcaa.

<span id="xviii.i-p8"></span>**4.** *From thence* it passed toward
Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that
coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.

<span id="xviii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Inde transit in Asmon, et egreditur
ad torrentem AEgypti: suntque egressus hujus termini ad occidentem: iste
erit vobis terminus ad meridiem.

<span id="xviii.i-p10"></span>**5.** And the east border *was* the salt
sea, *even* unto the end of Jordan. And *their* border in the north
quarter *was* from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:

<span id="xviii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Terminus vero ad orientem, est mare
salis usque ad extremitatem Jordanis, terminus autem anguli aquilonaris
a petra maris ab extremo Jordanis.

<span id="xviii.i-p12"></span>**6.** And the border went up to
Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border
went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:

<span id="xviii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Ascenditque terminus iste in
Beth-hoglah, et transit ab aquilone ad Betharaba, atque illinc ascendit
terminus iste ad lapidem Bohan filii Ruben.

<span id="xviii.i-p14"></span>**7.** And the border went up toward Debir
from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that
*is* before the going up to Adummim, which *is* on the south side of the
river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the
goings out thereof were at Enrogel:

<span id="xviii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Ascendit praeterea terminus iste in
Debir a valle Achor, et versus aquilonem respicit ad Gilgal, quae est e
regione ascensus Adummim, quae quidem est ab austro torrenti: et transit
terminus iste ad aquas En-semes, suntque exitus ejus ad En-rogel.

<span id="xviii.i-p16"></span>**8.** And the border went up by the
valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the
same *is* Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain
that *lieth* before the valley of Hinnom westward, which *is* at the end
of the valley of the giants northward:

<span id="xviii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et ascendit terminus iste ad vallem
filii Hinnom, ad latus Jebusaei a meridie, ipsa est Jerusalem: ascendit
insuper terminus iste ad verticem montis qui est e regione vallis Hinnom
ad occidentem, quae quidem est in extremitate vallis Rephaim ad
aquilonem.

<span id="xviii.i-p18"></span>**9.** And the border was drawn from the
top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out
to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which
*is* Kirjathjearim:

<span id="xviii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Circuit autem terminus a vertice
ipsius montis, ad fontem aquae Nephthoeh, et egreditur ad urbes montis
Ephron, circuitque terminus iste in Baala, ipsa est Cirjath-jearim.

<span id="xviii.i-p20"></span>**10.** And the border compassed from
Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount
Jearim, which *is* Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to
Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:

<span id="xviii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Et illinc gyrat terminus iste a
Baala ad occidentem ad montem Seir, et illinc pertransit ad latus montis
Jearim ab aquilone, ipsa est Chesalon, descenditque in Bethsemes, et
pertransit in Timna.

<span id="xviii.i-p22"></span>**11.** And the border went out unto the
side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed
along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of
the border were at the sea.

<span id="xviii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Egrediturque terminus ad latus
Ecron ad Aquilonem, et circuit terminus iste ad Sichron, pertransitque
ad montem Baala, et illinc egreditur in Jabneel, suntque exitus hujus
termini ad mare.

<span id="xviii.i-p24"></span>**12.** And the west border *was* to the
great sea, and the coast *thereof*. This *is* the coast of the children
of Judah round about according to their families.

<span id="xviii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Porro terminus occidentalis ad
mare magnum, et terminum, iste est terminus filiorum Jehuda per
circuitum, per familias suas.

<span id="xviii.i-p26"></span>**13.** And unto Caleb the son of
Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the
commandment of the LORD to Joshua, *even* the city of Arba the father of
Anak, which *city is* Hebron.

<span id="xviii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Caleb autem filio Jephune dedit
partem in medio filiorum Jehuda, secundum sermonem Jehovae ad Josue,
Cirjath-arba patris Anac, ipsa est Hebron.

<span id="xviii.i-p28"></span> 

<span id="xviii.i-p29"></span><span id="xviii.i-p29.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p30"></span>**1.** I have already premised, that I
would not be very exact in delineating the site of places, and in
discussing names, partly because I admit that I am not well acquainted
with topographical or chorographic science, and partly because great
labor would produce little fruit to the reader;  <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) nay, perhaps the greater part of
readers would toil and perplex themselves without receiving any benefit.
With regard to the subject in hand, it is to be observed, that the lot
of the tribe of Judah not only falls on elevated ground, the very
elevation of the territory, indicating the dignity of the future
kingdom, but a similar presage is given by its being the first lot that
turns up. What had already been obtained by arms, they begin to divide.
The names of the ten tribes are cast into the urn. Judah is preferred to
all the others. Who does not see that it is raised to the highest rank,
in order that the prophecy of Jacob may be fulfilled? Then within the
limits here laid down, it is well known that there were rich pastures,
and vineyards celebrated for their productiveness and the excellence of
their wines. In this way, while the lot corresponds with the prophecy of
Jacob, it is perfectly clear that it did not so happen by chance; the
holy patriarch had only uttered what was dictated by the Spirit.

<span id="xviii.i-p32"></span>If any are better skilled in places, a
more minute investigation will be pleasant and useful to them. But lest
those who are less informed feel it irksome to read unknown names, let
them consider that they have obtained knowledge of no small value,
provided they bear in mind the facts to which I have briefly and
summarily adverted — that the tribe of Judah was placed on elevated
ground, that it might be more conspicuous than the others, until the
scepter should arise from it — and that a region of fruitful vineyards
and rich pastures was assigned to his posterity — and, finally, all this
was done, in order that the whole people might recognize that there was
nothing of the nature of chance in the turning up of a lot, which had
been foretold three centuries before. Besides, it is easy for the
unlearned to infer from the long circuit described, that the territory
thus allocated to one tribe was of great extent.  <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) For although some diminution
afterwards took place, its dominions always continued to be the largest.

<span id="xviii.i-p34"></span>It is necessary, however, to bear in mind
what I formerly observed, that nothing else was determined by the lot
than that the boundary of the children of Judah was to be contiguous to
the land of Edom and the children of Sin, and that their boundary, in
another direction, was to be the river of Egypt and the Mediterranean
Sea — that those who had been selected to divide the country proceeded
according to the best of their judgment, in proportioning the quantity
of territory allotted to the number of their people, without extending
their boundaries any farther — and that they followed the same method in
other cases, as vicinity or other circumstances demanded.

<span id="xviii.i-p35"></span>Any error into which they fell, did not at
all affect the general validity of their decision. For as they were not
ashamed partly to recall any partition that might have been made without
sufficient consideration, so the people in their turn, while they
acknowledged that they had acted in the matter with the strictest good
faith and honesty, submitted the more willingly to whatever they
determined. Thus, notwithstanding any particular error, their general
arrangements received full effect.

<span id="xviii.i-p36"></span>It will be worth while to make one remark
on the city Jebus, whose name was afterwards Jerusalem. Although it had
been already chosen, by the secret counsel of God, for his sanctuary,
and the seat of the future kingdom, it however continued in the
possession of the enemy down to the time of David. In this long
exclusion from the place on which the sanctity, excellence, and glory of
the rest of the land were founded, there was a clear manifestation of
the divine curse inflicted to punish the people for their sluggishness:
since it was virtually the same as if the land had been deprived of its
principal dignity and ornament. But on the other hand, the wonderful
goodness of God was conspicuous in this, that the Jebusites who, from
the long respite which had been given them, seemed to have struck their
roots most deeply, were at length torn up, and driven forth from their
secure position.

<span id="xviii.i-p37"></span><span id="xviii.i-p37.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p38"></span>**13.** *And unto Caleb the son of
Jephunneh,* etc Were we to judge from the actual state of matters, it
would seem ridiculous repeatedly to celebrate an imaginary grant from
which Caleb received no benefit while Joshua was alive. But herein due
praise is given both to the truth of God, and to the faith of his saint
in resting on his promise. Therefore, although sneering men, and the
inhabitants of the place itself, if the rumor had reached them, might
have derided the vain solicitude of Caleb, and the empty liberality of
Joshua, the contempt thus expressed would only have proved them to be
presumptuous scoffers. God at length evinced the firmness of his decree
by the result, and Caleb, though he saw himself unable to obtain access
to the mountain, testified that he was contented with the mere promise
of God, the true exercise of faith, consisting in a willingness to
remain without the fruition of things which have been promised till the
period actually arrive. Moreover, this passage, and others similar to
it, teach us that the giants who are usually called Enakim, were so
named after their original progenitor, Enac, and that the word is hence
of Gentile origin. The time when Caleb routed the sons of Enac we shall
see in a short time. This passage also shows us that Caleb, when he
brought forward the name of Moses, did not make a mere pretence, or
utter anything that was not strictly true; for it is now plainly
declared, that Moses had so appointed, in conformity with the command of
God.

<span id="xviii.ii"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
15:14-63](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#014.md)<span
id="xviii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p2"></span>**14.** And Caleb drove thence the three
sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

<span id="xviii.ii-p3"></span>**14.** Expulit inde Caleb tres filios
Enac, Sezadi, et Ahiman, et Thalmai qui fuerunt filii Enac.

<span id="xviii.ii-p4"></span>**15.** And he went up thence to the
inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before *was* Kirjathsepher.

<span id="xviii.ii-p5"></span>**15.** Ascenditque inde ad habitatores
Debir, cujus nomen antea fuit Ciriath-sepher.

<span id="xviii.ii-p6"></span>**16.** And Caleb said, He that smiteth
Kirjathsepher, and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to
wife.

<span id="xviii.ii-p7"></span>**16.** Dixitque Caleb, qui percusserit
Ciriath-sepher, et ceperit eam, dabo ei Achsa filiam meam in uxorem.

<span id="xviii.ii-p8"></span>**17.** And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the
brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

<span id="xviii.ii-p9"></span>**17.** Cepit autem eam Othniel filius
Cenas fratris Caleb: deditque ei Achsa filiam suam in uxorem.

<span id="xviii.ii-p10"></span>**18.** And it came to pass, as she came
*unto him*, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she
lighted off *her* ass; and Caleb said unto her, What would thou?

<span id="xviii.ii-p11"></span>**18.** Fuitque quum veniret ipsa suasit
illi, ut peteret a patre suo agrum, et descendit de asino, dixitque ei
Caleb, Quid tibi est?

<span id="xviii.ii-p12"></span>**19.** Who answered, Give me a blessing;
for thou has given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And
he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.

<span id="xviii.ii-p13"></span>**19.** Illa respondit, Da mihi
benedictionem: quandoquidem terram aridam dedisti mihi, da mihi fontes
aquarum. Et dedit ei fontes superiores, et fontes inferiores.

<span id="xviii.ii-p14"></span>**20.** ¶ This *is* the inheritance of
the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.

<span id="xviii.ii-p15"></span>**20.** Ista est haereditas tribus
filiorum Jehuda per familias suas.

<span id="xviii.ii-p16"></span>**21.** And the uttermost cities of the
tribe of the children of Judah toward the coast of Edom southward were
Kabzeel, and Eder, and Jagur,

<span id="xviii.ii-p17"></span>**21.** Fuerunt autem urbes in
extremitate tribus filiorum Jehudae juxta terminum Edom ad meridiem,
Cabseel, et Eder, et Jagur.

<span id="xviii.ii-p104"></span>Here we have a narrative of what plainly
appears from the book of Joshua to have taken place subsequent to the
death of Joshua; but lest a question might have been raised by the
novelty of the procedure, in giving a fertile and well watered field as
the patrimony of a woman, the writer of the book thought proper to
insert a history of that which afterwards happened, in order that no
ambiguity might remain in regard to the lot of the tribe of Judah.
First, Caleb is said, after he had taken the city of Hebron, to have
attacked Debir or Ciriath-sepher, and to have declared, that the person
who should be the first to enter it, would be his son-in-law. And it
appears, that when he held out this rare prize to his fellow-soldiers
for taking the city, no small achievement was required. This confirms
what formerly seemed to be the case, that it was a dangerous and
difficult task which had been assigned him, when he obtained his
conditional grant. Accordingly, with the view of urging the bravest to
exert themselves, he promises his daughter in marriage as a reward to
the valor of the man who should first scale the wall.

<span id="xviii.ii-p105"></span>It is afterwards added that Othniel who
was his nephew by a brother, gained the prize by his valor. I know not
how it has crept into the common translation that he was a younger
brother of Caleb; for nothing in the least degree plausible can be said
in defense of the blunder. Hence some expositors perplex themselves very
unnecessarily in endeavoring to explain how Othniel could have married
his niece, since such marriage was forbidden by the law. It is easy to
see that he was not the uncle, but the cousin of his wife.

<span id="xviii.ii-p106"></span>But here another question arises, How
did Caleb presume to bargain concerning his daughter until he was made
acquainted with her inclinations?  <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) Although it is the office of parents
to settle their daughters in life, they are not permitted to exercise
tyrannical power and assign them to whatever husbands they think fit
without consulting them. For while all contracts ought to be voluntary,
freedom ought to prevail especially in marriage that no one may pledge
his faith against his will. But Caleb was probably influenced by the
belief that his daughter would willingly give her consent, as she could
not modestly reject such honorable terms;  <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) for the husband to be given her was no
common man, but one who should excel all others in warlike prowess. It
is quite possible, however, that Caleb in the heat of battle
inconsiderately promised what it was not in his power to perform. It
seems to me, however, that according to common law, the agreement
implied the daughter’s consent, and was only to take effect if it was
obtained.  <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) God certainly heard
the prayer of Caleb, when he gave him a son-in-law exactly to his mind.
For had the free choice been given him, there was none whom he would
have preferred.

<span id="xviii.ii-p110"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p110.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p111"></span>**18.** *And it came to pass as she came
unto him,* etc Although we may conjecture that the damsel Acsa was of
excellent morals and well brought up, as marriage with her had been held
forth as the special reward  <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) of
victory, yet perverse cupidity on her part is here disclosed. She knew
that by the divine law women were specially excluded from hereditary
lands, but she nevertheless covets the possession of them, and
stimulates her husband by unjust expostulation. In this way ambitious
and covetous wives cease not to molest their husbands until they force
them to forget shame, modesty, and equity. For although the avarice of
men also is insatiable, yet women are apt to be much more precipitate.
The more carefully ought husbands to be on their guard against being set
as it were on flame by the blast of such importunate counsels.  <span
id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md)

<span id="xviii.ii-p114"></span>But a greater degree of intemperance is
displayed when she acquires additional boldness from the facility of her
husband and the indulgence of her father. Not contented with the field
given to her, she demands for herself a well-watered district. And thus
it is when a person has once overleaped the bounds of rectitude and
honesty, the fault is forthwith followed up by impudence. Moreover, her
father in refusing her nothing gives proof of his singular affection for
her. But it does not therefore follow that the wicked thirst of gain
which blinds the mind and perverts right judgment is the less hateful.
In regard to Acsa’s dismounting from the ass, some interpreters ascribe
it to dissimulation and craft, as if she were pretending inability to
retain her seat from grief. In this way her dismounting or falling off
is made an indication of criminality and defective character. It is more
simple, however, to suppose that she placed herself at her father’s feet
with the view of accosting him as a suppliant. Be this as it may, by her
craft and flattery she gained his consent, and in so far diminished the
portion of her brothers.  <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md)

<span id="xviii.ii-p116"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p116.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p117"></span>**20.** *This is the inheritance,* etc
He had formerly, indeed, traced out the boundaries of the children of
Judah; but it is now shown for a different reason how large and fertile
the territory was which the Lord in his great liberality had bestowed
upon them. One hundred and thirteen cities with their towns and villages
are enumerated. The number attests not only the populousness, but also
the fertility of the country. And there cannot be a doubt that by the
divine blessing a new degree of fertility was imparted to it. The
goodness of God was, however, manifested in the very nature of the land
selected for his people, a land abounding in all kinds of advantages. If
we attend to the number of souls in the tribe, we shall find that one
half of the country would have been amply sufficient for their
habitation. For when eight hundred were allocated in each of the cities,
the remainder had the towns and the villages. It is no doubt true that a
portion was afterwards withdrawn and given to the tribe of Simeon. For
in this was accomplished the dispersion of which Jacob had prophesied,

<span id="xviii.ii-p118"></span>“I will divide them in Jacob, and
scatter them in Israel.”  
(<span id="xviii.ii-p118.2"></span>[Ge
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#007.md)<span
id="xviii.ii-p118.2"></span>)

<span id="xviii.ii-p119"></span>They were accordingly admitted by the
children of Judah as a kind of guests.

<span id="xviii.ii-p120"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p120.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p121"></span>**63.** *As for the Jebusites,* etc This
furnishes no excuse for the people, nor is it set down with that view;
for had they exerted themselves to the full measure of their strength,
and failed of success, the dishonor would have fallen on God himself,
who had promised that he would continue with them as their leader until
he should give them full and free possession of the land, and that he
would send hornets to drive out the inhabitants. Therefore, it was owing
entirely to their own sluggishness that they did not make themselves
masters of the city of Jerusalem. This they were not able to do; but
their own torpor, their neglect of the divine command from a love of
ease, were the real obstacles.

<span id="xviii.ii-p122"></span>This passage is deserving of notice: we
ought to learn from it to make vigorous trial of our strength in
attempting to accomplish the commands of God, and not to omit any
opportunity, lest while we are idly resting the door may be shut. A
moderate delay might have been free from blame; but a long period of
effeminate ease in a manner rejected the blessing which God was ready to
bestow.  <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md)

<span id="xviii.i-p31"></span> French, “<span

seroye point curieux a desrire ou peindre la situation des lieux, et a
espulcher tous les noms, en partie parce que je confesse franchement que
je ne suis pas bien exerce a faire descriptions de lieux ou de regions;
en partie d’autant que d’un grand travail qu’il faudroit prendre, il
n’en reviendroit que bien peu de fruict aux lecteurs;” “I have already
before this intimated that I would not be curious in describing or
painting the situation of places, and in expiscating all the names,
partly because, I frankly confess, that I am not much experienced in
making descriptions of places or countries, partly because from the
great labor which it would be necessary to take, very little benefit
would redound to the reader.” It may be added that these descriptions of
boundaries, how minutely soever they may be detailed, must, from their
very nature, leave a very vague impression on the mind of the most
careful reader, and are much less adapted for the ear than for the eye,
which, by a single glance at a map, furnishes information much more
vivid, distinct, and accurate than can be obtained from pages of
description. At the same time it ought to be remembered, that accurate
and detailed descriptions of the boundaries of the different tribes were
absolutely indispensable to the Israelites themselves, to whom they
formed a kind of title-deeds, vindicating their right of possession, and
securing them against encroachment. — *Ed.*

id="xviii.ii-p106.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p107"></span> If we are to indulge in conjectures on
the subject, this question might be answered by another, How do we know
that Caleb had not consulted her inclinations, and instead of resting
satisfied with the vague imaginings here ascribed to him, actually
obtained her consent to the proposal which he was about to make? It may
not have been, as Calvin supposes, a sudden thought which struck him in
the heat of battle, but a calm resolve formed before he set out on his
expedition against Debir, and intended to reward the most valiant of
those who had assisted him in his war against the giants. And it is even
not impossible that both he and his daughter, to whom Othniel, from his
near relationship, must have been well known, had no doubt from the
prowess he had previously exhibited, that he would outstrip all his
competitors and carry off the prize. These, of course, are mere
conjectures, but they are at least as plausible as those indulged in by
other expositors, who, after raising the question, appear to have given
themselves much unnecessary trouble in attempting to solve it. — *Ed.*

<span id="xviii.ii-p108"></span> French, “<span

“Because such a party and so honorable a condition could not be refused

id="xviii.ii-p108.2"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p109"></span> In other words, Caleb promises his
daughter not absolutely to the man who should take the city, but to the
man who, in addition to the prowess exerted in taking it, should also
have the address to gain the daughter’s consent. It is difficult to
believe that the promise made was either so meant by Caleb, or so
interpreted by his followers. He very probably and, as the event showed,
justly judged that his influence as a parent would either win or command
his daughter’s consent. — *Ed.*

bouillantes, et se laissent transporter plus aisement. Et d’autant plus
sogneusement les maris se doyvent donner garde, de peur que par leurs
conseils importuns, qui sont comme des soufflets, ils ne soyent

easily carried away. And so much the more carefully should husbands be
on their guard, lest by their importunate counsels, which are like
bellows, they be blown into flame.” — *Ed.*

par astuce et flatteries le droit d’autruy, et par ce moyen, la part et
portion de ses freres en fut d’autant amoindrie;” “Be this as it may,
this woman attracted to herself by craft and flattery the right of
another, and by this means the part and portion of her brothers was so
far lessened.” The censure here passed upon Achsah is rather more severe
than the circumstances seem to warrant. It ought to be remembered, that
in cases of succession the preference given to males is only
conventional, and that by natural law her brothers’ title was not a whit
better than her own. — *Ed.*

<span id="xviii.ii-p123"></span> Some of the Jewish expositors,
unwilling to admit the cowardice and sluggishness of their countrymen,
fable that the Jebusites were permitted to remain in possession because
they were descendants of Abimelech, and in consequence of the covenant
made between him and Abraham, (<span id="xviii.ii-p123.1"></span>[Gen.
