<span id="vii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="vii.i"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p1"></span><span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
4:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And it came to pass, when all the
people were clean passed over Jordan, that the LORD spoke unto Joshua,
saying,

<span id="vii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Et fuit, postquam finem fecit tota
gens trajiciendi Jordanis; quia loquutus erat Jehova ad Josuam, dicendo.

<span id="vii.i-p4"></span>**2.** Take you twelve men out of the people,
out of every tribe a man,

<span id="vii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Tollite vobis e populo duodecim viros
virum unum ex quaque tribu.

<span id="vii.i-p6"></span>**3.** And command you them, saying, Take you
hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests’
feet stood firm, twelve stones, and you shall carry them over with you,
and leave them in the lodging place, where you shall lodge this night.

<span id="vii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et praecipite illis dicendo: Tollite
vobis hinc e medio Jordanis a loco ubi stant pedes sacerdotum
expeditorum, duodecim lapides quos feretis vobiscum, et deponetis in
loco ubi hac nocte manebitis.

<span id="vii.i-p8"></span>**4.** Then Joshua called the twelve men,
whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a
man:

<span id="vii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Tunc vocavit Josue duodecim viros quos
ordinaverat e filiis Israel, singulos ex quaque tribu.

<span id="vii.i-p10"></span>**5.** And Joshua said unto them, Pass over
before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take
you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the
number of the tribes of the children of Israel:

<span id="vii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et dixit illis Josue, Transite ante
arcam Jehovae Dei vestri per medium Jordanis, et tollat quisque ex vobis
lapidem unum super humerum suum pro numero tribuum filiorum Israel.

<span id="vii.i-p12"></span>**6.** That this may be a sign among you,
*that* when your children ask *their fathers* in time to come, saying,
What *mean* you by these stones?

<span id="vii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Ut sit hoc inter vos (*vel*, in medio
vestri) signum quum interrogaverint filii vestri cras patres suos, quid
sunt lapides isti apud vos?

<span id="vii.i-p14"></span>**7.** Then you shall answer them, That the
waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the
LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and
these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for
ever.

<span id="vii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Tunc respondeatis eis, quod
intercisae fuerunt aquae Jordanis ante arcam foederis Jehovae, quum,
interquam, transiret Jordanem, intercisae fuerunt aquae Jordanis, tunc
facti fuerunt lapides iste in monumentum filiis Israel perpetuo.

<span id="vii.i-p16"></span>**8.** And the children of Israel did so as
Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan,
as the LORD spoke unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of
the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place
where they lodged, and laid them down there.

<span id="vii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Fecerunt itaque filii Israel sicut
praeceperat Josue, et sustulerunt duodecim lapides e medio Jordanis
sicut loquutus fuerat Jehova ad Josuam pro numero tribuum filiorum
Israel, tuleruntque eos secum ad locum ubi pernoctaverunt, et
reposuerunt illic.

<span id="vii.i-p18"></span>**9.** And Joshua set up twelve stones in
the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which
bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.

<span id="vii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Duodecim quoque lapides erexit Josue
in medio Jordanis sub statione pedum sacerdotum qui portabant arcam
foederis, manseruntque ibi usque in hunc diem.

<span id="vii.i-p20"></span> 

<span id="vii.i-p21"></span><span id="vii.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p22"></span>**l.** *And it came to pass,* etc The brief
and obscure allusion previously made with regard to the twelve men he
now explains more at length. He had said that they were chosen by the
order of God, one each from his own tribe; but breaking off his
discourse, he had not mentioned for what purpose. He now says, that by
command of Joshua  <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) they took up
twelve stones and placed them in Gilgal, that a well marked memorial
might exist among posterity. Moreover, as he only relates what was done
after the passage of the people, what is interposed should be
interpreted as in the pluperfect tense.  <span
id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) It is also very obvious that the copula
is used instead of the rational particle.  <span
id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) The substance is, that before the priests
moved their foot from the middle of the river where they stood, the
stones at their feet were taken and placed in Gilgal, to be perpetual
witnesses of the miracle, and that Joshua thus faithfully executed what
God had commanded. Joshua, therefore, called the men whom he had
previously chosen, but not without the command of God, that through it
he might have a stronger attestation to his authority. For had Joshua
raised up a trophy of that kind of his own accord, the piety which
dictated it might indeed have been laudable, but the admonition founded
only on the will of man might perhaps have been despised. But now when
God himself raises the sign, it is impious to pass it carelessly by. He
intimates, accordingly, that it was a monument deserving of the greatest
attention when he introduces the children asking, what mean these
stones?

<span id="vii.i-p26"></span><span id="vii.i-p26.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p27"></span>**7.** *Then you shall answer them,* etc
Although the stones themselves cannot speak, yet the monument furnished
the parents with materials for speaking, and for making the kindness of
God known to their children. And here zealous endeavors to propagate
piety are required of the aged,  <span id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md)
and they are enjoined to exert themselves in instructing their children.
For it was the will of God that this doctrine should be handed down
through every age; that those who were not then born being afterwards
instructed by their parents might become witnesses to it from hearing,
though they had not seen it with their eyes.

<span id="vii.i-p29"></span>The stones were placed according to the
number of the tribes, that each might be incited to gratitude by its own
symbol. It is true that two tribes and a half tribe who had obtained
their inheritance beyond the Jordan, had not, when considered apart from
the others, any occasion for making that passage. But as the land of
Canaan was possessed by the others for the common good of the whole race
of Abraham, so it behooved those who were all engaged in the same or a
common cause not to be separated from each other. And although as yet
mention had been made only of twelve men, it is obvious from a short
clause, that the divine command had been declared to the whole people;
for it is said that the children of Israel obeyed the words of Joshua.
Nay, it is even probable that deputies were elected by suffrage to carry
the stones in the name of the whole people.

<span id="vii.i-p30"></span><span id="vii.i-p30.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p31"></span>**9.** *And Joshua set up twelve stones,*
etc Apparently there was no use of stones under the water, and it may
therefore seem to have been absurd to bury stones at a depth. The others
which were placed in Gilgal being publicly visible, furnished occasion
for inquiry; but stones hidden from the eyes of men at the bottom of the
water could have no effect in inciting their minds. I admit that a
monument altogether buried in silence would have been useless.  <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) But when they talked among themselves of
the evidence of the passage left there, the hearing even of what they
did not see, strongly tended to confirm their faith. The ark of the
covenant was shut up in the sanctuary and covered by a veil placed over
against it, and yet its hidden splendor was not without benefit, when
they learned from the Law that the covenant of God was deposited in it.
It might also happen, that when the river was low, the tops of the heap
would sometimes appear. But what I have already said is more probable,
that though Joshua buried the stones in the middle of the stream, he did
a useful act by establishing a testimony in presence of the people,
which would afterwards become the subject of general conversation.

<span id="vii.ii"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p1"></span><span id="vii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
4:10-18](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#010.md)<span id="vii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p2"></span>**10.** For the priests which bare the ark
stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the
LORD commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that
Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.

<span id="vii.ii-p3"></span>**10.** Sacerdotes autem portantes arcam
stabant in medio Jordanis donec compleretur omnis sermo quem praeceperat
Jehova ad Josuam, ut diceret populo: prorsus ut praeceperat Moses ipsi
Josue: festinavit autem populus transeundo.

<span id="vii.ii-p4"></span>**11.** And it came to pass, when all the
people were clean passed over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and
the priests, in the presence of the people.

<span id="vii.ii-p5"></span>**11.** Quum vero transeundi finem fecisset
universus populus, transivit arca Jehovae, et sacerdotes coram populo.

<span id="vii.ii-p6"></span>**12.** And the children of Reuben, and the
children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed
before the children of Israel, as Moses spoke unto them:

<span id="vii.ii-p7"></span>**12.** Transierunt quoque filii Reuben, et
filii Gad, et dimidia tribus Manasse armati ante filios Israel:
quemadmodum loquutus fuerat ad eos Moses.

<span id="vii.ii-p8"></span>**13.** About forty thousand prepared for
war passed over before the LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

<span id="vii.ii-p9"></span>**13.** Quadraginta millia armatorum
transierunt coram Jehova ad praelium ad campestria Jericho.

<span id="vii.ii-p10"></span>**14.** On that day the LORD magnified
Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared
Moses, all the days of his life.

<span id="vii.ii-p11"></span>**14.** Eo die magnificavit Jehova Josuam
in oculis totius Israelis: et timuerunt eum quemad modum timuerant Mosen
omnibus diebus vitae ejus.

<span id="vii.ii-p12"></span>**15.** And the LORD spoke unto Joshua,
saying,

<span id="vii.ii-p13"></span>**15.** Loquutus est autem Jehova ad
Josuam, dicendo,

<span id="vii.ii-p14"></span>**16.** Command the priests that bear the
ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.

<span id="vii.ii-p15"></span>**16.** Praecipe sacerdotibus portantibus
arcam testimonii ut ascendant e Jordane.

<span id="vii.ii-p16"></span>**17.** Joshua therefore commanded the
priests, saying, Come you up out of Jordan.

<span id="vii.ii-p17"></span>**17.** Et praecepit Josue sacerdotibus,
dicendo, Ascendite ex Jordane.

<span id="vii.ii-p18"></span>**18.** And it came to pass, when the
priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out
of the midst of Jordan, *and* the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted
up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their
place, and flowed over all his banks, as *they did* before.

<span id="vii.ii-p19"></span>**18.** Porro quum ascendissent sacerdotes
portantes arcam foederis Jehovae e medio Jordane, et translatae essent
plantae pedum sacerdotum in siccum, reversae sunt aquae Jordanis ad
locum suum, et fluxerunt sicut heri et nudius tertius, super omnes ripas
ejus.

<span id="vii.ii-p20"></span> 

<span id="vii.ii-p21"></span><span id="vii.ii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p22"></span>**10.** *For the priests which bare,* etc
If we are ordered to halt while others are hastening, we know how easily
a feeling of irksomeness is produced, because we seem to be occupying an
inferior position. The priests, therefore, are justly praised for their
patience in calmly remaining alone at their post, while the whole people
were swiftly hurrying on to the further bank. For they might have begun
to feel doubtful lest the heaps of water which were suspended over their
heads might suddenly melt away and engulf them. They therefore evinced
their piety no less by remaining there than by venturing to proceed into
the opposing current. Thus, in the first place, they displayed their
ready obedience, and in the second their constancy, making it manifest
that they had not obeyed from mere impulse. For their firmness of
purpose, which is praised, must have had its origin in a living
principle. It was a proof of modesty that they attempted nothing rashly,
but regulated their whole procedure as it were in strict conformity to
the word of God.

<span id="vii.ii-p23"></span>Although it is probable that Joshua was
instructed by a new message from heaven as to what was necessary to be
done, he is, however, said to have followed what Moses had commanded. By
this I understand that Moses had carefully enjoined him to hang on the
lips of God, that he was thoroughly obedient to the injunction, and
accordingly was always observant of what was pleasing to God. In short,
the command of Moses here mentioned was general, but God gave special
injunctions to Joshua as each circumstance arose.

<span id="vii.ii-p24"></span><span id="vii.ii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p25"></span>**12.** *And the children of Reuben,* etc
He makes mention of the expedition of the two tribes and half tribe, as
they did not set out to engage in warfare on their own private account,
but to assist their brethren, by whose valor their own possession had
been obtained in seizing the land of Canaan. Moses had laid them under
this obligation, and they had bound themselves by oath that they would
accompany the rest of the people till all should have obtained a quiet
settlement.

<span id="vii.ii-p26"></span>They again made the same promise when the
camp was about to be moved as we saw in <span
id="vii.ii-p26.1"></span>[Joshua
1](../../../bib/kjv/jos001.htm#000.md)<span id="vii.ii-p26.1"></span>. But
from the narrative here we gather that only a part was selected, for the
number amounts only to forty thousand, that is, a third, or about a
third of the number ascertained by the census taken shortly before. Now,
as they are everywhere said to have performed their promise, it may be
probably conjectured that it was not the intention of Moses strictly to
insist that all who had assented should leave their wives and children,
and do military service in the land of Canaan till it was wholly
subdued. And certainly it would have been harsh and cruel to leave an
unwarlike multitude unprotected in the midst of many hostile nations.
Nor would the remains of the enemy, assisted by neighboring nations,
have long failed to take advantage of such an opportunity to avenge
themselves by massacring the women and children. It was necessary,
therefore, in a country not yet sufficiently pacified, permanently to
retain a force sufficient to prevent incursions. Moses was not of so
stern a nature as not to consult for the helpless. Nay, his prudence and
equity would never have allowed him to leave a territory lately seized
by arms unoccupied by a body of troops.

<span id="vii.ii-p27"></span>We may add, that such an immense concourse
would have impeded rather than assisted the acquisition of the land of
Canaan. All which Moses required, therefore, was simply that the
Reubenites and Gadites should not, while their brethren were engaged in
carrying on the war, remain indolently at home and eat their food at
ease without giving any assistance to those to whom they were indebted
for having obtained the inheritance. And the good faith of the forty
thousand was approved by their not declining the burdens, toils, and
perils of warfare, while the remainder of their own tribes were enjoying
quiet. They might readily have alleged that they were as well entitled
as the others to exemption, but in proceeding with alacrity after the
levy was made, to obey the orders given them, without envying the
immunity given to their brethren, they show that they were voluntarily
and heartily disposed to do their duty. At the same time, it is not
doubtful that by accepting the flower of their tribes, the handle for
complaint and quarrel was cut off. For it could not justly have been
maintained that not even the aged and worn out, or the young and feeble,
were to be spared. Some, perhaps, may be inclined to conjecture that the
army was raised not by choice but by lot, though it rather seems to me
that all who were most robust and best able to bear fatigue were
enrolled.

<span id="vii.ii-p28"></span><span id="vii.ii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p29"></span>**14.** *On that day the Lord magnified,*
etc It was not indeed the principal end of the miracle to proclaim
Joshua’s pre-eminence in power and authority, but as it greatly
concerned the public interest, that the government of Joshua should be
firmly established, it is justly set down as an additional instance of
the divine favor, that he was, so to speak, adorned with sacred insignia
to render him venerable in the eyes of the people, and prevent any one
from presuming to despise him. For a promiscuous multitude, not ruled by
a head, breaks up and falls away of its own accord. The Lord, therefore,
to provide for the safety of his people, distinguished Joshua by a
special mark declaratory of his vocation.

<span id="vii.ii-p30"></span>From this passage we may learn that God
specially recommends to us all those through whose hands he displays his
excellent working, and requires us to give them due honor and reverence.
When it is said that the people feared Joshua as they had feared Moses,
should any one object that the statement is refuted by the many
sedition’s and tumults which they stirred up against him, not only
wantonly but furiously, it is easy to answer, that it does not apply to
the whole period from their departure out of Egypt, but only refers to
that when subdued by plagues and softened down, they began to be duly
obedient to Moses. For what is now described is a tranquil government,
as if they had laid aside their ancient perverseness, more especially
when the turbulent parents were dead and a better race had succeeded.
Accordingly, we do not read that there was any difficulty in ruling and
turning them. I now only briefly advert to what I have already
explained. For when Joshua at the outset exhorted them to obedience,
they said that they would be obedient as they had been to Moses.

<span id="vii.ii-p31"></span><span id="vii.ii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p32"></span>**16.** *Command the priests,* etc Here it
is shown more clearly how meekly and calmly the priests yielded implicit
obedience to the divine command, for they did not move a foot until
Joshua ordered the signal to retire. But as it was an instance of rare
virtue to be thus modest and obedient, so the fatherly kindness of God
is conspicuous in this, that he condescended to direct and govern almost
every step in their progress by his own voice, lest any perplexity might
occur to retard them.

<span id="vii.ii-p33"></span>Next follows a more conspicuous
confirmation of the miracle; for as soon as they climbed the opposite
bank, the Jordan began again to flow as usual. Had it not returned to
its former state, and indeed, suddenly, many would have imagined the
cause of the change to be hidden but fortuitous. But when God displays
his power and favor at minute intervals of time all doubt is removed.
The moment the feet of the priests were made wet the Jordan retired; now
on their departure he recovers his free course, and that at the very
instant when they reached the bank. For the term *dry* here means that
part which was not covered by the overflow.  <span
id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) Thus the river, though dumb,  <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) was the best of heralds, proclaiming with
a loud voice that heaven and earth are subject to the God of Israel.

<span id="vii.iii"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p1"></span><span id="vii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
4:19-24](../../../bib/kjv/jos004.htm#019.md)<span id="vii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p2"></span>**19.** And the people came up out of
Jordan on the tenth *day* of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in
the east border of Jericho.

<span id="vii.iii-p3"></span>**19.** Populus autem ascendit e Jordane
decima die primi mensis, et castramentati sunt in Gilgal ad plagam
orientalem Jericho.

<span id="vii.iii-p4"></span>**20.** And those twelve stones, which they
took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.

<span id="vii.iii-p5"></span>**20.** Ac duodecim lapides quos tulerant
ex Jordane statuit Josue in Gilgal.

<span id="vii.iii-p6"></span>**21.** And he spoke unto the children of
Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to
come, saying, What *mean* these stones?

<span id="vii.iii-p7"></span>**21.** Et loquutus est ad filios Israel,
dicendo: Quum interrogaverint cras filii vestri patres suos dicendo,
Quid lapides isti?

<span id="vii.iii-p8"></span>**22.** Then you shall let your children
know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.

<span id="vii.iii-p9"></span>**22.** Indicabitis filiis vestris dicendo,
Per aridam transivit Israel Jordanem istum:

<span id="vii.iii-p10"></span>**23.** For the LORD your God dried up the
waters of Jordan from before you, until you were passed over, as the
LORD your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us,
until we were gone over:

<span id="vii.iii-p11"></span>**23.** Quoniam siccavit Jehova Deus
vester aquas Jordanis a facie vestra donec transiretis: quemadmodum
fecit Jehova Deus vester mari Suph, quod siccavit a facie nostra donec
transiremus.

<span id="vii.iii-p12"></span>**24.** That all the people of the earth
might know the hand of the LORD, that it *is* mighty: that you might
fear the LORD your God for ever.

<span id="vii.iii-p13"></span>**24.** Ut cognoscant omnes populi terrae
manum Jehovae, quod fortis sit: ut timeatis Jehovam Deum vestrum cunctis
diebus.

<span id="vii.iii-p14"></span> 

<span id="vii.iii-p15"></span><span id="vii.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p16"></span>**19.** *And the people came up,* etc Why
the day on which they entered the land, and first encamped in it, is
marked, we shall see in next chapter. But the name of Gilgal is given to
the first station by anticipation, for this new name was afterwards
given to it by Joshua on the renewal of circumcision; its etymology will
be explained in its own place. Moreover, the thing here principally
treated of is the monument of twelve stones; for though it was formerly
mentioned, a kind of solemn dedication is now related, namely, that
Joshua not only erected a mound, but called the attention of the people
to its use in enabling fathers to keep the memory of the divine goodness
alive among their children. From his introducing the children asking,
What mean these stones? we infer that they were arranged so as to
attract the notice of spectators. For had they been heaped together at
random without any order, it would never have come into the mind of
posterity to inquire concerning their meaning. There must therefore have
been something so remarkable in their position as not to allow the sight
to be overlooked.

<span id="vii.iii-p17"></span>Moreover, because the covenant by which
God had adopted the race of Abraham was firm in an uninterrupted
succession for a thousand generations, the benefit which God had
bestowed on the deceased fathers is, on account of the unity of the
body, transferred in common to their children who were born long after.
And the continuation must have more strongly awakened their attention,
inasmuch as posterity were in this way reminded that what had long ago
been given to their ancestors belonged to them also. The answer of the
parents would have been coldly listened to had the divine favor been
confined to a single day. But when the sons’ sons hear that the waters
of Jordan were dried up many ages before they were born, they
acknowledge themselves to be the very people towards whom that wonderful
act of divine favor had been manifested. The same account is to be given
of the drying up of the Red Sea, though the event was not very ancient.
It is certain that of those who had come out of Egypt, Caleb and Joshua
were the only survivors, and yet he addresses the whole people as if
they had been eye-witnesses of the miracle. God dried up the Red Sea
before our face; in other words, it was done in virtue of the adoption
which passed without interruption from the fathers to the children.
Moreover, it was worth while to call the passage of the Red Sea to
remembrance, not only that the similarity of the miracle might cause
belief, but that on hearing the story of the Jordan, that former miracle
might be at the same time renewed, although no visible symbol of it was
present to the eye.

<span id="vii.iii-p18"></span><span id="vii.iii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p19"></span>**24.** *That all people of the earth
might know,* etc He states that God had put forth that manifestation of
his power that it might not only be proclaimed among his own people, but
that the form of it might spread far and wide among the nations. For
although it pleased him that his praise should dwell in Zion, it pleased
him also that his works should so far be made known to strangers that
they might be forced to confess that he is the true God, and compelled
unwillingly to fear him whom they had willingly contemned, as it is said
in the song of Moses, (<span id="vii.iii-p19.1"></span>[De
32:31](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#031)<span id="vii.iii-p19.1"></span>.md)
“Our enemies are judges.” For he means that unbelievers, whether they
will or not, have this confession extorted from them by a knowledge of
the works of God. But as it did not at all profit them to know how great
the might of God was, Joshua distinguishes them from the Israelites, to
whom he attributes a special knowledge, namely, that which begets
serious fear of God. That the nations may know, he says; but that thou
may fear thy God. Therefore while unbelievers extinguish the light by
their darkness, let us learn from considering the works of God to
advance in his fear. He says *all days*, because the favor here spoken
of was diffused over several generations.

<span id="vii.ii-p34"></span> Calvin, still adhering to the view that
part of the plain beyond the immediate bank was overflowed, seems to
think that the priests, after climbing up the steep bank, continued to
walk for some time among the shallow water. The other view which
supposes that the banks were only filled and not overflowed, besides
being more in accordance with the original, as was formerly shown,
appears to derive additional confirmation from the language here used.
It is said the waters returned the moment the priests touched the dry
ground with the *soles* of their feet; in other words, so long as they
were climbing up the steep bank, and, of course, had no firm footing,
the heap of waters continued, but it was immediately dissolved as soon
as they could set down their foot firmly in consequence of having
reached the flat. — *Ed.*
