<span id="xxvii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 24

<span id="xxvii.i"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p1"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
24:1-14](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#001.md)<span id="xxvii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And Joshua gathered all the tribes
of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their
heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented
themselves before God.

<span id="xxvii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Congregavit itaque  <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) Josue omnes tribus Israel in Sichem,
vocavitque seniores Israel, et capita ejus, judicesque ejus, ac
praefectos ejus: steteruntque coram Deo.

<span id="xxvii.i-p5"></span>**2.** And Joshua said unto all the people,
Thus says the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side
of the flood in old time, *even* Terah, the father of Abraham, and the
father of Nachor: and they served other gods.

<span id="xxvii.i-p6"></span>**2.** Dixitque Josue ad universum populum,
Sic dicit Jehova Deus Israel, Trans flumen habitaverunt patres vestri a
seculo, ut Thare pater Abraham, et pater Nachor, servicruntque diis
alienis.

<span id="xxvii.i-p7"></span>**3.** And I took your father Abraham from
the other side of the flood, and led him throughout all the land of
Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.

<span id="xxvii.i-p8"></span>**3.** Et tuli patrem vestrum Abraham e
loco qui erat trans flumen, et deduxi per universam terram Chanaan:
multiplicavique semen ejus, et dedi ei Isaac.

<span id="xxvii.i-p9"></span>**4.** And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and
Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his
children went down into Egypt.

<span id="xxvii.i-p10"></span>**4.** Et dedi ipsi Isaac Jacob et Esau:
tradidique ipsi Esau montem Seir, ut possideret eum: Jacob autem et
filii ejus descenderunt in Aegyptum.

<span id="xxvii.i-p11"></span>**5.** I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I
plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them: and afterward I
brought you out.

<span id="xxvii.i-p12"></span>**5.** Misique Mosen et Aharon, et
percussi Aegyptum, quemadmodum feci in medio ejus, et postea eduxi vos.

<span id="xxvii.i-p13"></span>**6.** And I brought your fathers out of
Egypt: and you came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your
fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.

<span id="xxvii.i-p14"></span>**6.** Et eduxi patres vestros ex Aegypto,
deveniestique ad mare, et persequuti sunt Aegyptii patres vestros cum
curribus, et equitibus usque ad mare rubrum.

<span id="xxvii.i-p15"></span>**7.** And when they cried unto the LORD,
he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon
them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in
Egypt: and you dwelt in the wilderness a long season.

<span id="xxvii.i-p16"></span>**7.** Tum clamaverunt  <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) ad Jehovam, et posuit caliginem inter
vos et Aegyptios: induxitque super eum mare, ac operuit eum: et viderunt
oculi vestri quae feci in Aegypto, et habitastis in solitudine in diebus
multis.

<span id="xxvii.i-p18"></span>**8.** And I brought you into the land of
the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with
you: and I gave them into your hand, that you might possess their land;
and I destroyed them from before you.

<span id="xxvii.i-p19"></span>**8.** Postea adduxi vos ad terram
Aemorrhaei habitantis trans Jordanem: praeliatique sunt vobiscum, et
tradidi eos in manum vestram: possedistisque terram eorum, ac delevi eos
a facie vestra.

<span id="xxvii.i-p20"></span>**9.** Then Balak the son of Zippor, king
of Moab, arose and warred against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the
son of Beor to curse you:

<span id="xxvii.i-p21"></span>**9.** Surrexit autem Balac filius Sippor
rex Moab, et praeliatis est cum Israel: misitque et vocavit Bileam
filium Beor, ut malediceret vobis:

<span id="xxvii.i-p22"></span>**10.** But I would not hearken unto
Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his
hand.

<span id="xxvii.i-p23"></span>**10.** Et nolui audire Bileam, sed
benedixi benedicendo vobis, et liberavi vos e manu ejus.

<span id="xxvii.i-p24"></span>**11.** And you went over Jordan, and came
unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites,
and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into
your hand.

<span id="xxvii.i-p25"></span>**11.** Transistisque Jordanem, et
venistis ad Jericho: pugnaveruntque contra vos viri Jericho,
Aemorrhaeus, et Perizaeus, et Chananaeus, et Hittaus, et Girgasaeus, et
Hivaeus, et Jebusaeus: tradidique eos in manum vestram.

<span id="xxvii.i-p26"></span>**12.** And I sent the hornet before you,
which drave them out from before you, *even* the two kings of the
Amorites; *but* not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.

<span id="xxvii.i-p27"></span>**12.** Et misit ante vos crabrones, qui
expulerunt eos a facie vestra duos reges Aemorrhaei, non gladio tuo, nec
arcu tuo.

<span id="xxvii.i-p28"></span>**13.** And I have given you a land for
which you did not labor, and cities which you built not, and you dwell
in them; of the vineyards and oliveyards which you planted not do you
eat.

<span id="xxvii.i-p29"></span>**13.** Dedique vobis terram in qua non
laborastis, et urbes quas non aedificastis, et habitastis in eis: vineas
et oliveta quae non plantastis, comedetis.

<span id="xxvii.i-p30"></span>**14.** Now therefore fear the LORD, and
serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your
fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve
you the LORD.

<span id="xxvii.i-p31"></span>**14.** Nunc ergo timete Jehovam, et
servite ei in perfectione, et veritate, et auferte deos quibus
servierunt patres vestri trans flumen, et in Aegypto, et servite
Jehovae.

<span id="xxvii.i-p32"></span> 

<span id="xxvii.i-p33"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p33.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p34"></span>**1.** *And Joshua gathered all the
tribes,* etc He now, in my opinion, explains more fully what he before
related more briefly. For it would not have been suitable to bring out
the people twice to a strange place for the same cause. Therefore by the
repetition the course of the narrative is continued. And he now states
what he had not formerly observed, that they were all standing before
the Lord, an expression which designates the more sacred dignity and
solemnity of the meeting. I have accordingly introduced the expletive
particle *Therefore,* to indicate that the narrative which had been
begun now proceeds. For there cannot be a doubt that Joshua, in a
regular and solemn manner, invoked the name of Jehovah, and, as in his
presence, addressed the people, so that each might consider for himself
that God was presiding over all the things which were done, and that
they were not there engaged in a private business, but confirming a
sacred and inviolable compact with God himself. We may add, as is
shortly afterwards observed, that there was his sanctuary. Hence it is
probable that the ark of the covenant was conveyed thither, not with the
view of changing its place, but that in so serious an action they might
sist themselves before the earthly tribunal of God.  <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) For there was no religious obligation
forbidding the ark to be moved, and the situation of Sichem was not far
distant.

<span id="xxvii.i-p36"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p36.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p37"></span>**2.** *Your fathers dwelt on the other
side,* etc He begins his address by referring to their gratuitous
adoption by which God had anticipated any application on their part, so
that they could not boast of any peculiar excellence or merit. For God
had bound them to himself by a closer tie, having, while they were no
better than others, gathered them together to be his peculiar people,
from no respect to anything but his mere good pleasure. Moreover, to
make it clearly appear that there was nothing in which they could glory,
he leads them back to their origin, and reminds them how their fathers
had dwelt in Chaldea, worshipping idols in common with others, and
differing in nothing from the great body of their countrymen. Hence it
is inferred that Abraham, when he was plunged in idolatry, was raised
up, as it were, from the lowest deep.

<span id="xxvii.i-p38"></span>The Jews, indeed, to give a false dignity
to their race, fabulously relate that Abraham became an exile from his
country because he refused to acknowledge the Chaldean fire as God.
 <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) But if we attend to the words
of the inspired writer, we shall see that he is no more exempted from
the guilt of the popular idolatry than Terah and Nachor. For why is it
said that the fathers of the people served strange gods, and that
Abraham was rescued from the country, but just to show how the free
mercy of God was displayed in their very origin? Had Abraham been unlike
the rest of his countrymen, his own piety would distinguish him. The
opposite, however, is expressly mentioned to show that he had no
peculiar excellence of his own which could diminish the grace bestowed
upon him, and that therefore his posterity behooved to acknowledge that
when he was lost, he was raised up from death unto life.

<span id="xxvii.i-p40"></span>It seems almost an incredible and
monstrous thing, that while Noah was yet alive, idolatry had not only
spread everywhere over the world, but even penetrated into the family of
Shem, in which at least, a purer religion ought to have flourished. How
insane and indomitable human infatuation is in this respect, is proved
by the fact that the holy Patriarch, on whom the divine blessing had
been specially bestowed, was unable to curb his posterity, and prevent
them from abandoning the true God, and prostituting themselves to
superstition.

<span id="xxvii.i-p41"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p41.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p42"></span>**3.** *And I took your father Abraham,*
etc This expression gives additional confirmation to what I lately
showed, that Abraham did not emerge from profound ignorance and the
abyss of error by his own virtue, but was drawn out by the hand of God.
For it is not said that he sought God of his own accord, but that he was
taken by God and transported elsewhere. Joshua then enlarges on the
divine kindness in miraculously preserving Abraham safe during his long
pilgrimage. What follows, however, begets some doubt, namely, that God
multiplied the seed of Abraham, and yet gave him only Isaac, because no
mention is made of any but him. But this comparison illustrates the
singular grace of God towards them in that, while the offspring of
Abraham was otherwise numerous, their ancestor alone held the place of
lawful heir. In the same sense it is immediately added, that while Esau
and Jacob were brothers and twins, one of the two was retained and the
other passed over. We see, therefore, why as well in the case of Ishmael
and his brother as in that of Esau, he loudly extols the divine mercy
and goodness towards Jacob, just as if he were saying, that his race did
not excel others in any respect except in that of being specially
selected by God.

<span id="xxvii.i-p43"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p43.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p44"></span>**4.** *But Jacob and his children went
down,* etc After mentioning the rejection of Esau, he proceeds to state
how Jacob went down into Egypt, and though he confines himself to a
single expression, it is one which indicates the large and exuberant and
clear manifestation of the paternal favor of God. It cannot be doubted,
that although the sacred historian does not speak in lofty terms of each
miracle performed, Joshua gave the people such a summary exposition of
their deliverance as might suffice. First, he points to the miracles
performed in Egypt; next, he celebrates the passage of the Red Sea,
where God gave them the aid of his inestimable power; and thirdly, he
reminds them of the period during which they wandered in the desert.

<span id="xxvii.i-p45"></span><span id="xxvii.i-p45.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p46"></span>**8.** *And I brought you into the land,*
etc He at length begins to discourse of the victories which opened a way
for the occupation of their settlements. For although the country beyond
the Jordan had not been promised as part of the inheritance, yet, as
God, by his decree, joined it to the land of Canaan as a cumulative
expression of his bounty, Joshua, not without cause, connects it with
the other in commending the divine liberality towards the people, and
declares, not merely that trusting to divine aid, they had proved
superior in arms and strength, but had also been protected from the
fatal snares which Balak had laid for them. For although the impostor
Balaam was not able to effect anything by his curses and imprecations,
it was, however, very profitable to observe the admirable power of God
displayed in defeating his malice. For it was just as if he had come to
close quarters, and warred with everything that could injure them.

<span id="xxvii.i-p47"></span>The more firmly to persuade them that they
had overcome not merely by the guidance of God, but solely by his power,
he repeats what we read in the books of Moses, (<span
id="xxvii.i-p47.1"></span>[De
7:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#020)<span id="xxvii.i-p47.1"></span>.md)
that hornets were sent to rout the enemy without human hand. This was a
more striking miracle than if they had been routed, put to flight, and
scattered in any other way. For those who, contrary to expectation, gain
a victory without any difficulty, although they confess that the
prosperous issue of the war is the gift of God, immediately allow
themselves to become blinded by pride, and transfer the praise to their
own wisdom, activity, and valor. But when the thing is effected by
hornets, the divine agency is indubitably asserted. Accordingly, the
conclusion is, that the people did not acquire the land by their own
sword or bow, a conclusion repeated in <span
id="xxvii.i-p47.2"></span>[Ps
44:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#003.md)<span id="xxvii.i-p47.2"></span>,
and apparently borrowed from the passage here. Lastly, after reminding
them that they ate the fruits provided by other men’s labors, he exhorts
them to love God as his beneficence deserves.

<span id="xxvii.ii"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxvii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Joshua
24:15-24](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#015.md)<span
id="xxvii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p2"></span>**15.** And if it seem evil unto you to
serve the LORD, choose you this day whom you will serve; whether the
gods which your fathers served that *were* on the other side of the
flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell: but as for
me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p3"></span>**15.** Quod si molestum est  <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) vobis servire Jehovae, eligite vobis
hodie quos colatis: sive deos, quibus servierunt patres vestri, qui
fuerunt trans flumen, sive deos Aemorrhaei, in quorum habitatis terra:
ego vero, et domus mea colemus Jehovam.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p5"></span>**16.** And the people answered and said,
God forbid that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;

<span id="xxvii.ii-p6"></span>**16.** Cui respondit populus, dicens,
Absit a nobis ut derelinquamus Jehovam, serviendo diis alienis.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p7"></span>**17.** For the LORD our God, he *it is*
that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the
house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and
preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people
through whom we passed:

<span id="xxvii.ii-p8"></span>**17.** Jehova enim Deus noster ipse est
qui eduxit nos et patres nostros e terra AEgypti, e domo servorum,
 <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) et qui fecit in oculis nostris
signa ista magna: servavitque nos in omni via per quam ambulavimus, et
in omnibus populis per quorum transivimus medium.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p10"></span>**18.** And the LORD drave out from
before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land:
*therefore* will we also serve the LORD; for he *is* our God.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p11"></span>**18.** Expulitque Jehova omnes populos,
atque adeo Aemorrhaeum habitatorem terrae a facie nostra: etiam nos
serviemus Jehovae, quiae ipse est Deus noster.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p12"></span>**19.** And Joshua said unto the people,
You cannot serve the LORD: for he *is* an holy God; he *is* a jealous
God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p13"></span>**19.** Dixitque Josue ad populum Non
poteritis servire Jehovae, quia Deus sanctus est, Deus aemulator est:
non parcet sceleribus vestris, atque peccatis vestris.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p14"></span>**20.** If you forsake the LORD, and
serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you,
after that he has done you good.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p15"></span>**20.** Si dereliqueritis Jehovam, et
servieritis deo alieno, convertet se et malefaciet vobis, consumetque
vos, postquam benefecerit vobis.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p16"></span>**21.** And the people said unto Joshua,
Nay; but we will serve the LORD.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p17"></span>**21.** Cui respondit populus, Nequaquam:
sed Jehovae serviemus.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p18"></span>**22.** And Joshua said unto the people,
You *are* witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen you the
LORD, to serve him. And they said, *We are* witnesses.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p19"></span>**22.** Dixitque Josue ad populum, Testes
estis contra vos quod vos elegeritis vobis Jehovam ut illi serviatis. Et
dixerunt, Testes.  <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md)

<span id="xxvii.ii-p21"></span>**23.** Now therefore put away, *said
he*, the strange gods which *are* among you, and incline your heart unto
the LORD God of Israel.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p22"></span>**23.** Nunc ergo auferte deos alienos,
qui sunt in medio vestri, et inclinate cor vestrum ad Jehovam Deum
Israel.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p23"></span>**24.** And the people said unto Joshua,
The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p24"></span>**24.** Cui respondit populus Jehovae Deo
nostro serviemus, et voci ejus obediemus.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p25"></span> 

<span id="xxvii.ii-p26"></span><span id="xxvii.ii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p27"></span>**15.** *And if it seem evil unto you,*
etc It seems here as if Joshua were paying little regard to what becomes
an honest and right-hearted leader. If the people had forsaken God and
gone after idols, it was his duty to inflict punishment on their impious
and abominable revolt. But now, by giving them the option to serve God
or not, just as they choose, he loosens the reins, and gives them
license to rush audaciously into sin. What follows is still more absurd,
when he tells them that they cannot serve the Lord, as if he were
actually desirous of set purpose to impel them to shake off the yoke.
But there is no doubt that his tongue was guided by the inspiration of
the Spirit, in stirring up and disclosing their feelings. For when the
Lord brings men under his authority, they are usually willing enough to
profess zeal for piety, though they instantly fall away from it. Thus
they build without a foundation. This happens because they neither
distrust their own weakness so much as they ought, nor consider how
difficult it is to bind themselves wholly to the Lord. There is need,
therefore, of serious examination, lest we be carried aloft by some
giddy movement, and so fail of success in our very first attempts.
 <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) With this design, Joshua, by
way of probation, emancipates the Jews, making them, as it were, their
own masters, and free to choose what God they are willing to serve, not
with the view of withdrawing them from the true religion, as they were
already too much inclined to do, but to prevent them from making
inconsiderate promises, which they would shortly after violate. For the
real object of Joshua was, as we shall see, to renew and confirm the
covenant which had already been made with God. Not without cause,
therefore, does he give them freedom of choice, that they may not
afterwards pretend to have been under compulsion, when they bound
themselves by their own consent. Meanwhile, to impress them with a
feeling of shame, he declares that he and his house will persevere in
the worship of God.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p29"></span><span id="xxvii.ii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p30"></span>**16.** *And the people answered and
said,* etc Here we see he had no reason to repent of the option given,
when the people, not swearing in the words of another, nor obsequiously
submitting to extraneous dictation, declare that it would be an impious
thing to revolt from God. And thus it tends, in no small degree, to
confirm the covenant, when the people voluntarily lay the law upon
themselves. The substance of the answer is, that since the Lord has, by
a wonderful redemption, purchased them for himself as a peculiar people,
has constantly lent them his aid, and shown that he is among them as
their God, it would be detestable ingratitude to reject him and revolt
to other gods.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p31"></span><span id="xxvii.ii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p32"></span>**19.** *And Joshua said unto the
people,* etc Here Joshua seems to act altogether absurdly in crushing
the prompt and alert zeal of the people, by suggesting ground of alarm.
For to what end does he insist that they cannot serve the Lord, unless
it be to make them, from a sense of their utter powerlessness, to give
themselves up to despair, and thus necessarily become estranged from the
fear of God. It was necessary, however, to employ this harsh mode of
obtestation, in order to rouse a sluggish people, rendered more
lethargic by security. And we see that the expedient did not fail to
obtain, at least, a momentary success. For they neither despond nor
become more slothful, but, surmounting the obstacle, answer intrepidly
that they will be constant in the performance of duty.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p33"></span>In short, Joshua does not deter them from
serving God, but only explains how refractory and disobedient they are,
in order that they may learn to change their temper. So Moses, in his
song, (<span id="xxvii.ii-p33.1"></span>[De
32](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#000)<span id="xxvii.ii-p33.1"></span>.md)
when he seems to make a divorce between God and the people, does nothing
else than prick and whet them, that they may hasten to change for the
better. Joshua, indeed, argues absolutely from the nature of God; but
what he specially aims at is the perverse behavior and untamed obstinacy
of the people. He declares that Jehovah is a holy and a jealous God.
This, certainly, should not by any means prevent men from worshipping
him; but it follows from it that impure, wicked, and profane despisers,
who have no religion, provoke his anger, and can have no intercourse
with him, for they will feel him to be implacable. And when it is said
that he will not spare their wickedness, no general rule is laid down,
but the discourse is directed, as often elsewhere, against their
disobedient temper. It does not refer to faults in general, or to
special faults, but is confined to gross denial of God, as the next
verse demonstrates. The people, accordingly, answer the more readily,
 <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) that they will serve the Lord.

<span id="xxvii.ii-p35"></span><span id="xxvii.ii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p36"></span>**22.** *And Joshua said unto the
people,* etc We now understand what the object was at which Joshua had
hitherto aimed. It was not to terrify the people and make them fall away
from their religion, but to make the obligation more sacred by their
having of their own accord chosen his government, and betaken themselves
to his guidance, that they might live under his protection. They
acknowledge, therefore, that their own conscience will accuse them, and
hold them guilty of perfidy, if they prove unfaithful.  <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) But although they were not insincere
in declaring that they would be witnesses to their own condemnation,
still how easily the remembrance of this promise faded away, is obvious
from the Book of Judges. For when the more aged among them had died,
they quickly turned aside to various superstitions. By this example we
are taught how multifarious are the fallacies which occupy the senses of
men, and how tortuous the recesses in which they hide their hypocrisy
and folly, while they deceive themselves by vain confidence.  <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md)

<span id="xxvii.ii-p39"></span><span id="xxvii.ii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p40"></span>**23.** *Now, therefore, put away the
strange gods,* etc How can it be that those who were lately such stern
avengers of superstition, have themselves given admission to idols? Yet
the words expressly enjoin that they are to put away strange gods from
the midst of them. If we interpret that their own houses were still
polluted by idols, we may see, as in a bright mirror, how complacently
the greater part of mankind can indulge in vices which they prosecute
with inexorable severity in others. But, as I do not think it probable
that they dared, after the execution of Achan, to pollute themselves
with manifest sacrilege, I am inclined to think that reference is made
not to their practice but to their inclinations, and that they are told
to put all ideas of false gods far away from them. For he had previously
exhorted them in this same chapter to take away the gods whom their
fathers had served beyond the river and in Egypt. But nobody will
suppose that the idols of Chaldea were treasured up in their
repositories, or that they had brought impure deities with them from
Egypt, to be a cause of hostility between God and themselves. The
meaning, therefore, simply is, that they are to renounce all idols, and
clear themselves of all profanity, in order that they may purely worship
God alone.  <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) This seems to be the
purport of the clause, *incline your heart unto the Lord,* which may be
taken as equivalent to, *rest in him, and so give up your heart to the
love of him, as to delight and be contented only with him.*

id="xxvii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p2"></span>**25.** So Joshua made a covenant with
the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p3"></span>**25.** Percussit itaque Josue foedus cum
populo in die illa: et prosposuit ei praeceptum et judicium in Sechem.
 <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md)

<span id="xxvii.iii-p5"></span>**26.** And Joshua wrote these words in
the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there
under an oak, that *was* by the sanctuary of the LORD.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p6"></span>**26.** Scripsit Josue verba ista in
libro Legis Dei: tulit quoque lapidem magnum, statuitque eum ibi subter
quercum, quae erat in sanctuario Jehovae.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p7"></span>**27.** And Joshua said unto all the
people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it has heard
all the words of the LORD which he spoke unto us: it shall be therefore
a witness unto you, lest you deny your God.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p8"></span>**27.** Dixitque Josue ad universum
populum, En lapis iste erit nobis in testimonium: ipse enim audivit
omnia verba Jehovae quae loquutus est nobiscum, eritque contra vos in
testimonium, ne forte mentiamini contra Deum vestrum.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p9"></span>**28.** So Joshua let the people depart,
every man unto his inheritance.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p10"></span>**28.** Remisitque Josue populum,
quemlibet in haereditatem suam.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p11"></span>**29.** And it came to pass after these
things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died,
*being* an hundred and ten years old.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p12"></span>**29.** His autem gestis, mortuus est
Josue filius Nun servus Jehovae centum et decem annorum.  <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md)

<span id="xxvii.iii-p14"></span>**30.** And they buried him in the
border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which *is* in mount Ephraim,
on the north side of the hill of Gaash.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p15"></span>**30.** Sepelieruntque eum in termino
haereditatis ejus in Thimnatserah, quae est in monte Ephraim ad
aquilonem montis Gaas.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p16"></span>**31.** And Israel served the LORD all
the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived
Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done
for Israel.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p17"></span>**31.** Servivitque Israel Jehovae
cunctis diebus Josue, cunctisque diebus eniorum qui diu vixerunt post
Josue, quinque noverunt omne opus Jehovae quod fecerat ipsi Israel.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p18"></span>**32.** And the bones of Joseph, which
the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem,
in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father
of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the
inheritance of the children of Joseph.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p19"></span>**32.** Ossa autem Joseph quae
detulerant filii Israel ex Aegypto, sepelierunt in Sechem, in parte agri
quam acquisierat Jacob a filiis Hamor patris Sechem centum nummis, et
fuerunt filiis Joseph in possessione sua.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p20"></span>**33.** And Eleazar the son of Aaron
died; and they buried him in a hill *that pertained to* Phinehas his
son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p21"></span>**33.** Porro Eleazar filius Aharon
mortuus est, et sepelierunt eum in Gibeath Phinees filii ejus, qui datus
fuit illi in monte Ephraim.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p22"></span> 

<span id="xxvii.iii-p23"></span><span id="xxvii.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p24"></span>**25.** *So Joshua made a covenant,* etc
This passage demonstrates the end for which the meeting had been called,
namely, to bind the people more completely and more solemnly to God, by
the renewal of the covenant. Therefore, in this agreement, Joshua acted
as if he had been appointed on the part of God to receive in his name
the homage and obedience promised by the people. It is accordingly
added, exegetically, in the second clause, that he set before them
precept and judgment. For the meaning is corrupted and wrested by some
expositors, who explain it is referring to some new speech of Joshua,
whereas it ought properly to be understood of the Law of Moses, as if it
had been said that Joshua made no other paction than that they should
remain steadfast in observing the Law, and that no other heads of the
covenant were brought forward; they were only confirmed in that doctrine
which they had formerly embraced and professed. In the same way,
Malachi, to keep them under the yoke of God, demands nothing more than
that they should remember the Law of Moses. (<span
id="xxvii.iii-p24.1"></span>[Mal
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004)<span id="xxvii.iii-p24.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xxvii.iii-p25"></span><span id="xxvii.iii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p26"></span>**26.** *And Joshua wrote these words,*
etc Understand that authentic volume which was kept near the ark of the
covenant, as if it contained public records deposited for perpetual
remembrance. And there is no doubt that when the Law was read, the
promulgation of this covenant was also added. But as it often happens,
that that which is written remains concealed in unopened books,  <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) another aid is given to the memory,
one which should always be exposed to the eye, namely, the stone under
the ark, near the sanctuary. Not that the perpetual station of the ark
was there, but because it had been placed there, in order that they
might appear in the presence of God. Therefore, as often as they came
into his presence, the testimony or memorial of the covenant which had
been struck was in their view, that they might be the better kept in the
faith.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p28"></span>Joshua’s expression, that the stone
heard the words, is indeed hyperbolical, but is not inapt to express the
efficacy and power of the divine word, as if it had been said that it
pierces inanimate rocks and stones; so that if men are deaf, their
condemnation is echoed in all the elements. *To lie* is here used, as it
frequently is elsewhere, for acting cunningly and deceitfully, for
frustrating and violating a promise that has been given. Who would not
suppose that a covenant so well established would be firm and sacred to
posterity for many ages? But all that Joshua gained by his very great
anxiety was to secure its rigorous observance for a few years.

<span id="xxvii.iii-p29"></span><span id="xxvii.iii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p30"></span>**29.** *And it came to pass after these
things,* etc The honor of sepulture was a mark of reverence, which of
itself bore testimony to the affectionate regard of the people. But
neither this reverence nor affection was deeply rooted. The title by
which Joshua is distinguished after his death, when he is called the
servant of the Lord, took away all excuse from those miserable and
abandoned men who shortly after spurned the Lord, who had worked wonders
among them. Accordingly, attention is indirectly drawn to their
inconstancy, when it is said that they served the Lord while Joshua
survived, and till the more aged had died out. For there is a tacit
antithesis, implying lapse and alienation, when they were suddenly
seized with a forgetfulness of the Divine favors. It is not strange,
therefore, if, in the present day also, when God furnishes any of his
servants with distinguished and excellent gifts, their authority
protects and preserves the order and state of the Church; but when they
are dead, sad havoc instantly commences, and hidden impiety breaks forth
with unbridled license.  <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md)

<span id="xxvii.iii-p33"></span><span id="xxvii.iii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p34"></span>**32.** *And the bones of Joseph,* etc
The time when the bones of Joseph were buried is not mentioned; but it
is easy to infer that the Israelites had performed this duty after they
obtained a peaceful habitation in the city of Shechem. For although he
had not designated a particular place for a sepulchre, they thought it a
mark of respect to deposit his bones in the field which Jacob had
purchased. It may be, however, that this is expressed as a censure on
the sluggishness of the people, to which it was owing, that Joseph could
not be buried with Abraham, that locality being still in the power of
the enemy. Stephen (<span id="xxvii.iii-p34.1"></span>[Ac
7](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#000)<span id="xxvii.iii-p34.1"></span>.md)
mentions the bones of the twelve patriarchs, and it is not impossible
that the other tribes, from feelings of emulation, gathered together the
ashes of their progenitors. It is there said that the field was
purchased by Abraham; but obviously an error in the name has crept in.
With regard to sepulture, we must hold in general, that the very
frequent mention of it in Scripture is owing to its being a symbol of
the future Resurrection.

id="xxvii.i-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p4"></span> The “<span
id="xxvii.i-p4.1"></span>itaque“ is here inserted without authority, but
Calvin, as he explains in the commentary on the verse, thinks it
necessary, in order to keep up the connection with the previous chapter,
to show, according to his hypothesis, that both chapters contain the
account of only one meeting. On the contrary, as has been observed in
note, p. 264, the whole tenor of the narrative here given seems to
indicate that it refers not to a continuation of the former meeting, but
to one held on a subsequent occasion, and for a still more solemn
purpose. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_194"></span>[195](cc07026.htm#fr_194.md) <span
id="xxvii.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p17"></span> There is here a very abrupt transition
from the first to the third person in the verbs “they cried” — “he put”
— “he brought” — “he covered,” as if Joshua had ceased to deliver an
actual message, and became merely a narrator. The message, however, is
immediately resumed, “Your eyes have seen what *I* have done.” The
Septuagint, at the commencement of the verse, renders “<span
id="xxvii.i-p17.1"></span>ἀνεβοήσαμεν,” “we cried,” and thereafter uses
the narrative from to the end of <span id="xxvii.i-p17.2"></span>[Jos
24:13](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#013.md)<span id="xxvii.i-p17.2"></span>,
saying, in <span id="xxvii.i-p17.3"></span>[Jos
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#008.md)<span id="xxvii.i-p17.3"></span>,
“he brought,” and in <span id="xxvii.i-p17.4"></span>[Jos
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#010.md)<span id="xxvii.i-p17.4"></span>,
“the Lord your God would not.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_195"></span>[196](cc07026.htm#fr_195.md) <span
id="xxvii.i-p34.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p35"></span> Latin, “<span
id="xxvii.i-p35.1"></span>Terrestre Dei tribunal.” French, “<span
id="xxvii.i-p35.2"></span>Le siege judicial que Dieu avoit en terre;”
“The judicial seat which God had on earth.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_196"></span>[197](cc07026.htm#fr_196.md) <span
id="xxvii.i-p38.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.i-p39"></span> One of the fables here alluded to is,
that Terah was not only a worshipper but a maker of idols, and that
Abraham, convinced of the absurdity of idolatrous worship, destroyed all
his father’s idols. After doing so he labored to convince his father of
the propriety of his conduct by a series of arguments which are gravely
recorded, but not having succeeded in his pious endeavors, was forced to
flee, and thus became a wanderer. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_197"></span>[198](cc07026.htm#fr_197.md) <span
id="xxvii.ii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p4"></span> Literally, “And if it be evil in your
eyes.” This differs little from the English version, “And if it seem
evil unto you,” and is preferable both to Calvin’s Latin, “<span
id="xxvii.ii-p4.1"></span>Quod si molestum est,” “But if it is irksome;”
and to the Septuagint, <span id="xxvii.ii-p4.2"></span>Εἰ δὲ μὴ ἀρέσκει
ὑμῖν, “If it is not pleasing to you.” The last is exactly followed by
Luther, “<span id="xxvii.ii-p4.3"></span>Gefallt es euch aber nicht.” —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_198"></span>[199](cc07026.htm#fr_198.md) <span
id="xxvii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p9"></span> The Septuagint omits the words “from the
house of bondage.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_199"></span>[200](cc07026.htm#fr_199.md) <span
id="xxvii.ii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p20"></span> The Septuagint omits the response of the
people. — *Ed.*

id="xxvii.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p28"></span> Latin, “<span
id="xxvii.ii-p28.1"></span>Atque ita inter primos conatus nos successus
destituet.” French, “<span id="xxvii.ii-p28.2"></span>Et qu’ainsi entre
les premiers efforts nous nous trouvions n’estre pas bien fournis pour
rencontrer ainsi qu’il faut, et tenir bon;” “And that thus among the
first efforts we may find ourselves not well furnished for encountering
as is meet, and standing firm.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_201"></span>[202](cc07026.htm#fr_201.md) <span
id="xxvii.ii-p33.2"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p34"></span> Latin, “<span
id="xxvii.ii-p34.1"></span>Liberius.” French, “<span
id="xxvii.ii-p34.2"></span>Plus hardiment et franchement;” “More boldly
and frankly.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_202"></span>[203](cc07026.htm#fr_202.md) <span
id="xxvii.ii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p37"></span> French, “<span
id="xxvii.ii-p37.1"></span>Leur propre conscience les redarguera comme
coulpables et conveincus de desloyaute, et d’avoir fausse leur foy,
s’ils ne tiennent leur promesse;” “Their own conscience will condemn
them as guilty and convicted of disloyalty, and as having broken their
faith, if they do not keep their promise.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_203"></span>[204](cc07026.htm#fr_203.md) <span
id="xxvii.ii-p37.2"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p38"></span> The French adds, “<span
id="xxvii.ii-p38.1"></span>Comme s’il n’y avoit rien a redire en eux;”
“As if there was nothing to gainsay in them.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_204"></span>[205](cc07026.htm#fr_204.md) <span
id="xxvii.ii-p40.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.ii-p41"></span> The words meaning literally, “The gods
which are in the midst of you,’ would rather seem to indicate that even
at this time some of the Israelites were addicted to the secret practice
of idolatry. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_205"></span>[206](cc07026.htm#fr_205.md) <span
id="xxvii.iii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p4"></span> The Septuagint says, “In Shiloh, before
the tabernacle of the God of Israel;” and some expositors, induced by
this and other considerations, labor, though with little plausibility,
to show that the whole transaction here recorded took place at Shiloh,
and that the name of Shechem is not here given to the town of that name,
but to a district so large, that even Shiloh was included in it. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_206"></span>[207](cc07026.htm#fr_206.md) <span
id="xxvii.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p13"></span> The Septuagint here transposes <span
id="xxvii.iii-p13.1"></span>[Josh.
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#029.md),
[31](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#031.md)<span id="xxvii.iii-p13.1"></span>,
and to the end of <span id="xxvii.iii-p13.2"></span>[Jos
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#029.md)<span
id="xxvii.iii-p13.2"></span>, thus made its <span
id="xxvii.iii-p13.3"></span>[Jos
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#031.md)<span
id="xxvii.iii-p13.3"></span>, appends the singular statement that they
deposited, within the tomb which they erected for him there, the stone
knives with which he circumcised the children of Israel at Gilgal, when
he brought them out of Egypt, as the Lord commanded them; and there they
are at this day. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_207"></span>[208](cc07026.htm#fr_207.md) <span
id="xxvii.iii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p27"></span> The French adds, “<span
id="xxvii.iii-p27.1"></span>Et on le laisse la dormir;” “And it is left
to sleep there.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_208"></span>[209](cc07026.htm#fr_208.md) <span
id="xxvii.iii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xxvii.iii-p31"></span> When these words were penned, the
venerable writer, though it could scarcely be said of him that he was,
like Joshua, “old and stricken in age,” was, however, like him, visibly
“going the way of all the earth.” In such circumstances, can we doubt,
that these words contain a presentiment of the fearful decline which,
after his own death, was to take place in the Church of Geneva? — *Ed.*
