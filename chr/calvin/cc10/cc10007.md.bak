<span id="viii-p1"></span>PSALM 73

<span id="viii-p2"></span>David, or whoever may have been the author of
this psalm, contending as it were against the judgment of carnal sense
and reason, begins by extolling the righteousness and goodness of God.
He next confesses that when he saw the wicked abounding in wealth, and
living in the indulgence of every kind of pleasure, yea, even scornfully
mocking God, and cruelly harassing the righteous, and that when he saw,
on the other hand, how in proportion to the care with which any studied
to practice uprightness, was the degree in which they were weighed down
by troubles and calamities, and that in general all the children of God
were pining away, and oppressed with cares and sorrows, while God, as if
sitting in heaven idle and unconcerned, did not interfere to remedy such
a disordered state of matters; it gave him so severe a shock, as almost
to dispose him to cast off all concern about religion and all fear of
God. In the third place, he reproves his own folly in proceeding rashly
and hastily to pronounce judgment, merely from a view of the present
state of things, and shows the necessity of exercising patience, that
our faith may not fail under these troubles and disquietudes. At last he
concludes that, provided we leave the providence of God to take its own
course, in the way which he has determined in his secret purpose,  <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) in the end, matters will assume a very
different aspect, and it will be seen, that, on the one hand, the
righteous are not defrauded of their reward, and that, on the other, the
wicked do not escape the hand of the judge.

<span id="viii-p4"></span>A Psalm of Asaph.

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
73:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Yet God is good to Israel, to those
who are right of heart. **2.** As for me, my feet were almost gone, my
steps had well nigh slipped. **3.** For I envied the foolish, when I saw
the prosperity of the wicked.

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span><span id="viii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span>As to the author of this psalm, I am not
disposed to contend very strongly, although I think it probable that the
name of Asaph was prefixed to it because the charge of singing it was
committed to him, while the name of David, its author, was omitted, just
as it is usual for us, when things are well known of themselves, not to
be at the trouble of stating them. How much profit we may derive from
meditation upon the doctrine contained in this psalm, it is easy to
discover from the example of the prophet, who, although he had been
exercised in no ordinary degree in true godliness, yet had great
difficulty in keeping his footing, while reeling to and fro on the
slippery ground on which he found himself placed. Nay, he acknowledges
that, before he returned to such soundness of mind as enabled him to
form a just judgment of the things which occasioned his trial, he had
fallen into a state of almost brutish stupidity. As to ourselves,
experience shows how slight impressions we have of the providence of
God. We no doubt all agree in admitting that the world is governed by
the hand of God; but were this truth deeply rooted in our hearts, our
faith would be distinguished by far greater steadiness and perseverance
in surmounting the temptations with which we are assailed in adversity.
But when the smallest temptation which we meet with dislodges this
doctrine from our minds, it is manifest that we have not yet been truly
and in good earnest convinced of its truth.

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span>Besides, Satan has numberless artifices by
which he dazzles our eyes and bewilders the mind; and then the confusion
of things which prevails in the world produces so thick a mist, as to
render it difficult for us to see through it, and to come to the
conclusion that God governs and extends his care to things here below.
The ungodly for the most part triumph; and although they deliberately
stir up God to anger and provoke his vengeance, yet from his sparing
them, it seems as if they had done nothing amiss in deriding him, and
that they will never be called to account for it.  <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) On the other hand, the righteous,
pinched with poverty, oppressed with many troubles, harassed by
multiplied wrongs, and covered with shame and reproach, groan and sigh:
and in proportion to the earnestness with which they exert themselves in
endeavoring to do good to all men, is the liberty which the wicked have
the effrontery to take in abusing their patience. When such is the state
of matters, where shall we find the person who is not sometimes tempted
and importuned by the unholy suggestion, that the affairs of the world
roll on at random, and as we say, are governed by chance?  <span
id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) This unhallowed imagination has
doubtless obtained complete possession of the minds of the unbelieving,
who are not illuminated by the Spirit of God, and thereby led to elevate
their thoughts to the contemplation of eternal life. Accordingly, we see
the reason why Solomon declares, that since “all things come alike to
all, and there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked,” the
hearts of the sons of men are full of impiety and contempt of God,
(<span id="viii.i-p8.2"></span>[Eccl.
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#003)<span id="viii.i-p8.2"></span>;.md) —
the reason is, because they do not consider that things apparently so
disordered are under the direction and government of God.

<span id="viii.i-p9"></span>Some of the heathen philosophers discoursed
upon, and maintained the doctrine of a Divine Providence; but it was
evident from experience that they had notwithstanding no real and
thorough persuasion of its truth; for when things fell out contrary to
their expectation, they openly disavowed what they had previously
professed.  <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) Of this we have a
memorable example in Brutus. We can hardly conceive of a man surpassing
him in courage, and all who intimately knew him bore testimony to his
distinguished wisdom. Being of the sect of the Stoic philosophers, he
spake many excellent things in commendation of the power and providence
of God; and yet when at length vanquished by Antony, he cried out, that
whatever he had believed concerning virtue had no foundation in truth,
but was the mere invention of men, and that all the pains taken to live
honestly and virtuously was only so much lost labor, since fortune rules
over all the affairs of mankind. Thus this personage, who was
distinguished for heroic courage, and an example of wonderful
resolution, in renouncing virtue, and under the name of it cursing God,
shamefully fell away. Hence it is manifest, how the sentiments of the
ungodly fluctuate with the fluctuation of events. And how can it be
expected that the heathen, who are not regenerated by the Spirit of God,
should be able to resist such powerful and violent assaults, when even
God’s own people have need of the special assistance of his grace to
prevent the same temptation from prevailing in their hearts, and when
they are sometimes shaken by it and ready to fall; even as David here
confesses, that his steps had well nigh slipped? But let us now proceed
to the consideration of the words of the psalm.

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span>**1.** *Yet God is good to Israel.* The
adverb <span id="viii.i-p11.1"></span>אך,  <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) *ach,* does not here imply a simple
affirmation *certainly,* as it often does in other places, but is taken
adversatively for *yet, notwithstanding,* or some similar word. David
opens the psalm abruptly; and from this we learn, what is worthy of
particular notice, that before he broke forth into this language, his
mind had been agitated with many doubts and conflicting suggestions. As
a brave and valiant champion, he had been exercised in very painful
struggles and temptations; but, after long and arduous exertion, he at
length succeeded in shaking off all perverse imaginations, and came to
the conclusion that *yet* God is gracious to his servants, and the
faithful guardian of their welfare. Thus these words contain a tacit
contrast between the unhallowed imaginations suggested to him by Satan,
and the testimony in favor of true religion with which he now
strengthens himself, denouncing, as it were, the judgment of the flesh,
in giving place to misgiving thoughts with respect to the providence of
God. We see then how emphatic is this exclamation of the Psalmist. He
does not ascend into the chair to dispute after the manner of the
philosophers, and to deliver his discourse in a style of studied
oratory; but, as if he had escaped from hell, he proclaims, with a loud
voice, and with impassioned feeling, that he had obtained the victory.
To teach us by his own example the difficulty and arduousness of the
conflict, he opens, so to speak, his heart and bowels, and would have us
to understand something more than is expressed by the words which he
employs. The amount of his language is, that although God, to the eye of
sense and reason, may seem to neglect his servants, yet he always
embraces them with his favor. He celebrates the providence of God,
especially as it is extended towards genuine saints; to show them, not
only that they are governed by God in common with other creatures, but
that he watches over their welfare with special care, even as the master
of a family carefully provides for and attends to his own household.
God, it is true, governs the whole world; but he is graciously pleased
to take a more close and peculiar inspection of his Church, which he has
undertaken to maintain and defend.

<span id="viii.i-p13"></span>This is the reason why the prophet speaks
expressly of *Israel;* and why immediately after he limits this name to
*those who are right of heart;* which is a kind of correction of the
first sentence; for many proudly lay claim to the name of Israel, as if
they constituted the chief members of the Church, while they are but
Ishmaelites and Edomites. David, therefore, with the view of blotting
out from the catalogue of the godly all the degenerate children of
Abraham,  <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) acknowledges none to
belong to Israel but such as purely and uprightly worship God; as if he
had said, *“When* I declare that God is good to his Israel, I do not
mean all those who, resting contented with a mere external profession,
bear the name of Israelites, to which they have no just title; but I
speak of the spiritual children of Abraham, who consecrate themselves to
God with sincere affection of heart.” Some explain the first clause,
*God is good to Israel,* as referring to his chosen people; and the
second clause, *to those who are right of heart,* as referring to
strangers, to whom God would be gracious, provided they walked in true
uprightness. But this is a frigid and forced interpretation. It is
better to adhere to that which I have stated. David, in commending the
goodness of God towards the chosen people and the Church, was under the
necessity of cutting off from their number many hypocrites who had
apostatised from the service of God, and were, therefore, unworthy of
enjoying his fatherly favor. To his words corresponds the language of
Christ to Nathanael, (<span id="viii.i-p14.2"></span>[Joh
1:47](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#047)<span id="viii.i-p14.2"></span>,.md)
“Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!” As the fear of God
among the Jews was at that time well nigh extinguished, and there
remained among them almost nothing else but the “circumcision made with
hands,” that is to say, outward circumcision, Christ, to discriminate
between the true children of Abraham and hypocrites, lays it down as a
distinguishing characteristic of the former, that they are free from
guile. And assuredly in the service of God, no qualification is more
indispensable than uprightness of heart.

<span id="viii.i-p15"></span><span id="viii.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p16"></span>**2.** *As for me, etc.* Literally, it is,
*And I:* which ought to be read with emphasis; for David means that
those temptations, which cast an affront upon the honor of God, and
overwhelm faith, not only assail the common class of men, or those who
are endued only with some small measure of the fear of God, but that he
himself, who ought to have profited above all others in the school of
God, had experienced his own share of them. By thus setting himself
forth as an example, he designed the more effectually to arouse and
incite us to take great heed to ourselves. He did not, it is true,
actually succumb under the temptation; but, in declaring *that* *his
feet were almost gone,* and that *his steps had well nigh slipped,* he
warns us that all are in danger of falling, unless they are upheld by
the powerful hand of God.

<span id="viii.i-p17"></span><span id="viii.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p18"></span>**3.** *For I envied the foolish*  <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) Here he declares the nature of the
temptation with which he was assailed. It consisted in this, that when
he saw the present prosperous state of the wicked, and from it judged
them to be happy, he had envied their condition. We are certainly under
a grievous and a dangerous temptation, when we not only, in our own
minds, quarrel with God for not setting matters in due order, but also
when we give ourselves loose reins, boldly to commit iniquity, because
it seems to us that we may commit it, and yet escape with impunity. The
sneering jest of Dionysius the younger, a tyrant of Sicily, when, after
having robbed the temple of Syracuse, he had a prosperous voyage with
the plunder, is well known.  <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md)
“See you not,” says he to those who were with him, “how the gods favor
the sacrilegious?” In the same way, the prosperity of the wicked is
taken as an encouragement to commit sin; for we are ready to imagine,
that, since God grants them so much of the good things of this life,
they are the objects of his approbation and favor. We see how their
prosperous condition wounded David to the heart, leading him almost to
think that there was nothing better for him than to join himself to
their company, and to follow their course of life.  <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) By applying to the ungodly the
appellation of *foolish,* he does not simply mean that the sins which
they commit are committed through ignorance or inadvertence, but he sets
their folly in opposition to the fear of God, which is the principal
constituent of true wisdom.  <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) The
ungodly are, no doubt, crafty; but, being destitute of the fundamental
principle of all right judgment, which consists in this, that we must
regulate and frame our lives according to the will of God, they are
foolish; and this is the effect of their own blindness.

<span id="viii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
73:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#004.md)<span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>**4.** For there are no bands to their
death, and their strength is vigorous.  <span
id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) **5.** They are not in the trouble
that is common to man; neither are they scourged \[or stricken\] with
other men. **6.** Therefore pride compasseth them as a chain; the
raiment of violence hath covered them. **7.** Their eye goeth out for
fatness; they have passed beyond \[or exceeded\] the thoughts of their
heart. **8.** They become insolent, and wickedly talk of extortion:
 <span id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) they speak from on high. **9.**
They have set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh
through the earth.  <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md)

<span id="viii.ii-p8"></span> 

<span id="viii.ii-p9"></span><span id="viii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p10"></span>**4** *For there are no bands to their
death.* The Psalmist describes the comforts and advantages of the
ungodly, which are as it were so many temptations to shake the faith of
the people of God. He begins with the good health which they enjoy,
telling us, that they are robust and vigorous, and have not to draw
their breath with difficulty through continual sicknesses, as will often
be the case with regard to true believers.  <span
id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) Some explain *bands to death,* as
meaning *delays,* viewing the words as implying that the wicked die
suddenly, and in a moment, not having to struggle with the pangs of
dissolution. In the book of Job it is reckoned among the earthly
felicities of the ungodly, That, after having enjoyed to the full their
luxurious pleasures, they “in a moment go down to the grave,” (<span
id="viii.ii-p11.2"></span>[Job
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013.md)<span
id="viii.ii-p11.2"></span>.) And it is related of Julius Caesar, that,
the day before he was put to death, he remarked, that to die suddenly
and unexpectedly, seemed to him to be a happy death. Thus, then,
according to the opinion of these expositors, David complains that the
wicked go to death by a smooth and easy path, without much trouble and
anxiety. But I am rather inclined to agree with those who read these two
clauses jointly in this way: *Their strength is vigorous, and,* in
respect to them, *there are no bands to death;* because they are not
dragged to death like prisoners.  <span
id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) As diseases lay prostrate our
strength, they are so many messengers of death, warning us of the
frailty and short duration of our life. They are therefore with
propriety compared to bands, with which God binds us to his yoke, lest
our strength and rigour should incite us to licentiousness and
rebellion.

<span id="viii.ii-p13"></span><span id="viii.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p14"></span>**5.** *They are not in the trouble that
is common to man.* Here it is declared that the wicked enjoy a
delightful repose, and are as it were by special privilege exempted from
the miseries to which mankind in general are subject. They also are no
doubt involved in afflictions as well as the good, and God often
executes his judgments upon them; but, for the express purpose of trying
our faith, he always places some of them as it were upon an elevated
stage, who appear to be privileged to live in a state of exemption from
calamities, as is here described. Now, when we consider that the life of
men is full of labor and miseries, and that this is the law and
condition of living appointed for all, it is a sore temptation to behold
the despisers of God indulging themselves in their luxurious pleasures
and enjoying great ease, as if they were elevated above the rest of the
world into a region of pleasure, where they had a nest for themselves
apart.  <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md)

<span id="viii.ii-p16"></span><span id="viii.ii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p17"></span>**6.** *Therefore pride compasseth them as
a chain.* This complaint proceeds farther than the preceding; for we are
here told that although God sees the ungodly shamefully and wickedly
abusing his kindness and clemency, he notwithstanding bears with their
ingratitude and rebellion. The Psalmist employs a similitude taken from
the dress and attire of the body, to show that such persons glory in
their evil deeds. The verb <span id="viii.ii-p17.1"></span>ענק, *anak,*
which we have rendered, *encompasseth them as a chain,* comes from a
noun which signifies *a chain.* The language, therefore, implies that
the ungodly glory in their audacity and madness, as if they were richly
adorned with a chain of gold:  <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md)
and that violence serves them for raiment, thinking, as they do, that it
renders them very stately and honorable. Some translate the Hebrew word
<span id="viii.ii-p18.3"></span>שית, *shith,* which we have rendered
*raiment,* by *buttocks;* but this is a sense which the scope of the
passage will by no means admit. David, I have no doubt, after having
commenced at the neck or head — for the Hebrew verb <span
id="viii.ii-p18.4"></span>ענק, *anak* which he uses, signifies also
sometimes *to crown*  <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) — now
meant to comprehend, in one word, the whole attire of the person. The
amount of what is stated is, that the wicked are so blinded with their
prosperity, as to become more and more proud and insolent  <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) The Psalmist has very properly put
*pride* first in order, and then added *violence* to it as its
companion; for what is the reason why the ungodly seize and plunder
whatever they can get on all sides, and exercise so much cruelty, but
because they account all other men as nothing in comparison of
themselves; or rather persuade themselves that mankind are born only for
them? The source, then, and, as it were, the mother of all violence, is
pride.

<span id="viii.ii-p21"></span><span id="viii.ii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p22"></span>**7.** *Their eye goeth out for fatness.*
 <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) He now adds, that it is not
wonderful to see the ungodly breaking forth with such violence and
cruelty, since, by reason of fatness and pampering, their eyes are ready
to start out of their heads. Some explain the words *goeth out* as
meaning, that their eyes being covered and hidden with fat, were, so to
speak, lost, and could not be perceived in their sockets. But as fat
causes the eyes to project from the head, I prefer retaining the proper
meaning of the words. Let it, however, be observed, that David is not to
be understood as speaking of the bodily countenance, but as expressing
metaphorically the pride with which the ungodly are inflated on account
of the abundance which they possess. They so glut and intoxicate
themselves with their prosperity, that afterwards they are ready to
burst with pride. The last clause of the verse is also explained in two
ways. Some think that by the verb <span id="viii.ii-p23.3"></span>עבר,
*abar,* which we have translated *passed beyond,* is denoted *unbridled
presumption;*  <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) for the ungodly
are not contented to keep themselves within ordinary bounds, but in
their wild and extravagant projects mount above the clouds. We know, in
fact, that they often deliberate with themselves how they may take
possession of the whole world; yea, they would wish God to create new
worlds for them. In short, being altogether insatiable, they pass beyond
heaven and earth in their wild and unbounded desires. It would certainly
not be inappropriate to explain the verb as meaning, that their foolish
thoughts can be regulated by no law, nor kept within any bounds. But
there is another exposition which is also very suitable, namely, that
the prosperity and success which they meet with exceed all the
flattering prospects which they had pictured in their imaginations. We
certainly see some of them who obtain more than ever they had desired,
as if, whilst they were asleep, Fortune laid nets and fished for them,
 <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) — the device under which king
Demetrius was in old time wittily painted, who had taken so many cities,
although otherwise he was neither skillful nor vigilant, nor of great
foresight. If we are inclined to take this view of the words, this
clause will be added by way of exposition, to teach us what is meant by
that *fatness,* spoken of before — that it means that God heaps upon the
wicked, and fills them with, an abundance of all good things, beyond
what they had ever either desired or thought of.

<span id="viii.ii-p26"></span><span id="viii.ii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p27"></span>**8.** *They become insolent, and wickedly
talk of extortion.* Some take the verb <span
id="viii.ii-p27.1"></span>ימיקו, *yamicu,* in an active transitive
sense, and explain it as meaning, that the wicked soften, that is to
say, render others pusillanimous, or frighten and intimidate them.
 <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) But as the idiom of the
language admits also of its being understood in the neuter sense, I have
adopted the interpretation which agreed best with the scope of the
passage, namely, that the wicked, forgetting themselves to be men, and
by their unbounded audacity trampling under foot all shame and honesty,
dissemble not their wickedness, but, on the contrary, loudly boast of
their extortion. And, indeed, we see that wicked men, after having for
some time got every thing to prosper according to their desires, cast
off all sham and are at no pains to conceal themselves when about to
commit iniquity, but loudly proclaim their own turpitude. “What!” they
will say, “is it not in my power to deprive you of all that you possess,
and even to cut your throat?” Robbers, it is true, can do the same
thing; but then they hide themselves for fear. These giants, or rather
inhuman monsters, of whom David speaks, on the contrary not only imagine
that they are exempted from subjection to any law, but, unmindful of
their own weakness, foam furiously, as if there were no distinction
between good and evil, between right and wrong. If, however, the other
interpretation should be preferred, That the wicked intimidate the
simple and peaceable by boasting of the great oppressions and outrages
which they can perpetrate upon them, I do not object to it. When the
poor and the afflicted find themselves at the mercy of these wicked men,
they cannot but tremble, and, so to speak, melt and dissolve upon seeing
them in possession of so much power. With respect to the expression,
*They speak from on high,*  <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md)
implies, that they pour forth their insolent and abusive speech upon the
heads of all others. As proud men, who disdain to look directly at any
body, are said, in the Latin tongue, *despicere,* and in the Greek,
*Katablepein,* that is, *to look down;*  <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) so David introduces them as speaking
from on high, because it seems to them that they have nothing in common
with other men, but think themselves a distinct class of beings, and, as
it were, little gods.  <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md)

<span id="viii.ii-p32"></span><span id="viii.ii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p33"></span>**9.** *They have set their mouth against
the heavens.* Here it is declared that they utter their contumelious
speeches as well against God as against men; for they imagine that
nothing is too arduous for them to attempt, and flatter themselves that
heaven and earth are subject to them. If any should endeavor to alarm
them by setting before them the power of God, they audaciously break
through this barrier; and, with respect to men, they have no idea of any
difficulty arising from such a quarter. Thus, there is no obstacle to
repress their proud and vaunting speeches, but *their tongue walketh
through the whole earth.* This form of expression seems to be
hyperbolical; but when we consider how great and unbounded their
presumption is, we will admit that the Psalmist teaches nothing but what
experience shows to be matter of fact.

have purified my heart in vain, and washed my hands daily.  <span

<span id="viii.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.iii-p5"></span><span id="viii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p6"></span>**10.** *On this account his people will
return hither.* Commentators wrest this sentence into a variety of
meanings. In the first place, as the relative *his* is used, without an
antecedent indicating whose people are spoken of, some understand it
simply of the ungodly, as if it had been said, That the ungodly always
fall back upon this reflection: and they view the word *people* as
denoting *a great troop* or *band;* for as soon as a wicked man raises
his standard, he always succeeds in drawing a multitude of associates
after him. They, therefore, think the meaning to be, that every
prosperous ungodly man has people flocking about him, as it were, in
troops; and that, when within his palace or magnificent mansion, they
are content with getting water to drink; so much does this perverse
imagination bewitch them. But there is another sense much more correct,
and which is also approved by the majority of commentators; namely, that
the people of God  <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) return
hither. Some take the word <span id="viii.iii-p7.1"></span>הלם, *halom,*
which we have rendered *hither,* as denoting *afflicted;*  <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) but this is a forced interpretation.

<span id="viii.iii-p11"></span>The meaning is not, however, as yet,
sufficiently evident, and therefore we must inquire into it more
closely.  <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) Some read the whole
verse connectedly, thus: The people of God return hither, that they may
drain full cups of the water of sorrow. But, in my opinion, this verse
depends upon the preceding statements, and the sense is, That many who
had been regarded as belonging to the people of God were carried away by
this temptation, and were even shipwrecked and swallowed up by it. The
prophet does not seem to speak here of the chosen people of God, but
only to point to hypocrites and counterfeit Israelites who occupy a
place in the Church. He declares that such persons are overwhelmed in
destruction, because, being foolishly led away to envy the wicked, and
to desire to follow them,  <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) they
bid adieu to God and to all religion. Still, however, this might,
without any impropriety, be referred to the chosen seed, many of whom
are so violently harassed by this temptation, that they turn aside into
crooked by-paths: not that they devote themselves to wickedness, but
because they do not firmly persevere in the right path. The sense then
will be, that not only the herd of the profane, but even true believers,
who have determined to serve *God,* are tempted with this unlawful and
perverse envy and emulation.  <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md)
What follows, *Waters of a full cup are wrung out to them,*  <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) seems to be the reason of the
statement in the preceding clause, implying that they are tormented with
vexation and sorrow, when no advantage appears to be derived from
cultivating true religion. *To be saturated with waters* is put
metaphorically for to drink the bitterest distresses, and to be filled
with immeasurable sorrows.

<span id="viii.iii-p16"></span><span id="viii.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p17"></span>**11.** *And they say, How doth God
know?* Some commentators maintain that the Prophet here returns to the
ungodly, and relates the scoffings and blasphemies with which they
stimulate and stir up themselves to commit sin; but of this I cannot
approve. David rather explains what he had stated in the preceding
verse, as to the fact that the faithful fall into evil thoughts and
wicked imaginations when the short-lived prosperity of the ungodly
dazzles their eyes. He tells us that they begin then to call in
question, Whether there is knowledge in God. Among worldly men, this
madness is too common. Ovid thus speaks in one of his verses:

<span id="viii.iii-p18"></span>“<span
id="viii.iii-p18.1"></span>Sollicitor nullos esse putare deos;”  
“I am tempted to think that there are no gods.”

<span id="viii.iii-p19"></span>It was, indeed, a heathen poet who spake
in this manner; but as we know that the poets express the common
thoughts of men, and the language which generally predominates in their
minds,  <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) it is certain that he
spake, as it were, in the person of the great mass of mankind, when he
frankly confessed, that as soon as any adversity happens, men forget all
knowledge of God. They not only doubt whether there is a God, but they
even enter into debate with, and chide him. What else is the meaning of
that complaint which we meet with in the ancient Latin Poet-

<span id="viii.iii-p21"></span>“<span id="viii.iii-p21.1"></span>Nec
Saturnius haec oculis pater adspicit aequis:”

<span id="viii.iii-p22"></span>“Nor does the great god, the son of
Saturn, regard these things with impartial eyes,” — but that the woman,
of whom he there speaks, accuses her god Jupiter of unrighteousness,
because she was not dealt with in the way which she desired? It is then
too common, among the unbelieving part of mankind, to deny that God
cares for and governs the world, and to maintain that all is the result
of chance.  <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) But David here
informs us that even true believers stumble in this respect: not that
they break forth into this blasphemy, but because they are unable, all
at once, to keep their minds under restraint when God seems to cease
from executing his office. The expostulation of Jeremiah is well known,

<span id="viii.iii-p24"></span>“Righteous art thou, O Lord! when I plead
with thee; yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth
the way of the wicked prosper? Wherefore are all they happy that deal
very treacherously?” (<span id="viii.iii-p24.1"></span>[Jer
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#001)<span id="viii.iii-p24.1"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.iii-p25"></span>It appears from that passage that even
the godly are tempted to doubt of the Providence of God, but at the same
time that doubts on this subject do not go very deep into their hearts;
for Jeremiah at the outset protests the contrary; and by doing so, puts,
as it were, a bridle upon himself. Yet they do not always so speedily
anticipate the snares of Satan, as to avoid asking, under the influence
of a doubting spirit, how it can happen, if God really regards the
world, that he does not remedy the great confusion which prevails in it?
Of those who impiously prate against God by denying his Providence,
there are two sorts. Some openly pour out their blasphemies, asserting
that God, delighting in ease and pleasure, cares about nothing, but
leaves the government of all things to chance. Others, although they
keep their thoughts on this subject to themselves, and are silent before
men, yet cease not secretly to fret against God, and to accuse him of
injustice or of indolence, in conniving at wickedness, neglecting the
godly, and allowing all things to be involved in confusion, and to go to
wreck. But the people of God, before these perverse and detestable
thoughts enter deep into their hearts, disburden themselves into the
bosom of God,  <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) and their only
desire is to acquiesce in his secret judgments, the reason of which is
hidden from them. The meaning of this passage, therefore, is, that not
only the wicked, when they see things in the world so full of disorder,
conceive only of a blind government, which they attribute to fortune or
chance; but that even true believers themselves are shaken, so as to
doubt of the Providence of God; and that unless they were wonderfully
preserved by his hand, they would be completely swallowed up in this
abyss.

<span id="viii.iii-p27"></span><span id="viii.iii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p28"></span>**12.** *Behold! these are the ungodly.*
The Psalmist here shows, as it were by a vivid pictorial representation,
the character of that envy which had well nigh overthrown him. *Behold!*
says he, *these are wicked men!* and yet they happily enjoy their ease
and pleasures undisturbed, and are exalted to power and influence; and
that not merely for a few days, but their prosperity is of long
duration, and has, as it were, an endless course. And is there anything
which seems to our judgment less reasonable than that persons whose
wickedness is accounted infamous and detestable, even in the eyes of
men, should be treated with such liberality and indulgence by God? Some
here take the Hebrew word <span id="viii.iii-p28.1"></span>עולם, *olam,*
for *the world,* but improperly. It rather denotes in this passage *an
age;*  <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) and what David complains
of is, that the prosperity of the wicked is stable and of long duration,
and that to see it last so long wears out the patience of the righteous.
Upon seeing the wicked so tenderly cherished by God, he descends to the
consideration of his own case; and as his conscience bore him testimony
that he had walked sincerely and uprightly, he reasons with himself as
to what advantage he had derived from studiously devoting himself to the
practice of righteousness, since he was afflicted and harassed in a very
unusual degree. He tells us that he was *scourged daily,* and that as
often as the sun rose, some affliction or other was prepared for him, so
that there was no end to his calamities. In short the amount of his
reasoning is this, “Truly I have labored in vain to obtain and preserve
a pure heart and clean hands, seeing continued afflictions await me,
and, so to speak, are on the watch to meet me at break of day. Such a
condition surely shows that there is no reward for innocence before God,
else he would certainly deal somewhat more compassionately towards those
who serve him.” As the true holiness for which the godly are
distinguished consists of two parts, first, of purity of heart, and,
secondly, of righteousness in the outward conduct, David attributes both
to himself. Let us learn, from his example, to join them together: let
us, in the first place, begin with purity of heart, and then let us give
evidence of this before men by uprightness and integrity in our conduct.

<span id="viii.iv"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm

<span id="viii.iv-p2"></span>**15.** If I should say, I will speak thus,
Behold! the generation of thy children: I have transgressed.  <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) **16.** Although I applied my mind to
know this, it was a trouble \[or, a painful thing\] in my sight; **17.**

<span id="viii.iv-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.iv-p6"></span><span id="viii.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p7"></span>**15.** *If I should say, I will speak
thus.* David, perceiving the sinfulness of the thoughts with which he
was tempted, puts a bridle upon himself, and reproves his inconstancy in
allowing his mind to entertain doubts on such a subject. We can be at no
loss in discovering his meaning; but there is some difficulty or
obscurity in the words. The last Hebrew verb in the verse, <span
id="viii.iv-p7.1"></span>בגד, *bagad,* signifies *to transgress,* and
also *to deceive.* Some, therefore, translate, *I have deceived the
generation of thy children,* as if David had said, Were I to speak thus,
I should defraud thy children of their hope. Others read, *I have
transgressed against the generation of thy children;* that is, Were I to
speak thus, I would be guilty of inflicting an injury upon them. But as
the words of the prophet stand in this order*, Behold! the generation of
thy children: I have transgressed;* and as a very good meaning may be
elicited from them, I would expound them simply in this way: Were I to
approve of such wicked thoughts and doubts, I would transgress; for,
behold! the righteous are still remaining on the earth, and thou
reservest in every age some people for thyself. Thus it will be
unnecessary to make any supplement to complete the sense, and the verb
<span id="viii.iv-p7.2"></span>בגדתי, *bagadti, I have transgressed,*
will read by itself, and not construed with any other part of the verse.
We have elsewhere had occasion to observe, that the Hebrew noun <span
id="viii.iv-p7.3"></span>דור, *dor*, which we have rendered
*generation,* is properly to be referred to time. The idea which David
intends to convey is now perfectly obvious. Whilst worldly men give
loose reins to their unhallowed speculations, until at length they
become hardened, and, divesting themselves of all fear of God, cast away
along with it the hope of salvation, he restrains himself that he may
not rush into the like destruction. *To speak* or *to declare*  <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) here signifies *to utter what had been
meditated upon.* His meaning, therefore, is, that had he pronounced
judgment on this subject as of a thing certain, he would have been
chargeable with a very heinous transgression. He found himself before
involved in doubt, but now he acknowledges that he had grievously
offended; and the reason of this he places between the words in which he
expresses these two states of mind: which is, because God always sees to
it, that there are some of his own people remaining in the world. He
seems to repeat the demonstrative particle, *Behold!* for the sake of
contrast. He had a little before said, *Behold! these are the ungodly;*
and here he says, *Behold! the generation of thy children.* It is
assuredly nothing less than a divine miracle that the Church, which is
so furiously assaulted by Satan and innumerable hosts of enemies,
continues safe.

<span id="viii.iv-p11"></span><span id="viii.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p12"></span>**16.** *Although I applied my mind to
know this.* The first verb <span id="viii.iv-p12.1"></span>חשב,
*chashab,* which he employs, properly signifies *to reckon* or *count,*
and sometimes *to consider* or *weigh.* But the words which follow in
the sentence require the sense which I have given, That he applied his
mind to know the part of Divine Providence referred to. He has already
condemned himself for having transgressed; but still he acknowledges,
that until he entered into the sanctuaries of God, he was not altogether
disentangled from the doubts with which his mind had been perplexed. In
short, he intimates that he had reflected on this subject on all sides,
and yet, by all his reasoning upon it, could not comprehend how God,
amidst so great disorders and confusions, continued to govern the world.
Moreover, in speaking thus of himself, he teaches us, that when men are
merely under the guidance of their own understandings, the inevitable
consequence is, that they sink under their trouble, not being able by
their own deliberations and reasonings to arrive at any certain or fixed
conclusions; for there is no doubt that he puts *the sanctuaries of God*
in opposition to carnal reason. Hence it follows, that all the knowledge
and wisdom which men have of their own is vain and unsubstantial; since
all true wisdom among men — all that deserves to be so called — consists
in this one point,  <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) That they
are docile, and implicitly submit to the teaching of the Word of God.
The Psalmist does not speak of unbelievers who are wilfully blind, who
involve themselves in errors, and are also very glad to find some color
or pretext for taking offense, that they may withdraw to a distance from
God. It is of himself that he speaks; and although he applied his mind
to the investigation of divine subjects, not only earnestly, but with
all humility; and although, at the same time, he contemplated, according
to his small measure, the high judgments of God, not only with
attention, but also with reverence, yet he confesses that he failed of
success; for the word *trouble*  <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md)
here implies unprofitable or lost labor. Whoever, therefore, in applying
himself to the examination of God’s judgments, expects to become
acquainted with them by his natural understanding, will be disappointed,
and will find that he is engaged in a task at once painful and
profitless; and, therefore, it is indispensably necessary to rise
higher, and to seek illumination from heaven.

<span id="viii.iv-p15"></span><span id="viii.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p16"></span>By *the sanctuaries of God* some, even
among the Hebrews, understand the celestial mansions in which the
spirits of the just and angels dwell; as if David had said, This was a
painful thing in my sight, until I came to acknowledge in good earnest
that men are not created to flourish for a short time in this world, and
to luxuriate in pleasures while in it, but that their condition here is
that of pilgrims, whose aspirations, during their earthly pilgrimage,
should be towards heaven. I readily admit that no man can form a right
judgment of the providence of God; but he who elevates his mind above
the earth; but it is more simple and natural to understand the word
*sanctuary* as denoting celestial doctrine. As the book of the law was
laid up in the sanctuary, from which the oracles of heaven were to be
obtained, that is to say, the declaration of the will of God,  <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) and as this was the true way of
acquiring profitable instruction, David very properly puts *entering
into the sanctuaries,*  <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) for
*coming to the school of God,* as if his meaning were this, Until God
become my schoolmaster, and until I learn by his word what otherwise my
mind, when I come to consider the government of the world, cannot
comprehend, I stop short all at once, and understand nothing about the
subject. When, therefore, we are here told that men are unfit for
contemplating the arrangements of Divine Providence until they obtain
wisdom elsewhere than from themselves, how can we attain to wisdom but
by submissively receiving what God teaches us both by his Word and by
his Holy Spirit? David by the word *sanctuary* alludes to the external
manner of teaching, which God had appointed among his ancient people;
but along with the Word he comprehends the secret illumination of the
Holy Spirit.

<span id="viii.iv-p19"></span>By the *end* of the wicked is not meant
their exit from the world, or their departure from the present life,
which is seen of all men — for what need was there to enter into the
sanctuaries of God to understand that? — but the word *end* is to be
regarded as referring to the judgments of God, by which he makes it
manifest that, even when he is commonly thought to be asleep, he only
delays to a convenient time the execution of the punishment which the
wicked deserve. This must be explained at greater length. If we would
learn from God what is the condition of the ungodly, he teaches us, that
after having flourished for some short time, they suddenly decay; and
that although they may happen to enjoy a continued course of prosperity
until death, yet all that is nothing, since their life itself is
nothing. As, then, God declares that all the wicked shall miserably
perish, if we behold him executing manifest vengeance upon them in this
life, let us remember that it is the judgment of God. If, on the
contrary, we do not perceive any punishment inflicted on them in this
world, let us beware of thinking that they have escaped, or that they
are the objects of the Divine favor and approbation;  <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) but let us rather suspend our
judgment, since the end or the last day has not yet arrived. In short,
if we would profit aright, when we address ourselves to the
consideration of the works of God, we must first beseech him to open our
eyes, (for these are sheer fools who would of themselves be
clear-sighted, and of a penetrating judgment;) and, secondly, we must
also give all due respect to his word, by assigning to it that authority
to which it is entitled.

<span id="viii.v"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.v-p5"></span><span id="viii.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p6"></span>**18.** *Surely thou hast set them in
slippery places.* David, having now gone through his conflicts, begins,
if we may use the expression, to be a new man; and he speaks with a
quiet and composed mind, being, as it were, elevated on a watchtower,
from which he obtained a clear and distinct view of things which before
were hidden from him. It was the prophet Habakkuk’s resolution to take
such a position, and, by his example, he prescribes this to us as a
remedy in the midst of troubles — “I will stand upon my watch,” says he,
“and set me upon the tower,” (<span id="viii.v-p6.1"></span>[Hab
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#001)<span id="viii.v-p6.1"></span>..md)
David, therefore, shows how much advantage is to be derived from
approaching God. I now see, says he, how thou proceedest in thy
providence; for, although the ungodly continue to stand for a brief
season, yet they are, as it were, perched on slippery places,  <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) that they may fall ere long into
destruction. Both the verbs of this verse are in the past tense; but the
first, *to set them in slippery places,* is to be understood of the
present time, as if it had been said, — God for a short period thus
lifts them up on high, that when they fall their fall may be the
heavier. This, it is true, seems to be the lot of the righteous as well
as of the wicked; for everything in this world is slippery, uncertain,
and changeable. But as true believers depend upon heaven, or rather, as
the power of God is the foundation on which they rest, it is not said of
them that they are set in slippery places, notwithstanding the frailty
and uncertainty which characterises their condition in this world. What
although they stumble or even fall, the Lord has his hand under them to
sustain and strengthen them when they stumble, and to raise them up when
they are fallen. The uncertainty of the condition of the ungodly, or, as
it is here expressed, their slippery condition, proceeds from this, that
they take pleasure in contemplating their own power and greatness, and
admire themselves on that account, just like a person who would walk at
leisure upon ice;  <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) and thus by
their infatuated presumption, they prepare themselves for falling down
headlong. We are not to picture to our imaginations a wheel of fortune,
which, as it revolves, embroils all things in confusion; but we must
admit the truth to which the prophet here adverts, and which he tells us
is made known to all the godly in the sanctuary, that there is a secret
providence of God which manages all the affairs of the world. On this
subject my readers, if they choose, may peruse the beautiful verses of
Claudian in his first book against Ruffinus.

<span id="viii.v-p9"></span><span id="viii.v-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p10"></span>**19.** *How have they been destroyed, as
it were in a moment!* The language of wonder in which the Psalmist
breaks forth serves much to confirm the sentiment of the preceding
verse. As the consideration of the prosperity of the ungodly induces a
torpor upon our minds, yea, even renders them stupid; so their
destruction, being sudden and unlooked for, tends the more effectually
to awaken us, each being thus constrained to inquire how such an event
came to pass, which all men thought could never happen. The prophet,
therefore, speaks of it in the way of interrogation, as of a thing
incredible. Yet he, at the same time, thus teaches us that God is daily
working in such a manner as that, if we would but open our eyes, there
would be presented to us just matter for exciting our astonishment. Nay,
rather, if by faith we would look from a distance at the judgments of
God daily approaching nearer and nearer, nothing would happen which we
would regard as strange or difficult to be believed; for the surprise
which we feel proceeds from the slowness and carelessness with which we
proceed in acquiring the knowledge of Divine truth.  <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) When it is said, *They are consumed
with terrors,* it may be understood in two ways. It either means that
God thunders upon them in such an unusual manner, that the very
strangeness of it strikes them with dismay; or that God, although he may
not lay his hand upon his enemies, nevertheless throws them into
consternation, and brings them to nothing, solely by the terror of his
breath, at the very time when they are recklessly despising all dangers,
as if they were perfectly safe, and had made a covenant with death.
 <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) Thus we have before seen David
introducing them as encouraging themselves in their forwardness by this
boasting language, “Who is lord over us?” (<span
id="viii.v-p12.2"></span>[Ps 12:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa012.htm#004.md)<span
id="viii.v-p12.2"></span>.) I am rather inclined to adopt the first
sense; and the reason which leads me to do so is, that when God
perceives that we are so slow in considering his judgments, he inflicts
upon the ungodly judgments of a very severe kind, and pursues them with
unusual tokens of his wrath, as if he would make the earth to tremble,
in order thereby to correct our dullness of apprehension.

<span id="viii.v-p13"></span><span id="viii.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p14"></span>**20.** *As it were a dream after a man is
awakened.* This similitude is often to be met with in the Sacred
Writings. Thus, Isaiah, (<span id="viii.v-p14.1"></span>[Isa
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#007)<span id="viii.v-p14.1"></span>,.md)
speaking of the enemies of the Church, says, “They shall be as a dream
of a night vision.” To quote other texts of a similar kind would be
tedious and unnecessary labor. In the passage before us the metaphor is
very appropriate. How is it to be accounted for, that the prosperity of
the wicked is regarded with so much wonder, but because our minds have
been lulled into a deep sleep? and, in short, the pictures which we draw
in our imaginations of the happiness of the wicked, and of the
desirableness of their condition, are just like the imaginary kingdoms
which we construct in our dreams when we are asleep. Those who, being
illuminated by the Word of God, are awake, may indeed be in some degree
impressed with the splendor with which the wicked are invested; but they
are not so dazzled by it as thereby to have their wonder very much
excited; for they are prevented from feeling in this manner by a light
of an opposite kind far surpassing it in brilliancy and attraction. The
prophet, therefore, commands us to awake, that we may perceive that all
which we gaze at in this world is nothing else than pure vanity; even as
he himself, now returning to his right mind, acknowledges that he had
before been only dreaming and raving. The reason is added, because God
*will make their image to be despised,* or *render it contemptible.* By
the word *image* some understand the soul of man, because it was formed
after the image of God. But in my opinion, this exposition is
unsuitable; for the prophet simply derides the outward pomp or show
 <span id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) which dazzles the eyes of men,
while yet it vanishes away in an instant. We have met with a similar
form of expression in <span id="viii.v-p19.4"></span>[Ps
39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.v-p19.4"></span>,
“Surely every man passeth away in an image,” the import of which is,
Surely every man flows away like water that has no solidity, or rather
like the image reflected in the mirror which has no substance. The word
*image,* then, in this passage means what we commonly term *appearance,*
or *outward show;* and thus the prophet indirectly rebukes the error
into which we fall, when we regard as real and substantial those things
which are merely phantoms created out of nothing by our imaginations.
The word <span id="viii.v-p19.5"></span>בעיר, *bair,* properly signifies
*in the city.*  <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) But as this
would be a rigid form of expression, it has been judiciously thought by
many that the word is curtailed of a letter, and that it is the same as
<span id="viii.v-p20.6"></span>בהעיר, *bahair;* an opinion which is also
supported from the point *kamets* being placed under <span
id="viii.v-p20.7"></span>ב, *beth.* According to this view it is to be
translated *in awakening,* that is, after these dreams which deceive us
shall have passed away. And that takes place not only when God restores
to some measure of order matters which before were involved in
confusion, but also when dispelling the darkness he gladdens our minds
with a friendly light. We never, it is true, see things so well adjusted
in the world as we would desire; for God, with the view of keeping us
always in the exercise of hope, delays the perfection of our state to
the final day of judgment. But whenever he stretches forth his hand
against the wicked, he causes us to see as it were some rays of the
break of day, that the darkness, thickening too much, may not lull us
asleep, and affect us with dullness of understanding.  <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) Some apply this expression, *in
awaking,* to the last judgment,  <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md)
as if David intended to say, In this world the wicked abound in riches
and power, and this confusion, which is as it were a dark night, will
continue until God shall raise the dead. I certainly admit that this is
a profitable doctrine; but it is not taught us in this place, the scope
of the passage not at all agreeing with such an interpretation. If any
prefer reading *in the city* — *in the city thou wilt make their image
to be despised,* — the meaning will be, that when God is pleased to
bring into contempt the transitory beauty and vain show of the wicked,
it will not be a secret or hidden vengeance, but will be quite manifest
and known to all, as if it were done in the public market place of a
city. But the word *awaking* suits better, as it is put in opposition to
*dreaming.*

73:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#021.md)<span
id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p2"></span>**21.** For my heart was in a ferment, and
I was pierced in my reins. **22.** And I was foolish and ignorant: I was
with thee as a brute beast. **23.** Nevertheless I was continually with
thee; thou didst hold my right hand. **24.** Thou shalt guide me with
thy counsel; and at length thou shalt take me to \[or receive me into\]
glory.

<span id="viii.vi-p3"></span> 

<span id="viii.vi-p4"></span><span id="viii.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p5"></span>**21.** *For my heart was in a ferment.*
The Psalmist again returns to the confession which he had previously
made, acknowledging that whilst he felt his heart pierced with perverse
envy and emulation, he had complained against God, in a peevish or
fretful manner. He compares his anger to *leaven.* Some translate, *My
heart was steeped in vinegar.* But it is more suitable to explain the
verb thus, *My heart was soured* or *swollen,* as dough is swollen by
leaven. Thus Plautus, when speaking of a woman inflamed with anger, says
that she is all in a ferment.  <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md)
Some read the last clause of the verse, *My reins were pierced;* and
they think that <span id="viii.vi-p6.3"></span>א, *aleph,* in the
beginning of the word, <span id="viii.vi-p6.4"></span>אשתונן,
*eshtonan,* the verb for *pierced,* is put instead of <span
id="viii.vi-p6.5"></span>ה, *he;*  <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) but this makes little difference as to
the sense. We know that the word <span id="viii.vi-p7.1"></span>כליות,
*kelayoth,* by which the Hebrews denote *the reins,* comes from the verb
<span id="viii.vi-p7.2"></span>כלא, *kalah,* which signifies *to desire,
to covet earnestly,* this word being put for the reins, because it is
said that the desires of man have their seat in that part of the body.
David therefore declares that these perplexing and troublesome thoughts
had been, as it were, thorns which pierced him.  <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) We have already stated how he came to
be affected with this pungent and burning vexation of spirit. We will
find many worldly men who, although they deny that the world is governed
by the Providence of God, yet do not greatly disquiet themselves, but
only laugh at the freaks of Fortune. On the other hand, true believers,
the more firmly they are persuaded that God is the judge of the world,
are the more afflicted when his procedure does not correspond to their
wishes.

<span id="viii.vi-p9"></span><span id="viii.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p10"></span>**22.** *And I was foolish and ignorant.*
David here rebuking himself sharply, as it became him to do, in the
first place declares that he was foolish; secondly, he charges himself
with ignorance; and, thirdly, he affirms that he resembled the brutes.
Had he only acknowledged his ignorance, it might have been asked, Whence
this vice or fault of ignorance proceeded? He therefore ascribes it to
his own folly; and the more emphatically to express his folly, he
compares himself to the lower animals. The amount is, that the perverse
envy of which he has spoken arose from ignorance and error, and that the
blame of having thus erred was to be imputed wholly to himself, inasmuch
as he had lost a sound judgment and understanding, and that not after an
ordinary manner, but even the length of being reduced to a state of
brutish stupidity. What we have previously stated is undoubtedly true,
that men never form a right judgment of the works of God; for when they
apply their minds to consider them, all their faculties fail, being
inadequate to the task; yet David justly lays the blame of failure upon
himself, because, having lost the judgment of a man, he had fallen as it
were into the rank of the brute creatures. Whenever we are dissatisfied
with the manner of God’s providence in governing the world, let us
remember that this is to be traced to the perversity of our
understanding. The Hebrew word <span id="viii.vi-p10.1"></span>עמך,
*immach,* which we have translated *with thee,* is here to be taken by
way of comparison for *before thee;* as if David had said, — Lord,
although I have seemed in this world to be endued with superior judgment
and reason, yet in respect of thy celestial wisdom, I have been as one
of the lower animals. It is with the highest propriety that he has
inserted this particle. To what is it owing, that men are so deceived by
their own folly, as we find them to be, if it is not to this, that while
they look at each other, they all inwardly flatter themselves? Among the
blind, each thinks that he has one eye, in other words, that he excels
the rest; or, at least, he pleases himself with the reflection, that his
fellows are in no respect superior to himself in wisdom. But when
persons come to God, and compare themselves with him, this prevailing
error, in which all are fast asleep, can find no place.

<span id="viii.vi-p11"></span><span id="viii.vi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p12"></span>**23** *Nevertheless I was continually
with thee.*  <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) Here the Psalmist
declares, in a different sense, that he was *with God.* He gives him
thanks for having kept him from utterly falling, when he was in so great
danger of being precipitated into destruction. The greatness of the
favor to which he adverts is the more strikingly manifested from the
confession which he made a little before, that he was bereft of
judgment, and, as it were, a brute beast; for he richly deserved to be
cast off by *God,* when he dared to murmur against him. Men are said to
be with God in two ways; either, first, in respect of apprehension and
thought, when they are persuaded that they live in his presence, are
governed by his hand, and sustained by his power; or, secondly, when
God, unperceived by them, puts upon them a bridle, by which, when they
go astray, he secretly restrains them, and prevents them from totally
apostatising from him. When a man therefore imagines that God exercises
no care about him, he is not *with God,* as to his own feeling or
apprehension; but still that man, if he is not forsaken, abides with
God, inasmuch as God’s secret or hidden grace continues with him. In
short, God is always near his chosen ones; for although they sometimes
turn their backs upon him, he nevertheless has always his fatherly eye
turned towards them. When the Psalmist speaks of God as *holding him by
the right hand,* he means that he was, by the wonderful power of God,
drawn back from that deep gulf into which the reprobate cast themselves.
He then ascribes it wholly to the grace of God that he was enabled to
restrain himself from breaking forth into open blasphemies, and from
hardening himself in error, and that he was also brought to condemn
himself of foolishness; — this he ascribes wholly to the grace of God,
who stretched out his hand to hold him up, and prevent him from a fall
which would have involved him in destruction. From this we see how
precious our salvation is in the sight of God; for when we wander far
from him, he yet continues to look upon us with a watchful eye, and to
stretch forth his hand to bring us to himself. We must indeed beware of
perverting this doctrine by making it a pretext for slothfulness; but
experience nevertheless teaches us, that when we are sunk in drowsiness
and insensibility, God exercises a care about us, and that even when we
are fugitives and wanderers from him, he is still near us. The force of
the metaphor contained in the language, which represents God as *holding
us by the right hand,* is to be particularly noticed; for there is no
temptation, let it be never so slight, which would not easily overthrow
us, were we not upheld and sustained by the power of God. The reason
then why we do not succumb, even in the severest conflicts, is nothing
else than because we receive the aid of the Holy Spirit. He does not
indeed always put forth his power in us in an evident and striking
manner, (for he often perfects it in our weakness;) but it is enough
that he succours us, although we may be ignorant and unconscious of it,
that he upholds us when we stumble, and even lifts us up when we have
fallen.

<span id="viii.vi-p14"></span><span id="viii.vi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p15"></span>**24.** *Thou shalt guide me with thy
counsel.* As the verbs are put in the future tense, the natural meaning,
in my opinion, is, that the Psalmist assured himself that the Lord,
since by his leading he had now brought him back into the right way,
would continue henceforth to guide him, until at length he received him
into His glorious presence in heaven. We know that it is David’s usual
way, when he gives thanks to God, to look forward with confidence to the
future. Accordingly, after having acknowledged his own infirmities, he
celebrated the grace of God, the aid and comfort of which he had
experienced; and now he cherishes the hope that the Divine assistance
will continue hereafter to be extended to him. *Guidance by counsel* is
put first. Although the foolish and inconsiderate are sometimes very
successful in their affairs, (for God remedies our faults and errors,
and turns to a prosperous and happy issue things which we had entered
upon amiss;) yet the way in which God ordinarily and more abundantly
blesses his own people is by giving them wisdom: and we should ask him
especially to govern us by the Spirit of counsel and of judgment.
Whoever dares, in a spirit of confident reliance on his own wisdom, to
engage in any undertaking, will inevitably be involved in confusion and
shame for his presumption, since he arrogates to himself what is
peculiar to God alone. If David needed to have God for his guide, how
much more need have we of being under the Divine guidance? *To counsel*
there is added *glory,* which, I think, ought not to be limited to
eternal life, as some are inclined to do. It comprehends the whole
course of our happiness from the commencement, which is seen here upon
earth, even to the consummation which we expect to realize in heaven.
David then assures himself of eternal glory, through the free and
unmerited favor of God, and yet he does not exclude the blessings which
God bestows upon his people here below, with the view of affording them,
even in this life, some foretaste of that felicity.

<span id="viii.vii-p7"></span> 

<span id="viii.vii-p8"></span><span id="viii.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p9"></span>**25.** *Whom have I in heaven but thee?*
The Psalmist shows more distinctly how much he had profited in the
sanctuary of God; for being satisfied with him alone, he rejects every
other object, except God, which presented itself to him. The form of
expression which he employs, when he joins together an interrogation and
an affirmation, is quite common in the Hebrew tongue, although harsh in
other languages. As to the meaning, there is no ambiguity. David
declares that he desires nothing, either in heaven or in earth, except
God alone, and that without God, all other objects which usually draw
the hearts of men towards them were unattractive to him. And,
undoubtedly, God then obtains from us the glory to which he is entitled,
when, instead of being carried first to one object, and then to another,
we hold exclusively by him, being satisfied with him alone. If we give
the smallest portion of our affections to the creatures, we in so far
defraud God of the honor which belongs to him. And yet nothing has been
more common in all ages than this sacrilege, and it prevails too much at
the present day. How small is the number of those who keep their
affections fixed on God alone! We see how superstition joins to him many
others as rivals for our affections. While the Papists admit in word
that all things depend upon God, they are, nevertheless, constantly
seeking to obtain help from this and the other quarter independent of
him. Others, puffed up with pride, have the effrontery to associate
either themselves or other men with God. On this account we ought the
more carefully to attend to this doctrine, That it is unlawful for us to
desire any other object besides God. By the words *heaven and earth* the
Psalmist denotes every conceivable object; but, at the same time, he
seems purposely to point to these two in particular. In saying that he
sought none in heaven but God only, he rejects and renounces all the
false gods with which, through the common error and folly of mankind,
heaven has been filled. When he affirms that he desires none on the
earth besides God, he has, I suppose, a reference to the deceits and
illusions with which almost the whole world is intoxicated; for those
who are not beguiled by the former artifice of Satan, so as to be led to
fabricate for themselves false gods, either deceive themselves by
arrogance when confiding in their own skill, or strength, or prudence,
they usurp the prerogatives which belong to God alone; or else trepan
themselves with deceitful allurements when they rely upon the favor of
men, or confide in their own riches and other helps which they possess.
If, then, we would seek God aright, we must beware of going astray into
various by-paths, and divested of all superstition and pride, must
betake ourselves directly and exclusively to Him. This is the only way
of seeking him. The expression, *I have desired none other with thee,*
amounts to this: I know that thou by thyself, apart from every other
object, art sufficient, yea, more than sufficient for me, and therefore
I do not suffer myself to be carried away after a variety of desires,
but rest in and am fully contented with thee. In short, that we may be
satisfied with God alone, it is of importance for us to know the
plenitude of the blessings which he offers for our acceptance.

<span id="viii.vii-p10"></span><span id="viii.vii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p11"></span>**26.** *My flesh and my heart have
failed.* Some understand the first part of the verse as meaning that
David’s heart and flesh failed him through the ardent desire with which
he was actuated; and they think that by it he intends to testify the
earnestness with which he applied his mind to God. We meet with a
similar form of expression elsewhere; but the clause immediately
succeeding, *God is the strength of my heart,* seems to require that it
should be explained differently. I am rather disposed to think that
there is here a contrast between the *failing* which David felt in
himself and the *strength* with which he was divinely supplied; as if he
had said, Separated from God I am nothing, and all that I attempt to do
ends in nothing; but when I come to him, I find an abundant supply of
strength. It is highly necessary for us to consider what we are without
God; for no man will cast himself wholly upon God, but he who feels
himself in a fainting condition, and who despairs of the sufficiency of
his own powers. We will seek nothing from God but what we are conscious
of wanting in ourselves. Indeed, all men confess this, and the greater
part think that all which is necessary is that God should aid our
infirmities, or afford us succor when we have not the means of
adequately relieving ourselves. But the confession of David is far more
ample than this when he lays, so to speak, his own nothingness before
God. He, therefore, very properly adds, that *God is his portion.* The
portion of an individual is a figurative expression, employed in
Scripture to denote the condition or lot with which every man is
contented. Accordingly, the reason why God is represented as a portion
is, because he alone is abundantly sufficient for us, and because in him
the perfection of our happiness consists. Whence it follows, that we are
chargeable with ingratitude, if we turn away our minds from him and fix
them on any other object, as has been stated in <span
id="viii.vii-p11.1"></span>[Ps
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004.md)<span id="viii.vii-p11.1"></span>,
where David explains more clearly the import of the metaphor. Some
foolishly assert that God is called our *portion,* because our soul is
taken from him. I know not how such a silly conceit has found its way
into their brains; for it is as far from David’s meaning as heaven is
from the earth, and it involves in it the wild notion of the Manicheans,
with which Servetus was bewitched. But it generally happens that men who
are not exercised in the Scriptures, nor imbued with sound theology,
although well acquainted with the Hebrew language, yet err and fall into
mistakes even in first principles. Under the word *heart* the Psalmist
comprehends the whole soul. He does not, however, mean, when he speaks
of *the heart failing,* that the essence or substance of the soul fails,
but that all the powers which God in his goodness has bestowed upon it,
and the use of which it retains only so long as he pleases, fall into
decay.

<span id="viii.vii-p12"></span><span id="viii.vii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p13"></span>**27.** *For, lo! they who depart from
thee shall perish.* Here he proves, by an argument taken from things
contrary, that nothing was better for him than simply to repose himself
upon God alone; for no sooner does any one depart from God than he
inevitably falls into the most dreadful destruction. All depart from him
who divide and scatter their hope among a variety of objects. The phrase
*to go a whoring*  <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) is of similar
import; for it is the worst kind of adultery to divide our heart that it
may not continue fixed exclusively upon God. This will be more easily
understood by defining the spiritual chastity of our minds, which
consists in faith, in calling upon God, in integrity of heart, and in
obedience to the Word. Whoever then submits not himself to the Word of
God, that feeling him to be the sole author of all good things, he may
depend upon him, surrender himself to be governed by him, betake himself
to him at all times, and devote to him all his affections, such a person
is like an adulterous woman who leaves her own husband, and prostitutes
herself to strangers. David’s language then is equivalent to his
pronouncing all apostates who revolt from God to be adulterers.

<span id="viii.vii-p15"></span><span id="viii.vii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p16"></span>**28.** *As for me, it is good for me to
draw near to God.* Literally the reading is, *And I, etc.* David
speaking expressly of himself, affirms that although he should see all
mankind in a state of estrangement from God, and wandering after the
ever-changing errors and superstitions of the world, he would
nevertheless study to continue always in a state of nearness to God. Let
others perish, says he, if their headstrong passions cannot be
restrained, and they themselves prevented from running after the deceits
of the world; but *as for me,* I will continue steadfast in the
resolution of maintaining a sacred communion with God. In the subsequent
clause he informs us that we draw near to God in a right manner when our
confidence continues firmly fixed in him. God will not hold us by his
right hand unless we are fully persuaded of the impossibility of our
continuing steadfast and safe in any other way than by his grace alone.
This passage is worthy of notice, that we may not be carried away by
evil examples, to join ourselves to the wicked, and to act as they do,
although even the whole world should fall into unbelief; but that we may
learn to gather in our affections from other objects, and to confine
them exclusively to God. In the close, the Psalmist intimates that after
he shall have devoted himself to God alone, he shall never want matter
for praising him, since God never disappoints the hope which his people
repose in him. From this it follows, that none curse God or murmur
against him, but those who wilfully shut their eyes and involve
themselves in darkness, lest knowing and observing his providence, they
should be induced to give themselves up to his faithfulness and
protection.

one other place of Scripture, <span id="viii.ii-p12.3"></span>[Isa
58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.ii-p12.3"></span>,
where in all the ancient versions it is rendered *bands* But *bands*
will bear various significations. In the Hebrew style it often signifies
*the pangs of child-birth*; and therefore the meaning here may be, *they
have no pangs in their death*; *i* *e*., they die an easy death, being
suffered to live on to extreme old age, when the flame of life gradually
and quietly becomes extinct. It was also used by the Hebrews to express
*diseases* of any kind, and this is the sense, in which Calvin
understands it. Thus Jesus says of the “woman who had a spirit of
infirmity,” a sore disease inflicted upon her by an evil spirit,
“eighteen years,” “Thou art loosed from thine infirmity,” (and loosing,
we know, applies to bands:) he again describes her as “this daughter of
Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years;” and farther
says, “Ought she not to be loosed from this bond?” that is, cured of
this sickness? <span id="viii.ii-p12.4"></span>[Luke
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#012.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/luk013.htm#016.md)<span id="viii.ii-p12.4"></span>.
According to this view, the meaning will be, *they have no violent
diseases in their death* Horsley reads, “There is no fatality in their
death.” After observing that the word <span
id="viii.ii-p12.5"></span>חרצבות, translated *bands*, occurs but in one
other place in the whole Bible, <span id="viii.ii-p12.6"></span>[Isa
58:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.ii-p12.6"></span>;
where the LXX. have rendered it <span
id="viii.ii-p12.7"></span>συνδεσμον, and the Vulgate <span
id="viii.ii-p12.8"></span>*colligationes*, he says, “From its sense
there, and from its seeming affinity with the roots <span
id="viii.ii-p12.9"></span>חרף and <span id="viii.ii-p12.10"></span>צבה,
I should guess that in a secondary and figurative sense, the word may
denote the strongest of all bands or knots, physical necessity, or fate;
and in that sense it may be taken here. The complaint is, that the
ordinary constitution of the world is supposed to contain no certain
provision for the extermination of the impious; that there is no
necessary and immediate connection between moral evil and physical,
wickedness and death.” The Septuagint reads, <span
id="viii.ii-p12.11"></span>ὅτι οὺκ ἔστιν ἀνάνευσις ἐν τῶ Θανάτω αὐτῶν:
“For there is no sign of reluctance in their death.” The Vulgate, “<span
id="viii.ii-p12.12"></span>Quia non est respectus morti eorum;” “For
they do not think of dying,” or, “For they take no notice of their
death.” The Chaldee, “They are not terrified or troubled on account of
the day of their death.”

*Pride compassed* these prosperous wicked men *about as a chain*; they
wore it for an ornament as gold chains or collars were worn about the
neck; discovering it by their stately carriage. See <span

3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md)<span id="viii.ii-p18.2"></span>.

<span id="viii.iii-p8"></span> “Abu Walid,” says Hammond, “hath a
peculiar way of rendering <span id="viii.iii-p8.1"></span>הלם, as if it
were <span id="viii.iii-p8.2"></span>הלם, the infinitive, *with breaking
of spirit*.” A similar interpretation is adopted by Horsley. “For <span
id="viii.iii-p8.3"></span>הלם,” says he, “many MSS. read <span
id="viii.iii-p8.4"></span>הלום, which I take as the participle *Pual* of
the verb <span id="viii.iii-p8.5"></span>הלם, ‘<span
id="viii.iii-p8.6"></span>Contusus miseria,’ scilicet.” He reads,

<span id="viii.iii-p9"></span>“Therefore his \[God’s\] people sit
woebegone.”

<span id="viii.iii-p10"></span>To make out this translation, he adopts
another of the various readings of MSS. “For <span
id="viii.iii-p10.1"></span>ישיב,” says he, “many MSS. have <span
id="viii.iii-p10.2"></span>ישוב: I would transpose the *vau*, and read
<span id="viii.iii-p10.3"></span>יושב. The third person future,
*Hophal*, signifies *is made to sit*, *is settled*, attended with grief
and consternation at the unpunished audacity of the profane.”

<span id="viii.iii-p14"></span> While Calvin admits that the words, *his
people*, may refer to true believers, he conceives that carnal and
hypocritical Israelites are rather intended. One great objection to the
opinion, that true believers are at all intended is, that stumbled
though they often are at the unequal distributions of the present state,
and chargeable though they may be with entertaining murmuring thoughts
in reference to this matter, we can scarcely suppose that they would so
far depart from every principle of truth and propriety, as to break
forth into such language as is ascribed in verse 11th to the persons
here spoken of, “How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the Most
High?” Neither David nor Jeremiah, though much perplexed in reconciling
the prosperity of the wicked and the afflicted state of God’s people,
with the righteousness and goodness of Divine Providence, ever gave
utterance to any such language. See <span id="viii.iii-p14.1"></span>[Ps
38](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.iii-p14.1"></span>
and <span id="viii.iii-p14.2"></span>[Jer
12](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.iii-p14.2"></span>.
Walford thinks that “it is far more agreeable to the design of the
entire passage, to interpret the words, *his people*, of the friends and
connections of the wicked, who imitate their actions.” In support of
this it may be observed, that the description of the condition, conduct,
and words, of these prosperous ungodly men, commences at the 4th verse,
and seems to be continued to the 13th verse, where the Psalmist’s
reflections upon the subject begin, and are continued to the close of
the psalm.

inwardly seizing upon their minds and consciences, as at the time of
temporal calamities, or at death, and certainly at the judgment, when
the awful sentence will be pronounced upon them. See <span

<span id="viii.v-p15"></span> With this agree Bishop Horsley and Dr Adam

O Lord! thou renderest their vain show contemptible.”

<span id="viii.v-p17"></span>The latter: —

Destroy their shadowy grandeur.”

<span id="viii.v-p19"></span>The original word, <span
id="viii.v-p19.1"></span>צלם *tselem*, for *image*, means *likeness*,
corporeal or incorporeal; and it agrees with <span
id="viii.v-p19.2"></span>צל, *tsel*, *a shade*, because an image is, as
if the shade or shadow of the body. See Bythner on <span
id="viii.v-p19.3"></span>[Ps 39:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa039.htm#006.md)<span
id="viii.v-p19.3"></span>. “It seems to be taken here,” says Hammond,
“for that which hath a fantastical only in opposition to a real
substantial being.” “The Hebrew term,” says Walford, “means an
unsubstantial appearance, splendid while it continues, but which in an
instant disappears.” The prosperity which wicked men for a time enjoy,
their greatness, riches, honor, and happiness, however dazzling and
imposing, is thus nothing more than an *image* or *shadow* of
prosperity, an empty phantom; and within a short period it ceases to be
even so much as a shadow, it absolutely vanishes and comes to nothing,
convincing the good but afflicted man, to whom it seemed to involve in
doubt the rectitude of the Divine government, what is its real
character, and that it should never occasion any perplexity to the
student of Divine Providence.

<span id="viii.v-p21"></span> “As *a dream of one who awaketh*. The
thought here is, as a pleasing dream vanishes instantly on awaking, so
the pleasures of these men will vanish, and show their unsubstantial
nature, when God shall effect his righteous judgement.” — *Walford*.
Then the prosperity of the wicked is seen to be fantastic, and to
consist only of “such stuff as dreams are made of.”

<span id="viii.v-p22"></span> “The Chaldee in their paraphrase refer it
to the day of judgment, when wicked men shall rise out of their graves,
and God proceed in wrath against them, (<span
id="viii.v-p22.1"></span>תבסר ברגז דמותהון, ‘in fury shalt thou scorn or
despise them,’) according to that expression of <span
id="viii.v-p22.2"></span>[Da 12:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#002.md)<span
id="viii.v-p22.2"></span>, ‘Many of them that sleep in the dust of the
earth shall awake, some to shame and everlasting contempt.’” — *Hammond*

<span id="viii.vi-p6"></span> Plautus’ words are, “<span
id="viii.vi-p6.1"></span>Mea uxor tota in fermento jacet;” “My wife lies
all in a ferment.” In like manner he says, “<span
id="viii.vi-p6.2"></span>Ecquid habet acetum in pectore?” “Has he any
vinegar in his breast?”

<span id="viii.vi-p7"></span> This is Kimchi’s and Houbigant’s opinion.

<span id="viii.vi-p8"></span> “The Hebrew verb \[for *pierced*\]
indicates the acute pain felt from a sharp weapon. (See Parkhurst, on
<span id="viii.vi-p8.1"></span>שנן, iv.) Common experience shows that
the workings of the mind, particularly the passions of joy, grief, and
fear, have a very remarkable effect on the reins or kidneys.” — *Mant*

<span id="viii.vi-p13"></span> “Notwithstanding these foolish thoughts,
I am under the care of thy good providence.” — *Patrick*.

id="viii.vii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p3"></span> Calvin here gives the literal rendering
of the original Hebrew. The question appears elliptical; and
accordingly, in the French version he has introduced the supplement,
“<span id="viii.vii-p3.1"></span>si non toy?” “but thee?” — “Who is
there to me in heaven but thee?”

<span id="fn_206"></span>[207](cc10007.htm#fr_206.md) <span
id="viii.vii-p3.2"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p4"></span> “<span id="viii.vii-p4.1"></span>C’est,
outre toy.” — *Fr*. *marg*. “That is, beyond or besides thee.”

<span id="fn_207"></span>[208](cc10007.htm#fr_207.md) <span
id="viii.vii-p4.2"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p5"></span> “<span
id="viii.vii-p5.1"></span>Ascavoir, en te delaissant.” — *Fr*. *marg*.
“Namely, in forsaking thee.”

id="viii.vii-p5.2"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p6"></span> The Septuagint here adds, <span
id="viii.vii-p6.1"></span>ἐυ ταῖς πύλαις της θυγατρὸς Σιών; “in the
gates of the daughter of Zion.” The Vulgate, Arabic, and Æthiopic
versions have the same addition. This seems to make a better conclusion;
but these words are not in our present copies of the Hebrew Bible, nor
are they supported by any of the MSS. yet collated.

id="viii.vii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p14"></span> “*Go* *a whoring*, *etc*.; *i*.*e*.,
forsake God for false gods, which is spiritual adultery.” — *Sutcliffe*.
When God is said *to have destroyed* such as do this, some think there
is an allusion to that part of the Mosaic law which doomed idolaters to
be punished with death, as guilty of high treason against Jehovah the
King of Israel.
