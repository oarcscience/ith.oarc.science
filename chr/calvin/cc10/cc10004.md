*Calvin's Commentaries, Vol. 10: Psalms, Part III*, tr. by John King,

<span id="v-p1"></span>PSALM 70

<span id="v-p2"></span>This psalm is merely a part of the fortieth, and
the inscription, *To* *call to remembrance,* is perhaps designed to
indicate this; David having taken these five verses out of that other
psalm, and accommodated them for being used on some particular occasion.
I shall only here repeat the words of the text; and would refer the
reader for the interpretation to the proper place.

<span id="v-p3"></span>To the chief musician of David, to call to
remembrance.

<span id="v.i-p1"></span><span id="v.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
70:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa070.htm#001)<span id="v.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p2"></span>**1.** O God! make haste to deliver me: O
Jehovah! hasten to my help. **2.** Let those who seek my life be ashamed
and confounded; let those who desire my hurt be turned backward, and put
to confusion **3.** Let those who say to me, Aha! aha! perish as a
reward of their shame. **4.** Let all those who seek thee rejoice and
exult in thee: let those who love thy salvation say, Let God be
magnified for evermore! **5.** As for me, I am poor and needy: O God!
hasten to me: thou art my help and my deliverer: O Jehovah! make no
delay.
