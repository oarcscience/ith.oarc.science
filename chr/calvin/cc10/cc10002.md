<span id="iii-p1"></span>PSALM 68

<span id="iii-p2"></span>In this psalm it was David’s design to
celebrate the victories which, through the blessing of God, he had
gained over his enemies;  <span id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) but, in the
opening verses, he commends the power and goodness of God generally, as
seen in the government of the world at large. From this he passes to the
consideration of what God had done in redeeming his chosen people, and
of the continued proofs of fatherly care which he had manifested to the
posterity of Abraham. He then proceeds to the subject which he had more
particularly in view, prosecuting it at length, and in terms of the most
exalted description; praising the signal display of Divine power which
he, and the whole nation with him, had experienced. Now that he had been
made king, he infers that the Church was brought to a settled condition,
and that God, who seemed to have departed, would now at length erect his
throne, as it were, in the midst of it, and reign. In this it would
evidently appear, that he designed, typically, to represent the glory of
God afterwards to be manifested in Christ.

<span id="iii.i"></span>

<span id="iii.i-p1"></span><span id="iii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
68:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.i-p2"></span>**1**. God shall arise: his enemies shall be
scattered; and they who hate him shall flee before him. **2**. As smoke
is driven away, thou shalt drive them away; as wax melteth before the
fire, the wicked shall perish from the presence of God. **3**. But the
righteous shall be glad; they shall rejoice before God, and leap for
exultation. **4**. Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: exalt him
that rideth upon the clouds in Jah  <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md)
his name, \[or, in his name Jah,\] and rejoice before him. **5**. A
father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in the
habitation of his holiness. **6**. God who setteth the solitary in
families, who bringeth, out those who are bound with chains;  <span
id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) but the rebellious shall dwell in a dry
land.

<span id="iii.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="iii.i-p6"></span><span id="iii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.i-p7"></span>**1.** *God shall arise: his enemies shall be
scattered* In this verse the Psalmist intimates, as it were by way of
preface, the subject which he proposed to treat in the psalm, and which
related to the truth that God, however long he may seem to connive at
the audacity and cruelty of the enemies of his Church, will eventually
arise to avenge it, and will prove himself able to protect it by the
mere forth-putting of his hand. I agree with other interpreters in
thinking that the sentiment is borrowed from Moses, (<span
id="iii.i-p7.1"></span>[Nu 10:35](../../../bib/kjv/num010.htm#035.md)<span
id="iii.i-p7.1"></span>)  <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) There can be
little doubt that in dictating the form of prayer there referred to, he
had an eye to the instruction and comfort of all succeeding ages, and
would teach the Lord’s people confidently to rely for safety upon the
ark of the covenant, which was the visible symbol of the Divine
presence. We may notice this difference, however, that Moses addressed
the words to God as a prayer, while David rather expresses his
satisfaction and delight in what he saw daily fulfilling before his own
eyes. Some indeed read, *Let God arise;* but they appear to misapprehend
the scope of the Psalmist. He means to say that observation attested the
truth which Moses had declared of God’s needing only to rise up that all
his enemies might be scattered before his irresistible power. Yet I see
no objections to the other reading, provided the idea now mentioned be
retained, and the words be considered as intimating that God needs no
array of preparation in overthrowing his enemies, and can dissipate them
with a breath. We are left to infer, that when his enemies at any time
obtain an ascendancy, it is owing to an exercise of Divine forbearance,
and that rage as they may, it is only with his permission; the time
being not yet come for his rising. There is much comfort to be derived
from the circumstance, that those who persecute the Church are here
spoken of as *God’s enemies.* When he undertakes our defense, he looks
upon the injuries done to us as dishonors cast upon his Divine Majesty.
The Psalmist adds a striking figure to illustrate how easily God can
overthrow the machinations of our enemies, comparing them to *smoke
which vanishes when blown upon by the wind,* or *wax which melts before
the fire*  <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) We consider it utterly
incredible that such a formidable array of opposition should be made to
disappear in a moment. But the Spirit takes this method of chiding the
fearfulness of our carnal minds, and teaching us that there is no such
strength in our enemies as we suppose, — that we allow the smoke of them
to blind our eyes, and the solid mass of resistance which they present
to deceive us into a forgetfulness of the truth, that the mountains
themselves flow down at the presence of the Lord.  <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md)

<span id="iii.i-p11"></span><span id="iii.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.i-p12"></span>**3** *But the righteous shall be glad* It
is here intimated by David, that when God shows himself formidable to
the wicked, this is with the design of securing the deliverance of his
Church. He would seem indirectly to contrast the joy of which he now
speaks with the depression and grief felt by well affected men under the
reign of Saul — suggesting, that God succeeds a season of temporary
trouble with returns of comfort, to prevent his people from being
overwhelmed by despondency. He leaves us also to infer, that one reason
of that joy which they experience is derived from knowing that God is
propitious to them, and interests himself in their safety. The Hebrew
words, <span id="iii.i-p12.1"></span>מפני, *mipne,* and <span
id="iii.i-p12.2"></span>לפני, *liphne,* admit of the same meaning; but I
think that the Psalmist intended to note a distinction. The wicked flee
from the presence of God, as what inspires them with terror; the
righteous again rejoice in it, because nothing delights them more than
to think that God is near them. When commenting upon the passage, <span
id="iii.i-p12.3"></span>[Ps 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.i-p12.3"></span>, we saw why the Divine presence terrifies some
and comforts others; for “with the pure he will show himself pure, and
with the froward he will show himself froward.” One expression is heaped
by the Psalmist upon another, to show how great the joy of the Lord’s
people is, and how entirely it possesses and occupies their affections.

<span id="iii.i-p13"></span><span id="iii.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.i-p14"></span>**4** *Sing unto God, sing praises to his
name: exalt him*  <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) *that rideth,
etc.* He now proceeds to call upon the Lord’s people to praise God. And
he begins by pointing out the grounds in general, as I have already
hinted, which they have for this exercise, because he comprehends the
whole world under his power and government, adding, that he condescends
to take the poorest and the most wretched of our family under his
protection. His infinite power is commended, when it is said that he
*rides upon the clouds,* or the heavens,  <span
id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) for this proves that he sits superior
over all things. The Holy Spirit may signify by the expression, that we
should exclude from our minds every thing gross and earthly in the
conceptions we form of him; but he would, doubtless, impress us chiefly
with an idea of his great power, to produce in us a due reverence, and
make us feel how far short all our praises must come of his glory. We
would attempt in vain to comprehend heaven and earth; but his glory is
greater than both. As to the expression which follows, *in Jah, his
name,* there has been some difference of opinion. The Hebrew preposition
<span id="iii.i-p16.9"></span>ב, *beth,* may here, as sometimes it is,
be a mere expletive, and we may read, *Jah is his name*  <span
id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) Others read, *in Jah is his name;*  <span
id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) and I have no objection to this, though I
prefer the translation which I have adopted. It is of less consequence
how we construe the words, as the meaning of the Psalmist is obvious.
The whole world was at that time filled with the vain idols of
superstition, and he would assert the claim of God, and set them aside
when he brought forward the God of Israel. But it is not enough that the
Lord’s people should bow before him with suppliant spirits. Even the
wicked, while they fear and tremble before him, are forced to yield him
reverence. David would have them draw near to him with cheerfulness and
alacrity; and, accordingly, proceeds to insist upon his transcendent
goodness shown in condescending to the *orphans* and *widows.* The
incomprehensible glory of God does not induce him to remove himself to a
distance from us, or prevent him from stooping to us in our lowest
depths of wretchedness. There can be no doubt that orphans and widows
are named to indicate in general all such as the world are disposed to
overlook as unworthy of their regard. Generally we distribute our
attentions where we expect some return. We give the preference to rank
and splendor, and despise or neglect the poor. When it is said, *God is
in the habitation of his holiness,* this may refer either to heaven or
to the temple, for either sense will suit the connection. God does not
dwell in heaven to indulge his own ease, but heaven is, as it were, his
throne, from which he judges the world. On the other hand, the fact of
his having chosen to take up his residence with men, and inviting them
familiarly to himself there, is one well fitted to encourage the poor,
who are cheered to think that he is not far off from them. In the next
verse, other instances of the Divine goodness are mentioned — that he
gives the bereaved and solitary a numerous offspring, and releases the
bonds of the captive. In the last clause of the verse, he denounces the
judgment of God against those who impiously despise him, and this that
he might show the Lord’s people the folly of envying their lot as well
as strike terror into their minds. The sense of the words is, That we
ought to comfort ourselves under the worst afflictions, by reflecting
that we are in God’s hand, who can mitigate all our griefs and remove
all our burdens. The wicked, on the other hand, may congratulate
themselves for a time upon their prosperity, but eventually it will fare
ill with them. By *dwelling in a dry land,* is meant being banished, as
it were, to a wilderness, and deprived of the benefits of that fatherly
kindness which they had so criminally abused.

<span id="iii.ii"></span>

<span id="iii.ii-p1"></span><span id="iii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
68:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#007.md)<span id="iii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii-p2"></span>**7**. O God! when thou wentest forth before
thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah: **8**.
The earth was moved, the heavens also dropped at the presence of this
God: Sinai at the presence of God, the God of Israel.  <span
id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md) **9**. Thou, O God! shalt make a liberal
 <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) rain to fall upon thine
inheritance, and thou refreshest it when it is weary. **10**. Thy
congregation  <span id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) shall dwell therein;
thou, O God! wilt prepare in thy goodness for the poor.

<span id="iii.ii-p8"></span> 

<span id="iii.ii-p9"></span><span id="iii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii-p10"></span>**7** *O God! when thou wentest forth
before thy people, etc.* The Psalmist now proceeds to show that the
Divine goodness is principally displayed in the Church, which God has
selected as the great theater where his fatherly care may be manifested.
What follows is evidently added with the view of leading the posterity
of Abraham, as the Lord’s chosen people, to apply the observations which
had been just made to themselves. The deliverance from Egypt having been
the chief and lasting pledge of the Divine favor, which practically
ratified their adoption under the patriarch, he briefly adverts to that
event. He would intimate that in that remarkable exodus, proof had been
given to all succeeding ages of the love which God entertained for his
Church. Why were so many miracles wrought? why were heaven and earth put
into commotion? why were the mountains made to tremble? but that all
might recognize the power of God as allied with the deliverance of his
people. He represents God as having been their leader in conducting them
forth. And this not merely in reference to their passage of the Red Sea,
but their journeys so long as they wandered in the wilderness. When he
speaks of the *earth being moved,* he would not seem to allude entirely
to what occurred upon the promulgation of the law, but to the fact that,
throughout all their progress, the course of nature was repeatedly
altered, as if the very elements had trembled at the presence of the
Lord. It was upon Mount Sinai, however, that God issued the chief
displays of his awful power; it was there that thunders were heard in
heaven, and the air was filled with lightnings; and, accordingly, it is
mentioned here by name as having presented the most glorious spectacle
of the Divine majesty which was ever beheld. Some read, This *Sinai,*
etc., connecting the pronoun <span id="iii.ii-p10.1"></span>זה, *zeh,*
with the mountain here named; but it is much more emphatical to join it
with the preceding clause, and to read, *the heavens dropped at the
presence of This God;* David meaning to commend the excellency of the
God of Israel. The expression is one frequently used by the prophets to
denote that the God worshipped by the posterity of Abraham was the true
God, and the religion delivered in his law no delusion, as in <span
id="iii.ii-p10.2"></span>[Isa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009.md)<span id="iii.ii-p10.2"></span>,
“This, this is our God, and he will save us.” To establish the Lord’s
people in their faith, David leads them, as it were, into the very
presence of God; indicates that they were left to no such vague
uncertainties as the heathen; and indirectly censures the folly of the
world in forsaking the knowledge of the true God, and fashioning
imaginary deities of its own, of wood and stone, of gold and silver.

<span id="iii.ii-p11"></span><span id="iii.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii-p12"></span>**9.** *Thou, O God! shalt make a liberal
rain to fall*  <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) *upon thine
inheritance* Mention is made here of the continued course of favor which
had been extended to the people from the time when they first entered
the promised land. It is called *the inheritance of God,* as having been
assigned over to his own children. Others understand by the inheritance
spoken of in the verse, *the Church,* but this is not correct, for it is
afterwards stated as being the place where the Church dwelt. The title
is appropriately given to the land of Canaan, which God made over to
them by right of inheritance. David takes notice of the fact, that, from
the first settlement of the seed of Abraham in it, God had never ceased
to make the kindest fatherly provision for them, sending his rain in due
season to prepare their food. The words translated a *liberal rain,*
read literally in the Hebrew *a rain of freenesses,* and I agree with
interpreters in thinking that he alludes to the blessing as having come
in the exercise of free favor,  <span id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) and
to God, as having of his own unprompted goodness provided for all the
wants of his people. Some read *a desirable rain;* others, *a rain
flowing without violence,* or *gentle;* but neither of these renderings
seems eligible. Others read *a copious* or *plentiful rain;* but I have
already stated what appears to me to be the preferable sense. It was a
proof, then, of his Divine liberality, that God watered the land
seasonably with showers. There is clearly a reference to the site of
Judea, which owed its fertility to dews and the rains of heaven. In
allusion to the same circumstance, he speaks of *its being refreshed
when weary.* The reason is assigned — because it had been given to his
chosen people to dwell in. On no other account was it blessed, than as
being the habitation of God’s Church and people. The more to impress
upon the minds of the Jews their obligations to Divine goodness, he
represents them as *pensioners* depending upon God for their daily food.
He fed them upon the finest of the wheat, giving them wine, and honey,
and oil in abundance — still he proportioned the communication of his
kindness so as to keep them always dependent in expectation upon
himself. Some, instead of reading, *Thou wilt prepare with thy goodness,
etc.,* render it, *Thou wilt prepare with rich food;* but, without
absolutely objecting to this translation, I rather think that he adverts
to the circumstance of God’s being led to provide for his people
entirely by his own good pleasure.

<span id="iii.iii"></span>

<span id="iii.iii-p1"></span><span id="iii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
68:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii-p2"></span>**11**. The  <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) Lord shall give the word to the women who
announce the great army.  <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) **12**.
Kings of armies shall flee — shall flee; and she that tarries at home
shall divide the spoil. **13**. Though you should lie among the pots,
yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and which
behind is of the paleness of gold.  <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md)
**14**. When the Almighty scattered kings in it, thou shalt make it
white  <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) in Salmon.

<span id="iii.iii-p7"></span> 

<span id="iii.iii-p8"></span><span id="iii.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii-p9"></span>**11.** *The Lord shall give the word,
etc.* David now adverts to the victories by which God had signally
displayed his power in behalf of his people. He had himself been the
instrument of restoring peace to the country, by putting down its foes,
and he had extended the boundaries of the kingdom; but he ascribes the
praise of all that had been done in stratagems and counsels of war to
God. In representing God as issuing orders for the song of triumph, he
intimates, figuratively, that it is he who determines the successful
issue of battles. Notice is taken of the *women who announce the army,*
for it was the custom anciently for women to sing the song of triumph,
as Miriam, the sister of Moses, with her companions, sounded the praises
of God upon the timbrel, and the women celebrated David’s victory upon
the harp, when he slew Goliath, and routed the Philistines, (<span
id="iii.iii-p9.1"></span>[Ex
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md)<span id="iii.iii-p9.1"></span>;
<span id="iii.iii-p9.2"></span>[Jud
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#034.md)<span id="iii.iii-p9.2"></span>;
<span id="iii.iii-p9.3"></span>[1Sa
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#006)<span id="iii.iii-p9.3"></span>..md)
In making this reference to a song of praise, the Psalmist, as I have
already said, intended to impress the truth upon the people, that the
victories gained were entirely owing to God; though, at the same time,
he tacitly reminds them of its being their duty to proclaim his benefits
with due gratitude.

<span id="iii.iii-p10"></span>From the verse which succeeds, we are
taught that the mightiest preparations which the enemies of the Church
may make for its destruction shall be overthrown. We may consider the
words as spoken in the person of the Psalmist himself, or as forming the
song of the women mentioned above. It was a circumstance illustrative of
the Divine favor, that the most formidable kings, before whom the Jews
could never have stood in their own strength, had been put to flight.
That princes, who could easily have overrun the world with their forces,
should have not only departed without obtaining their purpose, but been
forced to fly to a distance, could be accounted for on no other
supposition than God’s having stood forward signally as their defender.
In the Hebrew the verb is repeated, *they shall flee, they shall flee,*
signifying that the attacks of the enemy had been repelled by Divine
assistance once and again. The greatness of the spoil taken is intimated
by the circumstance stated, that a share of it would come even to the
women who remained at home. While the soldiers would return from battle
clothed with the spoils, such would be the quantity of booty taken, that
the females, who took no part in war, would partake of it.

<span id="iii.iii-p11"></span><span id="iii.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii-p12"></span>**13.** *Though ye should lie among the
pots*  <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) Having spoken of God as
fighting the battles of his people, he adds, by way of qualification,
that they may lie for a time under darkness, though eventually God will
appear for their deliverance; There can be little doubt that he hints at
the state of wretchedness and distress to which the nation had been
reduced under the government of Saul, for the interposition was the more
remarkable, considering the misery from which it had emerged. The words,
however, convey a further instruction than this. They teach us the
general truth, that believers are, by the hidden and mysterious power of
God, preserved unhurt in the midst of their afflictions, or suddenly
recovered so as to exhibit no marks of them. The language admits of
being interpreted to mean either that they shine even when lying under
filth and darkness, or that, when freed from their troubles, they shake
off any defilement which they may have contracted. Let either sense be
adopted, and it remains true that the believer is never consumed or
overwhelmed by his afflictions, but comes out safe. An elegant figure is
drawn from the dove, which, though it lie amongst the pots, retains the
beauty which naturally belongs to it, and contracts no defilement on its
wings. From this we learn that the Church does not always present a fair
or peaceable aspect, but rather emerges occasionally from the darkness
that envelops it, and recovers its beauty as perfectly as if it had
never been subjected to calamity.

<span id="iii.iii-p21"></span><span id="iii.iii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii-p22"></span>**14.** *When the Almighty scattered kings
in it* We might read *extended,* or *divided kings, etc.,* and then the
allusion would be to his leading them in triumph. But the other reading
is preferable, and corresponds better with what was said above of their
being put to flight. There is more difficulty in the second part of the
verse, some reading, *it was white in Salmon;* that is, the Church of
God presented a fair and beautiful appearance. Or the verb may be viewed
as in the second person — *Thou, O God! Didst make it fair and white as
mount Salmon*  <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) *with snows* The
reader may adopt either construction, for the meaning is the same. It is
evident that David insists still upon the figure of the whiteness of
silver, which he had previously introduced. The country had, as it were,
been blackened or sullied by the hostile confusions into which it was
thrown, and he says that it had now recovered its fair appearance, and
resembled Salmon, which is well known to have been ordinarily covered
with snows.  <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) Others think that
Salmon is not the name of a place, but an appellative, meaning *a dark
shade.*  <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) I would retain the
commonly received reading. At the same time, I think that there may have
been an allusion to the etymology. It comes from the word <span
id="iii.iii-p27.1"></span>צלם*, tselem,* signifying *a shade,* and mount
Salmon had been so called on account of its blackness.  <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) This makes the comparison more striking;
for it intimates, that as the snows whitened this black mountain, so the
country had resumed its former beauty, and put on an aspect of joy, when
God dispelled the darkness which had lain upon it during the oppression
of enemies.  <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md)

<span id="iii.iv"></span>

<span id="iii.iv-p1"></span><span id="iii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm

<span id="iii.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.iv-p5"></span><span id="iii.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv-p6"></span>**15.** *The hill of God, the hill of
Bashan* Here he adverts to the spring and source of all the kindness
which God had shown, this being the circumstance that he had chosen
mount Zion as the place of his palace and temple, whence all blessings
should go out to the nation. A Divine declaration to that effect had
been made to David, and this pre-eminence and dignity conferred upon
mount Zion is very properly adduced as a proof of his being king,
lawfully and by Divine appointment; for there was an inseparable
connection between God’s dwelling upon that mountain, and David’s
sitting upon the throne to govern the people. The words of the verse
admit of two senses. We may suppose that the mountain of God is compared
to mount Bashan as being like it, or we may understand that it is
opposed to it. The first is the sense adopted almost by all
interpreters, that while Bashan was famed for its fertility, Zion
excelled it. It is of little importance which we prefer; but perhaps the
distinction would be brought out as well were we to construe the words
*the hill of God* by themselves, and consider that Bashan with its
boasted height is afterwards ordered to yield precedence, as if David
would say, that there was but one mountain which God had consecrated to
himself by an irrevocable decree, and that though Bashan was renowned
for height and fertility, it must rank with other mountains, which might
in vain exalt themselves to an equality with Zion, honored as the chosen
residence of God. If we read the verse differently, and consider it as
applying to mount Zion throughout, then the Psalmist extols it as high
and illustrious, and this because there emanated from it the Divine
favor, which distinguished the Jews from every other nation.

<span id="iii.iv-p7"></span><span id="iii.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv-p8"></span>**16.** *Why leap ye,*  <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) *ye high hills?* In this verse there is
no obscurity or ambiguity. David having said that there was only one
mountain in all the world which God had chosen, calls upon the highest
hills to yield it the pre-eminency. As he repeats in the plural number
what had been said immediately before of Bashan, this leads me to think
that he intended first to oppose that mountain, and then all other high
mountains generally, to Zion.  <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md)
Mountains are here to be understood figuratively, and the great truth
conveyed is, that the kingdom of Christ, which God had begun to shadow
forth in the person of David, far excels all that is reckoned glorious
by the world. The reproof which the Psalmist administers, in order to
humble the proud boasting of the world, is justified by that contempt
which we know that carnal and ungodly persons entertain of Christ’s
kingdom, devoted as they are to their own pleasures or wealth, and
unable to appreciate spiritual blessings. The lesson will be felt to be
the more useful and necessary, if we consider that this vain pride of
man rises to an additional height, when the slightest occasion is
afforded for its exercise. When we see those indulging it who have no
grounds to do so, we need not wonder at the arrogance of such as are
possessed of wealth and influence. But the Lord’s people may afford to
leave them to their self-complacency, resting satisfied with the
privilege of knowing that God has chosen to take up his habitation in
the midst of them. They have no reason to repine at their lot so long as
they have union with God, the only and the sufficient source of their
happiness.

<span id="iii.iv-p15"></span>**17.** *The chariots of God are twenty
thousand thousands of angels.*  <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) For
the most part, we are apt to undervalue the Divine presence, and
therefore David presents us with a description fitted to exalt our
thoughts of it. Owing to our unbelieving hearts, the least danger which
occurs in the world weighs more with us than the power of God. We
tremble under the slightest trials; for we forget or cherish low views
of his omnipotence. To preserve us from this error, David directs us to
the countless myriads of angels which are at his command, — a
circumstance, the consideration of which may well enable us to defy the
evils which beset us. *Twenty thousand* are spoken of; but it is a
number designed to intimate to us that the armies of the living God,
which he commissions for our help, are innumerable; and surely this
should comfort us under the deadliest afflictions of this life. In
adding that *the Lord is among them,* the Psalmist is still to be
considered as designing to give us an exalted view of what is included
in God’s presence; for the words suggest that he can no more divest
himself of his existence than not have this power whereby angels are
subordinated to his will. Another idea suggested is, that one God is
better than a universe of angels. The great distance to which we are apt
to conceive God as removed from us is one circumstance which tries our
faith, and in order to obviate this, the Psalmist reminds us of *Sinai,*
where there was a display of his majesty. The inference was conclusive
that he still abode *in the sanctuary.* For why did God appear upon that
occasion in such a glorious manner? Evidently to show that his covenant
formed a sacred bond of union between him and the posterity of Abraham.
Hence the words of Moses —

<span id="iii.iv-p19"></span>“Say not in thine heart, Who shall go up
into heaven? or who shall descend into the deep? or who shall go over
the sea? For the word is nigh unto thee,” etc. (<span
id="iii.iv-p19.1"></span>[De
30:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#012)<span id="iii.iv-p19.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iii.iv-p20"></span>Sinai accordingly is mentioned by David, to
teach us that if we would fortify our minds with a firm faith in the
Divine presence, we must derive it from the Law and the Prophets.

<span id="iii.v"></span>

<span id="iii.v-p8"></span><span id="iii.v-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v-p9"></span>**18.** *Thou hast ascended on high, thou
hast led captivity captive* There can be little doubt that these words
are intended to magnify the proofs of Divine favor granted upon the
elevation of David to the throne, by contrasting the state of matters
with that under Saul. The *ascending on high* implies the being
previously low, and intimates, that under the melancholy confusions
which had prevailed in the kingdom, there was no longer the same
conspicuous display of the Divine glory as formerly. The government of
Saul, which, from the first, had originated in a way that was
condemnable, was doomed to fall under the displeasure of God, while his
favor, on the other hand, was to be restored under David; and the
undeniable appearances of this left no room for doubt that one who began
his reign under such auspices was the object of the Divine choice.
David, although he had acquitted himself with courage in the battles
which were fought, ascribes all the glory of them to God, saying, that
it was he who had taken captive the enemy, and forced them to pay
tribute, and reduced the more fierce and rebellious to subjection. By
the term <span id="iii.v-p9.1"></span>סוררים *sorerim, rebellious,*
contumacious, or revolters, he would evidently seem to mean a distinct
class of persons from the other enemies, whom he mentions as having been
taken captive; and it intimates, that while those who did not venture to
resist, and who surrendered, had been brought under the yoke, the more
proud and unyielding had been forced into submission. The end designed
by this is stated in the words which follow, *that God might dwell in
the midst of his people;* and that he might demonstrate himself to be an
all-sufficient protector to those who put their trust in him.

<span id="iii.v-p10"></span>As the passage which we have now been
considering is applied by Paul in a more spiritual sense to Christ,
(<span id="iii.v-p10.1"></span>[Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008)<span id="iii.v-p10.1"></span>,.md) it
may be necessary to show how this agrees with the meaning and scope of
the Psalmist. It may be laid down as an incontrovertible truth, that
David, in reigning over God’s ancient people, shadowed forth the
beginning of Christ’s eternal kingdom. This must appear evident to every
one who remembers the promise made to him of a never-failing succession,
and which received its verification in the person of Christ. As God
illustrated his power in David, by exalting him with the view of
delivering his people, so has he magnified his name in his only begotten
Son. But let us consider more particularly how the parallel holds.
Christ, before he was exalted, emptied himself of his glory, having not
merely assumed the form of a servant, but humbled himself to the death
of the cross. To show how exactly the figure was fulfilled, Paul
notices, that what David had foretold was accomplished in the person of
Christ, by his being cast down to the lowest parts of the earth in the
reproach and ignominy to which he was subjected, before he ascended to
the right hand of his Father, (<span id="iii.v-p10.2"></span>[Ps
22:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#007)<span id="iii.v-p10.2"></span>..md)
That in thinking upon the ascension, we might not confine our views to
the body of Christ, our attention is called to the result and fruit of
it, in his subjecting heaven and earth to his government. Those who were
formerly his inveterate enemies he compelled to submission and made
tributary — this being the effect of the word of the Gospel, to lead men
to renounce their pride and their obstinacy, to bring down every high
thought which exalteth itself, and reduce the senses and the affections
of men to obedience unto Christ. As to the devils and reprobate men who
are instigated to rebellion and revolt by obstinate malice, he holds
them bound by a secret control, and prevents them from executing
intended destruction. So far the parallel is complete. Nor when Paul
speaks of Christ having *given gifts to men,* is there any real
inconsistency with what is here stated, although he has altered the
words, having followed the Greek version in accommodation to the
unlearned reader.  <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) It was not
himself that God enriched with the spoils of the enemy, but his people;
and neither did Christ seek or need to seek his own advancement, but
made his enemies tributary, that he might adorn his Church with the
spoil. From the close union subsisting between the head and members, to
say that God manifest in the flesh received gifts from the captives, is
one and the same thing with saying that he distributed them to his
Church. What is said in the close of the verse is no less applicable to
Christ — that he obtained his victories that as God he might dwell among
us. Although he departed, it was not that he might remove to a distance
from us, but, as Paul says, “that he might fill all things,” (<span
id="iii.v-p11.8"></span>[Eph 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.v-p11.8"></span>.) By his ascension to heaven, the glory of his
divinity has been only more illustriously displayed, and though no
longer present with us in the flesh, our souls receive spiritual
nourishment from his body and blood, and we find, notwithstanding
distance of place, that his flesh is meat indeed, and his blood drink
indeed.

<span id="iii.v-p12"></span><span id="iii.v-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v-p13"></span>**19.** *Blessed be the Lord, etc.* David
would have us to understand, that in recounting the more particular
deliverances which God had wrought, he did not mean to draw our minds
away from the fact, that the Church is constantly and at all times
indebted for its safety to the Divine care and protection. He adds,
*Blessed be God daily* And he intimates, that deliverances might be
expected from him with great abundance of every blessing. Some read, *he
will load,* others, *he will carry;*  <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) but it is of little importance which
reading we adopt. He points at the fact, that God extends continued
proofs of his kindness to his people, and is unwearied in renewing the
instances of it. I read this *Lord* in the second part of the verse, for
the letter <span id="iii.v-p14.3"></span>ה, *he*, prefixed in the
Hebrew, has often the force of a demonstrative pronoun; and he would
point out, as it were with the finger, that God in whom their confidence
ought to be placed. So in the next verse, which may be read, this *our
God is the God of salvation* What is here said coincides with the scope
of what immediately precedes, and is meant to convey the truth that God
protects his Church and people constantly. In saying *this God,* he
administers a check to the tendency in men to have their minds diverted
from the one living and true God. The salvation of God is set before the
view of all men without exception, but is very properly represented here
as something peculiar to the elect, that they may recognize themselves
as continually indebted to his preserving care, unlike the wicked, who
pervert that which might have proved life into destruction, through
their unthankfulness. The Hebrew word in the 20th verse is *salvations,*
in the plural number, to convince us that when death may threaten us in
ever so many various forms, God can easily devise the necessary means of
preservation, and that we should trust to experience the same mercy
again which has been extended to us once. The latter clause of the verse
bears the same meaning, where it is said, that to the Lord *belong the
issues of death* Some read, the *issues unto death,*  <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) supposing that the reference is to the
ease with which God can avenge and destroy his enemies; but this appears
a constrained interpretation. The more natural meaning obviously is,
that God has very singular ways, unknown to us, of delivering his people
from destruction.  <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) He points at a
peculiarity in the manner of the Divine deliverances, that God does not
generally avert death from his people altogether, but allows them to
fall in some measure under its power, and afterwards unexpectedly
rescues them from it. This is a truth particularly worthy of our notice,
as teaching us to beware of judging by sense in the matter of Divine
deliverances. However deep we may have sunk in trouble, it becomes us to
trust the power of God, who claims it as his peculiar work to open up a
way where man can see none.

<span id="iii.v-p22"></span><span id="iii.v-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v-p23"></span>**21.** *Surely God shall wound, etc.* The
enemies of the Church are fierce and formidable, and it is impossible
that she can be preserved from their continued assaults, without a
vigorous protection being extended. To persuade us that she enjoys such
a defense, David represents God as armed with dreadful power for the
overthrow of the ungodly. The verse stands connected as to scope with
the preceding, and we might render the Hebrew particle <span
id="iii.v-p23.1"></span>אך, *ach,* by *wherefore,* or *on which
account;* but it seems better to consider it as expressing simple
affirmation. We are to notice the circumstance, that God counts all
those his enemies who unjustly persecute the righteous, and thus assures
us of his being always ready to interpose for our defense. The concern
he feels in our preservation is forcibly conveyed by the expressions
which follow, that *he will wound the head of his enemies, and the crown
of their hair;*  <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) intimating, that
he will inflict a deadly and incurable wound upon such as harass his
Church. This is still more strikingly brought out in what is added
immediately afterwards, when God is described as wading through
destruction.

<span id="iii.v-p25"></span><span id="iii.v-p25.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v-p26"></span>**22.** *The Lord said, I will bring back
from Bashan.* That the Israelites might not be led to take an
irreligious and self-glorious view of their victories; that they might
look to God as the author of them; and rest assured of his protection in
time to come, David sends them back to the first periods of their
history, and reminds them how their fathers had been originally brought
by the victorious hand of God out of the lowest depths of trouble. He
would have them argue that if God rescued his people at first from
giants, and from the depths of the Red Sea, it was not to be imagined
that he would desert them in similar dangers, but certain that he would
defend them upon every emergency which might occur. The prophets are in
the constant habit, as is well known, of illustrating the mercy of God
by reference to the history of Israel’s redemption, that the Lord’s
people, by looking back to their great original deliverance, might find
an argument for expecting interpositions of a future kind. To make the
deeper impression, God is introduced speaking himself. In what he says
he may be considered as asserting his Divine prerogative of raising the
dead to life again, for his people’s passage through the Red Sea, and
victory over warlike giants, was a species of resurrection.  <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) Some read, *I will cause the enemy to fly
from Bashan;*  <span id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) but this cannot be
received, and does not agree with the context, as it follows, *I will
bring back from the depths of the sea* In representing God as bedewed or
stained with blood, David does not ascribe to him anything like cruelty,
but designs to show the Lord’s people how dear and precious they are in
his sight, considering the zeal which he manifests in their defense. We
know that David himself was far from being a man of cruel disposition,
and that he rejoiced in the destruction of the wicked from the purest
and most upright motives, as affording a display of the Divine
judgments. That is here ascribed to God which may be asserted equally of
his Church or people, for the vengeance with which the wicked are
visited is inflicted by their hands. Some read the close of the verse,
*the tongue of thy dogs in thine enemies, even in him, i.e.,* the king
and chief of them all. This is not the meaning of the Psalmist, which
simply is, that the tongues of the dogs would be red with licking blood,
such would be the number of dead bodies scattered round.

<span id="iii.v-p29"></span><span id="iii.v-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v-p30"></span>**24.** *They have seen thy goings, O God!*
This verse may refer to processions of a warlike kind, or to such as are
made in times of peace by those who give thanks for victory. It is
customary for the people of God, on occasions of the latter description,
to go forth and present peace-offerings in the temple. This has led some
to understand by *the goings of God,*  <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) the crowds of his people when they
proceed to the temple. But I am disposed to think that God himself is
here represented as a king leading and marshalling forth his armies.
Accordingly, it is added, *in the sanctuary,* under which expression
there is an apt allusion to the visible symbol of the Divine presence.
The great reason why God undertakes the guardianship of his people, and
goes before them to repel the attacks of the enemy, is his having
promised that he will hear their prayers in the sanctuary. He is
therefore described as if he were seen coming out of his holy
habitation, that he might conduct his people to victory. David calls him
*his King,* to divert the attention of the people from himself, and lead
them to view a name which belonged to a frail mortal man such as he was,
in its higher application to the supreme Head of all. He speaks, it is
true, in the name of the people, but not to the exclusion of himself.

<span id="iii.vi-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi-p6"></span>**25.** *The singers went before* It is
evident that he does not now speak of an army in battle array, but of a
solemn assembly held for offering up thanksgivings to God for victory.
God had openly shown that he was their leader in war, and to him the
song of triumph is with propriety addressed. Mention is made of distinct
choirs employed in his service, and particularly of such as played upon
the timbrel; for, absurd as the practice may appear to us, it was then
customary for the women to play upon that instrument. By the fountain
 <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) from which they are called upon to
bless God, some understand *the heart,* as it is known that those
praises which proceed from the lips merely, and are hypocritical, meet
with the Divine reprobation. But I conceive the true meaning to be, that
all are summoned to praise the Lord who could deduce their origin from
the patriarch Jacob. Many might not sustain the character which answered
to their high vocation; but, as the whole race had been chosen of God,
the Psalmist very properly invites them to engage in this devotional
exercise. At the same time, I see nothing objectionable in the opinion,
if any persist in preferring it, that the term is here used to
distinguish the true saints of God from those who vainly boasted of
being the posterity of Abraham, while they had degenerated from his
spirit. Those only who walk in the footsteps of his faith are reckoned
to be his children. It has caused some surprise that, in a general
description of the sacred assemblies of the people, precedence should
have been given to the tribe of *Benjamin* According to certain
interpreters, this is owing to the position which it occupied, as being
next to David; and honor is put upon the tribes of *Zebulun* and
*Naphtali,*  <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) which, though they lay
at a great distance, were in a particular manner friendly and attached
to him. Others think that the whole nation is represented under the
tribes specified, which were at once the nearest and most distant.
 <span id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) These conjectures  <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) are probable enough, but the point is one
which may be left in uncertainty, as there may have been some other
reason, which it is impossible for us to discover. It has been suggested
that Benjamin is called *little* on account of the smallness of its
numbers, the tribe having been nearly exterminated for the crime of the
men of Gibeah, (<span id="iii.vi-p13.6"></span>[Jud
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#020)<span id="iii.vi-p13.6"></span>;.md)
but David would not probably have adverted to any reproach of this kind
in calling them to take so prominent a part in the praises of God.
 <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) The inspired writers, in speaking
of the tribes, often allude to the patriarchs from whom they
respectively took their origin; nor is it surprising that the posterity
of Benjamin, who was the youngest of Jacob’s children,  <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) should receive the designation here given
to them; and the truth is, that even antecedently to the heavy stroke
which befell them, they were not numerous. Interpreters, by general
consent, have considered that Benjamin is called *ruler,* as Saul, who
was first made king in Israel, belonged to this tribe; but I cannot
bring myself to think it probable that David would have made such an
unseasonable allusion to Saul’s memory, whose government is everywhere
represented in Scripture as pregnant with disaster, and which was to be
buried in that of his successor, whose reign is so prominently brought
forward in this psalm. The more likely conjecture is, that this title of
dignity is applied in order to put honor upon a tribe, which some might
despise for its smallness, and to intimate that the Benjamites, though
few in numbers, and not possessed of great influence, formed one head in
Israel as well as the rest.  <span id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) Others
may be disposed to think that there must have been some illustrious
individual in this and the two tribes mentioned along with it, or that
the whole tribe had signalised itself in a recent battle. Though
honorable mention is made of these tribes, yet the chief place in the
numbers assembled together at this time is assigned to the princes of
Judah. Some think that the copulative is understood, and read, *the
princes of Judah and their congregation* The Hebrew word which we
translate *congregation* is by others translated *stoning.*  <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) But it seems preferable to construe the
words as implying that this tribe presided over the assembly which
marched under its auspices in war. The power of summoning the people
together is thus asserted as belonging to Judah, and it is represented
as honored with the government and primacy of the kingdom.

<span id="iii.vii"></span>

<span id="iii.vii-p4"></span><span id="iii.vii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii-p5"></span>**28.** *Thy God hath commanded thy
strength* Men are always disposed to arrogate to themselves the glory of
what they may have done instead of tracing their success to God, and
David reminds the people once more that they had not triumphed by their
own strength, but by power communicated from above. If they had
acquitted themselves with energy on the field, he would have them
consider that it was God who inspired them with this valor, and would
guard them against the pride which overlooks and disparages the Divine
goodness. As a consideration which might farther tend to promote
humility in their minds, he adverts to the dependence in which they
stood of the future continuance of the same favor and protection; this
being the great cause of presumptuous confidence, that we do not feel
our own helplessness, and are not led under a sense of it to resort
humbly to God for the supply of our wants. Another lesson which the
passage teaches us is, that more is required than that God should visit
us at first with his preventing grace; that we stand constantly in need
of his assistance throughout our whole lives. If this be true in the
literal warfare, where our conflict is with flesh and blood, it must be
still more so in matters of the soul. It is impossible that we could
stand one moment in the contest with such enemies as Satan, sin, and the
world, did we not receive from God the grace which secures our
perseverance.

<span id="iii.vii-p6"></span>What is said of the temple in the following
verse is intended to carry out the same strain of sentiment which has
been already expressed. It gives the reason why God had exerted his
power in behalf of the Israelites rather than others; which was, that it
might be displayed as coming forth from the sanctuary and the ark of the
covenant. Hence the emphasis with which David calls him in a previous
part of the psalm — the God of Israel. It was not in vain that God had
erected his sanctuary, or promised his presence in connection with it;
and his power is here represented as issuing from the temple, to denote
that the only security for his favor was to be found in his gracious
covenant and promises. Some read, *From thy temple* in *Jerusalem* — a
frigid interpretation, and one which does not express the meaning of the
Psalmist. His prayer is to the effect that the Divine power might be
commanded from the sanctuary upon his chosen people, here denoted by a
common figure of speech by Jerusalem. It may be asked how he speaks of
the temple, when it had not been yet built. The word *temple* or palace
may have been used to express the tabernacle. This, at least, I think
more probable than that he should speak of the temple by anticipation,
as some suppose; and there can be no doubt that the ark had already been
placed in Zion. Having already traced all the honor of the recent
victories to God, he next proceeds to vindicate his claim to reap the
fruits of them, by asserting that the kings who had been subdued would
acknowledge God to have been their conqueror, as well as yield
themselves tributary to David and his successors, — a circumstance which
should lay the people of God under an additional obligation to present
him with their free-will offerings of praise.

<span id="iii.vii-p7"></span><span id="iii.vii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vii-p8"></span>**30.** *Destroy the company of spearmen*
Some read *rebuke,* but I approve of the distinction which has been
noticed by those who are most skilled in the Hebrew language, that while
the verb <span id="iii.vii-p8.1"></span>גער, *gear,* has this meaning
when the letter <span id="iii.vii-p8.2"></span>ב *beth,* is interposed,
it signifies without it *to destroy.* The word, <span
id="iii.vii-p8.3"></span>חית, *chayath,* which I have rendered
*company,* has been translated *beast,*  <span
id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) but no such sense can apply to it here.
David evidently prays in this passage that God would deliver his chosen
people by destroying their cruel and bloody enemies. In calling these
*the company of the reed* or *cane,*  <span
id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) he does not mean to say that they are
weak, but alludes to the kind of armor which they wore, and which were
lances or spears. The reed grows in some countries to a tree, or at
least has all the consistency of wood, and the people are in the habit
of making darts from it. In the East missile weapons are commonly used
in war. He compares them for their fierceness to *bulls,* so I have
rendered the word <span id="iii.vii-p10.2"></span>אבירים, *abbirim;* for
though it may be translated *strong* or *stout* persons — *the
congregation of the strong* — it occasionally bears the other meaning;
and as David adds, *calves of the people,*  <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) it would seem evident that he uses a
figure to represent the rage and fury of the enemy, and perhaps their
strength, which the Israelites were wholly unequal to combat except with
Divine assistance. It is not so easy to discover the meaning of the next
clause in the verse, *treading upon pieces of silver* The Hebrew verb
<span id="iii.vii-p11.1"></span>רפס, *raphas,* signifies *to tread,* or
literally, (for it, is here in the *hithpael* conjugations) *causing
themselves to tread;* and some consider that the allusion is to the
arrogance and vain-glorious boasting of the enemy. Others attach exactly
the opposite sense to the words, holding that they denote submission,
and that the enemy would bring pieces of silver in token of subjection.
 <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) But how could we suppose that
David would pray for the destruction of enemies who were already
subdued, and paying tribute in the character of suppliants? To this it
has been said in reply, that enemies may retain their animosity in all
its force within their own breasts, ready to vent itself in rebellion
upon the first opportunity, although when deprived of arms they cannot
display it openly, and that this is especially true of the enemies of
the Church, whose antipathies are virulent, ever breaking forth afresh
so soon as an occasion offers. But I see no necessity for doing violence
to the words of the Psalmist, and would take them in their plain
acceptation, as meaning that the enemy in their pride trampled upon
pieces of silver. The reference may be to attachments of silver upon
their sandals, as the Eastern nations were always proverbial for their
luxury.  <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) What immediately follows
by no means favors the sense we have formerly adverted to, *scatter the
people who delight in war,* where he hints that they sought groundless
occasions for quarrel and tumult, and gratuitously attacked such as were
disposed for peace. When we find David, after all the victories he had
gained, still commending himself and his people to the protection of
God, it should teach us to abandon the hope of ever seeing the Church
placed in a state of perfect tranquillity in this world, exposed, as it
is, to a succession of enemies raised up by the malice of Satan, and
designed by God for the trial and exercise of our patience. In comparing
their enemies to the beasts here mentioned, and taking notice that they
delighted in war, it was no doubt his intention to influence the minds
of the people of God to the contrary dispositions of clemency and mercy,
as being that frame of spirit in the exercise of which they might expect
to receive the Divine assistance. The more violently their enemies
raged, and the more lawless their attempts might prove, they had only
the more reason to expect the interposition of God, who humbles the
proud and the mighty ones of this world. Such being the character of
God, let us learn from this prayer of David to resort to him with
confidence when the objects at any time of unmerited persecution, and to
believe that he is able to deliver us at once from all our enemies.

<span id="iii.viii-p2"></span>**31**. Princes shall come out of Egypt;

<span id="iii.viii-p3"></span> 

<span id="iii.viii-p4"></span><span id="iii.viii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii-p5"></span>**31.** *Princes shall come out of Egypt.*
He resumes the strain of thanksgiving, and confirms what he had
previously asserted, that kings would come and pay tribute unto God. The
examples which he brings forward are those of the Egyptians and
Ethiopians. This sufficiently proves that the prediction must be
extended to Christ, by whom the Egyptians and Ethiopians were brought
under the sway of God. The word <span id="iii.viii-p5.1"></span>תריף,
*tarits,* translated, *shall soon stretch out,* might have been
rendered, *shall cause to run.*  <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md)
But it seemed necessary to soften the harshness of the figure. It is
doubtful whether the allusion be to the promptness with which they
should yield subjection, or whether he means that they would stretch out
their hands to entreat pardon, this being an attitude common to
suppliants. According to either interpretation, it is their submission
which is intended, and it is enough to know that David asserts that
Ethiopia and Egypt would come under the power of God, and not they only,
but the most distant parts of the world.

<span id="iii.viii-p7"></span><span id="iii.viii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii-p8"></span>In the next verse he goes farther than
before, and calls upon *the kingdoms of the earth to praise God,*
language which implies that those who had once been distinguished by
their hostility to him would be ranked amongst his willing worshippers.
There must be the knowledge of God, as I have remarked elsewhere, before
men can celebrate the praises of his name; and we have a proof of the
calling of the Gentiles, in the fact that Moses and the prophets invite
them to offer sacrifices of praise. That it might not seem a strange and
incredible thing to speak of the extension of the worship of God from
one land, within which it had been hitherto confined, to the whole
world, David insists upon God’s rightful dominion over all parts of the
earth. *He rideth upon the heaven of heavens;* that is, as we have
observed at the beginning of the psalm, he has supreme power over all
creatures, and governs the universe at his will. This truth is one
which, even in its general application, is well fitted to beget a
reverential consideration of the majesty of God; but we must not
overlook the more particular reason for which it is here introduced.
Mention having been made of the Gentiles, who lay as yet without the
pale of the Church, he proves them to be embraced in the government of
God by virtue of his sovereignty as Creator, and intimates that there
was nothing wonderful in the fact, that he who sits upon the heavens
should comprehend the whole inhabitants of the earth under his sway. By
the *heavens of ancient times,* it is meant to intimate that the whole
human family were under his power from the very beginning. We have a
signal proof of the glorious power of God in the fact, that,
notwithstanding the immensity of the fabric of the heavens, the rapidity
of their motion, and the conflicting revolutions which take place in
them, the most perfect subordination and harmony are preserved; and that
this fair and beautiful order has been uninterruptedly maintained for
ages. It is apparent then how the ancientness of the heavens may commend
to us the singular excellency of the handiwork of God. Having touched
upon the work of creation, he particularises *thunder,* for this is what
he intends by *a mighty voice*, as in <span
id="iii.viii-p8.1"></span>[Ps
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa029.htm#004.md)<span id="iii.viii-p8.1"></span>.
There are two constructions which we may put upon the words used, either
that by his voice of command he calls forth the thunders which shake
heaven and earth with the loudness of their sound, or that he sends
forth his mighty voice in the thunder. I have already shown, at some
length, in commenting upon the other passage just quoted, that there is
a propriety in God’s being represented as *thundering;* for the
phenomenon is one which, more than any other, impresses an awe upon the
spirits of men. And the words are introduced with the exclamation *lo!*
or *behold!* the better to arrest our wandering thoughts, or rather to
reprehend our security.

<span id="iii.viii-p9"></span><span id="iii.viii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii-p10"></span>**34.** *Give strength unto God over
Israel* The expression is in allusion to the sentence which went before,
and in which God was said to send forth a strong or mighty voice. Not
that, properly speaking, we can give anything to Him, but, disposed as
we are to withhold that honor which is his due, David subjoins to what
he had said of his thundering with a mighty voice, an injunction that we
should, on our part, be ready to sound forth his praises. To guard the
Gentile nations against those false ideas upon religion in which they
were accustomed to indulge, he brings them back to the doctrine of the
Law, in which God had specially revealed himself, and intimates that, if
they would not lose themselves in error, they must advance by necessary
steps from the creation and government of the world, to that doctrine in
which God had condescended to make a familiar revelation of himself to
men. So much is included when God is spoken of here as *the God of
Israel* But he does not satisfy himself with enjoining them to celebrate
the power of God with praises of the voice. He exhorts them to the
exercise of faith, for in reality we cannot better ascribe strength unto
God, than by reposing in his protection as all-sufficient. Thus, after
having said that *his strength is in the clouds;*  <span
id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) he adds, that *he is terrible out of his
holy places,* by which is meant, that he exerts a power in his temple
which is sufficient to confound his enemies. Some understand heaven and
earth to be the *holy places* intended, but this does not agree with the
context, for it is immediately added, that *the God of Israel* would
give strength unto his people. It is evident, therefore, that the
Psalmist speaks of God’s protection of his Church. The plural number is
used in speaking of the sanctuary, here as in other places, because the
tabernacle was divided into three parts. He points, in short, to the ark
of the covenant, as that which the believing people of God should
recognize as a symbol of confidence, remembering the promise, “I will
dwell in the midst of you,” and thus resting with security under the
wings of the Divine protection, and confidently calling upon his name.
Any right which Israel might have in distinction from others to trust in
the guardianship of God, rested entirely upon that covenant of free
grace by which they had been chosen to be God’s peculiar heritage. Let
it be remembered, however, that God continues to exert in behalf of his
Church still these terrible displays of his power of which the Psalmist
speaks.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[6](cc10002.htm#fr_5.md) <span id="iii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii-p3"></span> As to the time and occasion of the composition
of this psalm, the majority of interpreters refer it to the translation
of the ark from the house of Obed-Edom to Mount Zion, and with this
every part of it would, no doubt, harmonize. But other critics, as Drs
Geddes, Boothroyd, and Morrison, think (and Calvin’s opinion seems to be
the same) that it was penned after some great victory; probably after
David’s signal victory over the Ammonites and Syrians, when the ark was
brought back in triumph to Jerusalem, (<span id="iii-p3.1"></span>[1Ch
19:10-19](../../../bib/kjv/ch1019.htm#010)<span id="iii-p3.1"></span>..md)
That the ark accompanied the army in those ways we learn from the words
of Uriah to David, in <span id="iii-p3.2"></span>[2Sa
11:11](../../../bib/kjv/sa2011.htm#011.md)<span id="iii-p3.2"></span>,
compared with <span id="iii-p3.3"></span>[2Sa
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#031.md)<span id="iii-p3.3"></span>. As
every thing under that dispensation was typical or prophetical, it is
very natural to regard the triumphant manner in which the ark ascended
the holy mountain, as an emblem of the far more triumphant and glorious
ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ (of whom the ark, and the tabernacle,
and the temple itself, were all figures) to the highest heavens, after
he had overcome his own and his people’s enemies; and in this
application the 18th verse of this psalm is quoted by the Apostle Paul,
(<span id="iii-p3.4"></span>[Eph. 4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#009)<span id="iii-p3.4"></span>..md)

<span id="iii-p4"></span>This inspired composition, though highly
sublime and beautiful, is universally acknowledged by critics to be of
very difficult interpretation. Dr Adam Clarke pronounces it “the most
difficult psalm in the whole Psalter;” and, after quoting the words of
Simon de Muis, — who observes, that “it may not be improperly termed the
torture of critics, and the reproach of commentators,” — he says, “There
are customs here referred to, which I do not fully understand: there are
words whose meaning I cannot, to my own satisfaction, ascertain; and
allusions which are to me inexplicable. Yet of the composition itself I
have the highest opinion: — it is sublime beyond all comparison; — it is
constructed with an art truly admirable; — it possesses all the dignity
of the sacred language; — none but David could have composed it; and, at
this lapse of time, it would require no small influence of the Spirit
that was upon him to give its true interpretations.”

<span id="iii.i-p3"></span> “<span id="iii.i-p3.1"></span>C’est, Qui est
Jah, ou l’Eternel?“ — *Fr*. *marg*. “That is, Who is Jah, or Jehovah?”
Jah seems simply a contraction of the word Jehovah, the name which
expresses, as far as can be expressed by words, the essence,
self-existence, and eternity of the Supreme Being.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[8](cc10002.htm#fr_7.md) <span

<span id="iii.i-p4"></span> The original word <span
id="iii.i-p4.1"></span>בכושרות, *bakosharoth*, which Calvin renders,
*with chains*, is rendered by Dathe, <span id="iii.i-p4.2"></span>*ad
abundantiam*; and by Berlin, <span id="iii.i-p4.3"></span>*ad
opimitates*; and is explained by Simeon, in his Lexicon, as “<span
id="iii.i-p4.4"></span>loca omnibus affluentia proprie abundantiae.”
According to Gesenius, <span id="iii.i-p4.5"></span>כושרה denotes
“*happiness*, *abundance*, *prosperity*.” The LXX. render it <span
id="iii.i-p4.6"></span>ἐν ἀνδρέια, *in strength*, *i* *e*., bound
firmly. Fry reads, “Bringing forth prisoners into scenes of plenty.”

<span id="fn_8"></span>[9](cc10002.htm#fr_8.md) <span
id="iii.i-p7.2"></span>

<span id="iii.i-p8"></span> That passage contains the words which Moses
used when the ark began a procession. Whenever the tabernacle was moved,
and the Levites marched onward, bearing upon their shoulders the ark of
the covenant, and the whole host of Israel proceeded on their march,
“Moses said, Rise up, Lord,” etc. Martin observes, that “the God whom
these opening words of the psalm have in view is manifestly the same of
whom it is said in verse 18, that he ascended up on high, and led
captivity captive. Now he of whom that is said, being, according to the
interpretation of the Apostle Paul, (<span id="iii.i-p8.1"></span>[Eph
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#008)<span id="iii.i-p8.1"></span>,.md)
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, it clearly follows that it was the Son of
God, the true God, Jehovah the eternal God, whom the Prophet had in his
eye in the first verse and in the rest of the psalm.” See Appendix.

<span id="iii.i-p15"></span> The reading of the Septuagint is, ‘<span
id="iii.i-p15.1"></span>Οδοποιήσατε, “Make way.” The Hebrew word <span
id="iii.i-p15.2"></span>סלו, *sollu*, has this sense, as well as that of
*exalt* In two passages in Isaiah, the forms of expression are very like
the present passage, (<span id="iii.i-p15.3"></span>[Isa
57:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#014)<span id="iii.i-p15.3"></span>,.md)
“Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way;” and (<span
id="iii.i-p15.4"></span>[Isa
62:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#010)<span id="iii.i-p15.4"></span>,.md)
“Cast up, cast up the highway.” Jerome has, “<span
id="iii.i-p15.5"></span>Praeparate viam,” “Prepare yea way.” Walford
adopts the same translation, — “Prepare a way for him who rideth through
the deserts,” — which he explains in the following note: “The imagery is
borrowed from the custom of Eastern princes, who sent pioneers before
their armies, to reduce the hills, and carry raised roads through the
valleys, to facilitate their progress. God is described as riding
through the deserts, from his having accompanied Israel through the
wilderness, to conduct them to Canaan.”

<span id="fn_12"></span>[13](cc10002.htm#fr_12.md) <span
id="iii.i-p15.6"></span>

<span id="iii.i-p16"></span> The word <span
id="iii.i-p16.1"></span>בערבות, *baaraboth*, here rendered *the clouds*,
*or the heavens*, is by the LXX. translated *the west*, as if it were
derived from <span id="iii.i-p16.2"></span>ערב, *ereb*, *evening*; and
by the Vulgate, “<span id="iii.i-p16.3"></span>Super occasum,” “Upon the
going down of the sun.” Others translate it “deserts.” Thus, Jerome
reads, “<span id="iii.i-p16.4"></span>ascendenti per deserta,” “for him
that rideth through the deserts.” In this he is followed by Dr
Boothroyd, Bishops Lowth and Horsley, Drs Kennicott and Chandler, Fry,
and others; but critics of no less note read *heavens*, as Paginus,
Buxtorf, and Hammond. “The feminine <span id="iii.i-p16.5"></span>ערבה,”
says this last critic, “is frequently taken for *a plain*, and so for
*the desert*; but <span id="iii.i-p16.6"></span>ערבות, in the plural, is
acknowledged by the Hebrews to signify *the heavens*.” The idea is
altogether fanciful which has been put forth by some, that this word,
which frequently signifies *a plain* or *desert*, is applied to the
highest heavens, “either as being plain and void of stars, and so a kind
of superior desert, without anything in it, or (as the learned Grotius
piously conjectures from <span id="iii.i-p16.7"></span>[1Ti
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016)<span id="iii.i-p16.7"></span>.md)
because, as a desert, it is <span id="iii.i-p16.8"></span>ἀπρόσοιτον,
not approached or approachable by any.”

<span id="fn_13"></span>[14](cc10002.htm#fr_13.md) <span
id="iii.i-p16.10"></span>

<span id="iii.i-p17"></span> This is the rendering in all the ancient
versions, as the Septuagint, Chaldee, Syriac, Vulgate, etc. Many
instances might be produced in which <span id="iii.i-p17.1"></span>ב it
is redundant; as, for example, <span id="iii.i-p17.2"></span>[Ex
32:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#022.md)<span id="iii.i-p17.2"></span>,
<span id="iii.i-p17.3"></span>[Pr
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#026.md)<span id="iii.i-p17.3"></span>

<span id="fn_14"></span>[15](cc10002.htm#fr_14.md) <span
id="iii.i-p17.4"></span>

<span id="iii.i-p18"></span> This is the translation given by Horsley,
who applies the passage to Christ; and his criticism upon it is
excellent. “Upon mature consideration,” says he, “I am inclined to take
the text as it stands, and render it literally with Jerome, ‘In Jah is
his name;’ *i* *e*., his name, who is riding through the wilderness, is
in Jehovah, in the Self-existent One. He who led the armies of Israel
through the wilderness, when they first came up from Egypt, was Christ.
He who brought the captives home from Babylon was Christ. He who shall
finally bring the revolted Jews home to his Church, and, in a literal
sense, bring the nation home to its ancient seat, is Christ. Christ,
therefore, is intended here, under the image of one riding through the
wilderness, (‘<span id="iii.i-p18.1"></span>ascendenti per deserta,’
*Jerome*,) not upon the heavens, at the head of the returning captives.
‘*His name is in Jah*:’ Christ’s name is in Jehovah. <span
id="iii.i-p18.2"></span>שם, ‘the Name,’ is used, in the Hebrew language,
for the thing imperfectly apprehended, to which, however, a name
belongs. Thus, for God all languages have a name; and all men have an
idea of the Being intended by that name, as the First Cause, the Maker,
and Governor of the universe. Yet the human intellect, — we may say,
more generally, the created intellect, — comprehends not the nature of
this Great Being, nor can it enumerate his attributes. ‘The name of God’
is the incomprehensible Being who is all that the name imports, more
than is expressed; more, at least, than any name can express to the
finite understanding. Thus, when we are commanded to fear the name of
God, the injunction is, that we carry in our minds a constant fear of
the Being to whom that name belongs. The name, therefore, of Christ is
Christ himself, considered as known by a name, but yet imperfectly
understood, or rather incomprehensible in his nature. The sentence, ‘His
name is in Jehovah,’ is an emphatical assertion of his divinity,
introduced here to justify and enforce the worship enjoined. ‘Sing unto
God, sing praises to his name: cast up a way for him that is riding
through the wilderness.’ Who is he that is riding through the
wilderness, that we should pay him this respect? ‘He,’ says the
Psalmist, ‘who cannot be described.’ ‘His name is in Jah.’ His name and
his nature are involved in the name and nature of the Godhead. Name him:
you name the All-glorious One. Name the All-glorious One: you name him.
Name him as distinct from the All-Good and Glorious: you name him not
aright.”

<span id="iii.iii-p3"></span> Dr Geddes here observes, that “the poet
passes rapidly from former times to his own days, and the occasion of

kings of Syria, Ammon, Moab, and Edom: for with all these David had been
engaged in this war.”

<span id="iii.iii-p4"></span> The original word for “the women who
announce” is <span id="iii.iii-p4.1"></span>המבשרות, *hamebasseroth* It
is from <span id="iii.iii-p4.2"></span>בשר, *bisser*, “to announce
joyous tidings;” and, being a participle of the feminine gender, is very
properly referred to women, who were wont to celebrate victories, or any
kind of good news, with songs and music. But we find it on one occasion
used to express melancholy news, (<span id="iii.iii-p4.3"></span>[1Sa
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#017)<span id="iii.iii-p4.3"></span>..md)
The women here are represented as announcing the victory by singing
congratulatory songs. All the difficulty is, whether <span
id="iii.iii-p4.4"></span>המבשרות, *hamebasseroth*, be in the dative or
the genitive case. If in the genitive case, then <span
id="iii.iii-p4.5"></span>צבא, *tsaba*, which Calvin renders *army*,
must, as Hammond observes, be rendered *company* — great was the company
of the women who thus sang; and <span id="iii.iii-p4.6"></span>צבא, *an
host*, is often taken for the congregation or assembly employed in the
service of God. But it, may also be taken in the dative, as the same
critic remarks, and as Calvin here renders it. Castellio gives a similar
translation. “And thus the LXX. may be understood: <span
id="iii.iii-p4.7"></span>Ο Θεός Κύριος δώσει ῥη̑μα τοῖς εὐαγγελισαμένοις
(I suppose it should be <span id="iii.iii-p4.8"></span>ταῖς

victories; though it is certain the Latin that renders it ‘<span

<span id="iii.iii-p13"></span> The interpretation of this verse is
attended with great difficulty. Speaking of it and the following verse,
Dr Lowth says, “I am not at all satisfied with any explication I have
ever met with of these verses, either as to sense or construction, and I
must give them up as unintelligible to me. Houbigant helps out the
construction in his violent method: ‘<span
id="iii.iii-p13.1"></span>*Aut invenit viam*, *aut facit*.’” It is
pretty generally admitted, that in the first part of this verse a “state
of wretchedness and distress,” as Calvin remarks, is indicated; but it
is difficult to ascertain the meaning of the word <span
id="iii.iii-p13.2"></span>שפתים, *shephataim*, which he renders *pots*,
and, consequently, to ascertain to what the allusion particularly is.
None of the old translators have so rendered it; and numerous
significations have been given to it. The Chaldee renders it, “bounds in
the divisions of the way;” the Syriac and Arabic, “paths” or “ways;” the
Septuagint, <span id="iii.iii-p13.3"></span>κλήρων, “allotments,”
“inheritances,” or “portions,” apparently deriving the word from <span
id="iii.iii-p13.4"></span>שפת, <span
id="iii.iii-p13.5"></span>*divisit*, *ordinavit*, and perhaps attaching
to it a similar idea as in the preceding translations, men’s portions of
land or possessions having been divided and distinguished by *paths*
Jerome, adhering to the Septuagint, makes it “<span
id="iii.iii-p13.6"></span>inter medios terminos.” Thus, the word will
not be without significance, expressing a forlorn and wretched
condition, lying down betwixt the bounds; that is, in the highways. But
many modern critics think that it signifies something in relation to
pots, and that it may very probably be the same as that which the Arabs
call <span id="iii.iii-p13.7"></span>אתאפי, *Athaphi*, *stones* set in a
chimney for a pot to rest on, the pots being without legs. “Of these,”
says Hammond, “the Arabians had three, and the third being commonly (to
them in the desert) some fast piece of a rock, or the like, behind the
pot, — as in a chimney the back of the chimney itself, and that not
looked on as distinct from the chimney, — the other two at the sides,
which were loose, might fitly be here expressed in the dual number <span
id="iii.iii-p13.8"></span>שפתים; and then the *lying between these* will
betoken a very low, squalid condition, as in the ashes, or amidst the
soot and filth of the chimney.” “These two renderings,” he adds, “may
seem somewhat distant; and yet, considering that the <span
id="iii.iii-p13.9"></span>*termini* or bounds in divisions of ways were
but heaps of stones, or broken bricks, or rubbish, the word <span
id="iii.iii-p13.10"></span>שפתים, which signifies these, may well
signify these supporters of the pots also, in respect of the matter of
these being such stones or broken bricks.”

<span id="iii.iii-p14"></span>Parkhurst takes a view somewhat similar to
this last interpretation. He reads, “among the fire ranges,” or “rows of
stones.” “Those,” says he, “on which the caldrons or pots were placed
for boiling; somewhat like, I suppose, but of a more structure, than
those which Niebuhr says are used by the wandering Arabs. ‘Their
fire-place is soon constructed: they only set their pots upon *several
separate stones*, or over a hole digged in the earth.’ Lying among these
denotes the most abject slavery; for this seems to have been the place
of rest allotted to the vilest slaves. So, old Laertes, grieving for the
loss of his son, is described by Homer (in the Eleventh Book of the
Odyssey) as, in the winter, sleeping where the slaves did, in the ashes
near the fire: —

<span id="iii.iii-p15"></span><span id="iii.iii-p15.1"></span>‘—Oqi
dmwev eni oikw  
En koni agci purov.’”

<span id="iii.iii-p16"></span> See *his Lexicon* on <span
id="iii.iii-p16.1"></span>שפת ii.

<span id="iii.iii-p17"></span>The Chaldee has “broken bricks,” or
“rubbish,” that are thrown away; the word, according to this sense,
being derived from <span id="iii.iii-p17.1"></span>שפה, *shephah*, *to
bruise*, *to trample on* A similar noun, <span
id="iii.iii-p17.2"></span>אשפת, *ashpoth*, derived from the verb <span
id="iii.iii-p17.3"></span>שפה, is used in <span
id="iii.iii-p17.4"></span>[Ps
113:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#007.md)<span id="iii.iii-p17.4"></span>,
for *a dunghill*, or the vilest place, whither all kinds of rubbish are
cast out, and where the poor are said to lie. When Job was brought by
Satan to the lowest depths of affliction, he sat down among the ashes,
and scraped himself with a potsherd, which indicated the state of
extreme sadness and debasement to which he was reduced. If this is the
sense here, “lying among the broken bricks or rubbish” expresses, in
like manner as the preceding translations, the most mean, dejected, and
wretched condition.

<span id="iii.iii-p18"></span>Harmer’s attempt to explain this passage
is at least very ingenious: — As shepherds in the East betake
themselves, during the night, for shelter to the caves which they find
in their rocky hills, where they can kindle fires to warm themselves, as
well as dress their provisions, and as doves, as well as other birds,
frequently haunt such places, he conjectures that the afflicted state of
Israel in Egypt is here compared to the condition of a dove making its
abode in the hollow of a rock which had been smutted by the fires which
the shepherds had made in it. He supposes the word here translated
*pots* to mean the little heaps of stones on which the shepherds set
their pots, there being a hollow under them to contain the fire. —
*Harmer*’*s Observations*, volume 1, pp. 176, 177.

<span id="iii.iii-p19"></span>Gesenius thinks the word is equivalent to
<span id="iii.iii-p19.1"></span>המשפתים, *hammishpethaim*, which occurs
in <span id="iii.iii-p19.2"></span>[Jud
5:16](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#016.md)<span id="iii.iii-p19.2"></span>,
and which our English version makes “sheepfolds,” the only difference
between the two words being, that the word here wants the formative
letter <span id="iii.iii-p19.3"></span>מ, *mem* Thus, it may refer to
the condition of the Israelites when living among their flocks in the
wilderness. We have not yet exhausted the different significations
affixed by commentators to this word; but, without referring to more, we
shall only add, that, according to some, the allusion is to the
condition of the Israelites in Egypt, who were doomed to the drudgery of
brick-making and pottery, and had probably to sleep among the
brick-kilns or earthenware manufactories in which they were employed.

<span id="iii.iii-p20"></span>With respect to the second clause of the
verse, in which an image taken from the dove is introduced, a difficulty
which has been stated is, how her feathers can be said to resemble
yellow gold. From the circumstance, that the splendor of gold is here
intermingled, Harmer concludes that this is not a description of the
animal merely as adorned by the hand of nature, but that the allusion is
to white doves that were consecrated to the Syrian deities, and adorned
with trinkets of gold, the meaning being, “Israel is to me as a
*consecrated* dove; and though your circumstances have made you rather
appear like a poor dove, blackened by taking up its abode in a smoky
hole of the rocks, yet shall you become beautiful and glorious as a
Syrian silver-coloured pigeon, on which some ornament of gold is put.” —
*Harmer*’*s Observations*, volume 1, p. 180. But there are certainly
doves which answer to the description here given, some of them having
the feathers on the sides of the neck of a shining copper color, which
in a bright sun must resemble gold. See *Encyc*. *Brit*. *Art*.
*Columbia*. Besides, the reference is not necessarily to the color of
gold, but to its brilliancy. How highly poetical an emblem, to depict
the glorious change effected in the condition of the Hebrews by the
deliverance which God had granted them over the proud and formidable
enemies who had kept them in the degrading condition represented in the
first clause of the verse!

<span id="iii.iii-p23"></span> Salmon is the name of a mountain in
Samaria, in the tribe of Ephraim, (<span id="iii.iii-p23.1"></span>[Jud

white with perpetual snow.

<span id="iii.iii-p24"></span> Carrieres, in his paraphrase, has, “You
became white as snow on mount Salmon.” “We certainly think,” says the
author of the Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible, “that Carrieres has
seized the right idea. The intention evidently is, to describe by a
figure the honor and prosperity the Hebrews acquired by the defeat of
their enemies, and to express this by whiteness, and superlatively by
the whiteness of snow. Nothing can be more usual in Persia, for
instance, than for a person to say, under an influx of prosperity or
honor, or on receiving happy intelligence, ‘My face is made white;’ or
gratefully, in return for a favor or compliment, ‘You have made my face
white;’ so also, ‘His face is whitened,’ expresses the sense which is
entertained of the happiness or favor which has before been received.
Such a figurative use of the idea of whiteness does, we imagine, furnish
the best explanation of the present and some other texts of Scripture.”

<span id="iii.iii-p25"></span> Instead of “in Salmon,” the Targum has,
“in the shade of death;” and Boothroyd has,

<span id="iii.iii-p27"></span>Walford gives a similar version, and
explains the meaning to be, “Though you have been in bondage and the
darkness of a dejected condition, you are now illuminated with the
splendor of victory and prosperity.”

<span id="iii.iv-p3"></span> “<span id="iii.iv-p3.1"></span>La montagne
des hauteurs,” “the hill of highnesses or eminences.” — *Fr*. That is,
(says Calvin, on the margin,) “<span id="iii.iv-p3.2"></span>treshaute,”
“very high.” The literal rendering of the original words is, “a hill of
gibbosities,” “a hill with humps,” *i* *e*., projections, eminences.
This seems peculiarly applicable to Bashan, which had many tops; and
this may explain the origin of the name of that mountain. It has its
name from <span id="iii.iv-p3.3"></span>שן, *a tooth*; and <span
id="iii.iv-p3.4"></span>הר בשן, *the mountain with teeth*, might be
given to it, from the appearance of the face of it studded over with
small hills. See Street, *in loco* What is here rendered “a high hill,”
is, in the Septuagint, rendered <span id="iii.iv-p3.5"></span>ὄρος
τετυρωμένον, and in the Vulgate, “mons coagulatus,” “cheesey, full of
cheeses;” or, as Hammond renders it, “a hill that yielded much butter
and cheese,” Bashan being a rich and fertile mountain beyond Jordan.
Horsley has, “a hill of lofty brows;” and Fry, “a hill of swelling
heights.”

<span id="fn_31"></span>[32](cc10002.htm#fr_31.md) <span
id="iii.iv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv-p9"></span> The word here rendered *leap ye* “occurs
only here,” observes Hammond, “and is by guess rendered *to leap*, or
*lift up*, or *exalt* one’s self; but may best be interpreted, not
*leap* as an expression of joy, but *lift up*, or *exalt* yourselves, as
an effect of pride;” and he understands the meaning to be, Why do ye
lift up or exalt yourselves, ye high hills, God not having chosen any of
the highest hills to build his temple on, but the hill of Zion, of a
very moderate size, lower than the hill of Hermon, and at the foot of
it, (<span id="iii.iv-p9.1"></span>[Ps
133:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#003)<span id="iii.iv-p9.1"></span>..md)
Some Jewish commentators, founding their opinion on the cognate Arabic
word <span id="iii.iv-p9.2"></span>רצר, would render it, *to look after*
This gives the same sense. What look ye for? what expect ye, ye high
hills, to be done to you? Ye are not those which God has chosen to
beautify with his glorious presence, but mount Zion is the object of his
choice. Aquila and Jerome read, “Why contend ye?” Dr Chandler renders
it, “Why look askance?” *i* *e*., “with jealous leer malign,” as Milton
expresses it. “Why are ye jealous?” Horsley, following Jerome, has, “For
what would ye contend?”

<span id="fn_32"></span>[33](cc10002.htm#fr_32.md) <span
id="iii.iv-p9.3"></span>

<span id="iii.iv-p10"></span> “The Psalmist,” says Horsley, “having
settled the Israelites between their hills, proceeds to the circumstance
of God’s choice of a hill for the site of his temple. He poetically
imagines the different hills as all ambitious of the honor, anxiously
waiting God’s decision, and ready to enter into a jealous contention;
*watching each other with an anxious eye*. The lofty hill of Bashan
first puts in his claim, pleading his stately height —

<span id="iii.iv-p11"></span>The hill for God is the hill of Bashan;  
A hill of lofty brows is the hill of Bashan.

<span id="iii.iv-p12"></span>The Psalmist cuts short the contention —

<span id="iii.iv-p13"></span>For what would ye contend, ye hills of
lofty brows?  
This is the hill desired of God for himself to dwell in;  
Yea, Jehovah will dwell in it for ever.”

<span id="fn_33"></span>[34](cc10002.htm#fr_33.md) <span
id="iii.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv-p16"></span> The words <span
id="iii.iv-p16.1"></span>אלפי שנאן, *alphey shinan*, which Calvin
renders “thousands of angels,” are literally “thousands of repetition;”
the noun <span id="iii.iv-p16.2"></span>שנאן, *shanan*, being derived
from <span id="iii.iv-p16.3"></span>שנה, *shanah*, *he repeated* or
*reiterated* Accordingly, the reading which many prefer is, “The
chariots of God are twenty thousand thousands multiplied or reiterated.”
Hammond, who adopts this translation, observes, that “though angels are
not mentioned, they are to be understood, as <span
id="iii.iv-p16.4"></span>[Jude
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#014.md)<span id="iii.iv-p16.4"></span>,
<span id="iii.iv-p16.5"></span>μυριάδες ἁγίαι, *holy myriads*.” Horsley
reads, “Twenty thousand thousand of thousands is the cavalry of God.”
“The cavalry of God,” says he, “is every thing in nature which he
employs as the instruments or vehicles of his power. The image, which
some would introduce here of God riding in a car drawn by angels, I
cannot admire; nor do I think that it is really to be found in any
passage of Scripture rightly understood.” But God, though not here
represented as riding on a car drawn by angels, is undoubtedly, in the
most magnificent style of Eastern poetry, represented as riding on his
exalted car, attended by legions of angels, mounted also on cars. Comp.

French and Skinner give a different view of the passage, which brings
out a very good sense —

<span id="iii.iv-p17"></span>“God hath been to them \[the Israelites\]
twice ten thousand chariots,  
Even thousand of thousands.”

<span id="iii.iv-p18"></span>Chariots were much used in war by the
nations of antiquity; and the chosen people were forbidden to use
chariots and horses in war; but God was to them as effectual a
safe-guard as innumerable war-chariots would have been. He was “the
chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof,” <span

thinks that <span id="iii.v-p11.3"></span>ἐν ἀςθρώπω in the Septuagint
is a corruption for <span id="iii.v-p11.4"></span>ἐπ᾿ ἀνθρώποις; and
that Paul read in that version <span id="iii.v-p11.5"></span>ἔλαθες
δοματα ἐπ᾿ ανθρώποις, which is the true sense of the Hebrew words, being
no other than this, “Thou hast received gifts on account of men;” *i*
*e*., to give to men. Paul, therefore, might say <span
id="iii.v-p11.6"></span>ἔδωκε instead of <span

does the Chaldee Paraphrast, and the Syriac and Arabic translators.

<span id="iii.v-p14"></span> “The word <span

translate, ‘Blessed be the Lord, day by day, who bears our burthens for

an active verb it signifies ‘to load, to lay a burthen on another,’ but
in no instance to bear or support one, <span

<span id="iii.v-p15"></span> The Septuagint has, <span
id="iii.v-p15.1"></span>Τοῦ Κυρίου διέξοδοι τοῦ θανάτου, “To the Lord
belong the passages of death,” expressing the ways by which death *goes
out* upon men to destroy them. The Vulgate has, “<span
id="iii.v-p15.2"></span>exitus mortus,” “the goings out of death;” and
the Chaldee Paraphrast, “From before the Lord, death, and the going out
of the soul to suffocation, do contend or fight against the wicked.”
Hammond follows the LXX. He observed, that the original words “must
literally be rendered *goings forth to death*, and must signify the
several plagues and judgments inflicted by God on impenitent enemies,
the ways of punishing and destroying the Egyptians and Canaanites,
drowning in the sea, killing by the sword, infesting by hornets, etc.;
and these are properly to be attributed and imputed to God, as the
deliverances of the Israelites, his people, in the former part of the
verse; and to this sense the consequents incline, verse 21, ‘Even God
shall wound.’ Horsley reads the verse,

<span id="iii.v-p16"></span>“He that is our God is a God of salvation,  
And for death are the goings forth of the Lord Jehovah;

<span id="iii.v-p17"></span>“*i*.*e*.,” says he, “When Jehovah takes the

<span id="iii.v-p18"></span> Agreeably to this, Hewlett observes, that
the “*issues* *of death* mean the many providential escapes and
deliverances from death;” and Boothroyd reads,

<span id="iii.v-p19"></span>“For to Jehovah we owe our escapes from
death.”

<span id="iii.v-p20"></span>The Syriac version has, —

<span id="iii.v-p24"></span> Bishops Hare and Horsley suppose that there
is here an allusion to the usage of the people in those Arabian regions,
who nourished their hair on the crown of their head, that by their
unshorn heads and shaggy hair they might appear more fierce. “The
expressions, ‘the head,’ and ‘the hairy crown,’” observes Bishop Horne,
“denote the principal part, the strength, the pride, and the glory of
the adversary which was to be crushed;” and Roberts, in his Oriental
Illustrations, observes, that “this language, ‘*wounding the crown of
the hair*,’ still used in the East, is equivalent to saying, ‘I will
kill you.’”

<span id="iii.v-p27"></span> Or, “I will bring again from Bashan,” may
be thus explained. I will perform for my people the like wonders which I
did in the days of old; I will render them victorious over their proud
enemies, as I before enabled them to triumph in the conflict with Og
king of Bashan, (<span id="iii.v-p27.1"></span>[Deut.

[4](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#004)<span id="iii.v-p27.1"></span>;.md) and
I will deliver them from the greatest dangers, as I saved them from the
Red Sea, by opening up a passage for them through the midst of it.

<span id="iii.v-p28"></span> Walford considers the persons here
intended, not God’s people, but their enemies. “It is evident,” says he,
“from the next verse, that the persons who are here meant are the
enemies of God and his people; because the purpose for which they were
to be brought was, that his people might completely triumph over them in
their utter slaughter and destruction. These, he says, I will bring back
from Bashan, and from the abysses of the sea; thus referring to the
victories that had been gained over the kings of the Canaanites, and the
triumph of Israel at the Red Sea. The design of this declaration is, to
express the determination of God to bring forth all his enemies to
destruction: be they on the heights of Bashan, or in the profoundest
depths of the ocean, they shall not escape; his hand will lay hold upon
them, and his power utterly destroy them. In <span
id="iii.v-p28.1"></span>[Am 9:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.v-p28.1"></span>, and in <span id="iii.v-p28.2"></span>[Ob
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#004.md)<span id="iii.v-p28.2"></span>,
there are two sublime illustrations of the sentiment that is here
delivered.” “Bashan was east of Judea,” says Boothroyd, “and the sea in
the west, so that the meaning is, that God would bring his enemies from
every quarter to be slain by his people.”

<span id="iii.v-p31"></span> “This doubtless refers to the order of the
procession then on its march, and to that of religious processions in
general. In the religious and festal processions of the Hindoos there is
the same order and classes of performers. The singers, men and women,
precede, singing songs appropriate to the occasion; and then the players
on instruments follow after.” — *Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible*.

<span id="iii.vi-p3"></span> “The musical instrument here rendered
‘timbrels’ was a sort of small drum, carried in the hand, (<span
id="iii.vi-p3.2"></span>[Ex 15:20](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.vi-p3.2"></span>,) and played on by beating with the hand or
fingers, as is probable from <span id="iii.vi-p3.3"></span>[Na
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/nah002.htm#007.md)<span id="iii.vi-p3.3"></span>. It
was used both on civil and religious occasions; and is often mentioned,
as here, to have been beaten by women, but was sometimes played on by
men. It was very like, if not the same kind of instrument as the modern
Syrian *diff*, which is described by Dr Russell as ‘a hoop, (sometimes
with bits of brass fixed in it to make a jingling,) over which a piece
of parchment is distended. It is beat with the fingers; and is the true
tympanum of the ancients, as appears from its figure in several relievos
representing the orgies of Bacchus, and the rites of Cybele. It is worth
observing, that, according to Juvenal, the Romans had this instrument
from Syria.’ Niebuhr also has given us a similar description, and a
print of an instrument which, (according to his German spelling,) he
says, they call *doff*: He informs us that they ‘hold it by the bottom,
in the air, with one hand, while they play on it with the other.’ The
Oriental *diff* appears to be very like what is known to the French and
English by the name of *tambourine*.” — *Mant*.

<span id="iii.vi-p7"></span> “A metaphor denoting the posterity of
Israel, springing, as it were, from a common source or fountain.” —
*Mant* Bishop Hare’s conjectural emendation gives a good sense; but it
seems unnecessary. Instead of <span id="iii.vi-p7.1"></span>ממקור,
*mimmekor*, he proposes to read <span id="iii.vi-p7.2"></span>מקור,
*mekor*; and then the passage would run thus: —

<span id="iii.vi-p8"></span>“The fount whence blessings spring to
Israel’s race.”

<span id="iii.vi-p9"></span>Horsley reads, “The Lord of the stock of
Israel;” and explains it of the Messiah, who was of the stock of Israel
according to the flesh. Fry conceives that the reading more strictly may
be, “*from the quarry of Israel*; dug, as it were, from this pit, hewn
from this rock. See <span id="iii.vi-p9.1"></span>[Isa
51:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.vi-p9.1"></span>.”

<span id="iii.vi-p12"></span> Why these tribes in particular? May it be,
Judah (having, instead of Reuben, succeeded to the blessing which
conveyed the privilege of having the Chief Ruler and Messiah of his
line) and Benjamin (<span id="iii.vi-p12.1"></span>צעיר) the youngest?
or Judah and Benjamin, as two of the tribes most southern and nearest to
Jerusalem; and Zebulun and Naphtali, as two of the most northern and
most remote? as another way of expressing ‘from Dan to Beersheba,’ to
include them all.” — *Dr* *Lowth*

<span id="fn_50"></span>[51](cc10002.htm#fr_50.md) <span

<span id="iii.vi-p13"></span> Of other conjectures the following are a
specimen: “As for Zebulun and Naphtali, why their names are here added
rather than any of the other tribes, the reason may, perhaps, best be
taken from what we find prophesied of those two (<span

‘They shall handle the pen of the writer.’” — *Hammond*. “It then
specifies the tribes of Judah, Zebulun, and Naphtali, not as if they
were the only tribes present, but as occupying, perhaps, the foremost
ranks of the procession, and followed by all the other tribes.” —

<span id="iii.vi-p15"></span> The Septuagint has, “There is Benjamin the

<span id="fn_54"></span>[55](cc10002.htm#fr_54.md) <span

<span id="iii.vi-p17"></span> The word <span
id="iii.vi-p17.1"></span>רגמתם, *rigmatham*, here translated
*congregation* or *assembly*, signifies, according to Parkhurst, *a heap
of stones for defence*, *a bulwark of stones*; and he considers it to be
here applied metaphorically to the princes of Judah, who, so to speak,
were *the bulwark* of Israel. Horsley adopts the same reading: “The
princes of Judah their bulwark.” Hammond, after stating that the word
signifies *a stone*, observes, that it “is here used in a metaphorical
sense for a *ruler* or *governor*, as a *foundation-stone* which
supports the whole building may fitly be applied to a commonwealth, and
then signify the prince thereof.” In this sense the LXX., no doubt,
understood <span id="iii.vi-p17.2"></span>רגמתם, *rigmatham*, who render
it <span id="iii.vi-p17.3"></span>ἡγεμόνες αὐτων, “their governors.” “It
may mean,” says Pike, in his Hebrew Lexicon, “their supreme authority,
signified by *stoning*, a capital punishment among the Israelites, in
the same manner as it was represented among the Romans by the <span
id="iii.vi-p17.4"></span>Fasces and <span
id="iii.vi-p17.5"></span>Securis, the instruments of punishment carried
before the Consuls.” Jerome, however, has taken it for another word
nearly similar to it in its letters, signifying purple, — “<span
id="iii.vi-p17.6"></span>in purpura sua;” — but this comes to the same
thing as the Septuagint translation. Dathe has “<span
id="iii.vi-p17.7"></span>agmen,” “a troop;” and according to Gesenius,
it signifies “a multitude, crowd, band.”

<span id="fn_55"></span>[56](cc10002.htm#fr_55.md) <span
id="iii.vii-p8.4"></span>

<span id="iii.vii-p9"></span> Instead of *the company of spearmen*, the
greater number of modern critics consider *the wild beast of the reeds*
as the most correct translation; and this is understood by many to
represent the Egyptian people and government under the emblem of the
hippopotamus or river-horse, the behemoth of Scripture. This animal —
which is a quadruped of enormous size, of prodigious strength, fierce
and cruel in its disposition, and whose skin is so impenetrable that no
arrows can pierce it — shelters and reposes itself among the tall reeds
which skirt in abundance the banks of the Nile, (<span
id="iii.vii-p9.1"></span>[Job
40:21](../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#021)<span id="iii.vii-p9.1"></span>..md)
It is a very appropriate emblem of the Egyptian power, in the height of
its greatness so formidable, and the inveterate enemy of Israel. And
that the Psalmist here refers to it has been thought the more probable,
from his mentioning, in the clause immediately following, the bulls and
calves of the people, these animals having been honored and worshipped
as deities by that degenerate and superstitious nation. Or, the *wild
beast of the reeds* may, as is supposed by others, denote the same power
under the representation of the crocodile, to which the characteristics
of the hippopotamus, now specified, are equally applicable. By this
ferocious and truculent animal Pharaoh king of Egypt is represented in
<span id="iii.vii-p9.2"></span>[Ezek.
29:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#003.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/eze029.htm#005.md), [Ezek.
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#002.md)<span id="iii.vii-p9.2"></span>;
and in <span id="iii.vii-p9.3"></span>[Ps
74:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#014.md)<span id="iii.vii-p9.3"></span>.
This, it would appear, was anciently employed as an emblem of Egypt. On
a medal which the Emperor Augustine caused to be struck after he had
completely reduced this powerful kingdom, Egypt is represented by the
figure of a crocodile bound with a chain to a palm-tree, with the
inscription, <span id="iii.vii-p9.4"></span>*Nemo antea relegavit*.
Dathe, however, rejects the opinion, that the crocodile, and under it
the King of Egypt, is pointed at; and observes, that David cultivated
peace with the King of Egypt, and that, in verse 31st, the Egyptians are
commemorated as worshippers of the true God. He supposes that *the wild
beast of the reeds* may be an epithet applied to the lion, who is
accustomed to haunt places where reeds grow, and that under this image
the King of Syria may be referred to, with whom David carried on
lengthened and bloody wars, as is abundantly evident from sacred
history. Dr Lowth also supposes that *the lion* is meant, (see his
*Lectures on Sacred Poetry*, volume 1, p. 135;) and the same view is
adopted by Schnurrer, Rosenmuller, and others.

<span id="iii.vii-p10"></span> The original term is <span

id="iii.vii-p10.3"></span>

<span id="iii.vii-p11"></span> While by *the multitude of bulls* some
understand powerful leaders, by *the calves of the people* they
understand the mass of the people, undistinguished for rank or power,
and particularly the young men. But others, as Bishop Horne, suppose,
that by *the calves of the people* is meant the idol-calves of the
Egyptians, their Apis, Osiris, etc., whom they made the objects of their
religious worship. Horsley reads, “The assembly of those who place their
strength in the calves;” that is, as he explains it, “The people of
Egypt, who worshipped calves, and trusted in them as their gods.”

<span id="fn_58"></span>[59](cc10002.htm#fr_58.md) <span
id="iii.vii-p11.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii-p12"></span>In Bagster’s interlinear version, the
rendering is, “*shall* *be each* submitting itself with pieces of
silver.” Wheatland and Silvester translate,

<span id="iii.vii-p13"></span>“Till each submiss, from hostile acts
shall cease,  
And with the tribute-silver sue for peace.”

<span id="fn_59"></span>[60](cc10002.htm#fr_59.md) <span
id="iii.vii-p13.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vii-p14"></span> Various other explanations have been
given of the words, <span id="iii.vii-p14.1"></span>מתרפס ברצי-כסף,
*mithrappes beratsey-kaseph*, rendered by Calvin, *treading with their
feet upon pieces of silver*, and by which critics have been much
perplexed. “Berlin translates the words ‘<span
id="iii.vii-p14.2"></span>calcantem frusta argenti,’ which he explains
by ‘<span id="iii.vii-p14.3"></span>pavimentum argento tessellatum.’ De
Rossi explains the words thus, ‘Who advance with laminae of silver under
their horses’ hoofs.’ Immanuel Ben Solomon, whose *Scholia* on select
passages of the Psalms were published by De Rossi, gives the following
explanation. ‘<span id="iii.vii-p14.4"></span>Dicit \[vates scil.\] quod
Deus disperdit nationes, quae volunt malum inferre Israeli, et coetum
taurorum, seu reges illustriores, ut reges Assyriae et Babylonis, quorum
quisque conculcat frusta argentea; *i* *e*., incedunt cum lamina aurea
sub pedibus suis ob multitudinem divitiarum suarum.’” — *Rogers*’ *Book
of Psalms*, volume 2, p. 223. Dr Geddes’ version is:

<span id="iii.vii-p15"></span>“The assemblage of the potent lords of
nations,  
Who tread on tiles of silver;”

<span id="iii.vii-p16"></span>and he supposes that the poet alludes to
the floors in the palaces of the Oriental kings, which were paved with
silver. Dr Jubb renders the phrase, “who excite themselves with
fragments of silver;” and considers the allusion to be to the dancing of
the Egyptians before their idol-calves, with the tinkling instruments
called Sistra. That they were accustomed to dance before these idols is
evident from <span id="iii.vii-p16.2"></span>[Ex
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#006.md)<span id="iii.vii-p16.2"></span>,
where we are taught that the people of Israel, in imitation of the
Egyptian idolatry, rose up to shout and dance before the golden calf;
for such is the meaning of the words, “they rose up to play,” as appears
from <span id="iii.vii-p16.3"></span>[Ex
32:17-19](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.vii-p16.3"></span>. And that they used the *sistrum* in
religious feasts, Herodotus informs us in the second book of his
History. The words, *pieces of silver*, according to Jubb, signify the
little loose pieces of metal with which the *sistrum* was hung round,
which produced the jingling noise when the instrument was played upon.
This description fits the Egyptians; and that it really belongs to them
may be inferred, with some degree of probability, from the following
verse, where it is said, “Princes shall come out of Egypt,” as if the
subjugation of this nation, imprecated in the preceding verse, were here
supposed complete. Tucker has here a very good remark. “David,” says he,
“invokes the Messiah to bring down the power of Egypt; but in his
abhorrence of their idolatry, deigns not to designate them except in the
most contemptuous terms. He says not, Rebuke the assembly of those who
worship bulls and calves, and dance round altars to the sound of
instruments of silver, but he classes the people on a par with the idols
which they worshipped, — ‘the assembly of bulls and calves, who dance to
bits (or pieces) of silver.’”

<span id="iii.vii-p17"></span>“The *sistrum* was of an oval figure, or a
dilated semicircle, in the shape of a shoulder-belt, with brass wires
across, which played in holes wherein they were stopped by their flat
heads. The performer played on it by shaking the *sistrum* in cadence,
and thereby the brass wires made a shrill and loud noise.” — *Mant*.

<span id="iii.viii-p6"></span> “The Hebrew is very emphatic: — ‘Cush
will cause her hands to run out to God.’ She will with great *alacrity*
and delight surrender her *power* and *influence* unto God.” — *Dr*
*Adam Clarke*.

<span id="iii.viii-p11"></span> “This refers to the phenomena of thunder

an irresistible agent — destroying life, tearing towers and castles to
pieces, rending the strongest oaks, and cleaving the most solid rocks;
and the most enlightened nations have justly considered it as an
especial manifestation of the power and Sovereignty of God.” —
