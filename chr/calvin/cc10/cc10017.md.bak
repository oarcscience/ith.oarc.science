<span id="xviii-p1"></span>PSALM 83

<span id="xviii-p2"></span>The prophet implores the divine aid against
the enemies of the Church, and, as an argument for obtaining this the
more easily, he enumerates the many nations which had conspired together
for the express purpose of exterminating the people of Israel, and
thereby extinguishing the very name of the Church of God. To stir up
himself and others to greater earnestness and confidence in prayer, he
shows, by many examples, how mightily God had been wont to succor his
servants.

<span id="xviii-p3"></span>A Song or Psalm of Asaph.

<span id="xviii.i"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p1"></span><span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
83:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#001.md)<span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p2"></span>**1.** O God! keep not silence with
thyself; hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God! **2.** For,
behold! Thy enemies are tumultuous: and those who hate thee have lifted
up the head. **3.** They have formed a crafty design against thy people,
and have consulted against thy hidden ones. **4.** They have said, Come
and let us cut them off from being a nation; and let the name of Israel
be no more remembered.

<span id="xviii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xviii.i-p4"></span><span id="xviii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p5"></span>**1** *O God! hold not thy peace.* It is
very generally agreed among commentators, that this psalm was composed
during the reign of king Jehoshaphat; and in this opinion I readily
concur. That godly king, as is well known, had to engage in dreadful
wars against multiplied hosts of enemies. Although the Ammonites and
Moabites were the originators of the principal war in which he was
engaged, yet they mustered forces not only from Syria, but also from
distant countries, and the troops thus brought together well nigh
overwhelmed Judea with their multitude. It would then appear, from the
long list of enemies, here enumerated, who had conspired together to
destroy the people of God, that the conjecture is well-founded which
refers the composition of this psalm to that occasion;  <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) and sacred history informs us, that
one of the Levites, under the influence of the Spirit of prophecy, gave
the king assurance of victory,  <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md)
and that the Levites sang before the Lord. In the midst of so great
dangers, the whole nation, as well as the holy king, must have been
involved in the deepest distress; and, accordingly, we have here a
prayer full of earnestness and solicitude. These feelings prompted the
repetition of the words which occur in the very opening of the psalm,
*Hold not thy peace, Keep not silence, be not still* By this, the
faithful would intimate, that if God intended to succor them, it behoved
him to make haste, else the opportunity for doing so would be lost. It
is unquestionably our duty to wait patiently when God at any time delays
his help; but, in condescension to our infirmity, he permits us to
supplicate him to make haste. What I have rendered, *keep not silence
with thyself,* is literally *keep not silence to thyself,* which some
translate by the paraphrase, *Hold not thy peace in thy own cause,* — an
exposition which is too refined to be more particularly noticed. This
form of expression is equivalent to saying, *Hold not thyself in.*
Perhaps the particle is here superfluous, as it is in many other places.

<span id="xviii.i-p8"></span><span id="xviii.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p9"></span>**2** *For, behold! thy enemies are
tumultuous.* As an argument for enforcing the prayer of the preceding
verse, it is affirmed that the faithful are oppressed both by the
impetuous violence and the crafty policy of their enemies, which, to all
human appearance, rendered their escape from death utterly hopeless.
When it is said that *they are tumultuous* and *lift up the head,* the
meaning is, that relying upon their own power, they behave themselves
insolently and proudly. By this conduct on the part of their enemies,
the minds of the people of God are greatly depressed, and the only way
in which they can obtain relief, is by making their moan to Him whose
continual work it is to repress the proud. When, therefore, the saints
implore his aid, it is their ordinary course to lay before him the
perverseness of their enemies. It is worthy of notice, that those who
molest the Church are called *the enemies of God.*

<span id="xviii.i-p10"></span>It affords us no small ground of
confidence that those who are our enemies are also God’s enemies. This
is one of the fruits of his free and gracious covenant, in which he has
promised to be an enemy to all our enemies, — a promise for which there
is good cause, when it is considered that the welfare of his people,
whom he has taken under his protection, cannot be assailed without an
injury being, at the same the done to his own majesty. Meanwhile, let us
live at peace with all men, as much as in us lies, and let us endeavor
to practice uprightness in our whole deportment, that we may be able
confidently to appeal to God, that when we suffer at the hands of men,
we suffer wrongfully. The pride and violent assaults of our enemies may
be combined with craftiness. But when such is the case, it becomes us to
yield to God the honor which belongs to him, by resting satisfied that
He can succor us; for to break the proud who foam out their rage, and to
take the crafty in their own craftiness, is work which He has been
accustomed to perform in all ages. To keep us from thinking that we are
abandoned to the snares and traps of our enemies, the prophet here
seasonably sets before us a consideration calculated to administer the
highest consolation and hope, when he calls us *God’s hidden ones* This
expression is understood by some as meaning that the aid and protection
which God extends to us, is not apparent to the eye of sense and reason;
just as it is said elsewhere of the life of the people of God, that it
is *hid,* (<span id="xviii.i-p10.1"></span>[Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003)<span id="xviii.i-p10.1"></span>..md)
But this interpretation is too forced, and altogether inconsistent both
with the scope of the passage and the natural construction of the words.
The design of them is simply to teach that we are hidden under the
shadow of God’s wings; for although to outward appearance we lie open,
and are exposed to the will of the wicked and the proud, we are
preserved by the hidden power of God.  <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) Accordingly, it is said in another
Psalm, (27:5,)

<span id="xviii.i-p12"></span>“In the time of trouble he shall hide me
in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me.”
(<span id="xviii.i-p12.1"></span>[Ps
27:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa027.htm#005)<span id="xviii.i-p12.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xviii.i-p13"></span>It is, however, at the same time to be
observed, that none are hid under the keeping and protection of God but
those who, renouncing all dependence on their own strength, betake
themselves with fear and trembling to Him. Such as under the influence
of a flattering belief in the sufficiency of their own strength to
resist, boldly enter the conflict, and, as if devoid of all fear, wax
wanton, will ultimately suffer the consequences which result from
inadequate resources.  <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) We will
then best consult our own safety by taking shelter under the shadow of
the Almighty, and, conscious of our own weakness, committing our
salvation to him, casting it, so to speak, into his bosom.

<span id="xviii.i-p15"></span><span id="xviii.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p16"></span>**4** *They have said, Come and let us cut
them off from being a nation.* The wickedness of these hostile powers is
aggravated from the circumstance, that it was their determined purpose
utterly to exterminate the Church. This may be restricted to the
Ammonites and Moabites, who were as bellows to blow up the flame in the
rest. But the Hagarenes, the Syrians, and the other nations, being by
their instigation affected with no less hatred and fury against the
people of God, for whose destruction they had taken up arms, we may
justly consider this vaunting language as uttered by the whole of the
combined host; for having entered into a mutual compact they rushed
forward with rival eagerness, and encouraged one another to destroy the
kingdom of Judah. The prime agent in exciting such cruel hatred was
doubtless Satan, who has all along from the beginning been exerting
himself to extinguish the Church of God, and who, for this purpose, has
never ceased to stir up his own children to outrage. The phrase, *to cut
them off from being a nation,* signifies to exterminate them root and
branch, and thus to put an end to them as a nation or people. That this
is the meaning is more clearly evinced from the second clause of the
verse, *Let the name of Israel be no more remembered* The compassion of
God would in no small degree be excited by the circumstance that this
war was not undertaken, as wars commonly have been, to bring them, when
conquered, under the power of their enemies; but the object which the
cruelty of their enemies aimed at was their entire destruction. And what
did this amount to but to an attempt to overthrow the decree of God on
which the perpetual duration of the Church depends.

<span id="xviii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
83:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#005.md)<span id="xviii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p2"></span>**5.** For they have consulted with the
heart together; they have entered into a covenant  <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) against thee. **6.** The tents of
Edom,  <span id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) and the Ishmaelites
 <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) Moab  <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) and the Hagarenes.  <span
id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) **7.** Gebal,  <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) and Ammon,  <span
id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) and Amalek  <span
id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) the Philistines with the inhabitants
of Tyre. **8.** Assur is also associated with them: they have been an
arm to the sons of Lot. Selah.

<span id="xviii.ii-p11"></span> 

<span id="xviii.ii-p12"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p13"></span>**5** *For they have consulted with the
heart together.* The multiplied hosts which united their powers together
to oppose the Church of God and to effect her overthrow, are here
enumerated. As so many nations, formed into one powerful confederacy,
were bent on the destruction of a kingdom not greatly distinguished by
its power, the miraculous aid of God was indispensably necessary for the
deliverance of a people who, in such extremity, were altogether unable
to defend themselves. In circumstances apparently as hopeless good king
Asa gave utterance to that truly magnanimous reflection:

<span id="xviii.ii-p14"></span>“Lord, it is nothing with thee to help
whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O Lord our
God! for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this
multitudes”  
(<span id="xviii.ii-p14.2"></span>[1Ch
14:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch1014.htm#011.md)<span
id="xviii.ii-p14.2"></span>.)

<span id="xviii.ii-p15"></span>The same Spirit who inspired that pious
king with such invincible fortitude dictated this psalm for the benefit
of the whole Church, to encourage her with unhesitating confidence to
betake herself to God for aid. And in our own day he sets before us
these words, in order that no danger or difficulty may prevent us from
calling upon God. When the whole world may conspire together against us,
we have as it were a wall of brass for the defense of Christ’s kingdom
in these words, “Why do the heathen rage?” etc., (<span
id="xviii.ii-p15.1"></span>[Ps
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#001)<span id="xviii.ii-p15.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xviii.ii-p16"></span>It will be in no small degree profitable
to us to contemplate this as an example in which we have represented to
us, as in a mirror what has been the lot of the Church of God from the
beginning. This, if rightly reflected upon, will keep us at the present
day from being unduly dejected when we witness the whole world in array
against us. We see how the Pope has inflamed the whole world against us
with diabolical rage. Hence it is, that in whatever direction we turn
our eyes, we meet with just so many hostile armies to destroy us. But
when we have once arrived at a settled persuasion that no strange thing
happens to us, the contemplation of the condition of the Church in old
time will strengthen us for continuing in the exercise of patience until
God suddenly display his power, which is perfectly able, without any
created aid, to frustrate all the attempts of the world.

<span id="xviii.ii-p17"></span>To remove from the minds of the godly all
misgivings as to whether help is ready to be imparted to them from
heaven, the prophet distinctly affirms that those who molest the Church
are chargeable with making war against God, who has taken her under his
protection. The principle upon which God declares that he will be our
helper is contained in these words,

<span id="xviii.ii-p18"></span>“He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple
of mine eye,”  
(<span id="xviii.ii-p18.2"></span>[Zec
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008)<span id="xviii.ii-p18.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xviii.ii-p19"></span>And what is said in another psalm
concerning the patriarchs, is equally applicable to all true believers,

<span id="xviii.ii-p20"></span>“Touch not mine anointed, and do my
prophets no harm,”  
(<span id="xviii.ii-p20.2"></span>[Ps
105:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#015.md)<span
id="xviii.ii-p20.2"></span>.)

<span id="xviii.ii-p21"></span>He will have the anointing with which he
has anointed us to be, as it were, a buckler to keep us in perfect
safety. The nations here enumerated did not avowedly make war against
him; but as, when he sees his servants unrighteously assaulted, he
interposes himself between them and their enemies to bear the blows
aimed at them, they are here justly represented as *having entered into
a league against God* The case is analogous to that of the Papists in
the present day. If any were to ask them, when they hold consultations
for the express purpose of accomplishing our destruction, Whether they
were stronger than God? they would immediately reply, That they had no
intention whatever of assaulting heaven in imitation of the giants of
old. But God having declared that every injury which is done to us is an
assault upon him, we may, as from a watch-tower, behold in the distance
by the eye of faith the approach of that destruction of which the
votaries of Antichrist shall have at length the sad and melancholy
experience.

<span id="xviii.ii-p22"></span>The expression, *to consult with the
heart,* is by some explained, *to deliberate with the greatest exertion
and earnestness of mind.* Thus it is quite common for us to say, that a
thing is done with the heart which is done with earnestness and ardor of
mind. But this expression is rather intended to denote the hidden crafty
devices complained of a little before.

<span id="xviii.ii-p23"></span>Some interpreters refer *the tents of
Edom* to warlike furniture, and understand the words as meaning, that
these enemies came well equipped and provided with tents for prolonging
the war; but the allusion seems rather to be to the custom which
prevailed among those nations of dwelling in tents. It is, however, a
hyperbolical form of expression; as if it had been said, So great was
their eagerness to engage in this war, that they might be said even to
pluck their tents from the places where they were pitched.

<span id="xviii.ii-p24"></span>I do not intend to enter curiously into a
discussion concerning the respective nations here named, the greater
part of them being familiarly known from the frequency with which they
are spoken of in the sacred Scriptures. When it is said that Assur and
the rest were *an arm to the sons of Lot,* this is evidently an
additional aggravation of the wickedness of the sons of Lot. It would
have been an act of unnatural cruelty for them to have aided foreign
nations against their own kindred. But when they themselves are the
first to sound the trumpet, and when of their own suggestion they invite
the aid of the Assyrians and other nations to destroy their own
brethren, ought not such barbarous inhumanity to call forth the deepest
detestation? Josephus himself records, that the Israelites had passed
through their borders without doing them any harm, sparing their own
blood according to the express command of God. When the Moabites and
Ammonites then knew that their brethren the Jews spared them,
remembering that they were of the same blood, and sprung from one common
parentage, ought they not also to have reciprocated so much kindness on
their part as not to have embarked in any hostile enterprise against
them? But it is, as it were, the destiny of the Church, not only to be
assailed by external enemies, but to suffer far greater trouble at the
hands of false brethren. At the present day, none are more furiously mad
against us than counterfeit Christians.

 <span id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) all their princes. **12.** Who
have said, Let us take in possession for ourselves the habitations of
God.

<span id="xviii.iii-p7"></span> 

<span id="xviii.iii-p8"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p9"></span>**9.** *Do to them as to the Midianites.*
The faithful, having complained of the very grievous oppressions to
which they were subjected, with the view of inducing God the more
readily to succor them, now call to their remembrance the many occasions
on which he had afforded relief to his people, when brought into the
most desperate circumstances. From this, it is an obvious inference,
that God wisely delays his aid to his servants under oppression, that
when they seem to be reduced to the last extremity, he may appear in a
miraculous manner for their succor. The prophet, in this verse, mingles
together two histories. Strict accuracy would have required him to have
said in one connected sentence, *Do to them as to the Midianites at the
brook Kishon.* But he inserts in the middle of this sentence, the
slaughter of Jabin and Sisera. It was, however, of no great importance
to distinguish particularly between the two histories. He considered it
enough for his purpose, to bring to the remembrance of himself and other
pious Jews, the miracles which God in the days of old had so often
wrought in delivering his people. The great object aimed at is to show,
that God, who had so often put his enemies to flight, and rescued his
poor trembling sheep out of the jaws of wolves, was not now without the
power of effecting the same deliverance. The wonderful manner in which
he succoured his people by the hand of Gideon is well known: <span
id="xviii.iii-p9.1"></span>[Judges
6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg006.htm#000.md)<span id="xviii.iii-p9.1"></span> and
7; It might have seemed altogether ridiculous for Gideon to venture to
engage in battle against a very powerful army, with no greater a number
of men of war than three hundred, and these, be it observed, such as had
been in a state of bondage during their whole lives, and whom the mere
look of their lords might have thrown into consternation. And yet, it
came to pass, that the Midianites perished by turning their swords
against each other. The same goodness God displayed in the slaughter of
Sisera and king Jabin, <span id="xviii.iii-p9.2"></span>[Jud
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#013.md)<span id="xviii.iii-p9.2"></span>.
Barak, under the conduct of a woman, Deborah, discomfited them both,
when, with a small handful of soldiers, he intrepidly gave battle to
their mighty host. And Sisera, the general of the army, did not die
bravely on the field of battle, but was smitten by the hand of a woman
after he had retired to some hiding-place. That the faithful may not be
overwhelmed with terror and fall into despair, they seasonably fortify
themselves with these examples of deliverance, by which God had shown
that in himself alone there resides a sufficiency of power to defend his
people, whenever, destitute of the resources of human aid, they should
betake themselves to him. From that astonishing and unwonted mode of
granting deliverance, they came to the conclusion, that he is a
wonderful worker in preserving his Church; in order to encourage
themselves to entertain the fullest confidence, that in his breath alone
they would have sufficient strength to overthrow all their enemies. Nor
is it only in this passage that the slaughter of the Midianites is
related for this purpose. Isaiah also (<span
id="xviii.iii-p9.3"></span>[Isa
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#004)<span id="xviii.iii-p9.3"></span>.md)
introduces it for confirming the truth of the Church’s restitution: “For
thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder,
the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.” When it is stated
that *they became manure for the earth,* the expression may be explained
as meaning, either, first, that their carcases lay rotting upon the
earth; or, secondly, that they were trampled under foot as manure. This
latter exposition is the most appropriate; but I do not reject the
former. The reason why it is said, *They perished at Endor,* it is
somewhat difficult to ascertain. The name, *Endor,* is to be found in
<span id="xviii.iii-p9.4"></span>[Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p9.4"></span>; and it is probable, that the army of king
Jabin was destroyed there.  <span id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) The
opinion entertained by some, that *Endor* is here used as an
appellative, conveying the idea that their discomfiture was open and
visible to the eye, is what I cannot approve.

<span id="xviii.iii-p11"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p12"></span>**12.** *Who have said, Let us take in
possession for ourselves the habitations of God.* These heathen enemies
are again accused of treason against the King of heaven, in seizing upon
his heritage like lawless robbers. They would not, we may be sure, avow
in so many words that it was their intention to commit such a crime; but
as they despised God, who, as they well knew, was worshipped by the
people of Israel, they are here justly charged with the guilt of
endeavoring to dispossess Him of his own inheritance. And, without
doubt, they profanely poured abuse upon the true God, of whose sacred
majesty they entertained the greatest contempt, their minds being
besotted with their own inventions. But even granting that they
abstained from gross blasphemies, yet whatever harassing proceedings are
carried on against the godly redound to the dishonor of God, who has
taken them under his protection. The appellation, *the habitations* or
*mansions of God,* which is applied to Judea, is a form of expression,
containing no small degree of comfort. God has united himself to us,
with the view of having an everlasting residence amongst us, or rather
that he may set as high a value upon his Church, and account it as
precious, as a householder does his possessions which are most valuable,
and yield him a large revenue.

<span id="xviii.iv-p9"></span><span id="xviii.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p10"></span>**13.** *O my God! make them like a
whirling ball.* As the ungodly, when they gird and prepare themselves
for destroying the Church, are usually inflated with intolerable pride,
the inspired bard beseeches God to put them to shame, it being
impossible to abate their pride until they are laid prostrate,
confounded, and shamefully disappointed. When he declares (verse 16)
that, as the result of this, *they will seek the name of God,* he is not
to be understood as speaking of their being brought to true repentance,
or of their genuine conversion. I indeed admit that the first step to
genuine repentance is when men, brought low by affliction, willingly
humble themselves. But what is here meant is nothing more than a forced
and slavish submission like that of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. It is a case
of frequent occurrence for the wicked, when subdued by adversity, to
give glory to God, for a short period. But they are soon again carried
away with a frantic madness, which clearly discovers their hypocrisy,
and brings to light the pride and rebellion which lurked in their
hearts. What the prophet desires is, that the wicked may be compelled by
stripes to acknowledge God, whether they will or no, in order that their
fury, which breaks forth because they escape with impunity, may at least
be kept under restraint. This is more clearly apparent from the 17th
verse, where he distinctly prays that they may be destroyed for ever;
which would not at all correspond with his previous statement, were it
regarded as a prayer for their being brought to repentance. Nor does he
needlessly heap together such a multiplicity of words. He does this
partly because the reprobate, though often chastised, are nevertheless
so incorrigible that ever and anon they are mustering up new strength
and courage; and partly because there is nothing which it is more
difficult to be persuaded of than that such as wallow at ease in great
outward prosperity will soon perish. The cause to which this is to be
attributed is just our not sufficiently apprehending the dreadful
character of the vengeance of God which awaits the oppressors of the
Church.

<span id="xviii.iv-p11"></span><span id="xviii.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p12"></span>**18.** *And let them know that thou art,
thy name Jehovah.* It is not the saving knowledge of God which is here
spoken of, but that acknowledgement of him which his irresistible power
extorts from the wicked. It is not simply said that they will know that
there is a God; but a special kind of knowledge is laid down, it being
intimated that the heathen who before held the true religion in
contempt, would at length perceive that the God who made himself known
in the Law, and who was worshipped in Judea, was the only true God.
Still, however, it must be remembered, that the knowledge spoken of is
only that which is of an evanescent character, having neither root nor
the living juice to nourish it; for the wicked will not submit to God
willingly and cordially, but are drawn by compulsion to yield a
counterfeit obedience, or, being restrained by him, dare not break forth
into open outrage. This, then, is an experimental recognition of God
which penetrates not to the heart, but is extorted from them by force
and necessity. The pronoun <span id="xviii.iv-p12.1"></span>אתה, *atah,
thou,* is emphatic, implying a tacit contrast between the God of Israel
and all the false gods which were the product of men’s invention. The
prayer amounts to this: Lord, make them to know that the idols which
they have fabricated for themselves are no gods, and in fact are
nothing. The despisers of God may indeed shun the light, and at one time
may overcast themselves with clouds, while at another their may plunge
into the deep and thick shades of darkness; but He pursues them, and
draws them forth to the knowledge of himself, which they would fain bury
in ignorance. And as the world indiscriminately and disgracefully
applies his sacred name to its own trifling inventions, this profanation
is corrected when it is added, *thy name Jehovah.* This implies that
*being,* or *really to be,* is in the strict sense applicable to God
alone; for although unbelievers may attempt to tear his glory to pieces,
he continues perfect and unchanged. The contrast of which I have spoken,
must be kept in mind by the reader. A nation has never existed so
barbarous as not to have worshipped some deity; but every country forged
particular gods for itself. And although the Moabites, the Edomites, and
the rest of these nations, admitted that some power and authority
belonged to the God of Israel, yet they conceived that this power and
authority did not extend beyond the boundaries of Judea. Thus the king
of Syria called him, “the God of the hills,” (<span
id="xviii.iv-p12.2"></span>[1Ki
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1020.htm#023.md)<span
id="xviii.iv-p12.2"></span>.) This preposterous and absurd division of
God’s glory, which men make, is disproved by one word, and all the
superstitions which at that time prevailed in the world are overthrown,
when the Prophet attributes to the God of Israel, as well the essence of
Deity as the name; for unless all the idols of the heathen are
completely abolished, he will not obtain, alone and unshared, the name
of Jehovah. Accordingly, it is added, *Thou alone art the Most High over
all the earth;* a statement which is worthy of our most careful
attention. The superstitious commonly think it enough to leave God his
name, that is to say, two or three syllables; and in the meantime they
fritter away his power, as if his majesty were contained in an empty
title. Let us then remember that God does not receive that honor among
men to which he is entitled, if he is not allowed to possess his own
inherent sovereignty, and if his glory is obscured by setting up other
objects against him with antagonist claims.

<span id="xviii.i-p6"></span> Compare the 6th, 7th, and 8th verses of
the psalm with <span id="xviii.i-p6.1"></span>[2 Chr.
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#001.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#010.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#022.md)<span id="xviii.i-p6.1"></span>;
and the 12th verse of the psalm with <span id="xviii.i-p6.2"></span>[2Ch
11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2011.htm#000.md)<span id="xviii.i-p6.2"></span>
verse of that chapter.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[431](cc10017.htm#fr_430.md) <span
id="xviii.i-p6.3"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p7"></span> The name of this Levite was Jahaziel, and
he is expressly said to be a prophet of the race of Asaph, <span
id="xviii.i-p7.1"></span>[2Ch
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2020.htm#014.md)<span id="xviii.i-p7.1"></span>.
It is not unlikely that he is the same with Asaph, the author of this
psalm.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[432](cc10017.htm#fr_431.md) <span
id="xviii.i-p10.2"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p11"></span> The Hebrew word translated *thy hidden
ones*, primarily means a *treasure*, and is so taken in <span
id="xviii.i-p11.1"></span>[Ps
17:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#014.md)<span id="xviii.i-p11.1"></span>.
Accordingly, it is here rendered by Mudge, and French and Skinner, “thy
treasured ones:” that is, thy peculiar people: those whom thou hast
hitherto protected and kept in perfect safety, as in a place of security
and secrecy. The Septuagint reads, <span id="xviii.i-p11.2"></span>κατὰ
τῶν ἁγίων σου, “against thy saints.” The word is also sometimes put for
the sanctuary, as in <span id="xviii.i-p11.3"></span>[Eze
7:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#022.md)<span id="xviii.i-p11.3"></span>.
Some therefore think that the temple, and the treasures contained in it,
are intended.

vertu.” — *Fr*. “Will at length find, to their great shame, that they
were destitute of all power.”

id="xviii.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p3"></span> The Hebrew is <span
id="xviii.ii-p3.1"></span>ברית יכרתו, *berith yichrothu*, “they have cut
a covenant.” The verb is from <span id="xviii.ii-p3.2"></span>כרת,
*carath*, *he cut*, which, with the noun, <span
id="xviii.ii-p3.3"></span>ברית, *berith*, signifies *to strike a
league*, or *to covenant* The phrase owes its origin to the custom which
prevailed, in ancient times, of sacrificing an animal at the forming of
solemn leagues, and dividing the victim in twain, the contracting
parties passing between the two pieces; see volume 2, page 264, note. It
is then affirmed of these combined enemies of the Jews, that *they had
cut the covenant sacrifice*; that they had slain a sacrificial victim,
divided it in twain, and passed between the pieces’ thus mutually
binding themselves to accomplish their hostile purpose.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[435](cc10017.htm#fr_434.md) <span

<span id="xviii.ii-p4"></span> That is, the Edomites, the descendants of

use of tents.

<span id="xviii.ii-p5"></span> The Ishmaelites were the descendants of

<span id="xviii.ii-p7"></span> The Hagarenes or Hagarites were the
posterity of Abraham by Keturah, (who is supposed to have been Hagar,)
whom he married after Sarah’s death. They dwelt on the east of Gilead,
in the vicinity of the Euphrates. In the days of Saul war was made upon
them by the Reubenites, who, after having nearly destroyed them and
expelled them from their country, dwelt in their tents, (<span
id="xviii.ii-p7.1"></span>[1Ch
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/ch1005.htm#010)<span id="xviii.ii-p7.1"></span>..md)
They seem again to have recruited their strength; but where they
afterwards dwelt is not known. “They are probably the same,” says
Cresswell, “as the Saracens.”

<span id="fn_438"></span>[439](cc10017.htm#fr_438.md) <span
id="xviii.ii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p8"></span> Gebal, which signifies a mountain,
denotes, according to some, the Giblites, who inhabited a district on
the Phoenician coast in the neighborhood of Tyre. They were a tribe of
the Aborigines of Canaan, and are mentioned as left by Joshua to be
conquered after his death, (<span id="xviii.ii-p8.1"></span>[Jos
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#005)<span id="xviii.ii-p8.1"></span>..md)
They were of considerable service to Hiram, king of Tyre, in preparing
materials for Solomon’s temple, as we learn from <span
id="xviii.ii-p8.2"></span>[1Ki
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/kg1005.htm#018.md)<span id="xviii.ii-p8.2"></span>,
where the original word for *stone-squarers* is <span
id="xviii.ii-p8.3"></span>הגבלים *haggibelim*, *the Giblites*; and it
would seem from Ezekiel’s speaking of “the ancients of Gebal and the
wise men thereof,” (<span id="xviii.ii-p8.4"></span>[Eze
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#009)<span id="xviii.ii-p8.4"></span>,.md)
that they rose to no small degree of eminence. The ruins of an ancient
city called by the natives Gibyle, situated upon the Mediterranean Sea
between Tripoli and Sidon, are supposed to be those of the chief city of
the Giblites. If so, these ruins attest its ancient grandeur to have
been considerable. Others suppose that Gebal (the Gebalene of the
Romans) was a mountainous district inhabited by the Edomites, and
extending from the Dead Sea southward to Selal or Petra. By the Arabs it
is called Djebal.

<span id="xviii.ii-p9"></span> That is, the Ammonites, the descendants
of Ammon, another of Lot’s sons, by one of his daughters, (<span

<span id="xviii.ii-p10"></span> The Amalekites were a powerful people,
who dwelt also in Arabia Petrea, between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea,
or between Havilah and Shur, (<span id="xviii.ii-p10.1"></span>[1Sa
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#007.md)<span

The history here referred to is the complete defeat of that people by
Gideon, <span id="xviii.iii-p3.2"></span>[Judg.

<span id="xviii.iii-p10"></span> Endor is not mentioned in the account
given of the discomfiture of Jabin’s host, and the slaughter of Sisera,
in <span id="xviii.iii-p10.1"></span>[Jud
4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#000.md)<span id="xviii.iii-p10.1"></span>;
but it appears from <span id="xviii.iii-p10.2"></span>[Jos
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/jos017.htm#011.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p10.2"></span>, which Calvin quotes, to have been a part
of the portion which fell to the tribe of Manasseh. In that passage,
Taanach and Megiddo are mentioned as districts adjoining to Endor. And
in the song of Deborah, the kings of Canaan who fought on the occasion
referred to, against the Israelites, are said to have fought “in Taanach
by the waters of Megiddo,” <span id="xviii.iii-p10.3"></span>[Jud
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/jdg005.htm#019.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p10.3"></span>. This may explain why they are said to have
perished at Endor, which was near the place where Sisera’s army were
destroyed.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[447](cc10017.htm#fr_446.md) <span

<span id="xviii.iv-p3"></span> “<span
id="xviii.iv-p3.1"></span>*Globum*,” — *Lat* “<span
id="xviii.iv-p3.2"></span>*Une boule*,” — *Fr* The word <span
id="xviii.iv-p3.3"></span>גלגל, *galeggal*, thus translated, is
interpreted by Lowth, “any light thing *whirled* by the wind, chaff,
thistle-down, etc.” “<span id="xviii.iv-p3.4"></span>גלגל seems here,”
says Archbishop Secker, “especially on comparing <span
id="xviii.iv-p3.5"></span>[Isa
17:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#013.md)<span id="xviii.iv-p3.5"></span>,
to be not a wheel, but some light matter, which the wind whirls round
and blows away; *chaff*.” In that passage of Isaiah, where the same
Hebrew word occurs, the rendering in our English Bible is “a rolling
thing;” and the marginal reading, “thistle-down.” This verse affords a
striking exhibition of the nothingness of combined nations before the
Almighty. He can make them “like the thistle-down; like the stubble
before the wind.”

<span id="fn_447"></span>[448](cc10017.htm#fr_447.md) <span
id="xviii.iv-p3.6"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p4"></span> The allusion in this verse is to the
fires, either accidental or designed, which frequently occur in hot and
wooded countries, and which spread to a vast extent, devouring all
before them, and continuing their ravages for a long time. Many Eastern
and African travelers describe these formidable and alarming fires from
personal observation; and such descriptions serve to give a more
adequate idea than would otherwise offer itself to an European mind of
the Psalmist’s meaning. This language is an expressive image for wide
and quick destruction.

id="xviii.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p6"></span> “*Pursue them with thy tempest*, is an
evident reference *to the dissipation of the chaff*, and what follows
relates clearly to *the expansion of the flame*.” — Note of Henley, in
*Lowth*’*s Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews*, volume 1, page 277.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[451](cc10017.htm#fr_450.md) <span
id="xviii.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p7"></span> “The construction of the words in the
close of the psalm lies most probably thus, <span
id="xviii.iv-p7.1"></span>וידעו, *and they shall know*, *i* *e*., *it
shall be known* by this means, <span id="xviii.iv-p7.2"></span>כי אתה
שמך יהוה, *thou art thy name Jehovah*, *i* *e*., *that thou art what thy
name Jehovah imports*; and what that is, is expounded in the remainder
of the verse, <span id="xviii.iv-p7.3"></span>לבדך עליון, *thou only the
Most High over all the earth*; that being indeed the meaning of
*Jehovah*, the infinite, eternal, and so the only supreme power over all
the world.” — *Hammond*
