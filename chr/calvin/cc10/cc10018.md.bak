<span id="xix-p1"></span>PSALM 84

<span id="xix-p2"></span>The Psalmist complains that nothing proved to
him a source of greater distress than his being prevented from coming to
the tabernacle, and his being banished from the assembly of the saints,
where God was called upon. And yet he shows, that nothing can withstand
the longing desires of the godly; and that, surmounting all obstacles,
they will be constantly engaged in seeking God, and, so to speak, will
make a way for themselves where there is none.  <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) At length he expresses his desire to
be restored to the tabernacle of God, and again testifies that a day
spent in the tabernacle was in his estimation more to be prized  <span
id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) than to live for a long time in the
society of unbelievers.

<span id="xix-p5"></span>To the chief musician upon Gittith. A Psalm of
 <span id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) the sons of Korah.  <span
id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md)

<span id="xix-p8"></span>The title of this psalm does not bear the name
of David; but as its subject-matter is applicable to him, he was in all
probability its author. Some think that it was composed by the sons of
Korah, for his particular use; but to prove the groundlessness of this
opinion, it is only necessary to advert to this one consideration, that
David in his time was so eminently distinguished by the gift of prophecy
as to be under no necessity of employing the Levites to perform a
service for which he himself was so well qualified. The only difficulty
to our ascribing it to David is, that mention is made of mount Zion, to
which the ark of the covenant was not brought until he was put in
peaceable possession of the kingdom. how after that, he was never
deprived of the liberty of appearing before the ark with others, except
once, and then only for a short time; namely, when he was under the
necessity of betaking himself to flight on account of the rebellion
raised against him by his son Absalom.  <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) The contents of the psalm, however,
indicate, that at the time of its composition, he had been compelled to
wander long in different places as an exile. If we reflect that David
recorded in psalms the persecutions he endured under Saul long after he
was delivered from them, we will not be surprised to find him making
mention of Zion in connection with them. Of the word *Gittith,* I have
already spoken on the eighth psalm.

<span id="xix.i"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p1"></span><span id="xix.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
84:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#001.md)<span id="xix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p2"></span>**1.** How amiable are thy tabernacles, O
Jehovah of Hosts! **2.** My soul longeth, \[or greatly desireth,\] yea,
even fainteth after the courts of Jehovah: my heart and my flesh leap
for joy towards the living God. **3.** The sparrow also hath found a
house for herself, and the swallow  <span
id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) a nest for herself, where she may
place her young ones, O thine altars! Thou Jehovah of Hosts! my King,
and my God. **4.** Blessed are they who dwell in thy house: they will be
ever praising thee. Selah.

<span id="xix.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.i-p5"></span><span id="xix.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p6"></span>**1** *How amiable are thy tabernacles, O
Jehovah of Hosts!* David complains of his being deprived of liberty of
access to the Church of God, there to make a profession of his faith, to
improve in godliness, and to engage in the divine worship. Some would
understand by the *tabernacles of God,* the kingdom of heaven, as if
David mourned over his continuance in this state of earthly pilgrimage;
but they do not sufficiently consider the nature of his present
afflicted circumstances — that he was debarred from the sanctuary. He
knew that God had not in vain appointed the holy assemblies, and that
the godly have need of such helps so long as they are sojourners in this
world. He was also deeply sensible of his own infirmity; nor was he
ignorant how far short he came of approaching the perfection of angels.
He had therefore good ground to lament over his being deprived of those
means, the utility of which is well known to all true believers. His
attention was, no doubt, directed to the proper end for which the
external ritual was appointed; for his character was widely different
from that of hypocrites, who, while they frequent the solemn assemblies
with great pomp, and seem to burn with ardent zeal in serving God, yet
in all this, aim at nothing more than by an ostentatious display of
piety to obtain the credit of having performed their duty towards Him.
David’s mind was far from being occupied with this gross imagination.
The end he had in view in desiring so earnestly to enjoy free access to
the sanctuary was, that he might there worship God with sincerity of
heart, and in a spiritual manner. The opening words are in the form of
an exclamation, which is an indication of ardent affection; and this
state of feeling is expressed still more fully in the second verse.
Hence we learn, that those are sadly deficient in understanding who
carelessly neglect God’s instituted worship, as if they were able to
mount up to heaven by their own unaided efforts.

<span id="xix.i-p7"></span><span id="xix.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p8"></span>I have observed, that in the second verse a
more than ordinary ardor of desire is expressed. The first verb, <span
id="xix.i-p8.1"></span>כספ, *casaph,* signifies *vehemently to desire;*
but not contented with this word, David adds, that *his soul fainteth
after the courts of the Lord,* which is equivalent to our pining away,
when, under the influence of extreme mental emotion, we are in a manner
transported out of ourselves. He speaks only of the *courts* of the
tabernacle, because, not being a priest, it was not lawful for him to go
beyond the outer court. None but the priests, as is well known, were
permitted to enter into the inner sanctuary. In the close of the verse,
he declares, that this longing extended itself even to his body, that
is, it manifested itself in the utterance of the mouth, the languor of
the eyes, and the action of the hands. The reason why he longed so
intensely to have access to the tabernacle was, to enjoy *the living
God;* not that he conceived of God as shut up in so narrow a place as
was the tent of the ark,  <span id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md) but he
was convinced of the need he had of steps, by which to rise up to
heaven, and knew that the visible sanctuary served the purpose of a
ladder, because, by it the minds of the godly were directed and
conducted to the heavenly model. And assuredly, when we consider that
the sluggishness of our flesh hinders us from elevating our minds to the
height of the divine majesty, in vain would God call us to himself, did
he not at the same time, on his part, come down to us; or, did he not at
least, by the interposition of means, stretch out his hand to us, so to
speak, in order to lift us up to himself.

<span id="xix.i-p10"></span><span id="xix.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p11"></span>**3** *The sparrow also hath found a house
for herself, and the swallow a nest for herself.* Some read this verse
as one continuous sentence, conveying the idea that the birds made their
nests near the altars;  <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md) from
which it might the more evidently appear how hard and distressing his
condition was in being kept at a distance from them. This opinion seems
to be supported from the circumstance, that immediately before the
Hebrew word for *altars,* there is the particle <span
id="xix.i-p13.4"></span>את, *eth,* which is commonly joined with the
accusative case. But as it is also sometimes used in exclamations, the
prophet, I have no doubt, breaking off in the middle of his sentence all
at once, exclaims, that nothing would be more grateful to him than to
behold the altar of God. David then, in the first place, with the view
of aggravating the misery of his condition, compares himself with the
sparrows and swallows, showing how hard a case it was for the children
of Abraham to be driven out of the heritage which had been promised
them, whilst the little birds found some place or other for building
their nests. He might sometimes find a comfortable retreat, and might
even dwell among unbelievers with some degree of honor and state; but so
long as he was deprived of liberty of access to the sanctuary, he seemed
to himself to be in a manner banished from the whole world. Undoubtedly,
the proper end which we ought to propose to ourselves in living, is to
be engaged in the service of God. The manner in which he requires us to
serve him is spiritual; but still it is necessary for us to make use of
those external aids which he has wisely appointed for our observance.
This is the reason why David all at once breaks forth into the
exclamation, *O thine altars! thou Jehovah of Hosts!* Some might be
ready to say in reference to his present circumstances, that there were
many retreats in the world, where he might live in safety and repose,
yea, that there were many who would gladly receive him as a guest under
their roof, and that therefore he had no cause to be so greatly
distressed. To this he answers, that he would rather relinquish the
whole world than continue in a state of exclusion from the holy
tabernacle; that he felt no place delightful at a distance from God’s
altars; and, in short, that no dwelling-place was agreeable to him
beyond the limits of the Holy Land. This he would intimate, by the
appellations which he gives to God, *My King, and my God.* In speaking
thus, he gives us to understand that his life was uncomfortable and
embittered, because he was banished from the kingdom of God. “Although
all men,” as if he had said, “should vie with each other in their
eagerness to afford me shelter and entertainment, yet as thou art my
King, what pleasure would it afford me to live in the world, so long as
I am excluded from the territory of the Holy Land? And again, as thou
art my God, for what end do I live but to seek after thee? Now, when
thou castest me off, should I not despise every place of retreat and
shelter which is offered me, however pleasant and delightful it may be
to my flesh?”

<span id="xix.i-p14"></span><span id="xix.i-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p15"></span>**4** *Blessed are they who dwell in thy
house.* Here the Psalmist expresses more distinctly the proper and
legitimate use of the sanctuary; and thus he distinguishes himself from
hypocrites, who are sedulously attentive to the observance of outward
ceremonies, but destitute of genuine heart godliness. David, on the
contrary, testifies, that the true worshippers of God offer to him the
sacrifice of praise, which can never be dissociated from faith. Never
will a man praise God from the heart, unless, relying upon his grace, he
is a partaker of spiritual peace and joy.

<span id="xix.ii"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p1"></span><span id="xix.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
84:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#005.md)<span id="xix.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p2"></span>**5.** Blessed is the man whose strength is
in thee; the ways are in their hearts. **6.** They passing through the
valley of weeping,  <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md) will
together make it a fountain;  <span id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md)
the rain also will cover the cisterns, \[or reservoirs.\]  <span
id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461.md) **7.** They will go from strength to
strength;  <span id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462.md) the God of gods will
be seen in Zion.

<span id="xix.ii-p8"></span> 

<span id="xix.ii-p9"></span><span id="xix.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p10"></span>**5** *Blessed is the man whose strength is
in thee.* David again informs us, that the purpose for which he desired
liberty of access to the sanctuary was, not merely to gratify his eyes
with what was to be seen there, but to make progress in faith. To lean
with the whole heart upon God, is to attain to no ordinary degree of
advancement: and this cannot be attained by any man, unless all his
pride is laid prostrate in the dust, and his heart truly humbled. In
proposing to himself this way of seeking God, David’s object is to
borrow from him by prayer the strength of which he feels himself to be
destitute. The concluding clause of the verse, *the ways are in their
hearts,*  <span id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md) is by some interpreted
as meaning, That those are happy who walk in the way which God has
appointed; for nothing is more injurious to a man than to trust in his
own understanding. It is not improperly said of the law, “This is the
way, walk ye in it,” <span id="xix.ii-p11.1"></span>[Isa
30:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#021.md)<span id="xix.ii-p11.1"></span>.
Whenever then men turn aside, however little it may be, from the divine
law, they go astray, and become entangled in perverse errors. But it is
more appropriate to restrict the clause to the scope of the passage, and
to understand it as implying, that those are happy whose highest
ambition it is to have God as the guide of their life, and who therefore
desire to draw near to him. God, as we have formerly observed, is not
satisfied with mere outward ceremonies. What he desires is, to rule and
keep in subjection to himself all whom he invites to his tabernacle.
Whoever then has learned how great a blessedness it is to rely upon God,
will put forth all the desires and faculties of his mind, that with all
speed he may hasten to Him.

<span id="xix.ii-p12"></span><span id="xix.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p13"></span>**6** *They passing through the valley of
weeping, will together make it a well.* The meaning of the Psalmist is,
that no impediments can prevent the enlightened and courageous
worshippers of God from making conscience of waiting upon the sanctuary.
By this manner of speaking, he confirms the statement which he had
previously made, That nothing is more desirable than to be daily engaged
in the worship of God; showing, as he does, that no difficulties can put
a stop to the ardent longings of the godly, and prevent them from
hastening with alacrity, yea, even though their way should be through
dry and barren deserts, to meet together to solemnise the holy
assemblies. As the Hebrew word <span id="xix.ii-p13.1"></span>הבחא,
*habbacha,* when the final letter is <span id="xix.ii-p13.2"></span>ה,
*he,* signifies *tears,* and when the final letter is <span
id="xix.ii-p13.3"></span>א*, aleph, a mulberry tree,* some here read
*valley of tears,* and others, *valley of the mulberry.* The majority of
interpreters adopt the first reading; but the other opinion is not
destitute of probability.  <span id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md) There
is, however, no doubt, that dry and barren deserts are here to be
understood, in travelling through which, much difficulty and privation
must be endured, particularly from the want of water; drink being of all
other articles the most necessary to persons when travelling. David
intended this as an argument to prove the steadfastness of the godly,
whom the scarcity of water, which often discourages travelers from
prosecuting their journey, will not hinder from hastening to seek God,
though their way should be through sandy and and vales. In these words,
reproof is administered to the slothfulness of those who will not submit
to any inconvenience for the sake of being benefited by the service of
God. They indulge themselves in their own ease and pleasures, and allow
nothing to interfere with these. They will, therefore, provided they are
not required to make any exertion or sacrifice, readily profess
themselves to be the servants of God; but they would not give a hair of
their head, or make the smallest sacrifice, to obtain the liberty of
hearing the gospel preached, and of enjoying the sacraments. This
slothful spirit, as is evident from daily observation, keeps multitudes
fast bound to their nests, so that they cannot bear to forego in any
degree their own ease and convenience. Yea, even in those places where
they are summoned by the sound of the church-bell to public prayers
 <span id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md) to hear the doctrine of
salvation, or to partake of the holy mysteries, we see that some give
themselves to sleep, some think only of gain, some are entangled with
the affairs of the world, and others are engaged in their amusements. It
is therefore not surprising, if those who live at a distance, and who
cannot enjoy these religious services and means of salvation, without
making some sacrifice of their worldly substance, remain lolling at
home. That such may not live secure and self-satisfied in the enjoyment
of outward prosperity, David declares, that those who have true heart
religion, and who sincerely serve God, direct their steps to the
sanctuary of God, not only when the way is easy and cheerful, under the
shade and through delightful paths, but also when they must walk through
rugged and barren deserts; and that they will rather make for themselves
cisterns with immense toil, than be prevented from prosecuting their
journey by reason of the drought of the country.

<span id="xix.ii-p16"></span><span id="xix.ii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p17"></span>**7** *They will go from strength to
strength.* In this verse the same sentiment is repeated. Mount Zion
being the place where, according to the appointment of the law, the holy
assemblies were observed, after the ark of the covenant was removed
thither, it is said, that the people of God will come to Zion in great
numbers, provoking one another to this good work.  <span
id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md) The word <span
id="xix.ii-p18.4"></span>חיל, *chayil,* seldom signifies *a troop,* or
*band of men,* but most commonly *power,* or *strength.* It will
therefore be more in accordance with the ordinary use of the term, to
translate, *They will go from strength to strength;*  <span
id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md) implying, that the saints are
continually acquiring fresh strength for going up to mount Zion, and
continue to prosecute their journey without weariness or fatigue, until
they reach the wished-for place, and behold the countenance of God. If
the word *troop* is preferred, the meaning will be, that not a few only
will come, but numerous companies. The manner in which God manifested
himself to his servants in the temple in old time, we have spoken of
elsewhere, and especially on the 27th psalm, at the 4th and 5th verses.
No visible image of God was there to be seen; but the ark of the
covenant was a symbol of his presence, and genuine worshippers found
from experience, that by this means they were greatly aided in
approaching him.

<span id="xix.iii"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p1"></span><span id="xix.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
84:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#008.md)<span id="xix.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p2"></span>**8.** O Jehovah, God of Hosts! hear my
prayer: O God of Jacob! hearken. Selah. **9.** O God! our shield,
behold; and look upon the face of thy Anointed. **10.** For better is
one day in thy courts than a thousand elsewhere.  <span
id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md) I had rather be a door-keeper in the
house of my God, than dwell in the tents of wickedness. **11.** For
Jehovah God is our sun and shield: Jehovah will give grace and glory: he
will withhold no good thing from those who walk uprightly. O Jehovah of
Hosts! blessed is the man who trusteth in thee.

<span id="xix.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.iii-p5"></span><span id="xix.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p6"></span>**8** *O Jehovah, God of Hosts! hear my
prayer.* David, instead of acting like worldly men, who foolishly and
unprofitably distress and torment themselves by inwardly cherishing
their desires, very wisely directs his wishes and prayers to God. From
this it is also evident, that he was not accustomed to indulge in
ostentatious boasting, as is the case with many hypocrites, who present
to outward appearance a wonderful ardor of zeal, while yet the
omniscient eye of God sees nothing but coldness in their hearts. In the
first place, he supplicates in general, that God would vouchsafe to hear
him. He next anticipates a temptation which might very readily arise
from his being at present apparently cut off from the Church, and wards
it off, by associating and ranking himself with all true believers,
under the protection of God. Had he not been a member of the Church, he
could not have said generally, and as it were in the person of all its
members, *Our shield.* Having made this statement, he uses language
still more expressive of high privilege, adducing the royal anointing
with which God had honored him by the hand of Samuel, <span
id="xix.iii-p6.1"></span>[1Sa
16:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#012.md)<span id="xix.iii-p6.1"></span>.
These words, *Look upon the face of thy anointed,* are very emphatic,
and yet many interpreters pass over them very frigidly. He encourages
himself in the hope of obtaining the favor of God, from the
consideration that he had been anointed king in compliance with a divine
command. Knowing, however, that his kingdom was merely a shadow and type
of something more illustrious, there is no doubt, that in uttering these
words, the object which he aspired after was, to obtain the divine favor
through the intervention of the Mediator of whom he was a type. I am
personally unworthy, as if he had said, that thou shouldest restore me,
but the anointing by which thou hast made me a type of the only Redeemer
will secure this blessing for me. We are thus taught, that the only way
in which God becomes reconciled to us is through the mediation of
Christ, whose presence scatters and dissipates all the dark clouds of
our sins.

<span id="xix.iii-p7"></span><span id="xix.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p8"></span>**10.** *For better is one day in thy
courts than a thousand elsewhere.* Unlike the greater part of mankind,
who desire to live without knowing why, wishing simply that their life
may be prolonged, David here testifies, not only that the end which he
proposed to himself in living was to serve God, but that in addition to
this, he set a higher value on one day which he could spend in the
divine service, than upon a long time passed among the men of the world,
from whose society true religion is banished. It being lawful for none
but the priests to enter into the inner and innermost courts of the
temple, David expressly declares, that provided he were permitted to
have a place at the porch, he would be contented with this humble
station; for the Hebrew word <span id="xix.iii-p8.1"></span>ספ, *saph,*
signifies a *door-post,* or the *threshold of a house.*  <span
id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) The value which he set upon the
sanctuary is presented in a very striking light by the comparison, that
*he* *would prefer having a place at the very doors of the temple, to
his having full possession of the tents of wickedness,* the plain import
of which is, that he would rather be cast into a common and unhonoured
place, provided he were among the people of God, than exalted to the
highest rank of honor among unbelievers. A rare example of godliness
indeed! Many are to be found who desire to occupy a place in the Church,
but such is the sway which ambition has over the minds of men, that very
few are content to continue among the number of the common and
undistinguished class. Almost all are carried away with the frantic
desire of rising to distinction, and can never think of being at ease
until they have attained to some station of eminence.

<span id="xix.iii-p10"></span><span id="xix.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p11"></span>**11.** *Jehovah God is our sun and
shield.* The idea conveyed by the comparison derived from the sun is,
that as the sun by his light vivifies, nourishes, and rejoices the
world, so the benign countenance of God fills with joy the hearts of his
people, or rather, that they neither live nor breathe except in so far
as he shines upon them. By the term *shield* is meant, that our
salvation, which would otherwise be perilled by countless dangers, is in
perfect safety under his protection. The favor of God in communicating
life to us would be far from adequate to the exigencies of our
condition, unless at the same time, in the midst of so many dangers, he
interposed his power as a buckler to defend us. The sentence immediately
succeeding, *he will give grace and glory*, might be viewed as meaning,
that those whom God has distinguished by his grace in this world, will
at length be crowned with everlasting glory in his heavenly kingdom. But
this distinction between grace and glory being, I am afraid, too
refined, it will be preferable to explain the sentence as implying, that
after God has once taken the faithful into his favor, he will advance
them to high honor, and never cease to enrich them with his blessings.
 <span id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) This interpretation is
confirmed by the following clause, *He will withhold no good thing from
those who walk uprightly,* obviously teaching us, that God’s bounty can
never be exhausted, but flows without intermission. We learn from these
words, that whatever excellence may be in us proceeds solely from the
grace of God. They contain, at the same time, this special mark, by
which the genuine worshippers of God may be distinguished from others,
That their life is framed and regulated according to the principles of
strict integrity.

<span id="xix.iii-p13"></span>The exclamation with which David concludes
the psalm, *Blessed is the man who trusteth in thee,* seems to refer to
the season of his banishment. He had previously described the
blessedness of those who dwell in the courts of the Lord, and now he
avows, that although he was for a time deprived of that privilege, he
was far from being altogether miserable, because he was supported by the
best of all consolations, that which arose from beholding from a
distance the grace of God. This is an example well worthy of special
attention. So long as we are deprived of God’s benefits, we must
necessarily groan and be sad in heart. But, that the sense of our
distresses may not overwhelm us, we ought to impress it upon our minds,
that even in the midst of our calamities we do not cease to be happy,
when faith and patience are in exercise.

<span id="xix.i-p3"></span> Bochart supposes <span
id="xix.i-p3.1"></span>דרור, to signify not the *swallow*, but some kind
of wild *dove*; as he observes, that the Æthiopic version renders it the
*ring-dove*, and the Septuagint, Vulgate, Chaldee, Syriac, and other
ancient versions, the *turtle* These last probably render it *turtle*
from the resemblance of the name to <span id="xix.i-p3.2"></span>תור,
*tur*, the common name of that bird. Merrick, in his version, translated
it at first *turtle*, but afterwards substituted the more comprehensive
name of *dove* instead of turtle, at the suggestion of Dr Lowth. “You
have very good authorities for the *turtle*,” says that learned Prelate:
“my objection may be merely an English one. The bird which we know by
that name is of all others the most retired and shyest; and hardly ever
approaches any building, much less makes her nest in any frequented
place. Does not this consideration render it an unfit image for the
Psalmist’s purpose here? The *dove*, which is only a more general name
for the same bird, would not be liable to this objection.” But to remove
that difficulty relating to the turtle, Merrick quotes a passage from
Sir H. Blunt’s Voyage to the Levant, (page 186, ed. 5) in which that
traveler says, that in Turkey, all birds are so tame from not being used
to violence, that he had thrown his coat upon *turtle-doves* in the
highway. “The Hebrew interpreters,” says the Illustrated Commentary upon
the Bible, “believe it is the swallow, and are followed by our version.
The word means *freedom*, *deliverance*, and may be supposed to refer to
the free manner in which the swallow flies. It is only mentioned again,
at least by this name, in <span id="xix.i-p3.3"></span>[Pr
26:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#002.md)<span id="xix.i-p3.3"></span>; and
is there also associated with the *tsippor*, which our version there
renders *bird*, instead of *sparrow* In both texts, the meaning agrees
better with the swallow than the turtle-dove.”

<span id="fn_458"></span>[459](cc10018.htm#fr_458.md) <span
id="xix.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p12"></span> This is the sense given in our English
Bible; to the accuracy of which Dr Adam Clarke objects. “It is very
unlikely,” says he, “that sparrows and swallows, or birds of any kind,
should be permitted to build their nests, and hatch their young, in or
about altars, which were kept in a state of the *greatest purity*, and
where *perpetual fires* were kept for the purpose of sacrifice, burning
incense, etc.” He proposes to read the words beginning at the third
verse and ending with *her young ones*, within a parenthesis, and to
explain the remaining part of the verse as the conclusion of the
sentence commencing at verse 2d; or to read the parenthesis as the close
of verse 3d: “Even the sparrow hath found out a house, and the swallow
(ring-dove) a nest for herself, where she may lay her young; *but I have
no place either of rest or worship*.” But though it cannot be reasonably
supposed that these birds would be permitted to nestle about the altar
itself, before which the priests were continually serving; yet it is not
improbable that they were permitted to construct their nests in the
houses near the altar. “The altar,” says Dr Paxton, “is here by a
synecdoche of a part for the whole, to be understood of the tabernacle,
among the rafters of which, the sparrow and the swallow were allowed to
nestle; or rather for the buildings which surrounded the sacred edifice
where the priests and their assistants had their ordinary residence.” —
*Paxton*’*s Illustrations of Scripture*, volume 2, pages 310, 355. Dr
Morison, after quoting the criticism of Dr Clarke, observes, “I confess
I see a great beauty in adhering to the sense given in the common
version. Though the sparrow and ring-dove are represented as finding a
nest for themselves at the altars of the sanctuary, it does not follow
that the inspired writer intends any thing more than that, while he was
exiled from the house of his God, these familiar birds had a home near
that sacred spot where he had associated his chief joys.” Parkhurst
considers, that a comparison is intended; and that though the particles
of similitude “as” and “so” are not in the Hebrew text, they are to be
understood. And in the Hebrew Scriptures, there are many instances in
which they are omitted, but where it is necessary to supply them to make
an intelligible version. He translates as follows: “Even (as) the
sparrow findeth her house, and the dove her nest, where she hath laid
her young, (so, should I find,) thy altars, O Jehovah of Hosts! my King,
and my God.” According to this exposition, the Psalmist illustrates his
vehement longing after the sacred tabernacle, and God’s public worship,
by the natural affection of birds, and by that joy and delight with
which they return to their brood after they have been absent from them.
(See Parkhurst’s Lexicon on <span id="xix.i-p12.1"></span>דרר,2.)
Walford takes the same view. His version is: —

<span id="xix.i-p13"></span>“As the sparrow findeth a house, and the
swallow a nest,  
Where she may place her offspring,  
So may thy altars be my abode, O Jehovah of Hosts!  
My King, and my God.”

<span id="xix.ii-p5"></span> “Pools or reservoirs of water, as well as
wells, are common in the Eastern deserts: the latter are supplied by
springs, the former by rains, as here noticed: but both are to be found
in considerable numbers in Judea, and are, according to Rauwolff, more
numerous in these countries than springs that lie high; that is, than
fountains and brooks of running water. Some of these have been made for
the use of the people that dwell in the neighborhood; some for
travelers, and especially those that travel for devotion; as for
instance, such as go in pilgrimage to Mecca. The Psalmist appears to
refer to provisions of this sort, made by the devout Israelites in the
way of their progress to Jerusalem.” — *Mant*.

<span id="xix.ii-p6"></span>This last clause has been very variously
rendered. It has been understood by all the versions, in a different
sense from that given to it by Calvin and our English version, which
agrees with him. The Septuagint reads: “The law-giver will give
blessings.” Dr Adam Clarke: “Yea, the instructor is covered, or clothed
with blessings.” “God,” says he, “takes care to give his followers
teachers after his own heart, that shall feed them with knowledge: and
while they are watering the people they are watered themselves.” Mudge
reads: “Even Moreh is clothed with ponds.” He translates the 5th, 6th,
and 7th verses thus: — “How happy the man whose strength is in thee!
that travel the roads with their hearts. In the valley of Baca he maketh
it a fountain; even Moreh is clothed with ponds. They walk from strength
to strength; he appeareth before God in Zion.” His note on these verses
is as follows: — “I join the latter end of the 5th to the first word of
the 6th, (so the Seventy direct, and the sense seems to require,) with a
slight alteration into <span id="xix.ii-p6.1"></span>עברו; the change of
number, I have often observed, is not to be regarded. ‘How happy the man
that feels himself invigorated by thee; that travels the roads that lead
to Jerusalem, with full bent of heart! He goes through the valley of
*Baca* as full of spirit as if it was cheered with a fountain of waters,
and *Moreh*, as if it was filled with delicious ponds.’ (Two desolate
places I suppose, through which the road lay.) ‘He grows lustier as he
walks; he appears before God in Zion.’”

they travel, each of the pious persons here described shall, by the
refreshments administered to them, proceed from one degree of strength

Jerusalem is represented in the New Testament as a type of heaven, I see
nothing irrational in supposing that the inspired writer might, in
describing the ascent to Jerusalem, have in view also that spiritual
progress which leads to the city which is above, the mother of us all.
The words before us are certainly very applicable to the advances made
in this progress, from strength to strength, from one stage of Christian
perfection to another.” — *Merrick*’*s Annotations*.

id="xix.iii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p9"></span> This explanation is adopted by Walford,
who reads, “Jehovah giveth favor and honor.” “The common gloss on these
words,” he observes, “is, that God first bestows grace on earth, and
then glory in heaven. But this is an interpretation of the ear rather
than of the understanding. The writer is evidently speaking of the
present happy consequences of walking uprightly as he immediately says.
The judgment of Calvin agrees with this statement.”

<span id="xix.iii-p12"></span> “It is generally agreed, that the subject
of this psalm is the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity;

foretell a much greater deliverance by the coming of Christ.” —
