<span id="x-p1"></span>PSALM 75

<span id="x-p2"></span>It affords matter of rejoicing and thanksgiving
to the whole Church, to reflect that the world is governed exclusively
according to the will of God, and that she herself is sustained by his
grace and power alone. Encouraged by this consideration, she triumphs
over the proud despisers of God, who, by their infatuated presumption,
are driven headlong into all manner of excess.

<span id="x-p3"></span>To the chief musician. Destroy not. A Psalm of
Asaph. A Song.

<span id="x.i"></span>

<span id="x.i-p1"></span><span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
75:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#001.md)<span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p2"></span>**1.** We will praise thee, O God! we will
praise thee: and  <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) thy name is
near: they will declare \[or recount  <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) \] thy wondrous works. **2.** When I
shall have taken the congregation,  <span
id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) I will judge righteously.  <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) **3.** The earth is dissolved, and all
its inhabitants: I will establish  <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) the pillars of it. **4.** I said to
the fools, Act not foolishly: and to the ungodly, Lift not up the horn.
**5.** Lift not up your horn on high; and speak not with a stiff neck.
**6.** For exaltations come neither from the east, nor from the west,
nor from the wilderness.  <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) **7.**
For God is judge:  <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) he bringeth
low, and he setteth up.

<span id="x.i-p10"></span> 

<span id="x.i-p11"></span><span id="x.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p12"></span>**1.** *We will praise thee, O God!* With
respect to the inscription of this psalm, I have sufficiently spoken
when explaining the 57th psalm. As to the author of it, this is a point,
in the determination of which, I am not inclined to give myself much
trouble. Whoever he was, whether David or some other prophet, he breaks
forth at the very commencement into the language of joy and
thanksgiving: *We will praise thee, O God! we will praise thee.* The
repetition serves the more forcibly to express his strong affection and
his ardent zeal in singing the praises of God. The verbs in the Hebrew
are in the past tense; but the subject of the psalm requires that they
should be translated into the future; which may be done in perfect
consistency with the idiom of the Hebrew language. The inspired writer,
however, may declare that God had been praised among his people for the
benefits which he had bestowed in the times of old, the design being
thereby to induce God to persevere in acting in the same manner, that
thus continuing like himself, he might from time to time afford his
people new matter for celebrating his praises. The change of the person
in the concluding part of the verse has led some interpreters to supply
the relative pronoun <span id="x.i-p12.1"></span>אשר, *asher, who,* as
if the reading were, *O Lord! we will praise thee; and thy name is near
to those who declare thy wondrous works*  <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) But the prophet, I have no doubt, puts
the verb *they will declare,* indefinitely, that is to say, without
determining the person;  <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) and he
has used the copula *and* instead of the causal participle *for,* as is
frequently done. His meaning, then, may be brought out very
appropriately th We will praise thee, O God! for thy name is near; and,
therefore, thy wondrous works shall be declared. He, no doubt, means
that the same persons whom he said would celebrate the praise of God,
would be the publishers of his wonderful works. And, certainly, God, in
displaying his power, opens the mouths of his servants to recount his
works. In short, the design is to intimate that there is just ground for
praising God, who shows himself to be at hand to afford succor to his
people. The *name* of God, as is well known, is taken for *his power;*
and *his presence,* or *nearness,* is judged of by the assistance which
he grants to his people in the time of their need.

<span id="x.i-p15"></span><span id="x.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p16"></span>**2.** *When I shall have taken the
congregation.* The Hebrew verb <span id="x.i-p16.1"></span>יעד, *yaäd,*
signifies *to appoint a place* or *day,* and the noun <span
id="x.i-p16.2"></span>מועד, *moed,* derived from it, which is here used,
signifies both *holy assemblies,* or *a congregation of the faithful
assembled together in the name of the Lord,* and *festival,* or
*appointed solemn days.* As it is certain that God is here introduced as
speaking, either of these senses will agree with the scope of the
passage. It may be viewed as denoting either that having gathered his
people to himself, he will restore to due order matters which were in a
state of distraction and confusion, or else that he will make choice of
a fit time for exercising his judgment. In abandoning his people for a
season to the will of their enemies, he seems to forsake them and to
exercise no care about them; so that they are like a flock of sheep
which is scattered, and wanders hither and thither without a shepherd.
It being his object, then, to convey in these words a promise that he
would remedy such a confused state of things, he very properly commences
with the gathering together of his Church. If any choose rather to
understand the word <span id="x.i-p16.3"></span>מועד, *moed,* as
referring to *time*  <span id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) God is to
be understood as admonishing his people, that it is their bounden duty
to exercise patience until he actually show that the proper time is come
for correcting vices, since he only has the years and days in his own
power, and knows best the fit juncture and moment for performing this
work. The interpretation to which I most incline is, That, to determine
the end and measure of calamities, and the best season of rising up for
the deliverance of his people, — matters, the determination of which men
would willingly claim for themselves, — is reserved by God in his own
hands, and is entirely subject to his own will. At the same time, I am
very well satisfied with the former interpretation, which refers the
passage to the gathering together of the Church. Nor ought it to seem
absurd or harsh that God is here introduced as returning an answer to
the prayers of his people. This graphic representation, by which they
are made to speak in the first verse, while he is introduced as speaking
in the second, is much more forcible than if the prophet had simply
said, that God would at length, and at the determined time, show himself
to be the protector of his Church, and gather her together again when
she should be scattered and rent in pieces. The amount, in short, is,
that although God may not succor his own people immediately, yet he
never forgets them, but only delays until the fit time arrive, the
redress which he has in readiness for them. *To judge righteously,* is
just to restore to a better state matters which are embroiled and
disordered. Thus Paul says,

<span id="x.i-p18"></span>“Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to
recompense tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you who are
troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven
with his mighty angels.” (<span id="x.i-p18.1"></span>[2 Thess.
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007)<span id="x.i-p18.1"></span>.md)

<span id="x.i-p19"></span>God, therefore, declares that it is his office
to set in order and adjust those things which are in confusion, that,
entertaining this expectation, we may be sustained and comforted by
means of it in all our afflictions.

<span id="x.i-p20"></span><span id="x.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p21"></span>**3.** *The earth is dissolved, and all its
inhabitants.* Many commentators are of opinion that these words are
properly applicable to Christ, at whose coming it behoved the earth and
its inhabitants to be shaken. He reigns, as we know, that he may destroy
the old man, and he commences his spiritual kingdom with the destruction
of the flesh; but he conducts his administration in such a manner as
that afterwards there follows the restoration of the new man. Of the
second part of the verse, *I will establish the pillars of it,* they
make the same application, explaining it as if Christ had said, As soon
as I come into the world, the earth with its inhabitants shall melt and
be dissolved; but immediately after I will establish it upon firm and
solid foundations; for my elect ones, renewed by my Spirit, shall no
longer be like grass or withered flowers, but shall have conferred upon
them new and unwonted stability. I do not, however, think that such a
refined interpretation ever entered into the mind of the prophet, whose
words I consider as simply meaning, that although the earth may be
dissolved, God has the props or supports of it in his own hand. This
verse is connected with the preceding; for it confirms the truth that
God in due time will manifest himself to be an impartial and righteous
judge; it being an easy matter for him, although the whole fabric of the
world were fallen into ruins, to rebuild it from its decayed materials.
At the same time, I have no doubt that there is a reference to the
actual state of things in the natural world. The earth occupies the
lowest place in the celestial sphere, and yet instead of having
foundations on which it is supported, is it not rather suspended in the
midst of the air? Besides, since so many waters penetrate and pass
through its veins, would it not be dissolved were it not established by
the secret power of God? While, however, the prophet alludes to the
natural state of the earth, he, nevertheless, rises higher, teaching us,
that were the world even in ruins, it is in the power of God to
re-establish it.

<span id="x.i-p22"></span><span id="x.i-p22.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p23"></span>**4.** *I said to the fools, Act not
foolishly.*  <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) After he has set
the office of God full in his own view and in the view of the faithful,
he now triumphs over all the ungodly, whom he impeaches of madness and
blind rage, the effect of their despising God, which leads them to
indulge to excess in pride and self-gloriation. This holy boasting to
which he gives utterance depends upon the judgment, which in the name of
God he denounced to be at hand; for when the people of God expect that
he is coming to execute judgment, and are persuaded that he will not
long delay his coming, they glory even in the midst of their
oppressions. The madness of the wicked may boil over and swell with
rage, and pour forth floods to overwhelm them; but it is enough for them
to know that their life is protected by the power of God, who can with
the most perfect ease humble all pride, and restrain the most daring and
presumptuous attempts. The faithful here deride and despise whatever the
wicked plot and conspire to execute, and bid them desist from their
madness; and in calling upon them to do this, they intimate that they
are making all this stir and commotion in vain, resembling madmen, who
are drawn hither and thither by their own distempered imaginations. It
is to be observed, that the Psalmist represents pride as the cause or
mother of all rash and audacious enterprises. The reason why men rush
with such recklessness upon unlawful projects most certainly is, that
blinded by pride, they form an undue and exaggerated estimate of their
own power. This being a malady which is not easily eradicated from the
hearts of men, the admonition, *Lift not up your horn on* high  <span
id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) is repeated once and again. They are
next enjoined *not to speak with a fat or a stiff neck;* by which is
meant that they should not speak harshly and injuriously;  <span
id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) for it is usual with proud persons to
erect the neck and raise the head when they pour forth their menaces.
Others translate the words, *Speak not stiffly with your neck;* but the
other translation is the more correct.

<span id="x.i-p27"></span><span id="x.i-p27.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p28"></span>**6.** *For exaltations come neither from the
east nor from the west.*  <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) The
prophet here furnishes an admirable remedy for correcting pride, when he
teaches us that promotion or advancement proceeds not from the earth but
from God alone. That which most frequently blinds the eyes of men is,
their gazing about on the right hand and on the left, and their
gathering together from all quarters riches and other resources, that,
strengthened with these, they may be able to gratify their desires and
lusts. The prophet, therefore, affirms, that in not rising above the
world, they are laboring under a great mistake, since it is God alone
who has the power to exalt and to abase. “This,” it may be said, “seems
to be at variance with common experience, it being the fact, that the
majority of men who attain to the highest degrees of honor, owe their
elevation either to their own policy and underhand dealing, or to
popular favor and partiality, or to other means of an earthly kind. What
is brought forward as the reason of this assertion, *God is judge,*
seems also to be unsatisfactory.” I answer, that although many attain to
exalted stations either by unlawful arts, or by the aid of worldly
instrumentality, yet that does not happen by chance; such persons being
advanced to their elevated position by the secret purpose of God, that
forthwith he may scatter them like refuse or chaff. The prophet does not
simply attribute *judgment* to God. He also defines what kind of
judgment it is, affirming it to consist in this, that, casting down one
man and elevating another to dignity, he orders the affairs of the human
race as seemeth good in his sight. I have stated that the consideration
of this is the means by which haughty spirits are most effectually
humbled; for the reason why worldly men have the daring to attempt
whatever comes into their minds is, because they conceive of God as shut
up in heaven, and think not that they are kept under restraint by his
secret providence. In short, they would divest him of all sovereign
power, that they might find a free and an unimpeded course for the
gratification of their lusts. To teach us then, with all moderation and
humility, to remain contented with our own condition, the Psalmist
clearly defines in what the judgment of God, or the order which he
observes in the government of the world, consists, telling us that it
belongs to him alone to exalt or to abase those of mankind whom he
pleases.

<span id="x.i-p30"></span>From this it follows that all those who,
spreading the wings of their vanity, aspire after any kind of
exaltation, without any regard to or dependence upon God, are chargeable
with robbing him as much as in them lies of his prerogative and power.
This is very apparent, not only from their frantic counsels, but also
from the blasphemous boastings in which they indulge, saying, Who shall
hinder me? What shall withstand me? as if, forsooth! it were not an easy
matter for God, with his nod alone, suddenly to cast a thousand
obstacles in their way, with which to render ineffectual all their
efforts. As worldly men by their fool-hardihood and perverse devices are
chargeable with endeavoring to despoil God of his royal dignity, so
whenever we are dismayed at their threatenings, we are guilty of
wickedly setting limits to the sovereignty and power of God. If,
whenever we hear the wind blowing with any degree of violence,  <span
id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) we are as much frightened as if we
were stricken with a thunderbolt from heaven, such extreme readiness to
be thrown into a state of consternation manifestly shows that we do not
as yet thoroughly understand the nature of that government which God
exercises over the world. We would, no doubt, be ashamed to rob him of
the title of judge; yea, there is almost no individual who would not
shrink with horror at the thought of so great a blasphemy; and yet, when
our natural understanding has extorted from us the confession that he is
the judge and the supreme ruler of the world, we conceive of him as
holding only a kind of inactive sovereignty, which I know not how to
characterise, as if he did not govern mankind by his power and wisdom.
But the man who believes it to be an established principle that God
disposes of all men as seemeth good in his sight, and shapes to every
man his condition in this world, will not stop at earthly means: he will
look above and beyond these to God. The improvement which should be made
of this doctrine is, that the godly should submit themselves wholly to
God, and beware of being lifted up with vain confidence. When they see
the impious waxing proud, let them not hesitate to despise their foolish
and infatuated presumption. Again, although God has in his own hand
sovereign power and authority, so that he can do whatever he pleases,
yet he, is styled *judge,* to teach us that he governs the affairs of
mankind with the most perfect equity. Whence it follows, that every man
who abstains from inflicting injuries and committing deeds of mischief,
may, when he is injured and treated unjustly, betake himself to the
judgment-seat of God.

<span id="x.ii"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p1"></span><span id="x.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
75:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#008.md)<span id="x.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p2"></span>**8.** For in the hand of Jehovah there is a
cup, and the wine is turbid, \[or full of dregs:  <span
id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) \] it is full of mixture, and he shall
pour forth of it: surely they shall wring out the dregs of it, and all
the wicked of the earth shall drink of it. **9.** But I will publish for
ever, and will sing praise to the God of Jacob. **10.** And I will break
all the horns of the wicked: but the horns of the righteous shall be
exalted.

<span id="x.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.ii-p5"></span><span id="x.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p6"></span>**8.** *For in the hand of Jehovah there is a
cup.*  <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) The Psalmist here applies
more directly to the use of the godly that judgment of which he has just
now spoken. He affirms, that the object for which God reigns is, that no
iniquity may remain unpunished; but that when wicked men have broken
through all restraint and abandoned themselves to wickedness, he may
drag them to deserved punishment. From this we again learn what estimate
we ought to form of the providence of God — that we ought to regard it
as exercising its control by an ever-present energy over every part of
our life. It is therefore asserted that God has in his hand a cup with
which to make the wicked drunk. The word <span
id="x.ii-p7.1"></span>חמר, *chamar,* signifies *full of dregs,* and also
*red.* As red wine among the Jews was the strongest and sharpest, we may
suppose that it is here referred to; and the similitude is very
appropriate, which represents God as having in his hand wine of a highly
intoxicating character, with which to make the ungodly drunk even to
death. It is implied, that the swiftness of divine vengeance is
incredible, resembling the rapidity and power with which strong wine
penetrates to the brain, and either produces madness or kindles a fever.
It is on this account said, that the wine in God’s cup is of a red
color; as it is said in <span id="x.ii-p7.2"></span>[Pr
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#031.md)<span id="x.ii-p7.2"></span>,

<span id="x.ii-p8"></span>“Look not upon the wine when it is red in the
cup.”

<span id="x.ii-p9"></span>Nor is it any objection to this that it is
described a little after as *full of mixture.* These two things do not
ill agree with each other; first, that the wicked are suddenly made
drunk with the vengeance of God; and, secondly, that they drink it out
even to the dregs, until they perish. Some give a different explanation
of the term *mixture,* considering, but without any just ground, the
allusion to be to the custom which prevails in warm climates of diluting
wine with water. This expression, *it is full of mixture,* was rather
added to give additional force to the statement of the prophet; his
object being to compare the vehemence and fury of God’s wrath to spiced
wine.  <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) By these figures he
intimates that it will be impossible for the ungodly to escape drinking
the cup which God will put into their hands, and that they will be
compelled to drain it to the last drop.

<span id="x.ii-p11"></span><span id="x.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p12"></span>**9.** and **10.** *But I will publish for
ever.* This conclusion of the psalm evinces the joy which God’s people
felt from having experienced that He was their deliverer in adversity;
for it seems to be their own experience which they engage to publish,
and on account of which they resolve to sing praise to God. Whence also
they gather, that by the divine aid they will overcome all the power of
the reprobate; and that being themselves possessed of righteousness and
equity, they will be sufficiently armed for their own preservation and
defense. The expression, *the horns of the righteous shall be exalted,*
 <span id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) implies, that the children of
God, by a blameless and holy life, acquire greater strength, and more
effectually protect themselves than if it were their endeavor to advance
their own interests by every species of wickedness.

6:13](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#013)<span id="x.i-p25.1"></span>..md) It
has been supposed that the metaphor is taken from the manner in which
horned animals carry themselves when they are in an excited state. A
practice among the Abyssinians, described by Mr Bruce, has been also
adduced as throwing light upon this verse. He observes, that the
governors of the provinces in Abyssinia wear a broad fillet round their
heads, which is tied behind the head. In the middle of this fillet is a
horn, or a conical piece of silver, gilded with gold; and shaped like
our candle-extinguishers. This is called *kirn* or *horn*; and is only
used in reviews or processions after victory. The way in which they
throw back the head when wearing this ornament (lest it should fall
forward) gives a *stiffness* to the position of the head; and this seems
to explain the language of the Psalmist, when he mentions *speaking with
a stiff neck*. Instead of *with a stiff neck*, Parkhurst translates
*with a retorted neck*; observing, that “this is a well-known gesture of
pride, contempt, or disdain.”

<span id="x.ii-p7"></span> “Here there seems to be an allusion to the
*cup of malediction*, as the Jews called that ‘mixed cup of wine’ and
frankincense, which used to be given to condemned criminals before their
execution, in order to take away their senses. So the Chaldee Targum
paraphrases the passage; ‘Because a *cup of malediction* is in the hand
of the Lord, and strong wine full of a mixture of bitterness, to take
away the understanding of the wicked.’” — *Parkhurst* quoted by Mant.

<span id="x.ii-p10"></span> *Mixed wine*, naturally suggests to us the
idea of wine weaker than in its pure state. Accordingly, Green, instead
of “full of mixture,” translates “unmixed,” by which he means wine
unmixed with water. He perceived, what is evident at first sight, that
wine of the strongest quality is intended, and having apparently no idea
of any other mixture than that of water, which would weaken the wine, he
took the liberty of rendering the words, <span
id="x.ii-p10.1"></span>מלא מסך, *male mesech*, by “unmixed.” The Greeks
and Latins, in like manner by “mixed wine,” understood wine diluted and
weakened with water. But the phrase among the Hebrews generally denotes
wine made stronger, by the addition of higher and more powerful
ingredients. In the East, wines are much mixed with drugs of a
stimulating and intoxicating kind; so that commonly when drawn from the
vessels in which they are preserved, they are strained for use. What
remains is the thick sediment of the strong and stimulating ingredients
with which they had been mixed. This the wicked are doomed to drink.
“The introduction of this circumstance,” says Mant, “forms a fine
climax, and carries the idea of God’s indignation to the highest point.”
Some interpreters have explained the passage as meaning that God would
pour out the pure and clear wine for his friends, while he would compel
his enemies to drink the dregs. But the reference is entirely to his
enemies, who were wholly to exhaust this cup of his fury. This, with the
prophets, is a very common image of divine wrath. See volume 2, page
399, note.

<span id="x.ii-p13"></span> “By the *horns* of the wicked is signified
*pride*; by the horns of the righteous, on the other hand, is meant
their power. Basil has remarked, that the horn is more exalted and more
solid than any other part of the body to which it belongs; and that, at
the same time, it supplies ornament to the head, and is also a weapon of
defense. Hence it is put metaphorically both for strength and power, and
also for pride.” — *Cresswell*. Here it is threatened that the power and
honor of the wicked, which had been employed as the instruments of cruel
wrong and oppression, would be destroyed, and their pride effectually
humbled; while the righteous would be exalted to power and dignity.
