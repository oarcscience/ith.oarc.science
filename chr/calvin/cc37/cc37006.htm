<p><a name="vii.i-p2"></A><b>1.</b> And it came to pass when Apollos was at Corinthus, that Paul, having gone through the upper parts, came to Ephesus, and having found certain disciples, he said unto them, <b>2.</b> Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? But they said unto him, Yea, we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. <b>3.</b> And he said unto them, Wherewith were ye then baptized? And they said, With the baptism of John. <b>4.</b> 				  And Paul said, John truly baptized with the baptism of repentance, speaking to the people, that they should believe in Him who should come after him; that is, in Christ Jesus. <b>5.</b> When they heard these things, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. <b>6.</b> And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came upon them; and they spake with tongues, and did prophesy. <b>7.</b> And all the men were about twelve.</p>

<p><a name="vii.i-p5"></A><b>1.</b> Luke showeth here that the Church of Ephesus was not only confirmed and increased by Paul&#8217;s return, but also that there was a miracle wrought there, because the visible graces of the Spirit were given to certain rude and new disciples. Furthermore, it is not known whether they were inhabitants of the city or strangers; neither doth it greatly skill. It is not to be doubted but that they were Jews, because they had received the baptism 			 of John; also, it is to be thought that they dwelt at Ephesus when Paul found them there.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.i-p6"></A><a name="vii.i-p6.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p7"></A><b>2.</b><i> Whether they had received the Holy Ghost.</i> The end of the history doth show that Paul doth not speak in this place of the Spirit of regeneration, but of the special gifts which God gave to divers at the beginning of the gospel, for the common edifying of the Church. But now upon this interrogation of Paul ariseth 			 a question, whether the Spirit were common to all everywhere at that time? For if he were given only to a few, why doth he join him with faith, as if they were so linked together that they could not be separate? Peradventure, they were none of the common sort; or because they were an indifferent number, that is, twelve, Paul demandeth whether they were all without the gifts of the Spirit. Notwithstanding, I think thus, that so many Jews were offered in presence of the Gentiles, not by chance, 			 but by the counsel of God; and that at one time being disciples, that is, of the number of the faithful, who did notwithstanding confess that they were ignorant of the principal glory of the gospel, which was apparent in spiritual gifts, that by them Paul&#8217;s ministry might be beautified and set forth. For it is unlike that Apollos left so few disciples at Ephesus; and he might have taught them better, since that he learned the way of the Lord perfectly of Priscilla and Aquila.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p8"></A>Moreover, I do not doubt but that the brethren of whom Luke spake before were other than these. In sum, when Paul seeth that these men do profess the name of Christ, to the end he may have a more certain trial of their faith, he asketh them whether they have received the Holy Ghost. For it appeareth by Paul himself that this was a sign and token of the grace of God to establish the credit of doctrine; I would know of you whether ye received the 			 Holy Ghost by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith (<a name="vii.i-p8.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002">Ga 3:2</a><a name="vii.i-p8.1"></A>).</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p9"></A><i>We know not whether there be any Holy Ghost.</i> How could it be, that men being Jews heard nothing of the Spirit, concerning which the prophets speak everywhere, and whose commendations and titles are extant in the whole Scripture? Surely we gather by this that Paul did neither speak generally 			 of the Spirit; and that these men, as they were asked, did deny that they knew those visible graces wherewith God had beautified the kingdom of his Son. Therefore, they confess that they know not whether God give such gifts. Therefore, there is in the word <i>Spirit</i> the figure <i>metonymia. </i>And this sense doth that confirm that if they had 			 altogether denied that they knew anything concerning the Spirit of God, Paul would not have passed over with silence such a gross error; yea, an error altogether monstrous. When he demandeth to what end, or how they were baptized, he showeth therewithal, that wheresoever Christ had been soundly and thoroughly preached the visible graces did also appear, that such worship   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">353</FONT></A>
 			  might be common to all churches. Wherefore, no marvel if Paul wonder that the faithful are ignorant of such glory of Christ, which God would have to be apparent everywhere at that time; and a correction immediately, he telleth them that they must not stay in those rudiments which they had learned; because it was John&#8217;s office to prepare disciples for Christ.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.i-p11"></A><a name="vii.i-p11.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p12"></A><b>4.</b><i> John truly</i> Paul&#8217;s admonition tended to this end, that these men being convict of their ignorance might desire to go forward. He saith that John preached of Christ who was to come. Therefore he sent out his disciples,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">354</FONT></A>
 			  that running in the course they might go towards Christ who was not as yet revealed. Wherefore, to the end these men may not flatter themselves, and refuse to go forward, he showeth that they be yet far from the mark. For the feeling of want doth enforce men to desire that which is as yet lacking. The sum cometh to this end, as if Paul had said Before Christ was glorified, this power of his did not appear   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">355</FONT></A>
 			  in the world; when he was ascended into heaven he would have his kingdom to flourish thus. Therefore the graces of the Spirit were much less shed out when John was as yet in the course of his embassage, which do now declare that Christ sitteth at the right hand of his Father forasmuch as he had not as then openly showed himself to be the Redeemer of the world. Therefore know ye that you must go farther forward; because ye be far from the mark. So that he doth 			 plainly show that the faith of the godly who had been taught by John ought to have looked unto Christ who was to come, lest these men should stand still being newly entered, without going any farther.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p15"></A>And even by this also are we taught that the baptism of John was a token of repentance and remission of sins and that our baptism at this day doth not differ any thing from it, save only that Christ is already revealed, and in his death and resurrection our salvation is made perfect: and so baptism was brought unto his [its] effect; because out of that fountain of Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection whereof I have spoken, floweth repentance, and 			 thither is faith referred again that it may thence fet [seek] free righteousness. In sum, Paul showeth plainly that that was the baptism of regeneration and renovation as is ours. And because both purging and newness of life doth flow from Christ alone he saith that it was grounded in his faith, by which words we be also taught, that hereupon dependeth all the force of baptism, that we lay hold upon by faith in Christ whatsoever baptism doth figure; so far off is it, that the outward sign doth 			 derogate from or diminish the grace of Christ any iota.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.i-p16"></A><a name="vii.i-p16.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p17"></A><b>5.</b><i> When they heard these things.</i> Because the men of old had conceived an opinion that the baptism of John and of Christ were diverse, it was no inconvenient   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">356</FONT></A>
 			  thing for them to be baptized again, who were only prepared with the baptism of John. But that that diversity was falsely and wickedly by them believed, it appeareth by this, in that it was a pledge and token of the same adoption, and of the same newness of life, which we have at this day in our baptism; and, therefore, we do not read that Christ did baptize those again who came from John unto him. Moreover, Christ received baptism in his own flesh, that he might 			 couple himself with us by that visible sign, (<a name="vii.i-p18.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015">Mt 3:15</a><a name="vii.i-p18.2"></A>) but if that reigned diversity be admitted, this singular benefit shall fall away and perish, that baptism is common to the Son of God and to us, or that we have all one baptism with him. But this opinion needeth no long refutation, because to the end they may persuade that these two baptisms be diverse, they must needs show first 			 wherein the one differeth from the other; but a most <i>excellent </i>likelihood answereth on both parts, and also the agreement and conformity of the parts,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">357</FONT></A>
 			  which causeth us to confess that it is all one baptism.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p20"></A>Now the question is, whether it were lawful to repeat the same; and furious men in this our age; trusting to this testimony, went about to bring in baptizing again.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">358</FONT></A>
 			 Some take baptism for new institution or instruction, of whose mind I am not, because, as their exposition is too much racked, so it smelleth of a starting-hole  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">359</FONT></A>
 			 .</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p23"></A>Other some deny that baptism was repeated; because they were baptized amiss by some foolish enemy  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">360</FONT></A>
 			 of John. But because their conjecture hath no color; yea, the words of Paul do rather import that they were the true and natural disciples of John, and Luke doth honorably call them disciples of Christ; I do not subscribe to this opinion, and yet deny that the baptism of water was repeated, because the words of Luke import no other thing, save only that they were baptized with the Spirit. First, it is no new thing for the name of baptism to be translated unto the gifts of the Spirit, 			 as we saw in the first and in the eleventh chapters, (<a name="vii.i-p24.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#005">Ac 1:5</a><a name="vii.i-p24.2"></A>, and <a name="vii.i-p24.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#006">Ac 11:6</a><a name="vii.i-p24.3"></A>) where Luke said, that when Christ promised to his apostles to send the Spirit visible, he called it baptism.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p25"></A>Also, that when the Spirit came down upon Cornelius, Peter remembered the words of the Lord, &#8220;Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.&#8221; Again, we see that those visible gifts are spoken of by name in this place, and that the same are given with baptism. And whereas it followeth immediately, that when he had laid his hands upon them, the Spirit came, I take it to be added by way of interpretation; for it is a kind of speaking much used 			 in the Scripture, first to set down a thing briefly, and afterwards to make it more plain. Therefore, that which by reason of brevity was somewhat obscure, doth Luke better express and lay more open, saying, that by laying on of hands the Spirit was given them. If any man object, that when baptism is put for the gifts of the Spirit, it is not taken simply, but having somewhat added to it. I answer, that Luke&#8217;s meaning doth sufficiently appear by the text; and again, that Luke doth allude unto 			 the baptism whereof he spake. And surely if you understand it of the external sign, it shall be an absurd thing that it was given them without using any better doctrine. But and if you take it metaphorically for institution, the speech shall be as yet harsh; and the narration should not agree, that after they were taught the Holy Ghost came down upon them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p26"></A>Furthermore, as I confess that this laying on of hands was a sacrament, so I say that those fell through ignorance who did continually imitate the same. For seeing that all men agree in this, that it was a grace which was to last only for a time, which was showed by that sign, it is a perverse and ridiculous thing to retain the sign since the truth is taken away. There is another respect of baptism and the supper, wherein the Lord doth testify 			 that those gifts are laid open for us, which the Church shall enjoy even until the end of the world. Wherefore we must diligently and wisely distinguish perpetual sacraments from those which last only for a time, lest vain and frivolous visures [semblances] have a place among the sacraments. Whereas the men of old time did use laying on of hands, that they might confirm the profession of faith in those who were grown up,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">361</FONT></A>
 			 I do not mislike it; so that no man think that the grace of the Spirit is annexed to such a ceremony, as doth Jerome against the Luciferians.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.i-p28"></A>But the Papists are worthy of no pardon, who being not content with the ancient rite, durst thrust in rotten and filthy anointing, that it might be not only a confirmation of baptism, but also a more worthy sacrament, whereby they imagine that the faithful are made perfect who were before only half perfect, &#8212; whereby those are armed against the battle, who before had their sins only forgiven them. For they have not been afraid to spew out 			 these horrible blasphemies.</p>  <a name="vii.ii"></A>  		   			  				   				
<p class="TableCaption06"><a name="vii.ii-p1"></A><a name="vii.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008">Acts 19:8-12</a><a name="vii.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="vii.ii-p2"></A><b>8.</b> And going into the synagogue, he spake freely about three months, disputing and persuading concerning the kingdom of God. <b>9.</b> And when some waxed hard-hearted that they could not believe, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, departing from them he did separate the disciples, and disputed daily in the school of one Tyrannus. <b>10.</b> And this he did by the space of two years, so that all which dwelt in Asia heard the 				  word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks. <b>11.</b> And the Lord showed no small miracles by the hands of Paul. <b>12.</b> So that from his body were brought napkins and partlets unto those that were sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits came out of them.</p> 				  			   		    		  
<p><a name="vii.ii-p3"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii-p4"></A><a name="vii.ii-p4.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.ii-p5"></A><b>8.</b><i> Going into the synagogue.</i> By this we gather that Paul began with the company of the godly, who had already given their names to Christ. Secondly, that he came into the synagogue, that he might gather together into one body of the Church the rest of the Jews who knew not Christ as yet, or at least who had not 			 as yet received him. And he saith that Paul behaved himself boldly, that we may know that he was not therefore heard by the space of three months, because he did craftily cover the doctrine of the gospel, or did insinuate himself by certain dark crooks. Luke doth also by and by express some token of boldness, showing that he disputed and persuaded touching the kingdom of God. And we know that by this word is oftentimes noted that restoring which was promised to the fathers, and which was to be 			 fulfilled by the coming of Christ. For seeing that without Christ there is an evil-favored and confused scattering abroad and ruin of all things, the prophets did attribute this not in vain to the Mesas who was to come, that it should come to pass that he should establish the kingdom of God in the world. And now, because this kingdom doth bring us back from falling and sliding back, unto the obedience of God, and maketh us sons of enemies; it consisteth &#8212; First in the free forgiveness of sins, 			 whereby God doth reconcile us to himself, and doth adopt us to be his people: Secondly, in newness of life, whereby he fashioneth and maketh us like to his own image. He saith that he disputed and persuaded, meaning that Paul did so dispute, that he proved that with sound reasons which he did allege; that done, he used the pricks of godly exhortations, whereby he pricked forward his hearers.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_361"><FONT SIZE="1">362</FONT></A>
 			  For no profound disputations   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="#fn_362"><FONT SIZE="1">363</FONT></A>
 			  shall make us obedient to God, unless we be moved with godly admonitions.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii-p8"></A><a name="vii.ii-p8.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.ii-p9"></A><b>9.</b><i> Seeing their hearts were hardened.</i> We do not read that Paul was heard so patiently and so favorably by the Jews at any place as at Ephesus at his first coming. For whereas others raising tumults did drive him away, he was requested by these to tarry longer. Now, after that he had endeavored, by the space of 			 three months, to erect the kingdom of God among them, the ungodliness and stubbornness of many doth show itself. For Luke saith that they were hardened; and surely such is the power of the heavenly doctrine that it doth either make the reprobate mad or else more obstinate; and that not of nature, but accidentally, as they say, because, when they be urged by the truth, their secret poison breaketh out.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.ii-p10"></A>Luke addeth that they spake evil of the way before the people. For the contemners of the gospel   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">364</FONT></A>
 			  do resist that deadlily among others which they will not embrace. And this do they to no other end, save only because they be desirous (if it can be) to have all men partners in their impiety. It is well known that every ordinance is understood by this word <i>way;</i> but here it is referred unto the gospel of Christ. Now, Luke saith that Paul departed from 			 them, and did separate the brethren, by which example we are taught, that when we have experience of desperate and incurable stubbornness, we must lose our labor no longer. Therefore, Paul admonisheth Titus to avoid a man that is an heretic, after once or twice admonition (<a name="vii.ii-p11.2"></A>Titus 3:10). For the word of God is unjustly blasphemed,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">365</FONT></A>
 			  if it be cast to dogs and swine. Also, we must provide for the weak, lest through wicked backbitings and slandering of sound doctrine, their godliness be subverted. Therefore, Paul did separate the disciples, lest the goats should with their stink infect the flock of sheep; secondly, that the pure worshippers of God might make profession freely.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.ii-p13"></A><i>Disputing daily.</i> This place showeth how continual Paul&#8217;s diligence was in teaching; and that they be too churlish and dainty who are straightway weary of learning. For we see how few come daily, who are ready and apt to hear. And though he had a particular care for the household flock which he had gathered as into a sheepfold, yet he 			 doth not suffer strangers to be destitute of his industry; but continuing the course of his disputation, he trieth whether he can find any which are apt to be taught. He calleth it the school of Tyrannus, meaning no such man as had gotten the government of Asia; for the Romans bare rule throughout all Asia, but it is to be thought that the school was built at the charge of one Tyrannus, and given to the city. Therefore, the faithful did use a public place, which bare the name of the builder, 			 where they had their assemblies.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii-p14"></A><a name="vii.ii-p14.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.ii-p15"></A><b>10.</b> <i>All which dwelt.</i> Luke doth not mean that the men of Asia came thither to hear Paul; but that the smell [savor] of his preaching went throughout all Asia, and that the seed was sown far and wide; so that his labor was fruitful not 			 only to one city, but also to places which were far off; and that cometh to pass oftentimes, that when the truth of God is preached in one place, it soundeth where the voice of the minister cannot sound, being spread abroad far and wide; because it is delivered from hand to hand, and one doth teach another. For one man were not sufficient, unless every man were for himself diligent to spread abroad the faith.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.ii-p16"></A><a name="vii.ii-p16.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.ii-p17"></A><b>11.</b><i> No small miracles.</i> He calleth miracles <i>virtutes </i>or <i>powers, </i>after the common custom of the Scripture, which were testimonies of the extraordinary power of God. And showeth that Paul&#8217;s apostleship was set forth 			 with these ensigns, that his doctrine might have the greater authority. For it is a common speech, That wonders and signs are showed by the hand of men. So that the praise thereof is ascribed to God alone as to the author; and man is only the minister. And that he may the more amplify the miracles, he saith that handkerchiefs and partlets   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_365"><FONT SIZE="1">366</FONT></A>
 			  were brought unto the sick, which so soon as they touched they were healed. It is not unknown   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">367</FONT></A>
 			  to what end Paul had such power given him, to wit, that he might prove himself to be a true apostle of Christ, that he might make the gospel to be believed, and might confirm his ministry. And here it is expedient to call to mind those things which we had before, touching the lawful use of miracles. And whereas God did heal the sick with Paul&#8217;s handkerchiefs, it tended to that end, that even those who had never seen the man might, notwithstanding, reverently embrace 			 his doctrine, though he himself were absent. For which cause the Papists are more blockish, who wrest this place unto their relics; as if Paul sent his handkerchiefs that men might worship them and kiss them   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_367"></A><A HREF="#fn_367"><FONT SIZE="1">368</FONT></A>
 			  in honor of them; as in Papistry, they worship Francis&#8217; shoes and mantle, Rose&#8217;s girdle, Saint Margaret&#8217;s comb, and such like trifles. Yea, rather, he did choose most simple   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">369</FONT></A>
 			  things, lest any superstition should arise by reason of the price or pomp. For he was fully determined to keep Christ&#8217;s glory sound and undiminished.</p>  <a name="vii.iii"></A>

<p><a name="vii.iii-p5"></A><b>13.</b> To the end it may more plainly appear that the apostleship of Paul was confirmed by those miracles whereof mention was made of late, Luke doth now teach that when certain did falsely pretend the name of Christ, such abuse was most sharply punished. Whereby we gather that such miracles were wrought by the hand of Paul, to no other end, save only that all men might know that he did faithfully preach Christ to be the power of God; 			 forasmuch as the Lord did not only not suffer them to be separate from the pure doctrine of the gospel; but did so sharply punish those who did draw them preposterously unto their enchantments; whence we gather again, that whatsoever miracles do darken the name of Christ they be juggling casts of the devil; and that those be coziness and falsifiers who draw the true miracles of God to any other end, save only that true religion may be established.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">370</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p7"></A><i>Certain exorcists.</i> I do not doubt but that this office did proceed of foolish emulation. God was wont to exercise his power diverse ways among the Jews; and he had used the prophets in times past as ministers to drive away devils; under color hereof they invented conjuration,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">371</FONT></A>
 			  and hereupon was erected unadvisedly an extraordinary function without the commandment of God. Also, it may be that (God appointing it so to be) it did somewhat;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">372</FONT></A>
 			  not that he favored it preposterously, but that they might more willingly retain the religion of their fathers, until the coming of Christ. Under the reign of Christ, wicked ambition caused strife between the Christians and the Jews. For exorcists were made after the will of men; after that (as superstition doth always wax worse and worse) the Pope would have this common to all his clerks, who were to be promoted unto an higher degree. For after that they be made 			 door-keepers, forthwith the conjuring of devils is committed to them; and by very experience they set themselves to be laughed at. For they are enforced to confess that they give a vain title, and such as is without effect, for where is the power they have to conjure devils? and the very exorcists themselves do take upon them, to their own reproach, an office which they never put in practice. But this falleth out justly, that. there is no end of erring, when men depart from the word of God. As 			 touching these men, we gather that they were wandering rogues, and such as went from door to door, of which sort we see many at this day in Popery; for he saith that they went about. By which words he giveth us to understand, that they went to and fro as occasion was offered them to deceive men.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p10"></A><i>We adjure you by Jesus.</i> It is a thing like to be true, [probable] that these deceivers flee unto the name of Christ, that they might get new power, whereof they had falsely boasted before, or because the power which they had did cease, that they might darken the gospel. This invocation had two faults; for whereas they were enemies 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">373</FONT></A>
 			  to Paul&#8217;s doctrine, they abuse the color thereof without faith, as it were, unto magical enchantments; secondly, they take to themselves without the calling of God that which is not in man&#8217;s hand. But the lawful calling upon the name of God and Christ is that which is directed by faith, and doth not pass the bounds of a man&#8217;s calling. Wherefore, we are taught by this example, that we must attempt nothing, unless we have the light of the word of God going before us, 			 lest we suffer like punishment for our sacrilege. The Lord himself commandeth us to pray. Whosoever they be which have not the gift of miracles given them, let them keep themselves within these bounds. For when the apostles made the unclean spirits come out of men, they had God for their author, and they knew that they did faithfully execute the ministry which he had enjoined them.</p>

 			  a contrariety between the Spirit of God and the spirit of Satan.

<p><a name="vii.iii-p15"></A>Furthermore, God meant to show such a token, that he might declare that his power is not included in the sound of the voice, and that it is not lawful superstitiously to abuse the name of his Son. And when he suffereth Satan to deceive us, let us know that we be more sharply punished than if he should wound us in the flesh.

For, besides that God doth invite us by all his judgments to come thus far, that they may terrify us from sinning, in this example peculiarly was the majesty of Christ set forth, and the authority of the gospel established.

For they did indeed declare that they were thoroughly touched and moved with the fear of God, who, of their own accord, did confess the faults and offenses of their former life, lest, through their dissimulation, they should 			 nourish the wrath of God within. We know what a hard matter it is to wring true confession out of those who have offended, for seeing men count nothing more precious than their estimation, they make more account of shame than of truth; yea, so much as in them lieth, they seek to cover their shame. Therefore, this voluntary confession was a testimony of repentance and of fear. For no man, unless he be thoroughly touched, will make himself subject to the slanders and reproaches of men, and will 			 willingly be judged upon earth, that he may be loosed and acquitted in heaven. When he saith, <i>Many, </i>by this we gather that they had not all one cause, for it may be that these men had corrupt consciences a long time; as many are oftentimes infected with hidden and inward vices. Wherefore, Luke doth not prescribe all men a common law; but he setteth before them an example which those must follow who need like medicine. For why did these men 			 confess their facts, save only that they might give testimony of their repentance, and seek counsel and ease at Paul&#8217;s hands? It was otherwise with those who came unto the baptism of John, confessing their sins (<a name="vii.iv-p5.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006">Mt 3:6</a><a name="vii.iv-p5.1"></A>).

<p><a name="vii.iv-p6"></A>But in this place Luke teacheth by one kind, after what sort the faithful were touched with the reverence of God, when God set before them an example of his severity. For which cause the impudence of the Papists is the greater, who color their tyranny by this fact. For wherein doth their auricular confession agree  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_374"></A><A HREF="#fn_374"><FONT SIZE="1">375</FONT></A>
 			 with this example? First, the faithful confessed how miserably they had been deceived by Satan before they came to the faith, bringing into the sight of men certain examples. But by the Pope&#8217;s law it is required that men reckon up all their words and deeds and thoughts. We read that those men confessed this once; the Pope&#8217;s law commandeth that it be repeated every year at least. These men made confession of their own accord; the Pope bindeth all men with necessity. Luke saith there 			 came many, not all; in the Pope&#8217;s law there is no exception. These men humbled themselves before the company of the faithful; the Pope giveth a far other commandment, that the sinner confess his sins, whispering in the ear of one priest.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_375"></A><A HREF="#fn_375"><FONT SIZE="1">376</FONT></A>

He did hope when he did address himself for his journey, that the Church would be quiet after his departure, and, lo, there ariseth an uproar at a sudden where he did least fear. But in Demetrius it appeareth what a hurtful plague covetousness is. For one man, for his own gain&#8217;s sake, is not afraid   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_382"></A><A HREF="#fn_382"><FONT SIZE="1">383</FONT></A>
 			  to trouble a whole city with sedition. And the craftsmen, who were as firebrands kindled by him, and do spread abroad the fire everywhere, do teach us what an easy matter it is to cause filthy [sordid] men, and whose belly is their God, to commit all manner [of] wickedness; especially if they live only by gains evil gotten,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_383"></A><A HREF="#fn_383"><FONT SIZE="1">384</FONT></A>
 			  and the hope of gain be taken from them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.v-p9"></A>Moreover, in his history we see a lively image of our time. Demetrius and his band raised a tumult; because, if superstition whereby they were wont to get gains be taken away, their craft will fall to the ground. Therefore they fight as if it were for their life, lest Demetrius go without his fat prey, and the rest want their daily living. What zeal doth at this day prick forward the Pope, the horned bishops, the monks, and all the rabblement 			 of the Popish clergy? Yea, what fury doth drive them so sore  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_384"></A><A HREF="#fn_384"><FONT SIZE="1">385</FONT></A>
 			 to resist the gospel? They boast that they strive for the Catholic faith; neither did Demetrius want an honest color, pretending the worship of Diana. But the matter itself doth plainly declare that they fight not so much for the altars as for the fires, to wit, that they may have hot kitchens. They can well wink at filthy blasphemies against God, so they lack nothing of their revenues, only they are more than courageous in maintaining such superstitions as are meetest for 			 their purpose.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_385"></A><A HREF="#fn_385"><FONT SIZE="1">386</FONT></A>

 			 a provoke us to enter a wicked and ungodly combat. And as for those who, through ignorance or error, are fallen unto any ungodly occupation, or are entangled in any other impure and wicked kind of life, let them, notwithstanding, beware of such sacrilegious rashness. And as touching godly teachers, let them learn by this example, that they shall never want adversaries, until the whole world, through denial of itself, offer peace, which we know will never come to pass. Because Paul&#8217;s 			 doctrine taketh away Demetrius and the rest of the silversmiths&#8217; gains, they leap out furiously to put out [destroy] the same, will not they do the same whom the gospel shall contrary? But there is no man who hath not occasion to fight. For all the affections of the flesh are enemies to God. So that it must needs be, that how many lusts of the flesh there be [reign] in the world, there are as many armed enemies to resist Christ. It will, indeed, oftentimes fall out, that God will bridle the 			 wicked, lest they raise some tumult, or break out into open rage. Yet, whosoever is not tamed and brought down to bear Christ&#8217;s yoke, he shall always hate his gospel. So that faithful and godly teachers must persuade themselves that they shall always have to deal with great store of enemies. Demetrius&#8217; covetousness is manifest. Nevertheless, we must also know this, that he was Satan&#8217;s fan, [bellows] who, seeking by all means to overthrow Paul&#8217;s doctrine, found this fit instrument. Now, 			 forasmuch as we know that Satan is a deadly enemy to Christ and the truth, do we think that he shall ever want ministers, who shall rage through his motion and persuasion, either with open rage, or else seek to work the overthrow of the gospel by secret practices, or spew out the poison of their hatred, or else, at least, show some token of enmity by fretting and murmuring?</p>

He doth not inquire whether this be true or no; but being blinded with a desire to get gain, he is carried headlong to oppress true doctrine. The same 			 blindness doth drive him headlong to seek violent remedies. Also the craftsmen, because they be afraid of poverty and hunger, run headlong as violently; for the belly is blind and deaf, so that it can admit no equity. For which cause, every one of us ought more to suspect himself, when the question is touching our own gain and profit, lest the same covetous desire which made these men so mad take away all difference of justice and injustice, of that which is filthy and that which is 			 honest.</p>

What is the cause, then, he is so diligent and so earnest in his business? even this, because he was plagued at home; 			 and because he saw that he and his copartners had no honest or probable cause to make any stir, he goeth about to color [gloss] the matter with some other color. Therefore, to the end he may cover the shame of his wicked fact, he cloaketh it with the title of religion, which is plausible.

Furthermore, we see that though sedition be confused, yet doth the people always take the worse part; as the men of Ephesus do now catch Gains and Aristarchus, and they drive back Alexander with their furious outcries. Whence cometh this, save only because Satan doth reign in their hearts, so that they rather favor an 			 evil cause? There is also another reason, because a prejudice conceived upon a false report doth possess their minds, so that they cannot abide to sift the cause any farther.</p>

When as he might well have kept himself out of sight, of his own accord was he prepared to put himself in hazard. And yet he doth not refuse to follow their counsel, who knew the state of matters better than he. If he had not 			 been kept back, that which he determined to do could not have been imputed to rashness. There was no sedition raised through his fault. Why should he not venture his life, especially seeing that he did not despair of better success? But when the brethren, and such friends as were more skillful, dissuade him, his modesty is worthy to be commended, in that he doth not stand stoutly in his purpose.</p>

Nevertheless, the name Jew made him to be so hated, that they did outrageously refuse 			 whatsoever he was about to speak in the matter and cause; yea, he did hardly escape with his life in such an uproar. Moreover, it is uncertain whether this be that Alexander of whom Paul maketh mention elsewhere, (<a name="vii.vi-p12.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020">1Ti 1:20</a><a name="vii.vi-p12.1"></A>; and <a name="vii.vi-p12.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014">2Ti 4:14</a><a name="vii.vi-p12.2"></A>) yet the conjecture 			 seemeth to me allowable.

It 			 fareth otherwise with true godliness, that we believe with the heart unto righteousness, and then doth the confession of the mouth follow to salvation. Therein doth the distemperature and mad stubbornness of all mad men and brain-sick fools differ from the constancy and zeal of the martyrs.

<p><a name="vii.vii-p6"></A><b>35.</b> Luke showeth in this place that the tumult was so appeased, that yet, notwithstanding, superstition prevailed with the mad people, and the truth of God was not heard. For the town-clerk, as politic men use to do, counteth it sufficient for him if he can by any means appease the outrageous multitude. Nevertheless, the cause itself is oppressed. He saw undoubtedly Demetrius&#8217; malice, and how he had troubled the city, abusing the 			 pretense of religion for his own private gain; but he toucheth not that wound which he knew to be unknown to the unskillful. Nevertheless, to the end he may stay the uproar and contention, he extolleth the reigned power of Diana, and maintaineth her superstitious worship. If Paul had been in the common place  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_397"></A><A HREF="#fn_397"><FONT SIZE="1">398</FONT></A>
 			 at that time, he would rather have suffered death an hundred times than have suffered himself to be delivered from danger paying so dear for it. For though the town-clerk had not been by him commanded to speak thus, yet it should have been treacherous dissimulation in a public witness and preacher of heavenly doctrine. The scribe affirmeth that the image which the Ephesians did worship came down from heaven, and that Paul and his companions spake no blasphemy against their goddess. 			 Could he have holden his peace, but he must needs by his silence have allowed his false excuse? And this had been to shake hands with idolatry. Therefore, it was not without cause that Luke said before that Paul was kept back by the brethren, and not suffered to enter into the common place [theater].</p>

But the wisdom of the town-clerk, and that carnal, is here commended, and not his godliness.

And that public affairs must be handled in a lawful, and not in a disordered assembly &#8212; in an assembly gathered by the 			 commandment of the magistrates, and not in a concourse which is without consideration, run together through the motion of one man, and to satisfy his appetite.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_398"></A><A HREF="#fn_398"><FONT SIZE="1">399</FONT></A>
