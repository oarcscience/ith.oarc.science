<span id="x-p1"></span>Chapter 22

<span id="x.i"></span>

<span id="x.i-p1"></span><span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>[Acts
22:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#001.md)<span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p2"></span>**1.** Men, brethren, and fathers, hear mine
excuse which I make now before you. **2.** And when they heard that he
spake to them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more silence: And he
said, **3.** I truly am a man, a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city of Cilicia,
and brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught
according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was
zealous toward God, as ye all are this day. **4.** And I persecuted this
way unto death, binding and delivering into prison both men and women.
**5.** As the chief priest doth bear me witness, and all the older of
elders, of whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to
Damascus, to bring them which were there bound to Jerusalem, that they
might be punished.

<span id="x.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="x.i-p4"></span><span id="x.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p5"></span>Though we may guess by the beginning of this
speech what was Paul’s drift, yet because he was interrupted, we know
not certainly what he was about to say. The sum of that part which is
refitted is this, that forasmuch as he was well and faithfully
instructed in the doctrine of the law, he was a godly and religious
worshipper of God in the sight of the world. Secondly, that he was an
enemy to the gospel of Christ, so that he was counted among the priests
one of the principal maintainers and defenders of the law. Thirdly, that
he did not change his sect unadvisedly; but that being tamed and convict
by an oracle from heaven, he gave his name to Christ. Fourthly, that he
did not embrace unknown things, but that God appointed him a faithful
teacher, of whom he learned all things perfectly. Lastly, that when he
was returned to Jerusalem, and sought to do good to his countrymen, God
did not permit him. So that he brought not the doctrine of salvation
unto foreign nations without good consideration, or because he hated his
own nation, but being commanded by God so to do.

<span id="x.i-p6"></span>**1.** *Men, brethren, and fathers.* It is a
wonder that he giveth so great honor yet to the desperate enemies of the
gospel, for they had broken all bond of brotherly fellowship, and by
oppressing the glory of God, had spoiled themselves of all titles of
dignity. But because Paul speaketh in this place as some one of the
people, he speaketh so lovingly unto the body itself, and useth towards
the heads words honorable without dissembling. And surely because their
casting off was not made known as yet, though they were unworthy of any
honor, yet it was meet that Paul should reverently acknowledge in them
the grace of God’s adoption. Therefore, in that he calleth them brethren
and fathers, he doth not so much regard what they have deserved, as into
what degree of honor God had exalted them. And all his oration is so
framed that he goeth about to satisfy them, freely indeed, and without
flattering, yet humbly and meekly. Therefore, let us learn so to
reverence and honor men that we impair not God’s right. For which cause
the pope’s pride is the more detestable, who, seeing he hath made
himself an high priest without the commandment of God and the consent of
the Church, doth not only challenge to himself all titles of honor, but
also such tyranny, that he goeth about to bring Christ in subjection; as
if when God doth exalt men he did resign up his right and authority to
them, and did stoop down to them.

<span id="x.i-p7"></span><span id="x.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p8"></span>**2.** *That he spake Hebrew.* This is indeed
an usual thing, that when men which speak diverse languages are
together, we hear those more willingly who speak our own language; but
the Jews were moved with another peculiar cause, because they imagined
that Paul was offended  <span id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) with his
own kindred, so that he did even hate their tongue, or that he was some
rogue which had not so much as learned the speech of that nation whereof
he said he came. Now, so soon as they heard their own language, they
began to have some better hope. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether
Paul spake in the Hebrew or in the Syrian tongue; for we know that the
speech of the Jews was corrupt and degenerate after their exile,
forasmuch as they had much from the Chaldeans and Syrians. For mine own
part, I think, that because he spake as well to the common sort as unto
the elders, he used the common speech which was at that day usual.

<span id="x.i-p10"></span><span id="x.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p11"></span>**3.** *I am a Jew.* As all things were out of
order at that day among the Jews, many rogues and vagabonds, to the end
they might have some shroud for their wickedness, did falsely boast that
they were Jews. Therefore, to the end Paul may acquit himself of this
suspicion, he beginneth at his birth; that done, he declareth that he
was known in Jerusalem, because he was brought up there of \[from\] a
child; though this latter thing seemeth to be spoken not only for
certainty’s sake, but because it skilled much that this should also be
known how well he had been instructed.

<span id="x.i-p12"></span>There is nothing more bold to cause trouble
than unlearned men. And at that day the government of the Church was so
decayed, that religion was not only subject to sects, but also miserably
mangled and torn in pieces. Therefore, Paul nameth his master, lest any
man may think that he had not been nousled up in learning,  <span
id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) and therefore had he forsaken the
worship of the fathers; as many men, who are not trained up in learning,
forget their nature and grow out of kind.  <span
id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) But Paul saith chiefly that he was
well taught in the law, that the Jews may understand that it was not
through ignorance (as it falleth out oftentimes) that he causeth such
ado, and doth counterfeit their monsters.

<span id="x.i-p15"></span>It is to be doubted whether this be that
Gamaliel of whom mention is made before, (<span
id="x.i-p15.1"></span>[Ac 5:34](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#034.md)<span
id="x.i-p15.1"></span>). Scholars are said to sit at their masters’
feet, because forasmuch as they be not as­ yet of strong and sound
judgment, they must bring such modesty and aptness to be taught, that
they must make all their senses subject to their masters, and must
depend upon their mouth. So Mary is said to sit at Jesus’ feet (<span
id="x.i-p15.2"></span>[Lu 10:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#039.md)<span
id="x.i-p15.2"></span>) when she giveth ear to his doctrine. But and if
such reverence be due to earthly masters, how much more ought we to
prostrate ourselves before the feet of Christ, that we may give ear to
him when he teacheth us out of his heavenly throne? This speech doth
also put boys and young men in remembrance of their duty, that they be
not stout nor stubborn, or that they be not puffed nor lifted up against
their masters through some foolish confidence, but that they suffer
themselves quietly and gently to be framed by them.

<span id="x.i-p16"></span>*Taught in the law of the fathers.* The old
interpreter doth translate it word for word, taught *according to the
truth of the fathers’ law,* saving that <span
id="x.i-p16.1"></span>ἀκρίβεια is rather a *perfect way*  <span
id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md) than *truth.* Notwithstanding the
question is, What he meaneth by this perfect way, seeing all of them had
one and the same form of the law? He seemeth to me to distinguish that
purer form of knowledge wherein he had been trained up from the common
instruction, which did more disagree with the true and natural meaning
of the law. And although the law of the Lord was then corrupt by many
additions, even among the best doctors, yet because religion was
altogether there corrupt among many, Paul doth for good causes boast,
that he was both well and also diligently instructed in the law of the
fathers; or (which is all one) exactly or perfectly, lest any man should
think that he had gotten only some small smattering, as if he were one
of the common sort.

<span id="x.i-p18"></span>But because many who are well taught are,
notwithstanding, full stuffed with Epicurish contempt of God, he
declareth that he was zealous toward God; as if he should say, that the
serious study of godliness was annexed to doctrine, so that he meant not
to daily in holy things, as profane men do of set purpose confound all
things.

<span id="x.i-p19"></span>But because this his zeal was altogether rash,
he maketh himself like to the other Jews for that time. Notwithstanding,
this may be taken in good part, that he did long ago no less worship God
from his heart than they did then.

<span id="x.i-p20"></span><span id="x.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p21"></span>**4.** *I persecuted this way.* This is the
second point, that he was an enemy to Christ’s doctrine, and that he was
more fervent in resisting the same than all the rest, until he was
pulled back by the hand of God; which thing he saith the chief priests
and elders can testify. Therefore, there can be no suspicion in such a
sudden change. Whereas he saith, that he had letters given him to
deliver to the brethren, it must be referred unto the Jews, as if he had
called them his countrymen; but he meant to appease them with a more
honorable title. For this is Paul’s drift, that he may declare his
natural and lawful beginning which he took of that nation;  <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) and also how desirous he was to be
linked with them in friendship.

<span id="x.ii"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p1"></span><span id="x.ii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
22:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#006.md)<span id="x.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p2"></span>**6.** And it happened that as I journeyed and
drew near to Damascus about noon, that suddenly a great light shone
round about me from heaven. **7.** And I fell to the ground, and heard a
voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? **8.** And I
answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth,
whom thou persecutest. **9.** And they which were with me saw indeed the
light, and were afraid: but they heard not the voice of him which talked
with me. **10.** Then I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said
to me, Arise, and go to Damascus; and there it shall be told thee what
things be ordained for thee to do. **11.** And when I saw not by reason
of the glory of the light, being led by the hand by those companions
which were with me, I came to Damascus.

<span id="x.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="x.ii-p4"></span><span id="x.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p5"></span>**6.** *And it happened.* Because this history
was expounded more at large in the ninth chapter, I will only briefly
touch those things which were there spoken. But this is peculiar to this
present place, that Paul reckoneth up his circumstances, that by them he
may prove that he was converted by God. And this is the third member of
the sermon; otherwise this change should have been thought to have
proceeded of inconstancy, or rashness, or else it should not have been
void of some infamy. For nothing is more intolerable than to start aside
from the course of godliness which men have once entered; and also not
to do that which they are commanded to do. Therefore, lest any man might
suspect Paul’s conversion, he proveth by many miracles which he bringeth
to light, that God was the author thereof. In the night-season there
appear oftentimes lightnings, which come of the hot exhalations of the
earth; but this was more strange, that about noon a sudden light did not
only appear, but did also compass him about like a lightning, so that
through fear thereof he fell from his horse, and lay prostrate upon the
ground. Another miracle, in that he heard a voice from heaven; another,
in that his companions heard it not as well as he. Also, there follow
other things, that, after that he was sent to Damascus, the event is
correspondent to the oracle; because Ananias cometh to meet him. Also,
in that his sight is restored to him in a moment.

<span id="x.ii-p6"></span>*I fell to the earth.* As Paul was puffed up
with Pharisaical pride, it was meet that he should be afflicted and
thrown down, that he might hear Christ’s voice. He would not have
despised God openly, neither durst he refuse the heavenly oracle; yet
his mind should never have been framed unto the obedience of faith, if
he had continued in his former state; therefore, he is thrown down by
violence, that he may learn to humble himself willingly. Furthermore,
there is in Christ’s words only a brief reprehension, which serveth to
appease the rage of Paul being so cruelly bent. Nevertheless, we have
thence an excellent consolation, in that Christ taking upon him the
person of all the godly, doth complain that whatsoever injury was done
to them was done to him. And as there can no sweeter thing be imagined
to lenify the bitterness of persecution, than when we hear that the Son
of God doth suffer not only with us, but also in us, so again, the
bloody enemies of the gospel, who being now besotted with pride, do mock
the miserable Church, shall perceive whom they have wounded.

<span id="x.ii-p7"></span><span id="x.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p8"></span>**9.** *They which were with me.* I showed in
the other place, that there is no such disagreement in the words of Luke
as there seemeth to be. Luke said there, that though Paul’s companions
stood amazed, yet heard they a voice.  <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) But in this place he saith, they heard
not the voice of him which spake to Paul though they saw the light.
Surely it is no absurd thing to say that they heard some obscure voice;
yet so that they did not discern it as Paul himself, whom alone Christ
meant to stay and tame with the reprehension. Therefore, they hear a
voice, because a sound doth enter into their ears, so that they know
that some speaketh from heaven; they hear not the voice of him that
spake to Paul, because they understand not what Christ saith. Moreover,
they see Paul compassed about with the light, but they see none which
speaketh from heaven.

<span id="x.ii-p10"></span><span id="x.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p11"></span>**10.** *What shall I do, Lord?* This is the
voice of a tamed man, and this is the true turning unto the Lord; when
laying away all fierceness and fury, we bow down our necks willingly to
bear his yoke, and are ready to do whatsoever he commandeth us.
Moreover, this is the beginning of well-doing, to ask the mouth of God;
for their labor is lost who think upon repentance without his word.
Furthermore, in that Christ appointeth Ananias to be Paul’s master, he
doth it not for any reproach, or because he refuseth to teach him; but
by this means he meaneth to set forth, and also to beautify the outward
ministry of the Church.

<span id="x.ii-p12"></span>And even in the person of one man, he
teacheth us  <span id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md) that we must not
grudge to hear him speak with the tongue of men. To the same end tendeth
that which followeth immediately, that he was blind, until offering
himself to become a scholar, he had declared  <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) the humility of his faith. God doth
not indeed make blind all those whom he will lighten; but there is a
general rule prescribed to all men, that those become foolish with
themselves who will be wise to him.

<span id="x.iii"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p1"></span><span id="x.iii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
22:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#012.md)<span id="x.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p2"></span>**12.** And one Ananias, a godly man
according to the law, approved by the testimony of all the Jews which
dwelt there, **13.** Coming unto me, and standing by me, said to me,
Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And I receiving my sight, the same hour
saw him. **14.** But he said to me, The God of our fathers hath prepared
thee that thou mightest know his will, and see the Just, and hear a
voice from his mouth. **15.** Because thou shalt be his witness before
all men of those things which thou hast seen and heard. **16.** And now
why stayest thou? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, in
calling upon the name of the Lord.

<span id="x.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="x.iii-p4"></span><span id="x.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p5"></span>**12.** *One Ananias.* Paul proceedeth now
unto the fourth point, to wit, that he did not only give his name to
Christ, being astonished with miracles, but that he was also well and
thoroughly instructed in the doctrine of the gospel. I have already said
that Ananias met Paul, not by chance, but through the direction of
Christ. And whereas he giveth him the title of godliness as concerning
the law, and saith that he was well reported of by the whole nation, in
these words he preventeth the wrong  <span
id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md) opinion which they might conceive. As
they loathed the Gentiles, so they would never have allowed any teacher
coming from them; and one that had revolted from the law should have
been most detestable. Therefore, he witnesseth that he worshipped God
according to the law, and that his godliness was known and commended
among all the Jews, so that they ought not to suspect him. These words,
according to the law, are ignorantly, by some, coupled with the text
following, that he was approved according to the law. For Ananias’
religion is rather distinguished by this mark from the superstitions of
the Gentiles. Though we must note, that the law is not mentioned to
establish the merits of works, that they may be set against the grace of
God; but Ananias’ godliness is clearly acquitted of all evil suspicion
which might have risen among the Jews. And seeing that he restoreth
sight to Paul with one word, it appeareth thereby that he was sent of
God, as I have said before.

<span id="x.iii-p7"></span><span id="x.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p8"></span>**14.** *The God of our fathers.* As nothing
is more fit to provoke us joyfully to go forward toward God, than when
we know that God doth prevent us with his free goodness, that he may
call us back from destruction to life; so Ananias beginneth here. God,
saith he, hath ordained thee to know his will. For by this means Paul is
taught that God had respect unto him at such time as he went astray, and
was altogether an enemy to his own salvation; and so God’s
predestination doth abolish all preparations which sophisters imagine,
as if man did prevent God’s grace by his own free will. In calling him
the God of the fathers, he reneweth the remembrance of the promises,
that the Jews may know that the new calling of Paul is joined with them,
and that those fall not away from the law who pass over unto Christ.
Therefore Paul confirmeth that by these words which he avouched before
in his own person, that he had not made any departure from the God of
Abraham, whom the Jews had in times past worshipped, but that he
continueth in the ancient worship which the fathers did use, which he
had learned out of the law.

<span id="x.iii-p9"></span>Wherefore, when the question is about
religion, let us learn by the example of Paul, not to imagine any new
God, (as the Papists and Mahometans have done, and as all heretics use
to do) but let us retain that God who hath revealed himself in times
past to the fathers, both by the law, and also by diverse oracles. This
is that antiquity wherein we must remain, and not in that whereof the
Papists boast in vain, who have invented to themselves a strange God,
seeing they have forsaken the lawful fathers.

<span id="x.iii-p10"></span>The same is to be said at this day of the
Jews, whose religion, seeing it disagreeth with the law and the
prophets, their God must also be degenerate and feigned. For he who
would in times past be called the God of Abraham and of the fathers,
appeared at length in the person of his Son, that he may now be called
by his own name,  <span id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) or title, the
Father of Christ. Therefore, he which rejecteth the Son hath not the
Father, who cannot be separated from him. And Ananias saith, that it
cometh to pass, through the free election of God, that the truth of the
gospel doth now appear to Paul; whereupon it followeth, that he did not
attain unto this by his own industry, which the experience of the thing
did also declare. For nothing was more stubborn than Paul until Christ
did tame him. And if we desire to know the cause and beginning, Ananias
calleth us back unto the counsel of God, whereby he was appointed and
ordained; and assuredly it is a more precious thing to know the will of
God, than that men can attain unto it by their own industry.  <span
id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) That which Ananias affirmeth of Paul
ought to be translated unto all, that the treasure of faith is not
common to all;  <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) but it is
offered peculiarly to the elect. Furthermore, it appeareth more plainly
by the next member what this will of God is. For God spake at sundry
times and many ways by his prophets, but last of all, he revealed and
made known his will and himself wholly in his Son (<span
id="x.iii-p13.2"></span>[Heb 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)<span
id="x.iii-p13.2"></span>).

<span id="x.iii-p14"></span>*To see the Just.* Seeing all the Greek
books  <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) in a manner agree
together in the masculine gender, I wonder why Erasmus would rather
translate it in the neuter, *Which is Just;* which sense the readers see
to be cold and far let \[fetched\]. Therefore, I do not doubt but that
*Just* is taken in this place for Christ; and the text runneth very
finely  <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) thus, because it
followeth immediately after, *and hear a voice from his mouth.* And it
is certain that all the godly and holy men did most of all desire that
they might see Christ. Thence flowed that confession of Simeon,

<span id="x.iii-p17"></span>“Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart
in peace; because mine eyes have seen thy salvation,” (<span
id="x.iii-p17.1"></span>[Lu 2:29](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#029.md)<span
id="x.iii-p17.1"></span>).

<span id="x.iii-p18"></span>Therefore this seeing, which godly kings and
prophets did most earnestly desire, as Christ himself doth witness,
(<span id="x.iii-p18.1"></span>[Lu
10:24](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#024)<span id="x.iii-p18.1"></span>.md)
is not without cause extolled as a singular benefit of God. But because
the sight of the eyes should profit little or nothing, which we know was
to many deadly, he adjoineth the hearing of the voice. Ananias setteth
down the cause why God did vouchsafe Paul of so great honor, to wit,
that he might be to his Son a public witness; and he doth so prepare
him, that he may learn not only for himself alone,  <span
id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) but that he may have so much the more
care to profit, because he shall be the teacher of all the whole Church.

<span id="x.iii-p20"></span><span id="x.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p21"></span>**16.** *And now, why tarriest thou?* It is
not to be doubted but that Ananias did faithfully instruct Paul in the
principles of godliness; for he would not have baptized him if he had
been void of true faith. But Luke passeth over many things, and doth
briefly gather the sum. Therefore, seeing Paul doth understand that the
promised redemption is now given in Christ, Ananias saith, for good
causes, that nothing ought to stay him from being baptized. But when he
saith, Why tarriest thou? he doth not chide Paul, neither doth he accuse
him of slackness, but he doth rather amplify the grace of God by adding
baptism. The like sentence had we in the tenth chapter, (<span
id="x.iii-p21.1"></span>[Ac 10:47](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#047.md)<span
id="x.iii-p21.1"></span>)

<span id="x.iii-p22"></span>“Can any man let \[hinder\] those from being
baptized with water who have the Holy Ghost given them even as we?”

<span id="x.iii-p23"></span>But when he saith, Wash away thy sins, by
this speech he expresseth the force and fruit of baptism, as if he had
said, Wash away thy sins by baptism. But because it may seem that by
this means more is attributed to the outward and corruptible element
than is meet, the question is, whether baptism be the cause of our
purging. Surely, forasmuch as the blood of Christ is the only means
whereby our sins are washed away, and as it was once shed to this end,
so the Holy Ghost, by the sprinkling thereof through faith, doth make us
clean continually. This honor cannot be translated unto the sign of
water, without doing open injury to Christ and the Holy Ghost; and
experience doth teach how earnestly men be bent upon this superstition.
Therefore, many godly men, lest they put confidence in the outward sign,
do overmuch extenuate the force of baptism. But they must keep a
measure, that the sacraments may be kept within their bounds, lest they
darken the glory of Christ; and yet they may not want their force and
use.

<span id="x.iii-p24"></span>Wherefore, we must hold this, first, that it
is God alone who washeth us from our sins by the blood of his Son; and
to the end this washing may be effectual in us, he worketh by the hidden
power of his Spirit. Therefore, when the question is concerning
remission of sins, we must seek no other author thereof but the heavenly
Father, we must imagine no other material cause but the blood of Christ;
and when we be come to the formal cause, the Holy Ghost is the chief.
But there is an inferior instrument, and that is the preaching of the
word and baptism itself. But though God alone doth work by the inward
power of his Spirit, yet that doth not hinder but that he may use, at
his pleasure, such instruments and means as he knoweth to be convenient;
not that he includeth in the element anything which he taketh either
from his Spirit or from the blood of Christ, but because he will have
the sign itself to be an help for our infirmity.

<span id="x.iii-p25"></span>Therefore, forasmuch as baptism doth help
our faith, that it may reap forgiveness of sins by the blood of Christ
alone, it is called the washing of the soul. So that the washing, spoken
of by Luke, doth not note out the cause; but is referred unto the
understanding of Paul, who, having received the sign, knew better that
his sins were done away.  <span id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) Though
we must also note this, that there is no bare figure set before us in
baptism, but that the giving of the thing is thereto annexed; because
God promised nothing deceitfully, but doth, indeed, fulfill that which
under the signs he doth signify. Notwithstanding, we must again beware
that we tie not the grace of God to the sacraments; for the external
administration of baptism profiteth nothing, save only where it pleaseth
God it shall. By this there is also another question answered which may
be moved. For seeing Paul had the testimony of the grace of God, his
sins were already forgiven him. Therefore, he was not washed only by
baptism, but he received a new confirmation of the grace which he had
gotten.

<span id="x.iii-p27"></span>*In calling upon the name of the Lord.* It
is out of question that he meaneth Christ, not because the name of
Christ alone is called upon in baptism, but because the Father
commandeth us to ask of him whatsoever is figured in baptism; neither
doth the operation of the Spirit tend to any other end, saving that it
may make us partakers of his death and resurrection. Therefore, Christ
is appointed to excel in baptism, yet inasmuch as he is given us of the
Father, and inasmuch as he poureth out his graces upon us by the Holy
Ghost. Whereby it cometh to pass that the calling upon the name of
Christ containeth both the Father and the Son.

<span id="x.iii-p28"></span>Wherefore, Ananias doth not mean, that the
name of Christ must only be named, but he speaketh of prayer, whereby
the faithful do testify, that the effect of the outward sign is in the
power of Christ alone. For the sacraments have neither any power of
salvation included in them, neither are they anything worth of
themselves. Wherefore, this member is, as it were, a correction of the
former saying, because Ananias doth, in plain words, send Paul from
reposing confidence in the external sign unto Christ.

<span id="x.iii-p29"></span>It is well known how much the Papists differ
from this rule, who tie the cause of grace to their exorcisms and
enchantments; and they are so far from studying to direct the miserable
people unto Christ, that they rather drown Christ in baptism, and
pollute his sacred name by their enchantments.

<span id="x.iv"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p1"></span><span id="x.iv-p1.1"></span>[Acts
22:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#017.md)<span id="x.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p2"></span>**17.** And it came to pass, that, when I was
returned to Jerusalem, and prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;
**18.** And saw him say to me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of
Jerusalem: because they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
**19.** Then I said, Lord, they know that I did cast into prison, and
did beat in every synagogue those which did believe in thee: **20.** And
when the blood of thy witness, Stephen, was shed, I did also stand by
and consented to his death, and kept the raiment of those which slew
him. **21.** And he said unto me, Go: because I will send thee far hence
unto the Gentiles. **22.** And they heard him unto this word, then they
lifted up their voice, saying, Away with such a fellow from off the
earth: for it is not meet that he should live.

<span id="x.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="x.iv-p4"></span><span id="x.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p5"></span>**17.** *And it came to pass.* This had not
been the last conclusion,  <span id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) if
Paul had not been cut off \[stopped short\] with their outrageous
outcries. Notwithstanding, his drift and purpose doth plainly appear by
the former text, \[context\] for he beginneth to intreat of his
ministry, that he may show that he departed not from the Jews of his own
accord, as if he withdrew him of malice from taking pains with them; but
he was drawn unto the Gentiles contrary to his expectation and purpose.
For he came purposely to Jerusalem, that he might impart with his own
nation that grace which was committed to him. But when the Lord cutteth
off his hope which he had to do good, he driveth him thence. But there
was a double offense which Paul goeth about to cure. For they both
thought that the covenant of God was profaned if the Gentiles should be
admitted into the Church together with them, and nothing did grieve the
proud nation so much as that others should be preferred before them, or
so much as made equal with them. Therefore Paul’s defense consisteth in
this, that he was ready, so much as in him *lay,* to do them the best
service he could; but he was afterward enforced by the commandment of
God to go to the Gentiles, because he would not have him to be idle at
Jerusalem. Whereas Erasmus translateth it, That I was carried without
myself, is in Greek word for word, That I was in a trance; whereby he
meant to purchase credit to the oracle. Also the circumstance of the
time and place doth confirm the same, in that the Lord appeared to him
as he prayed in the temple; which was an excellent preparation to hear
the voice of God, Concerning the manner of seeing,  <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md) read that which we touched about the
end of the seventh chapter.

<span id="x.iv-p8"></span><span id="x.iv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p9"></span>**18.** *Because they will not.* Though the
commandment of God alone ought to be sufficient enough to bind us to
obey, yet to the end Paul might be the more willing to follow, Christ
showeth him a reason why he will have him depart out of Jerusalem; to
wit, because he should lose his labor there; but he was not chosen to
that end that he might be idle, or do no good by teaching; though this
were a sore trial, and such as we may think did sore shake him.  <span
id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) Not long before the function of
preaching the gospel was enjoined him, that his voice might sound
throughout the whole world; now even at the first entrance he is
inhibited; yea, his labor seemeth to be condemned of peculiar reproach
when his witness \[testimony\] is rejected, because his person is hated.
But it was meet that the holy servant of the Lord should be thus
humbled, that all the preachers of the gospel might learn to give over
themselves wholly to obey Christ, that when they be excluded from one
place, they may be ready immediately to go to another, and that they may
not be discouraged, nor cease off from doing their duty, though they be
undeservedly loathed.

<span id="x.iv-p11"></span><span id="x.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p12"></span>**19.** *Lord, they know.* By this speech
Paul doth testify that he was not beside himself, or brought into
perplexity,  <span id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) but that he did
assuredly believe the oracle. For without doubt he knew Christ, whom he
calleth Lord. And Paul objecteth, that it cannot almost be, but that
when they see him so suddenly changed, such a spectacle will move them.
Whence he gathereth that he shall not be unfruitful. He thought so
indeed; but Christ answereth flatly, that he hath appointed him another
charge, and he taketh from him the hope which he had in vain conceived
touching the Jews. The question is, whether it were lawful for Paul to
object these reasons to Christ; for it is as much as if he did avouch
that that is probable, which Christ said could not be. I answer, that
God giveth his saints leave, familiarly, to utter their affections
before him;  <span id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) especially when
they seek no other thing but the confirmation of their faith.

<span id="x.iv-p15"></span>If any man stand in his own conceit, or
stubbornly refuse that which God commandeth, his arrogancy shall be
worthily condemned; but God vouchsafeth his faithful servants of a
singular privilege, that they may modestly object those things which may
call them back from the desire to obey; to the end that being free from
lets, they may wholly addict themselves to serve God; as Paul, after
that he was taught that it pleased the Lord that it should be so, he
doth not gainsay nor contend any longer, but being content with that one
exception, and making an end there, he maketh himself ready to take his
journey, which he seemed to be loath to take. In the mean season,
whereas the Jews are not touched with so many miracles, their
stubbornness and pride, which cannot be tamed, is discovered. Which
upbraiding did undoubtedly cause them to rage.

<span id="x.iv-p16"></span><span id="x.iv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p17"></span>**22.** *Away with such a fellow.* Luke
showeth here how outrageously Paul’s sermon was interrupted. For they do
not only oppress him with their crying, but they desire to have him put
to death; where it doth also plainly appear how frenzy \[frenzied\]
pride is. The Jews conceived so great good liking of themselves, that
they did not only despise all the whole world in comparison of
themselves, but they stood also more stoutly in defense of their own
dignity than of the law itself, as if all religion did consist in this,
that Abraham’s stock might excel all other mortal men. So now they rage
against and rail upon Paul, because he said that he was sent to be the
apostle of the Gentiles; as if God were bound by his own liberality to
suffer the contempt of his power  <span
id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md) in the wicked and unthankful, on whom
he bestowed excellent graces above all other. And it is no marvel if
there were such fierceness and fury at that day among the Jews, seeing
that being by all means wasted,  <span id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md)
and accustomed to suffer extreme reproaches at this day, they cease not,
notwithstanding, to swell with servile pride. But these be fruits of
reprobation, until God gather together the remnant according to Paul’s
prophecy (<span id="x.iv-p19.2"></span>[Ro
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005)<span id="x.iv-p19.2"></span>.md).

<span id="x.v"></span>

<span id="x.v-p1"></span><span id="x.v-p1.1"></span>[Acts
22:23-30](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#023.md)<span id="x.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.v-p2"></span>**23.** And as they cried, and cast off their
garments, and threw dust into the air, **24.** The chief captain
commanded him to be led into the camp; and he commanded that he should
be scourged and examined, that he might know for what cause they cried
so on him. **25.** And when they had bound him with thongs, Paul said to
the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that
is a Roman, and uncondemned? **26.** When the centurion heard that, he
went to the chief captain, and told him, saying, What wilt thou do? for
this man is a Roman. **27.** And when the chief captain came, he said to
him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? And he said, Yea. **28.** And the chief
captain answered, With a great sum I purchased this freedom. And Paul
said, I was so born. **29.** Then those who were about to examine him
departed from him immediately: and the chief captain also was afraid,
after that he knew that he was a Roman, and that he had bound him.
**30.** And on the next day, when he would know the truth,  <span
id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md) he loosed him from his bonds, and
commanded the high priests and all the council to come together, and he
brought Paul and set him before them.

<span id="x.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.v-p5"></span><span id="x.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.v-p6"></span>**24.** *The chief captain.* It was well and
wisely done of the chief captain thus to withdraw Paul from the sight of
the people, forasmuch as his presence did move and more provoke them who
were already too much moved. For by this means he provideth for the life
of the holy man, and partly appeaseth the madness of the people. But
when he com-mandeth him to be scourged, to whose charge he heard no
certain crime laid, he seemeth to deal unjustly. And yet this injury
\[injustice\] was not without color, because it was likely that it was,
not without cause, that all the people had conspired to put one man to
death. Therefore, a vehement presumption was the cause of so strait
examination. But we must note that this is a common custom among politic
men, that they be just judges, so far as is expedient for them; but if
they be called away by profit, then they go out of the way.
Nevertheless, it is sufficient for them to color this their wickedness
with the title of wisdom, because they hold that general principle, that
the world cannot be governed without some show or color of justice; but
in all actions that subtilty whereof I spake doth prevail, that they
consider rather what is profitable than what is equal and right.

<span id="x.v-p7"></span><span id="x.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="x.v-p8"></span>**25.** *Is it lawful?* He allegeth first the
privilege of the city, then he defendeth himself by common law. And
though there were more weight in the second point, (to wit, that it is
not lawful to scourge a man before his cause is heard) yet should he
have prevailed nothing, unless the centurion had been more moved with
the honor of the Roman empire. For nothing was then more heinous than to
do any thing which was contrary to the liberty of the people of Rome.
Valerius’ law, the law of Porcius, and of Sempronius, and such like, did
forbid that no man should do any violence to the body of the city of
Rome  <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md) without the commandment of
the people. The privilege was so (sure and) holy, that they thought it
to be not only a deadly offense, but also such an offense as could not
be purged, that a citizen of Rome should be beaten.

<span id="x.v-p10"></span>Therefore, Paul escaped rather by the
privilege than by common equity, yet did he not doubt in a good cause to
bear off the injury which was prepared for him, with this buckler of the
city. But we must know that he did so allege the right and privilege of
the city, that the chief captain was brought to believe him, because his
words should not hare been credited unless he had used some proof.
Moreover, it was no hard matter for a man, who was well known, to bring
forth witnesses. We alleged a cause in the sixteenth chapter, why he
suffered himself to be scourged at Philippos, \[Philippi\] which he now
preventeth by his own declaration; to wit, because he should not have
been heard in a tumult raised among the common people (<span
id="x.v-p10.1"></span>[Ac 16:37](../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037.md)<span
id="x.v-p10.1"></span>). But because he hath now to deal with the
soldiers of Rome, who did behave themselves more moderately and gravely,
he useth the opportunity.

<span id="x.v-p11"></span><span id="x.v-p11.1"></span>

<span id="x.v-p12"></span>**26.** *This man is a Roman.* Some man may
marvel that he was so credulous, who was appointed to be chief in
examining Paul, that he doth affirm the thing, as if he knew it to be
so. For if he ought to believe Paul’s words, every malefactor might, by
this shift, have escaped punishment. But this was their manner of
dealing, he which did say that he was a citizen of Rome, unless he could
bring in some which knew him, or prove it lawfully, he was punished; for
it was death for any man to pretend the freedom of the city falsely.
Wherefore, the centurion referreth the matter unto the chief captain, as
doubting thereof; and he (as we have said) doth straightway examine the
matter more thoroughly. And though Luke doth not express by what
testimonies Paul did prove himself to be a citizen of Rome, yet,
undoubtedly, the chief captain knew the truth of the matter before he
loosed him.

<span id="x.v-p13"></span><span id="x.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="x.v-p14"></span>**28.** *With a great sum.* The chief captain
objecteth this to refute him as if he should say, that the freedom of
the city is not so common, and easily to be obtained. How can it be that
thou, being some base fellow of the country of the Cilicians, shouldst
obtain this honor, for which I paid sweetly? Whereas Paul maketh answer,
that he was free born, who never saw the city, yea, whose father it may
be was never there, there is no cause why this should trouble any man.
For those who are skillful in the Roman history know that certain were
made free of the city who dwelt in the provinces, if, having deserved
well of the commonwealth, or in war, or in other weighty affairs, they
did desire and crave this reward of the deputies, \[proconsuls\] so that
it is no absurdity to say that he was born a citizen of Rome, who,
descending by his ancestors of some province far distant from Rome, did
never set foot in Italy. Notwithstanding, the question is, how this can
hang together, that the chief captain was afraid, because he had bound a
citizen of Rome, and yet he did not loose him from his bonds until the
morrow? It may be that he deferred it till the next day, lest he should
show some token of fear. Notwithstanding, I think that the chief captain
was afraid, because Paul was bound at his commandment, that he might be
scourged, because this was to do injury to the body of a citizen of
Rome, and to break the common liberty, and that \[although\] it was
lawful to put a Roman in prison.
