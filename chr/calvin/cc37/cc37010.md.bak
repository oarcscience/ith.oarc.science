<span id="xi-p1"></span>Chapter 23

<span id="xi.i"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p1"></span><span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>[Acts
23:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#001.md)<span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p2"></span>**1.** And Paul beheld the council
steadfastly, and said, Men and brethren, I have served God until this
day in all good conscience. **2.** And the high priest Ananias commanded
those that stood by him to smite him on the face. **3.** Then Paul said
to him, God will smite thee, thou painted wall; and thou sittest judging
according to law, and transgressing the law, commandest thou me to be
smitten? **4.** And those which stood by said, Railest thou on God’s
high priest? **5.** And Paul said, I wist not, brethren, that he was the
high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler
of thy people.

<span id="xi.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xi.i-p4"></span><span id="xi.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p5"></span>**1.** *Looking earnestly.* Paul beginneth
with the testimony of a good conscience, that all the whole multitude
may understand that he is unjustly charged with such an heinous offense,
as if he had gone about to overthrow the worship of God. It may be,
indeed, that a man may offend of ignorance, who will not otherwise be a
contemner either of God or of religion; but Paul meant at the first,
only with this excuse, to mollify their nettled minds, that he might the
better be heard; for it had been in vain for him to have defended
himself, so long as that opinion did stick in the minds of the priests,
that he was a wicked revolt, \[apostate\]. Therefore, before he enter
the cause, he excuseth himself of that crime, not only that he may
purchase favor by that desire which he had to live godlily, but also
that he may prevent false accusations, or at least that he may refute
unjust prejudices which might have made against him, wherewith he saw
the whole multitude infected and corrupted. We know not what he meant to
say besides. Notwithstanding, this preface teacheth that no man can
rightly handle the doctrine of godliness, unless the fear of God reign
and bear the chief sway in him. And now, though he give not the priests
so honorable a title here as he did a little before, when he stood upon
the steps of the fortress, yet he calleth them brethren, giving them
that honor, not because they deserve it, but that he may testify that he
is not the cause of the breach of friendship.

<span id="xi.i-p6"></span><span id="xi.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p7"></span>**2.** *And the chief priest.* Luke’s
narration seemeth not to agree with the usual history; for Josephus
writeth thus concerning the high priests of that time, that Quadratus,
deputy \[proconsul\] of Syria, deposing Cumanus from the government of
Judea, commanded him to answer for himself before Caesar, and sent
Ananias, the highest priest, bound with him, into whose place who was
chosen he maketh no mention, saving that it is likely that Jonathas had
the honor given him, who, as he reporteth, was afterward slain by the
subtilty and treachery of Felix, deputy \[prefect\] of Judea, who
succeeded Cumanus; for when he had oftentimes told Felix part of his
mind, and he could not away with the constancy of the man, he made a
compact with one Doras, that he should privily convey in murderers to
slay him. Then, as the same Josephus doth witness, king Agrippa made
Ismael, the son of Phebeus, priest. But when he was sent by the people
to Rome about a certain suit, and was kept there by Popea, wife to Nero,
Agrippa putteth in his place one Josephus, whose name was Chabus, the
son of Simon. But immediately being also weary of him, he appointeth
Ananus, the son of Ananus, to be high priest.

<span id="xi.i-p8"></span>Furthermore, he saith that this last thing
happened at such time as, after the death of Festus, Albinus did succeed
him. And I see not why some call this Ananus Ananias. That hath indeed
some color, in that he is called a Pharisee; also in that it is said
that he was bold and stout, who, without any lawful authority, caused
James, the Lord’s brother, to be stoned. But if we give credence to
Josephus, he could not be that Ananias of whom mention is made in this
place by Luke, who was then made priest, when many years were past and
gone, after that Felix departed out of the province.

<span id="xi.i-p9"></span>I have another conjecture in my head. For
there flourished during all that time one Ananias, an high priest, who,
excepting the title of honor, was almost chief in the order. And because
Josephus leaveth some void time between Ananias and Ismael, it may be
that this man had the room of the highest priest in the meantime.  <span
id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md) But though this were not so, it
appeareth out of Josephus, that Ananias, who died when the city was
besieged, was, in the reign of Claudius Caesar and Nero, equal in
dignity with the chief priests which were then.

<span id="xi.i-p11"></span>Yea, his authority is so highly extolled, as
if he had the chief government, howsoever other men did bear the ensigns
of honor. Again, he is called <span id="xi.i-p11.1"></span>αρχιερευς
confusedly,  <span id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md) as those who were
the highest priests. Now, let the readers ponder and consider, whether
the word <span id="xi.i-p12.2"></span>αρχιερευς doth not rather signify
in this place *chief* than *highest,* as it doth in many other places.
For the Evangelists do everywhere call the priests who were of the
course of Aaron <span id="xi.i-p12.3"></span>αρχιερεις, that they may
distinguish them from the Levites, who had a more inferior degree of
priesthood. Moreover, it may be that that Ananias, who was counted stout
and courageous, did supply the high priest’s room in his absence. Those
things which we have recited out of Josephus are recorded partly in the
Twentieth Book of Antiquities, from the third chapter until the eight;
partly in the Second Book of the Wars of the Jews.

<span id="xi.i-p13"></span>*He commanded him to be smitten.* We see that
there was in this assembly great distemperature. For whereas the high
priest was in such rage, that he commanded Paul to be smitten for
nothing, he did it undoubtedly with the consent of all the rest; yea, to
the end he might win the favor of mad men. The Lord doth suffer the
wicked to be so carried away by Satan, that they fall from all show of
equity and temperance. For hypocrites would fain bear some show of
moderation; and undoubtedly this high priest went about to pretend such
gravity as did beseem his person. But the Lord did pluck this visure
\[mask\] from his face, so that there was not found in him so much as
the modesty of a mean man, but he poured out his furious force like a
beast.

<span id="xi.i-p14"></span>In the mean season, we see what horrible and
filthy disorder there was at that day in the Church. Ananias, who was
the chief of the council, whereas he ought to have stayed others by his
gravity, forgetting all modesty, he enforceth them unto violence and
savageness. Therefore they had at that day no regard of discipline, but
there remained among them confused barbarism. And no marvel, for they
had estranged themselves from God; they had most reproachfully rejected
Christ; all their religion was set to sale. Therefore it was meet that
they should run headlong into furious madness, which might be loathsome
even among profane men, that they might be punished in their own shame
for their ungodliness.

<span id="xi.i-p15"></span><span id="xi.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p16"></span>**3.** *God shall smite thee.* Paul cannot
put up that injury, but he must, at least, with sharp words reprehend
the high priest,  <span id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md) and denounce
God’s vengeance unto him. For it is no curse, as appeareth sufficiently
by the Greek text, but rather a reprehension, joined with the denouncing
of a punishment. If any man object, that Paul did not use that modesty
which Christ commandeth his to use, when he commandeth them after they
have received a blow on the left cheek to turn the right cheek also,
(<span id="xi.i-p17.2"></span>[Mt
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039)<span id="xi.i-p17.2"></span>.md) we
may readily answer, that Christ doth not in these words require silence,
whereby the wickedness and frowardness of the wicked may be nourished;
but he doth only bridle their minds, that they may not take that injury,
which they have already received, impatiently. Christ will have those
that be his to be ready to suffer another injury after that they have
already received one; and by this means he represseth all desire of
revenge. This is a brief and true definition of patience which beseemeth
all the faithful, that they break not out into wrathfulness, that they
do not one evil turn for another; but that they overcome evil with
goodness. But this is no let but that they may complain of those
injuries which they have suffered, but that they may reprove the wicked,
and cite them to the judgment-seat of God; so they do this with quiet
and calm minds; and, secondly, without evil will and hatred; as Paul
appealeth, in this place, unto God’s judgment-seat, that the high priest
may not flatter himself in his tyranny. Therefore he accuseth him,
because he breaketh the law, from which (as he pretendeth) he hath his
authority; whence he gathereth, that he shall not escape unpunished.

<span id="xi.i-p18"></span>If any man, being overcome with impatience,
do but murmur, he shall not be blameless. But a manifest and sharp
accusation, if it proceed from a quiet mind, doth not pass the bounds
set down by Christ. If any man say that it is mixed with railing, I
answer, that we must always mark with what affection the words be
uttered. Christ pronounceth that man to be worthy to be punished by the
council who shall only say to his brother *raca;* and as for him who
shall say *thou fool,* he maketh him subject to a more heavy judgment
(<span id="xi.i-p18.1"></span>[Mt
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022)<span id="xi.i-p18.1"></span>.md).
But if opportunity be offered to reprove, we must oftentimes reprehend
sharply. Whereby it appeareth, that this only was Christ’s drift to keep
back his, first, from all indignation, secondly, from speaking anything
in despite  <span id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md) of any man.
Therefore, let us beware of railing, and then we may not only note in
our brethren foolishness, but also it shall be lawful for us to express
their offenses by their names when need shall be. So Paul did not speak
for his own sake, that he might, with sharp words, requite the injury
done to him by the high priest; but because he was a minister of the
word of God, he would not wink at an offense which did deserve sharp and
serious reprehension; especially seeing it was profitable to bring to
light the gross hypocrisy of Ananias. Therefore, so often as we have any
dealings with the wicked, if we be desirous to handle a good cause well,
we must beware that there break out in us no motion of anger, that no
desire of revenge provoke us to break out into railing. But if the
spirit of meekness reign in us, we may handle the wicked according to
their deserts, as it were out of the mouth of God; yet so that it may
appear that we be rather prophets, than that we blunder out anything
rashly through immoderate heat.

<span id="xi.i-p20"></span><span id="xi.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p21"></span>**4.** *Those which stood by said* By this it
appeareth that they were all sick of one disease.  <span
id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md) For why do they not rather blame
Ananias, when they saw that he had quite forgotten all modesty, and that
he brake out into violence and stripes after a barbarous manner? for
even this did turn to the reproach of them all.  <span
id="fr_526"></span>[527](#fn_526.md) But this is a solemn \[marked\] thing
among hypocrites, they look narrowly into other men’s faults and wink at
their own. Again, this pride is coupled with tyranny, so that their
subjects, and those who are under them, may do nothing, but as for
themselves, they may do whatsoever they will. So fareth it at this day
in Popery, the more liberty that impure clergy doth grant to itself, and
the more carelessly it waxeth wanton, and polluteth the whole world with
the sins which flow thence, the more straitly do they rule and stay the
tongues of the people. Therefore, if any man dare be so bold as once to
whisper, a little liberty doth cause them to make outrageous outcries as
it were heinous sacrilege.

<span id="xi.i-p24"></span><span id="xi.i-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p25"></span>**5.** *I knew not, brethren.* Those who
think that this excuse of Paul hath in it no figure, do not well mark
the contrary objections wherewith their error is refuted. They say that
Paul knew not the high priest, because he had been absent long time; as
if he were ignorant that he was chief priest, who is the chief in the
council, and hath the uppermost room. Neither was Ananias so base and
obscure that Paul was ignorant of his degree. But his words cut off all
occasion of disputation, when as he chideth him, because, occupying the
place of a judge, under color of the law, he doth, in his rage, that
which is contrary to law. Therefore Paul knew what place he had, when he
said that he abused his power. Other some invent a more subtle answer,
that he spake not here of the mail, but of the office and public person.
But, first, the exposition is far fet, \[fetched\] because, if Paul did
reverence the priesthood, he must needs have given some honor to the man
which had the same. And now it is not to be thought (forasmuch as the
majesty of the priesthood was abolished by the coming of Christ, and
that there followed such filthy profanation) that Paul did honor those
as he was wont, (as if their perfect and lawful authority did continue)
who, under the title of the high priests, did reign as lords without any
law or right.

<span id="xi.i-p26"></span>Therefore, subscribing to Augustine, I do not
doubt but that this is a taunting excuse. Neither doth that any whit
hinder, because plain speech becometh the ministers of the word. For
seeing there be two sorts of ironies, one which is covered with subtilty
and means to deceive, another which doth so figuratively note out the
thing which is in hand, that it doth prick sorer; in this second, there
is nothing which doth not well beseem the servants of Christ. Therefore,
this is the meaning of the words, Brethren, I acknowledge nothing in
this man which belongeth to the priest. Also, he added a testimony of
the 22nd chapter of Exodus, (<span id="xi.i-p26.1"></span>[Ex
22:28](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#028)<span id="xi.i-p26.1"></span>.md) in
which place, though Moses speak of judges, yet the sentence is extended
properly unto any lawful order. Therefore all dignity, which is
appointed for maintenance of civil government, ought to be reverenced
and had in honor. For whosoever he be that rebelleth against or
resisteth the magistrate, or those who are appointed to rule, and are
promoted unto honor, he would have no government.  <span
id="fr_527"></span>[528](#fn_527.md) And such desire tendeth to the
disturbing of order. Yea, it shaketh and overthroweth all humanity.
Therefore Paul purgeth himself of this crime; yet so, that he denieth
that Ananias is to be counted a priest of God, who hath corrupted and
perverted all the order of the Church.

<span id="xi.i-p28"></span>But here riseth a question, whether we ought
not to obey a ruler, though he exercise tyranny? For if that man be not
to be deprived of honor which executeth his office amiss, Paul offended
in robbing the high priest of his honor. Therefore I answer, that there
is some difference between civil magistrates and the prelates of the
Church. For though the exploiting \[administration\] of earthly or civil
rule be confused or perverse, yet the Lord will have men to continue
still in subjection. But when the spiritual government doth degenerate,
the consciences of the godly are at liberty, and set free from obeying
unjust authority; especially if the wicked and profane enemies of
holiness do falsely pretend the title of priesthood to overthrow the
doctrine of salvation, and challenge to themselves such authority, as
that they will be thereby equal with God. So it is not only lawful for
the faithful at this day to shake off from their shoulders the Pope’s
yoke, but they must do it of necessity, seeing they cannot obey his laws
unless they forsake God.

<span id="xi.ii"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
23:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#006.md)<span id="xi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p2"></span>**6.** And when Paul knew that the one part
were of the Sadducees, and the other of the Pharisees, he cried out in
the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: I
am judged of the hope and resurrection of the dead. **7.** And when he
had thus said, there was a dissension among the Pharisees and Sadducees:
and the multitude was divided. **8.** For the Sadducees say there is no
resurrection, neither angel, neither spirit: but the Pharisees confess
both. **9.** And there was a great cry: and the scribes of the
Pharisees’ sect arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man:
but if the spirit or an angel have spoken to him, let us not fight
against God.

<span id="xi.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xi.ii-p4"></span><span id="xi.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p5"></span>**6.** *And when Paul knew.* The policy
 <span id="fr_528"></span>[529](#fn_528.md) of Paul, whereof Luke maketh
mention, doth seem not to beseem the servant of Christ. For the subtilty
which he used was inwrapped in dissimulation, which was not far from a
lie. He saith that the state of his cause did consist in the
resurrection of the dead: but we know that the strife arose about other
matters: because he disannulled the ceremonies, because he admitted the
Gentiles into the covenant of salvation. I answer, that though these
things be true, yet did not he lie. For he doth neither deny that he was
accused of other matters, neither doth this make the whole controversy
to consist in one point; but he saith truly that the Sadducees were
therefore offended with him, because he did hold the resurrection of the
dead. He knew that those who had conspired together against him were
enemies also one to another.  <span id="fr_529"></span>[530](#fn_529.md) He
knew that his own conscience was clear; and it had been an easy matter
for him to prove his cause good before just judges. Yet because he seeth
them cry out on him clamorously, and that he had no place granted to
defend himself, he setteth his enemies together by the ears. Whereby it
doth also appear, that they were carried away through ignorance and
blind zeal. Therefore we must note that Paul did so begin, as that he
was desirous truly and plainly to unfold the whole matter; and that he
did not craftily refuse to make a pure and sound confession, such as,
the servants of Christ ought to make; but because the way was stopt
before him, neither could he be heard, he used the last remedy,  <span
id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) to declare that his adversaries were
carried headlong with blind hatred. For the end doth show, that those
are not guided with reason or judgment, who are carried out of the way
by mutual discord.

<span id="xi.ii-p9"></span>Now, if any man, which darkeneth the light of
doctrine, excuse his craft, by the example of Paul, he is easily
refuted. For it is one thing for a man to provide for himself alone with
the loss of truth, and another to lead the professed enemies of Christ
from resisting him, that they may strive among themselves.

<span id="xi.ii-p10"></span>Furthermore, we see the nature of the
wicked, though they disagree among themselves like enemies, yet when
they are to make war against the gospel, they forget their own garboils
\[strifes\]. For Satan, the father of discord, doth procure this one
consent only among his, that they may be of one mind and of one
affection, to extinguish godliness. So we see that the factions which
are in Popery hot,  <span id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) are quiet
only so long as they join hand in hand to oppress the gospel. For which
cause, the disciples of Christ must be more courageous to foster and
nourish truth, that, being joined together, they may the better resist.
Also, we gather by this what manner of peace the Scripture commendeth
unto us. Christ saith that the peace-makers are the children of God,
(<span id="xi.ii-p11.2"></span>[Mt
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009)<span id="xi.ii-p11.2"></span>.md) and
this is true, that they must do what they can to bring all men that they
may grow together  <span id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md) under the
Lord. Yet this doth not hinder but that we may, (fighting under the
banner of the same Lord) as it were, with the sound of the trumpet, stir
up the wicked, that they may, like Midianites, one slay another, (<span
id="xi.ii-p12.2"></span>[Jud 7:22](../../../bib/kjv/jdg007.htm#022.md)<span
id="xi.ii-p12.2"></span>) so that both simplicity of zeal, and the
wisdom of the Spirit, direct us hither.

<span id="xi.ii-p13"></span>*One part were Sadducees.* We see here
again, as in a glass, how deformed and confused the ruin of the Church
was at that day. Faith is the soul of the Church; nothing is more proper
to faith than agreement, nothing more contrary than sects. And this
thing must needs follow, when every man (setting aside the word of God)
did draw his disciples unto his own inventions. For there is no other
holy bond of unity than the natural and plain  <span
id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) truth of God. So soon as men depart
from that, no marvel if they be dispersed and drawn hither and thither
like members pulled asunder.

<span id="xi.ii-p15"></span>Therefore, the beginning of sects among the
Jews was the corruption of the law; like as the Lord did revenge the
profanation of his word, which was corrupt with diverse inventions of
men, with like punishment in Popery. Wherefore, we must the more fear,
lest horrible and more lamentable scatterings hang over our heads than
was that which was in time of Popery, whereof there appear some tokens.
And no marvel, seeing we provoke the Lord to wrath so many ways with our
unthankfulness. But though the face of the Church be blotted and blurred
with many spots and blots; and what manner of deformity soever fall out
hereafter, let us comfort ourselves with this, that as God was careful
then to deliver the Church wonderfully from destruction, so through his
grace there shall always some seed continue. It cannot be, indeed, but
that godly minds will somewhat despair, when they see things so far out
of order; but let us learn straightway to hold up that buckler, that the
Lord, who, in such a thick mist of errors, in such a heap of
superstitions, in the unbridled licentiousness of sects, did preserve
his Church among the Jews, will never suffer the same to be quite put
out wholly in the world.

<span id="xi.ii-p16"></span>The same thing did likewise happen in
Popery. For when as the worship of God was overthrown there, the
doctrine of salvation was oppressed, the kingdom of Christ was thrown
down, and ungodliness did openly reign, yet God did save certain hidden
remnants, and there was always some wheat in the chaff. It is very
profitable to confer these examples together. When as we inveigh at this
day against Popery, the hired patrons thereof cry out on the other side,
that nothing is more absurd than that we should imagine that the Church
of God was extinguished during many ages, as if we did imagine that God
had no people left, when those had forsaken him who ought to have
maintained his pure worship. Yea, we complain that those tyrants did
corrupt the Church, that the temple was by them profaned, so that it did
not greatly differ from an hog’s-sty, that the flock of Christ was
scattered abroad, and his sheepfold broken down. Finally, that the
Church was hidden from the eyes of men, yet so that the Lord knew his
elect, though they were dispersed, and did brood them under his wings.
And by this it appeareth how foolishly the Papists brag and boast of the
titles of honor, in that not the common sort, or any private men, but
the priests themselves did in times past divide the Jewish church by
deadly dissension.

<span id="xi.ii-p17"></span>Wherefore, there is no cause why we should
be afraid stoutly to resist the pride of the Pope and of all his
adherents, with whom we have the same combat which the prophets and
apostles had with the priests of their time. And as the reverence of the
Church did not keep back holy men, but that they did molest the tyranny
of the wicked priests, so we must not be terrified with vain visures,
\[masks\] under which the Papists do vainly boast, seeing they have,
notwithstanding, cast from them the doctrine of godliness. It is certain
that the people were then divided into three sects; but Luke doth only
make mention of the Pharisees and Sadducees, omitting the Essenes,
because it was most fit for his purpose thus to do. And though this be
the common opinion concerning their names, that the former took their
name of separating, because they withdrew themselves from the company of
other men, by reason of their reigned holiness; and that the second sort
took their name of righteousness, as if they were called *zeduchim;*
notwithstanding, for mine own part, as I have said elsewhere, I am
rather of their mind who say that the Pharisees took their name of
interpreting. For *phrus* signifieth exposition, whereupon also
interpreters are called *phruschim;* and we know that the Pharisees,
being not content with the natural doctrine of the law and prophets, did
put in many inventions which they said they received  <span
id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) of the fathers.

<span id="xi.ii-p19"></span><span id="xi.ii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p20"></span>**8.** *The Sadducees say.* Though Luke
maketh mention of three points wherein these sects did dissent, yet
shortly after he bringeth  <span id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535.md) them
to two, because there is like respect to be had of spirits and of
angels. Therefore, he saith that the Pharisees did confess both; to wit,
that the dead shall rise again, and that human and angelical spirits are
immortal. And here Luke declareth in what sense the apostle professed
himself to be a Pharisee, not because he did subscribe to all their
inventions, but only in the resurrection of the dead. We know how
sharply Christ reproveth their errors, (<span
id="xi.ii-p21.2"></span>[Mt 22:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#029.md)<span
id="xi.ii-p21.2"></span>) therefore, it had been good that some
exception had been added,  <span id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536.md) lest
any man might think that Paul was one with them in all things. Now,
though the Sadducees did deny the resurrection, yet may we not think
that they were altogether like to the Epicures, \[Epicureans\]. For they
did confess that the world is governed by the providence of God, and
that every man is rewarded for his works. In this point they were
sounder than the Epicures, \[Epicureans\]. But they did dote too
grossly, when they included the rewards of righteousness and the
punishments of wickedness in this life. For that I may omit the
Scripture, experience doth teach, that as well the godly as the ungodly
are either punished with many miseries, or else gently  <span
id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537.md) dealt withal; and that the wicked do
oftentimes live in wealth and pleasures, when as the worshippers of God
are oftentimes miserably tormented; as it is <span
id="xi.ii-p23.2"></span>[Ps 73:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#004.md)<span
id="xi.ii-p23.2"></span>. Therefore, whosoever esteemeth the judgment of
God by the present estate of men, whether it be good or bad, he must
needs fall away from faith at length unto Epicurish contempt of God.

<span id="xi.ii-p24"></span>Now, this is beastly blockishness to rest in
an uncertain and transitory life, and not to be wise above  <span
id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538.md) the earth. For which cause we must
flee from that error as from a detestable monster. For though godliness
have the promises of the earthly life also, yet because we be most
miserable if our hope stay still in this world, the children of God must
begin with this, that they may lift up their eyes toward heaven, and
think continually upon the glory of the last resurrection.

<span id="xi.ii-p26"></span>*Neither angel nor spirit.* This place is
expounded two manner of ways.  <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md)
Many refer it unto the Holy Ghost, which seemeth to be unlikely. For
howsoever the Sadducees be to be holden excused in other errors, yet
because the Scripture doth so often repeat the name of the Spirit, I
will scarce believe that they denied that which the Pharisees believed
only lightly and obscurely. For even these men had no distinct faith
concerning the Holy Spirit, that they did acknowledge the proper person
of the Spirit in the substance of God.  <span
id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540.md) Some will have angel and spirit to
signify one thing,  <span id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541.md) as if one
thing were spoken twice. But to what end was it to repeat a thing which
was plain enough? I warrant you, that member which followeth did deceive
them, where Luke seemeth to make no distinction. But we showed the
reason before; because, seeing the souls of men and angels are of one
and the same nature and substance, they be both placed in one order.
Therefore, I do not doubt but that this is Luke’s true meaning, that the
Sadducees did deny angels, and also all manner of spirits.

<span id="xi.ii-p30"></span>Now, forasmuch as Paul crieth that he is a
Pharisee in this point of doctrine, he doth flatly condemn all
brain-sick fellows, who at this day are in the same error. For there be
certain profane and unlearned men who dream that angels and devils are
nothing else but good and evil inspirations; and lest they want some
color, they say that all that came from the heathen which the Scripture
hath concerning good and evil angels, whereas that opinion which was
common in the world had his \[its\] beginning from the heavenly
doctrine. But the heathen did with their lies pollute that doctrine
which they had from the Fathers. As touching men’s souls, because even
at this day certain miscreants do feign that the souls do vanish away in
death until the day of the resurrection, their madness is likewise
refuted by the testimony of Luke.

<span id="xi.ii-p31"></span><span id="xi.ii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p32"></span>**9.** *There was a great cry.* That
sedition whereof Luke spake a little before is more plainly expressed in
this place; to wit, that they were not only of diverse opinions, but did
strive clamorously with outcries. Wherefore, <span
id="xi.ii-p32.1"></span>ςασις doth signify somewhat more than
dissension. Furthermore, this place doth teach what mischief
disagreements bring with them. For because they take their beginning for
the most part of ambition, men proceed thence unto contention, and
straightway stubbornness breaketh out. When they be come thither,
because there is no place left either for judgment or moderation, they
can no longer judge of the cause. Those who did detest Paul begin at a
sudden to defend him. It was well done, if they had done it with
judgment. But because they inveigh against the Sadducees, they are so
inflamed with hatred against them, that they be blind in Paul’s matter.
For which cause we must beware of heat of contention, which disturbeth
all things.

<span id="xi.ii-p33"></span>*If the Spirit.* This ought undoubtedly to
be expounded of the Holy Ghost. And nothing could be spoken either more
godly or modestly. For so soon as it is apparent that any doctrine is
revealed from heaven, those do wickedly resist God who do not receive
the same. But how is it that the scribes do so suddenly count Paul a
prophet of God whom they were once ready to have murdered — whom they
had condemned with their prejudice until the contention arose?  <span
id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542.md) Furthermore, as they did cut their own
throats with these words as with a sword, so God would have them to be
to us teachers to instruct us, that we despise not the oracles which
come from heaven. Notwithstanding, we see again that those stand in
doubt who take not good heed, and are not careful to mark the word of
God; and that they waver so often as any thing is brought to light,
because they be unworthy to understand the certain truth. Wherefore, if
we be desirous to have our studies governed by the spirit of discretion,
let us apply ourselves to learn.

<span id="xi.iii"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p1"></span><span id="xi.iii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
23:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#010.md)<span id="xi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p2"></span>**10.** And when there arose a sore
dissension among them, the chief captain feared lest Paul should have
been pulled in pieces by them, and he commanded the soldiers to go down,
and to take him from them, and to bring him into the camp, **11.** And
the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, lie of good
courage, Paul: for as thou hast borne witness of me at Jerusalem, so
must thou bear witness of me at Rome also. **12.** And when it was day,
certain of the Jews gathered themselves together, and bound themselves
with a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they
had killed Paul. **13.** And there were more than forty men which had
made this conspiracy. **14.** And they came to the chief priests and
elders, and said, We have bound ourselves with a curse, that we will eat
nothing until we have killed Paul. **15.** Now therefore signify ye to
the chief captain and council that he bring him forth to you tomorrow,
as if ye would know somewhat more certainly of him: and we, before he
come near, are ready to kill him. **16.** But when Paul’s sister’s son
heard of the lying in wait, he came and entered into the camp, and told
Paul.

<span id="xi.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xi.iii-p4"></span><span id="xi.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p5"></span>**10.** We see again what a cruel mischief
contention is, which so soon as it doth once wax hot, hath such violent
motions, that even most wise men are not well in their wits. Therefore,
so soon as any beginning shall show itself, let us study to prevent it
in time, lest the remedy be too late in bridling it when it is in the
middle, because no fire is so swift as it. As for the chief captain, as
he was appointed to be the minister of God’s providence to save Paul’s
life, so he delivereth him now the second time by his soldiers from
death. For though the chief captain defend  <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md) him so diligently, for no other
purpose save only that he may prevent uproars and murder; yet the Lord,
who from heaven provided and appointed help for his servant, doth direct
his blind hands thither.

<span id="xi.iii-p7"></span><span id="xi.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p8"></span>**11.** *And the night following.* Luke
declareth that Paul was strengthened with an oracle, that he might stand
courageously against terrible assaults when things were so far out of
order. Surely it could not be but that he was sore afraid, and that he
was sore troubled with the remembrance of things to come. Wherefore, the
oracle was not superfluous. Those former things whereby he was taught
that God cared for him, ought to have sufficed to nourish his hope, and
to have kept him from fainting; but because in great dangers Satan doth
oftentimes procure new fears, that he may thereby (if he cannot
altogether overwhelm God’s promises in the hearts of the godly) at least
darken the same with clouds, it is needful that the remembrance of them
be renewed, that faith, being holpen with new props and stays, may stand
more steadfastly. But the sum is, that Paul may behave himself boldly,
because he must be Christ’s witness at Rome also. But this seemeth to be
but a cold and vain consolation, as if he should say, Fear not, because
thou must abide a sorer brunt; for it had been better, according to the
flesh, once to die, and with speed to end his days, than to pine away in
bands, and long time to lie in prison. The Lord doth not promise to
deliver him; no, he saith not so much as that he shall have a joyful
end; only he saith, that those troubles and afflictions, wherewith he
was too sore oppressed already, shall continue long. But by this we
gather better of what great importance this confidence is, that the Lord
hath respect unto us in our miseries, though he stretch not forth his
hand by and by to help us.

<span id="xi.iii-p9"></span>Therefore, let us learn, even in most
extreme afflictions, to stay ourselves upon the word of God alone; and
let us never faint so long as he quickeneth us with the testimony of his
fatherly love. And because oracles are not now sent from heaven, neither
doth the Lord himself appear by visions, we must meditate upon his
innumerable promises, whereby he doth testify that he will be nigh unto
us continually. If it be expedient that an angel come down unto us, the
Lord will not deny even this kind of confirmation. Nevertheless, we must
give this honor to the word, that being content with it alone we wait
patiently for that help which it promiseth us.

<span id="xi.iii-p10"></span>Moreover, it did profit some nothing to
hear angels which were sent down from heaven; but the Lord doth not in
vain seal up in the hearts of the faithful by his Spirit those promises
which are made by him. And as he doth not in vain beat them in and often
repeat them,  <span id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md) so let our faith
exercise itself diligently in the continual remembrance of them. For if
it were necessary that Paul’s faith should be oftentimes set and stored
up with a new help, there is none of us which needeth not many more
helps. Also, our minds must be armed with patience, that they may pass
through the long and troublesome circuits of troubles and afflictions.

<span id="xi.iii-p12"></span><span id="xi.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p13"></span>**12.** *And when it was day.* By this
circumstance, Luke showeth how necessary it was for Paul to gather new
and fresh strength of faith, that he might not quake in most great and
sudden danger. For being told of this so desperate madness of his
enemies, he could not otherwise think but that he should lose his life.
This vow whereof Luke speaketh was a kind of curse. The cause of the vow
was, that it might not be lawful for them to change their purpose, nor
to call back that which they had promised. There is always, indeed, in
an oath a secret curse,  <span id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md) if any
man deceive or forswear, but sometimes to the end men may the more bind
themselves, they use certain forms of cursing;  <span
id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md) and they make themselves subject to
cruel torments, to the end they may be the more afraid. This history
doth teach that zeal is so bloody in hypocrites, that they weigh not
what is lawful for them, but they run carelessly whithersoever their
lust doth carry them. Admit we grant that Paul was a wicked man, and
worthy to die, yet who had given private men leave to put him to death?
Now, if any man had asked why they did so hate Paul, they would quickly
have answered, because he was a revolt \[apostate\] and schismatic; but
it was but a foolish opinion, and an opinion conceived of an uncertain
report concerning this matter which had rashly possessed their minds.

<span id="xi.iii-p16"></span>The same blindness and blockishness doth at
this day prick forward the Papists, so that they think nothing unlawful
for them in destroying us. Hypocrisy doth so blind their ears, that as
men freed from the laws of God and merit they are carried by their zeal
sometimes unto treachery, sometimes unto guile, sometimes unto
intolerable cruelty, and, finally, to attempt whatsoever they will.
Moreover, we see in this history how great the rashness of the wicked
is. They bind themselves with a curse that they will eat no meat till
they have slain Paul, as if his life were in their hands. Therefore,
these brain-sick men take to themselves that which the Lord doth so
often in Scripture say is his, to wit,

<span id="xi.iii-p17"></span>“To have the life and death of those men
whom he hath created in his hand,”  
(<span id="xi.iii-p17.2"></span>[De
32:39](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#039)<span id="xi.iii-p17.2"></span>.md).

<span id="xi.iii-p18"></span>Moreover, there be not only two or three
who are partners in this madness, but more than forty. Whence we do also
gather how willing and bent men are to do mischief, seeing they run
together thus on heaps.  <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p20"></span>Furthermore, seeing Satan doth drive them
headlong into their own destruction, how shameful is then our
sluggishness, when as we scarce move one finger in maintaining the glory
of God? We must use moderation, that we attempt nothing without the
commandment of God; but when God calleth us expressly, our loitering is
without excuse.

<span id="xi.iii-p21"></span><span id="xi.iii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p22"></span>**14.** *They came to the chief priests.*
Seeing that the priests agree to such a wicked and ungodly conspiracy,
by this they prove that there was in them neither any fear of God,
neither yet any humanity. They do not only allow \[approve\] that which
is brought before them concerning the murdering of the man by laying
wait, but also they are ready to be partners in the murder, that they
may deliver him into the hands of the murderers, whom they would have
made away some way, they pass not how. For what other thing was it to
take a man out of the hands of the judge and to slay him, than like
murderers to rage even in the very place of judgment? The priests surely
would never have allowed \[approved\] such a wicked purpose if there had
been in them any drop of godly and right affection, or of humane
feeling. Moreover, they did what they could to bring destruction upon
all the people and themselves also. But the Lord did by this means
disclose their wicked impiety, which lay hid under a color of honor.

<span id="xi.iii-p23"></span><span id="xi.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p24"></span>**16.** *Paul’s sister’s son.* We see in
this place how the Lord doth cross the purposes of the ungodly. He
permitteth them to attempt many things, and he suffereth their wicked
endeavors, but at length he showeth even in the twinkling of an eye
 <span id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) that he doth from heaven deride
whatsoever men go about upon earth.

<span id="xi.iii-p26"></span>“There is no wisdom,” saith Solomon, “there
is no counsel against the Lord,”  
(<span id="xi.iii-p26.2"></span>[Pr
21:30](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#030)<span id="xi.iii-p26.2"></span>.md).

<span id="xi.iii-p27"></span>Whereto that of Isaiah doth answer,

<span id="xi.iii-p28"></span>“Take counsel together, and it shall come
to nought: speak the word, and it shall not stand,”  
(<span id="xi.iii-p28.2"></span>[Isa
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#010)<span id="xi.iii-p28.2"></span>.md).

<span id="xi.iii-p29"></span>This is set before our eyes to be
considered, in this present history, as in a glass. The matter was
almost dispatched, that Paul should come out on the morrow to be slain
as an avowed sacrificed.  <span id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) But
the Lord doth show that his life is most safely kept, so that whatsoever
men go about all is in vain. As for us, let us not fear but that his
providence, whereof he showed some token then, reacheth even unto the
defending of us, because this promise continueth sure,

<span id="xi.iii-p31"></span>“There shall not an hair fall from your
heads,” etc.  
(<span id="xi.iii-p31.2"></span>[Lu
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#018)<span id="xi.iii-p31.2"></span>.md).

<span id="xi.iii-p32"></span>Moreover, it is worth the noting, that he
worketh sometimes by means unlooked for to save those that be his, that
he may the better exercise our faith. Who would have thought that a boy
would have disclosed their lying in wait, which those who were partners
in the conspiracy thought was known to none but to themselves?
Therefore, let us learn to lean unto and stay ourselves upon the Lord,
though we see no ordinary way to save ourselves, who shall find a way
even through places where nothing can pass.

<span id="xi.iv"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p1"></span><span id="xi.iv-p1.1"></span>[Acts
23:17-24](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#017.md)<span id="xi.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p2"></span>**17.** And when Paul had called unto him one
of the centurions, he saith, Bring this young man unto the chief
captain: for he hath a certain thing to show him. **18.** And he took
him, and led him unto the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner
called me unto him, and desired me to bring this young man unto thee,
who hath somewhat to say to thee. **19.** And the chief captain took him
by the hand, and went aside with him, and asked him, What is it that
thou hast to say to me? **20.** And he said, The Jews have conspired
together to desire thee that thou bring forth Paul into the council
tomorrow, as if they would know somewhat more certainly of him. **21.**
But do not thou obey them:  <span id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) for
more than forty of them lie in wait for him, who have bound themselves
with a curse, that they will neither eat nor drink until they have slain
him: and now they be ready waiting that thou shouldst promise. **22.**
Therefore the chief captain let the young man go, and commanded him,
Tell no man that thou hast told me these things. **23.** And when he had
called unto him two under captains, he said, Make ready two hundred
soldiers that they may go to Cesarea, and horsemen seventy, and two
hundred with darts,  <span id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md) \[or
javelins\] at the third hour of the night. **24.** And make ready
beasts, that they may set Paul thereon, and bring him safe to Felix the
governor.

<span id="xi.iv-p5"></span> 

<span id="xi.iv-p6"></span><span id="xi.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p7"></span>**17.** *Calling unto him.* Paul was not so
desirous of life, but he would have made haste to die, if the Lord had
thought it good so to be; but because he knoweth that he serveth Christ
upon that condition, that he may no less live than die to him, he doth
not neglect to avoid the danger which was revealed to him. And though he
be fully persuaded that God is the keeper of his life, yet he doth not
wait until God put forth his hand out of heaven to work a miracle, but
doth rather use the remedy which is offered him; nothing doubting but
that it is appointed by God.

<span id="xi.iv-p8"></span>Thus must all the ministers of Christ deal,
that being furnished with invincible constancy, so far as their calling
requireth, they fear not danger, and yet that they cast not away
themselves through rashness. Let them call upon the name of the Lord
cheerfully, even amidst the pikes;  <span
id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) and yet let them not contemn those
helps which are offered; otherwise they shall be injurious to God, in
that they are not only not moved with his promises,  <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) but also despise the means which he
hath appointed for their deliverance.

<span id="xi.iv-p11"></span><span id="xi.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p12"></span>**19.** *Taking him by the hand.* In that
the chief captain did show himself so courteous to the young man, in
that he led him by the hand into a secret place, in that he vouchsafeth
to hear him so gently, all this must be attributed to the grace of God,
who promised to give his people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,
(<span id="xi.iv-p12.1"></span>[Ex
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo003.htm#021)<span id="xi.iv-p12.1"></span>.md)
who useth to mollify hard hearts, to tame fierce spirits, and to fashion
those unto all humanity, whom he hath determined to use as means to help
those that be his. A man trained up in the wars might no less have given
this young man the repulse, whom he knew not, than have despised Paul’s
suit. Therefore, the Lord, who hath in his hand the hearts of men, did
frame the profane man to give ear unto him. Also, it was well that he
knew before how furiously they raged against Paul, that he might the
more willingly succor a miserable and forsaken man. Those who are in
authority are taught by this example what a great virtue courtesy is. If
it had been a hard matter to come to him,  <span
id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) he might, through ignorance, have
delivered Paul to the Jews to be put to death. So oftentimes magistrates
do fall into many and great offenses through their own pride, because
they will not admit those who would give them good counsel.

<span id="xi.iv-p14"></span>*CalIing unto him.* And here we see the
providence of God yet more manifestly; for though this be the drift of
the chief captain: to prevent a public uproar, whereof he should have
given an account before the governor, yet he executeth the counsel of
God in delivering Paul. For he was to gather soldiers together; also,
the city must needs be stripped of the garrison, and the voyage required
some cost. Therefore: we must so consider the wisdom of the chief
captain, that our faith lift up her eyes into heaven: and understand
that God doth guide the heart of a profane man by a secret instinct, and
that he is at length a guide to Paul and the soldiers, that he may come
safe to Cesarea. The third hour of the night was the end of the first
watch. Therefore, it is all one as if the chief captain did command that
the soldiers be in readiness at the second watch. Luke calleth those who
carried darts *lancearios,* who being more lightly weaponed, were placed
in the wings, when as the soldiers which pertained unto the legions were
more fit for set war.  <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md)

<span id="xi.v"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p1"></span><span id="xi.v-p1.1"></span>[Acts
23:25-35](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#025.md)<span id="xi.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p2"></span>**25.** And he wrote a letter after this sort:
**26.** Claudius Lysias to the most mighty ruler, \[prefect\] Felix,
sendeth greeting. **27.** This man being taken of the Jews, and almost
killed of them, did I rescue, coming upon them with soldiers, after that
I knew that he was a Roman. **28.** And being desirous to know the cause
for which they did accuse him, I brought him into their council: **29.**
Whom I perceived they accused of questions of their law, having in him
no crime worthy of death or of bonds. **30.** And when I was certified
of the laying await of the Jews, I sent him straightway unto thee, and
gave commandment to his accusers, that they should tell those things
before thee what they have against him. Farewell. **31.** And the
soldiers, as they were commanded, took Paul, and brought him by night
unto Antipatris. **32.** And on the morrow when they had sent away the
horsemen that they might go with him, they returned to the camp. **33.**
When they were come to Cesarea, and had delivered the epistle to the
governor, they presented Paul also before him. **34.** And when the
governor had read it, and had asked of what province he was, and had
known that he was of Cilicia; **35.** I will hear thee, saith he, when
thine accusers are come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s
judgment-hall.

<span id="xi.v-p3"></span> 

<span id="xi.v-p4"></span><span id="xi.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p5"></span>**25.** *And he wrote a letter.* First, we
must briefly admonish the readers who have not been conversant in
histories, that this Felix was brother to Pallas, who being Caesar’s
freeman, became equal with the chief of the city in wealth and power.
Yea, moreover, the senate gave him the ornaments of the praetor, not
without titles of filthy and shameful flattery. Therefore, seeing the
servants of Claudius abusing his folly, did rule the Roman empire at
their pleasure, and chiefly Narcissus and Pallas, no marvel if this
latter did appoint his brother to be governor of Judea. The sum of the
epistle tendeth to this end, that the chief captain may help Paul with
his prejudice;  <span id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) and may admonish
Felix of the injuries of his adversaries, and may so discredit them,
that they may not be able to do him any hurt.

<span id="xi.v-p7"></span><span id="xi.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p8"></span>**27.** *This man being taken.* This was
spoken odiously concerning the Jews, that he might purchase more favor
for Paul, that a man, being a Roman, was by them sore beaten, and almost
slain; also, he commendeth him for the right and privilege of his
freedom, that he may be the more courteously handled. Furthermore, this
commendation was not purchased by prayer or flattery, neither was it
bought with money. How came it to pass, then, that the chief captain did
show himself so courteous freely to an obscure man, and whom all men did
hate, save only because the Lord had appointed him to be his servant’s
patron? Therefore, we see how he governeth the tongues and hands of the
infidels to the profit of those that be his.

<span id="xi.v-p9"></span><span id="xi.v-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p10"></span>**29.** *Whom I perceived* In this place he
acquitteth Paul, so far as his judgment could reach. But let us note
that a profane man speaketh. For among the people of God it is an
offense worthy of no less punishment, to corrupt the doctrine of
godliness with wicked, and false opinions, than to do injury to, or
commit wickedness among men. The Romans would not have suffered their
superstitions, or reigned worshippings of their gods, to be freedom;
 <span id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) but forasmuch as they made no
account of the law of God, yea, seeing they were desirous to have the
same quite put out, it was among them no fault to believe Moses and the
prophets no more, or to trouble the Church with false opinions.
Therefore, there was a law, that the governors should not meddle with
such matters; but that those who were abiding in the provinces should so
retain their religion, that if anything were done contrary to the same,
the Roman magistrates should not meddle with the punishing thereof. This
is the reason why the chief captain thinketh it no offense to have moved
questions concerning the law. And under color hereof, unlearned men will
have leave granted to themselves and others amiss to cause trouble. The
Lord saith far otherwise, who doth more sharply punish the violating of
his worship, than any injuries done to men. And surely nothing is more
absurd than to let those who rob God of his honor escape scot free,
 <span id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md) seeing theft is punished. But
as the chief captain careth not for the Jewish religion, so the false
accusations and slanders of the Jews are refuted, wherewith they would
gladly have burdened Paul.

<span id="xi.v-p13"></span><span id="xi.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p14"></span>**30.** *When it was showed to me.* The
second part of the epistle where the chief captain doth bring the
adversaries into contempt,  <span id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md)
because they went about to kill Paul treacherously. Whence it is also
gathered, that they trouble Paul unjustly, and that they sought so sore
against his life without any cause. For if they had persecuted him
lawfully, they would have trusted to the goodness of their cause, and
not have suffered him to be judged according to law. Now, when as they
seek to kill him, it appeareth that they have no reason.

<span id="xi.v-p16"></span><span id="xi.v-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p17"></span>**32.** *And the next day.* Though Luke did
not express before that the soldiers were commanded to return before
they came at their way’s end, yet it is certain, that they were
appointed to accompany him only unto that place where the chief captain
thought Paul would be safe; for he went out privily in the night. And
the chief captain knew that so soon as they had finished some part of
their journey, there was no farther danger, because the adversaries
could have no hope to overtake him; and that it was no point of wisdom
