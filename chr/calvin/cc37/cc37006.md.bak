<span id="vii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 19

<span id="vii.i"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p1"></span><span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>[Acts
19:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And it came to pass when Apollos was
at Corinthus, that Paul, having gone through the upper parts, came to
Ephesus, and having found certain disciples, he said unto them, **2.**
Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? But they said unto
him, Yea, we have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.
**3.** And he said unto them, Wherewith were ye then baptized? And they
said, With the baptism of John. **4.** And Paul said, John truly
baptized with the baptism of repentance, speaking to the people, that
they should believe in Him who should come after him; that is, in Christ
Jesus. **5.** When they heard these things, they were baptized in the
name of the Lord Jesus. **6.** And when Paul had laid his hands upon
them, the Holy Ghost came upon them; and they spake with tongues, and
did prophesy. **7.** And all the men were about twelve.

<span id="vii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="vii.i-p4"></span><span id="vii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p5"></span>**1.** Luke showeth here that the Church of
Ephesus was not only confirmed and increased by Paul’s return, but also
that there was a miracle wrought there, because the visible graces of
the Spirit were given to certain rude and new disciples. Furthermore, it
is not known whether they were inhabitants of the city or strangers;
neither doth it greatly skill. It is not to be doubted but that they
were Jews, because they had received the baptism of John; also, it is to
be thought that they dwelt at Ephesus when Paul found them there.

<span id="vii.i-p6"></span><span id="vii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p7"></span>**2.** *Whether they had received the Holy
Ghost.* The end of the history doth show that Paul doth not speak in
this place of the Spirit of regeneration, but of the special gifts which
God gave to divers at the beginning of the gospel, for the common
edifying of the Church. But now upon this interrogation of Paul ariseth
a question, whether the Spirit were common to all everywhere at that
time? For if he were given only to a few, why doth he join him with
faith, as if they were so linked together that they could not be
separate? Peradventure, they were none of the common sort; or because
they were an indifferent number, that is, twelve, Paul demandeth whether
they were all without the gifts of the Spirit. Notwithstanding, I think
thus, that so many Jews were offered in presence of the Gentiles, not by
chance, but by the counsel of God; and that at one time being disciples,
that is, of the number of the faithful, who did notwithstanding confess
that they were ignorant of the principal glory of the gospel, which was
apparent in spiritual gifts, that by them Paul’s ministry might be
beautified and set forth. For it is unlike that Apollos left so few
disciples at Ephesus; and he might have taught them better, since that
he learned the way of the Lord perfectly of Priscilla and Aquila.

<span id="vii.i-p8"></span>Moreover, I do not doubt but that the
brethren of whom Luke spake before were other than these. In sum, when
Paul seeth that these men do profess the name of Christ, to the end he
may have a more certain trial of their faith, he asketh them whether
they have received the Holy Ghost. For it appeareth by Paul himself that
this was a sign and token of the grace of God to establish the credit of
doctrine; I would know of you whether ye received the Holy Ghost by the
works of the law, or by the hearing of faith (<span
id="vii.i-p8.1"></span>[Ga 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#002.md)<span
id="vii.i-p8.1"></span>).

<span id="vii.i-p9"></span>*We know not whether there be any Holy
Ghost.* How could it be, that men being Jews heard nothing of the
Spirit, concerning which the prophets speak everywhere, and whose
commendations and titles are extant in the whole Scripture? Surely we
gather by this that Paul did neither speak generally of the Spirit; and
that these men, as they were asked, did deny that they knew those
visible graces wherewith God had beautified the kingdom of his Son.
Therefore, they confess that they know not whether God give such gifts.
Therefore, there is in the word *Spirit* the figure *metonymia.* And
this sense doth that confirm that if they had altogether denied that
they knew anything concerning the Spirit of God, Paul would not have
passed over with silence such a gross error; yea, an error altogether
monstrous. When he demandeth to what end, or how they were baptized, he
showeth therewithal, that wheresoever Christ had been soundly and
thoroughly preached the visible graces did also appear, that such
worship  <span id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352.md) might be common to all
churches. Wherefore, no marvel if Paul wonder that the faithful are
ignorant of such glory of Christ, which God would have to be apparent
everywhere at that time; and a correction immediately, he telleth them
that they must not stay in those rudiments which they had learned;
because it was John’s office to prepare disciples for Christ.

<span id="vii.i-p11"></span><span id="vii.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p12"></span>**4.** *John truly* Paul’s admonition tended
to this end, that these men being convict of their ignorance might
desire to go forward. He saith that John preached of Christ who was to
come. Therefore he sent out his disciples,  <span
id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353.md) that running in the course they might
go towards Christ who was not as yet revealed. Wherefore, to the end
these men may not flatter themselves, and refuse to go forward, he
showeth that they be yet far from the mark. For the feeling of want doth
enforce men to desire that which is as yet lacking. The sum cometh to
this end, as if Paul had said Before Christ was glorified, this power of
his did not appear  <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354.md) in the
world; when he was ascended into heaven he would have his kingdom to
flourish thus. Therefore the graces of the Spirit were much less shed
out when John was as yet in the course of his embassage, which do now
declare that Christ sitteth at the right hand of his Father forasmuch as
he had not as then openly showed himself to be the Redeemer of the
world. Therefore know ye that you must go farther forward; because ye be
far from the mark. So that he doth plainly show that the faith of the
godly who had been taught by John ought to have looked unto Christ who
was to come, lest these men should stand still being newly entered,
without going any farther.

<span id="vii.i-p15"></span>And even by this also are we taught that the
baptism of John was a token of repentance and remission of sins and that
our baptism at this day doth not differ any thing from it, save only
that Christ is already revealed, and in his death and resurrection our
salvation is made perfect: and so baptism was brought unto his \[its\]
effect; because out of that fountain of Christ’s death and resurrection
whereof I have spoken, floweth repentance, and thither is faith referred
again that it may thence fet \[seek\] free righteousness. In sum, Paul
showeth plainly that that was the baptism of regeneration and renovation
as is ours. And because both purging and newness of life doth flow from
Christ alone he saith that it was grounded in his faith, by which words
we be also taught, that hereupon dependeth all the force of baptism,
that we lay hold upon by faith in Christ whatsoever baptism doth figure;
so far off is it, that the outward sign doth derogate from or diminish
the grace of Christ any iota.

<span id="vii.i-p16"></span><span id="vii.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p17"></span>**5.** *When they heard these things.*
Because the men of old had conceived an opinion that the baptism of John
and of Christ were diverse, it was no inconvenient  <span
id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355.md) thing for them to be baptized again,
who were only prepared with the baptism of John. But that that diversity
was falsely and wickedly by them believed, it appeareth by this, in that
it was a pledge and token of the same adoption, and of the same newness
of life, which we have at this day in our baptism; and, therefore, we do
not read that Christ did baptize those again who came from John unto
him. Moreover, Christ received baptism in his own flesh, that he might
couple himself with us by that visible sign, (<span
id="vii.i-p18.2"></span>[Mt 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#015.md)<span
id="vii.i-p18.2"></span>) but if that reigned diversity be admitted,
this singular benefit shall fall away and perish, that baptism is common
to the Son of God and to us, or that we have all one baptism with him.
But this opinion needeth no long refutation, because to the end they may
persuade that these two baptisms be diverse, they must needs show first
wherein the one differeth from the other; but a most *excellent*
likelihood answereth on both parts, and also the agreement and
conformity of the parts,  <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356.md) which
causeth us to confess that it is all one baptism.

<span id="vii.i-p20"></span>Now the question is, whether it were lawful
to repeat the same; and furious men in this our age; trusting to this
testimony, went about to bring in baptizing again.  <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357.md) Some take baptism for new institution
or instruction, of whose mind I am not, because, as their exposition is
too much racked, so it smelleth of a starting-hole  <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358.md) .

<span id="vii.i-p23"></span>Other some deny that baptism was repeated;
because they were baptized amiss by some foolish enemy  <span
id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359.md) of John. But because their conjecture
hath no color; yea, the words of Paul do rather import that they were
the true and natural disciples of John, and Luke doth honorably call
them disciples of Christ; I do not subscribe to this opinion, and yet
deny that the baptism of water was repeated, because the words of Luke
import no other thing, save only that they were baptized with the
Spirit. First, it is no new thing for the name of baptism to be
translated unto the gifts of the Spirit, as we saw in the first and in
the eleventh chapters, (<span id="vii.i-p24.2"></span>[Ac
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#005.md)<span id="vii.i-p24.2"></span>, and
<span id="vii.i-p24.3"></span>[Ac
11:6](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#006)<span id="vii.i-p24.3"></span>.md)
where Luke said, that when Christ promised to his apostles to send the
Spirit visible, he called it baptism.

<span id="vii.i-p25"></span>Also, that when the Spirit came down upon
Cornelius, Peter remembered the words of the Lord, “Ye shall be baptized
with the Holy Ghost.” Again, we see that those visible gifts are spoken
of by name in this place, and that the same are given with baptism. And
whereas it followeth immediately, that when he had laid his hands upon
them, the Spirit came, I take it to be added by way of interpretation;
for it is a kind of speaking much used in the Scripture, first to set
down a thing briefly, and afterwards to make it more plain. Therefore,
that which by reason of brevity was somewhat obscure, doth Luke better
express and lay more open, saying, that by laying on of hands the Spirit
was given them. If any man object, that when baptism is put for the
gifts of the Spirit, it is not taken simply, but having somewhat added
to it. I answer, that Luke’s meaning doth sufficiently appear by the
text; and again, that Luke doth allude unto the baptism whereof he
spake. And surely if you understand it of the external sign, it shall be
an absurd thing that it was given them without using any better
doctrine. But and if you take it metaphorically for institution, the
speech shall be as yet harsh; and the narration should not agree, that
after they were taught the Holy Ghost came down upon them.

<span id="vii.i-p26"></span>Furthermore, as I confess that this laying
on of hands was a sacrament, so I say that those fell through ignorance
who did continually imitate the same. For seeing that all men agree in
this, that it was a grace which was to last only for a time, which was
showed by that sign, it is a perverse and ridiculous thing to retain the
sign since the truth is taken away. There is another respect of baptism
and the supper, wherein the Lord doth testify that those gifts are laid
open for us, which the Church shall enjoy even until the end of the
world. Wherefore we must diligently and wisely distinguish perpetual
sacraments from those which last only for a time, lest vain and
frivolous visures \[semblances\] have a place among the sacraments.
Whereas the men of old time did use laying on of hands, that they might
confirm the profession of faith in those who were grown up,  <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360.md) I do not mislike it; so that no man
think that the grace of the Spirit is annexed to such a ceremony, as
doth Jerome against the Luciferians.

<span id="vii.i-p28"></span>But the Papists are worthy of no pardon, who
being not content with the ancient rite, durst thrust in rotten and
filthy anointing, that it might be not only a confirmation of baptism,
but also a more worthy sacrament, whereby they imagine that the faithful
are made perfect who were before only half perfect, — whereby those are
armed against the battle, who before had their sins only forgiven them.
For they have not been afraid to spew out these horrible blasphemies.

<span id="vii.ii"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p1"></span><span id="vii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
19:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p2"></span>**8.** And going into the synagogue, he
spake freely about three months, disputing and persuading concerning the
kingdom of God. **9.** And when some waxed hard-hearted that they could
not believe, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, departing
from them he did separate the disciples, and disputed daily in the
school of one Tyrannus. **10.** And this he did by the space of two
years, so that all which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus,
both Jews and Greeks. **11.** And the Lord showed no small miracles by
the hands of Paul. **12.** So that from his body were brought napkins
and partlets unto those that were sick, and the diseases departed from
them, and the evil spirits came out of them.

<span id="vii.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="vii.ii-p4"></span><span id="vii.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p5"></span>**8.** *Going into the synagogue.* By this
we gather that Paul began with the company of the godly, who had already
given their names to Christ. Secondly, that he came into the synagogue,
that he might gather together into one body of the Church the rest of
the Jews who knew not Christ as yet, or at least who had not as yet
received him. And he saith that Paul behaved himself boldly, that we may
know that he was not therefore heard by the space of three months,
because he did craftily cover the doctrine of the gospel, or did
insinuate himself by certain dark crooks. Luke doth also by and by
express some token of boldness, showing that he disputed and persuaded
touching the kingdom of God. And we know that by this word is oftentimes
noted that restoring which was promised to the fathers, and which was to
be fulfilled by the coming of Christ. For seeing that without Christ
there is an evil-favored and confused scattering abroad and ruin of all
things, the prophets did attribute this not in vain to the Mesas who was
to come, that it should come to pass that he should establish the
kingdom of God in the world. And now, because this kingdom doth bring us
back from falling and sliding back, unto the obedience of God, and
maketh us sons of enemies; it consisteth — First in the free forgiveness
of sins, whereby God doth reconcile us to himself, and doth adopt us to
be his people: Secondly, in newness of life, whereby he fashioneth and
maketh us like to his own image. He saith that he disputed and
persuaded, meaning that Paul did so dispute, that he proved that with
sound reasons which he did allege; that done, he used the pricks of
godly exhortations, whereby he pricked forward his hearers.  <span
id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361.md) For no profound disputations  <span
id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362.md) shall make us obedient to God, unless
we be moved with godly admonitions.

<span id="vii.ii-p8"></span><span id="vii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p9"></span>**9.** *Seeing their hearts were hardened.*
We do not read that Paul was heard so patiently and so favorably by the
Jews at any place as at Ephesus at his first coming. For whereas others
raising tumults did drive him away, he was requested by these to tarry
longer. Now, after that he had endeavored, by the space of three months,
to erect the kingdom of God among them, the ungodliness and stubbornness
of many doth show itself. For Luke saith that they were hardened; and
surely such is the power of the heavenly doctrine that it doth either
make the reprobate mad or else more obstinate; and that not of nature,
but accidentally, as they say, because, when they be urged by the truth,
their secret poison breaketh out.

<span id="vii.ii-p10"></span>Luke addeth that they spake evil of the way
before the people. For the contemners of the gospel  <span
id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363.md) do resist that deadlily among others
which they will not embrace. And this do they to no other end, save only
because they be desirous (if it can be) to have all men partners in
their impiety. It is well known that every ordinance is understood by
this word *way;* but here it is referred unto the gospel of Christ. Now,
Luke saith that Paul departed from them, and did separate the brethren,
by which example we are taught, that when we have experience of
desperate and incurable stubbornness, we must lose our labor no longer.
Therefore, Paul admonisheth Titus to avoid a man that is an heretic,
after once or twice admonition (<span id="vii.ii-p11.2"></span>Titus
3:10). For the word of God is unjustly blasphemed,  <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364.md) if it be cast to dogs and swine. Also,
we must provide for the weak, lest through wicked backbitings and
slandering of sound doctrine, their godliness be subverted. Therefore,
Paul did separate the disciples, lest the goats should with their stink
infect the flock of sheep; secondly, that the pure worshippers of God
might make profession freely.

<span id="vii.ii-p13"></span>*Disputing daily.* This place showeth how
continual Paul’s diligence was in teaching; and that they be too
churlish and dainty who are straightway weary of learning. For we see
how few come daily, who are ready and apt to hear. And though he had a
particular care for the household flock which he had gathered as into a
sheepfold, yet he doth not suffer strangers to be destitute of his
industry; but continuing the course of his disputation, he trieth
whether he can find any which are apt to be taught. He calleth it the
school of Tyrannus, meaning no such man as had gotten the government of
Asia; for the Romans bare rule throughout all Asia, but it is to be
thought that the school was built at the charge of one Tyrannus, and
given to the city. Therefore, the faithful did use a public place, which
bare the name of the builder, where they had their assemblies.

<span id="vii.ii-p14"></span><span id="vii.ii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p15"></span>**10.** *All which dwelt.* Luke doth not
mean that the men of Asia came thither to hear Paul; but that the smell
\[savor\] of his preaching went throughout all Asia, and that the seed
was sown far and wide; so that his labor was fruitful not only to one
city, but also to places which were far off; and that cometh to pass
oftentimes, that when the truth of God is preached in one place, it
soundeth where the voice of the minister cannot sound, being spread
abroad far and wide; because it is delivered from hand to hand, and one
doth teach another. For one man were not sufficient, unless every man
were for himself diligent to spread abroad the faith.

<span id="vii.ii-p16"></span><span id="vii.ii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p17"></span>**11.** *No small miracles.* He calleth
miracles *virtutes* or *powers,* after the common custom of the
Scripture, which were testimonies of the extraordinary power of God. And
showeth that Paul’s apostleship was set forth with these ensigns, that
his doctrine might have the greater authority. For it is a common
speech, That wonders and signs are showed by the hand of men. So that
the praise thereof is ascribed to God alone as to the author; and man is
only the minister. And that he may the more amplify the miracles, he
saith that handkerchiefs and partlets  <span
id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365.md) were brought unto the sick, which so
soon as they touched they were healed. It is not unknown  <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366.md) to what end Paul had such power given
him, to wit, that he might prove himself to be a true apostle of Christ,
that he might make the gospel to be believed, and might confirm his
ministry. And here it is expedient to call to mind those things which we
had before, touching the lawful use of miracles. And whereas God did
heal the sick with Paul’s handkerchiefs, it tended to that end, that
even those who had never seen the man might, notwithstanding, reverently
embrace his doctrine, though he himself were absent. For which cause the
Papists are more blockish, who wrest this place unto their relics; as if
Paul sent his handkerchiefs that men might worship them and kiss them
 <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367.md) in honor of them; as in
Papistry, they worship Francis’ shoes and mantle, Rose’s girdle, Saint
Margaret’s comb, and such like trifles. Yea, rather, he did choose most
simple  <span id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368.md) things, lest any
superstition should arise by reason of the price or pomp. For he was
fully determined to keep Christ’s glory sound and undiminished.

<span id="vii.iii"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p1"></span><span id="vii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
19:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013.md)<span
id="vii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p2"></span>**13.** And certain of the vagabond Jews,
exorcists, essayed to name over those which had evil spirits the name of
the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.
**14.** And there were certain sons of Sceva, a Jew, the chief of the
priests, who did this. **15.** And the evil spirit answered and said,
Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? **16.** And the man in
whom the evil spirit was ran upon them, and overcame them, and prevailed
against them, so that they escaped out of that house naked and wounded.
**17.** And this was known to all both Jews and Grecians which dwelt at
Ephesus; and fear came upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was
magnified.

<span id="vii.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="vii.iii-p4"></span><span id="vii.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p5"></span>**13.** To the end it may more plainly
appear that the apostleship of Paul was confirmed by those miracles
whereof mention was made of late, Luke doth now teach that when certain
did falsely pretend the name of Christ, such abuse was most sharply
punished. Whereby we gather that such miracles were wrought by the hand
of Paul, to no other end, save only that all men might know that he did
faithfully preach Christ to be the power of God; forasmuch as the Lord
did not only not suffer them to be separate from the pure doctrine of
the gospel; but did so sharply punish those who did draw them
preposterously unto their enchantments; whence we gather again, that
whatsoever miracles do darken the name of Christ they be juggling casts
of the devil; and that those be coziness and falsifiers who draw the
true miracles of God to any other end, save only that true religion may
be established.  <span id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369.md)

<span id="vii.iii-p7"></span>*Certain exorcists.* I do not doubt but
that this office did proceed of foolish emulation. God was wont to
exercise his power diverse ways among the Jews; and he had used the
prophets in times past as ministers to drive away devils; under color
hereof they invented conjuration,  <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370.md) and hereupon was erected unadvisedly
an extraordinary function without the commandment of God. Also, it may
be that (God appointing it so to be) it did somewhat;  <span
id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371.md) not that he favored it preposterously,
but that they might more willingly retain the religion of their fathers,
until the coming of Christ. Under the reign of Christ, wicked ambition
caused strife between the Christians and the Jews. For exorcists were
made after the will of men; after that (as superstition doth always wax
worse and worse) the Pope would have this common to all his clerks, who
were to be promoted unto an higher degree. For after that they be made
door-keepers, forthwith the conjuring of devils is committed to them;
and by very experience they set themselves to be laughed at. For they
are enforced to confess that they give a vain title, and such as is
without effect, for where is the power they have to conjure devils? and
the very exorcists themselves do take upon them, to their own reproach,
an office which they never put in practice. But this falleth out justly,
that. there is no end of erring, when men depart from the word of God.
As touching these men, we gather that they were wandering rogues, and
such as went from door to door, of which sort we see many at this day in
Popery; for he saith that they went about. By which words he giveth us
to understand, that they went to and fro as occasion was offered them to
deceive men.

<span id="vii.iii-p10"></span>*We adjure you by Jesus.* It is a thing
like to be true, \[probable\] that these deceivers flee unto the name of
Christ, that they might get new power, whereof they had falsely boasted
before, or because the power which they had did cease, that they might
darken the gospel. This invocation had two faults; for whereas they were
enemies  <span id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372.md) to Paul’s doctrine,
they abuse the color thereof without faith, as it were, unto magical
enchantments; secondly, they take to themselves without the calling of
God that which is not in man’s hand. But the lawful calling upon the
name of God and Christ is that which is directed by faith, and doth not
pass the bounds of a man’s calling. Wherefore, we are taught by this
example, that we must attempt nothing, unless we have the light of the
word of God going before us, lest we suffer like punishment for our
sacrilege. The Lord himself commandeth us to pray. Whosoever they be
which have not the gift of miracles given them, let them keep themselves
within these bounds. For when the apostles made the unclean spirits come
out of men, they had God for their author, and they knew that they did
faithfully execute the ministry which he had enjoined them.

<span id="vii.iii-p12"></span><span id="vii.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p13"></span>**16.** *The man running upon them.* That
is attributed to the man which the devil did by him. For he had not been
able to do such an act of himself, as to put to flight seven strong
young men being wounded and naked. And to set down for a certainty how
the devil doth dwell in men, we cannot, save only that there may be
 <span id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373.md) a contrariety between the
Spirit of God and the spirit of Satan. For as Paul teacheth that we be
the temples of God, because the Spirit of God dwelleth in us; so he
saith again that Satan worketh effectually in all unbelievers.
Notwithstanding, we must know that Luke speaketh in this place of a
particular kind of dwelling; to wit, when Satan hath the bridle so much
that he doth possess the whole man.

<span id="vii.iii-p15"></span>Furthermore, God meant to show such a
token, that he might declare that his power is not included in the sound
of the voice, and that it is not lawful superstitiously to abuse the
name of his Son. And when he suffereth Satan to deceive us, let us know
that we be more sharply punished than if he should wound us in the
flesh. For the false show and color of miracles is an horrible
enchantment to bewitch and besot the unbelievers, that they may be
drowned in deeper darkness, because they refused the light of God.

<span id="vii.iii-p16"></span><span id="vii.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p17"></span>**17.** *There came fear.* The fruit of
that vengeance which God brought upon those who did wickedly abuse the
name of Christ is this, in that they were all touched with reverence,
lest they should contemn that doctrine, whose revenger the Lord hath
showed by an evident token and testimony he would be, and they were
brought to reverence Christ. For, besides that God doth invite us by all
his judgments to come thus far, that they may terrify us from sinning,
in this example peculiarly was the majesty of Christ set forth, and the
authority of the gospel established. Wherefore, there is more heavy and
grievous punishment prepared for deceivers, who, with their
enchantments, profane the name of Christ wittingly, lest they promise to
themselves that they shall escape unpunished for such gross sacrilege.
Whereas he saith that it was made known to all men, it signifieth as
much as commonly or everywhere. For his meaning is, that the matter was
much talked of among the people, to the end the name of Christ might be
made known to more men.

<span id="vii.iv-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Acts
19:18-22](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018.md)<span id="vii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p2"></span>**18.** And many of those which believed
came, confessing, and showing their works. **19.** And many of those
which used curious arts, bringing their books, burnt them before them
all; and when they had cast the price of them, they found it fifty
thousand pieces of silver. **20.** So mightily grew the word of the
Lord, and was confirmed. **21.** And when these things were
accomplished, Paul purposed in spirit, having passed over Macedonia and
Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After that I have been there, I must
also see Rome. **22.** And when he had sent two of those which
ministered to him into Macedonia, to wit, Timotheus and Erastus, he
stayed for a time in Asia.

<span id="vii.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv-p4"></span><span id="vii.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p5"></span>**18.** *Many which believed.* Luke bringeth
forth one token of that fear whereof he spake. For they did indeed
declare that they were thoroughly touched and moved with the fear of
God, who, of their own accord, did confess the faults and offenses of
their former life, lest, through their dissimulation, they should
nourish the wrath of God within. We know what a hard matter it is to
wring true confession out of those who have offended, for seeing men
count nothing more precious than their estimation, they make more
account of shame than of truth; yea, so much as in them lieth, they seek
to cover their shame. Therefore, this voluntary confession was a
testimony of repentance and of fear. For no man, unless he be thoroughly
touched, will make himself subject to the slanders and reproaches of
men, and will willingly be judged upon earth, that he may be loosed and
acquitted in heaven. When he saith, *Many,* by this we gather that they
had not all one cause, for it may be that these men had corrupt
consciences a long time; as many are oftentimes infected with hidden and
inward vices. Wherefore, Luke doth not prescribe all men a common law;
but he setteth before them an example which those must follow who need
like medicine. For why did these men confess their facts, save only that
they might give testimony of their repentance, and seek counsel and ease
at Paul’s hands? It was otherwise with those who came unto the baptism
of John, confessing their sins (<span id="vii.iv-p5.1"></span>[Mt
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#006)<span id="vii.iv-p5.1"></span>.md).
For by this means they did confess that they did enter into repentance
without dissimulation.

<span id="vii.iv-p6"></span>But in this place Luke teacheth by one kind,
after what sort the faithful were touched with the reverence of God,
when God set before them an example of his severity. For which cause the
impudence of the Papists is the greater, who color their tyranny by this
fact. For wherein doth their auricular confession agree  <span
id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374.md) with this example? First, the faithful
confessed how miserably they had been deceived by Satan before they came
to the faith, bringing into the sight of men certain examples. But by
the Pope’s law it is required that men reckon up all their words and
deeds and thoughts. We read that those men confessed this once; the
Pope’s law commandeth that it be repeated every year at least. These men
made confession of their own accord; the Pope bindeth all men with
necessity. Luke saith there came many, not all; in the Pope’s law there
is no exception. These men humbled themselves before the company of the
faithful; the Pope giveth a far other commandment, that the sinner
confess his sins, whispering in the ear of one priest.  <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375.md) Lo, how well they apply  <span
id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376.md) the Scriptures to prove their
subtilities.

<span id="vii.iv-p10"></span><span id="vii.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p11"></span>**19.** *Who used curious crafts.* Luke
doth not only speak of magical jugglings, but of frivolous and vain
studies, whereof the more part of men is for the most part too desirous.
For he useth the word, <span id="vii.iv-p11.1"></span>περιεργα, under
which the Grecians comprehend whatsoever things have in themselves no
sound commodity, but lead men’s minds and studies through diverse crooks
unprofitably. Such is judicial astrology, as they call it, and
whatsoever divinations men  <span id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377.md)
invent to themselves against the time to come. They burn their books,
that they may cut off all occasion of erring, both for themselves and
for others. And whereas the greatness of the price doth not call them
back from endamaging themselves so much, they do thereby better declare
the study \[zeal\] of their godliness. Therefore, as Luke did of late
describe their confession in words, so now he setteth down the
confession they make in deeds. But because the Grecians take <span
id="vii.iv-p12.2"></span>αργυριον for all kind of money, it is uncertain
whether Luke doth speak of pence or sestertians.  <span
id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378.md) Notwithstanding, because it is certain
that he expressed a sum, that we might know that the faithful did
valiantly contemn gain, I do nothing doubt but that he meaneth pence, or
some other better kind of coin.  <span id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379.md)
And fifty thousand pence (denarii) make about nine thousand pound of
French money \[French livres\].

<span id="vii.iv-p15"></span><span id="vii.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p16"></span>**20.** *Grew mightily* \[*lions.*\] The
word <span id="vii.iv-p16.1"></span>κατα κρατος doth signify that the
word increased not a little, (or that these proceedings were not common)
as if he should say, that in those increasings appeared rare efficacy,
and such as was greater than it used commonly to be. The word *grew* do
I refer unto the number of men, as if he should have said, that the
Church was increased, new disciples being gathered together dally,
because doctrine is spread abroad. And I interpret that, that the word
was confirmed in every one thus, to wit, that they did profit in the
obedience of the gospel and in godliness more and more, and that their
faith took deeper root.

<span id="vii.iv-p17"></span><span id="vii.iv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p18"></span>**21.** *He purposed in spirit.* His
meaning is, that Paul purposed to take his journey through the instinct
and motion of the Spirit; that we may know that all his whole life was
framed according to God’s will and pleasure. And therefore hath he the
Spirit to be the governor of his actions, because he did both give over
himself by him to be ruled, and did also depend upon his government.
Neither skilleth that which followeth, that he had not that success in
his journey which he did hope for; for God doth oftentimes govern and
rule his faithful servants, suffering them to be ignorant of the end.
 <span id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380.md) For he will have them so far
forth addicted to him, that they follow that which he hath showed them
by his Spirit, even shutting their eyes when matters be doubtful.
Moreover, it is certain that he was wholly addicted to profit the
churches, omitting and foreslowing \[neglecting\] his own commodity, in
that he had rather deprive himself of Timotheus, a most excellent to him
of all, most faithful, most dear, finally, a most fit companion, than
not to provide for the Macedonians.

<span id="vii.v"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p1"></span><span id="vii.v-p1.1"></span>[Acts
19:23-28](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#023.md)<span id="vii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p2"></span>**23.** And at that time there happened no
small tumult about that way. **24.** For a certain man named Demetrius,
a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small
gains to the men of that occupation; **25.** Whom, when he had called
together, and those who were makers of like things, he said, Men, ye
know that by this craft we have advantage.  <span
id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381.md) **26.** And ye see and hear that not
only at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath
persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be not gods
which are made with hands: **27.** And not only this part cometh in
danger to us, lest it be set at nought; but also test the temple of the
great goddess Diana be despised, and it come to pass that her majesty be
destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth. **28.** When they
heard these things, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying,
Great is Diana of the Ephesians.

<span id="vii.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.v-p5"></span><span id="vii.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p6"></span>**23.** *Tumult about that way.* Concerning
this word *way,* let the readers understand thus much, that it is here
taken for that which the Latins call *sect;* the Greek philosophers call
it *heresies* or *heresy.* But because in the Church of God, where the
unity of faith ought to reign, there is nothing more odious or
detestable than for every man to choose, at his pleasure, that which he
will follow, I think that Luke did fly that name which was, for good
causes, infamous among the godly, and that after the Hebrew phrase, he
put *way* instead of *ordinance.* And as touching the sum of the matter,
we see how wonderfully the Lord did exercise his servant. He did hope
when he did address himself for his journey, that the Church would be
quiet after his departure, and, lo, there ariseth an uproar at a sudden
where he did least fear. But in Demetrius it appeareth what a hurtful
plague covetousness is. For one man, for his own gain’s sake, is not
afraid  <span id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382.md) to trouble a whole city
with sedition. And the craftsmen, who were as firebrands kindled by him,
and do spread abroad the fire everywhere, do teach us what an easy
matter it is to cause filthy \[sordid\] men, and whose belly is their
God, to commit all manner \[of\] wickedness; especially if they live
only by gains evil gotten,  <span id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383.md) and
the hope of gain be taken from them.

<span id="vii.v-p9"></span>Moreover, in his history we see a lively
image of our time. Demetrius and his band raised a tumult; because, if
superstition whereby they were wont to get gains be taken away, their
craft will fall to the ground. Therefore they fight as if it were for
their life, lest Demetrius go without his fat prey, and the rest want
their daily living. What zeal doth at this day prick forward the Pope,
the horned bishops, the monks, and all the rabblement of the Popish
clergy? Yea, what fury doth drive them so sore  <span
id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md) to resist the gospel? They boast that
they strive for the Catholic faith; neither did Demetrius want an honest
color, pretending the worship of Diana. But the matter itself doth
plainly declare that they fight not so much for the altars as for the
fires, to wit, that they may have hot kitchens. They can well wink at
filthy blasphemies against God, so they lack nothing of their revenues,
only they are more than courageous in maintaining such superstitions as
are meetest for their purpose.  <span id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md)

<span id="vii.v-p12"></span>Therefore, being taught by such examples,
let us learn to make choice of such a kind of life as is agreeable to
the doctrine of Christ; lest desire of gain  <span
id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386.md) a provoke us to enter a wicked and
ungodly combat. And as for those who, through ignorance or error, are
fallen unto any ungodly occupation, or are entangled in any other impure
and wicked kind of life, let them, notwithstanding, beware of such
sacrilegious rashness. And as touching godly teachers, let them learn by
this example, that they shall never want adversaries, until the whole
world, through denial of itself, offer peace, which we know will never
come to pass. Because Paul’s doctrine taketh away Demetrius and the rest
of the silversmiths’ gains, they leap out furiously to put out
\[destroy\] the same, will not they do the same whom the gospel shall
contrary? But there is no man who hath not occasion to fight. For all
the affections of the flesh are enemies to God. So that it must needs
be, that how many lusts of the flesh there be \[reign\] in the world,
there are as many armed enemies to resist Christ. It will, indeed,
oftentimes fall out, that God will bridle the wicked, lest they raise
some tumult, or break out into open rage. Yet, whosoever is not tamed
and brought down to bear Christ’s yoke, he shall always hate his gospel.
So that faithful and godly teachers must persuade themselves that they
shall always have to deal with great store of enemies. Demetrius’
covetousness is manifest. Nevertheless, we must also know this, that he
was Satan’s fan, \[bellows\] who, seeking by all means to overthrow
Paul’s doctrine, found this fit instrument. Now, forasmuch as we know
that Satan is a deadly enemy to Christ and the truth, do we think that
he shall ever want ministers, who shall rage through his motion and
persuasion, either with open rage, or else seek to work the overthrow of
the gospel by secret practices, or spew out the poison of their hatred,
or else, at least, show some token of enmity by fretting and murmuring?

<span id="vii.v-p14"></span><span id="vii.v-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p15"></span>**25.** *By this craft.* Demetrius doth in
this place filthily betray his malice. It is lawful for a man, in some
measure, to provide for his private profit; but to trouble common \[the
public\] peace for a man’s own gain, to overthrow  <span
id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387.md) equity and right, to give over a man’s
self to do violence and commit murder, to extinguish that of set purpose
which is just and right; that is too great wickedness. Demetrius
confesseth that this is the state of the cause, because, \[viz. that\]
Paul denieth that those are gods which are made with men’s hands. He
doth not inquire whether this be true or no; but being blinded with a
desire to get gain, he is carried headlong to oppress true doctrine. The
same blindness doth drive him headlong to seek violent remedies. Also
the craftsmen, because they be afraid of poverty and hunger, run
headlong as violently; for the belly is blind and deaf, so that it can
admit no equity. For which cause, every one of us ought more to suspect
himself, when the question is touching our own gain and profit, lest the
same covetous desire which made these men so mad take away all
difference of justice and injustice, of that which is filthy and that
which is honest.

<span id="vii.v-p17"></span><span id="vii.v-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p18"></span>**27.** *Not only this part.* This is first
disorderly handled in  <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388.md) that
Demetrius is careful for religion after other things;  <span
id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389.md) because nothing is more absurd than to
prefer the belly before the goddess; but even this is also vain, in that
he pretendeth that the worship of Diana is in hazard. For if he had
suffered no loss by Paul’s doctrine, he would have sat quietly at home;
he would neither have taken thought for the worship of Diana, neither
would he have troubled others. What is the cause, then, he is so
diligent and so earnest in his business? even this, because he was
plagued at home; and because he saw that he and his copartners had no
honest or probable cause to make any stir, he goeth about to color
\[gloss\] the matter with some other color. Therefore, to the end he may
cover the shame of his wicked fact, he cloaketh it with the title of
religion, which is plausible. So that the wicked, howsoever they strive
frowardly against God, yet they gather here and there honest excuses
 <span id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390.md) impudently; but God doth not
suffer himself to be mocked, but doth rather pull them out of their
starting-holes \[subterfuges\]. There needeth no other witness to refute
Demetrius’ hypocrisy, because he cutteth his own throat with his own
words, when he betrayeth the sorrow which he had conceived, because of
the loss which he sustained.  <span id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391.md) In
like state do the Papists stand at this day; they boast with full mouth
that they be patrons of the Catholic faith and of the holy mother the
Church, but when they have spoken  <span
id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392.md) thus touching their zeal, in the very
handling of the cause they breathe out with open throat the smell of
their kitchens. But if we have a desire to handle the cause of godliness
purely and in earnest, let us forget our commodities, that the glory of
God may have the chief place. For the show of profit doth so tie all our
senses with enticements, that though we wander through all manner of
wickedness, yet do we flatter ourselves so long as we be determined to
provide for our own commodity.

<span id="vii.v-p24"></span>*Whom all Asia and the world doth worship.*
It seemeth to Demetrius an unmeet thing that Diana her majesty should be
brought to naught, which all the world doth reverence and worship, and
this is a common starting-hole \[subterfuge\] for all superstitious
persons, to pretend the consent of the multitude. But true religion
requireth a more steadfast stay than in the will and pleasure of men.
There is nothing which at this day doth more keep back the simple and
unskillful than that they dare not cast from them (such ancient) errors
as are commonly received everywhere. Because they feign and imagine that
that which pleased many, though foolishly and rashly, is to be counted
lawful. For which cause they be not afraid boldly to set the very name
of custom against God himself. But the Lord doth prescribe to us another
manner of rule, to wit, that being content with his authority alone, we
do not pass either for the opinion of men, nor for our own commodity,
nor for the custom of many nations.

<span id="vii.vi"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p1"></span><span id="vii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Acts
19:29-34](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029.md)<span id="vii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p2"></span>**29.** And all the city was full of
confusion. And they rushed into the commonplace \[theater\] with one
consent, having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s
companions. **30.** And when Paul would have entered in unto the people,
the disciples would not suffer him. **31.** And certain also of the
chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, requesting him
that he would not enter into the place, \[theater\]. **32.** Some
therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was out of
order, and the more part knew not for what cause they came together.
**33.** And some of the company drew forth Alexander, the Jews thrusting
him forward. And when Alexander had required silence with the hand, he
would have excused the matter  <span id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393.md)
to the people. **34.** Whom when they knew to be a Jew, there arose a
shout of all men almost for the space of two hours, crying, Great is
Diana of the Ephesians.

<span id="vii.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.vi-p5"></span><span id="vii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p6"></span>**29.** Luke setteth down in this place the
nature of the people, as if it were depainted in a table.  <span
id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md) Like as if a thousand houses should be
set on fire at a sudden, so all the city was on an uproar in one moment;
and when such a tempest is once raised, it is not easily stayed. And
forasmuch as the servants of Christ cannot avoid this mischief, they
must be armed with invincible constancy, that they may boldly suffer the
tumults raised among the people, and that they may not be troubled as
with some new and strange matter, when they see that the people is
unquiet. So Paul himself doth elsewhere triumph that he went valiantly
through the midst of sedition (<span id="vii.vi-p7.2"></span>[2Co
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#005)<span id="vii.vi-p7.2"></span>.md).
Nevertheless, the Lord doth uphold the ministers of his word with an
excellent comfort, when as they be tossed amidst diverse storms and
garboils, and with excellent boldness doth he establish them, when he
doth testify that he holdeth the helm of his Church; and not that only,
but that he is the governor and moderator of all tumults and storms, so
that he can stay the same so soon as it seemeth good to him. Therefore,
let us know that we must sail as it were in a tempestuous sea; yet that
we must suffer this infamy, as if we ourselves were the procurers of
trouble?  <span id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md) neither may anything
lead us away from the right course of our duty. So that in sailing we
shall be sore troubled; yet will not the Lord suffer us to suffer
shipwreck. Furthermore, we see that though sedition be confused, yet
doth the people always take the worse part; as the men of Ephesus do now
catch Gains and Aristarchus, and they drive back Alexander with their
furious outcries. Whence cometh this, save only because Satan doth reign
in their hearts, so that they rather favor an evil cause? There is also
another reason, because a prejudice conceived upon a false report doth
possess their minds, so that they cannot abide to sift the cause any
farther.

<span id="vii.vi-p9"></span><span id="vii.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p10"></span>**30.** *And when Paul would.* We may see
that Paul’s constancy was coupled with modesty. When as he might well
have kept himself out of sight, of his own accord was he prepared to put
himself in hazard. And yet he doth not refuse to follow their counsel,
who knew the state of matters better than he. If he had not been kept
back, that which he determined to do could not have been imputed to
rashness. There was no sedition raised through his fault. Why should he
not venture his life, especially seeing that he did not despair of
better success? But when the brethren, and such friends as were more
skillful, dissuade him, his modesty is worthy to be commended, in that
he doth not stand stoutly in his purpose.

<span id="vii.vi-p11"></span><span id="vii.vi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p12"></span>**33.** *They drew out Alexander.* It is to
be thought that the Jews did not send forth this Alexander to plead the
common cause of the nation, but that they were desirous to bring him
before the people that he might be murdered. Nevertheless, the name Jew
made him to be so hated, that they did outrageously refuse whatsoever he
was about to speak in the matter and cause; yea, he did hardly escape
with his life in such an uproar. Moreover, it is uncertain whether this
be that Alexander of whom Paul maketh mention elsewhere, (<span
id="vii.vi-p12.1"></span>[1Ti
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#020.md)<span id="vii.vi-p12.1"></span>;
and <span id="vii.vi-p12.2"></span>[2Ti
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#014)<span id="vii.vi-p12.2"></span>.md)
yet the conjecture seemeth to me allowable. But and if we believe that
it is he, let us learn by this fearful example to walk circumspectly,
lest Satan carry us away into like falling away \[defection\]. For we
see that he who was at the point to suffer martyrdom, became a
treacherous and wicked revolt \[apostate\].

<span id="vii.vi-p13"></span><span id="vii.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p14"></span>**34.** *Great is Diana of the Ephesians.*
This was a clamorous confession, but without any soundness; neither did
it proceed from the faith of the heart. For whence came that great
divinity of Diana whereof they spake, save only because like mad men
they furiously defend that error which they had once received? It fareth
otherwise with true godliness, that we believe with the heart unto
righteousness, and then doth the confession of the mouth follow to
salvation. Therein doth the distemperature and mad stubbornness of all
mad men and brain-sick fools differ from the constancy and zeal of the
martyrs. And yet, notwithstanding, our sluggishness is shameful if we be
not as ready and stout in the confession of a sure faith as are they in
their filthy error. For we see what the Spirit of God prescribeth unto
us by the mouth of David,

<span id="vii.vi-p15"></span>*“*I believed, and therefore will I speak,”
(<span id="vii.vi-p15.1"></span>[Ps
116:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#010.md)<span
id="vii.vi-p15.1"></span>).

<span id="vii.vii"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p1"></span><span id="vii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
19:35-40](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035.md)<span
id="vii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p2"></span>**35.** And when the town-clerk had
pacified the multitude, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is he that
knoweth not the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great
goddess Diana, and of the image that came down from Jupiter? **36.** And
seeing these things are out of question, you must be quiet, and do
nothing rashly. **37.** For ye have brought men which are neither
church-robbers, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess. **38.** But and if
Demetrius and the craftsmen that are with him have a matter against any
man, there be open assemblies, and there be deputies: let them accuse
one another. **39.** But and if there be any other matter in question,
it shall be decided in a lawful assembly. **40.** For it is to be
doubted  <span id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md) lest we be accused of
this day’s sedition, seeing there is no cause whereby we may give a
reason of this concourse. And when he had thus spoken, he let the
assembly depart.

<span id="vii.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.vii-p5"></span><span id="vii.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p6"></span>**35.** Luke showeth in this place that the
tumult was so appeased, that yet, notwithstanding, superstition
prevailed with the mad people, and the truth of God was not heard. For
the town-clerk, as politic men use to do, counteth it sufficient for him
if he can by any means appease the outrageous multitude. Nevertheless,
the cause itself is oppressed. He saw undoubtedly Demetrius’ malice, and
how he had troubled the city, abusing the pretense of religion for his
own private gain; but he toucheth not that wound which he knew to be
unknown to the unskillful. Nevertheless, to the end he may stay the
uproar and contention, he extolleth the reigned power of Diana, and
maintaineth her superstitious worship. If Paul had been in the common
place  <span id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md) at that time, he would
rather have suffered death an hundred times than have suffered himself
to be delivered from danger paying so dear for it. For though the
town-clerk had not been by him commanded to speak thus, yet it should
have been treacherous dissimulation in a public witness and preacher of
heavenly doctrine. The scribe affirmeth that the image which the
Ephesians did worship came down from heaven, and that Paul and his
companions spake no blasphemy against their goddess. Could he have
holden his peace, but he must needs by his silence have allowed his
false excuse? And this had been to shake hands with idolatry. Therefore,
it was not without cause that Luke said before that Paul was kept back
by the brethren, and not suffered to enter into the common place
\[theater\].

<span id="vii.vii-p9"></span>**37.** *Men which are neither
church-robbers.* He doth both truly and well deny that they be
church-robbers; but he doth shortly after falsely define the kind of
church-robbery to speak blasphemously against Diana. For seeing that all
superstition is profane and polluted, it followeth that those be
sacrilegious persons who translate the honor which is due to God alone
unto idols. But the wisdom of the town-clerk, and that carnal, is here
commended, and not his godliness. For he had respect unto this alone to
extinguish the heat of the uproar; and therefore doth he at length
conclude, if Demetrius have any private matter, there be judgment-seats
and magistrates. And that public affairs must be handled in a lawful,
and not in a disordered assembly — in an assembly gathered by the
commandment of the magistrates, and not in a concourse which is without
consideration, run together through the motion of one man, and to
satisfy his appetite.  <span id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md) He
calleth them deputies,  <span id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399.md) in the
plural number, not that Asia had more than one, but because legates did
sometimes keep courts in the place of the deputies. Also, he appeaseth
them by putting them in fear, because the deputy had occasion offered to
punish and fine the city sore.  <span id="fr_400"></span>[401](#fn_400.md)
