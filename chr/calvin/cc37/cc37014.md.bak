<span id="xv-p1"></span>Chapter 27

<span id="xv.i"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p1"></span><span id="xv.i-p1.1"></span>[Acts
27:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#001.md)<span id="xv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p2"></span>**1.** And after that it was decreed that we
should sail into Italy, they delivered both Paul and also certain other
prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the band of Augustus. **2.**
And we entered into a ship of Adramyttium, purposing to sail by the
coasts of Asia, and we launched forth, having Aristarchus of Macedonia,
a Thessalonian, with us. **3.** And the next day we arrived at Sidon,
and Julius did courteously intreat Paul, and suffered him to go to his
friends, that they might refresh him. **4.** And when we were gone
thence, we sailed hard by Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
**5.** And when we had sailed on the sea which is over against Cilicia
and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. **6.** And when the
centurion had found there a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, he
put us in it. **7.** And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were
scarce come over against Cnidus, because the wind did let us, we sailed
hard by Crete, beside Salmone; **8.** And with much ado we sailed beyond
it, and came to a certain place which is called The fair havens, near
unto which was the city of Lasea.

<span id="xv.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xv.i-p4"></span><span id="xv.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p5"></span>**1.** Luke setteth down Paul’s voyage by sea
most of all to this end, that we may know that he was brought to Rome
wonderfully by the hand of God; and that the glory of God did many ways
appear excellent in his doings and sayings even in the very journey,
which did more establish his apostleship. He is delivered to be carried
with other prisoners; but the Lord doth afterward put great difference
between him and the evil-doers, who were in bonds as well as he. Yea,
moreover, we shall see how the captain doth loose him, and let him be at
liberty, when the rest lie bound. I know not what band that was which
Luke calleth the band of Augustus, unless, peradventure, it be that
which was commonly called the praetor’s  <span
id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632.md) band, before the monarchy of the
Caesars. And Luke setteth down in plain words, that they were put in a
ship of Adramyttium; because they should sail by the coast of Asia. For
Adramyttium is a city of Aeolia. I cannot tell out of what haven they
launched. Because they could not sail with a straight course to Sidon,
unless the maps do greatly deceive me, we may well guess that they were
brought thither, either because they could find a ship nowhere else, or
else because they were to take the other prisoners, of whom mention is
made, out of that region.

<span id="xv.i-p7"></span><span id="xv.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p8"></span>**2.** *And there continued with us.* Luke
seemeth so to commend one man’s constancy, that he nippeth the rest. For
there were more which did accompany him to Jerusalem; whereof we see two
only which remained with him. But because it may be that the rest were
letted with some just causes, or that Paul refused to have them to
minister unto him, I will say nothing either way. Neither is it an
unmeet thing to say  <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633.md) that Luke
had some special reason for which he doth commend this man above the
rest, albeit he was but one of many. Surely, it is likely that he was a
rich man, seeing he was able to bear the charges whereat he was by the
space of three years, having left his house. For we heard before (<span
id="xv.i-p9.2"></span>[Ac 17:11](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#011.md)<span
id="xv.i-p9.2"></span>) that many of the chief families in Thessalonica
did receive Christ, and Luke saith, for honor’s sake, that Aristarchus
and Secundus came with Paul into Asia (<span id="xv.i-p9.3"></span>[Ac
20:4](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#004)<span id="xv.i-p9.3"></span>.md).
Therefore, let it suffice us to hold that which is certain and good to
be known, that there is set before us an example of holy patience,
because Aristarchus is not wearied with any trouble, but doth willingly
take part with Paul in his trouble,  <span
id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634.md) and after that he had been in prison
with him two years, he doth now cross the seas, that he may likewise
minister to him at Rome, not without the reproachings of many, besides
the loss of his goods at home, and so great charges.

<span id="xv.i-p11"></span><span id="xv.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p12"></span>**3.** *He suffered him to go to.* Paul might
have hid himself  <span id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635.md) in a large
city, which joined to the sea; but he was bound with the oracle, that he
could not withdraw himself from the calling of God. Again, because the
centurion had so courteously entertained him, that he suffered him to go
to his friends, that they might dress and refresh him, whom he might
have left in the stinking ship,  <span id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636.md)
he ought not nor could he provide for his own life, with the other man’s
danger, without filthy treachery.  <span
id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md) Neither must we in any case suffer
those who have courteously intreated us to be deceived by their courtesy
through our fault. Let the readers fet \[seek\] the voyage whereof Luke
speaketh out of those which describe places and countries;  <span
id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md) only I say thus much, that all that
which is said tendeth to this end, that we may know that their sailing
was dangerous and tempestuous, after that they were once gone out of the
haven of Sidon, until they came near to Melita; and that afterward the
mariners did strive long time with contrary winds, until a cruel storm
 <span id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md) arose, whose end was shipwreck,
as we shall see.

<span id="xv.ii"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p1"></span><span id="xv.ii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
27:9-20](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#009.md)<span id="xv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p2"></span>**9.** And when much time was spent, and when
sailing was now jeopardous, because all the time of fasting was now
passed, Paul admonished them, **10.** Saying unto them, Sirs, I see that
this voyage will be with hurt and great loss, not only of the burthen
and of the ship, but also of our souls, \[lives\]. **11.** But the
centurion believed rather the governor and the master of the ship, than
those things which were spoken of Paul. **12.** And because the haven
was unfit to winter in, many took counsel to depart thence, if by any
means they might come to Phenice, and there winter. That is a haven of
Candia, and lieth toward the south-west and by west, and north-west and
by west. **13.** And when the south wind blew softly, supposing to
obtain their purpose, when they had loosed nearer, they sailed beyond
Candia. **14.** But not long after there arose over against it a stormy
wind, which is called Euroclydon. **15.** And when the ship was caught,
and could not resist the wind, we let her go, and were carried away.
**16.** And when we were carried into a certain isle called Candia,
\[Clauda\] we could scarce get the boat: **17.** Which they took up, and
used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall
into syrtes, \[quicksands\] they strake sail, and so were carried.
**18.** And when we were tossed with an exceeding tempest, on the morrow
they lightened the ship; **19.** And the third day we cast out with our
own hands the tackling of the ship. **20.** Furthermore, when neither
sun nor stars appeared now many days, and no small tempest lay upon us,
all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.

<span id="xv.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xv.ii-p4"></span><span id="xv.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p5"></span>**9.** *When sailing was now jeopardous.* He
doth not only mean that the winds were contrary then, but also that the
time of the year was not then commodious, which he expresseth more
plainly afterward, when he saith that the fast was passed; for I think
that this word was added by way of exposition, to note the end of
harvest. Neither do I pass for that, that that solemn time of fasting,
whereof Luke speaketh, was strange to the centurion and the rest of the
mariners; for he noteth out the times of the year according to the
custom of the Jews. Furthermore, we need not doubt but that it was the
harvest \[autumnal\] fast. Though I am not of their mind who think that
it was one of the four fasts which the Jews did appoint after the
carrying away into Babylon. For Luke would not have put down simply,
without adding any distinction, the third fast, which was in the seventh
month, seeing it was not more famous than the rest, being commanded to
be kept because of the death of Godolia, and because of the destruction
of the rest of the people. Again, I cannot tell whether that custom were
retained by the people after their return. It is more likely that he
meaneth the feast of the atonement, wherein the Lord commanded them to
humble their souls seven days. And they began the tenth day of the
seventh month; whereto partly September and partly October doth now
agree (<span id="xv.ii-p5.1"></span>[Le
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#029)<span id="xv.ii-p5.1"></span>.md).
Therefore, seeing they were now entered into October, it is said, not
without cause, that sailing was jeopardous at that time. But and if you
refer it unto hunger, (as some do) I do not see what sense can be
gathered thence; for they had as yet store of wheat in the ship, so that
they needed not to be hunger starved. And why should he say that the
time of the voluntary fast was passed? Moreover, it shall hereafter
appear by the text, that they were, therefore, exhorted by Paul to stay
because winter was at hand, whose sharpness \[severity\] useth to shut
up the seas. For though he were assured that God would govern the ship,
yet he would not tempt him rashly by making too great haste.

<span id="xv.ii-p6"></span><span id="xv.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p7"></span>**11.** *But the centurion.* The centurion is
not reproved because he hearkened rather to the master and governor of
the ship than to Paul. For what should he have done? For though he did
well like  <span id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) Paul’s counsel in
other matters, yet he knew that he was unskillful in sailing. Therefore
he suffered himself to be governed by those which were expert, which was
a point of a wise and modest man. Yea, very necessity did almost compel
him to do this; for the haven was not commodious to winter in. Neither
did the governor give counsel to commit the ship to the main sea, but to
thrust into the next haven, which was almost in view. So that, with
taking a little pains, they might commodiously pass the winter. Luke
reciteth this not in vain; but that we may know that Paul was from the
beginning furnished with the sense of the Spirit, so that he did better
see what things were profitable than did the masters. We know not
whether he were taught by oracles, or whether he gave this counsel
through secret inspiration. This is certain, that it served afterward to
his commendation. Furthermore, in that he saith that they sailed beyond
the coast of Candia, until they were caught and carried away; our friend
Beza doth justly reprove the error of interpreters in this word <span
id="xv.ii-p8.2"></span>ασσον, who make of an adverb the name of a city.

<span id="xv.ii-p9"></span><span id="xv.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p10"></span>**15.** *When the ship was caught.* Luke
saith that that fell out here, which useth to fall out in extreme
danger; namely, they suffered themselves to be carried of the winds.
Seeing they were first gone some space, and the mariners thought that
all things fell out as they would have it, undoubtedly they did deride
Paul’s admonition; as rash men use commonly to wax proud if fortune
favor them. Being now caught, they are grievously punished for their
boldness; yea, when they drew near to an haven,  <span
id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) they were no less afraid lest they
should break the ship, than they were before of overturning the same.
Luke doth diligently note all these things, out of which we may gather,
that the storm was so vehement and fierce, and that it continued still
at one stay, that they were still in danger of death. Also he declareth,
that they did courageously use all remedies which might save them from
suffering shipwreck, and that they spared not the merchandise and
tackling; whence we gather that they were enforced, with a lively
feeling of danger, to do what they were able. And Luke addeth, that when
they had essayed all things, they despaired of their safety. And surely
the very darkness of heaven was as it were a grave. Neither need we
doubt but that the Lord meant by this means to commend and make more
notable the grace of their deliverance which ensued shortly after.
Nevertheless, he suffered his servant to labor with the rest, until he
thought he should die. For he did not appear unto him by his angel,
before it might seem that he was past hope of recovery. Wherefore his
body was not only tossed amidst many storms, but his soul was also
shaken with violent tentations. Notwithstanding the end doth show, that
he stood upright by faith, so that he did not faint. Luke speaketh
nothing of his prayers; but because he himself saith afterward that the
angel of God, whom he served, appeared to him, it is likely that when
others did curse both heaven and earth, he made his prayers to God, and
so was quiet, and did patiently tarry the Lord’s leisure. And whereas he
saith that all hope of safety was taken away, it must not be referred
unto his sense, but only unto the means which men could use;  <span
id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md) as if he should say, that things were
so far out of order, that there was no safety to be looked for at men’s
hands.

<span id="xv.iii"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p1"></span><span id="xv.iii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
27:21-32](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#021.md)<span id="xv.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p2"></span>**21.** But after long abstinence Paul stood
in the midst and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not
have loosed from Candia, neither have brought upon us this injury and
loss. **22.** And now I exhort you that ye be of good courage: for there
shall be no loss of any man’s life, but only of the ship. **23.** For
there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I
worship. **24.** And he said to me, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought
before Caesar: and, behold, God hath given thee all those which sail
with thee. **25.** Wherefore be of good courage, sirs: for I believe God
that it shall be so, as it hath been told me. **26.** But we must fall
into a certain island. **27.** And when the fourteenth night was come,
as we sailed in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the mariners supposed
that some country appeared to them. **28.** And when they had sounded,
they found it twenty fathoms: and when they were gone a little farther,
they sounded again, and they found it fifteen fathoms. **29.** And
fearing lest they should have fallen into some rough places, having cast
four anchors out of the stern, they wished for day. **30.** And when the
mariners sought to fly out of the ship, when they had let down the boat
into the sea, under a color as if they would have cast anchors out of
the foreship, **31.** Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers,
Unless these abide in the ship, you cannot be saved. **32.** Then the
soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and they suffered it to fall
away.

<span id="xv.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xv.iii-p4"></span><span id="xv.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p5"></span>**21.** *After long abstinence.* Though Luke
doth not plainly express how the mariners and soldiers behaved
themselves, yet he doth plainly distinguish Paul from them, declaring
that he stood in the midst of them that he might comfort their faint
hearts; for no man is fit to exhort but he who is himself an example of
constancy and fortitude. Furthermore, Paul deferred this exhortation
until they were all even at the last cast. We may easily gather out of
the common custom of the infidels, that they raged and made much ado at
the first. A moderate and soft voice could never have been heard amongst
those cries and tumults. Now, after they be weary with working and
howling, they sit still all in a damp, and Paul beginneth to speak to
them. Therefore, it was meet that they should languish like men half
dead, until they were somewhat quiet, and could hear a man which would
give them good counsel.

<span id="xv.iii-p6"></span>Notwithstanding, Paul seemeth to deal
unseasonably, when as he objecteth to them foolishness, because they
would not do after his counsel when all was well, seeing that they knew
that he was inexpert in sailing, as he himself also knew how unskillful
and ignorant he was.

<span id="xv.iii-p7"></span>But if we consider what an hard matter it is
to bring men unto soundness of mind, this reprehension was very
profitable. Paul’s authority should have been nothing worth, neither
should it have moved them any whit, unless they should know this, that
it had not gone well with them because they had despised him before.
Chiding is indeed cruel, and bringeth no comfort; but if it be tempered
with some remedy, it is now a part of the medicine. So, after that Paul
had made the mariners attentive, and had taught by the very event that
they ought to believe him, he exhorteth them to be of good courage, and
promiseth them safety. And this is a token of no small boldness, when he
saith that they ought to have obeyed him. Therefore, he testifieth by
these words, that he spake nothing unadvisedly; but did command them to
do that which God had prescribed. For though we do not read that he had
some especial revelation then given him, yet he himself knew that the
Spirit did secretly govern him, so that he might without fear take upon
him to give counsel, seeing he had the Spirit of God to be his guide.
Whereby that doth better appear which I touched of late, that Paul in
speaking thus doth awake the mariners, that they may more attentively
hear what he will say. Otherwise, it had been a ridiculous thing for a
man which was in danger of drowning, to promise safety to those who were
partakers with him in like calamity.

<span id="xv.iii-p8"></span><span id="xv.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p9"></span>**23.** *For there stood by me.* Lest he
might be accused of rashness, for promising so fully that they should be
all safe, he bringeth in God for his author and witness. Neither is it
to be doubted but that he was fully persuaded that it was a true vision,
so that he did not fear Satan’s jugglings. For because that father of
lies doth oftentimes deceive men under a color of revelations, God did
never appear to his servants, either by himself or by his angels, but he
put them out of doubt by showing them some plain and evident tokens;
and, secondly, did furnish them with the spirit of discretion, that they
might not be deceived. But Paul doth extol the name of his God in plain
words among profane men, not only that they may learn that the true God
is worshipped in Judea, but also that Paul himself doth worship him.
They all knew why he was put in prison. Now, seeing angels come down
unto him from heaven, they may easily gather that his cause is approved
of God. Therefore, there is in these words a secret commendation of the
gospel. Nevertheless, we see how Paul triumpheth in his bonds, when he
is the minister of safety to so many men, and the interpreter of God.

<span id="xv.iii-p10"></span><span id="xv.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p11"></span>**24.** *Fear not, Paul.* He is very
desirous to bring to pass that they may give God alone the praise for
their deliverance, lest these superstitious men do falsely translate it
unto their idols; and by this means he inviteth them unto the true
faith. But by this it appeareth how great the men’s wickedness is, in
that they shut their ears against sound and wholesome counsel, and do
forthwith forget the grace of God, though it were familiarly known to
them. Yea, (that which worse is) they do not see nor perceive it when it
is present before their eyes. But, howsoever, the more part was
unthankful, yet this oracle was not revealed without fruit; yea, this
was good, that those might be made without excuse who did flatter
themselves too much in their deceit. And, seeing it was said that he
must be presented before Caesar, it tended to this end, that his
confession might the more strengthen the godly, when as they should know
that he came forth from God as a witness to confirm and avouch the
doctrine of the gospel, and that he was appointed and saved to that end.

<span id="xv.iii-p12"></span>*Hath given thee all the souls.* Luke
seemeth to give us to understand by these words, that Paul prayed not
only for himself, but also for the rest, that God would save them all
from drowning.  <span id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) And, surely, it
is not likely, that, seeing he saw the danger common to them all, he was
so careful for his own life, that he cared not for the rest whom he saw
in like danger. Notwithstanding, it may be that the Lord did of his own
accord prevent his prayers. Neither is it any new thing, that his
blessing should reach even unto the unworthy, who are joined to the
faithful with any society. So he would have saved Sodom, if there had
been ten good men found there.

<span id="xv.iii-p14"></span>Here ariseth a question, how far the
integrity of the saints doth profit the wicked? First, we must remove
the superstition of the Papists, who, when they hear that God is good to
the bad, for the good’s sake, dream that they be mediators, who obtain
salvation for the world through their merits. And they be twice fools in
that, that they apply these titles of the living unto the dead; and
think that God will be favorable to them for no other cause, save only
because he beholdeth them, and therefore they make them their patrons. I
omit that, that by extolling men’s merits they darken the free goodness
of God. Now, that we may answer the question propounded, we must briefly
note this, that forasmuch as the good are mixed with the bad, as well
prosperity as adversity doth happen as well to the one as to the other;
and yet it falleth out sometimes that when the Lord doth spare his, he
beareth also with the wicked for a time together with them. Again, that
there be many causes for which God doth good to the wicked and reprobate
for the faithful’s sake.

<span id="xv.iii-p15"></span>“He blessed the house of Potiphar for
Joseph’s sake,”*  
*(<span id="xv.iii-p15.2"></span>[Ge
39:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#005)<span id="xv.iii-p15.2"></span>.md)

<span id="xv.iii-p16"></span>that he might move him to handle this holy
man gently. He declared his goodwill toward Paul in saving many men,
that he might bear witness of his godliness, that the majesty of the
gospel might thereby appear more plainly. But we must note this, that
whatsoever benefits God bestoweth upon the wicked, they turn at length
to their destruction; as, on the other side, punishments are profitable
for the godly, which they suffer together with the reprobate.

<span id="xv.iii-p17"></span>In the mean season, this is a singular
pledge of God’s love toward us, in that he maketh certain drops of his
goodness distill from us unto others.

<span id="xv.iii-p18"></span><span id="xv.iii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p19"></span>**25.** *For I believe God.* Paul telleth
them again whence he had such boldness, that he affirmeth that though
they be amidst infinite gulfs of the sea, yet shall they all come safe
to the haven, namely, because God had promised it should be so; in which
words the nature of faith is expressed, when there is a mutual relation
made between it and the Word of God, that it may strengthen men’s minds
against the assaults of temptations. And he doth not only exhort the
mariners, by his own example, to believe, but doth, as it were, take
upon him the office of a promiser,  <span
id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) that he may win credit to the oracle.
That which followeth immediately touching the isle is a latter sign,
whereby it may more plainly appear after the end of the matter, that
this their sailing was not uncertain, otherwise it had been to no end
for the mariners to know how they should escape. Therefore, we see how
God doth give that safety which he promised, a mark that it may not seem
to come by chance. Notwithstanding, we must note, that God kept them
still in some doubt, partly that he may exercise the faith of his
servant, partly that they may all know that Paul learned that of the
Holy Ghost, which he could not as yet comprehend by man’s reason.  <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md) Notwithstanding, Luke teacheth in the
text itself, that he was not believed for all this. For, seeing the
mariners thought that there began some country  <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) to appear unto them, it did not agree
with the promise made touching their arriving in an isle. Therefore, we
see how that they were scarce enforced, even by experience, to think
that he spake the truth.

<span id="xv.iii-p23"></span><span id="xv.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p24"></span>**30.** *And as the mariners sought.* The
grace of the Holy Spirit appeareth in Paul, even in this point also, in
that he did wisely admonish that the mariners should not be suffered to
fly. For why doth not rather the centurion, or some other of the
company, smell out their fraud, save only that Paul may be the minister
of their deliverance, even unto the end? But it is a marvel that he
saith, that the rest could not be saved unless the mariners should
remain in the ship; as if it were in their power to make the promise of
God of none effect. I answer, that Paul doth not dispute, in this place,
precisely of the power of God, that he may separate the same from his
will and from means; and surely God doth not, therefore, commend his
power to the faithful, that they may give themselves to sluggishness and
carelessness, contemning means, or rashly cast away themselves when
there is some certain way to escape. God did promise Hezekiah that the
city should be delivered (<span id="xv.iii-p24.1"></span>[Isa
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#006.md)<span id="xv.iii-p24.1"></span>,
and 35). If he had set open the gates to the enemy, would not Isaiah
straightway have cried, Thou destroyest both thyself and the city? And
yet for all this it doth not follow that the hand of God is tied to
means or helps; but when God appointeth this or that means to bring any
thing to pass, he holdeth all men’s senses, that they may not pass the
bounds which he hath appointed.

<span id="xv.iv"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p1"></span><span id="xv.iv-p1.1"></span>[Acts
27:33-44](../../../bib/kjv/act027.htm#033.md)<span id="xv.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p2"></span>**33.** And when the day began to appear,
Paul exhorted them all to take meat, saying, This is the fourteenth day
that ye have tarried and continued fasting, receiving nothing at all.
**34.** Wherefore I exhort you to take meat; for this no doubt is for
your health; because there shall not one hair fall from the head of any
of you. **35.** And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave
thanks to God in the sight of them all; and when he had broken it, he
began to eat. **36.** Then were they all refreshed in their minds, and
they also took meat. **37.** And all the souls which were in the ship
were two hundred threescore and sixteen. **38.** And when they had eaten
enough, they did lighten the ship. casting out the wheat into the sea.
**39.** And when it was day, they knew not the land; but they spied a
certain haven having a bank, into the which they minded to thrust the
ship. **40.** And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed
themselves to the sea; also, having loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted
up the mainsail to the wind, they drew toward the shore. **41.** But
when they were fallen into a place where two seas met, they thrust in
the ship, and the fore part did stick fast, and moved not; but the
hinder part brake through the violence of the waves. **42.**
Furthermore, the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any,
after he swam out, should escape. **43.** But the centurion, being
desirous to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded that
those which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and
should escape to land. **44.** And the other, some on boards, and some
on broken pieces of the ship; and so it came to pass, that they all
escaped safe to land.

<span id="xv.iv-p4"></span><span id="xv.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p5"></span>**33.** *And when the day began.* Whatsoever
the mariners think, Paul’s faith doth not quail;  <span
id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md) but he leaneth steadfastly to the
promise which was made to him. For he doth not only exhort them to take
meat, as did he who, in extreme despair, uttered these words, Dine,
soldiers, we shall sup in hell;  <span id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md)
but continuing steadfast in his prophecy, he willeth them to be of good
courage. The force of faith doth therein show itself, when as it armeth
us unto patience, and doth valiantly bear off and beat back those
assaults wherewith Satan goeth about to shake it. But whereas he saith,
that they continued fasting for the space of fourteen days, it may seem
absurd and false. There may some one man be found which can abide to
fast long, but it is scarce credible of so great a multitude. We may
easily answer, That their unwonted abstinence from meat is improperly
called fasting; because they had never filled their belly during all
that time; because those who are in sorrow and heaviness do almost
loathe meat. And because despair was the cause of this their loathing of
meat, he affirmeth again that they shall live, so they be of good
courage. For a faithful minister of the word must not only bring abroad
the promises, but also counsel men to follow God whithersoever he
calleth them; and that they be not slothful and sluggish. Furthermore,
the meaning of the words is this, God hath determined to save you, this
confidence ought to animate you, and to make you merry,  <span
id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md) that you be not negligent in your own
business.

<span id="xv.iv-p9"></span><span id="xv.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p10"></span>**35.** *He took bread.* That he may the
better encourage them, by his own example, he taketh bread and eateth.
Luke saith that he gave thanks, not only according to his daily custom,
but because that served greatly to testify his boldness and good
confidence. It is not to be doubted but that Paul himself did that when
he took meat, which he commandeth other men; but now he doth not only
testify his thankfulness, neither doth he only desire of God that he
will sanctify the meat which he is about to eat; but he calleth upon God
without fear, who is the author of his life, that those poor wretches,
which were drenched in sorrow, might conceive some good hope. And he
prevailed thus far, at least, that they gathered so much courage to them
as to take meat, who had, through fear, forgotten to care for their
life.

<span id="xv.iv-p11"></span><span id="xv.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p12"></span>**37.** *All the souls* The number of the
men is recited, first, that it may more plainly appear that none of the
multitude did perish. For Luke doth not show how many men did swim to
the shore, but how many men were then in the ship. Secondly, that the
miracle may be made more evident and also famous; for, in man’s
judgment, it is a thing impossible that two hundred threescore and
sixteen men should escape to land, having suffered shipwreck, without
loss of any man’s life. For it is likely that few had any skill in
swimming except the mariners. And though they were somewhat refreshed
with the meat which they had eaten, yet they were brought so low with
sorrows and wearisomeness, that it is a marvel that they were so nimble
as that they could move their arms. And now we must consider what a stir
they kept; whereas it is seldom seen that twenty or thirty men do so
swim in danger, but one of them doth hinder or drown another. Therefore,
God did plainly stretch forth his hand out of heaven, seeing all those
came to shore safe and sound which had cast themselves into the sea.

<span id="xv.iv-p13"></span><span id="xv.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p14"></span>**38.** *And when they had eaten enough.*
This circumstance doth show that they were at length moved with Paul’s
words. It was not yet light, that they could know whether there were any
haven near. And yet they cast out into the sea the wheat which remained,
that they might lighten the ship. They would not have done this unless
Paul’s authority had prevailed more with them now than before. But as
all unbelievers are unstable, that persuasion did quickly vanish out of
their minds.

<span id="xv.iv-p15"></span><span id="xv.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p16"></span>**41.** *They thrust in the ship.* And then
it might seem that both God had mocked Paul, and that he, with trifling,
had brought his partners in a vain hope;  <span
id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) but God did forthwith put away that
error by giving them prosperous success. It was meet that when the ship
was broken, they should be so discouraged, and that their souls should
so melt, that despair might increase the glory of the miracle. For God
useth to moderate and govern his works so, that he maketh some show of
difficulty by reason of many lets \[hindrances\] which fall out. By this
means he sharpeneth our senses unto greater attentiveness, that we may
at length learn that, though all the world strive against him, yet will
he have the victory. This is the reason why he had lieffer \[rather\]
draw Paul and his companions to the shore after that the ship was lost,
 <span id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) than bring the ship whole to
land.

<span id="xv.iv-p19"></span><span id="xv.iv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p20"></span>**42.** *The counsel of the soldiers.* This
was too horrible unthankfulness. Though the soldiers might thank Paul
twice or thrice for their lives, yet are they minded to kill him, for
whose sake they ought to have spared the rest. He had saved them even as
an angel of God; he had given them wholesome counsel; he had refreshed
them in the same day when they were past hope; and now they stick not to
seek to destroy him, by whom they were so often and so many ways
delivered. Wherefore, if it so fall out that we be ill rewarded for our
good deeds, there is no cause why the unthankfulness of men should
trouble us, which is a disease too common. But they are not only
unthankful to Paul, who was the minister of their life, but also their
filthy misbelief and forgetfulness of the goodness of God doth betray
itself. They had of late received that oracle, that their souls were
given to Paul; and now seeing they will be saved after he is dead, what
other thing go they about but to resist God, that they may save
themselves from death contrary to his will? Therefore, they have now
forgotten that grace whereof they tasted against their will in extreme
despair, neither doth it taste any longer,  <span
id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) after that they see the haven nigh at
hand. But it behoveth us to consider the wonderful counsel of God, as
well in saving Paul as in fulfilling his promise; when as he bringeth
those men to land, who did what they could to make his promise of none
effect. Thus doth his goodness oftentimes strive with the wickedness of
men. Yet he doth so pity the wicked, that, deferring their punishment
until so fit opportunity, he doth not quite discharge them; yea, the
longer he tarrieth, the more grievously he punisheth, and so by that
means he maketh amends for his long tarrying.
