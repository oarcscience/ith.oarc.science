<span id="viii-p1"></span>Chapter 20

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Acts
20:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And after the tumult was ceased, when
Paul had called unto him the disciples, and had embraced them, he took
his journey that he might go into Macedonia. **2.** And when he had
walked through those parts, and had with much speech exhorted them, he
came into Greece. **3.** And when he had spent three months there, when
the Jews laid in wait for him as he was about to loose into Syria, he
purposed to return through Macedonia. **4.** And there accompanied him
into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarebus and
Secundus; and Gains of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and
Trophimus. **5.** When these were gone before, they stayed for us at
Troas. **6.** And we sailed away after the day of sweet \[unleavened\]
bread from Philippi, and came to them to Troas within five days, where
we stayed seven days.

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span><span id="viii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span>**1.** Luke declareth in this chapter how
Paul, loosing from Asia, did again cross the seas to go to Jerusalem.
And though whatsoever is written in this narration be worthy of most
diligent meditation and marking, yet doth it need no long exposition. It
appeareth that the Church was preserved in safety by the wonderful power
of God amidst those troublesome tumults. The church of Ephesus was as
yet slender and weak: the faithful having had experience of a sudden
motion \[commotion\] once, might for just causes fear, lest like storms
should ever now and then arise. We need not doubt that Paul did with
much ado depart from them; yet because greater necessity doth draw him
unto another place, he is enforced to leave his sons who were lately
begotten, and had as yet scarce escaped shipwreck in the midst of the
raging sea. As for them, though they be very loath to forego Paul, yet,
lest they do injury to other churches, they do not keep him back nor
stay him. So that we see that they were not wedded to themselves, but
that they were careful for the kingdom of Christ, that they might
provide as well for their brethren as for themselves. We must diligently
note these examples, that one of us may study to help another in this
miserable dispersing; but if it so fall out at any time that we be
bereft of profitable helps, let us not doubt nor waver, knowing that God
doth hold the helm of our ship. And we must also note this, that Paul
doth not depart until he have saluted the brethren, but doth rather
strengthen them at his departure. As Luke saith straightway of the
Macedonians, that Paul exhorted them with many words, that is, not
overfields,  <span id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401.md) as if it were
sufficient to put them only in mind of their duty; but as he commandeth
elsewhere that others should do, he urged importunately, and beat in
\[inculcated\] thoroughly things which were needful to be known, that
they might never be forgotten (<span id="viii.i-p6.2"></span>[2Ti
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#002)<span id="viii.i-p6.2"></span>.md).

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span><span id="viii.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p8"></span>**3.** *Because the Jews laid wait for him.*
The Lord did exercise his servant so diversely and continually that he
set before us in him an example of most excellent constancy. It is not
sufficient for him to be wearied with the labor and trouble of a long
and wearisome journey, unless he be also brought in danger of his life
by those which lay in wait for him. Let all the servants of Christ set
this mirror before their eyes, that they may never faint through the
wearisomeness of straits. Notwithstanding, when Paul doth journey
another way that he may avoid their laying in wait, he showeth that we
must have regard of our life so far forth that we throw not ourselves
headlong into the midst of dangers. And those who accompany him give no
small testimony of their godliness; and we see how precious his life was
to the faithful, when as a great many being chosen out of diverse
countries to be his companions, do for his sake take a hard and sharp
journey not without great charges. Luke saith that Paul tarried at
Philippos so long as the days of unleavened bread did last, because he
had at that time better opportunity offered to teach. And forasmuch as
it was unknown as yet that the law was disannulled, it stood him upon to
beware, lest by neglecting the feast-day he should be thought among the
rude to be a contemner of God. Though, for mine own part, I think that
he sought principally opportunity to teach, because the Jews were then
more attentive to learn.

<span id="viii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
20:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>**7.** And upon one day of the Sabbaths,
when the disciples were come together to break bread, Paul disputed with
them, being about to take his journey on the morrow; and he prolonged
his speech until midnight. **8.** And there were many lights in an upper
chamber, where they were gathered together. **9.** And a certain young
man named Eutychus, sitting in a window, being fallen into a deep sleep,
as Paul disputed long time, being more overcome with sleep, he fell down
from the third loft downward, and was taken up dead. **10.** And when
Paul came down, he fell upon him, and embracing him, said, Be not ye
troubled, for his soul is in him. **11.** And when he was gone up, and
had broken bread, and had, having had long conference until it was day,
he departed. **12.** And they brought the boy alive, and were not a
little comforted. **13.** But when he had taken ship, we loosed to
Assos, thence to receive Paul, for so had he appointed, being about to
go by land;

<span id="viii.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="viii.ii-p4"></span><span id="viii.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p5"></span>**7.** *And in one day.* Either doth he
mean the first day of the week, which was next after the Sabbath, or
else some certain Sabbath. Which latter thing may seem to me more
probable; for this cause, because that day was more fit for all
assembly, according to custom. But seeing it is no new matter for the
Evangelists to put one instead of the first, according to the custom of
the Hebrew tongue, (<span id="viii.ii-p5.1"></span>[Mt
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.ii-p5.1"></span>;
<span id="viii.ii-p5.2"></span>[Lu
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.ii-p5.2"></span>;
<span id="viii.ii-p5.3"></span>[Joh
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001)<span id="viii.ii-p5.3"></span>.md)
it shall very well agree, that on the morrow after the Sabbath they came
together. Furthermore, it were too cold to expound this of any day. For
to what end is there mentioned of the Sabbath, save only that he may
note the opportunity and choice of the time? Also, it is a likely matter
that Paul waited for the Sabbath, that the day before his departure he
might the more easily gather all the disciples into one place. And the
zeal of them all is worth the noting, in that it was no trouble to Paul
to teach until midnight, though he were ready to take his journey,
neither were the rest weary of learning. For he had no other cause to
continue his speech so long, save only the desire and attentiveness of
his auditory.

<span id="viii.ii-p6"></span>*To break bread.* Though breaking of bread
doth sometimes signify among the Hebrews a domestical banquet, yet do I
expound the same of the Holy Supper in this place, being moved with two
reasons. For seeing we may easily gather by that which followeth that
there was no small multitude gathered together there, it is unlikely
that there could any supper be prepared in a private house. Again, Luke
will afterward declare that Paul took bread not at supper time, but
after midnight. Hereunto is added that, that he saith not that he took
meat that he might eat, but that he might only taste. Therefore, I think
thus, that they had appointed a solemn day for the celebrating of the
Holy Supper of the Lord among themselves, which might be commodious for
them all. And to the end Paul might remedy after a sort the silence of
longer absence, he continueth his speech longer than he did commonly use
to do. That which I spake of the great number of men is gathered thence,
because there were many lights in the upper chamber, which was not done
for any pomp or ostentation, but only for necessity’s sake. For when
there is no need, it is ambition and vanity which maketh men bestow
cost. Furthermore, it was meet that all the whole place should shine
with lights, lest that holy company might be suspected of some
wickedness or dishonesty. Add also another conjecture, if the chamber
had been empty, those which were present would not have suffered
Eutychus to sit upon a window. For it had been filthy licentiousness in
despising  <span id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402.md) the heavenly doctrine
to depart aside into a window, seeing there was room enough elsewhere.

<span id="viii.ii-p8"></span><span id="viii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p9"></span>**9.** *When he was fallen into a deep
sleep.* I see no cause why some interpreters should so sore and sharply
condemn the drowsiness of the young man, that they should say that he
was punished for his sluggishness by death. For what marvel is it, if,
seeing the night was so far spent, having striven so long with sleep, he
yielded at length? And whereas, against his will, and otherwise than he
hoped for, he was taken and overcome with deep sleep, we may guess by
this that he did not settle himself to sleep. To seek out a fit place
wherein to sleep had been a sign of sluggishness, but to be overcome
with sleep, sitting at a window, what other thing is it but without
fault to yield to nature?  <span id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) As if
a man should faint through hunger or too much wearisomeness. Those who
being drowned in earthly cares come unto the word loathsomely; those who
being full of meat and wine are thereby brought on \[to\] sleep; those
who are vigilant enough in other matters, but hear the word as though
they did not pass \[care\] for it, shall be justly condemned for
drowsiness; but Luke doth in plain words acquit Eutychus, when he saith
that he fell down, being overcome with deep sleep after midnight.

<span id="viii.ii-p11"></span>Moreover, the Lord meant not only by the
sleep, but also by the death of this young man to awake and stir up the
faith of his, that they might more joyfully receive Paul’s doctrine, and
might keep it deeply rooted in their minds. It was, indeed, at the first
no small temptation, but such as might have shaken even a most constant
man full sore; for who would have thought that Christ had been chief
governor in that company wherein a miserable man through a fall became
dead? Who would not rather have thought this to be a sign of God’s
curse? But the Lord, by applying a remedy, doth forthwith rid the minds
of his of all perturbation.

<span id="viii.ii-p12"></span><span id="viii.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p13"></span>**10.** *He lay down upon him.* We know
that the apostles, in working miracles, did sometimes use certain
external rites, whereby they might give the glory to God, the author.
And now, whereas Paul doth stretch himself upon the young man, I think
it was done to no other end, save only that he might more easily stir up
himself unto prayer. It is all one as if he should mix himself with the
dead man,  <span id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md) And, peradventure,
this was done for the imitation of Elisha, of whom the sacred history
doth report the same thing (<span id="viii.ii-p14.2"></span>[2Ki
4:34](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#034)<span id="viii.ii-p14.2"></span>.md).
Yet the vehemency of his affection did more move him than the emulation
of the prophet. For that stretching of himself upon him doth more
provoke him to crave his life with all his heart at the hands of the
Lord. So when he embraceth the body of the dead man, by this gesture he
declared that he offered it to God to be quickened, and out of the text
we may gather that he did not depart from embracing it until he knew
that the life was restored again.

<span id="viii.ii-p15"></span>*Be ye not troubled.* We must note that
Paul took great care principally for this cause, lest that sorrowful
event should shake the faith of the godly, and should trouble their
minds. Nevertheless, the Lord did, as it were, seal up and establish
 <span id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) that last sermon which Paul
made at Troas. When he saith that his soul is in him, he doth not deny
that he was dead, because by this means he should extinguish the glory
of the miracle; but the meaning of these words is, that his life was
restored through the grace of God. I do not restrain that which
followeth, to wit, that they were greatly comforted through the joy
which they had by reason of the young man which was restored to life;
but I do also comprehend the confirmation of faith, seeing God gave them
such an excellent testimony of his love.

<span id="viii.ii-p17"></span><span id="viii.ii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p18"></span>**13.** *When we had taken ship.* It is
uncertain why Paul did choose rather to go by land, whether it were
because sailing might be to him troublesome, or that as he did pass by
he might visit the brethren. I think that he did then eschew the sea for
his health’s sake. And his courtesy is greatly to be commended, in that
he spared his companions. For to what end did he suffer them to depart,
save only that he might ease them of the trouble? So that we see that
they did strive among themselves in courtesy and good turns. They were
ready and willing to do their duty; but Paul was so far from requiring
things straitly  <span id="fr_406"></span>[407](#fn_406.md) at their hands,
that of his own accord and courtesy he did remit those duties which they
were ready to do; yea, setting aside his own commodity, he commanded
them to do that which was for their comfort. It is well known that the
city Assos is by the describers of countries  <span
id="fr_407"></span>[408](#fn_407.md) attributed to Troas. The same, as
Pliny doth witness, was called Appollonia. They say that it was a free
city of the AEtolians.

<span id="viii.iii"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p1"></span><span id="viii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
20:14-21](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#014.md)<span
id="viii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p2"></span>**14.** And when we were come together at
Assos, having received him we came to him. **15.** And sailing thence
the day following we came over against Chios; and on the morrow we
arrived at Samos, and having tarried at Trogyllum, we came to Miletus.
**16.** For Paul purposed to sail beyond Ephesus, lest he should spend
the time in Asia: for he made haste if it were possible for him to keep
the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem. **17.** And having sent messengers
from Miletus to Ephesus, he called the elders of the church. **18.** Who
when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know from the first
day wherein I entered into Asia, how 1 have been with you at all
seasons, **19.** Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with
many tears, and temptations, which happened to me by the laying in wait
of the Jews; **20.** So that I have kept nothing back which might be for
your profit, but did show to you and teach you publicly and through
every house, **21.** Testifying both to the Jews and Grecians the
repentance which is towards God, and the faith which is toward our Lord
Jesus Christ.

<span id="viii.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="viii.iii-p4"></span><span id="viii.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p5"></span>**16.** *For Paul purposed.* It is not to
be doubted but that he had great and weighty causes to make haste; not
that he made so great account of the day, but because strangers did then
use to come together to Jerusalem out of all quarters. Forasmuch as he
did hope that he might do some good in such a great assembly, he would
not foreslow \[neglect\] the opportunity. Therefore, let us know that
the worship of the law  <span id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) was not
the cause that he made so great haste, but he set before his eyes the
edifying of the Church; partly that he might show to the faithful that
the kingdom of Christ was enlarged, partly that if there were any as yet
strangers from Christ, he might gain them; partly that he might stop the
mouths of the wicked.  <span id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md)
Notwithstanding, we must note, that he did, in the mean season, provide
for other churches. For, in sending for the elders of Ephesus to
Miletus, he showeth that he did not neglect Asia. And whereas they come
together when they be called, it is not only a token of concord, but
also of modesty; for they were many; yet doth it not irk them to obey
one apostle of Christ, whom they knew to be endued with singular gifts.
Moreover, it appeareth more plainly by the text, \[context\] that those
are called elders, not which were grey-headed, but such as were rulers
of the Church. And it is an usual thing almost in all tongues, that
those be called elders and fathers who are appointed to govern others,
though their age be not always accordingly.

<span id="viii.iii-p8"></span><span id="viii.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p9"></span>**18.** *Ye know.* Paul, in this sermon,
standeth principally upon this, that lie may exhort those pastors of
Ephesus,  <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) by his own example, to
do their duty faithfully. For that is the true kind of censure, and by
this means is authority purchased to doctrine, when the teacher
prescribeth nothing  <span id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md) which he
himself hath not done indeed before. And it was no unseemly thing for
Paul to speak of his virtues. There is nothing less tolerable in the
servants of Christ than ambition and vanity; but forasmuch as all men
knew full well what modesty and humility was in the holy man, he needed
not to fear lest he should incur the suspicion of vain boasting;
especially, seeing that benign information by necessity, he did declare
his faithfulness and diligence, that others might take example thereby.
He doth, indeed, greatly extol his labors, patience, fortitude, and
other virtues, but to what end? Surely not that he may purchase
commendation at the hands of his auditory, but that his holy exhortation
may pierce more deeply, and may stick fast in their minds. He did also
shoot at another mark, that his integrity and uprightness in dealing
might serve afterward to commend his doctrine. And he citeth
eye-witnesses, lest he seem to speak of things unknown. I call those
witnesses who did not only know all things, but had also a judgment
which was pure, and corrupt with no affections.

<span id="viii.iii-p12"></span><span id="viii.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p13"></span>**19.** *Serving the Lord.* He reckoneth
up first not only in what straits he was, but most of all his humility,
coupled with contempt of the world, and rebukes, and other afflictions;
as if he should say*,* that he was not honorably received or with
commendation; but he was conversant among them under the contemptible
form of the cross. And this is no small trial,  <span
id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md) when we faint not, though we see
ourselves trodden under foot by the intolerable pride of the world.

<span id="viii.iii-p15"></span>Notwithstanding, we must note everything
more distinctly. To serve the Lord is taken in this place, not for to
worship God in holiness and righteousness, which is common to all the
godly; but it doth signify to execute a public function. Therefore, Paul
doth not speak of \[as\] some one private man, but as one made a
minister of the Church. And so he doth testify, that he fulfilled the
apostleship to him committed with humility and modesty; both because,
knowing his own infirmity, he did mistrust himself; and also, because,
considering the excellency of his calling, he counted himself very
unmeet;  <span id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) and, lastly, because he
did willingly submit himself to bear the reproach of the cross. For this
humility is set both against vain confidence, and also haughtiness.
Secondly, he toucheth  <span id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) his
tears, which strifes, diverse assaults of Satan, the rage of wicked men,
the inward diseases of the Church, and offenses, had made him shed; at
length, he addeth, that he led a fearful life,  <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) amidst the layings in wait of the
Jews; and he confesseth that he was tempted therewith, as he was not
hardened, though he did not faint. For he is not ashamed to confess his
infirmity.

<span id="viii.iii-p19"></span>His drift is, that those to whom he
speaketh may not faint, through like tribulations; and that, being void
of all ambition, they may do their duty carefully and reverently; and
that they may not only with a patient mind suffer themselves to be
despised of men, but that they may be cast down in themselves. Because,
that man can never be rightly framed to obey Christ whose looks are
lofty, and whose heart is proud. And (as men cannot long bear a show of
virtue) to the end it may appear manifestly, that he behaved himself
sincerely and from his heart, he maketh mention of his constancy which
lasted three years, wherein he had still kept one course. Ye know (saith
he) how I have behaved myself since the first day until this time. To
conclude, this is the true trial of the servants of Christ, not to be
changed as the times change; but to continue like to themselves, and
always to keep a straight course.

<span id="viii.iii-p20"></span><span id="viii.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p21"></span>**20.** *I have kept back nothing.* He
commendeth his faithfulness and diligence in teaching in three respects,
that he instructed his scholars thoroughly and perfectly, so that he
omitted nothing which might make for their salvation; that being not
content with general preaching, he did also endeavor to do every man
good. Thirdly, he reciteth a brief sum of all his whole doctrine, that
he exhorted them unto faith in Christ and repentance. Now, forasmuch as
he depainteth out unto us a pattern of a faithful and good teacher,
whosoever they be who are desirous to prove their industry to the Lord,
they must set before their eyes the edifying of the Church, as he
commandeth Timotheus in another place, to consider what things be
profitable, that he may be instant in delivering those things (<span
id="viii.iii-p21.1"></span>[1 Tim.
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008)<span id="viii.iii-p21.1"></span>.md).
And surely the Scripture (according to whose rule all manner of teaching
must be examined, yea, which is the only method of teaching aright) doth
not contain profound  <span id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md)
speculations, to delight men when they have nothing else to do;  <span
id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md) but as the same Paul doth testify, it
is all profitable to make the man of God perfect.

<span id="viii.iii-p24"></span>But Paul prescribeth such a desire to
edify, that the pastor must omit nothing, so much as in him lieth, which
is profitable to be known. For they be bad masters who do so keep their
scholars in the first principles, that they do never come unto the
knowledge of the truth (<span id="viii.iii-p24.1"></span>[2Ti
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#007)<span id="viii.iii-p24.1"></span>.md).
And surely the Lord doth not teach us in his word only to \[by\] halves,
(as they say) but he delivereth perfect wisdom, and such as is in all
points absolute. Whereby it appeareth how impudently those men boast
themselves to be ministers of the word, who do not only cloak and foster
the ignorance of the people with their silence, but do also wink at
gross errors and wicked superstitions; as at this day in Papistry, many
send out some sparks of sound doctrine, but they  <span
id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) dare not drive away the darkness of
ignorance, and whereas the wicked fear of the flesh doth hinder them,
they pretend that the people is not capable of sound  <span
id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) doctrine.

<span id="viii.iii-p27"></span>Indeed, I confess that all things cannot
be taught at one time, and that we must imitate Paul’s wisdom, who did
apply himself unto the capacity of the ignorant. But what moderation is
this when they suffer the blind to fall into the ditch, when they leave
miserable souls under the tyranny of antichrist, and whereas they see
idolatry rage, the worship of God corrupt, his law broken, and, finally,
all holy things profaned, they do either with silence pass over such
filthy confusion, or else they show it underhand, sparingly and
obscurely, like men that be afraid? Therefore, we must note Paul’s word,
when as he saith that he kept back nothing, but did show whatsoever
things were profitable for the people; for by this we gather that the
pure and free  <span id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) profession of
sound doctrine is required at the hands of the servants of Christ,
wherein there must be no boughts nor crooks, and that nothing is more
unseemly in them than oblique insinuations, and such as are inwrapped in
crafty dissimulation.

<span id="viii.iii-p29"></span>*Publicly, and throughout every house.*
This is the second point, that he did not only teach all men in the
congregation, but also every one privately, as every man’s necessity did
require. For Christ hath not appointed pastors upon this condition, that
they may only teach the Church in general in the open pulpit; but that
they may take charge of every particular sheep, that they may bring back
to the sheepfold those which wander and go astray, that they may
strengthen those which are discouraged and weak, that they may cure the
sick, that they may lift up and set on foot the feeble,  <span
id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) (<span id="viii.iii-p30.2"></span>[Eze
34:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#004)<span id="viii.iii-p30.2"></span>.md)
for common doctrine will oftentimes wax cold, unless it be holpen with
private admonitions.

<span id="viii.iii-p31"></span>Wherefore, the negligence of those men is
inexcusable, who, having made one sermon, as if they had done their
task, live all the rest of their time idly; as if their voice were shut
up within the church walls, seeing that so soon as they be departed,
thence they be dumb. Also, disciples and scholars are taught, that if
they will be numbered in Christ’s flock, they must give place to their
pastors, so often as they come unto them; and that they must not refuse
private admonitions. For they be rather bears than sheep, who do not
vouchsafe to hear the voice of their pastor, unless he be in the pulpit;
and cannot abide to be admonished and reproved at home, yea, do
furiously refuse  <span id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) that necessary
duty.

<span id="viii.iii-p33"></span><span id="viii.iii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p34"></span>**21.** *Testifying both to Jews.*
Descending now unto the third point, he setteth down the sum of this
doctrine in a few words, to wit, that he exhorted all men unto faith and
repentance, as it was said before, that the gospel consisteth upon
\[of\] these two points only. Whence we do also gather wherein the true
edifying of the Church doth properly consist, the care and burden
whereof doth lie upon the pastor’s shoulders, and whereunto we must
apply all our study, if we be desirous to profit profitably in God’s
school. We have already said that the word of God is profaned, when the
readers of the same do occupy themselves in frivolous questions. But to
the end we may not read the same wanderingly, we must note and aim at
this double mark which the apostle setteth before us. For whosoever he
be that turneth unto any other thing, in taking great pains, he shall do
nothing else but walk in a circuit. By the word *testify* he expresseth
great vehemency, as if he should have said that by testifying he did
commend, that the excuse of ignorance might not remain. For he alludeth
unto the custom used in courts, where testifying is used to take away
all doubt. As men are not only to be taught, but also to be constrained
to embrace salvation in Christ, and to addict themselves to God, to lead
a new life. And though he affirm that he was wanting to none, yet doth
he place the Jews in the first place; because, as the Lord hath
preferred them in the degree of honor before the Gentiles, so it was
meet that Christ and his grace should be offered them until they should
quite fall away.

<span id="viii.iii-p35"></span>*Repentance toward God.* We must first
note the distinction of faith and repentance, which some do falsely and
unskillfully confound, saying, that repentance is a part of faith. I
grant, indeed, that they cannot be separate; because God doth illuminate
no man with the Spirit of faith whom he doth not also regenerate unto
newness of life. Yet they must needs be distinguished, as Paul doth in
this place. For repentance is a turning unto God, when we frame
ourselves and all our life to obey him; but faith is a receiving of the
grace offered us in Christ. For all religion tendeth to this end, that,
embracing holiness and righteousness, we serve the Lord purely, also
that we seek no part of our salvation anywhere else save only at his
hands, and that we seek salvation in Christ alone. Therefore, the
doctrine of repentance containeth a rule of good life; it requireth the
denial of ourselves, the mortifying of our flesh, and meditating upon
the heavenly life. But because we be all naturally corrupt, strangers
from righteousness, and turned away from God himself. Again, because we
fly from God, because we know that he is displeased with us, the means,
as well to obtain free reconciliation as newness of life, must be set
before us.

<span id="viii.iii-p36"></span>Therefore, unless faith be added, it is
in vain to speak of repentance; yea, those teachers of repentance who,
neglecting faith, stand only upon the framing of life, and precepts of
good works, differ nothing, or very little from profane philosophers.
They teach how men must live; but, forasmuch as they leave men in their
nature, there can no bettering be hoped for thence, until they invite
those who are lost unto hope of salvation; until they quicken the dead,
promising forgiveness of sins; until they show that God doth, by his
free adoption, take those for his children who were before bond-slaves
of Satan; until they teach that the Spirit of regeneration must be
begged at the hands of the heavenly Father, that we must draw godliness,
righteousness, and goodness, from him who is the fountain of all good
things. And hereupon followeth calling upon God, which is the chiefest
thing in the worship of God.

<span id="viii.iii-p37"></span>We see now how that repentance and faith
are so linked together that they cannot be separate. For it is faith
which reconcileth God to us, not only that he may be favorable unto us,
by acquitting us of the guiltiness of death, by not imputing to us our
sins, but also that by purging the filthiness of our flesh by his
Spirit, he may fashion us again after his own image. He doth not,
therefore, name repentance in the former place, as if it did wholly go
before faith, forasmuch as a part thereof proceedeth from faith, and is
an effect thereof; but because the beginning of repentance is a
preparation unto faith. I call the displeasing of ourselves the
beginning, which doth enforce us, after we be thoroughly touched with
the fear of the wrath of God, to seek some remedy.

<span id="viii.iii-p38"></span>*Faith toward Christ.* It is not without
cause that the Scripture doth everywhere make Christ the mark whereat
our faith must aim, and as they say commonly, set him before us as the
object. For the majesty of God is of itself higher than that men can
climb thereunto. Therefore, unless Christ come between, all our senses
do vanish away in seeking God. Again, inasmuch as he is the Judge of the
world, it must needs be that the beholding of him without Christ shall
make us afraid.  <span id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) But God doth
not only represent himself unto us in Christ’s image, but also refresh
us with his Fatherly favor, and by all means restore us to life. For
there is no part of our salvation which may not be found in Christ. By
the sacrifice of his death he hath purged our sins; he hath suffered the
punishment that he might acquit us; he hath made us clean by his blood;
by his obedience he hath appeased his Father’s wrath; by his
resurrection he hath purchased righteousness for us. No marvel,
therefore, if we said, that faith must be fixed  <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) in the beholding of Christ.

<span id="viii.iv-p2"></span>**22.** And, behold, I go now bound in the
spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what things shall befall me there:
**23.** Save only that the Holy Ghost doth witness throughout every
city, saying that bonds and afflictions are prepared for me. **24.** But
I care not, neither is my life dear to me, that I may finish my course
with joy, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to
testify the gospel of the grace of God. **25.** And now, behold, I know
that after this ye shall not see my face, all you through whom I have
gone preaching the kingdom of God. **26.** Wherefore I take you to
record this day, that I am clean from the blood of all men. **27.** For
I have kept nothing back, but have showed you all the counsel of God.

<span id="viii.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="viii.iv-p4"></span><span id="viii.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p5"></span>**22.** *And, behold.* He declareth now
more fully to what end he intreated of his upright dealing; to wit,
because they should never see him any more. And it was very expedient
that the pattern which was set before them by God of them to be followed
should be always before their eyes, and that they should remember him
when he was dead. For we know how readily men degenerate from pure
institution. But though he deny that he doth know what shall befall him
at Jerusalem, yet because he was taught by many prophecies that bonds
were prepared for him there, as if he were now ready to die, he cutteth
off shortly after the hope of his return. And yet for all this he is not
contrary to himself. He speaketh doubtfully at the first of set purpose,
that he may soften that which was about to be more (hard and) bitter;
and yet he doth truly affirm, that he knew not as yet the ends and
events of things, because he had no certain and special revelation
touching the whole process.

<span id="viii.iv-p6"></span>*Bound in the spirit.* Some expound this
that he was bound to the churches, who had committed to him this
function to carry alms. Notwithstanding, I do rather think that hereby
is meant the inward force and motion of the Spirit, not as though he
were so inspired,  <span id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) that he was
out of his wit, but because being certified of the will of God, he did
meekly  <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) follow the direction and
instinct of the Spirit, even of his own accord. Therefore, this speech
importeth as much as if he should have said, I cannot otherwise do,
unless I would be stubborn and rebellious against God, who doth as it
were draw me thither, being bound by his Spirit. For to the end he may
excuse himself of rashness, he saith that the Spirit is the author and
guide of his journey. But would to God those brain-sick men, who boast
that the Spirit doth incite to them those things which proceed from
their own fantasy, did know the Spirit as familiarly as did Paul, who
doth, notwithstanding, not say that all his motions and instigations
 <span id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) are of the Spirit, but
declareth that that fell out in one thing as a singular thing. For men
do oftentimes foolishly and unadvisedly take in hand those things which
they put in practice afterward stoutly, because they be ashamed of
lightness and instability. And he doth not only mean that he took in
hand his journey for a good cause, which the Spirit of God showeth him,
but that it is altogether necessary for him, because it is wickedness to
resist. Furthermore, let us learn, by the example of the holy man, not
to kick against the Spirit of the Lord, but obediently to give over
ourselves by him to be governed, that he may rule us at his pleasure
after we be as it were bound to him.  <span
id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) For if the reprobate, who are the
bond-slaves of Satan, be carried not only willingly, but also greedily,
through his motion,  <span id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) how much
more ought this voluntary bondage or service to be in the children of
God?

<span id="viii.iv-p12"></span><span id="viii.iv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p13"></span>**23.** *But that the Holy Ghost.* I do
not understand this of secret oracles, but of those foretellings which
he heard everywhere of the prophets. And this speech hath greater
dignity to set forth the prophecies, than if the men themselves which
spake were called and cited to be witnesses. For by this means the word
of God hath his \[its\] authority, when we confess that the Spirit of
God is the author thereof, though the ministers be men. Now, forasmuch
as the same Spirit, which foretelleth Paul of bonds and tribulations,
doth also hold him fast bound that he cannot refuse to submit himself
unto him, by this we learn, that what dangers soever hang over our
heads, we are not thereby acquitted, but that we must obey the
commandments of God, and follow his calling. In vain, therefore, do
those men flatter themselves, who will do good so long as they be free
from molestation, and may make discommodities, damages, and dangers of
death, sufficient excuses.

<span id="viii.iv-p14"></span><span id="viii.iv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p15"></span>**24.** *I care not.* All the godly must
be so framed in their minds, and chiefly the ministers of the Word,
that, setting all things apart, they make haste to obey God. The life
is, indeed, a more excellent gift than that it ought to be neglected; to
wit, seeing we be therein created after the image of God, to the end we
may think upon that blessed immortality which is laid up for us in
heaven, in which the Lord doth now by diverse testimonies and tokens
show himself to be our Father.

<span id="viii.iv-p16"></span>But because it is ordained to be unto us
as a race, we must always hasten unto the mark, and overcome all
hindrances, lest any thing hinder or stay us in our course, For it is a
filthy thing for us to be so holden with a blind desire to live, that we
lose the causes of life for life itself; and this do the words of Paul
express. For he doth not simply set light by his life; but he doth
forget the respect thereof, that he may finish his course; that he may
fulfill the ministry which he hath received of Christ, as if he should
say that he is not desirous to live, save only that he may satisfy the
calling of God; and that, therefore, it shall be no grief to him to lose
his life, so that he may come by death unto the goal of the function
prescribed to him by God.

<span id="viii.iv-p17"></span>And we must note that which he saith,
*with joy,* for his meaning is, that this is taken from the faithful by
no sorrow or grief, but that they both. live and die to the Lord. For
the joy of a good conscience is more deeply and surely laid up, than
that it can be taken away by any external trouble, or any sorrow of the
flesh; it triumpheth more joyfully than that it can be oppressed. Also,
we must note the definition of his course; to wit, that it is the
ministry received of the Lord. Paul doth indeed speak of himself; yet,
by his own example, he teacheth that all those go astray who have not
God to be the governor of their course. Whereupon it followeth that his
calling is unto every one of us a rule of good life. Neither can we be
otherwise persuaded that the Lord alloweth that which we do, unless our
life be framed and ordered according to his will, which certainly is
required, especially in the ministers of the word, that they take
nothing in hand unless they have Christ for their author. Neither is it
to be doubted but that Paul, in giving his apostleship this mark, (as he
useth to do very often) doth confirm the credit thereof. He calleth it
the gospel of the grace of God, of the effect or end, notwithstanding
this is a title of rare commendation, that, by the gospel, salvation and
the grace of God are brought unto us. For it is very expedient for us to
know that God is found there to be merciful and favorable.

<span id="viii.iv-p18"></span><span id="viii.iv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p19"></span>**25.** *And, behold, now I know.* He doth
now utter that plainly which he had insinuated covertly. And we said
that he did put them out of hope of his return, to the end he might more
deeply imprint in their minds his exhortations. For we know what great
force the words and speeches of men have which are uttered at their
departure or death. Also, he would have them beware by this forewarning,
that they do not depend upon his presence, and so their faith should
faint through wearisomeness. The doctrine of the gospel is called the
kingdom of God now again, which doth begin the kingdom of God in this
world, by renewing men after the image of God, until it be made perfect
at length in the last resurrection,

<span id="viii.iv-p20"></span><span id="viii.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p21"></span>**26.** *Wherefore I take you to record.*
It is all one as if he had said, I call you to witness, or I call you to
bear witness before God and his angels. And this doth he not so much for
his own cause, as that he may prescribe unto them their duty with
greater authority. Furthermore, this place containeth a brief sum of
teaching rightly and well, and it exhorteth the teachers themselves,
vehemently and sharply, that they be diligent in their function. What
order must pastors then keep in teaching? First, let them not esteem at
their pleasure what is profitable to be uttered and what to be omitted;
but let them leave that to God alone to be ordered at his pleasure. So
shall it come to pass that the inventions of men shall have none
entrance into the Church of God. Again, mortal man shall not be so bold
as to mangle the Scripture and to pull it in pieces, that he may
diminish  <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) this or that at his
pleasure, that he may obscure something and suppress many things; but
shall deliver whatsoever is revealed in the Scripture, though wisely and
seasonably for the edifying of the people, yet plainly and without
guile, as becometh a faithful and true interpreter of God. I said that
wisdom must be used, because we must always have respect unto profit, so
there be no subtilty used, wherein many take too great delight, when as
they turn and wrest the word of God unto their methods, and forge to us
a certain kind of philosophy mixed of the gospel and their own
inventions; namely, because this mixture is more delectable. Thence have
we free will, thence the deserts of works, thence the denial of the
providence and free election of God. And that which we said even now is
to be noted, that the counsel of God, whereof Paul maketh mention, is
included in his word, and that it is to he sought nowhere else.

<span id="viii.iv-p23"></span>For many things are kept from us in this
life, the perfect and full manifestation whereof is deferred until that
day, wherein we shall see God as he is, with new eyes, face to face
(<span id="viii.iv-p23.1"></span>[1Co
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012.md)<span
id="viii.iv-p23.1"></span>). Therefore, those do set forth the will of
God who interpret the Scriptures faithfully, and out of them instruct
the people in the faith, in the fear of God, and in all exercises of
godliness. And, as we said of late, that those are condemned by this
sentence, who, disputing philosophically, lest they should teach
anything which is removed from the common sense of men, and therefore
odious, do corrupt with their leaven the purity of the Scripture; so,
both sharply and sore, doth Paul thunder against them, who, for fear of
the cross and persecution, do speak only doubtfully and darkly.  <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md)

<span id="viii.iv-p25"></span>*I am clean from the blood.* I do not
doubt but that he had respect unto the place of Ezekiel, where God
denounceth that his prophet shall be guilty of the blood of the wicked
unless he exhort them unto repentance (<span
id="viii.iv-p25.1"></span>[Ezek. 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#018.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#020)<span id="viii.iv-p25.1"></span>.md).
For upon this condition doth he appoint pastors over his Church, that if
anything perish through their negligence, an account may be required at
their hands; yea, that unless they show the way of salvation without
guile and crooks, the destruction of those who go astray may be imputed
unto them. Those men must needs be wonderful dull whom such a sharp
threatening cannot awake. Wherefore the epicurish impiety of the Popish
clergy doth the more bewray itself, where, though they craik and brag
 <span id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) of their honorable titles, yet
they think no more upon giving of an account for so many souls which
perish, than if there sat no Judge in heaven, neither is their
ungodliness any whit less filthy before the whole world, in that being
given only to devour sheep,  <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md)
they usurp the name of pastors. Furthermore, the Lord showeth how dear
souls be to him, seeing that he doth so sharply punish the pastor’s
sluggishness for their destruction; but we see what small account many
men make of their own salvation, for which even God himself doth
vouchsafe to be careful.

<span id="viii.v"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p1"></span><span id="viii.v-p1.1"></span>[Acts
20:28-32](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#028.md)<span id="viii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p2"></span>**28.** Therefore, take heed to yourselves,
and to all the flock, wherein the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to
govern the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his blood.
**29.** For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will
enter in among you, not sparing the flock. **30.** And of your own
selves shall arise men, speaking perverse things, that they may draw
disciples after them. **31.** For which cause watch ye, remembering that
by the space of three years I ceased not night and day to warn every one
of you with tears. **32.** And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and
to the word of his grace, who is able to build farther, and to give you
an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.

<span id="viii.v-p3"></span> 

<span id="viii.v-p4"></span><span id="viii.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p5"></span>**28.** *Take heed, therefore.* He doth now
apply his speech unto them, and by many reasons showeth that they must
watch diligently, and that he is not so careful but because necessity
doth so require. The first reason is, because they be bound to the flock
over which they be set. The second, because they were called unto this
function not by mortal man, but by the Holy Ghost. The third, because it
is no small honor to govern the Church of God. The fourth, because the
Lord did declare by an evident testimony what account he doth make of
the Church, seeing that he hath redeemed it with his blood. As touching
the first, he doth not only command them to take heed to the flock, but
first to themselves. For that man will never be careful for the
salvation of other men who will neglect his own. And in vain shall that
man prick forward other to live godlily, who will himself show no desire
of godliness. Yea, that man will not take pains with his flock who
forgetteth himself, seeing he is a part of the flock. Therefore, to the
end they may be careful for the flock to them committed, Paul commandeth
and warneth that every one of them keep himself in the fear of God. For
by this means it should come to pass, that every one should be as
faithful towards his flock as he ought. For we said that Paul reasoneth
from their calling, that they be bound to take pains in the Church of
God, whereof they have the government. As if he should say, that they
may not do whatsoever they like best, neither are they free after they
be made pastors, but they be bound publicly to all the flock.

<span id="viii.v-p6"></span>*The Holy Ghost hath made you overseers.* By
the very word he putteth them in mind, that they be placed, as it were,
in a watch-tower, that they may watch for the common safety of all men.
But Paul standeth principally upon this, that they were not appointed by
men, but the charge of the Church was committed unto them by God. For
which cause they must be the more diligent and careful, because they
must give a straight account before that high seat of judgment. For the
more excellent the dignity of that Lord and Master whom we serve is, the
more reverence do we give him naturally, and the reverence itself doth
sharpen our study and diligence.

<span id="viii.v-p7"></span>Moreover, though the Lord would have
ministers of the word chosen from the beginning by the voices
\[suffrages\] of men, yet doth he always challenge the government of the
Church to himself, not only to the end we may acknowledge him to be the
only governor thereof, but also know that the incomparable treasure of
salvation doth come from him alone. For he is robbed of his glory if we
think that the gospel is brought unto us, either by chance or by the
will of men, or their industry. But this doth Paul attribute peculiarly
to the Spirit, by whom God doth govern his Church, and who is to every
man a secret witness of his calling in his own conscience.

<span id="viii.v-p8"></span>Concerning the word *overseer* or *bishop,*
we must briefly note this, that Paul calleth all the elders of Ephesus
by this name, as well one as other.  <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) Whence we gather, that according to
the use of the Scripture bishops differ nothing from elders. But that it
came to pass through vice and corruption, that those who were chief in
every city began to be called bishops. I call it corruption, not because
it is evil that some one man should be chief in every college or
company; but because this boldness is intolerable, when men, by wresting
the names of the Scripture unto their custom, doubt not to change the
tongue of the Holy Ghost.

<span id="viii.v-p10"></span>*To govern the Church.* The Greek word
<span id="viii.v-p10.1"></span>ποιμαινειν doth signify *to* *feed.* But
by a fit similitude it is translated unto every kind of government. And
we have said that this is the third argument drawn from the excellency
of the function; as the same Paul telleth Timotheus elsewhere, that he
take heed and see how he ought to behave himself in the house of God,
which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth.
As if he should *say,* that there is no time to be idle in such a
weighty calling, and that those are less excusable whom God hath made
stewards of his family, the higher that degree of honor is, unless they
be correspondent to so great dignity, that is, unless they do their duty
diligently. Now, if bishops or overseers be made by the Holy Ghost, to
the end they may feed the Church, the hierarchy of Papistry is
ridiculous, wherein bishops being proud of their (painted sheath and)
vain title, do not so much as once meddle with the function of teaching,
no, not for fashion’s sake.

<span id="viii.v-p11"></span>*Which he hath purchased.* The four
reasons, whereby Paul doth carefully prick forward the pastors to do
their duty diligently, because the Lord hath given no small pledge of
his love toward the Church in shedding his own blood for it. Whereby it
appeareth how precious it is to him; and surely there is nothing which
ought more vehemently to urge pastors to do their duty joyfully, than if
they consider that the price of the blood of Christ is committed to
them. For hereupon it followeth, that unless they take pains in the
Church, the lost souls are not only imputed to them, but they be also
guilty of sacrilege, because they have profaned the holy blood of the
Son of God, and have made the redemption gotten by him to be of none
effect, so much as in them lieth. And this is a most cruel offense, if,
through our sluggishness, the death of Christ do not only become vile or
base, but the fruit thereof be also abolished and perish; and it is said
that God hath purchased the Church, to the end we may know that he would
have it remain wholly to himself, because it is meet and right that he
possess those whom he hath redeemed.

<span id="viii.v-p12"></span>Notwithstanding, we must also remember,
that all mankind are the bond-slaves of Satan until Christ set us free
from his tyranny, gathering us into the inheritance of his Father.

<span id="viii.v-p13"></span>But because the speech which Paul useth
seemeth to be somewhat hard, we must see in what sense he saith that God
purchased the Church with his blood. For nothing is more absurd than to
feign or imagine God to be mortal or to have a body. But in this speech
he commendeth the unity of person in Christ; for because there be
distinct natures in Christ, the Scripture cloth sometimes recite that
apart by itself which is proper to either. But when it setteth God
before us made manifest in the flesh, it doth not separate the human
nature from the Godhead. Notwithstanding, because again two natures are
so united in Christ, that they make one person, that is improperly
translated sometimes unto the one, which doth truly and in deed belong
to the other, as in this place Paul doth attribute blood to God; because
the man Jesus Christ, who shed his blood for us, was also God. This
manner of speaking is caned, of the old writers, *communicatio
idiomatum,* because the property of the one nature is applied to the
other. And I said that by this means is manifestly expressed one person
of Christ, lest we imagine him to be double, which Nestorius did in
times past attempt; and yet for all this we must not imagine a confusion
of the two natures which Eutychus went about to bring in, or which the
Spanish dog, Servetus, hath at this time invented, who maketh the
Godhead of Christ nothing else but a form or image of the human nature,
which he dreameth to have always shined in God.

<span id="viii.v-p14"></span><span id="viii.v-p14.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p15"></span>**29.** *For I know.* Paul doth now exhort
the Ephesians to watch diligently, by the necessity, which is a most
sharp prick. For he saith that “grievous wolves are ready to invade the
sheepfold.” This is a thing always incident to the Church to be hated of
wolves. Wherefore, there is no time to sleep. But the more and the more
hurtful those be who break in, the more watchful must the pastors be.
For God doth sometimes release some part of trouble, that the flock may
be fed quietly and peaceably; and as when the weather is fair and clear,
the sheep are fed more safely in the fields, and there is more danger
when the air is cloudy and dark; so the Church of God hath sometimes
some fair weather granted to it. After that cometh a troublesome time,
which is more fit for the subtilty  <span
id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) of wolves. Therefore, Paul doth mean,
that it standeth them upon to be more watchful than they have been
hitherto, because greater dangers hang over their heads. But the
question is, how Paul knew this? First, we need not doubt of this, but
that his presence was of great force to drive away wolves; and no
marvel, if the power of the Spirit, which shineth in the ministers of
Christ, do bridle the wicked so that they dare not utter their poison;
yea, if that heavenly light do drive away much darkness of Satan.
Therefore, seeing that Paul did know that the malice of Satan was kept
under for a time by his industry, he doth easily foretell what will
happen after his departure, though it be likely he was certified by the
Lord, through the spirit of prophecy, that others might be admonished by
him, as we see it came to pass. Howsoever it be, so often as faithful
pastors go away, let us learn that we must beware of wolves, whom they
can hardly drive from the sheep-cots, though they watch most narrowly.

<span id="viii.v-p17"></span><span id="viii.v-p17.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p18"></span>**30.** *Of your ownselves shall arise.*
This amplifieth the grievousness of the evil, because there be some
wolves within, and so hiding themselves under the title of pastors,
\[which\] do wait for some opportunity wherein they may do hurt. Also,
he declareth what danger these wolves do threaten, to wit, the
scattering abroad of the flock, when the Church is drawn away from the
unity of faith, and is divided into sects. Neither are all those wolves
who do not their duty as they ought, but there be oftentimes hirelings,
a kind of men not so hurtful as the other. But the corruption of
doctrine is a most deadly plague to the sheep. Now, in the third place,
the fountain and beginning of this evil is noted, because they will draw
disciples after them. Therefore, ambition is the mother of all heresies.
For the sincerity of the word of God doth then flourish when the pastors
join hand in hand to bring disciples unto Christ, because this alone is
the sound state of the Church, that he be heard alone;  <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) wherefore, both the doctrine of
salvation must needs be perverted, and also the safety of the flock must
needs go to nought, where men be desirous of mastership. And as this
place teacheth that almost all corruptions of doctrine flow from the
pride of men, so we learn again out of the same that it cannot otherwise
be, but that ambitious men will turn away from right purity, and corrupt
the word of God. For seeing that the pure and sincere handling of the
Scripture tendeth to this end, that Christ alone may have the
preeminence, and that men can challenge nothing to themselves, but they
shall take so much from the glory of Christ, it followeth that those are
corrupters of sound doctrine who are addicted to themselves, and study
to advance their own glory, which doth only darken Christ. Which thing
the Lord doth confirm in the seventh of John (<span
id="viii.v-p19.2"></span>[Joh
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#018)<span id="viii.v-p19.2"></span>.md).
Furthermore, by the word *arise* which he useth, he signifieth that
those wolves do nourish secret destruction until they may have some
opportunity offered to break out.

<span id="viii.v-p20"></span>And this place doth very well prevent an
horrible stumbling-block and offense which Satan hath always cast in to
trouble weak consciences. If external and professed enemies do resist
the gospel, this doth not so much hurt to the Church,  <span
id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) as if inward enemies issue out of the
bosom of the Church, which at a sudden blow to the field,  <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) or which unfaithfully provoke the
people to fall away; and yet God hath from the beginning exercised his
Church with this temptation, and now doth exercise it. Wherefore, let
our faith be fortified with this defense that it fail not, if at any
time it so fall out that pastors begin to rage like wolves. He saith
they shall be “grievous wolves”, that he may the more terrify them;
secondly, they shall be authors of wicked opinions, and that to the end
they may draw disciples after them, because it cannot almost otherwise
be but that ambition will corrupt the purity of the gospel.

<span id="viii.v-p23"></span>By this it appeareth also how frivolous and
vain the brag of the Papists is touching their continual succession. For
seeing we can easily show that these horned beasts are nothing less than
that which they will be thought to be, being always convicted, they fly
unto this fortress, that they succeed the apostles by a continual
course.  <span id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) As if these did not
also succeed them, of whom Paul willeth to take heed.  <span
id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) Therefore, seeing that God, either to
prove the constancy of his \[people\], or in his just judgment doth
oftentimes suffer wolves to rage under the person of pastors, the
authority doth not consist in the name and place alone, neither is
succession anything worth unless faith and integrity be joined
therewithal. But and if the Papists object that they cannot be called
wolves, one word of Paul shall be as a touchstone to prove whether this
be so or no, that they may (saith he) draw disciples after them. And to
what end tendeth all Popish religion, save only that men’s lust and
pleasure may reign instead of God’s word? But Christ hath no disciples
where he is not counted the only master.

<span id="viii.v-p26"></span><span id="viii.v-p26.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p27"></span>**31.** *For which cause, watch.* Paul doth
again exhort them unto diligence by his own example, though he doth join
therewithal fear of danger, as if he should say that they have need of
great attention to beware; and that it is an unseemly thing that they
should be wearied who had seen his singular  <span
id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md) patience by the space of three years.
Also, he speaketh of his tears, which did add no small efficacy to his
exhortations. Whereas he saith that he admonished every one, it may be
referred as well unto the common people as unto the elders. For because
he was determined to speak such things as should be common to the whole
Church, he speaketh as if the whole body were present. Nevertheless, if
any had rather restrain it unto the order of the pastors, the meaning
shall be this, that their studies must be kindled, not only with this
speech which he now maketh, but that it is meet that they remember those
often exhortations which he did continually beat in  <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md) by the space of three years, and that
with many tears. Yet it seemeth to me to be more likely that he speaketh
of all in general.

<span id="viii.v-p30"></span><span id="viii.v-p30.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p31"></span>**32.** *I commend you to God.* He useth a
prayer which, in an oration serving to move the hearers greatly, ought
not to be counted absurd. For he did not pass for dividing his sermon
into parts as the Rhetoricians use to do, seeing no words were
sufficient to express the vehemency of the affections wherewith he was
inflamed. He had intreated already of great matters and weighty, which
did far exceed man’s ability.

<span id="viii.v-p32"></span>Therefore, he turneth himself unto prayer,
and by little and little draweth toward an end of his speech, though it
be rather an expressing of a desire than a direct prayer; as if he
should have said, that they be unable to bear so great a burthen; but he
doth wish to them new help from heaven, whereto they may trust and
overcome all temptations. And it is not to be doubted, though he speak
unto the pastors alone, but that he doth also comprehend the whole
Church. First, he commendeth them to God; secondly, to the word of his
grace. Notwithstanding, it is all one commendation; but Paul meant to
express the means whereby the Lord doth defend the salvation of his,
which (as Peter saith) is kept by faith, (<span
id="viii.v-p32.1"></span>[1Pe 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005.md)<span
id="viii.v-p32.1"></span>) and the means of this keeping dependeth upon
the word, lest it come in hazard amidst so many dangers. And it is very
expedient for us to know how God will keep us. For because his majesty
is hid from us, until we come unto him by his word, we look to and fro,
being in doubt.

<span id="viii.v-p33"></span>Therefore, so soon as he receiveth us to be
kept, he maketh his word the instrument to keep our salvation, in which
sense, he addeth the adjunct “grace,” (for the genitive case, after the
manner of the Hebrews, doth signify an effect) to the end the faithful
might the more safely rest in the word, where God doth show forth his
favor. This exposition is plain and apt; for whereas some understand it
of Christ, it is too much racked.

<span id="viii.v-p34"></span>*Who is able to build farther.* The
participle, <span id="viii.v-p34.1"></span>δυναμενος,  <span
id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) is to be referred unto God, not unto
his word. And this consolation is added for this cause, lest they faint
through the feeling of their infirmities. For so long as we be environed
with the infirmities of the flesh, we be like to an house whose
foundation is laid.  <span id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) All the
godly must be grounded indeed in Christ, but their faith is far from
being perfect. Yea, though the foundation continue stable and sure, yet
some parts of the building be like to fall and quail.  <span
id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) Wherefore, there is great need both of
continual building, and also now and then new props and stays be
necessary. Nevertheless, Paul saith that “we must not faint,” because
the Lord will not leave his work unfinished; as he doth likewise teach
in the first chapter to the Philippians,

<span id="viii.v-p38"></span>“He which hath begun a good work in you
will perform it until the day of the Lord,”*  
*(<span id="viii.v-p38.2"></span>[Php
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006)<span id="viii.v-p38.2"></span>.md).

<span id="viii.v-p39"></span>Whereto that of the Psalm (<span
id="viii.v-p39.1"></span>[Ps
138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008)<span id="viii.v-p39.1"></span>.md)
answereth,

<span id="viii.v-p40"></span>“Thou wilt not forsake the work of our
\[thy\] hands.”

<span id="viii.v-p41"></span>That which is added immediately concerning
the inheritance of life appertaineth unto the very enjoying of life. So
soon as Christ hath appeared to us,  <span
id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md) we pass indeed from death to life; and
faith is an entrance into the kingdom of heaven; neither is the Spirit
of adoption given to us in vain; but Paul promiseth in this place to the
faithful a continual increase of grace until they see the possession of
the inheritance whereunto they have been called, which is now laid up
for them in heaven. He calleth it “the power of God”, not as we use to
imagine it, without effect, but which is commonly called actual. For the
faithful must so lay hold upon it, that they may have it ready, like to
a shield, or buckler, to hold up against all assaults of Satan. As the
Scripture doth teach that we have aid enough in the power of God, so let
us remember that none are strong in the Lord save those who, abandoning
all hope and confidence of their own free will, trust and lean to him,
who, as Paul saith very well, is able to build farther.

<span id="viii.vi"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Acts
20:33-38](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#033.md)<span
id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p2"></span>**33.** I have desired no man’s silver, or
gold, or raiment. **34.** Yea, ye yourselves know how that these hands
have ministered to my necessity, and to those which were with me.
**35.** I have showed you all things, that so laboring you must receive
the weak, and remember the words of the Lord Jesus; because he said, It
is a blessed thing rather to give than take. **36.** And when he had
thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all. **37.** And
there arose great weeping among them all; and, falling upon Paul’s neck,
they kissed him, **38.** Sorrowing most for the words which he spake,
that they should see his face no more. And they brought him to the ship.

<span id="viii.vi-p3"></span> 

<span id="viii.vi-p4"></span><span id="viii.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p5"></span>**33.** *I have not.* As he showed of late
what an hurtful plague ambition is; so now he showeth that they must
beware of covetousness, \[avarice\] and he maketh himself an example
again, even in this point, that he did covet no man’s goods; but did
rather get his living with the work of his hands. Not that it was
sufficient to find him without some help, but because in applying his
handy-work, he spared the churches, that he might not be too chargeable
to them, so much as in him lay. We must note, that he doth not only deny
that he did take anything violently, as hungry fellows do importunately
wring out preys oftentimes, but also he affirmeth that he was clean from
all wicked desire. Whence we gather, that no man can be a good minister
of the word, but he must also contemn money. And surely we see that
nothing is more common, than that those corrupt the word of God, to win
the favor of men, who are altogether filthily given to get gain. Which
vice Paul doth sharply condemn in bishops elsewhere, (<span
id="viii.vi-p5.1"></span>[1Ti 3:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#003.md)<span
id="viii.vi-p5.1"></span>).

<span id="viii.vi-p6"></span><span id="viii.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p7"></span>**34.** *Yea, ye know* He doth not, in
these words, precisely set down a law which all the ministers of the
word must needs keep; for he did not behave himself so loftily and
lordlike, that he did take that away which the Lord had granted to his
servants, but doth rather in many places maintain their right, which is,
that they be maintained with that which is common, <span
id="viii.vi-p7.1"></span>[Mt
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010.md)<span id="viii.vi-p7.1"></span>;
<span id="viii.vi-p7.2"></span>[1Co
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014.md)<span id="viii.vi-p7.2"></span>;

<span id="viii.vi-p7.4"></span>[1Ti

<span id="viii.vi-p7.6"></span>[2Co
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#008.md)<span id="viii.vi-p7.6"></span>.
Whereunto belongeth that, that he suffered many churches to minister
unto him food and raiment. Neither did he only freely receive wages for
the work which he did in any place of those who were there, but when he
was in necessity at Corinth, he saith that he robbed other churches to
relieve his poverty. Therefore, he doth not simply command pastors to
maintain their life with their handy-work, but immediately after he
declareth how far forth he exhorteth them to follow his example. Those
men of Corinth did not deny him that which was due to him;  <span
id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md) but seeing that the false apostles did
boast that they did their work freely, and get thereby praise among the
people; Paul would not be behind them in this point, nor give them any
occasion to accuse him falsely; as he himself affirmeth (<span
id="viii.vi-p8.2"></span>[1Co
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#015.md)<span id="viii.vi-p8.2"></span>,
and <span id="viii.vi-p8.3"></span>[2Co
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#010)<span id="viii.vi-p8.3"></span>.md).
Therefore, he warneth that there be no stumbling-block laid in the way
of the weak, and that their faith be not overthrown. For to receive the
weak, importeth as much as somewhat to bear with their rudeness and
simplicity, as it is (<span id="viii.vi-p8.4"></span>[Ro
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001)<span id="viii.vi-p8.4"></span>.md).

<span id="viii.vi-p9"></span>*And to remember.* We read this sentence in
no place word for word; but the Evangelists have other not much unlike
this, out of which Paul might gather this. Again, we know that all the
sayings of Christ were not written; and he repeateth that general
doctrine of the contempt of money; whereof this is a true token, when a
man is more bent to give than to take. Neither did Christ speak only
politicly,  <span id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) as if those who are
liberal are therefore blessed, because they bind other men unto them
with their benefits, and it is a kind of bondage to owe anything; but he
had respect unto an higher thing, because, he which giveth to the poor
lendeth unto the Lord, (<span id="viii.vi-p10.2"></span>[Pr
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017)<span id="viii.vi-p10.2"></span>.md)
that those be faithful and good stewards of God, who impart to their
brethren some of that plenty which they have lent them; that men draw
nearer unto God in nothing than in liberality. We do also read these
titles of liberality in profane authors; and a good part of the world
confess that these things are true, but they consent (as it is in the
proverb) with ass’s ears. For the common life doth show how few be
persuaded that nothing ought more to be wished, than that we bestow our
goods to help our brethren. For which cause the disciples of Christ must
more studiously think upon this felicity, that abstaining so much as in
them lieth, from that which is another man’s, they accustom themselves
to give. And yet they must not do this with an haughty heart, as if it
were a miserable thing for them to be in any man’s danger;  <span
id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md) either through ambition, that they may
bind other men to them; but only that they may exercise themselves
willingly in the duties of love, and by this means make known the grace
of their adoption.

<span id="viii.vi-p12"></span><span id="viii.vi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p13"></span>**36.** *And kneeling down.* The inward
affection is indeed the chiefest thing in prayer; yet the external
signs, as kneeling, uncovering of the head, lifting up of the hands,
have a double use; the first is, that we exercise all our members to the
glory and worship of God; secondly, that by this exercise our
sluggishness may be awakened, as it were. There is also a third use in
solemn and public prayer, because the children of God do by this means
make profession of their godliness, and one of them doth provoke another
unto the reverence of God. And, as the lifting up of the hands is a
token of boldness  <span id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) and of an
earnest desire, so, to testify our humility, we fall down upon our
knees. But he sealeth up and concludeth that sermon which he made before
with prayer; because we can hope for no profit of our doctrine, save
only from the blessing of God. Wherefore, if we be desirous to do any
good by teaching, admonishing, and exhorting, let us always end after
this sort; to wit, with prayer.

<span id="viii.vi-p15"></span><span id="viii.vi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p16"></span>**37.** *Great weeping.* No marvel if all
the godly did entirely love this holy man. for it had been a point of
too gross unthankfulness to despise him whom the Lord had so beautified
with so many excellent gifts. And the chief cause of their weeping was,
as Luke noteth, because they should see him no more. For they did bewail
their own condition, and the condition of all the whole church of Asia,
not in vain, which they saw to be deprived of an inestimable treasure.
And when the Spirit commendeth their tears by the mouth of Luke, as
witnesses of sincere godliness, he condemneth the rashness of those who
require at the hands of the faithful hard and cruel constancy. For that
is false whereof they dream that those affections proceed only of
corruption, which we have naturally from God. Wherefore, the perfection
of the faithful consisteth not in this, that they put off all
affections; but that they be moved therewith only for just causes, and
that they may moderate the same.
