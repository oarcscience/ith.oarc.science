<span id="ix-p1"></span>Chapter 21

<span id="ix.i"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p1"></span><span id="ix.i-p1.1"></span>[Acts
21:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p2"></span>**1.** And when it came to pass that we had
loosed, being pulled away from them, we came with a straight course to
Coos, and the next day to the Rhodes, and thence to Patara; **2.** And
when we had gotten a ship, which sailed over to Phenicia, when we were
entered into it, we launched. **3.** And when Cyprus began to appear to
us, leaving it on the left hand, we sailed into Syria, and came to
Tyrus: for here the ship did unlade her burden. **4.** And when we had
found disciples, we stayed there seven days; who said to Paul by the
Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem. **5.** And when the days
were ended, we departed and went our way; and they all, with their wives
and children, accompanied us, until we were out of the city; and when we
had kneeled down upon the shore, we prayed. **6.** And when we had taken
our leave one of another, we went up into the ship; and they returned
home.

<span id="ix.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.i-p4"></span><span id="ix.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p5"></span>**1.** Luke reckoneth up briefly the course of
his sailing; and that not only to win credit to the history, that we may
know what was done in every place, but that the readers may weigh with
themselves the invincible and heroic fortitude which was in Paul, who
would rather be tossed and troubled with such long, unlevel,  <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) and troublesome journeys, that he
might serve Christ, than provide for his own quietness. Whereas he saith
that they were drawn and pulled away, it is not simply referred unto the
distance of places; but because the brethren stood on the shore, so long
as they could see the ship wherein Paul and his companions were carried.
He nameth the havens where the ship arrived,  <span
id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) for this cause that we may know that
they sailed quietly without trouble of tempest. Let us search the
describers of countries  <span id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md)
touching the situation of the cities whereof he maketh mention; it is
sufficient for me to show Luke’s purpose.

<span id="ix.i-p9"></span><span id="ix.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p10"></span>**4.** *And when they had found disciples.*
Though the number of the faithful was but small, yet there came some
seed of the gospel thither, according to the prophecies Of the prophets,
(<span id="ix.i-p10.1"></span>[Isa
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#018)<span id="ix.i-p10.1"></span>.md)
lest Tyrus should be altogether void of the blessing of God. And here,
as in other places going before, Luke calleth Christians disciples, that
we may know that those alone are numbered in the flock of Christ who
have embraced his doctrine by faith. For that is a vain  <span
id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) and false profession for a man to give
his name to Christ, and not to understand what he teacheth or speaketh.
And let the readers mark, that Paul stayed seven days at Tyrus, for no
other cause, saving that he might strengthen them. So that we see, that
whithersoever he came he foreslowed \[neglected\] no occasion to do
good.

<span id="ix.i-p12"></span>*They said by the Spirit.* Namely, with the
approbation of speech, that Paul might know that they spake by the
Spirit of prophecy. Surely this was no small temptation to cause him not
to finish the journey which he had taken in hand, seeing the Holy Ghost
did dissuade him from the same. And this was a very fair color  <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) to fly from the cross, if he had cared
for his own safety, to be drawn back as it were with the hand of God.

<span id="ix.i-p14"></span>Notwithstanding, he ceaseth not to hold on
thither whither he knew he was called by the Lord. Notwithstanding, here
ariseth a question, how the brethren can dissuade him by the Spirit from
doing that which Paul did testify he doth by the secret motion of the
same Spirit? Is the Spirit contrary to himself, that he doth now loose
Paul whom he held bound inwardly? I answer, that there be diverse gifts
of the Spirit; so that it is no marvel if those who excel in the gift of
prophecy be sometimes destitute of judgment or strength.  <span
id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) The Lord showed to these brethren, of
whom Luke maketh mention, what should come to pass; yet, nevertheless,
they know not what is expedient, and what Paul’s calling doth require,
because the measure of their gift doth not reach so far. And the Lord
would have his servant admonished of purpose, partly, that through long
meditation, he might be better furnished and prepared to suffer
whatsoever should come, partly that his constancy might more plainly
appear, when as being certified by prophecies of the doleful event, he
doth, notwithstanding, wittingly and willingly, make haste to endure
whatsoever things shall befall him.

<span id="ix.i-p16"></span><span id="ix.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p17"></span>**5.** *With their wives and children.* This
was no small testimony of love, in that they accompanied Paul out of the
city with their wives and children, which thing Luke doth report, partly
that he might commend their godliness according as it deserved; partly
that he might declare that Paul had that honor given him which was due
to him. Whence we do also gather, that he meant nothing less than to
provide for his own commodity, seeing that he was not kept back with so
great good will, which was a pleasant bait to entice him to stay. And we
must also note the solemn custom of praying in weightier affairs, and
that being certified by God of the danger, they are more stirred up to
pray.

<span id="ix.ii"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p1"></span><span id="ix.ii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
21:7-14](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#007.md)<span id="ix.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p2"></span>**7.** And when we had finished our course
from Tyre, we came down to Ptolemais, and after that we had saluted the
brethren, we abode with them one day. **8.** And on the morrow, we which
were with Paul departed, and came to Cesarea; and, entering into the
house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven, we abode
with him. **9.** And this man had four daughters, virgins, which did
prophesy. **10.** And when we abode many days, there came a certain
prophet from Judea, named Agabus. **11.** When he was come to us, he
took, Paul’s girdle, and, binding his own feet and hands, he said, Thus
saith the Holy Ghost, The man which owneth this girdle shall the Jews
thus bind at Jerusalem, and shall deliver him into the hands of the
Gentiles. **12.** And when we had heard these things, both we, and also
the rest which were of that place, requested him that he would not go up
to Jerusalem. **13.** Then Paul answered and said, What do you, weeping
and afflicting my heart? I truly am ready not to be bound only, but also
to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus. **14.** And when he
would not be persuaded, we were quiet, saying, The will of the Lord be
done.

<span id="ix.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.ii-p4"></span><span id="ix.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p5"></span>**7.** Luke doth briefly declare that Paul
was also received at Ptolemais by the brethren. This is a city of
Phenicia, standing upon the sea-coast, not far from the borders of
Judea, from which Paul and his companions had no long journey to
Cesarea. But if the readers be disposed to know farther touching the
situation of regions, let them resort unto the describers of places and
countries \[geographers\]. Furthermore, he saith, that when he came to
Cesarea, they lodged with Philip, whom he calleth an Evangelist, though
he were one of the seven deacons, as we may see in the sixth chapter
(<span id="ix.ii-p5.1"></span>[Ac
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/act006.htm#005)<span id="ix.ii-p5.1"></span>.md). By
this we may easily gather, that that deaconship was an office which
continued but for a time;  <span id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md)
because it had not otherwise been lawful for Philip to forsake
Jerusalem, and to go to Cesarea. And in this place he is set before us,
not as a voluntary forsaker of his office, but as one to whom a greater
and more excellent charge was committed. The evangelists, in my
judgment, were in the midst between apostles and doctors. For it was a
function next to the apostles to preach the gospel in all places, and
not to have any certain place of abode;  <span
id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md) only the degree of honor was inferior.
For when Paul describeth the order of the Church, (<span
id="ix.ii-p7.2"></span>[Eph 4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011.md)<span
id="ix.ii-p7.2"></span>) he doth so put them after the apostles, that he
showeth that they have more room given them where they may teach than
the pastors, who are tied to certain places. Therefore, Philip did for a
time exercise the office of a deacon at Jerusalem, whom the Church
thought afterward to be a meet man to whom the treasure of the gospel
should be committed.

<span id="ix.ii-p8"></span><span id="ix.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p9"></span>**9.** *Four daughters.* This is added for
the commendation of Philip, not only that we might know that his house
was well ordered, but also that it was famous and excellent through the
blessing of God. For, assuredly, it was no small gift to have four
daughters all endowed with the spirit of prophecy.

<span id="ix.ii-p10"></span>By this means the Lord meant to beautify the
first beginnings of the gospel, when he raised up men and women to
foretell things to come. Prophecies had now almost ceased many years
among the Jews, to the end they might be more attentive and desirous to
hear the new voice of the gospel. Therefore, seeing that prophesying,
which was in a manner quite ceased, doth now after long time return
again, it was a token of a more perfect state. Notwithstanding, it
seemeth that the same was the reason why it ceased shortly after; for
God did support the old people with diverse foretellings, until Christ
should make an end of all prophecies.  <span
id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md) Therefore, it was meet that the new
kingdom of Christ should be thus furnished and beautified with this
furniture, that all men might know that that promised visitation of the
Lord was present; and it was also expedient that it should last but for
a short time, lest the faithful should always wait for some farther
thing, or lest that curious wits might have occasion given to seek or
invent some new thing ever now and then. For we know that when that
ability and skill was taken away, there were, notwithstanding, many
brain-sick fellows, who did boast that they were prophets; and also it
may be that the frowardness of men did deprive the Church of this gift.
But that one cause ought to be sufficient, in that God, by taking away
prophecies, did testify that the end and perfection was present in
Christ; and it is uncertain how these maids did execute the office of
prophesying, saving that the Spirit of God did so guide and govern them,
that he did not overthrow the order which he himself set down. And
forasmuch as he doth not suffer women to bear any public office in the
Church, it is to be thought that they did prophesy at home, or in some
private place, without the common assembly.

<span id="ix.ii-p12"></span><span id="ix.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p13"></span>**10.** *A certain prophet.* Though Luke
doth not plainly express the same, yet do I conjecture that this Agabus
was the same of whom mention is made in the eleventh chapter, (<span
id="ix.ii-p13.1"></span>[Ac 11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028.md)<span
id="ix.ii-p13.1"></span>) who foretold that there should be famine under
the reign of Claudius Caesar. And when as Luke calleth him a prophet, as
of late he called, the four daughters of Philip, he signifieth that it
was not a common but a peculiar gift. Now, we must see to what end the
persecution which was at hand was now again showed by Agabus. As
concerning Paul, he was sufficiently told already.  <span
id="fr_460"></span>[461](#fn_460.md) Therefore, I do not doubt but that
this confirmation was added for other men’s sake; because the Lord meant
every where to make known the bonds of his servant, partly that they
might know that he entered the combat willingly, partly that they might
perceive that he was appointed of God to be a champion to fight for the
gospel. It was surely a profitable example of invincible constancy,
seeing that he offered himself willingly and wittingly to the violence
of the adversaries; and no less profitable is it for us at this day,
that his apostleship should be confirmed with this voluntary and no less
constant giving over of his life.

<span id="ix.ii-p15"></span>*The man who owneth this girdle.* It was an
usual thing among the prophets to represent those things which they
spake by signs; neither did they confirm their prophecies by using
signs, through their own motion, but at the commandment of the Spirit,
as when Isaias is commanded to go barefoot, (<span
id="ix.ii-p15.1"></span>[Isa 20:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#002.md)<span
id="ix.ii-p15.1"></span>) Jeremiah to put a yoke upon his neck, to sell
the possession and to buy it, (<span id="ix.ii-p15.2"></span>[Jer
27:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#002.md)<span id="ix.ii-p15.2"></span>,
and <span id="ix.ii-p15.3"></span>[Jer
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#007)<span id="ix.ii-p15.3"></span>.md)
and Ezekiel to dig through the wall of his house privily, and in the
same night to carry forth burthens, (<span id="ix.ii-p15.4"></span>[Eze
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#005)<span id="ix.ii-p15.4"></span>.md).
These and such like might seem to the common sort to be toys;  <span
id="fr_461"></span>[462](#fn_461.md) but the same Spirit, who did apply
signs to his words, did inwardly touch the hearts of the godly, as if
they had been brought to the very thing itself. So this spectacle,
mentioned by Luke, did no less move Paul’s companions, than if they had
seen him bound in deed. The false prophets did afterward essay to delude
the simple by this policy, as Satan is in a manner God’s ape, and his
ministers do envy the servants of God. Zedekias made himself horns,
wherewith he promised Syria should be pushed. Ananias, by breaking
Jeremiah’s yoke, put the people in a vain hope of deliverance. God hath
suffered the reprobate to be deluded with such delusions, that he might
punish their unbelief.

<span id="ix.ii-p17"></span>But, forasmuch as there was in them no force
of the Spirit, their vanity did no whit hurt the faithful. This is also
worthy to be noted, that Agabus doth not set before their eyes a dumb
spectacle, but he coupleth therewith the word, whereby he may show to
the faithful the use and end of the ceremony.

<span id="ix.ii-p18"></span><span id="ix.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p19"></span>**12.** *Both we.* Because they had not all
one revelation, it is no marvel if their judgments were diverse. For
seeing these holy men knew that there consisted much in the life or
death of one man, they would not have him to come in danger rashly. And
their desire is worthy \[of\] praise, in that they desired to provide
for the common safety of the Church by keeping back Paul. But, on the
other side, Paul’s constancy deserveth so much the more praise, when as
he continueth so steadfast  <span id="fr_462"></span>[463](#fn_462.md) in
the calling of God. For he was not ignorant what great trouble he should
suffer by reason of his bands. But because he knoweth the will of God,
which was his only rule in taking counsel, he maketh no account of all
other things, that he may follow it. And, assuredly, we must be so
subject to the will and pleasure of God, that no profit, no kind of
reason may remove us from obeying him.  <span
id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md) When Paul doth reprehend the brethren,
because they afflict his heart with weeping, he doth sufficiently
declare that he was not hardened,  <span
id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md) but that he was brought unto some
feeling and suffering together with them.  <span
id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md) Therefore, the tears of the godly did
wound his heart; but that softness did not turn him out of the way, but
that he proceeded to follow God with a straight course. Therefore, we
must use such courtesy toward our brethren, that the beck or will of God
have always the upper hand. Now Paul doth again declare by his answer,
that the servants of Christ cannot be prepared to do their duty, unless
they despise death; and that none can ever be well encouraged to live to
the Lord, but those who will willingly lay down their lives for the
testimony of the truth.

<span id="ix.ii-p24"></span><span id="ix.ii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p25"></span>**14.** *We ceased saying.* If they had
thought that he ran rashly unto death, they would not have ceased so.
Therefore, they yield lest they resist the Holy Spirit, whereby they
understand that Paul is governed. For that which they had heard before,
by the mouth of Paul, that he was drawn, as it were, by the bands of the
Spirit, was quite out of their heads by reason of the sorrow which they
had conceived; but when they be taught again that it was the will of God
that it should be so, they think it unlawful for them to resist any
longer. And with this bridle must all our affections be kept in, that
nothing be so bitter, or doleful, or hard, which the will of God may not
mitigate and mollify. For so often as any thing which is hard or sharp
doth fall out, we give God small honor, unless this cogitation prevail
with us, that we must obey him.

<span id="ix.iii"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p1"></span><span id="ix.iii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
21:15-25](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#015.md)<span id="ix.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p2"></span>**15.** And after these days, having taken
up our burdens, we went up to Jerusalem. **16.** And there came together
with us certain of the disciples from Cesarea, bringing with them one
Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge. **17.**
And when we were come unto Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
**18.** And on the morrow Paul went in with us unto James; and all the
elders were present. **19.** Whom after we had saluted, he told by order
all things which God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.
**20.** But when they had heard, they glorified the Lord, and said to
him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousand Jews the be which believe;
and they all are earnest followers of the law; **21.** And it hath been
told them concerning thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are
among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they must not
circumcise their children, nor live according to the customs. **22.**
What is it then? The multitude must needs come together; for they shall
hear that thou art come. **23.** Therefore, do this which we say to
thee: We have four men which have a vow upon them; **24.** Them take,
and purify thyself with them, and do cost on them, that they may shave
their heads, and that all men may know that those things which they have
heard concerning thee are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest
and keepest the law. **25.** And as concerning those which among the
Gentiles have believed, we have written, decreeing that they observe no
such thing, but that they keep themselves from things offered to idols,
and from blood, and from that which is strangled, and from fornication.

<span id="ix.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.iii-p4"></span><span id="ix.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p5"></span>**15.** *When we had taken up our burdens.*
Paul’s companions declare, that when they went about to call back Paul
from danger, they did rather care for the common safety of the Church,
than every man for his own life. For after they had taken the repulse,
they do not refuse to take part with him in the same danger; and yet
this was a plausible excuse that they were bound by no law to be hauled
to suffer death, through one man’s stubbornness. And this is truly to
bring our affections in subjection to God, when we are terrified with no
fear, but every one of us endeavoreth, so much as he is able, to further
that which we know doth please him. Also, it appeareth more plainly what
great ferventness of godliness was in the rest, who of their own accord
accompany him, and bring him an host; whereas, notwithstanding, they
might well have feared many discommodities.

<span id="ix.iii-p6"></span><span id="ix.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p7"></span>**17.** *They received us gladly.* Luke
reciteth this, therefore, that he may set forth the equity of the
brethren, who did not credit rumors  <span
id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md) and false reports. Though many envious
and wicked men did daily, one after another, endeavor to bring Paul in
contempt, yet, because James and his fellows in office were well
persuaded of his uprightness, they were not estranged from him.
Therefore, they receive him now courteously and brotherly as a servant
of Christ, and declare that he is welcome. This moderation must we
observe diligently, that we be not too hasty to believe wicked reports,
especially when those who have given some testimony of their honesty,
and whom we have tried  <span id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md) to serve
God faithfully, are burdened with crimes unknown to us, or else
doubtful, because Satan knoweth that nothing is more fit to lay waste
the kingdom of Christ, than discord and disagreement among the faithful,
he ceaseth not to spread abroad false  <span
id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md) speeches, which may cause one to
suspect another. Therefore, we must shut our ears against false reports,
that we may believe nothing concerning the faithful ministers of the
Word, but that which we know to be true.

<span id="ix.iii-p11"></span><span id="ix.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p12"></span>**18.** *All the elders were present.* We
may gather that out of this place which we had already in the fifteenth
chapter. So often as any weighty business was to be handled, the elders
were wont to come together, to the end the consultation might be more
quiet without the multitude. We shall see anon, that the people were
likewise admitted in their order, yet after that the elders had had
their secret consultation  <span id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) among
themselves.

<span id="ix.iii-p14"></span><span id="ix.iii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p15"></span>**19.** And now Paul showeth his modesty
when he doth not make himself the author of those things which he had
done, but giving the praise to God, doth call himself only the minister
whose industry \[agency\] God had used. As we must grant, that
whatsoever thing is excellent and worthy of praise, it is not done by
our own power, but forasmuch as God doth work in us; and especially
touching the edifying of the Church. Again, it appeareth how far off the
elders were from envy, when they glorify God for the joyful success. But
because mention is made of no other apostle besides James, we may
conjecture that they were gone into diverse places to spread abroad and
preach the gospel as their calling did require; for the Lord had not
appointed them to stay still at Jerusalem; but after they had made a
beginning there, he commanded them to go into Judea and other parts of
the world. Moreover, the error of those men, who think that James was
one of the disciples whom Paul numbereth among the three pillars of the
Church, is refuted before in the fifteenth chapter. And though the same
commandment was given to him which was given to the rest of his fellows
in office; yet I do not doubt but that they did so divide themselves,
that James stood still at Jerusalem, whither many strangers were wont
daily to resort. For that was all one as if he had preached the gospel
far and wide in strange  <span id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) places.

<span id="ix.iii-p17"></span>*Thou seest, brother, how many thousands.*
This oration or speech hath two members. For, first, the elders say,
that so many of the Jews as were converted, seeing they be earnest
followers of the law, are evil affected towards Paul, because they think
that he endeavoreth, with might and main, to abolish the law. Secondly,
they exhort him that making a solemn vow he purge himself, that he may
not be had in suspicion any longer. They object to Paul, the multitude
of believers, that he may the more willingly yield to them. For if they
had been a few stubborn fellows, he would not have been so much moved.
But now he may not neglect both much people, and the whole body of the
Church.

<span id="ix.iii-p18"></span>Undoubtedly, that zeal of the law, which
was in them, was corrupt, and assuredly even the very elders declare
sufficiently that they like it not. For though they do not condemn it
openly, neither sharply complain of the same, yet because they separate
themselves from their affection, they secretly confess that they err. If
it had been a zeal according to knowledge, it ought to have begun at
them; \[selves\] but they contend not for the law itself, neither do
they pretend the due reverence thereof, neither do they subscribe to
those who are earnest followers of it. Therefore, they both signify that
they are of another mind, and also that they do not allow \[approve\]
the superstition of the people.

<span id="ix.iii-p19"></span>Notwithstanding it is objected, that they
say that Paul was burdened with a false report or slander; again, when
they require at his hands satisfaction, they seem to nourish that zeal.
I answer, that though that were a true report, in some respect,
wherewith the Jews were offended, yet was it mixed with a slander. Paul
did so teach the abrogating of the law, that notwithstanding by this
means the authority thereof did not only continue sound and perfect, but
it was more holy. For as we said, in the seventh chapter, the ceremonies
should be vain, unless the effect thereof had been showed in Christ.
Therefore, those who say that they were abolished by the coming of
Christ, are so far from being blasphemous against the law, that they
rather confirm the truth thereof. We must consider two things in
ceremonies; the truth, whereto is annexed the efficacy; secondly, the
external use. Furthermore, the abrogating of the external use, which
Christ brought, dependeth hereupon, in that he is the sound body,  <span
id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) and that nothing was shadowed in times
past which is not fulfilled in him. This differeth much from the falling
away from the law, to show the true  <span
id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) end thereof, that the figures may have
an end, and that the spiritual truth thereof may always be in force.
Wherefore we see that they were malicious and unjust interpreters, who
laid apostacy to Paul’s charge, though he did call away the faithful
from the external worship of the law. And whereas they command Paul to
make a vow to that end, that he may prove himself to be a keeper of the
law, it tendeth to no other end, saving that he may testify that he doth
not detest the law like a wicked apostate, who did himself shake off the
Lord’s yoke, and move others unto the like rebellion.

<span id="ix.iii-p22"></span>*That they ought not to circumcise.* It was
so indeed; for Paul taught that both Jews and Gentiles were set at
liberty. For these sentences are general with him. Circumcision is
nothing (<span id="ix.iii-p22.1"></span>[1Co
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#019)<span id="ix.iii-p22.1"></span>.md).
Again, We be circumcised by baptism in Christ, not with circumcision
made with hands; again, Let no man judge you in meat or drink, or in the
choice of feasts, which are shadows of things to come; but the body is
in Christ (<span id="ix.iii-p22.2"></span>[Col.
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#011.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016)<span id="ix.iii-p22.2"></span>.md).
Again, Whatsoever cometh into the shambles, and whatsoever is set before
you, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake (<span
id="ix.iii-p22.3"></span>[1Co
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#025)<span id="ix.iii-p22.3"></span>.md).
Again, Be not inwrapped again in the yoke of bondage (<span
id="ix.iii-p22.4"></span>[Ga 5:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.iii-p22.4"></span>). Seeing that he spake thus everywhere without
exception, he freed the Jews from the necessity of keeping the law.

<span id="ix.iii-p23"></span>And lest I stand too long upon this, one
place shall be sufficient, where he compareth the law to a tutor, under
which the old Church was, as in the childhood thereof; but now knowing
the grace of Christ, it is grown up, that it may be free from
ceremonies. In that place he speaketh undoubtedly both of the Jews and
Gentiles. Also, when he saith that the hand-writing of the law, which
did consist in decrees, (<span id="ix.iii-p23.1"></span>[Col
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014)<span id="ix.iii-p23.1"></span>.md)
is blotted out and nailed to the cross by Christ, he setteth free the
Jews, as well as the Gentiles, from the ceremonies, which he calleth in
that place decrees. But seeing that he did not precisely reject
ceremonies, in teaching that the coming of Christ did make an end of the
observing thereof, that was no revolting, as the envious Jews thought it
to be.

<span id="ix.iii-p24"></span>Neither were the elders ignorant of Paul’s
liberty. Therefore, seeing they understand the matter very well, their
meaning is, to have this alone made known to the rude and unskillful,
that Paul meant nothing less than to persuade the Jews to contemn the
law. Therefore, they behold not the bare matter, but knowing what the
common sort thought of Paul, by reason of the reports  <span
id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) which went about concerning him, they
seek to cure the same. Though I wot not whether this were more
importunate than equal, \[just\] which they required at Paul’s hands.
And by this it appeareth how preposterous the cruelty \[credulity\] of
men is in receiving false reports, and how fast a false opinion, once
rashly received, doth stick. It is certain that James and his fellows in
office did endeavor to maintain and defend Paul’s good report, and to
put away those lies which did hurt his estimation; yet let them do what
they can, they will speak evil of Paul. Unless, peradventure, they were
too slack in the beginning, that they might gratify their countrymen, so
that they were not their own men \[free\] afterward.

<span id="ix.iii-p26"></span><span id="ix.iii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p27"></span>**22.** *The multitude must needs come
together.* The verb is a verb neuter, as if they should say, the
multitude must of necessity come together. For it had been an absurd
thing that an apostle, of such rare report, should not come before the
whole multitude of the faithful. For if he had eschewed the light and
sight of people, the sinister suspicion might have been increased.
Nevertheless, we see how modestly the elders behaved themselves in
nourishing concord, when as they prevent the offense of the people in
time, saving that they bear too much  <span
id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) peradventure with their infirmity, in
requiring a vow of Paul. But this moderation must be kept in the Church,
that the pastors be in great authority, and yet that they rule not
proudly as lords, neither despise the rest of the body. For the
distinction of orders, which is the bond of peace, ought not to be any
cause of dissension.

<span id="ix.iii-p29"></span><span id="ix.iii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p30"></span>**23.** *Do that which we say to thee.* The
elders seem (as I said even now) to be fallen unto a foolish pampering
\[indulgence\] through too much love of their nation. But the manifest
judgment of that thing  <span id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md)
dependeth upon the circumstances which are hid from us at this day: yet
they knew them well. The whole body almost did consist upon \[of\] Jews,
so that they needed not to fear the offending of the Gentiles. For in
other regions this was the cause of departure,  <span
id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md) because every man was wedded to his
own custom, and would prescribe a law to others. Furthermore, they had
at Jerusalem many things which might provoke them to keep the ceremonies
of the law, so that they had a greater excuse if they did more slowly
forsake them. And though their zeal were not void of fault, yet as it
was an hard matter to reform it, so it could not be done at a sudden. We
see how this superstition was scarce in long time pulled from the
apostles; and because new disciples came daily unto the faith, the
infirmity was nourished in all together. And yet, notwithstanding, we
must not deny but that ignorance was coupled with obstinacy, which the
elders did nevertheless tolerate, lest they should do more hurt by using
violent remedies. I leave it indifferent whether they did pass measure
or no.  <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md)

<span id="ix.iii-p34"></span>*Having a vow upon them.* Though these four
be reckoned among the faithful, yet their vow was superstitious. Whereby
it appeareth that the apostles had much trouble in that nation, which
was not only hardened in the worship of the law through long use, but
was also naturally malapert, and almost intractable. Though it may be
that these men were as yet but novices, and therefore their faith was
yet but slender, and scarce well framed; wherefore the doctors did
suffer them to perform the vow which they had unadvisedly made. As
touching Paul, because he made this vow not moved thereunto by his own
conscience, but for their sakes, with whose error he did bear, the case
stood otherwise with him. Notwithstanding, we must see whether this were
one of the indifferent ceremonies, which the faithful might omit or keep
at their pleasure. It seemeth, indeed, to have in it certain things
which did not agree  <span id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md) with the
profession of faith. But because the end thereof was thanksgiving, (as
we said before in the eighteenth chapter) and there was nothing in the
rite itself repugnant to the faith of Christ, Paul did not doubt to
descend thus far to make his religion known. Therefore, Paul did that
which he saith of himself elsewhere, because he made himself a companion
of those which followed the law, as if he himself were in subjection to
the law (<span id="ix.iii-p35.2"></span>[1Co
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020)<span id="ix.iii-p35.2"></span>.md).
Finally, he was made all things to all men, that he might win all; to
wit, even unto the altars, so that he might pollute himself with no
sacrilege under a color of love.  <span
id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md) It had not been so lawful for him to
go unto the solemn sacrifice of satisfaction.  <span
id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md) But as for this part of the worship of
God, which consisted in a vow, he might do it indifferently, so it were
not done for religion’s sake, but only to support the weak. But it was
neither his intent to worship God with this rite, neither was his
conscience tied, but he did freely submit himself to his weak brethren.

<span id="ix.iii-p38"></span><span id="ix.iii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p39"></span>**24.** *Which they have heard of thee are
nothing.* They seem to persuade Paul to dissemble. For the rumor rose
not upon nothing, that he did call away the Jews from the ceremonies,
and that he did not walk in observing the law. But we must remember that
which I said even now, that it was sufficient for Paul and the elders,
if they could remove the slander which was unjustly raised, to wit, that
he was a revolt \[apostate\] from the law, and there might a better
opportunity be offered shortly, that in purging himself he might call
them back by little and little from their error. Neither was it good or
profitable that Paul should be counted an observer of the law any long
time, as the disciples were then commonly; for by this means a thick
 <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) veil should have been put
before their eyes to darken the light of Christ.

<span id="ix.iii-p41"></span>Wherefore, let us know that Paul did not
dissemble, but sincerely professed that he did not hate the law, but
that he did rather think reverently of it. They will him to bestow cost
together with them, because they were wont to put their money together
that they might offer sacrifice together.

<span id="ix.iii-p42"></span><span id="ix.iii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p43"></span>**25.** *And as concerning those which have
believed.* They add this lest they be thought to go about to take away
or call back that liberty which they had granted to the Gentiles, so
that they may be burdened with some prejudice. But, in the mean season,
they seem to keep the Jews in bondage, from which they set free the
Gentiles alone in plain words. I answer, forasmuch as the estate of all
was alike, like liberty was granted to both. But there is mention made
of the Jews, who were so addicted to their observations and ceremonies,
that they would not take to themselves that liberty which they might
well challenge. But the apostles did by name provide for the Gentiles,
lest the Jews, after their wonted custom, should reject them as profane
and unclean, because they were neither circumcised, neither nousled up
\[educated\] in the worship of the law. Moreover, lest I load the paper
with a superfluous repetition, let the readers repair unto the fifteenth
chapter, (<span id="ix.iii-p43.1"></span>[Ac
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#020)<span id="ix.iii-p43.1"></span>.md)
where they shall find those things which appertain unto the exposition
of this decree.

<span id="ix.iv"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p1"></span><span id="ix.iv-p1.1"></span>[Acts
21:26-30](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#026.md)<span id="ix.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p2"></span>**26.** Then when Paul had taken the men, on
the morrow, being purified with them, he entered into the temple,
declaring the fulfilling of the days of purification until an offering
might be offered for every one of them. **27.** And when the seven days
were now almost ended, certain Jews of Asia, when they saw him in the
temple, moved the people, and laid hands on him, **28.** Crying, Men of
Israel, help: This is that man, which teacheth all men everywhere
against the people, and the law, and this place. Moreover, he hath also
brought Grecians into the temple, and hath defiled this holy place.
**29.** For they had seen Trophimus an Ephesian in the city with him,
whom they thought Paul had brought into the temple. **30.** And all the
whole city was moved, and the people ran together: and when they had
caught Paul, they drew him out of the temple: and by and by the doors
were shut.

<span id="ix.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.iv-p4"></span><span id="ix.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p5"></span>**26.** Whereas some accuse Paul of subtilty,
 <span id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) as if he did play the
hypocrite, I have before refuted this. Yet I do not deny but that he
granted to do thus much at the request of the brethren, being thereunto
in a manner enforced. Therefore, it hath more color, and is (as they
say) more disputable, that he was too easily entreated, and too ready to
obey; and yet I do not admit that which some men say, that it went not
well with Paul, because, taking upon him a new and unwonted person, he
did not so constantly, as he was wont, maintain the liberty purchased by
Christ. I confess, indeed, that God doth oftentimes punish foolish
purposes with unhappy success; but I see not why this should be applied
to Paul, who through voluntary subjection sought to win the favor of the
rude, and such as were not thoroughly instructed, that he might do them
good; being about to do that not willingly, but because he had rather
yield to the brethren than stick to his own judgment. Furthermore, when
he was once admitted, he might fitly have passed over to moderate that
zeal. His courtesy doth rather deserve great praise, in that he doth not
only gently abase himself for the unskillful people’s sake, but doth
also obey  <span id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) their foolishness who
did unworthily, and against reason, suspect him. He might well have
reproved  <span id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) them, because they had
been so ready to believe reports contrary to his estimation
\[reputation\]. In that he abstaineth, he showeth great patience; in
that he winneth their favor so carefully, it is singular modesty.

<span id="ix.iv-p9"></span>Moreover, he might have been more rough and
round with  <span id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) James and his
fellows in office, because they had not been more diligent to root out
errors from among the people. For though it be certain that they taught
faithfully, yet it may be that the sight of the temple, and the very
seat of the law, did hinder them in defending the use of liberty. But
Paul, whether he went from his right of his own accord, or whether he
think that they see better what is expedient than he, doth follow  <span
id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md) their counsel. And whereas false
Nicodemites, following this example of Paul, go about to color their
treacherous dissimulation, whilst they pollute themselves with all
filthiness of Popery, it needeth no long refutation. They boast that
they do this to win the weak brethren, (or that they follow their vein
thus far) as if Paul did yield to them in all things without choice. If,
being Jews, they should take upon them according to the pre-script of
the law, to fulfill among the Jews a vow infected with no idolatry, then
might they prove themselves to be like Paul. Now, forasmuch as they
inwrap themselves in gross and altogether wicked superstitions, and that
because they will escape the cross, what likelihood is that which they
imagine?  <span id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md)

<span id="ix.iv-p13"></span><span id="ix.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p14"></span>**27.** *The Jews which came from Asia.* It
is certain that these men were enemies to the name of Christ and of
Christians, so that whilst Paul is bent to pacify the faithful, he
incurreth the rage of the enemies. Those of Asia are, indeed, the
raisers of the tumult; but the minds of all the people were so corrupt
with the hatred of him that they all became partners in the fury. But
this place teacheth, that we must not take it impatiently if at any time
our hope be frustrate, and our counsels, which we have taken with a
right and holy affection, fall not out well, that our actions may have
an happy end. We must attempt nothing but with a good conscience, and
according to the Spirit of God. But and if things come not to pass as we
would, even then, let that inward feeling uphold us, that we know that
God alloweth \[approveth\] our desire, though it be laid open to the
reproaches and mocks of men; neither let it repent us of our gentleness,
if at any time the wicked reward us otherwise than we deserve.

<span id="ix.iv-p15"></span><span id="ix.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p16"></span>**28.** *Men of Israel, help.* They cry out
as if they were in extreme danger, and they call upon all men to help
them, as if all religion were in hazard. Whereby we see with what
furious hatred they were inflamed against Paul, only because in showing
that the full and perfect truth is found in Christ, he taught that the
figures of the law had an end. Now, whereas they conceive a false
opinion, having seen Trophimus, they do more betray by this headlong
lightness how venomous they be. They accuse Paul of sacrilege. Why?
because he brought into the temple a man which was uncircumcised. But
they laid a most cruel  <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) crime to
the charge of an innocent through a false opinion. Thus the boldness of
those men useth commonly to be preposterous who are carried away with an
opinion conceived before. But let us learn by such examples to beware of
the distemperature of affections, and not to let light prejudices have
the rein, lest we run headlong upon the innocent, being carried with
blind force.

<span id="ix.iv-p18"></span><span id="ix.iv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p19"></span>**30.** *And the city was moved.* We see in
this place the vanity of the common people, which count Paul a condemned
man before ever they hear him. Whereas the city is moved about
godliness,  <span id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) “it is no marvel;
but this is a point of perverse zeal and mad rashness, in that they set
themselves against Paul before they know his matter. For in this
corruption of nature frowardness is joined with foolishness, so that
those will readily, of their own accord, make haste to maintain an evil
cause who can hardly be moved with many exhortations to do well. This is
a hard case, that the whole world should be armed against us at a
sudden, through the persuasion of a few; but seeing it pleaseth the Lord
it should be so, let every one of us prepare himself by this, and such
like examples, to suffer all manner \[of\] assaults, and to bear and
abide all brunts.

<span id="ix.v"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p1"></span><span id="ix.v-p1.1"></span>[Acts
21:31-40](../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#031.md)<span id="ix.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p2"></span>**31.** And as they sought to kill him, it was
told the captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
**32.** Who took with him straightway soldiers and under captains, and
ran down unto them: but they, when they saw the chief captain and the
soldiers, left smiting of Paul. **33.** Then the chief captain drew
near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and
he asked what he was, and what he had done. **34.** And some cried one
thing, and some another, among the people: and when he could not know
the truth, by reason of the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into
the camp. **35.** And when he came to the stairs, it happened that he
was carried of \[by\] the soldiers, because of the violence of the
multitude. **36.** For the multitude of people followed, crying, Away
with him. **37.** And when Paul began to be carried into the camp, he
saith to the captain, May I speak to thee? Who said, Canst thou speak
Greek? **38.** Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days
madest an uproar, and leddest into the wilderness four thousand men
which were murderers? **39.** And Paul said, I verily am a man which am
a Jew, born in Tarsus, a citizen of no vile city of Cilicia: but I
beseech thee suffer me to speak to the people. **40.** And when he had
given him leave, Paul, standing upon the stairs, beckoned with the hand
unto the people. And when there was made great silence, he spake in the
Hebrew tongue, saying.

<span id="ix.v-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.v-p4"></span><span id="ix.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p5"></span>**31.** *As they sought to kill him.*
Assuredly the force of Satan appeareth therein, in that he driveth the
people headlong into such rage, that when they have shut the doors of
the temple, being not content with mean punishment, they conspire to put
Paul to death. We must thus think with ourselves that Satan doth prick
forward the enemies of godliness, lest their rage, how cruel and
troublesome soever it be, trouble us. On the other side appeareth the
wonderful goodness of God, when as he raiseth up the chief captain at a
sudden, that he may deliver Paul from death. He himself thought upon no
such thing, but he came to appease the tumult which was raised among the
people; but the Lord showeth a more evident token of his providence,
because Paul’s life was delivered from such present danger without man’s
counsel. Thus doth he suffer the faithful not only to labor, but to be
almost oppressed, that he may deliver them from death more wonderfully.
Luke calleth him the chief captain \[tribune\] of the band  <span
id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) improperly, seeing every chief captain
was set over a thousand, which cloth also appear by the text, where he
saith that the chief captain took with him under captains?  <span
id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md)

<span id="ix.v-p8"></span><span id="ix.v-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p9"></span>**32.** *And when they saw the chief captain.*
Those whose fury neither the majesty of God, nor yet the reverence of
the temple, could once stay, begin to relent when they see a profane
man. Whereby it appeareth that they were set on fire rather with
barbarous cruelty than zeal. Now, whereas the chief captain bindeth Paul
with chains, he declareth thereby sufficiently that he came not to ease
him. The unbelievers would attribute this to fortune; but the Spirit
hath depainted out unto us the providence of God as in a table
\[picture\] reigning amidst the confused uproars of men. And though this
be very hard that this holy minister of God is so shamefully handled,
yet the equity of the chief captain is to be commended if he be compared
with the Jews. He bindeth him with chains, as if he were some evil-doer,
or some wicked person; yet doth he vouchsafe to hear him when he is
bound, whom they did beat unmercifully; neither doth he determine to
handle him hardly before he knew his ca, use. Yea, this was the best way
to mitigate their cruelty, because they thought \[hoped\] that Paul
should be punished immediately.

<span id="ix.v-p10"></span><span id="ix.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p11"></span>**34.** *Some cried one thing, and some
another.* The madness of the raging people doth betray itself on every
side. They make horrible outcries, whereof one is contrary to another.
Nevertheless, they desire with one consent to have him put to death who
was convicted of no offense. In the mean season, we need not doubt but
that they were blinded with a color of holy zeal. But the truth of the
cause well known maketh men truly zealous, as it maketh them true
martyrs of God, but rage betrayeth devilish madness. Whereas mention is
made in this place of the camp or fortress, we must know that the
soldiers, which were placed to guard the city, had a place which was
trenched and fortified on every side, which they might defend as if it
were a castle, and from which they might beat back all assaults, if any
sedition were raised. For it had not been good for them to have been
dispersed here and there in diverse inns,  <span
id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) seeing the people were treacherous,
and the city troublesome. And we gather by this that the place was high,
because Luke saith, that when they came to the steps, Paul was carried
of \[by\] the soldiers. And whether the soldiers did lift Paul up on
high that they might bring him safe to the station or camp, or he was
thus tossed with the violence of the crowd, this was no duty \[office\]
of favor. But the greater the cruelty of those which followed him was,
God did more plainly declare that he was favorable to his servant in
sparing his life, lest if he should have been murdered in the tumult,
his death should have wanted due fruit.

<span id="ix.v-p13"></span><span id="ix.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p14"></span>**37.** *May I speak unto thee?* Paul offered
himself to defend his cause, which all the servants of God must do. For
we must do our endeavor to make our integrity known to all men, lest
through our infamy the name of God be blasphemed. But when the chief
captain demandeth whether Paul be not that Egyptian which was a
murderer, which a little before had led away a company of men,  <span
id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) let us learn that how modestly and
quietly soever the ministers of Christ behave themselves, and howsoever
they be void of all fault, yet cannot they escape the reproaches and
slanders of the world. Which thing we must note for this cause, that we
may acquaint ourselves with rebukes;  <span
id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) and that in well-doing we may be
prepared to be evil-spoken of. When he asketh him concerning the
Egyptian, he meaneth not Theudas the sorcerer, as some men falsely
suppose; of whom Gamaliel made mention before in the fifth chapter,
(<span id="ix.v-p16.2"></span>[Ac
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#036)<span id="ix.v-p16.2"></span>.md) and
of whom Josephus speaketh more in his twentieth of Antiquities. For,
besides that we read there that Theudas carried away only four hundred
men, and the chief captain reckoneth up in this place four thousand, and
saith that they were all murderers, that is more, in that Theudas raised
that faction during the reign of Tiberius or Augustus Caesar; whereof
remained only an obscure report, because, so soon as a troop of horsemen
was sent after them, they were forthwith destroyed.

<span id="ix.v-p17"></span>Notwithstanding, it seemeth to me that
Josephus is deceived in that where he saith, first, that Cuspius Fadus
was sent by Claudius, and then he addeth, that Theudas was of him
overcome, seeing I have before showed that that former insurrection was
made at such time as Claudius was but a private man. Though he disagree
much with Luke’s narration, even in the number, seeing he saith that
there were about thirty thousand made partners in the sedition, unless
happily we expound it thus, that, after he was put to flight by Felix,
he fled into the wilderness with four thousand. And it had been an
absurd thing that the number should be made ten times greater, as also,
that a troop, having no skill in war, or being altogether without
courage, should have been defamed with the name of murderers. For as
Josephus doth witness, that seducer had deceived the simple and
credulous common people with false promises, boasting that he was a
prophet of God, which would lead the people dry foot through the midst
of Jordan.

<span id="ix.v-p18"></span>But the same Josephus putteth the matter out
of doubt when he saith, that an Egyptian, a prophet, did gather together
a band of men under Felix the president, and did carry them into Mount
Olivet, whereof four hundred were slain, two hundred taken, and the
residue dispersed. The history was fresh in memory. Again, forasmuch as
the author of the sedition was escaped, and the region filled with
murderers,  <span id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) it is not without
cause that the chief captain demandeth of Paul, when he seeth all men so
hate him, whether he were that Egyptian. Luke recordeth no longer
conference had between the chief captain and Paul; yet it is likely,
forasmuch as both of them understood the Greek tongue, that they had
farther talk. Whereby it came to pass, that so soon as Paul had well
purged himself, he had license granted him to speak to the people. For
the chief captain would never have suffered a wicked man to make any
public speech in a city which was so sore suspected.
