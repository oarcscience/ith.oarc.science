<span id="xiii-p1"></span>Chapter 25

<span id="xiii.i"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p1"></span><span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>[Acts
25:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#001.md)<span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Then when Festus was come into the
province, after three days he went up to Jerusalem from the city of
Cesarea. **2.** And the high priests and chief Jews informed him of
Paul, and besought him, **3.** Desiring favor against him, that he would
send for him to Jerusalem, laying await to kill him by the way. **4.**
But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Cesarea, and that he
himself would go thither shortly. **5.** Therefore, let them, saith he,
which are able among you, go down with me, and if there be any fault in
this man, let them accuse him. **6.** And after that he had staid more
than ten days among them, he went down to Cesarea; and on the morrow he
sat down in the judgment-seat, and commanded Paul to be brought. **7.**
Who being come, those Jews which came from Jerusalem stood about him,
laying many and great crimes to Paul’s charge, which they could not
prove. **8.** Forasmuch as he answered, That he had neither offended
anything against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple,
neither against Caesar.

<span id="xiii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xiii.i-p4"></span><span id="xiii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p5"></span>**1.** *Then when Festus.* The second action
is described in this place, wherein Paul hath as hard a combat, and is
in no less danger than in the first. Seeing he was left in bonds, Festus
might suspect that the cause was doubtful, and so gather an unjust
prejudice. But there was another thing which was cause of great danger.
We know that new rulers, because they will win the favor of those who
are in the provinces, use to grant them many things at their first
coming; so that it was to be thought that the death of Paul should be to
Festus a fine means to win favor with all. Therefore, the faith of the
holy man is assailed afresh with a new trial, as if the promise had been
vain whereto he had hitherto trusted; but the grace of God doth so much
the more plainly show itself in delivering him, because, contrary to all
hope, he is delivered out of the jaws of death. The Jews prevent the
governor with their false accusations, yet they do not as yet seek to
have him punished, but they do only desire that he may not be brought
into any foreign court to plead his cause. They desire that ambitiously
as a great benefit, which was to look to equal. How is it then that they
do not obtain, save only because God doth hold the mind of Festus, so
that he doth stoutly deny that which he was afterward ready to grant?
And as the Lord did then hold his mind bound with the secret bridle of
his providence, so when he granted him freedom of will he bound his
hands, that he could not execute that which he would. Let this
confidence support us in dangers, and let it also stir us up to call
upon God; and let this make our minds quiet and calm, in that the Lord,
in stretching forth his hand, and breaking such a strong conspiracy, did
show an eternal example of his power in defending his.

<span id="xiii.i-p6"></span><span id="xiii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p7"></span>**5.** *Those, therefore.* It is in the
Greek word for word, \[literally\] Those who are mighty or able; yet he
meaneth those who can conveniently. Also, we may easily conjecture, that
they did object the trouble and charges, and besought the governor that
he would not make weary with a superfluous journey so many of their
chief men, and also certain which were very aged; but would rather
(which he might easily do) command Paul to be brought by a few keepers
\[guards\]. Therefore, lest they complain that he is burdenous unto
them, he unloadeth them of this necessity, and giveth them leave to
choose out from among themselves such as they will. In the mean season,
he doth sufficiently declare that he doth not believe their false
reports; and he professeth that he will be an upright judge, and will do
nothing but according to the truth of the matter. The next sentence also
is diversely read among the Grecians. For some books \[manuscripts\]
have the same which is in the old interpreter but eight or ten days. If
this reading like us, the sense shall be, that the governor came shortly
after to Cesarea, lest the Jews should be importunate upon him under
color of his long tarriance. The other reading, which is more usual
among the Grecians, shall have another meaning; though he stayed long
enough at Jerusalem to hear the matter, yet did he not hearken to their
requests, who would have Paul brought thither; whence we may gather a
probable conjecture, that he already knew of their laying await.

<span id="xiii.i-p8"></span><span id="xiii.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p9"></span>**7.** *Many and grievous crimes.* So long
as Paul lived under the law, his integrity was well known and famous.
Again, when he was converted to Christ, he was a singular pattern of
innocence. Yet we see how he is subject to many slanders, cruel and
false accusations. And this is almost always the estate of the servants
of Christ, wherefore they must be the more courageous, to pass valiantly
through evil report and good report; neither let them think it strange
to be evil reported of where they have done good.

<span id="xiii.i-p10"></span>In the mean season, they must do their
endeavor, that they may not only have a clear conscience before God, but
that they may be very well able to defend themselves before men, when
they have time and place. For Paul doth not fail in his cause, but
courageously setteth the defense of his innocency against their false
crimes. Furthermore, let us note that the wicked can never be bridled,
but they will speak evil of good men, and will impudently slander them;
for they resemble the nature of Satan, by whose spirit they are led.
Therefore, whereas we be commanded to stop the mouth of the wicked, it
must not be so taken as if he shall be free from all backbiting,  <span
id="fr_597"></span>[598](#fn_597.md) whosoever shall behave himself
uprightly, but that our life may answer for us, and may wipe away all
blots of false infamy. So we see the adversaries of Paul, though they
had a favorable judge, yet their slanders were all in vain, seeing he
did defend and avouch his innocency by his deeds. And yet it is likely
that they wanted not false witnesses, neither were they slack in
suborning them; but because the Lord giveth his servants invincible
strength, so that the brightness of honesty doth drive away their vain
clouds; they are ashamed, and at length they depart from the
judgment-seat with this infamy, that they were false accusers. But the
defense of Paul doth show what things the Jews laid principally to his
charge. The first crime was ungodliness against God, that he overthrew
the law and polluted the temple; the other, rebellion against Caesar and
the Roman empire, because he raised tumults everywhere. He was helped by
the singular grace of God to answer and refute both, who maketh the
innocence of his as bright as the morning.

<span id="xiii.ii"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
25:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#009.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p2"></span>**9.** And Festus, being willing to do the
Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem,
and there be judged of these things before me? **10.** But Paul said, I
stand before Caesar’s judgment-seat, where I must be judged: to the Jews
have I done no wrong, as thou thyself knowest full well. **11.** And if
I do injury, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not
to die; but if there be nothing of these things whereof they accuse me,
no man can deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar. **12.** Then spake
Festus with the council, and said, Hast thou appealed to Caesar? to
Caesar shalt thou go.

<span id="xiii.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xiii.ii-p4"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p5"></span>**9.** *And Festus.* Whether Festus knew
somewhat of their laying await, (which we may well conjecture) or
whether he were altogether ignorant thereof, he dealeth unjustly with
Paul; and we see how soon those are drawn unto all corruption which are
not guided by the Spirit of God. For Festus doth not openly contemn or
hate Paul; but ambition, and peradventure also desire of gain, got the
upper hand, so that, for pleasing the other part, he doth unjustly bring
him in danger of death; also, it is likely that he was enticed with the
smell \[hope\] of some reward to hearken so courteously to the priests.
Notwithstanding, I marvel that he giveth Paul leave to choose, and doth
not rather, according to this authority, command them to carry him
whether he would or no. Surely we gather that he was kept back with
fear, lest he should infringe the privilege of the city of Rome,  <span
id="fr_598"></span>[599](#fn_598.md) which was a very odious crime.
Notwithstanding, he studied craftily to persuade Paul not to refuse to
be judged at Jerusalem. For he was not ignorant of that which indeed
came to pass, that a citizen of Rome might lawfully appeal, so that he
could then go no farther. Nevertheless, it was no thank to him that he
was not delivered into the hands of murderers.  <span
id="fr_599"></span>[600](#fn_599.md)

<span id="xiii.ii-p8"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p9"></span>**10.** *I stand at Caesar’s
judgment-seat.* Because Paul seeth that he is betrayed into the hands of
the Jews through the ambition of the governor, he objecteth the
privilege of the city of Rome. He had submitted himself modestly, if he
had commanded him to do  <span id="fr_600"></span>[601](#fn_600.md) that
which was just and equal. Now, because the governor doth not his duty
willingly, necessity compelleth the holy man to defend himself by law;
and by this means the Lord delivereth him now again, even when he was
almost given over into the hands of the enemies. And whereas he desireth
to have his matter handled before Caesar’s judgment-seat, he doth not,
therefore, make the doctrine of the gospel subject to the judgment of a
profane and wicked man; but being ready to give an account of his faith
everywhere, he appealeth from that court where he could no longer hope
for equity. Furthermore, though the citizens of Rome did retain their
privilege, yet the order was then altered, because the Caesars had taken
into their own hands the judging of the people,  <span
id="fr_601"></span>[602](#fn_601.md) as if they would be good maintainers
and patrons of common liberty.

<span id="xiii.ii-p12"></span>*To the Jews have I done.* Because those
whose consciences do accuse them, and which mistrust their matter, fly
unto certain odd excuses and exceptions, Paul turneth away from himself
this opinion. And surely the ministers of Christ ought to have no less
care to make their innocency known than to save their life. If Paul had
flatly denied to answer for himself, the enemies would have triumphed,
and the doubtfulness of an evil conscience should have been objected to
him to the reproach of the gospel. But now when he citeth the governor
himself to be a witness of his integrity, and doth refuse no punishment
if he should be found guilty, he cutteth off all occasion of slanderous
reports. Therefore, he showeth that he doth not seek to save himself by
turning his back,  <span id="fr_602"></span>[603](#fn_602.md) but flyeth
unto the fortress of a just defense, that he may there save himself from
injury, seeing his adversaries have hitherto handled him unjustly; and
now refusing to deal with him any longer by law, they go about to have
him murdered. Neither doth Paul go behind the president’s back to tell
him that he doth unjustly, in that he doth so dally with his accusers;
and therewithal he doth, as it were, bridle his lust, so that he dare go
no farther.

<span id="xiii.ii-p14"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p15"></span>**11.** *I appeal unto Caesar.* After that
he hath professed that he doth not refuse to die if he be found guilty,
he freely useth such helps as he could find at the hands of men.
Wherefore, if we be at any time brought into like straits, we must not
be superstitious, but we may crave help of the laws and politic order.
Because it is written, that magistrates are made and appointed by God to
the praise of the godly (<span id="xiii.ii-p15.1"></span>[Ro
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#003.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p15.1"></span>;
and <span id="xiii.ii-p15.2"></span>[1Pe
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013)<span id="xiii.ii-p15.2"></span>.md).
Neither was Paul afraid to go to law under an unbelieving judge; for he
which appealeth commenceth a new action.

<span id="xiii.ii-p16"></span>Therefore, let us know that God, who hath
appointed judgment-seats, doth also grant liberty to his to use the same
lawfully. Therefore, those mistake Paul who think that he doth flatly
condemn the Corinthians, (<span id="xiii.ii-p16.1"></span>[1Co
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#001)<span id="xiii.ii-p16.1"></span>.md)
because they require help of the magistrate for defense of their right,
seeing he reproveth in that place a manifest fault, to wit, because they
could suffer no wrong, and because they were too much set upon suing one
another, whereby they caused the gospel to be evil spoken of.

<span id="xiii.ii-p17"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p18"></span>**12.** *Festus having talked with the
council* The governors did use to have certain of the chief citizens
which did attend upon them, and sat with them in judgment, that they
might decree nothing without the consent of the council. Furthermore, it
doth seem that Festus pronounced this with indignation, when he said
interrogatively, Hast thou appealed to Caesar? to wit, because it
grieved him that he could not do the Jews such a pleasure as he desired;
though I leave that indifferent, because it is neither of any great
importance, and it leaneth only to a conjecture.

<span id="xiii.iii"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Acts
25:13-21](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#013.md)<span
id="xiii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p2"></span>**13.** And after certain days, king
Agrippa and Bernice came to Cesarea to salute Festus. **14.** And when
they had stayed there many days, Festus rehearsed Paul’s cause to the
king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds of Felix: **15.**
About whom, when I came to Jerusalem, the high priests and elders of the
Jews informed me, requiring judgment against him. **16.** To whom I
answered, It is not the custom of the Romans for favor to deliver any
man that he should perish, before he that is accused have his accusers
face to face, and have license to answer for himself, concerning the
crime laid against him. **17.** Therefore, when they were come hither
without delay, on the morrow I sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded
the man to be brought. **18.** Against whom when the accusers stood up,
they brought none accusation concerning such things as I supposed:
**19.** But they had certain questions concerning their superstition (or
religion) against him, and concerning one Jesus which was dead, whom
Paul affirmed to be alive. **20.** And because I doubted of this
question, I asked him if he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged
of these things. **21.** And when Paul had appealed, that he might be
kept unto the knowledge of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept until I
might send him to Caesar.

<span id="xiii.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xiii.iii-p4"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p5"></span>**13.** *And after certain days.* This
long narration tendeth to this end, that we may know that though the
handling of the cause were broken off, yet were Paul’s bands famous; and
that he was nevertheless brought out of prison, that he might make
profession of his faith, and dispute touching the gospel before a famous
auditory; and again, that though he were contemned, yet was he not
counted a wicked person, lest the glory of Christ should be abased by
his slander and reproach, yea, that he had more liberty to preach the
gospel being in prison, than if he had lived free in a private house.

<span id="xiii.iii-p6"></span>*King Agrippa and Bernice.* It is certain
that this Agrippa was son to Agrippa the elder, whose filthy and
detestable death was set down in the twelfth chapter. When this man was
made king of Chalcis, in his uncle’s stead, after the decease of his
father, he did afterward obtain a more large dominion.  <span
id="fr_603"></span>[604](#fn_603.md) Bernice, of whom mention is made in
this place, was his own natural sister, which was first married to
Herod; king of Chalcis, her uncle, and did keep herself widow a certain
season after his death, yet she did not live honestly and chastely
during that time; for her great familiarity with her brother Agrippa was
suspected. And to the end she might not be counted an incestuous person,
she married with Polemon, king of Cilicia. Notwithstanding, because she
gave herself more to lust than to chastity, she forsook him. The
historiographers do nowhere say that she was her brother’s wife; and
Josephus, in his Life, assigned her a dominion of her own in part of
Galilee. Therefore, it is to be thought that forasmuch as they were
hardened in their wickedness, they dwelt together, not regarding what
men did say; yet did they abstain from marriage, lest their incestuous
marriage should betray and also augment their crime. Neither is it any
marvel that he came for honor’s sake to salute the governor, who did
reign only at the will and pleasure of another, and did depend upon the
beck and favor of the Emperor of Rome, which he was to retain and
nourish by means of the governor.

<span id="xiii.iii-p8"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p9"></span>**14.** *When many days.* Therefore, when
(after some time was spent) they wanted matter of talk, as idle men use
to invent somewhat whereon they may talk, mention was made of Paul; for
Luke meant to note that, when he said that after many days were idly
spent, Festus told the king of a certain man which lay bound. And
although he doth here both touch the malice of the priests, and also
make a show of wonderful equity on his part, yet in that he shortly
after cleareth the party which was accused, he condemneth himself
unawares, when as he confesseth that he was enforced to appeal that he
might not be carried to Jerusalem.

<span id="xiii.iii-p10"></span>But when Festus commendeth the Romans, he
showeth what doth beseem judges. And if nature did tell profane men thus
much, that they must admit no such favor as may oppress the guiltless,
how much more must judges (who have the light of the word of God) be
careful to avoid all corruption.

<span id="xiii.iii-p11"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p12"></span>**18.** *They laid no such crime to his
charge.* I marvel why Festus doth say, that there was no such crime
objected to Paul as he supposed, seeing he was accused of sedition; but
we may again conjecture by this, yea, plainly know, that their
accusations were so vain, that they ought not to have been brought
before the judgment-seat; as if a man did utter a slanderous speech
unadvisedly. For which cause he saith, that the state of the cause did
consist in questions of the law. Therefore, we see that he putteth a
difference between those offenses which were wont to be punished by
man’s laws, and the controversy which was between Paul and the Jews; not
that the religion ought to be corrupted freely,  <span
id="fr_604"></span>[605](#fn_604.md) or that their malapertness is
tolerable, who overthrow the worship of God with their own inventions;
but because the man being a Roman, cared not for Moses’ law; therefore
he speaketh so disdainfully when he saith, that they did strive about
their superstition; though this word <span
id="xiii.iii-p13.2"></span>δεισιδαιμονια be taken of the Grecians, as
well in good as evil part; to wit, because the worshipping of false gods
was common in all places. Notwithstanding, his meaning is, that he
careth not what manner of religion the Jews have. And no marvel if a man
which was an ethnic, \[heathen\] and had not learned that the rule of
godliness must be fet \[sought\] from the mouth of God, know not how to
distinguish between the pure worship of God and superstitions.

<span id="xiii.iii-p14"></span>Wherefore, we must hold fast that mark
whereby we may discern the one from the other, that there is no
godliness but that which is grounded in the knowledge of faith, lest we
grabble \[grope\] in darkness. Moreover, the Romans were so drunken with
prosperous success, that they thought that they were more acceptable to
God than any other; as at this day the Turks, by reason of their
manifold victories, deride the doctrine of Christ. This was a lamentable
case, that a man being an unbeliever and idolater, sitteth as judge
amidst the Jews, to give judgment of the sacred oracles of God according
to his ignorance, but all the fault was in Paul’s adversaries, who did
not care for the majesty of God, so they might satisfy and obey their
own madness. Notwithstanding, there rested nothing for Paul to do, but
to clear himself of those crimes which were laid against him. So at this
day, though inward brawls, which are among Christians, do defame the
name of Christ and his gospel among the Turks and Jews, yet the
defenders of holy doctrine are unworthily blamed, which are enforced to
enter the combat.

<span id="xiii.iii-p15"></span>*Of one Jesus.* It is not to be doubted
but that Paul intreated, both gravely and with such vehemency as became
him, of the resurrection of Christ; but Festus, by reason of his pride,
thought it no meet matter for him to occupy his head about. He doth not,
indeed, openly deride Paul, but he showeth plainly how negligently he
heard him when he disputed of Christ. Whereby we see how little
preaching availeth, yea, that it availeth nothing at all, unless the
Spirit of God do inwardly touch the hearts of men. For the wicked do
lightly pass over whatsoever is spoken, as if a man should tell them a
tale of Robin Hood.  <span id="fr_605"></span>[606](#fn_605.md) Wherefore,
there is no cause why the carelessness of many should trouble us at this
day, seeing Paul prevailed nothing with Festus. But this place doth
witness that many speeches did pass in the handling of the matter,
whereof Luke maketh no mention. For he had spoken nothing as yet of
Christ, and yet this latter narration doth show that Paul intreated
seriously before the Jews of his death and resurrection. Which could not
be, but he must needs intreat of the principal points of the gospel.
Therefore, I guess that Paul did so handle the matter, that when he had
refuted the false accusations of the Jews, wherewith they went about to
burden him before the governor, having gotten a fit occasion, he began
afterward to speak freely of Christ.

<span id="xiii.iv"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p1"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Acts
25:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/act025.htm#022.md)<span
id="xiii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p2"></span>**22.** And Agrippa said unto Festus, I
would also myself hear the man. Tomorrow, saith he, thou shalt hear him.
**23.** And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with
great pomp, and was entered into the common hall with the chief
captains, and the principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul
was brought. **24.** And Festus saith, King Agrippa, and all men which
are present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of
the Jews hath called upon me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he
ought not to live any longer. **25.** Yet have I found that he hath
committed nothing worthy of death, and because he hath appealed unto
Augustus, I have determined to send him. **26.** Of whom I have no
certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth
unto you, and chiefly unto thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination
had, I may have somewhat to write. **27.** For it seemeth to me an
unmeet thing to send a prisoner, and not to show the crimes whereof he
is accused.

<span id="xiii.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="xiii.iv-p4"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p5"></span>**22.** *I would also.* By this we may
gather that Agrippa did so desire to hear Paul, that he was ashamed to
make his desire known, lest Festus should think that he came for some
other end than to salute him. And it may be that not only curiosity did
move him to be desirous to hear Paul, but because he did hope to profit
by hearing him. Notwithstanding, we may easily gather by this how cold
his desire was, because he suffered many days to pass before he showeth
any sign of his desire, because he was more in love with earthly
commodities, which he counted better. Neither durst he make any words;
neither did he pass for uttering any speech until such time as Festus
did of his own accord will him so to do. So that the holy minister of
Christ is brought forth as on a stage, that a profane man may cheer up
his guest, save only that Festus will be holpen with the advice of
Agrippa and his company, that he may let Caesar understand how diligent
he is. But the matter was turned to another end by the secret providence
of God. Neither need we doubt but that such report went abroad as made
much for the confirmation of the godly; and it may be also that some of
the hearers were touched, and did conceive seed of faith, which did
afterward bring forth fruit in due time. But admit none of them did
embrace Christ sincerely and from his heart, this was no small profit,
that the unskillful were appeased after that the malice of the enemies
was discovered, that they might not be inflamed with such hatred against
the gospel. Impiety was made ashamed, and the faithful did gather new
strength, so that they were confirmed more and more in the gospel.

<span id="xiii.iv-p6"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p7"></span>**23.** *And on the morrow.* Agrippa and
his sister do not come like humble disciples of Christ, but they bring
with them such pomp and gorgeousness as may stop their ears and blind
their eyes; and it is to be thought that like haughtiness of mind was
joined with that gorgeous and great pomp. No marvel, therefore, if they
were not brought to obey Christ. Notwithstanding, it seemeth that Luke
maketh mention of the pomp, that we might know that, in a great
assembly, and before choice witnesses, whose authority was great, Paul
had leave granted not only to plead his matter as a party defendant, but
also to preach the gospel. For he cometh forth as in the person of a
teacher, that he may set forth the name of Christ. So that the truth of
God brake out of his bands, which was forthwith spread abroad everywhere
with a free course; yea, it came even unto us. By this word <span
id="xiii.iv-p7.1"></span>φαντασια, Luke understandeth that which we call
commonly preparation or pomp.  <span id="fr_606"></span>[607](#fn_606.md)
But there must other furniture be brought unto the spiritual marriage of
Jesus Christ.

<span id="xiii.iv-p9"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p10"></span>**26.** *That after examination had.* We
cannot tell whether the governor, in acquitting Paul before them, doth
seek by this policy to entice him to let his appeal fall. For it was a
thing credible that he might easily be persuaded to lay away fear, and
to submit himself to the judgment and discretion of a just judge,
especially if Agrippa should give his friendly consent. To what end
soever he did it, he condemneth himself of iniquity by his own mouth, in
that he did not let a guiltless man go free whom he is now ashamed to
send unto Caesar, having nothing to lay against him. This did also come
to pass by the wonderful providence of God, that the Jews themselves
should give a former judgment on Paul’s side. Peradventure, the governor
goeth subtilely to work, that he may pick out what the king and the
chief men of Cesarea do think, that if it so fall out that Paul be set
at liberty, he may lay the blame on their necks. For he would not have
the priests to be his enemies for nothing, upon whom a good part of
Jerusalem did depend, and that was the best way that he could take in
writing to Caesar to intermingle the authority of Agrippa. But the Lord
(to whom it belongeth to govern events contrary to man’s expectation)
had respect unto another thing, to wit, that when the clouds of false
