<span id="xi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 19

<span id="xi.i"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p1"></span><span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
19:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#001.md)<span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p2"></span>**1**. Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a
potter’s earthen bottle, and *take* of the ancients of the people, and
of the ancients of the priests;

<span id="xi.i-p3"></span>**1**. Sic dicit Jehova, Vade et acquire
(*alii vertunt*, posside; *et* <span id="xi.i-p3.1"></span>קנה
*significat utrunque, sed hic non convenit verbum possidendi*; acquire
tibi) lagenam figuli testaceam, et quidem cum senioribus populi, et cum
senioribus sacerdotum:

<span id="xi.i-p4"></span>**2**. And go forth unto the valley of the son
of Hinnom, which *is* by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there
the words that I shall tell thee:

<span id="xi.i-p5"></span>**2**. Et egredere ad vallem filii Hinnom,
quae est in introitu portae orientalis, (*alii vertunt*, fictilis,) et
clama illic (*hoc est*, alta voce pronuntia) sermones quos loquutus
fuero ad te;

<span id="xi.i-p6"></span>**3**. And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD,
O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of
hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the
which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.

<span id="xi.i-p7"></span>**3**. Et dices, Audite sermonem Jehovae,
reges Jehudah et incolae Jerusalem, Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus
Israel, Ecce adduco malum super locum hunc, de quo quisque audierit,
tinnient aures ejus.

<span id="xi.i-p8"></span> 

<span id="xi.i-p9"></span><span id="xi.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p10"></span>We see that the Prophet was sent by God to
shew the people that there was no firmness in that state of which
hypocrites boasted; for God, who had favored the people of Israel with
singular benefits, did no less retain them in his own possession than
the potter. The Prophet had before shewn to the Jews that the potter
formed his vessels as he pleased, and also, that when he had taken the
clay and the vessel did not please him, he formed another. This prophecy
has a similar import, yet it is different, as we shall presently see.
The Prophet is here bidden to buy an earthen vessel of the potter, and
at the meeting of the people to break it, that all might understand that
they were like earthen vessels, and that being thus admonished of their
fragility, they might no longer be proud, as though they possessed a
firm and perpetual state of happiness.

<span id="xi.i-p11"></span>The main object of the two visions is,
however, the same: for the Jews thought that they were not subject to
the common lot of men, because they had been chosen as a peculiar
people; nor would they have gloried in vain with regard to that
inestimable privilege, had there been a mutual agreement between God and
them; but as they were covenant-breakers, their glorying was vain and
foolish, in thinking that God was bound to them. For what right had they
to claim this privilege? God indeed had adopted the whole race of
Abraham, but there was a condition introduced,

<span id="xi.i-p12"></span>“Walk before me and be perfect.” (<span
id="xi.i-p12.1"></span>[Ge 17:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#002.md)<span
id="xi.i-p12.1"></span>)

<span id="xi.i-p13"></span>When they all had become apostates, the
covenant, as to them, was abolished. Then God could not have been
called, as it were, to an account, as though he had violated his
covenant with them, for he owed them nothing. They had become aliens;
for through their wickedness and perfidy they had departed from him. God
then designed to show how vain and how false was their confidence, when
they said, “We are a holy race, we are God’s heritage;” because they had
wholly departed from the covenant which God had made with their fathers.

<span id="xi.i-p14"></span>But in the form adopted, as I have said,
there is some difference. The Prophet had before introduced the potter
to shew that there was no less power in God than in a mortal man,
because we are before him as the clay, so that he can form and destroy
his vessels as he pleases: but here the Prophet shews, that though the
Jews had been formed for a time, and so formed as to have been like an
excellent and a beautiful vessel, yet it was not a perpetual condition.
And it is probable that when they had heard that God could, like the
potter, form and re-form them, they had devised an evasion, according to
what men usually do who deal sophistically with God, — “O, be it so, the
potter can from the same clay form both a precious and a worthless
vessel; but we are the precious vessel, and God has given us that form;
for when he made a covenant with Abraham, he adorned him with this
singular distinction: he afterwards brought our fathers out of Egypt,
and then there was a better form added; and since at length he raised a
kingdom among us with this promise, that the throne of David would be
perpetual, it cannot possibly be otherwise than that we are to continue
in our state.” Hence the Prophet expresses here more than in the former
prophecy, that not only God had the power of a potter in forming his
vessels, but that when the vessel is already formed and possesses great
splendor, it can again be broken: he stated this lest the Jews should
object by saying, that the state in which they were under David and his
posterity would be perpetual. He says, “This is nothing: for the earthen
vessel, though splendid and elegant in its form, can yet be broken in
the third or fourth year no less than at the time when it is formed, and
can be broken for ever,” according to what is afterwards implied by the
similitude.

<span id="xi.i-p15"></span>We shall proceed now to the words: he says,
*Go and get for thee an earthen vessel*. The Rabbins think the name
given to the vessel to be factitious, as the grammarians say, that is,
made from its sound; for it appears to have been a flagon or a bottle;
and as the bottle has a narrow mouth, it makes this sound, <span
id="xi.i-p15.1"></span>בקבק *bakbuk*, when we drink from it; and hence
they think the name is derived. There is, however, no ambiguity as to
the thing itself, that the word means a bottle, not only made of earth,
but also either of glass or of wood. By adding the word <span
id="xi.i-p15.2"></span>חרש *cheresh*, he specifies what but <span
id="xi.i-p15.3"></span>בקבק, *bekbek*, is a general word. He then adds
what is literally, *From the elders*, and interpreters think that the
words “bring with thee” are to be understood; and as to the sense I
agree with them, for we shall hereafter see, that in the presence of
those who went with him he broke the vessel: it then follows that the
elders here spoken of were taken by Jeremiah as his companions; but as
<span id="xi.i-p15.4"></span>מ *mem*, sometimes means “with,” as in the
fifty-seventh chapter of Isaiah, (<span id="xi.i-p15.5"></span>[Isa
57:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#008)<span id="xi.i-p15.5"></span>.md)

<span id="xi.i-p16"></span>“and made thee a covenant with them, <span
id="xi.i-p16.1"></span>מהם”

<span id="xi.i-p17"></span>I take it to be of the same meaning here; and
this is doubtless suitable here, for he was to go *with the elders of
the people and with the elders of the priests*  <span
id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md)

<span id="xi.i-p21"></span><span id="xi.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p22"></span>And he adds, *Enter into the valley of the
son of Hinnom, which is at the entrance of the east gate*, rendered by
some “of the earthen gate,” for which I see no reason; but I leave this
to be examined by those who are more versed in the language. It is
indeed thought that <span id="xi.i-p22.1"></span>ש, *shin*, is changed
here into <span id="xi.i-p22.2"></span>ס, *samech*; but if we take the
word as it is, it means “solar,” for <span id="xi.i-p22.3"></span>חרס
*cheras*, from which <span id="xi.i-p22.4"></span>חרסית *cherasit*, is
derived, signifies the sun; and it seems to have been called the solar
gate by way of excellency, because it looked toward the rising sun.
 <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) I do not yet oppose the idea of
those who think that the Prophet alludes to <span
id="xi.i-p24.2"></span>חרש, *cheresh*, of which he had spoken, and that
he calls it the east gate, though it was as it were an earthen gate; for
the two letters <span id="xi.i-p24.3"></span>ש, *shin*, and <span
id="xi.i-p24.4"></span>ס *samech*, as it is well known, are closely
allied. *Cry there*, he says, *the words which I shall speak to thee.*

<span id="xi.i-p25"></span>I come now to the subject: God bids his
Prophet to get from the potter an earthen vessel, and to do so in the
presence of the elders; for it was necessary to have witnesses in a
matter so important; and as the public safety of the people was
concerned, it was God’s purpose, lest the prophecy should be despised,
that there should be present the gravest witnesses, suitable, and, as
they say, authorized, or approved; and he calls them the *elders* of the
*people* and of the *priests*; and no doubt they were chosen from a
great number, even from among the priests who were chief. There were
also Levites of the sons of Aaron; but there were then chief priests a
large number; but, as they say, it was a turbulent rabble. They were
chosen from those first orders who ruled the Church, and Jeremiah calls
them the *elders* of the priests. There were also others chosen from the
people who presided over the Church. And we know that there were two
public functionaries, or, as they say, a twofold government: the priests
were the rulers of the Church with regard to the law, so that their
government was spiritual; there were also the elders of the people who
managed civil affairs; but there were some things in which they ruled in
common. We now then see what the Prophet meant by saying that he was
bidden to call witnesses to see what is afterwards stated, and that they
were taken partly from the priests and partly from the people.

<span id="xi.i-p26"></span>He says; *Enter into the valley of the son of
Hinnom*. This valley was in the suburbs, and was called <span
id="xi.i-p26.1"></span>תפת *Tophet*, as we shall hereafter see. It is
thought that this name is derived from drums, because they did beat
drums when infants were killed, lest their cry should excite any feeling
of humanity. But, we shall again say something on the etymology of this
word. In this valley they were accustomed to sacrifice and offer their
children by casting them into the fire. Many indeed performed this in a
different way, by purifying their children and carrying them round the
fire, so that they felt only the flame and escaped unhurt. But there
were those who wished to shew their zeal above others, whose ambition
drove them farther, and they killed their children and then burnt them.
But of this matter I have spoken elsewhere, and I shall now only briefly
notice it. This opinion is not, what is commonly received; but it seems
to me that it may be gathered from many parts of Scripture, that many
killed their children, and that some only purified them. However this
may have been, God justly abominated the sacrifice; for his will was
that sacrifices should be offered only in one place. When any one
offered a calf or a lamb in any other place than at Jerusalem, it was a
spurious sacrifice; and the Jews ought to have followed what God had
prescribed, and not to have done anything presumptuously, for obedience
is ever better than any sacrifices.

<span id="xi.i-p27"></span>But here there was a double crime; they left
the Temple and sought to obtrude on God sacrifices against his expressed
will; and then there was another crime still more atrocious, for they
devoted their children to Baalim or to Baal, and not to the only true
God. (I pass by now their slaughter and burning.) This then was the
reason why the Prophet was commanded to go to this place. How detestable
that service was to God appears dear from this, that the prophets give
the name of hell to the valley of Hinnom, <span
id="xi.i-p27.1"></span>גיא הנם *gia-enom.* And we know that at the time
of Christ it was the common name for hell; and whenever Christ speaks of
Gehenna, he uses the word according to its common acceptation at that
time. The word has indeed been corrupted by the Greeks, for it is
properly <span id="xi.i-p27.2"></span>גיא הנם *gia-enom*. But what does
the word mean in the gospel? Hell itself; and whence was its origin? We
indeed know how great and how incurable was the madness of those who
gave themselves up to their own superstitions; for though the prophets
strongly condemned the place, yet the people proceeded in their usual
idolatry; it was therefore necessary to give the place a disgraceful
name in order to render it more abominable.

<span id="xi.i-p28"></span>It is now added, that the place was *by the
entrance of the east gate*. As it was especially a celebrated gate, and
as the sun, rising there, reminded them to behold the light which God
had kindled for them in his law, it was a monstrous stupidity proudly to
tread, as it were, under foot. the law of God in so renowned a place,
and to profane his worship, as though they openly wished to shew that
they esteemed as nothing what God had commanded. If any still think that
there is an allusion to the word <span id="xi.i-p28.1"></span>חרש
*cheresh*, before used, I offer no opposition; that is, though this gate
was indeed oriental, it was yet as it were an earthen gate.

<span id="xi.i-p29"></span>He says, *Cry there,* or, proclaim with a
clear voice, *the words which I shall speak to thee*. The Prophet no
doubt said this expressly, in order to add more weight to his prophecy.
He indeed did nothing but by God’s command; but as his authority was not
acknowledged by the Jews, he here testifies for their sakes that he
would say nothing but what God himself would command. This preface then
confirmed the authority of his prophecy, so that the Jews might not
reject what he might say, as though it came from Jeremiah himself.

<span id="xi.i-p30"></span>But a general doctrine may be hence gathered,
— that ministers are to bring forward nothing but what they have learnt
from God himself. For though Jeremiah was a great man and endued with
excellent gifts, yet he was not to bring one word or a syllable as from
himself: how great then must be the presumption of those who seek to be
superior to him by bringing their inventions, and at the same time
demand to be deemed oracles? This passage confirms the doctrine of
Peter, who says,

<span id="xi.i-p31"></span>“He who speaks, let him speak the words of
God.”  
(<span id="xi.i-p31.2"></span>[1Pe
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#011)<span id="xi.i-p31.2"></span>.md)

<span id="xi.i-p32"></span><span id="xi.i-p32.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p33"></span>He now adds, *Hear ye the word of Jehovah*.
This is a confirmation of the former sentence. We hence see why it was
said, *Cry*, or, with a clear voice proclaim, what I shall say to thee;
it was, that they might know that he spake not according to his own
ideas as a man, but that he was a celestial herald to proclaim what God
commanded. *Hear*, he says, *ye kings of Judah and inhabitants of
Jerusalem.* We see how the Prophet did not spare even kings, according
to what God had before commanded him, that he should act boldly and shew
no respect of persons, (<span id="xi.i-p33.1"></span>[Jer
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#008)<span id="xi.i-p33.1"></span>..md) He
then faithfully performed his office, as he did not flatter kings, and
was not terrified by their dignity and power. But he addressed them
first, and then the people, because they who had most grievously sinned,
were made rightly to bear the first reproof. We hence see what the next
passage means,

<span id="xi.i-p34"></span>“Reprove mountains and chide hills,” (<span
id="xi.i-p34.1"></span>[Mic 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001.md)<span
id="xi.i-p34.1"></span>)

<span id="xi.i-p35"></span>and also this passage,

<span id="xi.i-p36"></span>“I have set thee over nations and
kingdoms,”  
(<span id="xi.i-p36.2"></span>[Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010)<span id="xi.i-p36.2"></span>.md)

<span id="xi.i-p37"></span>for heavenly truth ought to bring under
subjection, as Paul says, everything high in the world, so that all the
pride of man may be subdued. (<span id="xi.i-p37.1"></span>[2Co
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005)<span id="xi.i-p37.1"></span>..md)
Kings indeed do very ill bear to be thus boldly treated; for they wish
to be exempt from every law and to be free from every yoke. But if they
now acknowledge not their subjection to God’s word, they must at last
come before his tribunal; and then they shall find how perversely they
have abused their power. As to teachers, they ought, small and great, to
teach after the example of Jeremiah; they ought to reprove and to
rebuke, when necessary, without shewing any respect of persons.

<span id="xi.i-p38"></span>*Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, and the God of
Israel, Behold, I am bringing an evil on this place, of which whosoever
shall hear, tingle shall his ears*. The prophetic word had more power
when the Jews were brought to the very place where the event was
exhibited, he might have said the same thing in the Temple or in the
gate or in the palace of the king but his prophecy would not have been
so effectual. We indeed know how much tardiness there is in men in
general; but so great was then the obstinacy of the Jews, that however
forcibly the truth might have been set forth, yet it was received with
so much indifference, that it was neglected. God then intended to shew
to them, as it were, the event itself. He says, *Jehovah of hosts and
the God of Israel*; and he used these words, that they might know, as we
have stated elsewhere, that they had to do with God, whose power is
dreaded even by angels. And in order to shake off their foolish
boasting, that they were the children of Abraham, — “God,” he says, “has
sufficient power to chastise you, and the same is the God of Israel,
whose name ye falsely and absurdly pretend to profess.” These subjects I
only in a brief manner handle, because I have explained them more fully
elsewhere.

<span id="xi.i-p39"></span>He says that such a calamity was nigh that
place as would make *the ears to tingle:* when there is a violent noise,
our ears are stunned, and there is at the same time a certain tingling
or ringing. When a man is killed, or when ten or twelve men are slain,
there is a dreadful cry; but in a great tumult occasioned by men
perishing, such is the noise that it stuns in a manner the ears, like
that which proceeds from cataracts; for the violent noise of the Nile,
they say, causes some degree of deafness. So also the Prophet says here,
*I am bringing*, says God, *a calamity on this place*, which shall not
only terrify those who will hear of it, but also render them quite
astonished, so that their ears shall tingle, as is the case when there
is a violent and dreadful noise. The cause follows —

<span id="xi.ii"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
19:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#004.md)<span id="xi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p2"></span>**4**. Because they have forsaken me, and
have estranged this place, and have burnt incense in it unto other gods,
whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah,
and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;

<span id="xi.ii-p3"></span>**4**. Propterea quod reliquerunt me et
alienarunt locum hunc, et suffitum fecerunt in eo diis extraneis, quos
non noverunt ipsi neque patres ipsorum, neque reges Jehudah; et
implerunt locum hunc sanguine innocentium;

<span id="xi.ii-p4"></span>**5**. They have built also the high places
of Baal, to burn their sons with fire *for* burnt offerings unto Baal,
which I commanded not, nor spake *it*, neither came *it* into my mind:

<span id="xi.ii-p5"></span>**5**. Et extruxerunt excelsa (aedificarunt
excelsa) ipsi Baal, ad comburendum filios suos igne in holocaustum ipsi
Baal; quod non mandavi et non loquutus sum, et non ascendit super cor
meum (vel, in cot meum.).

<span id="xi.ii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xi.ii-p7"></span><span id="xi.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p8"></span>The reason is given why God would so severely
deal with that place. We indeed know that hypocrites are ever ready with
their answer; as soon as God threatens them, they bark and bring forward
their evasions. The Prophet then shews that the judgment announced would
be just, lest the Jews should pretend that it was extreme.

<span id="xi.ii-p9"></span>God first complains that he had been forsaken
by them, because they had changed the worship which had been prescribed
in his Law. And this is what ought to be carefully considered; for no
one would have willingly confessed what Jeremiah charged upon them all;
they would have said, — “We have not forsaken God, for we are the
children of Abraham; but what we wish to do is to add to his worship;
and why should it be deemed a reproach to us, if we are not content with
our own simple form of worship, and add various other forms? and we
worship God not only in the Temple, but also in this place; and further,
we do not spare our own children.” But God shews by one expression that
these were frivolous evasions; for he is not acknowledged except what he
orders and commands is obediently received. Let us know, that God is
forsaken as soon as men turn aside from his pure word, and that all are
apostates who turn here and there, and do not follow what God approves.

<span id="xi.ii-p10"></span>Then he says that they had *alienated the
place*. God had consecrated to himself the whole of Judea: he would not
indeed have sacrifices offered to him in every place; but when the Jews
worshipped him, as they were taught by Moses and the prophets, the whole
land was as it were an altar and a temple to him. Then God complains
that his authority in that part of the suburbs was taken away; as though
he had said, — “The whole of Judea is my right and my jurisdiction, and
Jerusalem is the royal palace in which I dwell; but ye, deluded beings,
do by force take away my right and transfer it to another, as though one
gave to a robber a place nigh a royal residence.” Thus God justly
complains that they had *alienated* that *place*  <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md)

<span id="xi.ii-p12"></span>But we must remember the reason, which
immediately follows, because they had burned incense to Baal. They
pretended, no doubt, the name of God; but yet it was a most preposterous
superstition, when they worshipped inferior gods, as the Papists do at
this day. The word Baal is sometimes used in the singular number by the
prophets, and sometimes in the plural: but what is Baal? a patron. They
were not content with one patron, but every one desired a patron for
himself: hence under the words Baal and Baalim, the prophets
characterized all fictition is modes of worship: when they worshipped
God’s name, they blended the worship of patrons, who had not been made
known to them; hence he adds, *They have made incense in it to foreign
gods*. He afterwards says, that these foreign gods were such as neither
they nor their fathers nor their kings knew. By saying that they were
gods unknown to their fathers as well as to themselves and to their
kings, he no doubt calls their attention to the doctrine of the law, and
to the many certain proofs by which they had found that he was the only
true God.

<span id="xi.ii-p13"></span>The Jews might have raised such an objection
as the Papists do at this day, — that their modes of worship were not
devised in their time, but that they had derived them from their
ancestors. But God regarded as nothing those kings and the fathers, who
had long before degenerated from true and genuine religion. It must be
here observed, that true knowledge is connected with verity: for they
who had first contrived new forms of worship, doubtless followed their
own foolish imaginations; as when any one in the present day asks the
Papists, why they weary themselves so much with their superstitions,
good intention is ever their shield, — “O, we think that this is
pleasing to God.” Therefore rightly does God here repudiate their
inventions as wholly vain, for they possess nothing solid or permanent.
At the same time, he by implication condemns the Jews for rejecting his
law, whose authority had been established among them, so that they ought
not to have entertained any doubt: for it would have been the greatest
ingratitude to say, “We know not who introduced the Law!” God had indeed
sanctioned the law by so many miracles, that it could not have been
disputed; and they had also found by many evidences and proofs that he
was the only brue God. tie had then been known by their fathers as well
as by their kings, even by David and by all his godly successors. Hence
their crime was exaggerated, by seeking for themselves foreign gods.

<span id="xi.ii-p14"></span>Now we also see how foolishly the Papists
lay hold on this passage and similar passages, in order to commend their
abominations by the pretext of antiquity, for vain are their disguises
when they say, “O, we have been thus taught by our ancestors, and we
have the authority of kings.” But the Prophet here does not speak of
fathers indiscriminately; but by fathers he means those who had embraced
the true and pure worship of God, as they had been taught by the law;
and those kings were alone worthy of imitation, who had faithfully
worshipped God according to the doctrine of the law: and thus he
excludes all those fathers and kings who had degenerated from the law of
Moses.

<span id="xi.ii-p15"></span><span id="xi.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p16"></span>He at last adds, that that place was *filled
with the blood of innocents*; for there they killed their children. And
by this circumstance Jeremiah again amplifies the wickedness of the
people; for they had not only despised God and his law, but also cruelly
destroyed their innocent infants; and thus he proved them guilty not
only of impiety and profaneness in vitiating the worship of God, but
also of brutal and barbarous savageness in not sparing innocent blood.

<span id="xi.iii"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xi.iii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast
been pleased to shew to us the way in which we cannot err, provided we
obey thee, — O grant, that we may render ourselves really teachable and
ready to obey, and never undertake anything but what we know is approved
by thee, nor turn aside on the right hand or on the left; but continue
in that form of worship which thou hast prescribed to us in thy word, so
that we may be able to bear witness, not only before the world, but
before thee and the holy angels, that we obediently follow thee; and may
we never blend anything of our own, but with submissive minds worship
thee alone, and strive to render ourselves wholly subject to thee, until
having at length rendered to thee due service through the whole course
of our life, we shall reach that blessed rest which thy Son has procured
for us by his own blood. — Amen.

the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley
of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter.

<span id="xi.v-p3"></span>**6**. Propterea ecce dies veniunt, dicit
Jehova, et non (*hoc est*, quibus non) vocabitur locus hic
ampliusThopheth et vallis filii Hinnon, sed vallis interfectionis.

<span id="xi.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.v-p5"></span><span id="xi.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.v-p6"></span>We saw in the last Lecture that the Prophet
was sent by God’s bidding to the house of the potter, that he might
there take an earthen bottle, carry it to Topher, and there explain the
judgment of God, which was nigh at hand on account of his worship being
violated. And he shewed why the Jews deserved reproof, even because they
made incense to Baal, built groves and high places for themselves, and
committed their sons and daughters to the fire: they were not only
profane towards God, but also cruel towards innocent souls. Now, lest
they pretended an excuse, he also added, that such a thing never came to
God’s mind; and this is worthy of notice, because God by this one
expression fulminates against all those inventions with which men
delight themselves. As then there is no command, it follows that
whatever is thus attempted is frivolous and useless.

<span id="xi.v-p7"></span>He now denounces punishment, *The days are
coming*, or shall come, *in which this place shall no more be called
Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of
slaughter*. This seemed incredible to the Jews; for they had chosen that
place for themselves to perform their superstitions: they thought
therefore that a great part of their safety depended on their false
worship.

<span id="xi.v-p8"></span>As to the word Tophet, some think that it is
to be taken simply for hell, or for eternal death; but this cannot by
any means be admitted. More probable is their opinion who derive it from
<span id="xi.v-p8.1"></span>תף, *teph*, which means a drum; for they
think that they did beat drums when infants were killed, that their
cries might not be heard. But as this is only a conjecture, I know not
whether another reason may be given. Some derive the word from <span
id="xi.v-p8.2"></span>יפה *iphe*, which signifies to be decorous or
beautiful; and this etymology has something apparently in its favor. And
perhaps it ought to be so taken in <span id="xi.v-p8.3"></span>[Job
17:6](../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#006.md)<span id="xi.v-p8.3"></span>,
where the holy man complains that he was become a proverb, and that he
had been <span id="xi.v-p8.4"></span>תפת *Tophet*, in the presence of
all. There are indeed some who explain the word there as signifying
something monstrous, and thus take it in a bad sense. But it seems
rather to have been put in contrast with the former clause, — he had
been a pleasant spectacle, but he was now become detestable. But they
who take the word there as meaning hell, do so entirely without any
reason, for that Job perished, seeing and knowing his perdition, as they
say, is a forced view. I doubt not then but that he said, that he had
been <span id="xi.v-p8.5"></span>תפת *Tophet*; that is, an object of joy
and of praise, but that he was then a sad and mournful spectacle. And it
is certain that his name, <span id="xi.v-p8.6"></span>תפת, *Tophet*, was
given to the valley of Hinnom, because of the hilarity and joy which
thence arose to the people; for they thought that God was propitious to
them, when they so sedulously offered there their sacrifices, and yet
they provoked his wrath. Then Tophet is to be taken in a good sense,
when we regard the origin of the word. It is indeed true that in <span
id="xi.v-p8.7"></span>[Isa 30:33](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#033.md)<span
id="xi.v-p8.7"></span>, Tophet is to be taken for Gehenna; but it may be
that the prophets had now begun so to execrate the place as to call hell
indiscriminately Gehennon and Tophet; for the word Gehenna, as we have
stated elsewhere, had its origin from the same place; it is indeed
corrupted, but its origin is not doubtful. Now, the reason why the
prophets and other faithful men called the place hell, was plainly this,
— because the devil reigned in that place, when God’s worship became
vitiated, and the whole of true religion was subverted; and especially,
because superstition became so deeply fixed in the hearts of the people,
that it could not be rooted up except by an extraordinary force and
power.

<span id="xi.v-p9"></span>However this may have been, we may conclude
from this passage, as well as from other passages, that this name was
given on account of the joy experienced there, even because they thought
themselves altogether happy, as God was pacified towards them. But what
does Jeremiah say? This place shall be no more called *Tophet, nor The
valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter*. This seemed,
as I have said, incredible to the Jews. But it however behoved the
Prophet boldly to declare what was to be. It afterwards follows, —

<span id="xi.vi"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p1"></span><span id="xi.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#007.md)<span id="xi.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p2"></span>**7**. And I will make void the counsel of
Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the
sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their
lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the
heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

<span id="xi.vi-p3"></span>**7**. Et exinaniam consilium Jehudah et
Jerusalem in loco hoc, et prosternam eos in gladio coram inimicis
ipsorum, et in manu quaerentium animam eorum, et ponam (dabo) cadaver
eorum in cibum volucri coeli (hoc est, avibus coeli, est enallage) et
bestiae (hoc est, bestiis) terrae.

<span id="xi.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.vi-p5"></span><span id="xi.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p6"></span>This amplification further exasperated the
minds of the people, — that they in vain trusted that this place would
be to them a fortress. For, as we have already stated, they had
persuaded themselves that it was abundantly sufficient to reconcile them
with God, when they spared not their own children, and so zealously
performed tlheir acts of worship. And hypocrites are commonly inflated
with this presumption, for they prefer what pleases them to what pleases
God; they regard not what the law bids, what God approves, but they
adore their own inventions. Since then almost all the superstitious are
filled with such a presumption, God here rightly declares, that he would
*make void their counsels*  <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md)

<span id="xi.vi-p8"></span>It is indeed certain that there is neither
wisdom nor counsel in deluded men, while they thus devise new and
frivolous modes of worship, for these are sheer mummeries. But we ought
to observe what Paul says in <span id="xi.vi-p8.1"></span>[Col
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#023.md)<span id="xi.vi-p8.1"></span>,
that all the fictions which men devise for themselves have in them some
appearance of wisdom; for we know that wherever our imagination may
carry us, we think ourselves wise, and that whatever God prescribes
becomes insipid to us. Then the Prophet concedes “counsel,” though
improperly, to frivolous and vain inventions, but not without reason,
for experience teaches us sufficiently, that men ever take great delight
in their superstitions, for they wish to subject God as it were to their
own will. He then says, by way of concession, that the *counsels* of the
whole people, especially of the city Jerusalem, would be made *void*,
which was above others the teacher of errors, while yet the doctrine of
the law ought especially to have prevailed there. And it may be also
that there is an allusion to that word <span id="xi.vi-p8.2"></span>בקבק
*bekbek*, which we have before seen, and which the Prophet will repeat
again, for it means to make void or empty, though some think it to be a
factitious word, because the sound, bekbek, is produced while the bottle
is emptied. However this may be, the allusion is still sufficiently
striking.

<span id="xi.vi-p9"></span>He afterwards adds, *And I will lay them
prostrate by the sword before their enemies, and by the hand of those
who seek their life*. In this second part, the Prophet intimates that
the hatred entertained by their enemies towards the Jews would not be
common. Wars are carried on sometimes in such a way, that the conquerors
are satisfied with the spoils; but the Prophet intimates, that the
cruelty of their enemies would be such, that they would seek the life of
the whole people, and delight in slaughter; as though he had said, that
they would be deadly enemies and altogether implacable. He will again
repeat these words, and in the same sense.

<span id="xi.vi-p10"></span>He then adds, *I will give your carcase to
be meat to the birds of heaven, and to the beasts of the field*  <span
id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) We have said elsewhere that it is
deemed a punishment inflicted by heaven when the carcases of the dead
remain unburied; for it is the last office of humanity to bury the dead.
And this is a distinction which God would have to be between men and
brute animals, for animals have not the honor of a burial. It has also
been ever granted as a singular privilege to men to be buried, in order
to set forth the hope of resurrection. When, therefore, a burial is
denied, it is a proof of extreme dishonor. It has indeed often happened
that the saints have been without a burial; but temporal punishment is
ever turned to salvation to God’s children. As to the reprobate it must
be deemed a judgment from God, when he casts away their carcases, as
then there is no difference between them and animals. But I have treated
this subject more fully elsewhere, and I shall not proceed with it now.
It follows —

<span id="xi.vii"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p1"></span><span id="xi.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#008.md)<span id="xi.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p2"></span>**8**. And I will make this city desolate,
and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and
hiss because of all the plagues thereof.

<span id="xi.vii-p3"></span>**8**. Et ponam urbem hanc in stuporem et
sibilum; quisquis transibit per eam stupebit et sibilabit super omnen
plugam ejus.

<span id="xi.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.vii-p5"></span><span id="xi.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p6"></span>Jeremiah proceeds with his denunciation, and
it was necessary for him to add this amplification, that he might
penetrate into their hard and perverse hearts; for had he employed only
a single sentence, or a common mode of speaking, in describing their
calamity and the ruin of the city, they would not have been at all
moved. Hence he enlarges on the subject, and advances with greater
vehemence, and always speaks in the person of God, that his denunciation
might have greater weight.

<span id="xi.vii-p7"></span>*I will set*, etc. Here is to be noticed a
second reason; for it was not enough that a calamity should be denounced
on the Jews, without adding this, that it was inflicted by God’s hand,
and that thus the punishment of their wickedness was just. Then he says,
I will *set this city for an astonishment*; for so in this place the
word <span id="xi.vii-p7.1"></span>שמה *sheme* ought to be rendered,
inasmuch as the reason afterwards follows, *astonished shall be
whosoever shall pass through it*  <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) He adds also, *for a hissing*, which
is rather a mark of detestation than of scorn; yet the desolation of the
whole land, and also the ruin of the holy city in which God had chosen
an habitation for himself, might have filled all with terror, and ought
justly to have done so. *Whosoever*, he says, *shall pass through shall
be astonished, and shall hiss on account of all her stroke*;  <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) for it was not to be a common
calamity, but one in which might be seen God’s dreadful judgment. It
follows —

<span id="xi.viii"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p1"></span><span id="xi.viii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#009.md)<span id="xi.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p2"></span>**9**. And I will cause them to eat the
flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat
every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith
their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.

<span id="xi.viii-p3"></span>**9**. Et pascam eos carne filiorum suorum
et carne filiarum suarum, et vir carnem proximi sui comedent (*hoc est*,
singuli comedent carnem proximi sui) in afflictione et angustia, qua
angent (*vel*, constringent) eos hostes ipsorum, et qui quaerent animam
ipsorum.

<span id="xi.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.viii-p5"></span><span id="xi.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p6"></span>Here the Prophet goes farther — that so
atrocious would be the calamity, that even fathers and mothers would not
abstain from their children, but would devour their flesh. This was
indeed monstrous. It has sometimes happened that husbands, in a state of
extreme despondency, have killed their wives and children, (anxious to
exempt them from the lust of enemies,) or have kindled a fire in the
midst of the forum, to cast their children and wives on the pile, and
afterwards to die themselves; but it was more barbarous and brutal for a
father to eat the flesh of his son. The Prophet then describes an
unusual vengeance of God, which could not be classed among the
calamities which usually happen to mankind.

<span id="xi.viii-p7"></span>We know that this was also done in the last
siege of that city; for Josephus shews at large that mothers in a brutal
manner slew their children, and that they so lay in wait for one another
that they snatched at anything to eat. This was also an evidence of
God’s dreadful vengeance.

<span id="xi.viii-p8"></span>But it was no wonder that God visited in
such an awful manner the sins of those who had in such various ways, and
for so long a time, provoked him; for if we compare the Jews with other
nations, we shall find that their impiety, and ingratitude, and
perverseness, exceeded the crimes of all nations. Then justly did God
inflict such a punishment, which even at this day cannot be referred to
without horror. The whole indeed is to be ascribed to his judgment; for
it was he who fed  <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) the fathers
with the flesh of their children; for as they had sacrificed their sons
and their daughters to demons, as before stated, so it was necessary
that the vengeance of God should be openly pointed out as by the finger.
This was done when God imprinted marks on the bodies of children, which
even the blind could not but perceive.

<span id="xi.viii-p10"></span>He adds, *In the tribulation*,  <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) *and straightness with which their
enemies shall straiten them*. We have said that those who had been long
besieged, and were not able to resist, have been often reduced to the
necessity to freeing their wives, or their children, or themselves, from
dishonor; but to protract life in the manner here mentioned was
altogether brutal. It follows —

<span id="xi.ix"></span>

<span id="xi.ix-p1"></span><span id="xi.ix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
19:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#010.md)<span id="xi.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ix-p2"></span>**10**. Then shalt thou break the bottle in
the sight of the men that go with thee.

<span id="xi.ix-p3"></span>**10**. Et conteras lagenam in oculis virorum
qui proficiscentur (*vel*, qui profecti fuerint) tecum.

<span id="xi.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.ix-p5"></span><span id="xi.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ix-p6"></span>Jeremiah summoned witnesses, that the
confirmation of the prophecy might be more fully attested to the people.
With regard to the history of this transaction we may add, that he was
first sent to the house of the potter, from whence he procured the
bottle; he then went to Tophet, and there spoke against their impious
and corrupt superstitions; and at last, to seal the prophecy, he broke
the bottle in the presence of the witnesses whom he had brought with
him. And we have said that it was necessary thus to deal with a people,
not only ignorant and stupid, but, which is worse, perverse and
obstinate. There was not only importance in the sign, that they might
thence learn the doom of the city and of the whole land, but it was also
a solemn sealing of the prophecy; and on this account he was commanded
to break the vessel, even that he might show, by a visible act, the near
approach of God’s vengeance, of which the Jews had no apprehension. It
follows —

<span id="xi.x"></span>

<span id="xi.x-p1"></span><span id="xi.x-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011.md)<span id="xi.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.x-p2"></span>**11**. And shalt say unto them, Thus saith
the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as
*one* breaketh a potter’s vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and
they shall bury *them* in Tophet, till *there be* no place to bury.

<span id="xi.x-p3"></span>**11**. Et dices ad eos, Sic dicit Jehova
exercituum, Ita confringam populum hunc et urbem hanc, sicut quis
confringit vas figuli, (*hoc est*, vas testaceum; *vel*, vas fragile,
figulinum,) quod non poterit reparari amplius: et in Thopheth
sepelientur; quia non erit locus ad sepeliendum (*ad verbum*, a non loco
ad sepeliendum.)

<span id="xi.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.x-p5"></span><span id="xi.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.x-p6"></span>The Prophet again confirms what he had shewn
by the external symbol, and he does this by a new coremtrod from God. We
know that signs are wholly useless when the word of God does not shine
forth, as we see that superstitious men always practice many ceremonies,
but they are only histrionic acts. But God never commanded his prophets
to shew any sign without adding doctrine to it. This is what we see was
done on this occasion; for Jeremiah spoke against impious superstitions,
and as a celestial herald denounced punishment; he then sealed the
prophecy by breaking the bottle, and a repetition of the doctrine
follows again, *Thus shalt thou say to them.* This is not said of the
Prophet’s companions, the pronoun is without an antecedent, but the
whole reople are the persons referred to.

<span id="xi.x-p7"></span>*Thus saith Jehovah, I will so break this
people and this city.* He mentions the city, in which they thought they
had an impregnable fortress, because the temple of God was there. But as
they had profaned the temple and polluted the city with their crimes,
Jeremiah reminded them that no confidence or hope was to be placed in
the city. Then he says, *As one breaks a vessel which cannot be
repaired,* etc. Here again he shows that they were wholly to perish, so
as no more to rise again. We indeed know that sometimes those who are
most grievously afflicted retain some remnants of strength, and are at
length restored to their former vigor; but the Prophet shews that the
approaching calamity would be wholly irremediable. It is no objection to
say, that God a. fterwards restored the people, and that the city and
the temple were rebuilt, for all this was nothing to the ungodly men of
that age, as their memory wholly perished. A curse and God’s vengeance
remained on the heads of those who thus continued obstinate in their
wickedness; and hence those who returned from exile are said in <span
id="xi.x-p7.1"></span>[Ps 102:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019.md)<span
id="xi.x-p7.1"></span>, to have been a people created again, as though
they rose up as new men,

<span id="xi.x-p8"></span>“A people, who shall be created, shall praise
the Lord.”

<span id="xi.x-p9"></span>He then says, *Buried shall they be, in
Tophet, for there will be no place elsewhere*  <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) They had chosen that place at a time
when they thought that they had some evidence of God’s favor, and a
cause for joy; but he declares that that place would be filled with dead
bodies, for they would flee in great numbers into the city, which
afterwards would become so full of dead bodies that no room for burial
could be found except in Topher. It follows —

<span id="xi.xi"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p1"></span><span id="xi.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#012.md)<span id="xi.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p2"></span>**12**. Thus will I do unto this place, saith
the LORD, and to the inhabitants thereof, and *even* make this city as
Tophet:

<span id="xi.xi-p3"></span>**12**. Sic faciam loco huic, dicit Jehova,
et incolis ejus; et ad ponendum (et ponam) urbem hanc sicut Thopheth.

<span id="xi.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.xi-p5"></span><span id="xi.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p6"></span>As he had said before that the valley would
be the place of slaughter, that thence it might take its name, so now he
declares the same as to the city; “As then Tophet shall be the valley of
slaughter, so shall Jerusalem be.”  <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) They were no doubt kindled into rage
(as we shall see in the next chapter) on hearing this prophecy; but yet
God purposed, however irreclaimable and refractory they were, to let
them know what was approaching, and though they did not believe the
words of the Prophet, God touched and even deeply wounded their
consciences, so that before the event came they were miserable. For the
same purpose he adds —

<span id="xi.xii"></span>

<span id="xi.xii-p1"></span><span id="xi.xii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#013.md)<span id="xi.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xii-p2"></span>**13**. And the houses of Jerusalem, and the
houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet,
because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto
all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other
gods.

<span id="xi.xii-p3"></span>**13**. Et erunt domus Hierusalem et domus
regum Jehudah, sicut locus Thopheth immundae; ad omnes domos in quibus
suffitum fecerunt super tecta eorum universae militiae coelorum, et
libarunt libamen diis alienis.

<span id="xi.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xi.xii-p5"></span><span id="xi.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xii-p6"></span>He describes, as I have said, more at large
what he had briefly expressed, for he had spoken of the city; but as the
belief of that was difficult, he now enumerates particulars, as though
he had said, that Jerusalem was a wide city and splendidly built, for
there were there many large and elegant houses, and the royal palaces,
yet he says, that all these things would not prevent God to demolish the
whole city. And this deserves particular notice, for we know that Satan
dazzles our eyes whenever he suggests anything that gives a hope of
defense, but what God threatens we think is vain, and as it were
fabulous, or at least produces no effect on us. Since then so gross an
hypocrisy prevailed in the hearts of the people, the Prophet rightly
tried to shake off from them whatever might deceive them.

<span id="xi.xii-p7"></span>Hence he says, *The houses of Jerusalem*,
etc. — these were many and splendid — *and the houses of the kings of
Judah*, their palaces either within or without the city *shall be as the
place of Tophet*; that is, no house shall be exempt from slaughter, and
no palace shall protect its inhabitants. They shall be *unclean*, he
says, that is, on account of dead bodies, for men slain would be found
everywhere; and this is, as it is well known, often mentioned in
Scripture as a pollution or defilement. With regard to all the houses;
some read, “On account of all the houses,” and <span
id="xi.xii-p7.1"></span>ל *lamed*, is often a causal preposition. But it
seems rather to be taken here as explanation; and hence I render the
words, *With regard to all the houses,* so that the Prophet speaks of
all the houses in, which they made incense.  <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) As then there was no house free from
sacrilege, he says that God’s vengeance would penetrate into all houses
without any exception.

<span id="xi.xii-p10"></span>He says also, *On the roofs*, with the view
of condemning them for their effrontery; for they raised their baseness
as a standard, that it might be seen at a distance. They indeed thought
that God was delighted with such a service; but how came they to
entertain such a foolish persuasion, except through their neglect and
contempt of the law, and also through a mad presumption in giving more
credit to their own fictions than to certain truth. The Prophet then
justly condemns them, for they had cast off all shame, and went up to
the roofs of their houses, that their doings might be more open. Then he
mentions the *whole host of heaven*; and says further, that they had
*poured a libation to foreign gods*. We see that many kinds of
superstitions prevailed among the people; for he spoke of Baal in the
singular number, he mentioned also Baalim, patrons, and he now adds, the
whole host of heaven; that is, the sun, the moon, and all the stars.

<span id="xi.xii-p11"></span>We hence see that the Jews kept no limits
as to their sacrileges, which is usually the case with all the ungodly;
for as soon as men begin to turn aside from the pure and genuine worship
of God, they sink into the lowest depths. It is then this wantonness
that the Prophet now refers to, when he intimates that their various
forms of worship were so increased, that they had devised as many gods
as there are stars in heaven; which is similar to what is said
elsewhere,

<span id="xi.xii-p12"></span>“According to the number of thy cities, O
Judah, are thy gods,”  
(<span id="xi.xii-p12.2"></span>[Jer
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#028.md)<span id="xi.xii-p12.2"></span>;
<span id="xi.xii-p12.3"></span>[Jer
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer011.htm#013)<span id="xi.xii-p12.3"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.xiii"></span>

19:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#014.md)<span
id="xi.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xiii-p2"></span>**14**. Then came Jeremiah from Tophet,
whether the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of
the LORD’S house; and said to all the people,

<span id="xi.xiii-p3"></span>**14**. Et venit (reversus est) Jeremias e
Thopheth, quo miserat eum Jehova ad prophetandum; et stetit in atrio
domus Jehovae, et dixit ad totum populum,

<span id="xi.xiii-p4"></span>**15**. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the
God of Israel, Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her
towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have
hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words.

<span id="xi.xiii-p5"></span>**15**. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus
Israel, Ecce ego adduco super urbem hanc et super omnes urbes ejus omne

<span id="xi.xiii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xi.xiii-p7"></span><span id="xi.xiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xiii-p8"></span>Jeremiah had been led to the very place,
when he foretold the punishment, which was nigh at hand, on account of
the superstitions of Tophet or of the valley of Hinnom. That his
doctrine might be more efficacious, God intended that he should preach
before the very altar and in the very valley, then well known for
ungodly and false modes of worship. He says now that he went to the
Temple and delivered there the same message. We hence learn how great
must have been the stupidity and indifference of the people, for the
repetition of the prophecy was not unnecessary. For as God knew that the
Jews were extremely tardy and slow, he caused them to be warned twice by
his servant, and in two different places.

<span id="xi.xiii-p9"></span>*Jeremiah*, it is said, *returned from
Tophet, where God had sent him to prophesy*; which last words were
added, that we may not suppose that he without reason preached in the
valley of Hinnom. God then commanded Jeremiah to denounce there, as it
were in the very place, on the Jews their own destruction. *And he
stood*, it is added, *in the court of Jehovah’s house*. As it was not
lawful for the people to enter into the Temple, they usually assembled
in the court, which was a part of the Temple. Then Jeremiah *stood*
there; for he had to speak, not to a few, or in a corner, but to the
whole people, and to make them witnesses of his prophecy. But we read
here nothing new; for, as it has been stated, he was bidden to declare
twice the same thing — the approaching calamity; and he was so bidden,
because the Jews were so hardened, that they could not easily be moved.
That he connects other cities with Jerusalem is not to be wondered at;
he thereby intimates, that the whole land was guilty before God, and
that therefore desolation was near at hand, as to all the towns and
cities; as though he had said, “God will not spare Jerusalem, though it
has been hitherto his sanctuary; but as lesser cities are not innocent,
they shall also feel the hand of God together with Jerusalem.”

<span id="xi.xiii-p10"></span><span id="xi.xiii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xiii-p11"></span>The reason is subjoined, *Because they
have hardened their neck*. He again confirms what we have before
observed, — that they had fallen, not through ignorance, but through
perverseness; for they had learned with sufficient clearness from the
law what was right, and they had also been often warned by the prophets.
Hence then their wickedness appeared and their untameable spirit, for
they had heard the sound doctrine of the law, and had many to warn them.

<span id="xi.xiii-p12"></span>Now this passage teaches us that there is
no pardon left for us, when we, as it were, avowedly reject the yoke of
God. And this ought to be carefully noticed, for we see how difficult it
is to subdue men, even when they confess that the word of God is what
they hear. Since then there is in all mankind an innate perverseness,
that hardly one in a hundred allows himself to be ruled by God’s word,
it behoves us seriously to consider what is here said, — that they are
unworthy of mercy who harden their neck. Hence it is said in <span
id="xi.xiii-p12.1"></span>[Ps
95:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008.md)<span id="xi.xiii-p12.1"></span>,

<span id="xi.xiii-p13"></span>“Harden not your hearts like your
fathers.”

<span id="xi.xiii-p14"></span>And a clearer definition follows, *That
they might not hear my words*. Though there be hardness in all mortals,
yet when the doctrine of salvation is made known and not received, then
a greater impiety and pride shew themselves; for in that case, men hear
God speaking, and yet rob him of his authority. It then follows, that
the more clearly God makes known his truth, the less ground of excuse
there is; for then especially comes to light the impiety of men, and
their disdain seems incapable of being subdued.

<span id="xi.xiv"></span>

<span id="xi.xiv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xi.xiv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast
been pleased to prescribe a rule for us, by which we may truly and
purely worship thee, — O grant, that we may follow this plain rule, and
never indulge our own imaginations, nor trifle with thee through our own
fancies or through the foolish wisdom of our flesh, but continue in thy
law, and in the doctrine which thine only-begotten Son, our Lord, has
delivered to us, so that we may advance more and more in the knowledge
of that glory, the foretaste of which thou givest us now, until we shall
at length fully and perfectly enjoy it, when we shall be gathered into
that celestial kingdom, which thy Son has procured for us by his own
blood. — Amen.

id="xi.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p18"></span> The literal rendering of this verse I
conceive to be the following, —

<span id="xi.i-p19"></span>“Thus saith Jehovah, go and get; bottle from
the maker of earthenware, and *some* of the elders of the people and of
the elders of the priests.”

<span id="xi.i-p20"></span>The <span id="xi.i-p20.1"></span>מ, *of*, or
*from*, before elders, implies a part; and it is the idiom of the
language not to put in “some,” — “get (or take) from the elders,” etc.
He was first to get the bottle, and then some of the elders. The
*Vulgate* very strangely represents the Prophet as taking the bottle
from the elders, omitting the <span id="xi.i-p20.2"></span>ו, and as
taking it from both elders! — *Ed*

<span id="fn_211"></span>[212](cc18010.htm#fr_211.md) <span
id="xi.i-p22.5"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p23"></span> It appears that the valley of Hinnom was not
to the east, but to the south of Jerusalem. See <span
id="xi.i-p23.1"></span>[Jos 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#008.md)<span
id="xi.i-p23.1"></span>. The *Keri* and several copies read <span
id="xi.i-p23.2"></span>החרסית and it is given untranslated by the
*Septuagint* the *Syriac*, and the *Arabic*. It is rendered “earthen” by
the *Vulgate*, as though the <span id="xi.i-p23.3"></span>ס, as *Calvin*
mentions, is substituted for <span id="xi.i-p23.4"></span>ש. In this
case it might be rendered “the potsherd” — “at the entrance of the gate,
The potsherd.” It was the gate, before which did lie all the broken
vessels, and the dirt and filth from the Temple. For this reason it may
be that the *Targum* renders it here, “the gate of the dunghill.”

<span id="xi.i-p24"></span>*Parkhurst*, however, takes the word as it is
in the text, and gives this version, “the gate of the burnings,” so
called because of the practice of burning children in the valley
opposite the gate. See <span id="xi.i-p24.1"></span>[Jer
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031.md)<span id="xi.i-p24.1"></span>. All
these names would properly designate the south gate. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[213](cc18010.htm#fr_212.md) <span
id="xi.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p11"></span> Perhaps the idea would be better expressed,
if we were to say, “They had alienized the place,” or heathenized it,
made it a heathen place. To alienate is to transfer a right or property
from one to another. This was indeed true, for they separated as it were
the place from God and transferred it to heathen deities. But the idea
here seems to be, that they made the place heathenish: “and have
heathenized this place.” “Alienated” is the *Septuagint*; “made it
alien,” the *Vulgate*; “polluted,” the *Syriac*; and “defiled,” the
*Targum.* — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[214](cc18010.htm#fr_213.md) <span
id="xi.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p7"></span> The plain meaning is, I will frustrate all
your plots and projects, whereby you think to escape and to secure
yourselves, and make them as vain and empty as this earthen bottle is. —
*Gataker.*

<span id="fn_214"></span>[215](cc18010.htm#fr_214.md) <span
id="xi.vi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vi-p11"></span> The words are in the singular number — “The
bird of heaven and the beast of the field.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[216](cc18010.htm#fr_215.md) <span
id="xi.vii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p8"></span>*Blayney* gives the same meaning, —

<span id="xi.vii-p9"></span>“And I will make this city an object of
astonishment and of hissing.”

<span id="xi.vii-p10"></span>The *Vulgate* and the *Syriac* are the
same; but the *Septuagint* and the *Targum* have “desolation” instead of
“astonishment.” The word <span id="xi.vii-p10.1"></span>שמה signifies
both, as in Hebrew the same word often expresses the cause and the
effect: desolation is the cause, astonishment is the effect. The primary
meaning is what is given mostly by the *Septuagint* and very seldom the
secondary. The literal rendering of the sentence is, —

<span id="xi.vii-p11"></span>“And I will set this city for an
astonishment  
and for a hissing.”

<span id="xi.vii-p12"></span> — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[217](cc18010.htm#fr_216.md) <span
id="xi.vii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xi.vii-p13"></span> *Plagam*; the original word is considered
to be in the plural number, and means strokes, stripes, scourges, but
not plagues in the usual sense of the word — pestilences: it may be
rendered smitings, or more properly, inflictions. It occurs three times
in <span id="xi.vii-p13.1"></span>[De
28:59](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#059.md)<span id="xi.vii-p13.1"></span>,
and is rendered plagues, but it ought to be smitings or inflictions; and
so here, “on account of all her inflictions.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_217"></span>[218](cc18010.htm#fr_217.md) <span
id="xi.viii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p9"></span> The expression, according to the Hebrew,
is, “I will cause them to eat.” What a punishment! Those who sacrificed
their children to their idols were judicially brought to such straits as
to be driven to eat their own children! God often punishes men in a way
that corresponds with their sin. Through superstitious madness the Jews
willingly offered their children in sacrifice to demons; and through the
extreme cravings of hunger they were constrained to eat their own
children! — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[219](cc18010.htm#fr_218.md) <span
id="xi.viii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xi.viii-p11"></span> The word is <span
id="xi.viii-p11.1"></span>מצור, which means a siege, as well as
tribulation or distress; and the former is the most suitable word here;
and so it is rendered by the *Targum* and the early versions, except the
*Syriac*. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_219"></span>[220](cc18010.htm#fr_219.md) <span
id="xi.x-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xi.x-p10"></span> This is evidently the meaning, and not that
given in our version. See note in vol. 1, p. 415. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[221](cc18010.htm#fr_220.md) <span
id="xi.xi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xi.xi-p7"></span> The ellipsis in the last clause is what
often occurs in Hebrew; it may be supplied in our language by *that*, —

<span id="xi.xi-p8"></span>“Thus will I do to this place, saith Jehovah,
and to its inhabitants, and *that* to make this city like Tophet.”

<span id="xi.xi-p9"></span>The full sentence is, “and thus will I do to
make,” etc. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[222](cc18010.htm#fr_221.md) <span
id="xi.xii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="xi.xii-p8"></span> On account of all the houses,” is the
*Septuagint* and the *Targum*; “all the houses,” is the *Vulgate* and
the *Syriac*, being put in apposition with “the houses of Jerusalem,”
etc.

<span id="xi.xii-p9"></span>The words which follow are literally, —
“which they have burned incense on their roofs,” which we properly
render in our language, “on whose roofs they have burned incense;” but
the Welsh is literally the Hebrew, <span id="xi.xii-p9.1"></span>Y rhai
yr arogldarthasant ar eu pennau, — “which they incensed on their roofs;”
but “incensed” in this sense is not used. — *Ed*.
