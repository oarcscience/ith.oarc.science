<span id="viii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 16

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1**. The word of the LORD came also unto
me, saying,

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span>**1**. Et fuit sermo Jehovae ad me, dicendo,

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span>**2**. Thou shalt not take thee a wife,
neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span>**2**. Non accipies tibi uxorem, et non
erunt tibi filii et filiae in hoc loco;

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span>**3**. For thus saith the LORD concerning
the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and
concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers
that begat them in this land;

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span>**3**. Quia sic dicit Jehova super filios et
super filias, qui nascentur in loco hoc, et super matres, quae
pepererint illos, et super patres, qui genuerint illos in terra hac;

<span id="viii.i-p8"></span>**4**. They shall die of grievous deaths;
they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; *but* they
shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed
by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the
fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.

<span id="viii.i-p9"></span>**4**. Mortibus aegritudinum *(vel,*
agrotationum) morientur, non plangentur, et non sepelientur; in stercus
*(id est,* pro stercore) super faciem terrae erunt, et in gladio et fame
consumentur *(id est,* per gladium et famem,) et erit cadaver eorum in
cibum volucri coelorum et bestiae terrae

<span id="viii.i-p10"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span><span id="viii.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p12"></span>This is a new discourse, which yet is not
unlike many others, except in this particular, that the Prophet was *not
to marry a wife nor beget children in the land* But as to the general
subject, he repeats now what he had often said before and confirmed in
many places. But the prohibition to marry was full of meaning; it was to
shew that the people were wholly given up to destruction. The law of
man’s creation, we know, was this,

<span id="viii.i-p13"></span>“Increase and multiply.” (<span
id="viii.i-p13.1"></span>[Ge 1:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#022.md)<span
id="viii.i-p13.1"></span>; <span id="viii.i-p13.2"></span>[Ge
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen008.htm#017.md)<span id="viii.i-p13.2"></span>;
<span id="viii.i-p13.3"></span>[Gen.
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#001.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#007)<span id="viii.i-p13.3"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.i-p14"></span>As then mankind are perpetuated by
marriage, here on the contrary God shews that that land was unworthy of
this common and even general blessing enjoyed by the whole race of man.
It is the same as if he had said, “They indeed as yet live, but a quick
destruction awaits them, for I will deprive them of the universal favor
which I have hitherto shewed to all mankind.”

<span id="viii.i-p15"></span>Marriage is the preservation of the human
race: *Take not to thee a wife and beget no children* We hence see that
in the person of Jeremiah God intended to shew the Jews that they
deserved to be exterminated from the earth. This is the import of this
prophecy.

<span id="viii.i-p16"></span>It may however be asked, whether the
Prophet was unmarried? But this has nothing to do with the subject, for
he received this command in a vision; and though he might not have been
unmarried, he might still have proclaimed this prophecy, that God had
forbidden him to marry and to beget children. At the same time, I think
it were probable that the Prophet. was not married, for as he walked
naked, and as he carried on his neck a yoke, so also his celibacy might
have been intended to be, as it were, a living representation, in order
to produce an effect on the Jews. But, as I have already said, we need
not contend about this matter. Every one then is at liberty to judge as
he pleases, only I suggest what I deem most probable.

<span id="viii.i-p17"></span><span id="viii.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p18"></span>But the reason why God forbad his Prophet
to marry, follows, because they were all consigned to destruction. We
hence learn that celibacy is not here commended, as some foolish men
have imagined from what is here said; but it is the same as though God
had said, “There is no reason for any one to set his mind on begetting
an offspring, or to think that this would be to his advantage: whosoever
is wise will abstain from raarriage, as he has death before his eyes,
and is as it were near to his grave.” The destruction then of the whole
people, and the desolation and solitude of the whole land, are the
things which God in these words sets forth.

<span id="viii.i-p19"></span>At the same time, they are not threatened
with a common kind of death, for he says that they *were to die by the
deaths of sicknesses* He then denounces on them continual languor, which
would cause them to pine away with the greatest pain: sudden death would
have been more tolerable; and hence David says, while complaining of the
prosperity of the ungodly, that there

<span id="viii.i-p20"></span>“were no bands in their death.” (<span
id="viii.i-p20.1"></span>[Ps 73:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#004.md)<span
id="viii.i-p20.1"></span>)

<span id="viii.i-p21"></span>And the same thing is found in the book of
Job, that

<span id="viii.i-p22"></span>“in a moment of time they descend to the
grave,”

<span id="viii.i-p23"></span>that is, that they flourish and prosper
during life, and then die without any pain. (<span
id="viii.i-p23.1"></span>[Job
21:13](../../../bib/kjv/job021.htm#013)<span id="viii.i-p23.1"></span>.md)
Hence Julius Caesar, shortly before he was killed, called this kind a
happy death, (<span id="viii.i-p23.2"></span>εὐθανασίαν,) for he thought
it a happy thing to expire suddenly. And this is what is implanted in
men by nature. Therefore Jeremiah, in order to amplify God’s vengeance,
says that they would *die by the deaths of sicknesses;*  <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) that is, that they would be worn out
by daily pains, and pine away until they died.

<span id="viii.i-p25"></span>He adds, *They shall not be lamented nor
buried* We have seen elsewhere, and we shall hereafter see, (<span
id="viii.i-p25.1"></span>[Jer 22](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#000.md)<span
id="viii.i-p25.1"></span>) that it is a proof of a curse when the dead
are not buried, and when no one laments their death: for it is the
common duty of humanity for relations and friends who survive, to mourn
for the dead and to bury them. But the Prophet seems to mean also
something further. I do not indeed exclude this, that God would deprive
them of the honor of sepukure and of mourning; but he seems also to
intimate, that the destruction of men would be so great that there would
be none to perform these offices of humanity. For we lament the dead
when leisure is allowed us; but when many are slain in war they are not
individually lamented, and then their carcases he confused, and one
grave is not sufficient for such a number. The Prophet there means, that
so great would be the slaughter in Judea, that none would be buried,
that none would be lamented. The verb which he uses means properly to
lament, which is more than to weep: and we have said elsewhere, that in
those countries there were more ceremonies than with us; for all the
orientals were much given to various gesticulations; and hence they were
not satisfied with tears, but they added lamentation, as though they
were in despair.

<span id="viii.i-p26"></span>But the Prophet speaks according to the
customs of the age, without approving of this excess of grief. As they
were wont not simply to bewail the dead, but also to shew their grief by
lamentation, he says, “Their offices shall now cease, for there will not
be graves enough for so many thousands: and then if any one wish to
mourn, where would he begin?” We also know that men’s hearts become
hardened, when many thus die through pestilence or war. The import of
the whole is, that God’s wrath would not be moderate, for he would in a
manner empty the land by driving them all away, so that there would be
none remaining. God did indeed preserve the elect, though as it were by
a miracle; and he afterwards preserved them in exile as in a grave, when
they were removed from their own country.

<span id="viii.i-p27"></span>He then adds, That they *would be as dung
on the face of the land* He speaks reproachfully of their carcasses, as
though he had said, “They shall be the putridity of the land.” As then
they had by their faith contaminated the land during life, God declares
that after death they would become foetid like dung. Hence we learn, as
I have before said, that it was an evidence of God’s curse, when
carcases were left unburied; for as God has created us in his own image,
so in death he would have some evidence of the dignity and excellency
with which he has favored us beyond brute animals, still to remain. We
however know that temporal punishments happen even to the faithful, but
they are turned to their good, for the Psalmist complains that the
bodies of the godly were cast forth and became food to the birds of
heaven. (<span id="viii.i-p27.1"></span>[Ps
79:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#002)<span id="viii.i-p27.1"></span>.md)
Though this is true, yet these two things are by no means inconsistent,
that it is a sign of God’s wrath when the dead are not buried, and that
a temporal punishment does no harm to God’s elect; for all evils, as it
is well known, turn out to them for good.

<span id="viii.i-p28"></span>It is added, *By the sword and by famine
shall they be consumed;* that is, some shall perish by the sword, and
some by famine, according to what, we have before seen,

<span id="viii.i-p29"></span>“Those for the sword, to the sword;  
those for the famine, to the famine.” (<span
id="viii.i-p29.2"></span>[Jer
15:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#002)<span id="viii.i-p29.2"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.i-p30"></span>Then he mentions what we have already
referred to, *Their carcases shall be for food to the beasts of the
earth and to the birds of heaven*  <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) He here intimates, that it would be a
manifest sign of his vengeance, when the Jews pined away in their
miseries, when the sword consumed some of them, and famine destroyed
others, and not only so, but when another curse after death followed
them, for the Lord would inflict judgment on their carcases by not
allowing them to be buried. How this is to be understood I have already
stated; for God’s judgments as to the reprobate are evident; but when
the godly and the righteous fall under similar punishment, God turns to
good what seems in itself to be the sign of a curse. Though famine is a
sign of a curse, and also the sword, yet we know that many of God’s
children perish by famine and by the sword. But in temporal punishments
this modification is ever to be remembered, — that God shews himself to
be a righteous Judge as to the ungodly and wicked; — and that while he
humbles his own people, he is not yet angry with them, but consults
their benefit, so that what is in itself adverse to them is turned to
their advantage.

<span id="viii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou
anticipatest us by thy word, so that we may not experience thy eternal
severity, — O grant, that we may become teachable, and be so displeased
with our vices, that we may not provoke more and more thy vengeance, but
hasten to seek reconciliation with thee, and that relying on the
Mediator whom thou hast given us, we may flee to thy mercy, until having
been cleansed from all our filth, we shall at length be received into
thy celestial kingdom, and there appear before thee in that parity from
which we are as yet very distant, and shall enjoy that glory which thine
only-begotten Son has obtained for us by his own blood. — Amen.

<span id="viii.iii"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p1"></span>Lecture Sixty-Third

<span id="viii.iv"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
16:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#005.md)<span id="viii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p2"></span>**5**. For thus saith the LORD, Enter not
into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I
have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD, *even*
lovingkindness and mercies.

<span id="viii.iv-p3"></span>**5**. Quia sic dicit Jehova, Ne
ingrediaris domum luctus, et ne eas ad plangendum, et ne movearis
propter illos; quia abstuli pacem meam a populo hoc, dicit Jehova,
clementiam et miserationes.

<span id="viii.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.iv-p5"></span><span id="viii.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p6"></span>As Jeremiah was forbidden at the beginning
of the chapter to take a wife, for a dreadful devastation of the whole
land was very nigh; so now God confirms what he had previously said,
that so great would be the slaughter, that none would be found to
perform the common office of lamenting the dead: at the same time he
intimates now something more grievous, — that they who perished would be
unworthy of any kind office. As he had said before, “Their carcases
shall be cast to the “beasts of the earth and to the birds of heaven;”
so now in this place he intimates, that their deaths would be so
ignominious, that they would be deprived of the honor of a grave, and
would be buried, as it is said in another place, like asses.

<span id="viii.iv-p7"></span>But when God forbids his Prophet to mourn,
we are not to understand that he refers to excess of grief, as when God
intends to moderate grief, when he takes away from us our parents, or
our relatives, or our friends; for the subject here is not the private
feeling of Jeremiah. God only declares that the land would be so
desolate that hardly one would survive to mourn for the dead.

<span id="viii.iv-p8"></span>He says, *Enter not into the house of
mourning* Some render <span id="viii.iv-p8.1"></span>מרזה, *merezach*, a
funeral feast; and it is probable, nay, it may be gathered from the
context, that such feasts were made when any one was dead.  <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) And the same custom we see has been
observed by other nations, but for a different purpose. When the Romans
celebrated a funeral feast, their object was to shake off grief, and in
a manner to convert the dead into gods. Hence Cicero condemns Vatinius,
because he came clothed in black to the feast of Q. Arius, *(Orat. pro
L. Mur.)* and elsewhere he says, that Tuberonis was laughed at and
everywhere repulsed, because he covered the beds with goat’s skins, when
Q. Maximus made a feast at the death of his uncle Africanus. Then these
feasts were among the Romans full of rejoicing; but among the Jews, as
it appears, when they lamented the dead, who were their relatives, they
invited children and widows, in order that there might be some relief to
their sorrow.

<span id="viii.iv-p10"></span>However this may be, God intimates by this
figurative language, that the Jews, when they perished in great numbers,
would be deprived of that common practice, because they were unworthy of
having any survivors to bewail them.

<span id="viii.iv-p11"></span>*Neither go,* he says, *to lament, nor be
moved on their account*  <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) and
why? *For I have taken away my peace from this people,* that is, all
prosperity; for under the term, peace, the Jews included whatever was
desirable. God then says, that he had taken away peace from them, and
*his peace,* because he had pronounced that wicked nation accursed. He
then adds, that he had taken away his *kindness* and his *mercies.*
 <span id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) For the Prophet might have
raised an objection and said, that this was not consistent with the
nature of God, who testifies that he is ready to shew mercy; but God
meets this objection and intimates, that there was now no place for
kindness and mercy, for the impiety of the people had become past all
hope. It follows —

<span id="viii.v"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p1"></span><span id="viii.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
16:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p2"></span>**6**. Both the great and the small shall
die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall *men* lament
for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:

<span id="viii.v-p3"></span>**6**. Et morientur magni et parvi in terra
hac; non sepelient eos, et non plangent super eos, et non incidet se
quisquam, et non fiet calvitium illis;

<span id="viii.v-p4"></span>**7**. Neither shall *men* tear *themselves*
for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall *men*
give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their
mother.

<span id="viii.v-p5"></span>**7**. Et non eomplodent *(vel,* extendent)
illis *(quidam legentes* <span id="viii.v-p5.1"></span>צצץ *pro* <span
id="viii.v-p5.2"></span>צצץ *vertunt,* non frangent panem; <span
id="viii.v-p5.3"></span>צצץ significat frangere, et interdum dividere,
vel ostendere, vel dispergere: non dubium est quin Propheta, sicut alio
loco vidimus intelligat complosionem manuum, vel contorsionem, ubi in
vehementi luctu ita brachia huc et illuc projiciuntur, deinde
comploduntur manus: hunc gestum hoc quoque loco exprimit cum dicit, Et
non frangent, vel, non complodent manus) ad consolandum (hoc est, ad
unumquenque consolandum) super mortuo, et non propinabunt illis calicem
consolationum super patre suo et super matre sua

<span id="viii.v-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.v-p7"></span><span id="viii.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p8"></span>He pursues the same subject: he says that
all would die indiscriminately, the common people as well as the chief
men, that none would be exempt from destruction; for God would make a
great slaughter, both of the lower orders and also of the higher, who
excelled in wealth, in honor, and dignity; *Die shall the great and the
small.* It often happens in changes that the great are punished; and
sometimes the case is that the common people perish, while the nobles
are spared: but God declares, that such would be the destruction, that
their enemies would make no difference between the common people and the
higher ranks, and that if they escaped the hands of their enemies, the
pestilence or the famine would prove their ruin.

<span id="viii.v-p9"></span>He adds, *They shall not bury them, nor beat
their breast for them;* and then, *they shall not eat themselves, nor
make themselves bald for them*  <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md)
This is not mentioned by the Prophet to commend what the people did; nor
did he consider that in this respect they observed the command of the
law; for God had forbidden them to imitate the corrupt customs of the
heathens. (<span id="viii.v-p16.2"></span>[Le
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/lev021.htm#001)<span id="viii.v-p16.2"></span>.md)
We have already said, that the orientals were much given to external
ceremonies, so that there was no moderation in their lamentations:
therefore God intended to correct this excess. But the Prophet here has
no respect to the command, that the Jews were to moderate their grief, —
what then? He meant to shew, as I have already reminded you, that the
slaughters would be so great, that they — would cause hardness and
insensibility, being so immense as to stun the feelings of men. When any
one dies, friends and neighbors meet, and shew respect to his memory;
but when pestilence prevails, or when all perish by famine, the greater
part become hardened and unmindful of themselves and others, and the
offices of humanity are no longer observed. God then shews, that such
would be the devastation of the land, that the Jews, as though callous
and hardened, would no longer lament for one another. In short, he
shews, that together with these dreadful slaughters, such insensibility
and hardness would prevail among the Jews, that no husband would think
of his wife, and no father of his children; but that all of them would
be so astonied by their own evils as to become like the wild beasts.

<span id="viii.v-p17"></span>He says further, *They shall not cut
themselves nor pull off their hairs,* as they had used to do. These
things are mentioned, as they were commonly done; it cannot be hence
concluded, that they were approved by God; for God’s design was not to
pronounce a judgment on their lamentation, on the tearing off of the
hair, or on their incisions. It is indeed certain that these practices
proceeded from the impetuous feelings of men, and were tokens of
impatience; but as I have said, God does not speak here of what was
lawful, but of what men were wont to do.

<span id="viii.v-p18"></span>As to that part, where he says, that he had
taken away his *kindness* and his *mercies,* he does not mean that he
had changed his nature, but his object was to cut off occasion from all
who might complain; for men, we know, whenever God’s hand presses hard
on them, to make them to deplore rightly their miseries, are
stifficiently ready to say, that God visits them with too much severity.
He therefore shews that they were unworthy of kindness and mercies. At
the same time he reminded them that there was no reason for hypocrites
to entertain any hope, because Scripture so often commends the kindness
of God and his mercy; for since they accumulated sins on sins, God could
not do otherwise than come to an extremity with them.

<span id="viii.v-p19"></span><span id="viii.v-p19.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p20"></span>With regard to the seventh verse,  <span
id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) we may learn from it what I have
already referred to, — that the Jews made funeral feasts, that children
and widows might receive some relief to their sorrow; for the Prophet
calls it the *cup of consolations,* when friends kindly attended; they
had also some ridiculous gesticulations; for no doubt laughter was often
excited by mourners among the Jews. But we see that men vied with one
another in lamenting for the dead; for it was deemed a shame not to shew
grief at the death of their friends. When tears did not flow, when the
nearest relations did not howl for the dead, they thought them inhuman;
hence it was, that there was much dissimulation in their mourning; and
it was foolishly regarded an alleviation to extend the cup of
consolation. But as I have said before, the Prophet here did not point
out what was right, but borrowed his words from what was commonly
practiced. It follows —

<span id="viii.vi"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#008.md)<span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p2"></span>**8**. Thou shalt not also go into the
house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.

<span id="viii.vi-p3"></span>**8**. Et domum convivii ne ingrediaris, ut
sedeas cum ipsis ad edendum et ad bibendum.

<span id="viii.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.vi-p5"></span><span id="viii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p6"></span>Here the Prophet refers to other feasts,
where hilarity prevailed. The meaning then is, — that the people were
given up to destruction, so that nothing was better than to depart from
them as far as possible. So Jeremiah is prohibited from going at all to
them, so that he might not be their associate either in joy or in
sorrow; as though he had said, — ‘Have no more anything to do with this
people; if they lament their dead, leave them, for they are unworthy of
any act of kindness; and if they make joyful feasts, be far from them,
for every intercourse with them is accursed.” We now then understand why
the Prophet spoke of grief, lamentation and mourning, and then mentioned
joy. He afterwards adds, —

<span id="viii.vii"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p1"></span><span id="viii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#009.md)<span id="viii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p2"></span>**9**. For thus saith the LORD of hosts,
the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in
your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of
gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.

<span id="viii.vii-p3"></span>**9**. Quoniam sic dixit Jehova
exercituum, Deus Israel, Ecce ego auferens ab hoc loco, coram oculis
vestris, et in diebus vestris, vocem gaudii et vocem laetitiae, vocem
sponsi et vocem sponsae.

<span id="viii.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.vii-p5"></span><span id="viii.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p6"></span>This verse contains a reason for the
preceding, — that every connection with that people would be accursed.
Yet he states one thing more expressly, — that the time was come in
which they were already deprived of all joy; for the ungodly, even when
God most awfully threatens them, strengthen themselves in their
security, hence God intended to give them some presage, that they might
before the time know that the saddest calamities were at hand, by which
every joy and gladness were to be taken away.

<span id="viii.vii-p7"></span>He then says, that the God of *hosts* and
the *God of Israel* had spoken. He at the same time deprived them of all
hope, though he called himself the God of Israel. Hypocrites were wont
either to despise the power of God, or to abuse his goodness. Had not
God checked them, they would have deemed as nothing what the prophets
threatened; and how so? Because they depreciated, as far as they could,
the power of God. Hence God says, that he is the God of *hosts.* But
when they could not in their pride and haughtiness throw down, as it
were the power of God, then they betook themselves to another asylum;
they promised to themselves that he would deal indulgently with them;
and thus they deceived themselves. Hence, on the other hand, God calls
himself here the *God of Israel,* in order that they might know, that it
was of no avail to them, that he had adopted the seed of Abraham; for
they were not the children of Abraham, but aliens, as they had departed
from his piety and faith. This served as a preface.

<span id="viii.vii-p8"></span>Now when he says, <span
id="viii.vii-p8.1"></span>הנני, *enni, Behold me,* he shews that the
Jews had no reason to put off the time, and to indulge avain confidence;
for vengeance was already come. *Behold me,* he says, he thus comes
forth and testifies that he is already prepared to execute his judgment.
*Behold me,*, he says, *taking away from this place, before your eyes,
and in your days,* etc.; their destruction would happen in a short time
and before their eyes. I am taking away, he says, *the voice of joy and
the voice of gladness,*  <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) *the
voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride* Here by stating a
part for the whole, he intimates that they would become like the dead
rather than the living; for the continuance of the human race is
preserved by marriage, as in the offspring mankind are as it were born
again, who would otherwise perish daily. Since then there was no more
time left for marriages, it was a token of final destruction. This is
what the Prophet intimates, when he says, that God would cause the voice
of the bridegroom and of the bride to cease, so that there would be no
more any congratulations. It follows, —

<span id="viii.viii-p2"></span>**10**. And it shall come to pass, when
thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto

or what *is* our iniquity? or what *is* our sin that we have committed

<span id="viii.viii-p4"></span>**11**. Then shalt thou say unto them,
Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked
after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and
have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;

<span id="viii.viii-p6"></span>**12**. And ye have done worse than your

evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:

<span id="viii.viii-p8"></span>**13**. Therefore will I cast you out of
this land into a land that ye know not, *neither* ye nor your fathers;
and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew
you favour.

<span id="viii.viii-p9"></span>**13**. Et expellam vos e terra hae ad

<span id="viii.viii-p10"></span> 

<span id="viii.viii-p11"></span><span id="viii.viii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p12"></span>He shews here what we have seen
elsewhere, — that the people flattered themselves in their vices, so
that they could not be turned by any admonitions, nor be led by any
means to *repentance.* It was a great blindness, nay, even madness, not
to examine themselves, when they were smitten by the hand of God; for
conscience ought to have been to them like a thousand witnesses,
immediately condemning them; but hardly any one was found who examined
his own life; and then, though God proved them guilty, hardly one in a
hundred winingly and humbly submitted to his judgment; but the greater
part murmured and made a clamor, whenever they felt the scourges of God.
This evil, as Jeremiah shews, prevailed among the people; and he shewed
the same in the fifth chapter.

<span id="viii.viii-p13"></span>Hence it is that God says, *When thou
shalt declare these words to this people, and they shall say, Wherefore
has Jehovah spoken all this great evil against us; what is our iniquity?
what is our sin,* that he so rages against us, as though we had acted
wickedly against him? God no doubt intended to obviate in time what that
perverse people might have said, for he knew that they possessed an
untameable disposition. As then he knew that they would be so refractory
as to receive no reproof, he confirms his own Prophet, as though he had
said, “There is no reason for their perverseness to discourage thee; for
they will immediately oppose thee, and treat thee as one doing them a
grievous wrong; they will expostulate with thee and deny that they ought
to be deemed guilty of so great crimes; if then they will thus
petulantly cast aside thy threatenings, there is no reason for thee to
be disheartened, for thou shalt have an answer ready for them.”

<span id="viii.viii-p14"></span>We now see how hypocrites gained
nothing, either by their evasions, or by wantonly rising against God and
his Prophets. At the same time all teachers are reminded here of their
duty, not to vacinate when they have to do with proud and intractable
men. As it appeared elsewhere, where God commanded his Prophet to put on
a brazen front, that he might boldly encounter all the insults of the
people; (<span id="viii.viii-p14.1"></span>[Jer
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p14.1"></span>) the same is the case here, they shall *say
to thee,* that is, when thou threatenest them, they will not winingly
give way, but they will contend as though thou didst accuse them
unjustly, for they will say, “What is our sin? what is our iniquity?
what is the wickedness which we have committed against Jehovah our God,
that he should declare this great evil against us?” Thus we see that
hypocrites vent their rage not only against God’s servants, but against
God himself, not indeed that they profess openly and plainly to do so.
But what is the effect when they cannot bear to be corrected by God’s
hand, but resist and shew that they do not endure correction with a
resigned mind? do they not sufficiently prove that they rebel against
God?

<span id="viii.viii-p15"></span>But *Jeremiah* here graphically
describes the character of those who struggled with God, for they dared
not wholly to deny that they were wicked, but they extenuated as far as
they could their sin, like Cain, who ventured not to assert that he was
innocent, for he was conscious of having done wrong; and the voice of
God, “Where is thy brother?” strengthened the voice of conscience, but
in the meantime he ceased not to utter this complaint,

<span id="viii.viii-p16"></span>“Greater is my punishment than I can
bear.”  
(<span id="viii.viii-p16.2"></span>[Gen.
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#009.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#013)<span id="viii.viii-p16.2"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.viii-p17"></span>So also Jeremiah introduces the people
as speaking, “O, what is our iniquity? and what is the sin which we have
committed against Jehovah our God, that he should speak this great evil
against us?” They say not that they were wholly without fault, they only
object that the atrocity of their sins was not so great as to cause God
to be so angry with them, and to visit them with so grievous a
punishment. They then exaggerated the punishment, that they might obtain
some covering for themselves; and yet they did not say that they were
innocent or free from every fault, but they speak of their iniquities
and sins as though they had said, “We indeed confess that there is
something which God may reprehend, but we do not acknowledge such a mass
of sins and iniquities as to cause him thus to thunder against us.”

<span id="viii.viii-p18"></span><span id="viii.viii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p19"></span>But he then says, *Thou shalt answer
them, Because your fathers forsook me; they went after foreign gods,
served and worshipped them; and me they forsook and my law they kept
not, and ye have done worse*  <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md)
God in the first place accused their fathers, not that punishment ought
to have fallen on their children, except they followed the wickedness of
their fathers, but the men of that age fully deserved to be visited with
the judgment their fathers merited. Besides well known is that
declaration, that God reckons the iniquities of the fathers to their
children; (<span id="viii.viii-p23.1"></span>[Ex
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p23.1"></span>; <span id="viii.viii-p23.2"></span>[Ex
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#007.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p23.2"></span>; <span id="viii.viii-p23.3"></span>[De
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#009)<span id="viii.viii-p23.3"></span>.md)
and he acts thus justly, for he might justly execute vengeance for sins
on the whole human race, according to what Christ says,

<span id="viii.viii-p24"></span>“On you shall come the blood of all the
godly, from righteous Abel to Zachariah the son of Barachiah.” (<span
id="viii.viii-p24.1"></span>[Mt
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p24.1"></span>; <span id="viii.viii-p24.2"></span>[Lu
11:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#051.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p24.2"></span>)

<span id="viii.viii-p25"></span>Thus then the Scripture often declares,
that children shall be punished with their fathers, because God will at
one time or another require an account of all sins, and thus will make
amends for his long forbearance, for as he waits for men and kindly
invites them through his patience to repent, so when he sees no hope he
inflicts all his scourges. It is hence no wonder that children are more
grievously punished after iniquity has prevailed for many ages.

<span id="viii.viii-p26"></span>We hence see that these two things are
not inconsistent — that God connects the punishment of children with
that of their fathers, and that he does not punish the innocent. We
indeed see this fulfilled,

<span id="viii.viii-p27"></span>“The soul that sinneth it shall die; the
children shall not bear the iniquity of their fathers, nor the father
the iniquity of his child,” (<span id="viii.viii-p27.1"></span>[Ezek.
18:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#004.md),
[20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020)<span id="viii.viii-p27.1"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.viii-p28"></span>for God never blends children with their
fathers except they be their associates in wickedness. But yet there is
nothing to prevent God to punish children for the sins of their fathers,
especially when they continually rush headlong into worse sins, when the
children, as we shall hereafter see, exceed their fathers in all kinds
of wickedness.

<span id="viii.viii-p29"></span>We further learn from this passage, that
they bring forward a vain pretense who allege against us the examples of
the Fathers, as we see to be done now by those under the Papacy; for the
shield they boldly set up against us is this, that they imitate the
examples of the fathers. But God declares here that they were worthy of
double punishment who repented not when they saw that their fathers had
been ungodly and transgressors of the law.

<span id="viii.viii-p30"></span>Let us now notice the sins which God
mentions: he says, that they had *forsaken* him. That people could not
make any excuse for going astray, like the unhappy heathens, to whom no
Prophet had been sent, and no law had been given. Hence the heathens had
some excuse more than the Jews. The truth indeed respecting all was,
that they were all apostates, for God had bound the human race to
himself, and all they who followed superstitions were justly charged
with the sin of apostasy; there was yet a greater atrocity of wickedness
in the Jewish people, for God had set before them his law, they had been
brought up as it were in his school, they knew what true religion was,
they were able to distinguish the true God from fictitious gods. We now
then see the meaning of the expression, *They have forsaken me:* and it
is twice repeated, because it was necessary thus to prove the Jews
guilty, that their mouths might be stopped; for we have seen that they
were to be thus roused from their insensibility, inasmuch as they would
have never yielded nor acknowledged their sins, were they not
constrained.

<span id="viii.viii-p31"></span>He says further, that *they went after
foreign gods, served them, and worshipped them* Now this statement
enhances again their sins, for the Jews preferred their own inventions
to the true God, who had by so many signs and testimonies manifested his
glory and made known his power among them. As then God had abundantly
testified his power, it was by no means an endurable ingratitude in them
to follow strange gods, of whom they had only heard. The heathens indeed
vainly boasted of their idols, and spread abroad many fables to allure
unhappy men to false and corrupt worship, but the Jews knew who the true
God was. To believe the fables of the heathens, rather than the law and
their own experience, was not this the basest impiety? This then was the
reason why God complained that foreign gods were worshipped by them.

<span id="viii.viii-p32"></span>Then he adds, *They served and
worshipped them* The verb to serve is often used by the Hebrews to
express worship, as we have stated elsewhere; and thus is refuted the
folly of the Papists who deny that they are idolaters, because they
worship pictures and statues with *dulla,* that is, with service, if we
may so render it, and not with *latria,* as though Scripture in
condemning idolatry never used this verb. But God condemns here the Jews
because they served strange gods, because they gave credit to the false
and vain fictions of the heathens; and then he adds the outward action,
that they prostrated themselves before their idols.

<span id="viii.viii-p33"></span>At the end of this verse he shews how he
had been forsaken, even because they kept not his *law.* He then
confirms what I have already stated, that there was on this account a
worse apostasy among the Jews, for they had knowingly and wilfully
forsaken the fountain of living water, as we have seen in the second
chapter: hence simple ignorance is not what is here reprehended, as
though they had sinned through error or want of knowledge, but they had
rejected the worship of God as it were designedly. The rest I shall
defer till to-morrow.

<span id="viii.ix"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.ix-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we in various
ways daily provoke thy wrath against us, and thou ceasest not to exhort
us to repent, — O grant, that we may be pliant and obedient and not
despise thy kind invitations, while thou settest before us the hope of
thy mercy, nor make light of thy threatenings; but that we may so profit
by thy word as to endeavor to anticipate thy judgments; and may we also,
being allured by the sweetness of thy grace, consecrate ourselves wholly
to thee, that thus thy wrath may be turned away from us, and that we may
become receivers of that grace which thou offerest to all who truly and
from the heart repent, and who desire to have thee propitious to them in
Christ Jesus our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="viii.x"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p1"></span>Lecture Sixty-Fourth

<span id="viii.x-p2"></span><span id="viii.x-p2.1"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p3"></span>I was constrained yesterday to leave
unfinished the words of the Prophet. He said that the children were
*worse* than their fathers, and gave the reason, *Because they followed
the wickedness of their evil heart, and hearkened not to God* He seems
to have said before the same thing of the fathers: it might then be
asked, Why does he say that the children had done worse than their
fathers, and pronounce their sins worse? Now we have already seen that
sins became worse before God, when the children strengthened themselves
in wickedness by following the examples of their fathers. We must also
notice, that not only the law had been set before them, but that also
Prophets had been often sent to them, who added their reproofs: and this
is what Jeremiah seems to have expressed at the end of the verse, by
saying that they *hearkened not,* though daily spoken to by the
Prophets. It was then their obstinacy that God so severely punished:
they had imitated their wicked fathers, and then they not only had
despised, but also through their obstinate wickedness had rejected all
the warnings which the Prophets gave them.

<span id="viii.x-p4"></span><span id="viii.x-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p5"></span>Then follows a commination, *I will eject
you,* he says, or remove you, *from this land to a land which ye know
not, nor your fathers,* for they had followed unknown gods, and went
after inventions of their own and of others. God now declares that he
would be the vindicator of his own glory, by driving them to a land
unknown to them and to their fathers. He immediately adds, *There shall
ye serve other gods day and night* We must take notice of this kind of
punishment, for nothing could have happened worse to the Jews than to be
constrained to adopt false and corrupt forms of worship, as it was a
denial of God and of true religion. As this appears at the first view
hard, some mitigate it, as though the worship of strange gods would be
that servitude into which they were reduced when they became subject to
idolators: but this is too remote. I therefore do not doubt but that God
abandoned them, because they had violated true and pure worship, and had
gone after the many abominations of the heathens; and thus he shews that
they were worthy to be thus dealt with, who had in every way
contaminated themselves, and as it were plunged themselves into the
depth of every thing abominable: and it is certainly probable that they
were led by constraint into ungodly ceremonies, when the Chaldeans had
the power to treat them, as they usually did, as slaves, without any
measure of humanity. It is then hence a probable conjecture that they
were drawn to superstitions, and that interminably; so that they were
not only forced to worship false gods, but were also constrained to do
so by way of sport, as they daily triumphed over them as their
conquerors.

<span id="viii.x-p6"></span>And he confirms this clause by what follows,
*For I will not, etc.*, for the relative <span
id="viii.x-p6.1"></span>אשר *asher,* is here to be taken for a causative
particle, *For I will not shew you favor,* or mercy; that is, I will not
turn the hearts of your enemies so as to be propitious or kind to you.
 <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) By these words God shews that
he would not only punish them by subjecting them to their enemies, or by
suffering them to be driven into exile; but that there would be an
additional punishment by rendering their enemies cruel to them; for God
can either tame the ferocity of men, or, when he pleases, can rouse them
to greater rage and cruelty, when it is his purpose to use them as
scourges.

<span id="viii.x-p8"></span>We now then understand the whole design of
what the Prophet says, that the Jews who had refused to worship God in
their own land would be led away to Chaldea, where they would be
constrained, wining or unwining, to worship strange gods, and that
without end or limits. It now follows —

<span id="viii.xi"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p1"></span><span id="viii.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
16:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014.md)<span
id="viii.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p2"></span>**14**. Therefore, behold, the days come,
saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that
brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;

<span id="viii.xi-p3"></span>**14**. Propterea ecce dies veniunt, dicit
Jehova, et non dicetur amplius *(hoc est,* quibus non dicetur amplius)
vivit Jehova, qui eduxit (ascendere fecit, *ad verbum)* filios Israel e
terra Egypti;

<span id="viii.xi-p4"></span>**15**. But, The LORD liveth, that brought
up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the
lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their
land that I gave unto their fathers.

<span id="viii.xi-p5"></span>**15**. Quin potius, vivit Jehova, qui
ascendere fecit filios Israel e terra Aquilonis, et ex omnibus
regionibus, ad quas expulerat eos; et reducam ad terram eorum quam dedi
patribus vestris.

<span id="viii.xi-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xi-p7"></span><span id="viii.xi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p8"></span>Jeremiah seems here to promise a return to
the Jews; and so the passage is commonly expounded, as though a
consolation is interposed, in which the faithful alone are concerned.
But I consider the passage as mixed, that the Prophet, in part, speaks
in severe terms of the dreadful exile which he foretells, and that he in
part blends some consolation; but the latter subject seems to me to he
indirectly referred to by the Prophet. I therefore think this to be an
amplification of what he had said. This is to be kept in mind. He had
said, “I will expel you from this land, and will send you to a land
unknown to you and to your fathers.” Now follows a circumstance which
increased the grievousness of exile: they knew how cruel was that
servitude from which God had delivered their fathers. Their condition
was worse than hundred deaths, when they were driven to their servile
works; and also, when all justice was denied them, and when their
offspring were from the womb put to death. As then they knew how cruelly
their fathers had been treated by the Egyptians, the comparison he
states more fully shewed what a dreadful punishment awaited them, for
their redemption would be much more incredible.

<span id="viii.xi-p9"></span>We now perceive what the Prophet meant, as
though he had said, “Ye know from what your fathers came forth, even
from a brazen furnace, as it is said elsewhere, and as it were from the
depth of death, so that that redemption ought to be remembered to the
end of the world; but God will now cast you into an abyss deeper than
that of Egypt from which your fathers were delivered; and when from
thence he will redeem you, it will be a miracle far more wonderful to
your posterity, so that it will almost extinguish, or at least obscure
the memory of the first redemption: *It will not then be said any more,
Live does Jehovah, who brought the children of Israel from Egypt,* for
that Egyptian captivity was far more endurable than what this latter
shall be; for ye shall be plunged as it were into the infernal regions;
and when God shall rescue you from thence, it will be a work far more
wonderful.” This I consider to be the real meaning of the Prophet.
 <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md)

<span id="viii.xi-p11"></span>Yet his object was at the same time
indirectly to give them some hope of their future redemption; but this
he did not do avowedly. We ought then to regard what the Prophet had in
view, even to strike the Jews, as I have said, with terror, so that they
might know that there was an evil nigh at hand more grievous than what
their fathers suffered in Egypt, who yet had been most cruelly
oppressed. Then their former liberation would be rendered obscure and
not celebrated as before, though it was nevertheless an evidence of the
wonderful power of God.

<span id="viii.xi-p12"></span><span id="viii.xi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p13"></span>*But,* it will be rather said, *Live does
Jehovah, for he has brought his people from the land of the north;* and
for this reason, because there will be less hope remaining for you, when
the Chaldeans shall subdue and scatter you like a body torn asunder, and
when the name of Israel shall be extinguished, when the worship of God
shall be subverted and the Temple destroyed. When therefore all things
shall appear to be past remedy, this captivity shall be much more
dreadful than that by which your fathers had been oppressed. Therefore,
when God restores you, it will be a miracle much more remarkable. And
that the Prophet took occasion to give thom some hope of God’s favor,
may be gathered from the end of the verse, when he says, *And I will
make them to return to their own land:* but the copulative ought to be
rendered as a conditional particle, as though he had said, *When I shall
restore them to their own land which I gave to their fathers* It now
follows —

<span id="viii.xii"></span>

<span id="viii.xii-p1"></span><span id="viii.xii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016.md)<span id="viii.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xii-p2"></span>**16**. Behold, I will send for many
fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send
for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from
every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.

<span id="viii.xii-p3"></span>**16**. Ecce ego mitto ad piscatores
multos, dicit Jehova, et piscabuntur; et sic (post haec) mittam ad
multos venatores, et venabuntur eos de super omni monte, *(hoc est,* ex
omni monte,) et omni colle, et foraminibus *(vel,* cavernis) rapium.

<span id="viii.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xii-p6"></span>Some explain this of the apostles; but it
is wholly foreign to the subject: they think that Jeremiah pursues here
what he had begun to speak of; for they doubt not but that he had been
speaking in the last verse of a future but a near deliverance, in order
to raise the children of God into a cheerful confidence. But I have
already rejected this meaning, for their exposition is not well founded.
But if it be conceded that the Prophet had prophesied of the liberation
of the people, it does not follow that God goes on with the same
subject, for he immediately returns to threatenings, as ye will see; and
the allegory also is too remote when he speaks of hunters and fishers;
and as mention is made of ‘hills and mountains, it appears still more
clearly that the Prophet is threatening the Jews, and not promising them
any alleviation in their miseries. I therefore connect all these things
together in a plain manner; for, having said that the evil which the
Jews would shortly have to endure would be more grievous than the
Egyptian bondage, he now adds a reason as a confirmation, —

<span id="viii.xii-p7"></span>*Behold,* he says, *I will send to them
many fishers,* that they may gather them together on every side. He
mentions fishers, as they would draw the children of Israel from every
quarter to their nets. He then compares the Chaldeans to fishers, who
would so proceed through the whole land as to leave none except some of
the most ignoble, whom also they afterwards took away; and to fishers he
adds *hunters.* Some understand by fishers armed enemies, who by the
sword slew the conquered; and they consider that the hunters were those
who were disposed to spare the life of the many, and to drive them into
exile; but this appears too refined. Simple is the view which I have
stated, that the Chaldeans were called fishers, because they would empty
the whole land of its inhabitants, and that they were called hunters,
because the Jews, having been scattered here and there, and become
fugitives, would yet be found out in the recesses of hins and rocks.

<span id="viii.xii-p8"></span>The two similitudes are exceedingly
suitable; for the Prophet shews that the Chaldeans would not have much
trouble in taking the Jews, inasmuch as fishers only spread their nets;
they do not arm themselves against fishes, nor is there any need; and
then all the fish they take they easily take possession of them, for
there is no resistance. Thus, then, he shews that the Chaldeans would
gain an easy victory, for they would take the Jews as fishes which are
drawn into nets. This is one thing. Then, in the second place, he says,
that if they betook themselves into recesses of mountains, that if they
hid themselves in caverns or holes, their enemies would be like hunters
who follow the wild beasts in forests and in other unfrequented places;
no brambles, nor thorns, nor any obstructions prevent them from
advancing, being led on by a strong impulse; so in like manner no
recesses of mountains would be concealed from the Chaldeans, no caverns
where the Jews might hide themselves, for they would all be taken. We
hence see that he confirms by two similitudes, what he had said in a
preceding verse. He afterwards adds —

<span id="viii.xiii-p2"></span>**17**. For mine eyes *are* upon all
their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid
from mine eyes.

<span id="viii.xiii-p3"></span>**17**. Quia oculi mei super omnes vias

<span id="viii.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xiii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiii-p6"></span>The Prophet now shews that the grievous
calamity of which he had spoken would be a just reward for the
wickedness of the people; for we know that the prophets were endued with
the Spirit of God not merely that they might foretell things to come —
for that would have been very jejune; but a doctrine was connected with
their predictions. Hence the prophets not only foretold what God would
do, but at the same time added the causes. There is then now added a
doctrine as a seasoning to the prophecy; for the Prophet says that the
destructiorl of the Jews was at hand, because they had long greatly
provoked the wrath of God. As there is no end to the evasions of
hypocrites, according to what we observed yesterday, God here reminds
them of his judgment, as though he had said, “This one thing is
sufficient, he knows their iniquities, and he is a fit judge; so they
contend in vain, and try in vain, to excuse or to extenuate their
fault.”

<span id="viii.xiii-p7"></span>Hence he says that *the eyes* of God
*were on all their ways:* and he mentions *all their ways,* because they
had not offended only once, or in one way, but they had added sins to
sins. *Nor are they hid,* he says: the Prophet presses the matter on
their attention; for had he allowed their false pretences, they would
have made no end of excuses. He therefore says that their ways *were not
hid, nor their iniquities concealed from the eyes* of God. Now follows a
confirmation —

<span id="viii.xiv"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p1"></span><span id="viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#018.md)<span id="viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p2"></span>**18**. And first I will recompense their
iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they
have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and
abominable things.

<span id="viii.xiv-p3"></span>**18**. Et rependam ab initio duplum
iniquitatum eorum et scelerum eorum; quia polluerunt (super polluere
ipsos) terram meam in cadaveribus abominationum suarum, et suis
inquinamentis replerunt haereditatem meam.

<span id="viii.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xiv-p5"></span><span id="viii.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p6"></span>Jeremiah introduces here nothing new, but
proceeds with the subject we observed in the last verse, — that God
would not deal with so much severity with the Jews, because extreme
rigor was pleasing to him, or because he had forgotten his own nature or
the covenant which he had made with Abraham, but because the Jews had
become extremely obstinate in their wickedness. As, then, he had said
that the *eyes* of God *were on all their ways,* so now he adds that he
would *recompense* them as they deserved.

<span id="viii.xiv-p7"></span>But every word ought to be *considered:*
He says <span id="viii.xiv-p7.1"></span>ראשונה *rashune,* which I render
“From the beginning.” Some render it more obscurely, “at first,” — I
will first recompense them. The word means formerly, and refers to time.
The Prophet then, I have no doubt, means what I have already referred
to, — that God would punish the fathers and their children, and would
thus gather into one mass their old iniquities. We have quoted from the
law that God would recompense unto the bosom of children the sins of
their fathers; and we have also quoted that declaration of Christ,

<span id="viii.xiv-p8"></span>“Come upon you shall righteous blood from
Abel to Zachariah, the son of Barachiah.” (<span
id="viii.xiv-p8.1"></span>[Mt
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md)<span id="viii.xiv-p8.1"></span>;
<span id="viii.xiv-p8.2"></span>[Lu
11:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#051)<span id="viii.xiv-p8.2"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.xiv-p9"></span>The Prophet now repeats the same thing, —
that God, in allotting to the Jews their reward, would collect together
as it were all the iniquities which had been as it were long buried, so
that he would include the fathers and their children in one bundle, and
gather together all their sins, in order that he might consume them as
it were in one heap. In this way I explain the term “From the
beginning.”  <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md)

<span id="viii.xiv-p15"></span>He then adds, *The double of their
iniquities and their sins* The Prophet does not mean that there would be
an excess of severity, as though God would not rightly consider what men
deserved; but “double” signifies a just and complete measure, according
to what is said in <span id="viii.xiv-p15.1"></span>[Isa
40:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#002.md)<span id="viii.xiv-p15.1"></span>,

<span id="viii.xiv-p16"></span>“The Lord hath recompensed double for all
her sins;”

<span id="viii.xiv-p17"></span>that is, sufficiently and more, *(satis
superque)* as the Latins say. There God assumes the character of a
father, and, according to his great kindness, says that the Jews had
been more than sufficiently punished. So also in this place, in speaking
of punishment, he calls that double, not what would exceed the limits of
justice, but because God would shew himself differently to them from
what he had done before, when he patiently bore with them; as though he
had said, “I will to the utmost punish them; for there will be no
remission, no lenity,no mercy.” We hence see that what is here designed
is only extreme rigor, which yet was just and right; for had God
punished a hundred times more severely even those who seemed to have
sinned lightly, his justice could not have been questioned as though he
had acted cruelly. Since, the Jews, then, had in so many ways, and for
so long a time, and so grievously sinned, God could not have been
thought too severe, when he rendered to them their reward; and he calls
it double because he omitted nothing in order to carry it to the utmost
severity. Probably he alludes also to the enemies as being ministers of
his vengeance, whose cruelty would be more atrocious than the Jews
thought, who imagined some slight remedies for slight sins, as we say,
*Il n’y faudra plus retourner,* or, *tote outre.*

<span id="viii.xiv-p18"></span>He mentions *sins and iniquities,* for
Jeremiah had introduced them before as speaking thus, “What is our
iniquity? and what is our sin?” Though they could not wholly exculpate
themselves, they yet continued to allege some pretences, that they might
not appear to be altogether wicked. But here God declares that they were
wholly wicked and ungodly; and he adds a confirmation, that they had
*polluted the land with the carcases of their abominations* The Prophet
mentions a particular thing, for had he spoken generally, the Jews would
have raised a clamor and said, that they were not conscious of being so
wicked. That he might then bring the matter home to them, he shews as it
were by the finger that their sin was by no means excusable, for they
had polluted the land of God with their superstitions; they have
polluted, he says, *my land* He exaggerates their crime by saying, that
they polluted the holy land. The earth indeed is God’s and its fullness.
(<span id="viii.xiv-p18.1"></span>[Ps
24:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#001)<span id="viii.xiv-p18.1"></span>.md)
Hence it might be said justly of the whole world, that the land of God
is polluted when men act on it an ungodly part. But here God
distinguishes Canaan from other countries, because it was dedicated as
it were to his name. As God then had set apart that land for himself,
that he might be there worshipped, he says, they have *polluted my land*

<span id="viii.xiv-p19"></span>And he adds, *With the carcases of their
abominations* It is probable that he calls their sacrifices carcases.
For though in appearance their superstitions bore a likeness to the true
and lawful worship of God, yet we know that the sacrifices which God had
commanded were seasoned by his word as with salt; they were therefore of
good odor and fragrance before God. As to the sacrifices offered to
idols, they were foetid carcases, they were mere rottenness, yet the
ceremony was altogether alike. But God does not regard the external
form, for obedience is better before him than all sacrifices. (<span
id="viii.xiv-p19.1"></span>[1Sa
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md)<span
id="viii.xiv-p19.1"></span>) We hence see that there is to be understood
a contrast between the carcases and the sweet odor which lawful
sacrifices possessed. For as sacrifices, rightly offered according to
the rule of the law, pleased God and were said to be of sweet savor so
the victims superstitiously offered having no command of God in their
favor, were called filthy carcases.

<span id="viii.xiv-p20"></span>And he says further, *With their
defilements have they filled mine inheritance* The land of Canaan is
called the inheritance of God in the same sense in which the land is
before called his land. But in this second clause something more is
expressed, as it is the usual manner of Scripture to amplify. It was
indeed a grievous thing that the land dedicated to God should be
polluted; but when he says, This is *mine inheritance,* that is, the,
land which I have chosen to dwell in with my people, that it might be to
me as it were a kind of an earthly habitation, and that this land was
fined with defilements, it was a thing altogether intolerable. We now
then see that the Jews were so bridled and checked that they in vain
attempted to escape, or thought to gain anything by evasions, for their
impiety was intolerable and deserved to be most severely punished by
God. I will not proceed further, for it is a new discourse.

<span id="viii.xv"></span>

<span id="viii.xv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.xv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast not
given to thy servants a small corner only of the earth to dwell in, but
hast designed to extend thy kingdom to the utmost borders of the earth,
and to dwell with us, wherever we be, by thine onIy-begotten Son, — O
grant, that we may offer ourselves as sacrifices to thee, and labor also
so to regulate our life according to thy word that thy name may be
glorified in and by us, till we shall become at length partakers of that
celestial and eternal glory, which has been provided for us by Christ
our Lord — Amen.

<span id="viii.xvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#019.md)<span id="viii.xvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p2"></span>**19**. O LORD, my strength, and my
fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall
come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our
fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and *things* wherein *there is* no
profit.

<span id="viii.xvii-p3"></span>**19**. Jehova, robur meum et munitio
mea, et refugium in die angustiae, *(vel,* afflictionis) ad te Gentes
venient e finibus terrae ac dicent, Certe mendacium possederunt patres
nostri, vanitas (vanitatem) et nihil in ipsis utile.

<span id="viii.xvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xvii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p6"></span>What the Prophet has said hitherto might
appear contrary to the promises of God, and wholly subversive of the
covenant which he had made with Abraham. God had chosen to himself one
people from the whole world, now when this people were trodden under
foot what could the most perfect of the faithful suppose but that that
covenant was rendered void, since God had resolved to destroy the Jews
and to obliterate their name? This was then a most grievous trial, and
sufficient, to shake the strongest minds. The Prophet therefore now
returns to the subject, and obviates this temptation; and seeing men in
despair he turns to God, and speaks of the calling of the Gentiles,
which was sufficient wholly to remove that stumbling — block, which I
have mentioned respecting the apostasy and ruin of the chosen people. We
now perceive the Prophet’s meaning.

<span id="viii.xvii-p7"></span>When any one reads the whole chapter, he
may think that Jeremiah abruptly turns to address God; but what I have
stated ought to be borne in mind, for his purpose was to fortify himself
and the faithful against the thought I have mentioned, which would have
otherwise shaken the faith of them all. And he shews what is best to be
done in a troubled and dark state of things, for Satan hunts for nothing
more than to involve us in various and intricate disputes, and he is an
acute disputant, yea, and a sophist; we are also very ready to receive
what he may suggest, and thus it happens that the thoughts which we
either attain ourselves or too readily receive when offered by the
artifice of Satan, often overwhelm us. There is then no better remedy
than to break off such disputes and to turn our eyes and all our
thoughts to God. This the Prophet did when he said, *O Jehovah, to thee
shall the Gentiles come*

<span id="viii.xvii-p8"></span>We now see that Jeremiah sets the
conversion of the Gentiles in opposition to the destruction which he had
before denounced; for the truth of God and his mercy were so connected
with the salvation of the chosen people, that their destruction seemed
to obliterate them. Therefore the Prophet sets forth in opposition to
this the conversion of the Gentiles, as though he had said, “Though the
race of Abraham perishes, yet God’s covenant fails not, nor is there any
diminution of his grace, for he will convert all the Gentiles to
himself.” If any one objects and says, that though the Gentiles be
converted, yet the covenant of God could not have been valid and
perpetual, except the posterity of Abraham were heirs of that grace
which God had promised to him. To this there is a ready answer, for when
God turned the Gentiles to himself he was mindful of his promise, so as
to gather a Church to himself both from the Jews and the Gentiles, as we
also know that Christ came to proclaim peace to those afar off and to
them who were nigh, according to what Paul teaches. (<span
id="viii.xvii-p8.1"></span>[Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017)<span id="viii.xvii-p8.1"></span>.md)
Jeremiah then includes in the calling of the Gentiles what is said
elsewhere,

<span id="viii.xvii-p9"></span>“A remnant according to the election of
grace.”  
(<span id="viii.xvii-p9.2"></span>[Ro
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005)<span id="viii.xvii-p9.2"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.xvii-p10"></span>It is an argument from the greater to
the less; “God will not retain a few men only, but will gather to
himself those who now seem dispersed through the whole world; much more
then shall all those of the race of Abraham, who are chosen by God, be
saved; and though the great body of the people perish, yet the Lord, who
knows his own people, will not suffer them to perish even in the worst
state of things.”

<span id="viii.xvii-p11"></span>But as the struggle was difficult, he
calls God his *strength,* and *fortress,* and *refuge.* He says <span
id="viii.xvii-p11.1"></span>עזי ומעזי *ozi vemozi, ma force et
forteresse,* for the two words come from the same root, and we cannot in
Latin thus fitly translate them. He then calls God his *strength* and
his *fortress,* but both words are derived from a verb which means to be
strong. He then adds, *my refuge in the day of affliction* We here see
that God according to circumstances is adorned with names, such as are
fit to give us confidence, and as it were to arm us for the purpose of
sustaining all the assaults of temptations, for there was not sufficient
force and power in that plain declaration, “O Jehovah, the Gentiles
shall come to thee,” but as the Prophet was reduced to the greatest
straits, and, as I have said, his faith nmst have been greatly tried, he
calls God his strength, his fortress, and his refuge in the day of
affliction; as though he had said, “Now is the time when I find how
necessary is thy protection, thy strength, thy power; for though my
present miseries, and the approaching ruin dishearten me, yet thou wilt
be to me a refuge.”

<span id="viii.xvii-p12"></span>But he says, that *the Gentiles would
come from the ends of the earth*  <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) A contrast is to be observed here
also; for the Jews at first worshipped God, as it were in an obscure
corner; but he says, “When that land shall cast out its inhabitants, all
nations shall come, not only from neighboring countries, but also from
the extremities of the earth.” He adds, that the Gentiles would say,
*surely falsehood leave our fathers possessed; it was vanity, there was
nothing profitable in them* To possess, here means the same as to
inherit; for we know that one’s own inheritance is valuable to him; and
men are as it were fixed in their farms and fields. As then the
Gentiles, before they were enlightened, thought their chief happiness to
be in their superstitions, the Prophet says here, by way of concession,
that they *possessed falsehood,* as though it was said, “Our fathers
thought themselves blessed and happy when they worshipped idols and
their own inventions.” It was therefore *their heritage,* that is, they
thought nothing better or more to be desired than to embrace their idols
and their errors; but it *was falsehood,* he says, that is, when they
thought that they had a glorious inheritance it was only a foolish
imagination; it was, in short, *vanity,* and there was nothing *useful*
or profitable *in them.* This confession proves the conversion of the
Gentiles by external evidences. When we offend God, not only secretly,
but also by bad examples, repentance requires confession. Hence the
Prophet shews a change in the Gentiles, for they would of themselves
acknowledge that their fathers had been deceived by superstitions; for
while they thought that they were acting rightly, they were only under
the influence of inusions and fascinations.

<span id="viii.xvii-p14"></span>But it is not to be doubted but that the
Prophet here indirectly condemns the Jews, because they had not departed
from the sins of their fathers, though they had been often admonished.
*The Gentiles* then *shall come,* and the ignorance of their fathers
shall not prevent them from confessing that they and their fathers were
guilty before God. Since then the hinderance which from deliberate
wickedness held fast the Jews, would not prevail with the Gentiles, it
appeared evident how great was the contumacy of the people, who could
not be persuaded to forsake the bad examples of their fathers. We now
understand what the Prophet means, and for what purpose he introduced
this prayer. It follows —

<span id="viii.xviii"></span>

<span id="viii.xviii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
16:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#020.md)<span
id="viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xviii-p2"></span>**20**. Shall a man make gods unto
himself, and they *are* no gods?

<span id="viii.xviii-p3"></span>**20**. An faciet sibi homo deos? et
ipsi non sunt dii.

<span id="viii.xviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xviii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xviii-p6"></span>Some frigidly explain this verse, as
though the Prophet said that men are doubly foolish, who form for
themselves gods from wood, stone, gold, or silver, because they cannot
change their nature; for whatever men may imagine, the stone remains a
stone, the wood remains wood. The sense then they elicit from the
Prophet’s words is this — that they are not gods who are devised by the
foolish imaginations of men. But the Prophet reasons differently, — “Can
he who is not God make a god?” that is, “can he who is created be the
creator?” No one can give, according to the common proverb, what he has
not; and there is in man no divine power. We indeed see what our
condition is; there is nothing more frail and perishable: as man then is
all vanity, and has in him nothing solid, can he create a god for
himself? This is the Prophet’s argument: it is drawn from what is
absurd, in order that men might at length acknowledge, not only their
presumption, but their monstrous madness. For when any one is asked as
to his condition, he must necessarily confess that he is a creature, and
that he is also, as the ancients have said, all ephemeral animal, that
his life is like a shadow. Since then men are constrained, by the real
state of things, to make such a confession, how comes it that they dare
to form gods for themselves? God does not create a god, he creates men;
he has created angels, he has created the heavens and the earth, but yet
he does not put forth his power to create a new god. Now man, what is
he? nothing but vanity; and yet he will create a god though he is no
God.  <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md)

<span id="viii.xviii-p14"></span>There is no doubt but that the Prophet
here, as with new rigor, boldly attacks the Jews. For it seems evident
that, when this temptation assailed him — “What can this mean t what
will at length happen when God rejects the race of Abraham whom he had
chosen?” he turned to God: but now, having recovered confidence, he
inveighs against the ungodly, and says, *can man create gods for himself
while yet he is not a god?* The change in the number ought not to be
deemed strange; for when there is an indefinite declaration the nmnber
is often changed, both in Greek and Latin. If some particular person was
intended, the Prophet would not have said, *And they themselves are not
gods;* but as he speaks of mankind generally and indefinitely, the
sentence reads better when he says, “Shall man make a god? and they,”
that is men, “are not gods.” This remark I have added, because it is
probable, that those who consider idols to be intended in the last
clause have been led astray by the change that is made in the number. It
follows, —

<span id="viii.xix"></span>

<span id="viii.xix-p1"></span><span id="viii.xix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#021.md)<span id="viii.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xix-p2"></span>**21**. Therefore, behold, I will this
once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my
might; and they shall know that my name*is* The LORD.

<span id="viii.xix-p3"></span>**21**. Propterea ecce ego cognoscere
faciam ipsos hac vice, ostendam ipsis (cognoscere ipsos faciam) manum
meam et potentiam meam; et cognoscent quod nomen meum Jehova.

<span id="viii.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xix-p5"></span><span id="viii.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xix-p6"></span>The Prophet again threatens the Jews,
because their impiety was inexcusable, especially when attended with so
great an obstinacy, he therefore says that God was already present as a
judge: *Behold I*, he says — the demonstrative particle shews the near
approach of vengeance — *I will shew at this time:* the words are
emphatical, for God indirectly intimates that the Babylonian exile would
be an extraordinary event, far exceeding every other which had preceded
it. *At this time,* he says — that is, if ye have hitherto been tardy
and insensible, or, if the punishments I have already inflicted have not
been sufficiently severe — *I will at this time shew to them my hand and
my power; and they shall know that my name is Jehovah*  <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md)

<span id="viii.xix-p13"></span>This way of speaking often occurs in
Scripture; but God here, no doubt, reproves the false sentiments with
which the Jews were imbued, and by which they were led astray from true
religion — for they had devised for themselves many gods; hence he says,
*They shall know that my name is Jehovah,* that is, that my name is
sacred, and ought not to be given to others. But at the same time he
intimates that he would shew to them his power by destroying them, which
they had refused to acknowledge in the preservation promised to them.
They would indeed have ever found the God of Abraham to be the same, had
they not deprived themselves of his favor. As then they had wandered
after their own delusions and inventions, God says now, *I will shew to
them my hand,* that is, for their ruin; and they shall now know for
their own misery what they had refused to acknowledge for their own
safety — that I am the only true God.

<span id="viii.xix-p14"></span>Here let us first learn that it was
wholly a diabolical madness, when men dared to devise for themselves a
god; for had they regarded their own beginning and their own end,
doubtless they could not have betrayed so much presumption and audacity
as to invent a god for themselves. If this only came to the mind of an
idolater, “What art thou? whence is thine origin? where goest thou, and
what end awaits thee?” all his false imaginations would have instantly
fallen to the ground; he would no longer think of forming a god for
himself, nor of worshipping anything he might invent. How then does it
happen that men proceed to such a madness as to devise gods for
themselves, according to their own fancies, except that they know not
themselves? It is then no wonder that men are blind in seeking God, when
they do not consider nor examine themselves. It hence follows that God
cannot be rightly worshipped except men are made humble. And humility is
the best preparation for faith, that there may be a submission to the
word of God. Idolaters do indeed pretend some kind of humility, but they
afterwards involve themselves in such stupidity, that they are unwining
to make any enquiry, so as to make any difference between light and
darkness. But true humility leads us to seek God in his word.

<span id="viii.xix-p15"></span>But when the Prophet asks this question,
“Shall man make a god for himself?” he does not mean, that either the
Egyptians or the Assyrians were so ignorant as to think that they could
give divinity to wood or stone; but that whatever men dared to invent
for themselves as to divine worship, was nothing else but the creation
of a god. As soon then as we allow ourselves the liberty to worship God
in this or in that way, or to imagine God to be such and such a being,
we create gods for ourselves. And as to that point where he says, *They
shall know that my name is Jehovah,* we must observe, that what is his
own is taken away from God, except we acquiesce in him alone, so as to
allow no other divinities to creep in and to be received; for God does
not retain his own right or his own glory, except he be regarded as the
only true God. Now follows —

aloud or to shout, either for grief or for joy: it is here for grief,
and in <span id="viii.iv-p9.1"></span>[Am
6:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.iv-p9.1"></span>,
for joy. The literal rendering here is, “Enter not the house of
shouting.” The version of the *Septuagint* is wide of the mark, “Enter
not into their bacchanalian assembly, (<span
id="viii.iv-p9.2"></span>θίασον.)” The *Syriac* omits the word, and the
*Vulgate* and *Targum* have “feast.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_157"></span>[158](cc18007.htm#fr_157.md) <span
id="viii.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p12"></span> The verb means to move, or to nod, either
in contempt or in sympathy. The latter is the meaning here: hence to
condole is the sense. He was not to go for the purpose of lamenting the
dead, or of condoling with the living. To “mourn” is the *Septuagint, a*
word of a similar meaning with the preceding; more correct is to
“console,” as given by the *Vulqate* and the *Targum.* — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_158"></span>[159](cc18007.htm#fr_158.md) <span
id="viii.iv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p13"></span> These words are omitted by the
*Septuagint*, but given by the other versions, and are left out in no
copies. The “and” before “kindness” is found in two MSS., and in the
*Syriac,* but not in the *Vulgate:* it seems necessary. The passage I
thus render, —

<span id="viii.iv-p14"></span>For withdrawn have I my peace From this
people, saith Jehovah, My mercy also and my compassions.

<span id="viii.iv-p15"></span>There is here a reason given for the
preceding prohibitions: the Prophet was to shew no favor, no kindness to
the people, and no sympathy with them: for God had withdrawn from them
his “peace,” which means here his favor, and also his mercy or his
benignity, as some render the word, and his compassions. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_159"></span>[160](cc18007.htm#fr_159.md) <span
id="viii.v-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p10"></span> The first clause of the verse, as well as
the last of the preceding, is omitted in the *Septuagint*, but retained
in the *Vulgate, Syriac,* and the *Targum*. The verbs in the next clause
ought to be rendered as transitives, —

<span id="viii.v-p11"></span>They shall not bury *them* nor lament for
them.

<span id="viii.v-p12"></span>Then the two concluding verbs are to he
rendered as impersonals, —

<span id="viii.v-p13"></span>And there shall be no cutting nor making
bald for them.

<span id="viii.v-p14"></span>The Welsh is a *literal* version of the
Hebrew, —

<span id="viii.v-p15"></span><span id="viii.v-p15.1"></span>Ac nid
ymdorrir ac nid ymfoelir drostynt.

<span id="viii.v-p16"></span>Nothing can be much more literal. The first
verb is in Hithpael, and so the Welsh is; for like Hebrew it has a
reciprocal form for its verbs. The last verb is also in Welsh in this
form; but it needs not be so, for it might be, <span
id="viii.v-p16.1"></span>*ac ni foelir* — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_160"></span>[161](cc18007.htm#fr_160.md) <span
id="viii.v-p20.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p21"></span> *Calvin,* having in his version explained
the beginning of this verse, passes it by here. His rendering is, “And
they shall not beat their hands together for them, to console *any one*
for the dead.” He omits one word, rendered, “in mourning” in our
version. The *Septuagint,* the *Vulgate,* the *Arabic* and the *Targum*
give another meaning. They must have read <span
id="viii.v-p21.1"></span>לחם “bread,” instead of <span
id="viii.v-p21.2"></span>להם “for them.” The difference is so small that
we are inclined to think it the true readIng, though there be but two
MSS. in its favor. The passage itself seems to require this reading, —
the verb which precedes it, and the correspondence between the former
and latter part of the verse — bread and drink. The verse then would
read thus, —

<span id="viii.v-p22"></span>**7.** And they shall not divide bread to
the mourner, To console him for the dead: Nor shall they give them to
drink the cup of consolations, *Each one* for his father and for his
mother.

<span id="viii.v-p23"></span>*Blayney* quotes Jerome, who says, “It was
usual to carry provisions to mourners, and to make an entertainment,
which sort of feasts the Greeks call <span
id="viii.v-p23.1"></span>περιδειπνα, and the Latin <span
id="viii.v-p23.2"></span>*parentalia.”* — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_161"></span>[162](cc18007.htm#fr_161.md) <span
id="viii.vii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p9"></span> Rather, “The voice of exultation and the
voice of joy;” the most manifest display first — exultation; and then
the most hidden feeling — joy. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_162"></span>[163](cc18007.htm#fr_162.md) <span
id="viii.viii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p20"></span> The division of these verses, the 11th
and the 12th (<span id="viii.viii-p20.1"></span>[Jer
16:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#011.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p20.1"></span>), seems incorrect. Were the latter part of
the 11th connected with the 12th, the repetition which now appears would
not be perceived. I render the verses thus —

<span id="viii.viii-p21"></span>**11.** Then say to them, Because your
fathers forsook *me,* saith Jehovah, And walked after foreign gods, And
served them and bowed down to them: Yea, me they forsook and my law kept
not,

<span id="viii.viii-p22"></span>**12.** And ye have become evil by doing
worse than your fathers; For lo, ye are walking, every man, After the
resolutions of his own evil heart, So as not to hearken to me.

<span id="viii.viii-p23"></span>In the first part their fathers’ conduct
is set forth; in the second their fathers’ conduct and their own. And
their “worse” conduct was in not hearkening to the voice of God by his
Prophets. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[164](cc18007.htm#fr_163.md) <span
id="viii.x-p6.2"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p7"></span> The *Targum* and the versions, except the
*Syriac,* apply this clause to their enemies, “who will not shew you
favor,” or mercy; and no doubt this reads better; and the verb in that
case would be <span id="viii.x-p7.1"></span>יתנו but there is no MS. in
its favor. The relative may be regarded in the same way as at the second
verse of the first chapter, (To whom the word, etc.,) “To whom I will
not shew favor.” This kind of idiom evidently exists in Hebrew. However
the sense is the same as given in the ancient versions, only according
to the Hebrew reading the original cause of the favor is expressly
mentioned. The denial of favor proceeded from God’s providence, though
it was through the instrumentality of their enemies. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_164"></span>[165](cc18007.htm#fr_164.md) <span
id="viii.xi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p10"></span> No particular notice is taken of <span
id="viii.xi-p10.1"></span>לכן rendered “therefore,” at the beginning of
the verse. *Gataker* renders it “notwithstanding;” *Lowth,*
“nevertheless,” and *Blayney,* “after this.” What suits the passage best
is “nevertheless.” The verse appears to be parenthetic, introduced for
the purpose of keeping the people from despair under their sufferings. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_165"></span>[166](cc18007.htm#fr_165.md) <span
id="viii.xiv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p10"></span> The *Septuagint* omit this word, and
give this rendering, “And I will recompense their twofold iniquities,”
etc., so does the *Vulgate*, only it retains this word, and renders it
“first.” But the Hebrew will not admit the connection of “two-fold” with
“iniquities.”

<span id="viii.xiv-p11"></span>*Venema* gives the best exposition of
this passage, from <span id="viii.xiv-p11.1"></span>[Jer
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#014.md)<span id="viii.xiv-p11.1"></span>
to the end, he considers it a prophecy of the restoration of the people
from Babylon. The “fishers” and “the hunters,” in <span
id="viii.xiv-p11.2"></span>[Jer
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016.md)<span
id="viii.xiv-p11.2"></span>, he regards as the indibviduals employed by
God to gather them from the countries to which they had been dispersed,
suych as Zerubbabel, Joshuah, Ezra, and Nehemiah. He connects this verse
more especially with the latter part of <span
id="viii.xiv-p11.3"></span>[Jer
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#017.md)<span
id="viii.xiv-p11.3"></span>. Having stated that their ways would not be
hid from God in their dispersion, the Prophet refers to their previous
iniquity as having not been hid from them, and then says in God’s name,
“And I will first recompense doubly their iniquity,” etc., that is
before I restore them. These two verses may be thus rendered, the first
line being connected with the previous verse, —

<span id="viii.xiv-p12"></span>**17.** For mine eyes *shall be* on all
their ways. Concealed have they not been from me, Nor hid has been their
iniquity from my eyes;

<span id="viii.xiv-p13"></span>**18.** And I will first doubly
recompense Their iniquity and their sin, Because they have polluted my
land With the vileness of their detestable things, And with their
abominations have fined mine inheritance.

<span id="viii.xiv-p14"></span>As the previous verse is in the future
tense, so the first line in <span id="viii.xiv-p14.1"></span>[Jer
16:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#017.md)<span
id="viii.xiv-p14.1"></span>. The “detestable things” were their idols.
The version of the *Septuagint* is, “with the dead bodies (<span
id="viii.xiv-p14.2"></span>θνησιμαίοις) of their abominations;” of the
*Vulgate,* “with the carrions (<span
id="viii.xiv-p14.3"></span>morticinis) of their idols;” and of the
*Syriac,* “with the sacrifices of their idols.” *Blayney’s* rendering
is, “by the vileness of their odious practices.” The word “carcases” is
derived from the *Targum.* Idolatrous practices are evidently the things
referred to. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_166"></span>[167](cc18007.htm#fr_166.md) <span
id="viii.xvii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p13"></span> Though the word rendered here
“Gentiles” may be often so translated, yet it does not necessarily mean
the heathens. It signifies a people associated together; and it may mean
here the Jewish people in their dispersion, formed into companies or
tribes, as *Grotius* thinks; and a due consideration of the context will
lead us to this opinion. They are spoken of in <span
id="viii.xvii-p13.1"></span>[Jer
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#015.md)<span
id="viii.xvii-p13.1"></span> as “brought from *all the lands”* whither
God had driven them; and as the idolatry of their fathers is continually
mentioned in connection with their own, the confession in this verse
seems appropriate to them; and the last verse, <span
id="viii.xvii-p13.2"></span>[Jer
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#021.md)<span
id="viii.xvii-p13.2"></span>, clearly refers to the people of Israel.
There is nothing in the whole passage (except it be this clause) that
has any reference to the conversion of the heathens. I am aware that
commentators take the same view of this clause with *Calvin,* yet I
fully believe that the “nations” here were the Jews, scattered here and
there, as distinct portions of the community, in various parts of the
heathen world. The prophet, after having received an assurance of a
restoration, makes a thankful acknowledgment to God, and tells us what
would be the confession of the returned exiles, which includes the next
verse. Then God assures him in the last verse, that such would be the
effect of exile as to make them ever afterwards to acknowledge his power
and his majesty, which has been remarkably fulfilled; for the Jews have
never been guilty — of idolatry since their return from Babylon. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_167"></span>[168](cc18007.htm#fr_167.md) <span
id="viii.xviii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xviii-p7"></span> *Calvin* in this instance follows the
*Syriac* version, which is different from all the other ancient
versions, and also the *Targum. Blayney* gives the same meaning with
*Calvin,* which *Horsley* wholly disapproves, and which the Hebrew can
hardly admit. The literal rendering is, —

<span id="viii.xviii-p8"></span>Shall man make for himself gods? But
they are no gods.

<span id="viii.xviii-p9"></span>As the future may often be rendered
potentially, the better version would be this, —

<span id="viii.xviii-p10"></span>Can man make for himself gods When they
are no gods?

<span id="viii.xviii-p11"></span>That is, can he make gods of those who
are not gods? This is, in my view, a continuation of the confession in
the previous verse, which I render as follows, —

<span id="viii.xviii-p12"></span>“Truly, falsehood have our fathers
inherited — vanity, And they had nothing that profited: Can man make for
himself gods, When they are no gods?”

<span id="viii.xviii-p13"></span>“Falsehood” was false religion, the
character of which was “vanity,” an empty and useless thing: and this is
more fully asserted in the next line, which is literally, “And nothing
in them,” or with them, *i.e.,* the fathers, “that was profitable.” —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_168"></span>[169](cc18007.htm#fr_168.md) <span
id="viii.xix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xix-p7"></span> As the captivity and the restoration of
the people are expressly referred to in the previous verses, it seems
necessary to connect here the display of God’s power with both these
events. The restoration was as remarkable an instance of divine
interposition as the captivity, if not more so. And the future effect on
the people’s mind, their preservation from idolatry, is to be ascribed
to the power manifested in their restoration as well as in their
captivity. “Therefore,” at the beginning of the verse, seems to be an
inference from what has been said of the captivity and the restoration;
and this accounts for the repetition of making known to them his power:
God first made known his power in driving them to captivity, and,
secondly, in restoring them, —

<span id="viii.xix-p8"></span>Therefore, behold I make known to them, at
this time, *And* I will make known to them My hand and my power; And
they shall know that my name is Jehovah.

<span id="viii.xix-p9"></span>The *Septuagint* is as follows, —

<span id="viii.xix-p10"></span>Therefore, behold I will manifest to them
at this time my hand, And I will make known to them my power; And they
shall know that my name is the Lord.

<span id="viii.xix-p11"></span>To remove the word “hand” to the first
line has no MS. in its favor; but it shews that they thought that the
two verbs had a similar objective case, and the conjunction “and” is
supplied before the second verb, as it is also in the *Syriac* and
*Arabic.*

<span id="viii.xix-p12"></span>It is probable that by the “hand” is
meant the infliction of punishment, and is rendered “vengeance” in the
*Targum;* and that by “power” or strength is intended what God
manifested in the restoration of the people. The combined influence of
both was to make them to know that God was really Jehovah, the only
supreme, ever the same, true and faithful, without any change. How
remarkably has this prophecy been accomplished! The Jews have ever since
acknowledged Jehovah as the only true God. — *Ed.*
