<span id="v-p1"></span>CHAPTER 13

<span id="v.i"></span>

<span id="v.i-p1"></span><span id="v.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#001.md)<span id="v.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p2"></span>**1**. Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get
thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.

<span id="v.i-p3"></span>**1**. Sic dicit Jehova mihi, Vade et compara
tibi cingulum lineum, et pone illud super renes tuos, et in aquas ne
inferas illud.

<span id="v.i-p4"></span>**2**. So I got a girdle, according to the word
of the LORD, and put *it* on my loins,

<span id="v.i-p5"></span>**2**. Et comparavi mihi cingulum (paravi, ad
verbum) sicuti mandave-rat Jehova, et posui (vel, applicavi) illud ad
renes meos.

<span id="v.i-p6"></span>**3**. And the word of the LORD came unto me
the second time, saying,

<span id="v.i-p7"></span>**3**. Et factus est sermo Jehovae ad me
secundo, dicendo,

<span id="v.i-p8"></span>**4**. Take the girdle that thou hast got,
which *is* upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there
in a hole of the rock.

<span id="v.i-p9"></span>**4**. Tolle cingulum quod comparasti, quod est
super renes tuos, et surge, proficiscere (vel, surgens proficiscere) ad
Euphratem, et absconde illic in foramine petrae.

<span id="v.i-p10"></span>**5**. So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as
the LORD commanded me.

<span id="v.i-p11"></span>**5**. Et profectus sum et abscondi Euphrate,
quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova mihi.

<span id="v.i-p12"></span>**6**. And it came to pass after many days,
that the LORD said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle
from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.

<span id="v.i-p13"></span>**6**. Et accidit post finem (a fine ad
verbum) dierum multorum, et dixit (hoc est, ut diceret) Jehova mihi,
Surge et proficiscere ad Euphratem, et tolle illinc cingulum, de quo
praecepi tibi ut absconderes illic.

<span id="v.i-p14"></span>**7**. Then I went to Euphrates, and digged,
and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the
girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.

<span id="v.i-p15"></span>**7**. Et profectus sum ad Euphratem, et fodi
et sustuli cingulum e loco ubi illic absconderam; et ecce corruptum erat
cingulum, non proderat ad omne (hoc est, ad quicquam)

<span id="v.i-p16"></span>**8**. Then the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,

<span id="v.i-p17"></span>**8**. Et factus est sermo Jehovae ad me,
dicendo,

<span id="v.i-p18"></span>**9**. Thus saith the LORD, After this manner
will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.

<span id="v.i-p19"></span>**9**. Sic dicit Jehova, In hune modum
corrumpam excellentiam Jehudah et excellentiam Jerusalem magnam (vel,
altitudinem)

<span id="v.i-p20"></span> 

<span id="v.i-p21"></span><span id="v.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p22"></span>I have said that there is here a new prophecy;
for the Prophet is said to buy for himself a girdle or a belt, or,
according to some, a truss or breeches; and as mention is made of linen,
this opinion may be probable; but <span id="v.i-p22.1"></span>אזור,
*asur*, means not only the breeches which they then wore, but also a
girdle or belt, according to what Isaiah says, when, speaking
figuratively of Christ’s kingdom, that faithfulness would be the girdle
of his loins. (<span id="v.i-p22.2"></span>[Isa
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#005)<span id="v.i-p22.2"></span>.md) It,
may here, however, be taken for breeches as well as for a girdle.  <span
id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md)

<span id="v.i-p25"></span>As to the matter in hand, it makes no great
difference. The Prophet then is bidden to buy for himself a linen girdle
or a linen breeches, and he is also bidden to go to Euphrates, and to
hide the girdle in a hole. He is again bidden to go the second time to
Euphrates, and to draw the girdle from the hole, and he found it marred.
The application follows; for God declares that he would thus deal with
the Jews; though he had had them as a belt, he would yet cast them away.
As he had adorned them, so he designed them to be an ornament to him;
for the glory of God shines forth in his ChurJeremiah The Jews then, as
Isaiah says, were a crown of glory and a royal diadem in God’s hand.
(<span id="v.i-p25.1"></span>[Isa
62:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa062.htm#003)<span id="v.i-p25.1"></span>.md)
Hence he compares them here most fitly to a belt or a girdle. Though
then their condition was honorable, yet God threatens that he would cast
them away; so that, being hidden, they might contract rottenness in a
cavern of the Euphrates, that is, in Assyria and Chaldea. This is the
meaning of the prophecy.

<span id="v.i-p26"></span>But no doubt a vision is here narrated, and
not a real transaction, as some think, who regard Jeremiah as having
gone there; but what can be imagined more absurd? He was, we know,
continually engaged in his office of a teacher among his own people. Had
he undertaken so long a journey, and that twice, it would have taken him
some months. Hence contentious must he be, who urges the words of the
Prophet, and holds that he must have gone to the Euphrates and hidden
there his girdle. We know that this form of speaking is common and often
used by the prophets: they narrate visions as facts.

<span id="v.i-p27"></span>We must also observe, that God might have
spoken plainly and without any similitude; but as they were not only
ignorant, but also stupid, it was found necessary to reprove their
torpidity by an external symbol. This was the reason why God confirmed
the doctrine of his Prophet by an external representation. Had God said,
“Ye have been to me hitherto as a belt, ye were my ornament and my
glory, not indeed through your merit or worthiness, but because I have
united you to myself, that ye might be a holy people and a priestly
kingdom; but now I am constrained to cast you away; and as a person
throws from him and casts a girdle into some hole, so that after a long
time he finds it rotten, so it will be with you, after having been
hidden a long time beyond Euphrates; ye shall there contract rottenness,
which will mar you altogether, so that your appearance will be very
different, when a remnant of you shall come from thence:” This indeed
might have been sufficient; but in that state of security and dullness
in which we know the Jews were, such a simple statement would not have
so effectually penetrated into their hearts, as when this symbol was
presented to them. The Prophet, therefore, says, that he was girded with
a belt, that the belt was hid in a hole near Euphrates, and that there
it became marred; and then he adds, so shall it be done to you. This
statement, as I have said, more sharply touched the Jews, so that they
saw that the judgment of God was at hand.

<span id="v.i-p28"></span>With regard to the similitude of girdle or
breeches, we know how proudly the Jews gloried in the thought that God
was bound to them; and he would have really been so, had they been in
return faithful to him: but as they had become so disobedient and
ungrateful, how could God be bound to them? He had indeed chosen them to
be a people to himself, but this condition was added, that they were to
be as a chaste wife, as he had become, according to what we have seen, a
husband to them. But they had prostituted themselves and had become
shamefully polluted with idols. As then they had perfidiously departed
from their marriage engagement, was not God freed from his obligations?
according to what is said by Isaiah,

<span id="v.i-p29"></span>“There is no need to give you a bill of
divorcement, for your mother is an adulteress.” (<span
id="v.i-p29.1"></span>[Isa 1:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.i-p29.1"></span>)

<span id="v.i-p30"></span>The Prophet then, in this place, meant in a
few words to shake off from the Jews those vain boastings in which they
indulged, when they said that they were God’s people and the holy seed
of Abraham. “True,” he says, “and I will concede more to you, that you
were to God even as a belt, by which men usually adorn themselves; but
God adopted you, that you might serve him chastely and faithfully; but
now, as ye have made void his covenant, he will cast away this belt,
which is a disgrace to him and not an ornament, and will throw it into a
cavern where it will rot.” Such is the view we are to take of this belt,
as we shall hereafter see more clearly.

<span id="v.i-p31"></span><span id="v.i-p31.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p32"></span>The Prophet, by saying that he went to the
Euphrates, confirms what he had narrated: he did not indeed mean that he
actually went there, but his object was to give the Jews a vivid
representation. It is then what Rhetorians call a scene presented to the
view; though the place is not changed, yet the thing is set before the
eyes by a lively description.  <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) Thus
the Prophet, as the Jews were deaf, exhibited to their view what they
would not hear. This is the reason why he says that he *went.* For the
same purpose is what follows, that at *the end of many days* God had
bidden him to take out the *girdle* Here also is signified the length of
the exile. As to the *hole in a rock,* what is meant is disgrace; for
without honor and esteem the Jews lived in banishment, in the same
manner as though they were cast into a cavern. Hence by the hole is
signified their ignoble and base condition, that they were like persons
removed from the sight of all men and from the common light of day. By
the *end of many days,* is meant, as I have said, the length of their
exile, for in a short time they would not have become putrified, and
except indeed this had been distinctly expressed, they would have never
been convinced of the grievousness of the calamity which was nigh them.
Hence he says that the days would be many, so that they might contract
putridity while hidden in the hole.

<span id="v.i-p34"></span><span id="v.i-p34.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p35"></span>As to the application of the Prophecy, the
Prophet then distinctly describes it; but he sets forth with sufficient
clearness the main point, when he says, *Thus will I mar the stateliness
(*<span id="v.i-p35.1"></span>*altitudinem,* the altitude or height) *of
Judah and the great stateliness of Jerusalem* Other interpreters
unanimously render the word, pride; but as <span
id="v.i-p35.2"></span>גאון *gaun,* may be taken in two senses, it means
here, I have no doubt, excellency, and this will appear more fully from
what follows.  <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) The word then
signifies here that dignity with which God had favored the seed of
Abraham, when he intended them to be an ornament to himself. So it is
said in <span id="v.i-p36.2"></span>[Ex
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#007.md)<span id="v.i-p36.2"></span>,

<span id="v.i-p37"></span>“In thy greatness thou wilt destroy the
nations.”

<span id="v.i-p38"></span>And in Isaiah he says,

<span id="v.i-p39"></span>“I will make thee the excellency of ages.”
(<span id="v.i-p39.1"></span>[Isa
60:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#015)<span id="v.i-p39.1"></span>.md)

<span id="v.i-p40"></span>There no doubt it is to be taken in a good
sense. And these things harmonize together, — that God had prepared the
Jews for himself as a belt, and then that he cast them from him into a
cavern, where they would be for a time without any light and without any
glory.

<span id="v.i-p41"></span>The import of this clause then is, “Though the
dignity of Judah and Jerusalem has been great, (for the people whom God
had adopted were renowned according to what is said in <span
id="v.i-p41.1"></span>[Ps 73](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#000.md)<span
id="v.i-p41.1"></span>) though then the stateliness of Judah and
Jerusalem has been great, yet I *will mar* it.” We see how the Prophet
takes from the Jews that false confidence by which they deceived
themselves. They might indeed have gloried in God, had they acted truly
and from the heart: but when they arrogated all things to themselves,
and deprived God of his authority, whose subjects they were, how great
was their vanity and folly, and how ridiculous always to profess his
sacred name, and to say, We are God’s people? for he was no God to them,
as they esteemed him as nothing; nay, they disdainfully and
reproachfully rejected his yoke. We hence see that the word <span
id="v.i-p41.2"></span>גאון *gaun,* is to be taken here in a good sense.
The Prophet at the same time reproachfully taunts them, that they abused
the name of God and falsely pretended to be his people and heritage. The
rest we cannot finish; we shall go on with the subject to-morrow.

<span id="v.ii"></span>

<span id="v.ii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="v.ii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as so many of the
people who have been gathered by thee, that they might be the body of
thine only-begotten Son, have fallen away, and have by their ingratitude
alienated themselves from the hope of eternal salvation, — O grant, that
they may again at this day be united together, and hold with us the true
unity of faith, so that with one heart and one mouth we may profess thee
as our God and Father, and so learn to swear by thy name, that we may
acknowledge thee as our Judge, and ascribe to thee all power over us,
until we shall at length enjoy that eternal inheritance, into the hope
of which thou hast called us and daily invitest; us, through Christ
Jesus our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="v.iii-p1"></span>Lecture Fifty-Second

<span id="v.iv"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p1"></span><span id="v.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#010.md)<span id="v.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p2"></span>**10**. This evil people, which refuse to hear
my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after
other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this
girdle, which is good for nothing.

<span id="v.iv-p3"></span>**10**. Populus hic malus  <span
id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) renuentes audire verba mea, ambulantes in
pravitate cordis sui; et ambulant post deos alienos ut serviant ipsis et
adorent ipsos; eterunt (*collectivum nomen populi est singulare*)
tanquam baltheus hic, quiad nihilum prodest (*qui ad quiquam non est
utilis*)

<span id="v.iv-p7"></span> 

<span id="v.iv-p8"></span><span id="v.iv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p9"></span>The Prophet said, according to what we
observed yesterday, that the people would be like the belt which he had
hidden in a hole and found putrified: but now the cause is expressed why
God had resolved to treat them with so much severity. He then says that
he would be an avenger, because the Jews had refused to obey his voice,
and preferred their own inventions in *walking after the hardness,* or
the wickedness *of their own heart* We hence see that the cause of this
calamity was, that the people had rejected the teaching of the prophets.
This indeed was far more grievous than if they had fallen away through
mistake or ignorance, as we often see that men go miserably astray when
the teaching of the truth is taken away. But when God shews the way, and
prescribes what is right, when by his servants he exhorts his people, it
is an inexcusable hardness if men repudiate such a kindness. But as this
subject has been elsewhere largely treated, I shall only touch on it now
briefly.

<span id="v.iv-p10"></span>We see then that God threatens his people
with extreme calamity, because they would not. bear to be taught by his
prophets. Then he adds, that they had *walked after the wickedness of
their own heart,* and had *walked after foreign gods* He in the first
place complains that they had been so refractory as to prefer to obey
their own impious inclinations than to be ruled by good and salutary
counsels. But it was necessary to specify their crime; for had the
Prophet only spoken of their hardness, they might have had their
objections ready at hand; but when he said that they had walked after
foreign gods, there was no longer any room for evasion. The word to walk
has a reference to a way. This metaphor has indeed a relation to
something else; for men are not wont to take a course without going
somewhere, we must therefore have some end in view when we walk along
any way. Now, there is to be understood here a contrast, that the people
despised the way pointed out to them by God, and that they had preferred
to follow their own errors. God was ready to guide the Jews; by his own
law; but they chose rather, as I have said, to abandon themselves to
their own errors, as it were designedly.

<span id="v.iv-p11"></span>He says, that they had walked after alien
gods, *that they might serve them, and prostrate themselves before
them;* for such is the meaning of the last verb. The Prophet no doubt
repeats the same thing, for to serve is not only to obey, but also to
worship. And hence is refuted that folly of the Papists, who imagine
that worship *(duliam)* is not inconsistent with true religion; for they
say that service *(latriam)* is due only to God, but that worship may be
given to angels, to statues, or to dead men, as though God, forsooth! in
condemning superstitions, did not use the word <span
id="v.iv-p11.1"></span>עבד *obed,* to serve. It hence follows that it is
extremely ridiculous to devise two sorts of worship, one peculiar to
God, and another common to angels as well as to men and dead idols. We
now understand the import of this verse: the Prophet draws this
conclusion, that the Jews would become like a useless or a putrefied
belt. It afterwards follows —

<span id="v.v"></span>

<span id="v.v-p1"></span><span id="v.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#011.md)<span id="v.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.v-p2"></span>**11**. For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins
of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel
and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me
for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but
they would not hear.

<span id="v.v-p3"></span>**11**. Quia sicut adhaeret (vel, conjunctus
est) baltheus renibus viri, sic conjunxeram (vel, conjunxi) mihi totam
domuni Israel, et totam domum Jehudah, dicit Jehova, ut esset mihi in
populum et in nomen et in laudem et in decus; et non audierunt.

<span id="v.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.v-p5"></span><span id="v.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.v-p6"></span>He confirms what we noticed yesterday, — that
the Jews entertained a foolish confidence, and promised themselves
perpetual happiness, because God had chosen them as his people. This
indeed would have been a perpetual glory to them, had they not violated
their pledged faith; but their defection rendered void God’s covenant as
far as they were concerned: for though God never suffered his
faithfulness to fail, however false and perfidious they were, yet the
adoption from which they had departed availed them nothing. But as they
thought it an unalienable defense, the Prophet again repeats that they
had been indeed adorned with singular gifts, but that, as they had not
remained faithful, they would be deprived of them.

<span id="v.v-p7"></span>He indeed says, by way of concession, *As a
belt cleaves to the loins of man, so also have I joined to myself the
house of Israel;* for given to them is what they claimed. But at the
same time, he reminds them that they only swelled with wind; for the
less tolerable was their impiety, because they were so ungrateful to
God. What, indeed, could have been more base or less excusable, than
when those whom God had favored with so much honor rejected his bounty?
Jeremiah then concedes to them what they proudly boasted of; but he
retorts it on their own heads, and shews how they deserved a heavier
judgment, as they had despised so many of God’s blessings.

<span id="v.v-p8"></span>We said yesterday that. the people is elsewhere
compared to a crown and a diadem, as though God had declared that
nothing was more precious to him than the children of Abraham. But the
same thing is now expressed in other words, — that he had prepared them
for himself as a girdle, that they *might be his people* This was indeed
a great dignity; but what follows exceeds it, — that they might be to me
a name, that is, that I might be celebrated by them; for it was his will
to be called the God of Israel. What likeness there is between God and
men! And yet, as though descending from his celestial glory, he united
to himself the seed of Abraham, that he might also bind them to himself.
The election of God was therefore like a bond of mutual union, so that
he might not be separated from his people. Hence he says that they had
been thus joined to him, that they might be for a *name,* and also for
*a praise and glory*  <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) Though these
words are nearly of the same meaning, yet no doubt they are put together
for the sake of amplification. God, therefore, intended to exaggerate
more fully the sin of the people, by saying that he had done so much for
them, in order that he might be celebrated by them, and that his praise
and his glory might dwell among them.

<span id="v.v-p10"></span>He at last adds, *They have not heard* Had God
only commanded what he might have justly required, not to obey his
authority would have been an inexcusable wickedness in the people; but
as he had so freely offered himself and all other things to them, what a
base and detestable ingratitude it was in them to reject blessings so
many and so valuable? We hence see that the mouths of the Jews are here
completely closed, so that they could not expostulate with God, and
complain that he was too rigid, for they had in an extreme degree
provoked his wrath, having not only rejected his yoke, but also refused
his offered favors. It follows —

<span id="v.vi"></span>

<span id="v.vi-p1"></span><span id="v.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#012.md)<span id="v.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.vi-p2"></span>**12** Therefore thou shalt speak unto them
this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be
filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know
that every bottle shall be filled with wine?

<span id="v.vi-p3"></span>**12**. Dices etiam illis (hoc est,
annuntiabis) hunc sermonem, Sic dicit Jehova, Deus Israel, Omnis lagena
(alii vertunt, utrem, sed hoc loco parum interest, omnis ergo lagena)
implebitur vino: et dicent tibi, An non sciendo scimus (hoc est, An
nesciendo non scimus) quod omnis lagena implebitur vino?

<span id="v.vi-p4"></span>**13**. Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus
saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land,
even the kings that sit upon David’s throne, and the priests, and the
prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.

<span id="v.vi-p5"></span>**13**. Tunc dices illis, Sic dicit Jehova,
Ecce ego implens (vel, impleo) omnes habitatores terrae hujus, et omnes
reges qui sedent pro Davidae super solium ejus, et sacerdotes et
prophetas, et omnes incolas Jerosolymae ebrietate.

<span id="v.vi-p6"></span>**14**. And I will dash them one against
another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will
not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.

<span id="v.vi-p7"></span>**14**. Et collidam eos (alii vertunt,
dispergam; proprie significat violenter disjicere; hic apte reddetur
collidere; collidam ergo) quenque ad fratrem suum et patres et filios
simul, dicit Jehova; non parcam et non ero propitius, (idem significant,
sunt synonyma) et non miserabor a perdendo (hoc est, quin perdam) ipsos.

<span id="v.vi-p8"></span> 

<span id="v.vi-p9"></span><span id="v.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="v.vi-p10"></span>The Prophet denounces here by another
similitude the vengeance of God, for he says that all would be *filled
with drunkenness:* but he is bidden at first simply to set before *them*
the metaphor, *Every bottle*, or flagon, he says, *shall be filled with
wine* The word <span id="v.vi-p10.1"></span>רבל, *ubel,* means a
bladder; but the word bottle is more suitable here.  <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) Bladders were wont in those countries to
be filled with water and with wine, as the custom is still in the east;
as we see at this day that oil is put in bladders and thus carried, so
bladders are commonly used there to carry water and wine; but as it is
added, *I will dash them against one another,* it is better to use the
word bottles, or flagons.

<span id="v.vi-p12"></span>This general statement might have appeared to
be of no weight; for what instruction does this contain, “Every bottle
shall be filled with wine?” It is like what one might say, — that a
tankard is made to carry wine, and that bowls are made for drinking:
this is well known, even to children. And then it might have been said
that this was unworthy of a prophet. “Eh! what dost thou say? Thou
sayest that bottles are the receptacles of wine, even as a hat is made
to cover the head, or clothes to keep off the cold; but thou seemest to
mock us with childish trifles.” We also find that the Prophet’s address
was thus objected to, for they contemptuously and proudly answered,
“What! do we not know that bottles are prepared for the purpose of
preserving wine? But what dost thou mean? Thou boastest of the
inspiration of the Holy Spirit: how strange is this? Thou art, like an
angel come down from heaven; thou pretendest the name of God, and
professest to have the authority of a prophet; now, what does this mean,
that bottles are filled with wine?” But it was God’s particular object
thus to rouse the people, who were asleep in their delusions, and who
were also by no means attentive to spiritual instruction. It was then
his purpose to shew, by the most trifling, and as it were by frivolous
things, that they were not possessed of so much clear-sightedness as to
perceive even that which was most evident. They indeed, all knew that
bottles were made for wine; but they did not understand that they were
the bottles, or were like bottles. We have indeed said that they were
inflated with so much arrogance that they seemed like hard rocks; and
hence was their contempt of all threatenings, because they did not
consider what they were. The Prophet then says that they were like
bottles; though God had indeed chosen them for an excellent use, yet,
forgetful of their frailty, they had marred their own excellency, so
that they were no longer of any use, except that God would inebriate
them with giddiness and also with calamities.

<span id="v.vi-p13"></span>We hence see why God had commanded a general
truth to be here announced which was received with indifference and
contempt; it was, that an opportunity might be given to the Prophet to
touch to the quick those stupid men to whom their own state was wholly
unknown. It had been said that they were like mountains, because they
had as their foundation the free election of God; but as they had in
them no firmness and no constancy of faith, but had decayed, their glory
had as it were melted away; and though they still retained an outward
appearance, yet they were like brittle vessels; and so their fragility
is here better expressed by the Prophet than if, in a plain sentence, he
had said, “As a bottle is filled with wine, so will the Lord fill you
with drunkenness.” Had he thus spoken, there would not have been so much
force in the prediction; but when they answered with disdain, “This is
known even to children,” they were then told what more sensibly touched
them, — that they were like bottles.  <span
id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md)

<span id="v.vi-p15"></span><span id="v.vi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="v.vi-p16"></span>It may now be asked, What was this
drunkenness which the Prophet announces? It may be understood in two
ways, — either that God would give them up to a reprobate mind, — or
that he would make them drunk with evils and calamities; for when God
deprives men of a right mind, it is to prepare them for extreme
vengeance. But the Prophet seems to have something further in view —
that this people would be given up to the most grievous evils, which
would wholly fill them with amazement. Yet it appears from the context
that the former evil is intended here; for he says, *I will dash them
one against another, every one against his brother, even the fathers and
sons together;* and thus they were all to be broken as it were in
pieces. God then not only points out the calamity which was nigh the
Jews, but also the manner of it; that is, that every one would draw his
own brethren to ruin, as though they inflicted wounds on one another.
But God says first generally, *I will fill all the inhabitants of the
land with drunkenness,* and then he explains the effect, such as I have
stated.

<span id="v.vi-p17"></span>But he afterwards speaks of the whole people,
including the *kings, priests,* and *prophets,* so that he excepts no
order of men, however honorable; and this express mention of different
orders was altogether necessary, for kings thought that they ought not
to have been blended with the common people. The priests also regarded
themselves as sacred, and a similar pride possessed the false prophets.
But Jeremiah includes them all, without exception, in the same bundle,
as though he had said, — “The majesty of kings shall not deliver them
from God’s judgment, nor shall the priests be safe on account of their
dignity, nor shall it avail the false prophets to boast of that noble
and illustrious office which they discharge.” This prediction was no
doubt regarded as very unjust; for we know with what high commendations
God had spoken of the kingdom of David. As to the priesthood, we also
know that it was a type of the priesthood of Christ, and also that the
whole tribe of Levi was counted sacred to God. It could not therefore be
but that Jeremiah must have greatly exasperated the minds of all by thus
threatening kings as well as priests.

<span id="v.vi-p18"></span>But we hence gather, — that there is nothing
so high and so illustrious on earth, which ought not to be made to
submit, when the power and glory of God, and the authority of celestial
truth, are to be vindicated. Whatever then is precious and excellent in
the world must come to nothing, if it derogates even in the least degree
from the glory of God or from the authority of his truth: and yet kings
and priests dared to oppose the word of God. No wonder then, that the
Prophet should thrust them down from their elevations and compare them
to bottles: he thus treads under foot that frail glory by which they
sought to obscure God himself. And as the name of David was, as it were,
sacred among that people, in order to shake off this vain confidence,
the Prophet says, — “Though kings sit on the throne of David and be his
successors and posterity, yet God will not spare them.”  <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) And hence also it appears how foolishly
the Papal clergy at this day bring forward against us their privileges
and their dignity. Doubtless, whatever these unprincipled men may claim
for themselves, they cannot yet make themselves equal to the Levitical
priests: and yet we see that it availed them nothing, that God had set
them apart for himself, because they had abused their power. There is,
therefore, no reason for the Pope and his clergy, the very filth of the
world, to be at this day so proud. We now perceive the design of the
words, when mention is made of kings, priests, and prophets.

<span id="v.vi-p22"></span>It must, however, be observed, that, he does
not speak here of faithful prophets, but of those who wore the mask,
while yet they brought nothing but chaff instead of wheat, as we shall
hereafter see. He then uses the word prophets in an improper sense, for
he applies it to false teachers, as we do at this day, when we speak of
those savages who boast that they are bishops and prelates and
governors: we indeed concede to them these titles, but it does not
follow that they justly deserve to be counted bishops, though they are
so called. In the same way then does Jeremiah speak here of those who
were called prophets, who yet were wholly unworthy of the office.

<span id="v.vi-p23"></span>He then speaks of the collision to which we
have referred, — I will cause them to *tear* or break *one another* in
pieces. Some render the word “scatter;” but scattering does by no means
comport with the words, *every one, against his brother,* etc.  <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) We hence see that the meaning is much
more suitable when we render the words, I *will dash them, every one
against his brother,* and then, *even the fathers and the sons
together;* so that they might tear one another by a mutual conflict. And
hence, as I have said, Jeremiah not only foretells the destruction of
the people, but also points out the manner of it; for they would become
so void of common prudence, that they would willfully destroy one
another, as though they were given up to mutual slaughter. They gloried,
we know, in their number, but the Prophet shews that this would be no
protection to them, but, on the contrary, the cause of their ruin; for
the Lord would so blind them, that they would fight with one another,
and thus perish without any foreign enemy.

<span id="v.vi-p27"></span>He then adds, *I will not spare, I will not
spare,*  <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) *I will not have mercy* He
repeats three times that he would not be propitious to them. It would
have been sufficient to declare this once, were they so teachable and
attentive as really to consider the threatenings announced to them; but
being so torpid as they were, it was necessary to repeat the same thing
often; not as though there was anything ambiguous or obscure in the
message itself, but because hardly any vehemence was sufficient to rouse
hearts so obstinate. We hence see why the Prophet repeated the same
thing so often. He, however, does not employ words uselessly: whenever
God repeats the promises of his favor, he does not utter words
heedlessly and without reason; but since he sees that there is in us so
much dulness, that one promise is not sufficient, he confirms it by
repetitions; so also when he sees that men, owing to their stupidity,
cannot be moved nor terrified by his threatenings, he repeats them, that
they may have more weight. He in short declares, that it was all over
with that people, so that he does not now call the wicked and the
rebellious to repentance, but speaks to them as to men past remedy. This
is the meaning.

<span id="v.vi-p31"></span>And he adds, *Until I shall consume them*
 <span id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) This refers to the whole body of
the people. God, in the meantime, still preserved, in a wonderful manner
and by hidden means, a remnant, as it has appeared elsewhere: but yet
God took that vengeance, which is here denounced on the people as a
body; for it was as it were a general death, when they were all driven
into exile and everywhere scattered. Now as the Lord in so great a ruin
never forgot his covenant, but some seed still remained safe and secure;
so what is said here, *I will not have mercy until I shall consume
them,* is not inconsistent with the promise of mercy elsewhere given,
when he declares that he is long-suffering and plenteous in mercy.
(<span id="v.vi-p34.2"></span>[Nu

<span id="v.vi-p34.3"></span>[Ps
103:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#008)<span id="v.vi-p34.3"></span>.md)
Though God then destroyed his people in so dreadful a manner, yet he did
not divest himself of his own nature, nor cast away his mercy; but he
executed his judgments on the reprobate in a way so wonderful, that he
yet lost nothing of his eternal mercy and remained still faithful as to
his election. It follows —

<span id="v.vii"></span>

<span id="v.vii-p1"></span><span id="v.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah

<span id="v.vii-p6"></span> 

<span id="v.vii-p7"></span><span id="v.vii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.vii-p8"></span>The Prophet shews here more fully what we
have stated, — that so refractory was the temper of those with whom he
had to do, that it was necessary to use various means to subdue them.
And it was not in vain that he added this exhortation, which manifests
indignation; nor was it without displeasure that he required a hearing,
*Hear ye, and give ear; be not lifted up, for the Lord is he who speaks*
Then we may hence gather, either that Jeremiah was derided, or that his
words were disregarded by the Jews; for this is intimated by the words,
*For Jehovah has spoken;*  <span id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) for were
they of themselves persuaded, that he announced what God had commanded
him, these words would have been used to no purpose. But we shall
elsewhere see, that he was deemed an impostor, and that he was assailed
by many reproofs and curses.

<span id="v.vii-p10"></span>He therefore defends here his calling from
their calumnies and reproaches, when he says, that God had spoken; for
by these words he affirms that he brought nothing of his own, but spoke
as it were from the mouth of God, or, which is the same thing, that he
was the instrument of the Holy Spirit; and he said this, in order that
they might know that they in vain contended with him, as the contest was
between them and God. And on this account he says, *Hear ye, and give
ear;* for he saw that they were deaf and torpid, and had need of many
stimulants. He at the same time points out the cause and the source of
evil by saying, *Be ye not lifted up*  <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) The cause then of their contumacy was
pride, for they dared to quarrel with God. So also the main principle of
obedience is humility, that is, when men acknowledge that they are
nothing and ascribe to God what is due to him.

<span id="v.viii"></span>

<span id="v.viii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="v.viii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we are by
nature frail vessels, and our frailty is such that we of ourselves melt
away, and when we become stronger we cannot stand by our own power, — O
grant, that being supported by thy power, we may indeed rejoice in the
perpetuity of our salvation, not indeed relying on any earthly
protection, but because thou hast been pleased to choose us as thy
people: and may we at the same time so pursue the course of our life,
that we may not by our perfidy exclude thy grace from us, but give place
to thee, that we may be more and more enriched by those gifts which
pertain to the hope of a future life, until we shall at length come to
that full and perfect happiness, in thy celestial kingdom, which is laid
up for us by Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="v.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.x-p5"></span><span id="v.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.x-p6"></span>Jeremiah pursues the subject, which we began to
explain yesterday, for he saw that the Jews were but little moved by
what he taught them. He bid them. to regard what he said as coming from
God, and told them that they could by no means succeed by their pride.
For the same purpose he now adds, *Give glory to Jehovah your God* To
give glory to God is elsewhere taken for confessing the truth in his
name; for when Joshua abjured Achan, he used these words, “Give glory to
God, my son;” that is, As I have set God before you as a judge, beware
lest you should think that if you lie you can escape his judgment.
(<span id="v.x-p6.1"></span>[Jos
7:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#019)<span id="v.x-p6.1"></span>.md) But
here, to give glory to God, is the same as to ascribe to him what
properly belongs to him, or to acknowledge his power so as to be
submissive to his word: for if we deny faith to the prophets; we rob God
of his glory, as we thus disown his power, and, as far as we can,
diminish his glory. How indeed can we ascribe glory to God except by
acknowledging him to be the fountain of all wisdom, justice, and power,
and especially by trembling at his sacred word? Whosoever then does not
fear and reverence God, whosoever does not believe his word, he robs him
of his glory. We hence see that all the unbelieving, though they may
testify the contrary by their mouths, are yet in reality enemies to
God’s glory and deprive him of it.

<span id="v.x-p7"></span>This subject ought to be carefully noticed; for
all ought to dread such a sacrilege as this, and yet there is no one who
takes sufficient heed in this respect. We then see what instruction this
expression conveys; it is as though he had said, that the Jews had
hitherto acted contemptuously towards God, for they trembled not before
him, as they had no faith in his word: and that it was now time for him
to set God before them as their Judge, and also for them to know that
they ought to have believed whatever God declared to them by his
servants.

<span id="v.x-p8"></span>He says, *Before he introduces darkness* Others
render it by a single word, “Before it grows dark,” but as the verb is
in Hiphil, it ought to be taken in a causative sense. Some consider the
word sun to be understood, but without reason; for the sun is not said
to send darkness by its setting. But the Prophet removes all ambiguity
by the words which immediately follow in the second clause*, And turn
light to the shadow of death,* and *turn it to thick darkness* In these
words the Prophet no doubt refers to God, so that the word God, used at
the beginning of the verse, is to be understood here.  <span
id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md)

<span id="v.x-p10"></span>*Before* God, he then says, *sends darkness,
and before your feet stumble on the mountains of obscurity* The word
<span id="v.x-p10.1"></span>נשף, *neshiph,* means the evening and the
twilight; it means also the obscure light before the rising of the sun;
but it is often taken for the whole night. We can render the words, “the
mountains of density.” But the word, no doubt, means here obscurity.
Some think that mountains are to be here taken metaphorically for Egypt;
for the Jews were wont to flee there in their troubles. But there are
safer recesses on mountains than on the plains; yet I know not whether
this sense will be very suitable here. On the contrary, I prefer to
regard the words as preceded by <span id="v.x-p10.2"></span>כ, *caph,* a
particle of likeness, which is often understood, and the meaning would
be thus suitable, “Before your feet stumble as on obscure mountains:”
for there is more light on level grounds than on mountains, for darkness
often fills narrow passes: the sun cannot penetrate there; and also the
evening does not come on so soon on plains as in the recesses of
mountains; for the Prophet refers not to the summits but to the narrow
valleys, which receive not the oblique rays of the sun but for a few
hours. But what if we give this rendering? “Before your feet stumble at
the mountains of darkness;” for <span id="v.x-p10.3"></span>אל, *al,*
has the meaning of *at,*  <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md) as though
the Prophet had said, that the darkness would be so thick that they
could not discern mountains opposite them. As in the twilight or in
darkness a traveler stumbles at the smallest stones, so also, when the
darkness is very thick, even mountains are not perceived. It thus often
happens that a person stumbles at mountains, and finds by his feet and
his hands a stumblingblock before he perceives it by his eyes. As to
myself, I wholly think that this is the right explanation, *Before* then
*your feet stumble at the dark mountains*

<span id="v.x-p17"></span>He afterwards adds, *When ye hope for light,
he turns it to the shadow of death* The word <span
id="v.x-p17.1"></span>צלמות, *tsalmut,* as I have said elsewhere, is
thought by grammarians to be composed of <span id="v.x-p17.2"></span>צל
*tsal, “shadow,”* and of <span id="v.x-p17.3"></span>מות *mut,* which
means “death,” and they render it “fatal darkness.” Then what he says
is, “Before God turns light to darkness, turns it to thick darkness,
give to him his glory.” And. hence we perceive more clearly what I have
already referred to, that the verb <span id="v.x-p17.4"></span>יחשיך,
*icheshik,* “will cause darkness,” ought to be applied to God.

<span id="v.x-p18"></span>But the sum of the whole is this, that they
could anticipate God’s judgment by admitting him in time as their Judge,
and also by receiving his word with more reverence than they had
previously done. At the same time he declares that their hope was vain
if they promised themselves light. But we must know that light is here
to be taken metaphorically, as in many other places, and darkness also,
its opposite, is to be so taken. Darkness means adversities, and light,
peace and prosperity. The Prophet then says that the Jews deceived
themselves, if they thought that their happiness would be perpetual, if
they despised God and his prophets; and why? because it would have been
the same as to disarm or to deprive him of his power, as though he was
not the Judge of the world. He in short shews, that there was nigh at
hand a most dreadful vengeance, except the Jews in time anticipated it
and submitted themselves to God. It now follows —

<span id="v.xi"></span>

<span id="v.xi-p1"></span><span id="v.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#017.md)<span id="v.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.xi-p2"></span>**17** But if ye will not hear it, my soul
shall weep in secret places for *your* pride; and mine eye shall weep
sore, and run down with tears, because the LORD’S flock is carried away
captive.

<span id="v.xi-p3"></span>**17** Quod si non audieritis hoc, in areanis
(hoc est, in secreto) lugebit anima mea a facie superbia (hoc est,
propter superbiam) et lachrymando lachrymabitur, et descendet oculus
meus in lachrymas (de hac locutione vidimut cap. 9; diffluet ergo oculus
meus in lachrymae; ad verbum, et descendet oculus meus lachryma) quoniam
abductus est (captus est) grex Jehovae.

<span id="v.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.xi-p5"></span><span id="v.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xi-p6"></span>The Prophet had indirectly threatened them;
but yet there was some hope of pardon, provided the Jews anticipated
God’s judgment in time and humbled themselves before him. He now
declares more clearly that a most certain destruction was nigh at hand,
*If ye will not hear,* he says, *weep will my soul in secret* But much
weight is in what the Prophet intimates, that he would cease to address
them, as though he had said, “I have not hitherto left off to exhort
you, for God has so commanded me; but there will be no remedy, if ye as
usual harden yourselves against what I teach you. There remains then
nothing now for me, except to hide myself in some secret place and there
to mourn; for my prophetic office among you is at an end, as ye are
unworthy of such a favor from God.”

<span id="v.xi-p7"></span>He does not state simply, *If ye will not
hear,* but he adds a pronoun, this, *If ye will not hear this,* or it:
for the Jews might have raised an objection and said, that they were not
disobedient to God, and had prophets among them, as it appeared
yesterday; for there were those who deceived them by their flatteries.
The Prophet then does not speak indistinctly, for that would have had no
effect; but he expressly declares that they were to hear what he had
said in the last verse: “Except then,” he says, “ye give glory to God, I
will leave you or bid you farewell, and will hide myself in some corner,
and there bewail your miseries.” When the Prophet said that nothing
remained for him but weeping, he intimated that it was all over with
them, and that their salvation was hopeless. The sum of the whole is,
that they were not to be always favored with that which they were now
despising, that is, to be warned by God’s servants; for if they
continued to despise all the prophets, God would withdraw such a favor
from them.

<span id="v.xi-p8"></span>The Prophet at the same time shows with what
feelings he exercised his prophetic office; for though he knew that he
was to perform, the part of an herald, and boldly to denounce on the
Jews the calamity which we have observed; he yet ever felt so much pity
in his soul, that he bewailed that perverseness which would prove their
ruin. The Prophet then connected the two feelings together, so that with
a bold and intrepid spirit he denounced vengeance on the Jews, and at
the same time he felt commiseration and sympathy.

<span id="v.xi-p9"></span>He then mentions the cause, *For taken captive
is the flock of Jehovah* Jeremiah might have had indeed a regard also
for his own blood. When, therefore, he saw the nation from which he
himself sprung miserably perishing, he could not but mourn for their
ruin: but he had an especial regard to the favor of God, as was the case
also with Paul, (<span id="v.xi-p9.1"></span>[Rom.
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#002.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005)<span id="v.xi-p9.1"></span>.md) for
though he refers to his descent from the Israelites, and assigns this as
a reason why he wished to be an anathema from Christ on their account,
there were yet other reasons why he spoke highly of them; for he
afterwards adds, that the covenant was theirs, that they derived their
origin from the fathers, that from them Christ came according to the
flesh, who is God, blessed for ever. Paul then so honored and valued the
benefits with which the Jews were adorned, that he wished as it were to
die for their salvation, and even wished to be an anathema from Christ.
There is not the least doubt but Jeremiah for a similar reason adds now,
that he would seek retirement or some hidden place where he might bewail
the destruction of his people, for it was the *flock of Jehovah*  <span
id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) We hence see that it was God’s covenant
that made him to shed tears, for he saw that in a manner it failed
through the fault of the people. It follows —

<span id="v.xii"></span>

<span id="v.xii-p1"></span><span id="v.xii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#018.md)<span id="v.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.xii-p2"></span>**18** Say unto the king and to the queen,
Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down,
*even* the crown of your glory.

<span id="v.xii-p3"></span>**18** Dic regi et dominae, humiliamini
(descendite) sedete (hoc est, jacete) quia descendet a capitibus vestris
corona decoris vestri (alii vertunt, sescendet altitudines vestrae, pro
altitudo vestra; et appositive legunt quod sequitur, corona decoris
vestri)

<span id="v.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.xii-p5"></span><span id="v.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xii-p6"></span>The Prophet is here bidden to address his
discourse directly to King Jehoiakim and his mother; for the term lady
is not to be taken for the queen, the wife of Jehoiakim, but for his
mother, who was then his associate in the kingdom, and possessed great
authority.  <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) And there is no doubt
but that God thus intended to rouse more fully the community in general;
that is, by shewing that he would not spare, no, not the king nor the
queen. But we may hence also learn what has already been observed, that
the truth announced by the prophets is superior to all the greatness of
the world. For it was said before to Jeremiah, “Reprove mountains and
rebuke hills;”  <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) and still farther,

<span id="v.xii-p10"></span>“Behold, I have set thee over kingdoms and
nations, to pull down and to pluck up,” etc., (<span
id="v.xii-p10.1"></span>[Jer 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md)<span
id="v.xii-p10.1"></span>)

<span id="v.xii-p11"></span>This ought to be carefully noticed; for
kings and those who are eminent in the world, think that they are not
only, by a singular privilege, exempt from all laws, but also free from
every obligation to observe modesty and to avoid shame. Hence it is,
that they from their elevation despise God and his prophets. Here God
shews, that he supplied the prophets with his word for this end, — that
they might close their eyes to all the splendor of the world, and shew
no respect of persons, but pull down every height, and bring to order
everything that is elevated in this world. Paul also teaches us, that
ministers of the gospel are endued with this power;

<span id="v.xii-p12"></span>“Given to us,” he says, “is power against
every height that exalteth itself against Christ.”  
(<span id="v.xii-p12.2"></span>[2Co
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005)<span id="v.xii-p12.2"></span>.md)

<span id="v.xii-p13"></span>And hence we must observe, that all who are
chosen to the office of teaching, cannot faithfully discharge their duty
except they boldly, and with intrepid spirit, dare to reprove both kings
and queens; for the word of God is not to be restricted to the common
people or men in humble life, but it subjects to itself all, from the
least to the greatest. This prophecy was no doubt very bitter to the
king as well as to the common people; but it behooved Jeremiah to
discharge faithfully his office; and this was also necessary, for the
king Jehoiakim and his mother thought that they could not possibly be
dethroned.

<span id="v.xii-p14"></span>He therefore bids them to *descend* and *to
lie down;* that is, he bids them to forget their ancient greatness. He
does not simply exhort them to repent, but shews, that as they had been
so refractory in their pride, the punishment of disgrace was nigh at
hand, for the Lord would with a strong hand lay them prostrate. It is
not then an exhortation that the Prophet gives; but he only foretells
what they little thought of, — that they in vain flattered themselves,
for the Lord would in a short time expose them to reproach by casting
them down.

<span id="v.xii-p15"></span>And this is evident from what is added, *For
descend shall the crown of your honor;* that is, it shall be taken away
from your highnesses, or from your eminencies, or from your heads; for
the word <span id="v.xii-p15.1"></span>ראשה, *rashe,* means sometimes
the head.  <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) But some think that it
means here eminencies, and that “the magnificent crown” is put here in
apposition.

<span id="v.xii-p20"></span>I have omitted, if I mistake not, to notice
one thing; that is, the pride mentioned by the Prophet; *except ye hear,
weep will my soul in secret on account of pride* Interpreters render it
“your pride;” that is, the pride with which the Jews were filled; but I
am inclined to take a different view, that the Prophet speaks here of
the pride or the great power of those enemies whom the Jews then did not
in any degree fear. “Since then,” says the Prophet, “ye are so secure, I
will retire and weep by myself, and my soul by mourning shall mourn,
yea, my eye shall flow down with tears, on account of the pride of the
enemies, who are now so much despised by you;” Let us now proceed —

<span id="v.xiii"></span>

<span id="v.xiii-p1"></span><span id="v.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#019.md)<span id="v.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.xiii-p2"></span>**19** The cities of the south shall be shut
up, and none shall open *them*: Judah shall be carried away captive all
of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive.

<span id="v.xiii-p3"></span>**19** Urbes Austri clausae sunt, et nemo
qui aperiat; traductus est (vel, transmigravit) Jehudah totus,
translatus est perfecte (perfectione, hoc est, in totum abductus est in
captivitatem)

<span id="v.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.xiii-p5"></span><span id="v.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xiii-p6"></span>By the *cities of the south,* almost all
understand the cities of the tribe of Judah, whose portion was towards
the south; and by the cities being shut up, they consider that what is
meant is, that they would be forsaken; for they say, that cities are
open when they are frequented. But I am con- strained here also to take
another view. I take the cities of the south to have been those of
Egypt; for we know that the Jews looked there for a refuge, whenever
they were attacked by the Assyrians or the Chaldeans. Since then they
thought that Egypt would be to them a sort of an asylum, the Prophet
declares that all these cities would be closed against them, and that
there would be no one to open them; as though he had said, “The Lord
will drive you out, and will prevent you to take refuge there.”

<span id="v.xiii-p7"></span>He would doubtless have spoken more clearly
had he meant the cities of Judah; and besides, as he was at Jerusalem,
this way of speaking must have been ambiguous, and even improper; and we
shall find him presently speaking of the Assyrians as being in the
north. He now then warns them, that Egypt would be closed against them,
though they at the same time expected that they would be safe there, and
that an easily-borne exile was in their power. As then they foolishly
trusted that they would be received by the Egyptians, the Prophet says,
that the gates would be closed, and that there would be no one to open
them. It then follows, *carried away wholly has been Judah, carried away
completely;*  <span id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) that is, “Ye shall
all be led away into Assyria and Babylon;” which is the north country,
according to what afterwards follows, —

<span id="v.xiv"></span>

<span id="v.xiv-p1"></span><span id="v.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#020.md)<span id="v.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.xiv-p2"></span>**20** Lift up your eyes, and behold them
that come from the north: where *is* the flock *that* was given thee,
thy beautiful flock?

<span id="v.xiv-p3"></span>**20** Levate oculos vestros, et aspicite
venientesab aquilone: ubigrex qui datus fuerat tibi? Oves decoris tui?

<span id="v.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.xiv-p5"></span><span id="v.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xiv-p6"></span>We here see that Egypt and Chaldea are set in
opposition, the one to the other; as though the Prophet had said,
“Whenever anything is said to you about the Chaldeans, ye turn your eyes
to Egypt, as though that would be a quiet residence for you; but God
will prevent you from having any escape there. Now *see,* see your
enemies who are coming from another quarter, even from Chaldea. *Lift
up* then your eyes.” As they were so very intent on their present ease,
he bids them to lift up their eyes, that they might see farther than
they were wont to do.

<span id="v.xiv-p7"></span>He then says, *Where is the flock which had
been given to thee? and the sheep of thy glory?* It is through pity that
the Prophet thus speaks; for he saw by the Spirit the whole land
deserted, and in wonder he asks, “What does this mean, that the flock is
scattered which had been given to thee?” He addresses the people under
the character of a woman, as he does often in other places.  <span
id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) In short, he confirms what he had said
before, — that he would go to some secret place, if the people were not
influenced by his doctrine, and that he would there by himself deplore
their calamity; but he employs other words, and at the same time
intimates, that he alone had eyes to see, as others were blind, for God
had even taken from them understanding and discernment. The Prophet then
shews here that he saw the dreadful desolation that was soon to come;
and therefore as one astonished he asks, Where is the flock with which
God had enriched the land? and further he asks, Where are the sheep
which possessed a magnificent honor or beauty? It follows —

<span id="v.xv"></span>

<span id="v.xv-p1"></span><span id="v.xv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#021.md)<span id="v.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.xv-p2"></span>**21** What wilt thou say when he shall punish
thee? for thou hast taught them *to be* captains, *and* as chief over
thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?

<span id="v.xv-p3"></span>**21** Quid dices, cum visitaverit super to?
Et tu (hoc est, atqui tu) docuisti (hoc est, assuefecisti) illos super
to duces in caput: annon dolores apprehendent to tanquam mulierem
parturientem?

<span id="v.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.xv-p5"></span><span id="v.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xv-p6"></span>As the Prophet observed that the Jews were in
no way moved, he addressed them still further, and set before them what
seemed then incredible, even the calamity, from which they thought they
were able easily to defend themselves by means of their auxiliaries.

<span id="v.xv-p7"></span>He then adds, *What wilt thou then say?* For
the false teachers made a clamor, and whenever Jeremiah began to speak,
they violently assailed him, and the common people also wantonly barked
at him. As then they thus petulantly resisted God and his truths, the
Prophet intimates that the time would come when they should become mute
through shame: *What wilt thou say then?* he says, “Ye are now very
talkative, and God cannot obtain a hearing from you; but he will check
your wantonness, when the enemy shall distress you.” It is the same as
though he had said, “It will not be the time then for your loquacity,
for the Lord will constrain you to be silent.”

<span id="v.xv-p8"></span>Some refer to God what follows, *When, he
shall visit you;* but it ought on the contrary to be applied to the
Chaldeans; for he immediately adds, *But thou hast accustomed them,*
etc. There is indeed a change or an anomaly of number, but this is
common in the prophets. When he uses the singular, the head of the army
is referred to, but afterwards the whole forces are included. *What then
wilt thou say,* when the enemy *shall visit thee?* He then adds, *But
then,* etc.; that is, “If thou seekest to cast blame on others, when the
Assyrians and the Chaldeans shall overwhelm thee, thou wilt attempt it
in vain? for thou hast opened a passage for them, and *hast accustomed
them to be thy leaders over thy head.”* For the Assyrians had a long
time before been sent for by the Israelites; and the Jews also had
formed confederacies with the Chaldeans against the Assyrians, before
these monarchies were united. As then they had called them in as
auxiliaries, they had accustomed them to rule, and, as it were, had set
them over themselves. The case was similar to that of the Turks at this
day, were they to pass over to these parts and exercise their authority;
for it might be asked the French kings and their counsellors, “Whose
fault it is that the Turks come to us so easily? It is because ye have
prepared for them the way by sea, because ye have bribed them, and your
ports have been opened to them; and yet they have wilfully exercised the
greatest cruelty towards your subjects. All these things have proceeded
from yourselves; ye are therefore the authors of all these evils.” So
also now the Prophet upbraids the Jews, because they had accustomed the
Chaldeans to be their leaders; and as they had set them over their own
heads, he says to them, that it was no wonder that they were now so
troublesome and grievous to them.  <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md)

<span id="v.xv-p12"></span>He afterwards says, *Shall not sorrows lay
hold on thee as on a woman in travail?* By this comparison he intimates,
that the Jews gained nothing by their vain hopes; for when they should
say, peace and security, destruction, such as they by no means expected,
would suddenly come upon them. This similitude we know often occurs, and
it is a very apt one; for a woman with child may be very cheerful and
quietly enjoying herself, and yet a sudden pain may seize her. So also
it will be with the wicked; they cannot now bear to hear anything sad or
alarming, and they drive from them every fear as far as possible; but
the more they harden themselves, the heavier is God’s vengeance which
follows them, and which will overtake them suddenly and unexpectedly. As
then it was incredible to the Jews, that the Chaldeans would soon come
to lay waste their land, he says to them, “Surely sorrows will take hold
on you, though you look not for them. Though a woman with child thinks
not of her coming pain, yet it comes suddenly and cannot be driven away;
so you will gain nothing by heedlessly promising to yourselves continual
peace and quietness.” I cannot finish what follows today if I go on
farther; I shall therefore put it off to the next Lecture.

<span id="v.xviii-p2"></span>**22** And if thou say in thine heart,
Wherefore come these things upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity

<span id="v.xviii-p3"></span>**22** Quod si dixeris in corde suc, cur

discoopertae sunt fimbriae tuae, et nudati calces tui (vel, plantae tuae
nudatae sunt)

<span id="v.xviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.xviii-p5"></span><span id="v.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xviii-p6"></span>The Prophet again declares that God’s
judgment would be just, which he had previously foretold; for
hypocrites, we know, do not cease to quarrel with God, except they are
often proved guilty; and it is always their object, where they cannot
wholly excuse themselves, to extenuate in some measure their fault. The
Prophet therefore here removes every pretense for evasion, and declares
that they were wholly worthy of such a reward.

<span id="v.xviii-p7"></span>But his manner of speaking ought to be
noticed, *If thou wilt say in thine heart,* etc. Hypocrites do not only
claim for themselves righteousness before the world, but they also
deceive themselves, and the devil so dementates them with a false
persuasion, that they seek to be counted just before God. This then is
what the Prophet sets forth when he says, *If thou wilt say in thine
heart, Why have these evils happened to me?*  <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) that is, if thou seekest by secret
murmuring to contend with God, the answer is ready*,* — *Because of the
multitude of thine iniquity, discovered are thy skirts, and thy heels
are denuded.”* The multitude of iniquity he calls that perverse
wickedness which prevailed among the Jews; for they had not ceased for a
long time to provoke the wrath of God. Had they only once sinned, or had
been guilty of one kind of sin, there would have been some hope of
pardon, at least God would not have executed a punishment so severe; but
as there had been an uninterrupted course of sinning, the Prophet shews
that it would not be right to spare them any longer.

<span id="v.xviii-p11"></span>As to the simile, it is a form of speaking
often used by the prophets, that is, to denude the soles of the feet,
and to discover the skirts. We know that; men clothe themselves, not
only to preserve them from cold. but that they also cover the body for
the sake of modesty: there is therefore a twofold use of garments, the
one occasioned by necessity, and the other by decency. As then clothes
are partly made for this end — to cover what could not be decently shewn
or left bare without shame, the prophets use this mode of speaking when
they have in view to shew that one is exposed to public reproaJeremiah
 <span id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md) It afterwards follows —

<span id="v.xix"></span>

<span id="v.xix-p1"></span><span id="v.xix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#023.md)<span id="v.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.xix-p2"></span>**23** Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or
the leopard his spots? *then* may ye also do good, that are accustomed
to do evil.

<span id="v.xix-p3"></span>**23** An mutabit (sic proprie vertitur)
Ethiopa pellem suam, et pardus maculas suas (aut, varietates, nam nomen
hoc duplicatum deducitur a <span id="v.xix-p3.1"></span>חבר, quod
significat congregare, significat etiam livorem, accipitur vero hic pro
maculis) etiam tu poteris ad benefaciendum, doctus ad malum?

<span id="v.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.xix-p5"></span><span id="v.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xix-p6"></span>God declares in this verse, that the people
were so hardened in their wickedness, that there was no hope of their
repentance. This is the sum of what is said. But it was a very bitter
reproof for the Prophet to say that his own nation were past hope — that
they had so entirely given themselves up to their vices that they were
no longer healable.

<span id="v.xix-p7"></span>But he uses a comparison*,* — *Can the
Ethiopian,*  <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md) he says, *change his
skin?* Blackness is inherent in the skin of the Ethiopians, as it is
well known. Were they then to wash themselves a hundred times daily,
they could not put off their blackness. The same also must be said of
leopards or panthers, and we know that these animals are besprinkled
with spots. Such then is the spotted character of the leopard or
panther,  <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) that whatever might be
done to him he would still retain his color. We now then see what the
Prophet means — that the Jews were so corrupted by long habit that they
could not repent, for the devil had so enslaved them that they were not
in their right mind; they no longer had any discernment, and could not
discriminate between good and evil.

<span id="v.xix-p10"></span>Learned men in our age do not wisely refer
to this passage, when they seek to prove that there is no free-will in
man; for it is not simply the nature of man that is spoken of here, but
the habit that is contracted by long practice. Aristotle, a strong
advocate of free will, confesses that it is not in man’s power to do
right, when he is so immersed in his own vices as to have lost a free
choice, (*7. Lib. Ethicon)* and this also is what experience proves. We
hence see that this passage is improperly adduced to prove a sentiment
which is yet true, and fully confirmed by many passages of Scripture.

<span id="v.xix-p11"></span>Jeremiah, then, does not here refer to man’s
nature as he is when he comes from the womb; but he condemns the Jews
for contracting such a habit by long practice. As, then, they had
hardened themselves in doing evil, he says that they could not repent,
that wickedness had become inherent, or firmly fixed in their hearts,
like the blackness which is inherent in the skin of the Ethiopians, or
the spots which belong to the leopards or panthers.

<span id="v.xix-p12"></span>We may at the same time gather from this
passage a useful doctrine — that men become so corrupt, by sinful habits
and sinful indulgence, that the devil takes away from them every desire
and care for acting rightly, so that, in a word, they become wholly
irreclaimable, as we see to be the case with regard to bodily diseases;
for a chronic disease, in most instances, so corrupts what is sound and
healthy in the body, that it becomes by degrees incurable. When,
therefore, the body is thus infected for a long time, there is no hope
of a cure Life may indeed be prolonged, but not without continual
languor. Now, as to spiritual diseases it is also true, that when
putridity has pervaded the inward parts, it is impossible for any one to
repent. And yet it must be observed, that we do not speak here of the
power of God, but only shew, that all those who harden themselves in
their vices, as far as their power is concerned, are incurable, and past
all remedy. Yet God can deliver, even from the lowest depths, such as
have a hundred times past all recovery. But here, as I have already
said, the Prophet does not refer to God’s power, but only condemns his
own nation, that they might not complain that God treated them with too
much severity.

<span id="v.xix-p13"></span>The meaning then is, that they ought not to
have thought it strange that God left them no hope; for they became past
recovery, through their own perverseness, as they could not adopt
another course of life after having so long accustomed themselves to
everything that was evil: *Wilt thou also,* he says, *be able to do
good?* that is, wilt thou apply thy mind to what is just, *who hast been
accustomed to evil,* or who hast hitherto learnt nothing but to do evil?
 <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) We now perceive the design of the
Prophet — that they unreasonably sought pardon of God, who had
contracted such hardness by a long course of sinning that they were
become incurable. It afterwards follows —

<span id="v.xx"></span>

<span id="v.xx-p1"></span><span id="v.xx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#024.md)<span id="v.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.xx-p2"></span>**24** Therefore will I scatter them as the
stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness.

<span id="v.xx-p3"></span>**24** Et dispergam (vel, dissipabo) eos quasi
stipulam transeuntem ad ventum deserti.

<span id="v.xx-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.xx-p5"></span><span id="v.xx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xx-p6"></span>This is an inference which Jeremiah draws from
the last verse. As long as there is any hope of repentance, there is
also room for mercy; God often declares that he is long-suffering. Then
the most wicked might object and say, that God is too rigid, because he
waits not until they return to a sound mind. Now the Prophet had said
that it was all over with the people: here therefore he meets the
objection, and shews that extreme calamity was justly brought on them by
God, because the Jews had obstinately hardened themselves in their vices
and wickedness.

<span id="v.xx-p7"></span>After having shewn, therefore, that corruption
was inherent in them, as blackness in the skin of an Ethiopian, and as
spots in panthers, he now comes to this conclusion — *I will scatter
them as stubble which passes away by the wind of the desert* This
scattering denotes their exile; as though he had said, “I will banish
them, that they may know that they are deprived of the inheritance in
which they place their safety and their happiness.” For the Jews gloried
in this only — that they were God’s people, because the Temple was built
among them, and because they dwelt in the land promised to them. They
then thought that God was in a manner tied to them, while they possessed
that inheritance. Hence Jeremiah declares, that they would become like
stubble carried away by the wind.

<span id="v.xx-p8"></span>He mentions *the wind of the desert,* that is,
the wind of the south, which was the most violent in that country. The
south wind, as we know, was also pestilential; the air also was more
disturbed by the south wind than by any other, for it raised storms and
tempests. Therefore the Scripture, in setting forth any turbulent
movement, often adopts this similitude. Some think that Jeremiah alludes
to the Egyptians; but I see no reason to seek out any refined
explanation, when this mode of speaking is commonly adopted. Then by
this similitude of south wind God intimates the great power of his
vengeance; as though he had said, “Even if the Jews think that they have
a firm standing in the promised land, they are wholly deceived, for God
will with irresistible force expel them.” And he compares them to
*stubble,* while yet they boasted that they were like trees planted in
that land; and we have before seen that they had been planted as it were
by the hand of God; but they wanted the living root of piety, they were
therefore to be driven far away like stubble.  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md)

<span id="v.xx-p14"></span>Let us then learn from this passage not to
abuse the patience of God: for though he may suspend for a time the
punishment we deserve, yet when he sees that we go on in our wickedness,
he will come to extreme measures, and will deal with us without mercy as
those who are past remedy. It follows —

<span id="v.xxi"></span>

<span id="v.xxi-p1"></span><span id="v.xxi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#025.md)<span id="v.xxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxi-p2"></span>**25**. This *is* thy lot, the portion of thy
measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and
trusted in falsehood.

<span id="v.xxi-p3"></span>**25.** Haec sors tua, portio mensurarum
tuarum a me, dicit Jehova; quia oblita es mei, et confisa in mendacio.

<span id="v.xxi-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.xxi-p5"></span><span id="v.xxi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxi-p6"></span>The Prophet no doubt wished to strip the Jews
of their vain confidence, through which they acted arrogantly and
presumptuously towards God, while yet they professed his name and
claimed his favor. They said that they had obtained that land by an
hereditary right, because it had been promised to their father Abraham.
This indeed was true. They also said, that the land was God’s rest; and
they derived this from the prophets. They said farther that God was
their heritage; and this also was true. But since they had wickedly
profaned God’s name, he takes from them these false boastings, and says,
*This is thy lot* But still they said, When God divided the nations, his
lot fell on Israel, for so says Moses. (<span id="v.xxi-p6.1"></span>[De
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008)<span id="v.xxi-p6.1"></span>.md) As
then they were wont to say, that God afterwards deceived them, the
Prophet here on the other hand reminds them, that they foolishly
confided in that lot, because God had rejected them, and did not
acknowledge them now as his children, as they were become degenerate and
perfidious. *This,* he says, *is thy lot*  <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md)

<span id="v.xxi-p10"></span>We see that there is to be understood here a
contrast: God was the lot of the people, and they were also the lot of
God, according to the passages to which we have referred. They were the
heritage of God, and they boasted that God was their heritage; the land
was a symbol and a pledge of this heritage. The Prophet now says: “This
lot shall be to thee *the portion of thy measures from me.”* He alludes
to an ancient custom; for they were wont to divide fields and meadows by
lines, as they afterwards used poles; and we call such measures in the
present day perches *(*<span id="v.xxi-p10.1"></span>*perticas.)*

<span id="v.xxi-p11"></span>We now then understand what the Prophet
means; for he intimates that the Jews vainly and presumptuously and
foolishly boasted, that God was their heritage; for he owned them not
now as his children: and he also declares that another lot was prepared
for them, far different from that of heritage, — that God would banish
them from the promised land, which they had polluted by their vices.
Thus we see that we ought not presumptuously and falsely to pretend or
profess the name of God; for though he has been pleased to choose us as
his people, it is yet required of us to be faithful to him; and if we
forsake him, the same reward for our impiety will no doubt await us as
Jeremiah threatens here to his own nation. Let us then so use the favor
of God and of Christ, and all the blessings which are offered to us by
the gospel, that we may not have to fear that vengeance which happened
to the Jews.

<span id="v.xxi-p12"></span>He adds the reason, *Because thou hast
forgotten me and trusted in falsehood*  <span
id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) By falsehood the Prophet means not only
the superstitions in which the Jews involved themselves, but also the
false counsels which they adopted, when at one time they had recourse to
the Egyptians, at another to some other ungodly nations, in order to get
aids in opposition to the will of God. For wherever there was any
danger, they thought they had a remedy at hand by having the favor and
help of the Egyptians, or of the Assyrians, or of the Chaldeans. In the
word falsehood, then, the Prophet includes those perverse designs which
they formed, when they sought to defend themselves against God, who
would have protected them by his power, had it not been necessary to
punish them for their sins. What Jeremiah then condemned in the people
was, that they placed their *trust in falsehood,* that is, that they
souglint here and there vain helps, and at the same time disregarded
God; nay, they thought themselves safer when God was displeased with
them: and hence he says, *Thou hast forgotten me* For the Jews could not
have sought deliverance from the Egyptians or from other heathen
nations, or from their idols, without having first rejected God; for if
this truth had been really fixed in their minds, — that God cared for
their safety, they would no doubt have been satisfied with his
protection. Their ingratitude was therefore very manifest in thus
adopting vain and impious hopes; for they thus dishonored God, and
distrusted his power, as though he was not sufficient to preserve them.
It now follows—

<span id="v.xxii"></span>

<span id="v.xxii-p1"></span><span id="v.xxii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#026.md)<span id="v.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxii-p2"></span>**26**. Therefore will I discover thy skirts
upon thy face, that thy shame may appear.

<span id="v.xxii-p3"></span>**26.** Et etiam ego nudabo, (*vel,*
discooperiam) fimbrias tuas in faciem tuam (super faciem tuam,) et
aspicietur ignominia tua (*potest etiam in proeterito tempore exponi hic
versus; sed quoniam vaticinium est, ideo non insisto curiose in verbis
aut in syllabis, sed sensum duntaxat respicio; quamquam non male etiam
conveniet, si vertamus in tempore proeterito, quasi propheta de re jam
facta disserat.)*

<span id="v.xxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.xxii-p5"></span><span id="v.xxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxii-p6"></span>He continues the same subject, — that God
did not deal with his people with so much severity without the most just
cause; for it could not be expected that he should treat them with more
gentleness, since they rejected him and had recourse to vain
confidences. *I also,* he says; for the particle <span
id="v.xxii-p6.1"></span>גם, *gam,* denotes something mutual, as though
he had said, “I also will have my turn; for I have it in my power to
avenge myself: I will retaliate,” he seems to say, “this thine
ingratitude; for as thou hast despised me, so will I expose thee to
reproach and shame.” For God was shamefully despised by the Jews, when
they substituted the Egyptians and their idols in his place: they could
not have done him more dishonor than by transferring his glory to the
ungodly and to their own figments. We hence see that there is an
emphasis in the particle *also, I will also make bare,* or discover,
*thy skirts on thy face;* that is, I will cast thy skirts on thy face.
 <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md)

<span id="v.xxii-p10"></span>This mode of speaking often occurs in the
Prophets; and as I have elsewhere explained, it means the uncovering of
the uncomely parts: it is as though a vile woman was condemned to bear
the disgrace of being stripped of her garments and exposed to the
public, that all might abhor a spectacle so base and disgraceful. God,
as we have before seen, assumed the character of a husband to his
people: as then he had been so shamefully despised, he now says, that he
had in readiness the punishment of casting the skirts of his people over
their faces, that their reproach or baseness might appear by exposing
their uncomely parts. It then follows —

<span id="v.xxiii"></span>

<span id="v.xxiii-p1"></span><span id="v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
13:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#027.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxiii-p2"></span>**27**. I have seen thy adulteries, and thy
neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, *and* thine abominations on the
hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made
clean? when *shall it* once *be*?

<span id="v.xxiii-p3"></span>**27**. Adulteria tua et hinnitus tuos,
cogitationem scortationis tuae super montes in agro vidi, abominationes
tuas: vae tibi Jerusalem; non mundaberis posthac? quousque adhuc?

<span id="v.xxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.xxiii-p5"></span><span id="v.xxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxiii-p6"></span>Here the Prophet explains at large what I
have before stated, — that the people were justly punished by God,
though very grievously, because they had provoked God, not at one time
only, but for a long time, and had obstinately persisted in their evil
courses. Moreover, as their sins were various, the Prophet does not
mention them all here; for we have seen elsewhere, that they were not
only given to superstitions, but also to whoredoms, drunkenness,
plunders, and outrages; but here he only speaks of their superstitions,
— that having rejected God, they followed their own idols. For by
*adulteries* he no doubt means idolatries; and he does not speak here of
whoredom, which yet prevailed greatly among the people; but he only
condemns them for having fallen away into ungodly and false forms of
worship. To the same thing must be referred what follows, *thy
neighings;* for by this comparison, we know, is set forth elsewhere, by
way of reproach, that furious ardor with which the Jews followed their
own inventions. The word indeed sometimes means exultation; for the verb
<span id="v.xxiii-p6.1"></span>צהל, *tsel,* is to exult; but here, as in
<span id="v.xxiii-p6.2"></span>[Jeremiah
5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#000.md)<span id="v.xxiii-p6.2"></span> it
signifies neighing.

<span id="v.xxiii-p7"></span>He then says, *Thy adulteries and thy
neighings,* etc. Now this is far more shameful than if he had said thy
lusts, for by this comparison we know their crime was enhanced*,*
because they were not merely inflamed by a violent natural lust, such as
adulterers feel towards strumpets, but they were like horses or bulls:
*Thy adulteries* then *and thy neighings;* and he adds, the *thought of
thy whoredom, etc.* The word <span id="v.xxiii-p7.1"></span>זמת,
*zamet,* is to be taken here for thought, and this is its proper
meaning. It is indeed taken sometimes in a bad sense; but the Prophet, I
have no doubt, meant here to wipe off a color with which the Jews
painted themselves; for they said that they intended to worship God,
while they accumulated rites which were not. prescribed in the law. The
Prophet therefore condemns them here as being within full of unchastity,
as though he had said, “I do not only accuse you of open acts of
wickedness, but ye burn also within with lust, for impiety has taken
such hold on all your thoughts, that God has no place at all in you; ye
are like an unchaste woman, who thinks of nothing but of her filthy
lovers, and goes after her adulterers: ye are thus wholly given up to
your whoredoms.

<span id="v.xxiii-p8"></span>Some read the words by themselves and put
them in the nominative case, *“*Thy adulteries and thy neighings, and
the thought of thy whoredom on the mountains;” and then they add, “In
the field have I seen thine abominations.” But I prefer to take the
whole together, and thus to include all as being governed by the verb
<span id="v.xxiii-p8.1"></span>ראיתי, I have seen; “Thy adulteries and
thy neighings, the thought of thy whoredom on the mountains in the field
have I seen, *even* thy abominations.” The last word is to be taken in
apposition with the former words. But the Prophet introduces God here as
the speaker, that the Jews might not seek evasions and excuse
themselves. He therefore shews that God, whose proper office it is to
examine and search the hearts of men, is the fit Judge.  <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md)

<span id="v.xxiii-p16"></span>He mentions *hills* and *field.* Altars,
we know, were then built on hills, for they thought that God would be
better worshipped in groves; and hence there was no place, no wood, and
even no tree, but that they imagined there was something divine in it.
This is the reason why the Prophet says, that their abominations were
seen by God on the hills as well as on the plains. And he adds *fields,*
as though he had said, that the hills did not suffice them for their
false worship, by which they profaned the true worship of God, but that
the level fields were filled with their abominations.

<span id="v.xxiii-p17"></span>We now then perceive the meaning of what
is here said, that the Jews in vain tried to escape by evasions, since
God declares that he had *seen* them; as though he had said, “Cease to
produce your excuses, for I will allow nothing of what ye may bring
forward, as the whole is already well known by me.” And he declares
their doings to be abominations, and also adulteries and neighings.

<span id="v.xxiii-p18"></span>At length he adds, *Woe to thee,
Jerusalem!* The Prophet here confirms what we have before observed, that
the Jews had no just ground of complaint, for they had provoked God
extremely. Hence the particle *woe* intimates that they were now justly
given up to destruction. And then he says, *Will they never repent?* But
this last part is variously explained; and I know not whether it can
today be fully expounded. I will however briefly glance at the meaning.

<span id="v.xxiii-p19"></span>*Jerome* seems to have read <span
id="v.xxiii-p19.1"></span>אחרי, *achri,* “after me,” “Wilt thou not then
return after me?” as though God here intended to exhort the Jews to
return at length to him, as he was ready to be reconciled to them. But
as it is simply <span id="v.xxiii-p19.2"></span>אחרי, *achri,* and he
may have read without the points, I do not wish to depart from what is
commonly received. There is further a difficulty in the words which
follow, for interpreters vary as to the import of the words <span
id="v.xxiii-p19.3"></span>מתי עד, *mati od,* “how long yet?” In whatever
sense we may take the words, they are sufficient to confute the opinion
of *Jerome,* which I had forgotten to mention, because the malediction
in that case would be improper and without meaning, “Woe to thee,
Jerusalem, wilt thou not be made clean after me?” for what can this
mean? It is therefore necessary so to read as to include all the words
in the sentence, “Wilt thou not hereafter *or* at length be made clean?”
Some, however, read the words affirmatively, “Thou shalt not be cleansed
hereafter,” as though it was said, “Thou shalt not be cleansed until I
first drive thee into exile.” But this meaning is too refined, as I
think. I therefore take the words in their simple form, *Wilt thou not
at length be made clean? how long yet?* as though God again reproved the
hardness of the people, as indeed he did reprove it. Hence he says,
“Wilt thou not at length be made clean?” for I take <span
id="v.xxiii-p19.4"></span>אחרי, *achri,* as meaning “at length.” Then
follows an amplification, <span id="v.xxiii-p19.5"></span>מתיעד, *mati
od,* “how long yet?”  <span id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) that is,
“Wilt thou never make an end? and can I not at length obtain this from
thee, since I have so often exhorted thee, and since thou seest that I
make no end of exhorting thee? how long yet shall thy obstinacy
continue, so that I cannot subdue thee by my salutary admonitions?” This
is the meaning.

<span id="v.xxiv"></span>

<span id="v.xxiv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="v.xxiv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast once
cleansed us by the blood of thine only-begotten Son, to the end that we
might worship thee in true sincerity of heart, and that we might also
strive to regulate our whole life according to the rule of
righteousness, — O grant that we, being mindful of our vocation, may
labor to render ourselves approved by thee, so that thy name may through
us be glorified, and that casting far away from us all pollutions, we
may retain the simple worship of thee, and preserve ourselves within the
limits of thy word, so that we may not be led astray after vanities and
the sinful superstitions of this world, but advance towards the mark
which thou hast been pleased to set before us, until we shall be at
length gathered into that celestial kingdom in which we shall enjoy that
inheritance which thine only-begotten Son has provided for us. — Amen.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[70](cc18004.htm#fr_69.md) <span
id="v.i-p22.3"></span>

<span id="v.i-p23"></span> It is rendered “<span
id="v.i-p23.1"></span>περίζωμα — a girdle,” by the *Septuagint*; —
“<span id="v.i-p23.2"></span>lumbare — a garment for the loins,” by the
*Vulgate*; — “<span id="v.i-p23.3"></span>sudarium — a napkin,” by the
*Syriac*; — “<span id="v.i-p23.4"></span>cingulum — a girdle,” by the
*Targum* and *Arabic*. The Hebrew word never means anything but a girdle
or belt, as the verb signifies to surround, to bind.

<span id="v.i-p24"></span>*Calvin* makes no remark on the command, not
to put it in water before he wore it. Various has been the explanation.
The view the Rabbins give is inconsistent with the passage, — that it
was to be left dirty after wearing, that it might rot the sooner; for
the Prophet is bidden, when commanded to wear it, not to wash it.
*Grotius* and others think that he was to wear it as made, in its rough
state, in order to shew the rude condition of the Jews when God adopted
them. *Venema* is of the opinion that in order to shew that is was newly
made, and had not been worn by another, nor polluted. *Gataker* says
that the purpose was to shew that nothing was to be done by the Prophet
to cause the girdle to rot, as wet might have done so, in order to prove
that the rottenness proceeded only from the Jews themselves. *Lowth*
regards it as intended to teach the Jews their corrupt state by nature,
so that it was through favor or grace only that God adopted them; and he
refers to <span id="v.i-p24.1"></span>[Eze
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#004.md)<span id="v.i-p24.1"></span>. The
last, which is nearly the same with the view of *Grotius*, seems the
most suitable. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[71](cc18004.htm#fr_70.md) <span
id="v.i-p32.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p33"></span> Many agree with Calvin that this was a vision
and not an actual transaction, such as *Gataker, Lowth, Blayney, Adara
Clarke*, &c. *Henry* hesitates, but Scott seems to be strongly in favor
of a real transaction. *Bochart* and *Venema* hold also the latter
opinion, only they think that <span id="v.i-p33.1"></span>פרת here does
not mean “Euphrates,” but Ephrata, that is, Bethlehem, in Judea; but
this cannot be maintained. Lowth refers to an instance where a vision is
related as a fact, without any mention being made that it was a vision,
that is, <span id="v.i-p33.2"></span>[Ge
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md)<span id="v.i-p33.2"></span>: God
brought Abraham forth and shewed to him the stars; and yet it appears
from <span id="v.i-p33.3"></span>[Jer
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#012.md)<span id="v.i-p33.3"></span> that
the sun was not set. *Blayney* remarks, that “the same supposition of a
vision must be admitted in other cases, particularly <span
id="v.i-p33.4"></span>[Jer
25:15-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#015.md)<span id="v.i-p33.4"></span>.”
*Gataker* refers to similar instances in <span
id="v.i-p33.5"></span>[Eze 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#003.md)<span
id="v.i-p33.5"></span>; <span id="v.i-p33.6"></span>[Eze
11:24](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#024.md)<span id="v.i-p33.6"></span>. It
was most probably a vision; and the Prophet related to the people what
God had in a supernatural way exhibited to him. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_71"></span>[72](cc18004.htm#fr_71.md) <span
id="v.i-p35.3"></span>

<span id="v.i-p36"></span> It is strangely rendered “reproach — <span
id="v.i-p36.1"></span>ὕζριν,” by the *Septuagint,* but “pride” by the
*Vulgate,* — “the haughty ones,” by the *Syriac,* — “insolence” by the
*Arabic,* and “strength” by the *Targum. Blayney* agrees with *Calvin*
and renders it “excellency,” and *Horsley,* “glory.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_72"></span>[73](cc18004.htm#fr_72.md) <span
id="v.iv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p4"></span> These words are in the *Septuagint* and the
*Vulgate* put in apposition with the last words of the preceding verse;
but in the *Syriac* and *Targum* they form the nominative case to the
verb “shall be,” as in our version, near the end of the verse, the <span
id="v.iv-p4.1"></span>ו before it being omitted; but the simpler mode of
construction is to consider the substantive verb, is, to be understood
in the first clause; then the whole verse would run thus, —

<span id="v.iv-p5"></span>This *is* a wicked people, Who refuse to hear
my words, Who walk in the resolutions of their own heart, And walk after
foreign gods, To serve them and to bow down to them; And they shall be
as this girdle, Which will not be good for anything.

<span id="v.iv-p6"></span>On “the resolutions,” see vol. 1. “For
anything,” the <span id="v.iv-p6.2"></span>כל here evidently means
“anything,” as it means in some other places “any,” or any one — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_73"></span>[74](cc18004.htm#fr_73.md) <span
id="v.v-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.v-p9"></span> “Name” means here renown; “praise,” celebrity
or commendation; and “glory,” ornament, decoration, or beauty. The three
words are found together, though not in exactly the same order, in <span
id="v.v-p9.1"></span>[De 26:19](../../../bib/kjv/deu026.htm#019.md)<span
id="v.v-p9.1"></span>. There the order is, praise, name, and honor,
which is rendered here “glory.” See <span id="v.v-p9.2"></span>[Isa
43:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#021.md)<span id="v.v-p9.2"></span>;
<span id="v.v-p9.3"></span>[Isa
61:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#011.md)<span id="v.v-p9.3"></span>;
<span id="v.v-p9.4"></span>[Isa
63:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#012.md)<span id="v.v-p9.4"></span>. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[75](cc18004.htm#fr_74.md) <span
id="v.vi-p10.2"></span>

<span id="v.vi-p11"></span> It is not true that the word ever means a
bladder, though so rendered by the *Septuagint* and the *Targum.* The
*Vulgate* has “<span id="v.vi-p11.1"></span>laguncula — a little
flagon,” and *Syriac* “<span id="v.vi-p11.2"></span>dolium, — a tub.” It
means a jug or jar. *Blayney* has “vessel.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[76](cc18004.htm#fr_75.md) <span
id="v.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="v.vi-p14"></span> With regard to this comparison, *Gataker*
says, “A type taken from what they much loved, liked, and looked after;
for they loved and looked after the *flagons of wine,* <span
id="v.vi-p14.1"></span>[Ho 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.vi-p14.1"></span>; and those prophets best pleased them who
prophesied of *wine and strong drink,* <span id="v.vi-p14.2"></span>[Mic
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic002.htm#011.md)<span id="v.vi-p14.2"></span>. God
therefore sendeth his prophet to them with a prophecy of *wine,* but of
other wine than they expected.”

<span id="fn_76"></span>[77](cc18004.htm#fr_76.md) <span
id="v.vi-p18.1"></span>

<span id="v.vi-p19"></span> The clause, literally rendered, would convey
this meaning, —

<span id="v.vi-p20"></span>And the kings who sit for David on his
throne.

<span id="v.vi-p21"></span>“For David,” that is, as his representatives.
“In David’s stead,” is the rendering of *Gataker* and *Blayney.* The
word “even” before “the kings” in our version, is improper; for what
follows is not a specification of what is gone before, as “the
inhabitants of Jerusalem,” at the end of the verse, is in contrast with
“all the inhabitants of this land,” that is, the people of the country —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_77"></span>[78](cc18004.htm#fr_77.md) <span
id="v.vi-p23.1"></span>

<span id="v.vi-p24"></span> The word seems to mean shattering or
breaking in pieces, and in a secondary sense, scattering, as the effect.
The early versions give the latter meaning, scattering, but, as *Calvin*
says, inconsistently with the rest of the clause. The *Targum* gives in
effect the first sense, “I will cause them to rush, each on his
brother.” The word “dash” is the most suitable, or dash to pieces, —

<span id="v.vi-p25"></span>And I will dash them to pieces, each against
his brother,  
Both the fathers and the sons together, saith Jehovah.

<span id="v.vi-p26"></span>The allusion is to the bottles: they would be
broken like brittle vessels, when thrown one against another. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[79](cc18004.htm#fr_78.md) <span
id="v.vi-p27.1"></span>

<span id="v.vi-p28"></span> The verbs are different, and so *Calvin*
renders them in the text; but not here. There is no unanimity in the
versions as to these verbs and the one which follows. The first means to
be tender so as to relent; the second, to spare so as not to inflict
punishment, to connive; and the third, to feel pity or compassion. They
may be rendered thus, —

<span id="v.vi-p29"></span>I will not relent, nor will I spare;  
Nor will I pity, so as not to destroy them.

<span id="v.vi-p30"></span>The two lines announce the same thing, only
the last is stronger and more specific. Pitying or commiserating is
stronger than relenting, and not destroying describes the act, while
sparing is a general term. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[80](cc18004.htm#fr_79.md) <span
id="v.vi-p31.1"></span>

<span id="v.vi-p32"></span> The sentence literally is, “From consuming,”
or destroying, “them.” The preposition <span id="v.vi-p32.1"></span>מ*,
mem,* here has the force of a negative. It is a sort of an elliptic
phrase, which, though understood in the original, yet requires a
supplement in a translation, — “I will not pity, *so as to abstain* from
consuming them.” But a literal rendering in Welsh would be understood, —

<span id="v.vi-p33"></span><span id="v.vi-p33.1"></span>Ae ni resynav
rhag eu difetha.

<span id="v.vi-p34"></span>The preposition *“*<span
id="v.vi-p34.1"></span>*rhag,”* which ordinarily means *from*, signifies
here *from not,* which is exactly the Hebrew. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[81](cc18004.htm#fr_80.md) <span
id="v.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.vii-p9"></span> This may be rendered more consistently with
the context, “For Jehovah speaks,” or *is* speaking: for the *reference*
evidently is to what was now addressed to them. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[82](cc18004.htm#fr_81.md) <span
id="v.vii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="v.vii-p11"></span> So all the versions and the *Targum.
Gataker* renders it, “Be ye not haughty,” which is no doubt the meaning.
The verb means to be high, lofty, or elevated, and so to be elevated as
to be haughty, proud. See <span id="v.vii-p11.1"></span>[Isa
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#016.md)<span id="v.vii-p11.1"></span>.
Men, creatures of the dust, too high and elevated to hear what God said
to them! This is the case still. What a monstrous thing! — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_82"></span>[83](cc18004.htm#fr_82.md) <span
id="v.x-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.x-p9"></span> All the versions and the *Targum* render the
first verb intransitively, “Before it grows dark:” but *Montanus,
Pagninus, Piscator* and *Junius and Tremellius,* give it a transitive
meaning, as *Calvin* does, and no doubt correctly, for it is in Hiphil,
“Before he causes *or* brings darkness;” or it may be rendered, “Before
he makes it dark.” *Blayney* follows the early versions, but *Gataker,
Lowth,* and *Venema,* the latter versions; and the conclusion of the
verse confirms, as *Calvin* says, this meaning. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[84](cc18004.htm#fr_83.md) <span
id="v.x-p10.4"></span>

<span id="v.x-p11"></span> This is a mistake, the preposition is <span
id="v.x-p11.1"></span>על which means *on, upon,* etc.

<span id="v.x-p12"></span>Our version of this sentence is in accordance
with the early versions: it is indeed literally the *Septuagint* and the
*Vulgate.* Yet it is not the original. The verb is in Hithpael, and
means to strike or smite together, or against one another. The literal
rendering is the following, —

<span id="v.x-p13"></span>Before your feet smite one against the
other,  
On the mountains of gloominess *(i.e.* gloomy mountains.)

<span id="v.x-p14"></span>It is true the word for “gloominess” means
sometimes the twilight; but here it seems to signify a state somewhat
dark or obscure. To wander and to stumble on gloomy mountains betokens
the miserable condition of fugitives: and this is what is meant here.
See <span id="v.x-p14.1"></span>[Jer
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016.md)<span id="v.x-p14.1"></span>;
<span id="v.x-p14.2"></span>[Eze
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#016.md)<span id="v.x-p14.2"></span>. Then
what follows might be thus rendered, —

<span id="v.x-p15"></span>When ye shall look anxiously for light,  
Then will he make it the shadow of death,  
He will turn it to thick darkness.

<span id="v.x-p16"></span>When two *vaus* occur in a sentence, they may
often be rendered *when* and *then.* The change proposed as to the last
verb is not at all necessary. Literally it is, “He will set it (to be)
for thick darkness.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[85](cc18004.htm#fr_84.md) <span
id="v.xi-p9.2"></span>

<span id="v.xi-p10"></span> The whole verse may be thus rendered, —

<span id="v.xi-p11"></span>But if ye will not hear, weep in secret
places Will my soul, on account of your haughtiness; Yea, bewailing it
will bewail, And pour down will mine eye the tear, When taken captive is
the flock of Jehovah.

<span id="v.xi-p12"></span>The word for “haughtiness,” <span
id="v.xi-p12.1"></span>גוה, is rendered “insolence” by the *Septuagint*
and *Arabic;* “pride” by the *Vulgate,* and “affliction” by the
*Syriac.* The word is commonly derived from <span
id="v.xi-p12.2"></span>גאה, to swell, to be high, to be elated. It is
found in this sense in two other places, <span
id="v.xi-p12.3"></span>[Job 33:17](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#017.md)<span
id="v.xi-p12.3"></span>, and <span id="v.xi-p12.4"></span>[Da
4:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#037.md)<span id="v.xi-p12.4"></span>; and
in a good sense, elevation, in <span id="v.xi-p12.5"></span>[Job
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#029.md)<span id="v.xi-p12.5"></span>. It
seems to be a contraction, in full <span id="v.xi-p12.6"></span>גאוה.
See <span id="v.xi-p12.7"></span>[Ps
36:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa036.htm#012.md)<span id="v.xi-p12.7"></span>;
<span id="v.xi-p12.8"></span>[Pr
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#023.md)<span id="v.xi-p12.8"></span>.
This being the meaning of the word, the view of *Calvin* cannot be
admitted. There is an evident reference to what is said in <span
id="v.xi-p12.9"></span>[Jer 13:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#015.md)<span
id="v.xi-p12.9"></span>, “Be ye not lifted up,” or, “be ye not haughty.”
The cause of his weeping was their haughtiness in not hearing God
speaking to them.- *Ed.*

<span id="fn_85"></span>[86](cc18004.htm#fr_85.md) <span
id="v.xii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="v.xii-p7"></span> So *Gataker* and *Lowth;* and they refer to
<span id="v.xii-p7.1"></span>[2Ki
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#012.md)<span id="v.xii-p7.1"></span>,
and to <span id="v.xii-p7.2"></span>[Jer
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#026.md)<span id="v.xii-p7.2"></span>.
From this circumstance it is gathered that this prophecy was delivered
in the short reign of that king, which lasted only three months.

<span id="v.xii-p8"></span>The word “queen,” in our version, is rendered
“mistress *or* lady — <span id="v.xii-p8.1"></span>domina,” by *Calvin,*
but *“potentates”* by the *Septuagint, Syriac,* and *Arabic;* “governess
— <span id="v.xii-p8.2"></span>dominatrix,” by the *Vulgate;* and
“queen” by the *Targum.* The word means governess; it is rendered
“mistress” in <span id="v.xii-p8.3"></span>[Gen.
16:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#004.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/gen016.htm#008.md)<span id="v.xii-p8.3"></span>;
“lady” in <span id="v.xii-p8.4"></span>[Isa.
47:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#005.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/isa047.htm#007.md)<span id="v.xii-p8.4"></span>; and
“queen” in <span id="v.xii-p8.5"></span>[2Ki
10:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#013.md)<span id="v.xii-p8.5"></span>. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_86"></span>[87](cc18004.htm#fr_86.md) <span
id="v.xii-p8.6"></span>

<span id="v.xii-p9"></span> There is an oversight here; the passage
referred to is in <span id="v.xii-p9.1"></span>[Mic
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#001.md)<span id="v.xii-p9.1"></span>; nor
is it a right view of it. See vol. 3 on the Minor Prophets, p. 328. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[88](cc18004.htm#fr_87.md) <span
id="v.xii-p15.2"></span>

<span id="v.xii-p16"></span> All the early versions render the words,
“Fallen from your head has the crown of your glory.” Our version is that
of *Montanus.* If <span id="v.xii-p16.1"></span>מ be a formative, then
the word, in every instance in which it occurs, means bolsters or
pillows, things for the head to rest on. The word for head has commonly
a masculine termination in the plural number; but here it is feminine.
The most literal rendering is the following: —

<span id="v.xii-p17"></span>For bring down from your heads will he the
crown of your glory.

<span id="v.xii-p18"></span>The latter words mean “your glorious crown,”
the expression being an Hebraism.

<span id="v.xii-p19"></span>Our common version, as *Blayney* observes,
violates grammar; for the gender of the verb <span
id="v.xii-p19.1"></span>ירד, (which, the same author thinks, ought to be
<span id="v.xii-p19.2"></span>יורד, future in Hiphil) is masculine,
while the noun made its nominative is feminine. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_88"></span>[89](cc18004.htm#fr_88.md) <span
id="v.xiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.xiii-p8"></span> The ancient versions render these last
words of the verse in the same way with our version and that of
*Calvin;* but the Hebrew, as *Blayney* remarks, is not rightly rendered,
though he unnecessarily makes <span id="v.xiii-p8.1"></span>כלה a verb,
and according to his construction it ought to be <span
id="v.xiii-p8.2"></span>כלתה; and he does not satisfactorily account for
the last word, <span id="v.xiii-p8.3"></span>שלומים. The literal version
I regard to be the following: —

<span id="v.xiii-p9"></span>The transmigration of Judah h*as been*
entire, — The transmigration of retributions.

<span id="v.xiii-p10"></span>The past time, as in the beginning of the
verse, is to be used, though it is used for the future. The word <span
id="v.xiii-p10.1"></span>שלומים, is never found in an adverbial sense;
and indeed it is found only once elsewhere as here, in the plural
number, <span id="v.xiii-p10.2"></span>[Isa
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#008.md)<span id="v.xiii-p10.2"></span>;
but thrice in this sense in the singular number, <span
id="v.xiii-p10.3"></span>[De
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035.md)<span id="v.xiii-p10.3"></span>;
<span id="v.xiii-p10.4"></span>[Ho
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007.md)<span id="v.xiii-p10.4"></span>;
<span id="v.xiii-p10.5"></span>[Mic
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#003.md)<span id="v.xiii-p10.5"></span>.
The *Targum* favors this rendering, as it retains the idea of
retribution. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_89"></span>[90](cc18004.htm#fr_89.md) <span
id="v.xiv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.xiv-p8"></span> May not the queen regent, or governess,
mentioned with the king in <span id="v.xiv-p8.1"></span>[Jer
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#018.md)<span id="v.xiv-p8.1"></span>, be
here meant? Sovereigns are called shepherds, and hence “flock” and
“sheep” are here mentioned. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[91](cc18004.htm#fr_90.md) <span
id="v.xv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.xv-p9"></span> The best rendering of this clause is as
follows: —

<span id="v.xv-p10"></span>For thou hast taught them to be over the
leaders in chief.

<span id="v.xv-p11"></span>It is the feminine gender that is still used;
and the queen or governess may be addressed as the representative of the
ruling power in the land. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[92](cc18004.htm#fr_91.md) <span
id="v.xviii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.xviii-p8"></span> The verb is here in the singular, and is
followed by a nominative in the plural; the very same anomaly exists in
*Welsh.* The line would be literally the same in that language, —

<span id="v.xviii-p9"></span><span id="v.xviii-p9.1"></span>Pam y
digwyddodd i mi y pethau hyn?

<span id="v.xviii-p10"></span>But if “these things” preceded the verb,
it would be in the plural. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[93](cc18004.htm#fr_92.md) <span
id="v.xviii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="v.xviii-p12"></span> The three last lines are as follows: —

<span id="v.xviii-p13"></span>For the number of thine iniquity
Discovered have been thy skirts, Violently stripped off have been thy
heels.

<span id="v.xviii-p14"></span>“Skirts” here stand for the parts covered
by them, and “heels” for the sandals which were worn. Both the
*Septuagint* and the *Vulgate* mention the parts, and not skirts — “the
hinder parts,” “the uncomely parts,” but they retain the word “heels.”
The metonomy exists, no doubt, as to both. The *Syriac* has “skirts” and
“ankles.” The *Targum* gives the meaning, “confusion” and “ignominy.”
The past time is used for the future. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_93"></span>[94](cc18004.htm#fr_93.md) <span
id="v.xix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.xix-p8"></span> The word in Hebrew is *“Cushite;”* and many
learned men contend that the “Ethiopian” is not meant, though all the
early versions so render it except the *Syriac,* which has “Indian.”
*Blayney* agrees with *Bochart* and others in thinking that the Cushites
were the inhabitants of Arabia, on the borders of the Red Sea, and he
refers in proof of this to <span id="v.xix-p8.1"></span>[2Ch
21:16](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#016.md)<span id="v.xix-p8.1"></span>.
The skin is not said here to be black, but it was no doubt of a
particular color, different from that of the Jews. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[95](cc18004.htm#fr_94.md) <span
id="v.xix-p8.2"></span>

<span id="v.xix-p9"></span>”Panther,” <span
id="v.xix-p9.1"></span>πάρδαλις — <span id="v.xix-p9.2"></span>pardus,
is the rendering of the *Septuagint* and the other versions. The word
rendered “spots,” found only here, is translated “varieties” by the
*Septuagint* and *Vulgate,* but “spots” by the *Syriac* and *Targum.* —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_95"></span>[96](cc18004.htm#fr_95.md) <span
id="v.xix-p13.1"></span>

<span id="v.xix-p14"></span> Neither this sentence nor the preceding is
put interrogatively in the *Septuagint,* the *Syriac,* and the
*Vulgate,* but in this way, — “If the Ethiopian,” etc.; “Even so can
ye,” etc. The *Arabic* and the *Targum* have both sentences in an
interrogative form, and more consistently with the Hebrew. *Blayney*
renders the first part interrogatively, as in our version, but not the
second, and he gives a meaning to the second part which the original
will not bear, and which is not countenanced by any of the versions. The
most literal version is as follows, —

<span id="v.xix-p15"></span>Can the Cushite change his skin, Or the
panther his spots? — Also ye, can ye do good, Who have learned evil?

<span id="v.xix-p16"></span>The future tense in Hebrew ought often to be
rendered potentially, and sometimes subjunctively. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[97](cc18004.htm#fr_96.md) <span
id="v.xx-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.xx-p9"></span> Our version begins with *“therefore,”* giving
this meaning to <span id="v.xx-p9.1"></span>ו, *vau,* but *Gataker*
considers this verse as connected with the 22d, and regards the 23d as
parenthetic; and then he renders the *vau* “and.” The literal rendering
of the latter part is, “Passing to the wind of the desert,” that is, the
stubble which is exposed to that violent wind. The meaning may be thus
given, —

<span id="v.xx-p10"></span>And I will scatter them like the stubble That
is subject to the wind of the desert.

<span id="v.xx-p11"></span>To pass over to a thing is to become within
its range, or to its possession. The sense would be given by the
following version, —

<span id="v.xx-p12"></span>That is carried away by the wind of the
desert.

<span id="v.xx-p13"></span>The meaning is not what the *Septuagint*
give, “carried by the wind to the desert;” nor what the *Vulgate*
presents, “carried by the wind in the desert;” but what is meant is,
“the wind of the desert,” or, as *Calvin* says, the south wind. When the
stubble was exposed to that, it is carried away with the greatest
violence: such would be the scattering of the Jews. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_97"></span>[98](cc18004.htm#fr_97.md) <span
id="v.xxi-p6.2"></span>

<span id="v.xxi-p7"></span> It may be thus rendered, —

<span id="v.xxi-p8"></span>This thy lot *is* the share of thy measures
From me, saith Jehovah.

<span id="v.xxi-p9"></span>The “lot” was the scattering threatened in
the previous verse. “The share of thy measures,” is a Hebrew idiom for
“a measured share,” or “a measured portion,” as rendered by *Blayney.*
Some say that “measures” are mentioned, because the length and breadth
were included. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[99](cc18004.htm#fr_98.md) <span
id="v.xxi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxi-p13"></span> It is better to render <span
id="v.xxi-p13.1"></span>אשר here “because” or for, according to all the
versions and the *Targum,* than “who,” as by *Blayney.* — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_99"></span>[100](cc18004.htm#fr_99.md) <span
id="v.xxii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="v.xxii-p7"></span> This is no doubt the meaning. See <span
id="v.xxii-p7.1"></span>[Na 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.xxii-p7.1"></span>. The verb means to strip off, so as to make
bare. The threatening is, to strip off the skirts and throw them over
the face; and this is the rendering of the *Syriac.* Probably the most
literal rendering would be the following, —

<span id="v.xxii-p8"></span>And I also will strip (or roll) up thy
skirts over thy face.

<span id="v.xxii-p9"></span>The versions all differ, but the
*Septuagint* convey this idea. *Blayney’s* uncovering “thy skirts before
thee,” imparts no meaning. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[101](cc18004.htm#fr_100.md) <span
id="v.xxiii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="v.xxiii-p9"></span> In all the versions, as well as in the
*Targum,* the words in the beginning of this verse, as far as
“whoredom,” are read in apposition with “shame” in the preceding verse,
and what follows as connected with the verb “I have seen,” in this
manner, —

<span id="v.xxiii-p10"></span>On hills in the field have I seen thy
abominations.

<span id="v.xxiii-p11"></span>Another arrangement, suggested by
*Gataker,* is more consonant with the Hebrew style, by considering the
substantive verb to be understood in the first clause, as follows, —

<span id="v.xxiii-p12"></span>**27.** Thy adulteries and thy neighings,
The scheming of thy fornication,  
*Have been* on hills in the field; I have seen thine abominations.

<span id="v.xxiii-p13"></span>The word <span
id="v.xxiii-p13.1"></span>זמת, which I render “scheming,” is from a verb
which means to devise, to contrive, to scheme, to plot. It is rendered
“wickedness” by the *Vulgate,* “alienation” by the *Septuagint,*
“fornication” by the *Syriac,* and “design” or counsel by the *Targum.*
It never means “lewdness.” It seems to mean here the contrivances and
devices formed by those given to fornication. *Blayney* considers it a
verb in the second person: he connects the first line with the preceding
verse, and renders thus what follows, —

<span id="v.xxiii-p14"></span>Thou hast devised thy whoredom upon the
hills,  
In the fields I have seen thine abominations.

<span id="v.xxiii-p15"></span>The simplicity of this order recommends
it, but the former seems preferable. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[102](cc18004.htm#fr_101.md) <span
id="v.xxiii-p19.6"></span>

<span id="v.xxiii-p20"></span> The meaning seems to be right, but it is
better to construe <span id="v.xxiii-p20.1"></span>אחרי, “after,” with
these words, —

<span id="v.xxiii-p21"></span>Woe to thee, Jerusalem! thou wilt not be
cleansed  
After what time *wilt it* yet *be?*

<span id="v.xxiii-p22"></span>Literally it may be rendered, “After when
yet?” — *Ed*.
