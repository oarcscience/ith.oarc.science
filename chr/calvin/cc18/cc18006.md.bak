<span id="vii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 15

<span id="vii.i"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p1"></span><span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p2"></span>**l**. Then said the LORD unto me, Though
Moses and Samuel stood before me, *yet* my mind *could* not *be* toward
this people: cast *them* out of my sight, and let them go forth.

<span id="vii.i-p3"></span>**1**. Et dixit Jehova ad me, Si steterint
Moses et Samuel coram facie mea, non est anima *(id est* cor meum) ad
populum hunc; emitte a facie mea et exeant.

<span id="vii.i-p4"></span>**2**. And it shall come to pass, if they say
unto thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus
saith the LORD; Such as *are* for death, to death; and such as *are* for
the sword, to the sword; and such as *are* for the famine, to the
famine; and such as *are* for the captivity, to the captivity.

<span id="vii.i-p5"></span>**2**. Et erit, si dixerint tibi, Quo
exibimus? *(vel,* egrediemur) tunc dices illis, Sic dicit Jehova, Qui ad
mortem, ad mortem, et qui ad gladium, ad gladium, et qui ad famem, ad
famem, et qui ad captivitatem, ad captivitatem.

<span id="vii.i-p6"></span> 

<span id="vii.i-p7"></span><span id="vii.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p8"></span>God again repeats what we have before
observed, — that as the impieties and sins of the people had arrived at
the highest pitch, there was no more room for pardon or for mercy: and
though God seems to have rejected altogether the prayer of his servant,
we are not yet to think that it was without any benefit. Jeremiah wished
indeed to deliver the whole people from destruction; but he did not thus
pray inconsiderately and uselessly; for he distinguished between the
titular church, as they say, and the chosen seed, for he knew that many
were become the degenerated children of Abraham: nor was he unacquainted
with what is said in the Psalms,

<span id="vii.i-p9"></span>“Who shall dwell in thy tabernacle, and who
shall stand on the mount of thy holiness?  
He who is innocent as to his hands, and is of a pure heart.” (<span
id="vii.i-p9.2"></span>[Ps. 15:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#002)<span id="vii.i-p9.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.i-p10"></span>The Prophet there distinctly shews that
hypocrites glory in vain, because they had a free entrance into the
Temple, and sacrificed together with the faithful; for a clean heart and
pure hands are required. Jeremiah no doubt fully understood this.

<span id="vii.i-p11"></span>Though then he extended his solicitude to
the whole body of the people, he yet knew that there was a chosen seed.
So at this day, when we pray, we ought, according to the rule of
charity, to include all, for we cannot fix on those whom God has chosen
or whom he has rejected; and thus we ought, as far as we can, to promote
the salvation of all; and yet we know, as a general truth, that many are
reprobate for whom our prayers will avail nothing; we know this, and yet
we cannot point out any one as by the finger. So then the prayer of
Jeremiah was not useless; but in its very form, as they say, it was not
heard, for he wished the whole people to be saved; but as God had
resolved to destroy the ungodly, such as were beyond the reach of hope
on account of their untamable obstinacy, Jeremiah obtained only in part
what he prayed for, — that God would preserve his Church, which then was
in a manner hidden.

<span id="vii.i-p12"></span>But it is now said, *If stand before me did
Moses and Samuel,*  <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) *my soul
would not be towards this people* The meaning is, that though all
intercessors came forth in their behalf, they could do nothing, for God
had rejected them. Moses and Samuel are here mentioned, but in another
place Job and Daniel are named, and for the same reason. (<span
id="vii.i-p15.1"></span>[Eze
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014)<span id="vii.i-p15.1"></span>.md)
Moses is mentioned here, because we find that he offered himself, and
wished to be, an anathema for his people.

<span id="vii.i-p16"></span>“Blot me out of the book of life, or spare
this people.” (<span id="vii.i-p16.1"></span>[Ex
32:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#032)<span id="vii.i-p16.1"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.i-p17"></span>As then God’s wrath had been so often
pacified by Moses, he is here mentioned; for when it was all over with
the people, he delivered them as it were from eternal death, and this
was well and commonly known to the Jews. As to Samuel, we know how
celebrated he was, and that God had been often pacified by him for the
preservation of the whole people; but at length, when he prayed for
Saul, God did indeed restrain his immoderate zeal, and forbade him to
pray any more, (<span id="vii.i-p17.1"></span>[1Sa
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#001)<span id="vii.i-p17.1"></span>.md)
and yet he ceased not to pray. As then there was so great a fervor in
Samuel, that he in a manner struggled with God, he is here joined with
Moses: *“If*, then, *stand before me did* these two, *my soul,* or my
heart, would be alienated from this people, for I shall be no more
pacified towards them.”

<span id="vii.i-p18"></span>But he speaks of the perverse multitude,
which had so often wilfully sought their own destruction; for, as it has
appeared elsewhere, the people had never been rejected; and yet we must
distinguish between the chaff and the wheat. Judea was, as it were, the
threshing — floor of God, on which there was a great heap of chaff, for
the multitude had departed from true religion; and there were a few
grains found hid in the rubbish. Hence the heart of God was not towards
the people, that is, towards the degenerated children of Abraham, who
were proud only of their name, while they were covenant — breakers; for
they had long ago forsaken the true worship of God and all integrity.
Therefore the heart of God was not towards them. At the same time he
preserved, in a wonderful and in a hidden manner, a remnant.

<span id="vii.i-p19"></span>Now this passage teaches us what James also
mentions, that the prayer of the righteous avails much with God; and he
brings forward the example of Elijah, who closed heaven by his prayer,
so that it rained not for a long time; and who afterwards opened heaven
by his prayer, so as to obtain rain from God. (<span
id="vii.i-p19.1"></span>[Jas
5:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#016)<span id="vii.i-p19.1"></span>.md)
He hence infers that the prayers of the righteous avail much, not only
when they pray for themselves, but also when they pray for others; for
Elijah had no particular regard for himself, but his object was to gain
relief for the whole people. It is indeed certain that the intercession
of the saints is highly appreciated by God; and hence it is that we are
bidden winingly and freely to make known to one another our necessities,
so that we may mutually help and pray for one another. But we must at
the same time observe, that they who think themselves to be commended to
God by others in their prayers, ought not on that account to become more
secure; for it is certain, that as the prayers of the faithful avail the
members of Christ, so they do no good to the ungodly and the hypocrites.
Nor does God indeed bid us to acquiesce in the confidence, that others
pray for us, but bids every one to pray, and also to join their prayers
with those of all the members of the ChurJeremiah Whosoever then desires
to profit by the prayers of the saints must also pray himself.

<span id="vii.i-p20"></span>It is true, I allow, that the prayers of the
saints sometimes benefit even the ungodly and aliens; for it was not in
vain that Christ prayed,

<span id="vii.i-p21"></span>“Father, forgive them, for they know not
what they do,” (<span id="vii.i-p21.1"></span>[Lu
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034)<span id="vii.i-p21.1"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.i-p22"></span>nor did Stephen pray in vain when he offered
up a similar prayer,  
(<span id="vii.i-p22.2"></span>[Ac
7:60](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060)<span id="vii.i-p22.2"></span>.md)
and I am disposed to agree with what *Augustine* says, that Paul, among
others, was the effect of Stephen’s prayer. (Serm. 1, de Sanctis) But I
am speaking now of what we must do when we find that we are helped by
the prayers of the saints, that is, that we are strenuously to perform
our part, and strive to shew for our brethren the same solicitude and
care as we expect from them. It is then certain beyond a doubt, that
each is not only heard when he prays for himself, but that the prayers
of the saints avail in behalf of others.

<span id="vii.i-p23"></span>But extremely ridiculous are the Papists,
who apply this passage to dead saints: Moses and Samuel, they say, were
dead, when God declared what is here said; it is then true that they
prayed. The inference is worthy of such teachers, which is as good as
the braying of an ass. There is here a supposition made, as though God
did say, “If Moses and Samuel were now alive and interceded for them, I
would yet remain implacable.” But Ezekiel mentions Daniel, who was then
living, and he names also Job. We hence see that he makes no distinction
between the dead and the living. Therefore the Papists are extremely
foolish and stupid when they thus idly prate that the dead pray for the
living, on the ground of what is here said of Moses and Samuel. It is
not then worthwhile to refute this ignorant assertion, as it vanishes
almost of itself: a brief warning, lest ally one should be deluded by
such a cavil, is sufficient.  <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md)

<span id="vii.i-p27"></span>He afterwards bids the Prophet to east away
the people; *cast them away,* or banish them, he says, *from my
presence* He doubtless speaks here in a strong manner, “Let them be gone
from me.” But yet God shews what he had commanded his Prophet; as though
he had said, “Fulfil thou thine office, remember what burden I have laid
on thee.” Jeremiah had been ordered to denounce exile on the people? he
was the herald of divine vengeance. As then he sustained this office, it
was his duty to execute the commission which God had given him. We now
then apprehend what these words mean, *cast them away*  <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md)

<span id="vii.i-p33"></span>But we must again notice here what we have
before seen, — that God commends the efficacy of prophetic doctrine,
according to what has been said,

<span id="vii.i-p34"></span>“I set thee over nations and kingdoms, to
plant and to root up, to build and to destroy,” (<span
id="vii.i-p34.1"></span>[Jer 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010.md)<span
id="vii.i-p34.1"></span>)

<span id="vii.i-p35"></span>Then God intimates, that so great a power
would be in the mouth of his servant, that though the Jews mocked at his
predictions, as if they were vain threatenings to frighten children,
they would yet be like thunderbolts; so that Jeremiah would drive away
the people, as though he was furnished with a large army and great
forces, according to what Paul declares, — that he had power given him
to cast down every height that exalted itself against Christ. (<span
id="vii.i-p35.1"></span>[2Co 10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005.md)<span
id="vii.i-p35.1"></span>) As then God claims so great an authority for
his prophetic doctrine, when threatening the unbelieving with
punishment, let us know that the same extends to all the promises of
salvation. Therefore, whenever God offers grace to us by the gospel, and
testifies that he will be propitious to us, let us know that heaven is
in a manner open to us; and let us not seek any other ground of
assurance than his own testimony: and why? because as to the prophets
was given the power of binding and loosing, so now the same power is
given to the Church, that is, to invite all to be saved who are as yet
healable, and to denounce eternal ruin on the reprobate and the
obstinate in their wickedness, according to what is said by Christ,

<span id="vii.i-p36"></span>“Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be
bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed
in heaven.” (<span id="vii.i-p36.1"></span>[Matt.
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md), [Matt.
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018)<span id="vii.i-p36.1"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.i-p37"></span>For he gave his Apostles the power not only
of binding, but also of loosing. And Paul, after having spoken in high
terms of the former power, adds,

<span id="vii.i-p38"></span>“When your obedience shall be
accomplished,”  
(<span id="vii.i-p38.2"></span>[2Co
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#006)<span id="vii.i-p38.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.i-p39"></span>as though he had said, that the gospel was
not preached only for this end, to pronounce death on the reprobate, but
that it was also a pledge of salvation to all the elect, to them who
embraced by true faith the promises offered to them.

<span id="vii.i-p40"></span><span id="vii.i-p40.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p41"></span>He now confirms the previous sentence, *If
they shall say, Whither shall we go forth? then shalt thou say to them,
Those for death, to death; those for the sword, to the sword; those for
the famine, to the famine; those for exile, to exile;* as though he had
said, “In vain do they complain of their own miseries.” For God, no
doubt, had in view the clamorous complaints which prevailed everywhere
among the people on account of their very heavy calamities. Thus indeed
were hypocrites wont to do; for whenever God spared them, they haughtily
insulted the prophets, and boastingly alleged their subsidies and
fortresses; but when God’s hand pressed hard on them, they became very
eloquent in their complaints: “Alas! how far will God go at length? is
there to be never an end? and what does all this mean? why does he so
severely afflict us? and why does he not at least relieve us in some
measure from our ntiseries?” As then the hypocrites were so querulous in
their calamities, God anticipates all these expostulations, and says,
“If they say to thee, ‘Where shall we flee?’ say to them, ‘Either to
death, or to famine, or to the sword, or to exile;’ it is all one with
God, and it matters not; for there is no hope of mercy for you any
longer, since God has rejected you: know then that it is all over with
you, for there is no deliverance for you from God: either the sword, or
famine, or some other kind of death will overtake you; ye are in every
way past hope.”

<span id="vii.ii"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vii.ii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou art
graciously pleased to exhort us to repent, and withholdest thine hand,
yea, and allowest us the opportunity to repent, — O grant, that we may
not obstinately provoke against ourselves thy extreme vengeance, but
render ourselves obedient to thee, so that thou mayest not only hear
others praying for us, but that our own prayers may also obtain pardon
from thee, espedally through the intercession of Christ, thine only —
begotten Son, who has once for all reconciled thee to us, and whose
perpetual intercession is to continue to reconcile us to thee, until we
shall appear at length before thee with all our spots and filth wholly
washed away, and be made partakers of that glory which has been obtained
for us by Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="vii.iii"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p1"></span>Lecture Fifty-Ninth

<span id="vii.iv"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#003.md)<span id="vii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p2"></span>**3**. And I will appoint over them four
kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the
fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.

<span id="vii.iv-p3"></span>**3**. Et praeliciam super eos quatuor
familias, dicit Jehova, gladium ad occidendum, et canes ad trahendum, et
avem coelorum et bestiam terrae, ad comedendum et perdendum.

<span id="vii.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv-p5"></span><span id="vii.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p6"></span>Jeremiah proceeds with the same subject. He
said yesterday that the people were no longer cared for by God, and so
that nothing remained for them but in various ways to perish, and that
the last punishment would be exile. He now confirms the same thing, and
says, that God would prepare against them ravenous birds as well as wild
beasts, the sword and dogs  <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) as
though he had said, that all animals would be hostile to them, and be
the executioners of God’s vengeance.

<span id="vii.iv-p8"></span>Some render the verb <span
id="vii.iv-p8.1"></span>פקד, *pekod,* to visit, but improperly, as I
think; for they must give this version, “I will visit four families upon
them;” but there is no sense in this, nor can any sense be elicited from
it. The meaning most suitable here is to set over,  <span
id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) “I will set over them four kinds;”
which he calls “four families.” And there is to be understood here a
contrast: as they thought it hard to obey God, they were now to have
over them dogs and wild beasts, and the birds of the air, and the sword.
The meaning is, that there would be no end to God’s vengeance, and to
various punishments, until the Jews were wholly destroyed. He further
intimates, that he would have in readiness many to execute his wrath, as
he had all creatures under his control. As then he would employ in his
service dogs, and birds, and animals, as well as men, it behoved the
Jews to feel assured that they in vain had recourse to this or that
refuge. We indeed know that men impiously confine the power of God, both
with regard to their salvation and the punishment of their sins, for
when he passes by any evil they think that they have escaped, and
promise themselves impunity, as though God indeed were not able every
moment to inflict many and various scourges. This then is the reason why
the Prophet speaks here of four kinds of judgments. It follows —

<span id="vii.v"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p1"></span><span id="vii.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004.md)<span id="vii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p2"></span>**4**. And I will cause them to be removed
into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah
king of Judah, for *that* which he did in Jerusalem.

<span id="vii.v-p3"></span>**4**. Et ponam eos in commotionem omnibus
regnis terrae propter Manasse, filium Ezechiae, regem Jehudah, *(vel,*
regis Jehudah, *parum interest,)* propter ea quae fecit in Jerusalem.

<span id="vii.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.v-p5"></span><span id="vii.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p6"></span>Jeremiah speaks now of exile. He had hitherto
spoken of the sword and famine, and mentioned also other punishments,
that their carcases would be dragged about by dogs, and also devoured by
wild beasts and ravenous birds; but he now refers to one kind of
punishment only — that God would drive them into exile. And he seems to
have taken these words from Moses, for so he speaks in <span
id="vii.v-p6.1"></span>[De 28](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#000.md)<span
id="vii.v-p6.1"></span>, except that <span id="vii.v-p6.2"></span>ו,
*vau,* is placed before <span id="vii.v-p6.3"></span>ע, *ain,* in the
word “commotion,” but such a change is common. In other respects there
is a perfect agreement.

<span id="vii.v-p7"></span>*I will set them,* he says, *for a commotion
to all the kingdoms of the earth;* that is, I will cause them to wander
in constant fear and trembling. He amplifies the grievousness of exile
by the circumstance that they should have no safe rest. They who leave
their country for exile do at least find some corner where they take
breath; but God declares that the Jews would be everywhere unsettled and
wanderers, so that no place would receive them. And hence God’s
vengeance became more fully manifest, for these miserable men never
found an asylum when scattered through various countries. Though they
had habitations in those parts allotted to them by the king of Babylon,
they were yet everywhere without any rest. It was not therefore in vain
that Moses threatened them with such a punishment, nor was it to no
purpose that Jeremiah repeated what had been said by Moses.  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md)

<span id="vii.v-p17"></span>He adds the cause, *On account of Manasseh*
But Manasseh was now dead, why then did God transfer the vengeance which
he merited to posterity? And this seems inconsistent with another
passage found in Ezekiel,

<span id="vii.v-p18"></span>“The soul that sinneth it shall die.” (<span
id="vii.v-p18.1"></span>[Eze 18:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#008.md)<span
id="vii.v-p18.1"></span>)

<span id="vii.v-p19"></span>But doubtless God justly punished the
wickedness of the people even after the death of that ungodly king, for
they ceased not to accumulate evils on evils; as however their impiety
appeared especially at that time, he particularly noticed it, that the
Jews might understand that they had been long worthy of destruction, and
that punishment was not delayed except through the great mercy of God,
who had not immediately treated them as they deserved. The Prophet
therefore commends the long forbearance of God because their ruin was
suspended until that time. And, on the other hand, he shews that they
were not so severely treated but that they were worthy of greater and
more atrocious punishment; for such had been their obstinacy that they
did all they could to draw upon themselves destruction many times.

<span id="vii.v-p20"></span>But another question arises: Manasseh
pretended repentance, and God seemed to have forgiven him and the whole
people, (<span id="vii.v-p20.1"></span>[2Ki
21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2021.htm#000.md)<span id="vii.v-p20.1"></span>:<span
id="vii.v-p20.2"></span>[2Ch
33:12](../../../bib/kjv/ch2033.htm#012)<span id="vii.v-p20.2"></span>.md)
why does he now declare that he would take vengeance on sins which had
been already buried? But the answer is evident, for the Jews from that
time had been in no way better. As then they had continued to pursue the
same sinful courses with Manasseh, it was right that they should at
length be rewarded as they deserved; for, had they become really
changed, there would have been a change in God’s dealings with them, but
inasmuch as their impiety had ever remained the same, and as they gave
themselves up to the same vices, a heavier judgment was nigh them, and
justly so, because they had abused God’s forbearance, who had spared the
king as well as themselves on the condition of receiving the pardon
offered to them. But since they had hardened themselves, it was riglit
to take such account of their ingratitude and perverseness as to treat
them with greater severity.

<span id="vii.v-p21"></span>Farther, Manasseh is called the *son* of
Hezekiah, and that for the purpose of enhancing his crime. For as
religion had been reformed in the time of Hezekiah, and as that pious
king, with great labor and toil, exerted all his powers to restore the
true worship of God, it was the duty of Manasseh to follow his example.
But he not only built altars to idols, and polluted the whole land with
superstitions, but also defiled the very Temple of God. It was thus a
horrible, and wholly a diabolical madness in the son, when the right way
of worshipping God had been delivered unto him, to be of such a
reprobate mind as immediately to overthrow what his father with great
labor has so faithfully established. This then was the reason why
Jeremiah mentioned to his dishonor the name of his father. And hence we
learn that they are worthy of a heavier punishment, who have been
religiously brought up from their childhood, and become afterwards
degenerated, who, having had pious and godly parents, afterwards abandon
themselves to every wickedness. Hence a heavier judgment awaits those
who depart from the examples of godly fathers. And this we gather from
the very words of the Prophet, who here, by way of reproach, calls
Manasseh the *son of Hezekiah,* which yet would have been to his honor,
had he been like his father and followed his piety.

<span id="vii.v-p22"></span>And at the same time there is no doubt but
that the Prophet indirectly condemns the whole people; for we know how
great opposition pious Hezekiah met with, and how he contended for the
faithful worship of God, as though he had been among the Assyrians or
the Egyptians. But the perverseness of the people appeared then extreme,
when he was put in jeopardy as to the kingdom, because he endeavored to
cleanse the land of Judah from its filth and pollutions; their impiety
and ingratitude then shewed, and openly discovered themselves.
Afterwards Manasseh overturned as it were in an instant the worship of
God, and they all, with great exultation, went immediately after
superstition. We hence see that the mouths of the Jews were thus closed,
so that they could not object and say, that they obeyed the command of
their king; for they winingly followed wicked superstitions. They
assented to the king of their own accord, while yet they hardly, and
with great unwiningness, were led to obey when God’s worship was
restored in the time of Hezekiah.

<span id="vii.v-p23"></span>But Manasseh added cruelties to
superstitions; for we know that he not only covered the streets of the
city with blood, but made it also to flow in streams, as sacred history
relates. As, then, the Prophets were so cruelly treated in the time of
Manasseh, and as he was not the sole author of this barbarity, but the
true servants of God were persecuted to death by the consent of the
people, it was hence evident that it was the crime of the whole
community. And hence he mentions *Jerusalem,* in order that the Jews
might know that the holy city, in which they gloried, had been for a
long time the den of robbers, and that the Temple of God had been
polluted by wicked superstitions, and even the whole city by unlawful
and barbarous slaughters. It now follows —

<span id="vii.vi"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p6"></span> 

<span id="vii.vi-p7"></span><span id="vii.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p8"></span>The Prophet shews here that the severe
punishment of which he had spoken could not be deemed unjust, according
to what those men thought who were querulous, and ever expostulated with
God, and charged him with too much rigour. Lest, then, the Jews should
complain, the Prophet says briefly, that all the evils which were nigh
at hand were fully due, and so deserved, that they could find no pity,
even among men. We know that the worst of men, when the Lord punishes
them, have some to condole with them. There is no one so wicked that
relatives do not favor him, and that some do not console him. But the
Prophet shews that the Jews were not only inexcusable before God, but
that they were undeserving of any sympathy from men.

<span id="vii.vi-p9"></span>He first says, *Who will pity thee?* and
then, *Who will console with thee?* The verb. <span
id="vii.vi-p9.1"></span>נוד, *nud,* means properly to give comfort by
words, as when relatives, and friends, and neighbors meet together for
the purpose of mourning; they hear lamentations, and join in them. But
he says that no one would perform this office towards Jerusalem. He
adds, in the third place, *And who will turn aside?* or, strictly,
change place — Who *will change place to enquire?* or, as some render
it, to pray. The verb <span id="vii.vi-p9.2"></span>שאל *shal,* means
properly to ask, and hence sometimes to pray. So, many give this
meaning, that there would be no one to pray for the Jews. But if we
consider the construction of the sentence, we shall see that the Prophet
speaks of that duty of kindness which men cultivate and observe towards
one another, by enquiring of their *welfare,* — “Are all things well
with thee?” How dost thou do? Are all things well with thee and thine?”
When we thus enquire of the state of any one we shew some concern for
him, for love is always solicitous for the welfare of others. The
Prophet then says, “Who will turn aside to thee to enquire of thy
welfare?” that is, that he may know how thou art, and what is thy state
and condition.

<span id="vii.vi-p10"></span>We hence see that the Jews are here
divested of every complaint, for the whole world would acknowledge them
to be unworthy of any commiseration. But the Prophet does not mean that
all would act cruelly towards Jerusalem, but rather shews, that such
were their crimes that there was no room for courtesy, or for those acts
of kindness which men of themselves perform towards one another.  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md)

<span id="vii.vi-p15"></span><span id="vii.vi-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p16"></span>Then follows the reason — *For thou hast
forsaken me, saith Jehovah* Since, then, God had been rejected by the
Jews, did not such a defection bring its deserved reward, when they were
deprived of every human aid? He afterwards adds, *Backward hast thou
gone* He intimates that there was a continuance in their wicked
defection; for they not only forgot God for a time, but departed far
from him, so as to become wholly alienated.

<span id="vii.vi-p17"></span>It then follows — *And I will stretch out,
etc.*; that is, “therefore will I stretch out,” etc.; for the copulative
is to be taken here as an inative. This may be viewed as in the past or
the future tense; for God had in a measure already afflicted the people;
but heavier judgments awaited them. I am inclined to regard it as a
prediction of what was to come, as it immediately follows, *I am weary
with repenting,* that is, “I have so often repented that I cannot
possibly be induced now to forgive; for I see that I have been so often
deceived, that I camlot hear to be deceived any longer.” Some, indeed,
give this version, — “I am weary with consoling myself,” and <span
id="vii.vi-p17.1"></span>נחם, *nuchem,* means both; but the other sense
seems to me the most suitable. I doubt not then but that the Prophet
means repentance. We indeed know that God changes not his purpose; for
men repent because their expectation often disappoints them, when things
happen otherwise than they had thought; but no such thing can happen to
God; and he is said to repent according to our apprehensions. God then
repents of his severity whenever he mitigates it towards his people,
whenever he withdraws his hand from executing his vengeance, whenever he
forgives sins. And this had been often done to the Jews; but they had
made a mock of such mercy, and the oftener God spared them the more
audaciously did they provoke his wrath. Hence he says, “I am weary with
repenting so often;” that is, that he had so often spared them and
suspended his judgment.  <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md)

<span id="vii.vi-p23"></span>In short, he deprives the Jews of every
excuse, and shews that they acted impiously when they murmured against
God, for they allowed no place to his mercy; nay, whenever they found
him recentliable they abused his forbearance with extreme indignity and
perverseness. It follows —

<span id="vii.vii"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p1"></span><span id="vii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p2"></span>**7**. And I will fan them with a fan in
the gates of the land; I will bereave *them* of children, I will destroy
my people, *since* they return not from their ways.

<span id="vii.vii-p3"></span>**7**. Et ventilabo ventilabro ipsos in
omnibus portis terrae, *(id est,* per omnes portas;) orbavi, perdidi
populum meum; viis suis non recesserunt *(vel,* non reversi sunt, *vel,*
non sunt conversi.)

<span id="vii.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.vii-p5"></span><span id="vii.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p6"></span>He confirms here the same truth. The verb
which I have rendered in the future may be rendered in the past tense,
but I still think it to be a prediction of what was to come. But as to
what follows, *I have bereaved, I have destroyed,* it must, I have no
doubt, be referred to time past.

<span id="vii.vii-p7"></span>He then says, *I will fan* or scatter
*them,* for the verb. <span id="vii.vii-p7.1"></span>זרה *zare,* means
to scatter, but as *with a fan* follows, (the word is derived from the
same root) I wish to retain the repetition. Then it is, *I will fan them
with a fan* through *all the gates of the earth* Many give the meaning,
“through the cities,” which I do not approve, as it seems a frigid
explanation. On the contrary the Prophet means by “the gates of the
earth,” all countries, for the Jews thought that they should be always
safe and quiet in their own cities. By taking a part for the whole,
gates do indeed, as it appears elsewhere, signify cities; but as the
Jews trusted in their own defences, and thought that they could never be
drawn out from these quiet nests, the word gates is in a striking manner
transferred to signify any kind of exit; *I will fan* you, says God, but
where? *through all gates of the earth,* or through all countries and
through all deserts; wherever there is a region open for you there you
must pass through. Ye are wont to pass in and out through your gates,
and ye have there your quiet homes, but there shall be hereafter to you
other cities, other gates, even all countries and all deserts, all ways,
and, in short, every sort of passage.  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md)

<span id="vii.vii-p9"></span>Then follows, *I have bereaved, I have
destroyed my people; they have not returned from their own ways* Here no
doubt he condemns the Jews for their sottishhess, because they had not
repented after having been warned by grievous judgments, which God had
executed partly on them and partly on their brethren. For the kingdom of
Israel had been cut off: when they saw the ten tribes driven into exile
ought they not to have been terrified by such an example? Hence also
another Prophet says,

<span id="vii.vii-p10"></span>“There is no one who mourns for the
bruising of Joseph.” (<span id="vii.vii-p10.1"></span>[Am
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#006)<span id="vii.vii-p10.1"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.vii-p11"></span>God had set before their eyes a sad and
dreadful spectacle; they ought then to have acknowledged in the
destruction of Israel what they themselves deserved, and to have turned
to God. It is then this extreme hardness that God upbraids them with,
for though he had bereaved his people, the ten tribes, and destroyed
them, and though also the kingdom of Judah had been in a great measure
depressed, yet they returned not from their own ways. It hence appeared
more fully evident that they deserved the severest judgments, as they
were become wholly irreclaimable. He then adds —

<span id="vii.viii"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p1"></span><span id="vii.viii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p2"></span>**8**. Their widows are increased to me
above the sand of the seas: I have brought upon them against the mother
of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused *him* to fall upon
it suddenly, and terrors upon the city.

<span id="vii.viii-p3"></span>**8**. Multiplicatae sunt mihi viduae ejus

super matrem juvenis *(id est,* super turmam, *vel,* multitudinem
juvenum) vastatorem in meridie; et projeci (cadere feci, *ad verbum)*
super ipsam repente tumultum et terrores, *(quanquam de his vocibus
postea erit aliquid dicendum.)*

<span id="vii.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.viii-p5"></span><span id="vii.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p6"></span>He says first, *Multiplied have been his
widows;* because the men had been almost all kined, in battle. If the
Prophet is the speaker, the particle <span id="vii.viii-p6.1"></span>לי
*li,* is redundant, but if the words be referred to God, we know that
the people were in such a way under the government of God that he calls
the widows his, as he calls the children his who were born Israelites.
But in this there is no great importance, only that if we consider God
to be speaker the sense will be this, “Behold, it is by no means unknown
to me how numerous his widows are: as then I am merciful I have not
heedlessly and without reason suffered such slaughters among the
people.” The Prophet intended to shew that so great was the obstinacy of
the Jews that they struggled against all the judgments of God; and it is
a proof of dreadful impiety when men rush on heedlessly and pay no
attention to any punishments. And this is what the Prophet means when he
says that the *widows* were multiplied. And he adds, *More than the sand
of the sea* This was surely a strange thing; so many slaughters were
presented to their view that their great perverseness might become more
evident, and yet he says that they were not moved.

<span id="vii.viii-p7"></span>What follows must be applied to God, *I
have made to come to them, on the troop of youths, a waster*  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) This is an explanation of the former
clause, as though he had said, “The reason why there are so many widows
is, because God has destroyed all the men.” As the Jews might have
ascribed this to their enemies, God declares that he was the author of
all the slaughters which they had suffered. He then shews that these
slaughters were not fortuitous as men suppose who think that fortune
prevails mostly in war, for they do not ascribe so much to the wisdom
and valor of men as to fortune, being ignorant of the Providence of God.
Here then God shews that the whole of the flower of the people had been
indeed cut off by the swords of enemies, but that the Chaldeans or the
Assyrians had not come of their own accord, or by an impulse of their
own, but by a hidden impulse, and that of God, who had resolved to
punish that irreclaimable people. This then is the reason why God not
only speaks of a waster, but also intimates that the enemies were
impelled by his influence, and carried on the war as it were under his
banner, authority, and guidance.

<span id="vii.viii-p9"></span>He says, *at mid-day,* even when the Jews
might have exercised greater watchfulness. But he shews that he was
against them, for they were not taken by the craft of their enemies, as
had often been the case, nor were they surprised by secret designs, but
their enemies attacked them openly and boldly, even at the time when
many of their cities were fortified, and the people thought that they
had sufficient defences. As the enemies then dared to assail them in the
middle of the day, (for such is the meaning of the Hebrew word) and
during the clearest light, it was certainly a fuller proof of God’s
vengeance; for under such a circumstance the contrivance and counsel of
men were not so evident, but the hand of God, which he stretched forth
from heaven as it were in an open and visible manner.

<span id="vii.viii-p10"></span>He afterwards adds, *And I have cast,* or
caused to fall, *upon them suddenly;* some say, the city; others, the
enemy; and <span id="vii.viii-p10.1"></span>עיר *oir,* means a city, and
sometimes an enemy; but another explanation seems more probable, that
God had sent on them a tumult and terrors, for the word <span
id="vii.viii-p10.2"></span>עיר, *oir,* conms from the verb <span
id="vii.viii-p10.3"></span>עור, *our,* which signifies to excite. It may
therefore be taken for tumult, and this sense I prefer, for they who
render the word city, are constrained to adopt a forced and far-fetched
explanation, “To fall have I made suddenly the city,” that is, cities,
“upon them.” There is first a change of number, and then, to fall have I
made cities, that is, the ruins of cities, upon them, seems an unnatural
phrase; but the sense would be most suitable were we to render the word
tumult, for what immediately follows is, *and terrors* Some however
render the word <span id="vii.viii-p10.4"></span>בהלות, *belut,*
adverbially *suddenly,* and consider that the same thing is said twice.
He had said just before, “I have cast upon her suddenly;” but now he
says, “hastenings.” Such is the version, but not suitable, for the two
words <span id="vii.viii-p10.5"></span>עיר *oir,* and <span
id="vii.viii-p10.6"></span>בהלות, *belut,* are joined together. I
therefore give this simple explanation — that the Jews were suddenly
smitten with despair because they thought that their enemies were afar
off, and that they had to apprehend no danger. Then it is, *suddenly
have I sent upon them a tumult and terrors*  <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) He then adds —

<span id="vii.ix-p5"></span><span id="vii.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ix-p6"></span>He proceeds with his narrative; he says,
that fruitful women had been weakened, not as we see to be often the
case, for by frequent child — bearing we know the strength of women is
diminished; but here he speaks of the strength which mothers derive from
their children; for a numerous offspring is the support of mothers. She
then who has many children seems strong, as she is by so many shields
defended. As then mothers were wont to place much dependence on their
offspring, he says that they were weakened as to their strength when
they were bereaved of all their children, as though they had been
barren.

<span id="vii.ix-p7"></span>He afterwards adds, that the *soul,* the
people, *had expired;* for he speaks not here of women, but of the whole
people. For it afterwards follows, *Set hath her sun while it was yet
day;* that is, when prosperity seemed certain, God suddenly involved
them in adversity, and as it were surrounded them with darkness, when
they thought that prosperous fortune was slhining on them. He at last
says, that they were *confounded and ashamed;* and at the same time he
declares, that he would give all who remained to the sword before their
enemies; as though he had said, “They have not yet suffered all the
punishment allotted to them, for they are not subdued, though I have
heavily and severely chastised them; as then they are incurable, the
sword shall destroy the remainder; for my vengeance shall not cease to
pursue them, until I shall utterly consume them.  <span

spirit be so influenced by thy threatenings as to anticipate that

been visited; and may we so endeavor by true repentance to obtain thy
favor, that we may receive thy daily blessings and benefits, until we
shall at length come to the full and real enjoyment of all those

<span id="vii.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.xii-p5"></span><span id="vii.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xii-p6"></span>The Prophet, when he saw that his labor
availed nothing, or was not so fruitful as he wished, no doubt felt
somewhat like a man, and shewed his own weakness. It must however be
observed, that he was so restrained by the secret power of the Holy
Spirit, that he did not break forth intemperately, as is the case with
many; but, he kept the right end so in view, that his sorrows had ever a
regard to his object, even to render his labor useful to the people. A
clear example of which is seen in these words.

<span id="vii.xii-p7"></span>But he addresses his mother, as though he
counted his own life a curse; what does this mean? “Why,” he says, “hast
thou begotten me, my mother? Woe to me, that I have been born a man of
strife and of contention!” We learn from these words, that the Prophet
was not so composed and calm in his mind, but that he felt angry when he
saw that he effected less than he wished; and yet it is evident from the
context, that all this was expressed for the benefit of the public, even
that the Jews might know, that their hardness of heart in despising
God’s devoted servant, yea, in maliciously opposing him, would not turn
out to their benefit. This is the purport of the whole.

<span id="vii.xii-p8"></span>He calls himself a *man of strife,* not
only because he was constrained to contend with the people, for this he
had in common with all prophets. God does not send them to flatter or to
please the world; they must therefore contend with the world, for no one
is brought to a right state, so as to undertake the yoke of God winingly
and submissively, until he is proved guilty. Hence men will never obey
God, they will never submit to his word, until they know that they are
in a manner condemned; and for this reason have I said, that this evil
is common to all prophets, — that they have to contend with the world.
But Jeremiah calls himself a *man of strife and contention,* because he
was slanderously spoken of throughout Judea, as one who through his
moroseness drove the whole people to contentions and strifes. This then
is to be referred to the false judgments formed by the people; for there
was hardly any one who did not say that he was a turbulent man, and that
if he was removed, there would have been tranquinity in the city and
throughout the whole land. The same objection is at this day made by the
enemies of the truth and godliness; they say, that we needlessly create
disturbances, and that if we were quiet, there would be the most
delightful peace throughout the whole world, and that dissensions and
strifes arise only from us, that we are the fans by which the whole
world is kindled into contentions. It was then for this reason that
Jeremiah complained that he was born a man of strife and contention; not
that he was contentious — not that that he gave any occasion to the
people to speak so slanderously of him; for the subject here is not
respecting the character of the Prophet, as he knew that his courage was
approved by God; but as he saw that he was urged and charged with these
false accusations, he calls himself *a man of strife and a man of
contention;* the last word is from <span id="vii.xii-p8.1"></span>דן,
*den,* which means to contend.

<span id="vii.xii-p9"></span>But as to the exclamation respecting his
*mother,* I have already reminded you that it was an evidence of an
intemperate feeling; for had he spoken in a composed state of mind, what
had he to do with his mother, so as to make her an associate in the evil
he complains of? He indeed seems to ascribe a part of the blame to his
mother, because she had given him birth. Now this appears unreasonable.
But it may at the same time be easily gathered, that the Prophet was not
led away by so great a vehemence, except for the sake of promoting the
public good, and that it was for this end that he uttered his complaint;
for it was not his purpose to condemn his mother, though at the first
view it appears so; but though she was innocent, he still shews that he
was unjustly loaded with such calumnies, as that he was a man of strife
and contention; as though he had said, “Enquire of my mother, who hath
begotten me, whether I was contentious from the womb? has my mother been
the cause why ye say that I am a turbulent man and the author of
strifes? Doubtless nothing can be imputed to my mother; and I am as
innocent as she is.” We now then see that the Prophet indirectly
condemns the wickedness of the people, because they calumniated him, as
though he moved tumults and strifes through the whole land; and this he
more fully confirms by the words which follow: —

<span id="vii.xii-p10"></span>*I have not given on usury, nor have they
borrowed of me on usury;*  <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) *yet
every one curses me* He shews here that it was not for a private reason
that he was hated by the whole people and loaded with calumnies: for
whence come hatreds, and strifes, and complaints, and quarrels, and
contentions among men, except through unfair dealing in their
intercourse with one another? When, therefore, every one is bent on his
own private advantage, he in bears anything to be taken from him. It is
indeed a rare thing in the world, that they who carry on business with
one another are really friends, and that they wholly approve of each
other’s conduct; for, as I have already said, covetousness so prevails,
that justice and equity disappear among most men. Hence the Prophet
says, that he had not *lent on usury* Under one kind he includes all
transactions of life, as though he had said, *Je n’ay point traffique,*
I have had no contention about money affairs, for I have neither lent
nor borrowed money, so that I have had no contention with the people on
a private concern, nor have they quarrelled with me as though I had
injured them or defrauded them, as though they had suffered any loss on
my account: yet they all *curse* me.”  <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md)

<span id="vii.xii-p17"></span>We see that the Prophet here testifies
that he had not incurred the displeasure of the people through his own
fault, or on account of any private concern, but because he had
faithfully discharged his duty to God and to his ChurJeremiah He then
brings against the people a most awful accusation, that they carried on
war, not with a mortal man, but rather with God himself. We now
understand what the Prophet had in view.

<span id="vii.xii-p18"></span>But all faithful teachers are here
reminded, that if they perform their office strenuously and wisely, they
will surely be loaded with many calumnies, and be called tumultuous, or
morose, or disturbers of the peace. They ought then to be fortified
against such stumbling — blocks, so that they may persevere in the
course of their calling. They ought at the same time to take heed lest
they create enemies through any private concerns. For when the pastors
of the Church abstain from every public business, yet when they contend,
as they ought with the world, all immediately cry out that they are
contentious and turbulent; but if the other be added, if they quarrel
with this or that man about worldly things, then it cannot be but that
the word of God will be evil spoken of through their fault. Hence great
care ought to be taken that those who sustain the office of public
teaching should not engage in worldly business, and be thus exposed to
the necessity of contending about worldly things: they have enough to
do, and more than enough, in the warfare in which the Lord has engaged
them.

<span id="vii.xii-p19"></span>Now when the Prophet says that they all
*cursed* him, it was a sad instance of impiety; for he speaks not of
heathens but of the seed of Abraham. There was no Church then in the
world but at Jerusalem, and yet the Prophet was regarded there as
contentious and a man of strife. It ought not then to appear strange to
us, that not only professed enemies of Christ load us with reproaches,
but that they also curse us who deem themselves to be members of the
ChurJeremiah It now follows —

doubt intimates that he would be propitious to his servant, and grant
him what he asked. We then conclude that the Prophet’s prayer was heard;
and hence also becomes manifest what I have stated, that the Prophet was
not so led away by the force of grief, but that he chiefly regarded the
benefit of the people. God then was so propitious to his request, that
he said that it would *be well* with his *remnant,* that what remained
would be blessed.

<span id="vii.xiii-p7"></span>Interpreters differ as to the second
clause: some apply what is said to the people, *I will make the enemy to
meet thee in the time of evil, and in the time of trouble:* and so they
take this view, that God at the beginning of the verse answers the
Prophet, and intimates that his request was accepted, so that there
would be a better and happier end than what then appeared; and they
think that God then turns his discourse to the people, “With regard to
you, I will make the enemy to meet you in the day of affliction.” But
this explanation seems forced. I prefer to regard the whole verse as
addressed to the Prophet. God promises first that his remnant would be
prosperous; and by remnant he means the remaining time or the end of
life, as though he had said, “I will at length have pity on thee, so
that the things which cause thee the greatest grief shall turn into joy:
thine end then shall be more prosperous than thou thinkest.” Then the
words which follow confirm the previous sentence: for the Prophet might
have objected and said, “Then either the people shall be delivered from
all trouble, or I shall not escape a part of the calamity.” To this God
replies and says, “Thou and others nmst suffer many things, but I will
*make the enemy to meet thee,* that is, I will make the enemy to be
propitious to thee, and even of his own accord to anticipate thee.

<span id="vii.xiii-p8"></span>Interpreters differ still farther
respecting the verb <span id="vii.xiii-p8.1"></span>הפגעתי *epegoti;*
some regard it in a transitive sense, “To meet thee will I make the
enemy;” others render the sentence thus, “I will meet the enemy for
thee,” or, “I will cause the enemy to ask for thee.” The verb, <span
id="vii.xiii-p8.2"></span>פגע *pego,* means sometimes to meet, either in
a good or bad sense; as when one goes as an enemy against another, he is
said to meet him; or, when one offers help and shews kindness to
another, he is said to meet him. But the word has another meaning, and
signifies sometimes to ask, and so some take it here, “I will cause the
enemy to ask for thee.” But this is far — fetched: God did not send
messengers to pacify the Babylonians towards his servant Jeremiah. I
prefer to render the words thus, “I will meet the enemy for thee,” or,
“I will cause the enemy to meet thee;” that is, “I will pacify him by my
secret influence, so that he will of himself spare thee and treat thee
kindly.” And we know that it so happened; for Jeremiah was loosed from
his chains and was allowed his liberty, so that he was permitted to go
wherever he wished. As then the enemies treated him with so nmch
kindness, it appears evident that what God had before promised was
fulfined.

<span id="vii.xiii-p9"></span>As to the main thing intended, there is no
ambiguity in the words: God promised that the latter end of Jeremiah
would be happy, and that though he was to suffer somewhat in the common
calamity of the whole people, yet the enemy would treat him kindly, so
that his condition would be better and more desirable than that of
others.  <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md)

<span id="vii.xiii-p16"></span>But why did Jeremiah make this public?
why did he give this description? why did he commit it to writing? even
that the Jews might understand that they who harassed him, when he had
done them no injury, dealt unjustly with him. They had indeed been
excited by him, but it was through what his office required, for he
could not deny obedience to God. Jeremiah then made public what God only
knew before, that he might produce an impression on them, provided any
hope of repentance yet remained. And for the same reason also was the
promise of God added; for the Jews ought to have been terrified, when
they saw that such an end was promised by God to the Prophet; for what
must have happened to them, except the curse of God to the utter-most?
We hence see, that in the complaint of the Prophet, and in the answer
given by God, the salvation of the people was regarded; for the
complaint contains a most severe reproof and the answer of God threatens
a most dreadful judgment to the rebellious people. It follows —

<span id="vii.xiv"></span>

<span id="vii.xiv-p1"></span><span id="vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#012.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xiv-p2"></span>**12**. Shall iron break the northern iron
and the steel?

<span id="vii.xiv-p3"></span>**12**. An conteret ferrum ferrum ab
aquilone et aes *(vel,* chalybem?)

<span id="vii.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.xiv-p5"></span><span id="vii.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xiv-p6"></span>This verse also has been taken in different
ways by interpreters: some take the word *iron,* when repeated in a
different case, “Will iron break iron?” but others think the subject
wanting in the clause, and consider people to be understood, “Will the
Jews break the iron, even the iron from the north, and not only the iron
but the brass also, *or,* the the brass mixed with iron?” There is in
reality no difference, but in words only. If we read, “Will the iron
break the iron from the north?” the meaning will be, “Though there be
great hardness in you, can it yet break that which is in the Assyrians?
but ye are not equal to them: make your strength as great as you please,
still the Chaldeans will be harder to break you; for if ye are iron,
they are brass or steel, and so it will not be possible for you to
sustain their violent attacks.”

<span id="vii.xiv-p7"></span>As the meaning of the Prophet is
sufficiently evident, I will not insist on words, though the rendering I
most approve is this, “Will iron break the iron (the repetition is
emphatical) from the north and the brass?”

<span id="vii.xiv-p8"></span>We here also see that the design of the
holy man was, to divest the Jews of that false confidence in which they
boasted: for how was it, that they were so refractory, except that they
did not dread any misfortune? As then they were secure, predictions had
but little weight with them. Hence the Prophet, in order to beat down
this ferocity, says, that there would be greater hardness in the
Chaldeans, for they would be like iron, yea, and steel also.  <span
id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) It follows —

<span id="vii.xv"></span>

<span id="vii.xv-p2"></span>**13**. Thy substance and thy treasures will
I give to the spoil without price, and *that* for all thy sins, even in
all thy borders.

<span id="vii.xv-p3"></span>**13**. Opes tuas et thesauros tuos in
direptionem dabo, non in permutatione (hoc est, absque pretio,) et

sceleribus.)

<span id="vii.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.xv-p5"></span><span id="vii.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xv-p6"></span>But, there is a difference among
interpreters as to the word <span id="vii.xv-p6.1"></span>גבול *gebul.*
I indeed allow that it means a border: but Jeremiah, as I think, when he
intended to state things that are different, made use of different forms
of speech; but as the construction is the same, I see not how the word
can mean the borders of the land. I hence think that it is to be taken
here metaphorically for counsels; as though he had said, “On account of
all thy wicked deeds and on account of all thy ends, that is, of all thy
counsels, I will make thy wealth and thy treasures a plunder.” For true
is that saying of the heathen poet,

<span id="vii.xv-p7"></span>There is something where thou goest and to
which thou levellest thy bow.  <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md)

<span id="vii.xv-p9"></span>When we undertake any buiness, we have some
end in view. Then the Prophet calls their adulteries, frauds, rapines,
violencies and murders, wicked deeds; but he calls their counsels,
borders, such counsels as they craftily took, by which they manifested
their depravity and baseness.

<span id="vii.xv-p10"></span>Then, in the first place, he declares that
God would be a just avenger against their wicked deeds, and against all
the ends which the Jews had proposed to themselves; and at the same time
he points out and mentions the kind of punishment they were to have, —
that the Lord would give for a plunder all their *wealth and treasures,*
and that *without exchanging;* some read, “without price,” and consider
the meaning to be, — that the Jews would be so worthless, that no one
would buy them: but this is too refined. I doubt not but that the
Prophet intimates, that whatever the Jews possessed would become a prey
to their enemies, so that it would be taken away from them without any
price or bartering; as though he had said, “Your enemies will freely
plunder all that you have without any permission from you, and will
regard as their own, even by the right of victory, whatever ye think you
have so laid up as never to be taken away.”  <span
id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) He afterwards adds —

<span id="vii.xvi"></span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p1"></span><span id="vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#014.md)<span id="vii.xvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p2"></span>**14**. And I will make *thee* to pass with
thine enemies into a land *which* thou knowest not: for a fire is
kindled in mine anger, *which* shall burn upon you.

<span id="vii.xvi-p3"></span>**14**. Et transire faciam ad hostem in
terram quam non cognoscis; quia ignis ascensus est in ira mea *(alii
vertunt,* in nare; יפא significat utrunque) super vos ardebit.

<span id="vii.xvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.xvi-p5"></span><span id="vii.xvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xvi-p6"></span>He pursues the same subject. He had said,
that they would be exposed as a prey to their enemies, so that all their
wealth would be plundered with impunity: he now adds, *I will deliver
you to the enemy,* that is, I will give you into the hands of your
enemies, that they may remove you ejsewhere. He afterwards mentions a
circumstance, which must have rendered exile much worse; for when any
one changes his place and is not led to a distance, the evil is more
tolerable; but when any one is carried beyond the sea, or into distant
lands, there is a much greater cause for sorrow, as there is no hope of
return to one’s own country. Then despair increases the grief. Add to
this, that not to hear of one’s native Iand, as though we were in
another world, is also a bitter trial.

<span id="vii.xvi-p7"></span>The Prophet then adds, *Because fire has
been kindled in my wrath, and against you it shall burn* He means that
God would be implacable until they were consumed; for his wrath had been
kindled on account of their perverse wickedness.

<span id="vii.xvi-p8"></span>Now all these things were foretold to them,
that they might know that God would execute a just vengeance by making
the Chaldeans their conquerors: for they might have thought that this
happened by chance, according to what has been said by heathen writers,
that the events of war are uncertain, that Mars is indifferent *(Cicero
in Epist)* Thus they ascribe to chance whatever happens through God’s
providence. That the Jews then might know that they were chastised by
God’s hand and by his just vengeance, it was necessary that this should
have been declared to them: and therefore he speaks now of the Chaldeans
and then of God himself, whose agents the Chaldeans were, for they were
guided by his hand. He said before, “Will iron break the iron from the
north?” This we, have explained of the Chaldeans: but now he turns to
God himself, the author of the calamity brought on the Jews: for the
Chaldeans could have done nothing, except through his guidance and
direction.

<span id="vii.xvi-p9"></span>Hence he says, *I will cause them to pass
over to the enemy, even to a land which they know not* And the reason
which follows ought to have availed to check all their complaints. We
indeed know how clamorous the Jews were, for they often accused God of
cruelty, as it appears from many passages. The Prophet then, in order to
restrain them, says, that the *fire of God’s wrath* had been *kindled,*
and that it could not be extinguished, but would burn on them, that is,
would entirely consume them. At the same time he condemns their
obstinacy, for they allowed no place to God’s mercy, though often
warned. They might indeed have pacified him, had they repented. Hence
the Prophet here condemns their sottishhess; for they increased their
judgment by a continued progress in their evil ways. He afterwards adds
—

<span id="vii.xvii"></span>

<span id="vii.xvii-p1"></span><span id="vii.xvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#015.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xvii-p2"></span>**15**. O LORD, thou knowest: remember me,
and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in thy
longsuffering: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke.

<span id="vii.xvii-p3"></span>**15**. Tu nosti, Jehova; recordare mei,
et visita me, et ulciscere me a persecutoribus meis, ne in prorogatione
*(vel,* protractione) irae tuae tollas me; cognosce sustinuisse me *(id*
est, quod sustinuerim) propter to opprobrium.

<span id="vii.xvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.xvii-p5"></span><span id="vii.xvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xvii-p6"></span>The Prophet again turns to God, to shew
that he had to do with the deaf. This breaking off in the Prophet’s
discourse has much more force than if he had pursued regularly his
subject. Had he spoken calmly and in uniform order to the people, his
address would have been less forcible, than by speaking to them as it
were angrily and by severely reproving them, and then immediately by
turning from them and addressing God as though bidding adieu to men. Of
this we have spoken elsewhere, but it is well to remind you of what we
have before noticed. We now perceive the design of the Prophet, in thus
abruptly turning from the people to God, and then again from God to the
people, even because he indignantly bore the loss of his labor, when the
ears of almost all were closed, and when they had become so hardened
that they had no fear of God, nor any regard for his teaching. As then
the Prophet indignantly bore so great a wickedness, he could not but
speak in a hasty manner.

<span id="vii.xvii-p7"></span>According to this strain, he now says,
*Thou knowest, Jehovah; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of mine
enemies* The Prophet, however, seems here to have been more angry than
he ought to have been, for revenge is a passion unbecoming the children
of God. How was it, then, that the Prophet was so indignant against the
people that he desired revenge? We have said elsewhere that the
prophets, though freed from every carnal feeling, might yet have justly
prayed for vengeance on the reprobate. We must distinguish between
private and public feelings, and also between the passions of the flesh,
which keep within no limits, and the zeal of the Spirit. It is certain
that the Prophet had no regard to himself when he thus spoke; but he
dismissed every regard for himself, and had regard only to the cause of
God: for inconsiderate zeal often creeps in, so that we wish all to be
condemned of whom we do not approve; and such was the excessive zeal of
the disciples, when they said,

<span id="vii.xvii-p8"></span>“Lord, bid fire to descend from heaven to
consume them, as was done by Elias.”  
(<span id="vii.xvii-p8.2"></span>[Lu
9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054)<span id="vii.xvii-p8.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.xvii-p9"></span>But it is necessary not only to be moved
by a pious zeal, but also to be guided by a right judgment: and this
second requisite was possessed by the Prophet; for he did not let loose
the reins to his own zeal, but subjected himself to the guidance of the
Holy Spirit. Since, then, these two things were united, — a right zeal,
to the exclusion of any private feeling, — and the spirit of wisdom and
a right judgment, it was lawful to ask for vengeance on the reprobate,
as the Prophet does.

<span id="vii.xvii-p10"></span>There is further no doubt but that he
pitied the people; but he was in a manner freed from the influence of
human feelings, and had put off whatever might have disturbed him and
led him away from moderation. Though, then, the Prophet was thus
emancipated and freed from every kind of perturbation, there is yet no
doubt but that he prayed for final judgment on the reprobate; and yet,
if there were any healable, he doubtless wished them to be saved, and
also prayed anxiously for them.

<span id="vii.xvii-p11"></span>In short, whenever the prophets were
carried away by such a fervor as this, we must understand that they were
fined by the Spirit of Christ; and we must know that, when they were
thus fined, their whole zeal was directed against the reprobate, while
they were at the same time endeavoring to gather together all that could
be saved: and the same was the case with David; when he fervently
implored destruction on his enemies, he no doubt sustained the person of
Christ, as he was fined by his Spirit. (<span
id="vii.xvii-p11.1"></span>[Ps
35:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#004.md)<span
id="vii.xvii-p11.1"></span>) Hence he turned and levelled all his
vehemence against the reprobate; but, when there was any hope of
salvation, David also, in the spirit of kindness, prayed for the
restoration of those who seemed to have already perished. Now, then,
when the Prophet says, “Thou knowest, Jehovah; remember me, and visit,
me, and avenge me of my persecutors,” he doubtless does not mean all his
persecutors, but those who had been given up and devoted to destruction,
and whom he himself knew to be reprobates.  <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md)

<span id="vii.xvii-p13"></span>He afterwards shews what he meant by
these words — *remember me, and visit me;* for he says, *Take me not
away by deferring* So they render the passage, “Whilst thou bearest with
the impiety of this people, and for a time suspendest thy vengeance, let
not thy wrath take me away.” The word <span
id="vii.xvii-p13.1"></span>ארך *arek,* means to defer, to protract, and
also to prolong, to extend, and to continue. Hence this meaning is not
unsuitable, “Take me not away in the protraction of thy wrath;” that is,
“By protracting thy wrath, not only for one day, but for a long time,
*take me not away,* involve me not in the same destruction with the
reprobate.” David also prayed for the same thing,

<span id="vii.xvii-p14"></span>“When thou destroyest the wicked, involve
me not with them.” (<span id="vii.xvii-p14.1"></span>[Ps
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#009)<span id="vii.xvii-p14.1"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.xvii-p15"></span>The sum of the whole is, that the Prophet
asks a favor for himself, that God would make a difference between him
and the reprobate while he was protracting his wrath; that is, while he
was not only taking vengeance on the impiety of the people for a short
time, but also while he was adding calamities to calamities, and
accumulating evils on evils, and while thus his fire burned for a long
time, until the whole land was consumed: and this is the meaning which I
prefer, though all the interpreters agree in another.  <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md)

<span id="vii.xvii-p30"></span>It must further be noticed that the
Prophet, in this prayer, did not so much consult his own advantage as
the good of the people, — that they might at length dread the dreadful
judgment which was at hand. We have already stated how supine a security
prevailed throughout Judea; and they also hoped, that if any calamity
happened it would be for a short time, so that, having endured it, they
might again live in pleasure and quietness. Hence the Prophet speaks of
the *protraction* of God’s *wrath,* in order that they might know, as I
have already said, that the fire which had been kindled could not be
extinguished until they all perished.

<span id="vii.xviii"></span>

<span id="vii.xviii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vii.xviii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we cease not
by our sins daily to provoke thy wrath against us, and are also
ungrateful to thee and disobedient to thy heavenly doctrine, — O grant
that we may at length know what we have hitherto deserved, and become so
displeased with our vices, that being really and from the heart turned
to thee, we may above all things seek to be reconciled to thee and
received into favor, so that thou mayest rule us by thy Holy Spirit, and
confirm us in true obedience and godliness, until we shall at length
enjoy that eternal felicity which has been prepared for us in heaven by
Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="vii.xix-p1"></span>Lecture Sixty-First

<span id="vii.xx"></span>

<span id="vii.xx-p1"></span><span id="vii.xx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#016.md)<span id="vii.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xx-p2"></span>**16**. Thy words were found, and I did eat
them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for
I am called by thy name, O LORD God of hosts.

<span id="vii.xx-p3"></span>**16**. Inventi sunt sermones tui, et comedi
eos*,* et fuit sermo tuus mihi in gaudium et laetitiam cordis mei; quia
invocatum est nomen tuum super me, Jehova Deus exereituum.

<span id="vii.xx-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.xx-p5"></span><span id="vii.xx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xx-p6"></span>The Prophet had said in the last verse that
he was loaded with reproach on God’s account; for in his intercourse
with his own people he did not incur their hatred for any private
affair, but for his faithfulness in the discharge of his duty: hence
arose their reproaches and slanders. He now confirms the same thing in
other words, and at the same time explains what might have appeared
obscure on account of the brief statement which he had made. This verse,
then, is explanatory; for the Prophet shews what he meant by saying that
he was burdened with reproaches and calumnies on account of God’s name.

<span id="vii.xx-p7"></span>*Found,* he says, *by me have been thy
words, and I did eat them,* and they turned to me for *joy of heart*
Hence then it was that he was hated by the whole people, because he
labored to obey from the heart and in sincerity the command of God, and
to perform the office committed to him. But by saying that *words had
been found,* he refers to his calling, as though he had said that he had
not sought them as ambitious men are wont to do. We indeed see, with
regard to many, that they busy themselves about many things, while they
might be at ease and be troublesome to none; but a foolish ambition
impels them to seek offices for themselves, and thus they excite against
themselves the hatred of many. The Prophet therefore testifies here,
that he did not ambitiously seek his office, but that it had been
conferred on him from above. We may also take the word in another sense
— that the Prophet felt assured that God had sent him; for the word, to
find, is often thus taken in Scripture; that is, when anything is
perceived and known it is said to be found. But the former view is what
I approve, for it is more simple. Then the Prophet says that he was
called and made a Prophet, when he expected no such thing; for when he
in no way intruded himself, God met him, and in a manner anticipated
him: and this we have seen in the first chapter; for he said, for the
sake of excusing himself,

<span id="vii.xx-p8"></span>“Ah! Lord, I cannot speak.” (<span
id="vii.xx-p8.1"></span>[Jer 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#008.md)<span
id="vii.xx-p8.1"></span>)

<span id="vii.xx-p9"></span>We hence see that the Prophet sought to
decline the office rather than to desire it as a vocation of honor. So
he now rightly declares that God’s *words* had been *found* by him, that
is, that they had been gratuitously bestowed on him, according to what
the Lord says by Isaiah,

<span id="vii.xx-p10"></span>“I have been found by them who sought me
not, and I have manifested myself to them who asked not for me.” (<span
id="vii.xx-p10.1"></span>[Isa
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.xx-p10.1"></span>;
<span id="vii.xx-p10.2"></span>[Ro
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#020)<span id="vii.xx-p10.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.xx-p11"></span>This indeed is to be applied to all; but as
to the meaning of the term, to find, we see how suitable it is. the
Prophet then did not hunt for this honor, nor did he desire any such
thing, but the favor of God anticipated him.

<span id="vii.xx-p12"></span>He afterwards adds, *I did eat them* He
here testifies that he from the heart, and with a sincere feeling,
submitted to God’s command. We indeed know that many prattle about
heavenly mysteries, and have the words of God on their tongues; but the
Prophet says that he had *eaten the words* of God; that is, that he
brought forth nothing from the tip of his tongue, as the proverb is, but
spoke from the bottom of his heart, while engaged in the work of his
calling. Well known and sufficiently common in Scripture is the metaphor
of eating. When we are said to eat Christ, (<span
id="vii.xx-p12.1"></span>[Mt
26:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#026)<span id="vii.xx-p12.1"></span>.md)
the reference no doubt is to the union we have with him, because we are
one body and one spirit. So also we are said to eat the word of God, not
when we only taste and immediately spew it out again, as fastidious men
do, but when we receive inwardly and digest what the Lord sets before
us. For celestial truth is compared to food, and we know by the
experience of faith how fit the comparison is. Since then celestial
truth is good to feed spiritually our souls, we are justly said to eat
it when we do not reject it, but greedily receive it, and so really chew
and digest it that it becomes our nourishment. This then is what is
meant by the Prophet; for he did not act a fable on the stage when
teaching the people, but performed in real earnest the office committed
to him, not like an actor, is the case is with many who boast themselves
to be ministers of the word, but he was a faithful and true minister of
God. He then says, that the *word* of God *had been to him the joy and
gladness of his heart;* that is, that he delighted in that word, like
David, who compares it to honey. (<span id="vii.xx-p12.2"></span>[Ps
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#011.md)<span id="vii.xx-p12.2"></span>;

119:103](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#103.md)<span

Ezekiel,(<span id="vii.xx-p12.4"></span>[Eze

for the Prophet is there bidden to eat the volume presented to him; and
then he says that it was to him like honey in sweetness, for he embraced
the truth with ardent desire, and made privately such a proficiency in
the school of God, that his labors became afterwards publicly useful. We
hence see how similar was the case with Jeremiah and Ezekiel; for they
not only recited, as is commonly done by those who seek to please the
ear, what they had been taught, but they became the disciples of the
holy Spirit before they became teachers to the people.  <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md)

<span id="vii.xx-p16"></span>It may however be asked, how could the word
of God be so sweet and pleasant to the Prophet, when yet it was so full
of bitterness; for we have seen elsewhere that many tears were shed by
the holy man, and he had expressed a wish that his eyes would flow, as
though they were fountains of water. How then could these things agree —
the grief and sorrow which the holy man felt for God’s judgments, and
the joy and gladness which he now mentions? We have said elsewhere that
these two feelings, though apparently repugnant, were connected together
in the Prophets; they as men deplored and mourned for the ruin of the
people, and yet, through the power of the Spirit, they performed their
office, and approved of the just vengeance of God. Thus then the word of
God became joy to the Prophet, not that he was not touched by a deep
feeling for the destruction of the people, but that he rose above all
human feelings, so as fully to approve of God’s judgments. Hosea says
the same thing —

<span id="vii.xx-p17"></span>“Right are the ways of the Lord; the just
will walk in them, but the ungodly will stumble and fall.” (<span
id="vii.xx-p17.1"></span>[Ho 14:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#009.md)<span
id="vii.xx-p17.1"></span>)

<span id="vii.xx-p18"></span>The Prophet indeed speaks thus, not of the
word itself, but of its execution; but yet the design is the same; for
the Prophet Hosea checks the wantonness of the people, because they
complained that God was too rigid and severe. Right, he says, are the
ways of the Lord; the just will walk in them, that is, they will consent
to God, and acknowledge that he acts rightly, even when he punishes for
sins; but the ungodly will stumble, according to what the Lord says in
another place —

<span id="vii.xx-p19"></span>“Are my ways perverse and not rather
yours?”  
(<span id="vii.xx-p19.2"></span>[Eze
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025)<span id="vii.xx-p19.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.xx-p20"></span>For they said that the Lord’s ways were
crooked, because they, being soft and delicate, could not endure those
severe rebukes, which their own wickedness forced from the holy
Prophets. God answers them, and says, that his ways were not crooked,
nor thorny, nor tortuous, but that the fault was in the people
themselves.

<span id="vii.xx-p21"></span>We now then understand the real meaning of
this passage. The Prophet knew that nothing was better than to receive
whatever proceeded from God; and he testifies that he found sweetness in
God’s word.

<span id="vii.xx-p22"></span>He afterwards adds, *Because on me is
called thy name, O Jehovah, God of hosts* This mode of speaking occurs
often in Scripture, but in a different sense. The name of God is indeed
called indiscriminately on all, who are deemed his people. As it was
formerly given to the whole seed of Abraham, so it is at this day
conferred on all who are consecrated to his name by holy baptism, and
who boast themselves to be Christians and the sons of the Church; and
this belongs even to the Papists. We are called by his name, because he
has favored us with his peculiar grace, for the purity of true and
lawful worship exists among us; errors have been removed and his simple
truth remains; yet many hypocrites are mixed with the elect of God, so
that in a true and well ordered church, the reprobate are called by the
name of God; but the elect alone are truly called by his name, as Paul
says,

<span id="vii.xx-p23"></span>“Let every one who calls on the name of the
Lord depart from iniquity,”  
(<span id="vii.xx-p23.2"></span>[2Ti
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#019)<span id="vii.xx-p23.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.xx-p24"></span>There is in this case a mutual connection;
for to call on the name of the Lord, and to have his name called on any
one, amounts to the same thing. We hence see that the name of God is
only truly and really called on those, who not only boast that they are
the faithful, but who have been also regenerated by the Holy Spirit.

<span id="vii.xx-p25"></span>But the Prophet here refers to his office
when he says, that the name of God was called on him; for he had been
chosen to his office of teaching; he was not only dignified with the
title, but was really approved by God. We now then perceive in what
sense he says that God’s name was called on him, even because God had
laid his hand on him and resolved to employ him in the work of teaching
the people. But there are many mercenaries in the Church, and though
they do not openly corrupt or adulterate the truth of God, they yet, as
Paul says, preach it for gain, (<span id="vii.xx-p25.1"></span>[2Co
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017)<span id="vii.xx-p25.1"></span>.md)
It must be observed, that God’s name was called on Jeremiah, because he
was known to God as being true and faithful; and he had not only proved
himself to be so to men, but he had been chosen by God to be his
faithful messenger.  <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md)

<span id="vii.xx-p30"></span>There is emphasis in the words, *O Jehovah,
the God of hosts;* for the Prophet no doubt refers here to the glory of
God, that he might with an elevated mind look down, as it were, on so
many adversaries, who proudly despised him, as it was difficult to carry
on war with the whole people. This then was the reason why he spoke of
God’s glory in terms so magnificent, by saying, *O Jehovah, the God of
hosts* It follows: —

<span id="vii.xxi"></span>

<span id="vii.xxi-p1"></span><span id="vii.xxi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#017.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxi-p2"></span>**17**. I sat not in the assembly of the
mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of thy hand: for thou hast
filled me with indignation.

<span id="vii.xxi-p3"></span>**17**. Non sedi in consilio *(vel* coetu)
derisorum, neque exultavi; propter manum tuam seorsum sedi; quia
indignatione replevisti me.

<span id="vii.xxi-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.xxi-p5"></span><span id="vii.xxi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxi-p6"></span>Here the Prophet more fully declares, that
he was hated by the whole people because he pleased God. He indeed
inveighs against the impiety of those who then bore rule; he does not
here so much reprove the common people as the chief men, who exercised
authority and administered justice; for when he speaks of the assembly
of the ungodly, he no doubt refers to wicked rulers, as the word <span
id="vii.xxi-p6.1"></span>סוד, *sud,* which means a secret, means also a
council. And David (or whosoever was the author of the sixty-ninth
Psalm) says, not that he was a sport to the vulgar, but that he was
derided by those who sat in the gate, (<span
id="vii.xxi-p6.2"></span>[Ps
69:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#012)<span id="vii.xxi-p6.2"></span>.md)
which means, that he was reproachfully treated by wicked judges, who
possessed the chief authority. So also in this place, Jeremiah says,
that he did *not sit in the council of mockers* It is not the same word
as in the first Psalm; and <span id="vii.xxi-p6.3"></span>סוד, *sud,* is
sometimes taken in a good sense, but here in a bad sense; for Jeremiah
speaks of the profane despisers of God, who ridiculed everything that
was announced in the name of God.  <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md)

<span id="vii.xxi-p10"></span>Now it was necessary for the holy man thus
to exasperate these impious men, for they were in favor, credit, and
authority with the people; and we know that they who were in power do in
a manner dazzle the eyes of the vulgar with their splendor. As they then
thus deceived the simple, the Prophet removed the mask, and exclaimed,
that he did not sit in their council nor exulted with them. In denying
that he was connected with them, he intimates what their conduct and
manners were. He therefore shews, that whatever their dignity might be,
they were still the impious despisers of God, and were only mockers. The
same is the case with us at this day, we are under the necessity
directly to expose those masked rulers, who are inflated with their own
power and fascinate the people; for buffoons in tippling-houses and
taverns do not so wantonly mock God as those courtiers, who, while
consulting respecting the state of the whole earth, and deciding on the
affairs of all kingdoms, seem as though they themselves possessed all
the power of God; and we also know that they are profane mockers. Hardly
any piety or reverence for God is to be found in the courts of princes;
nay, especially at their councils, the devil reigns, as it were, without
control. We are therefore constrained often to speak very strongly
against such unprincipled men, who falsely assume the name of God, and
by this pretense deceive the common people. By this necessity was
Jeremiah constrained to declare, that he had not been in the assembly of
such men.

<span id="vii.xxi-p11"></span>He then adds, *On account of thine hand*
(from the presence of thine hand) *I sat apart, because with indignation
hast thou filled me* Here Jeremiah confesses that he had departed from
the people; but he did so, because he could not have otherwise obeyed
God. Some consider hand to mean prophecy, and others, a stroke; and so
it is often taken metaphorically; but I am disposed to take it for
command, “On account of thy hand;” that is, because I attended to what
thou hast commanded, nor had I any other object but to obey thee. Hence,
*On account of thine hand,* because I regarded thee and wished wholly to
submit to thy will, *I sat apart*

<span id="vii.xxi-p12"></span>This passage is especially deserving of
notice; for the Prophet was at Jerusalem among the priests, and was one
of them, as we found at the beginning of this book. Though then he was a
priest, he was constrained to separate himself and to renounce all
connection with his colleagues and brethren. As then this was the case
with the holy Prophet, why do the Papists try to frighten us by
objecting to us our separation, as though it were a most heinous crime?
they call us apostates, because we have departed from their assemblies;
truly if Jeremiah was an apostate, we need not be ashamed to follow his
example, since he was approved by God, though he separated from the
whole people, and also from the ungodly priests. Let us at this day
openly and boldly confess that we have separated. There is then a
separation between us, and one indeed irreconcilable; and accursed were
we, if we sought an union with the Papists. We are therefore constrained
plainly and openly to repudiate them, and to move heaven and earth
rather than to agree with them. We see that there is a rule here
prescribed to us by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of Jeremiah. To
refute then the ealumnies of those who object to us our separation, this
very passage is sufficient.

<span id="vii.xxi-p13"></span>“I sat apart,” and true it, was so; but no
one can say this at this day; for the Lord has gathered to himself many
teachers and many disciples. They then who now profess the gospel do not
sit apart as Jeremiah. But though all had forsakert him, he yet
hesitated not to separate himself from all. But were it necessary for
every one of us to become separated and to live apart, were God to
scatter each of us through all the regions of the world, so that no one
were to strengthen and encourage another, yet we should still stand
firm, under the conviction that we sat apart on account of God’s hand.
Let the Papists then complain as they please, that we are proud, and
that we disturb the peace of the whole world, provided we have this
answer to give, — That we sit apart on account of God’s hand, because we
seek to obey God and to follow his call: we can therefore boldly and
safely despise and scorn all the reproaches with which they falsely load
us.

<span id="vii.xxi-p14"></span>He afterwards adds, *For thou hast filled
me with idignation*  <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) He confirms
what he said in the last verse, — that he had eaten the word of God,
that he had not been slightly moved, but had been inflamed with zeal for
God: for we cannot really execute the commission given to us unless we
be fined with indignation, that is, unless zeal for God burns inwardly,
for the prophetic office requires such a fervor. He then adds —

<span id="vii.xxii"></span>

<span id="vii.xxii-p1"></span><span id="vii.xxii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018.md)<span id="vii.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxii-p2"></span>**18**. Why is my pain perpetual, and my
wound incurable, *which* refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether
unto me as a liar, *and as* waters *that* fail?

<span id="vii.xxii-p3"></span>**18**. Ut quid erit dolor meus fortis,
*(vel,* durus) et plaga mea aegra *(aut,* valida, *aut,* insanabilis,
doloris plena; *dicemus postea de voce,)* renuit curari? *(hoc est,* non

*(alli vetrunt,* eris mihi mendax, aquae infideles, *hoc est,* tanquam
aquae infideles.)

<span id="vii.xxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.xxii-p5"></span><span id="vii.xxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxii-p6"></span>Before we proceed, we shall shortly refer
to the meaning of the passage. Jeremiah has before shewn that he
possessed an heroic courage in despising all the splendor of the world,
and in regarding as nothing those proud men who boasted that they were
the rulers of the Church: but he now confesses his infirmity; and there
is no doubt but that he was often agitated by different thoughts and
feelings; and this necessarily happens to us, because the flesh always
fights against the spirit. For though the Prophet announced nothing
human when he declared the truth of God, yet he was not wholly exempt
from sorrow and fear and other feelings of the flesh. For we must always
distinguish, when we speak of the prophets and the apostles, between the
truth, which was pure, free from every imperfection, and their own
persons, as they commonly say, or themselves. Nor were, they so
perfectly renewed but that some remnant of the flesh still continued in
them. So then Jeremiah was in himself disturbed with anxiety and fear,
and affected with weariness, and wished to shake off the burden which he
felt so heavy on his shoulders. He was then subject to these feelings,
that is, as to himself; yet his doctrine was free from every defect, for
the Holy Spirit guided his mind, his thoughts, and his tongue, so that
there was in it nothing human. The Prophet then has hitherto testified
that he was called from above, and that he had cordially undertaken the
office deputed to him by God, and had faithfully obeyed him: but now he
comes to himself, and confesses that he was agitated by many thoughts,
which betokened the infirmity of the flesh, and were not free from
blame. This then is the meaning.

<span id="vii.xxii-p7"></span>He says, *Why is my grief strong,* or
hard? He intimates that his grief could not be eased by any soothing
remedy. He alludes to ulcers, which by their hardness repel all
emollients. And for the same purpose he adds, *And my wound weak,* as
some render it, for it is from <span id="vii.xxii-p7.1"></span>אנש
*anesh,* to be feeble; and hence is <span id="vii.xxii-p7.2"></span>אנוש
*anush,* which means man; and it expresses his weakness, as <span
id="vii.xxii-p7.3"></span>אדם *adam,* shews his origin, and <span
id="vii.xxii-p7.4"></span>איש *aish,* intimates his strength and
courage. Others render the words, “and my wound full of pain;” and
others, “strong,” as he had before called his grief strong. He
afterwards thus explains what he meant by the terms he used, *It refuses
to be healed* There is no doubt, as I have already intimated, but that
the Prophet here honestly expresses the perturbations of his own mind,
and shews that he in a manner vacinated; the wickedness of the people
was so great, that he could not so perseveringly execute his office as
he ought to have done.  <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md)

<span id="vii.xxii-p11"></span>He adds, *Thou wilt be to me as the
deception of inconstant waters* I wonder why some render the words,
“Thou wilt be to me deceptive as inconstant waters.” The word may indeed
be an adjective, but it is doubtless to be rendered as a substantive,
“Thou wilt be to me as the deception,” and then, “of unfaithful waters.”
that is, of such as flow not continually: for faithful or constant
waters are those which never fail; as the Latins call a fountain
inexhaustible whose spring never dries; so the Hebrews call a fountain
faithful or constant which never fails either in summer or in drought.
On the contrary, they call waters unfaithful which become dry, as when a
well, which has no perennial veins, is made dry by great heat; and such
also is often the case with large streams.  <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md)

<span id="vii.xxii-p15"></span>We now see the import of this comparison:
but the words are apparently very singular; for the Prophet expostulates
with God as though he had been deceived by him, “Thou wilt be to me,” he
says, “as a vain hope, and as deceptive waters, which fail during great
heat, when they are mostly wanted.” If we take the words as they appear
to mean, they seem to border on blasphemy; for God had not without
reason testified before, that he is the Fountain of living water; and he
had condemned the Jews for having dug for themselves broken cisterns,
and for having forsaken him, the Fountain of living water. Such, no
doubt, had He been found by all who trusted in him. What then does
Jeremiah mean here by saying, that God was to him as a vain hope, and as
waters which continue not to flow? The Prophet, no doubt, referred to
others rather than to himself; for his faith had never been shaken nor
removed from his heart. He then knew that he could never be deceived;
for relying on God’s word he greatly magnified his calling, not only
before the world, but also with regard to himself: and his glorytug,
which we have already seen, did not proceed except from the inward
feeling of his heart. The Prophet then was ever fully confident, because
he relied on God, that he could not be made ashamed; but here, as I have
said, he had regard to others. And we have already seen similar
passages, and the like expressions will hereafter follow.

<span id="vii.xxii-p16"></span>There is no doubt but that it was often
exultingly alleged that the Prophet was a deceiver: “Let him go on and
set before us the words of his God; it has already appeared that his
boasting is vain in saying that he has hitherto spoken as a prophet.”
Since then the ungodly thus harassed the Prophet, he might have justly
complained that God was not to him like perennial springs, because they
all thought that he was deceived. And we must always bear in mind what I
said yesterday, — that the Prophet does not speak here for his own sake,
but raffler that he might reprove the impiety of the people. It
therefore follows —

<span id="vii.xxiii"></span>

<span id="vii.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#019.md)<span id="vii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxiii-p2"></span>**19**. Therefore thus saith the LORD, If
thou return, then will I bring thee again, *and* thou shalt stand before
me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as
my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p3"></span>**19**. Propterea sic dixit Jehova,, Si
conversus fueris, ego quoque convertam te; coram facie mea stabis *\[hoc
est,* ut stes coram me) et si separaveris (eduxeris *ad verbum, hoc
est,* si discreveris) pretiosum a vili, tanquam os meum eris:
convertantur ipsi ad te, et tu non convertaris ad eos.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.xxiii-p5"></span><span id="vii.xxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxiii-p6"></span>From this answer of God we may gather
more clearly the design of the Prophet, for his purpose was, in order
more fully to prove the people guilty, to set before their eyes as it
were his own perverseness. Had he spoken only according to the heroic
elevation of his own mind, so as not to appear touched by any human
feeling, they might have derided him as hardhearted or a fanatic, for so
we find that the proud of this world speak and think of the faithful
servants of Christ. They call them melancholy, they consider them as
unfeeling, and as they neither dread death, nor are drawn away by the
allurements of this life, they think that all this proceeds from brutal
savageness. Had then the Prophet only performed the duties of his
office, the ungodly might have derided his insensibility, but he wished
to set forth his own infirmity, his sorrows, his fears, and his
anxieties, that he might thus lead the Jews to view things aright. This
answer of God ought then to be connected with the complaint of the
Prophet, and we may hence learn the meaning of the whole.

<span id="vii.xxiii-p7"></span>God gives this answer, *If thou wilt be
turned, I will turn thee, that thou mayest stand before me* It is the
same as though he had said, that he was reproved by the Lord because he
fluctuated amidst the commotions of the people. A similar passage is
found in the eighth chapter of Isaiah. The Lord there exhorts his
Prophet to separate himself from the people, and not to connect himself
with those who might have often easily disturbed him, because they
continued not in his word; then he says,

<span id="vii.xxiii-p8"></span>“Seal my law for my disciples, sign the
testimony,”  
(<span id="vii.xxiii-p8.2"></span>[Isa.
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#012.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016)<span id="vii.xxiii-p8.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.xxiii-p9"></span>as though he had said, “Have now nothing
to do with so perverse a people.” So also now the Lord speaks, *If thou
wilt be turned,* that is, if thou wilt not be guided by the false
judgments of the people, nor heed what they say of thee, but boldly
despise them and persevere in thy separation from them, *I will turn
thee,* that is, I will by my spirit so strengthen thee, that they may
perceive at length that thou art my faithful servant. Then he adds,
*that thou mayest stand before me*. We hence see more plainly what is
the meaning of the word “turn” in the second clause, even that the
Prophet would render his office approved of God, however clamorous the
Jews might be; though they even rose up tumulmously against him, yet he
says, thou shalt stand before me. There is implied here a contrast in
the word “stand,” for though the Prophet should be most violently
assailed by the false words of men, yet God would support and sustain
him. The rest we defer until to-morrow.

<span id="vii.xxiv"></span>

<span id="vii.xxiv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vii.xxiv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast
at this day plainly made known to us thy will through the gospel of thy
Son, so that we may by an unshaken faith embrace what is therein set
forth to us, — O grant, that we may learn to be satisfied with thee
alone, and to aequiesce in thy truth, and to renounce the whole world,
so that we may never be moved by any threats and terrors, nor vacinate
when the ungodly seem so proudly disposed to withdraw confidence in
thee; but may we render to thee all due honor, so as not only to obey
thee but also to perform the offices committed to us, and never to
hesitate so to provoke the whole world against us, that howsoever hard
our warfare may be we may firmly persevere in the course of thy holy
calling, and may thus at length enjoy that triumph, which Christ thy
only-begotten Son hath procured for us. — Amen.

<span id="vii.xxv"></span>

<span id="vii.xxv-p1"></span>Lecture Sixty-Second

<span id="vii.xxv-p2"></span>We began yesterday to explain the passage
in which God exhorts the Prophet to be courageous. He indeed uses the
word to “turn,” but it is the same as though he had said, that it was
not wise in him to vacinate, for he ought not to have turned aside by
any means from the performance of his office, though the Jews
obstinately resisted him. The sum of the whole then is, “If thou turnest
thyself I will also restore thee, that thou mayest stand before me.”

<span id="vii.xxv-p3"></span>It then follows, *If thou wilt distinguish
the precious from the worthless, thou shalt be as my mouth* God now
expresses what sort of turning he required from his servant, even freely
to condemn what was vicious, and boldly to defend what was right, though
the whole would oppose him. God then indirectly refers to that fear of
Jeremiah by which he was so shaken that he knew not what to do. hence
God reproves his Prophet, and shows that he could not otherwise stand
than by distinguishing between the precious and the worthless. Thus all
flattery was to be excluded. God then forbids his Prophet to deal gently
with the people, or to be influenced by favor so as to spare their
vices, and not to defend what was right with that courage which became
him.

<span id="vii.xxv-p4"></span>In these words is briefly comprehended the
duty of a true Prophet, even to turn his eyes from men, to heed neither
favor nor hatred, but to fix his attention only on the truth, not only
to approve of what is right, but also to defend it at the peril of his
life, and further, not to spare vices, but freely to reprove them.

<span id="vii.xxv-p5"></span>What is added, *Thou shalt be as my mouth,*
some interpret as though it was said, “Happen to thee shall everything
that I have promised,” or, “my promise shall not disappoint thee,” but
this seems to be far-fetched. I therefore take this plain meaning, “I
will own thee as a true and faithful servant, if only thou
distinguishest what is just from what is unjust, if thou continuest to
fight for the truth, and freely reprovest and condemnest vices.” The
import of the passage is, that those only are deemed by God to be the
faithful pastors of the Church, who are not influenced by respect of
persons, who do not turn to this or to that side, but rightly judge and
according to the law of God; for by the law is the difference to be made
between the precious and the worthless, as we are no fit judges but as
far as we agree with what God has said. The law then is alone that by
which we can distinguish the precious from the worthless.

<span id="vii.xxv-p6"></span>They who keep to this rule, do justly
condemn some and approve of others, because they are only God’s heralds,
and bring nothing of their own. It hence follows, on the other hand,
that those are not God’s instruments or ministers, nor are worthy of any
honor, who so pervert vices and virtues as to say that light is darkness
and that darkness is light. We may, in short, conclude from this
passage, that a vocation or a title is not sufficient, except, they who
are called faithfully discharge their duty to God. It hence follows,
that all those who either ambitiously seek the favor of men, or are
indulgent to their vices, and by flatteries nourish their corruptions,
are impostors: for how much soever they may boast that they are God’s
servants, yet he himself declares that they are not to be so accounted.

<span id="vii.xxv-p7"></span>He then adds, *Let them be turned to thee,
but be not thou turned to them,* or*,* thou shalt not be turned to them;
but the verbs, being in the future tense, are to be taken as
imperatives. He now confirms the previous doctrine, — that he ought not
to be submissive to them or to flatter them, but to subdue their
perverse minds until they received the yoke of God. The meaning of the
words is this, — that the Prophets were sent for this end — not to
gratify men, or to soothe them by obsequiousness, but to continue firm
and constant in executing their office and to turn refractory men to
him, and not to concede anything to them. And doubtless, except this
course be pursued, the majesty of God must give place to the humours and
fancies of men: for we know how great is the pride of almost the whole
world, and also their love of pleasure, so that no one can willingly
bear to be reproved. As then the greater part of mankind are so proud
and self-indulgent, were the word of God to bend to the humor of this or
of that man, what would become of it? there would certainly remain in
celestial truth no dignity and no majesty.

<span id="vii.xxv-p8"></span>We now see why this clause was added: for
the precious could not be rightly and justly distinguished from the
worthless, except the Prophets continued firm in the course of their
calling, and carried on war with the perverseness of men. It is
therefore necessary that all faithful teachers in the Church should so
conduct themselves, as not to concede to the vices of men nor to cherish
their fancies, but to constrain them to undertake the yoke of God. Paul,
however, seems to have followed a different course, for he says to the
Galatians,

<span id="vii.xxv-p9"></span>“Be ye as I am, for I am as you are.”
(<span id="vii.xxv-p9.1"></span>[Ga
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#012)<span id="vii.xxv-p9.1"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.xxv-p10"></span>As then he had endeavored to conform to
what they did, and to bear their infirmities, he exhorts them to do the
same in return. But it is certain that Paul acted not differently from
Jeremiah or other servants of God: and the answer is evident; for Paul
in the same Epistle testifies, that if he pleased men, he could not be
the servant of Christ, (<span id="vii.xxv-p10.1"></span>[Ga
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#010)<span id="vii.xxv-p10.1"></span>.md)
He then did not hunt for the farours of men, nor turned aside in the
least from the course of his duty to render himself obsequious to men;
but he could forgive their infirmities, or bear them, so that he might
thereby turn them to himself, or rather restore them to the service of
God. For when God thus speaks, *Be not thou turned to them,* he means
not Jeremiah personally, but refers to his doctrine. The meaning is,
that the truth of God ought not to bend to the will of men; for God
changes not, and so his word admits of no change. Whatever then men may
expect, this rule must remain fixed and inviolable, that they must
submit to God, and that he must be the sovereign, and reduce to
submission whatever height or excellency or pride there may be in the
world.  <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) It then follows —

<span id="vii.xxvi"></span>

<span id="vii.xxvi-p1"></span><span id="vii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#020.md)<span id="vii.xxvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxvi-p2"></span>**20**. And I will make thee unto this
people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they
shall not prevail against thee: for I *am* with thee to save thee and to
deliver thee, saith the LORD.

<span id="vii.xxvi-p3"></span>**20**. Et posui te huic populo in murum
aeneum (aeris, *ad verbum)* munitum: ergo pugnabunt contra te, sed non
praevalebunt tibi; quia tecum ego sum ad servandum te et ad liberandum
te, dicit Jehova.

<span id="vii.xxvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.xxvi-p5"></span><span id="vii.xxvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxvi-p6"></span>As Jeremiah might have objected and said,
that the burden was too heavy for him, if he only attempted to break
down the contumacy of the people, for he was alone, and we have seen how
great was the ferocity and also the cruelty of his adversaries, — as he
might have shunned his commission, it being too much for his strength,
hence God comes to his aid and bids him to take courage, for he was
fortified by a help from heaven, *I have set thee,* he says, *for a
brazen fortified wall to this people* The word for “fortified” is from
<span id="vii.xxvi-p6.1"></span>בצר, *betsar;* were it <span
id="vii.xxvi-p6.2"></span>בצרה *betsare,* derived from <span
id="vii.xxvi-p6.3"></span>צור *tsur,* to besiege, it would much better
suit this place. I know not whether the passage has been corrupted:
however, I will not depart from the common reading. As then interpreters
agree in this, I will change nothing; and indeed the difference is not
very material.  <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md)

<span id="vii.xxvi-p8"></span>We see then what God meant by these words:
As the Prophet was almost alone, and God had bidden him to contend with
many and powerful enemies, he promises to stand on his side; as though
he had said, — “Though thou art defenceless and unarmed, and they are
furnished with wealth and great power, thou shalt yet be like a
well-fortified city; thou shalt indeed be impregnable, notwithstanding
all their assaults and whatever they may attempt against thee.”

<span id="vii.xxvi-p9"></span>But God proceeds lay degrees; for he first
declares that his Prophet would be like a brazen and a fortified wall,
that is, like an invincible city: for by stating a part for the whole, a
wall means a city that is impregnable. It then follows, *They indeed
will fight against thee.* This warning was very necessary; for Jeremiah
was doubtless willing to serve God in exercising authority over
teachable and humble men, and in gently inducing them to render
obedience to God; but he is reminded here that he would have many hard
contests with a rebellious people, *They will fight,* he says, *against
thee* We see how God does not promise ease to Jeremiah, nor gives him a
hope of a better lot in future; but, on the centrary, he exhorts him to
fight; and why? because the people would not bear the yoke of God, but
kindled into rage against him. But another promise follows, *They shall
not prevail against thee,* or overcome thee.

<span id="vii.xxvi-p10"></span>It was indeed necessary for Jeremiah of
his own self to disturb the Jews; for nothing would have been more
agreeable to them than his silence; and the object of all their attempts
was to drive him to despair. But it is not without reason that they are
said to fight with him; for it is contrary to nature for men to resist
God and to set themselves against him when he invites them to himself;
for what can be more natural than for the whole world to hasten to God?
It is then something monstrous for men to oppose God, nay, furiously to
rise up against hhn, when he kindly calls them to himself. Hence it is
that God here makes the Jews the authors of all this disturbance. For
since they loaded the Prophet with the most wicked calumnies, as we have
seen, and said, that he was a turbulent man and confounded all things by
his morosity, God here shews, on the other hand, that all the commotions
and the rightings ought to be attributed to them, because they ought to
have obediently received the doctrine set before them.

<span id="vii.xxvi-p11"></span>But though this was said only once to
Jeremiah, yet the condition of all God’s servants is here set before us
as in a mirror; for they cannot perform what God commands them without
having to encounter many and grievous assaults; for the world is never
so prepared to obey God, but the greater part furiously resists, and, as
far as it can, stifles the word of God and checks his ministers.

<span id="vii.xxvi-p12"></span>He states the reason, *For I am with thee
to save thee and to deliver thee*  <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) By these words God exhorts his Prophet
to prayer; for we know how dangerous is self-security to all the
children of God, and especially to teachers. As then they have at all
times need of God’s aid, they are to be exhorted to have recourse to
solitude and prayer. This is the import of the words which God uses, *I
am with thee;* as though he had said, “Thou indeed wilt not stand by
thyself, or through thine own painstaking, nor wilt thou be a conqueror
by carrying on war thyself; but thou must learn to flee to me.” It
afterwards follows —

<span id="vii.xxvii"></span>

<span id="vii.xxvii-p1"></span><span
id="vii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#021.md)<span id="vii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxvii-p2"></span>**21**. And I will deliver thee out of
the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the
terrible.

<span id="vii.xxvii-p3"></span>**21**. Et liberabo te e manuimpiorum
(sceleratorum,) et eruam te e manu *(est aliud nomen, sed eodem sensu
capitur)* fortium.

<span id="vii.xxvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.xxvii-p5"></span><span id="vii.xxvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxvii-p6"></span>This verse contains nothing new, but is a
confirmation of the promise which we have seen. God had promised to be
with the Prophet; he now shews that there was sufficient strength in his
hand to deliver him. How much soever then the Jews might oppose him, God
declares here that he alone would be sufficient to break them down. We
hence see that there is more expressed in these words than in what he
had said before, *I will be with thee to deliver thee;* he now shews the
act itself as by the finger. *I will deliver thee* He had promised his
aid; he now says, that his aid would be strong enough to deliver him
from the hands of his enemies.

<span id="vii.xxvii-p7"></span>He says first, *from the hand of the
wicked,* that the Jews might know that all their disguises would avail
them nothing, for they were condemned by the mouth of God. In the second
place, he calls them *strong,* that the Prophet might not be terrified
by their power, as was usually the case. For it is very difficult for us
not to be disturbed, when we are assailed on every side, and when
threats and dangers are in our way. God then here reminds Jeremiah in
time, that he would have to fight with the *strong* and valiant, but
that all their strength in opposing him would be unavailing, for divine
aid would be much stronger. Now follows —

<span id="vii.i-p13"></span> Noticed here may be an identity of idiom in
Hebrew and Welsh: The verb “stand” is in the singular number, though
followed by two nominative cases. So it is in Welsh: and were the
nominative cases before it, the verb would be in the plural number.

<span id="vii.i-p14"></span><span id="vii.i-p14.1"></span>Pe savai Moses
a Samuel o’m blaen.

<span id="vii.i-p15"></span>This is the Hebrew, word for word. Both the
*Septuagint* and the *Vulgate* retain the singular number of the verb;
but they are not grammatically correct. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_126"></span>[127](cc18006.htm#fr_126.md) <span
id="vii.i-p23.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p24"></span> *Venema*, referring to this notion of the
Papists, says, “The words are not that they *stood*, but that *if they
stood*; he speaks not of them as dead, but as living, intimating, that
if they were alive and interceded for the people, they would not succeed
in delivering them.” We shall add an observation of *Scott* —

<span id="vii.i-p25"></span>“This passage fully proves that departed
saints do not intercede for us; for it evidently implies that Moses and
Samuel did not then stand before the Lord in behalf of Israel or of any
in Israel.”

<span id="vii.i-p26"></span> — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[128](cc18006.htm#fr_127.md) <span
id="vii.i-p27.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p28"></span> The verb means more properly to send; he
was to send them from God’s presence by his doctrine, intimating that
God disowned and rejected them: and they were to go forth or to go out,
that is, from his presence. The allusion is to the sending away a
divorced woman, —

<span id="vii.i-p29"></span>Send *them* from my presence, and let them
go forth:

<span id="vii.i-p30"></span>**2.** And it shall be, when they say to
thee, “Where shall we go forth?” that thou shalt say to them — Thus
saith Jehova, — “Those for death, to death; And those for the sword, to
the sword; And those for the famine, to the famine; And those for
captivity, to captivity.”

<span id="vii.i-p31"></span>It is observed by *Venema* and *Blaney*,
that “death” was that by pestilence. See <span
id="vii.i-p31.1"></span>[Jer
14:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer014.htm#012.md)<span id="vii.i-p31.1"></span>,
<span id="vii.i-p31.2"></span>[Jer
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#021.md)<span id="vii.i-p31.2"></span>.
Some were destined for death by pestilence, to this they were to go
forth: and so as to the other evils.

<span id="vii.i-p32"></span>The Rabbis say that there are gradations in
the evils mentioned here: death by pestilence is the less grievous than
the sword; the sword than the famine; the famine than captivity; the
last being more grievous than all the other evils. See <span
id="vii.i-p32.1"></span>[2 Sam. 24:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#013.md),

26:39](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#039.md)<span id="vii.i-p32.3"></span>.
The “sword” being the principal weapon, is put here for any violent
death inflicted by enemies. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[129](cc18006.htm#fr_128.md) <span
id="vii.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p7"></span> Our version ascribes tearing to dogs, but
the verb means to draw or drag about, as rendered by *Calvin*. It is
more descriptive of what is done by dogs, and conveys a more horrid
idea, and intended doubtless to terrify the Jews. *Blayney* renders it
“to drag about,” and no doubt correctly. Our version is the *Vulgate*:
the *Syriac* is to draw or drag about. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[130](cc18006.htm#fr_129.md) <span
id="vii.iv-p8.2"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p9"></span> So Gataker, “I will set over them, etc., as
in <span id="vii.iv-p9.1"></span>[Le
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md)<span id="vii.iv-p9.1"></span>; a
borrowed speech from officers set over people.” The *Syriac* expresses
the idea, “I will punish them with four scourges.” *Blayney’s* version
is —

<span id="vii.iv-p10"></span>And I will commission against them four
species.

<span id="vii.iv-p11"></span>But the best rendering is that of *Calvin*,
which is also adopted by *Venema*. I give the following version —

<span id="vii.iv-p12"></span>And I set over them four kinds, saith
Jehovah, — The sword to kill, and dogs to drag about, And the bird of
heaven and the beast of the earth To devour, and to pull to pieces.

<span id="vii.iv-p13"></span>The “devouring” refers to “the beast of the
earth,” and the “pulling to pieces” to the bird of heaven, according to
the usual style of the Prophets, the order being reversed. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[131](cc18006.htm#fr_130.md) <span
id="vii.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p8"></span> *Blayney* rightly observes that the word
rendered “to be removed,” in our version, has no such meaning. The verb
means to move, to agitate, to disquiet, but not to move from one place
to another. The noun as found here is rendered “vexation” in <span
id="vii.v-p8.2"></span>[Isa 28:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#019.md)<span
id="vii.v-p8.2"></span>, and “trouble” in <span
id="vii.v-p8.3"></span>[2Ch 29:8](../../../bib/kjv/ch2029.htm#008.md)<span
id="vii.v-p8.3"></span>. The idea of removing is not given in any of the
versions, nor in the *Targum*. It is used in two other places by
Jeremiah (<span id="vii.v-p8.4"></span>[Jer
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md)<span id="vii.v-p8.4"></span>;
<span id="vii.v-p8.5"></span>[Jer
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018)<span id="vii.v-p8.5"></span>.md).
In both places “vexation, trouble, or disquietude,” would be the best
rendering. This sentence may be thus translated —

<span id="vii.v-p9"></span>And I will render them a vexation to all the
kingdoms of the earth.

<span id="vii.v-p10"></span>Literally it is, “I will give them for a
vexation,” etc. And so they became, they were a trouble and a
disquietudewherever they were; and hence they became, as it is said in
<span id="vii.v-p10.1"></span>[Jer
29:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#018.md)<span id="vii.v-p10.1"></span>, a
curse, a hissing, and a reproach among all nations.

<span id="vii.v-p11"></span>*Venema* gives this rendering —

<span id="vii.v-p12"></span>And I will give them for a shaking to all
the kingdoms of the earth.

<span id="vii.v-p13"></span>Which he understands to mean, that they
would be given to be shaken, agitated, and disquieted in all the
kingdoms of the earth.

<span id="vii.v-p14"></span>*Blayney’s* version is —

<span id="vii.v-p15"></span>And I will give them up to vexation in all
kingdoms of the earth.

<span id="vii.v-p16"></span> But this is what the original will hardly
bear; the preposition before “kingdoms” is not *in*, but *to*. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[132](cc18006.htm#fr_131.md) <span
id="vii.vi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p11"></span> There is a general agreement as to the two
first clauses of this verse, but not as to the last. The *Syriac* and
the *Targum* give the meaning advocated by *Calvin*, with whom *Gataker,
Grotius*, and *Blayney* agree. But the *Septuagint* and the *Vulgate*
seem to take the other view, that to “pray for peace” is what is meant;
and this has been adopted by *Montanus, Castalio*, and *Venema*. But the
former is no doubt substantially the right view, though the phrase used,
“to salute,” or “to enquire of one’s welfare,” or “how thou doest,” is
too general. In <span id="vii.vi-p11.1"></span>[1Sa
25:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#005.md)<span id="vii.vi-p11.1"></span>
(see also <span id="vii.vi-p11.2"></span>[1Sa
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#004)<span id="vii.vi-p11.2"></span>.md)
we have the same form of words too loosely rendered, “greet him in my
name,” in our version. The following verse shews that the rendering
ought to be, “wish (or bid) him peace in my name.” Literally it is, “Ask
for him in my name for peace.” So here the literal rendering is, —

<span id="vii.vi-p12"></span>Or who will turn aside to ask for peace for
thee?

<span id="vii.vi-p13"></span>or, in our language, “to bid thee peace.”

<span id="vii.vi-p14"></span>The word “turn aside” seems clearly to
favor this meaning. In the other case its import does not appear. The
intimation is, that no one would deem it worth his while to turn out of
his way to express a good wish in behalf of Jerusalem. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[133](cc18006.htm#fr_132.md) <span
id="vii.vi-p17.2"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p18"></span> The verse may be thus rendered, —

<span id="vii.vi-p19"></span>**6.** Thou hast broken loose from me,
saith Jehovah; Backward dost thou walk; But I will stretch my hand over
thee and destroy thee; I have become wearied with repenting.

<span id="vii.vi-p20"></span>The verb here used, commonly rendered
“forsake,” means to loose oneself from restraints: the Jews were bound,
as it were, to God by covenant; they broke loose from this bond, they
freed themselves from this tie, and went back to idolatry. “Walk,”
though future, is to be taken here as present. The last line in the
*Septaugint* is as follows — “I will no longer release them;” and in the
*Syriac*, “I will no longer spare them.” The verb <span
id="vii.vi-p20.1"></span>הנחם seems to have been taken as coming from
<span id="vii.vi-p20.2"></span>נח with an <span
id="vii.vi-p20.3"></span>ם affixed, and put here in Hiphil — “I m
wearied with causing them to rest,” or, “with forbearing,” as rendered
by *Blayney*. But our version, which is that of *Calvin*, seems
preferable, and is adopted by *Piscator, Grotius*, and *Venema*. The
last indeed proposes the joining of this line with the next verse, which
*Blayney* has adopted, and in that case he prefers the reading of the
*Septuagint* and *Syriac*. Then the passage would be, —

<span id="vii.vi-p21"></span>I am wearied with forbearing them, *or*,
with suffering them to rest;  
**7.** And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land.

<span id="vii.vi-p22"></span>He truly says that there is a kind of
contrast between the suffering of them to rest quietly, and the fanning
of them in the gates of land for the purpose of dispersing them. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[134](cc18006.htm#fr_133.md) <span
id="vii.vii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p8"></span> Though *Calvin* has many on his side in
his view as to “the gates,” yet the most suitable meaning is that
presented in our version. God is represented as a fanner, standing in
“the gates of the land,” that is, in the gates of the cities of the
land, and thence fanning or scattering the inhabitants to all parts of
the world. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[135](cc18006.htm#fr_134.md) <span
id="vii.viii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p8"></span> This rendering is the *Targum*; “the
mother (and) the youths,” is the *Septuagint*; “the mother of a youth,”
the *Vulgate*; “both mother and youths,” the *Syriac*; “the mother and
the youths,” the *Arabic, Junius* and *Tremellius, Piscator*, and
*Gataker* take the “mother” for the chief city, the metropolis, and
consider the “youth,” or “the chosen one,” to be the “waster,”
signifying Nebuchadnezzar, — “And I will bring to them, against the
mother-city, a chosen one, a waster at mid-day.” So *Blayney*
substantially, only he renders the verb in the past tense. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[136](cc18006.htm#fr_135.md) <span
id="vii.viii-p10.7"></span>

<span id="vii.viii-p11"></span> Trembling and haste, (<span
id="vii.viii-p11.1"></span>σπουδην,)” is the version of the
*Septuagint*; “tumult and trembling,” of the *Syriac*; “terror and
trembling,” of the *Arabic*; the *Vulgate* retains only the word
“terror.” Various have been the explanations of the word <span
id="vii.viii-p11.2"></span>עיר, which *Calvin* renders “tumult,”
consistently with the general tenor of the ancient versions. *Gataker*
renders it “watcher;” *Blayney*, “enemy;” and others “city;” but the
most suitable to the passage is “tumult,” or commotion. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_136"></span>[137](cc18006.htm#fr_136.md) <span
id="vii.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ix-p8"></span> The whole passage, including the 7th, 8th,
and 9th verses (<span id="vii.ix-p8.1"></span>[Jer
15:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#007)<span id="vii.ix-p8.1"></span>.md)
presents difficulties as to the time intended. The verbs, from the
middle of the 7th to the last clause in verse the 9th, are all in the
past tense, and are so given in the *Septuagint, Vulgate*, and the
*Targum*; but in the *Syriac* in the future tense. Our version is not
uniform. It is better to give the tenses as they are, for the reference
seems to be to God’s past judgments; and at the end of the 9th verse,
God speaks of what he would do, —

<span id="vii.ix-p9"></span>**7.** And I will fan them with a fan in the
gates of the land. I have bereaved, I have destroyed my people; From
their ways have they not turned:

<span id="vii.ix-p10"></span>**8.** Increased to me have their (people)
widows More than the sand of the sea; I brought on them, on the mother
of they youth, A disaster at mid-day; I caused to come upon her suddenly
Tumult and terrors:

<span id="vii.ix-p11"></span>**9.** Languish did she who gave birth to
seven, Pant for breath did her soul, Set did her sun during the day
time, Ashamed has she been and confounded: And the remainder of them to
the sword will I give, In the presence of their enemies, saith Jehova.

<span id="vii.ix-p12"></span>As he speaks of bereavement, of widows, and
of giving birth to seven, it seems evident, that “the mother of the
youths,” or of young men. Whether mother is to be taken here
metaphorically for Jerusalem, is another question; but I think
otherwise. The loss of mothers as to their children is what is spoken
of. And from having mentioned the case of mothers in their bereavement,
the Prophet in the next verse refers to his own mother, and to his own
unhappy condition, — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[138](cc18006.htm#fr_137.md) <span
id="vii.xii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xii-p11"></span> Not one of the versions, except the
*Vulgate*, mentions “usury,” and *Parkhurst* says that the verb does not
include the idea. Then the rendering ought to be,

<span id="vii.xii-p12"></span>I have not lent, nor have they lent to me.

<span id="vii.xii-p13"></span>There had been no money transactions
between them, which are commonly the causes of disputes and contentions.

id="vii.xii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xii-p14"></span> Literally it is —

<span id="vii.xii-p15"></span>The whole of it (the land) is reviling (or
cursing) me.

<span id="vii.xii-p16"></span>As there is something anomalous in the
form of the participle, *Blayney* proposes an emendation, and thinks the
right reading to be <span id="vii.xii-p16.1"></span>כלהם קללונו, “All of
them curse me.” The versions and the *Targum* favor this reading, which
is also adopted by the commonly too venturous *Houbigant*, and approved
by *Horsley*, one equally venturous and bold. By dropping the <span
id="vii.xii-p16.2"></span>ו, as in many copies, the anomoly is removed.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[140](cc18006.htm#fr_139.md) <span
id="vii.xiii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xiii-p10"></span> This verse, and the three which follow,
have caused considerable variety of opinion. Some, like *Calvin,
Grotius, Henry*, and *Scott*, apply this to the Prophet and the rest to
the people; but others, as *Blayney*, consider the whole as addressed to
the people. But what appears the most probable is, that the Prophet is
addressed, and in the 11th and 12th (<span
id="vii.xiii-p10.1"></span>[Jer
15:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#011.md)<span
id="vii.xiii-p10.1"></span>) verses personally, and then as identified
with the people in verses the 13th and 14th (<span
id="vii.xiii-p10.2"></span>[Jer
15:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#013.md)<span
id="vii.xiii-p10.2"></span>). There is no change of person, and this
makes it difficult to regard two parties as addressed.

<span id="vii.xiii-p11"></span>This verse, the 11th, is in the past
tense and not in the future, and may be thus rendered, —

<span id="vii.xiii-p12"></span>Jehovah said, — Has not thy ministry been
for good? Have I not interposed for thee in the time of evil, And in the
time of distress, with the enemy?

<span id="vii.xiii-p13"></span>There are various readings for the word I
render “ministry,” which *Parkhurst* thinks comes from <span
id="vii.xiii-p13.1"></span>שרת, to serve. Very few readings favor the
word which means a remnant,” and of the versions the *Vulgate* alone.
The reading mostly countenanced (19 MSS.) is <span
id="vii.xiii-p13.2"></span>שרותיך, derived from <span
id="vii.xiii-p13.3"></span>שרה, to loose, or to let go, “Have I not
happily let thee go?” In this case <span id="vii.xiii-p13.4"></span>לטוב
must be rendered adverbially, happily, or fully. *Blayney’s* version is,
—

<span id="vii.xiii-p14"></span>Have I not brought thee off
advantageously?

<span id="vii.xiii-p15"></span>But the most natural meaning is what
*Parkhurst* proposes, which is approved by *Horsley*, only he renders
the sentence in the past tense, “Is not thy ministry for good?” while
the only verb in the verse is in the past tense, and so ought this
clause to be. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[141](cc18006.htm#fr_140.md) <span
id="vii.xiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xiv-p9"></span> If we consider what is said to the Prophet
in <span id="vii.xiv-p9.1"></span>[Jer
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#018.md)<span id="vii.xiv-p9.1"></span>,
and in the twentieth verse of this chapter (<span
id="vii.xiv-p9.2"></span>[Jer
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#020)<span id="vii.xiv-p9.2"></span>.md),
we shall see the meaning of this verse: he was no doubt the iron and the
brass: and the opinion of *Blayney* is probable, that the “enemy” in the
previous verse (which is a poetical singular for the plural enemies) is
the nominative case to the verb “break.” God, having before refered to
what he had done for the Prophet, now says, —

<span id="vii.xiv-p10"></span>Can he break the iron, The iron from the
north and the brass?

<span id="vii.xiv-p11"></span>God had made him an “iron pillar, and a
wall of brass:” and he asks now, was it possible for his enemies to
destroy him whom God had thus made. The hardest iron came from the north
of Judea. The future tense is to be read here potentially. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[142](cc18006.htm#fr_141.md) <span
id="vii.xv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xv-p8"></span> <span id="vii.xv-p8.1"></span>Est aliquid
quo tendis et in quod dirigis arcum. — *Per. Sat. iii. 60.*

<span id="fn_142"></span>[143](cc18006.htm#fr_142.md) <span
id="vii.xv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xv-p11"></span> This verse and the following are said by
*Horsley* to be “very obscure:” and there seems to be no way of
understanding them, except we regard the Prophet as classed with the
people; and the conclusion of verse fourteenth (<span
id="vii.xv-p11.1"></span>[Jer
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#014)<span id="vii.xv-p11.1"></span>.md)
favors the idea, “On you, <span id="vii.xv-p11.2"></span>עליכם, it shall
burn.” The Prophet himself did not wholly escape the evils which came on
the people. Then this verse and the following I would render thus, —

<span id="vii.xv-p12"></span>**13.** Thy wealth and thy treasures for
spoil will I give, Not for a price, but for all thy sins, Even in all
thy borders;

<span id="vii.xv-p13"></span>**14.** And I will make thine enemies to
pass To a land thou knowest not; For a fire has been kindled in my
wrath, On you it shall burn.

<span id="vii.xv-p14"></span>The “enemy” before is now “enemies.” The
verb “make to pass,” has various readings, owing evidently to the
similarity of two letters. The versions, except the *Vulgate*, have “I
will make thee to serve thine enemies;” but the received text is the
most suitable to the passage. *Blayney’s* rendering is, —

<span id="vii.xv-p15"></span>I will cause *them* to pass with thine
enemies —

<span id="vii.xv-p16"></span>By “them” he understands “thy wealth and
thy treasures;” but this sort of construction can hardly be admitted;
and it seems incrongruous. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[144](cc18006.htm#fr_143.md) <span
id="vii.xvii-p11.2"></span>

<span id="vii.xvii-p12"></span> There are distinctions here made not
allowed by the passage. To pray for vengeance on enemies was in
accordance with the covenant made with Abraham, “I will bless them that
bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee,” <span
id="vii.xvii-p12.1"></span>[Ge
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#003.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p12.1"></span>.
See also <span id="vii.xvii-p12.2"></span>[Ge
27:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#029.md)<span

24:9](../../../bib/kjv/num024.htm#009.md)<span id="vii.xvii-p12.3"></span>.
As they were the enemies of God’s servant for delivering his word, they
were the enemies of God himself; and they had already been wholly
repudiated by God, and given up to judgment. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[145](cc18006.htm#fr_144.md) <span
id="vii.xvii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xvii-p16"></span> The versions favor another view. The
*Septuagint* omit the verb, and connect “long-suffering” with the
previous clause, “Defend me from me persecutors, not in thy
long-suffering;” that is, without delay, as the *Targum* literally
expresses it. The *Vulgate* is, “Do not in thy patience take me;” the
*Syriac*, “Do not according to thy long-suffering bring me out;” the
*Arabic*, “Without delay;” it omits the verb, and connects the words
with the former sentence like the *Septuagint*. The words may be thus
literally rendered, —

<span id="vii.xvii-p17"></span>Not in (or, according to) thy
long-suffering receive me;

<span id="vii.xvii-p18"></span>that is, under they care and protection:
he deprecated delay. This is the purport of all the versions, and also
of the *Targum*.

<span id="vii.xvii-p19"></span>*Venema* divides the clause, —

<span id="vii.xvii-p20"></span>Let there be no lengthening of thy wrath;
receive me;  
Know that for thee I have borne reproach.

<span id="vii.xvii-p21"></span>*Blayney’s* version is hardly
intelligible, —

<span id="vii.xvii-p22"></span>Within the length of thine anger
comprehend me not.

<span id="vii.xvii-p23"></span>The meaning of which he says is,
“Lengthen not thy resentment as to comprehend me within its limits.”

<span id="vii.xvii-p24"></span>Probably the rendering of *Cocceius* is
the best, —

<span id="vii.xvii-p25"></span>Do not through thy long-suffering take me
away;

<span id="vii.xvii-p26"></span>that is, “Do not bear long with my
persecutors, and thus allow them to destroy me.”

<span id="vii.xvii-p27"></span>The verb here used seems simply to take;
but it signifies sometimes to take away, and sometimes to take into
favor, to take under protection. The most intelligent rendering seems to
be as follows: —

<span id="vii.xvii-p28"></span>**15.** Thou knowest, Jehova; Remember
me, and visit me, And take vengeance for me on my persecutors; Through
thy long-suffering *towards them* take me not away; Know *that* I have
for thee borne reproach.

<span id="vii.xvii-p29"></span>“Take me not away” means “Suffer me not
to be taken away.” He feared for his life if the vengeance he denounced
on the people was not soon executed. See <span
id="vii.xvii-p29.1"></span>[Jer
15:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#018.md)<span
id="vii.xvii-p29.1"></span>. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[146](cc18006.htm#fr_145.md) <span
id="vii.xx-p12.6"></span>

<span id="vii.xx-p13"></span> The received text has “thy words.”
*Calvin* has followed the *Keri* and the ancient versions, as well as
our version; but “words” being mentioned in the previous line, the same
thing being meant. It is more proper to use “words” here, —

<span id="vii.xx-p14"></span>And thy words were to me for exultation,
And (or, even) for the joy of my heart.

<span id="vii.xx-p15"></span>It is no objection that the verb, which
precedes in Hebrew the noun “words,” is in the singular number; it is
the idiom of the language, which is exactly the same in Welsh.
“Exultation” is the visible effect; “the joy of the heart” is the inward
feeling, the hidden cause. It is common in Scripture to mention the
effect first, and to go back to the cause. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[147](cc18006.htm#fr_146.md) <span
id="vii.xx-p25.2"></span>

<span id="vii.xx-p26"></span> The connection of this clasue is variously
understood. It cannot be considered as a reason for the previous clause.
*Gataker, Grotius*, and others render <span id="vii.xx-p26.1"></span>כי,
*that*, — “that thy name was called upon me,” regarding it as the cause
of his joy, that he was called God’s prophet. *Venema* renders it
*when*, which seems more suitable. But on viewing the whole passage, we
may justly consider this as a reason for the prayer he offers in the
previous verse, so that the latter part of that and the beginning of
this verse are parenthetic. I would give this version, —

<span id="vii.xx-p27"></span>**15.** Thou knowest, Jehonah; Remember me
and visit me, And take vengeance for me on my persecutors; Through thy
long suffering *towards them* take me not away; (Know that I have been
for thee borne reproach;

<span id="vii.xx-p28"></span>**16.** Found have been thy words and I did
eat them; And thy words were to me for exultation, Even for the joy of
my heart;) Because called on me has been thy name, Jehovah *thou* God of
hosts.

<span id="vii.xx-p29"></span>— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[148](cc18006.htm#fr_147.md) <span
id="vii.xxi-p6.4"></span>

<span id="vii.xxi-p7"></span> *Gataker*, and after him *Blayney*,
consider the word, rendered “mockers” by *Calvin* and our version, as
meaning “those who make merry;” and the word is so rendered in our
version in <span id="vii.xxi-p7.1"></span>[Jer
30:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#019.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p7.1"></span>,
and <span id="vii.xxi-p7.2"></span>[Jer
31:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#004.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p7.2"></span>.
The *Septuagint*, the *Vulgate*, and the *Targum*, favor this rendering;
the *Syriac* and the *Arabic*, have “mockers.” Then the next line is, —

<span id="vii.xxi-p8"></span>Nor did I exult on account of thy hand.

<span id="vii.xxi-p9"></span>So all the versions connect the words. The
“hand” means, as *Blayney* says, the impulse of the prophetic spirit.
See <span id="vii.xxi-p9.1"></span>[1Ki
18:46](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#046.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p9.1"></span>;
<span id="vii.xxi-p9.2"></span>[Eze
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#003.md)<span id="vii.xxi-p9.2"></span>. He
did not inconsiderately rejoice on account of his office, because he was
made a prophet. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[149](cc18006.htm#fr_148.md) <span
id="vii.xxi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxi-p15"></span> “Because all the prophecies thou hast
given me are minatory.” — *Grotius*.

<span id="vii.xxi-p16"></span>The meaning may be, “Thou hast filled me
with indignant messages.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[150](cc18006.htm#fr_149.md) <span
id="vii.xxii-p7.5"></span>

<span id="vii.xxii-p8"></span> It is better to retain throughout the
figurative language, —

<span id="vii.xxii-p9"></span>Why has my sore become perpetual, And my
stroke incurable, refusing to be healed?

<span id="vii.xxii-p10"></span>He mentions “sore” first, the effect;
then the “stroke” which casued it. He refers doubtless to the state of
his mind: therefor “the sore” and “the stroke” were the sorrow and the
grief which he experienced. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[151](cc18006.htm#fr_150.md) <span
id="vii.xxii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxii-p12"></span> The *Septuagint* and the *Vulgate*
strangely refer to this stroke or the wound in the previous clause, “It
has become like the deception of inconstant water:” but the gender of
the infinitive added to the verb will not admit of this rendering. It is
literally as follows, —

<span id="vii.xxii-p13"></span>Becoming thou hast become like a
deceiveer, *Like* waters *which* are not constant.

<span id="vii.xxii-p14"></span>The word <span
id="vii.xxii-p14.1"></span>אכזכ is not substantive, but an adjective,
formed like <span id="vii.xxii-p14.2"></span>אכזר, violent. The
quotation from *Chardin*, made by *Blayney*, respecting an illusion in
the deserts of Arabia, occasioned by the sun’s rays on the sand, by
which a vast lake appears, is here out of place, as unfaithful or
inconstant waters, not unreal, is what is expressed. *Calvin’s* view is
no doubt correct. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_151"></span>[152](cc18006.htm#fr_151.md) <span
id="vii.xxv-p10.2"></span>

<span id="vii.xxv-p11"></span> It is extraordinary what shades of
difference appear in the expositions of this verse: but a literal
rendering would, I conceive, dissipate them, —

<span id="vii.xxv-p12"></span>**19.** Therefore thus said Jehovah, — If
thou returnest and I restore thee, Before me shalt thou stand; And if
thou bringest forth the precious from the worthless, As my mouth shalt
thou be; Return shall they to thee, But thou wilt not return to them.

<span id="vii.xxv-p13"></span>The return at the beginning of the verse
was from the state of mind in which he was, to an entire submission to
God. The future is here used in the sense of the present. The “Precious”
was the godly, and the “worthless” the ungodly. The three last lines are
promises. See <span id="vii.xxv-p13.1"></span>[Jer
42:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer042.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.xxv-p13.1"></span>.

<span id="vii.xxv-p14"></span>*Houbigant’s* explanation of the fourth
line is too refined, though approved by *Horsley*. He considers that
there is an allusion to <span id="vii.xxv-p14.1"></span>[Jud
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/jdg014.htm#014.md)<span id="vii.xxv-p14.1"></span>.
Jeremiah himself was “the worthless” or the mean, being so regarded by
the Jews, and “the precious” was the prophetic word. And *Horsley*
renders the line thus, —

<span id="vii.xxv-p15"></span>And if thou wilt bring forth the precious
from the mean.

<span id="vii.xxv-p16"></span>He also approves of *Blayney’s* version of
the second line, and considers it as expressive of a prompt execution of
what is commanded, —

<span id="vii.xxv-p17"></span>If thou wilt turn as I shall turn thee.

<span id="vii.xxv-p18"></span>But the first verb is in *Kal*, and the
second in *Hiphil*, and therefore cannot be rendered the same. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[153](cc18006.htm#fr_152.md) <span
id="vii.xxvi-p6.4"></span>

<span id="vii.xxvi-p7"></span> All the ancient versions are in favor of
the common reading, and there are no MSS. favorable to the proposed
emendation. The Septuagint, the *Vulgate*, the *Syriac*, and the
*Targum*, render it “strong;” and the *Arabic* “fortified.” “A strong
wall of brass,” is the version of *Blayney*. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[154](cc18006.htm#fr_153.md) <span
id="vii.xxvi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xxvi-p13"></span> The words here used are remarkably
precise and significant. I render the verse thus, —

<span id="vii.xxvi-p14"></span>**20.** And I will make thee to this
people A wall of brass, fortified; And they will fight against thee, But
they shall not prevail over thee; For with thee *will* I *be*, To save
thee and to rescue thee, Saith Jehovah.

<span id="vii.xxvi-p15"></span>To “save” was to preserve him from the
hands of his enemies; but if he fell into their hands, he would rescue
him. And this latter idea is more fully expressed in the following
verse, —

<span id="vii.xxvi-p16"></span>Yea, I will rescue thee from the hand of
the malignant, And free thee from the grasp of the terrible.

<span id="vii.xxvi-p17"></span>— *Ed*.
