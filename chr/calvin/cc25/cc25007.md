<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>THE VISION OF THE FOUR BEASTS

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span><span id="viii.i-p3.1"></span>[Da

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span>Our<span id="viii.i-p4.2"></span> preceding
volume having closed the historical portion of Daniel’s Prophecies, our
second volume is occupied with Calvin’s comments upon those Prophetic
Visions, which have ever excited the deepest interest in the minds of
thoughtful Christians. The interval of time from the first verse of this
chapter to the beginning of <span id="viii.i-p4.3"></span>[Daniel
10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.i-p4.3"></span> is
about twenty-two years. The vision of this chapter is the only one
written in Chaldee, and its similarity to that of 2 may account for the
same language being used in both.

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span>The most appropriate method of illustrating
these Lectures, is that of quoting the views of various eminent
Reformers and later divines who have ably discussed the Prophet’s
language, and then comparing them with the solutions proposed by our
Lecturer.

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span><span id="viii.i-p6.1"></span>[Da

The lion with eagle’s wings is supposed to bear some likeness to the
vulture-headed Nisroch, with which the late Assyrian discoveries have
rendered us familiar. *Vaux,* in his “Nineveh and Persepolis,” page 32,
quotes the inquiry of *Beyer* in his notes to Selden’s work *De Diis
Syriis,* as to a connection between this far-famed Assyrian deity and
the representation recorded in this verse. *Rosenmuller* explains the
plucking of the wings as a deprivation of any ornament, or faculty, or
innate vigor, and quotes Cicero, Ep. ad Att., lib. 4, ep. 2, in
reference to this *deplumatio.* The last clause, “a man’s head was given
to it,” is well explained by Jerome of Nebuchadnezzar’s return to his
kingdom after his banishment, and his receiving the heart which he had
lost. The frontispiece on the title-page of *Bonomi*’*s* “Nineveh and
its Palaces,” is a most accurate representation of this verse. The work
contains many excellent engravings, explanatory of the symbolic language
of this Prophet.

The raising of the bear on one side is interpreted by Theodoret and
Jerome of the invasion of the Chaldean empire by the Persian. The
protrusions from its mouth are thought by *Wintle* to be “tusks,” but
*Rosenmuller* objects to this supposition. *Wintle*’*s* notes are on the
whole so very judicious, that we do not hesitate again to recommend the
reader to peruse them, as in most instances they confirm the
interpretations adopted in these Lectures. *Hippolytus,* as quoted by
Oecolampadius *in loc.,* explains the three “ribs” of the three people,
Assyrians, Medes, and Babylonians. The opinion of our Reformer, volume
2, page 16, is sound and satisfactory.

“Four wings on its back.” This symbolical representation occurs in the
Nineveh sculptures. See *Bonomi, page* 257, and elsewhere.

The Fourth Beast of this verse has so usually been treated as the Roman
Empire, that it simply becomes necessary to cite the exceptions to this
opinion. *Rosenmuller* records an attempt to refute this interpretation
by J. C. Becman, in a dissertation on the Fourth Monarchy, published in
1671, at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, and gives a slight sketch of his
argument. *Dr. Todd,* in his able “Lectures on Antichrist,” has made use
of every possible argument against applying this to the Roman Empire,
and his theory has been fairly stated and ably opposed by *Birks* in his
“First Elements of Sacred Prophecy.” London, 1843. With reference to
this fourth beast, *Dr. Todd* believes it to be still future; and hence
his expositions are classed with those of the Futurists. Our readers
will remember, that as an expositor of prophecy, Calvin is a Praeterist,
and that his general system of interpretation is as remote from the
year-day theory of Birks, Faber, and others, as from the futurist
speculations of Maitland, Tyso, and Todd. Notwithstanding the
disagreement between these Lectures and the writings of Birks, we
strongly recommend their perusal by every student who would become
thoroughly proficient in the prophecies of Daniel. The first step
towards progress, is to surrender all our preconceived notions, and to
prepare for the possibility of their vanishing away before the force of
sanctified reason and all-pervading truth.

<span id="viii.i-p10"></span>The Jewish commentators are specially
careful to deny the application of this fourth empire to the Romans.
Rabbis *Aben Ezra* and *Saadiah* interpret it of the Turkish sway, and
extend it to times stilt present and yet future. The Son of man they
hold to be Messiah, who in their opinion has not yet arrived. A
different interpretation has been suggested by Lacunza in La Venda del
Messias en Gloria, y Magestad, translated by the Revelation E. Irving. 2
vols. 8vo. London, 1827. Parte 2 Fenemeno 1. The opinion that the fourth
empire is Alexander and his successors, is contained in *Venema*’*s*
Dissert. ad Vaticin. Daniel emblem. 4to. Leovard, 1745.

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span>*Rabbi Sal. Jarchi* understands the three
ribs of <span id="viii.i-p11.1"></span>[Da
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#005.md)<span id="viii.i-p11.1"></span>, to
be those things of Persia, Cyrus, Ahasuerus, and Darius who destroyed
the Temple. The ten kings he thinks to be the emperors of Rome from
Julius Caesar to Vespasian. The mouth speaking proud things of <span
id="viii.i-p11.2"></span>[Da 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md)<span
id="viii.i-p11.2"></span>, he refers to Titus, thus adopting the
supposition that the fourth empire is heathen Rome.

<span id="viii.i-p12"></span>*Maldonatus* expounds the passage of
heathen Rome, and feels his wrath stirred up against those “Heretics and
Lutherans” who bring it down to Papal times, and rejoices in the
opportunity of quoting Calvin, “their master,” against “the absurdity”
of his disciples. See *Comment.* in Dan., page 673. But the learned
Jesuit ought to have known that the celebrated Abbot Joachim, the
founder of the Florentine order at the close of the 12th century,
interpreted this empire of the mystic Babylon and the Papal Antichrist.
He did not hesitate to apply the dates of this prophecy to the definite
period of three years and a half, from A.D. 1256 to 1260. He was a bold
forerunner of those modern expounders, who take exactly the same view of
the Papacy as himself. See *British Mag.,* volume 16, pages 370 and
following; also pages 494 and following; and *Liber de Flore* Telesforus
Cusentinus. Fol. 29, a. apud Todd, page 460.

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>THE TEN HORNS

<span id="viii.ii-p3"></span><span id="viii.ii-p3.1"></span>[Da
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.ii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p4"></span>The controversy which has arisen between
commentator’s respecting these ten horns, refers first to the question,
were they “kings” or “kingdoms?” And next, if “kings,” who are they? and
if kingdoms, what are they? They are usually supposed to be the kingdoms
into which the Roman Empire was divided. *Vitringa* in his Commentary on
the Apocalypse, page 788, enumerates them after his own method, and the
variety in the reckoning of these kingdoms is so great, that it has been
used by many writers as an objection to their being kingdoms at all.
*Augustine* (*De. civit. Del.,* lib. 20, c. 23) considers the number
“ten” to be indefinite, and to include all the kings of the Roman
Empire. *Willet, in loc.,* has collected a variety of interpretations
from different writers; while *Tyso* gives a table of twenty-nine
distinct lists, shewing that sixty-five different kingdoms and persons
have been suggested. Elucidation of the Prophecies. 8vo, London, 1838,
pages 100-114.

<span id="viii.ii-p5"></span>*Rosenmuller* treats them as kings. With
him the fourth empire is not Rome, but that of the Seleucidae and
Lagidae. By this assumption ten kings are easily found among those who
reigned over both Egypt and Syria between Alexander and Antiochus
Epiphanes, who on this plan is the Little Horn. He simply states his
opinion without supporting it by any arguments. It by no means requires
any, as the statement itself becomes its best refutation. This view was
adopted by *Bertholdt,* and has been overthrown by *Hengstenberg,* with
his usual learning and ability. See pages 164 and following, of the work
cited in volume 1. The determination of some German writers to make
Antiochus Epiphanes the Little Horn, has induced them to divide the four
empires thus: — the Chaldean, Median, Persian, and Macedonian, the last
including the various kingdoms which sprung from it. See Eichorn
*Einl.,* 4to, Ausg., B. 4, page 48; also the works of *Jahn, Dereser, De
Wette,* and *Bleek, ap. Hew. pages* 161-169.

<span id="viii.ii-p6"></span>Some light is thrown on this subject by Fry
in his *Second Advent,* volume 2, page 16, edit. 1822, London. He
translates this and other visions and prophecies of Daniel with great
clearness, and the hundred pages which he devotes to their explanation
are well worthy of perusal. They contain many judicious quotations from
Sir Isaac Newton, Mede, Faber, and the most celebrated English
expounders of prophecy. As he considers the fourth beast the Roman
Empire, and extends its duration throughout the modern history of
Europe, he adopts the views of Bishop Chandler and Faber, as to the ten
horns being ten kingdoms into which that empire was divided after the
irruption of the barbarians. The northern nations parceled out the Roman
Empire among themselves. These nations invaded the empire and settled
within it. Now, it appears from history, that there were ten principal
kingdoms into which the Roman Empire was divided. These ten primary
kingdoms are then enumerated according to Machiavel; but it is beyond
our province to pursue this view of the subject further; it is enough to
refer to *Fry*’*s* translations of difficult passages of this Prophet,
as clear, sound, and judicious. The Editor deems it his duty to point
out the best opinions and explanations wherever he may find them; and to
direct the reader’s attention especially to those which illustrate our
Reformer’s Commentary.

<span id="viii.iii-p2"></span>THE LITTLE HORN

<span id="viii.iii-p3"></span><span id="viii.iii-p3.1"></span>[Da
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md)<span id="viii.iii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p4"></span>The Expositor who sympathizes most with
our Lecturer among writers of our own day, is the late Professor Lee, of
Cambridge. In his translations of the Hebrew Scriptures he is unrivaled;
no scholar of our age can approach him in the extent of his learning or
the soundness of his erudition. His expository system of the prophecies
of Daniel and St. John will meet in these days with the most vehement
condemnation, and it happily does not fall within the province of the
Editor of these Lectures to express any other opinion, than that they
throw light upon the views of our Reformer. It will be sufficient at
present to refer the reader to his valuable work, entitled “An Inquiry
into the Nature, Progress, and End of Prophecy,” Cambridge, 1849. He
discusses the subject of our second volume from page 152, to page 230,
and translates the Hebrew and Chaldee text of Daniel, adding valuable
explanatory notes. Before the student is competent to pass an opinion on
the Professor’s hermeneutical conclusions, he should be intimately
familiar with his elaborate verbal criticisms.

<span id="viii.iii-p5"></span>The fourth kingdom he holds to be the
Roman, and specifies, especially, “the Lower Roman Empire;” the ten
horns are “a series of kings, each serves constituting a universal
empire for the time being” The Little Horn is said to be “the latter
rule of the Roman power,” (p. 165.) All reference to Antiochus Epiphanes
is denied; and the argument is concluded by the following sentence, —
“By every consideration, therefore, it is evident that the Little Horn
of Daniel’s seventh and eighth chapters is identically the same, and
that this symbolized that system of Roman rule which ruined Jerusalem,
and then made war upon the sainted servants and followers of the Son of
man; and in this he prospered and practiced, until he in his turn fell,
as did his predecessors, to rise no more at all,” (p. 168.)

<span id="viii.iii-p6"></span>This vision has been ably and fully
illustrated by Professor *Bush* of New York, in “the Hierophant,” 1844;
and as the American Professor’s “exposition” is exceedingly clear, and
full, and instructive, a few quotations from it are inserted here. “We
propose, if possible, to ascertain the true character of the judgment
here depicted, and by a careful collation of other Scriptures to
determine its relations to the series of events connected with the
second coming of Christ and its grand cognate futurities.” “This Little
Horn,” he asserts, “is unquestionably the ecclesiastical power of the
Papacy,” and “the judgment commences a considerable time prior to the
transition of the beast from his pagan to his Christian state.”... “This
horn did not arise till after the empire received its deadly wound by
the hands of the Goths.” This divergence from the sentiments of our
Reformer compels us to avoid quoting at greater length Professor Bush’s
scheme of interpretation. It is ably planned and carefully executed. He
supposes the Little Horn to prevail against the saints for 1260 years;
adding, “nothing is more notorious than that the Roman Empire, after
subsisting not far from the space of 1260 years from its foundation, did
succumb to the sword of its Gothic invader, and about A.D. 476 became
imperially extinct, under its then existing head.” This forms another
period for the supposed termination of the 1260 years, very different
from that usually maintained by British authors. It is said to be
renewed again in the time of Charlemagne, and the testimony of Sigonius,
Hist. de Reg. Ital., Book 4, page 1.58, is quoted in proof of this. See
Hierophant, page 156.

<span id="viii.iv-p3"></span>THE ANCIENT OF DAYS — THE SON OF MAN

7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md)<span id="viii.iv-p4.1"></span> and
<span id="viii.iv-p4.2"></span>[Da
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md)<span id="viii.iv-p4.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p5"></span>This expression is treated actively by
*Wintle,* — “He that maketh the days old,” and, consequently, ready to
expire or cease. The Deity he supposes to be meant by this term, and
refers us for an explanation of the human attributes assigned to the
Divine Being, to Dr. Sam. Clarke’s Sermons, volume 1, Discertation 5.
*Grotius* very appositely reminds us that the ancient thrones and *since
circles* had wheels; and *Rosenmuller* treats them as indicating the
velocity with which God beholds and judges all things. Some Jewish
writers read thrones were taken away; implying’ the overthrow of the
dominions of this world, and the setting up of flint of Messiah. Both
Rabbis *Levi* and *Saadias* apply this passage to the future prosperity
of Israel alone.

<span id="viii.iv-p6"></span>*OecoIampadius* supposes Christ to be here
signified as the lamb slain from the beginning of the world, and
therefore “Ancient.” After quoting Chrysostom and Basil on the phrase,
“The books were opened,” he pointedly inquires, “But what need of books?
every man’s conscience will be its own open volume.” The Christian tone
of this commentator’s sentiments renders his writings far more valuable
than most of those of his own and of succeeding ages. It treats this
chapter with his usual skill and spirituality, differing however in some
points from the general tenor of these Lectures. It enumerates the four
visions of these last six chapters: the first and last of them, he
states, relate to the persecutions to arise under Antichrist the second,
in <span id="viii.iv-p6.1"></span>[Daniel
8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.iv-p6.1"></span>, to
the profanation of the Temple under Antiochus; and the third, in the
ninth chapter, to its devastation under Titus. He does not take the word
“kings” for the monarch simply, but includes under the term their
counselors, warriors, and ministers of state. “A king” with hint, refers
to a monarch’s successors as well as himself. He quotes at length from
Eusebius, Evan. Dem., book 15, the well-known passage in which this
vision is recorded at full length. His illustrations of the first three
beasts is judicious, and we have previously stated (volume 1, page 427)
his view of the fourth empire as coinciding with Calvin’s. He refutes
the comments of Polychronius and Aben Ezra, who apply the fourth kingdom
to Alexander’s successors; and objects to Jerome, and Lactantius, and
Ireneus, who treat the ten kings as ten monarchies springing from
heathen Rome. The number ten is not taken literally, but mystically, for
a perfect number, that is, one made up by adding one and two, and three
and four. The ten horns, he thinks, follow the fourth beast, existing
during his; own age and leading on directly to Antichrist. He approves
of Apollinarius, who interprets the 8th verse of Antichrist, and then
explains, very copiously, his sentiments as to where he is to be found.
“Very possibly,” he remarks, “the Gregories, the Alexanders, and the
Julii, did not displease God so strikingly while occupying the Papal
chair: God only is their judge. But during this reign such innumerable
enormities are committed as are worthy of the true Antichrist, and thus
rebound upon their heads.” He then runs the parallel between Mohamed and
the Papacy, and with great accuracy and spirit treats the false prophet
as the Antichrist of the east, and the Roman Pontiff as corresponding to
him throughout the west. The “eyes of a man” of <span
id="viii.iv-p6.2"></span>[Da 7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md)<span
id="viii.iv-p6.2"></span>, are explained of the bland and benignant
appearance of this insinuating personage, while the blasphemies of his
mouth are interpreted of the impious boastings of Mohamed and the Pope.
The manner in which both Mohamed and the Papacy have “changed the
times,” is amply discussed, and the language of both Daniel and St. John
made applicable to the modern history of the religions of the Crescent
and the Cross throughout both Asia and Europe.

<span id="viii.iv-p7"></span>In commenting on <span
id="viii.iv-p7.1"></span>[Da 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md)<span
id="viii.iv-p7.1"></span>, he refers it to the future destination of
Antichrist, and comparing’ this passage with St. John, states his view
of the three and a half years, or forty-two months, or half-week. Seven
is a perfect number representing perpetuity, and God who is perpetually
angry stops half way in his course of punishment. Oecolampadius is
severe upon the Chiliasts, similar to the Futurists of our day, who
expect one personal Antichrist yet to be revealed. Although he calls
them “semi-Jews,” yet their solution of this great problem of prophecy
may after all turn out to be the right one, and Christendom hereafter
may yet vindicate their far-seeing sagacity. The remainder of the
chapter is connected with the second coming of Christ to judgment, and
the final victory of the saints when the harvest of the world shall be
gathered in, and “the righteous shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of
their Father.” The introduction of the Antichrist and the Papacy with
the Mohammedan imposture, existing as they have done for many years
since the first advent, and as it is assumed they will do till the
second advent, gives the tone to the comments of Oecolampadius very
different from that of Calvin. It becomes highly instructive to compare
and contrast them, as in this way we may derive profit from both, and
correct our own presumption, if we are tempted to esteem either as
necessarily and exclusively perfect.

<span id="viii.iv-p8"></span><span id="viii.iv-p8.1"></span>[Da
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md)<span id="viii.iv-p8.1"></span>. —
“The thrones were cast down” — Authorized Version. Professor *Bush*
agrees with Calvin, volume 2, page 32, in preferring were *set, placed,
or arranged,* bringing forward as his supporters, Jerome, Arias
Montanus, the Syriac, Arabic, and Genevan versions, besides Luther’s and
Diodati’s. “The saints who are subsequently said to have possessed the
kingdom formed the celestial conclave, and sat upon the encircling
thrones.” He prefers the meaning, “Permanent of days,” or, “Enduring of
days,” to the common rendering “Ancient of days.” Cocccius favors this
expression, and also Michaelis, who assigns the primary sense of
enduring and abiding to the Hebrew word. See also <span
id="viii.iv-p8.2"></span>[Job
31:7](../../../bib/kjv/job031.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.iv-p8.2"></span>,
and <span id="viii.iv-p8.3"></span>[Isa
33:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#018.md)<span id="viii.iv-p8.3"></span>.
The designation, *enduring of days,* undoubtedly carries with it a
latent contrast to the many vicissitudes, and the transient nature of
the thrones and kingdoms here shadowed forth as the antagonist dominions
to that of God everlasting. He then quotes Calvin’s remarks on this
verse as “singularly appropriate and striking.” His garment (literally)
was as the white snow. The resplendent white of his spotless garments
indicated the exquisite equity, justice, and impartiality of his
judgments, while the locks of his hair, purer than the washed wool of
the fairest fleeces, indicate nothing of the imbecility of extreme old
age, but the considerate gravity, the ripened reflection, the mature
wisdom, the enlightened experience, the venerable authority, and the
calm decision, which are naturally associated with the “hoary head.”
Referring to the fairy throne and the burning wheels, he adds, “As the
entire gorgeous apparatus described by the Prophet, has reference
primarily to a period anterior to new Testament times, when the kingdom
of God had not yet obtained that fixedness which is attributed to it in
subsequent visions, therefore his throne is represented with the
accompaniment of wheels. The scene, he states, “Is a judgment which
transpires on the earth in the providence of God, and not a judgment at
the end of the world, as often understood by the readers of
revelation.”... “The scenery is to be regarded as *ideal* and not
*real.* It is the celestial shadow of a terrestrial reality. The whole
scene, which is impartially described as transpiring in heaven, does
really take place in the providence of God on earth, so these judges and
co-assessors are really men, who are made agents in executing the divine
purposes relative to the overthrow of the anti-Christian dominion
represented by the Beast and the Little Horn.” The professor, though
differing from Calvin on some points, strongly corroborates his opinions
on others. The statements on pages 26 and 28 of this volume are expanded
and enforced in various passages in the Hierophant. For instance, on
page 109, “That the vision and scene does not refer to what is usually
termed ‘the last judgment’ to take place at some future period, and
simultaneously with the final resurrection and consummation of all
things, is obvious from the whole tenor of the vision. The judgment is a
local judgment, and the object of it, not the whole race of men, but a
particular despotic, persecuting, idolatrous, and blasphemous power,
which the counsels of heaven have doomed to destruction.” This is
entirely in accordance with *Faber.* See Calvin of Proph., volume 2,
page 108.

<span id="viii.iv-p9"></span><span id="viii.iv-p9.1"></span>[Da

The Son of Man. He is usually admitted to be the Messiah. *Hengstenberg*
remarks upon our Lord’s reasons for using this designation of himself.
He aptly compares various passages in St. Matthew’s Gospel with those of
this chapter, and shews how they bear upon the genuineness of Daniel’s
prophecies.)

<span id="viii.iv-p10"></span>*Oecolampadius* refutes the notions of the
Jews who treat the phrase “the Son of man,” as their own nation. He
argues against Rabbi Saadias and the Chiliasts, and after fully
upholding the union of the divine with the human natures in Christ, he
approves of the instructive comments of Chrysostom and Cyril. His coming
to the Ancient of Clays is explained by St. Paul’s assert. ion, He shall
deliver up the kingdom to his Father; and thus the victory of the saints
becomes that final triumph of righteousness, which shall be visibly
displayed at the second advent of the Redeemer.

<span id="viii.iv-p11"></span>The possession of the kingdom by the

was interpreted by the early Fathers, of the general spread of
Christianity after *the first* advent. Professor *Lee,* in replying to
Dr. Todd, has collected their testimony to the reign of Christ and his
saints, as spread far and wide in the very earliest period of the Gospel
history. His list of authorities will support the system of
interpretation adopted by Calvin

<span id="viii.iv-p17"></span>For the Professor’s own view, see his
Treatise on the Covenants, page 112 and following. He is ably supported
by Professor *Bush,* who correctly limits this vision to the first
establishment of the reign of Messiah, and the early preaching of the
Gospel. The American Professor throws great light on the passage, by a
clear and comprehensive criticism on the Hebrew words. His remarks on
the Son of man coming with the clouds of heaven, are ingenious. He does
not understand the word “clouds” in its ordinary sense, but as denoting
“a multitude of heavenly attendants.” He quotes <span
id="viii.iv-p17.1"></span>[1Th
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#017.md)<span id="viii.iv-p17.1"></span>,
from which he concludes that the meaning is not that we shall be caught
up into the clouds, but in multitudes. The Son of man being brought to
the Ancient of days is said to set forth the investiture of the Son of
man with that vice-regal lordship, which he, in the divine economy, held
over the nations of the earth and through the perpetuity of time. “The
paramount question to be resolved, is that of the true epoch of this
ordained assumption by the Messiah of the majesty of the kingdom. He
then determines the question exactly as Calvin does, by saying, “This we
think is plainly to be placed at the Savior’s ascension.”... “It is in
this passage of Daniel that we find the germ of nearly all the
announcements of the New Testament, relative to the founding of that
spiritual monarchy.”... “Conceiving the clouds then, in the Prophet’s
vision, as being really clouds of angels, we shall be better prepared to
understand the drift of the New Testament narrative, <span
id="viii.iv-p17.2"></span>[Ac 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#009.md)<span
id="viii.iv-p17.2"></span>. It was by this cloud of celestial attendants
that he was brought, in the language of Daniel, to the Ancient of days,
for him to receive the seals, as it were, of that high office which he
was to fill as head of the universal spiritual empire now to be set up.”
There is, therefore, we conceive, no greater mistake in regard to the
whole rationale of this prophecy, than to understand the judgment and
the coming of the Son of man here mentioned, as the final judgment and
final coming of Christ synchronical with an anticipated physical
catastrophe of the globe.

<span id="viii.iv-p18"></span>Professor *Bush* quotes Calvin on <span
id="viii.iv-p18.1"></span>[Da
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#012.md)<span id="viii.iv-p18.1"></span>
with approbation, and adds the Rabbinical paraphrase of Jaachiades, in
support of their joint conclusions. *Vitringa,* in his Dissertations on
the Emblems of this Prophet, page 504, elicits a different sense. He
makes the “life” and the “dominion” identical. Sir J. Newton maintains
that the three beasts were, in the eye of prophecy, still living in his
day, and were to be sought for where their geographical seat existed at
the time of their ascendancy. — *Observ. on Daniel, page* 31. Although
Bishop Newton and others agree with him, there is no foundation for this
ingenious conjecture*. Mede*’*s* view is different still, and *Bush*
points out “a serious and probably an insuperable objection to it;”
while he glides off himself to the “leading despotisms of the East,
including perhaps those of Russia and Turkey,” contrary to the
sentiments expressed in page 26 of this volume See pages 162, 163.

<span id="viii.iv-p19"></span>An important question has arisen among
Commentators, as to the import of the word “kings” in <span
id="viii.iv-p19.1"></span>[Da
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#017.md)<span id="viii.iv-p19.1"></span>.
Does it refer to *persons or to dynasties?* Professor *Bush* argues for
a symbolical sense, and quotes Theodotion, who renders it “kingdoms.” It
is next asserted, that the term kingdom is not to be applied to “a
purely regal form of government,” but to “any form of national existence
in which we can recognize in established ruling power.” *Havernick*
remarks, that “kings” here stands in the concrete for dynasties or
kingdoms, the representation of kingdoms for the kingdoms themselves.
The word “kingship” expresses this idea of Havernick’s better than
kingdom. *Bush* treats it as a *denomination potiore,* which he aptly
translates “*a titling from the chief.*”

<span id="viii.iv-p20"></span><span id="viii.iv-p20.1"></span>[Da
7:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#018.md)<span id="viii.iv-p20.1"></span>.
— The Saints of the Most High. This phrase is said by *Bush* to indicate
the Jews, “as forming a part at least of the saints who are to be the
possessors of the kingdom here spoken of.” There are strong grounds for
believing that the holy people which were to be destroyed and scattered,
(<span id="viii.iv-p20.2"></span>[Da
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#024.md)<span id="viii.iv-p20.2"></span>,
and <span id="viii.iv-p20.3"></span>[Da
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007)<span id="viii.iv-p20.3"></span>,.md)
were the Jews. Daniel’s grief was occasioned, in great measure, by a
foresight of the cruel oppressions to which *his own people* were to be
subjected during the dominion of the Beast and Little Horn.” The plural
form of the word, which Calvin accurately preserves and notices, is said
to recall, “that holy and devoted people who are born from above.” Bush
translates *sancti altissimorum,* the saints of the most High Ones.

<span id="viii.v-p2"></span>THE PROPHETIC MEANING OF “A TIME.”

<span id="viii.v-p3"></span><span id="viii.v-p3.1"></span>[Da
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md)<span id="viii.v-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p4"></span>It is important to determine accurately the
meaning of this and similar phrases. The word “time” is, as Calvin
remarks, naturally indefinite, while its use in this Prophet leads to
the conclusion that it means “years.” The passage in <span
id="viii.v-p4.2"></span>[Da 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan004.htm#016.md)<span
id="viii.v-p4.2"></span>, “Seven times,” is usually understood to mean
seven years, although nothing can fairly rest upon this interpretation.
The phrase of this verse is usually taken to mean half of seven times,
and is used again in <span id="viii.v-p4.3"></span>[Da
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.v-p4.3"></span>.
The other passages which refer to periods of time are expressed more
definitely, for instance, 2300 “evenings and mornings,” <span
id="viii.v-p4.4"></span>[Da
8:14-26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#014.md)<span id="viii.v-p4.4"></span>;
the seventy weeks or seven, <span id="viii.v-p4.5"></span>[Da
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)<span id="viii.v-p4.5"></span>;
the 1290 “days,” <span id="viii.v-p4.6"></span>[Da
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md)<span id="viii.v-p4.6"></span>,
and the 1335 days, <span id="viii.v-p4.7"></span>[Da
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#012.md)<span id="viii.v-p4.7"></span>.
“The terms in the first four instances,” says Bickersteth, in his
Practical Guide to the Prophecies, edit. sixth, 1839, page 184, “are in
themselves quite ambiguous and general. There is nothing to determine,
respecting the number 2300, and the seventy weeks, whether years or days
be intended; but analogy would lead us to suppose that all were to be
interpreted on a common principle.” He goes on to say, “It appears from
<span id="viii.v-p4.8"></span>[Da
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.v-p4.8"></span>,
that the close of the three times and a half is closely connected with
the gathering of the Jews; and from <span id="viii.v-p4.9"></span>[Zec
1:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#018.md)<span id="viii.v-p4.9"></span>,
that the power of the four Gentile monarchies is then broken; and this
confirms the extended meaning of both. God looks at the whole course of
this world’s history as but a few days. Daniel, when he heard the period
of the times and a half announced by the angel, understood not, and on
inquiry received the answer, *The words are sealed to the time of the
end;* and an intimation is given, that even when unsealed, only *the
wise would understand.* We thus learn that the meaning couched under
this expression was purposely concealed for a time, but was afterwards
to be unfolded to the wise. The promise is not of a fresh revelation,
but of an explanation of a period already given. And there seems to have
been a wise end in this veiling of the time, as it would have been
staggering to the faith, and deadening to the hopes of the Israelites,
if the whole of the interval had been openly and explicitly declared,”
*page* 186. This excellent man was an advocate of the symbolizing sense
of chronological expressions; thus on the “seven times,” he says; “this
seems plainly to denote the season during which the Gentile dominion of
the four monarchies should be corrupt and worldly, as afterwards
exhibited in the four beasts coming up from the sea.” Again, “the seven
times” would then answer to “the times of the Gentiles” mentioned by our
Lord. He also makes the following statements — “The time, times, and
half a time, the forty-two months and 1260 days, are the same interval;
the time, times, and half, of Daniel and the Revelation are the same
period; a prophetic day is a natural year; the three and a half times
are the half of seven times, the whole season of Gentile power, and the
same with the latter times of St. Paul. A time denotes 360 years, and
*chronos* is equivalent to *kairos,*” (p. 365.) As these assertions are
not to be found anywhere in Holy Scripture, Calvin has manifested his
wisdom, by expounding the text as he finds it, and avoiding all
conjectural statements. As a specimen, however, of a scheme on the
opposite principles to those maintained in these Lectures, we will quote
one final passage on this subject, headed Particular Times, (p. 366.)
“The time, times, and half, and 1260 days of Revelation are the same
period. The forty-two months have a date rather later, like the two
dates of the seventy years’ captivity;” (yet observe the previous
extract. — Ed) “The 1290 and 1335 days of Daniel both commence with the
1260 days of Revelation, or time, times, and a half, of both prophecies;
the seven times of the Gentiles begin with the subjection of Israel
under Shamanezer; the three and a half times begin with Justinian’s
eternal code, A.D. 532-3; the forty-two months close nearly with the
1335 days; the forty-two months begin A.D. 604, or A.D. 607-8, with the
re-union of the ten kingdoms, or the public establishment of idolatry;
the 1335 days end in A.D. 1867-8.” The arguments in favor of this
theory, directed chiefly against the Futurists, are found in the “First
Elements of Sacred Prophecy,” from chapter. 12, page 308, to the end of
the volume. Similar discussions are contained in “The Morning Watch,”
*passim,* especially one on “The Sacred numbers,” volume 5, pages
273-285, London, 1832. The reader who is curious in such numerical
calculations will find much to his taste in the volumes of this
periodical.

<span id="viii.v-p5"></span>*Brooks,* in his useful compendium,
“Elements of Prophetical Interpretation,” has devoted <span
id="viii.v-p5.1"></span>[Daniel
10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.v-p5.1"></span> to
“Time mystically expressed.” He examines at full length the argument of
*Maitland,* who contends for the literal meaning of days, in “An Inquiry
into the grounds on which the prophetic period of Daniel and St. John
has been supposed to consist of 1260 years.” *Brooks* brings forward the
usual reasonings by which the literal meaning of the word “day” is
supposed to be overthrown, and combats *Maitland* with much spirit. He
settles it rather positively, that “the literal meaning of a time is a
year, and then considers the expression of this verse 25, “may signify,
mystically, if calculated by lunar time, a period of 1260 years.” Some,
it is added, “have considered that a time means mystically a century of
years.” *Vitringa* states this to be the view of the Waldenses, who
hoped for a speedy termination to their persecutions, and were persuaded
that the anti-christian power which opposed them could only last 350
years. *Bengelius* at one time adopts, and at another rejects the
year-day explanation, and modifies it according to his pleasure in his
“Introduction to the Interpretation of the Apocalypse,” translated by
Robertson, pages 147, 212, 258. “Another important principle to be kept
in view is, the high probability that there may be a mystical
fulfillment of some of the dates and facts connected with the
chronological prophecies, and a literal fulfillment likewise.”
Speculations of this kind are by no means in the spirit of Calvin’s
comments; he carefully avoids all such expressions as “mystical days,”
yet the reader will find in this little volume many extracts from
writers of repute, illustrating the prominent features of Daniel’s
prophecies.

<span id="viii.v-p6"></span>Professor *Bush,* in the Hierophant, page
180, comments with great critical ability upon the Hebrew word
signifying “time” in this verse. He compares it with the word <span
id="viii.v-p6.1"></span>ןמז, *zemen,* correctly rendered “season” in the
authorized version. The leading sense of this word, he states, “is that
of a fixed, prescribed, determinate season,” and in this respect it
differs from the more general word time, as the Greek *kairos,*
“season,” differs from *chronos,* time. As to the other word <span
id="viii.v-p6.2"></span>ןדע *gneden* is used for the most part in a
wider sense, and answers more accurately to the Hebrew <span
id="viii.v-p6.3"></span>תע *Gneth,* “time.” “We find mention made in the
last chapter of Daniel of two other periods, one of 1290, the other of
1335 years.” The additional numbers expressing 30 and 45 similar
periods, are called supplementary terms. At page 241 there is an able
letter to Professor *Stuart* of Andover, U.S., on prophet, in
designations of time. This learned writer is like Calvin, praeterits,
and consequently his writings on this subject; are an able elucidation
of the principles of these lectures. He approves of *Davidson*’*s*
statement in his “Sacred I-Hermeneutics,” that days are days, and years
years. So the writer maintains with no small skill and power of
argumentation. Professor *Bush,* on the other hand, replies, “the grand
principle into which the usage of employing a day for year is to be
resolved, is that of *miniature symbolization.*” The argument between
the two American divines is then carried on at some length; it is only
necessary here to refer to it, on the general principle which we have
adopted in illustrating these lectures, namely, to shew that Calvin’s
decision meets with many able supporters and expounders among British,
Continental, and American writers, as well as numerous, earnest, and
voluminous opponents.

<span id="viii.vi-p2"></span>THE PLACE OF THE VISION.

<span id="viii.vi-p3"></span><span id="viii.vi-p3.1"></span>[Da
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#002.md)<span id="viii.vi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p4"></span>Differences have arisen as to the reality
of Daniel’s transfer to Shushan and the banks of the Ulai or Choaspes.
Dr. Blayney thinks Elam was a province of Babylon over which Daniel
actually presided; but in its more extended sense it comprised the whole
country on either side of the Eulaeus, one side being Elymais, and the
other Susiana. See Pliny, Nat. Hist., Book 6. “Susiana,” says Birks,
“close to the Tigris, was distinct from Persia Proper, and might still
be under the power of Belshazzar.”

<span id="viii.vi-p5"></span>In this eighth chapter the Hebrew language
is resumed, and used in all the following visions. This has been
considered emblematical of the subject-matter which relates mainly to
the future state of Israel, and of the kingdoms in political relation to
it. The visions of this chapter clearly refer to the Persian and Grecian
empires. These are intimately connected with those persecutions under
which the Jews groaned so heavily, through the profanation of their
Temple, and the removal of their daily sacrifice. These distresses
continue for 2300 days till the sanctuary is cleansed. The reader will
find these points clearly and historically illustrated in “the two later
visions of Daniel” previously referred to, — <span
id="viii.vi-p5.1"></span>[Daniel
1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.vi-p5.1"></span> and
2. The exposition of the Duke of Manchester is worthy of notice. He
compares and connects the visions and prophecies of <span
id="viii.vi-p5.2"></span>[Daniel
8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.vi-p5.2"></span> and
9, and differs from the usual schemes hitherto submitted to our notice.
See pages 392-397. “The vision embraces a period of time commencing from
after the conquest of India by Darius, until the last end of the
indignation, for the ram was pushing westward, northward, and southward,
but not eastward.”

<span id="viii.vii-p1"></span>Dissertation 7.

<span id="viii.vii-p2"></span>THE RAM AND THE HE-GOAT.

<span id="viii.vii-p3"></span>Chapter 8:3

<span id="viii.vii-p4"></span>The clearest modern exposition with which
the Editor is acquainted is that of *Birks,* and it will be sufficient
for our purpose to make a few extracts from his work. “The ram is
expounded by the angel to be the kings of Media and Persia.” It is
clear, then, that the word *kings* is not used in a personal sense. It
is plain they are the two ruling dynasties or powers, confederate in
conquest, and of which Media was superior at first, and Persia after the
sole reign of Cyrus. The ram itself, and not the two horns, denotes the
compound Median and Persian power. The ram was seen “pushing westward,
and northward, and southward.” These words are a very clear prediction
of the conquests of Cyrus, though, perhaps, they may include the later
conquests of Egypt by his son Cambyses. “The vision was in the sixth or
seventh year of Cyrus, when his career of victory had already begun,”
(p. 10.) Two objections to this explanation are then answered; one is,
that the chronology seems to require a later commencement, and the
other, that the place of the ram before the river, has been thought to
imply the previous establishment of the Persian empire. The most natural
sense of the words “before the river,” is, “with its face to the river.”
The accomplishment of this prophecy is then traced through Herodotus,
and Xenophon. The narratives of Herod. Book 1:71-95, respecting the
overthrow of Croesus, and 152-216, respecting his victories in Upper
Asia, clearly support this view of the fulfillment.

<span id="viii.vii-p5"></span>The he-goat is so clearly fulfilled in
Alexander, that, no further remark seems required. Birks has translated
at length the passages in Diodorus, and given a correct summary of the
chronology of this period. See also Alexander in Plutarch, chapter 24,
Diod. Sic., lib. 17, section 46, and Quint. Curtius, lib. 4, section. 4,
19.

SPEAKING TO ANOTHER.

<span id="viii.viii-p4"></span>Chapter 8:13

<span id="viii.viii-p5"></span>A very peculiar Hebrew word is used to
designate the second Holy One. Lowth intimates its connection with the
Logos. It may properly be translated, “To the excellent one.” The
original word <span id="viii.viii-p5.2"></span>ינומלפ*, palmoni,* is
supposed to be formed of two nouns <span
id="viii.viii-p5.3"></span>ינולפ, *peloni,* and <span
id="viii.viii-p5.4"></span>ינומלא*, almoni,* which are found in <span
id="viii.viii-p5.5"></span>[Ru
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/rut004.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.viii-p5.5"></span>,
and <span id="viii.viii-p5.6"></span>[2Ki
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#008.md)<span id="viii.viii-p5.6"></span>
*Glass. gram.,* 4, 3, 864, as quoted in Poole’s Syn., calls them
fictitious nouns, being used when the real name is purposely concealed,
like the <span id="viii.viii-p5.7"></span>ὁ δεῖνα of the Greeks. Hence
it does not signify any angel, but some remarkable one. *Calvin*’*s*
opinion that it refers to Messiah is held by many other interpreters, as
given by Poole *in loc. Wintle* adopts another view, — “the numberer of
secrets,” or, “the wonderful numberer,” from the two words <span
id="viii.viii-p5.8"></span>אלפ*, phla,* “wonderful,” used by Isaiah of
Messiah in the well-known passage in chapter. 9, and <span
id="viii.viii-p5.9"></span>הנמ*,* “to number,” which has already come
before us. He refers to Glass. Philippians page 644, 4to, and
translates, “And another saint said unto that excellent one that was
speaking.” Holy One is preferable to saint in this passage. *Gesenius*
adopts the statement of Glasse; the quadriliteral arising from the
combination of two words in common use. See also “The Times of Daniel,”
page 399, and “The Morning Watch,” volume 5, page 276, where *palmoni*
is translated “the numberer of secrets.”

<span id="viii.viii-p6"></span><span id="viii.viii-p6.1"></span>[Da
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#013.md)<span id="viii.viii-p6.1"></span>.
— The Vision of the Daily Sacrifice. The translation of this passage is
of great importance, Professor *Lee* translates as follows: —

<span id="viii.viii-p7"></span>**11** By him the daily sacrifice was to
be taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was to be cast down.

<span id="viii.viii-p8"></span>**12** And an army was to be given him
against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, (*i.e.,* because
the transgressors had now come to the full: see note, page 165,) and it
cast the truth to the ground, and it practiced and prospered.

<span id="viii.viii-p9"></span>**13** How long shall be the vision
concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to
give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?

<span id="viii.viii-p10"></span>**14** The answer is, unto 2300 days;
then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.

<span id="viii.viii-p11"></span>The wording of the Hebrew is peculiar
here and highly deserving of remark. It stands literally thus, — “Until
(the) evening (and) morning, or it may be until the evening of the
morning, two thousand and three hundred, and the sanctuary (lit.
holiness) shall be sanctified.” Evening and morning, I take here to be a
mere periphrasis for a day; and so our translators have taken it, <span
id="viii.viii-p11.1"></span>[Ge
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#005.md)<span id="viii.viii-p11.1"></span>.
The day here had in view, continues Professor Lee, “must mark the period
of Daniel’s seventieth week — the numbers given above must be understood
indefinitely, and as intended to designate a considerable length of
time.” Referring again to <span id="viii.viii-p11.2"></span>[Da
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#011.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p11.2"></span>, he states, this consummation could not be
effected by Antiochus Epiphanes: he only suspended the service of the
Temple for about three years and a half. By every consideration,
therefore, it is evident that the Little Horn of Daniel’s seventh and
eighth chapters, is identically the same, and that this symbolized that
system of *Roman rule* which ruined Jerusalem, and then made war upon
the sainted servants and followers of the Son of man; and in this he
prospered and practiced, until he in his turn fell, as did his
predecessors, to rise no more at all. (P. 168.) *Wintle,* with his usual
judgment, translates, “until the evening (and) morning 2300.” “I insert
the word *and,* because the *vau* is repeated at <span
id="viii.viii-p11.3"></span>[Da
8:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#026.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p11.3"></span>. I am inclined to think this *vesperamane*
should induce us to understand these days in the first instance
literally, rather than of months and years.” The great difficulty, he
states, is to reconcile this period with the tyranny of Antiochus; while
he does not forget the reference to Antichrist, of whom Antiochus was
the type. See, also Sir Isaac Newton, Obs., chapter 9. *Rosenmuller* has
collected various explanations, especially C. B. *Bertram; Kirms,* in
his historical and critical commentary, page 39; *Melancthon, page* 131;
and *Eichhorn* in *Apoc.,* t. 2, page 60. “The Times of Daniel” also
contains a translation of this passage which is worth notice, page 400,
although it is not so scholar-like as that quoted above.

<span id="viii.viii-p12"></span>The opinion that this period refers to
the rise and duration of the Mohammedan power in the East, is ably
advocated by *Fry,* “Second Advent,” volume 2, page 43 and following;
where various explanations of the dates are given at length.

9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024.md)<span id="viii.ix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p5"></span>A great variety of opinions have been
published upon this interesting period; it would be impossible to
enumerate them all, and it will be sufficient to allude to those which
illustrate Calvin’s assertions. The titled author of “The Times of
Daniel” writes as follows, — “I endeavored to shew in the chronology
that there were two periods of seventy years, — one, the service of
Babylon, the other the desolation of Jerusalem, and that the
desolation’s terminated with the first year of Darius Nothus. I hope to
establish presently that the termination of each of these periods is a
fresh epoch,” page 400. “The decree dates from the time of Daniel’s
prayer. The command came forth, therefore, in the first year of Darius
son of Ahasuerus,” page 402. He then strongly approves of the rendering
of the passage by Hengstenberg. “Seventy weeks are cut off over thy
people and over thy holy city.” Exactly Calvin’s use of the preposition
*super.* And he adds, most Commentators observe that “*cut* off” is used
figuratively for determined. *Mede* is also quoted to the same effect,
works, fol. page 497. I am still able to follow Dr. Hengstenberg in the
following clause, “to restrain transgression and to seal sin.” All
senses of the verb, says he, unite in that of restraining. To seal sin,
holds forth God’s judicial hardening of persons in sin. This passage,
the Duke thinks, was fulfilled “before the passover, in the year A.D.
67.” The *terminus a quo* is said to be the first year of Darius the son
of Ahasuerus, whose date is given in Ptolemy’s Canon An. Nabonassar 325,
which, according to the method of verifying the date here used, is b.c.
424, “which, added to the year when apostasy was no longer restrained,
A.D. 66, makes 70 weeks or 490 years.” Original views of the “sealing”
and the sixty-two weeks are also proposed, to which we can only refer:
see pages 410-422. The closing calculation, that “we may look for the
cleansing of the sanctuary A.D. 1877,” is so adverse to the
interpretation of these Lectures, that we must be content with this
passing allusion to it.

<span id="viii.ix-p6"></span>The opinions of certaii1 celebrated writers
upon this point are here collected. *Clement* of Alexandria, according
to the late Bishop of Lincoln, page 383, explains it thus: “The Temple
was rebuilt in seven weeks: then, after an interval of sixty-two weeks,
the Messiah came. then, after an interval of half a week, Nero placed an
abomination in the Temple of Jerusalem: and, after another half-week,
the Temple was destroyed by Vespasian.” *Theodoret* closes the period
three years and a half after the suffering of Christ: “and so they begin
the last week at the baptism of Christ,” says Willet. He quotes
*Zonaras,* tom. 1, *Annal.,* who commences the period at the 20th year
of Artaxerxes Longimanus, and ends the 62 weeks at the death of
Hyrcanus. From this point to Christ’s baptism they reckon seven weeks
more, and then in the midst of the last week, Messiah was slain; so
there remained afterwards three years and a half for the preaching of
the Gospel. *Eusebius* begins the 69 weeks in the sixth year of Darius
Itystaspes, and ends them in the first year of Herod, about the death of
Hyrcanus. He begins the 70th week at Christ’s baptism, and ends the
period three years and a half afterwards. *Tertullian,* by beginning in
the first year of Darius, counts 490 years, to the destruction of
Jerusalem.

<span id="viii.ix-p7"></span>*OEcolampadius* confesses this passage to
be one of the most difficult in Scripture, and can scarcely satisfy
himself with any solution. He rather unwisely introduces chronological
tables of the events of Scripture, from Adam to the time of the Herods.
“With Christ,” he says, “is the fullness of the times and the completion
of the seventy weeks.” He quotes the expressions of Jewish authorities,
and refers to the cruelty of Herod, and the anointing of Jesus as
Messiah. “They are not weeks of days, or of jubilees, or of ages,” he
asserts, but of years. They most probably begin at either the first year
of Cyrus, or the second of Darius. He calculates it both ways: the first
period closing at the death of Antiochus the brother of Alexander, and
the other at the reign of Herod. He afterwards adopts the division of
this period into three parts, and explains his method of reckoning the
seven weeks. The question is discussed with great judgment, and its
perusal will amply repay the attentive student of this remarkable
prophecy.

<span id="viii.ix-p8"></span>*J. D. Michaelis* has elucidated this
subject, in a letter to Sir John Pringle, which the English reader will
find noticed in the Monthly Review, O. S., volume 49, page 263 and
following. *Dr. Blayney,* in a Dissertation, Oxford, 1775, 4to,
contradicts the Professor’s opinions: see Monthly Review, O. S., volume
52, page 487 and following. *John Uri* also published at Oxford, 1788,
an “Interpretation, paraphrase, and computation of this passage.”
*Faber*’*s* well-known Dissertation, London, 1811, only needs to be
mentioned to be valued; while that of *Dr. Stonard,* London, 1826, is
exceedingly elaborate, being a masterly scholastic work. *Dr. Wells* has
prefixed to his “Help to the Understanding of Daniel,” some observations
on the chronology of this prophecy. From him we learn the different
methods of *Scaliger, Mede,* and *Bishop Lloyd,* while his own
paraphrase and his solution of some of the difficulties in the schemes
of preceding writers, are worthy of attentive perusal. *Willet* presents
us with “The several interpretations of Daniel’s seventy weeks
dispersedly handled before, summed together,” in his 55th question on
this chapter, and continues the subject through the ten succeeding
questions. From his comments, we ascertain the views of *J. Lucidus,*
lib. 7, *De emendatione teenporis, Osiander, Junius, Montanus in
apparat., lib. Dan.,* and others. His remarks on Calvin are worthy of
notice here. “*M. Calvin* beginneth these years in the first year of
Cyrus, and endeth them in the sixth of Darius the son of Hystaspes, the
third king of Persia; but this cannot be; for they that give the most
years unto Cyrus and Cambyses, allow but the one 30 and the other seven;
excepting only *Luther,* who following *Eusebius De Demon. Evan.,*
giveth to each of them 20 years. Then add the six years of Darius, they
will make but 43. How, then, can the seven weeks be here fulfilled?
Beside, that Darius, in whose sixth (year), the Temple was re-edified,
called Darius of Persia, was not Darius Hystaspes the third king of
Persia; but before this Darius, three other kings are named Cyrus,
Assuerus, Artashasht, <span id="viii.ix-p8.1"></span>[Ezr.
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.ix-p8.1"></span>.”
This reference to Calvin occurs in his 58th question, — “When the term
of seven weeks, that is 49 years began and when it ended,” page 323,
Edit., 1610. One remark of *Wintle*’*s* is most important, as its
correctness vindicates Calvin from every charge of inconsistency in his
interpretation of these prophecies. “The original word rendered *weeks*
throughout the prophecy, strictly signifies sevens, which word is
adopted in Purver’s translation, and may be referred either to days or
years.” Professor *Jahn* also adopts the same correct and simple
translation, and his satisfactory criticism is found in his *Appendix*
to *Enchir* *Hermen.,* Fasc. 1, page 124 and following. Vienna, 1813.
The subject is also discussed by the present Editor, in his Norristan
Prize Essay for 1834, page 81. *Dathe* also, in his Prophetic Majores,
Edit. 3d., Halae, 1831, translates as follows, “The seventy, yea the
seventy, are drawing to a close.” The only difference in the original is
in the pointing of the Masorets; and thus the chronology which they
introduced, requires all the ingenious apparatus of the profound
astronomy of Sir Isaac Newton to reconcile it with the historical facts.
See his Observations on the Prophecies of Daniel, part 1, chapter. 10.
Archbishop Seeker has dwelt much on this point, and every commentator on
the Prophet has treated it with more or less wisdom and discretion.
*Wintle* is on the whole very judicious. Professor *Lee*’*s* translation
of the passage, and explanation of the Hebrew words, is exceedingly
valuable. His exegetical comments admit of some variety of opinion as to
their value. The seventy weeks, says he, were not “to be considered
chronological in any sense, but only to name an *indefinite* period, the
events of which, as in most similar cases, should make all sufficiently
clear,” Bk. 2, chapter 1, page 160. This chronological period, and the
dependent minor divisions, are ably treated by *Rosenmuller,* who has
devoted more than usual space to their illustration. He quotes some of
the best opinions of the most celebrated German writers, and throws
great light upon the historical points connected with the inquiry. See
his comments on this chapter. 9, pages 313-324.

<span id="viii.ix-p9"></span>*Broughton* has quoted largely from Jewish
Rabbis; he treats Daniel’s prayer as a compendium of theology, and
applies Gabriel’s answer to the baptism, miracles, and life of our Lord.

<span id="viii.ix-p10"></span>Professor *Stuart,* whom we have already
quoted, has treated this subject with great precision by commenting
critically on the Hebrew words. He adopts the rendering *seventy*
sevens, or “*seventy heptades* are determined upon thy people. Heptades
of what? of days or of years? No one can doubt what the answer is.
Daniel had been making diligent search respecting the seventy *years;*
and in such a connection, nothing but seventy heptades of years could be
reasonably supposed to be meant by the angel.” An argument is also drawn
from the double gender of the plural of this word, which is noticed by
*Ewald,* Gram. Heb., section. 373. London, 1836. Many other arguments in
favor of its general sense of “sevens” are added, implying that the
connection only determines whether years or days be intended. Professor
*Bush* brings forward the opposite views to those of *Stuart,* and
discusses the subject with the utmost exactness of Hebrew criticism.
*Mede* should also be consulted, works, Bk. 3, chapter. 9, page 599.
*Hengstenberg* treats the form of the word as rarticipial and indicating
a septenized period, like *hebdomas* in Greek, *septimana* in Latin,
*settimana* in Italian, and *semaine* in French. Views in accordance
with these are found in “The Morning Watch,” volume 5, page 327. London,
1832. This article is the more worthy of perusal, as it presents us, in
an intelligible English form, the criticism of Professor *Jahn,*
extracted from his Appendix ad Enchiridion Hermeneutica, Fasc. 1, page
124 and following. Edit., Vienna, 1813. The English translation of the
passage, in accordance with Jahn’s critical exposition, is worthy of
notice, particularly by those readers who wish to keep before their
minds the most valuable explanations which have ever been published by
British, Continental, and American Divines.

<span id="viii.x-p5"></span> “Hippolytus,” says Mosheim, “whose history
is much involved in darkness, is also esteemed among the most celebrated
authors and martyrs of this age.” (Volume 1, page 270, edit. 1823.)
Although the learned Benedictines have assisted in dispelling this
darkness in their History of the Literature of France, volume 1, page
361, yet the greatest light has been thrown upon the life and opinions
of this writer by the Chevalier *Bunsen* in his work, “Hippolytus and
his Age,” 4 vols., 1852. Dr. *Christopher Wordsworth* has also discussed
the same subject, giving an English version of the newly discovered
*philosophumena,* with an introductory inquiry into the authorship of
the treatise, and on the life and works of the writer. It is out of our
province to enter on the important questions raised by these well-known
writers; we must confine ourselves strictly to whatever illustrates
*Daniel.* He wrote commentaries on various parts of the Old and New
Testaments, and among these Bunsen enumerates one “On the Prophets, in
particular on Ezekiel and Daniel,” volume 1, page 282. A fragment of his
comment on Daniel is preserved in the edition of *Fabricius,* in which
the Greek text is printed from a Vatican MS., tom. 1, page 271, “named
by Theodoret and by Photius, c. 203. Jerome says Hippolytus’ historical
explanation of the seventy weeks did not tally with history and
chronology. Fabricins, 1, page 272. We have a genuine fragment of this
explanation in Fabricins, 1, page 278, on Daniel’s life and times.” The
Syrian MSS. discovered in the Lybian Desert, and explored by Cureton,
contain, says Bunsen, quotations from the Commentary on Daniel by
Hippolytus. Calvin, most probably, knew no more of his view of the
seventy weeks than he found in Jerome. The existence of his treatise on
Antichrist was known to the Reformers chiefly from ancient writers who
had given a list of his works, but especially from Jerome. From
*Fabricius,* *Appendix* ad. I. 1, page 2, we learn that a forgery was
published in 1556., and that the genuine work was first edited in 1661
from two French MSS, A Latin translation was added in 1672. “His
calculations,” says Bunsen, “based upon Daniel and the Apocalypse, are
quite as absurd as those which we have been doomed to see printed, and
praised, and believed in our days. He makes out that. Antichrist will
come 500 years after Christ, from the tribe of Dan, and rebuild the
Jewish temple at Jerusalem.” This remark has caused the censure of a
writer in “*The Record,*” who accuses Bunsen of making’ this bishop and
martyr “the mouthpiece of his own unbelief in the prophecies of Daniel.”
“Some writers have conceived,” says Bunsen, “that Hippolytus alludes, in
his interpretation of the ten horns of the fourth beast in Daniel, to
some great convulsions of the empire in his time; but this opinion seems
to me entirely unfounded. All I can find in these passages indicative of
the time in which they were written, (section. 28, 29,) is the existence
of a very strong, iron, military government; and this seen as to point
to the time when the power of Septimius Severus was firmly established,
after fierce contests and sanguinary battles. The rest relates to things
to come, to the last age of the world, which he thought about three
centuries distant.” (Volume 1, page 274.) On page 290 we have three
lists of the works of this “father,” as noticed by Eusebius, Jerome, and
Lycellus. Eusebius does not mention his work on Daniel; both Jerome and
Lycellus do; and Nicephorus adds it among others to the Eusebian list;
and on page 242 many of his works are recorded as existing among the
Escurial manuscripts. See the Catalogue des Manuscrits Grecs de la
Bibliothbque de l’Escurial, par E. Miller, 8vo, Paris, 1848. Cardinal
Main, in his “Scriptorum Veterum nova Collectio,” volume 1, part 2,
gives such figments of Hippolytus’ Daniel as were formerly inedited,
(pp. 161-222.) On page 205, ver. 13, he illustrates Daniel’s phrase,
“the old of the days,” referring it to God the Father, the Master of
all, even of Christ himself.

<span id="viii.x-p6"></span>The interest excited by the recent
publications of *Bunsen* and *Wordsworth,* makes it desirable to state
that fresh light has been thrown upon his life and times. *Cave,* in his
elaborate work, is unsuccessful respecting Hippolytus. He takes up the
opinion of Le Moyne, a French ecclesiastical writer of the seventeenth
century, who conjectured that he was bishop of *Portus Romanus,* Aden in
Arabia. The additional supposition that he was an Arabian by birth is
also a mistake. He was bishop of the “*portus,*” a harbor of the city of
Rome, during the time of the Emperor Alexander Severus, at the beginning
of the third century. He suffered martyrdom during the persecution of
Maximus the Thracian, about A.D. 236. The Chevalier’s narrative of the
manner in which a lost book of his has been recovered is worthy of
notice. “A French scholar and statesman of high merit, M. Villemain,
sent a Greek to Mount Athos to look out for new treasures in the domain
of Greek literature. The fruits of this mission were deposited, in 1842,
in the great national library, already possessed of so many treasures.
Among them was a MS. of no great antiquity, written in the fourteenth
century, not on parchment, but on cotton paper, and it was registered as
a book ‘on all heresies,’ without any indication of its author or age.
\[...\] It fell to the lot of a distinguished Greek scholar and writer
on literature, a functionary of that great institution, M. Emmanuel
Miller, to bring forward the hidden treasure. In 1850 he offered it to
the University Press at Oxford, as a work of undoubted authenticity, and
as a lost treatise of Origen, ‘Against all Heresies.’” It was published
in 1851, and Bunsen, on reading it, pronounced it not to be the work of
Origen, but of Hippolytus; and in letters to Archdeacon Hare, he has
thrown great light upon the subject, and enabled us to per, use some
fragments of his comments on Daniel and the Antichrist, which Calvin
could only have known through Eusebius and Jerome.

<span id="viii.x-p7"></span>It is worthy of notice that *Sir Isaac
Newton,* in his “Observations on the Prophecies of Daniel,” etc., quotes
Hippolytus thus, — “If divers of the ancients, as Irenaeus, Julius
Africanus, Hippolytus the martyr, and Apollinaris bishop of Laodicea,
applied the half week to the times of Antichrist, why may not we, by the
same liberty of interpretation, apply the seven weeks to the time when
Antichrist shall be destroyed by the brightness of Christ’s coming.”

<span id="viii.x-p8"></span>Nicolaus de Lyra received his name from the
place of his birth, Lire, a small town in Normandy. He flourished at the
beginning of the fourteenth century: he was one of the Society of the
Friars Minors at Verneuil, although he is supposed to have been born a
Jew. his *oostills* were repeatedly printed at the close of the
fifteenth and the early part of the sixteenth centuries, and were
familiar to the biblical students of Calvin’s day. He was a good Hebrew
scholar, and has enriched his comments with the best specimens of
Rabbinical learning. He is a good interpreter of the literal sense; but
his views were attacked by *Paulus Burgensis,* Paul bishop of Burgos,
who was a converted Jew, and defended by Mattathias Doring. His works,
with those of his opponent and champion, were published at *Duaci,* A.D.
1617; also at Antwerp, A.D. 1634, in 6 vols. folio. See also Hart.
Horne, volume 2, part 2, chapter 5. In the Morning Watch, volume 1, page
147, he is considered as a forerunner of the Reformation. Luther is
there said to have written of him thus: “Ego Lyram ideo arno, et inter
optimos pono, quod ubique diligenter refiner et persequitur historian.”

<span id="viii.x-p9"></span>“Burgensis.” A notice of Paul of Burgos is
found in *Allport*’*s* edition of Bishop Davenant on Justification,
volume 2, page 86, *note.*

<span id="viii.x-p10"></span>The Africanus here mentioned was Julius
Africanus of Nicopolis, (Emmaus,) a friend of Origen’s, and rather his
senior in years. He is a very early writer on chronology, about A.D.
232; and his epistle concerning the history of Susannah, together with
Origen’s reply, is in *Wetstein*’*s* edition, annexed to the dialogue
against the Marcionites. Mosheim calls him “a man of the most profound
erudition, but the greatest part of whose learned labors are unhappily
lost.” Cent. 3, part 2; see also Gieseler’s Eccl. Hist., volume 1, page
145, American translation. The treatise to which Calvin probably refers
is the fragment on the genealogy of Christ preserved by Eusebius, Hist.
Eccl., lib. 1, chapter. 7, especially as Eusebius himself had just
quoted this chapter of Daniel (<span id="viii.x-p10.1"></span>[Da
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#024)<span id="viii.x-p10.1"></span>.md)
at the close of his sixth chapter. Other writings of his are quoted by
Eusebius, lib. 6, chapter. 31, entitled “Concerning Africanus.”

<span id="viii.x-p11"></span>Apollinaris<span id="viii.x-p11.1"></span>,
bishop of Hierapolis, flourished in the second century. He is included
by Gieseler among the writers against the Montanists, and is united with
Melito of Sardis by Eusebius, as writers of great repute. See Euseb.
Eccl. Hist., lib. 4, chapter. 26, 27. In the latter chapter he gives a
list of his works. See also lib, 5, chapter. 16, 19. Another of the
fourth century is mentioned by Mosheim as Bishop of Laodicea. An account
of this writer is found in the English edition of Bailey’s Dictionary.

9:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#027.md)<span id="viii.xi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p4"></span>Various questions have arisen respecting
the correct interpretation of this phrase. The prophecy has been
supposed to be accomplished first under Antiochus Epiphanes, and again
by the Roman armies under Titus. *Hengstenberg*’*s* remarks were chiefly
in reply to *Bertholdt, Com.* 2, page 584, and in explanation of our
Savior’s comments, as recorded by St. Matthew. He thinks “it was then
regarded by the Jews as relating to a still future occurrence — the yet
impending conquest and destruction of Jerusalem.”

<span id="viii.xi-p5"></span>“A sufficient proof of this is afforded by
the passage, Josephus Arch. 10:1 l, 7, ‘Daniel predicted also the Roman
supremacy, and that our country should be desolated by them.’” The
passage *De Bell. Jud.* 4:6, 3, is also quoted with this conclusion,
“How general the reference of the prophecy then was to a future
destruction of the city, appears from the express observation of
Josephus, that even the zealots had no doubt of the correctness of this
interpretation. The same interpretation is found also in the Babylonian
and Jerusalem *Gemarah.*” (P. 215.) This reference to “thee zealots” is
explained in a note to *Bishop Kidder*’*s* Demonstration of the Messias,
pt. 2, page 11. They were slain standing on the battlements of the
temple, and their carcasses and blood were scattered and sprinkled about
the sanctuary before its final destruction. This is supposed to be a
fulfillment of the prediction. Professor *Lee* states, “It is to be
understood rather of the Roman armies, with their heathen ensigns,
stationed over against the Temple, than of anything else.” (Book 2,
chapter. 2, page 202.) He translates thus, “For the overspreading of
abominations he shall make it (*i.e.,* Jerusalem) desolate; even until
the consummation (*i.e.,* the complete end) and (until) that determined
shall be poured upon the desolate, rather desolator;” meaning, “the
people of the prince who should come as a desolator and destroy the city
and the sanctuary.” (Book 2, chapter. 1, page 142.) “Let it be
remembered,” says he, “all is here indefinite. No mathematical measure
of time or portion of time is therefore to be thought of. The occurrence
of their several events will supply the only measures of time now to be
had recourse to.”

<span id="viii.xi-p6"></span>The early Reformers, *Oecolampadiu*s,
Bullinger, and Osiander, treated the word “overspreading” in its literal
sense of “wing,” and applied it to the wings or pinnacles of the Temple;
the first of these three takes it for “the very altar and holy place
where the winged cherubim were.” Augustine in his *Epis.* 80, *ad
Hesychium,* interprets it of the legions and wings of the Roman armies
which compassed and defiled the Temple. *Irenoeus,* lib. 5, ad. haer.,
explains it of Antichrist., whom he imagined should sit in the Temple at
Jerusalem, and be worshipped as Messiah. *Rosenmuller* illustrates the
use of the word wing from <span id="viii.xi-p6.1"></span>[Isa
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#008.md)<span id="viii.xi-p6.1"></span>,
and 18:1, and also from Cicero, Offic. lib. 2, chapter 13. C. B.
*Michaelis* objects to the usual sense of the “abomination of
desolation’s,” while *Gesenius* and *Winer* refer the wing to the
pinnacle of the Temple. *Rosenmuller* prefers the active sense of “the
desolater,” according to the marginal reading of our authorized version,
and applies the passage to Antiochus Epiphanes, quoting <span
id="viii.xi-p6.2"></span>[1 Macc.
1:11](../../../bib/apo/ma1001.htm#011.md),
[63](../../../bib/apo/ma1001.htm#063.md)<span id="viii.xi-p6.2"></span>, as
fulfilling the prediction. Dr. *Wells* approves of this translation, but
he interprets the desolater to mean “the Gentile people inhabiting the
(once) countries of the Roman Empire.” (Paraphrase, page 101.)

but their cavils have been ably answered by *Hengstenberg, pages* 54,
55. The error in the Alexandrine translation of this verse is discussed
on page 239. With regard to the fasting of <span
id="viii.xii-p4.3"></span>[Da
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#002.md)<span id="viii.xii-p4.3"></span>,
*Staudlin* assumes that Daniel abstracted himself as far as possible
from sensible objects, in order to obtain very high revelations, and
that the reason why only Daniel saw the appearance lies in the fact,
that only he had been fasting a long season and doing penance, and had
thereby sharpened and sanctified his vision; see *N.* *Beitr., page*
279, ap. *Heng.,* page 120. The celestial appearance of <span
id="viii.xii-p4.4"></span>[Da
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005.md)<span id="viii.xii-p4.4"></span>
and 6 is said to be “identical with the angel of the Lord, and thus also
with Michael. Daniel finds himself on the banks of the Tigris, and sees
hovering over its waters a human form clothed in linen, with a golden
girdle about his loins.” *Hengstenberg* objects to the opinion that this
is a representation of Gabriel. He is so terrified by the voice of the
apparition that he fails into a deep swoon, and for a long time cannot
recover, whereas with Gabriel, on his former single appearance, <span
id="viii.xii-p4.5"></span>[Daniel
11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.xii-p4.5"></span>, he
converses quite fiercely and without restraint. The angel of the Lord is
present in calm silent majesty, and works with an unseen power. The man
clothed in linen cannot be, as *Staudlin* assumes, absolutely identified
with the Most High God, but is as distinct from him as the angel of the
Lord from the Lord himself. For he swears not; by himself, but, with his
right hand lifted up to heaven, by the eternal God. The supposition of a
distinction between the man clothed in linen and Gabriel has the analogy
of <span id="viii.xii-p4.6"></span>[Da
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#016.md)<span id="viii.xii-p4.6"></span>
in its favor. The names Gabriel and Michael are peculiar to Daniel, and
occur only in such visions as from their dramatic character demand the
most exact description possible of the persons concerned and the
bringing of them out into stronger relief. This opinion is discussed
more at length on pages 136-188.

<span id="viii.xii-p5"></span>*Rosenmuller* objects to consider this
vision as either an ecstasy or dream. He quotes Theodoret and Jerome on
the phrase, “desirable food,” and explains the period of the Prophet’s
fasting according to the view of C. B. Michaelis. The attire of <span
id="viii.xii-p5.1"></span>[Da
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#005.md)<span id="viii.xii-p5.1"></span>
is that of the high priest, although it is by no means certain that this
representation portrayed “the prince of the army of Jehovah.” The
likeness to chrysolite is said to be not with respect to color, but
clearness and brilliancy. Bochart and Calmer suppose Uphaz and Ophir to
be the same place; see Wintle’s note, which is full of information. In
illustration of the “voice,” <span id="viii.xii-p5.2"></span>[Da
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.xii-p5.2"></span>,
Rosenmuller quotes Iliad 11:1. 148 and following, and enters fully into
the Jewish theory of various orders of angels, in the first of which
were Michael and Raphael. On this very interesting subject he has
selected with great judgment. the opinions of various ancient
interpreters, especially Theodoret and Jerome, as well as those of
Luther, Geier, Gesenius, and Winer. “The hand that touched him,”
observes Wintle, “was probably one of the attendant angels. The form of
the superior spirit was scarcely visible by Daniel, and therefore it
seems likely to have been one of an inferior order, whose hand he could
discover as reached out unto him. (<span id="viii.xii-p5.3"></span>[Da
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#018.md)<span
id="viii.xii-p5.3"></span>.) The Son of God is seldom introduced to
human notice without a retinue of angels.”

The prince of the kingdom of Persia is supposed by some writers to be
either Cyrus or Cambyses opposing the building of the Temple; and by
others to refer to those guardian angels which the Orientals believed to
protect different countries. *Wintle* adopts Theodotion’s translation of
the last clause of this verse, as the sense then becomes very clear; but
Rosennmuller prefers the Syriac version, “I was delayed there,” in
preference to “I left him there.”

<span id="viii.xiii-p4"></span>The appearance of angels, as recorded in
these prophecies, has always given rise to much inquiry and conjecture.
*Henstenberg* contends for the identity of Michael and the angel of the
Lord, as recognized by the elder Jews, perhaps on the testimony of
tradition. He contends against the assertion of *Bertholdt,* that the
Jews derived their distinction between superior and inferior angels from
the Persians, after the end of the Babylonish captivity, (2, 528.)
*Gesenius* recognizes angel-princes, “as the earthly monarch is
surrounded by his nobles, so here is Jehovah by princes of heaven.”
Traces of a gradation of rank among the angels are also found in <span
id="viii.xiii-p4.2"></span>[Job
33:23](../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#023.md)<span
id="viii.xiii-p4.2"></span>, according to the explanation suggested by
*Winer.* “We go further,” adds *Hengstenberg,* “we can shew that those
angels of higher rank who play a particular part in our book, are the
very same that meet us in just the same character in the oldest books.
We have already pointed out in the *Christoloqie,* that the doctrine of
the angel or revealer of God, runs through the whole of the Old
Testament, who in a twofold respect, first as the highest of all angels,
then as connected with the hidden God by a oneness of essence, appears
as his revealer. He then argues for the identity of Michael with the
angel of Jehovah, the leader of the Israelites, the prince of the army
of Jehovah, according to <span id="viii.xiii-p4.3"></span>[Ex
32:34](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#034.md)<span

In some passages in the Talmud, Michael as the angel of Jehovah is
associated with the Shekinah. See on this interesting point

<span id="viii.xiv-p4"></span> “The speaker in this last vision is the
Son of God himself. There are two things which in my judgment may be
clearly proved; that the princes of Persia and Javan, as also Michael
and Gabriel, are created angels; and that the speaker in this last
vision is the angel of the covenant, the Son of God... The phrase, ‘to
strengthen him,’ is also very significant. The word is *mahoz,* the same
which occurs in the plural *mahuzzim,* at the close of the prophecy.
Here it plainly denotes a tutelary or guardian power, exercised on
behalf of Darius by the Son of God. At the close of the vision it must
bear a similar meaning. The Mahuzzim are those tutelary powers, whether
saints, angels, or demons, who are objects of great horror to the
willful king.” — *Birks,* page 33. Herodotus is still a safe guide in
the interpretation of this prediction. His narrative of Cambyses and
Darius Hystaspes, amply illustrates and confirms it. The canon of
Ptolemy agrees in the same account, only Smerdis is omitted, as usual,
because his reign was less than a year. In the reign of Darius, the
third successor of Cyrus, the rebuilding of the temple was renewed,
under the exhortations of Haggai and Zechariah. “The fourth king,” who
is far richer than all, and stirs up all against the realm of Greece,
plainly answers to Xerxes, the son and successor of Darius. Those three
reigns reach forward through fifty years of the world’s history, A.D.
534-485.

The fourth king was Xerxes. The four last books of Herodotus, and the
eleventh of Diodorus, are entirely occupied with his invasion of Greece.
The Greek play of *A*Eschylus, called the Persae, written within eight
years to celebrate the triumph of the Greeks, is useful in conveying a
vivid impression of this predicted invasion. *Willet* may be consulted,
as he enters very fully into all the historical details, and gives his
authorities in abundance; but his arrangement is very cumbrous; and his
want of critical skill often renders his judgment valueless. He has raw
materials in abundance, but seldom produces it “ready made to hand.” See
Quest. 6, for various opinions on the identity of this fourth king, page
398, Edit. 1610.

Philadelphus, with Antiochus Theus, the grandson of the great Seleucus.
*Birks* has drawn up an elaborate list of *each* king of Syria and
Egypt, from A.D. 323 to 164; and states the following monarchs as
referred to in the corresponding verses of this chapter; viz.,

<span id="viii.xiv-p10"></span>**5.** Ptolemy Soter, and Seleucus
Nicator.

<span id="viii.xiv-p11"></span>**7, 8.** Ptolemy Philadelphus, and

history so plainly, that we may satisfy ourselves by simply referring to

<span id="viii.xv-p4"></span><span id="viii.xv-p4.1"></span>[Da
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md)<span id="viii.xv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xv-p5"></span>The subject here commenced is of the
deepest interest, and needs peculiar caution in its treatment. The words
in which it is conveyed are obscure in themselves, and, consequently,
all the early translations of them are imperfect. Calvin has thrown
great light upon the original phraseology, but still reference may be
profitably made to some modern translators. The sixteenth chapter of the
“Two Later Visions of Daniel,” is occupied with this discussion; various
views are clearly and fairly stated; some conjectures are refuted, and
some conclusions enforced which differ very materially from Calvin’s.
The translation of obscure passages adopted in this work are excellent,
as well as those given by *Elliott* in his notes to pages 1327 and
following, of volume 3 of his Horae Apocalypticae. Professor *Lee*’*s*
translations are exceedingly full and explanatory, while his
hermeneutical views agree more with Calvin’s than either Elliott’s or
Birks’. See his Inquiry into the Nature, Progress, and end of Prophecy,
Book. 2, chapter 2, page 189 and following. *Wintle*’*s* notes are much
to the point. And Bishop Newton traces the analogy between this king and
Antichrist in his Dissertation., volume 3, chapter. 26. The annexed
comments from *Birks, page* 271 and following, will explain some
grammatical difficulties.

<span id="viii.xv-p6"></span><span id="viii.xv-p6.1"></span>[Da
11:37](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#037.md)<span id="viii.xv-p6.1"></span> —
“He shall not regard the elohim of his fathers.” The clause is
ambiguous, as the word “elohim” may receive two opposite constructions.
Bishop Newton and others think it to mean, the one true God; but Mede,
with many able writers, render it correctly, the gods of his fathers,
implying the false deities of the heathens. Arguments are then given in
support of this view, and objections forcibly answered. “Neither shall
he regard the desire of women.” The meaning of this phrase is shortly
discussed. The received view, that it refers to the Messiah, is set
aside, and it is taken the enlarged sense of despising and trampling
upon these humanizing affections of which women are the object. Elliott,
after a good Hebrew criticism, applies it to the Messiah, fortifying his
opinion by *Faber* on the Prophecies, pages 380-385, volume 1, edit. 5;
so *Lee* in his preface, page 126, to Euseb. Theophania — “This
occurring as it does in a context speaking of deities, was probably
intended to designate the Messiah.”

<span id="viii.xv-p7"></span><span id="viii.xv-p7.1"></span>[Da
11:38](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#038.md)<span id="viii.xv-p7.1"></span> —
“But in his estate with Eloah he will honor Mahuzzim.” We now enter upon
the second part of this description, which exhibits the new worship set
up by the Willful King. Here several questions of some difficulty will
arise. I will first offer what appears to me the most natural
translation, and consider afterwards the chief points in dispute one by
one.

<span id="viii.xv-p8"></span>“But in his estate with Eloah, he will
honor Mahuzzim; even with an eloah whom his fathers knew not, he will
honor them with gold, and with silver, and with precious stones, and
with pleasant things. And he will offer to the strongholds of Mahuzzim,
with a foreign eloah whom he will acknowledge; he will increase their
glory, and will cause them to rule over many, and will divide the land
for gain.” The meaning of the word Mahuzzim, fortresses or strongholds,
is next described, and in conclusion, it is decided, that Mahuzzim “must
here denote guardian deities or tutelary persons, who receive worship as
protectors and guardians, defenses and fortresses, from their votaries.”
Professor *Lee*’*s* translation is as follows, “But in his estate he
shall honor the god of forces; and a god whom his fathers knew not shall
he honor with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and with
pleasant things.” “Nero was the first of this series.” “Domitian was the
first emperor who generally persecuted, and who, during his lifetime,
assumed the title of the Lord God, and insisted upon being worshipped as
a deity.” This is the Professor’s interpretation, page 192. The
translations of *Mede,* Bishop *Newton,* and Dr. *Gill,* vary slightly
from each other, but none of them are so correct as that given above.
The original word, translated “offer,” has very wide and various
meanings. In <span id="viii.xv-p8.1"></span>[Ex
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#025.md)<span id="viii.xv-p8.1"></span>,
it is rendered “sacrifice” to the Lord our God, and is very frequently
used in this sense. The words, “a foreign god whom he will acknowledge,”
are probably an explanation of the previous phrase, “a god whom his
fathers knew not;” implying that the worship of this divinity was
borrowed by the Willful King from some other nation, and was unknown to
his fathers.

<span id="viii.xv-p9"></span>“Such, in conclusion,” says Birks, “are the
results which flow from a careful inquiry into the natural meaning of
this passage. The Willful King here described is one which might be
expected to rise after the renewed persecution of the faithful, when
imperial help had been given them, and to continue perhaps for ages,
until the restoration of Israel. His title as *the* king, and the time
appointed him in the words of the angel, prove him to be the same with
the Little Horn, speaking great words against the most High. He will
reject every form of heathen worship, commended to him by the long
practice of his fathers, utter proud speeches of surprising arrogance,
and of real blasphemy against the God of heaven, trample under his feet
the strongest instincts of domestic love, and thus magnify himself
against God and man. He will, however, adopt a foreign eloah derived
from the Jews for his own; but will turn the very worship he pays to the
Son of God into the key-stone to a wide and spreading system of
idolatry, in which he will pay reverence to a multitude of guardian
powers, and cause them to receive homage and worship from his people.”
The comments of this able writer on <span id="viii.xv-p9.1"></span>[Da
11:36-39](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md)<span
id="viii.xv-p9.1"></span> are so contrary to the views of Calvin, that
it is only necessary here to state their variance with those of our
Reformer. Some explanations are worthy of notice, as, for instance, the
following— “These words apply accurately to the local persecutions of
believers under the Arian emperors, and the fierce and savage cruelties
of the Vandals against the confessors of the faith. When, however, the
time of the end, or the predicted three times and a half should begin,
these persecutions would gradually become more systematic and severe. So
that the prophecy at once proceeds to describe the king, who would
prosper in the time of the end, and by whom the fires would be kindled
afresh with more than Pagan cruelty, against the followers of God.”

<span id="viii.xv-p10"></span>*Elliott* in his Horae Apocalypticae,
volume 3, page 1294, has devoted a section to the elucidation of this
chapter. His comments upon the Hebrew words of the original text are
valuable, displaying great judgment, and throwing much light upon the
Prophet’s meaning. His chronological list of the kings of Syria and
Egypt is correct, and very clearly explains the history of this
prophetic period. This prophecy, he states, naturally divides itself
into two parts: first, that from <span id="viii.xv-p10.1"></span>[Da
11:1-31](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#001.md)<span
id="viii.xv-p10.1"></span>, sketching the times of the Persians and
Greeks; secondly, that from <span id="viii.xv-p10.2"></span>[Da
11:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#032.md)<span id="viii.xv-p10.2"></span>
to the end of <span id="viii.xv-p10.3"></span>[Daniel
12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.xv-p10.3"></span>,
sketching the sequel. His comments upon the whole of <span
id="viii.xv-p10.4"></span>[Daniel
11](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.xv-p10.4"></span> to
verse 35, are illustrative of Calvin’s views in these Lectures; but this
writer interprets verse 36 and following, in accordance with the
expositions of Mede and the two Newtons. These are so fundamentally at
variance with Calvin’s writings, that it would be out of place to dwell
upon them here. *Elliott*’*s* notes on the Hebrew words throughout the
latter portion of this chapter are most excellent, and may be trusted as
scholarlike, sound, and judicious.

<span id="viii.xv-p11"></span>Chapter 6 of the “First Elements of Sacred
Prophecy” is occupied by a refutation of Dr. Todd’s theory. The details
of the fulfillment of each verse are plainly and accurately stated, and
the objections of the Fourth Donnellan Lecture are shewn to be futile.
This work is chiefly devoted to the refutation of the Futurist theories,
which are directly opposite to that of Calvin. See particularly pages
135-149.

<span id="viii.xv-p12"></span>*Fry* in his *Second Advent,* chapter. 5,

etc.

<span id="viii.xvi-p4"></span>The<span id="viii.xvi-p4.2"></span>
various occasions on which the sanctuary was polluted by heathen foes
are as follows: —

<span id="viii.xvi-p5"></span>**1.** By Antiochus Epiphanes, when he set
up the image of Jupiter Olympius on the divine altar. The daily
sacrifice was then taken away, and Acra fortified so as to overlook the
Temple.

<span id="viii.xvi-p6"></span>**2.** The Romans polluted it under Pompey
the Great, as recorded by *Josephus, Antiq.,* 14*,* Section 4, 2, 6. It
was transitory and quickly repaired, although this was the first step
towards the complete loss of liberty.

<span id="viii.xvi-p7"></span>**3.** The next profanation occurred under
Crassus, who carried off the gold and the treasures which Pompey had
left. Eleazer the priest, who had the custody of the vail of the Temple,
gave him a beam of solid gold as a ransom for the whole, and yet he
afterwards carried away all the wealth of the sacred edifice. (*Antiq.,*
14, 7, 1.)

<span id="viii.xvi-p8"></span>**4.** When Herod obtained the kingdom,
a.c. 38, the Romans under Sosius took the city by storm; the Jews took
refuge within the Temple, but were unmercifully massacred by their cruel
foes. (*Antiq.,* 14, 16, 3.) So again a slaughter took place in the
Temple by Archelaus on the first passover after Herod’s death, while the
cruelties of Sabinus form a similar instance. (*Wars,* 2:3, 2.)

<span id="viii.xvi-p9"></span>**5.** When Titus pitched his camp on the
Mount of Olives, and the Romans brought their ensigns within the Temple,
and offered sacrifices to them. (*Wars,* 6:6, 1.)

<span id="viii.xvi-p10"></span>**6.** During the reign of Hadrian, after
the revolt of Barchochebas, a temple was built and consecrated to
Jupiter Capitolinus on the very site of the sanctuary.

<span id="viii.xvii-p4"></span>The sober views of our Reformer form a
striking contrast to the speculations of some modern writers. *Birks,*
for instance, considers the spread of the Turkish power as accomplishing
this verse. He quotes *Rycault*’*s* History of the Ottoman Kings, and
considers the conquest of Thessalonica and the subjugation of Greece by
Amurath II., A.D. 1432, as the intended fulfillment. In 1514, Selim the
third Turkish Emperor overthrew the Sultan of Egypt, and obtained
possession of Aleppo. After other victories, he turned aside to visit
Jerusalem.

<span id="viii.xvii-p5"></span>The next verse is also supposed to
predict his conquests; and the facts detailed by *Rycault,* volume 1,
pages 246-248, respecting the conquest of Judea, Arabia, and Egypt, at
the commencement of the sixteenth century of the Christian era., are
asserted to fulfill <span id="viii.xvii-p5.1"></span>[Da
11:41](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#041.md)<span id="viii.xvii-p5.1"></span>
to 43. The last verse of this chapter is also supposed to be
accomplished by the historical events recorded by *Rycault*, volume 1,
pages 249-251. A similar opinion is given by the author of “The
Revelation of St. John Considered,” Append. 1, page 467. *Elltott*’*s*
sentiments are similar to these, but less precise, and not very clearly
expressed. *Mede* and Bishop *Newton* think the closing verses of this
chapter remain yet unfulfilled. Professor *Lee* treats this as
accomplished by Constantine and Licinius; see pages 19.5-197, and gives
as his authority *Hist. Univers.,* volume 15, pages 582-584.

<span id="viii.xvii-p6"></span>Before the reader has arrived at this
“point of observation,” he will probably have decided whether the
Praeterist or the Futurist interpretations of these verses is the more
acceptable to his own mind, and will value these references according to
the conclusions to which he has already arrived.

imperatives are to be resolved into futures, thus — these prophecies
will be closed and sealed till the time of the end, in nearly the same
manner as Zechariah (<span id="viii.xviii-p4.2"></span>[Zec
11:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#015.md)<span
id="viii.xviii-p4.2"></span>) is commanded in a vision to take the
instruments of a foolish shepherd, to intimate that some day ungodly
rulers will ruin the people \[...\] But the external acceptation of the
words is still more strongly opposed by chapter 12:9. There the angel
answers Daniel’s request for more precise disclosures respecting the
prophecy, by saying that he cannot furnish him with them because it is
closed and sealed up till the last time.” The objections here answered
are those of *Bertholdt,* Comm., page 795; *De Wette; Bleek, pages* 186,
207; and *Sack,* Apol., page 285. *Alexander,* W. L., (Edinburgh,) in
his Congregational Lectures, seventh series, 1841, has a short but
explanatory criticism on the meaning of “to seal” and “to shut up;” see
Lecture 7, page 372.

<span id="viii.xix-p2"></span>THE EXPRESSIONS RELATIVE TO TIME

<span id="viii.xix-p3"></span><span id="viii.xix-p3.1"></span>[Da
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#011.md)<span id="viii.xix-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xix-p4"></span>The variety of opinion as to the
expressions of Time in this chapter renders it difficult to illustrate
our author with sufficient brevity. The wisdom of the early reformers is
conspicuous. *OEcolampadius* agrees with Calvin in treating these
periods of days, as implying long and indefinite times —
“multiplicatione dierum longum tempus antichristianae impietatis
agnoseas” — by the multiplication of the days you will perceive the
lengthened period of the anti-christian impiety. *Junius* and *Polanus,*
as quoted by *Willet,* consider the days to be literal ones, and the
accomplishment to have taken place during Maccabean times. He also gives
the views of *Hippolytus* and *Nicolaus de Lyra,* to whom Calvin has
previously referred. *Melancthon* adds together the 1290 and the 1335
days, making seven years and three months, beginning b.c. 145, and
ending b.c. 151, when Nicanor was overcome. *Bullinger* understands them
of the times of Antiochus, and *Osiander* of the duration of Antichrist,
but thinks this prophecy does not properly, “but by way of analogue,
concern the latter times.” The opinions of those modern interpreters who
adopt the principles of *Mede* will be found in the works already
quoted. He reckons the years from the time of Antiochus, b.c. 167, which
brings us down to the 12th century, when the Waldenses and Albigenses
protested against the tyranny of the Papacy; and between the forty-five
years, 1123 and 1168 A.D. a great secession occurred from the dominion
of the Pope, by which he thinks the prophecy to have been fulfilled.
Bishop *Newton,* Dissertation. 26, page 387, writes as follows, — “It
is, I conceive, to these great events, the fall of Antichrist, the
re-establishment of the Jews, and the beginning of the glorious
millennium, that the three different dates in Daniel of the 1260 years,
1290 years, and 1335 years, are to be referred.” Here the word “years”
is used as if it occurred in the scriptural text.

<span id="viii.xix-p5"></span>Professor *Lee* considers that the events
which occurred at the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus fulfilled the
prediction of verse. 1. “The children of thy people,” found written in
the book, are said not to be the Jews at large, but the holy remnant who
embraced Jesus as Messiah, and escaped to carry the tidings of salvation
to the ends of the earth. The many who slept in the dust of the earth
were to awake “in a first resurrection with Christ,” <span
id="viii.xix-p5.1"></span>[Ro
6:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#003.md)<span id="viii.xix-p5.1"></span>,
and “some to shame and everlasting contempt, *i.e.,* awakened to hear
through the preaching of the gospel, the judgments denounced against
unbelief, and to feel this in a general overthrow.” The resurrection is
here interpreted of our regeneration and union with the Savior through
the Spirit, and the precise period of its accomplishment is confined to
the early spread of the gospel among mankind.

<span id="viii.xix-p6"></span>The “time, times, and a half” of <span
id="viii.xix-p6.1"></span>[Da
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.xix-p6.1"></span>,
“must, of necessity, signify the time that should elapse from the fall
of Jerusalem, to the end of Daniel’s seventieth week; for, according to
the prediction enouncing this, the Temple and the City were to fall in
the midst of this week,” page 199. In direct contrast to this extract,
*Elliott*’*s* reference of this chapter to times yet future occurs in
volume 2, page 1343. Assuming the 1260, 1290, and 1335 days to be years,
the former period is said to close at the French Revolution in 1790
A.D., the second at the Greek Revolution in 1820 A.D.; and as they are
“unhesitatingly” pronounced to be all three “measured from one and the
same commencing epoch,” the last date must terminate A.D. 1865. *Frere*
terminates the 1290 days in A.D. 1822, and the 1335 in A.D. 1847. See
his Letter dated September 9, 1848, to the Editor of the Quarterly
Journal of Prophecy, October 1848. *Wintle* refers this verse to the
struggle with anti-christian powers, when Michael should stand up “to
defend the cause of the Jews, and to destroy the enemies of true
religion.” *Note in loc.*

<span id="viii.xix-p7"></span>*The Duke of Manchester* has devoted an
Appendix to the discussion of these expressions. He justly observes; if
they “are to be taken literally, then the important events of the latter
part of this prophecy will be within the compass of a man’s life, and
will relate to the actions of an individual. If, on the other hand, the
1290 and 1335 are years, they will extend far beyond the life of any
individual, and must therefore be applied, not to a person, but to a
system. Thus the whole character of the prophecy will be different.”
“The prophecy of <span id="viii.xix-p7.1"></span>[Daniel
10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.xix-p7.1"></span>-12
is not symbolical, nor even figurative, but is literal. The expression
translated days in <span id="viii.xix-p7.2"></span>[Daniel
8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.xix-p7.2"></span> is
different from the term rendered days in <span
id="viii.xix-p7.3"></span>[Daniel
12](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.xix-p7.3"></span>.
The character of the prophecy, <span id="viii.xix-p7.4"></span>[Daniel
10](../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.xix-p7.4"></span>-12,
is rather what we may call biographical, for it details the actions of
individuals. I see no more warrant for saying the willful king denotes a
system, than for saying the vile person, or the raiser of taxes, or a
dozen other kings, mentioned in the prophecy, denote systems. The genius
of the prophecy, therefore, seems to require that the measure of time
connected with the actions of the willful king, should be suitable to
the reign of an individual king, and not elongated into times suitable
to the continuance of a system from generation to generation. ‘Blessed
is he that waiteth, and cometh to the 1335 days,’ seems to imply that
some individuals would endure for the whole 1335 days.” Thus far the
noble author’s remarks are completely in the spirit of Calvin, but a few
sentences afterwards, he supposes the “abomination of desolation” to
belong to the last days of the world, thus giving countenance to the
Futurist expositions. The curious reader may consult a Review in “The
Morning Watch,” volume 5, page 161, of *Faber*’*s* Second Calendar of
Prophecy, in which many ingenious speculations are brought forward
illustrative of Daniel’s expressions relative to Time. The various
numbers of this work contain a multiplicity of laborious investigations
of this subject, chiefly based upon the year-day theory.

<span id="viii.xx-p2"></span>MODERN DISCOVERY THROWING ITS LIGHT  
ON DANIEL’S PROPHECIES.

<span id="viii.xx-p3"></span><span id="viii.xx-p3.1"></span>[Da
12:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan012.htm#013.md)<span id="viii.xx-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xx-p4"></span>We now conclude these our Dissertations by
a further allusion to the subject which occupied our attention in the
Preface. — the marble commentary on the inspired text presented by the
Nineveh monuments. Three thousand years have passed over the Assyrian
mounds, and at length, while we are closing our volume, the grave is
giving up its dead at the call of the intellect of modern Europe. The
crusted earth, beneath which Nineveh has been so long inhumed, has now
revealed the monumental history of its grandeur, the imperishable
witness of its incomparable renown. We must leave the interesting
narrative of the discovery of these unrivaled treasures, and the
description of these singular sculptures; our attention must be directed
solely to the inscriptions, by the reading of which alone these
monuments become available for our purpose. Had we been unable to read
them, “all the excavations must have been to no purpose, and the
sculptured monuments would have been worthless as the dust from which
they have been torn.” Well may we ask, in the language of an able review
of Layard’s *second series of monuments of Nineveh,* May 16, 1853, “By
what splendid accidents, then, has it happened that illumination has
been thrown into the heaps, and that art, inferred for 3000 years,
becomes, when brought to light, in an instant as familiar to us all as
though it were but the dainty work of yesterday? How comes it that these
arrow-headed, or, as they are, more generally styled, cuneiform
characters, which bear no analogy whatever to modern writing of any
kind, and which have been lost to the world since the Macedonian
conquest, are read by our countrymen with a facility that commands
astonishment, and a correctness that admits of no dispute? The history
is very plain, but certainly as remarkable as it is simple. Fifty years
ago the key that has finally opened the treasure-house was picked up,
unawares, by Professor Grotefend of Gottingen. In the year 1802 this
scholar took it into his head to decipher some inscriptions which were,
and still are to be found on the walls of Persepolis, in Persia. These
inscriptions, written in three different languages, are all in the
cuneiform (or wedge-like) character, and were addressed, as it now
appears, to the three distinct races acknowledging, in the time of
Darius, the Persian sway — viz., to the Persians proper, to the
Scythians, and to the Assyrians. It is worthy of remark that although
the cuneiform character is extinct, the practice of addressing these
races in the language peculiar to each still prevails on the spot. The
modern governor of Bagdad, when he issues his edicts, must, like the
great Persian king, note down his behest’s in three distinct forms of
language, or the Persian, the Turk, and the Arab who submit to his rule
will find it difficult to possess themselves of his wishes. When
Grotefend first saw the three kinds of inscription, he concluded the
first to be Persian, and proceeded to his task with this conviction. He
had not studied the writing long before he discerned that all the words
of all the inscriptions were separated from each other by a wedge,
placed diagonally at the beginning or end of each word. With this slight
knowledge for his guide, he went on a little further. He next observed
that in the Persian inscription one word occurred three or four times
over, with a slight terminal difference. This word he concluded to be a
title. Further investigation and comparison of words induced him to
guess that the inscription recorded a genealogy. The assumption was a
happy one. But to whom did the titles belong? With no clue whatever to
help him, how should he decide? By an examination of all the
authorities, ancient and modern, he satisfied himself at least of the
dynasty that had founded Persepolis, and then he tried all the names of
the dynasty in succession, in the hope that some would fit. He was not
disappointed. The names were Hystaspes, Darius, and Xerxes. Although the
actual pronunciation of these names had to be discovered, yet by the aid
of the Zend (the language of the ancient Persians) and of the Greek, the
true method of spelling was so nearly arrived at that no doubt of the
accuracy of the guess could reasonably be entertained. The achievement
had been worth the pains, for twelve characters of the Persian cuneiform
inscription were now well secured. Twenty-eight characters remained to
be deciphered before the inscriptions could be mastered. Grotefend here
rested.

<span id="viii.xx-p5"></span>“The next step was taken by M. Bournouf, a
scholar intimately acquainted with the Zend language. In 1836 he added
considerably to the Persian cuneiform alphabet by reading twenty-four
names on one of the inscriptions at Persepolis; but a more rapid stride
was made subsequently by Professor Lassen of Bonn, who, between the
years 1836 and 1844, to use the words of Mr. Fergusson, the learned and
ingenious restorer of the palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis, ‘all but
completed the task of alphabetical discovery.’

<span id="viii.xx-p6"></span>“While progress was thus making in Europe,
Colonel Rawlinson, stationed at Kermanshah, in Persia, and ignorant of
what had already been done in the west, was arriving at similar results
by a process of his own. He, too, had begun to read the Persian
cuneiform character on two inscriptions at Hamarian, the ancient
Ecbatana. This was in 1835. In 1837 he had been able to decipher the
most extensive Persian cuneiform inscription in the world. On the high
road from Babylonia to the east stands the celebrated rock of Behistun.
It is almost perpendicular, and rises abruptly to the height of 1700
feet. A portion of the rock, about 300 feet from the plain, and still
very perfect, is sculptured, and contains inscriptions in the three
languages already spoken of. The sculpture represents King Darius and
the vanquished chiefs before him — the inscriptions detail the victories
obtained over the latter by the Persian monarch. This monument, at least
2350 years old, deciphered for the first time by Colonel Rawlinson, gave
to that distinguished Orientalist more than eighty proper names to deal
with. It enabled him to form an alphabet. Between the Colonel and
Professor Lassen no communication whatever had taken place, yet when
their alphabets were compared they were found to differ only in one
single character. The proof of the value of their discoveries was
perfect.

<span id="viii.xx-p7"></span>“Thus far the *Persian* cuneiform
character! To decipher it was to take the first essential step towards
reading the cuneiform inscriptions on the walls at Nineveh. But for the
Persepolis walls, the Behistun rock, and Colonel Rawlinson, it would
have been a physical impossibility to decipher one line of the AssyriaI1
remains. In the Persian text only forty distinct characters had to be
arrived at; and when once they were ascertained, the light afforded by
the Zend, the Greek, and other aids, rendered translation not only
possible, but certain to the patient and laborious student. The Assyrian
alphabet, on the other hand, has no fewer than 150 letters; many of the
characters are ideographs or hieroglyphics, representing a thing by a
non-phonetic sign, and no collateral aids whatever exist to help the
student to their interpretation. The reader will at once apprehend,
however, that the moment the Persian cuneiform character on the Behistun
rock was overcome, it must have been a comparatively easy task for the
conqueror to break the mystery of the Assyrian cuneiform inscription,
which, following the Persian writing on the rock, only repeated the same
short history. Darius, who carved the monument in order to impress his
victories upon his Assyrian subjects, was compelled to place before
their eye the cuneiform character which they alone could comprehend. The
Assyrian characters on the rock are the same as those on the bas-reliefs
in the Assyrian palaces. Rawlinson, who first read the Persian
inscriptions at Behistun, and then by their aid made out the adjacent
Assyrian inscriptions, has handed over to Layard the first-fruits of his
fortunate and splendid discovery, and enabled him for himself to
ascertain and fix the value of the treasures he has so unexpectedly
rescued from annihilation. As yet, as may readily be imagined, the
knowledge of the Assyrian writing is not perfect; but the discovery has
already survived its infancy. All other year or two of scholastic
investigation, another practical visit to the ancient mounds, and the
decipherment will be complete! Fortunate Englishmen! Enviable
day-laborers in the noblest vocation that can engage the immortal
faculties of man! What glory shall surpass that of the enterprising,
painstaking, and heroic men who shall have restored to us, after the
lapse of thousands of years, the history and actual stony presence of
the world-renowned Nineveh, and enabled us to read with our own eyes, as
if it were our mother tongue, the language suspended on the lips of men
for ages, though written to record events in which the prophets of
Almighty God took a living interest!”

<span id="viii.xx-p8"></span>The following narrative of discoveries
which have been made since our Preface was written, will most
appropriately close our attempt to illustrate in every possible way
these valuable Lectures: — “When Mr. Layard returned to the scene of
operations in 1848, he lost no time in proceeding with his excavations.
During his absence a small number of men had been employed at Kouyunjik
by Mr. Rassam, the English vice-consul, who, as the agent of the British
Museum, had carried on the works suspended by Mr. Layard, though rather
with the view of preventing interference on the part of others than of
prosecuting excavations to any great extent. Mr. Rassam’s labors,
limited as they were, had not been fruitless. He had dug his way to new
chambers, and had exposed additional sculptures. The latter were of
great interest, and portrayed more completely than any yet discovered
the history of an Assyrian conquest, from the going out of the monarch
to battle to his triumphal return after a complete victory. The opinion
formerly entertained by Mr. Layard with respect to this palace was now
confirmed. He was convinced that the ruins at Kouyunjik constituted one
great building, built by one and the same king. He was still further
satisfied that Kouyunjik and Khorsabad were contemporary structures, and
that the north-west palace at Nimroud had a much higher antiquity than
either.”

<span id="viii.xx-p9"></span>That portion of the subject which applies
most to our purpose is the result obtained from the inscriptions with
which the sculptures are accompanied. In the language of the review
already quoted — “The king of Assyria himself is represented
superintending the building of the mounds upon which the palace with its
bulls is to be built. This king, as the cuneiform inscription shews, is
Sennacherib; and the sculptures, as Rawlinson and the initiated are
permitted to read, celebrate the building at Nineveh of the great palace
and its adjacent temples — the work of this great king. The inscriptions
on the bulls at Kouyunjik record most minutely the manner in which the
edifice was built, its general plan, and the various materials employed
in decorating the halls, chambers, and roofs. Some of the inscriptions
have a thrilling interest. They indicate that the Jews, taken in
captivity by the Assyrian king, were compelled to assist in the erection
of the palaces of their conquerors, and that wood for the building was
brought from Mount Lebanon, precisely as Solomon had conveyed its cedars
for the choice woodwork of the temple of the Lord. There is an awful
strangeness in thus being brought face to face, as it were, with the
solemn mysteries of the Bible and with our own earliest sacred
recollections.

<span id="viii.xx-p10"></span>“During the month of December (1848) the
treasure-seekers were rewarded with a rare harvest. A facade of the
south-east side of the palace at Kouyunjik, forming apparently the chief
entrance to the building, was discovered. It was 180 feet long, and
presented no fewer than ten colossal bulls, with six human figures of
gigantic proportions. The bulls were more or less injured; some of them
were even shattered to pieces, but fortunately the lower parts of all
remained untouched, and consequently the inscriptions were preserved.
Two of these inscriptions contained the annals of six years of the reign
of Sennacherib, ‘besides numerous particulars connected with the
religion of the Assyrians, their gods, their temples, and the erection
of their palaces.’ There can be no reasonable doubt of the accuracy of
the translation made of these writings, and now given in Mr. Layard’s
volume.  <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) The very differences
and variations that occur when the cuneiform character is submitted to
more than one translator attest to the correctness of the general
interpretation. Colonel Rawlinson has translated into English the
particular inscriptions of which we speak; and Dr. Hincks, an equally
competent scholar, has done the same — both independently of each other;
and there is no material discrepancy in their views. The inscription
informs us that in the first year of his reign Sennacherib defeated
Berodach-Baladan, king of Car-Duniyas, a city and country frequently
mentioned in the Assyrian inscriptions. It is not for the first time
that the reader hears of this king, for he will remember how, When
Hezekiah was sick, ‘*at that time Berodach-Baladan, the son of Baladan,
king of Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah,*’ who
boastfully shewed to the messengers all the treasures of his house. The
Assyrian monument and holy writ thus begin to reflect light upon each
other. But this is only a gleam of the illumination that follows. In the
third year of his reign, according to the inscriptions, Sennacherib
overran with his armies the whole of Syria. ‘Hezekiah,’ so runs the
cuneiform writing, ‘king of Judah, who had not submitted to my
authority, forty-six of his principal cities, and fortresses and
villages depending upon them of which I took no account, I captured, and
carried away their spoil. I shut up himself within Jerusalem, his
capital city.’ The next passage, says Mr. Layard, is somewhat defaced,
but enough remains to shew that he took from Hezekiah the treasure he
had collected in Jerusalem — thirty talents of gold and eight hundred
talents of silver, besides his sons, his daughters, and his slaves. The
reader has not waited for us to remind him that in the 2nd Book of Kings
it is written how ‘*in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did
Sennacherib, king of Assyria, come up against all the fenced cities of
Judah and took them... And the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah,
king of Judah, three hundred talents of silver and* Thirty Talents of
Gold *And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house
of the Lord, and in the treasures of the king*’*s house.*’ It is
something to have won from the earth such testimony on behalf of
inspired Scripture. It is also something to have obtained from holy writ
such evidence in favor of the monumental records of long-buried Nineveh.

<span id="viii.xx-p14"></span>“At a later period a chamber was
discovered in which the sculptures were in better preservation than any
before found at Kouyunjik. The slabs were almost entire, and the
inscription was complete. The bas-reliefs represented the siege and
capture, by the Assyrians, of a city of great extent and importance. ‘In
no other sculptures were so many armed warriors seen drawn up in array
before a besieged city.’ The sculptures occupied thirteen slabs, and
told the whole narrative of the attack, the conquest, and the
destruction of the enemy. The captives, as they appear in the
bas-reliefs, have been stripped of their ornaments and fine raiment, are
barefooted and half-clothed. But it is impossible to mistake the race to
which they belong. They are Jews; for the stamp is on the countenance as
it is impressed upon the features of their descendants at this very
hour. The Assyrian sculptor has noted the characteristic lines and drawn
them with surprising truth. To what city they belong we likewise know,
for, above the figure of the king, who commands in person, it is
declared, that ‘Sennacherib, the mighty king, king of the country of
Assyria, sitting on the throne of judgment before the city of Lachish,
gives permission for its slaughter.’ That it was slaughtered we have
good reason to believe, for is it not written in the Bible that
Sennacherib had quitted Lachish, having vanquished it, before his
generals returned with the tribute extorted from Hezekiah?

<span id="viii.xx-p15"></span>“If evidence were still wanting to prove
the identity of the king who built Kouyunjik with the Sennacherib of the
Old Testament, it would be sufficient to call attention to one other
most remarkable discovery that has been made in these mysterious mounds.
In a passage in the south-west corner of the Kouyunjik palace, Mr.
Layard stumbled upon a large number of pieces of fine clay, bearing the
impressions of seals, which there can be no doubt had been affixed, like
modern official seals of wax, to documents written on leather or
parchment. The writings themselves have, of course, decayed, but,
curiously enough, the holes for the string by which the seal was
fastened are still visible; and in some instances the ashes of the
string itself may be seen, together with the unmistakable marks of the
finger and thumb. Four of these seals are purely Egyptian. Two of them
are impressions of a royal signet. ‘It is,’ says Mr. Layard, ‘one well
known to Egyptian scholars, as that of the second Sabaco, the
*A*Ethiopian of the twenty-fifth dynasty. On the same piece of clay is
impressed an Assyrian seal, with a, device representing a priest
ministering before the king, probably a royal signet.’ We entreat the
reader’s attention to what follows. Sabaco reigned in Egypt at the end
of the seventh century before Christ, the very time at which Sennacherib
ascended the throne. ‘He is probably the So mentioned in the <span
id="viii.xx-p15.1"></span>[2Ki
17:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#004.md)<span id="viii.xx-p15.1"></span>
as having received ambassadors from Hoshea, king of Israel, who, by
entering into a league with the Egyptians, called down the vengeance of
Shalmaneser, whose tributary he was, which led to the first great
captivity of the people of Samaria. Shalmaneser we know to have been an
immediate predecessor of Sennacherib, and Tirhakah, the Egyptian king,
who was defeated by the Assyrians near Lachish, was the immediate
successor of Sabaco II. It would seem, that a peace having been
concluded between the Egyptians and one of the Assyrian monarchs,
probably Sennacherib, the royal signets of the two kings, thus found
together, were attached to the treaty, which was deposited among the
archives of the kingdom.’ The document itself has perished, but the
proof of the alliance between the two kings remains, and is actually
reproduced from the archive-chamber of the old Assyrian king. The
illustration of Scripture-history is complete, and the testimony in
favor of the correct interpretation of the cuneiform character perfect.”

<span id="viii.xx-p16"></span>Long as this extract is, it gives but a
slight specimen of the surprising amount of scriptural illustration
derived from this new and unexpected source. We add a last and final
one: — “Ten years have scarcely elapsed since the first discovery of
ruins on the site of Nineveh was made, and already there lies before us
an amount of information, having regard to the history of the old
Assyrian people, of which we had previously not the most distant
conception. When Mr. Layard published, in 1849, the account of his first
Assyrian researches, the monuments recovered were comparatively scanty,
and the inscriptions impressed upon them could not be deciphered. Now, a
completed history can be traced in the sculptured remains, and the
inscriptions may be followed with the same facility as the Greek or any
other character. That they may be read with immense profit and
instruction is evident from the startling facts which they have hitherto
revealed. Some of these facts we venture briefly to place before the
reader. We have previously hinted that the earliest king of whose reign
we have any detailed account is the builder of the north-west palace at
Nimrod, the most ancient edifice yet beheld in Assyria. His records,
however, furnish the names of five, if not seven, of his predecessors,
some of whom it is believed founded palaces, afterwards erected by their
successors. The son of this king, it is certain, built the center palace
of Nimroud, and raised the obelisk, now in the British Museum, upon
which the principal events of his reign are inscribed. Upon that obelisk
are names corresponding to names that are found in the Old Testament.
The fortunate coincidence furnishes at once the means of fixing specific
dates, and enables Mr. Layard to place the accession of the Assyrian
monarch who built the oldest Nimroud palace at the latter part of the
tenth century before Christ. The builder of the palace of Khorsabad is
proved to have been the Sargon mentioned by Isaiah. The ruins of his
palace supply the most complete details of his reign; and from the reign
of Sargon a complete list has been obtained of all the kings down to the
fall of the empire. The son of Sargon was Sennacherib, who ascended the
throne in the year 703 b.c. We know from the Bible that Sennacherib was
succeeded by his son Esarhaddon, and we now ascertain from the monuments
that one of the palaces at Nimroud was the work of his reign. The son of
Esarhaddon built; the south-east palace on the mound of Nimroud; and,
although no part of his history has been as yet recovered, there is good
reason for concluding him to have been the Sardanapalus who, conquered
(b.c. 606) by the Medes and Babylonians under Cyaxares, made one funeral
pile of his palace, his wealth, and his wives.

<span id="viii.xx-p17"></span>“While it is certain that there is no
mention of Nineveh before the 12th century b.c. Mr. Layard is still of
opinion that the city and empire existed long before that period.
Egyptian remains found at Karnak refer to a country called Assyria, and
the enterprising explorer is not without hope that further investigation
will supply him with still more ancient records than any he now
possesses. The monuments of Nineveh, as far as they go, corroborate all
extant history in describing the monarch as a thorough Eastern despot,
‘unchecked by popular opinion, and having complete power over the lives
and property of his subjects; rather adored as a god than feared as a
man, and yet himself claiming that authority and general obedience in
virtue of his reverence for the national deities and the national
religion.’ The dominion of the king, according to the inscriptions,
extended to the central provinces of Asia Minor and Armenia northward;
to the western provinces of Persia eastward; to the west as far as Lydia
and Syria; and to the south to Babylonia and the northern part of
Arabia. ‘The empire appears to have been at all times a kind of
confederation formed by many tributary States, whose kings were so far
independent that they were only bound to furnish troops to the supreme
lord in time of war, and to pay them yearly a certain tribute.’ The
Jewish tribes, it is now proved, held their dependent position upon the
Assyrian king from a very early period; and it is curious to observe
that, wherever an expedition against the kings of Israel is mentioned in
the Assyrian inscriptions, it is invariably stated to have been
undertaken on the ground that they had not paid their customary tribute.

<span id="viii.xx-p18"></span>“At every step sacred history is
illustrated, illuminated, and explained by the speaking stones of
Nineveh; and in this regard alone the Assyrian discoveries have a
significance beyond any revelation that has been made in modern times.
Even the architecture of the sacred people may be rendered visible to
the eye by comparing it with that of the Assyrian structures; and
certainly not the least instructive result of all Mr. Layard’s labors is
the ingenious analogy drawn by Mr. Fergusson in his ‘*Palaces of Nineveh
and Persepolis Restored,*’ between the temple of Solomon and the palace
of the Assyrian king.”
