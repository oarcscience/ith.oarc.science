<span id="ii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 7

<span id="ii.i"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p1"></span><span id="ii.i-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#001.md)<span id="ii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p2"></span>**1.** In the first year of Belshazzar king of
Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he
wrote the dream, *and* told the sum of the matters.

<span id="ii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Anno primo Beltsazar regis babylonis,
Daniel somnium vidit, eer visiones capitis ejus in lecto ejus. Tunc
somnium exposuit.

<span id="ii.i-p4"></span>**2.** Daniel spake and said, I saw in my
vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon
the great sea.

<span id="ii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Loquutus est Daniel, et exposuit: Vidi
in visione mea per noctem, et ecce quatuor venti coelorum pugnantes,
 <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) in mari magno.

<span id="ii.i-p7"></span> 

<span id="ii.i-p8"></span><span id="ii.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p9"></span>Hear. Daniel begins to offer instruction
peculiar to the Church. For God had formerly appointed him an
interpreter and instructor to, profane kings. But he now appoints him a
teacher to the Church, that he may exercise his office within it, and
instruct the sons of God in the bosom of the Church. We must notice this
first of all, because thus far his predictions extended beyond the
limits of the household of faith, but here Daniel’s duty is restricted
to the Church. He says: This vision *was bestowed upon him in the first
year of King Belshazzar,* before that change happened, which we have
previously seen. First of all, we must try to understand the design of
the Holy Spirit; that is, the end and use for which he opened up to
Daniel the material of this chapter. All the prophets had held out to
the elect people the hope of deliverance, after God had punished them
for their ingratitude and obstinacy. When we read what other prophets
announce concerning their future redemption, we should suppose the
Church to have been promised a happy, quiet, and completely peaceful
state, after the people had returned from captivity. But history
testifies how very differently it turned out. For the faithful must have
grown weary and have fallen away unless they had been admonished of the
various disturbances which were at hand. This, then, is the first reason
why God revealed to his Prophet what we shall soon see; namely, that
three monarchies yet remained, each of which should succeed the former,
and that during them all the faithful should endure permanently and
constantly in reliance on the promises, although they should see the
whole world shaken, and severe and distressing convulsions prevailing
everywhere. For this reason, Daniel’s vision concerning the four empires
is here set forth. Perhaps it will be better to defer the summary of it
till the Prophet begins to treat of each beast separately. But with
regard to the two first verses, we must observe the time of the dream.

<span id="ii.i-p10"></span>Before the Medes and Persians transferred the
Chaldean Empire to themselves, the Prophet was instructed in this
subject, that the Jews might recognize the partial fulfillment of what
God had so often promised themselves and their fathers. For if their
enemies had possessed Babylon without any new prediction, the Jews
perhaps would not have been so attentive to those prophecies which had
been long ago uttered in their favor. Hence God wished to refresh their
memories, and then, when they saw the fall of that empire which all
thought to be impregnable, they would perceive the government of God’s
secret counsels, and the partial, if not the complete fulfillment of
what he had testified by their prophets. He says — *he saw a dream* When
he previously spoke of the dream of King Nebuchadnezzar he mentioned a
vision, but not for the same reason, because the unbelieving when seeing
do not observe. They perceive something indeed, dimly and without
distinctness, while their thoughts immediately fade away. The Prophet’s
method was different; because he not only dreamed, but saw a distinct
vision, and thus could profitably deliver to others what he had
received. The Prophet then expresses something peculiar by this phrase,
for we know how prophets usually attribute such visions to God, when
they perceive the secrets of heaven, not with the eyes of flesh, but by
the illumination and intelligence of the Spirit. He adds — *visions of
his head were on his bed*; thus the dream would have more weight, and
lest we should think any confusion existed in Daniel’s brain. Thus he
expresses how he saw whatever the Lord wished him to know in a dream
with a calm mind. He afterwards adds — *Then he wrote the dream, and
explained the meaning of the words*. By this phrase he teaches us how
his seeing the vision was not for his own sake personally, but for the
common edification of the Church. Those who suppose Daniel to have leapt
suddenly from his bed, lest he should forget the dream, offer a vain and
frivolous comment. Daniel rather wished to bear ‘witness to this vision
as not peculiar to himself, but common to God’s elect people; and hence
not only to be celebrated orally, but to be delivered to posterity for a
perpetual remembrance. We must bear in mind these two points; first,
Daniel wrote this prophecy that the knowledge of it might ever be
celebrated among the faithful; and then, he considered the interests of
posterity, and so left the vision written. Both these points are worthy
of notice to induce us to pay greater attention to the vision, since it
was not delivered for a single individual; but God chose Daniel as his
minister, and as the herald and witness of this oracle. Hence we see how
it concerns us; it was not teaching for any single age, but it extends
to us, and ought to flourish till the end of the world. He repeats the
same thing by adding — *he explained the sense of the words.* For those
who separate these two clauses, seem to stumble on plain ground.  <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) *Daniel* then *spoke* and *said* — This has
no reference to words, but to writing; as if the Prophet had said, I
have discharged my duty; since he knew that what we shall afterwards see
concerning the four monarchies was not divinely entrusted to him for the
sake of suppressing anything made known, but he rather felt himself a
chosen instrument of God, who was thus suggesting to the faithful
material for trust and endurance. *He spoke*, therefore, and
*explained*; that is, when he desired to promulgate this oracle, he bore
witness to there being no difference between himself and God’s Church in
this announcement; but as he had been an elect and ordained teacher, so
he delivered what he had received, through his hands, Hence Daniel not
only commends his own faith, but excites all the pious to anxiety and
attention, lest they should despise what God had pronounced through his
mouth.

<span id="ii.i-p12"></span><span id="ii.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p13"></span>He repeats again, *He saw in his vision
during the night*. Again, I say, Daniel affirms that he brought forward
nothing but what God had authoritatively delivered to him. For we know
that in the Church all human traditions ought to be treated as
worthless, since all men’s wisdom is vanity and lies. As God alone
deserves to be listened to by the faithful, so Daniel here asserts that
he offers nothing of his own by dreaming: in the ordinary way, but, that
the vision is sure, and such as cannot deceive the pious.

<span id="ii.i-p14"></span>He afterwards adds, *Behold! the four winds
of heaven fought in a great sea.* I much prefer this rendering.
Interpreters differ respecting the winds, but the genuine sense appears
to be this; Daniel assumes a simile universally known, for on solid
ground any such turbulent concussion is seldom heard of as at sea, when
any mighty tempest arises. Without doubt, he here proposes the image of
a raging sea to warn the faithful against dreadful commotion at hand,
just as, if the sea were agitated with storms and raging with tempests
on all sides. This is the meaning of the phrase. Hence he names *four
winds*, to show the faithful how the motion which should shatter the
globe should not be single and simple, but that various storms should
arise together on all sides — exactly as it happens. We may’ sometimes
see the earth moved just as if a tempest were, tossing about the sea in
all directions, but the motion will yet be single. But God wished to
show his Prophet not only a simple concussion, but many and different
ones, just as if all the winds were to, meet in one general conflict.
Philosophers, indeed, enumerate more winds than four when they desire to
treat of the number with precision, but it is the common phrase to speak
of four winds blowing from the four quarters or regions of the globe.
The sense, however, is clear and by no means forced — the world being
like a troubled sea, not agitated by a single storm or wind, but by
different. conflicting blast., as if the whole heavens conspired to stir
up commotion’s. This vision at the first glance was very bitter to the
faithful, because they counted the years prescribed to them by Jeremiah;
the seventieth year was now at hand, and God had then promised them an
end of their troubles. Now God announces that they must not indulge in
the hope of rest and joy, but rather prepare themselves for sustaining
the rush of the fiercest winds, as the world would be everywhere
agitated by different storms. They might perhaps suspect God of not
performing his promises, but this ought, to be sufficient for appeasing
their minds and propping them up with the hope of redemption, when they
saw nothing happen either rashly or by chance. Again God came to meet
their temptations lest their courage should fail, by teaching them that
the method of their redemption was not quite so easy as they had
previously conceived from former predictions. God indeed had not changed
his plans, for although a long period had elapsed since he spoke by
Isaiah and the other prophets, yet he wished to prepare the Jews against
delay, lest it should break down the courage which would be required to
meet such great afflictions. But when redemption really approached, then
God explained its method more fully and familiarly, and showed how great
and severe were the remaining struggles. Hence the faithful, instructed
by such prophecies, would contend strenuously and yet proceed constantly
in their course of faith and patience. It now follows, —

<span id="ii.ii"></span>

<span id="ii.ii-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#003.md)<span id="ii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii-p2"></span>**3.** And four great beasts came up from the
sea, diverse one from another.

<span id="ii.ii-p3"></span>**3.** Et quatuor bestiae magnae prodibant e
mari, diversae haec ab illa.  <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md)

<span id="ii.ii-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.ii-p6"></span><span id="ii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii-p7"></span>After Daniel had beheld these great
commotions which were shaking the earth in different parts, another
vision was offered to him. What has already been said concerning the
troubled sea and the conflict of the winds, is extended to the four
monarchies, concerning which we shall now treat. A certain preparation
is intended when God offers to the eyes of his Prophet a turbulent sea
produced by the conflict of the winds. Just as if he should say — after
these troubles others shall spring up; thus men will wait for peace and
tranquillity in vain, for they must suffer under fresh agitation’s. Now,
the kind of trouble is expressed, by the words*, four beasts proceed out
of the sea*. Hence that concussion, those storms, and that confused
disturbance of the whole world through one kingdom succeeding to
another. It can scarcely happen that any kingdom can perish without
involving others in its ruin. A single edifice can scarcely fall without
the crash being heard far and wide, and the earth seeming to gape at its
overthrow. Then, what must happen when the most powerful monarchies so
suddenly perish? Hence in this verse Daniel shows how the world is like
a troubled sea, since violent changes among its empires were then at
hand. The comparison of empires to beasts is easily explained. We know
how God’s glory and power are resplendent in all kingdoms, if they are
rightly conducted after the law of equity. But since we often see the
truth of what was said to Alexander, — The greatest kingdoms are the
greatest robberies, and very few absorb the whole power in a great
empire, and exercise a cruel and excessive tyranny. Here the Prophet
compares empires to great and savage beasts, of which he will afterwards
treat. Now we understand the meaning of the words: and we may learn this
lesson from what usually happens in the empires of the world; in
themselves, as I have said, they are most beautiful reflections of the
divine wisdom, virtue, and justice, although those who obtain supreme
sway very rarely acknowledge themselves divinely created for the
discharge of their office. As, therefore, kings are mostly tyrants, full
of cruelty and barbarity, and forgetful of humanity, the Prophet marks
this vice as springing from themselves and not from the sacred ordinance
of God. Let us proceed, —

<span id="ii.iii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p1"></span><span id="ii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#004.md)<span id="ii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p2"></span>**4.** The first *was* like a lion, and had
eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was
lifted up from the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a
man’s heart was given to it.

<span id="ii.iii-p3"></span>**4.** Prima scut leo  <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) et alae aquilae ei: vidi donec evulsae sunt
alae ejus, et sublata fuit e terra, et super pedes suos quasi homo
stedit, et cor himinus datum ets ei.

<span id="ii.iii-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii-p6"></span><span id="ii.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p7"></span>It is clear that the four monarchies are
here depicted. But it is not agreed upon among all writers which
monarchy is the last, and which the third. With regard to the first, all
agree in understanding’ the vision of the Chaldean Empire, which was
joined with the Assyrian, as we saw before. For Nineveh was absorbed by
the Chaldeans and Babylonians; but the Prophet discourses at length of
the Assyrian and Chaldean Empire, which was then flourishing. No one,
however, would have thought it so near its end; and on the very night on
which Belshazzar was slain, we saw how securely and proudly he was
immersed in his pleasures, and what great and listless security existed
throughout the city. This monarchy then ought to be set before us in the
first place. As in the second chapter that empire was called the golden
head of the statue, so also it is now called a lion; that is, it is
compared to a generous animal. It is comprehended under the image of a
beast, and its fierceness and atrocity, as I have said, is hereby
denoted; but with respect to the other kingdom, some superiority is
granted to it, since the world is always growing worse and worse. And
although Cyrus was a very prudent prince, yet he did not reach the
temperance of former ages; for his ambition, avarice, and cruelty were
insatiable. For Isaiah also, when he speaks of the Persians, says, They
desire neither silver nor gold, but thirst after human blood. (<span
id="ii.iii-p7.1"></span>[Isa
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017)<span id="ii.iii-p7.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.iii-p8"></span>We perceive then the reason why the Prophet
says*, The first beast offered to me was like a lion,* because greater
integrity flourished under the Chaldeans than when all the empires were
mixed together, and the Persians subdued both the Chaldeans and the
Medes. For it is evident from all histories that they were a barbarous
and fierce nation. They were indeed showy in their praise of virtue,
since they spent their lives in austerity, and despised all luxuries,
and were exceedingly temperate in their living; but their ferocity and
brutal cruelty rendered them detestable. *The first beast* then *was
like a lion*, says he, *and had eagle*’*s wings*; that is, although it
was a lion, yet it had wings. This refers to its swiftness, since we
know in how short a time the Assyrians increased their monarchy, for
they had previously subdued the Chaldeans, just like a lion for
swiftness. For a lion has force, spirit, and cruelty for committing
injuries. Besides, the prophet saw a winged lion, since they not only
increased their empire by their own strength, but suddenly extended
their wings in every direction. We see, then, how strength and power are
denoted on the one hand, and the greatest speed on the other. He
afterwards adds, *Their wings were dragged or torn off.* For when the
Chaldeans desired to stretch beyond their bounds, the Lord restrained
them within due limits, and checked their continual victories. Their
wings were then torn off, when God restrained them by the check of a
bridle, lest they should wander as freely as they had formerly done.

<span id="ii.iii-p9"></span>The Prophet then adds, *This beast was
raised from the earth*, implying the cessation of the empire. For
neither the Chaldeans nor the Assyrians were entirely destroyed; but
their glory was completely taken away. The face of the beast no longer
appeared, when God transferred that monarchy to the Medes and Persians.
Hence the Prophet adds, *It stood upon its feet, and the heart of a man
was given to it* By this form of expression, he means to imply the
reduction of the Assyrians and Chaldeans to their ordinary condition,
and that they were no longer like a lion, but like private men deprived
of their power and strength. Hence the expression, *a man’s heart was
given to them,* is not intended by way of praise, but by “a man” he
intends any private person; as if he had said, the aspect of the
Chaldeans and Assyrians was no longer terrible, since, while their sway
prevailed, all men dreaded their power. Hence God removed from the world
the face of that beast, and substituted that of a man, and made them
*stand upon their feet*. Formerly they flew about. in the air, and
despised the earth as far beneath their feet, but God makes them stand
upon their feet; that is, not conduct themselves after their customary
and former manner, but simply on the common level, after God had
deprived them of their empire. This, in my judgment, is the simple
meaning of the Prophet. Should there be any necessity, we shall
afterwards confirm the remarks which we now run through but cursorily.
It follows: —

<span id="ii.iv"></span>

<span id="ii.iv-p1"></span><span id="ii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#005.md)<span id="ii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv-p2"></span>**5.** And behold another beast, a second,
like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and *it had* three
ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto
it, Arise, devour much flesh.

<span id="ii.iv-p3"></span>**5.** Et ecce bellua, bestia, posterior
altera  <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4) similis urso (*inquit*.md) et
surrexit ad latus unum: et tres costae in ore ejus inter dentes ejus: et
sic dicebant ei,  <span id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) Surge, comede carnem
multam.

<span id="ii.iv-p6"></span> 

<span id="ii.iv-p7"></span><span id="ii.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iv-p8"></span>Here the Prophet. proclaims how he was
instructed by a dream concerning the second beast. If we will only judge
by the event, this beast doubtless represented the kingdom of the Medes
and Persians, although the Prophet specifies the Persians, as the Medes
had long ago submitted to their yoke. *Behold*, says he, *another beast
like a bear*. We know a bear to be a mean and foul animal, slothful and
inert, as well as cruel. In comparing the bear with the lion, its
appearance is foul and displeasing, while the lion is remarkable for
beauty, although it is formidable. He compares the Persians to a bear,
on account of their barbarity, since we have already pronounced that
nation fierce and savage. Then, again, the Persians were not civilized
like the Assyrians and Chaldeans, who dwelt in the most beautiful region
in the whole world, and in a most lovely country like a most noble
theater; but the Persians lay hid like wild beasts in their caves. They
dwelt among their mountains, and lived like the brutes. Hence the
Prophet compares them very appositely to a bear; nay, God showed this
form to his Prophet. He afterwards adds, *It stood on one side* Some
think this to have been added to express the more contracted dominion of
the Medes and Persians, but this opinion is unsuitable. We know how
extensive was the sway of the Medes before they came under the power of
Cyrus and the Persians. By themselves the Medes were most powerful; then
the Persians were added, and afterwards Cyrus seized upon the
possessions of the Chaldean monarchy. He possessed even the keys of
Egypt, reigned in Syria, held Judea, and extended beyond the sea, till
at length he was conquered by the Scythians. When, therefore, it is
said, *he stood on one side*, the obscure origin of his kingdom is
intended, for the fame of the Persians was included within their
mountains until Cyrus acquired for them a name by his exploits. For he
was a brave warrior, and deservedly eclipsed the glory of all others.
Hence, at first *this beast stood on one side;* that is, the Persians
were without fame or reputation; they had no wealth, and never emerged
from their lurking-places. We see how this particular is restricted to
their origin in consequence of its obscurity.

<span id="ii.iv-p9"></span>The Prophet then adds: *Three ribs were in
the beast’s mouth between its teeth; and it was thus proclaimed, Arise,
eat much flesh!* Those who understand three definite kingdoms by the
three ribs, seem to refine far too minutely. I think the number
indefinite, because this beast had bitten by its mouth not one rib but
more; because the Persians, as we have said, drew to themselves the
power of the Medes, and afterwards subdued the Assyrians and Chaldeans,
and Cyrus also subdued many nations, until all Asia Minor acknowledged
his authority. When, therefore, the Prophet speaks of three ribs, it
implies the insatiable nature of this beast, since it was not content
with a single body, but devoured many men together. For, by “many ribs,”
he meant much prey. This is the whole sense. I do not hesitate to
explain the following words, *it was said to the beast*, of angels, or
of God himself. Some prefer to understand this of the stimulus by which
Cyrus was instigated to cruelty. But since God exhibits to his Prophet
the image of his Providence, what I have lately suggested becomes very
probable: namely, *it was said to the beast, Arise, eat much flesh;*
not; because God was the author of cruelty, but since He governs by His
secret counsel the events which men carry on without method, His
authority is here deservedly placed be/ore our eyes; for Cyrus would not
have penetrated so swiftly into different regions, and have drawn to
himself so many empires, and subjugated so many powerful nations, had
not God wished to punish the world, and had made Cyrus the instrument of
slaughter. As therefore Cyrus executed God’s vengeance by shedding so
much human blood, the Prophet declares it to have been said to him,
*Arise, and eat flesh.* In one respect God was not pleased by the
slaughter of so many nations by Cyrus, and by the increase of one man’s
power and tyranny through so much human bloodshed; but in another
respect God is said to have commanded the conduct of Cyrus, since he
wished to punish the world for its ingratitude, to which the most
desperate obstinacy and rebellion were added. There was no remedy for
these vices; hence God entrusted Cyrus with the duty of executing His
judgment,. I am compelled to stop here.

<span id="ii.v"></span>

<span id="ii.v-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="ii.v-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since thou exposest us to
various distresses in this world, for the purpose of exercising our
faith and patience: Grant, I say, that we may remain tranquil in our
station, through reliance on thy promises. When storms gather around us
on all sides, may we never fall away and never despond in our courage,
but persevere in our calling. Whatever may happen, may we recognize thee
as carrying on the government of the world, not only to punish the
ingratitude of the reprobate, but to retain thine own people in thy
faith and protection, and preserve them to the end. May we bear
patiently whatever changes may happen to us and may we never be
disturbed or distressed in our minds, till at length we are gathered
into that happy rest, where we shall be free from all warfare and all
contests, and enjoy that eternal blessness which thou hast prepared for
us in thine only begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="ii.vi-p1"></span>Lecture Thirty Third.

<span id="ii.vii"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p1"></span><span id="ii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#006.md)<span id="ii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p2"></span>**6.** After this I beheld, and lo another,
like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the
beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.

<span id="ii.vii-p3"></span>**6.** Post hoc vidi,  <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) et ecce alia, bestia scilicet, sicut pardus,
similis pardo, et alae quatuor avis super dorsum ejus, et quatuor capita
bestiae et potestas data est ai.

<span id="ii.vii-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.vii-p6"></span><span id="ii.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p7"></span>Daniel has already spoken of two empires,
namely, the Chaldean and Persian. Interpreters agree in the necessity
for referring this vision to the Macedonian Empire. He compares this
kingdom to a leopard, or, as some translate, a panther, since Alexander
obtained his great power through swiftness alone; and although it is not
by any means a striking animal, yet it managed by its remarkable speed
to subdue the whole east Others bring forward many points of likeness,
in which the Grecian character is in accordance with the nature of the
leopard. But I fear these *minutiae* have but little weight: it is
sufficient for me that the Spirit treats here of the Third empire. It
was not of any importance at first, and could neither terrify distant
regions, nor acquire subjects by its own worthiness. It then became like
some swift animal, if I may say so, since the swiftness of Alexander is
notorious; but he did not excel in either prudence, or gravity, or
judgment, or in any other virtues. Mere rashness seized upon him; and
even if he had never tasted wine, his ambition would have intoxicated
him. Hence Alexander’s whole life was drunken; there was neither
moderation nor composure in him. We see, then, how suitably this answers
to the character of Alexander, although this is also extended to his
successors, all of whom partook largely of the nature of their prince.
Daniel says, therefore, *A beast appeared to him like a leopard*

<span id="ii.vii-p8"></span>He also says, *It had four wings on its
back, and four heads* Some persons, as I think perversely, distinguish
between the wings and the heads. They suppose the kingdom to be depicted
as winged because Alexander seized upon manly kingdoms in a short
period; but the more simple sense is, this beast had four wings and four
heads, because Alexander had scarcely completed his victories when he
died, contrary to all expectation; and after his death, every one seized
a portion of the prey for himself. This, however, is certain: after the
chief generals of his army had contended for many years, all histories
agree in stating that the supreme power centered in four. For Seleucus
obtained Asia Major, and Antigonus Asia Minor, Cassander was king of
Macedon, and was succeeded by Antipater, while Ptolemy the son of Lagus
became the ruler of Egypt They had agreed indeed otherwise among
themselves; for Alexander had a son by Roxana, first daughter of Darius;
he had a brother, Aridaeus, who grew up to manhood, but was epileptic
and of weak intellect. Then, since the generals of Alexander were
cunning, they acted on this pretext, that all should swear allegiance to
their young ward, and then to Aridaeus, in case their ward should die
before he was of age.  <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) Then Lysimachus
was set over the treasury, and another commanded the forces, and others
obtained various provinces. Fifteen or twenty leaders divided among
themselves both offices and power, while no one dared to assume the name
of king. For Alexander’s son was the lawful king, and his successor was
that Aridaeus of whom I have spoken. But they soon afterwards united;
and that was an admirable specimen of God’s Providence, which alone is
sufficient to prove that passage of Scripture He who sheds man’s blood,
by man shall his blood be shed. (<span id="ii.vii-p9.4"></span>[Ge
9:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#006)<span id="ii.vii-p9.4"></span>..md)
For none of Alexander’s generals escaped in safety except those four
whom we have mentioned. His mother, at the age of eighty, suffered a
violent death; his wife, Roxana, was strangled; his son perished
miserably; Aridaeus, his brother, a man of no intellect, and almost on a
level with the brutes, was slain with the rest — in truth, the whole
family of Alexander suffered violent deaths. With respect to the
generals, they perished in battles, some of them being betrayed by their
soldiers, and others the victims of their own negligence; and yet,
although they expected a sanguinary end, they did not escape it. But
four only survived, and so the whole empire of Alexander was divided
into four parts. For Seleucus, whose successor was Antiochus, obtained
Upper Asia, that is, four eastern empire; Antigonus, Asia Minor, with a
part of Cilicia, and Phrygia, and other neighboring regions; Ptolemy
seized upon Egypt and a part of Africa; Cassander and then Antipater
were kings of Macedon. By *four wings* and *four heads*, Daniel means
that partition which was made immediately after the death of Alexander.
Now, therefore, we understand what God showed to his Prophet under this
vision, when he set before him the image of a leopard with four wings
and heads.

<span id="ii.vii-p10"></span>He says, *Power was given to the beast*,
because the success of Alexander the Great was incredible. For who would
have thought, ‘when he was crossing the sea, that he would have
conquered all Asia and the East? he led with him 50,000 men, and did not
undertake the war on his own responsibility alone, but by various arts,
he procured the nomination to the leadership of Greece from the Free
States. Alexander was therefore, a kind of mercenary of the Greeks, and
was unable to lead with him more than 30,000 men, as we have said he
engaged in battle with 150,000, then with 400,000, and then with almost
a myriad. For Darius in his last battle had collected above 800,000 men
besides camp-followers, so that there were almost a million with him.
Alexander had already drawn to himself some auxiliaries from the foreign
nations whom he had conquered; but he could not trust them: hence his
whole strength lay in these 30,000, and on the day on which he conquered
Darius, he was so overcome by sleep that he could scarcely be aroused.
The historians who extol his prudence, excuse this by recording his
sleeplessness during the preceding night; besides, all agree in stating
him to have been apparently dead, and when all his generals approached
they could scarcely wake him up, and then they purposely raised a shout
around his tent, though no one dared to enter. Alexander had scarcely
wiped his eyes, when Darius fled; hence the Prophet’s statement is true
— a beast’s power was given to him, since this happened beyond every
natural expectation and every human opinion, as by his aspect although
he could frighten all Greece, and lay prostrate so large an army. He
states this of the Third Empire. I will not repeat here all that can be
said and can be gathered from history; for many things must be put off
till the eleventh chapter. I will therefore briefly compress whatever
points seem necessary for the interpretation of the passage. It now
follows, —

<span id="ii.viii"></span>

<span id="ii.viii-p1"></span><span id="ii.viii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#007.md)<span id="ii.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.viii-p2"></span>**7.** After this I saw in the night
visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong
exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in
pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it *was*
diverse from all the beasts that *were* before it; and it had ten horns.

<span id="ii.viii-p3"></span>**7.** Postea, post hoc, vidi, hoc est,

et cornua decem illi.

<span id="ii.viii-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.viii-p6"></span><span id="ii.viii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.viii-p7"></span>There is greater difficulty in this Fourth
Monarchy. Those who are endued with moderate judgment, confess this
vision to be fulfilled in the Roman Empire; but they afterwards
disagree, since what is here said of the fourth beast many transfer to
the Pope, when it is added a Little Horn sprang up; but. others think
the Turkish kingdom is comprehended under the Roman. The Jews for the
most part incline this way, and they are necessarily compelled to do so,
since Daniel will afterwards add — I saw the throne of the Son of Man;
since it is clear, from this prediction, that Christ’s kingdom was
erected by the overthrow of the Roman dominion, the Jews turn round,
and, as I have said, join the Turkish monarchy with the Roman, since
they do, not find their Christ according to their imagination. And there
are some of our writers who think this image ought not to be restricted
to the Roman Empire, but ought to include the Turkish. In nay view,
there is nothing probable in that opinion; I have no doubt that in this
vision the Prophet was shown the figure of the Roman Empire, and this
will be more apparent as we go on.

<span id="ii.viii-p8"></span>He says a *fourth beast appeared*. He gives
it no fixed name, because nothing ever existed like it in the world. The
Prophet, by adding no similitude, signifies how horrible the monster
was, for he formerly compared the Chaldean Empire to a lion, the Persian
to a bear, and the Macedonian to a leopard. In these comparisons there
was something natural; but when he descends to the fourth beast, he
says, it was *formidable in its aspect, and terrible, and very brave* or
strong, and without; any addition calls it “a beast.” We see then his
wish to express something prodigious by this fourth beast, as there is
no animal so fierce or cruel in the world which can in any way represent
with sufficient strength the nature of this beast. *Behold*, therefore,
*the fourth beast which was formidable, and fearful, and very strong.*
We know of no such Monarchy before this. Although Alexander subdued the
whole of the East, his victory, we are sure, was not stable. He was
content with fame alone; he, granted liberty to all people; and as long
as they flattered him, he sought nothing else. But we know the Romans.
to have been masters even as far as Babylon:; we know the following
countries to have been subdued by them: Asia Minor, Syria, Cilicia,
Greece, and Macedon, both the Spains, Gaul, Illyricum, and part of
Germany. At length Britain was subjugated by Julius Caesar. No wonder
this beast is called formidable and very strong! For before Julius
Caesar became master of the Empire, the whole Mediterranean Sea was in
all its parts under subjection to the Roman Empire. Its amazing extent
is well known. Egypt had indeed its own kings, but they were tributary;
whatever edicts the Romans decreed, they were executed immediately in
Egypt. Mirror sovereigns existed in Asia Minor as a kind of spies, but
this state of things we shall treat presently. It is also well known
that they possessed supreme power throughout the Mediterranean Sea, and
that by the conquest of Mithridates. Pompey reduced Pontus under his
dominion. In the East affairs were all at peace. The Medes and Persians
gave them some trouble, but they never moved unless they were provoked.
The Spains were not yet accustomed to the yoke, but we know that there
were always two praetors there. Julius Caesar was the first who entered
Britain after subduing Gaul. Hence we see how far and wide the Romans
extended their power, and with what immense cruelty. Hence Daniel calls
this beast, *formidable and very strong*

<span id="ii.viii-p9"></span>He afterwards adds, *It had large iron
teeth.* This ought to be referred to its audacity and insatiable
greediness. We see how completely free their nation was from the fear of
death, for they were so hardened that if any one deserted his rank for
the sake of avoiding danger, he was afterwards branded with such marks
of infamy, that he was compelled either to strangle himself or to incur
a voluntary death! There was, then, a certain brutal cruelty in that
nation, and we also know how insatiable they were. For this reason
Daniel says *they had large iron teeth*. He adds, *it consumed, and
broke to pieces, and trod the remnant under foot*. These things are
spoken allegorically, not only because this vision was offered to the
holy Prophet, but also because God wished to paint a kind of living
image, in which he might show the peculiar characters of each
government. For we know how many lands the Romans had consumed, and how
they transferred to themselves the luxuries of the whole world, and
whatever was valuable and precious in Asia Minor, and Greece, and
Macedonia, as well as in all islands and in Asia Major — all was swept
away — and even this was insufficient to satisfy them! This, then, is
the ravenousness of which the Prophet now speaks*, since they consumed,
says he, and rubbed to pieces with their teeth*. He adds, *they trod the
remnant under their feet* — a metaphor worthy of notice, as we know they
were accustomed to distribute the prey which they could not carry with
them. They devoured and tore with their teeth the treasures and costly
furniture and everything else; for their supplies were provided by
tributes which produced large sums of money. If there was any portion of
the Mediterranean which they could not defend without keeping a
permanent garrison there, we know how they engaged the services of
tributary kings. Thus the kingdom of Eumenes increased to a great extent
till the time of his grandson Attalus, but they bestowed it partly on
the Rhodians, and partly on the Cyprians and others. They never
remunerated those Allies who almost exhausted their own possessions in
aiding them, out of their own resources, but enriched them with the
spoils of others; and they not only seized upon the property of one city
and bestowed it on another, but they set up their lands for sale. Thus,
the liberty of the Lacedaemonians was betrayed to the tyrant Nabis. They
also enriched Masinissa with so much wealth, that they acquired Africa
for themselves by his means. In fine, they so sported with kingdoms in
seizing and giving them away, that they rendered provinces tranquil by
the wealth and at the expense of others. This was remarkably conspicuous
in the case of Judea, where they created out of nothing Ethnarchs and
Tetrarchs and kings, who were nothing but their satellites — and that
too but for a moment. For as soon as any change occurred, they retracted
what they had given as easily as they bestowed it. Hence, this their
cunning liberality is called treading under foot; for that remnant which
they could not devour and consume with their teeth *they trod under
foot,* as they kept all those whom they had either enriched or increased
subject to themselves. Thus we see with what servility they were
flattered by those who had obtained anything through their generosity.
And how degrading was the slavery of Greece from the time the Romans
entered the country! for as each state acquired any new territory, it
erected a temple to the Romans. They also sent their ambassadors there
to act as spies, who, under the pretense of punishing the neighboring
people for ‘plotting against them, enriched themselves by plunder. Thus
the Romans held under their feet whatever they had given. to others. We
see then how suitably and properly the Prophet speaks, when he says, the
Romans trod down the remnant; for whatever they could not consume, and
what their voraciousness could not devour, *they trod under their feet.*

<span id="ii.viii-p10"></span>He adds afterwards, *And this beast
different from all the former ones, and had ten horns.* When he says,
*this beast was different from the rest,* he confirms what we formerly
said, namely, this was a horrible prodigy, and nothing could be compared
to it in the nature of things. And surely if any one attentively and
prudently considers the origin of the Romans, he would be astonished at
their remarkable progress to such great power; for it was an unusual
monster, and nothing like it had ever appeared. Interpreters treat in
various ways what the Prophet subjoins respecting *the ten horns*. I
follow simple and genuine opinion, namely, the Prophet means this Empire
to belong to more persons them one For the angel will afterwards assert
the ten horns to be kings; not that so many kings ruled at Rome,
according to the foolish dream of the Jews, who are ignorant of all
things; but the Prophet here distinguishes the Fourth Monarchy from the
rest, as if he had said it should be a popular government, not presided
over by one king, but divided into really heads. For they even divided
provinces among themselves, and made treaties with each other, so that
one was governor of Macedonia, another of Cilicia, and another of Syria.
Thus we see how numerous the kingdoms were. And with regard to the
number ten, we know this to be a frequent and usual form of speech in
Scripture, where ten signifies many. When plurality is denoted, the
number ten is used. Thus when the Prophet states the fourth beast to
have ten horns, he means, there were many provinces so divided, that
each ruler, whether proconsul or praetor, was like a king. For the
supreme power was given to them, while the city and Italy were given up
to the consuls. The consul could indeed write to the provinces and
command whatever he pleased; then he could elevate to honor whom he
pleased for the sake of favor and friendship; but each of the praetors
and proconsuls when he obtained a province, became a kind of king, since
he exercised the supreme power of life and death over all his subjects.
We need not be too anxious about the number, as we have already
explained it. Those who reckon the Roman provinces make great mistakes;
they omit the principal one; they make only one of Spain, and. yet we
know there were two. They do not divide Gaul, yet there were always two
proconsuls there, except under Julius Caesar, who obtained the control
of both Gauls. So also they speak of Greece, and yet, neither a
proconsul nor s praetor was ever sent into Greece. Finally, the prophet
simply means that the Roman Empire was complex, being divided into many
provinces, and these provinces were governed by leaders of great weight
at Rome, whose authority and rank were superior to others. Proconsuls
and proctors obtained the provinces by lot, but favor frequently
prevailed, as the histories of those times sufficiently assure us. Let
us proceed, —

<span id="ii.ix"></span>

<span id="ii.ix-p1"></span><span id="ii.ix-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#008.md)<span id="ii.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ix-p2"></span>**8.** I considered the horns, and, behold,
there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were
three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this
horn *were* eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great
things.

<span id="ii.ix-p3"></span>**8.** Intelligebam  <span

loquens grandia.

<span id="ii.ix-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.ix-p6"></span><span id="ii.ix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ix-p7"></span>Daniel proceeds with his description of the
fourth beast. First, he says, *he was attentive*, with the intention of
rousing us to serious meditation. For what is said of the fourth beast,
was remarkably memorable and worthy of notice. This, then, is the reason
why God struck the heart of his servant with wonder. For the Prophet
would not have given his attention to the consideration of the fourth
beast, unless he had been impelled to it by the secret instinct of God.
The Prophet’s attention, then, sprang from a heavenly impulse. Wherefore
it is our duty not to read carelessly what is here written, but to weigh
seriously and with the greatest diligence what the Spirit intends by
this vision*. I was attentive*, therefore, says he*, to the horns, and
behold one small one arose among them*. Here interpreters begin to vary;
some twist this to mean the Pope, and others the Turk; but neither
opinion seems to me probable; they are both wrong, since they think the
whole course of Christ’s kingdom is here described, while God wished
only to declare to his Prophet what should happen up to the first advent
of Christ. This, then, is the error of all those who wish to embrace
under this vision the perpetual state of the Church up to the end of the
world. But the Holy Spirit’s intention was completely different. We
explained at the beginning why this vision appeared to the Prophet —
because the minds of the pious would constantly fail them in the
dreadful convulsions which were at hand, when they saw the supreme
dominion pass over to the Persians. And then the Macedonians broke in
upon them, and acquired authority throughout; the whole of the East, and
afterwards those robbers who made war under Alexander suddenly became
kings, partly by cruelty and partly by fraud and perfidy, which created
more strife than outward hostility. And when the faithful saw all those
monarchies perish, and the Roman Empire spring up like a new prodigy,
they would lose their courage in such confused and turbulent changes.
Thus this vision was presented to the Prophet, that all the children of
God might understand what severe trials awaited them before the advent
of Christ. Daniel, then, does not proceed beyond the promised
redemption, and does not embrace, as I have said, the whole kingdom, of
Christ, but is content to bring the faithful to that exhibition of grace
which they hoped and longed for.

<span id="ii.ix-p8"></span>It is sufficiently clear, therefore, that
this exhibition ought to be referred to the first advent of Christ. I
have no doubt that *the little horn* relates to Julius Caesar and the
other Caesars who succeeded him, namely, Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula,
Claudius, Nero, and others. Although, as we said before, the counsel of
the Holy Spirit must be attended to, which leads the faithful forwards
to the beginning of the reign of Christ, that is, to the preaching of
the Gospel, which was commenced under Claudius, Nero, and their
successors. He calls it a *little horn*, because Caesar did not assume
the name of king; but when Pompey and the greater part of the senate
were conquered, he could not enjoy his victory without assuming to
himself supreme power. Hence he made himself tribune of the people and
their dictator. Meanwhile, there were always Consuls; there was always
some shadow of a Republic, while they daily consulted the senate and sat
in his seat while the consuls were at the tribunals. Octavius followed
the same practice, and afterwards Tiberius also. For none of the
Caesars, unless he was consul, dared to ascend the tribunal; each had
his own seat, although from that place he commanded all others. It is
not surprising, then, if Daniel calls the monarchy of Julius and the
other Caesars a *little horn*, its splendor and dignity were not great
enough to eclipse the majesty of the senate; for while the senate
retained the name and form of honor, it is sufficiently known that one
man alone possessed the supreme power. He says, therefore, *this little
horn was raised among the ten others*. I must defer the explanation of
what follows, viz., *three of these ten were taken away.*

<span id="ii.x"></span>

<span id="ii.x-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="ii.x-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since thou hast formerly
admonished thy servants, that thy children, while they are pilgrims in
this world, must be familiar with horrible and cruel beasts, if the same
thing should happen to us, that we may be prepared for all contests. May
we endure and overcome all temptations, and may we never doubt thy
desire to defend us by thy protection and power, according to thy
promise. May we proceed through the midst of numberless dangers, until
after accomplishing the course of our warfare, we at length arrive at
that happy rest which is laid up for us in heaven by Christ our Lord. —
Amen.

<span id="ii.xi"></span>

<span id="ii.xi-p1"></span>Lecture Thirty-Fourth.

<span id="ii.xi-p2"></span>Three things remain to be explained by us in
expounding the Fourth Beast. First of all, *Three horns were taken away
from its face*; Secondly, *The little horn,* which rose among the ten,
*appeared with human eyes*; Thirdly, *It spoke magnificently*, or
uttered swelling words. With regard to the three horns, it is
sufficiently evident from the testimony of the angel that they were
three kings; not because this ought to be referred to persons, as I
yesterday disproved, but because the Romans were accustomed to send to
each province, rulers like kings who there exercised the supreme
authority. Those who extend this prophecy to the end of Christ’s
Kingdom, think that a dispersion which happened about three or five
hundred years after the death of Christ is intended; but they are
greatly mistaken. Clearly enough the whole strength of the Roman Empire
was exhausted and the provinces gradually cut off, till it became a kind
of mutilated body; but we yesterday showed the incorrectness of any
explanation of this oracle, except concerning the state of the Church at
the first Advent of Christ and the preaching of the Gospel. At that
time, it is well known, nothing had been subtracted from the boundaries
of the Empire. For Julius Caesar was formidable not only to the Gauls,
but also to the Germans; and besides this, the affairs of the East were
at peace. After his death, although Octavius or Augustus had suffered
two very destructive slaughters, especially under Quintilius Varus, who
had been sent into Germany with a powerful army, yet he also extended
the boundaries of the Empire, especially in the East. He also subdued
the whole of Spain, where no commotion afterwards took place. As,
therefore, at that period no province had been cut off from the Roman
Empire, what is the meaning of the expression*, Three horns were cut off
and removed from the face of the beast?* The solution is not, difficult.
Only let us observe how the little horn is compared with the first
stature of the beast. It first appeared with ten horns; when the little
horn arose its figure was changed. The Prophet then says — a part of the
horns was cut off, as the senate then ceased to create proconsuls. For
we know how Augustus assumed to himself certain provinces, and he did
this for the purpose of creating’ presidents at his own will, and of
constituting a strong force, ever at hand, should any one rebel against
him. For he did not care so much about provinces as about an army,
should any tumult arise. He was desirous, therefore, of throwing a
bridle over them all, lest any one should dare to attempt a revolution.
Whatever was thus added to *the little horn* was taken from the ten
horns, that is, from the whole body, as the state of the monarchy was
entirely changed. There is nothing forced in this exposition. We must
also contend for a definite or fixed number being put for an uncertain
one; as if the Prophet: had said — a part of the power of the beast was
abstracted after the rising’ of the little horn. Thus much for the first
clause.

<span id="ii.xi-p3"></span>He now adds, *The eyes in this small horn
were like those of men*; and then, *it spoke mighty things*, With
respect to the eyes, this expression implies — the form of a human body
was exhibited, because, the Caesars did not abolish the senate nor
change at once the whole form of the government; but, as we yesterday
said, they were content with power; and as to splendor, titles, and
pomp, they readily left these to the consuls and the senate. If any one
considers the manner in which those Caesars, who are doubtless intended
by *the little horn*, conducted themselves, their conduct will appear
like a human figure. For Julius Caesar pretended, although he was
dictator, to obey the senate’s authority, and the consuls asked the
opinion of the senators, after the ancient manner. He sat in the midst,
and permitted many things to be decreed without interposing his will.
Augustus also abused the shadow of the tribunitial power only for the
purpose of ruling the Empire. Thus he submitted to the consuls; and when
he wished to be elected to that office, he became a candidate with the
other competitors, and put on the white robe like a private citizen.
Tiberius also was a great pretender, and while plotting schemes of
tyranny, was neither open nor ingenuous in his plans. So also *the eyes
of a man appeared in the little horn*, that is, after this change took
place and the senate and people were deprived of their liberty. He who
held the government of the republic was not formidable, as an entire
beast, but was like a private man as to outward form.

<span id="ii.xi-p4"></span>The Prophet adds, *The small horn had a loud
sounding mouth* For although, with the view of conciliating favor, the
Caesars conducted themselves like men, we know how atrociously they
threatened their enemies, and how imperiously they either hindered or
committed whatever they lusted, as it seemed good to them. There was,
then, a great difference between their mouth and their eyes. For, as we
already said, the splendor and dignity of the empire was in the power of
the consuls and senate at the beginning. Meanwhile, by insidious arts,
the Caesars drew towards themselves the whole power, till no one dared
to do anything, except at their bidding. Many interpreters explain this
as blasphemy against God, and impiety; and the angel will touch upon
this point at the close of the chapter. But; if we weigh the whole
expression judiciously, what I say will appear correct, and the loud
speaking here mentioned by the Prophet will signify, that pride with
which the Caesars’, were puffed up, imposing silence on all men and
allowing no one to open their mouths contrary to their will. The
Prophet’s words are very well explained by this fact; *for the three
horns being removed from the ten*, means some part of the empire was
separated from the main body; then, *the small horn being endued with
human eyes*, implies a kind of modesty, as the Caesars acted like
private persons, and left outward show with the senate and people; and
thirdly, *when the mouth of the little horn spoke swellingly*,
trepidation seized upon all the Romans, and especially whoever enjoyed
any reputation, hung upon the nod of the Caesars, who imposed the vilest
slavery, and received the foulest and most shameful flattery from the
whole senate. It now follows, —

<span id="ii.xii"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p1"></span><span id="ii.xii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md)<span id="ii.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p2"></span>**9.** I beheld till the thrones were cast
down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment *was* white as
snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne *was like*
the fiery flame, *and* his wheels *as* burning fire.

<span id="ii.xii-p3"></span>**9.** Videbam usque dum throni erecti sunt,

solium ejus scintillae ignis, rotae ejus ignis ardens.

<span id="ii.xii-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.xii-p6"></span><span id="ii.xii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p7"></span>Daniel now relates how he saw another
figure, namely, God sitting on his throne to exercise judgment. We shall
see it afterwards concerning Christ, but Daniel now teaches only the
appearance of God in his character of a judge. This was the reason why
many persons extend this prophecy to the second Advent of Christ — an
interpretation by no means correct, as I shall show more copiously in
the proper place. But first it is worth while to consider here, why he
says — the Ancient of days, meaning the eternal Deity himself, ascended
the throne judgment. This scene seems unnecessary, because it is the
peculiar office of God to govern the world; and as we know this cannot
be done without upright judgment, it follows that God has been a
perpetual judge from the creation of the world. Now, even a moderate
acquaintance with the Scriptures shows how well this passage suits us by
appealing to our senses; for unless God’s power is made conspicuous, we
think it either abolished or interrupted. Hence those forms of
expression which occur elsewhere; as, “How long art thou silent, O Lord;
and how long wilt thou cease from us?” (<span
id="ii.xii-p7.1"></span>[Ps 13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.xii-p7.1"></span>; <span id="ii.xii-p7.2"></span>[Ps
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa009.htm#007.md)<span id="ii.xii-p7.2"></span>, and
elsewhere,) and — God ascends his throne — for we should not acknowledge
him as a judge, unless he really and experimentally proved himself such.
This then is the reason why Daniel says God himself was seated in
judgment.

<span id="ii.xii-p8"></span>But before we proceed further, we must
observe the sense in which he says — thrones were either erected or east
down — for the word <span id="ii.xii-p8.1"></span>םור, *rum* can be
taken in either sense. Those who translate it, “Thrones were removed,”
interpret it. of the Four monarchies already mentioned. But; for my
part, I rather incline to a different opinion. If any one prefers
explaining’ it of these Monarchies, I do not contend with him, for that;
sense is probable; and as far as the pith of the matter is concerned,
there is not much difference. But I think the thrones or seats are here
proceed to exhibit; the divine judgment, because the Prophet will
immediately’ represent myriads of angels standing before God. We know’
how often angels are adorned with this title as if they were, assessors
of Deity; and the form of speech which Daniel uses when he says, “The
judgment was set,” will also agree with this. He speaks here of
assessors with the judge, as if God did not sit alone, but had
councilors joined with him. In my opinion the most suitable explanation
is, — thrones were created for the Almighty to sit on with his
councilors; not implying his need of any council, but. of his own
goodwill and mere favor he dignifies angels with this honor, as we shall
see immediately. Daniel therefore describes, after our human fashion,
the preparations for judgment; just as if any king should go publicly
forth for the purpose of transacting any business of moment, and should
ascend his tribunal. Councilors and nobles would sit around him on both
sides, not partaking of his power, but rather increasing the splendor of
his appearance. For if the king alone should occupy the whole place, the
dignity would not be so magnificent as when his nobles, who depend upon
him, are present on all sides, because they far surpass the ordinary
multitude. Daniel, therefore, relates the vision presented to him in
this form; first, ‘because he was a man dwelling in the flesh; and next,
he did not see it for himself personally, but for the common benefit of
the whole Church. Thus God wished to exhibit a representation which
might infuse into the Prophet’s mind and into those of all the pious, a
feeling of admiration, and yet might have something in common with human
proceedings. *Thrones*, therefore, he says, *were erected;* afterwards*,
the Ancient of days was seated.* I have already expounded how God then
began to seat himself, as he had previously appeared to be passive, and
not to exercise justice in the world. For when things are disturbed and
mingled with much darkness, who can say, “God reigns?” God seems to be
shut up in heaven, when things are discomposed and turbulent upon earth.
On the other hand, he is said to ascend his tribunal when he assumes to
himself the office of a judge, and openly demonstrates that he is
neither asleep nor absent, although he lies hid from human perception.

<span id="ii.xii-p9"></span>This form of speech was very appropriate for
denoting the coming of Christ. For God then chiefly displayed his
supreme power, as Paul quotes a passage from the Psalms, (<span
id="ii.xii-p9.1"></span>[Ps 68:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#008.md)<span

“Thou hast ascended on high.” When the subject treated is the first
coming of Christ, it ought not to be restricted to the thirty-three
years of his sojourn in the world, but it embraces his ascension, and
that preaching of the gospel which ushered in his kingdom;-this will be
said again more clearly and copiously. Daniel appropriately relates how
God was seated when the first advent of Christ is depicted, since the
majesty of God shone in the person of Christ; for which reason he is
called

<span id="ii.xii-p10"></span>“The invisible image of God and the
character of his glory,” (<span id="ii.xii-p10.1"></span>[Heb
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003)<span id="ii.xii-p10.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="ii.xii-p11"></span>that is, of the substance or person of the
Father. God therefore, who had seemed for so many ages not to notice the
world nor to care for his elect people, ascended his tribunal at the
advent of Christ. To this subject the Psalms, from the 95th to the
100th, all relate — “God reigns, let the earth rejoice;” “God reigns,
let the islands be afraid.” In truth, God had not dwelt in complete
privacy before Christ’s advent; but. the empire which he had erected was
hidden and unseen, until he showed forth his glory in the person of his
only begotten Son. *The Ancient of days*, therefore, *was seated*

<span id="ii.xii-p12"></span>He now says, *His raiment was white like
snow the hair of his head was like pure wool.* God here shows himself to
his Prophet in the form of man. We know how impossible it is for us to
behold God as he really exists, till we ourselves become like Him, as
John says in his canonical epistle. (<span id="ii.xii-p12.1"></span>[1Jo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002)<span id="ii.xii-p12.1"></span>..md)
As our capacity cannot endure the fullness of that surpassing glory
which essentially belongs to God, whenever he appears to us, he must
necessarily put on a form adapted to our comprehension. God, therefore,
was never seen by the fathers in his own natural perfection; but as far
as their capacities allowed, he afforded them a taste of his presence
for the sure acknowledgment of his Deity; and yet they comprehended him
as far as it was useful for them and they were able to bear it. This is
the reason why God appeared *with a white garment*, which is
characteristic of heaven; and *with snowy hair*, like white and clean
wool. To the same purpose is the following: *His throne was like sparks
of fire*, that is, like glowing fire; *his wheels were like burning
fire*. God in reality neither occupies any throne, nor is carried on
wheels; but, as I already said, we ought not to imagine God in his
essence to be like any appearance, to his own Prophet and other holy
fathers, but he put on various appearances, according to man’s
comprehension, to whom he wished to give some signs of his presence. I
need not dwell longer on these forms of speech, though subtle allegories
are pleasing to many. I am satisfied with holding what is solid and
sure. It now follows: —

<span id="ii.xiii"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p1"></span><span id="ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010.md)<span id="ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p2"></span>**10.** A fiery stream issued and came
forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten
thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and
the books were opened.

<span id="ii.xiii-p3"></span>**10.** Fluvius  <span
id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) ignis fluebat, et exibat a praesentia
ejus, vel a conspectu: millia millium  <span
id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) ministrabant ei: et decies millia millium
 <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) coram ipso stabant: judicium
sedit, et libri aperti sunt.

<span id="ii.xiii-p7"></span> 

<span id="ii.xiii-p8"></span><span id="ii.xiii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p9"></span>Daniel proceeds with what he commenced in
the former verse. He says a splendor or stream of fire; for <span
id="ii.xiii-p9.1"></span>רהנ, *neher*, may be used in both senses, since
<span id="ii.xiii-p9.2"></span>רהנ, *neher*, signifies both “to flow”
and “to shine.” Yet, since he previously spoke of splendor, the word
“stream” will suit the passage very well; for a fiery stream issued from
the presence of God, which both inundated and burnt up the land. Without
doubt God wished to inspire his Prophet with fear for the purpose of
arousing him the better, as we never sufficiently comprehend his majesty
unless when humbled; and we cannot experience this humility without
fear. This is the reason why God always shows something terrible when he
appears to his servants, not merely to create astonishment, but to
excite their fear and reverence. Hence God seems to have considered this
point in this vision, when the stream took its rise from his appearance,
even a river of flame. Afterwards he adds, numberless attendants stood
before him. Without the slightest doubt, the Prophet here speaks of
angels. he says there were thousands of thousands, or ten times a
hundred thousand; and again, ten thousand times ten thousand, that is,
ten thousand myriads. Here the numbers are not reckoned, but God
signifies his having at hand the greatest forces obedient to his will,
and far surpassing any armies which the greatest; and most powerful
princes collect. This passage teaches us that angels were created for
the purpose of receiving and executing the commands of God, and of being
the ministers of God, as it were his hands in heaven and in earth. As
regards numbers, no wonder many myriads are enumerated by the Prophet.
Christ said,

<span id="ii.xiii-p10"></span>“Can I not ask the Father and he will send
a legion?”  
(<span id="ii.xiii-p10.2"></span>[Mt
26:53](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#053.md)<span
id="ii.xiii-p10.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xiii-p11"></span>So, in this passage, Daniel says there
were numberless angels under God’s hand, and there was no need of
collecting armies after the manner of princes, since they are always
present and intent on obedience. Thus they immediately fulfill all his
commands, as angels run swiftly throughout heaven and earth. We also
perceive the supreme power of the Almighty denoted here, as if the
Prophet had said — God is not like a king or a judge merely by title,
but he possesses the greatest and most unlimited power; he has myriads
of satellites ever at hand for the purpose of fulfilling and executing
his supreme will. And in this sense he says*, they stood before him*. He
uses the word for ministry or service, and afterwards, adds, *to stand*.
For ministers cannot always render their service as quickly as their
rulers desire. But the angelic method is different. Not only were they
prepared to obey, but in a moment they understand what God wishes and
commands without needing time for compliance. We see even the greatest
princes cannot immediately carry out their decrees, because their
ministers are not always at hand. But there is no necessity for dwelling
longer upon angels. Daniel adds, The judgment was fixed, and the books
were opened. Although God alone is eminent and conspicuous above the
angels, and the height of their glory and dignity does not obscure the
supreme empire of the Almighty, yet, as we have formerly said, he deems
them worthy of the honor of being placed as councilors on each side of
him, and that for the sake of illustrating his own majesty. For we have
stated that nobles do not sit at the side of monarchs to diminish his
majesty or to attract it to themselves, but rather to reflect the
magnitude and power of the monarch more fully. This is the reason why
the Prophet joins angels with God, not as allies, but simply as his
councilors.

<span id="ii.xiii-p12"></span>I refer the phrase, the books were opened,
to the preaching of the gospel. Although God was recognized in Judea, as
it is said in the 76th Psalm, (<span id="ii.xiii-p12.1"></span>[Ps
76:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002)<span id="ii.xiii-p12.1"></span>,.md)
yet this acknowledgment was but slight and involved in many figures. God
was revealed through enigmas until Christ’s coming; but then he
manifested himself truly, just like opening books previously shut. There
is therefore a contrast to be observed here between that obscure season
which preceded the coming of Christ, and the clearness which now shines
under the gospel. Because, therefore, God was plainly made known after
the Sun of righteousness arose, according to the Prophet Malachi, (<span
id="ii.xiii-p12.2"></span>[Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002)<span id="ii.xiii-p12.2"></span>,.md)
this is the reason why the books are now said to have been opened at
that season. Meanwhile, we confess that God was not altogether hidden,
nor did he speak from astonishment, but this is said comparatively by
the Prophet, as the books were opened whenever God openly appeared as
the Judge, Father, and Preserver of the world, in the person of his only
begotten Son. It afterwards follows: —

<span id="ii.xiv"></span>

<span id="ii.xiv-p1"></span><span id="ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#011.md)<span id="ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiv-p2"></span>**11.** I beheld then because of the voice
of the great words which the horn spake: I beheld *even* till the beast
was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.

<span id="ii.xiv-p3"></span>**11.** Videbam tunc, propter vocem  <span
id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) sermonum grandium quos cornu proferebat,
videbam usque dum occisa fuit bestia, et abolitum corpus ejus, et data
fuit incendio ignis.

<span id="ii.xiv-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.xiv-p6"></span><span id="ii.xiv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiv-p7"></span>Since the presumptuous speaking of the
little horn terrified the Prophet, he now says he was *attentive in
considering this portion*. He next says, *The beast was slain, and his
body was consumed by the burning of fire*. This ought clearly to be
referred to the end of the Roman empire. For, from the time when
foreigners obtained the mastery, the fourth beast ceased to flourish.
The name was always retained, yet with great mockery of that ancient
monarchy. I now omit all mention of Caligula, Nero, Domitian, and
similar monsters. But when Spaniards and Africans acquired the absolute
sway, can we call Rome any longer the mistress of the world? Surely this
would be foolish indeed! To this very day the Germans also say they
possess the Roman empire; but while the title of empire has passed to
the Germans, clearly enough Rome is at this very day in slavery. For as
to the Pope having erected his own throne there, this empire is unworthy
of the name of monarchy; but whatever be our view of this point, for
about 1500 years the Romans have been in bondage as slaves to foreign
princes. For, after the death of Nero:, Trajan was his successor, and
from that time scarcely a single Roman obtained the empire; and God
branded it with the, most disgraceful marks of ignominy, when a
swine-herd was created emperor, and that too by the lust of the
soldiery! The senate retained its name till then; But. if it pleased the
soldiers to create any one a Caesar, the senate was immediately
compelled to submit to their dictation. Thus, the Prophet with great
propriety says, *The beast was slain* shortly after the promulgation of
the gospel. Then the presumptuous speaking of *the little horn* was at
an end, and *the fourth beast* was extinct about the same time. For then
no Roman became an Emperor who claimed for himself any share of power;
but Rome itself fell into disgraceful slavery, and not only foreigners
reigned there most shamefully, but even barbarians, swine-herds, and
cow-herds! All this occurred in fulfillment of what God had shown to his
Prophet, namely, after the coming of Christ and the opening of the
books, that is — after the knowledge which shone upon the world through
the preaching of the gospel — the destruction of that fourth beast and
of the Roman empire was close at hand.

<span id="ii.xv"></span>

<span id="ii.xv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="ii.xv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, whatever revolutions
happen daily in the world, that we may always be intent on the sight of
thy glory, once manifested to us in thy Son. May the splendor of thy
majesty illuminate our hearts, and may we pass beyond the visible
heavens, the sun, the moon, and every shining thing; and may we behold
the blessedness of thy kingdom, which thou proposest to us in the light
of thy Gospel. May we walk through the midst of the darkness and
afflictions of the world, content with that light by which thou invitest
us to the hope of the eternal inheritance which thou hast promised us,
and acquired for us by the blood of thine only begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="ii.xvi-p1"></span>Lecture Thirty-Five

<span id="ii.xvii"></span>

<span id="ii.xvii-p1"></span><span id="ii.xvii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#012.md)<span id="ii.xvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xvii-p2"></span>**12.** As concerning the rest of the
beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were
prolonged for a season and time.

<span id="ii.xvii-p3"></span>**12.** Et reliquis bestiis abstulerant
potestatum, vel dominationem. Et longitudo in vita data illis fuerat
usque ad tempus at tempus.

<span id="ii.xvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.xvii-p5"></span><span id="ii.xvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xvii-p6"></span>Without doubt the Prophet refers to what
ought to come first in order, as the empires of which he is speaking
were extinct before the Roman. Hence these verbs ought to be taken in
the pluperfect tense, because the power had been already removed from
the other three beasts. For the Hebrews were, accustomed to repeat
afterwards anything which had been omitted, and they do not always
observe the order of time in their narratives. Thus, after he had said
the fourth beast was slain and consumed by burning, he now adds what he
had omitted concerning the remaining three, namely*, their dominion had
been take, from them*. He adds also what is worthy of notice, *Length*,
or continuance, *in life was granted to them even for a time and a
time.* There are two different words used here, but they signify one and
the same thing, namely, a convenient time. Here the Prophet understands
how nothing happens accidentally, but all things are carried on in the
world in their own time, as God has decreed them in heaven. Perhaps when
the subject-matter of the discourse is *length of life,* it signifies
the protracted period of these afflictions, as they should not pass away
suddenly like clouds. Not. only severe but lengthened trials are said to
await the faithful, which must afflict their minds with weariness,
unless the hope of a better issue propped them up. Thus, the Holy Spirit
predicts how God would at length deliver his Church when he had
exercised its patience for a length of time. From *the rest of the
beasts power was taken away*. The copula in the word <span
id="ii.xvii-p6.1"></span>הכרא, *ve-arkeh*, “and length,” may be resolved
in this way — “because length in life;” as if he had said, The trials by
which the sons of God were to be oppressed should not be perpetual,
because God had prescribed and defined a fixed period. *A continuance*,
therefore, *in life was granted to them*, namely, *for a time and a
time*. The copula may be treated as “an adversative particle” as if he
had said, “although a continuance,” that is, although the people should
not immediately escape from those sorrowful cares which oppressed them,
yet God’s opportunity would at length arrive, that is, the time at which
it pleased God to redeem his own Church. But the former exposition seems
more genuine and more consistent, because length of time has its own
limits and boundaries. There is also a contrast between, the words <span
id="ii.xvii-p6.2"></span>הכרא, *arkeh*, “length,” and <span
id="ii.xvii-p6.3"></span>ןמז, *zemen*, “time,” and <span
id="ii.xvii-p6.4"></span>ןדע, *gneden*, “time,” because length or
“prolonging” has reference to our perceptions; for when we are suffering
pain, the greatest speed seems delay. Thus, any one in anxiety for an
improved state of things counts every moment, and is so flagrant in his
desires as to call the Almighty in question for any delay. As, then, the
impatience of men is so great, when they are expecting with anxiety this
freedom from adversity, the Prophet says, in the ordinary acceptation of
the phrase, *length of time was granted to the beasts*; but he opposes a
fit time; as if he had said — They act preposterously who thus indulge
their own passions. Since God has fixed his own time, they require
patience, and need not reckon the years; but this one thing must be
concluded, when the Lord pleases he will not delay his help. This,
therefore, is the full sense of the verse. It follows: —

<span id="ii.xviii"></span>

<span id="ii.xviii-p1"></span><span id="ii.xviii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#013.md)<span id="ii.xviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xviii-p2"></span>**13.** I saw in the night-visions, and,
behold, *one* like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and
came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.

<span id="ii.xviii-p3"></span>**13.** Videbam in visionibus noctis: et
ecce in nubibus  <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md) coeli, vel
coelorum, tanquam Filius hominus veniebat, et usque ad Antiquum dierum
venit, et coram eo repraesentarunt.  <span
id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md)

<span id="ii.xviii-p6"></span> 

<span id="ii.xviii-p7"></span><span id="ii.xviii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xviii-p8"></span>After Daniel has narrated how he saw God
on the throne of judgment, openly exercising his power and laying open
to the world what was formerly hidden from it, namely, his supreme
authority in its government, he now adds the second part of the vision*,
As it were the Son of man appeared in the clouds.* Without doubt this is
to be understood of Christ, and the Jews, perverse as they are, are
ashamed to deny it, although they differ afterwards about Christ. But
the object of the vision was to enable the faithful certainly to expect
the promised Redeemer in his own time. He had been endued with heavenly
power, and was seated at his Father’s right hand. Hence Daniel says, *He
was intent on these nightly visions*. And this repetition is by no means
superfluous, as it informs us of the Prophet’s alertness when God shews
himself present. Daniel expresses this fully in his own words, for he
roused himself when he perceived important, and rare, and singular
matters set before him. This attentive disposition of the Prophet ought
to stir us up to read his prophecy without listlessness, and with
awakened minds earnestly to derive from heaven true and sincere
intelligence. *I was*, then, says he, *attentive in visions of the
night, and beheld as it were the Son of man*. I have already said this
passage cannot be otherwise taken than concerning Christ. We must now
see why he uses the word “like” the Son of man; that is, why he uses the
letter <span id="ii.xviii-p8.1"></span>כ, *ke*, the mark for likeness.
This might be twisted in favor of the folly of the Manichees, who
thought Christ’s body to be only imaginary. For, as they wrest the words
of Paul, and pervert their sense, that Christ was in likeness as a man,
(<span id="ii.xviii-p8.2"></span>[Php
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)<span id="ii.xviii-p8.2"></span>..md)
so also they may abuse the Prophet’s testimony, when Christ is not said
to be a man but only like one. With respect to Paul’s words, he is not
speaking of the essence of his human nature, but only of his state; for
he is speaking of Christ being made man, of his condition being humble
and abject, and even servile. But in the passage before us the reason is
different. For the Prophet says, *He appeared* to him as the *Son of
man*, as Christ had not yet taken upon him our flesh. And we must remark
that saying of Paul’s: When the fullness of time was come, God sent his
Son, made of a woman. (<span id="ii.xviii-p8.3"></span>[Ga
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004)<span id="ii.xviii-p8.3"></span>..md)
Christ then began to be a man when he appeared on earth as Mediator, for
he had not assumed the seed of Abraham before he was joined with us in
brotherly union. This is the reason why the Prophet does not pronounce
Christ to have been man at this period, but only like man; for otherwise
he had not been that Messiah formerly promised under the Law as the son
of Abraham and David. For if from the beginning he had put on human
flesh, he would not have been born of these progenitors. It follows,
then, that Christ was not a man from the beginning, but only appeared so
in a figure. As also Irenaeus  <span id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md)
says: This was a “prelude,” he uses that word. Tertullian also says:
“Then the Son of God put on a specimen of humanity.”  <span
id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) This was a symbol, therefore, of Christ’s
future flesh, although that flesh did not yet exist. We now see how
suitably this figure agrees with the thing signified, wherein Christ was
set forth as the Son of man, although he was then the eternal Word of
God.

<span id="ii.xviii-p11"></span>It afterwards follows, *He came to the
Ancient of days* This, in my judgment, ought to be explained of Christ’s
ascension; for he then commenced his reign, as we see in numberless
passages of Scripture. Nor is this passage contrary to what the Prophet
had previously said — he saw the Son of man in the clouds. For by this
expression he simply wishes to teach how Christ, although like a man,
yet differed from the whole human race, and was not of the common order
of men; but excelled the whole world in dignity. He expresses much more
when he says, in the second clause, *He came even unto the Ancient of
days* For although the Divine Majesty lay hid in Christ, yet he
discharged the duty of a slave, and emptied himself, as Paul says,
(<span id="ii.xviii-p11.1"></span>[Php
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)<span id="ii.xviii-p11.1"></span>..md)
So also we read in the first chapter of John, (<span
id="ii.xviii-p11.2"></span>[Joh
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.xviii-p11.2"></span>,) Glory appeared in him as of the only
begotten Son of God; that is, which belongs to the only begotten Son of
God. Christ, therefore, thus put off his glory for the time, and yet by
His miracles and many other proofs afforded a clear and evident;
specimen of his celestial glory. He really appeared to Daniel in the
clouds, but when he ascended to heaven, he then put off this mortal
body, and put on a new life. Thus Paul also, in the sixth chapter to the
Romans, says, he lives the life of God, (<span
id="ii.xviii-p11.3"></span>[Ro
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.xviii-p11.3"></span>;) and other phrases often used by our Lord
himself agree very well with this, especially in the Evangelist John, “I
go to the Father.” “It is expedient for me to go to the Father, for the
Father is greater than I,” (<span id="ii.xviii-p11.4"></span>[Joh
16:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007.md)<span id="ii.xviii-p11.4"></span>;
<span id="ii.xviii-p11.5"></span>[Joh
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.xviii-p11.5"></span>;) that is, it is expedient for me to ascend
to that royal tribunal which the Father has erected for me by his
eternal counsel, and thus the whole world will feel the supreme power to
have been entrusted to. me. Now, therefore, we understand the full
meaning of the Prophet’s words.

<span id="ii.xviii-p12"></span>But as there are many fanatics who wrest
what has been said of the person of the Mediator, as if Christ were not
the true God, but had a beginning from the Father at some definite
period of time, we must observe how the Prophet’s expression are neither
the human nor the divine nature of Christ properly speaking, but a
Mediator is here set before us who is God manifest in flesh. For if we
hold this principle that Christ is described to us, not as either the
word of God, or the seed of Abraham, but as Mediator, that is, eternal
God who was willing to become man, to become subject to God the Father,
to be made like us, and to be our advocate, then no difficulty will
remain. Thus he appeared to Daniel like the Son of man, who became
afterwards truly and really so. He was in the clouds, that is, separated
from the common lot of mankind, as he always carried with him some marks
of deity, even in his humility. *He now arrives as the Ancient of days*,
that is, when he ascends to heaven, because his divine majesty was then
revealed. And hence he says, It is expedient for you, for me to go to
the Father, because the Father is greater than I. (<span
id="ii.xviii-p12.1"></span>[Joh
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.xviii-p12.1"></span>.) Christ here detracts nothing from his
deity, but as his nature was not known in the world, while his divine
majesty lay hid in the form of a servant, he calls the Father simply
God; as if he had said, If I remain with you upon earth, what would the
presence of my flesh profit you? But when I ascend to heaven, then that
oneness which I have with the Father will become conspicuous. When,
therefore, the world shall understand that I am one with the Father, and
that the Deity is one, the hope of all the pious will become more firm
and unconquered against all temptations; for they will know themselves
to be equally under the protection of both God and man. If, therefore,
Christ were always dwelling upon earth, and had borne witness a thousand
times to his being given to us by his Father as the guardian of our
salvation, yet there always would have been some hesitation and anxiety.
But when we know him to be seated at his Father’s right hand, we then
understand him to be truly God, because all knees would not be bent
before him, unless he had been the eternal God. We must hold that
passage of Isaiah, (<span id="ii.xviii-p12.2"></span>[Isa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.xviii-p12.2"></span>,) As I live, saith the Lord, my glory I will
not give to another. As, therefore, God’s glory can never be transferred
to either man or any other creature, the true unity and nature of God
necessarily shines forth in the human nature of Christ, for every knee
is bent before him. Now, therefore, we understand the sense in which the
Prophet says, Christ *came as the Son of man,* that is, like a man,
*even to the Ancient of days* For after Christ had passed through the
period of his self-abasement, according’ to Paul, (<span
id="ii.xviii-p12.3"></span>[Php
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)<span id="ii.xviii-p12.3"></span>,.md)
he ascended into heaven, and a dominion was bestowed upon him, as the
Prophet says in the next verse. This passage, then, without the
slightest doubt, ought to be received of Christ’s ascension, after he
had ceased being mortal man. He says, *He was represented before God,*
namely, because he sits at his right hand. It follows, —

<span id="ii.xix"></span>

<span id="ii.xix-p1"></span><span id="ii.xix-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md)<span id="ii.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xix-p2"></span>**14.** And there was given him dominion,
and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages,
should serve him: his dominion *is* an everlasting dominion, which shall
not pass away, and his kingdom *that* which shall not be destroyed.

<span id="ii.xix-p3"></span>**14.** Et ei data fuit potrstas, et gloria,

<span id="ii.xix-p6"></span><span id="ii.xix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xix-p7"></span>The Prophet; confirms and explains more
clearly in this verse what he had said in the former one. For we may
collect from it how the personage previously mentioned arrived at the
Ancient of days, who is God, namely, *because power was given to him.*
For although Christ truly ascended into heaven, (<span
id="ii.xix-p7.1"></span>[Mt 28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.xix-p7.1"></span>,) yet we ought clearly to weigh the purpose of
his doing so. It was to acquire the supreme power in heaven and in
earth, as he himself says. And Paul also mentions this purpose in the
first and second chapters of the Ephesians. (<span
id="ii.xix-p7.2"></span>[Eph 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.xix-p7.2"></span>; <span id="ii.xix-p7.3"></span>[Eph
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#007)<span id="ii.xix-p7.3"></span>..md)
Christ left the world and ascended to the Father; first, to subdue all
powers to himself, and to render angels obedient; next, to restrain the
devil, and to protect and preserve the Church by his help, as well as
all the elect of God the Father. So, therefore, Daniel now proceeds with
what he formerly said concerning the approach of Christ to God. Thus the
madness of those who argue against Christ; being true and eternal God,
because he is said to have come to the Ancient of days, is refuted.
First of all, as we have said, this is understood of the person of the
Mediator; next, all doubt is taken away when the Prophet adds, *Power
was given unto him*. Behold, therefore, a certain explanation. We will
not say it was bestowed with relation to his being, and being called
God. It was given to him as Mediator, as God manifest in flesh, and with
respect to his human nature. We observe how well all these things agree,
when the Prophet here says, *The chief power was given to Christ* We
must hold therefore its reference to that manifestation, because Christ
was from the beginning the life of men, the world was created by him,
and his energy always sustained it, (<span id="ii.xix-p7.4"></span>[Joh
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004)<span id="ii.xix-p7.4"></span>;.md)
but power was given to him to inform us how God reigned by means of his
hand. If we were required to seek God without a Mediator, his distance
would be far too great, but when a Mediator meets us, and offers himself
to us in our human nature, such is the nearness between God and us, that
our faith easily passes beyond the world and penetrates the very
heavens. For this reason therefore, *All power, honor, and kingdom was*
given to Christ. He adds also, *All nations shall serve him*, that is,
they may serve him; for the copula ought to be translated thus, — *That
all nations, people, and tongues should serve him.* We have shewn how
this ought properly to be understood of the commencement of the reign of
Christ, and ought not to be connected with its final close, as many
interpreters force and strain the passage. Meanwhile we must add, that
the events which the Prophet here narrates are not yet complete; but
this ought to be familiar to all the pious, for whenever the kingdom of
Christ is treated of, his glory magnificently extolled, as if it were
now absolutely complete in all its parts. It is not surprising, if
according to the frequent and perpetual usage of Scripture, the Prophet
should say *power was given to* Christ, to subdue all people, nations,
and languages to himself, as it is said in <span
id="ii.xix-p7.5"></span>[Ps 110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.xix-p7.5"></span>, — Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit thou on my
right hand, until I make thy enemies the footstool of thy feet. We see,
then, how Christ was raised to his own empire to govern his Church in
the name and with the power of his Father, while at the same time many
enemies rise up against him. Still the obstinacy of the devil and of all
impious men continues, although Christ governs heaven and earth, and is
the supreme king before whom every knee is bent. We also know how marked
the difference is between the beginning of his kingdom and its final
completion. Whatever the meaning, this vision suits very well with many
assertions of Christ, where he bears witness to the power given him by
the Father. (<span id="ii.xix-p7.6"></span>[Mt
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#018.md)<span id="ii.xix-p7.6"></span>,
and elsewhere) He does not here speak of the last judgment, but is only
teaching us, the object of his ascension to heaven.

<span id="ii.xix-p8"></span>This view the Prophet confirms by saying,
*his dominion is the dominion of an age, which is mot taken away, and
his kingdom can never be corrupted* or abolished. For by these words he
teaches familiarly and openly, why Christ is the Supreme King, namely,
for the perpetual government of his Church in this world. We ought to
look up to heaven in very deed whenever the state of the Church is under
consideration, since its happiness is neither earthly, nor perishable,
nor temporary, though nothing sublunary is either firm or perpetual. But
when the Prophet says Christ’s dominion is eternal, he doubtless
signifies the constant endurance of his monarchy, even to the end of the
world, when he shall gather his people together to a happy life and an
eternal inheritance. Although, therefore, celestial immortality is
comprehended under these words, yet in a former passage the Prophet
pointed out the perpetual existence of the Church in this world, because
Christ will defend it, although daily subject to numberless causes of
destruction. And who would not assert the almost daily perishing of the
Church, if God did not wonderfully preserve it by the hand of his only
begotten Son? Hence it is correct to understand the phrase, *His kingdom
shall be the kingdom of an age.* And thus we receive no common
consolation, when we see the Church tossed about amidst various
fluctuations, and almost buried and devoured by continual shipwrecks,
yet Christ is ever stretching forth his hand to preserve it, and to save
it from every sorrowful and horrible species of destruction. It now
follows, —

<span id="ii.xx"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p1"></span><span id="ii.xx-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:15-16](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#015.md)<span id="ii.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p2"></span>**15.** I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in
the midst of *my* body, and the visions of my head troubled me.

<span id="ii.xx-p3"></span>**15.** Succisus fuit spiritus meus mihi
Danieli,  <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) in medio corporis,  <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) et visiones capitas mei terruerunt me.

<span id="ii.xx-p6"></span>**16.** I came near unto one of them that
stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made
me know the interpretation of the things.

<span id="ii.xx-p7"></span>**16.** Accessi ad unum ex his qui aderant,
et sciscitatus sum ex eo veritatum super his omnibus: et dixit mihi, et
enarrationem sermonum patefecit mihi.

<span id="ii.xx-p8"></span> 

<span id="ii.xx-p9"></span><span id="ii.xx-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p10"></span>Daniel says, his spirit was either cut off
or vanished, as if he suffered some mental deficiency. In this way God
wished to communicate to his servant the magnitude of the vision. And he
inspires us also with reverence for this vision, lest we should treat it
coldly and commonly. But we ought to understand how God opens up to
Daniel, his servant, and to us by his assistance and ministry, these
mysteries which meaning; be otherwise comprehended by our human senses.
For if Daniel, whom we know to have been a remarkable Prophet, felt his
spirit to be so deficient and nearly vanishing away, surely we who as
yet know so little of God’s mysteries, nay, who have scarcely tasted
their first rudiments, never can attain so great a height, unless we
overcome the world and shake off all human sensations. For these things
cannot be perceived by us unless our minds are clear and completely
purified.

<span id="ii.xx-p11"></span>He says, therefore, in the first place, *his
spirit was cut off,* or vanished, *in the midst of his body;* as if he
had said he was almost lifeless and nearly dead. And he added, as
reason, *the visions of his head had frightened him* No one can faint
away — an event which sometimes happens — with-out a cause. When that
terror called a panic seizes upon some persons, we observe how they
become deprived of self-possession, and lie almost lifeless. But Daniel,
to shew himself separate from such persons, says *he was frightened* or
disturbed *by visions of his head*; as if he had said, he was not
disturbed without occasion, but it was caused by the mystery of which
the vision had been offered to him. *He came to one of those standing
by.* He had said a short time before, ten thousand times ten thousand
were at the right hand of the tribunal of God. Without the slightest
doubt, the Prophet asked one of these angels. And here we must notice
his modesty and docility in flying to some instructor, because he was
conscious of his own ignorance and found no other remedy. At the same
time, we are taught by the Prophet’s example not to reject all visions,
but to seek their interpretation from God himself. Although God in these
days does not address us by visions, yet he wishes us to be content with
his Law and Gospel, while angels do not appear to us, and do not openly
and conspicuously descend from heaven; but, since Scripture is obscure
to us, through the darkness in which we are involved, let us learn not
to reject whatever surpasses our capacity, even when some dark veil
envelops it, but let us fly to the remedy which Daniel used, not to seek
the understanding of God’s word from angels, who do not appear to us,
but from Christ himself, who in these days teaches us familiarly by
means of pastors and ministers of the gospel. Now, as a supreme and only
Master has been given us from the Father, so also he exercises the
office of teacher by his own ministers whom he set over us. (<span
id="ii.xx-p11.1"></span>[Matt. 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#010)<span id="ii.xx-p11.1"></span>..md)
Therefore, as Daniel approached the angel who was near him, so we are
daily commanded to approach those who have been entrusted with the gift
of interpretation and who can faithfully explain to us things otherwise
obscure. Our confidence, too, ought to be increased by what follows
directly: *The angel spoke, and opened the interpretation of the words.*
Daniel here shews his modesty and humility not to have been in vain, as
God commanded the angel to explain all obscurities. So, without doubt,
Christ will at this time satisfy our prayers, if we are truly his
disciples; that is, if, after those mysteries which surpass and absorb
all our senses have terrified us, we fly to that order which he has
prescribed for us, and seen from faithful ministers and teachers the
interpretation of those things which are difficult and obscure, and
entirely concealed from us.

<span id="ii.xxi"></span>

<span id="ii.xxi-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="ii.xxi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since the faith of the
fathers was supported by obscure shadows, by which thou didst wish it to
be nourished, until thy Son was manifestly revealed to us in the flesh:
Grant, I pray thee, at this day, after he has appeared to us as the best
and most perfect teacher, and explained thy counsels to us similarly,
that we may not be either so dull or so careless as to allow the great
clearness of the manifestation of thyself offered us in the Gospel to
escape from our grasp. May we be so directed towards life eternal, until
after the performance of our course in this present life, and the
removal of all obstacles which Satan places in our way, either to delay
us or turn us aside, we may at length arrive at the enjoyment of that
blessed life in which Christ., thine only begotten Son, has preceded us.
May we thus be co-heirs with him, and as thou hast appointed him sole
inheritor, so may he gather us unto the secure inheritance of a blessed
immortality. Amen.

<span id="ii.xxiii"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p1"></span><span id="ii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p2"></span>**17.** These great beasts, which are
four, *are* four kings, *which* shall arise out of the earth.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p3"></span>**17.** Hae bestiae magnae quas vidisti

<span id="ii.xxiii-p4"></span>**18.** But the saints of the most High

and ever.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p5"></span>**18.** Et sortientur, obtinebunt, regmu
sancturum excelsorum: et possidebunt regnum usque in seculum, et usque
in secular seculorum.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p6"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxiii-p7"></span><span id="ii.xxiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p8"></span>Here the angel answers Daniel concerning
the four beasts which had been shewn him in the vision. He says,
therefore, *Four kingdoms arose,* and by the name kingdom he means
monarchy; for we know that the Persians had many kings until Alexander
transferred to himself the empire of the East. Although Cyrus had seven
or eight successors, yet the Persian empire continued through them all.
And as we saw before, although whatever Alexander had acquired by his
arms was divided among his four successors, yet it still remained the
Macedonian kingdom. The same thing must be said concerning the fourth
kingdom. Although we know consuls to have been created yearly at Rome,
yet that government lasted till Julius Caesar destroyed it, and consumed
the strength of the empire, so as to surpass by his power the splendid
altitude which had been long and widely conspicuous in the world. Hence
the angel replied, *By the four beasts four kingdoms* are denoted: he
says, *shall arise;* and yet the Chaldean had long ago arisen, and was
now verging under Belshazzar to its fall. But it was proposed by the
angel to teach the Prophet and all the people that there was no reason
why revolutions should disturb them too much. The Israelites then saw
themselves lying as if dead, yea, actually buried and concealed under
the earth. For exile was to them equivalent to the tomb. For this
reason, then, the angel announces *the springing up of four kingdoms,*
while the first was then flourishing; but, as I have already said., this
suits very well within the scope and object of the prophecy. He had
formerly said *from the sea,* but the word “sea” is used metaphorically,
since the condition of the earth was turbulent through many ages. As,
therefore, nothing was stable, God appropriately set forth the whole
world under the figure of the sea. He afterwards adds, *They will obtain
the kingdom of the holy lofty ones* Here interpreters vary considerably,
because, as I have before explained it, some take this prophecy to
relate to the kingdom of Turkey, others to the tyranny of the Pope of
Rome, and extend what the Prophet here says to the final judgment. There
is nothing surprising, then, in this diversity of opinion shewing itself
more fully in the various details. By *sacred holy ones* some understand
angels; but there is still much controversy about the words, for the
noun *of saints* is “in regimen,” as if the Prophet, had said saints of
lofty ones, properly speaking.  <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md)
Similar passages justify those who take it “in the absolute state.” But
if we follow the grammatical construction, we cannot explain it
otherwise; but the former noun may be put in a state of regimen, as we
have said. And I embrace this opinion. Some refer it to the one God,
but. I think this a profane way of expression. I have no doubt about the
Prophet meaning sons of God by *sacred lofty ones,* because, though they
are pilgrims in the world: yet they raise their minds upwards, and know
themselves to be citizens of the heavenly kingdom. Hence by the word
<span id="ii.xxiii-p9.3"></span>ןינוילע, *gnelionin*, “lofty ones,” I
have no doubt; the Prophet means heavenly powers; that is, whatever we
can conceive of divinity, and whatever is exalted above the world. I
will1 now give my reasons shortly why I like this sense the best.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p10"></span>If we call the *holy lofty ones* God
himself, what sense can we elicit from the passage? Did the Chaldeans
and the rest of the monarchies usurp and transfer to themselves the
power of God? There, is some truth in this, because all who domineer
without submitting to the one God despoil him of his peculiar honor, and
are rather robbers than kings. But the Prophet, in my opinion,
understood something else from the angel, namely, that the Church should
lose all form and dignity in the world during the flourishing of these
four monarchies. We know the sons of God to be heirs of the world; and
Paul, when speaking of the promise given to Abraham, says, he was chosen
by God as heir of the world. (<span id="ii.xxiii-p10.1"></span>[Ro
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013.md)<span id="ii.xxiii-p10.1"></span>;
<span id="ii.xxiii-p10.2"></span>[Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002)<span id="ii.xxiii-p10.2"></span>.md)
And this doctrine is sufficiently known — the world was created for the
sake of the human race. When Adam fell from his lawful rights, all his
posterity became aliens. God deprived them of the inheritance which he
had designed for them. Now, therefore, our inheritance must be restored
through Christ, for which reason he is called the only heir of the
world. Thus it is not surprising if the angel says that tyrants, when
they exercise supreme dominion, assume and arrogate to themselves the
peculiar property of the sacred lofty ones, meaning the people of God.
And this suits very well with the assertions of the present passage
concerning the Church being deprived of its dignity, eminence, and
visibility in the world. For then God’s people were like a putrid
carcass, the limbs of which were separated and dispersed on all sides,
without any hope of restoration. Lastly, although by the permission of
Darius, and the edict and liberality of Cyrus, some portion of them
returned to their country, yet what was that nominal return? They had
but a precarious dwelling in the inheritance divinely promised them;
they were pressed on all sides by their enemies, and were subject to the
lust and injustice of them all. For the Church had no empire under the
Persians. After the third change we know how miserably they were
afflicted, especially under Antiochus. That nation was always opposed to
them, but then they were almost reduced to extremities, when Antiochus
endeavored furiously to abolish the whole law and worship of God. Under
the Macedonian kingdom the Jews were in constant slavery; but when the
Roman army penetrated those regions, they felt the horrible tyranny of
the fourth beast, as we have already seen. Lastly, it is sufficiently
evident from the continual history of those times, that the sons of God
were always under the yoke, and were not only cruelly but ignominiously
treated.

<span id="ii.xxiii-p11"></span><span id="ii.xxiii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p12"></span>Thus this prophecy was fulfilled, namely,
*The four beasts took upon themselves the empire which properly belonged
to the sacred lofty ones;* that is, to God’s elect sons, who, though
dwellers on earth, are dependent on heaven. In this interpretation I see
nothing forced, and whoever prudently weighs the matter will, as I hope,
recognize what I have said as the meaning of the Prophet. The latter
clause now follows. *They shall obtain the kingdom,* says he, *for ever,
and even for ever and ever* A difficult question arises here, because by
these words Daniel, or the angel addressing him, seems to express a
perpetual condition under these four monarchies;. Belshazzar was the
last king of the Babylonian dynasty, and at the perform of this vision
the overthrow of that monarchy was at hand. With regard to the Persian
kings, there were only eight of them besides Cyrus. And concerning
Alexander we know a sudden change happened; the terror of him spread
abroad like a storm, but it vanished away after it had affected all the
people of the East. The Macedonian kingdom also suffered a concussion,
when those leaders began to disagree among themselves who had obtained
from Alexander authority and rank; and at length the kingdom became
fourfold, as we have already stated, and shall mention again. Now if we
count the years, the length of those monarchies was not so great as to
justify the epithet “perpetual.” I reply, this must be referred to the
sensations of the pious, to whom that delay seemed specially tedious, so
that they would have pined away in their miseries, had not this prophecy
in some way relieved them. We see at the present moment how great is the
for your of desire when reference is made to the help of God; and when
our minds have been heated with desire, they immediately decline to
impatience. It thus happens that the promises of God do not suffice to
sustain us, because nothing is more difficult than to bear long delay.
For if the Church in our time had been oppressed for a hundred years,
what constancy would have been discerned ht us? If a whirlwind arises,
we are astonished, and cry out, “What next? what next?” Three or four
months will not have elapsed before all men enter upon a strife with God
and expostulate with him, because he does not hasten at once to bring
assistance to his Church. We are not surprised, then, at the angel here
assigning one age, or even an “age of ages,” to tyrants under whom the
Church should be oppressed. Although I do not doubt the reference to the
fullness of times, as we: know Christ to have been the end of the Law,
and as his advent drew nearer, so God admonished the faithful to carry
forward their own expectations to the advent of their Redeemer. When,
therefore, the angel uses the phrase *one age and an age of ages*, I
have no doubt that he defined the time for the elect, to strengthen them
in patiently bearing trouble of all kinds, as this had been divinely
decreed; for the four beasts were to reign not only for a few years, but
for continual ages; that is, until the time of renovation had arrived
for the world, when God completely restored his Church. Let us proceed:
—

<span id="ii.xxiv"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiv-p1"></span><span id="ii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:19-20](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#019.md)<span id="ii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiv-p2"></span>**19.** Then I would know the truth of the
fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful,
whose teeth *were of* iron, and his nails *of* brass; *which* devoured,
brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;

<span id="ii.xxiv-p3"></span>**19.** Tunc aptavi ad veritam  <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) de bestia quarta, quae erat diversa ab
omnibus aliis, terribilis valde, cujus dentes erant ferri, ferrei, et
ungues aeris, aerei, comedens et conterens, et residuu pedibus suis
conculcans.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p5"></span>**20.** And of the ten horns that *were* in
his head, and *of* the other which came up, and before whom three fell;
even *of* that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great
things, whose look *was* more stout than his fellows.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p6"></span>**20.** Et super conrnibus decem, de
cornibus decem, quae erant in capite ejus, et de postremo quod surgebat,
et quod ceciderant ex prioribus tria: et quod cornu illi erant oculi, et
os loquens grandia: et aspectus ejus magna prae sociis.  <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md)

<span id="ii.xxiv-p8"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxiv-p9"></span><span id="ii.xxiv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiv-p10"></span>Here the Prophet interrogates the angel
concerning the Fourth Beast more attentively and carefully; as we
formerly saw him touched with greater admiration on beholding the beast
which was formidable beyond the other three, so that neither a name nor
representation could be found for it. As, therefore, God displayed
something great under the image of the fourth beast, he caused his
Prophet to wake up to understand the mystery of it. For this reason he
now interrogates the angel; for he says *he wished for the truth*
concerning the fourth beast, and he also repeats what we saw before,
namely, *its being different from the others* And surely the subjugation
of so many kings by the Romans was a difference worthy of notice. Let us
think upon the origin of that nation; — a few robbers seizing upon a
desert spot, growing great by brutal audacity and force, until they
reduced all their neighbors under their power. Then they crossed the
sea, and added first one province, and then another to their sway. And
when the kingdom of Macedon came within their power, this was indeed
portentous. At length they became masters throughout the whole circuit
of the Mediterranean, and there was no corner which did not receive
their yoke; and this could never have been imagined by human
apprehension.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p11"></span>It is said then, *this beast was different
from the others, and very terrible.* In the same sense *its teeth* are
called *iron,* and *its claws brazen*. No mention had hitherto been made
of his claw; the Prophet had spoken only of iron teeth, but he now adds
*brazen claws,* as if he had said, This beast shall be endued with such
savage madness, as not only to attack all things by its unusual
violence, but to tear, lacerate, and devour all things; as he repeats
again what he had said, *eating and destroying and treading under foot
the remainder* As. I have already explained all these points, I am
unwilling to consume your time in vain and to confuse you with useless
repetitions. I *asked also*, said he*, concerning the ten horns, which,
were upon its head* And this is the reason why I must cut the subject
off shortly here, as the angel’s reply will follow directly. The
Prophet, therefore, is now, without doubt, placed under a celestial
impulse, because God was unwilling to teach him only as a private
person; he was. to be a witness and herald of so great a mystery; and we
may at this day learn from his writings, which are of the utmost use to
us when we become fully acquainted with them.

<span id="ii.xxiv-p12"></span><span id="ii.xxiv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiv-p13"></span>He says, therefore, *He also inquired
about the ten horns which were on the head of the beast, and of the
other horn which had arisen,* meaning the small one, *and concerning the
three horns falling from the face of the beast.* We have shewn how
provinces were denoted by the tell horns, and how the difference between
the Roman Empire and other monarchies was pointed out, because there
never was one supreme ruler at Rome, except when Syria and Marius
exercised their usurped authority — but each for only a short time. Here
then the continual state of the Roman Empire is under review, for it was
not simply a single animal, as it had ten horns. A finite number is put
for an indefinite one. With regard to the little horn, I said it
referred to the Caesars, who attracted the whole government of the state
to themselves, after depriving the people of their liberty and the
senate of their power, while even under their sway some dignity was
continued to the senate and some majesty retained by the people. We have
explained also how the three horns were broken; that is, how craftily
the Caesars infringed upon and diminished the strength of both people
and senate. Lastly, we have accounted for this little horn being
displayed with human eyes, since the Caesars exercised their dominion
with cunning, when they pretended to be only tribunes of the people, and
allowed the ensigns of empire to remain in the hands of the consuls; for
when they came into the senate, they sat in a lowly situation in curule
scats prepared for the tribunes. As, therefore, they tyrannized with
such cleverness and cunning, instead of by open violence, they are said
to be endowed with the eyes of a man. Then as to the tongue, the sense
is the same; for although they always professed the consular power to be
supreme in the state, yet they could not restrain themselves, but
vomited forth many reproachful speeches. On the one side, we see them
remarkable for eyes, and on the other, for the tongue. *And its aspect
was terrible beyond its companions* This seems not to belong peculiarly
to the little horn which had arisen among the ten, but rather to the
fourth beast. But if any one wishes to understand it of the little horn,
I will not contest the point, as it will thus make tolerable sense. But
I rather embrace my former opinion, for it is not surprising to find the
Prophet after his discourse on the little horn, returning to the beast
himself.

<span id="ii.xxv-p2"></span>**21.** I beheld, and the same horn made war
with the saints, and prevailed against them;

<span id="ii.xxv-p6"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxv-p7"></span><span id="ii.xxv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxv-p8"></span>The Prophet now adds what he had omitted.
The angel does not yet answer him, but as he had not sufficiently
expressed how the little horn waged war with the sons of God, he now
supplies the omission. He says, therefore, *he saw* — this ought to be
received by way of correction; *I saw,* says he, meaning it was shewn me
in a vision, how the little horn *made war with the saints so as to
prevail against them*. Clearly enough other tyrants assailed the elect
people of God with tier greater injury. Hence many refer this to
Antiochus Epiphanes, who was hostile to the Jews beyond all others, and
was utterly determined to blot out the name of the God of Israel. And we
know how often he raised powerful armaments to extinguish both the
people and the worship of God. As, therefore, the cruelty of Antiochus
was so severe against the Israelites, many think his image to have been
exhibited to the Prophet as the little horn, and what we shall
afterwards see about “the time,” and “times’ and “half-a-time,” they
explain of the three years and a half during which the Temple was in
ruins, and the people thereby prevented from offering sacrifices. As,
therefore, their religion was then interrupted, they think that tyranny
was denoted, by which the people were prohibited from testifying their
piety. But although this opinion is plausible, and at first sight bears
upon the face of it the appearance of truth, yet if we weigh all things
in order, we may easily judge how unsuitable it is to Antiochus. Why,
therefore, does the Prophet say — *the little horn waged war with the
saint?* Antiochus certainly made war against the Church, and so did many
others; the Egyptians, we know, often broke in and spoiled the Temple
and the Romans too, before the monarchy of the Caesars. I reply, this is
spoken comparatively, because no war was ever carried on so continuously
and professedly against the Church, as those which occurred after the
Caesars arose, and after Christ was made manifest to the world; for the
devil was then more enraged, and God also relaxed the reins to prove the
patience of his people. Lastly, it was natural for the bitterest
conflicts to occur when the redemption of the world was carried out; and
the event clearly showed this. We know first of all, by horrid examples,
how Judea was laid waste, for never was such cruelty practiced against
any other people. Nor was the calamity of short duration; we are well
acquainted with their extreme obstinacy, which compelled their enemies
to forget clemency altogether. For the Romans desired to spare them as
far as possible, but so great was their obstinacy and the madness of
their rage, that they provoked their enemies as if devoting themselves
to destruction, until that dreadful slaughter happened, of which history
has sufficiently informed us. When Titus, under the auspices of his
father Vespasian, tools: and destroyed the city, the Jews were stabbed
and slaughtered like cattle throughout the whole extent of Asia. Thus
far, then, it concerns the Jews.

<span id="ii.xxv-p9"></span>When God had inserted the body of the
Gentiles into his Church, the cruelty of the Caesars embraced all
Christians; thus the little horn waged war with the saints in a manner
different from that of the former beasts, because the occasion was
different, and the wrath of Satan was excited against all God’s children
on account of the manifestation of Christ. This, then, is the best
explanation of *the little horn, waging war against the saints.* Thus he
says, *It must prevail.* For the Caesars and all who governed the
provinces of the empire raged with such extreme violence against the
Church, that it almost disappeared from the face of the earth. And thus
it happened, that the little horn prevailed in appearance and in general
opinion, as, for a short time, the safety of the Church was almost
despaired of.

<span id="ii.xxv-p10"></span><span id="ii.xxv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxv-p11"></span>It now follows, *Until the Ancient of days
came, judgment was given to the saints of the lofty ones* No doubt the
Prophet says God came in the same sense as before; namely, when he
erected his tribunal and openly appeared as the judge of the world in
the person of Christ. He does not here set before us the Son of man, as
he did before, but yet a fuller explanation of this passage is to be
sought in the former one. *God* then is said *to have come*, when he put
forth his power in supplying the needs of the Church, as by common
figure he is said to be at a distance from us, and to sleep or to be
reposing, when he does not show himself openly as our deliverer. So, on
the other hand, he is said to come to us, when he openly proves his
constant care of us. Under this figure Daniel now says he beheld the
appearance of God Himself*. The Ancient of days* then *came*. If we ask
when, we have the reply at hand; it was immediately after the
promulgation of the gospel. Then God stretched forth his hand for his
Church, and lifted it out of the abyss. For since the Jewish name had
been for a long’ time hated, and all people desired to exterminate the
Jews from the world, Christ’s advent increased this hatred and cruelty;
and the license to injure them was added, as they thought Christ’s
disciples were plotting a change of government, and wished to overthrow
the existing state of things; as in these days all the pious suffer
grievously under this false imputation. God, therefore, is said to have
come, where the doctrine of the gospel was more and more promulgated,
and some rest granted to the Church. Thus, by this repose, *the saints
received the kingdom* which had been taken from them; that is, the
kingdom of God and of the saints obtained some fame and celebrity in the
world, through the general diffusion of the doctrine of piety, in every
direction. Now, therefore, we understand what Daniel wished to convey by
the phrase, *The Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the
saints of the lofty ones* The remainder tomorrow.

<span id="ii.xxvi"></span>

<span id="ii.xxvi-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="ii.xxvi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since thou profest our
faith and constancy by many trials, as it is our duty in this respect
and in all others, to submit to thy will: Grant, I pray, that we may not
give way to the many attacks by which we are tossed about. For we are
assailed on all sides by Satan and all the impious, and while their fury
is ever burning and raging cruelly against us, may we never yield to it.
May we proceed in our warfare, in reliance on the unconquered might of
the Spirit, even though impious men prevail for a season. May we look
forward to the advent of thy only-begotten Son, not only when he shall
appear at the last day, but also whenever it shall please time for him
to assist thy Church, and to raise it out of its miserable afflictions.
And even if we must endure our distresses, may our courage never fail
us, until at length we are gathered into that holy rest, which has been
obtained for us through the blood of the same, thine only-begotten Son —
Amen.

<span id="ii.xxvii"></span>

<span id="ii.xxvii-p1"></span>Lecture Thirty-Seventh.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p2"></span>We, yesterday began to explain how
*judgment was given to the saints* at the commencement of the gospel
era. For we know how very partial even in those times was the Church’s
tranquillity’. Because when it was free from external persecution and
the shedding of blood, domestic enemies arose who proved far more
injurious. Thus the kingdom of Christ never flourished in the world, so
as to have anything in common with those empires, in which great
splendor and pomp were apparent. But; God wished to propose this solace
to his Prophet, by showing him the future reputation of the Church and
its elevation to some degree of honor after emerging from obscurity, so
that the elect dared openly to give homage to Christ, and to profess
true and sincere piety. Hence by judgment being given to the saints, the
Prophet in cans the restoration of the right of which they had been
deprived, and their obtaining the kingdom at the same time, as the
Church no longer lay prostrate as before the advent of Christ. For the
promulgation of the gospel was at length free, as we shall immediately
see. Let us proceed to the context, —

<span id="ii.xxviii"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p1"></span><span id="ii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#023.md)<span id="ii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p2"></span>**23.** Thus he said, The fourth beast
shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all
kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and
break it in pieces.

id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) et tres Reges affliget.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p12"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxviii-p13"></span><span id="ii.xxviii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p14"></span>This reply of the angel is subject to
the same obscurity as the vision itself, but it ought to be sufficient
to calm the minds of the faithful to know that various changes should
arise and shake the whole earth; for as many troubles were, prepared for
the saints, so also they were braced up to fortitude and endurance. For
God was not willing fully to explain what he had shown to his Prophet;
he only wished to set before him this conclusion — a kingdom shall arise
completely different from all others. Thus the angel says, The Fourth
Beast *signifies a fourth kingdom, which shall differ from all the
kingdoms* Previously to that period, no state was so extensive in its
sway. For although the Spartans and Athenians performed illustrious and
memorable exploits, yet we know them to have been included within narrow
boundaries; and the ambition and wordy vanity of the Greeks caused them
to celebrate those wars which were scarcely of any consequence, as we
learn even from their own histories. Whichever way we take this, Sparta
obtained with difficulty the second rank in Greece, as Athens did the
first. As far as concerns the Roman Empire, we know it to have been more
extensive and powerful than the other monarchies. When all Italy came
under their sway, this was sufficient for any noble monarchy; but Spain,
Sicily, part, of Greece, arm Illyrieum were added, and afterwards all
Greece and Macedon, Asia Minor, Africa., and all the islands; for by one
word they expelled the king of Cyprus, and sold his goods by public
auction. When the dregs of the people were collected, Claudius made a
law for the banishment of the king of Cyprus, and this he accomplished
by his single voice, without the use of force at all. No wonder then
that God foretold *how different this kingdom, should be from all the
others;* it had no single head; the senate had the chief authority,
though all power was centered in the people. There was therefore a kind
of mingled confusion, since the government of Rome was never settled.
And if we weigh all things prudently, it was neither a republic nor a
kingdom, but a confused compound, in which the people exercised great
power in a tumultuous way, and the senate oppressed the people as much
as it could. There were three ranks — the senatorian, the equestrian,
and the plebeian, and that mixture made the kingdom like a monster. The
angel, therefore, announces *the fourth kingdom as different from, the
others*

<span id="ii.xxviii-p15"></span>He afterwards confirms what we said
before; *it will fall*, says he, *and break to pieces, and tread down
the whole earth* This was fulfilled after Gaul and Britain were subdued,
Germany partially subjugated, and Illyrieum, Greece, and Macedon,
reduced to submission. At length they penetrated to Asia, and Antiochus
was banished beyond the Taurus; his kingdom afterwards became their
prey, then they obtained possession of Syria. The kings of Egypt were
their allies, and yet became dependent upon their nod; the sovereign
dared not appoint an heir, without consulting their pleasure. As,
therefore, they ruled supremely so long and so widely, they fulfilled
this prophecy by *devouring the whole earth.* For such lust for dominion
never existed before; wars were heaped upon wars, they were alike greedy
of the blood of others, and by no means sparing of their own. The
whirlpool was insatiable, while it absorbed the whole world, and their
pride crushed it and trampled it under foot,. Cruelty was added to
pride, for all looked up to the Romans, and conciliated the favor of
Rome by flattery, for the purpose of raging savagely against; their own
people. By these arts almost the whole of Greece perished. For they knew
how many innocent persons everywhere perished in every city, a kind of
diversion which delighted them; they were fully aware how easy it was to
attract all the power of the whole world to themselves, when it was able
to put forth neither strength, nor skill, nor power against them. For
their nobles were constantly at variance; sometimes one faction and
sometimes another was supreme, and thus the splendor of every city
easily, and gradually diminished. Thus all Greece was spoiled, and the
Romans exercised their dominion there without difficulty, as over brute
beasts. We may say the same of Asia also. We are not surprised then at
the angel saying, *the earth would be trodden down and trampled on by
this fourth beast.*

<span id="ii.xxviii-p16"></span><span id="ii.xxviii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p17"></span>He afterwards adds, *The ten horns are
the ten kings which should arise* These Ten Kings are clearly
comprehended under one empire, and there is no question here of separate
persons. In the Persian kingdom, we observed many kings, and yet the
image of the second beast was single, while it embraced all those kings
until the change occurred. So also no when treating of the Romans, the
Prophet does not assert that ten kings should succeed each other in
regular order, but rather the multiform nature of the kingdom, under
more heads than one. For the royal office belonged to the senators or
leading citizens, whose authority prevailed very extensively both with
the senate and the people. And with reference to the number, we said the
plural number only was denoted, without any limitation to the number
ten. The conclusion is as follows, — this kingdom should be like a
single terrible animal bearing many horns, since no single king held the
chief sway there, as was customary by constant usage in other lands, but
there should be a mixture, like many kings in place of one holding the
pre-eminence. The fulfillment of this is sufficiently known from the
history of Rome; as if it had been said, there should not be any single
kingdom, as of Persia and other nations, but many kings at the same
time, alluding to the mixture and confusion in which the supreme
authority was involved.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p18"></span>The Little Horn follows: *A king shall
arise,* says he, *different from those, other ones, and shall afflict
three kings* We showed how unintelligible this becomes, unless we refer
it to the Caesars to whom the monarchy passed; for after long and
continued and intensive strife, the whole power passed over to the
Triumvirate. A conspiracy was entered into by Lepidus, Mark Antony, and
Octavius. Octavius was then all but a boy, having scarcely arrived at
manhood, but all the veteran soldiers were in his favor, in consequence
of the name of Julius Caesar and his adoption by him. Hence he was
received by the other two into that alliance, of which Lepidus was the
first, and Antony the second. At length discords arose among them, and
Lepidus was deprived of his place in the triumvirate, and lived, as if
half-dead, while his life was only spared to him because he was raised
to the office of chief priest

<span id="ii.xxviii-p19"></span>Reverence for the priesthood restrained
Antony from putting him to death, so long as he was content to live in
privacy and retirement. Octavius at, length became supreme, but by what
artifice? We said Julius Caesar took no more upon himself than the
office of dictator, while consuls were annually elected as usual. He did
not strain the power of the dictatorship beyond moderation, but he so
restrained himself, that some popular rights might seem still to
flourish. Octavius also followed the cunning of his uncle and adopted
father. The same conduct will be found in the other Caesars, though
there were many differences between them. As the shadow of a republic
yet remained, while the senate was held in some degree of reverence, it
is not surprising, if the angel predicts that the beast should survive,
*when another small horn should arise different from the others*

<span id="ii.xxviii-p20"></span>He adds, *And shall afflict the three
kings* I have explained this point by the slight change which the
Caesars effected in the provinces, for if any of the provinces were
warlike, strong armies and veteran soldiers were usually sent there. The
Caesars took these to themselves, while some executive management was
left to the senate with regard to the other provinces. Lastly, by this
form of speech, the angel portrays the coming dominion of the little
horn, and its diminishing the strength of the former ones’ and. yet the
beast should remain apparently entire; thus, the effigy of the republic
was preserved, as the people were always designated — in the forum, by
the high-sounding name, Romans, and in battle, as fellow-soldiers.
Meanwhile, although the name of the Roman empire was so celebrated, and
its majesty was in every one’s mouth, the supreme authority was in the
possession of one little horn which lay concealed, and dared not openly
raise its head. This, then, is the pith of the interpretation of what
the angel here sets before us. It; follows, —

<span id="ii.xxix"></span>

<span id="ii.xxix-p1"></span><span id="ii.xxix-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#025.md)<span id="ii.xxix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxix-p2"></span>**25.** And he shall speak *great* words
against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High,
and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his
hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.

ejus usque ad tempus, et tempora, et divisionem temporis.

<span id="ii.xxix-p6"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxix-p7"></span><span id="ii.xxix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxix-p8"></span>The angel now explains a little more
clearly what the Prophet had formerly touched upon but briefly, namely,
this last king should be a manifest and professed enemy to the Church.
We yesterday showed how miserably and cruelly the Church had been
harassed by many tyrants. And if we compare these tyrants with each
other, we shall find the Church to have been much more heavily afflicted
after Christ’s advent, and to have been opposed by the Caesars in open
warfare. The occasion arose in this way. The doctrine of the Gospel had
been dispersed through almost all the provinces of the empire. The
Jewish name was hateful; and the novelty of the teaching added greatly
to that unpopularity. Men thought the Jews had invented a new deity for
themselves — even Christ;, as their language seemed to imply the worship
of a new divinity. As, therefore, some material for rage against the
pure worship of God was afforded them, the Caesars became more and more
stirred up to carry on war against the elect, and to oppress the Church.
It was not their fault if they did nor; extinguish the whole light of
the celestial doctrine, abolish true religion, and banish: the knowledge
of God from the world. This agrees very well with what Daniel relates of
this king becoming so headstrong, as to *utter words against the most
High God.* Some translate it, *on the part of the most High*, but I know
no reason for their doing so. <span id="ii.xxix-p8.1"></span>דצל,
*letzed,* signifies on the side or the region. The equivalent phrase is
this; so great should be the pride of this new king, who did not
exercise his power openly but by hidden deceit, that he should sit as it
were on the side of God and in opposition to him. This means he should
be manifestly God’s enemy. Those who understand this of Antichrist,
think their opinion confirmed by the conduct of other tyrants who
carried on their warfare against God with arms and violence, but not by
words. But the Prophet does not speak so subtlety here. For by *words*
he does not here mean doctrine, but that verbal boasting by which the
Caesars dared to promulgate their edicts throughout the whole world,
urging all the proconsuls to punish the Christians, and not to permit
that impious and cursed sect to flourish; and thus terrors flew about
throughout the whole world. What Daniel now relates was then fulfilled,
namely, *the utterance of words of defiance against God;* for those
tyrants thought their own edicts, without the armament of soldiers,
would be sufficient to extinguish the memory of Christ. Thus, also, true
piety was disgracefully traduced, and the very name of Christ lacerated
by horrible reproaches, as historians have amply informed us.

<span id="ii.xxix-p9"></span>This explanation, therefore, is most
suitable *to the little horn speaking* or uttering *words against the
most High. He shall afflict, says he, the saints of the lofty ones* We
have already briefly explained the meaning of this expression, according
to its grammatical construction. By saints he doubtless means sons of
God, or his elect people, or the Church. He calls these “saints of lofty
ones,” because as elect they depend upon heaven; and although they are
pilgrims in the world, yet their life is in heaven, where the eternal
inheritance remains for them which was obtained by Christ. As,
therefore, their treasure is now heaven, they deservedly boast of being
citizens of heaven, and allies and brethren of angels. Thus they are
properly called “saints of lofty ones;” they are separated from the
world, and know themselves to live here day by day until they arrive at
firm and enduring repose. We know this to have been fulfilled, because
overwhelming terror fell upon all the pious, and the Church almost
perished, while multitudes who were suspected of being Christians were
subjected to cruel tortures. The prevalence of this universal license
for persecuting all the pious explains how the saints were then
afflicted by the small horn.

<span id="ii.xxix-p10"></span>The Prophet or rather the angel next says,
*He will think,* or meditate*, to change time and law, and they shall be
delivered into his hand.* As to the time here spoken of, many refer it
to holy days. But we may understand it generally of the small horn
overthrowing whatever was formerly customary in the world; and thus also
I interpret the word <span id="ii.xxix-p10.1"></span>תר, *reth*, not the
Law of God or the Gospel, but any rites, customs, and institutions.
While interpreters are contending about this word, some referring it to
the Decalogue, and others to the preaching of the Gospel, I think the
simple sense of the Prophet to be this: the Caesars perverted all laws,
both human and divine. We have seen how they attempted this, and how far
they accomplished it. It is not surprising then if the Prophet; assigns
this unbridled audacity to this last king, *who thought to change
whatever had been formerly ordained in the world.* And for this reason
it had been formerly said this horn should be furnished with human eyes;
and next, should speak mightily, thundering horribly, and inspiring all
men with fear through its voice alone. We know this to have been
represented as in a glass, if we consider how far the Caesars proceeded
in their arrogance. First, as to Octavius, while he restrained himself
within due bounds politically, he suffered himself to be adored as a
god, and altars to be erected to him; he wished the public to be
persuaded of his deity, and celebrated a banquet in which he sat among
the superior deities. Tiberius neglected religious ceremonies entirely,
and yet we see how he despised all men. Although he was of an obtuse
disposition, in his daring he was extreme, and was all the while
craftily deceiving the senate. Next, as to Caligula, he threatened
Jupiter in this way, — “What! thou art an exile here and I a native: I
will banish thee into Greece thy native place.” He often inflicted blows
upon the statue of Jupiter, and not content with the name of a god, he
ordered the chief sacrifices to be offered to himself. This diabolic
fury increased in Domitian. And considering the Caesars as men, what was
their character? One of them said, “I wish the Roman people had but one
need.” He enjoyed the slaughter of the senate as a sport, and wished to
make his horse a consul. How disgraceful was such conduct! We see, then,
how this prediction was not uttered without a cause; namely, so great
should be the arrogance of the small horn that it would dare to change
and turn into a new almost all “law,” meaning all order of every kind,
and “times,” meaning the very series and nature of all things. The
Prophet then says *he thought* He does not express the result, but
simply signifies the arrival of the small horn at such a degree of
madness as to suppose it could draw down the sun from heaven, turn
light: into darkness, and leave nothing entire, nothing in order,
throughout, the world. Those occurrences really happened in accordance
with this prophecy. I cannot enter into details here. I should have to
detain you many days or even months while citing history; I can only
touch shortly upon what: is necessary for explaining the Prophet’s words
and the meaning of his prediction.

<span id="ii.xxix-p11"></span>*They shall be delivered into his hands*
means, — however the small horn should leap forward in desperate fury,
yet: God should always rule over him, and nothing should happen without
his permission,. It was God then who delivered into the hands of that
identifying the saints, the political government, and the institutions
of piety, allowing him to pour out promiscuously human blood, to violate
every national right, and to ruin as far as possible all religion. It
brings us then no little comfort to know when God’s permission is given
to tyrants to harass the Church and interfere with His lawful worship;
for if we were left to the mercy of their lusts, how distressing would
be the universal confusion! But he succors us, as the angel says, when
tyrants assail us and disturb all order by their horrible licentiousness
and cruel rage against the miserable and the innocent: he succors us, I
say, so that they are unable to move to finger against us without God’s
permission. We are not permitted to know why God relaxes the rein in
favor of the enemies of his Church; perhaps it is to prove and try the
patience of his people. It is sufficient for us, if, when tyrants scheme
and plot in every way, they are unable to do anything without the divine
permission.

<span id="ii.xxix-p12"></span>But a greater consolation is added in the
last clause, *even for a time and times, and the division of a time,* or
half, as some translate it; it is properly a division. Interpreters
differ widely about these words, and I will not bring forward all their
opinions, otherwise it would be necessary to refute them. I should have
no little trouble in refuting all their views, but I will follow my own
custom of shortly expressing the genuine sense of the Prophet, and thus
all difficulty will be removed. Those who consider a “time” to mean a
“year,” are in my opinion wrong. They cite the forty-two months of the
Apocalypse, (<span id="ii.xxix-p12.1"></span>[Re
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rev013.htm#005)<span id="ii.xxix-p12.1"></span>,.md)
which make three years and a half; but that argument is not conclusive,
since in that case a year will not consist of 365 days, but the year
itself must be taken figuratively for any indeterminate time. It is
better then to keep close to the Prophet’s words. A “time,” then, is not
put for a certain number of months or days, nor yet for a single year,
but for any period whose termination is in the secret counsel of God.
*They shall be given,* then, *for a time*, says he, and afterwards adds
*times*; that is, for a continuance of times; and again, *even to a
section* or division of a *time;* meaning, these calamities should come
to an end whenever God, in mercy to his Church, should restrain those
tyrants by his wrath against them. As long, therefore, as the cruelty of
the Caesars oppressed God’s Church, it was committed into their hands.
We have already seen how many Caesars were enemies of the true Church.
First, of all, Nero raged most cruelly, for he burnt some thousands of
Christians at Rome, to extinguish the infamy which raged against
himself. The people could not endure his barbarity; for, while the
fourth part of the city was destroyed by Nero, he was enjoying his
pleasure and rejoicing so mournful a spectacle! As he feared the popular
tumult against himself, he laid hold of many Christians, and offered
them to the people as a kind of expiation. Those who followed him, did
not cease to pour forth innocent blood, and those who seemed to be
endued with some degree of clemency and humanity were all at length
seized with a diabolic fury. Trajan was esteemed a very excellent
prince, and yet we know how he commanded the Christians everywhere to be
slain, since he thought them obstinate in their error. And *others were
more savage still. No wonder, therefore, the angel predicts, even for a
time, and times, and the division of a time,* that license would be
given to the tyrants and enemies of the Church to pervert all things, to
despise God, and set aside all justice, and to execute a cruel and
barbarous slaughter. This ought to be predicted for two reasons: first,
lest through length of time the faithful should fall away, because when
“the time” — a space of about ten years — had passed, they would come to
*the times,* consisting of about fifty or a hundred years.

<span id="ii.xxix-p13"></span>This, then, was one reason why God
admonished the faithful *concerning the time and times.* But he wished
also to mitigate their sorrow by adding *half a time,* thus promising
some moderation and ending to such great calamities. The language of our
Lord to his Apostles concerning the various commotion of the earth,
corresponds very well with this view. “There shall arise wars and rumors
of wars, and no end as yet,” says he. He announces them as the preludes
to greater evils, when the whole of Judea should be devastated with wars
and other slaughters. He afterwards adds, “Unless those days had been
shortened.” (<span id="ii.xxix-p13.1"></span>[Mt
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#006.md)<span id="ii.xxix-p13.1"></span>;

<span id="ii.xxix-p13.3"></span>[Lu
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#009)<span id="ii.xxix-p13.3"></span>..md)
This shortening of the days is here noticed as if the Lord cut short; a
continued succession of them. For when the possession of the tyranny
appeared fierce, then suddenly and beyond the expectation of all, God at
length snatched away his Church, and then the evangelical doctrine
emerged, and was celebrated everywhere. God, therefore, then shortened
the days on account of his own elect, and this is understood by the last
clause, a division of a time. I will defer the rest till to-morrow.

<span id="ii.xxx-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="ii.xxx-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since we must be daily
exercised by various contests, that we may never yield to the
infirmities of the flesh, and never forget thy Holy calling. Animate us,
we pray thee, for all hostile engagements; may we stand unbroken against
all the assaults of Satan and the wicked; and thus give ourselves up and
devote ourselves to thee. May we never hesitate to suffer death itself,
if necessary, and even to offer ourselves daily to various kinds of
death, until we shall have discharged our warfare, and enjoy that happy
and eternal rest which thou hast prepared for us in thine only-begotten
Son. — Amen.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p1"></span><span id="ii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#026.md)<span id="ii.xxxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxii-p2"></span>**26.** But the judgment shall sit, and
they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy *it* unto
the end.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p3"></span>**26.** Et judicium, sedebit, et potestam
ejus auferent ad dissipandum at perpendum,  <span

<span id="ii.xxxii-p5"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxxii-p6"></span><span id="ii.xxxii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxii-p7"></span>The, angel now answers Daniel concerning
the death of the fourth beast. For we said when the Caesars had
transferred the empire to themselves, the strength of the senate and of
the people was enervated; but because the name still remained, the
fourth beast is not said to have been slain until foreigners
disgracefully became masters of Rome. For if the Romans had been
conquered a hundred times over by professed enemies, they would not have
suffered such disgrace as when obscure and low-born men exercise a cruel
and barbarous tyranny; for then neither the senate nor the people enjoy
any authority. The angel thus marks the time correctly at which the
fourth beast was to fall, when the Spaniards, the Africans, and other
barbarians, who were even always unknown in. their own country, were
raised to the highest honors beyond the expectation of mankind. For
their lust oppressed the whole state; they beheaded the most noble
senators, and appointed in their stead the meanest of men, in token of
their spirit of ignoniny. *Then the fourth beast, was slain;* and this
is the explanation of this portion of the angel’s reply. He says also,
*Judgment shall then sit;* that is, God shall again restore to order all
this confusion, and the world shall feel his Providence ruling over the
earth and the human race. For when all things are allowed to proceed
without punishment, and neither justice nor honesty are held in any
account, God is then supposed to be enjoying his ease in heaven, and to
be forgetful of the human race. Hence, in opposition to this, he is said
to ascend a tribunal as often as we really and experimentally feel his
care over us. Thus the restoration is here called a sitting in judgment,
when the Roman Empire was blotted out, and God executed the penalty of
such great and such unbridled ferocity as that already recorded. As this
phrase is very common and of frequent use in Scripture, I will not
continue the explanation.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p8"></span>*The judgment,* then, *shall be set;* that
is, after all things have been long involved in darkness, new light
shall burst forth, and men shall readily acknowledge the sway of the
Almighty. *And power*, says he, *shall they take away from the beast for
dissipating and destroying even to the end* Here the angel announces the
final overthrow of the fourth beast. Respecting the plural number of the
verb, we have already mentioned the opinion of some who refer it to more
angels than one, but it is better to understand it more simply, as an
absolute and indefinite form of expression. And yet; I do not object, as
I before stated, to the view of those who take it of angels, yet I fear
this is too refined; I prefer the simpler view as being free from all
controversy. The sense, then, is this: When the beast; shall have raged
cruelly for a length of time, and especially the little horn, God shall
discharge the duty of a judge, and the beast, with this small horn,
shall be removed out of the way. The angel adds next, There shall be no
hope of any new life similar to that of many kingdoms which often fall
at one period and rise again at another; but he here announces the final
slaughter, as if he had said, the wound is incurable and deadly. It now
follows: —

<span id="ii.xxxiii"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p1"></span><span id="ii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027.md)<span id="ii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p2"></span>**27.** And the kingdom and dominion, and
the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to
the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom *is* an
everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p3"></span>**27.** Et regnum, et potestas, et
magnitudo regni sub toto coelo dabitur populo sanctorum excelsorum.
Regnum ejus regnum seculi, hoc est, perpetuum, et omnes potestates ei
servient, atque obedient.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p5"></span><span id="ii.xxxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p6"></span>This verse assures us how these
predictions concerning the destruction of the beast regard the Church’s
safety. Thus the faithful might know themselves noticed by God, and how
the changes which successively happened tended to the same end, the
acknowledgment on the part of the pious of their continuance under the
care and guardianship of God. For any discussion of the four monarchies
would have been cold and useless: unless there had been added God’s
peculiar care of his own Church., and his conducting the affairs of the
world for the safety of his people. As we have said in other places,
God’s elect people are of more consequence than all the kingdoms which
are conspicuous in the world. (<span id="ii.xxxiii-p6.1"></span>[Isa
43:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.xxxiii-p6.1"></span>.) This, then, is the sense of the words. If
we separate this verse from its context, the prophecy will still have
its use. We may elicit from it how all things which seem stable in the
world are yet perishable, and nothing is so firm as not to be subject
every moment to constant variation. But the chief intention of this
prediction is, as I have said, to show the relation of all events to the
safety of the pious. When, therefore, all things seem carried away by
the blind impulse of chance, we ought always to contemplate God as
watching for his Church, and tempering all storms and all commotion to
the service and safety of the pious, who rest upon his Providence. These
two things, then, are mutually in accordance, namely, *the slaying of
the fourth beast, and the giving of the kingdom and authority to the
people of the saints* This does not seem to have been accomplished yet;
and hence many, nay, almost all, except the Jews, have treated this
prophecy as relating to the final day of Christ’s advent. All Christian
interpreters agree in this; but, as I have shewn before, they pervert
the Prophet’s intention. As to the Jews, theirs is no explanation at
all, for they are not only foolish and stupid, but even crazy  <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) And since their object is the
adulteration of sound doctrine, God also blinds them till they become
utterly in the dark, and both trifling and childish; and if I were to
stop to refute their crudities, I should never come to an end.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p8"></span>This prophecy does not seem to be
accomplished at the destruction of the beast; but this is easily
explained. We know how magnificently the prophets speak of Christ’s
kingdom, and adore his dignity and glory with splendid eulogies; and
although these are not exaggerated, yet if judged of by human
perceptions, you would surely think them exceedingly extravagant, and
find neither solidity nor firmness in their words. And no wonder: for
Christ’s kingdom and his dignity cannot be perceived by carnal eyes, nor
even comprehended by the human intellect. Let those who appear the most
sagacious of men combine together all their clear-sightedness, yet they
can never ascend to the height of Christ’s kingdom, which surpasses the
very heavens. Nothing is more contrary to our natural judgment than to
seek life in death, riches in poverty and want, glory in shame and
disgrace — to be wanderers in this world, and at the same time its
heirs! Our minds cannot naturally comprehend these things. No wonder,
then, if mortals judge erroneously of Christ’s kingdom, and are blind in
the midst of light. Still there is no defect in the Prophet’s
expressions, for they depict for us the visible image of Christ’s
kingdom, and accommodate themselves to our dullness. They enable us to
perceive the analogy between things earthly and visible, and that
spiritual blessedness which Christ has afforded to us, and which we now
possess through hope in him. For while we only hope, our happiness is
concealed from us; it is not perceptible by our eyes or by any of our
senses.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p9"></span>Let us now return to the passage. Daniel
first of all says, *A kingdom, and power, and extensive dominion, shall
be given to the people of the holy ones.* This was partially fulfilled
when the Gospel emerged from persecution: then the name of Christ was
everywhere celebrated and held in honor and esteem, while previously it
had been the subject of the greatest envy and hatred. For nothing had
been more hated and detested for many years than the name of Christ.
God, therefore, then gave the kingdom to his people, when he was
acknowledged as the Redeemer of the world throughout its many changes,
after having been formerly despised and utterly rejected. I may here
remark again, and impress upon the memory what I have frequently touched
upon, namely, the custom of the Prophets, in treating of Christ’s
kingdom, to extend their meaning further than its first beginnings; and
they do this while they dwell upon its commencement. Thus Daniel or the
angel does not predict here occurrences connected with the advent of
Christ as Judge of the world, but with the first preaching and
promulgation of the Gospel, and the celebration of the name of Christ.
But this does not prevent him from drawing a magnificent picture of
Christ’s reign, and embracing its final completion. It is sufficient for
us to perceive how God begins to give the kingdom to his elect people,
when, by the power of his Spirit, the doctrine of the holy Gospel was
everywhere received in the world. The sudden change which it occasioned
was incredible, but this is a customary result; for, when anything is
predicted, we think it a fable and a dream, and when God performs what
we never would have thought of, the evil, appears to us trifling, and we
treat it as of no moment. For example, when the preaching of the Gospel
commenced, no one would have thought its success could have been so
great and so prosperous; nay, two hundred years before Christ was
manifest, when religion was almost blotted out, and the Jews were
execrated by the whole world, who would have thought the Law would
spring from Zion? Yet God erected his scepter there. The dignity of the
kingdom had vanished: the offspring of David was extinct. For the family
of Jesse was but a trunk, after the simile used by the prophet Isaiah.
(<span id="ii.xxxiii-p9.1"></span>[Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.xxxiii-p9.1"></span>.) If any one had asked all the Jews one
after another, no one would have believed the possibility of those
events which accompanied the preaching of the Gospel; but, at length
the, dignity and virtue of the kingdom of David shone forth in Christ.
Yet it vanishes before our eyes, and we seek new miracles, as if God had
not sufficiently proved himself to have spoken by his prophets! Thus we
observe how the Prophet keeps within bounds when he says, *A kingdom,
and a power, and a magnitude of empire was given to the people of the
saints.*

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p10"></span>He adds, *one empire under the whole
heavens* Here the Rabbi Abarbinel, who thinks himself superior to all
others, rejects our idea of the spiritual reign of Christ as a foolish
imagination. For the kingdom of God, he says, is established under the
whole heavens, and is given to the people of the saints. If it is
established under heaven, says he, it is earthly, and if earthly,
therefore not spiritual. This seems in truth a very subtle argument, as
if God could not reign in the world except as extraordinary mortal. As
often as Scripture says “God reigns,” according to this argument God
must be transfigured into human nature, otherwise there will be no
kingdom of God except it is earthly, and if earthly it is temporal, and
therefore perishable. Hence we must infer that God changes his nature.
His kingdom, then, will consist in opulence, and military power and
parade, and the common luxuries of life, so that God will become unlike
himself. We perceive the puerile trifling of those Rabbis who pretend to
glory in their ingenuity, to the total destruction of the whole teaching
of piety. They intend nothing else than to adulterate the purity of
Scripture by their foul and senseless comments. But we know the reign of
God and of Christ, although existing in the world, not to be of it,
(<span id="ii.xxxiii-p10.1"></span>[Joh
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036.md)<span
id="ii.xxxiii-p10.1"></span>;) the meaning of the two expressions is
exactly the opposite. God, therefore, still exercises his heavenly reign
in the world, because he dwells in the hearts of his people by his
Spirit. While God held his seat at Jerusalem, was his kingdom merely an
earthly and corruptible one? By no means, for by the possession of an
earthly habitation he did not cease to be in heaven also. Thus the angel
instructed the Prophet concerning the saints who are pilgrims in the
world, and yet shall enjoy the kingdom and possess the greatest power
under heaven. Hence also we correctly conclude, that this vision ought
not to be explained of the final advent of Christ, but of the
intermediate state of the Church. The saints began to reign under
heaven, when Christ ushered in his kingdom by the promulgation of his
Gospel.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p11"></span>Another point must be noticed, — what
belongs to the head is transferred to the body. There is nothing new in
this, as the supreme power is constantly promised by the Prophets to the
Church, especially by Isaiah, who often predicts its complete supremacy.
The Papists seize upon such testimonies to clothe themselves in the
spoils of God, as if God had resigned his right to them! But they are
immersed in the same error with the Jews, who swell with pride whenever
such dignity is promised to the elect people, as if they could remain
separate from God and yet obtain the right of treading the whole world
under foot. The Papists also do exactly the same. We, however, must be
guided by a very different rule, namely, in consequence of the intimate
union between Christ and his Church, the peculiar a. tribute of Christ
himself is often transferred to his body. Not that the Church reigns by
itself; but Christ, as its only supreme head, obtains dominion therein,
and not for his own private advantage — for what need has he of this
dominion? but for the common safety of all its members. Wherefore Christ
is our King, and he designs to erect his throne in the midst; of us; he
uses nothing for his own advantage, but communicates all things to us,
and renders them useful to us; hence, we are deservedly called kings,
because he reigns, and as I have already said, language which is
exclusively appropriate to him, is transferred to us in consequence of
the intimate communion existing between the head and the members.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p12"></span>This is also the sense of the phrase
here added by the Prophet, *All powers shall serve and obey it* I have
no doubt the angel here confirmed Isaiah’s prophecy, as the Holy Spirit,
the better to confirm and strengthen the faith of the pious, often
reconciles one Prophet with another, and thus their mutual agreement
becomes the seal of their truth. It is said in Isaiah, The kingdom and
the land which will not serve thee, shall. be destroyed: kings shall
come and adore thee, the people shall offer thee gifts. (<span
id="ii.xxxiii-p12.1"></span>[Isa
60:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.xxxiii-p12.1"></span>.) In the Psalms, it is said,

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p13"></span>“Kings shall assemble together, to serve
God.”  
(<span id="ii.xxxiii-p13.2"></span>[Ps
102:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.xxxiii-p13.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p14"></span>And Isaiah treats very fully on the
empire of the Church. The angel now repeats the same thing, to add, as I
have said, greater confidence and authority to the prophecy of Isaiah.
Meanwhile, we observe how completely all the Prophets agree, and at the
same time we interpret these words of the kingdom of Christ, from the
period at which the teaching of the gospel was rendered remarkably
conspicuous; for then God’s royal scepter went forth from Jerusalem, and
shone far and wide, while the Lord was extending his hand and his
authority over all the regions of the world. As all these important
events tended to the common salvation of the Church, it is said, *The
kingdom shall belong to the holy people*. As to the phrase, *The saints
of the high ones*, I have already explained why the Prophet applies this
phrase to the faithful, and why the angel also does the same; namely,
because God separated them from the world, and they were always looking
upwards and drawing all their hopes from above. Then, as to the Rabbi
whom I cited, he twists this. passage, and tries to show that the
Prophet did not speak of Christ, when he says he saw the figure of the
Son of man. But this is complete trifling, for he asserts the Son of man
to mean “the people of the saints,” and thus the phrase would have no
reference to Christ, but to the whole offspring of Abraham. We must not
be surprised at the shameful ignorance of these Rabbis, and at their
blundering at the very rudiments, since they do not acknowledge the
necessity for a Mediator, through whom alone the Church can obtain any
favor before God. They boast in what we also allow — in the sons of
Abraham being the elect, and in this title as availing to render them a
holy people, and heirs of God, and a kingdom of priests. This is true,
but on what was their covenant of adoption founded but on Christ? Hence
their separating the Church from the Mediator, is like leaving a
mutilated body apart from its disjoined head. Besides, from what the
Prophet stated before about the Son of man, his subject is evidently
changed in this verse. He stated there, power was given to the Son of
man after he had arrived at the Ancient of days, and the Son of man, or
at least his likeness, appeared in the clouds. First of all, we must
notice this likeness, as it were the Son of man, as we have already
explained the vision. Surely Abraham’s posterity were really men, but
the vision offered to the Prophet was but a similitude; as Christ had
not yet put on our flesh, this was only a prelude to his future
manifestation in the flesh. Here he speaks openly and without a figure
of *the people of the saints,* and this prophecy depends upon the former
one. For unless Christ were seated at His Father’s right hand, and had
obtained supreme dominion, causing every knee to bend before him, the
Church could never exercise its power. Thus we observe how all things
mutually agree among each other.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p15"></span>As, however, it is certain that many
have perseveringly rebelled against; God and the teaching of his gospel,
it may seem absurd for the angel to pronounce all the powers of the
world obedient and submissive. But it is worth while to study the
customary methods of scriptural expression. For instance, by the phrase
“all people,” the Spirit does not mean every single person, but simply
some out of every nation who should submit to Christ’s yoke, acknowledge
him to be king, and obediently obey his Church. How often do these
sentiments occur in the prophets? All nations shall come — all kings;
shall serve. At that time no king existed who was not professedly an
enemy of true piety, and who did not desire the abolition of the very
name of his law. The prophets enlarge thus magnificently on the future
restoration of this kingdom, as we have stated before, in consequence of
the event being so utterly incredible. So, also, in this place *all
powers,* says he, *shall serve and obey him;* that is:, no power shall
so boast in its loftiness, as not willingly to become subject to the
Church, although at present all so fully despise it: nay, while they
rage with all their might, against the most wretched Church, and while
they tread it most ignominiously under foot, even then they shall be
subject to it. This we know to have been amply fulfilled. Some persons
foolishly press beyond their meaning words of universal import, as when
Paul says, God wishes all to be saved. Hence, they say, no one is
predetermined for destruction, but all are elect, that is, God is not
God. (<span id="ii.xxxiii-p15.1"></span>[1Ti
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.xxxiii-p15.1"></span>.) But we are not surprised at such madness
as this, corrupting the impious and profane, who desire by their cavils
to promote disbelief in all the oracles of the Spirit. Let us clearly
comprehend the frequency of this figure of speech; when the Holy Spirit
names “all,” he means some out of all nations, and not every one
universally.

<span id="ii.xxxiv"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxiv-p1"></span><span id="ii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
7:28](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#028.md)<span id="ii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxiv-p2"></span>**28.** Hitherto *is* the end of the
matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my
countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

<span id="ii.xxxiv-p3"></span>**28.** Hucusque finis sermonis,  <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) mihi Danieli,  <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) multum cogitationes meae terruerunt me,
et vilgus meus mutatus est super me, vel, in me, et sermonem servavi,
 <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) in corde meo.

<span id="ii.xxxiv-p7"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxxiv-p8"></span><span id="ii.xxxiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxiv-p9"></span>In this verse Daniel first says the vision
was concluded, and thus the faithful might rest satisfied in looking for
nothing beyond it. For we know how restless are the fancies of mankind,
and how insane a disease is a vain curiosity. God is aware of what is
useful for our information, and so he adopts his method of teaching to
our capacity and profit,. Yet we are volatile and insatiable, saying,
Why is not this added? Why does God stop here? why does he not proceed
further? As, therefore, human ingenuity is so inflamed and intemperate,
Daniel here deservedly says, *an end was put to the vision,* to cause
all the elect to acquiesce in it and be contented with this partial
knowledge. He afterwards adds, *he was disturbed in his thoughts, and
his countenance was changed;* for he was afraid lest the pious should
think this vision a mere vanished specter. It was of the greatest
importance to distinguish this vision from any frivolous imagination.
Daniel, therefore, to show how the scene proposed to his notice was a
divine revelation, expresses clearly how *he was terrified in his
thoughts* This occurred, because God wished to stamp upon his heart the
certainty of the prophecy. To the same purpose is, *the change of
countenance* He adds, *he laid up the discourse in his heart,* to assure
us of his being a faithful interpreter; for if we suspected him of
negligence, we should not receive, with reverence the message he
delivered in these words, as really proceeding from God. But when Daniel
affirms that he discharged the duty of a faithful servant, who *kept the
whole discourse in his heart,* additional authority is added to his
teaching. In conclusion, we must remember two points; first, the
celestial revelation made known to the Prophet to prove him a servant
and messenger of God to us; and secondly, the faithful discharge of his
duties, as *he laid up in his heart* what he had received, and thus
delivered it through his own hands to the Church at large. Another
vision follows: —

id="ii.xii-p4.1"></span>וימר, *remiv*, is expounded by interpreters in
two senses; verbally,” until they took away thrones or erected them
aloft.” — *Calvin.* “The word may be rendered ‘were pitched,’ or set
down, for the reception of Deity and his assessors the saints.” —
*Wintle.*

<span id="fn_11"></span>[12](cc25001.htm#fr_11.md) <span
id="ii.xiii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p4"></span> Some, the light or splendor. — *Calvin.*

<span id="fn_12"></span>[13](cc25001.htm#fr_12.md) <span
id="ii.xiii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p5"></span> That is, millions. — *Calvin*.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[14](cc25001.htm#fr_13.md) <span
id="ii.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p6"></span> That is, myriad’s of myriad’s, or a
hundred million. — *Calvin.*

<span id="fn_14"></span>[15](cc25001.htm#fr_14.md) <span
id="ii.xiv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiv-p4"></span> That is, I was gazing upon that vision
still: it signifies the attention of the mind, and that not after a
human method, but as if he had been caught up aloft in a prophetic
spirit. Thus he says his senses were fixed upon that vision — “on
account of the voice,” therefore, or “through the voice.” — *Calvin.*

<span id="fn_15"></span>[16](cc25001.htm#fr_15.md) <span
id="ii.xviii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xviii-p4"></span> For <span id="ii.xviii-p4.1"></span>םע,
gnem, is taken in this passage in Chaldee, like <span
id="ii.xviii-p4.2"></span>ב, be. This usage is customary: hence “in the
clouds.” — *Calvin*

<span id="fn_16"></span>[17](cc25001.htm#fr_16.md) <span
id="ii.xviii-p4.3"></span>

<span id="ii.xviii-p5"></span> Verbally, “made him approach.” —
*Calvin*. The Latin text of 1561 has “eum” at the end of the verse, and
the French translation implies it. See the Dissertations at the end of
this volume. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[18](cc25001.htm#fr_17.md) <span
id="ii.xviii-p8.4"></span>

<span id="ii.xviii-p9"></span> The Latin translation of Irenaeus is
“<span id="ii.xviii-p9.1"></span>*proeludium*.” The French here has
“<span id="ii.xviii-p9.2"></span>*une approche et entree*.” and then
adds, “He uses a word which we cannot translate into French.” It means a
preface or introduction. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_18"></span>[19](cc25001.htm#fr_18.md) <span
id="ii.xviii-p9.3"></span>

<span id="ii.xviii-p10"></span> Tertullian’s words are, “<span
id="ii.xviii-p10.1"></span>Tunc praeluxit Filius Dei humanitate sua.” —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_19"></span>[20](cc25001.htm#fr_19.md) <span
id="ii.xix-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xix-p4"></span> Or, shall not be abolished. — *Calvin*.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[21](cc25001.htm#fr_20.md) <span
id="ii.xx-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p4"></span> Or vanished, or my spirit was wanting to me,
Daniel. — *Calvin.*

<span id="fn_21"></span>[22](cc25001.htm#fr_21.md) <span
id="ii.xx-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p5"></span> Or “sheath,” properly; but here this noun is
transferred metaphorically to the body. — *Calvin.* Aben-Ezra calls the
body “the sheath” of the mind. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_22"></span>[23](cc25001.htm#fr_22.md) <span
id="ii.xxiii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiii-p9"></span> The Latin here refers to the Hebrew
construction. The French translation has expressed Calvin’s meaning
without keeping close to the words. <span id="ii.xxiii-p9.1"></span>*Les
saincts des souverains* is the French reading of the Hebrew regimen. See
Dissertations at the end of this volume. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[24](cc25001.htm#fr_23.md) <span
id="ii.xxiv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiv-p4"></span> This word <span
id="ii.xxiv-p4.1"></span>אבציל, *litzba,* is usually explained to mean
“for the truth,” that is. I desired to know. — *Calvin.* The *Vulgate*
has “<span id="ii.xxiv-p4.2"></span>diligentius discere.” *Wintle*,
“accurate information.”

<span id="fn_24"></span>[25](cc25001.htm#fr_24.md) <span
id="ii.xxiv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxiv-p7"></span> That is, “beyond the other beasts.” —
*Calvin.*

<span id="fn_25"></span>[26](cc25001.htm#fr_25.md) <span
id="ii.xxviii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p4"></span> The expression seems concise, but
because he had formerly added what had been omitted, for the purpose of
connecting the history, he repeats again, “the angel said so,” namely,
“as to that portion of the vision, thus spake the angel.” — *Calvin.*

<span id="fn_26"></span>[27](cc25001.htm#fr_26.md) <span
id="ii.xxviii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p5"></span> Some translate it in the passive, “lest
any change be made.” — *Calvin.*

<span id="fn_27"></span>[28](cc25001.htm#fr_27.md) <span
id="ii.xxviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p6"></span> Some translate, “shall rub to pieces,”
but the sense is the same. — *Calvin.*

<span id="fn_28"></span>[29](cc25001.htm#fr_28.md) <span
id="ii.xxviii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p9"></span> Or, after those horns. — *Calvin.*

<span id="fn_29"></span>[30](cc25001.htm#fr_29.md) <span
id="ii.xxviii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p10"></span> King, or the horn itself, shall be
different. — *Calvin.*

<span id="fn_30"></span>[31](cc25001.htm#fr_30.md) <span
id="ii.xxviii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p11"></span> Which is denoted by the horn. —
*Calvin.*

<span id="fn_31"></span>[32](cc25001.htm#fr_31.md) <span
id="ii.xxix-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxix-p4"></span> Others translate, “shall consume,
afflict.” — *Calvin.*

<span id="fn_32"></span>[33](cc25001.htm#fr_32.md) <span
id="ii.xxix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxix-p5"></span> That is, he shall think with himself to
change. — *Calvin.*

<span id="fn_33"></span>[34](cc25001.htm#fr_33.md) <span
id="ii.xxxii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxii-p4"></span> That is, to dissipate and blot out. —
*Calvin.*

<span id="fn_34"></span>[35](cc25001.htm#fr_34.md) <span
id="ii.xxxiii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p7"></span> Calvin’s expression is here proverbial;
the French translates <span id="ii.xxxiii-p7.1"></span>*ils n*’*en
approachent ne pres ne loin;* the Latin being, <span
id="ii.xxxiii-p7.2"></span>*neque coelum neque terram attingunt*. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_35"></span>[36](cc25001.htm#fr_35.md) <span
id="ii.xxxiv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxiv-p4"></span> Or, as yet there is an end of the
discourse. — *Calvin.*

<span id="fn_36"></span>[37](cc25001.htm#fr_36.md) <span
id="ii.xxxiv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxiv-p5"></span> Or, as far as I, Daniel, am concerned. —
*Calvin.*

<span id="fn_37"></span>[38](cc25001.htm#fr_37.md) <span
id="ii.xxxiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxiv-p6"></span> Or, I have laid it up to be kept. —
*Calvin.*
