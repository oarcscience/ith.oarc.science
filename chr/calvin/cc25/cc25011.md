<span id="xii"></span>

<span id="xii-p1"></span>A LIST OF THE MOST ANCIENT AND MODERN BRITISH
AND FOREIGN EXPOSITIONS OF DANIEL,

<span id="xii-p2"></span>With Concise Epitomes Of The Contents Of The
Most Important.

<span id="xii-p3"></span>1 Jewish Commentators.

<span id="xii-p4"></span>Dr. Kennicott first edited a Hebrew
interpretation of the Chaldee chapters of Daniel and Ezra from an
ancient codex. It was translated and re-edited by J. L. Shulze. Hal.,
1782.

<span id="xii-p5"></span>Buxtorf edited a Hebrew Commentary on Daniel by
Rabbi *Saadiah Hag-gaon,* who lived in Egypt and died about the middle
of the tenth century. Basil., A.D. 1618.

<span id="xii-p6"></span>R. Solomon Jarchi’s Commentary on Daniel is
exceedingly full and clear in its verbal explanations. The edition of J.
F. Breithaupt, Gotham, 1713, is *very* convenient, and full of most
valuable Hebrew criticisms.

<span id="xii-p7"></span>R. Isaac Abarbanel, who is frequently refuted
by Calvin in the preceding Lectures, has been mentioned in our Ezekiel,
vol. 2 p. 403. He entities his comments on Daniel, “The Fountains of
Salvation.” They were first published at Naples, A.D. 1497: again in
A.D. 1551, without the name of any place, and again at Amsterdam, A.D.
1647.

<span id="xii-p8"></span>R. Joseph Teitzak, who lived in the fifteenth
century, wrote a Commentary on Daniel, published at Venice, A.D. 1608.

<span id="xii-p9"></span>R. Joseph the son of David the son of Joseph
Jachia, commonly called Jacchiades, who died A.D. 1539, wrote a

<span id="xii-p10"></span>*Paraphrase on Daniel,* in much repute:
published at Amsterdam, A.D. 1633.

<span id="xii-p11"></span>R. Moses Alschech, who lived at the close of
the sixteenth century, called his Commentary on this Prophet, “The Rose
of Sharon:” published at Zaphetae, A.D. 1568, and at Venice, A.D. 1592.

<span id="xii-p12"></span>R. Samuel, son of R. Judah Valerius, entitled
his comment on this Prophet, “The Vision of the Time Appointed.” Venice,
A.D. 1586.

<span id="xii-p13"></span>2 Early Fathers.

<span id="xii-p14"></span>The Greek Commentary on this Prophet by
Hippolytus, Bishop of the harbor of Rome, has been already mentioned. It
was first edited at Paris, A.D. 1672, in a general collection of the
Greek Fathers, and afterwards *Jo. Alb. Fabricius* published the whole
of his works at Hamburgh, A.D. 1716 and 1718. His explanations of chaps.
7 to 12 are edited from the Chisian codex according to the Septuagint
translation, which, as we have formerly stated, was first published at
Rome, A.D. 1772.

<span id="xii-p15"></span>Ephrem Syrus wrote his Commentary on this
Prophet about A.D. 370. It was published at Rome, A.D. 1740, by *Peter
Benedict,* both in Syriac and Latin. See vol. 2 p. 203 and following.

<span id="xii-p16"></span>Jerome’s valuable exposition of this Prophet
is found in vol. 5 of his works, p. 2. Edit. Vallarsii. Venice, A.D.
1768.

<span id="xii-p17"></span>Theodoret’s valuable comments on Daniel are
found in vol. 2 pt. 2 p. 1053, of the edition of his works by J. L.
Schulze. Hal. Saxon., A.D. 1 768.

<span id="xii-p18"></span>3 Early Reformers.

<span id="xii-p19"></span>Martini Lutheri *Auslegung des Propheten
Daniels,* consists of three parts, published at different times at
Wittemberg, from A.D. 1530 to 1546. See *Jo. G. Walch’s* preface to
Luther’s Works, vol. 6 p. 13, and p. 1422 and following.

<span id="xii-p20"></span>Jo. Oecolampadii *Commentariorum in Danielem,
Libri Duo.* Basileae, A.D. 1530, 1543, and 1562: also, Geneva, A.D.
1553, *1567,* and 1578. A very valuable exposition, and more in
accordance with modern views of Antichrist and the spiritual nature of
our Lord’s kingdom, than the Lectures of Calvin.

<span id="xii-p21"></span>Philippi Melancthonis *Commentarius in
Danielem Prophetam.* Wittemberg, A.D. 1543: published also in his works,
and translated into German by *Justus Jonas.* P. 2 p. 416. A.D. 1546.

<span id="xii-p22"></span>4 Authors quoted by Poole  
in his Synopsosis on Daniel.

<span id="xii-p23"></span>As Poole merely gives the name of his authors
without any hint as to the titles and dates of their works, the
following information will be of use. It is confined exclusively to
Daniel

<span id="xii-p24"></span>Victorini Strigelii, *Danielis Prophetae
Concio.* Lipsiae, A.D. 1565, 1571, 1572. 8vo.

<span id="xii-p25"></span>Benedicti Pererii, *Com. in Danielem.* Romae,
A.D. 1586: also Lugduni, A.D. 1588, 1591, 1602: et Antverpiae, 1594

<span id="xii-p26"></span>Francisci Juan, *Expositio Prophetae
Danielis.* Heidelberg, A.D. 1593: Geuevae, 1594.

<span id="xii-p27"></span>Amandi Polani A Polensdorf *in Danielem
Prophetam Commentarius.* Basil., A.D. 1593, 4to, et 1606, 8vo.

<span id="xii-p28"></span>Joannes Maldonati, *Commentarii in prophetas
quatuor Jeremiam, Ezekiel, Baruch, et Danielem.* Moguntiae, A.D. 1611.

<span id="xii-p29"></span>The translation is good; the comments short
and explanatory of the Hebrew words; and it is to be expected that a
Jesuit would occasionally direct his shafts against “Calvinianis.”

<span id="xii-p30"></span>Hugone Broughtono, *Commentarius in Danielem
primum Anglice scriptus.* First published in English in London, A.D.
1596 and 1597. *Jo. Boreel* translated it into Latin at Basil, A.D.
1599. Small 4to.

<span id="xii-p31"></span>The Latin translation is materially influenced
by Rabbinical comments on the Hebrew and Chaldee text. The work is very
valuable as a repository of historical information in the words of the
original Greek historians.

<span id="xii-p32"></span>Hexapla In Danielem By Andrew Willet.
Cambridge, A.D. 1610.

<span id="xii-p33"></span>A very valuable collection of the opinions of
others, and a good study for those who are interested in the variety of
speculations which have been invented concerning the prophecies of this
book. The difficult questions “handled” are 536, and the knotty
controversies undertaken are 134. In addition to most of the standard
writers quoted by Poole, *Pintus* is introduced, whose work is entitled,
*Hectoris Pinti, Commentarii in Danielem, Lamentationes, Jeremiae, et
Nahum.* Conimbrae, A.D. 1582. Venetiis, A.D. 15S3. Colon., A.D. 1587.
Antverpiae, A.D. 1595.

<span id="xii-p34"></span>Poole also quotes the translations of this
Prophet made *by Pagninus, Montanus, and Malvenda,* who are Roman
Catholics; and *Munster, Junius* and *Tremellius,* and *Castalio,* who
are Protestants. Their various merits are given by H. Horne, vol. 2,
part 2, pp. 62, 64, who states the authorities from which he derives his
own information.

<span id="xii-p35"></span>5 Foreign Interpreters.

<span id="xii-p36"></span>The best of these are German. Their variety is
great; a few only can be noticed here; others will be found in abundance
in Rosenmuller’s *Elenchus* Interpretum.

<span id="xii-p37"></span>Martini Geieri, *Praelectiones Academicae in
Danielem.* Lipsiae, A.D. 1667, 1684, 1697, 1702: and repeated in vol.
it. of his works. Amsterdam, A.D. 1695, folio. “One of the most
valuable,” writes H. Horne, “of all Geier’s expository works.”

<span id="xii-p38"></span>Prodromus Danielicus auctore Jo. Ger.
Kerkherdere. Lovanii, A.D. 1711. 12mo.

<span id="xii-p39"></span>A small yet learned volume by the historian to
his Catholic Majesty Charles III., containing many criticisms and
attempts to reconcile historical difficulties. In many points very
illustrative of Calvin’s sentiments.

<span id="xii-p40"></span>Herman Venema, *Dissertationes* ad vaticinia
Danielis emblematica, cap. 2, 7, et 8. Leovardiae, A.D. 1745: another
vol. contains his exposition of cap. 11:4; 12:3. Leovardiae, A.D. 1752.
4to.

<span id="xii-p41"></span>Ch. B. Michaelis, *Annotationes
philologico-exegeticae in Danielem.* Hal., A.D. 1720.

<span id="xii-p42"></span>J. D. Michaelis, *Epistolae de LXX.
Hebdomadibus Danielis.* London, A.D. 1773.

<span id="xii-p43"></span>H. Havernick’s *New Commentary on the Book of
Daniel.* The original title is, Neue critische untersuchungen uber das
buch Daniel. Von Heinrich Havernick. Hamburgh, A.D. 1838. This small
volume of the excellent Professor at Rostock is much esteemed.

<span id="xii-p44"></span>Emst. Wilm. Hengstenberg. Die Authentic des
Daniel und die integritat des Sachariah. Berlin, A.D. 1831.

<span id="xii-p45"></span>This work is now accessible to the English
reader through the translation of the Revelation B. P. Pratten.

<span id="xii-p58"></span>As the Professor refers to many Neologian

of the four following ones are given in full. See their characters

on the Continent than in either Great Britain or America, will be found
in Rosenmuller’s “elenchus interpretum.” His own elaborate *Scholia in*
Danielem, Lipsiae, 1832, have proved very serviceable for the

import and application of the Vision related, <span
id="xii-p80.1"></span>[Da 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#020)<span
