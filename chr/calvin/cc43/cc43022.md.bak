<span id="v.v-p1"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="v.v.i"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p1"></span><span id="v.v.i-p1.1"></span>[Titus
3:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#001.md)<span id="v.v.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p2"></span>**1.** Put them in mind to be subject to
principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every
good work,

<span id="v.v.i-p3"></span>**1.** Admone illos principibus et
potestatibus subditos esse dicto oboedire ad omne opus bonum paratos
esse

<span id="v.v.i-p4"></span>**2.** To speak evil of no man, to be no
brawlers, *but* gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.

<span id="v.v.i-p5"></span>**2.** neminem blasphemare non litigiosos
esse modestos omnem ostendentes mansuetudinem ad omnes homines

<span id="v.v.i-p6"></span>**3.** For we ourselves also were sometimes
foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures,
living in malice and envy, hateful, *and* hating one another.

<span id="v.v.i-p7"></span>**3.** eramus enim et nos aliquando
insipientes increduli errantes servientes desideriis et voluptatibus
variis in malitia et invidia agentes odibiles odientes invicem

<span id="v.v.i-p8"></span><span id="v.v.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p9"></span>**1** *Remind them to be subject to
principalities and powers* From many passages it is evident that the
Apostles had great difficulty in keeping the common people subject to
the authority of magistrates and princes. We are all by nature desirous
of power; and the consequence is, that no one willingly is subject to
another. Besides, perceiving that nearly all the principalities and
powers of the world  <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) were at
that time opposed to Christ they thought them unworthy of receiving any
honor. The Jews especially, being an untamable race, did not cease to
mutiny and rage. Thus, after having spoken of particular duties, Paul
now wishes to give a general admonition to all, to observe peaceably the
order of civil government, to submit to the laws, to obey magistrates.
That subjection to princes, and that obedience to magistrates, which he
demands, is extended to edicts, and laws, and other parts of civil
government.

<span id="v.v.i-p11"></span>What he immediately adds, *To be ready for
every good work,* may be applied to the same subject, as if he had said,
“All who do not refuse to lead a good and virtuous life, will cheerfully
yield obedience to magistrates.” For, since they have been appointed for
the preservation of mankind, he who desires to have them removed, or
shakes off their yoke, is an enemy of equity and justice, and is
therefore devoid of all humanity. Yet if any prefer to interpret it
without any immediate relation to the context, I have no objection; and
indeed there can be no doubt that, in this sentence, he recommends to
them kind offices towards their neighbors throughout their whole life.

<span id="v.v.i-p12"></span><span id="v.v.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p13"></span>**2** *To speak evil of no one* He now lays
down the method of maintaining peace and friendship with all men. We
know that there is nothing to which the disposition of every man is more
prone than to despise others in comparison of himself. The consequence
is, that many are proud of the gifts of God; and this is accompanied by
contempt for their brethren, which is immediately followed by insult. He
therefore forbids Christians to glory over others, or to reproach them,
whatever may be their own superior excellence. Yet he does not wish them
to flatter the vices of wicked men; he only condemns the propensity to
slander.

<span id="v.v.i-p14"></span>*Not given to fighting* As if he had said,
“Quarrels and contentions must be avoided.” The old translation has
therefore rendered it better, *Not quarrelsome;* for there are other
ways of fighting than the sword or the fist. And from what follows it is
evident that this is the meaning; for he points out the remedies for the
evil, when he enjoins them *to be kind, and to shew all meekness towards
all men;* for “kindness” is contrasted with the utmost rigor of law, and
“meekness” with bitterness. If, therefore, we are disposed to avoid
every kind of contentions and fighting, let us learn, first, to moderate
many things by gentleness, and next to bear with many things; for they
who are excessively severe and ill-tempered carry with them a fire to
kindle strife.

<span id="v.v.i-p15"></span>He says, *towards all men,* in order to
intimate that he should bear with even the lowest and meanest persons.
Believers, holding wicked men in contempt, did not think them worthy of
any forbearance. Such severity, which arises from nothing else than
pride, Paul wished to correct.

<span id="v.v.i-p16"></span><span id="v.v.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.i-p17"></span>**3** *For we ourselves*  <span
id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) *also were formerly foolish* Nothing
is better adapted to subdue our pride, and at the same time to moderate
our severity, than when it is shewn that everything that we turn against
others may fall back on our own head; for he forgives easily who is
compelled to sue for pardon in return. And indeed, ignorance of our own
faults is the only cause that renders us unwilling to forgive our
brethren. They who have a true zeal for God, are, indeed, severe against
those who sin; but, because they begin with themselves, their severity
is always attended by compassion. In order that believers, therefore,
may not haughtily and cruelly mock at others, who are still held in
ignorance and blindness, Paul brings back to their remembrance what sort
of persons they formerly were; as if he had said, “If such fierce
treatment is done to those on whom God has not yet bestowed the light of
the gospel, with equally good reason might you have been at one time
harshly treated. Undoubtedly you would not have wished that any person
should be so cruel to you; exercise now, therefore, the same moderation
towards others.”

<span id="v.v.i-p19"></span>In the words of Paul, there are two things
that need to be understood. The first is, that they who have now been
enlightened by the Lord, being humbled by the remembrance of their
former ignorance, should not exalt themselves proudly over others, or
treat them with greater harshness and severity than that which, they
think, ought to have been exercised towards themselves when they were
what those now are. The second is, that they should consider, from what
has taken place in their own persons, that they who to-day are strangers
may to-morrow be received into the Church, and, having been led to
amendment of their sinful practices, may become partakers of the gifts
of God, of which they are now destitute. There is a bright mirror of
both in believers, who

<span id="v.v.i-p20"></span>“at one time were darkness, and afterwards
began  
to be light in the Lord.” (<span id="v.v.i-p20.2"></span>[Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008)<span id="v.v.i-p20.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v.i-p21"></span>The knowledge of their former condition
should therefore dispose them to συμπάθειαν fellow-feeling. On the other
hand, the grace of God, which they now enjoy, is a proof that others may
be brought to salvation.

<span id="v.v.i-p22"></span>Thus we see that we must be humbled before
God, in order that we may be gentle towards brethren; for pride is
always cruel and disdainful of others. In another passage, (<span
id="v.v.i-p22.1"></span>[Ga 6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.v.i-p22.1"></span>,) where he exhorts us to mildness, he advises
every one to remember his own weakness. Here he goes farther, for he
bids us remember those vices from which we have been delivered, that we
may not pursue too keenly those which, still dwell in others.

<span id="v.v.i-p23"></span>Besides, seeing that here Paul describes
briefly the natural disposition of men, such as it is before it is
renewed by the Spirit of God, we may behold, in this description, how
wretched we are while we are out of Christ. First, he calls unbelievers
*foolish,* because the whole wisdom of men is mere vanity, so long as
they do not know God. Next, he calls them *disobedient,* because, as it
is faith alone that truly obeys God, so unbelief is always wayward and
rebellious; although we might translate ἀπειθεῖς *unbelieving,* so as to
describe the kind of “foolishness.” Thirdly, he says that unbelievers
*go astray;* for Christ alone is “the way” and the “light of the world.”
(<span id="v.v.i-p23.1"></span>[John
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012.md), [John
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#006)<span id="v.v.i-p23.1"></span>..md)
All who are estranged from God must therefore wander and go astray
during their whole life.

<span id="v.v.i-p24"></span>Hitherto he has described the nature of
unbelief; but now he likewise adds the fruits which proceed from it,
namely, *various desires and pleasures, envy, malice,* and such like. It
is true that each person is not equally chargeable with every vice; but,
seeing that all are the slaves of wicked desires, although some are
carried away by one and others by another desire, Paul embraces in a
general statement  <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) all the
fruits that are anywhere produced by unbelief. This subject is explained
towards the close of the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.

<span id="v.v.i-p26"></span>Moreover, since Paul, by these marks,
distinguishes the children of God from unbelievers, if we wish to be
accounted believers, we must have our heart cleansed from all envy, and
from all malice; and we must both love and be beloved. It is
unreasonable that those desires should reign in us, which are there
called “various,” for this reason, in my opinion, that the lusts by
which a carnal man is driven about are like opposing billows, which, by
fighting against each other, turn the man hither and thither, so that he
changes and vacillates almost every moment. Such, at least, is the
restlessness of all who abandon themselves to carnal desires; because
there is no stability but in the fear of God.

<span id="v.v.ii"></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p1"></span><span id="v.v.ii-p1.1"></span>[Titus
3:4-7](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#004.md)<span id="v.v.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p2"></span>**4.** But after that the kindness and love
of God our Saviour toward man appeared,

<span id="v.v.ii-p3"></span>**4.** cum autem benignitas et humanitas
apparuit salvatoris nostri Dei

<span id="v.v.ii-p4"></span>**5.** Not by works of righteousness which
we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

<span id="v.v.ii-p5"></span>**5.** non ex operibus iustitiae quae
fecimus nos sed secundum suam misericordiam salvos nos fecit per
lavacrum regenerationis et renovationis Spiritus Sancti

<span id="v.v.ii-p6"></span>**6.** Which he shed on us abundantly
through Jesus Christ our Saviour;

<span id="v.v.ii-p7"></span>**6.** quem effudit in nos abunde per Iesum
Christum salvatorem nostrum

<span id="v.v.ii-p8"></span>**7.** That being justified by his grace, we
should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.

<span id="v.v.ii-p9"></span>**7.** ut iustificati gratia ipsius heredes
simus secundum spem vitae aeternae

<span id="v.v.ii-p10"></span><span id="v.v.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p11"></span>Either the principal clause in this
sentence is, that “God hath saved us by his mercy,” or the language is
elliptical. Thus it will be proper to supply, that they were changed for
the better, and became new men, in consequence of God having mercy upon
them; as if he had said, “When God regenerated you by his Spirit, then
did you begin to differ from others.” But since there is a complete
sense in the words of Paul, there is no necessity for making any
addition. He classes himself along with others, in order that the
exhortation may be more efficacious.

<span id="v.v.ii-p12"></span>**4** *But after that the goodness and love
towards man appeared* First, it might be asked, — “Did the goodness of
God begin to be made known to the world at the time when Christ was
manifested in the flesh? For certainly, from the beginning, the fathers
both knew and experienced that God was good, and kind, and gracious to
them; and therefore this was not the first manifestation of his
goodness, and fatherly love towards us,” The answer is easy. In no other
way did the fathers taste the goodness of God under the Law, than by
looking at Christ, on whose coming all their faith rested. Thus the
goodness of God is said to have *appeared,* when he exhibited a pledge
of it, and gave actual demonstration, that not in vain did he so often
promise salvation to men.

<span id="v.v.ii-p13"></span>“God so loved the world”, says John, “that
he gave his only-begotten Son.” (<span id="v.v.ii-p13.1"></span>[Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016)<span id="v.v.ii-p13.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v.ii-p14"></span>Paul also says in another passage,

<span id="v.v.ii-p15"></span>“Hereby God confirmeth his love towards us,
that, while we were enemies, Christ died for us.” (<span
id="v.v.ii-p15.1"></span>[Ro 5:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#008.md)<span
id="v.v.ii-p15.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.v.ii-p16"></span>It is a customary way of speaking in
Scripture, that the world was reconciled to God through the death of
Christ, although we know that he was a kind Father in all ages. But
because we find no cause of the love of God toward us, and no ground of
our salvation, but in Christ, not without good reason is God the Father
said to have shewn his goodness to us in him.

<span id="v.v.ii-p17"></span>Yet there is a different reason for it in
this passage, in which Paul speaks, not of that ordinary manifestation
of Christ which took place when he came as a man into the world, but of
the manifestation which is made by the gospel, when he exhibits and
reveals himself, in a peculiar manner, to the elect. At the first coming
of Christ, Paul was not renewed; but, on the contrary, Christ was raised
in glory, and salvation through his name shone upon many, not only in
Judea, but throughout the neighboring countries, while Paul, blinded by
unbelief, labored to extinguish this grace by every means in his power.
He therefore means that the grace of God “appeared” both to himself and
to others, when they were enlightened in the knowledge of the gospel.
And indeed, in no other way could these words apply; for he does not
speak indiscriminately about the men of his age, but specially addresses
those who had been separated from the ordinary ranks; as if he had said,
that formerly they resembled those unbelievers who were still plunged in
darkness, but that now they differ from them, not through their own
merit, but by the grace of God; in the same manner as he beats down all
the haughtiness of the flesh by the same argument. “Who maketh thee to
differ,” or to be more highly, esteemed than others? (<span
id="v.v.ii-p17.1"></span>[1Co 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.v.ii-p17.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.v.ii-p18"></span>*Goodness and love* He has with propriety
assigned the first rank to “goodness,” which prompts God to love us; for
God will never find in us anything which he ought to love, but he loves
us because he is good and merciful. Besides, although he testifies his
goodness and love to all, yet we know it by faith only, when he declares
himself to be our Father in Christ. Before Paul was called to the faith
of Christ, he enjoyed innumerable gifts of God, which might have given
him a taste of God’s fatherly kindness; he had been educated, from his
infancy, in the doctrine of the law; yet he wanders in darkness, so as
not to perceive the goodness of God, till the Spirit enlightened his
mind, and till Christ came forth as the witness and pledge of the grace
of God the Father, from which, but for him, we are all excluded. Thus he
means that the kindness of God is not revealed and known but by the
light of faith.

<span id="v.v.ii-p19"></span><span id="v.v.ii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p20"></span>**5** *Not by works*  <span
id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) Let us remember that here Paul
addresses his discourse to believers, and describes the manner in which
they entered into the kingdom of God. He affirms that by their works
they did not at all deserve that they should become partakers of
salvation, or that they should be reconciled to God through faith; but
he says that they obtained this blessing solely through the mercy of
God. We therefore conclude from his words, that we bring nothing to God,
but that he goes before us by his pure grace, without any regard to
works. For when he says, — “Not by works which we have done”, he means,
that we can do nothing but sin till we have been renewed by God. This
negative statement depends on the former affirmation, by which he said
that they were foolish and disobedient, and led away by various desires,
till they were created anew in Christ; and indeed, what good work could
proceed from so corrupt a mass?

<span id="v.v.ii-p22"></span>It is madness, therefore, to allege that a
man approaches to God by his own “preparations,” as they call them.
During the whole period of life they depart further and further from
him, until he puts forth his hand, and brings them back into that path
from which they had gone astray. In short, that we, rather than others,
have been admitted to enjoy the salivation of Christ, is altogether
ascribed by Paul to the mercy of God, because there were no works of
righteousness in us. This argument would have no weight, if he did not
take for granted, that everything that we attempt to do before we
believe, is unrighteous and hateful to God.

<span id="v.v.ii-p23"></span>*Which we had done.* To argue from the
preterite tense of this verb, that God looks at the future merits of men
when he calls them, is sophistical and foolish. “When Paul,” say they,
“denies that God is induced by our merits to bestow his grace upon us,
he limits the statement to the past time; and therefore, if it is only
for the righteousness going before that no room is left, future
righteousness is admitted to consideration.” But they assume a
principle, which Paul everywhere rejects, when he declares that election
by free grace is the foundation of good works. If we owe it entirely to
the grace of God, that we are fit for living a holy life, what future
works of ours will God look upon? If, previously to our being called by
God, iniquity holds such dominion over us, that it will not cease to
make progress till it come to its height, how can God be induced, by a
regard to our righteousness, to call us? Away then with such trifling!
When Paul spoke of past works, his sole object was to exclude all
merits. The meaning of his words is as if he had said, — “If we boast of
any merit, what sort of works had we?” This maxim holds good, that men
would not be better than they were before, if the Lord did not make them
better by his calling.

<span id="v.v.ii-p24"></span>*He hath saved us* He speaks of faith, and
shews that we have already obtained salvation. Although, so long as we
are held by the entanglements of sin, we carry about a body of death,
yet we are certain of our salvation, provided that we are ingrafted into
Christ by faith, according to that saying, —

<span id="v.v.ii-p25"></span>“He that believeth in the Son of God  
hath passed from death into life.” (<span id="v.v.ii-p25.2"></span>[Joh
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#024)<span id="v.v.ii-p25.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v.ii-p26"></span>Yet, shortly afterwards, by introducing the
word *faith,* the Apostle will shew that we have not yet actually
attained what Christ procured for us by his death. Hence it follows,
that, on the part of God, our salvation is completed, while the full
enjoyment of it is delayed till the end of our warfare. And that is what
the same Apostle teaches in another passage, that “we are saved by
hope.” (<span id="v.v.ii-p26.1"></span>[Ro
8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024)<span id="v.v.ii-p26.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v.ii-p27"></span>By the *washing of regeneration* I have no
doubt that he alludes, at least, to baptism, and even I will not object
to have this passage expounded as relating to baptism; not that
salvation is contained in the outward symbol of water, but because
baptism tells to us the salvation obtained by Christ. Paul treats of the
exhibition of the grace of God, which, we have said, has been made by
faith. Since therefore a part of revelation consists in baptism, that
is, so far as it is intended to confirm our faith, he properly makes
mention of it. Besides, baptism — being the entrance into the Church and
the symbol of our ingrafting into Christ — is here appropriately
introduced by Paul, when he intends to shew in what manner the grace of
God appeared to us; so that the strain of the passage runs thus: — “God
hath saved us by his mercy, the symbol and pledge of which he gave in
baptism, by admitting us into his Church, and ingrafting us into the
body of his Son.”

<span id="v.v.ii-p28"></span>Now the Apostles are wont to draw an
argument from the Sacraments, to prove that which is there exhibited
under a figure, because it ought to be held by believers as a settled
principle, that God does not sport with us by unmeaning figures, but
inwardly accomplishes by his power what he exhibits by the outward sign;
and therefore, baptism is fitly and truly said to be “the washing of
regeneration.” The efficacy and use of the sacraments will be properly
understood by him who shall connect the sign and the thing signified, in
such a manner as not to make the sign unmeaning and inefficacious, and
who nevertheless shall not, for the sake of adorning the sign, take away
from the Holy Spirit what belongs to him. Although by baptism wicked men
are neither washed nor renewed, yet it retains that power, so far as
relates to God, because, although they reject the grace of God, still it
is offered to them. But here Paul addresses believers, in whom baptism
is always efficacious, and in whom, therefore, it is properly connected
with its truth and efficacy. But by this mode of expression we are
reminded that, *if* we do not wish to annihilate holy baptism, we must
prove its efficacy by “newness of life.” (<span
id="v.v.ii-p28.1"></span>[Ro 6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md)<span
id="v.v.ii-p28.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.v.ii-p29"></span>*And of the renewing of the Holy Spirit*
 <span id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) Though he mentioned the sign,
that he might exhibit to our view the grace of God, yet, that we may not
fix our whole attention on the sign, he immediately sends us to the
Spirit, that we may know that we are washed by his power, and not by
water, agreeably to what is said, —

<span id="v.v.ii-p31"></span>“I will sprinkle on you clean waters, even
my Spirit.”  
(<span id="v.v.ii-p31.2"></span>[Ezek.
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#027)<span id="v.v.ii-p31.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v.ii-p32"></span>And indeed, the words of Paul agree so
completely with the words of the Prophet, that it appears clearly that
both of them say the same thing. For this reason I said at the
commencement, that Paul, while he speaks directly about the Holy Spirit,
at the same time alludes to baptism. It is therefore the Spirit of God
who regenerates us, and makes us new creatures; but because his grace is
invisible and hidden, a visible symbol of it is beheld in baptism.

<span id="v.v.ii-p33"></span>Some read the word “renewing,” in the
accusative case, thus: — “through the washing of regeneration and
(through) the renewing of the Holy Spirit.”, But the other reading —
“through the washing of regeneration and of the renewing of the Holy
Spirit” — is, in my opinion, preferable.

<span id="v.v.ii-p34"></span><span id="v.v.ii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p35"></span>**6.** *Which he shed,* (or, *whom he
shed.)* In the Greek, the relative may apply either to the “washing” or
to the “Spirit;” for both of the nouns — λουτρόν and Πνεῦμα — are
neuter. It makes little difference as to the meaning; but the metaphor
will be more elegant, if the relative be applied to λουτρόν the
“washing” Nor is it inconsistent with this opinion, that all are
baptized without any distinction; for, while he shews that the “washing”
is “shed,” he speaks not of the sign, but rather of the thing signified,
in which the truth of the sign exists.

<span id="v.v.ii-p36"></span>When he, says, *abundantly,* he means that,
the more any of us excels in the abundance of the gifts which he has
received, so much the more is he under obligations to the mercy of God,
which alone enriches us; for in ourselves we are altogether poor, and
destitute of everything good. If it be objected that not all the
children of God enjoy so great abundance, but, on the contrary, the
grace of God drops sparingly on many; the answer is, that no one has
received so small a measure that he may not be justly accounted rich;
for the smallest drop of the Spirit (so to speak) resembles an
ever-flowing fountain, which never dries up. It is therefore a
sufficient reason for calling it “abundance,” that, how small soever the
portion that has been given to us it is never exhausted.

<span id="v.v.ii-p37"></span>*Through Jesus Christ*  <span
id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) It is he alone in whom we are adopted;
and therefore, it is he alone, through whom we are made partakers of the
Spirit, who is the earnest and witness of our adoption. Paul therefore
teaches us by this word, that the Spirit of regeneration is bestowed on
none but those who are the members of Christ.

<span id="v.v.ii-p39"></span><span id="v.v.ii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.ii-p40"></span>**7** *That being justified by his grace*
If we understand “regeneration” in its strict and ordinary meaning, it
might be thought that the Apostle employs the word “justified” instead
of “regenerated;” and this is sometimes the meaning of it, but very
seldom; yet there is no necessity which constrains us to depart from its
strict and more natural signification. The design of Paul is, to ascribe
to the grace of *God* all that we are, and all that we have, so that we
may not exalt ourselves proudly against others. Thus he now extols the
mercy of God, *by* ascribing to it entirely the cause of our salvation.
But because he had spoken of the vices of unbelievers, it would have
been improper to leave out the grace of regeneration, which is the
medicine for curing them.

<span id="v.v.ii-p41"></span>Still this does not prevent him from
returning immediately to praise divine mercy; and he even mingles both
blessings together — that our sins have been freely pardoned, and that
we have been renewed so as to obey God. This, at least, is evident, that
Paul maintains that “justification,” is the free gift of God; and the
only question is, what he means by the word justified. The contest seems
to demand that its meaning shall be extended further than to the
imputation of righteousness; and in this larger sense it is seldom (as I
have said) employed by Paul; yet there is nothing that hinders the
meaning of it from being limited to the forgiveness of sins.

<span id="v.v.ii-p42"></span>When he says, *by his grace,* this applies
both to Christ and to the Father, and we ought not to contend for either
of these expositions, because it will always hold good, that, by the
grace of God, we have obtained righteousness through Christ.

<span id="v.v.ii-p43"></span>*Heirs according to the hope of eternal
life* This clause is added by way of exposition. He had said that we
have been saved through the mercy of God.  <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) But our salvation is as yet hidden;
and therefore he now says that we are heirs of life, not because we have
arrived at the present possession of it, but because hope brings to us
full and complete certainly of it. The meaning may be thus summed up.
“Having been dead, we were restored to life through the grace of Christ,
when God the: Father bestowed on us his Spirit, by whose power we have
been purified. and renewed. Our salvation consists in this; but, because
we are still in the world, we do not yet enjoy ‘eternal life,’ but only
obtain it by ‘hoping.’”

<span id="v.v.iii-p1"></span><span id="v.v.iii-p1.1"></span>[Titus
3:8-9](../../../bib/kjv/tit003.htm#008.md)<span id="v.v.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iii-p2"></span>**8.** *This is* a faithful saying, and
these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have
believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things
are good and profitable unto men.

<span id="v.v.iii-p3"></span>**8.** fidelis sermo est et de his volo to
confirmare ut curent bonis operibus praeesse qui credunt Deo haec sunt
bona et utilia hominibus

<span id="v.v.iii-p4"></span>**9.** But avoid foolish questions, and
genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are
unprofitable and vain.

<span id="v.v.iii-p5"></span>**9.** Stultas autem quaestiones et
genealogias et contentiones et pugnas legis devita sunt enim inutiles et
vanae

<span id="v.v.iii-p6"></span><span id="v.v.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iii-p7"></span>**8** *A faithful saying* He employs this
mode of expression, when he wishes to make a solemn assertion as we have
seen in both of the Epistles to Timothy. (<span
id="v.v.iii-p7.1"></span>[1 Tim. 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#015.md),
[1 Tim. 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#001.md)<span
id="v.v.iii-p7.1"></span>; <span id="v.v.iii-p7.2"></span>[2Ti
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#011)<span id="v.v.iii-p7.2"></span>..md)
And therefore he immediately adds: —

<span id="v.v.iii-p8"></span>*I wish thee to affirm these things*  <span
id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) Διαβεβαιοῦσθαι under a passive
termination, has an active signification, and means “to affirm anything
strongly.” Titus is therefore enjoined to disregard other matters, and
to teach those which are certain and undoubted — to press them on the
attention of their hearers — to dwell upon them — while others talk idly
about things of little importance. Hence also, we conclude that a bishop
must not make any assertions at random, but must assert those things
only which he has ascertained to be true. “Affirm these things,” says
he, “because they are true and worthy of credit.” But we are reminded,
on the other hand, that it is the duty and office of a bishop to affirm
strongly, and maintain boldly, those things which are believed on good
grounds, and which edify godliness.

<span id="v.v.iii-p10"></span>*That they who have believed God may be
careful to excel in good works,* (or, *to extol good works,* or, *to
assign to them the highest rank.)* He includes all the instructions
which he formerly gave concerning the duty of every person, and the
desire of leading a religious and holy life; as if he contrasted the
fear of God, and well-regulated conduct, with idle speculations. He
wishes the people to be instructed in such a manner that “they who have
believed God,” may be solicitous, above all things, about good works.

<span id="v.v.iii-p11"></span>But, as the verb προΐστασθαι is used in
various senses by Greek authors, this passage also gives scope for
various interpretations. Chrysostom: explains it to mean, that they
should endeavor to relieve their neighbors by giving alms. Προΐστασθαι
does sometimes mean “to give assistance;” but in that case the syntax
would require us to understand that the “good works” should be aided,
which would be a harsh construction. The meaning conveyed by the French
word <span id="v.v.iii-p11.1"></span>*avancer, “*to go forward,” would
be more appropriate. What if we should say, — “Let them strive as those
who have the pre-eminence?” That is also one meaning of the word. Or,
perhaps, some one will prefer what I have enclosed in brackets: “Let
them be careful to assign the highest rank to good works.” And certainly
it would not be unsuitable that Paul should enjoin that those things
should prevail in the life of believers, because they are usually
disregarded by others.

<span id="v.v.iii-p12"></span>Whatever may be the ambiguity of the
expression, the meaning of Paul is sufficiently clear, that the design
of Christian doctrine is, that believers should exercise themselves in
good works.  <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) Thus he wishes them
to give to it their study and application; and, when the Apostle says,
φροντίζωσι (“let them be careful,”) he appears to allude elegantly to
the useless contemplations of those who speculate without advantage, and
without regard to active life.

<span id="v.v.iii-p14"></span>Yet he is not so careful about good works
as to despise the root — that is, faith — while he is gathering the
fruits. He takes account of both parts, and, as is highly proper,
assigns the first rank to faith; for he enjoins those “who believed in
God” to be zealous of “good works;” by which he means that faith must go
before in such a manner that good works may follow.

<span id="v.v.iii-p15"></span>*For these things are honorable* I refer
this to the doctrine rather than to the works, in this sense: “It is
excellent and useful that men be thus instructed; and, therefore, those
things which he formerly exhorted Titus to be zealous in affirming are
the same things that are good and useful to men.” We might translate τὰ
καλά either “good,” or “beautiful,” or “honorable;” but, in my opinion,
it would be best to translate it “excellent.” He states indirectly that
all other things that are taught are of no value, because they yield no
profit or advantage; as, on the contrary, that which contributes to
salvation is worthy of praise.

<span id="v.v.iii-p16"></span><span id="v.v.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iii-p17"></span>**9** *But avoid foolish questions* There
is no necessity for debating long about the exposition of this passage.
He contrasts “questions” with sound and certain doctrine. Although it is
necessary to seek, in order to find, yet there is a limit to seeking,
that you may understand what is useful to be known, and, next, that you
may adhere firmly to the truth, when it has been known. Those who
inquire curiously into everything, and are never at rest, may be truly
called Questionarians. In short, what the schools of the Sorbonne
account worthy of the highest praise — is here condemned by Paul; for
the whole theology of the Papists is nothing else than a labyrinth of
questions. He calls them *foolish;* not that, at first sight, they
appear to be such, (for, on the contrary, they often deceive by a vain
parade of wisdom,) but because they contribute nothing to godliness.

<span id="v.v.iii-p18"></span>When he adds *genealogies,* he mentions
one class of “foolish questions;” for instance, when curious men,
forgetting to gather fruit from the sacred histories, seize on the
lineage of races, and trifles of that nature, with which they weary
themselves without advantage. Of that folly we spoke towards the
beginning of the First Epistle to Timothy.  <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md)

<span id="v.v.iii-p20"></span>He properly adds *contentions;* because in
“questions” the prevailing spirit is ambition; and, therefore, it is
impossible but that they shall immediately break forth into “contention”
and quarrels; for there every one wishes to be the conqueror. This is
accompanied by hardihood in affirming about things that are uncertain,
which unavoidably leads to debates.

<span id="v.v.iii-p21"></span>*And fightings about the law* He gives
this disdainful appellation to those debates which were raised by the
Jews under the pretence of the law; not that the law of itself produces
them, but because the Jews, pretending to defend the law, disturbed the
peace of the Church by their absurd controversies about the observation
of ceremonies, about the distinction of the kinds of food and things of
that nature.

<span id="v.v.iii-p22"></span>*For they are unprofitable and
unnecessary* In doctrine, therefore, we should always have regard to
usefulness, so that everything that does not contribute to godliness
shall be held in no estimation. And yet those sophists, in babbling
about things of no value, undoubtedly boasted of them as highly worthy
and useful to be known; but Paul does not acknowledge them to possess
any usefulness, unless they tend to the increase of faith and to a holy
life.

<span id="v.v.iv-p14"></span>It was written to Titus, ordained the first
bishop of the church of the Cretians, from Nicopolis of Macedonia.

<span id="v.v.iv-p15"></span>Ad Titum, qui primus Cretensium Ecclesiae
ordinatus fuit Episcopus, scripsit ex Nicopoli Macedoniae.

<span id="v.v.iv-p16"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p17"></span>**10** *Avoid an heretical man* This is
properly added; because there will be no end of quarrels and dispute, if
we wish to conquer obstinate men by argument; for they will never want
words, and they will derive fresh courage from impudence, so that they
will never grow weary of fighting. Thus, after having given orders to
Titus as to the form of doctrine which he should lay down, he now
forbids him to waste much time in debating with heretics, because battle
would lead to battle and dispute to dispute. Such is the cunning of
Satan, that, by the impudent talkativeness of such men, he entangles
good and faithful pastors, so as to draw them away from diligence in
teaching. We must therefore beware lest we become engaged in quarrelsome
disputes; for we shall never have leisure to devote our labors to the
Lord’s flock, and contentious men will never cease to annoy us.

<span id="v.v.iv-p18"></span>When he commands him to *avoid* such
persons, it is as if he said that he must not toil hard to satisfy them,
and even that there is nothing better than to cut off the handle for
fighting which they are eager to find. This is a highly necessary
admonition; for even they who would willingly take no part in strifes of
words are sometimes drawn by shame into controversy, because they think
that it would be shameful cowardice to quit the field. Besides, there is
no temper, however mild, that is not liable to be provoked by the fierce
taunts of enemies, because they look upon it as intolerable that those
men should attack the truth, (as they are accustomed to do,) and that
none should reply. Nor are there wanting men who are either of a
combative disposition, or excessively hot-tempered, who are eager for
battle. On the contrary, Paul does not wish that the servant of Christ
should be much and long employed in debating with heretics.

<span id="v.v.iv-p19"></span>We must now see what he means by the word
heretic. There is a common and well-known distinction between a heretic
and a schismatic. But here, in my opinion, Paul disregards that
distinction: for, by the term “heretic” he describes not only those who
cherish and defend an erroneous or perverse doctrine, but in general all
who do not yield assent to the sound doctrine which he laid down a
little before. Thus under this name he includes all ambitious, unruly,
contentious persons, who, led away by sinful passions, disturb the peace
of the Church, and raise disputings. In short, every person who, by his
overweening pride, breaks up the unity of the Church, is pronounced by
Paul to be “heretic.”

<span id="v.v.iv-p20"></span>But we must exercise moderation, so as not
instantly to declare every man to be a “heretic” who does not agree with
our opinion. There are some matters on which Christians may differ from
each other, without being divided into sects. Paul himself commands that
they shall not be so divided, when he bids them keep their harmony
unbroken, and wait for the revelation of God. (<span
id="v.v.iv-p20.1"></span>[Php
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#016)<span id="v.v.iv-p20.1"></span>..md)
But whenever the obstinacy of any person grows to such an extent, that,
led by selfish motives, he either separates from the body, or draws away
some of the flock, or interrupts the course of sound doctrine, in such a
case we must boldly resist.

<span id="v.v.iv-p21"></span>In a word, a heresy or sect and the unity
of the Church — are things totally opposite to each other. Since the
unity of the Church is dear to God, and ought to be held by us in the
highest estimation, we ought to entertain the strongest abhorrence of
heresy. Accordingly, the name of sect or heresy, though philosophers and
statesmen reckon it to be honorable, is justly accounted infamous among
Christians. We now understand who are meant by Paul, when he bids us
dismiss and avoid heretics. But at the same time we ought to observe
what immediately follows, —

<span id="v.v.iv-p22"></span>*After the first and second admonition;*
for neither shall we have a right to pronounce a man to be a heretic,
nor shall we be at liberty to reject him, till we have first endeavored
to bring him back to sound views.  <span
id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) He does not mean any “admonition,”
whatever, or that of a private individual, but an “admonition” given by
a minister, with the public authority of the Church; for the meaning of
the Apostle’s words is as if he had said, that heretics must be rebuked
with solemn and severe censure.

<span id="v.v.iv-p24"></span>They who infer from this passage, that the
supporters of wicked doctrines must be restrained by excommunication
alone, and that no rigorous measures beyond this must be used against
them, do not argue conclusively. There is a difference between the
duties of a bishop and those of a magistrate. Writing to Titus, Paul
does not treat of the office of a magistrate, but points out what
belongs to a bishop.  <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) Yet
moderation is always best, that, instead of being restrained by force
and violence, they may be corrected by the discipline of the Church, if
there be any ground to believe that they can be cured.

<span id="v.v.iv-p26"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p26.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p27"></span>**11** *Knowing that he who is such is
ruined* He declares that man to be “ruined,” as to whom there is no hope
of repentance, because, if our labor could bring back any man to the
right path, it should by no means be withheld. The metaphor is taken
from a building, which is not merely decayed in some part, but
completely demolished, so that it is incapable of being repaired.

<span id="v.v.iv-p28"></span>He next points out the sign of this ruin —
an evil conscience, when he says, that they who do not yield to
admonitions *are condemned by themselves;* for, since they obstinately
reject the truth, it is certain that they sin willfully and of their own
accord, and therefore it would be of no advantage to admonish them.

<span id="v.v.iv-p29"></span>At the same time, we learn from Paul’s
words that we must not rashly or at random pronounce any man to be a
heretic; for he says, “Knowing that he who is such is ruined.” Let the
bishop therefore beware lest, by indulging his passionate temper, he
treat with excessive harshness, as a heretic, one whom he does not yet
know to be such.

<span id="v.v.iv-p30"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p30.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p31"></span>**13** *Zenas a lawyer* It is uncertain
whether “Zenas”, was a Doctor of the Civil Law or of the Law of Moses;
but as we may learn from Paul’s words that he was a poor man and needed
the help of others, it is probable that he belonged to the same rank
with *Apollo,* that is, an expounder of the Law of God among the Jews.
It more frequently happens that such persons are in want of the
necessaries of life than those who conduct causes in civil courts. I
have said that Zenas’s poverty may be inferred from the words of Paul,
because the expression, *conduct him,* means here to supply him with the
means of accomplishing his journey, as is evident from what follows.

<span id="v.v.iv-p32"></span><span id="v.v.iv-p32.1"></span>

<span id="v.v.iv-p33"></span>**14** *And let ours also learn to excel in
good works.*  <span id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) That the Cretans,
on whom he lays this burden, may not complain of being loaded with the
expense, he reminds them that they *must not be unfruitful,* and that
therefore they must be warmly exhorted to be zealous in good works. But
of this mode of expression we have already spoken. Whether, therefore,
he enjoins them to excel in good works, or to assign the highest rank to
good works, he means that it is useful for them to have an opportunity
afforded for exercising liberality, that they may not “be unfruitful” on
this ground, that there is no opportunity, or that it is not demanded by
necessity. What follows has been already explained in the other
Epistles.

turned it against nature. When the mind was thus prepossessed, and the
will made the lusts of the flesh its work and trade, there was no
likelihood of any co-operation with God, in fulfilling his desires, till
the bent of the heart was changed from the flesh and its principles. The
heart is stone before grace. No stone can cooperate with any that would
turn it into flesh, since it hath no seed, causes, or principles of any
fleshly nature in it. Since we are overwhelmed by the rubbish of our
corrupted estate, we can no more co-operate to the removal of it than a
man buried under the ruins of a fallen house can contribute to the
removal of that great weight that lies upon him. Neither would a man in

with them their own hell into hell, ‘hell being at last cast into hell’
(as the expression in the Revelation is.) It is a throwing hell into
hell, when a wicked man comes to hell; for he was his own hell before.
God, beholding this forlorn case of wretched creatures, saith, I must
either renew them or lose them; I must either transform them, or they
must perish: they are in the fire of hell already. Such and such we
were, but of his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration, and
renewing by the Holy Ghost. O! the compassionate influence that is shed
upon a soul in this case! The balmy dews that descend from heaven upon a

not works of righteousness which we have done, but the kindness, the

child of man must ascribe both his fruition of present, and his
expectation of future blessedness. **II. —** The effects, which are —
**1.** Justification, being justified, having our sins forgiven and our
persons accepted through the righteousness of Christ imputed; all this
without any the least deserving quality in us, solely by his grace and
most unmerited goodness. **2.** Sanctification expressed by the washing
of regeneration — that washing in the Redeemer’s blood which cleanses
the soul from guilt, as the washing of water cleanseth the body from
filth, which reconciles to God, gives peace of conscience, and thereby
lays the foundation of an universal spiritual change — the renewing of
the Holy Ghost, whose influences, testifying of Christ, and applying his
merits, introduce an improvement into all the faculties of the mind,
something like that annual renovation and general smile which the return
of spring diffuses over the face of nature. **III. —** The end and
consummation of all — that we should be made heirs of the heavenly
kingdom, and live more in the assured hope, hereafter in the full
enjoyment, of eternal.” — *Hervey.*

<span id="v.v.ii-p30"></span> “It remaineth that we declare what is the
office of the same, what he, is unto us, as the Holy Spirit; for
although the Spirit of God be of infinite, essential, and original
holiness, as God, and so may be called Holy in himself; though other
spirits which were created be either actually now unholy, or of
defectible sanctity at first, and so having the name of spirit common
unto them, he may be termed holy, that he may be distinguished from
them; yet I conceive he is rather called the Holy Spirit, for the Spirit
of Holiness (<span id="v.v.ii-p30.1"></span>[Ro
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004)<span id="v.v.ii-p30.1"></span>,.md)
because of the three persons in the blessed Trinity, it is his
particular office to sanctify or make us holy. As, therefore, what our
Savior did and suffered for us belonged to that office of a Redeemer
which he took upon him; so whatsoever the Holy Ghost worketh in order to
the same salvation, we look upon as belonging to his office. And because
without holiness it is impossible to please God, because we all are
impure and unholy, and the purity and holiness which is required in us
to appear in the presence of God, whose eyes are pure, must be wrought
in us by the Spirit of God, who is called Holy, because he is the cause
of this holiness in us, therefore we acknowledge the office of the
Spirit of God to consist in the sanctifying of the servants of God, and
the declaration of this office, added to the description of his nature,
to be a sufficient explication of the object of faith contained in this
article — ’I believe in the Holy Ghost’.” — *Bp. Pearson on the Creed.*

now find grace — it is he who procured for us the adoption by which we

must seek all the parts of our salvation in Jesus Christ; for we shall

<span id="v.v.iii-p9"></span> “Meaning, ‘and I would have you constantly
insist on these truths; so that those who have believed in God may
maintain good works.’ The cause of the obscurity, and consequent
diversity of interpretation, arose from the Apostle not having here
shewn *how* it should be, that the doctrine of salvation by grace should
produce holiness of life. But he has done it in another kindred passage,
namely, <span id="v.v.iii-p9.1"></span>[Eph.
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md)<span id="v.v.iii-p9.1"></span>,
where, after having at large treated on the subject of salvation by
grace, (as here,) adding that it is not of works, lest any man should
boast, he subjoins, αὐτοῦ γάρ ἐσμεν, κ.τ.λ. where the γὰρ refers to a
clause omitted, q. d. (Yet works must be done,) for, etc. Hence it would
seem that καλῶν ἔργων here must have the same sense as ἔργοις ἀγαθοῖς
there; and consequently it must not be limited, with many eminent
commentators, to works of benevolence, still less to the business of our
avocation, but be extended to good works of every kind.” — *Bloomfield.*

<span id="v.v.iii-p13"></span> “The original word προΐστασθαι has a
beauty and an energy, which, I believe, it is impossible for our
language to preserve by any literal translation. It implies, that a
believer should not only be exercised in, but eminent for, all good
works; should shew others the way, and outstrip them in the honorable
race; be both a pattern and a patron of universal godliness.” —
*Hervey.*

<span id="v.v.iv-p34"></span> “As he said before, let them apply their
mind to it. He contrasts this with the foolish presumption but too
common among those who thought that they were clever men, when they had
speculated on this and the other subject. You have fine speculations,
says he, but yet consider what is the true excellence of the children of
God; it is to shew that they have profited well in doing good, and that
this is the subject to which they have given their study. And then he
says, *Let them learn;* as if he had said, Hitherto you have employed
your time very ill, for there was nothing but foolish ambition, you
yielded too far to your vain fancy. You must now follow a different
course. Henceforth you must excel in doing good, and not in rambling
talk. Instead of being led by curiosity and ambition, let every man be
employed in doing good to his neighbors. Let every man consider what is
his ability; and according to the power which God has given us, let us
serve one another. Thus shall we shew that it is not in vain that we
have received the gospel.” — *Fr. Ser.*
