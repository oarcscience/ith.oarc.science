<span id="v.iv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="v.iv.i"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p1"></span><span id="v.iv.i-p1.1"></span>[Titus
2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#001.md)<span id="v.iv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p2"></span>**1.** But speak thou the things which
become sound doctrine:

<span id="v.iv.i-p3"></span>**1.** Tu autem loquere quae decet sanam
doctrinam

<span id="v.iv.i-p4"></span>**2.** That the aged men be sober, grave,
temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.

<span id="v.iv.i-p5"></span>**2.** senes ut sobrii sint pudici prudentes
sani fide dilectione patientia

<span id="v.iv.i-p6"></span>**3.** The aged women likewise, that *they
be* in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to
much wine, teachers of good things;

<span id="v.iv.i-p7"></span>**3.** anus similiter in habitu sancto non
criminatrices non vino multo servientes bene docentes

<span id="v.iv.i-p8"></span>**4.** That they may teach the young women
to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,

<span id="v.iv.i-p9"></span>**4.** ut prudentiam doceant adulescentulas
ut viros suos ament filios diligant

<span id="v.iv.i-p10"></span>**5.** *To be* discreet, chaste, keepers at
home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not
blasphemed.

<span id="v.iv.i-p11"></span>**5.** prudentes castas domus curam
habentes benignas subditas suis viris ut non blasphemetur verbum Dei

<span id="v.iv.i-p12"></span><span id="v.iv.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p13"></span>**1.** *But speak thou the things which
become sound doctrine* He points out the remedy for driving away fables,
namely, that Titus should devote himself to edification. He gives the
appellation of *sound doctrine* to that which may instruct men to
godliness; for all trifles vanish away, when that which is solid is
taught. When he enjoins him to speak those things which agree with
“sound doctrine,” it is as if he had said, that Titus must be
continually employed in this preaching; for to mention these things once
or twice would not be enough. And Paul does not speak of the discourse
of a single day; but so long as Titus shall hold the office of pastor,
he wishes him to be employed in teaching this doctrine.

<span id="v.iv.i-p14"></span>“Sound doctrine” is so called from the
effect produced by it; as, on the contrary, he says, that unskillful men
dote about questions which do no good. *Sound,* therefore, means
wholesome, that which actually feeds souls. Thus, by a single word, as
by a solemn proclamation, he banishes from the Church all speculations
which serve rather to promote ostentation than to aid godliness,  <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) as he did in both of the Epistles to
Timothy.

<span id="v.iv.i-p16"></span>He makes “sound doctrine” to consist of two
parts. The first is that which magnifies the grace of God in Christ,
from which we may learn where we ought to seek our salvation; and the
second is that by which the life is framed to the fear of God, and
inoffensive conduct. Although the former, which includes faith, is far
more excellent, and therefore ought to be more zealously inculcated; yet
Paul, in writing to Timothy, was not careful about attending to order;
for he had to deal with an intelligent man, to whom he would offer an
insult, if he dictated to him word by word, as is usually done to
apprentices or beginners. Under the person of Titus, indeed, he
instructs the whole church of Crete; yet he attends to the rules of
propriety, that he may not appear to distrust his prudence. Besides, the
reason why he is longer in his exhortations is, that they who gave their
whole attention to idle questions — needed especially to be exhorted to
the practice of a good and holy life; for nothing is better fitted to
restrain the wandering curiosity of men than to know in what duties
 <span id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) they ought to be employed.

<span id="v.iv.i-p18"></span><span id="v.iv.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p19"></span>**2.** *That aged men be sober* He begins
with particular duties, that the discourse may be better adapted to the
instruction of the people. And he does so, not only that he may
accommodate himself to their capacity, but that he may press every one
more closely; for a general doctrine produces a less powerful
impression; but when by holding out a few cases, he has instructed every
person about his duty, there is no one who may not easily conclude, that
the Lord has sufficiently instructed him as to the work in which he
ought to be employed. We must not therefore, look for a regular method
here; for Paul’s design was only to state briefly what were the subjects
concerning which godly teachers ought to speak, and not to undertake to
treat largely of those subjects.

<span id="v.iv.i-p20"></span>“Aged men” are mentioned by him in the
first place. He wishes them to be “sober,” because excessive drinking is
a vice too common among the old. *Gravity,* which he next mentions, is
procured by well-regulated morals. Nothing is more shameful than for an
old man to indulge in youthful wantonness, and, by his countenance, to
strengthen the impudence of the young. In the life of old men,
therefore, let there be displayed σεμνότης “a becoming gravity,” which
shall constrain the young to modesty. This will be followed chiefly by
*temperance,* which he immediately adds.

<span id="v.iv.i-p21"></span>*Sound in faith* I do not know whether the
word “sound” or “healthy” contains an indirect allusion to the various
diseases of old men, with which he contrasts this health of the soul; at
least, I think so, though I do not affirm it. With good reason does he
include in these three parts — *faith, love, patience* — the sum of
Christian perfection. *By faith* we worship God; for neither calling
upon him, nor any exercises of godliness, can be separated from it.
*Love* extends to all the commandments of the second table. Next follows
*patience* as the seasoning of “faith” and “love;” for without
“patience” faith would not long endure, and many occurrences are taking
place every day — instances of unhandsome conduct or evil temper, which
irritate us so much that we should not only be languid, but almost dead,
to the duties of love towards our neighbor, if the same “patience” did
not support us.

<span id="v.iv.i-p22"></span><span id="v.iv.i-p22.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p23"></span>**3.** *That aged women in like manner* We
very frequently see, that females advanced in age either continue to
dress with the lightness of youthful years, or have something
superstitious in their apparel, and seldom hit the golden mean. Paul
wished to guard against both extremes, by enjoining them to follow a
course that is agreeable both to outward propriety and to religion; or,
if you choose to express it in simpler language, to give evidence, by
their very dress, that they are holy and godly women.

<span id="v.iv.i-p24"></span>He next corrects another two vices, to
which they are often addicted, when he forbids them to be *slanderers*
and *slaves to much wine* Talkativeness is a disease of women, and it is
increased by old age. To this is added, that women never think that they
are eloquent enough, if they are not given to prattling and to slander —
if they do not attack the characters of all. The consequence is, that
old women, by their slanderous talkativeness, as by a lighted torch,
frequently set on fire may houses. Many are also given to drinking, so
that, forgetting modesty and gravity, they indulge in an unbecoming
wantonness.

<span id="v.iv.i-p25"></span><span id="v.iv.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p26"></span>**4.** *That they may teach young women
temperance* That they may be more attentive to duty, he shows that it is
not enough if their own life be decent, if they do not also train *young
women,* by their instructions, to a decent and chaste life. He therefore
adds, that by their example they should train to temperance and gravity
those younger women whom the warmth of youth might otherwise lead into
imprudence.

<span id="v.iv.i-p27"></span>*To love their husbands and their children*
I do not agree with those who think that this is a recapitulation of the
advices which elderly women should give to those who are younger for a
careful perusal of the context will enable any one easily to perceive
that Paul goes on in explaining the duties of women, which apply equally
to those who are older. Besides, the construction would be
inappropriate, σωφρονίζωσι, σώφρονας εἶναι  <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) Yet while he instructs elderly females
what they ought to be, he at the same time holds out to the younger the
example which they ought to follow. Thus he indiscriminately teaches
both. In short, he wishes women to be restrained, by conjugal love and
affection for their children, from giving themselves up to licentious
attachments, he wishes them to rule their own house in a sober and
orderly manner, forbids them to wander about in public places, bids them
be chaste, and at the same time modest, so as to be subject to the
dominion of their husbands; for those who excel in other virtues
sometimes take occasion from them to act haughtily, so as to be
disobedient to their husbands.

<span id="v.iv.i-p29"></span><span id="v.iv.i-p29.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.i-p30"></span>When he adds, *that the word of God may not
be evil spoken of*, it is supposed that this relates strictly to women
who were married to unbelieving husbands, who might judge of the gospel
from the wicked conduct of their wives; and this appears to be confirmed
by <span id="v.iv.i-p30.1"></span>[1Pe
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#001.md)<span id="v.iv.i-p30.1"></span>.
But what if he does not speak of husbands alone? And, indeed, it is
probable that he demands such strictness of life as not to bring the
gospel into the contempt of the public by their vices. As to the other
parts of the verse, the reader will find them explained in the
Commentary on the First Epistle to Timothy.  <span
id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md)

<span id="v.iv.ii"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii-p1"></span><span id="v.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>[Titus
2:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#006.md)<span id="v.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii-p2"></span>**6.** Young men likewise exhort to be
sober minded.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p3"></span>**6.** Juvenes similiter hortare ut sobrii
sint

<span id="v.iv.ii-p4"></span>**7.** In all things shewing thyself a
pattern of good works: in doctrine *shewing* uncorruptness, gravity,
sincerity,

<span id="v.iv.ii-p5"></span>**7.** In omnibus to ipsum praebe exemplum
bonorum operum in doctrina integritatem gravitatem

<span id="v.iv.ii-p6"></span>**8.** Sound speech, that cannot be
condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having
no evil thing to say of you.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p7"></span>**8.** Sermonem sanum inreprehensibilem ut
is qui ex adverso est vereatur nihil habens malum dicere de nobis

<span id="v.iv.ii-p8"></span>**9.** *Exhort* servants to be obedient
unto their own masters, *and* to please *them* well in all *things*; not
answering again;

<span id="v.iv.ii-p9"></span>**9.** Servos dominis suis subditos esse in
omnibus placentes non contradicentes

<span id="v.iv.ii-p10"></span>**10.** Not purloining, but shewing all
good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in
all things.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p11"></span>**10.** Non fraudantes, sed in omnibus
fidem bonam ostendentes ut doctrinam salutaris nostri Dei ornent in
omnibus

<span id="v.iv.ii-p12"></span><span id="v.iv.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii-p13"></span>**6** *Exhort likewise younger men* He
merely enjoins that young men be instructed to be *temperate;* for
temperance, as Plato shows, cures the whole understanding of man. It is
as if he had said, “Let them be well regulated and obedient to reason.”

<span id="v.iv.ii-p14"></span><span id="v.iv.ii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii-p15"></span>**7.** *In all things shewing thyself* For
doctrine will otherwise carry little authority, if its power and majesty
do not shine in the life of the bishop,  <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) as in a mirror. He wishes, therefore,
that the teacher may be a pattern, which his scholars may copy.  <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md)

<span id="v.iv.ii-p18"></span>*A pattern of good works in doctrine,
uprightness, gravity* In the original Greek the style is here involved
and obscure, and this creates ambiguity. First, he makes use of the
words *in doctrine,* and then adds, in the accusative case, *integrity,
gravity, etc.*  <span id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) Without
mentioning the interpretations given by others, I shall state that which
appears to me to be the most probable. First, I connect these words, *of
good works in doctrine;* for, after having enjoined Titus that, in
teaching he shall inculcate the practice of good works, he wishes that
good works, which correspond to this doctrine, may be visible in his
life; and consequently the preposition *in* means that they shall be
suitable, or shall correspond, to the doctrine. What follows is in no
degree obscure; for; in order that he may exhibit a representation of
his doctrine in morals, he bids him be “upright and grave.”

<span id="v.iv.ii-p20"></span><span id="v.iv.ii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii-p21"></span>**8.** *Sound speech, unblamable*  <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244) “Sound speech” relates (in my opinion.md)
to ordinary life and familiar conversation; for it would be absurd to
interpret it as relating to public instruction, since he only wishes
that Titus, both in his actions and in his words, shall lead a life that
agrees with his preaching. He therefore enjoins that his words shall be
pure and free from all corruption.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p23"></span>*Unblamable* may apply either to the words
or the person of Titus. I prefer the latter view, that the other nouns
in the accusative case (which the Greek syntax easily allows) may depend
upon it in this sense — “that thou mayest shew thyself unblamable in
gravity, in integrity, and in sound words.”

<span id="v.iv.ii-p24"></span>*That the adversary may be ashamed*.
Although a Christian man ought to look at other objects, yet this must
not be neglected, to shut the mouth of wicked men, as we are everywhere
taught that we should give no occasion for slander. Everything that they
can seize on as improper in our conduct is maliciously turned against
Christ and his doctrine. The consequence is, that, through our fault,
the sacred name of God is exposed to insult. Accordingly, the more we
perceive that we are keenly observed by enemies, let us be the more
attentive to guard against their calumnies, and thus let their malignity
strengthen in us the desire of doing well.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p25"></span><span id="v.iv.ii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii-p26"></span>**9.** *Servants, that they be subject to
their masters* It has been already said that Paul merely glances at some
things by way of example, and does not explain the whole of these
subjects, as if he undertook, expressly, to handle them. Accordingly,
when he enjoins servants *to please their masters in all things,* this
desire of pleasing must be limited to those things which are proper; as
is evident from other passages of a similar nature, in which an
exception is expressly added, to the effect that nothing should be done
but according to the will of God.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p27"></span>It may be observed that the Apostle dwells
chiefly on this point, that they who are under the authority of others
shall be obedient and submissive. With good reason he does this, for
nothing is more contrary to the natural disposition of man than
subjection, and there was danger lest they should take the gospel as a
pretext for becoming more refractory, as reckoning it unreasonable that
they should be subject to the authority of unbelievers. So much the
greater care and diligence ought pastors to use for either subduing or
checking this rebellious spirit.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p28"></span><span id="v.iv.ii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.ii-p29"></span>**10** *Not thievish but shewing all good
faith* He censures two vices that are common among servants, petulant
replies, and a propensity to steal.  <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) The comedies are full of instances of
excessively ready talk, by which servants cheat their masters. Nor was
it without reason that an exchange of names took place in ancient times,
by which “servant “and “thief “became convertible terms. Thus prudence
requires that we make our instructions apply to the morals of each
individual.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p31"></span>By *faith* he means fidelity to their
masters; and therefore, to *shew all faith* is to act faithfully,
without using fraud or doing injury, in transacting the affairs of their
masters.

<span id="v.iv.ii-p32"></span>*That they may adorn the doctrine of God
our Savior in all things* This ought to be a very sharp spur of
exhortation to us, when we learn that our becoming conduct adorns the
doctrine of God, which, at the same time, is a mirror of his glory. And,
indeed, we see that this usually happens; as, on the other hand, our
wicked life brings disgrace upon it; for men commonly judge of us from
our works. But this circumstance ought also to be observed, that God
deigns to receive an “ornament” from shaves, whose condition was so low
and mean that they were wont to be scarcely accounted men; for he does
not mean “servants,” such as we have in the present day, but slaves,
 <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) who were bought with money, and
held as property, like oxen or horses. And if the life of those men is
an ornament to the Christian name, much more let those who are in honor
take care that they do not stain it by their baseness.

<span id="v.iv.iii"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iii-p1"></span><span id="v.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>[Titus
2:11-15](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#011.md)<span
id="v.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iii-p2"></span>**11.** For the grace of God that bringeth
salvation hath appeared to all men,

<span id="v.iv.iii-p3"></span>**11.** Apparuit enim gratia Dei salutaris
omnibus hominibus

<span id="v.iv.iii-p4"></span>**12.** Teaching us that, denying
ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and
godly, in this present world;

<span id="v.iv.iii-p5"></span>**12.** erudiens nos ut abnegantes
impietatem et saecularia desideria sobrie et iuste et pie vivamus in hoc
saeculo

<span id="v.iv.iii-p6"></span>**13.** Looking for that blessed hope, and
the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

<span id="v.iv.iii-p7"></span>**13.** expectantes beatam spem et
adventum gloriae magni Dei et salvatoris nostri Iesu Christi

<span id="v.iv.iii-p8"></span>**14.** Who gave himself for us, that he
might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar
people, zealous of good works.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p9"></span>**14.** qui dedit semet ipsum pro nobis ut
nos redimeret ab omni iniquitate et mundaret sibi populum acceptabilem
sectatorem bonorum operum

<span id="v.iv.iii-p10"></span>**15.** These things speak, and exhort,
and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p11"></span>**15.** haec loquere et exhortare et
argue cum omni imperio nemo to contemnat

<span id="v.iv.iii-p12"></span><span id="v.iv.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iii-p13"></span>**11** *For the grace of God*  <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) *hath appeared* He argues from the
design of redemption, which he shews to be a desire to live a godly and
upright life. Hence it follows, that the duty of a good teacher is
rather to exhort to a holy life than to occupy the minds of men with
useless questions. “He hath redeemed us,” says Zacharias in his song, —

<span id="v.iv.iii-p15"></span>“that we may serve him in holiness and
righteousness  
all the days of our life.” (<span id="v.iv.iii-p15.2"></span>[Luke
1:74](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#074.md),
[75](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#075)<span id="v.iv.iii-p15.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iv.iii-p16"></span>For the same reason Paul says, *the grace
of God hath appeared, teaching us;* for he means that it ought to hold
the place of instruction to us to regulate our life well. What is
proclaimed concerning the mercy of God is seized by some as all occasion
of licentiousness; while others are hindered by slothfulness from
meditating on “newness of life.” But the manifestation of the grace of
God unavoidably carries along with it exhortations to a holy life.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p17"></span>*Bringing salvation to all men,*  <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) That it is common to all is expressly
testified by him on account of the slaves of whom he had spoken. Yet he
does not mean individual men, but rather describes individual classes,
or various ranks of life. And this is not a little emphatic, that the
grace of God hath let itself down even to the race of slaves; for, since
God does not despise men of the lowest and most degraded condition, it
would be highly unreasonable that we should be negligent and slothful to
embrace his goodness.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p19"></span><span id="v.iv.iii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iii-p20"></span>**12** *Teaching us that, denying,
ungodliness* He now lays down the rule for regulating our life well, and
how we ought to begin, namely, with renouncing our former life, of which
he enumerates two parts, “ungodliness and worldly desires.” Under
*ungodliness,* I include not only superstitions, in which they had gone
astray, but irreligious contempt of God, such as reigns in men, till
they have been enlightened in the knowledge of the truth. Although they
have some profession of religion, yet they never fear and reverence God
sincerely and honestly, but, on the contrary, have consciences that are
useless, so that nothing is further from their thoughts than that they
ought to serve God.  <span id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md)

<span id="v.iv.iii-p22"></span>By *worldly desires*  <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) he means all the affections of the
flesh; because we look at nothing but the world, till the Lord has drawn
us to himself. Meditation on the heavenly life begins with regeneration.
Before we have been regenerated, our desires lean towards the world, and
rest on the world.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p24"></span>*That we may live temperately, and
righteously, and piously* As he formerly mentioned those three, when he
wished to give a comprehensive summary of Christian life, so he now
makes it to consist of those three, “piety, righteousness, and
temperance.” “Piety” is religion towards God. “Righteousness” has place
among men. He who is endowed with both of these lacks nothing for
perfect virtue; and, indeed, in the law of God there is absolute
perfection, to which nothing whatever can be added. But as the exercises
of godliness may be regarded as appendages to the first table, so
“temperance,” which Paul mentions in this passage, aims at nothing else
than keeping the law, and, as I said before about *patience,*  <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) is added to the former as a seasoning.
Nor does the Apostle contradict himself, when at one time he describes
patience, and at another time temperance, as the perfection of a holy
life; for they are not distinct virtues, since σωφροσύνη (here
translated temperance) includes patience under it.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p26"></span>He adds, *in this world,*  <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) because the Lord has appointed the
present life for the trial of our faith. Although the fruit of good
actions is not yet visible, yet the hope should be sufficient for
stimulating us to doing well; and this is what he immediately adds, —

<span id="v.iv.iii-p28"></span><span id="v.iv.iii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iii-p29"></span>**13** *Looking for that blessed hope*
From the hope of future immortality he draws an exhortation, and indeed,
if that hope be deeply seated in our mind, it is impossible that it
should not lead us to devote ourselves wholly to God. On the contrary,
they who do not cease to live to the world and to the flesh never have
actually tasted what is the worth of the promise of eternal life; for
the Lord, by calling us to heaven, withdraws us from the earth.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p30"></span>*Hope* is here put for the thing hoped
for, otherwise it would be an incorrect mode of expression. He gives
this appellation to the blessed life which is laid up for us in heaven.
At the same time he declares when we shall enjoy it, and what we ought
to contemplate, when we desire or think of our salvation.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p31"></span>*And the appearing of the glory of the
great God and Savior* I interpret the *glory of God,* to mean not only
that by which he shall be glorious in himself, but also that by which he
shall then diffuse himself on all *sides,* so as to make all his elect
partakers of it. He calls God great, because his greatness — which men,
blinded by the empty splendor of the world, now extenuate, and sometimes
even annihilate, as far as lies in their power — shall be fully
manifested on the last day. The luster of the world, while it appears
great to our eyes, dazzles them so much that “the glory of God” is, as
it were, hidden in darkness. But Christ, by his coming, shall chase away
all the empty show of the world — shall no longer obscure the
brightness, shall no longer lessen the magnificence, of his glory. True
the Lord demonstrates his majesty every day by his works; but because
men are prevented by their blindness from seeing it, it is said to be
hidden in obscurity. Paul wishes that believers may now contemplate by
faith that which shall be manifested on the last day, and therefore that
God may be magnified, whom the world either despises, or; at least, does
not esteem according to his excellence.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p32"></span>It is uncertain whether these words
should be read together thus, “the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
great God and our Savior,” or separately, as of the Father and the Son,
“the glory of the great God, and of our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.”
 <span id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) The Arians, seizing on this
latter sense, have endeavored to prove from it, that the Son is less
than the Father, because here Paul calls the Father “the great God” by
way of distinction from the Son. The orthodox teachers of the Church,
for the purpose of shutting out this slander, eagerly contended that
both are affirmed of Christ. But the Arians may be refuted in a few
words and by solid argument; for Paul, having spoken of the revelation
of the glory of “the great God,” immediately added “Christ,” in order to
inform us, that that revelation of glory will be in his person; as if he
had said that, when Christ shall appear, the greatness of the divine
glory shall then be revealed to us.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p34"></span>Hence we learn, first, that there is
nothing that ought to render us more active or cheerful in doing good
than the hope of the future resurrection; and, secondly, that believers
ought always to have their eyes fixed on it, that they may not grow
weary in the right course; for, if we do not wholly depend upon it, we
shall continually be carried away to the vanities of the world. But,
since the coming of the Lord to judgment might excite terror in us,
Christ is held out to us as our “Savior,” who will also be our judge.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p35"></span><span id="v.iv.iii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iii-p36"></span>**14** *Who gave himself for us*. This is
another argument of exhortation, drawn from the design or effect of the
death of Christ, who offered himself for us, that he might redeem us
from the bondage of sin, and purchase us to himself as his heritage. His
grace, therefore, necessarily brings along with it “newness of life,”
(<span id="v.iv.iii-p36.1"></span>[Ro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)<span id="v.iv.iii-p36.1"></span>,.md)
because they who still are the slaves of sin make void the blessing of
redemption; but now we are released from the bondage of sin, in order
that we may serve the righteousness of God; and, therefore, he
immediately added, —

<span id="v.iv.iii-p37"></span>*A peculiar people, zealous of good
works;* by which he means that, so far as concerns us, the fruit of
redemption is lost, if we are still entangled by the sinful desires of
the world. And in order to express more fully, that we have been
consecrated to good works by the death of Christ, he makes use of the
word *purify;* for it would be truly base in us to be again polluted by
the same filth from which the Son of God hath washed us by his blood.
 <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md)

<span id="v.iv.iii-p39"></span><span id="v.iv.iii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iii-p40"></span>**15** *Speak these things, and exhort,
and reprove* This conclusion is of the same meaning as if he enjoined
Titus to dwell continually on that doctrine of edification, and never to
grow weary, because it cannot be too much inculcated. He likewise bids
him add the spurs of “exhortations and reproofs;” for men are not
sufficiently admonished as to their duty, if they be not also vehemently
urged to the performance of it. He who understands those things which
the Apostle has formerly stated, and who has them always in his mouth,
will have ground not only for teaching, but likewise for correcting.

<span id="v.iv.iii-p41"></span>*With all authority* I do not agree with
Erasmus, who translates ἐπιταγή “diligence in commanding.” There is
greater probability in the opinion of Chrysostom who interprets it to
mean severity against more atrocious sins; through I do not think that
even he has hit the Apostle’s meaning; which is, that Titus should claim
authority and respect for himself in teaching these things. For men
given to curious inquiries, and eager about trifles, dislike the
commandments to lead a pious and holy life as being too common and
vulgar. In order that Titus may meet this disdain, he is enjoined to add
the weight of his authority to his doctrine. It is with the same view
(in my opinion) that he immediately adds, —

<span id="v.iv.iii-p42"></span>*Let no man despise thee* Others think
that Titus is instructed to gain the ear of men, and their respect for
him, by the integrity of his life; and it is indeed true that holy and
blameless conduct imparts authority to instruction. But Paul had another
object in view; for here he addresses the people rather than Titus.
Because many had ears so delicate, that they despised the simplicity of
the gospel; because they had such an itch for novelty, that hardly any
space was left for edification; he beats down the haughtiness of such
men, and strictly charges them to desist from despising, in any way,
sound and useful doctrine. This confirms the remark which I made at the
outset, that this Epistle was written to the inhabitants of Crete rather
than to any single individual.

<span id="v.iv.i-p15"></span> “Let the doctrine which proceeds from thy
mouth be sound. For he expressly uses this word, because it is the means
of upholding us in true integrity, that the word of God, which is
preached to us, be our spiritual pasture. This will not be perceived at
first sight, but such is the fact. And why do we not perceive it?
Because we are too sensual and earthly. For when we are in want of food
for our body, we are immediately terrified, we become alarmed, we have
not a moment of repose, for it touches us nearly. We are sensitive as to
this fading life, but we are insensible to all that affects our souls;
there is such brutal stupidity that we do not know our wants, though
they press heavily upon us. Yet let it be observed that there is nothing
but weakness in us, if we are not fed with the doctrine of God. And that
is the reason why it is called ‘sound,’ for in this consists the health
of our souls. As our bodies are kept in their proper condition by
well-regulated nourishment, so our souls are supported by that doctrine
which serves not only for nourishment but for medicine. For we are full
of vices which are worse than diseases; and therefore our soul must be
purged, and we must be healed of them. The method of doing this is, that
we profit by the word of God. And so it is not without good reason that
Paul gives to it this designation, that it is ‘sound,’ or that it is
‘wholesome.’” — *Fr. Ser.*

virtue; for it was well said by Socrates, (Ap. Stob. p. 488,) εὐσέβεια

likewise by his example, when it shall be known that he speaks in
sincerity, and not in hypocrisy, that he may be edified by it. And would
to God that this were duly observed; for the truth of God would be
received with greater reverence than it is. But however that may be, we
shall not be held excused, since God wishes to make use *of us* so as to
regulate others, and to direct our life in such a manner that, when they
shall follow as with one accord, we may strive to honor God, and give no
occasion to despise the sacred word, since God has made us instruments,

those of whom he was speaking. For the slaves who were in that age were
addicted to pillage; and besides, they were contradictory, as if they
had not dreaded the strokes with which they were chastised. We find that
they sometimes grew hardened, because their masters did not use them
gently, but treated them as brute beasts, struck them, teased them, put
them to the torture, and frequently beat them, when they were absolutely
naked, so that the blood flowed on all sides. Being thus hardened to
evil, we must not be astonished if they had such corruption as to take
revenge on their masters when they had any opportunity. But now Paul
does not fail to exhort them to please their masters, that is, in
everything that was good and right — an exception which he makes in
other passages” — *Fr. Ser.*

<span id="v.iv.iii-p14"></span> “We have seen that we ought to preach
daily that grace which was declared at the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ. This is a wonderful mystery, that *God was manifested in the
flesh*, and that, at the same time, he hath shewn to us his heavenly
glory, that we may be united to it. In this manner all pastors ought to
be employed; for when they shall unceasingly illustrate that wisdom
which God hath declared to us in the person of his Son, it is certain
that the time will not be lost. And this is what Paul says in another
passage, (<span id="v.iv.iii-p14.1"></span>[Eph
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#018.md)<span
id="v.iv.iii-p14.1"></span>,) that it is the height, and depth, and
length, and breadth, and thickness of all knowledge. When we shall have
extended our views to explore as far as possible — when we shall descend
into the depth to search out all that is concealed from us — when we
shall go beyond the length and breadth of the sea, we shall have a
wisdom (he says) as high and as deep, as long and as broad as this: when
we shall know the infinite love of God which God hath showed to us in
the person of his only begotten Son.” — *Fr. Ser.*

<span id="fn_248"></span>[249](cc43021.htm#fr_248.md) <span
id="v.iv.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iii-p18"></span> “We now see why Paul speaks of all men,
and thus we may judge of the folly of some who pretend to expound the
Holy Scriptures, and do not understand their style, when they say, ‘And
God wishes that every person should be saved; the grace of God hath
appeared for the salvation of every person; it follows, then, that there
is free-will, that there is no election, that none have been
predestinated to salvation.’ If those men spoke it ought to be with a
little more caution. Paul did not mean in this passage, or in <span
id="v.iv.iii-p18.1"></span>[1Ti
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md)<span id="v.iv.iii-p18.1"></span>,
anything else than that the great are called by God, though they are
unworthy of it; that men of low condition, though they are despised, are
nevertheless adopted by God, who stretches out his hand to receive them.
At that time, because kings and magistrates were mortal enemies of the
gospel, it might be thought that God had rejected them, and that they
cannot obtain salvation. But Paul says that the door must not be shut
against them, and that, eventually, God may choose some of this company,
though their case appear to be desperate. Thus, in this passage, after
speaking of the poor slaves who were not reckoned to belong to the rank
of men, he says that God did not fail, on that account, to show himself
compassionate towards them, and that he wishes that the gospel should be
preached to those to whom men do not deign to utter a word. Here is a
poor man, who shall be rejected by us, we shall hardly say, God bless
him! and God addresses him in an especial manner, and declares that he
is his Father, and does not merely say a passing word, but stops him to
say, ‘Thou art of my flock, let my word be thy pasture, let it be the
spiritual food of thy soul.’ Thus we see that this word is highly
significant, when it is said that the grace of God hath appeared fully
to all men.” — *Fr. Ser.*

<span id="v.iv.iii-p21"></span> “It presents us with the strongest
motives to obedience. ‘The grace of God teacheth us to deny
ungodliness.’ What chains bind faster and closer than love? Here is love
to our nature in his incarnation, love to us, though enemies, in his
death and passion: encouragements to obedience by the proffers of pardon
for former rebellions. By the disobedience of man God introduces his
redeeming grace, and engages his creature to more ingenuous and
excellent returns than his innocent state could oblige him to. In his
created state he had goodness to move him, he hath the same goodness now
to oblige him as a creature, and a greater love and mercy to oblige him
as a repaired creature; and the terror of justice is taken off, which
might envenom his heart as a criminal. In his revolted state he had
misery to discourage him; in his redeemed state he hath love to attract
him. Without such a way, black despair had seized upon the creature
exposed to a remediless misery, and God would have had no returns of
love from the best of his earthly works; but if any sparks of ingenuity
be left, they will be excited by the efficacy of this argument.” —

<span id="v.iv.iii-p33"></span> “Of these words the most natural sense,
and that required by the ‘<span id="v.iv.iii-p33.1"></span>proprietas
linguae,’ is, beyond all doubt, the one assigned by almost all the
ancients from Clem. Alex. downwards, and by the early modern expositors,
as Erasmus, Grotius, and Beza, and also by some eminent expositors and
theologians of later times, as Bishops Pearson and Bull, Wolff,
Matthaei, and Bishop Middleton, namely, ‘Looking for (or rather, looking
forward to; comp. <span id="v.iv.iii-p33.2"></span>[Job
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#009.md)<span id="v.iv.iii-p33.2"></span>,
and see Grotius) the blessed hope, even the glorious appearing of our
great God and Savior Jesus Christ.’ The cause of the ambiguity in our
common version is ably pointed out, and the above version established on
the surest grounds, by Bishop Middleton and Professor Scholefield. But,
besides the argument founded on the ‘propriety of language,’ that of
Beza, who urges that ἐπιφάνεια is nowhere used of God, but Christ, is
unanswerable. So in an able critique on Dr. Channing’s works, in the
British Critic, the Reviewer justly maintains that ‘Christ must be the
God here spoken of, because it is his “glorious appearing” which all
Christians here are said to expect, but of God the Father we are
expressly told that him “no man hath seen, nor can see.”’ Other
convincing arguments for the construction here laid down may be seen in
Dr. Routh’s Reliquiae Sacrae, vol. 2, p. 26. The reader is also
particularly referred to Clem. Alex. Colhort. ad Gentes, sub init.,
where verses 11-14 are cited by that Father, and the view of Σωτὢρος
here maintained is adopted. The whole of the context there is deserving
of great attention, as containing such plain and repeated attestations
to the divinity of Jesus Christ as can rarely be found. The passage
itself may be seen in Bishop Bull’s Def Fid. Nic., p. 87.” —
*Bloomfield.*

<span id="fn_254"></span>[255](cc43021.htm#fr_254.md) <span
id="v.iv.iii-p37.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv.iii-p38"></span> “Christ expiated sin, not encouraged it;
he died to make your peace, but he died to make you holy; ‘to purify a
people to himself,’ (<span id="v.iv.iii-p38.1"></span>[Titus
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.iv.iii-p38.1"></span>.) The ends of Christ’s death cannot be
separated. He is no atoner, where he is not a refiner. It is as certain
as any word the mouth of God hath spoken, that ‘there is no peace to the
wicked,’ (<span id="v.iv.iii-p38.2"></span>[Isa
48:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#022.md)<span
id="v.iv.iii-p38.2"></span>.) A guilty conscience, and an impure, will
keep up the amity with Satan and enmity with God. He that allows himself
in any sin deprives himself of the benefit of reconciliation. This
reconciliation must be mutual; as God lays down his wrath against us, so
we must throw down our arms against him. As there was a double enmity,
one rooted in nature, another declared by wicked works; or rather, one
enmity in its root, and another in its exercise, (<span
id="v.iv.iii-p38.3"></span>[Col
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#021.md)<span
id="v.iv.iii-p38.3"></span>,) so there must be an alteration of state,
and an alteration of acts.” — *Charnock.*
