<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p3"></A><b>2 </b>To Philemon our friend and fellow-laborer, and to Apphia the beloved, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church which is in thy house.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p4"></A><b>3 </b>Grace (be) to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p5"></A><b>4 </b>I give thanks to my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p6"></A><b>5 </b>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus and towards all saints,</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p7"></A><b>6 </b>That the communication of thy faith may be effectual, by the knowledge of every good thing which is in thee towards Christ Jesus.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p8"></A><b>7 </b>For we have much grace (<i>or, joy</i>) and consolation on account of thy love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iv.i-p9"></A><b>8 </b>Wherefore, while I have great confidence in Christ to command thee what is proper, yet for love&#8217;s sake I rather entreat thee;</p>
