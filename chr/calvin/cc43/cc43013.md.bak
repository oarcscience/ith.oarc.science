<span id="iv.ii-p2"></span>ON THE

<span id="iv.ii-p3"></span>SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY

<span id="iv.ii-p4"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="iv.ii.i"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.i-p1.1"></span>[2 Timothy
1:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.ii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.i-p2"></span>**1**. Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by
the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ
Jesus,

<span id="iv.ii.i-p3"></span>**1**. Paulus apostolus Iesu Christi per
voluntatem Dei, secundum promissionem vitae, quae est in Christo Iesu,

<span id="iv.ii.i-p4"></span>**2**. To Timothy, *my* dearly beloved son:
Grace, mercy; *and* peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our
Lord.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p5"></span>**2**. Timotheo dilecto filio gratia,
misericordia, pax a Deo Patre, et Christo Iesu Domino nostro.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p6"></span><span id="iv.ii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.i-p7"></span>**1** *Paul an Apostle* From the very
preface we already perceive that Paul had not in view Timothy alone;
other wise he would not have employed such lofty titles in asserting his
apostleship; for what purpose would it have served to employ these
ornaments of language in writing to one who was fully convinced of the
fact? He, therefore, lays claim to that authority over all which
belonged to his public character and he does this the more diligently,
because, being near death, he wishes to secure the approbation of the
whole course of his ministry,  <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md)
and to seal his doctrine which he had labored so hard to teach, that it
may be held sacred by posterity, and to leave a true portrait of it in
Timothy.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p9"></span>*Of Jesus Christ by the will of God* First,
according to his custom, he calls himself an “Apostle of Christ.” Hence
it follows, that he does not speak as a private person, and must not be
heard slightly, and for form’s sake,  <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) like a man, but as one who is a
representative of Christ. But because the dignity of the office is too
great to belong to any man, except by the special gift and election of
God, he at the same time pronounces a eulogy on his calling, by adding
that he was ordained by *the will of God* His apostleship, therefore,
having God for its author and defender, is beyond all dispute.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p11"></span>*According to the promise of life* That
his calling may be the more certain, he connects it with the promises of
eternal life; as if he had said, “As from the beginning God promised
eternal life in Christ, so now he has appointed me to be the minister
for proclaiming that promise.” Thus also he points out the design of his
apostleship, namely, to bring men to Christ, that in him they may find
life.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p12"></span>*Which is in Christ Jesus* He speaks with
great accuracy, when he mentions that “the promise of life” was indeed
given, in ancient times, to the fathers. (<span
id="iv.ii.i-p12.1"></span>[Ac
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006)<span id="iv.ii.i-p12.1"></span>..md)
But yet he declares that this life is in Christ, in order to inform us
that the faith of those who lived under the Law must nevertheless have
looked towards Christ; and that *life,* which was contained in promises,
was, in some respects, suspended, till it was exhibited in Christ.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p13"></span><span id="iv.ii.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.i-p14"></span>**2** *My beloved son* By this designation
he not only testifies his love of Timothy, but procures respect and
submission to him; because he wishes to be acknowledged in him, as one
who may justly be called his son,  <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) The reason of the appellation is, that
he had begotten him in Christ; for, although this honor belongs to God
alone, yet it is also transferred to ministers, whose agency he employs
for regenerating us.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p16"></span>*Grace, mercy* The word *mercy*, which he
employs here, is commonly left out by him in his ordinary salutations. I
think that he introduced it, when he poured out his feelings with more
than ordinary vehemence. Moreover, he appears to have inverted the
order; for, since “mercy” is the cause of “grace,” it ought to have come
before it in this passage. But still it is not unsuitable that it should
be put after “grace”, in order to express more clearly what is the
nature of that grace, and whence it proceeds; as if he had added, in the
form of a declaration, that the reason why we are loved by God is, that
he is merciful. Yet this may also be explained as relating to God’s
daily benefits, which are so many testimonies of his “mercy”; for,
whenever he assists us, whenever he delivers us from evils, pardons our
sins, and bears with our weakness, he does so, because he has compassion
on us.

<span id="iv.ii.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>[2 Timothy
1:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p2"></span>**3**. I thank God, whom I serve from *my*
forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have
remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p3"></span>**3**. Gratias ago Deo, quem colo a
progenitoribus in conscientia, ut assiduam tui mentionem facio in
pecibus meis die et noctu,

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p4"></span>**4**. Greatly desiring to see thee, being
mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p5"></span>**4**. Desiderans to videre, memor tuarum
lacrymarum, ut gaudio implear,

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p6"></span>**5**. When I call to remembrance the
unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother
Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p7"></span>**5**. Memoria repetens eam, quae in to
est, sinceram fidem, quae et habitavit primum in avia tua Loide, et in
matre tua Eunice; persuasum habeo quòd etiam in to.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p8"></span><span id="iv.ii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p9"></span>**3** *I give thanks* The meaning usually
assigned to these words is, that Paul “gives thanks to God,” and next
assigns the cause or ground of thanksgiving; namely, that he is
unceasingly mindful of Timothy. But let my readers consider whether the
following sense do not suit equally well and even better: “Whenever I
remember thee in my prayers, (and I do so continually,) I also give
thanks concerning thee;” for the particle ὡς most frequently has that
meaning;  <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) and, indeed, any
meaning that can be drawn from a different translation is exceedingly
meager. According to this exposition, prayer will be a sign of
carefulness, and thanksgiving a sign of joy; that is, he never thought
of Timothy without calling to remembrance the eminent virtues with which
he was adorned. Hence arises ground of thanksgiving; for the
recollection of the gifts of God is always pleasant and delightful to
believers. Both are proofs of real friendship. He calls the *mention* of
him (ἀδιάλειπτον) *unceasing,* because he never forgets him when he
prays.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p11"></span>*Whom I worship from my ancestors* This
declaration he made in opposition to those well-known calumnies with
which the Jews everywhere loaded him, as if he had forsaken the religion
of his country, and apostatized from the law of Moses. On the contrary,
he declares that he worships God, concerning whom he had been taught by
his ancestors, that is, the God of Abraham, who revealed himself to the
Jews, who delivered his law by the hand of Moses; and not some pretended
God, whom he had lately made for himself.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p12"></span>But here it may be asked, “Since Paul
glories in following the religion handed down from his ancestors, is
this a sufficiently solid foundation? For hence it follows, that this
will be a plausible presence for excusing all superstitions, and that it
will be a crime, if any one depart, in the smallest degree, from the
institutions of his ancestors, whatever these are.” The answer is easy.
He does not here lay down a fixed rule, that every person who follows
the religion that he received from his fathers is believed to worship
God aright, and, on the other hand, that he who departs from the custom
of his ancestors is at all to blame for it. For this circumstance must
always be taken into account, that Paul was not descended from
idolaters, but from the children of Abraham, who worshipped the true
God. We know what Christ says, in disapproving of all the false worship
of the Gentiles, that the Jews alone maintained the true method of
worship. Paul, therefore, does not rest solely on the authority of the
fathers, nor does he speak indiscriminately of all his ancestors; but he
removes that false opinion, with which he knew that he was unjustly
loaded, that he had forsaken the God of Israel, and framed for himself a
strange god.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p13"></span>*In a pure conscience* It is certain that
Paul’s conscience was not always pure; for he acknowledges that he was
deceived by hypocrisy, while he gave loose reins to sinful desire.
 <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) (<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p14.2"></span>[Ro
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p14.2"></span>..md)
The excuse which Chrysostom offers for what Paul did while he was a
Pharisee, on the ground that he opposed the gospel, not through malice,
but through ignorance, is not a satisfactory reply to the objection; for
“a pure conscience” is no ordinary commendation, and cannot be separated
from the sincere and hearty fear of God. I, therefore, limit it to the
present time, in this manner, that he worships the same God as was
worshipped by his ancestors, but that now he worships him with pure
affection of the heart, since the time when he was enlightened by the
gospel.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p15"></span>This statement has the same object with
the numerous protestations of the apostles, as recorded in the Acts of
the Apostles:

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p16"></span>“I serve the God of my fathers, believing
all things that are written in the law and in the prophets.” (<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p16.1"></span>[Ac
24:14](../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p16.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p17"></span>Again,

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p18"></span>“And now I stand to be judged concerning
the hope of the promise which was made to our fathers, to which hope our
twelve tribes hope to come.” (<span id="iv.ii.ii-p18.1"></span>[Ac
26:6](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p18.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p19"></span>Again,

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p20"></span>“On account of the hope of Israel I am
bound with this chain.” (<span id="iv.ii.ii-p20.1"></span>[Ac
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p20.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p21"></span>*In my prayers night and day* Hence we
see how great was his constancy in prayer; and yet he affirms nothing
about himself but what Christ recommends to all his followers. We ought,
therefore, to be moved and inflamed by such examples to imitate them, so
far, at least, that an exercise so necessary may be more frequent among
us. If any one understand this to mean the daily and nightly prayers
which Paul was wont to offer at stated hours, there will be no
impropriety in that view; though I give a more simple interpretation,
that there was no time when he was not employed in prayer.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p22"></span><span id="iv.ii.ii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p23"></span>**5** *Calling to remembrance that
unfeigned faith* Not so much for the purpose of applauding as of
exhorting Timothy, the Apostle commends both his own faith and that of
his grandmother and mother; for, when one has begun well and valiantly,
the progress he has made should encourage him to advance, and domestic
examples are powerful excitements to urge him forward. Accordingly, he
sets before him *his grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice,* by whom he
had been educated from his infancy in such a manner that he might have
sucked godliness along with his milk. By this godly education,
therefore, Timothy is admonished not to degenerate from himself and from
his ancestors.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p24"></span>It is uncertain whether, on the one hand,
these women were converted to Christ, and what Paul here applauds was
the commencement of faith, or whether, on the other hand, faith is
attributed to them apart from Christianity. The latter appears to me
more probable; for, although at that time everything abounded with many
superstitions and corruptions, yet God had always his own people, whom
he did not suffer to be corrupted with the multitude, but whom he
sanctified and separated to himself, that there might always exist among
the Jews a pledge of this grace, which he had promised to the seed of
Abraham. There is, therefore, no absurdity in saying that they lived and
died in the faith of the Mediator, although Christ had not yet been
revealed to them. But I do not assert anything, and could not assert
without rashness.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p25"></span>*And I am persuaded that in thee also*
This clause confirms me in the conjecture which I have just now stated;
for, in my opinion, he does not here speak of the present faith of
Timothy. It would lessen that sure confidence of the former eulogium, if
he only said that he reckoned the faith of Timothy to resemble the faith
of his grandmother and mother. But I understand the meaning to be, that
Timothy, from his childhood, while he had not yet obtained a knowledge
of the gospel, was imbued with the fear of God, and with such faith as
proved to be a living seed, which afterwards manifested itself.

<span id="iv.ii.iii"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>[2
Timothy 1:6-12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p2"></span>**6**. Wherefore I put thee in
remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the
putting on of my hands.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p3"></span>**6**. Propterea commonefacio to, ut
exsuscites donum Dei, quod in to est, per impositionem manuum mearum

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p4"></span>**7**. For God hath not given us the
spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p5"></span>**7**. Non enim dedit nobis Deus spiritum
timiditatis, sed pontenia et dilectionis et sobrietatis.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p6"></span>**8**. Be not thou therefore ashamed of
the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker
of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p7"></span>**8**. Non ergo to pudeat testimonii
Domini nostri, neque mei, qui sum vinctus ipsius; sed esto particeps
aflictionum Evangelii, secundum potentiam Dei,

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p8"></span>**9**. Who hath saved us, and called *us*
with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his
own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the
world began,

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p9"></span>**9**. Qui nos servavit ac vocavit
vocatione sancta; non secundum opera nostra, sed secundum propositum
suum et gratiam, quae data fuit nobis in Christo Iesu ante tempora
saecularia

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p10"></span>**10**. But is now made manifest by the
appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and
hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p11"></span>**10**. Revelata autem nunc fuit per
apparitionem Servatoris nostri Iesu Christi, qui mortem quidem abolevit,
illuminavit autem vitam et immortalitatem per Evangelium

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p12"></span>**11**. Whereunto I am appointed a
preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p13"></span>**11**. In quod positus sum ego praeco
et apostolus et Doctor Gentium,

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p14"></span>**12**. For the which cause I also
suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I
have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I
have committed unto him against that day.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p15"></span>**12**. Quam etiam ob causam haec
patior, sed non pudefio; novi enim, cui crediderim, et persuasus sum
quod potens sit, depositum meum servare in diem illum.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p16"></span><span id="iv.ii.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p17"></span>**6** *For which cause I advise thee*
The more abundantly that Timothy had received the grace of God, the more
attentive (the Apostle intimates) he ought to be in making progress from
day to day. It deserves notice that the words “for which cause”
introduce this advice as a conclusion from what has been already said.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p18"></span>*To stir up the gift of God*. This
exhortation is highly necessary; for it usually happens, and may be said
to be natural, that the excellence of gifts produces carelessness, which
is also accompanied by sloth; and Satan continually labors to extinguish
all that is of God in us. We ought, therefore, on the other hand, to
strive to bring to perfection everything that is good in us, and to
kindle what is languid; for the metaphor, which Paul employs, is taken
from a fire which was feeble, or that was in course of being gradually
extinguished, if strength and flame were not added, by blowing upon it
and by supplying new fuel. Let us therefore remember that we ought to
apply to use the gifts of God, lest, being unemployed and concealed,
they gather rust. Let us also remember that we should diligently profit
by them, lest they be extinguished by our slothfulness.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p19"></span>*Which is in thee by the laying on of my
hands* There can be no doubt that Timothy was invited by the general
voice of the Church, and was not elected by the private wish of Paul
alone; but there is no absurdity in saying, that Paul ascribes the
election to himself personally, because he was the chief actor in it.
Yet here he speaks of ordination, that is, of the solemn act of
conferring the office of the ministry, and not of election. Besides, it
is not perfectly clear whether it was the custom, when any minister was
to be set apart, that all laid their hands on his head, or that one only
did so, in the room and name of all. I am more inclined to the
conjecture, that it was only one person who laid on his hands.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p20"></span>So far as relates to the ceremony, the
apostles borrowed it from an ancient custom of their nation; or rather,
in consequence of its being in use, they retained it; for this is a part
of that decent and orderly procedure which Paul elsewhere recommends.
(<span id="iv.ii.iii-p20.1"></span>[1Co
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p20.1"></span>.) Yet it may be doubted if that “laying on
of hands” which is now mentioned refers to ordination; because, at that
time, the graces of the Spirit, of which he speaks in the 12th chapter
of the Epistle to the Romans (<span id="iv.ii.iii-p20.2"></span>[Ro
12](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#000)<span id="iv.ii.iii-p20.2"></span>.md),
and in the 13th of the First Epistle to the Corinthians (<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p20.3"></span>[1Co
13](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#000)<span id="iv.ii.iii-p20.3"></span>.md),
were bestowed on many others who were not appointed to be pastors. But,
for my own part, I think that it may be easily inferred from the former
Epistle, that Paul here speaks of the office of a pastor, for this
passage agrees with that,

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p21"></span>“Do not neglect the grace which was
given to thee with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.” (<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p21.1"></span>[1Ti
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p21.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p22"></span>That point being settled, it is asked,
“Was grace given by the outward sign?” To this question I answer,
whenever ministers were ordained, they were recommended to God by the
prayers of the whole Church, and in this manner grace from God was
obtained for them by prayer, and was not given to them by virtue of the
sign, although the sign was not uselessly or unprofitably employed, but
was a sure pledge of that grace which they received from God’s own hand.
That ceremony was not a profane act, invented for the sole purpose of
procuring credit in the eyes of men, but a lawful consecration before
God, which is not performed but by the power of the Holy Spirit.
Besides, Paul takes the sign for the whole matter or the whole
transaction; for he declares that Timothy was endued with grace, when he
was offered to God as a minister. Thus in this mode of expression there
is a figure of speech, in which a part is taken for the whole.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p23"></span>But we are again met by another
question; for if it was only at his ordination that Timothy obtained the
grace necessary for discharging his office, of what nature was the
election of a man not yet fit or qualified, but hitherto void and
destitute of the gift of God? I answer, it was not then so given to him
that he had it not before; for it is certain that he excelled both in
doctrine and in other gifts before Paul ordained him to the ministry.
But there is no inconsistency in saying, that, when God wished to make
use of his services, and accordingly called him, he then fitted and
enriched him still more with new gifts, or doubled those which he had
previously bestowed. It does not therefore follow that Timothy had not
formerly any gift, but it shone forth the more when the duty of teaching
was laid upon him.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p24"></span><span id="iv.ii.iii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p25"></span>**7** *For God hath not given to us a
spirit of cowardice* It is a confirmation of what he had said
immediately before; and thus he continues to urge Timothy to display the
power of the gifts which he had received. He makes use of this argument,
that God governs his ministers by *the Spirit of power,* which is the
opposite of *cowardice.* Hence it follows, that they ought not to lie
down through slothfulness, but, sustained by great confidence and
cheerfulness, should exhibit and display, by visible effects, that power
of the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p26"></span>The following passage occurs in the
Epistle to the Romans:

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p27"></span>“For we have not received a spirit of
bondage, to be again in terror; but we have received the spirit of
adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.” (<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p27.1"></span>[Ro
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p27.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p28"></span>That passage is, at first sight, nearly
similar to this; but yet the context shews that the meaning is
different. There he treats of the confidence of adoption which all
believers have; but here he speaks particularly about ministers, and
exhorts them, in the person of Timothy, to arouse themselves actively to
deeds of valor; because God does not wish them to perform their office
in a cold and lifeless manner, but to press forward powerfully, relying
on the efficacy of the Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p29"></span>*But of power, and of love, and of
soberness* Hence we are taught, first, that not one of us possesses that
firmness and unshaken constancy of the Spirit, which is requisite for
fulfilling our ministry, until we are endued from heaven with a new
power. And indeed the obstructions are so many and so great, that no
courage of man will be able to overcome them. It is God, therefore, who
endues us with “the spirit of power;” for they who, in other respects,
give tokens of much strength, fall down in a moment, when they are not
upheld by the power of the Divine Spirit.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p30"></span>Secondly, we gather from it, that they
who have slavish meanness and cowardice, so that they do not venture to
do anything in defense of the truth, when it is necessary, are not
governed by that Spirit by whom the servants of Christ are guided. Hence
it follows, that there are very few of those who bear the title of
ministers, in the present day, who have the mark of sincerity impressed
upon them; for, amongst a vast number, where do we find one who, relying
on the power of the Spirit, boldly despises all the loftiness which
exalts itself against Christ? Do not almost all seek their own interest
and their leisure? Do they not sink down dumb as soon as any noise
breaks out? The consequence is, that no majesty of God is seen in their
ministry. The word *Spirit* is here employed figuratively, as in many
other passages.  <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p32"></span>But why did he afterwards add *love* and
*soberness?* In my opinion, it was for the purpose of distinguishing
that power of the Spirit from the fury and rage of fanatics, who while
they rush forward with reckless impulse, fiercely boast of having the
Spirit of God. For that reason he expressly states that this powerful
energy is moderated by “soberness and love,” that is, by a calm desire
of edifying. Yet Paul does not deny that prophets and teachers were
endued with the same Spirit before the publication of the gospel; but he
declares that this grace ought now to be especially powerful and
conspicuous under the reign of Christ.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p33"></span><span id="iv.ii.iii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p34"></span>**8** *Be not ashamed, therefore* He
said this, because the confession of the gospel was accounted infamous;
and therefore he forbids that either ambition or the fear of disgrace
shall prevent or retard him from the liberty of preaching the gospel.
And he infers this from what has been already said; for he who is armed
with the power of God will not tremble at the noise raised by the world,
but will reckon it honorable that wicked men mark them with disgrace.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p35"></span>And justly does he call the gospel *the
testimony of our Lord;* because, although he has no need of our
assistance, yet he lays upon us this duty, that we shall give
“testimony” to him for maintaining his glory. It is a great and
distinguished honor which he confers upon us, and, indeed, upon all,
(for there is no Christian that ought not to reckon himself a witness of
Christ,) but chiefly pastors and teachers, as Christ said to the
apostles, —

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p36"></span>“Ye shall be witnesses to me,” (<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p36.1"></span>[Ac
1:8](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p36.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p37"></span>Accordingly, the more hateful the
doctrine of the gospel is in the world, the more earnestly should they
labor to confess it openly.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p38"></span>When he adds, *nor of me*; by this word
he reminds Timothy not to refuse to be his companion, as in a cause
common to both of them; for, when we begin to withdraw from the society
of those who, for the name of Christ, suffer persecution, what else do
we seek than that the gospel shall be free from all persecution? Now,
though there were not wanting many wicked men who thus ridiculed
Timothy, — “Do you not see what has befallen your master? Do you not
know that the same reward awaits you also? Why do you press upon us a
doctrine which you see is hissed at by the whole world?” — still he must
have been cheered by this exhortation, — “You have no reason to be
ashamed of me, in that which is not shameful, for I am *Christ’s
prisoner;”* that is, “Not for any crime or evil deed, but for his name I
am kept in prison.”

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p39"></span>*But be thou a partaker of the
afflictions of the gospel* He lays down a method by which that which he
enjoins may be done; that is, if Timothy shall prepare himself for
enduring the afflictions which are connected with the gospel. Whosoever
shall revolt at and shrink from the cross will always be ashamed of the
gospel. Not without good reason, therefore, does Paul, while he exhorts
to boldness of confession, in order that he may not exhort in vain,
speak to him also about bearing the cross.  <span
id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p41"></span>He adds, *according to the power of
God;* because, but for this, and if he did not support us, we should
immediately sink under the load. And this clause contains both
admonition and consolation. The admonition is, to turn away his eyes
from his present weakness, and, relying on the assistance of God, to
venture and undertake what is beyond his strength. The consolation is,
that, if we endure anything on account of the gospel, God will come
forth as our deliverer, that by his power, we may obtain the victory.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p42"></span><span id="iv.ii.iii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p43"></span>**9** *Who hath saved us* From the
greatness of the benefit he shews how much we owe to God; for the
salvation which he has bestowed on us easily swallows up all the evils
that must be endured in this world. The word *saved,* though it admit of
a general signification, is here limited, by the context, to denote
eternal salvation. So then he means that they who, having obtained
through Christ not a fading or transitory, but an eternal salvation,
shall spare their fleeting life or honor rather than acknowledge their
Redeemer; are excessively ungrateful.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p44"></span>*And hath called us with a holy calling*
He places the sealing of salvation  <span
id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) in the *calling;* for, as the
salvation of men was completed in the death of Christ, so God, by the
gospel, makes us partakers of it. In order to place in a stronger light
the value of this “calling,” he pronounces it to be *holy.* This ought
to be carefully observed, because, as salvation must not be sought
anywhere but in Christ; so, on the other hand, he would have died and
risen again without any practical advantage, unless so far as he calls
us to a participation of this grace. Thus, after having procured
salvation for us, this second blessing remains to be bestowed, that,
ingrafting us into his body, he may communicate his benefits to be
enjoyed by us.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p46"></span>*Not according to our works, but
according to his purpose and grace* He describes the source both of our
calling and of the whole of our salvation. We had not works by which we
could anticipate God; but the whole depends on his gracious purpose and
election; for in the two words *purpose* and *grace* there is the figure
of speech called Hypallage,  <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) and
the latter must have the force of an objection, as if he had said, —
“according to his gracious purpose.” Although Paul commonly employs the
word “purpose” to denote the secret decree of God, the cause of which is
in his own power, yet, for the sake of fuller explanation, he chose to
add “grace,” that he might more clearly exclude all reference to works.
And the very contrast proclaims loudly enough that there is no room for
works where the grace of God reigns, especially when we are reminded of
the election of God, by which he was beforehand with us, when we had not
yet been born. On this subject I have spoken more fully in my exposition
of the first chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians; and at present I
do nothing more than glance briefly at that which I have there treated
more at large.  <span id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p49"></span>*Which was given to us* From the order
of time he argues, that, by free grace, salvation was given to us which
we did not at all deserve; for, if God chose us before the creation of
the world, he could not have regard to works, of which we had none,
seeing that we did not then exist. As to the cavil of the sophists, that
God was moved by the works which he foresaw, it does not need a long
refutation. What kind of works would those have been if God had passed
us by, seeing that the election itself is the source and beginning of
all good works?

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p50"></span>This *giving* of grace, which he
mentions, is nothing else than predestination, by which we were adopted
to be the sons of God. On this subject I wished to remind my readers,
because God is frequently said actually to “give” his grace to us when
we receive the effect of it. But here Paul sets before us what God
purposed with himself from the beginning. He, therefore, gave that
which, not induced by any merit, he appointed to those who were not yet
born, and kept laid up in his treasures, until he made known by the fact
itself that he purposeth nothing in vain.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p51"></span>*Before eternal ages* He employs this
phrase in the same sense in which he elsewhere speaks of the
uninterrupted succession of years from the foundation of the world.
(<span id="iv.ii.iii-p51.1"></span>[Titus
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p51.1"></span>.) For that ingenious reasoning which
Augustine conducts in many passages is totally different from Paul’s
design. The meaning therefore is, — “Before times began to take their
course from all past ages.” Besides, it is worthy of notice, that he
places the foundation of salvation in Christ; for, apart from him, there
is neither adoption nor salvation; as was indeed said in expounding the
first chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p52"></span><span id="iv.ii.iii-p52.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p53"></span>**10** *But hath now been revealed by
the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ* Observe how appropriately he
connects the faith which we have from the gospel within God’s secret
election, and assigns to each of them its own place. God has now called
us by the gospel, not because he has suddenly taken counsel about our
salvation, but because he had so determined from all eternity. Christ
hath now “appeared”  <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) for our
salvation, not because the power of saving has been recently bestowed on
him, but because this grace was laid up in him for us before the
creation of the world. The knowledge of those things is revealed to us
by faith; and so the Apostle judiciously connects the gospel with the
most ancient promises of God, that novelty may not render it
contemptible.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p55"></span>But it is asked; “Were the fathers under
the Law ignorant of this grace?” for if it was not revealed but by the
coming of Christ, it follows that, before that time, it was concealed. I
reply, Paul speaks of the full exhibition of the thing itself on which
depended also the faith of the fathers, so that this takes nothing from
them. The reason why Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and all
believers, obtained the same faith with us, was, that they placed their
confidence in this “appearance.” Thus, when he says that “grace hath
been revealed to us by the appearing of Christ,” he does not exclude
from communion with that grace the fathers who are made partakers with
us of this appearing by the same faith. Christ (<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p55.1"></span>[Heb
13:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p55.1"></span>) was yesterday as he is today; but he did
not manifest himself to us, by his death and resurrection, before the
time appointed by the Father. To this, as the only pledge and
accomplishment of our salvation, both our faith and that of the fathers
look with one accord.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p56"></span>*Who hath indeed destroyed death* When
he ascribes to the gospel the manifestation of life, he does not mean
that we must begin with the word, leaving out of view the death and
resurrection of Christ, (for the word, on the contrary, rests on the
subject-matter,) but he only means that the fruit of this grace comes to
men in no other way than by the gospel, in accordance with what is said,

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p57"></span>“God was in Christ, reconciling the
world to himself, and hath committed to us the ministry of
reconciliation.”  
(<span id="iv.ii.iii-p57.2"></span>[2Co
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p57.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p58"></span>*And hath brought to light life and
immortality by the gospel* It is a high and remarkable commendation of
the gospel, that it “bringeth life to light.” To *life* he adds
*immortality;* as if he had said, “a true and immortal life.” But,
perhaps, it may be thought better, that by *life* we understand
regeneration, that is followed by a blessed *immortality* which is also
the object of hope. And, indeed, this is our “life,” not that which we
have in common with brute beasts, but that which consists in partaking
of the image of God. But because in this world

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p59"></span>“it doth not appear” (<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p59.1"></span>[1Jo
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002)<span id="iv.ii.iii-p59.1"></span>.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p60"></span>what is the nature, or what is the value
of that “life,” for the sake of more full expression he has most
properly added, “immortality,” which is the revelation of that life
which is now concealed.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p61"></span><span id="iv.ii.iii-p61.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p62"></span>**11** *To which I have been appointed*
Not without good reason does he so highly commend the gospel along with
his apostleship. Satan labors, beyond all things else, to banish from
our hearts, by every possible method, the faith of sound doctrine; and
as it is not always easy for him to do this if he attack us in open war,
he steals upon us by secret and indirect methods; for, in order to
destroy the credibility of doctrine, he holds up to suspicion the
calling of godly teachers.  <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md)
Paul, therefore, having death before his eyes, and knowing well the
ancient and ordinary snares of Satan, determined to assert not only the
doctrine of the gospel in general, but his own calling. Both were
necessary; for, although there be uttered long discourses concerning the
dignity of the gospel, they will not be of much avail to us, unless we
understand what is the gospel. Many will agree as to the general
principle of the undoubted authority of the gospel, who afterwards will
have nothing certain that they can follow. This is the reason why Paul
expressly wishes to be acknowledged to be a faithful and lawful minister
of that life-giving doctrine which he had mentioned.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p64"></span>*A herald, and an apostle, and a teacher
of the Gentiles* For the reasons now stated, he adorns himself with
various titles for expressing one and the same thing. He calls himself a
*herald,* whose duty it is, to publish the commands of princes and
magistrates. The word *apostle* is here used in its ordinary and
restricted meaning. Moreover, because there is a natural relation
between a *teacher* and his disciples, he takes to himself also this
third name, that they who learn from him may know that they have a
master who has been appointed to them by God. And to whom does he
declare that he was appointed? To the *Gentiles;* for the main hinge of
the controversy was about them, because the Jews denied that the
promises of life belonged to any others than to the fleshly children of
Abraham. In order, therefore, that the salvation of the Gentiles may not
be called in question, he affirms that to them he has been especially
sent by God.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p65"></span><span id="iv.ii.iii-p65.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p66"></span>**12** *For which cause also I suffer
these things* It is well known that the rage of the Jews was kindled
against Paul, for this reason more than any other, that he made the
gospel common to the Gentiles. Yet the phrase *for which cause* relates
to the whole verse, and therefore must not be limited to the last clause
about “the Gentiles.”

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p67"></span>*But I am not ashamed* That the prison
in which he was bound might not in any degree lessen his authority, he
contends, on the contrary, by two arguments. First, he shows that the
cause, far from being disgraceful, was even honorable to him; for he was
a prisoner, not on account of any evil deed, but because he obeyed God
who called him. It is an inconceivable consolation, when we are able to
bring a good conscience in opposition to the unjust judgments of men.
Secondly, from the hope of a prosperous issue he argues that there is
nothing disgraceful in his imprisonment. He who shall avail himself of
this defense will be able to overcome any temptations, however great
they may be. And when he says, that he “is not ashamed,” he stimulates
others, by his example, to have the same courage.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p68"></span>*For I know whom I have believed* This
is the only place of refuge, to which all believers ought to resort,
whenever the world reckons them to be condemned and ruined men; namely,
to reckon it enough that God approves of them; for what would be the
result, if they depended on men? And hence we ought to infer how widely
faith differs from opinion; because, when Paul says, “I know whom I have
believed,” he means that it is not enough if you believe, unless you
have the testimony of God, and unless you have full certainty of it.
Faith, therefore, neither leans on the authority of men, nor rests on
God, in such a manner as to hesitate, but must be joined with knowledge;
otherwise it would not be sufficiently strong against the innumerable
assaults of Satan. He who with Paul enjoys this knowledge, will know, by
experience, that, on good grounds, our faith is called

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p69"></span>“the victory that overcometh the world,”
(<span id="iv.ii.iii-p69.1"></span>[1Jo
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004)<span id="iv.ii.iii-p69.1"></span>.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p70"></span>and that on good grounds, it was said by
Christ,

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p71"></span>“The gates of hell shall not prevail
against it.”  
(<span id="iv.ii.iii-p71.2"></span>[Mt
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p71.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p72"></span>Amidst every storm and tempest, that man
will enjoy undisturbed repose, who has a settled conviction that God,

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p73"></span>“who cannot lie,” (<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p73.1"></span>[Titus
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002)<span id="iv.ii.iii-p73.1"></span>.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p74"></span>or deceive, hath spoken, and will
undoubtedly perform what he hath promised. On the other hand, he who has
not this truth sealed on his heart, will be continually shaken hither
and thither like a reed.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p75"></span>This passage is highly worthy of
attention; because it expresses admirably the power of faith, when it
shows that, even in desperate affairs, we ought to give to God such
glory as not to doubt that he will be true and faithful; and when it
likewise shows that we ought to rely on the word as fully as if God had
manifested himself to us from heaven; for he who has not this conviction
understands nothing. Let us always remember that Paul does not pursue
philosophical speculations in the shade, but, having the reality before
his eyes, solemnly declares, how highly valuable is a confident hope of
eternal life.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p76"></span>*And am persuaded that he is able*
Because the power and greatness of dangers often fill us with dismay, or
at least tempt our hearts to distrust, for this reason we must defend
ourselves with this shield, that there is sufficient protection in the
power of God. In like manner Christ, when he bids us cherish confident
hope, employs this argument,

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p77"></span>“The Father, who gave you to me, is
greater than all,”  
(<span id="iv.ii.iii-p77.2"></span>[Joh
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p77.2"></span>)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p78"></span>by which he means, that we are out of
danger, seeing that the Lord, who hath taken us under his protection, is
abundantly powerful to put down all opposition. True, Satan does not
venture to suggest this thought in a direct form, that God cannot
fulfill, or is prevented from fulfilling, what he has promised, (for our
senses are shocked by so gross a blasphemy against God,) but, by
preoccupying our eyes and understandings, he takes away from us all
sense of the power of God. The heart must therefore be well purified, in
order that it may not only taste that power, but may retain the taste of
it amidst temptations of every kind.

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p79"></span>Now, whenever Paul speaks of the power
of God, understand by it what may be called his actual or (ἐνεργουμένμν)
“effectual” power, as he calls it elsewhere. (<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p79.1"></span>[Col
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p79.1"></span>) Faith always connects the power of God
with the word, which it does not imagine to be at a distance, but,
having inwardly conceived it, possesses and retains it. Thus it is said
of Abraham:

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p80"></span>“He did not hesitate or dispute, but
gave glory to God, being fully convinced that what he had promised he
was able also to perform,” (<span id="iv.ii.iii-p80.1"></span>[Rom.
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iii-p80.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p81"></span>*What I have intrusted to him* Observe
that he employs this phrase to denote eternal life; for hence we
conclude, that our salvation is in the hand of God, in the same manner
as there are in the hand of a depository those things which we deliver
to him to keep, relying on his fidelity. If our salvation depended on
ourselves,  <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) to how many dangers
would it be continually exposed? But now it is well that, having been
committed to such a guardian, it is out of all danger.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p14"></span><span id="iv.ii.iv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p15"></span>**13** *Hold the form of sound words*
Some explain it thus: “Let thy doctrine be, as it were, a pattern which
others may imitate.” I do not approve of that view. Equally removed from
Paul’s meaning is Chrysostom’s exposition, that Timothy should have at
hand the image of virtues engraven on his heart by Paul’s doctrine. I
rather think that Paul commands Timothy to hold fast the doctrine which
he had learned, not only as to substance, but as to the very form of
expression; for ὑποτύπωσις — the word which Paul employs on this
occasion — denotes a lively picture of objects, as if they were actually
placed before the eyes. Paul knew how ready men are to depart or fall
off from pure doctrine. For this reason he earnestly cautions Timothy
not to turn aside from that form of teaching which he had received, and
to regulate his manner of teaching by the rule which had been laid down;
not that we ought to be very scrupulous about words, but because to
misrepresent doctrine, even in the smallest degree, is exceedingly
injurious.  <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md)

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p17"></span>Hence we see what kind of theology there
is in Popery, which has degenerated so far from the pattern which Paul
recommends, that it resembles the riddles of diviners or soothsayers
rather than a doctrine taken from the word of God. What taste of Paul’s
writings, I ask, is there in all the books of the schoolmen? This
licentiousness in corrupting doctrine shews that there are great reasons
why Paul invites Timothy to hold fast the original and natural form. And
he contrasts *sound words* not only with doctrines manifestly wicked,
but within useless questions, which, instead of health, bring nothing
but disease.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p18"></span>*In faith and love, which is in Christ
Jesus* I am aware that the preposition ἐν, agreeably to the idiom of the
Hebrew language, <span id="iv.ii.iv-p18.1"></span>ב is often taken for
*with;* but here, I think, the meaning is different Paul has added this
as a mark of sound doctrine, in order that we may know what it contains,
and what is the summary of it, the whole of which, according to his
custom, he includes under “faith and love.” He places both of them *in
Christ;* as, indeed, the knowledge of Christ consists chiefly of these
two parts; for, although the words, *which is,* are in the singular
number, agreeing with the word *love,* yet it must also be understood as
applying *to faith.*

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p19"></span>Those who translate it, “*with* faith and
love,” make the meaning to be, that Timothy should add to sound doctrine
the affections of piety and love. I do acknowledge that no man can
persevere faithfully in sound doctrine unless he is endued with true
faith and unfeigned love. But the former exposition, in my opinion, is
more appropriate, namely, that Paul employs these terms for describing
more fully what is the nature of “sound words” and what is the subject
of them. Now he says that the summary consists in “faith and love” of
which the knowledge of Christ is the source and beginning.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p20"></span><span id="iv.ii.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p21"></span>**14** *Keep the excellent thing
committed to thee* This exhortation is more extensive than the
preceding. He exhorts Timothy to consider what God has given to him, and
to bestow care and application in proportion to the high value of that
which has been committed; for, when the thing is of little value, we are
not wont to call any one to so strict an account.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p22"></span>By “that which hath been committed,” I
understand him to mean both the honor of the ministry and all the gifts
with which Timothy was endued. Some limit it to the ministry alone; but
I think that it denotes chiefly the qualifications for the ministry,
that is, all the gifts of the Spirit, in which he excelled. The word
“committed” is employed also for another reason, to remind Timothy that
he must, one day, render an account; for we ought to administer
faithfully what God has committed to us.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p23"></span>Τὸ Καλόν  <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) denotes that which is of high or
singular value; and, therefore, Erasmus has happily translated it (<span
id="iv.ii.iv-p24.2"></span>*egregium*) “excellent,” for the sake of
denoting its rare worth. I have followed that version. But what is the
method of keeping it? It is this. We must beware lest we lose by our
indolence what God has bestowed upon us, or lest it be taken away,
because we have been ungrateful or have abused it; for there are many
who reject the grace of God, and many who, after having received it,
deprive themselves of it altogether. Yet because the difficulty of
keeping it is beyond our strength, he therefore adds, —

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p25"></span>*By the Holy Spirit* As if he had said,
“I do ask from thee more than thou canst, for what thou hast not from
thyself the Spirit of God will supply to thee.” Hence it follows, that
we must not judge of the strength of men from the commandments of God;
because, as he commands by words, so he likewise engraves his words on
our hearts, and, by communicating strength, causes that his command
shall not be in vain.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p26"></span>*Who dwelleth in us*  <span
id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) By this he means, that the assistance
of the Holy Spirit is present to believers, provided that they do not
reject it when it is offered to them.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p28"></span><span id="iv.ii.iv-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p29"></span>**15** *Thou knowest that all that are in
Asia have forsaken me* Those apostasies which he mentions might have
shaken the hearts of many, and given rise, at the same time, to many
suspicions; as we commonly look at everything in the worst light. Paul
meets scandals of this kind with courage and heroism, that all good men
may learn to abhor the treachery of those who had thus deserted the
servant of Christ, when he alone, at the peril of his life, was
upholding the common cause; and that they may not on that account give
way, when they learn that Paul is not left destitute of divine
assistance.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p30"></span>*Of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes* He
names two of them, who were probably more celebrated than the rest, that
he may shut the door against their slanders; for it is customary with
revolters and deserters from the Christian warfare,  <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) in order to excuse their own baseness,
to forge as many accusations as they can against the good and faithful
ministers of the gospel. “Phygellus and Hermogenes,” knowing that their
cowardice was justly reckoned infamous by believers, and that they were
even condemned as guilty of base treachery, would not have hesitated to
load Paul with false accusations, and impudently to attack his
innocence. Paul, therefore, in order to take away all credit from their
lies, brands them with the mark which they deserve.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p32"></span>Thus also, in the present day, there are
many who, because they are not here admitted into the ministry, or are
stripped of the honor on account of their wickedness,  <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) or because we do not choose to support
them while they do nothing, or because they have committed theft or
fornication, are compelled to fly, and forthwith wander through France
and other countries, and, by throwing upon us all the accusations  <span
id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) that they can, borrow from them an
attestation of their innocence. And some brethren are so silly as to
accuse us of cruelty, if any of us paints such persons in their true
colors. But it were to be wished that all of them had their forehead
marked with a hot iron, that they might be recognized at first sight.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p35"></span><span id="iv.ii.iv-p35.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p36"></span>**16** *May the Lord grant mercy* From
this prayer we infer, that the good offices done to the saints are not
thrown away, even though they cannot recompense them; for, when he prays
to God to reward them, this carries in it the force of a promise. At the
same time, Paul testifies his gratitude, by desiring that God will grant
the remuneration, because he is unable to pay. What if he had possessed
abundant means of remuneration? Undoubtedly he would have manifested
that he was not ungrateful.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p37"></span>*To the family of Onesiphorus, for he
often refreshed me* It is worthy of attention, that although he praises
the kindness of *Onesiphorus* alone, yet, on his account, he prays for
mercy to the whole *family* Hence we infer, that “the blessing of God
rests, not only on the head of the righteous man,” but on all his house.
So great is the love of God toward his people, that it diffuses itself
over all who are connected with them.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p38"></span>*And was not ashamed of my chain* This is
a proof, not only of his liberality, but likewise of his zeal; seeing
that he cheerfully exposed himself to danger and to the reproach of men,
in order to assist Paul.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p39"></span><span id="iv.ii.iv-p39.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p40"></span>**18** *May the Lord grant to him* Some
explain it thus: — “May God grant to him that he may find mercy with
Christ the Judge.” And, indeed, this is somewhat more tolerable than to
interpret that passage in the writings of Moses:

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p41"></span>“The Lord rained fire from the Lord,”
(<span id="iv.ii.iv-p41.1"></span>[Ge
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iv-p41.1"></span>,)

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p42"></span>as meaning, — “The Father rained from the
Son.”  <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) Yet it is possible that
strong feeling may have prompted Paul, as often happens, to make a
superfluous repetition.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p44"></span>*That he may find mercy with the Lord on
that day*  <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) This prayer shews us
how much richer a recompense awaits those who, without the expectation
of an earthly reward, perform kind offices to the saints, than if they
received it immediately from the hand of men. And what does he pray for?
“That he may find mercy;” for he who hath been merciful to his neighbors
will receive such mercy from God to himself. And if this promise does
not powerfully animate and encourage us to the exercise of kindness, we
are worse than stupid. Hence it follows, also, that when God rewards us,
it is not on account of our merits or of any excellence that is in us;
but that the best and most valuable reward which he bestows upon us is,
when he pardons us, and shews himself to be, not a stern judge, but a
kind and indulgent Father.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p8"></span> “Although, in all that Paul has left us in
writing, we must consider that it is God who speaks to us by the mouth
of a mortal man, and that all his doctrine ought to be received with
such authority and reverence as if God visibly appeared from heaven, yet
still there is in this epistle a special object to be kept in view, that
Paul, being in prison and perceiving his death to be at hand, wished to
ratify his faith, as if he had sealed it with his blood. So then, as
often as we read this epistle, let the condition in which Paul was at
that time come before our eyes, namely, that he was looking for nothing
but to die for the testimony of the gospel (which he actually did) as
its standard-bearer, in order to give us stronger assurance of his
doctrine, and that will affect us in a more lively manner. Indeed, if we
read this epistle carefully, we shall find that the Spirit of God has
expressed himself in it in such a manner, with such majesty and power,
that we are constrained to be captivated and overwhelmed. For my own
part, I know that this epistle has been more profitable to me than any
other book of Scripture, and still is profitable to me every day; and if
any person shall examine it carefully, there can be no doubt that he
will experience the same effect. And if we desire to have a testimony of
the truth of God, which pierces our heart, we may well fix on this
epistle; for a man must be in a profound sleep, and remarkably stupid,
if God do not work in his soul, when he hears the doctrine that shall be
drawn from it.”-*Fr. Ser.*

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p40"></span> “He shews, in the first place, that the
gospel cannot be without afflictions. Not that God does not call all men
to unity in the faith, and the doctrine of the gospel is the message of
reconciliation; but yet, on the one hand, there are those who are drawn
by the power of his Holy Spirit, while unbelievers remain in their
hardness; and, on the other hand, there is the fire that is kindled, as,
when thunders are generated in the air, there must be great troubles, so
is it when the gospel is preached. And now, if the gospel brings
afflictions, and if our Lord Jesus Christ wishes that what he endured in
his person shall be fulfilled in his members, and that every day he
shall be, as it were, crucified, is it lawful for us to withdraw from
that condition? Since, therefore, all our hope lies in the gospel, and
since we ought to lean upon it, let us ponder what Paul says, that we
must lend support to our brethren, when we see that they are assailed,
that men trample them under their feet, spit in their face, and insult
them, let us choose to be their companions for enduring the reproaches
and base conduct of the world, rather than to be honored, to be in good
reputation and credit, and yet to be estranged from those who suffer for
the cause which we have in common with them.” — *Fr. Ser.*

possession of the benefits which we have received from his hand? True,
the devil will labor to deprive us of it, but, as our souls will not be
a prey to him, because our Lord Jesus Christ has taken them under his
protection, having been committed to him by God the Father; so nothing
that God has appointed for our salvation will be a prey to Satan. And
why? Because we have the Spirit to defend us against all his efforts.
And where is that Spirit? We must not go to seek him above the clouds.
It is true that he fills the whole earth, and that his majesty dwells
above the heavens; but if we feel that he dwells in us, since he has
been pleased to exercise his power on such poor creatures as we are, let
us know that that power will be sufficient for defending us against the
assaults of Satan; that is, provided that we, on our part, are not
negligent. For we must not flatter ourselves in our sins, so as to be
careless, but must pray to God, committing everything to him, and hoping
that he will always strengthen us more and more. And because he has
begun to make us ministers of his grace, let us know that he will
continue, and in such a way that our salvation and that of our
neighbor’s shall always be carried forward more and more to his
glory.”-*Fr. Ser.*

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p45"></span> “No Christian can read this passage
without being powerfully affected by it; for we see that Paul was, as it
were, transported, when he spoke of that coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and of the final resurrection. He does not say, “May the Lord
grant that he may find favor at his coming, on the day of our
redemption, when he shall appear again to judge the world!” But he says,
“On that day;” as if he presented the Lord Jesus visibly, with his
angels. Paul did not speak those things coldly, or like a man, but he
rose above all men, that he might be able to exclaim, “That day, that
day!” And where is it? True, none of those who wish to be wise in
themselves will take any pains to find it; for that saying must be
fulfilled, — “Eye hath not seen, ears have not heard, neither hath
entered into the heart of man, what God hath prepared for them that love
him.” (<span id="iv.ii.iv-p45.1"></span>[Isa
64:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iv-p45.1"></span>.) Let men task their powers to the utmost to
know it, it will be to them a dark and mysterious thing, and they will
not be able to approach to it. But when we shall embrace the promise
which he hath given to us, and after having known that Christ, being
risen from the dead, displayed his power, not for his own sake, but to
gather together all his members, and to unite them to himself, then
shall we be able truly to say, *That day.”-Fr. Ser.*
