<span id="iii.iv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="iii.iv.i"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i-p1"></span><span id="iii.iv.i-p1.1"></span>[1 Timothy
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.iv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i-p2"></span>**1**. I exhort therefore, that, first of
all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, *and* giving of thanks, be
made for all men;

<span id="iii.iv.i-p3"></span>**1**. Adbortor igitur, ut ante omnia
fiant deprecationes, obsecrationes, interpellationes, gratiarum actiones
pro omnibus hominibus,

<span id="iii.iv.i-p4"></span>**2.** For kings, and *for* all that are
in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all
godliness and honesty.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p5"></span>**2**. Pro regibus et omnibus in eminentia
constitutis, ut placidam et quietam vitam degamus cum omni pietate et
honestate.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p6"></span>**3**. For this *is* good and acceptable
in the sight of God our Saviour;

<span id="iii.iv.i-p7"></span>**3**. Hoc enim bonum et acceptum coram
Salvatore nostro Deo,

<span id="iii.iv.i-p8"></span>**4**. Who will have all men to be saved,
and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p9"></span>**4**. Qui omnes homines vult salvos
fieri, et ad agnitionem veritatis venire.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p10"></span><span id="iii.iv.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i-p11"></span>**1** *I exhort therefore*. These
exercises of godliness maintain and even strengthen us in the sincere
worship and fear of God, and cherish the good conscience of which he had
spoken. Not inappropriately does he make use of the word *therefore*, to
denote an inference; for those exhortations depend on the preceding
commandment.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p12"></span>*That, above all, prayers be made*.
First, he speaks of public prayers, which he enjoins to be offered, not
only for believers, but for all mankind. Some might reason thus with
themselves: “Why should we be anxious about the salvation of
unbelievers, with whom we have no connection? Is it not enough, if we,
who are brethren, pray mutually for our brethren, and recommend to God
the whole of his Church? for we have nothing to do with strangers.” This
perverse view Paul meets, and enjoins the Ephesians to include in their
prayers all men, and not to limit them to the body of the Church.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p13"></span>What is the difference between three out
of the four kinds which Paul enumerates, I own that I do not thoroughly
understand. The view given by Augustine, who twists Paul’s words so as
to denote ceremonial observances customary at that time, is quite
childish. A simpler exposition is given by those who think that
“requests” are when we ask to be delivered from what is evil; “prayers,”
when we desire to obtain something profitable; and “supplications,” when
we deplore before God injuries which we have endured. Yet for my own
part, I do not draw the difference so ingeniously; or, at least, I
prefer another way of distinguishing them.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p14"></span>Προσευχαὶ is the Greek word for every
kind of prayer; and δεήσεις denotes those forms of petitions in which
something definite is asked. In this way the two words agree with each
other, as genus and species. ᾿Εντεύξεις is the word commonly used by
Paul to signify those prayers which we offer for one another. The word
used for it in the Latin Translation is “<span
id="iii.iv.i-p14.1"></span>intercessiones,” *intercessions*. Yet Plato,
in his second dialogue, styled Alcibiades, uses it in a different sense,
to moan a definite petition offered by a person for himself; and in the
very inscription of the book, and in many passages, he shows plainly, as
I have said, that προσευχὴ is a general term.  <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md)

<span id="iii.iv.i-p16"></span>But not to dwell longer than is proper on
a matter that is not essential, Paul, in my own opinion, simply enjoins
that, whenever public prayers are offered, petitions and supplications
should be made *for all men*, even for those who at present are not at
all related to us. And yet this heaping up of words is not superfluous;
but Paul appears to me purposely to join together three terms for the
same purpose, in order to recommend more warmly, and urge more strongly,
earnest and constant prayer. We know now sluggish we are in this
religious duty; and therefore we need not wonder if, for the purpose of
arousing us to it, the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of Paul, employs
various excitements.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p17"></span>*And thanksgivings*. As to this term,
there is no obscurity; for, as he bids us make supplication to God for
the salvation of unbelievers, so also to give thanks on account of their
prosperity and success. That wonderful goodness which he shews every
day, when

<span id="iii.iv.i-p18"></span>“he maketh his sun to rise on the good
and the bad,”  
(<span id="iii.iv.i-p18.2"></span>[Mt
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md)<span
id="iii.iv.i-p18.2"></span>,)

<span id="iii.iv.i-p19"></span>is worthy of being praised; and our love
of our neighbor ought also to extend to those who are unworthy of it.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p20"></span><span id="iii.iv.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i-p21"></span>**2** *For kings* He expressly mentions
kings and other magistrates because, more than all others, they might be
hated by Christians. All the magistrates who existed at that time were
so many sworn enemies of Christ; and therefore this thought might occur
to them, that they ought not to pray for those who devoted all their
power and all their wealth to fight against the kingdom of Christ, the
extension of which is above all things desirable. The apostle meets this
difficulty, and expressly enjoins Christians to pray for them also. And,
indeed, the depravity of men is not a reason why God’s ordinance should
not be loved. Accordingly, seeing that God appointed magistrates and
princes for the preservation of mankind, however much they fall short of
the divine appointment, still we must not on that account cease to love
what belongs to God, and to desire that it may remain in force. That is
the reason why believers, in whatever country they live, must not only
obey the laws and the government of magistrates, but likewise in their
prayers supplicate God for their salvation. Jeremiah said to the
Israelites,

<span id="iii.iv.i-p22"></span>“Pray for the peace of Babylon, for in
their peace ye shall have peace.” (<span id="iii.iv.i-p22.1"></span>[Jer
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.iv.i-p22.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.i-p23"></span>The universal doctrine is this, that we
should desire the continuance and peaceful condition of those
governments which have been appointed by God.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p24"></span>*That we may lead a peaceful and quiet
life* By exhibiting the advantage, he holds out an additional
inducement, for he enumerates the fruits which are yielded to us by a
well regulated government. The first is a *peaceful life*; for
magistrates are armed with the sword, in order to keep us in peace. If
they did not restrain the hardihood of wicked men, every place would be
full of robberies and murders. The true way of maintaining peace,
therefore, is, when every one obtains what is his own, and the violence
of the more powerful is kept under restraint.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p25"></span>*With all godliness and decency* The
second fruit is the preservation of *godliness*, that is, when
magistrates give themselves to promote religion, to maintain the worship
of God, and to take care that sacred ordinances be observed with due
reverence. The third fruit is the care of public *decency*; for it is
also the business of magistrates to prevent men from abandoning
themselves to brutal filthiness or flagitious conduct, but, on the
contrary, to promote decency and moderation. If these three things are
taken away, what will be the condition of human life? If, therefore, we
are at all moved by solicitude about the peace of society, or godliness,
or decency, let us remember that we ought also to be solicitous about
those through whose agency we obtain such distinguished benefits.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p26"></span>Hence we conclude, that fanatics, who
wish to have magistrates taken away, are destitute of all humanity, and
breathe nothing but cruel barbarism. How different is it to say, that we
ought to pray for kings, in order that justice and decency may prevail,
and to say, that not only the name of kingly power, but all government,
is opposed to religion! We have the Spirit of God for the Author of the
former sentiment, and therefore the latter must be from the Devil.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p27"></span>If any one ask, Ought we to pray for
kings, from whom we obtain none of these advantages? I answer, the
object of our prayer is, that, guided by the Spirit of God, they may
begin to impart to us those benefits of which they formerly deprived us.
It is our duty, therefore, not only to pray for those who are already
worthy, but we must pray to God that he may make bad men good. We must
always hold by this principle, that magistrates were appointed by God
for the protection of religion, as well as of the peace and decency of
society, in exactly the same manner that the earth is appointed to
produce food.  <span id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) Accordingly, in like
manner as, when we pray to God for our daily bread, we ask him to make
the earth fertile by his blessing; so in those benefits of which we have
already spoken, we ought to consider the ordinary means which he has
appointed by his providence for bestowing them.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p29"></span>To this must be added, that, if we are
deprived of those benefits the communication of which Paul assigns to
magistrates, that is through our own fault. It is the wrath of God that
renders magistrates useless to us, in the same manner that it renders
the earth barren; and, therefore, we ought to pray for the removal of
those chastisements which have been brought upon us by our sins.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p30"></span>On the other hand, princes, and all who
hold the office of magistracy, are here reminded of their duty. It is
not enough, if, by giving to every one what is due, they restrain all
acts of violence, and maintain peace; but they must likewise endeavor to
promote religion, and to regulate morals by wholesome discipline. The
exhortation of David (<span id="iii.iv.i-p30.1"></span>[Ps
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012)<span id="iii.iv.i-p30.1"></span>.md)
to “kiss the Son,” and the prophecy of Isaiah, that they shall be
nursing — fathers of the Church, (<span id="iii.iv.i-p30.2"></span>[Isa
49:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023.md)<span
id="iii.iv.i-p30.2"></span>,) are not without meaning; and, therefore,
they have no right to flatter themselves, if they neglect to lend their
assistance to maintain the worship of God.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p31"></span><span id="iii.iv.i-p31.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i-p32"></span>**3** *For this is good and acceptable
before God*. After having taught that what he enjoined is useful, he now
brings forward a stronger argument — that it pleases God; for when we
know what is His will, this ought to have the force of all possible
reasons. By *good* he means what is proper and lawful; and, since the
will of God is the rule by which all our duties must be regulated, he
proves that it is right because it pleases God.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p33"></span>This passage is highly worthy of
observation; and, first, we draw from it the general doctrine, that the
true rule for acting well and properly is to look to the will of God,
and not to undertake anything but what he approves. Next, there is
likewise laid down a rule for godly prayer, that we should follow God as
our leader, and that all our prayer should be regulated by his will and
command. If due force had been allowed to this argument, the prayers of
Papists, in the present day, would not have abounded with so many
corruptions. For how will they prove that they have the authority of God
for having recourse to dead men as their intercessors, or for praying
for the dead? In short, in all their form of prayer, what can they point
out that is pleasing to God?

<span id="iii.iv.i-p34"></span><span id="iii.iv.i-p34.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i-p35"></span>**4** *Who wishes that all men may be
saved*. Here follows a confirmation of the second argument; and what is
more reasonable than that all our prayers should be in conformity with
this decree of God?

<span id="iii.iv.i-p36"></span>*And may come to the acknowledgment of
the truth*. Lastly, he demonstrates that God has at heart the salvation
of all, because he invites all to the acknowledgment of his truth. This
belongs to that kind of argument in which the cause is proved from the
effect; for, if

<span id="iii.iv.i-p37"></span>“the gospel is the power of God for
salvation to every one that believeth,” (<span
id="iii.iv.i-p37.1"></span>[Ro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iv.i-p37.1"></span>,)

<span id="iii.iv.i-p38"></span>it is certain that all those to whom the
gospel is addressed are invited to the hope of eternal life. In short,
as the calling is a proof of the secret election, so they whom God makes
partakers of his gospel are admitted by him to possess salvation;
because the gospel reveals to us the righteousness of God, which is a
sure entrance into life.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p39"></span>Hence we see the childish folly of those
who represent this passage to be opposed to predestination. “If God” say
they, “wishes all men indiscriminately to be saved, it is false that
some are predestined by his eternal purpose to salvation, and others to
perdition.” They might have had some ground for saying this, if Paul
were speaking here about individual men; although even then we should
not have wanted the means of replying to their argument; for, although
the will of God ought not to be judged from his secret decrees, when he
reveals them to us by outward signs, yet it does not therefore follow
that he has not determined with himself what he intends to do as to
every individual man.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p40"></span>But I say nothing on that subject,
because it has nothing to do with this passage; for the Apostle simply
means, that there is no people and no rank in the world that is excluded
from salvation; because God wishes that the gospel should be proclaimed
to all without exception. Now the preaching of the gospel gives life;
and hence he justly concludes that God invites all equally to partake
salvation. But the present discourse relates to classes of men, and not
to individual persons; for his sole object is, to include in this number
princes and foreign nations. That God wishes the doctrine of salvation
to be enjoyed by them as well as others, is evident from the passages
already quoted, and from other passages of a similar nature. Not without
good reason was it said, “Now, kings, understand,” and again, in the
same Psalm,

<span id="iii.iv.i-p41"></span>“I will give thee the Gentiles for an
inheritance, and the ends of the earth for a possession.” (<span
id="iii.iv.i-p41.1"></span>[Ps
2:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iv.i-p41.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.i-p42"></span>In a word, Paul intended to shew that it
is our duty to consider, not what kind of persons the princes at that
time were, but what God wished them to be. Now the duty arising out of
that love which we owe to our neighbor is, to be solicitous and to do
our endeavor for the salvation of all whom God includes in his calling,
and to testify this by godly prayers.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p43"></span>With the same view does he call *God our
Savior*; for whence do we obtain salvation but from the undeserved
kindness of God? Now the same God who has already made us partakers of
salvation may sometime extend his grace to them also. He who hath
already drawn us to him may draw them along with us. The Apostle takes
for granted that God will do so, because it had been thus foretold by
the predictions of the prophets, concerning all ranks and all nations.

<span id="iii.iv.ii"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p1"></span><span id="iii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>[1
Timothy 2:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p2"></span>**5**. For *there is* one God, and one
mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p3"></span>**5**. Unus enim Deus, unus et Mediator
Dei et hominum, homo Christus Iesus,

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p4"></span>**6**. Who gave himself for all, to be
testified in due time.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p5"></span>**6**. Qui dedit semetipsum pretium
redemtionis pro omnibus, (*ut esset*) testimonium temporibus suis,

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p6"></span>**7**. Whereunto I am ordained a
preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, *and* lie not;)
a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p7"></span>**7**. In quod positus sum praeco et
Apostolus: veritatem dico in Christo, non menitor, Doctor Gentium in
fide et veritate.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p8"></span><span id="iii.iv.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p9"></span>**5** *For there is one God* This
argument might, at first sight, appear to be not very strong, that God
wishes all men to be saved, because he is one; if a transition had not
been made from God to men. Chrysostom — and, after him, others — view it
in this sense, that there are not many gods, as idolaters imagine. But I
think that Paul’s design was different, and that there is here an
implied comparison of one God with the whole world and with various
nations, out of which comparison arises a view of both, as they mutually
regard each other. In like manner the Apostle says,

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p10"></span>“Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he
not also of the Gentiles? Yea, it is one God who justifieth the
circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.’ (<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p10.1"></span>[Ro
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#029.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p10.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p11"></span>Accordingly, whatever diversity might at
that time exist among men, because many ranks and many nations were
strangers to faith, Paul brings to the remembrance of believers the
unity of God, that they may know that they are connected with all,
because there is one God of all — that they may know that they who are
under the power of the same God are not excluded for ever from the hope
of salvation.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p12"></span>*And one Mediator between God and men*
This clause is of a similar import with the former; for, as there is one
God, the Creator and Father of all, so he says that there is but one
Mediator,  <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) through whom we have
access to the Father; and that this Mediator was given, not only to one
nation, or to a small number of persons of some particular rank, but to
all; because the fruit of the sacrifice, by which he made atonement for
sins, extends to all. More especially because a large portion of the
world was at that time alienated from God, he expressly mentions the
Mediator, through whom they that were afar off now approach.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p14"></span>The universal term *all* must always be
referred to classes: of men, and not to persons; as if he had said, that
not only Jews, but Gentiles also, not only persons of humble rank, but
princes also, were redeemed by the death of Christ. Since, therefore, he
wishes the benefit of his death to be common to all, an insult is
offered to him by those who, by their opinion, shut out any person from
the hope of salvation.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p15"></span>*The man Christ Jesus*. When he declares
that he is “a man,” the Apostle does not deny that the Mediator is God,
but, intending to point out the bond of our union with God, he mentions
the human nature rather than the divine. This ought to be carefully
observed. From the beginning, men, by contriving for themselves this or
that mediator, departed farther from God; and the reason was, that,
being prejudiced in favor of this error, that God was at a great
distance from them, they knew not to what hand to turn. Paul remedies
this evil, when he represents God as present with us; for he has
descended even to us, so that we do not need to seek him above the
clouds. The same thing is said in <span id="iii.iv.ii-p15.1"></span>[Heb
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p15.1"></span>,

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p16"></span>“We have not a high priest who cannot
sympathize within our infirmities, for in all things he was tempted.”

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p17"></span>And, indeed, if this were deeply
impressed on the hearts of all, that the Son of God holds out to us the
hand of a brother, and that we are united to him by the fellowship of
our nature, in order that, out of our low condition, he may raise us to
heaven; who would not choose to keep by this straight road, instead of
wandering in uncertain and stormy paths! Accordingly, whenever we ought
to pray to God, if we call to remembrance that exalted and
unapproachable majesty, that we may not be driven back by the dread of
it, let us, at the same time, remember “the man Christ,” who gently
invites us, and takes us, as it were, by the hand, in order that the
Father, who had been the object of terror and alarm, may be reconciled
by him and rendered friendly to us. This is the only key to open for us
the gate of the heavenly kingdom, that we may appear in the presence of
God with confidence.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p18"></span>Hence we see, that Satan has, in all
ages, followed this course, for the purpose of leading men astray from
the right path. I say nothing of the various devices by which, before
the coming of Christ, he alienated the minds of men, to contrive methods
of approaching to God. At the very commencement of the Christian Church,
when Christ, with so excellent a pledge, was fresh in their remembrance,
and while the earth was still ringing with that delightfully sweet word
from his mouth,

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p19"></span>“Come to me, all ye that labor and are
heavy laden,  
and I will give you rest,” (<span id="iii.iv.ii-p19.2"></span>[Mt
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p19.2"></span>,)

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p20"></span>there were, nevertheless, some persons
skilled in deception, who thrust angels into his room as mediators;
which is evident from <span id="iii.iv.ii-p20.1"></span>[Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p20.1"></span>. But what Satan, at that time, contrived
secretly, he carried to such a pitch, during the times of Popery, that
scarcely one person in a thousand acknowledged Christ, even in words, to
be the Mediator. And while the name was buried, still more was the
reality unknown.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p21"></span>Now that God has raised up good and
faithful teachers, who have labored to restore and bring to the
remembrance of men what ought to have been one of the best-known
principles of our faith, the sophists of the Church of Rome have
resorted to every contrivance for darkening a point so clear. First, the
name is so hateful to them, that, if any one mentions Christ as
Mediator, without taking notice of the saints, he instantly falls under
a suspicion of heresy. But, because they do not venture to reject
altogether what Paul teaches in this passage, they evade it by a foolish
exposition, that he is called “one Mediator,” not “the only Mediator.”
As if the Apostle had mentioned God as one out of a vast multitude of
gods; for the two clauses are closely connected, that “there is one God
and one Mediator;” and therefore they who make Christ one out of many
mediators must apply the same interpretation in speaking of God. Would
they rise to such a height of impudence, if they were not impelled by
blind rage to crush the glory of Christ?

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p22"></span>There are others who think themselves
more acute, and who lay down this distinction, that Christ is the only
Mediator of redemption, while they pronounce the saints to be mediators
of intercession. But the folly of these interpreters is reproved by the
scope of the passage, in which the Apostle speaks expressly about
prayer. The Holy Spirit commands us to pray for all, because our only
Mediator admits all to come to him; just as by his death he reconciled
all to the Father. And yet they who thus, with daring sacrilege, strip
Christ of his honor, wish to be regarded as Christians.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p23"></span>But it is objected that this has the
appearance of contradiction; for in this very passage Paul enjoins us to
intercede for others, while, in the Epistle to the Romans, he declares
that intercession belongs to Christ alone. (<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p23.1"></span>[Ro
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p23.1"></span>.) I reply, the intercessions of the saints,
by which they aid each other in their addresses to God, do not
contradict the doctrine, that all have but one Intercessor; for no man’s
prayers are heard either in behalf of himself, or in behalf of another,
unless he rely on Christ as his advocate. When we intercede for one
another, this is so far from setting aside the intercession of Christ,
as belonging to him alone, that the chief reliance is given, and the
chief reference made, to that very intercession.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p24"></span>Some person will perhaps think, that it
will, therefore, be easy for us to come to an agreement with the
Papists, if they place below the only intercession of Christ, all that
they ascribe to the saints. This is not the case; for the reason why
they transfer to the saints the office of interceding is, that they
imagine that otherwise we are destitute of an advocate. It is a common
opinion among them, that we need intercessors, because in ourselves we
are unworthy of appearing in the presence of God. By speaking in this
manner, they deprive Christ of his honor. Besides, it is a shocking
blasphemy, to ascribe to saints such excellence as would procure for us
the favor of God: and all the prophets, and apostles, and martyrs, and
even the angels themselves — are so far from making any pretension to
this, that they too have need of the same intercession as ourselves.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p25"></span>Again, it is a mere dream, originating
in their own brain, that the dead intercede for us; and, therefore, to
found our prayers on this is altogether to withdraw our trust from
calling upon God. But Paul lays down, as the rule for calling on God in
a proper manner, faith grounded on the word of God. (<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p25.1"></span>[Ro
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p25.1"></span>.) Justly, therefore, everything that men
contrive, in the exercise of their own thoughts, without the authority
of the word of God, is rejected by us.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p26"></span>But not to dwell on this subject longer
than the exposition of the passage demands, let it be summed up in this
manner; that they who have actually learned the office of Christ will be
satisfied with having him alone, and that none will make mediators at
their own pleasure but those who neither know God nor Christ. Hence I
conclude, that the doctrine of the Papists — which darkens, and almost
buries, the intercession of Christ, and introduces pretended
intercessors without any support from Scripture — is full of wicked
distrust, and also of wicked rashness.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p27"></span><span id="iii.iv.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p28"></span>**6** *Who gave himself a ransom for
all*  <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) The mention of redemption in
this passage is not superfluous; for there is a necessary connection
between the two things, the sacrifice of the death of Christ, and his
continual intercession. (<span id="iii.iv.ii-p29.16"></span>[Ro
8:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#034.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p29.16"></span>.) These are the two parts of his
priesthood; for, when Christ is called our priest, it is in this sense,
that he once made atonement for our sins by his death, that he might
reconcile us to God; and now having entered into the sanctuary of
heaven, he appears in presence of the Father, in order to obtain grace
for us, that we may be heard in his name. (<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p29.17"></span>[Ps
110:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p29.17"></span>; <span id="iii.iv.ii-p29.18"></span>[Heb
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p29.18"></span>.) So much the more does he expose the
wicked sacrilege of the Papists, who, by making dead saints to be
companions of Christ in this affair, transfer to them likewise the glory
of the priesthood. Read the fourth chapter of the Epistle to the
Hebrews, towards the conclusion, and the beginning of the fifth chapter,
\[<span id="iii.iv.ii-p29.19"></span>[Heb
4:14-5:10](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p29.19"></span>,\] and you will find what I maintain, that
the intercession by which God is reconciled to us is founded on the
sacrifice; which, indeed, is demonstrated by the whole system of the
ancient priesthood. It follows, therefore, that it is impossible to take
from Christ any part of the office of intercession, and bestow it on
others, without stripping him of the title of priesthood.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p30"></span>Besides, when the Apostle calls him
ἀντίλυτρον, *“*a ransom,”  <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) he
overthrows all other satisfactions. Yet I am not ignorant of the
injurious devices of the Papists, who pretend that the price of
redemption, which Christ paid by his death, is applied to us in baptism,
so that original sin is effaced, and that afterwards we are reconciled
to God by satisfactions. In this way they limit to a small period of
time, and to a single class, that benefit which was universal and
perpetual. But a full illustration of this subject will be found in the
Institutes.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p32"></span>*That there might be a testimony in due
time;* that is, in order that this grace might be revealed at the
appointed time. The phrase, *for all,* which the Apostle had used, might
have given rise to the question, “Why then had God chosen a peculiar
people, if he revealed himself as a reconciled Father to all without
distinction, and if the one redemption through Christ was common to
all?” He cuts off all ground for that question, by referring to the
purpose of God the season  <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) for
revealing his grace. For if we are not astonished that in winter, the
trees are stripped of their foliage, the fields are covered with snow,
and the meadows are stiff with frost, and that, by the genial warmth of
spring, what appeared for a time to be dead, begins to revive, because
God appointed the seasons to follow in succession; why should we not
allow the same authority to his providence in other matters? Shall we
accuse God of instability, because he brings forward, at the proper
time, what he had always determined, and settled in his own mind?

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p34"></span>Accordingly, although it came upon the
world suddenly and was altogether unexpected, that Christ was revealed
as a Redeemer to Jews and Gentiles, without distinction; let us not
think that it was sudden with respect to God but, on the contrary, let
us learn to subject all our sense to his wonderful providence. The
consequence will be, that there will be nothing that comes from him
which shall not appear to us to be highly seasonable. On that account
this admonition frequently occurs in the writings of Paul and especially
when he treats of the calling of the Gentiles, by which, at that time,
on account of its novelty, many persons were startled and almost
confounded. They who are not satisfied with this solution, that God, by
his hidden wisdom, arranged the succession of the seasons, will one day
feel, that, at the time when they think that he was idle, he was framing
a hell for inquisitive persons.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p35"></span><span id="iii.iv.ii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p36"></span>**7** *For which I have been appointed*.
That it may not be thought that he makes rash assertions — as many are
wont to do — on a subject which he did not well understand, he affirms
that God had appointed him for this purpose, that he might bring the
Gentiles, who had formerly been alienated from the kingdom of God, to
have a share in the gospel; for his apostleship was a sure foundation of
the divine calling. And on this account he labors very hard in asserting
it, as there are many who received it with no small difficulty.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p37"></span>*I speak the truth in Christ, I do not
lie*. He employs an oath, or protestation, as in a matter of
extraordinary weigh and importance, that he is *a teacher of the
Gentiles,* and that *in faith and truth* These two things denote a good
conscience, but still it must rest on the certainty of the will of God.
Thus he means, that he preaches the gospel to the Gentiles, not only
with pure affection, but also with an upright and fearless conscience;
because he does nothing but by the command of God.

<span id="iii.iv.iii"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p1"></span><span id="iii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>[1
Timothy 2:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p2"></span>**8**. I will therefore that men pray
every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p3"></span>**8**. Volo igitur orare viros in omni
loco, sustollentes puras manus, absque ira et disceptatione.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p4"></span>**9**. In like manner also, that women
adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety;
not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p5"></span>**9**. Consimiliter et mulieres in
amictu decoro cum verecundia et temperantia ornare semetipsas, non
tortis crinibus, aut auro, aut margaritis, aut vestitu sumptuoso;

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p6"></span>**10**. But (which becometh women
professing godliness) with good works.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p7"></span>**10**. Sed, quod decet mulieres
porfitentes pietatem, per bona opera.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p8"></span><span id="iii.iv.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p9"></span>**8** *I wish therefore that men may
pray* This inference depends on the preceding statement; for, as we saw
in the Epistle to the Galatians, we must receive “the Spirit of
adoption,”  <span id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) in order that we may
call on God in a proper manner. Thus, after having exhibited the grace
of Christ to all, and after having mentioned that he was given to the
Gentiles for the express purpose, that they might enjoy the same benefit
of redemption in common with the Jews, he invites all in the same manner
to pray; for faith leads to calling on God. Hence, at <span
id="iii.iv.iii-p10.3"></span>[Ro
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii-p10.3"></span>, he proves the calling of the Gentiles by
these passages.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p11"></span>“Let the Gentiles rejoice with his
people.” (<span id="iii.iv.iii-p11.1"></span>[Ps
67:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa067.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii-p11.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p12"></span>Again,

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p13"></span>“All ye Gentiles, praise God.’, (<span
id="iii.iv.iii-p13.1"></span>[Ps
117:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii-p13.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p14"></span>Again,

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p15"></span>“I will confess to thee among the
Gentiles.” (<span id="iii.iv.iii-p15.1"></span>[Ps
18:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#049.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii-p15.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p16"></span>The material argument holds good, from
faith to prayer, and from prayer to faith, whether we reason from the
cause to the effect, or from the effect to the cause. This is worthy of
observation, because it reminds us that God reveals himself to us in his
word, that we may call upon him; and this is the chief exercise of
faith.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p17"></span>*In every place* This expression is of
the same import as in the beginning of the First Epistle to the
Corinthians,

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p18"></span>“with all that in *every place* call on
the name of Jesus Christ our Lord,” (<span
id="iii.iv.iii-p18.1"></span>[1Co
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii-p18.1"></span>,)

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p19"></span>so that there is now no difference
between Gentile and Jew, between Greek and barbarian, because all in
common have God as their Father; and in Christ is now fulfilled what
Malachi had foretold, that not only in Judea, but throughout the whole
world, pure sacrifices are offered. (<span
id="iii.iv.iii-p19.1"></span>[Mal
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii-p19.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p20"></span>*Lifting up pure hands* As if he had
said, “Provided that it be accompanied by a good conscience, there will
be nothing to prevent all the nations from calling upon God everywhere.
But he has employed the sign instead of the reality, for “pure hands”
are the expressions of a pure heart; just as, on the contrary, Isaiah
rebukes the Jews for lifting up “bloody hands,” when he attacks their
cruelty. (<span id="iii.iv.iii-p20.1"></span>[Isa
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iii-p20.1"></span>.) Besides, this attitude has been
generally used in worship during all ages; for it is a feeling which
nature has implanted in us, when we ask God, to look upwards, and has
always been so strong, that even idolaters themselves, although in other
respects they make a god of images of wood and stone, still retained the
custom of lifting up their hands to heaven. Let us therefore learn that
the attitude is in accordance with true godliness, provided that it be
attended by the corresponding truth which is represented by it, namely,
that, having been informed that we ought to seek God in heaven, first,
we should form no conception of Him that is earthly or carnal; and,
secondly, that we should lay aside carnal affections, so that nothing
may prevent our hearts from rising above the world. But idolaters and
hypocrites, when they lift up their hands in prayer, are apes; for while
they profess, by the outward symbol, that their minds are raised
upwards, the former are fixed on wood and stone, as if God were shut up
in them, and the latter, wrapped up either in useless anxieties, or in
wicked thoughts, cleave to the earth; and therefore, by a gesture of an
opposite meaning,  <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) they bear
testimony against themselves.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p22"></span>*Without wrath* Some explain this to
mean a burst of indignation, when the conscience fights with itself,
and, so to speak, quarrels with God which usually happens when adversity
presses heavily upon us; for then we are displeased that God does not
send us immediate assistance, and are agitated by impatience. Faith is
also shaken by various assaults; for, in consequence of his assistance
not being visible, we are seized with doubts, whether or not he cares
about us, or wishes us to be saved, and things of that nature.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p23"></span>They who take this view think that the
word *disputing* denotes that alarm which arises from doubt. Thus,
according to them, the meaning would be, that we should pray with a
peaceful conscience and assured confidence. Chrysostom and others think
that the apostle here demands that our minds should be calm and free
from all uneasy feelings both towards God and towards men; because there
is nothing that tends more to hinder pure calling on God than quarrels
and strife. On this account Christ enjoins, that if any man be at
variance with his brother, he shall go and be reconciled to him before
offering his gift on the altar.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p24"></span>For my part, I acknowledge that both of
these views are just; but when I take into consideration the context of
this passage, I have no doubt that Paul had his eye on the disputes
which arose out of the indignation of the Jews at having the Gentiles
made equal to themselves, in consequence of which they raised a
controversy about the calling of the Gentiles, and went so far as to
reject and exclude them from the participation of grace. Paul therefore
wishes that debates of this nature should be put down, and that all the
children of God of every nation and country should pray with one heart.
Yet there is nothing to restrain us from drawing from this particular
statement a general doctrine.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p25"></span><span id="iii.iv.iii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p26"></span>**9** *In like manner also women* As he
enjoined men to lift up pure hands, so he now prescribes the manner in
which women ought to prepare for praying aright. And there appears to be
an implied contrast between those virtues which he recommends and the
outward sanctification of the Jews; for he intimates that there is no
profane place, nor any from which both men and women may not draw near
to God, provided they are not excluded by their vices.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p27"></span>He intended to embrace the opportunity
of correcting a vice to which women are almost always prone, and which
perhaps at Ephesus, being a city of vast wealth and extensive
merchandise, especially abounded. That vice is — excessive eagerness and
desire to be richly dressed. He wishes therefore that their dress should
be regulated by modesty and sobriety; for luxury and immoderate expense
arise from a desire to make a display either for the sake of pride or of
departure from chastity. And hence we ought to derive the rule of
moderation; for, since dress is an indifferent matter, (as all outward
matters are,) it is difficult to assign a fixed limit, how far we ought
to go. Magistrates may indeed make laws, by means of which a rage for
superfluous expenditure shall be in some measure restrained; but godly
teachers, whose business it is to guide the consciences, ought always to
keep in view the end of lawful use. This at least will be settled beyond
all controversy, that every thing in dress which is not in accordance
with modesty and sobriety must be disapproved.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p28"></span>Yet we must always begin with the
dispositions; for where debauchery reigns within, there will be no
chastity; and where ambition reigns within, there will be no modesty in
the outward dress. But because hypocrites commonly avail themselves of
all the pretexts that they can find for concealing their wicked
dispositions, we are under the necessity of pointing out what meets the
eye. It would be great baseness to deny the appropriateness of modesty
as the peculiar and constant ornament of virtuous and chaste women, or
the duty of all to observe moderation. Whatever is opposed to these
virtues it will be in vain to excuse. He expressly censures certain
kinds of superfluity, such as curled hair, jewels, and golden rings; not
that the use of gold or of jewels is expressly forbidden, but that,
wherever they are prominently displayed, these things commonly draw
along with them the other evils which I have mentioned, and arise from
ambition or from want of chastity as their source.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p29"></span><span id="iii.iv.iii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p30"></span>**10** *Which becometh women*; for
undoubtedly the dress of a virtuous and godly woman must differ from
that of a strumpet. What he has laid down are marks of distinction; and
if piety must be testified by works, this profession ought also to be
visible in chaste and becoming dress.

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p13"></span>**11** *Let a woman learn in quietness*.
After having spoken of dress, he now adds with what modesty women ought
to conduct themselves in the holy assembly. And first he bids them learn
quietly; for *quietness* means silence, that they may not take upon them
to speak in public. This he immediately explains more clearly, by
forbidding them to teach.

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p14"></span><span id="iii.iv.iv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p15"></span>**12** *But I suffer not a woman to
teach*. Not that he takes from them the charge of instructing their
family, but only excludes them from the office of teaching, which God
has committed to men only. On this subject we have explained our views
in the exposition of the First Epistle to the Corinthians.  <span
id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) If any one bring forward, by way of
objection, Deborah (<span id="iii.iv.iv-p16.2"></span>[Jud
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg004.htm#004)<span id="iii.iv.iv-p16.2"></span>.md)
and others of the same class, of whom we read that they were at one time
appointed by the command of God to govern the people, the answer is
easy. Extraordinary acts done by God do not overturn the ordinary rules
of government, by which he intended that we should be bound.
Accordingly, if women at one time held the office of prophets and
teachers, and that too when they were supernaturally called to it by the
Spirit of God, He who is above all law might do this; but, being a
peculiar case,  <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) this is not opposed
to the constant and ordinary system of government.

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p18"></span>He adds — what is closely allied to the
office of teaching — *and not to assume authority over the man;* for the
very reason, why they are forbidden to teach, is, that it is not
permitted by their condition. They are subject, and to teach implies the
rank of power or authority. Yet it may be thought that there is no great
force in this argument; because even prophets and teachers are subject
to kings and to other magistrates. I reply, there is no absurdity in the
same person commanding and likewise obeying, when viewed in different
relations. But this does not apply to the case of woman, who by nature
(that is, by the ordinary law of God) is formed to obey; for
γυναικοκρατία (the government of women) has always been regarded by all
wise persons as a monstrous thing; and, therefore, so to speak, it will
be a mingling of heaven and earth, if women usurp the right to teach.
Accordingly, he bids them be “quiet,” that is, keep within their own
rank.  <span id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md)

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p20"></span><span id="iii.iv.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p21"></span>**13** *For Adam was first created* He
assigns two reasons why women ought to be subject to men; because not
only did God enact this law at the beginning, but he also inflicted it
as a punishment on the woman. (<span id="iii.iv.iv-p21.1"></span>[Ge
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv-p21.1"></span>.) He accordingly shews that, although
mankind had stood in their first and original uprightness, the true
order of nature, which proceeded from the command of God, bears that
women shall be subject. Nor is this inconsistent with the fact, that
Adam, by falling from his first dignity, deprived himself of his
authority; for in the ruins, which followed sin, there still linger some
remains of the divine blessing, and it was not proper that woman, by her
own fault, should make her condition better than before.  <span
id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md)

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p23"></span>Yet the reason that Paul assigns, that
woman was second in the order of creation, appears not to be a very
strong argument in favor of her subjection; for John the Baptist was
before Christ in the order of time, and yet was greatly inferior in
rank. But although Paul does not state all the circumstances which are
related by Moses, yet he intended that his readers should take them into
consideration. Now Moses shews that the woman was created afterwards, in
order that she might be a kind of appendage to the man; and that she was
joined to the man on the express condition, that she should be at hand
to render obedience to him. (<span id="iii.iv.iv-p23.1"></span>[Ge
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv-p23.1"></span>.) Since, therefore, God did not create two
chiefs of equal power, but added to the man an inferior aid, the Apostle
justly reminds us of that order of creation in which the eternal and
inviolable appointment of God is strikingly displayed.

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p24"></span><span id="iii.iv.iv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p25"></span>**14** *And Adam was not deceived* He
alludes to the punishment inflicted on the woman:

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p26"></span>“Because thou hast obeyed the voice of
the serpent, thou shalt be subject to the authority of thy husband, and
thy desire shall be to him.”  <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md)
(<span id="iii.iv.iv-p27.2"></span>[Ge
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv-p27.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p28"></span>Because she had given fatal advice, it
was right that she should learn that she was under the power and will of
another; and because she had drawn her husband aside from the command of
God, it was right that she should be deprived of all liberty and placed
under the yoke. Besides, the Apostle does not rest his argument entirely
or absolutely on the cause of the transgression, but founds it on the
sentence which was pronounced by God.

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p29"></span>Yet it may be thought that these two
statements are somewhat contradictory: that the subjection of the woman
is the punishment of her transgression, and yet that it was imposed on
her from the creation; for thence it will follow, that she was doomed to
servitude before she sinned. I reply, there is nothing to hinder that
the condition of obeying should be natural from the beginning, and that
afterwards the accidental condition of serving should come into
existence; so that the subjection was now less voluntary and agreeable
than it had formerly been.

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p30"></span>Again, this passage has given to some
people an occasion for affirming that Adam did not fall by means of
error, but that he was only overcome by the allurements of his wife.
Accordingly, they think that the woman only was deceived by the wiles of
the devil, to believe that she and her husband would be like the gods;
But that Adam was not at all persuaded of this, but tasted the fruit in
order to please his wife. But it is easy to refute this opinion; for, if
Adam had not given credit to the falsehood of Satan, God would not have
reproached him:

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p31"></span>“Behold, Adam is become like one of us.”
(<span id="iii.iv.iv-p31.1"></span>[Ge
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.iv.iv-p31.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p32"></span>There are other reasons of which I say
nothing; for there needs not a long refutation of an error which does
not rest on any probable conjecture. By these words Paul does not mean
that Adam was not entangled by the same deceitfulness of the devil,
 <span id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) but that the cause or source of
the transgression proceeded from Eve.

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p34"></span><span id="iii.iv.iv-p34.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p35"></span>**15** *But she shall be saved* The
weakness of the sex renders women more suspicious and timid, and the
preceding statement might greatly terrify and alarm the strongest minds.
For these reasons he modifies what he had said by adding a consolation;
for the Spirit of God does not accuse or reproach us, in order to
triumph over us, when we are covered with shame, but, when we have been
cast down, immediately raises us up. It might have the effect (as I have
already said) of striking terror into the minds of women,  <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) when they were informed that the
destruction of the whole human race was attributed to them; for what
will be this condemnation? Especially when their subjection, as a
testimony of the wrath of God, is constantly placed before their eyes.
Accordingly, Paul, in order to comfort them and render their condition
tolerable, informs them that they continue to enjoy the hope of
salvation, though they suffer a temporal punishment. It is proper to
observe that the good effect of this consolation is twofold. First, by
the hope of salvation held out to them, they are prevented from falling
into despair through alarm at the mention of their guilt. Secondly, they
become accustomed to endure calmly and patiently the necessity of
servitude, so as to submit willingly to their husbands, when they are
informed that this kind of obedience is both profitable to themselves
and acceptable to God. If this passage be tortured, as Papists are wont
to do, to support the righteousness of works, the answer is easy. The
Apostle does not argue here about the cause of salvation, and therefore
we cannot and must not infer from these words what works deserve; but
they only shew in what way God conducts us to salvation, to which he has
appointed us through his grace.

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p37"></span>*Through child-bearing* To censorious
men it might appear absurd, for an Apostle of Christ not only to exhort
women to give attention to the birth of offspring, but to press this
work as religious and holy to such an extent as to represent it in the
light of the means of procuring salvation. Nay, we even see with what
reproaches the conjugal bed has been slandered by hypocrites, who wished
to be thought more holy than all other men. But there is no difficulty
in replying to these sneers of the ungodly. First, here the Apostle does
not speak merely about having children, but about enduring all the
distresses, which are manifold and severe, both in the birth and in the
rearing of children. Secondly, whatever hypocrites or wise men of the
world may think of it, when a woman, considering to what she has been
called, submits to the condition which God has assigned to her, and does
not refuse to endure the pains, or rather the fearful anguish, of
parturition, or anxiety about her offspring, or anything else that
belongs to her duty, God values this obedience more highly than if, in
some other manner, she made a great display of heroic virtues, while she
refused to obey the calling of God. To this must be added, that no
consolation could be more appropriate or more efficacious then to shew
that the very means (so to speak) of procuring salvation are found in
the punishment itself.

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p38"></span>*If they continue in faith* In
consequence of the old translation having used the expression, “the
birth of children,” it has been commonly thought that this clause refers
to the children. But the term used by Paul to denote “child-bearing” is
a single word, τεκνογονία, and therefore it must refer to the women. As
to the verb being plural, and the noun singular, this involves no
difficulty; for an indefinite noun, at least when it denotes a
multitude, has the force of a collective noun, and therefore easily
admits a change from the singular to the plural number.

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p39"></span>Besides, that he might not represent all
the virtue of women as included in the duties of marriage, immediately
afterwards he adds greater virtues, in which it is proper that godly
women should excel, that they may differ from irreligious women. Even
“child-bearing” is obedience acceptable to God, only so far as it
proceeds *from faith and love* To these two he adds *sanctification,*
which includes all the purity of life which becomes Christian women.
Lastly follows *sobriety,* which he formerly mentioned, while he was
speaking about dress; but now he extends it more widely to the other
parts of life.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p15"></span> “<span
id="iii.iv.i-p15.1"></span>Δεήσεις, if we attend to its etymological
import, is derived <span id="iii.iv.i-p15.2"></span>ἀπὸ τοῦ δεῖσθαι,
‘from being in want’ and is a petition for that <span
id="iii.iv.i-p15.3"></span>οὗ δεόμεθα, ‘which we want.’ It is very
correctly defined by Gregory Nazianzen in his 15th Iambic Ode: <span
id="iii.iv.i-p15.4"></span>Δέησιν οἵου τὴν αἴτησιν ἐνδεῶν, ‘consider
that when you are in want of anything, your petition is <span
id="iii.iv.i-p15.5"></span>δέησις.’ If we attend again to the customary
usage of the word, it signifies ‘a petition for a benefit.’ My opinion
is, that the various names express one and the same thing, viewed under
various aspects. Our prayers are called <span
id="iii.iv.i-p15.6"></span>δεήσεις, so far as by them we declare to God
our *need*; for <span id="iii.iv.i-p15.7"></span>δέεσθαι is “to be in
need.’ They are <span id="iii.iv.i-p15.8"></span>προσευχαὶ, as they
contain our wishes. They are <span id="iii.iv.i-p15.9"></span>αἰτήματα,
as they express petitions and desires. They are <span
id="iii.iv.i-p15.10"></span>ἐντεύξεις, as we are permitted by God to
approach Him, not with timidity, but in a familiar manner: for <span
id="iii.iv.i-p15.11"></span>ἐντεύξις is a familiar conversation and
interview.” — *Witsius on the Lord’s Prayer*

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p13"></span> “Christ is said to be the one Mediator
in the same sense that God is said to be the one God. As there is but
one Creator of man, so there is but one Mediator for men. As God is the
God of all that died before Christ came, as well as of those that died
after; so Christ is the Mediator of all that died before his coming, as
well as of those that saw his day. They had Christ for their Mediator,
or some other; some other they could not have, because there is but one.
They might as well have had another Creator besides God, as another
Mediator besides the man Christ Jesus. In regard of the antiquity of his
mediation, from the foundation of the world, he us represented, when he
walks as Mediator ‘in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks,’ with
‘hair as white as wool,’ a character of age (<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p13.1"></span>[Re
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p13.1"></span>); as God is described so in regard of his

7:9](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p13.2"></span>.) There is but one God from eternity; but
one Mediator, whose mediation hath the same date as the foundation of
the world, and runs parallel with it.” — *Charnock.*

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p29"></span> “He gave himself <span
id="iii.iv.ii-p29.1"></span>ἀντίλυτρον ὑπὲρ, ‘a ransom for’ all. If this
does not imply the notion of Vicarious, I very much question whether
language can express it. <span id="iii.iv.ii-p29.2"></span>Λύτρον is a
Ransom; which conveys a vicarious sense, in its most common and
authorized acceptation. <span id="iii.iv.ii-p29.3"></span>Ἁντὶ, which is
equivalent to Instead, still more fully ascertains and strengthens the
idea. (<span id="iii.iv.ii-p29.4"></span>Ἁντὶ, <span
id="iii.iv.ii-p29.5"></span>[Mt
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p29.5"></span>.) By this word the LXX. translated the word
<span id="iii.iv.ii-p29.6"></span>תהת, (tabhdth.) And that <span
id="iii.iv.ii-p29.7"></span>תהת denotes the substitution of one instead
of another, no student of the sacred language will venture to deny. (See
<span id="iii.iv.ii-p29.8"></span>[Ge
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#013.md)<span

id="iii.iv.ii-p29.10"></span>.) <span id="iii.iv.ii-p29.11"></span>ὑπὲρ,
which is translated *For*, and denotes a substitution of one in the
place of another; this, added to all, renders the expression as
determinate and emphatical for the purpose as words can possibly be.
Thus writes Clemens Romanus, <span id="iii.iv.ii-p29.12"></span>Τὸ αἷυα
αὐτοῦ ἔδωχεν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς ὁ Κύριος ἡμῶν, χαὶ τὴν σάρχα ὑπερ
τὢς εάρχος ἡμῶν, χαὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ὑπὲρ τῶν ψυχῶν ἡμῶν. “Jesus Christ our
Lord gave his blood for us, and his flesh for our flesh, and his soul
for our souls.” (<span id="iii.iv.ii-p29.13"></span>[Ep.

ad Corinth.) Exactly to the same purpose Justin the Martyr expresses
himself: ‘He gave his own Son a ransom (<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p29.14"></span>ὑπὲρ) for us, the holy for transgressors,
the sinless for the sinful, the righteous for the unrighteous, the
immortal for the mortal.’ (<span id="iii.iv.ii-p29.15"></span>[Ep.

redemption.” — “When he calls him the Ransom or Price of our
redemption.” — “Christ came to give up his life as a <span
id="iii.iv.ii-p31.2"></span>λύτρον. Now <span
id="iii.iv.ii-p31.3"></span>λύτρον properly denotes the ransom paid, in
order to deliver any one from death, or its equivalent, captivity, or
from punishment in general. It has been satisfactorily proved that,
among both the Jews and the Gentiles, peculiar victims were accepted as
a ransom for the life of an offender, and to atone for his offense. —
The <span id="iii.iv.ii-p31.4"></span>ἀντίλυτρον of this passage is a
