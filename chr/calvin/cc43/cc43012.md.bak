<span id="iv.i-p1"></span>THE ARGUMENT

<span id="iv.i-p2"></span>ON

<span id="iv.i-p3"></span>THE SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY

<span id="iv.i-p4"></span>IT cannot be absolutely ascertained from
Luke’s history at what time the former Epistle was written. But I have
no doubt that, after that time, Paul had personal communication with
Timothy; and it is even possible (if the generally received opinion be
believed) that Paul had him for a companion and assistant in many
places. Yet it may readily be concluded that he was at Ephesus when this
Epistle was written to him; because, towards the close of the Epistle,
(<span id="iv.i-p4.1"></span>[2Ti
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#019)<span id="iv.i-p4.1"></span>,.md)
Paul “salutes Priscilla, and Aquila, and Onesiphorus,” the last of whom
was an Ephesian, and Luke informs us that the other two remained at
Ephesus when Paul sailed to Judea, (<span id="iv.i-p4.2"></span>[Acts
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#018.md), [Acts
19:0](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#000)<span id="iv.i-p4.2"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.i-p5"></span>The chief point on which it turns is to
confirm Timothy, both in the faith of the gospel, and in the pure and
constant preaching of it. But yet these exhortations derive no small
weight from the consideration of the time when he wrote them. Paul had
before his eyes the death which he was prepared to endure for the
testimony of the gospel. All that we read here, therefore, concerning
the kingdom of Christ, the hope of eternal life, the Christian warfare,
confidence in confessing Christ, and the certainty of doctrine, ought to
be viewed by us as written not with ink but with Paul’s own blood; for
nothing is asserted by him for which he does not offer the pledge of his
death; and therefore this Epistle may be regarded as a solemn
subscription and ratification of Paul’s doctrine.

<span id="iv.i-p6"></span>It is of importance to remember, however, what
we stated in the exposition of the former Epistle, that the Apostle did
not write it merely for the sake of one man, but that he exhibited,
under the person of one man, a general doctrine, which should afterwards
be transmitted from one hand to another. And first, having praised the
faith of Timothy, in which he had been educated from his childhood, he
exhorts him to persevere faithfully in the doctrine which he had
learned, and in the office intrusted to him; and, at the same time, lest
Timothy should be discouraged on account of Paul’s imprisonment, or the
apostasy of others, he boasts of his apostleship and of the reward laid
up for him. He likewise praises Onesiphorus, in order to encourage
others by his example; and because the condition of those who serve
Christ is painful and difficult, he borrows comparisons both from
husbandmen and from soldiers, the former of whom do not hesitate to
bestow much labor on the cultivation of the soil before any fruit is
seen, while the latter lay aside all cares and employments, in order to
devote themselves entirely to the life of a soldier and to the command
of their general.

<span id="iv.i-p7"></span>Next, he gives a brief summary of his gospel,
and commands Timothy to hand it down to others, and to take care that it
shall be transmitted to posterity. Having taken occasion from this to
mention again his own imprisonment, he rises to holy boldness, for the
purpose of animating others by his noble courage; for he invites us all
to contemplate, along with him, that crown which awaits him in heaven.

<span id="iv.i-p8"></span>He bids him also abstain from contentious
disputes and vain questions, recommending to him, on the contrary, to
promote edification; and in order to shew more clearly how enormous an
evil it is, he relates that some have been ruined by it, and
particularly mentions two, Hymenaeus and Philetus who, having fallen
into monstrous absurdity, so as to overturn the faith of the
resurrection, suffered the horrible punishment of their vanity. But
because falls of that kind, especially of distinguished men and those
who enjoyed some reputation are usually attended by great scandal, he
shews that believers ought not to be distressed on account of them,
because they who possess the name of Christ do not all belong actually
to Christ, and because the Church must be exposed to the misery of
dwelling among wicked and ungodly persons in this world. Yet that this
may not unduly terrify weak minds, he prudently softens it, by saying
that the Lord will preserve till the end his own, whom he has elected.

<span id="iv.i-p9"></span>He afterwards returns to exhort Timothy to
persevere faithfully in the discharge of his ministry; and in order to
make him more careful, he foretells what dangerous times await the good
and the pious, and what destructive men shall afterwards arise; but, in
opposition to all this, he confirms him by the hope of a good and
successful result. More especially, he recommends to him to be
constantly employed in teaching sound doctrine, pointing out the proper
use of Scripture, that he may know that he will find in it everything
that is necessary for the solid edification of the Church.

<span id="iv.i-p10"></span>Next, he mentions that his own death is at
hand, but he does so in the manner of a conqueror hastening to a
glorious triumph, which is a clear testimony of wonderful confidence.
Lastly, after having besought Timothy to come to him as soon as
possible, he points out the necessity arising from his present
condition. This is the principal subject in the conclusion of the
Epistle.
