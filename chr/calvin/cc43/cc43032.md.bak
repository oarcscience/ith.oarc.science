<span id="vii.iv-p1"></span>A TRANSLATION OF CALVIN’S VERSION

<span id="vii.iv-p2"></span>OF THE

<span id="vii.iv-p3"></span>EPISTLE OF PAUL TO PHILEMON

<span id="vii.iv.i"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p2"></span>**1** Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ,
and Timothy a brother,

<span id="vii.iv.i-p3"></span>**2** To Philemon our friend and
fellow-laborer, and to Apphia the beloved, and to Archippus our
fellow-soldier, and to the church which is in thy house.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p4"></span>**3** Grace (be) to you and peace from God
our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p5"></span>**4** I give thanks to my God, making
mention of thee always in my prayers,

<span id="vii.iv.i-p6"></span>**5** Hearing of thy love and faith, which
thou hast towards the Lord Jesus and towards all saints,

<span id="vii.iv.i-p7"></span>**6** That the communication of thy faith
may be effectual, by the knowledge of every good thing which is in thee
towards Christ Jesus.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p8"></span>**7** For we have much grace (*or, joy*)
and consolation on account of thy love, because the bowels of the saints
have been refreshed by thee, brother.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p9"></span>**8** Wherefore, while I have great
confidence in Christ to command thee what is proper, yet for love’s sake
I rather entreat thee;

<span id="vii.iv.i-p10"></span>**9** Being such a one as Paul the aged
(*or, elder,*) and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p11"></span>**10** I beseech thee for my son, whom I
have begotten in my bonds,

<span id="vii.iv.i-p12"></span>**11** Onesimus, who formerly was
unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable both to thee and to me;

<span id="vii.iv.i-p13"></span>**12** Whom I have sent back; receive him
therefore, that is, my bowels;

<span id="vii.iv.i-p14"></span>**13** Whom I was desirous to keep beside
me, that he might minister to me instead of thee in the bonds of the
gospel.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p15"></span>**14** But without thy opinion I would do
nothing, that thy benefit might not be by constraint, but of free
choice.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p16"></span>**15** For perhaps for this reason he was
separated for a time, that thou mightest receive him for ever;

<span id="vii.iv.i-p17"></span>**16** Not now as a slave, but above a
slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, how much more to thee, both
in the flesh and in the Lord?

<span id="vii.iv.i-p18"></span>**17** If therefore thou holdest me to be
thy associate, receive him as myself.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p19"></span>**18** And if in anything he hath done
thee injury, or oweth thee anything, place it to my account.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p20"></span>**19** I Paul have written it with my own
hand, I will pay it; not to tell thee that thou owest me even thyself.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p21"></span>**20** Yea, brother, let me enjoy  <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the
Lord.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p23"></span>**21** Being convinced of they obedience,
I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do beyond what I write.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p24"></span>**22** But at the same time prepare for
me a lodging; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be given to
you.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p25"></span>**23** Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in
Christ Jesus,

<span id="vii.iv.i-p26"></span>**24** Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke,
my fellow laborers, salute thee.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p27"></span>**25** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
(be) with your spirit. Amen.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p28"></span>It was sent from Rome to Philemon, by
Onesimus a slave.
