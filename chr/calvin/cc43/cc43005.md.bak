<span id="iii.iii-p1"></span>COMMENTARIES ON

<span id="iii.iii-p2"></span>THE FIRST EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY

<span id="iii.iii-p3"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="iii.iii.i"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.i-p1"></span><span id="iii.iii.i-p1.1"></span>[1
Timothy 1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ
by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, *which is*
our hope;

<span id="iii.iii.i-p3"></span>**1**. Paulus apostolus Iesu Christi
secundum ordinationem Dei Salvatoris nostri, et Domini Iesu Christi spei
nostrae:

<span id="iii.iii.i-p4"></span>**2.** Unto Timothy, *my* own son in the
faith: Grace, mercy, *and* peace, from God our Father, and Jesus Christ
our Lord.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p5"></span>**2**. Timotheo germano filio in fide,
gratia, misericordia, pax a Deo Patre nostro, et Christo Iesu Domino
Nostro.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p6"></span>**3**. As I besought thee to abide still
at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some
that they teach no other doctrine.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p7"></span>**3**. Qeumadmodum rogavi te ut maneres
Ephesi, quum proficiscerer in Macedoniam, volo denunties quibusdam, ne
aliter doceant;

<span id="iii.iii.i-p8"></span>**4**. Neither give heed to fables and
endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly
edifying which is in faith: *so do*

<span id="iii.iii.i-p9"></span>**4**. Neque attendant fabulis et
genealogiis nunquam finiendis, quae quaestiones praebent magis quam
aedificationem Dei, quae in fide consistit.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p10"></span><span id="iii.iii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.i-p11"></span>**1** *Paul an apostle* If he had
written to Timothy alone, it would have been unnecessary to claim this
designation, and to maintain it in the manner that he does. Timothy
would undoubtedly have been satisfied with having merely the name; for
he knew that Paul was an Apostle of Christ, and had no need of proof to
convince him of it, being perfectly willing, and having been long
accustomed, to acknowledge it. He has his eye, therefore, chiefly on
others, who were not so ready to listen to him, or did not so easily
believe his words. For the sake of such persons, that they may not treat
lightly what he writes, he affirms that he is “*an Apostle of Christ*.”

<span id="iii.iii.i-p12"></span>*According to the Appointment of God our
Savior, and of the Lord Jesus Christ* He confirms his apostleship by the
*appointment* or command of God; for no man can make himself to be an
apostle, but he whom God hath appointed is a true apostle, and worthy of
the honor. Nor does he merely say, that he owes his apostleship to God
the Father, but ascribes it to Christ also; and, indeed, in the
government of the Church, the Father does nothing but through the Son,
and therefore they both act together.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p13"></span>He calls God *the Savior,* a title which
he is more frequently accustomed to assign to the Son; but it belongs to
the Father also, because it is he who gave the Son to us. Justly,
therefore, is the glory of our salvation ascribed to him. For how comes
it that we are saved? It is because the Father loved us in such a manner
that he determined to redeem and save us through the Son. He calls
Christ *our hope;* and this appellation is strictly applicable to him;
for then do we begin to have good hope, when we look to Christ, since in
him alone dwells all that on which our salvation rests.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p14"></span><span id="iii.iii.i-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.i-p15"></span>**2** *To Timothy my own son* This
commendation expresses no small praise. Paul means by it, that he owns
Timothy to be a true and not a bastard son, and wishes that others
should acknowledge him to be such; and he even applauds Timothy in the
same manner as if he were another Paul. But how does this agree with the
injunction given by Christ, (<span id="iii.iii.i-p15.1"></span>[Mt
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iii.i-p15.1"></span>,) “Call no man your father on the earth?”

<span id="iii.iii.i-p16"></span>Or how does it agree with the
declaration of the Apostle,

<span id="iii.iii.i-p17"></span>“Though ye have many fathers according
to the flesh, yet there is but One who is the Father of spirits.” (<span
id="iii.iii.i-p17.1"></span>[1Co
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.iii.i-p17.1"></span>; <span id="iii.iii.i-p17.2"></span>[Heb
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iii.i-p17.2"></span>.)  <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)

<span id="iii.iii.i-p19"></span>I reply, while Paul claims for himself
the appellation of father, he does it in such a manner as not to take
away or diminish the smallest portion of the honor which is due to God.
(<span id="iii.iii.i-p19.1"></span>[Heb
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iii.i-p19.1"></span>.) It is a common proverb “That which is
placed below another is not at variance with it.” The name father,
applied to Paul, with reference to God, belongs to this class. God alone
is the Father of all in faith, because he regenerates us all by his
word, and by the power of his Spirit, and because none but he bestows
faith. But they whom he is graciously pleased to employ as his ministers
for that purpose, are likewise allowed to share with him in his honor,
while, at the same time, He parts with nothing that belongs to himself.
Thus God, and God alone, strictly speaking, was Timothy’s spiritual
Father; but Paul, who was God’s minister in begetting Timothy, lays
claim to this title, by what may be called a subordinate right.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p20"></span>*Grace, mercy, peace*. So far as relates
to the word *mercy,* he has departed from his ordinary custom in
introducing it, moved, perhaps, by his extraordinary affection for
Timothy. Besides, he does not observe the exact order; for he places
first what ought to love been last, namely, the *grace* which flows from
mercy. For the reason why God at first receives us into favor and why he
loves us is, that he is merciful. But it is not unusual to mention the
cause after the effect, for the sake of explanation. As to the words
*grace* and *peace,* we have spoken on other occasions.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p21"></span><span id="iii.iii.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.i-p22"></span>**3.** *As I besought thee* Either the
syntax is elliptical, or the particle ἵνα is redundant; and in both
cases the meaning will be obvious.  <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md)
First, he reminds Timothy why he was besought to remain at Ephesus. It
was with great reluctance, and through hard necessity, that he parted
with a companion so dearly beloved and so faithful, in order that he
might laboriously hold the part of his deputy, which no other man would
have been competent to fill; and, therefore, Timothy must have been
powerfully excited by this consideration, not only not to throw away his
time, but to conduct himself in an excellent and distinguished manner.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p24"></span>*I wish that thou shouldst forbid any.*
Thus, by way of inference, he exhorts him to oppose the false teachers
who corrupted pure doctrine. In the injunction given to Timothy, to
occupy his place at Ephesus, we ought to observe the holy anxiety of the
Apostle; for while he labored so much to collect many churches he did
not leave the former churches destitute of a pastor. And indeed, as an
ancient writer remarks, “To keep what has been gained is not a smaller
virtue than to make new acquisitions.” The word *forbid* denotes power;
for Paul wishes to arm him with power to restrain others.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p25"></span>*Not to teach differently* The Greek
word (ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖν) which Paul employs, is a compound, and,
therefore, may either be translated, “to teach differently,” or after a
new method, or, “to teach a different doctrine.” The translation given
by Erasmus, *(*<span id="iii.iii.i-p25.1"></span>*sectari,) “*to
follow,” does not satisfy me; because it might be understood to apply to
the hearers. Now Paul means those who, for the sake of ambition, brought
forward a new doctrine.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p26"></span>If we read it, “to teach differently,”
the meaning will be more extensive; for by this expression he will
forbid Timothy to permit any new forms of teaching to be introduced,
which do not agree with the true and pure doctrine which he had taught.
Thus, in the Second Epistle, he recommends ὑποτύπωσις,  <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) that is, a lively picture of his doctrine.
(<span id="iii.iii.i-p27.2"></span>[2Ti
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.iii.i-p27.2"></span>.) For, as the truth of God is one, so is
there but one plain manner of teaching it, which is free from false
ornament, and which partakes more of the majesty of the Spirit than of
the parade of human eloquence. Whoever departs from that, disfigures and
corrupts the doctrine itself; and, therefore, “to teach differently,”
must relate to the form.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p28"></span>If we read it, “to teach something
different,” it will relate to the matter. Yet it is worthy of
observation, that we give the name of another doctrine not only to that
which is openly at variance with the pure doctrine of the gospel, but to
everything that either corrupts the pure gospel by new and borrowed
inventions, or obscures it by ungodly speculations. For all the
inventions of men are so many corruptions of the gospel; and they who
make sport of the Scriptures, as ungodly people are accustomed to do, so
as to turn Christianity into an act of display, darken the gospel. His
manner of teaching therefore, is entirely opposed to the word of God,
and to that purity of doctrine in which Paul enjoins the Ephesians to
continue.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p29"></span><span id="iii.iii.i-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.i-p30"></span>**4** *And not to give heed to fables*
He applies the term “fables,” in my opinion, not only to contrived
falsehoods, but to trifles or fooleries which have no solidity; for it
is possible that something which is not false may yet be fabulous. In
this sense, Suetonius speaks of fabulous history,  <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) and Livy employs the word <span
id="iii.iii.i-p31.2"></span>*fabulari*, “to relate fables,” as denoting
useless and foolish talk. And, undoubtedly, the word μῦθος, (which Paul
here employs,) is equivalent to the Greek word φλυαρία, that is,
“trifles.” Moreover, by bringing forward one class by way of example, he
has removed all doubt; for disputes about genealogies are enumerated by
him amongst fables, not because everything that can be said about them
is fictitious, but because it is useless and unprofitable.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p32"></span>This passage, therefore, may thus be
explained: — “Let them not give heed to fables of that character and
description to which genealogies belong.” And that is actually the
fabulous history of which Suetonius speaks, and which even among
grammarians, has always been justly ridiculed by persons of sound
judgment; for it was impossible not to regard as ridiculous that
curiosity which, neglecting useful knowledge, spent the whole life in
examining the genealogy of Achilles and Ajax, and wasted its powers in
reckoning up the sons of Priam. If this be not endured in childish
knowledge, in which there is room for that which affords pleasure, how
much more intolerable is it heavenly wisdom  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) ?

<span id="iii.iii.i-p34"></span>*And to genealogies haste have end*
 <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) He calls them *endless,* because vain
curiosity has no limit, but continually falls from labyrinth to
labyrinth.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p36"></span>*Which produce questions* He judges of
doctrine by the fruit; for every thing that does not edify ought to be
rejected, although it has no other fault; and everything that is of no
avail but for raising contentions, ought to be doubly condemned. And
such are all the subtle questions on which ambitious men exercise their
faculties. Let us, therefore, remember, that all doctrines must be tried
by this rule, that those which contribute to edification may be
approved, and that those which give ground for unprofitable disputes may
be rejected as unworthy of the Church of God.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p37"></span>If this test had been applied during
several centuries, although religion had been stained by many errors, at
least that diabolical art of disputing, which has obtained the
appellation of Scholastic Theology, would not have prevailed to so great
an extent. For what does that theology contain but contentions or idle
speculations, from which no advantage is derived? Accordingly, the more
learned a man is in it, we ought to account him the more wretched. I am
aware of the plausible excuses by which it is defended, but they will
never make out that Paul has spoken falsely in condemning, everything of
the sort.

<span id="iii.iii.i-p38"></span>*Rather than the edification of God.*
 <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) Subtleties of this description edify
in pride, and edify in vanity, but not in God. He calls it “the
edification of God,” either because God approves of it, or because it is
agreeable to the nature of God.  <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md)

<span id="iii.iii.i-p41"></span>*Which consist in faith.* He next shews
that this edification consists in faith; and by this term he does not
exclude the love of our neighbor, or the fear of God, or repentance; for
what are all these but fruits of “faith” which always produces the fear
of God? Knowing that all the worship of God is founded on faith alone,
he therefore reckoned it enough to mention “faith,” on which all the
rest depend.

<span id="iii.iii.ii"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p1"></span><span id="iii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>[1
Timothy 1:5-11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p2"></span>**5**. Now the end of the commandment is
charity out of a pure heart, and *of* a good conscience, and *of* faith
unfeigned:

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p3"></span>**5**. Porro finis praecepti est
charitas, ex puro corde, et conscientia bona, et fide non simulata.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p4"></span>**6**. From which some having swerved
have turned aside unto vain jangling;

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p5"></span>**6**. A quibus postquam nonnulli
aberrarunt, deflexerunt ad vaniloquium,

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p6"></span>**7**. Desiring to be teachers of the
law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p7"></span>**7**. Volentes esse legis doctores, non
intelligentes quae loquuntur, neque de quibus affirmant.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p8"></span>**8**. But we know that the law *is*
good, if a man use it lawfully;

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p9"></span>**8**. Scimus autem quod lex bona sit,
si quis ea legitime utatur:

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p10"></span>**9**. Knowing this, that the law is
not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for
the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of
fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p11"></span>**9**. Sciens illud, quod justo non sit
lex posita, sed injustis et inobsequentibus, impiis et peccatoribus,
irreligiosis et profanis, parricidis et matricidis, homicidis,

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p12"></span>**10**. For whoremongers, for them that
defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured
persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound
doctrine;

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p13"></span>**10**. Scortatoribus, masculorum
concubitoribus, plagiariis, mendacibus, perjuris, et si quid aliud est,
quod sanae doctrinae adversatur;

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p14"></span>**11**. According to the glorious
gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p15"></span>**11**. Secundum Evangelium gloriae
beati Dei, quod concreditum est mihi.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p16"></span><span id="iii.iii.ii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p17"></span>Those unprincipled men with whom
Timothy had to deal, boasted of having the law on their side, in
consequence of which Paul anticipates, and shews that the law gives them
no support but was even opposed to them, and that it agreed perfectly
with the gospel which he had taught. The defense set up by them was not
unlike that which is pleaded by those who, in the present day, subject
the word of God to torture. They tell us that we aim at nothing else
than to destroy sacred theology, as if they alone nourished it in their
bosom. They spoke of the law in such a manner as to exhibit Paul in an
odious light. And what is his reply? In order to scatter those clouds of
smoke,  <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) he comes frankly forward, by
way of anticipation, and proves that his doctrine is in perfect harmony
with the law, and that the law is utterly abused by those who employ it
for any other purpose. In like manner, when we now define what is meant
by true theology, it is clearly evident that we desire the restoration
of that which had been wretchedly torn and disfigured by those triflers
who, puffed up by the empty title of theologians, are acquainted with
nothing but vapid and unmeaning trifles. *Commandment* is here put for
the law, by taking a part for the whole.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p19"></span>*Love out of a pure heart* If the law
must be directed to this object, that we may be instructed in *love,
which proceeds from faith* and a *good conscience,* it follows, on the
other hand, that they who turn the teaching of it into curious questions
are wicked expounders of the law. Besides, it is of no great importance
whither the word *love* be regarded in this passage as relating, to both
tables of the law, or only to the second table. We are commanded to love
God with our whole heart, and our neighbors as ourselves; but when love
is spoken of in Scripture, it is more frequently limited to the second
part. On the present occasion I should not hesitate to understand by it
the love both of God and of our neighbor, if Paul had employed the word
*love* alone; but when he adds, “faith, and a good conscience, and a
pure heart,” the interpretation which I am now to give will not be at
variance with his intention, and will agree well with the scope of the
passage. The sum of the law is this, that we may worship God with true
faith and a pure conscience, and that we may love one another. Whosoever
turns aside from this corrupts the law of God by twisting it to a
different purpose.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p20"></span>But here arises a doubt, that Paul
appears to prefer “love” to “faith.” I reply, they who are of that
opinion reason in an excessively childish manner; for, if love is first
mentioned, it does not therefore hold the first rank of honor, since
Paul shows also that it springs from faith. Now the cause undoubtedly
goes before its effect. And if we carefully weigh the whole context,
what Paul says is of the same import as if he had said, “The law was
given to us for this purpose, that it might instruct us in faith, which
is the mother of a good conscience and of love.” Thus we must begin with
faith, and not with love.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p21"></span>“A pure heart” and “a good conscience”
do not greatly differ from each other. Both proceed from faith; for, as
to a pure heart, it is said that “God purifieth hearts by faith.” (<span
id="iii.iii.ii-p21.1"></span>[Ac
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iii.ii-p21.1"></span>.) As to a good conscience, Peter declares
that it is founded on the resurrection of Christ. (<span
id="iii.iii.ii-p21.2"></span>[1Pe
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.iii.ii-p21.2"></span>.) From this passage we also learn that
there is no true love where there is not fear of God and uprightness of
conscience.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p22"></span>Nor is it unworthy of observation that
to each of them he adds an epithet;  <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) for, as nothing is more common, so
nothing is more easy, than to boast of faith and a good conscience. But
how few are there who prove by their actions that they are free from all
hypocrisy! Especially it is proper to observe the epithet Which he
bestows on “faith,” when he calls it *faith* *unfeigned*; by which he
means that the profession of it is insincere, when we do not perceive a
good conscience, and when love is not manifested. Now since the
salvation of men rests on faith, and since the perfect worship of God
rests on faith and a good conscience and love, we need not wonder if
Paul makes the sum of the law to consist of them.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p24"></span><span id="iii.iii.ii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p25"></span>**6** *From which some having gone
astray* He continues to pursue the metaphor of an object or end; for the
verb ἀστοχεῖν, the participle of which is here given, signifies to err
or go aside from a mark.  <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md)

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p27"></span>*Have turned aside to idle talking*
This is a remarkable passage, in which he condemns for “idle talking”
 <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) all the doctrines which do not aim
at this single end, and at the same time points out that the views and
thoughts of all who aim at any other object vanish away. It is, indeed,
possible that useless trifles may be regarded by many persons with
admiration; but the statement of Paul remains unshaken, that everything
that does not edify in godliness is ματαιολογία,  <span
id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) “idle talking.” We ought; therefore to
take the greatest possible care not to seek anything in the holy and
sacred word of God but solid edification, lest otherwise he inflict on
us severe punishment for abusing it.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p30"></span><span id="iii.iii.ii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p31"></span>**7** *Wishing to be teachers of the
law* He does not reprove those who openly attack the instruction of the
law, but those who boast of belonging to the rank of teachers of it. He
affirms that such persons have no understanding, because they harass
their faculties to no purpose by curious questions. And, at the same
time, he rebukes their pride by adding, —

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p32"></span>*Of what things they affirm*, for none
will be found more bold in pronouncing rashly on matters unknown to them
than the teachers of such fables. We see in the present day with what
pride and haughtiness the schools of the Sorbonne pronounce their
authoritative decisions. And on what subjects? On those which are
altogether hidden from the minds of men — which no word of Scripture,
and no revelation has ever made known to us. With greater boldness do
they affirm their purgatory  <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) than
the resurrection of the dead. As to their contrivances about the
intercession of the saints, if we do not hold them to be an undoubted
oracle, they cry out that the whole of religion is overturned. What
shall I say as to their vast labyrinths about the hierarchies of heaven,
relationships, and similar contrivances? It is a matter that has no end.
The Apostle declares that in all these is fulfilled what is said in a
well-known ancient proverb,

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p34"></span>“Ignorance is rash;” as he says that,
“puffed up by their carnal mind, they intrude into things which they
know not.”  
(<span id="iii.iii.ii-p34.2"></span>[Col
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.iii.ii-p34.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p35"></span><span id="iii.iii.ii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p36"></span>**8** *Now we know that the law is
good* He again anticipates the calumny with which they loaded him; for,
whenever he resisted their empty display, they seized on this shield for
their defense “What then? Do you wish to have the law buried, and
blotted out of the remembrance of men?” In order to repel this calumny,
Paul acknowledges that “the law is good,” but contends that we are
required to make a lawful use of it. Here he argues from the use of
cognate terms; for the word *lawful* (<span
id="iii.iii.ii-p36.1"></span>*legitimus*) is derived from the word *law*
(<span id="iii.iii.ii-p36.2"></span>*lex*). But he goes still further,
and shews that the law agrees excellently with the doctrine which it
teaches; and he even directs it against them.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p37"></span><span id="iii.iii.ii-p37.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p38"></span>**9** *That the law is not made for a
righteous man* The apostle did not intend to argue about the whole
office of the law, but views it in reference to men. It frequently
happens that they who wish to be regarded as the greatest zealots for
the law, give evidence by their whole life that they are the greatest
despisers of it. A remarkable and striking instance of this is found in
those who maintain the righteousness of works and defend free-will. They
have continually in their mouth these words, “Perfect holiness, merits,
satisfactions;” but their whole life cries out against them, that they
are outrageously wicked and ungodly, that they provoke in every possible
way the wrath of God, and fearlessly set his judgment at naught. They
extol in lofty terms the free choice of good and evil; but they openly
shew, by their actions, that they are the slaves of Satan, and are most
firmly held by him in the chains of slavery.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p39"></span>Having such adversaries, in order to
restrain their haughty insolence, Paul remonstrates that the law is, as
it were, the sword of God to slay them; and that neither he nor any like
him have reason for viewing the law with dread or aversion; for it is
not opposed to righteous persons, that is, to the godly and to those who
willingly obey God. I am well aware that some learned men draw an
ingenious sense out of these words; as if Paul were treating
theologically about the nature of “the law.” They argue that the law has
nothing to do with the sons of God, who have been regenerated by the
Spirit; because it was not given for righteous persons. But the
connection in which these words occur shuts me up to the necessity of
giving a more simple interpretation to this statement. He takes for
granted the well-known sentiment, that “from bad manners have sprung
good laws,” and maintains that the law of God was given in order to
restrain the licentiousness of wicked men; because they who are good of
their own accord do not need the authoritative injunction of the law.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p40"></span>A question now arises, “Is there any
mortal man who does not belong to this class?” I reply, in this passage
Paul gives the appellation “righteous” to those who are not absolutely
perfect, (for no such person will be found,) but who, with the strongest
desire of their heart, aim at what is good; so that godly desire is to
them a kind of voluntary law, without any motive or restraint from
another quarter. He therefore wished to repress the impudence of
adversaries, who armed themselves with the name of “the law” against
godly men, whose whole life exhibits the actual role of the law, since
they had very great need of the law, and yet did not care much about it;
which is more clearly expressed by the opposite clause. If there be any
who refuse to admit that Paul brings an implied or indirect charge
against his adversaries as guilty of those wicked acts which he
enumerates, still it will be acknowledged to be a simple repelling of
the slander; and if they were animated by a sincere and unfeigned zeal
for the law, they ought rather to have made use of their armor for
carrying on war with offenses and crimes, instead of employing it as a
pretext for their own ambition and silly talking.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p41"></span>*For the unrighteous and disobedient*
Instead of “unrighteous,” it would have been better if translators had
made use of the word “lawless;” for the Greek word is ἀνόμους, which
does not differ much from the second word in the clause, “disobedient.”
By sinners he means wicked persons, or those who lead a base and immoral
life.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p42"></span>*For the ungodly and profane* These
words might have been fitly rendered “profane and impure;” but I did not
wish to be fastidious in matters of little importance.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p43"></span><span id="iii.iii.ii-p43.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p44"></span>**10** *For robbers* The Latin word
<span id="iii.iii.ii-p44.1"></span>*plagium* was employed by ancient
writers to denote the carrying off or enticing the slave of another man,
or the false sale of a freeman. Those who wish to obtain more full
information on this subject may consult authors on the civil law, and
especially on the Flavian Law.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p45"></span>Here Paul glances at several classes,
which include briefly every kind of transgressions. The root is
obstinacy and rebellion; which he describes by the first two words.
*Ungodly and sinners* appear to denote transgressors of the first and
second table. To these he adds the profane and impure, or those who lead
a base and dissolute life. There being chiefly three ways in which men
injure their neighbors, namely, violence, dishonesty, and lust, he
reproves successively those three ways, as may be easily seen. First, he
speaks of violence as manifested by manslayers and murderers of parents;
secondly, he describes shameful uncleanness; and thirdly, he comes down
to dishonesty and other crimes.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p46"></span>*If there is anything else that is
contrary to sound doctrine* In this clause he maintains that his gospel
is so far from being opposed to the law, that it is a powerful
confirmation of it. He declares that by his preaching, he supports that
very sentence which the Lord pronounced in his law, against “everything
that is contrary to sound doctrine.” Hence it follows, that they who
depart from the gospel, do not adhere to the spirit of the law, but
merely pursue its shadow.

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p47"></span>*Sound doctrine* is contrasted with
frivolous questions about which he says (<span
id="iii.iii.ii-p47.1"></span>[1Ti
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iii.ii-p47.1"></span>) that foolish teachers are in an unhealthy

called diseased.  <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md)

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p49"></span><span id="iii.iii.ii-p49.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p50"></span>**11** *According to the gospel of
glory* By calling it “the gospel of glory,” that is, “the glorious
gospel,” he sharply rebukes those who labored to degrade the gospel, in
which God displays his glory. He expressly says that it *hath been
intrusted to him,* that all may know that there is no other gospel of
God than that which he preaches; and consequently, that all the fables
which he formerly rebuked are at variance both with the law and with the
gospel of God.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p6"></span><span id="iii.iii.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p7"></span>**12** *I give thanks* Great is the
dignity — of the apostleship, which Paul has claimed for himself; and he
could not, looking at his former life, be accounted at all worthy of so
high an honor. Accordingly, that he may not be accused of presumption,
he comes unavoidably to make mention of his own person, and at once
frankly acknowledges his own unworthiness, but nevertheless affirms that
he is an Apostle by the grace of God. But he goes further, and turns to
his own advantage what appeared to lessen his authority, declaring that
the grace of God shines in him so much the more brightly.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p8"></span>*To our Lord Jesus Christ* When he
gives thanks to Christ, he removes that dislike towards him which might
have been entertained, and cuts off all ground for putting this
question, “Does he deserve, or does he not deserve, so honorable an
office?” for, although in himself he has no excellence, yet it is enough
that he was chosen by Christ. There are, indeed, many who, under the
same form of words, make a show of humility, but are widely different
from the uprightness of Paul, whose intention was, not only to boast
courageously in the Lord, but to give up all the glory that was his own.
 <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md)

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p10"></span>*By putting me into the ministry*. Why
does he give thanks? Because he has been placed in the ministry; for
thence he concludes that *he hath been, accounted faithful* Christ does
not receive any in the manner that is done by ambitious  <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) people, but selects those only who are
well qualified; and therefore all on whom he bestows honor are
acknowledged by us to be worthy. For is it inconsistent with this, that
Judas, according to the prediction, (<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p11.2"></span>[Ps
109:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p11.2"></span>) was elevated for a short time, that he
might quickly fall. It was otherwise with Paul, who obtained the honor
for a different purpose, and on a different condition, when Christ
declared that he should be

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p12"></span>“a chosen vessel to him.” (<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p12.1"></span>[Ac
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p12.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p13"></span>But in this manner Paul seems to say
that faithfulness, by which he had been previously distinguished, was
the cause of his calling. If it were so, the thanksgiving would be
hypocritical and contradictory; for he would owe his apostleship not
only to God, but to his own merit. I deny, therefore, that the meaning
is, that he was admitted to the rank of an apostle, because God had
foreseen his faith; for Christ could not foresee in him anything good
but what the Father had bestowed on him. Still, therefore, it continues
to be true,

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p14"></span>“Ye have not chosen me, but I have
chosen you.”  
(<span id="iii.iii.iii-p14.2"></span>[Joh
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iii-p14.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p15"></span>On the contrary, he draws from it a
proof of his fidelity, that Christ had made him an Apostle; for he
declares that they whom Christ makes Apostles must be held to be
pronounced faithful by his decrees.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p16"></span>In a word, this judicial act is not
traced by him to foreknowledge, but rather denotes the testimony which
is given to men; as if he had said, “I give thanks to Christ, who, by
calling me into the ministry, has openly declared that he approves of my
faithfulness.”  <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md)

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p18"></span>*Who hath made me powerful* He now
introduces the mention of another act of the kindness of Christ, that he
strengthened him, or “made him powerful.” By this expression he does not
only mean that he was at first formed by the hand of God, so as to be
well qualified for his office, but he likewise includes the continued
bestowal of grace. For it would not have been enough that he was once
declared to be faithful, if Christ had not strengthened him by the
uninterrupted communication of aid. He acknowledges, therefore, that he
is indebted to the grace of Christ on two accounts, because he was once
elevated, and because he continues in his office.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p19"></span><span id="iii.iii.iii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p20"></span>**13***. Who was formerly a blasphemer
and persecutor;* a blasphemer against God, a persecutor and oppressor
against the Church. We see how candidly he acknowledges that it might be
brought against him as a reproach, and how far he is from extenuating
his sins, and how, by willingly acknowledging his unworthiness, he
magnifies the greatness of the grace of God. Not satisfied with having
called himself a “persecutor,” he intended to express more fully his
rage and cruelty by an additional terns, *an* *oppressor.*

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p21"></span>*Because I did it ignorantly in
unbelief* “I obtained pardon,” said he, “for my unbelief; because it
proceeded from ignorance;” for persecution and oppression were nothing
else than the fruits of unbelief.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p22"></span>But he appears to insinuate that there
is no room for pardon, unless when ignorance can be pleaded in excuse.
What then? Will God never pardon any one who has sinned knowingly? I
reply, we must observe the word *unbelief*;  <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) for this term limits Paul’s statement to
the first table of the law. Transgressions of the second table, although
they are voluntary, are forgiven; but he who knowingly and willingly
breaks the first table sins against the Holy Spirit, because he is in
direct opposition to God. He does not err through weakness, but, by
rushing wickedly against God, gives a sure proof of his reprobation.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p24"></span>And hence may be obtained a definition
of the sin against the Holy Ghost; first, that it is open rebellion
against God in the transgression of the first table; secondly, that it
is a malicious rejection of the truth; for, when the truth of God is not
rejected through deliberate malice, the Holy Spirit is not resisted.
Lastly, *unbelief* is here employed as a general term; and malicious
design, which is contrasted with ignorance, may be regarded as the point
of difference.  <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md)

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p26"></span>Accordingly, they are mistaken who
make the sin against the Holy Ghost to consist in the transgression of
the second table; and they are also mistaken, who pronounce blind and
thoughtless violence to be a crime so heinous. For men commit the sin
against the Holy Spirit, when they undertake a voluntary war against God
in order to extinguish that light of the Spirit which has been offered
to them. This is shocking wickedness and monstrous hardihood. Nor is
there room for doubting that, by an implied threatening, he intended to
terrify all who had been once enlightened, not to stumble against truth
which they knew; because such a fall is destructive and fatal; for if,
on account of ignorance, God forgave Paul his blasphemies, they who
knowingly and intentionally blaspheme ought not to expect any pardon.

<span id="iii.iii.iii-p27"></span>But it may be thought that what he now
says is to no purpose; for unbelief, which is always blind, can never be
unaccompanied by ignorance. I reply, among unbelievers some are so blind
that they are deceived by a false imagination of the truth; and in
others, while they are blinded, yet malice prevails. Paul was not
altogether free from a wicked disposition; but he was hurried along by
the thoughtless zeal, so as to think that what he did was right. Thus he
was an adversary of Christ, not from deliberate intention, but through
mistake and ignorance. The Pharisees, who through a bad conscience
slandered Christ, were not entirely free from mistake and ignorance; but
they were instigated by ambition, and base hatred of sound doctrine, and
even by furious rebellion against God, so that maliciously and
intentionally, and not in ignorance, they set themselves in opposition
to Christ.  <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md)

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p11"></span>**14** *And the grace of our Lord* He
again magnifies the grace of God towards himself, not only for the
purpose of removing the dislike of it and testifying his gratitude, but
also to employ it as a shield against the slanders of wicked men, whose
whole design was to bring down his apostleship to a lower level. When he
says that it *abounded,* and that, too, *beyond measure,* the statement
implies that the remembrance of past transactions was effaced, and so
completely swallowed up, that it was no disadvantage to him that God had
formerly been gracious to good men.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p12"></span>*With faith and love* Both may be
viewed as referring to God, in this sense, that God showed himself to be
true, and gave a manifestation of his love in Christ, when he bestowed
his grace upon him. But I prefer a more simple interpretation, that
“faith and love” are indications and proofs of that grace which he had
mentioned, that it might not be supposed that he boasted needlessly or
without good grounds. And, indeed, “faith” is contrasted with unbelief,
and “love in Christ” is contrasted with the cruelty which he had
exercised towards believers; as if he had said, that God had so
completely changed him, that he had become a totally different and new
man. Thus from the signs and effects he celebrates in lofty terms the
excellence of that grace which must obliterate the remembrance of his
former life.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p13"></span><span id="iii.iii.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p14"></span>**15** *It is a faithful saying* After
having defended his ministry from slander and unjust accusations, not
satisfied with this, he turns to his own advantage what might have been
brought against him by his adversaries as a reproach. He shews that it
was profitable to the Church that he had been such a person as he
actually was before he was called to the apostleship, because Christ, by
giving him as a pledge, invited all sinners to the sure hope of
obtaining pardon. For when he, who had been a fierce and savage beast,
was changed into a Pastor, Christ gave a remarkable display of his
grace, from which all might be led to entertain a firm belief that no
sinner; how heinous and aggravated so ever might have been his
transgressions, had the gate of salvation shut against him.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p15"></span>*That Christ Jesus came into the world
to save sinners* He first brings forward this general statement, and
adorns it with a preface, as he is wont to do in matters of vast
importance. In the doctrine of religion, indeed, the main point is, to
come to Christ, that, being lost in ourselves, we may obtain salvation
from him. Let this preface be to our ears like the sound of a trumpet to
proclaim the praises of the grace of Christ, in order that we may
believe it with a stronger faith. Let it be to us as a seal to impress
on our hearts a firm belief of the forgiveness of sins, which otherwise
with difficulty finds entrance into the hearts of men.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p16"></span>*A faithful saying* What was the reason
why Paul aroused attention by these words, but because men are always
disputing with themselves  <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) about
their salvation? For, although God the Father a thousand times offer to
us salvation, and although Christ himself preach about his own office,
yet we do not on that account cease to tremble, or at least to debate
with ourselves if it be actually so. Wherefore, whenever any doubt shall
arise in our mind about the forgiveness of sins, let us learn to repel
it courageously with this shield, that it is an undoubted truth, and
deserves to be received without controversy.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p18"></span>*To save sinners.* The word *sinners*
is emphatic; for they who acknowledge that it is the office of Christ to
save, have difficulty in admitting this thought, that such a salvation
belongs to “sinners.” Our mind is always impelled to look at our
worthiness; and as soon as our unworthiness is seen, our confidence
sinks. Accordingly, the more any one is oppressed by his sins, let him
the more courageously betake himself to Christ, relying on this
doctrine, that he came to bring salvation not to the righteous, but to
“sinners.” It deserves attention, also, that Paul draws an argument from
the general office of Christ, in order that what he had lately testified
about his own person might not appear to be on account of its novelty.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p19"></span>*Of whom, I am the first* Beware of
thinking that the Apostle, under a presence of modesty, spoke falsely,
 <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) for he intended to make a
confession not less true than humble, and drawn from the very bottom of
his heart.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p21"></span>But some will ask, “Why does he, who
only erred through ignorance of sound doctrine, and whose whole life, in
even other respect, was blameless before men, pronounce himself to be
the chief of sinners?” I reply, these words inform us how heinous and
dreadful a crime unbelief is before God, especially when it is attended
by obstinacy and a rage for persecution. (<span
id="iii.iii.iv-p21.1"></span>[Php
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iv-p21.1"></span>.) With men, indeed, it is easy to
extenuate, under the presence of heedless zeal, all that Paul has
acknowledged about himself; but God values more highly the obedience of
faith than to reckon unbelief, accompanied by obstinacy, to be a small
crime.  <span id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md)

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p23"></span>We ought carefully to observe this
passage, which teaches us, that a man who, before the world, is not only
innocent, but eminent for distinguished virtues, and most praiseworthy
for his life, yet because he is opposed to the doctrine of the gospel,
and on account of the obstinacy of his unbelief, is reckoned one of the
most heinous sinners; for hence we may easily conclude of what value
before God are all the pompous displays of hypocrites, while they
obstinately resist Christ.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p24"></span><span id="iii.iii.iv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p25"></span>**16** *That in me the first Jesus
Christ might shew* When he calls himself *the first,* he alludes to what
he had said a little before, that he was the first  <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) among sinners and, therefore, this word
means “chiefly,” or, “above all.” The Apostle’s meaning is, that, from
the very beginning, God held out such a pattern as might be visible from
a conspicuous and lofty platform, that no one might doubt that he would
obtain pardon, provided that he approached to Christ by faith. And,
indeed, the distrust entertained by all of us is counteracted, when we
thus behold in Paul a visible model of that grace which we desire to
see.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p27"></span><span id="iii.iii.iv-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p28"></span>**17** *Now to the King eternal* His
amazing vehemence at length breaks out into this exclamation; because he
could not find words to express his gratitude; for those sudden bursts
occur chiefly when we are constrained to break off the discourse, in
consequence of being overpowered by the vastness of the subject. And is
there anything more astonishing than Paul’s conversion? Yet, at the same
time, by his example he reminds us all that we ought never to think of
the grace manifested in God’s calling  <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) without being carried to lofty
admiration.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p30"></span>*Eternal, invisible, only wise* This
sublime praise of the grace which God had bestowed on him  <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) swallows up the remembrance of his former
life. For how great a deep is the glory of God! Those attributes which
he ascribes to God, though they belong to him always, yet are admirably
adapted to the present occasion. The Apostle calls him the *King
eternal,* not liable to any change; *Invisible,* because (<span
id="iii.iii.iv-p31.2"></span>[1Ti
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iv-p31.2"></span>) he dwells in light that is inaccessible;
and, lastly, *the Only Wise,* because he renders foolish, and condemns
as vanity, all the wisdom of men. The whole agrees with that conclusion
at which he arrives:

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p32"></span>“O the depth of the riches both of the
wisdom and knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his designs! How
unsearchable his ways!” (<span id="iii.iii.iv-p32.1"></span>[Ro
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iv-p32.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p33"></span>He means that the infinite and
incomprehensible wisdom of God should be beheld by us with such
reverence that, if his works surpass our senses, still we may be
restrained by admiration.

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p34"></span>Yet as to the last epithet *Only,* it
is doubtful whether he means to claim all glory for God alone, or calls
him the only wise, or says that he only is God. The second of these
meanings is that which I prefer; for it was in fine harmony with his
present subject to say, that the understanding of men, whatever it may
be, must bend to the secret purpose of God. And yet I do not deny that
he affirms that God alone is worthy of all glory; for, while he scatters
on his creatures, in every direction, the sparks of his glory, still all
glory belongs truly and perfectly to him alone. But either of those
meanings implies that there is no glory but that which belongs to God.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p9"></span>**18** *I recommend to thee this
commandment* All that he had introduced about his own person may be
viewed as a digression from his subject. Having to arm Timothy with
authority, it became necessary for himself to be clothed with the
highest authority; and, therefore, he took an early opportunity of
refuting an opinion which might have stood in his way. And now, after
having proved that his apostleship ought not to be less esteemed by good
men, because at one time he fought against the kingdom of Christ, this
obstacle being removed, he returns to the course of his exhortation. The
*commandment,* therefore, is the same as he mentioned at the beginning.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p10"></span>*Son Timothy* By calling him his *son,*
he not only expresses his own warm regard towards him, but also
recommends him to others under that name.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p11"></span>*According to the prophecies which went
before concerning thee*. In order to encourage him still more, he
reminds him what kind of testimony he had obtained from the Spirit of
God; for it was no small excitement, that his ministry was approved by
God, and that he had been called by divine revelation before he was
called by the votes of men. “It is disgraceful not to come up to the
expectations which men have been led to form; and how much more
disgraceful will it be to make void, as far as lies in thy power, the
judgment of God?”

<span id="iii.iii.v-p12"></span>But we must first ascertain what are
*the prophecies* of which he speaks. Some think that Paul was instructed
by revelation to confer the office on Timothy. That I acknowledge to be
true, but I add that others made revelations; for it was not without
reason that Paul made use of the plural number. Accordingly, we conclude
from these words that several prophecies were uttered concerning
Timothy, in order to recommend him to the Church.  <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) Being still a young man, he might have
been despised on account of his age; and Paul might also have been
exposed to calumnies, on account of having ordained youths, before the
proper time, to the elder’s office. Besides, God had appointed him to
great and difficult undertakings; for he was not one of the ordinary
rank of ministers, but approached very closely to that of the apostles,
and frequently occupied the place of Paul during his absence. It was,
therefore, necessary that he should receive an extraordinary testimony,
in order to make it manifest that it was not conferred on him at random
by men, but that he was chosen by God himself. To be adorned with the
applauses of the prophets was not an ordinary occurrence, or one which
was common to him along with many persons; but because there were some
circumstances to Timothy, it was the will of God that he should not be
received by men until he had been previously approved by his own voice;
it was the will of God that he should not enter into the exercise of his
office until he had been called by the revelations of the prophets. The
same thing happened to Paul and Barnabas, (<span
id="iii.iii.v-p13.2"></span>[Ac
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.iii.v-p13.2"></span>,) when they were ordained to be teachers of
the Gentiles; for it was a new and uncommon occurrence, and they could
not otherwise have escaped the charge of rashness.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p14"></span>It will now be objected by some, “If God
had formerly declared, by his prophets, what kind of minister Timothy
should be, what purpose did it serve to admonish him, to show that he
was actually such a person? Could he falsify prophecies which had been
uttered by divine revelation?” I reply, it could not happen differently
from what God had promised; but at the same time it was the duty of
Timothy, not to give himself up to sloth and inactivity, but to render a
cheerful compliance with the providence of God. It is therefore not
without good reason, that Paul, wishing to stimulate him still more,
mentions the “prophecies,” by which God might be said to have pledged
himself on behalf of Timothy; for he was thus reminded of the purpose
for which he was called.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p15"></span>*That thou by them mayest war a good
warfare.* By this he means that Timothy, relying on such approbation of
God, ought to fight more courageously. What is there that either ought
to give, or can give us greater cheerfulness than to know that God has
appointed us to do what we are doing? These are our arms, these are our
weapons of defense, by the aid of which we shall never fail.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p16"></span>By the word *warfare,* he states
indirectly, that we must maintain a contest; and this applies
universally to all believers, but especially to Christian teachers, who
may be said to be standard-bearers and leaders. It is as if he had said,
“O Timothy, if thou canst not fulfill thy office without a contest,
remember that thou art armed by divine prophecies for cherishing assured
hope of victory, and arouse thyself by calling them to remembrance. That
warfare which we maintain, having God for our leader, is a good warfare;
that is, it is glorious and successful.”

<span id="iii.iii.v-p17"></span><span id="iii.iii.v-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.v-p18"></span>**19** *Having faith and a good
conscience* I understand the word *faith* to be a general term, denoting
sound doctrine. In the same sense he afterwards speaks of “the mystery
of faith.” (<span id="iii.iii.v-p18.1"></span>[1Ti
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.iii.v-p18.1"></span>.) And, indeed, the chief things demanded
from a teacher are these two: — that he shall hold by the pure truth of
the gospel; and next, that he shall administer it with a good conscience
and holiest zeal. Where these are found, all the others will follow of
their own accord.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p19"></span>*From which some having turned aside
concerning faith* He shows how necessary it is that faith be accompanied
by a good conscience; because, on the other hand, the punishment of a
bad conscience is turning aside from the path of duty. They who do not
serve God with a sincere and a perfect heart, but give a loose rein to
wicked dispositions, even though at first they had a sound
understanding, come to lose it altogether.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p20"></span>This passage ought to be carefully
observed. We know that the treasure of sound doctrine is invaluable, and
therefore there is nothing that we ought to dread more than to have it
taken from us. But Paul here informs us, that there is only one way of
keeping it safe; and that is, to secure it by the locks and bars of a
good conscience. This is what we experience every day; for how comes it
that there are so many who, laying aside the gospel, rush into wicked
sects, or become involved in monstrous errors? It is because, by this
kind of blindness, God punishes hypocrisy; as, on the other hand, a
genuine fear of God gives strength for perseverance.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p21"></span>Hence we may learn two lessons. First,
Teachers and ministers of the gospel, and, through them all the churches
are taught with what horror they ought to regard a hypocritical and
deceitful profession of true doctrine, when they learn that it is so
severely punished. Secondly, this passage removes the offense by which
so many persons are greatly distressed, when they perceive that some,
who formerly professed their attachment to Christ and to the gospel, not
only fall back into their former superstitions but (which is far worse)
are bewildered and captivated by monstrous errors. For by such examples,
God openly supports the majesty of the gospel, and openly shows that he
cannot at all endure the profanation of it. And this is what experience
has taught us in every age. All the errors that have existed in the
Christian Church from the beginning, proceeded from this source, that in
some persons, ambition, and in others, covetousness, extinguished the
true fear of God. A bad conscience is, therefore, the mother of all
heresies; and we see that a vast number of persons, who had not
sincerely and honestly embraced the faith, are hurried along, like brute
beasts, into the reveries of the Epicureans, so that their hypocrisy is
exposed. And not only so, but contempt of God is universally prevalent,
and the licentious and disgraceful lives of almost all ranks show that
there is either none at all, or the smallest possible potion of
integrity in the world; so that there is very great reason to fear lest
the light which had been kindled may be speedily extinguished, and God
may leave the pure understanding of the gospel to be possessed by very
few.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p22"></span>*Have made shipwreck*: The metaphor
taken from shipwreck is highly appropriate; for it suggests to us, that,
if we wish to arrive safely at the harbor, our course must be guided by
a good conscience, otherwise there is danger of “shipwreck;” that is,
there is danger lest faith be sunk by a bad conscience, as by a
whirlpool in a stormy sea.  <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md)

<span id="iii.iii.v-p24"></span><span id="iii.iii.v-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iii.v-p25"></span>**20** *Of whom are Hymenaeus and
Alexander*. The former will be again mentioned in the Second Epistle, in
which the kind of “shipwreck” which he made is likewise described; for
he said that the resurrection was past. (<span
id="iii.iii.v-p25.1"></span>[2Ti
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.iii.v-p25.1"></span>.) There is reason to believe that Alexander
also was bewitched by an error so absurd. And shall we wonder at the
present day, if any are deceived by the various enchantments of Satan,
when we see that one of Paul’s companions perished by so dreadful a
fall?

<span id="iii.iii.v-p26"></span>He mentions both of them to Timothy as
persons whom he knew. For my own part, I have no doubt that this is the
same Alexander that is mentioned by Luke, and who attempted, but without
success, to quell the commotion. Now he was an Ephesian, and we have
said that this Epistle was chiefly written for the sake of the
Ephesians. We now learn what was his end; and hearing it, let us keep
possession of our faith by a good conscience, that we may hold it safe
to the last.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p27"></span>*Whom I have delivered to Satan*. As I
mentioned in the exposition of another passage, (<span
id="iii.iii.v-p27.1"></span>[1Co
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iii.v-p27.1"></span>,) there are some who interpret this to mean
that extraordinary chastisement was inflicted on those persons; and they
view this as referring to δυνάμεις, “the powers” mentioned by Paul in
the same Epistle. (<span id="iii.iii.v-p27.2"></span>[1Co
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#028.md)<span
id="iii.iii.v-p27.2"></span>.) For, as the apostles were endowed with
the gift of healing, in order to testify the favor and kindness of God
towards the godly, so against wicked and rebellious persons they were
armed with power, either to deliver them to the devil to be tormented,
or to inflict on them other chastisements. Of this “power,” Peter gave a
display in Ananias and Sapphira, (<span id="iii.iii.v-p27.3"></span>[Ac
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iii.v-p27.3"></span>,) and Paul in the magician Bar-Jesus.
(<span id="iii.iii.v-p27.4"></span>[Ac
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iii.v-p27.4"></span>.) But, for my own part, I choose rather to
explain it as relating to excommunication; for the opinion that the
incestuous Corinthian received any other chastisement than
excommunication is not supported by any probable conjecture. And, if by
excommunicating him, Paul delivered him to Satan, why should not the
same mode of expression have a similar import in this passage? Besides,
it explains very well the force of excommunication; for, since in the
Church Christ holds the seat of his kingdom, out of the Church there is
nothing but the dominion of Satan. Accordingly, he who is cast out of
the Church must be placed, for a time, under the tyranny of Satan,
until, being reconciled to the Church, he return to Christ. I make one
exception, that, on account of the enormity of the offense, he might
have pronounced a sentence of perpetual excommunication against them;
but on that point I would not venture to make a positive assertion.

<span id="iii.iii.v-p28"></span>*That they may learn not to blaspheme*.
What is the meaning of this last clause? For one who has been cast out
of the Church takes upon himself greater freedom of acting, because,
being freed from the yoke of ordinary discipline, he breaks out into
louder insolence. I reply, to whatever extent they may indulge in their
wickedness, yet the gate will be shut against them, so that they shall
not contaminate the flock; for the greatest injury done by wicked men
is, when they mingle with others under the presence of holding the same
faith. The power of doing injury is taken from them, when they are
branded with public infamy, so that none are so simple as not to know
that these are irreligious and detestable men, and therefore their
society is shunned by all. Sometimes, too, it happens that — being
struck down by this mark of disgrace which has been put upon them — they
become less daring and obstinate; and therefore, although this remedy
sometimes renders them more wicked, yet it is not always ineffectual for
subduing their fierceness.

the word “fables,” for he means not only deliberate and manifest
falsehoods, but likewise everything that is of no use, and this is
implied in the word which he employs. What, then, does Paul set aside in
this passage? All curious inquiries, all speculations which serve only
to annoy and distress the mind, or in which there is nothing but a fair
show and display, and which do not promote the salvation of those who
hear them. This must be carefully remembered, for we shall afterwards

<span id="iii.iii.i-p40"></span> “This word *edify* is sufficiently
common in the Holy Scripture, but is not understood by all. In order to
understand it aright, let us observe, that it is a comparison which is
set before us; for we ought to be temples of God, because he wishes to
dwell in us. — Those who profit in a right manner, that is, in faith, in
the fear of God, in holiness of life, are said to be edified; that is,
God builds them to be his temples, and wishes to dwell in them; and also
that we should unitedly form a temple of God, for each of us is a stone
of that temple. Thus, when each of us shall be well instructed in his
duty, and when we shall all be united in holy brotherhood, then shall we
be edified in God. It is true, that men may sometimes be edified in
pride: as we see that they who take delight in their vain imaginations,
and who spread their wings, and swell themselves out like toads, think
that they are well edified. Alas! what a poor building is this! But Paul
expressly says, that we must be edified according to God. By which he
shews, that when we shall be instructed to serve God, to render to him
pure worship, to place all our confidence in him, this is the
edification at which we must aim; and every doctrine that has that
tendency is good and holy, and ought to be received; but all that is
opposed to it must be rejected without farther dispute: it is
unnecessary to make any longer inquiry. And why must this or that be
rejected? Because it does not contribute to the edification of God.” —

<span id="iii.iii.ii-p26"></span> “Here he makes use of a metaphor taken
from those who shoot with a bow; for they have their mark at which they
aim, and do not shoot carelessly, or at random. Thus Paul shews that
God, by giving us the law, has determined to give us a sure road, that
we may not be liable to wander like vagabonds. And, indeed, it is not
without reason that Moses exhorteth the people, ‘This is the way, walk
ye in it,’ as if he had said that men do not know where they are, till
God has declared to them his will; but then they have an infallible
rule. — Let us carefully observe that God intends to address us in such
a manner that it shall not be possible for us to go astray, provided
that we take him for our guide, seeing that he is ready and willing to
perform that office, when we do not refuse such a favor. This is what
Paul meant by this metaphor; as we are told that all who have it not as
their object to rely on the grace of God, in order that they may call on
God as their Father, and may expect salvation from him, and who do not
walk with a good conscience, and with a pure heart toward their
neighborhood, are like persons who have wandered and gone astray.” —

have no defense of their purgatory, but its antiquity. ‘There it is! It

learned Papists. And then we must not call in question that we ought to
apply to the departed saints as our advocates and intercessors. To go to
God without baying as our guide St. Michael, or the Virgin Mary, or some
other saint whom the Pope shall have inserted in his calendar for the
occasion, would be of no avail. And why? On what ground? Will they find
in all the Holy Scriptures a single word, a single syllable, to shew

doctrine. For what is the advantage to be derived from the Word of God?
It is the pasture of our souls; and, next, it is a medicine. We have
bread and various kinds of food for the nourishment of our body: the
word of God is of the same use for our souls. But it is more
advantageous in this respect, that, when we are diseased with our vices,
when there are many corruptions and wicked desires, we must be purged of
them; and the Word of God serves us for various purposes, for purging,
for blood-letting, for drink, and for diet. In short, all that
physicians can apply to the human body, for healing its diseases, is not
a tenth part of what the Word of God accomplishes for the health of our
souls On that account Paul speaks here of sound doctrine. For
inquisitive and ambitious persons are always in a diseased state; they
have no health in them they are like those unhappy patients who have
lost their appetite, and who suck and lick, but cannot receive any
nourishment. But when the Word of God is applied in a right manner,
there must be a contest; there was a war against every vice; and the
Word of God must condemn them in such a manner that the hearts of men
shall be touched and pierced — shall be humbled and laid low with
sincere repentance to groan before God; and, if there be nothing else,
that they shall at least be convinced, that they shall have remorse
within themselves, that they may so be an example to all that are not
altogether incorrigible. This is the way in which the Lord wishes that
his word may be applied to a good use.” — *Fr. Ser.*

many people, as we see that there are always dogs that bark against
God’s servants, aiming at nothing but to bring them into contempt, or
rather to make their doctrine be despised and abhorred. Wishing to shut
the mouths of such people, Paul says that he is satisfied with having
the authority and warrant of Christ. As if he had said, ‘Men may reject
me, but it is enough that I am declared to be faithful by him who has
all authority in himself, and who, being the heavenly Judge, hath
pronounced it. When he put me into that office, he declared that he
reckoned me to be his servant, and that he intended to employ me in
preaching his gospel. That is enough for me. Let men contrive and
calumniate as much as they may, provided that I have Christ on my side,
let men jeer at me, it will be of no avail; For the decision pronounced
by the Lord Jesus Christ can never be recalled.’ Thus we see what was
Paul’s intention, namely, that he does not here mean that Christ foresaw
in him anything as the reason why he called him to so honorable an
office, but only that, by putting him into it, he declared and made it
evident to men, that he intended to make use of him.” — *Fr. Ser.*

because men are always disputing, and are in doubt in themselves about
their salvation.”

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p20"></span> “<span id="iii.iii.iv-p20.1"></span>Il
se faut bien donner garde de cuider que l’Apostre ait ainsi parle par
une faeon de nmodestie, et non pas qu’il se pensast en son coeur.” — “We
must guard against thinking that the Apostle spoke thus under a presence
of modesty, and that he did not think so in his heart.”

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p22"></span> “If we consider what is the chief
service that God demands and accepts, we shall know what is meant by
saying that humility is the greatest sacrifice that he approves. (<span
id="iii.iii.iv-p22.1"></span>[1Sa
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.iii.iv-p22.1"></span>.) And that is the reason why it is said
that faith may be regarded as the mother of all the virtues; it is the
foundation and source of them; and, but for this, all the virtues that
are visible, and that are highly valued by men, have no solid value;
they are so many vices which God condemns. After we have loudly praised
a man, and placed him in the rank of angels, he shall be rejected by
God, with all his fine reputation, unless he have that obedience of
faith. Thus it will be in vain for men to say, ‘I did not intend it,
that was my opinion;’ for, not withstanding their good intention and
their reputation, they must be condemned before God as rebels. This
would, at first sight, seem hard to digest. And why? For we see how men
always endeavor to escape from the hand of God, and resort to many
indirect means. And when can they find this palliation, ‘I intended to
do what was right, and why not accept my good intention?’ When that can
be alleged, we think that it is enough, but such palliations will be of
no avail before God.” — *Fr. Ser.*

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p26"></span> “<span

tous les pecheurs.” — “That he was the first, or the chief, of all
sinners.”

<span id="iii.iii.iv-p29"></span> “<span

Dieu nous a faite en nous appellant.” — “Our calling, that is, the grace
which God has displayed in calling us.”

<span id="iii.iii.v-p23"></span> “What is human life, and what is the
whole of its course? A navigation. Not only are we travelers, as the
Scripture tells us, (<span id="iii.iii.v-p23.1"></span>[1Pe
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.iii.v-p23.1"></span>,) but we have no solidity. They who travel
by land, either on foot or on horseback, have still their sure and firm
road; but in the world, instead of being on foot or on horseback, we
must be, as it were, on a sea, and we have no solid footing. We are like
people who are in a boat, and who are always within half a foot of their
death; and the boat is a sort of grave, because they see the water all
around ready to swallow them up. Thus is it with us, while we live here
below. For, on the one hand, there is the frailty that is in us, which
is more fluid than water; and then all that surrounds us is like water,
which flows on all sides, while at every minute winds, and storms. and
tempests arise. Let us therefore learn that our life is but a kind of
navigation, which we perform by water, and that we are, at the same
time, exposed to many winds and storms. And if it be so, what shall
become of us when we have not a good boat or a good pilot?” — *Fr. Ser*.
