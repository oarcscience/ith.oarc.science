<span id="vii.ii-p1"></span>A TRANSLATION OF CALVIN’S VERSION

<span id="vii.ii-p2"></span>OF THE

<span id="vii.ii-p3"></span>SECOND EPISTLE OF PAUL  
TO TIMOTHY

<span id="vii.ii.i"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.i-p1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="vii.ii.i-p3"></span>**1** Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by
the will of God, according to the promise of life, which is in Christ
Jesus,

<span id="vii.ii.i-p4"></span>**2** To Timothy, my beloved son,  <span
id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) grace, mercy, peace, from God the
Father, and from Christ Jesus our Lord.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p6"></span>**3** I give thanks to God, whom I worship
from my ancestors, in a pure conscience, as I make continual mention of
thee in my prayers night and day,

<span id="vii.ii.i-p7"></span>**4** Desiring to see thee, being mindful
of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;

<span id="vii.ii.i-p8"></span>**5** Calling to remembrance that
unfeigned faith which is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother
Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that (it dwelleth) in
thee also.  <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md)

<span id="vii.ii.i-p10"></span>**6** For which cause I advise thee to
stir up the gift of God which is in thee, by the laying on of my hands;

<span id="vii.ii.i-p11"></span>**7** For God hath not given to us a
spirit of cowardice, but of power, and of love, and of soberness.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p12"></span>**8** Be not ashamed, therefore, of the
testimony of our Lord, nor of me, who am his prisoner; but be thou a
partaker of the afflictions of the gospel, according to the power of
God;

<span id="vii.ii.i-p13"></span>**9** Who hath saved us and hath called
us with a holy calling; not according to our works, but according to his
purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before eternal
ages,

<span id="vii.ii.i-p14"></span>**10** But hath now been revealed by the
appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath indeed destroyed death,
and hath brought to light life and immortality by the gospel.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p15"></span>**11** To which I have been appointed a
herald, and an apostle, and a teacher of the gentiles;

<span id="vii.ii.i-p16"></span>**12** For which cause also I suffer
these things, but I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and
am persuaded that he is able to keep what I have intrusted to him till
that day.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p17"></span>**13** Hold the form of sound words which
thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p18"></span>**14** Guard the excellent thing to thee
by the Holy Spirit, who dwelleth in us.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p19"></span>**15** Thou knowest this, that all that
are in Asia have forsaken me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p20"></span>**16** May the Lord grant mercy to the
family of Onesiphorus; for he often refreshed me, and was not ashamed of
my chain,

<span id="vii.ii.i-p21"></span>**17** But when he was in Rome, he sought
me out diligently, and found me.

<span id="vii.ii.i-p22"></span>**18** May the Lord grant to him that he
may find mercy with the Lord on that day; and how many things he
ministered to me at Ephesus, thou knowest well.  <span
id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md)

<span id="vii.ii.ii"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p3"></span>**1** Thou therefore, my son, be strong
in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p4"></span>**2** And what things thou hast heard
from me by many witnesses, these commit thou to believing men, who shall
be able to teach others also.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p5"></span>**3** Do thou therefore endure
afflictions, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p6"></span>**4** No man who warreth entangleth
himself with the affairs of life, that he may please his general.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p7"></span>**5** And if any one also strive, he is
not crowned, unless he strive lawfully.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p8"></span>**6** The husbandman must labor before he
receive the fruits.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p9"></span>**7** Understand what I say; and may the
Lord give thee understanding in all things!

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p10"></span>**8** Remember that Jesus Christ, of the
seed of David, hath been raised from the dead, according to my gospel;

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p11"></span>**9** In which I am a sufferer, as an
evil — doer, even to bonds, but the word of God is not bound.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p12"></span>**10** Wherefore I endure all things for
the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is
in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p13"></span>**11** It is a faithful saying; for if
we die with him, we shall also live with him;

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p14"></span>**12** If we suffer, we shall also reign
with him;  <span id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) if we deny him,
 <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) he will also deny us;

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p17"></span>**13** If we are unbelieving, he
remaineth faithful; he cannot deny himself.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p18"></span>**14** Remind them of these things,
solemnly charging them before the Lord not to dispute about words, for
no use, (but) for the subversion of the hearers.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p19"></span>**15** Study to shew thyself to be
approved by God, a workman that doth not blush, dividing aright the word
of truth.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p20"></span>**16** But avoid profane and unmeaning
noises; for they will grow to greater ungodliness.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p21"></span>**17** And their word will eat as a
gangrene; of the number of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p22"></span>**18** Who concerning the truth have
erred, saying that the resurrection is already past, and subvert the
faith of some.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p23"></span>**19** Nevertheless, the foundation of
God standeth firm, having this seal, The Lord knoweth who are his, and,
Let every one that calleth on the name of Christ depart from iniquity.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p24"></span>**20** Now, in a great house there are
not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth; and
some to honor and some to dishonor

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p25"></span>**21** If any one, therefore, shall
cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel sanctified for honor,
and useful for the Lord, being prepared for every good work.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p26"></span>**22** Flee youthful desires; but follow
righteousness, faith, love, peace, with all that call on the Lord out of
a pure heart.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p27"></span>**23** But avoid foolish and
uninstructive questions, knowing that they beget quarrels.

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p28"></span>**24** But the servant of the Lord must
not fight, but must be gentle towards all, qualified for teaching,
patient to the bad,

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p29"></span>**25** Instructing *(or, chastising)*
those who resist, if some time God give to them repentance for the
acknowledgment of the truth,

<span id="vii.ii.ii-p30"></span>**26** And deliverance *(or, return to a
sound mind)* from the snare of the devil, by whom they are held captive
at his will.

<span id="vii.ii.iii"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p3"></span>**1** But know this, that in the last
days there will arise dangerous *(or,* *troublesome*) times.

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p4"></span>**2** For men will be lovers of
themselves, covetous, proud, slanderers, disobedient to parents,
unthankful, unholy;

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p5"></span>**3** Without natural affection,  <span
id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) covenant breakers, false accusers,
intemperate, fierce, despisers of those that are good;

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p7"></span>**4** Traitors, rash, haughty, lovers of
pleasures rather than of God;

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p8"></span>**5** Having a form of godliness, while
they deny the power of it.

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p9"></span>**6** Turn away from those persons; for
of those are they who creep into families, and lead captive silly women
laden with sins, who are led away by various sinful desires;

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p10"></span>**7** Always learning, while yet they
never can come to the knowledge of the truth.

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p11"></span>**8** And as Jannes and Jambres
resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth, men corrupted in
understanding, reprobate concerning the faith.

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p12"></span>**9** But they shall not proceed
further; for the madness of the latter shall be manifest to all, as was
also that of time former.

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p13"></span>**10** But thou hast closely followed
my doctrine, instruction,  <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md)
purpose, faith, meekness, love, patience;

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p15"></span>**11** Persecutions, afflictions, which
befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I
endured; but out of them all the Lord delivered me.

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p16"></span>**12** And all who wish to live a godly
life in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p17"></span>**13** But wicked men and impostors
will grow worse and worse, going astray, and leading others astray.

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p18"></span>**14** But as for thee, continue in
those things which thou hast learned, and which have been intrusted to
thee, knowing from whom thou hast learned them;

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p19"></span>**15** And that from (thy) childhood
thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise to
salvation, through faith which is in Christ Jesus.

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p20"></span>**16** All scripture (*or, the whole of
scripture*) is divinely inspired, and is profitable for doctrine, for
reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness;

<span id="vii.ii.iii-p21"></span>**17** That the man of God may be
perfect, being made ready for every good work.

<span id="vii.ii.iv"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p3"></span>**1** I adjure thee, therefore, before
God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead,
at his appearing and his kingdom.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p4"></span>**2** Preach the word; apply thyself in
season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all gentleness and
doctrine.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p5"></span>**3** For there will be a time, when they
will not endure sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, shall heap up
to themselves according to their sinful desires;

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p6"></span>**4** And they shall turn away their ears
from the truth, and shall be turned to fables.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p7"></span>**5** But watch thou in all things,
endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, render thy ministry
approved.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p8"></span>**6** For I am now offered as a
sacrifice, and the time of my dissolution is at hand.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p9"></span>**7** I have fought the good fight, I
have finished the course, I have kept the faith.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p10"></span>**8** Henceforth there is laid up for me
the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will
render to me on that day, and not to me only, but likewise to all who
love his coming.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p11"></span>**9** Make haste to come to me quickly.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p12"></span>**10** For Demas hath forsaken me,
having embraced this world, and is gone away to Thessalonica, Crescens
to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p13"></span>**11** Luke alone is with me. Take Mark,
and bring him with thee, for he is profitable to me for the ministry.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p14"></span>**12** And I have sent Tychicus to
Ephesus.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p15"></span>**13** When thou shalt come, bring the
cloak which I left at Carpus, and the books, and the parchments.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p16"></span>**14** Alexander the coppersmith hath
done me many evil things; may the Lord reward him according to his
works!

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p17"></span>**15** Of whom beware thou also; for he
vehemently opposed our discourses.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p18"></span>**16** At my first defense no man
assisted me, but all forsook me; may it not be laid to their charge!

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p19"></span>**17** But the Lord assisted and
strengthened me, that through me the proclamation might be confirmed,
and that all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the
mouth of the lion.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p20"></span>**18** And the Lord will deliver me from
every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom, to whom
be glory for ever and ever! Amen.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p21"></span>**19** Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the
family of Onesiphorus.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p22"></span>**20** Erastus remained at Corinth; but
I left Trophimus at Miletum sick.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p23"></span>**21** Make haste to come before winter.
Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the
brethren.

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p24"></span>**22** The Lord Jesus Christ (be) with
thy spirit. Grace be with thee. Amen

<span id="vii.ii.iv-p25"></span>This Second (Epistle) was written from
Rome to Timothy, who was the first bishop ordained at Ephesus, when Paul
was brought the second time before Caesar Nero.
