<span id="v.ii-p1"></span>A TRANSLATION of

<span id="v.ii-p2"></span>CALVIN’S VERsION of

<span id="v.ii-p3"></span>THE BOOK OF MALACHI.

<span id="v.ii.i"></span>

<span id="v.ii.i-p1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="v.ii.i-p3"></span>**1** The burden of the word of Jehovah on
Israel, by Malachi, —

<span id="v.ii.i-p4"></span>**2** I have loved you, saith Jehovah; But
ye have said, In what hast thou loved us? Was not Esau a brother to
Jacob? saith Jehovah;

<span id="v.ii.i-p5"></span>**3** Yet I loved Jacob, and Esau I hated:
And I have set his mountains a waste And his heritage for the serpents
of the desert.

<span id="v.ii.i-p6"></span>**4** If Edom shall say, “We have been
diminished, But we shall return and build houses;” *Yet* thus saith
Jehovah of hosts, — “They shall build, but I will pull down;” And they
shall be called, “The border of ungodliness,” And, “The people with whom
Jehovah is angry forever:”

<span id="v.ii.i-p7"></span>**5** And your eyes shall see, and ye shall
say, — Magnified let Jehovah be throughout the border of Israel.

<span id="v.ii.i-p8"></span>**6** A son honours his father, and a
servant his master: If then I be a father, where is my honour? And if I
be a master, where is my fear? Saith Jehovah of hosts to you, priests,
Who despise my name: But ye have said, In what have we despised thy
name?

<span id="v.ii.i-p9"></span>**7** Ye offer on my altar polluted bread:
Ye have also said, By what have we polluted thee? When ye say, The table
of Jehovah, It is contemptible.

<span id="v.ii.i-p10"></span>**8** When ye offer the blind for
sacrifice, it is no evil! And when the lame and the sick ye offer, it is
no evil! Offer it now I pray to thy governor; Will he be pleased with
thee, or accept Thy person, saith Jehovah of hosts?

<span id="v.ii.i-p11"></span>**9** And now I pray entreat the favour of
God! And merciful will he be to us! By your hand has this been done;
Will he regard your persons? Saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="v.ii.i-p12"></span>**10** Who is there even among you who
closes the doors? And do ye not kindle my altar in vain? I delight not
in you saith Jehovah of hosts, And an offering I will not receive from
your hand.

<span id="v.ii.i-p13"></span>**11** Verily, from the rising of the sun
to its setting Great shall be my name among the nations. And in every
place incense shall be offered To my name, and a pure offering; For
great shall be my name among the nations, Saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="v.ii.i-p14"></span>**12** But ye have profaned it by saying,
The table of Jehovah is polluted, Its provision is his contemptible
food. (**505**)

<span id="v.ii.i-p15"></span>**13** Ye have also said, Behold weariness?
And ye have snuffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts; And offered the torn
and the lame and the sick, And brought an oblation! Shall I accept this
from your hand, Saith Jehovah? (**508**)

<span id="v.ii.i-p16"></span>**14** But cursed be the deceitful, Who,
having in his flock a male, Vows and offers what is corrupt to Jehovah
For a great king am I, Saith Jehovah of hosts, And my name is terrible
among the nations.

<span id="v.ii.ii"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.ii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="v.ii.ii-p3"></span>**1** And not to you is this command, O
priests;

<span id="v.ii.ii-p4"></span>**2** If ye will not hear not lay it to
heart, To give glory to my name, Saith Jehovah of hosts, I will send on
you a curse, And will curse your blessings; Yea, I have cursed them,
Because ye lay it not to heart.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p5"></span>**3** Behold, I will destroy your seed And
scatter dung on your faces, The dung of your solemn feasts; And it shall
take you to itself: And ye shall know,

<span id="v.ii.ii-p6"></span>**4** That I have sent to you this command,
That my covenant may be with Levi, Saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p7"></span>**5** My covenant with him was that of life
and peace; And I gave him fear, and he feared me, And before my name he
was humble; (**524**)

<span id="v.ii.ii-p8"></span>**6** The law of truth was in his mouth,
And iniquity was not found in his lips; In peace and uprightness he
walked before me, And many he restored from iniquity.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p9"></span>**7** Verily the lips of the priest should
keep knowledge, And the law should they seek from his mouth, For the
messenger of Jehovah of hosts is he:

<span id="v.ii.ii-p10"></span>**8** But ye have departed from the way,
To stumble have ye made many in the law; Ye have therefore violated the
covenant of Levi, Saith Jehovah of hosts:

<span id="v.ii.ii-p11"></span>**9** Therefore have I also made you
Contemptible and base before all the people, As ye have not kept my ways
And had respect of persons in the law.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p12"></span>**10** Is there not one father to us all?
Hath not one God created us? Why do we deal falsely, every one with his
brother? So as to pollute the covenant of our fathers.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p13"></span>**11** Perfidiously has Judah acted, And
abomination has been done In Israel and in Jerusalem; For polluted hath
Judah (**544**) The holiness of Jehovah, which he loved, And hath
married the daughter of another god.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p14"></span>**12** Cut off will Jehovah The man who
doeth this, The prompter and the respondent, From the tabernacles of
Jacob; And him who bringeth an oblation to Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p15"></span>**13** And this have ye in the second
place done — Covering with tears the altar of Jehovah, With weeping and
with wailing, Because there is no more regard to the offering, And no
receiving of what is acceptable from you hand.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p16"></span>**14** And ye have said, Why is this?
Because Jehovah has been witness Between thee and the wife of thy youth;
With whom thou hast dealt unfaithfully, When yet she is thy consort, And
the wife of thy covenant.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p17"></span>**15** But did he not make one? And had he
not an exuberance of spirit? And why one? That he might seek \[secure\]
good seed. Therefore watch over your spirit; And with the wife of thy
youth Deal not thou unfaithfully.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p18"></span>**16** For if thou hatest, dismiss, Saith
Jehovah, God of Israel; For he covers violence with his garment, Saith
Jehovah of hosts: Therefore watch over you spirit, And deal not
unfaithfully.

<span id="v.ii.ii-p19"></span>**17** Ye have wearied Jehovah with your
words; But ye have said, How have we wearied him? By saying, Whosoever
doeth evil Is acceptable in the eyes of Jehovah, And in them he takes
delight; Or, Where is the God of judgment?

<span id="v.ii.iii"></span>

<span id="v.ii.iii-p1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.iii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="v.ii.iii-p3"></span>**1** Behold I will send my messenger, And
he will clear the way before me: And presently he shall come to his
temple, The Lord whom ye seek, Even the messenger of the covenant whom
ye desire; Behold, he cometh, saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p4"></span>**2** But who will endure the day of his
coming? And who will stand when he appears. For he will be like a
purifying fire And like the herb of the fullers:

<span id="v.ii.iii-p5"></span>**3** And he shall sit as the purifier and
cleanser of silver, And he will cleanse the sons of Levi, And fuse them
as silver and gold,

<span id="v.ii.iii-p6"></span>**4** That they may offer to Jehovah An
offering in righteousness; And acceptable to Jehovah Shall be the
offering of Judah and Jerusalem, As in the days of old, as in former
years.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p7"></span>**5** I will also draw nigh to you for
judgment, And will be a swift witness Against the sorcerers and the
adulterers And those who swear to a falsehood, And who withhold the
wages of the hireling, And wrong the widow, the orphan, and the
stranger, And who fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p8"></span>**6** Because I am Jehovah, I change not;
Therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p9"></span>**7** From the days of your fathers Ye
have turned from my statutes and have not kept them; Return to me, and I
will return to you, Saith Jehovah of hosts: But ye have said, How are we
to return?

<span id="v.ii.iii-p10"></span>**8** Will a man rob the gods? (**585**)
But ye have robbed me: yet ye have said, In what have we robbed thee? In
the tithes and in the offerings.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p11"></span>**9** With a curse are ye cursed, For ye
have robbed me, the whole of the nation.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p12"></span>**10** Bring ye all the tithes to the
store-house, And let there be food in my house; And prove me now by
this, Saith Jehovah of hosts, Whether I will not open for you The
windows of heaven, And draw out for you a blessing, Until there be a
superabundance:

<span id="v.ii.iii-p13"></span>**11** I will also restrain for you the
devourer, That he may not destroy the fruit of your land; And not
fruitless will be the vine for you in the field, Saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p14"></span>**12** Then blessed shall all nations
call you, For ye shall be a land of delight, Saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p15"></span>**13** Strong against me have been your
words, Saith Jehovah of hosts: But ye have said, In what have we spoken
against thee? Ye have said, Vain it is to serve God,

<span id="v.ii.iii-p16"></span>**14** And what profit is it, That we
have kept his charge, And that we have walked humbly Before Jehovah of
hosts:

<span id="v.ii.iii-p17"></span>**15** And now happy we call the proud;
yea, built up are they who do iniquity, And those who tempt God, and
they are delivered.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p18"></span>**16** Then spake those who feared
Jehovah, Every one to his friend; And hearken did Jehovah and hear, And
written was a book of remembrance Before him, for those who feared
Jehovah And who thought on his name:

<span id="v.ii.iii-p19"></span>**17** And they shall be to me, saith
Jehovah of hosts, In the day which I appoint, a peculiar treasure; And I
will spare them, As a man spares his son who serves him.

<span id="v.ii.iii-p20"></span>**18** Then ye shall return and see the
difference Between the righteous and the ungodly, Between him who serves
God And him who does not serve him.

<span id="v.ii.iv"></span>

<span id="v.ii.iv-p1"></span>

<span id="v.ii.iv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="v.ii.iv-p3"></span>**1** For behold the day! it comes burning
as an oven And all the proud and all who do iniquity Shall be stubble;
And burn them up shall the day that is coming, Saith Jehovah of hosts;
For it shall leave them neither root nor branch.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p4"></span>**2** But arise to you, who fear my name,
Shall the sun of righteousness, With healing in its beams; And ye shall
go forth and leap, Like fattened calves:

<span id="v.ii.iv-p5"></span>**3** And ye shall tread down the ungodly,
For they shall be dust under the soles of your feet, In the day which I
appoint, Saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p6"></span>**4** Remember the law of Moses my servant
Which I committed to him on Horeb, For all Israel, *even* the statutes
and judgments.

<span id="v.ii.iv-p7"></span>**5** Behold I send to you Elijah the
prophet, Before it comes, the day of Jehovah, great and terrible;

<span id="v.ii.iv-p8"></span>**6** And he shall turn the heart of
fathers to *their* sons, And the heart of sons to their fathers; Lest I
come and smite the land with a curse.
