<span id="iii.iv-p1"></span>Chapter 3

<span id="iii.iv.i"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i-p1"></span><span id="iii.iv.i-p1.1"></span>[Zech.
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#002.md)<span id="iii.iv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i-p2"></span>**1.** And he shewed me Joshua the high
priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his
right hand to resist him.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p3"></span>**1.** Et ostendit mihi Iehosuah
sacerdotem magnum stantem in conspectu angeli Iehovae**,** et Satan
stantem ad dexteram ejus**,** ut adversaretur illi.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p4"></span>**2.** And the Lord said unto Satan, The
Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem
rebuke thee: *is* not this a brand plucked out of the fire?

<span id="iii.iv.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et dixit Iehova ad Satan**,**
increpet te Iehova**,** Satan**,** et increpet (hoc est**,** iterum
increpet) te Iehova**,** qui elegit Ierusalem: annon hic torris erutus
ex igne?

<span id="iii.iv.i-p6"></span> 

<span id="iii.iv.i-p7"></span><span id="iii.iv.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i-p8"></span>We have said at the beginning that
Zechariah was sent for this end — to encourage weak minds: for it was
difficult to entertain hope in the midst of so much confusion. Some, but
a small portion of the nation, had returned with the tribe of Judah: and
then immediately there arose many enemies by whom the building of the
city and of the temple was hindered; and when the faithful viewed all
their circumstances, they could hardly entertain any hope of a
redemption such as had been promised. Hence Zechariah labored altogether
for this end — to show that the faithful were to look for more than they
had reason to expect from the aspect of things at the time, and that
they were to direct their eyes and their thoughts to the power of God,
which was not as yet manifested, and which indeed God purposely designed
not to exercise, in order to try the patience of the people.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p9"></span>This is the subject which he now pursues,
when he says, that *Joshua the priest* was shown to him, with *Satan at
his right hand to oppose him*  <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) God
was, however, there also. But when Zechariah says, that the priest
Joshua was shown to him as here represented, it was not only done in a
vision, but the fact was known to all; that is, that Joshua was not
adorned with a priestly glory, such as it was before the exile; for the
dignity of the priest before that time was far different from what it
was after the return of the people; and this was known to all. But the
vision was given to the Prophet for two reasons — that the faithful
might know that their contest was with Satan, their spiritual enemy,
rather than with any particular nations — and also that they might
understand that a remedy was at hand, for God stood in defense of the
priesthood which he had instituted. God, then, in the first place,
purposed to remind the faithful that they had to carry on war, not with
flesh and blood, but with the devil himself: this is one thing. And then
his design was to recall them to himself, that they might consider that
he would be their sure deliverer from all dangers. Since we now perceive
the design of this prophecy, we shall proceed to the words of the
Prophet.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p12"></span>He says that Joshua was shown to him.
This was done no doubt in a prophetic vision: but yet Zechariah saw
nothing by the spirit but what was known even to children. But, as I
have already said, we must observe the intentions of the vision, which
was, that the faithful might understand that their neighbors were
troublesome to them, because Satan turned every stone and tried every
experiment to make void the favor of God. And this knowledge was very
useful to the Jews, as it is to us at this day. We wonder why so many
enemies daily rage against us, and why the whole world burn against us
with such implacable hatred; and also why so many intrigues arise, and
so many assaults are made, which have not been excited through
provocation on our part: but the reason why we wonder is this, — because
we bear not in mind that we are fighting with the devil, the head and
prince of the whole world. For were it a fixed principle in our minds,
that all the ungodly are influenced by the devil, there would then be
nothing new in the fact, that all unitedly rage against us. How so?
Because they are moved by the same spirit, and their father is a
murderer, even from the beginning. (<span
id="iii.iv.i-p12.1"></span>[Joh
8:44](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#044.md)<span
id="iii.iv.i-p12.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.iv.i-p13"></span>We hence see that the faithful were
taught what was extremely necessary, — that their troubles arose from
many nations, because Satan watched for their ruin. And though this
vision was given to the Prophet for the sake of his own age, yet it no
doubt belongs also to us; for that typical priesthood was a
representation of the priesthood of Christ, and Joshua, who was then
returned from exile, bore the character of Christ the Son of God. Let us
then know that Christ never performs the work of the priesthood, but
that Satan stands at his side, that is, devises all means by which he
may remove and withdraw Christ from his office. It hence follows, that
they are much deceived, who think that they can live idly under the
dominion of Christ: for we all have a warfare, for which each is to arm
and equip himself. Therefore at this day, which we see the world seized
with so much madness, that it assails us, and would wholly consume us,
let not our thoughts be fixed on flesh and blood, for Satan is the chief
warrior who assails us, and who employs all the rage of the world to
destroy us, if possible, on every side. Satan then ever stands at
Christ’s right hand, so as not to allow him in peace to exercise his
priestly office.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p14"></span><span id="iii.iv.i-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.i-p15"></span>Now follows another reason for the
prophecy, — that God interposes and takes the part of his Church against
Satan. Hence he says, *Rebuke thee Satan let Jehovah,*  <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) *rebuke thee let Jehovah, who has chosen
Jerusalem*. God speaks here; and yet he seems to be the angel of
Jehovah:  <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) but this is not
inscrutable; for as in the last verse, where Zechariah says that Joshua
stood before the Angel of Jehovah, Christ is doubtless meant, who is
called an angel and also Jehovah; so also he may be named in this verse.
But that no contentious person may say that we refine on the words too
much, we may take them simply thus, — that God mentions here his own
name in the third person; and this mode of so speaking is not rare in
Scripture,

<span id="iii.iv.i-p20"></span>“Jehovah rained from God.” (<span
id="iii.iv.i-p20.1"></span>[Ge
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.iv.i-p20.1"></span>).

<span id="iii.iv.i-p21"></span>Why did Moses speak thus? Even to show
that when God fulminated against Sodom, he did not adopt a common mode
of proceeding, but openly showed that it was an unusual and a singular
judgment. Thus the expression here is emphatic, *Rebuke thee let
Jehovah*, that is, I myself will rebuke thee. However, were any one to
consider well the whole context, he could not but allow that the words
may properly be applied to Christ, who is the portion of his Church, and
that therefore he was the angel before whom Joshua stood; and he himself
shows afterwards that the Church would be safe under his patronage. *Let
Jehovah then rebuke thee, Satan, let him rebuke thee*. The repetition
more fully confirms what Zechariah meant to show, even that sufficient
protection would be found in God alone for the preservation of the
Church, how much soever Satan might employ all his powers for its ruin,
and that though God would not immediately give help and restrain Satan,
yet a firm hope was to be entertained, for this would be done in time
the most seasonable. The import of the whole is, — that though God had
hitherto let loose Satan to assail the Church as to the priesthood, yet
God would be the faithful guardian of his Church, and would check Satan,
that he might not execute what he intended; and further, that many
contests must be patiently endured, until the period of the warfare be
completed. We now then see what the Prophet had in view in these words.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p22"></span>But the rebuke of God is not to be
regarded as being only in words, but must be referred to that power by
which God subverts and lays prostrate all the attempts of Satan. At the
same time he mentions the end for which this rebuke was given; it was,
that the Church might continue safe and secure, *Let Jehovah, who has
chosen Jerusalem, rebuke thee*. These words are to be read, not apart,
but as joined with the former, as though he had said, “Let God raise up
his hand for the salvation of his chosen people, so as to put thee,
Satan, to flight with all thy furies.” This is the meaning. Let us
therefore know, that God is not simply the enemy of Satan, but also one
who has taken us under his protection, and who will preserve us safe to
the end. Hence God, as our Redeemer and the eternal guardian of our
salvation, is armed against Satan in order to restrain him. The warfare
then is troublesome and difficult, but the victory is not doubtful, for
God ever stands on our side.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p23"></span>But we are at the same time reminded,
that we are not to regard what we have deserved in order to gain help
from God; for this wholly depends on his gratuitous adoption. Hence,
though we are unworthy that God should fight for us, yet his election is
sufficient, as he proclaims war against Satan in our behalf. Let us then
learn to rely on the gratuitous adoption of God, if we would boldly
exult against Satan and all his assaults. It hence follows, that those
men who at this day obscure, and seek, as far as they can, to extinguish
the doctrine of election, are enemies to the human race; for they strive
their utmost to subvert every assurance of salvation.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p24"></span>He at last adds, *Is not this a brand
snatched from the fire?*  <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) Here God
makes known the favor he had manifested towards the high priest, that
the faithful might be convinced that Joshua would overcome his enemies,
as God would not forsake his own work; for the end ever corresponds with
the beginning as to God’s favor; he is never wearied in the middle
course of his beneficence. This is the reason why he now objects to
Satan and says, “Why! God has wonderfully snatched this priest as a
brand from the burning: as then the miraculous power of God appears in
the return of the high priest, what dost thou mean, Satan? Thou risest
up against God, and thinkest it possible to abolish the priesthood,
which it has pleased him in his great favor hitherto to preserve. See
whence has the priest come forth. While he was in Chaldea, he seemed to
be in the lower regions; yet God delivered him from thence: and now,
when he sits in the temple and is performing his office, is it possible
for thee to pull down from heaven him whom thou could not detain in
hell?” We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet as to this similitude.
He then adds —

<span id="iii.iv.ii"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p1"></span><span id="iii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>[Zech.
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#004.md)<span id="iii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p2"></span>**3.** Now Joshua was clothed with filthy
garments, and stood before the angel.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p3"></span>**3.** Et Iehosuah erat induts vestibus
sordidis; et stabat in conspectu angeli.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p4"></span>**4.** And he answered and spake unto
those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from
him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass
from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p5"></span>**4.** Et respondit et dixit his qui
stabant coram ipso**,** dicendo**,** Tollite vestes sordidas ab eo (de
super eo**,** ad verbum;) et dixit ad eum**,** Ecce transire feci (hoc
est**,** abstuli) abs te iniquitatem tuam**,** et vestiam te mutatoriis.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p6"></span> 

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p7"></span><span id="iii.iv.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p8"></span>Zechariah adds here another thing, — that
Joshua had on mean garments, but that new garments were given him by the
angel’s command. And by this he means, that though the priesthood had
been for a time contemptible, it would yet recover whatever dignity it
had lost. But he ever leads the minds of the faithful to this point, —
to look for what they did not then see, nor could conjecture from the
state of things at that time. It is certain that the sacerdotal
vestments, after the return from exile, were not such as they were
before; for they were not sumptuously woven, nor had attached to them so
many precious stones. Though Cyrus had bountifully supplied great
abundance of gold and silver for the worship of God, yet the chief
priest did not so shine with precious stones and the work of the
Phrygians as before the exile. Hence, what was shown to Zechariah was
then well known to all. But we ought to notice the latter clause, — that
the angel commanded a change of garments. The Prophet then bids the
faithful to be of good cheer, though the appearance of the priesthood
was vile and mean, because God would not overlook its contemptible
state; but the time of restoration had not yet come; when it came, the
ancient dignity of the priesthood would again appear.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p9"></span>With regard to the words, the first thing
to be observed is the fact, that Joshua *stood before the angel*, having
on *sordid* or torn *garments*  <span id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) The
repetition seems to be without reason; for he had said before that
Joshua stood before the angel of God. Why then does he now repeat that
he stood before the angel? That the faithful might take courage; because
it was God’s evident purpose that the chief priest should remain there
in his sordid garments; for we think that God forgets us when he does
not immediately succor us, or when things are in a confused state. Hence
Zechariah meets his doubt by saying, that Joshua stood before the angel.
He further reminded them, that though the whole world should despise the
priesthood, it was yet under the eyes of God. Conspicuous were other
priests in the eyes of men, and attracted the admiring observation of
all, as it is well known; but all heathen priesthoods, we know, were of
no account before God. Hence though heathen priesthoods shone before
men, they were yet abominations only in the sight of God; but the
priesthood of Joshua, however abject and vile it may have been, was yet,
as Zechariah testifies, esteemed before God.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p11"></span><span id="iii.iv.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p12"></span>We now see that he who is often said to
be Jehovah is called an angel: the name therefore of Angel as well as of
Jehovah, I doubt not, ought to be applied to the person of Christ, who
is truly and really God, and at the same time a Mediator between the
Father and the faithful: and hence he authoritatively commanded the
angels who were present; for Christ was there, but with his hosts. While
therefore the angels were standing by, ready to obey, he is said to have
bidden them to strip the high priest of his mean garments.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p13"></span>Afterwards the angel addresses Joshua
himself, *See, I slave made to pass from thee thine iniquity, and now I
will clothe thee with new or other garments*  <span
id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) When the angel said that he had *taken
away iniquity*, he justly reminded them of the filthiness contracted by
the priest as well as by the people; for they had denuded themselves of
all glory by their iniquities. We hence see that the mouths of the Jews
were here closed, that they might not clamor against God, because he
suffered them still to continue in their sordid condition, for they
deserved to continue in such a state; and the Lord for this reason
called their filth, iniquity. He further teaches us, that though the
Jews fully deserved by their sins to rot in their struggle and
filthiness, yet the Lord would not finally allow their unworthiness to
prevent him from affording relief.

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p15"></span>The import of the prophecy then is this,
— That however much the mean outward condition of the high priest might
offend the Jews, they were still to entertain hope; for the remedy was
in God’s power, who would at length change the dishonor and reproach of
the high priest into very great glory, even when the time of gratuitous
remission or of good pleasure arrived.

<span id="iii.iv.iii"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast
made us a royal priesthood in thy Son, that we may daily offer to thee
spiritual sacrifices, and be devoted to thee, both in body and soul, — O
grant, that we, being endued with thy power, may boldly fight against
Satan, and never doubt but that thou wilt finally give us the victory,
though we may have to undergo many troubles and difficulties: and may
not the contempt of the world frighten or dishearten us, but may we
patiently bear all our reproaches, until thou at length stretches forth
thine hand to raise us up to that glory, the perfection of which now
appears in our head, and shall at last be clearly seen in all the
members, in the whole body, even when he shall come to gather us into
that celestial kingdom, which he has purchased for us by his own blood.
— Amen.

<span id="iii.iv.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="iii.iv.iv"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.iv-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Fortieth

<span id="iii.iv.v"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.v-p1"></span><span id="iii.iv.v-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#005.md)<span id="iii.iv.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.v-p2"></span>**5.** And I said, Let them set a fair
mitre upon his head. So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed
him with garments. And the angel of the LORD stood by.

<span id="iii.iv.v-p3"></span>**5.** Et dixit**,** Ponant cidarim puram
(*aut***,** diadema purum) super caput ejus: et posuerunt didema super
caput ejus**,** et induerant (*id est***,** postquam induerant) illum
vestibus: et angelus Iehovae stabat.

<span id="iii.iv.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.iv.v-p5"></span><span id="iii.iv.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.v-p6"></span>The Prophet had said that Joshua was
clothed in splendid and beautiful garments, who had on before such as
were sordid, and that this was done by the command of the angel: he now
adds, that he wished that a still greater glory should be bestowed on
him, for he saw that something was wanting. He therefore desired that
the high priest should be adorned with a crown, so that his dress might
in every way correspond with the dignity of his office. But what is here
stated, that the Prophet spoke,  <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) is
not to be taken as spoken authoritatively, but rather expressed as a
wish, as though he had said, that it was indeed a pleasant and
delightful spectacle to see the high priest decently and honorably
clothed; but that it was also desirable, that a crown or a diadem should
be added, as a symbol of the priesthood, and not of royalty. There is
indeed no disadvantage in considering royalty also as signified; for the
kingly office, we know, is united with the priestly in the person of
Christ: but I take the crown here to be the priest’s mitre; for we know
that this was the chief ornament whenever the priest came to the altar
of incense. But as to the main point, we must bear in mind the design of
the Prophet, — that the high priest was adorned with splendid vestments,
and yet his dignity appeared only in part; therefore the Prophet desires
that a pure crown or mitre should be added: and he says that this took
place even in the presence of the angel, thereby intimating that his
wish was by God approved.

<span id="iii.iv.v-p8"></span>Now we ought first to contemplate the zeal
and godly concern of the Prophet, which he had for the glory and honor
of the priesthood; for though he regarded with joy the splendid dress of
the high priest, he could not restrain himself from wishing that the
highest ornament should be added. And this example is exhibited to us
for imitation, so that we ought to desire the increase of those favors
of God, by which the priesthood of Christ is signalised, until it
arrives at the most perfect state. But we see that many are against such
a wish; for at this day there are those who profess some zeal for true
religion, but are satisfied with a mere shadow; or at least, it would
abundantly satisfy them to see the Church half purified: and the world
is full of men who indeed confess that the Church is defiled by many
pollutions, but wish only for some small measure of reformation. But the
Prophet seems to invite us to do a very different thing: he saw that the
high priest was already adorned with new garments; but when he
considered that the honor of the priesthood was not fully restored, he
wished the mitre to be also added. And by saying that the angels
seconded his wish, he encourages us fully to believe, that if we desire
from the heart that his glory should be given to Christ, God will hear
our prayers: for the Prophet, when he sighed, did not in vain ask the
angel to put a mitre on the high priest.

<span id="iii.iv.v-p9"></span>The expression, that *the angel of God
stood*, is not without meaning. He was not an idle spectator; and it is
intimated that God had not only once a care for the priesthood, but that
the angel was always watching to defend Joshua; for it would not be
enough to be once adorned by God, who presides over the Church, except
his guardianship were perpetual. We now then understand the import of
the words. It follows —

<span id="iii.iv.vi"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p1"></span><span
id="iii.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
3:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#006.md)<span id="iii.iv.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p2"></span>**6.** And the angel of the Lord
protested unto Joshua, saying,

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p3"></span>**6.** Et contestatus est Angelus Iehovae
Iehosuam dicendo**,**

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p4"></span>**7.** Thus saith the Lord of hosts; If
thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou
shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will
give thee places to walk among these that stand by.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p5"></span>**7.** Sic dicit Iehova exercituum**,**
Si in viis meis ambulaveris**,** et custodiam meam custodieris**,** tu
quoque judicabis domum meam (vel**,** gubernabis; \[<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p5.1"></span>דוז\] est judicare**,** sed verbum illud
refertur ad quodlibet regimen**,** ut alibi visum; gubernabis ergo domum
meam**,** hoc est**,** praeris Templo meo;) atque etiam custodies atria
mea: et dabo tibi transitus inter istos qui adstant.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p6"></span> 

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p7"></span><span id="iii.iv.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p8"></span>Here the Prophet shows for what purpose
he gave Joshua his appropriate dress and splendor; and he teaches us,
that it was not done simply as a favor to man, but because God purposed
to protect the honor of his own worship. This is the reason why the
angel exhorts Joshua; for it behaves us ever to consider for what end
God deals so liberally with us and favors us with extraordinary gifts.
All things ought to be referred to his glory and worship, otherwise
every good thing he bestows on us is profaned. And this is especially to
be regarded when we speak of his Church and its government; for we know
how ready men are to turn what God gives to his Church to serve the
purpose of their own tyranny.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p9"></span>It is God’s will that he should be
attended to when he speaks by his servants and those whom he has
appointed as teachers. But we see from the beginning of the world how
ambitious and proud men under this pretense exercised great tyranny, and
thus expelled God from his own government: nay, the vassals of Satan
often arrogate to themselves a full and unlimited power over all the
faithful, because God would have the priesthood honored, and approves of
a right discipline in his Church. As then Satan has in all ages abused
the high eulogies by which God commends his Church, this exhortations,
now briefly given by the Prophet, ought always to be added; for it is
not God’s will to extol men, that he himself might be as a private
individual and give up his own place and degree, but that the whole
excellency bestowed on the Church is intended for this purpose — that
God may be purely worshipped, and that all, not only the people, but
also the priest, may submit to his authority. Whatever glory then
belongs to the Church, God would have it all to be subservient to his
purpose, so that he alone may be the supreme and that rightly. We now
then perceive the Prophet’s design.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p10"></span>And to give some weight to what is
taught, he says, that the *angel bore witness*; for the word used is
forensic or legal: one is said to bear witness to another, when he uses,
so to speak, a solemn protestations. In short, bearing witness differs
from a common declaration, as an oath, or an appeal to lawful authority,
is interposed, so that the words are sacred. It was then the design of
the holy spirit by this expression to render us more attentive, so that
we may know that not a common thing is said, but that God interposes an
oath, or some such thing, in order to secure more reverence to his order
or command.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p11"></span><span id="iii.iv.vi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p12"></span>*Protest* then *did the angel of Jehovah
to Joshua, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, If thou wilt walk in my ways, and
if my charge thou wilt observe*, etc. The angel now briefly teaches us,
that the priests do not excel, that they may exult at pleasure; but he
interposes a condition, that they are to exercise faithfully their
office, and to obey the call of God. We then see that those two things
are united — the dignity of the priesthood, and the faithfulness which
God’s ministers, who have been called to that office, are to exhibit.
Hence they who seek to domineer without control, do thereby sufficiently
show that they are not the lawful priests of God; for Joshua typified
Christ, and yet we see how God bound him by a certain condition, lest
relying on his honor and title he should take to himself more than what
was lawful or right.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p13"></span>If Joshua, who was a type of Christ,
together with his successors, was not to regard himself dignified, but
in order to obey God, we hence see how foolish and even abominable is
the arrogance of the Pope, who, being content with a naked title, seeks
to reduce the whole world to himself, as if God had given up his own
right.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p14"></span>But let us at the same time see what he
means by ways and *by charge*. These two words ought, no doubt, to be
confined to the office of the priest. God commands us all in common to
follow where he leads us; and whatever he prescribes as to the way of
leading a godly and righteous life may be called a charge; for the Lord
suffers us not to wander and go astray, but anticipates errors and shows
what we are to follow. There is then a general charge with regard to all
the faithful; but the priestly charge, as I have already stated, is to
be confined to that office. We yet know that men are not raised on high
by God, that he may resign his own authority. He indeed commits to men
their own offices, and they are rightly called the vicars of God, who
purely and faithfully teach from his mouth: but the authority of God is
not diminished when he makes use of the labors of men and employs them
as his ministers. We hence see that the priestly charge is this — to
rule the Church according to the pure Word of God.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p15"></span>He therefore adds, *Thou also shalt
govern my house*. This condition then is ever to be observed, when the
governors of the Church demand a hearing, even that they *keep the
charge* of God. It is indeed true, that all the ministers of the Word
are adorned with honorable titles; but, as I have said, their dignity is
degraded if it obscures the glory of God. As then God would have men to
be heard, so that nothing may be taken from him, this condition ought
ever to be observed, “Thou shalt govern my house, if thou wilt walk in
my ways.”

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p16"></span>It may however be asked, can priests be
rightly deprived instantly of their office when they depart from their
duty? To this I answer, that the Church ought, as far as possible, to be
reformed; but yet legitimate means ought to be used, so that the Church
may reject all the ungodly, who respond not to their duty, nor exhibit
due sincerity, nor discharge their office in obedience to God. All then
who depart or turn aside from the right course ought rightly to be
rejected, but by legitimate authority. But when the majority desire to
have pastors, such as cannot but be deemed really wolves, they must be
borne with, though unworthy of the honor, and yet so borne with that
they be not allowed to oppress the Church with their tyranny, or to take
to themselves what belongs to God alone, or to adulterate the worship of
God or pure doctrine.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p17"></span>However this may be, none are lawful
priests before God, except those who faithfully exercise their office
and respond to the calling of God, as we shall hereafter see in the
second chapter of Malachi <span id="iii.iv.vi-p17.1"></span>[Mal
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.iv.vi-p17.1"></span>.
But I am not disposed to enlarge; it is enough to adduce what an
explanation of the passage may require. In short, pastors divinely
appointed are so to rule over the Church as not to exercise their own
power, but to govern the Church according to what God has prescribed,
and in such a manner that God himself may always rule through the
instrumentality of men.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p18"></span>What he adds, *Thou shalt keep my
courts*, appears not to be an honor to the priest, for it was an humble
service to wait in the courts of the temple. But taking a part for the
whole, the Prophet includes the charge of the whole temple: and it was
no common honor to have the charge of that sacred habitation of God. It
is not then improperly added that Joshua would be the keeper of the
temple, if he walked in the ways of the Lord. Nevertheless we see at
this day how the masked rulers of the Church, under the Papacy, not only
disregard the keeping of the temple, but wholly repudiate it, as it
seems to be unworthy of their high dignity. I call the charge of the
temple, not that which is the duty of overseers, but whatever belongs to
the worship of God: but to feed the flock, to discharge the office of
pastors, and to administer the sacraments, is to these a sordid
employment. Hence the Pope, with all his adherents, can easily bear to
be relieved from the charge of the temple; but yet he seeks to rule in a
profane and tyrannical manner, and according to his own pleasure. But we
here see that the charge of the temple is especially intrusted to the
priest, as it was a special honor. We also see on what condition God
allowed the priests to continue in their dignity, even on that of
walking in his ways.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p19"></span>He afterwards adds, *I will give thee
passages* (intercourses) *among those who stand by*,  <span
id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md) that is, I will cause all the godly to
admit and freely to receive thee. The angels who stood there, no doubt,
represented the body of the Church; for they are mingled with the
faithful whenever they meet together in the name of Christ, as Paul
teaches us in <span id="iii.iv.vi-p24.1"></span>[1Co
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p24.1"></span>. Angels alone then stood by; but it is the
same as though God had said, “Thee will all the faithful acknowledge, so
that a free passage will be open to thee among them, provided thou
walkest in my ways.” And he puts *passages* in the plural number, for he
speaks of continued homage and regard.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p25"></span>The meaning is, that the priest is ever
worthy of regard and honor when he faithfully performs his office and
obeys the call of God. We may, on the other hand, conclude that all
masked pastors ought justly to be excluded, when they not only are
apostates and perfidious against God, but seek also to destroy the
Church; yea, when they are also voracious wolves and spiritual tyrants
and slaughterers. All those who are such, the angel clearly intimates,
are not only unworthy of being received, but ought also to be excluded
and exterminated from the Church. We now then perceive what I have
stated, that whatever excellency belongs to the pastors of the Church
ought not to be separated from the honor due to God; for God does not
resign his authority to mortals, nor diminish anything from his own
right; but he only constitutes men as his ministers, that he may by them
govern his Church alone, and be alone supreme. It hence follows, that
they are unworthy of honor who perform not faithfully their office; and
when they rob God of what belongs to him, they ought to be deprived of
their very name; for it is nothing else but the mask of Satan, by which
he seeks to deceive the simple. He afterwards adds —

<span id="iii.iv.vii"></span>

statim dicam*.)

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p5"></span><span id="iii.iv.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p6"></span>The angel shows here, that what had been
hitherto shown to Zechariah was typical; for the reality had not as yet
come to light, but would appear in its time. We have said that God’s
design was to lead the godly to the expectation of Christ; for these
beginnings of favor were obscure. It behaved them, therefore, to hope
for far more than they saw; and this appears evident from the verse
before us, in which the angel says, *hear now*. He makes this preface to
gain attention, as though he said, that he was going to speak of
something remarkable. Then he adds, *thou and thy associates who stand
before thee; I will send my servant the Branch*

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p7"></span>Let us notice this, which is the main
part of the verse, *Behold, I send my servant, the Branch*. The God of
hosts no doubt refers to the priest, who is eminent beyond the common
comprehension of men. He is called a Branch, because he was to come
forth as a stem, according to what is said in Isaiah, the eleventh
chapter, <span id="iii.iv.vii-p7.1"></span>[Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.iv.vii-p7.1"></span>
and in other places. It is then the same as though he had said, “this
priesthood is as yet disregarded, nevertheless my servant, the priest,
shall come forth like a branch which arises from the earth, and it will
grow.” The word <span id="iii.iv.vii-p7.2"></span>צמח, *tsamech* means a
shoot. He then compares Christ to a shoot, for he seemed, as we say, to
rise up from nothing, because his beginning was contemptible. For what
excellency had Christ in the estimation of the world when he was born?
how did he commence his kingdom? and how was he initiated into his
priesthood? Doubtless, whatever honor and glory the Father had given him
was regarded we know with contempt. It is then no wonder that he is on
this account called a Branch.

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p8"></span>Now the reason for the similitude is
apparent enough: and though the angel speaks indefinitely, the person of
Christ is no doubt intended. How so? We may judge by the event itself.
What priest succeeded Joshua who equalled him in honor, or who in the
tenth degree approached him? We know that nearly all were profane and
ungodly men; we know that the priesthood became venal among them; we
know that it was contended for with the most cruel hatred; nay, we know
that a priest was slain in the temple itself; ambition was burning so
furiously that no success could be gained without shedding innocent
blood. After the death of Joshua nothing could have been more base and
more disgraceful than the Jewish priesthood. Where then is to be found
this *servant* of God, *the Branch?* This principle must also be ever
borne in mind, that the reformation of the temple was to be made by
Christ: we must, therefore, necessarily come to him, that we may find
the servant mentioned here.  <span id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) And
why he is called a servant has been stated elsewhere; for he humbled
himself that he might be not only the minister of his Father, but also
of men. As then Christ condescended to become the servant of men, it is
no wonder that he is called the servant of God.

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p12"></span>Let us now enquire why the angel bids
Joshua and his companions to hear. He indirectly reproves, I doubt not,
the common unbelief, for there were very few then who had any notion of
a future and spiritual priesthood. Indeed, the people had the promises
in their mouths, but nearly all had their thoughts fixed on the earth
and the world. This is the reason why the angel directed his words
especially to Joshua and his companions: he saw that the ears of others
were almost closed; he saw so much indifference in the people, that
hardly any one was capable of receiving his doctrine: and thus he
intended to obviate a trial which might have weakened the courage of
Joshua. For we know how ready we are to faint when the whole world would
drive us to apostasy; for when any of us is weak, we wish to be
supported by others; and when there is no faith, no religion, no piety
among men, every one is ready to quail. In short, we can hardly believe
God, and continue firm in his word, except we have many companions, and
a large number in our favor; and when unbelief prevails everywhere our
faith vacillates. Hence the angel now addresses Joshua and his
companions apart; as though he had said, that there was no reason for
them to depend on the multitude, but, on the contrary, to look to God,
and by relying on his word to wait patiently for what he promised,
though all the rest were to reject his favor: *Thou* then *and thy
friends who stand before thee*

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p13"></span>He adds, *for they are men of wonder*;
or though they are men of wonder; but the meaning is the same. For God
means, that though the whole people rejected what he now declares as to
the renewal of the priesthood, it would yet be found true and confirmed
in its own time. Some render the words, “men of prodigy,” because they
were objects of wonder and they think that the companions of Joshua were
signalised by this title or encomium, because their faith was victorious
and surmounted all hindrances.  <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) But
the meaning of the prophet seems to me to be wholly different: and, I
doubt not, but that this passage is the same with another in Isaiah, the
eighth chapter, <span id="iii.iv.vii-p15.1"></span>[Isa
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.iv.vii-p15.1"></span>
where he says, that the faithful were men of prodigy, or, that they were
for a sign or prodigy, because they were objects of hatred, “what do
these seek for themselves?” As then all were astonished as at a
spectacle new and unwonted, when any one of the faithful met them, the
Prophet says, that the true servants of God were then for a sign and
prodigy. So here they are men of prodigy, for we see clearly, that the
companions of Joshua were separated from the rest, or the common
multitude. Why? not because they were objects of wonder, for that would
be frigid, but because they were objects of reproach to all; and they
were hardly borne with by the people, who clamored, “what do these seek
for themselves? they seek to be wiser than the Church.”

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p16"></span>In the same way we find ourselves at
this day to be condemned by the Papists. “Oh! these, forsooth, will
create a new world, they will create a new law: the rule of our great
men will not satisfy these; we have a Church founded for so many ages,
antiquity is in our favor. In short these men tear asunder what has been
sanctioned from the beginning until now.” But in the time of Joshua and
in the time of Isaiah, all who simply believed God were regarded as
strange men; for the people had become then so unrestrainedly
licentious, that to retain the pure worship of God was viewed as a
strange thing on account of its novelty.

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p17"></span>We now apprehend the meaning of the
words, when the angel bids Joshua and his companions to attend, and when
he calls them the men of prodigy, and when at last he promises that a
priest should arise like a Branch, for God would make Christ to rise up,
though hid, not only under the feet, but under the earth itself, like a
shoot which comes forth from the root after the tree has been cut down.
It follows —

<span id="iii.iv.viii"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#009.md)<span id="iii.iv.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p2"></span>**9.** For behold the stone that I have
laid before Joshua; upon one stone *shall be* seven eyes: behold, I will
engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove
the iniquity of that land in one day.

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p3"></span>**9.** Quia ecce lapis quem posui coram
Iehosua**,** super lapidem unum septem oculi: ecce ego sculpo sculpturam
ejus (*lapidis*) dicit Iehova exercituum: et aufero iniquitatem terrae
hujus die una.

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p5"></span><span id="iii.iv.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p6"></span>He more fully sets forth what we have
observed in the last verse; but he speaks figuratively. He says that
there were seven eyes on the stone which was set before Joshua; and that
God would in one day take away the iniquity of the land, so that nothing
would prevent it from recovering its ancient glory. This is the import
of the whole; but interpreters vary, especially as to the eyes.

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p7"></span>Almost all Christians agree as to the
stone; for they think Christ to be meant; and we know that there are
many similar passages, where Christ is called a stone, because the
Church is on him founded; “Behold, I lay in Zion a precious stone,” says
Isaiah in the <span id="iii.iv.viii-p7.1"></span>[Isa
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.viii-p7.1"></span>; and in <span
id="iii.iv.viii-p7.2"></span>[Ps
118:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.viii-p7.2"></span> and in other places there are similar
words. I yet think that the Prophet alludes to the temple, which was
then begun to be built; but at the same time I take this as admitted,
that Christ is called metaphorically a stone, as before he was called a
Branch. But we must bear in mind that the external figure of the visible
temple is applied to Christ himself. *Behold*, says God, *the stone
which I have set* before Joshua has *seven eyes*; and further, *I will
engrave it with sculptures*, that it may appear wonderful before the
whole world. We now perceive what the subject is, and the mode of
speaking here adopted.

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p8"></span>As to the subject, the angel says, that
the temple which Joshua had begun to build, was a celestial building;
for God here declares himself to be its founder and builder, — *The
stone*, he says, which *I have set*; and he says this, that Joshua might
know that he labored not in vain in building the temple. For had it been
the work of men, it might have fallen, and might have been pulled down a
hundred times by the hand of enemies; but God declares that the temple
was founded by his own hand. He, at the same time, as I have said,
raises up the thoughts of the godly to Christ, which is the substance
and reality of the temple. Hence he says, I set a stone before Joshua;
that is, “Though Joshua builds, and workmen diligently labor with him,
yet I am the chief framer and architect of the temple.”

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p9"></span>He then says, *on this stone* shall be
*seven eyes*. Some apply this to the seven graces of the Spirit: but the
definition which they make, who have said, that the grace of the Spirit
is sevenfold, is puerile; they know not about what they prattle and
vainly talk; for Scripture speaks of many more. They also falsely adduce
a passage from the <span id="iii.iv.viii-p9.1"></span>[Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.viii-p9.1"></span> for they mistake there as to the number:
the Latin version has led them astray. Others think that the seven eyes
have a reference to the whole world; as though the angel had said, that
all will direct their eyes to this stone, according to what is said by
Christ, that he was raised up on high, that he might draw all men to
himself: then seven eyes, that is the eyes of all men, shall be turned
to this stone.  <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) Some again apply
this to the fullness of grace which has been given to Christ. But I
think that the simpler view is, that his glory is set forth, according
to what immediately follows, — *I will engrave its engravings*. For it
is a vain refinement to say, that God engraved engravings when the side
of Christ was pierced, when his hands and his feet were perforated: this
is to trifle, and not seriously to explain Scripture. But the Prophet by
engraving, means the valuable and extraordinary character of this stone;
as though he had said, “It will be a stone remarkable for every
excellency; for God will adorn this stone with wonderful engravings; and
then it will be a stone having eyes, that is, it will not only turn to
itself the eyes of others, but it will illuminate them, and exhibit as
it were such brightness as will, by its own reflection, lead men to
behold it.”  <span id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) We now understand the
full meaning of the Prophet. What remains I cannot finish now.

<span id="iii.iv.ix"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="iii.iv.ix-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as by nature we
do not willingly submit to the reproach and contempt of the world, — O
grant, that with our hearts lifted up to heaven, we may become
indifferent to all reproaches, and that our faith may not succumb nor
vacillate, though profane men may ridicule us while serving thee under
the cross: but may we patiently wait, until Christ shall at length
appear in the splendor of his priesthood and kingdom; and may we, in the
meantime, contemplate the excellency with which thou hast adorned thy
Church, and be thus encouraged to connect ourselves with those few and
despised men, who faithfully and sincerely follow thy word, and
disregard the arrogance of the whole world, and never doubt, but that if
we remain grounded in the pure doctrine of the gospel, thou wilt raise
us up to heaven, yea, and above all heavens, where we shall enjoy that
blessedness which thine only-begotten Son has obtained for us by his own
blood. — Amen.

<span id="iii.iv.x"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.x-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Forty-first

<span id="iii.iv.x-p2"></span>We have to consider the last words of the
ninth verse, in which God promises to *remove the iniquity of the land
in one day*. Some refinedly take the one day for the one sacrifice, by
which Christ once for all expiated for ever for the sins of the world;
but the Prophet in my view speaks in a simpler manner; for he mentions
one day for suddenly or quickly. I indeed allow that expiation was to be
sought through the one sacrifice of Christ; but the Prophet intimates,
that God would be so propitious to the Jews, as to deliver them from all
the wrongs and molestations of their enemies. He then assigns a reason
why he purposed to deal so bountifully with his people, even because he
would not impute their sins. And we know this to be the fountain of all
the blessings which flow from God to us, that is, when he forgives us
and blots out our sins.

<span id="iii.iv.x-p3"></span>We now then apprehend the Prophet’s
meaning: I will take away the iniquity of the land in one day, that is,
“Though hitherto I have in various ways punished this people, I shall of
a sudden be pacified towards them, so that no iniquity shall come to an
account before me, or prevent me from favoring this people.” It now
follows in the Prophet -

<span id="iii.iv.xi"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p1"></span><span
id="iii.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac003.htm#010.md)<span id="iii.iv.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p2"></span>**10.** In that day, saith the LORD of
hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under
the fig tree.

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p3"></span>**10.** In illo die**,** dicit Iehova
exercituum**,** vocabitis quisque proximum suum sub vite et sub ficu.

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p5"></span><span id="iii.iv.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p6"></span>We see from this verse that a particular
time is signified by one day; for the Prophet wished to inspire the Jews
with confidence, lest they should think that their misery would
continue, because God had hitherto treated them with rigor and severity.
Here then is shown to them a sudden change. He therefore adds, *In that
day, ye shall call every one his neighbor under his vine and under his
fig-tree*; that is, “Ye shall dwell secure, beyond the reach of fear or
of danger; for no one will be incensed against you.” This kind of
expression signifies a safe and quiet state, that is, when it is said;
that neighbors meet together under the vine and under the fig-tree. For
they who fear, either remain inclosed in cities, or seek, when in the
country, some fortified place and difficult of access, or watch their
own doors that they may not be exposed to injuries; but they who
joyfully meet together under the vine or under the fig-tree, show that
they are free from every anxiety and fear.

<span id="iii.iv.xi-p7"></span>The sum of the whole then is, — that when
God shall openly make himself the guardian of his Church, the faithful
shall be relieved from every fear, and shall cheerfully enjoy their
freedom, so that they shall venture to have their repast under the vine
and under the fig-tree, that is, in the open air and on the public road,
as there will be none to terrify them. But as this promise is to be
extended to the whole kingdom of Christ, what is said ought to be
applied to that spiritual peace which we enjoy, when we are fully
persuaded that God is reconciled to us; for then also us become
reconciled among ourselves, so that we no longer seek to injure one
another, according to what we have observed in Micah, (<span
id="iii.iv.xi-p7.1"></span>[Mic
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#004)<span id="iii.iv.xi-p7.1"></span>,.md)
and according to what Isaiah says in the second chapter <span
id="iii.iv.xi-p7.2"></span>[Isa
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.iv.xi-p7.2"></span>.

<span id="iii.iv.i-p10"></span> To retain the alliteration of the
Hebrew, the words may be thus rendered — “and the opponent standing on
his right hand to oppose him,” or, “the accuser standing on his right
hand to accuse him.” The word Satan is rendered here and in Job by the
*Septuagint*, “the accuser,” or “the devil,” <span
id="iii.iv.i-p10.1"></span>ὁ διαβολος. The station on the right hand was
that of the plaintiff, or the accuser, or of the pleader, as *Grotius*

accuser. See <span id="iii.iv.i-p10.4"></span>[Ps

the beginning of the second verse unnecessarily, merely on the authority
of the Syriac; for in the preceding visions, “Jehovah” and “the angel of
Jehovah” are used indiscriminately. It is impossible not to see that
here and in the first chapter a person is mentioned as being Jehovah,
and the angel or messenger of Jehovah. See on this subject *M’Caul’s*

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p10"></span> The word, \[<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p10.1"></span>צואים\], does not mean what is shabby, mean,
or tattered, but what is filthy,dirty, as opposed to what is clean. Our
version, “filthy,” adopted by *Newcome* and *Henderson*, is the most
suitable. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_37"></span>[38](cc30006.htm#fr_37.md) <span

<span id="iii.iv.ii-p14"></span> \[<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p14.1"></span>מחלצות\], from \[<span
id="iii.iv.ii-p14.2"></span>חלף\], to set loose, or to put off. Both
*Parkhurst* and *Blayney* think that they were the garments which the
high priest wore on particular and solemn occasions, and which he *put
off* when he had performed his office. “Holy garments” would perhaps be
the best rendering. *Newcome* has “goodly apparel;” and *Henderson*,
“costly habiliments;” garments of the high priest. And that they were
the holy garments, such as the high priest wore on especial occasions,
appears probable from what follows respectng the mitre, which formed a
part of the high priest’s dress. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_38"></span>[39](cc30006.htm#fr_38.md) <span
id="iii.iv.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.v-p7"></span> *Calvin* has followed the punctuists as
to the verb “said,” in the beginning of the verse, and regarded it as in
the first and not in the third person. It is omitted in the Septuagint,
(except in the comp. ed., where it is in the third person,) but the
sentence is continued as the words of the angel. *Jerome* has <span
id="iii.iv.v-p7.1"></span>*et dixit*, and he said, that is, the angel.
It appears that the *Targum*, the *Syriac*, and the *Vulgate* retain the
third person; and *Dathius*, *Newcome*, and *Henderson* so render the
verb, “And he said,” that is, the angel; and this seems more consistent
with the general tenor of the passage; for it is more reasonable to
suppose that the words which follow are those of the angel than the
words of the Prophet, and that the command to put on the mitre issued
from the same as the command to clothe the high priest with holy
garments. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_39"></span>[40](cc30006.htm#fr_39.md) <span
id="iii.iv.vi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p20"></span> This is a difficult sentence. *Kimchi*,
*Marckius*, *Dathius*, *Newcome*, *Scott*, and others, take the meaning
given in our version, and regard \[<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p20.1"></span>מהלכים\] as a noun, signifying places to
walk in, walkings. It is nowhere else found except in the singular
number, \[<span id="iii.iv.vi-p20.2"></span>מהלך\], a walk, or a
journey: <span id="iii.iv.vi-p20.3"></span>[Jon
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/jon003.htm#004.md)<span id="iii.iv.vi-p20.3"></span>;
<span id="iii.iv.vi-p20.4"></span>[Eze
42:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze042.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p20.4"></span>: but as a participle, signifying walking,
we meet with it in <span id="iii.iv.vi-p20.5"></span>[Ec
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p20.5"></span>, and in the singular number in <span
id="iii.iv.vi-p20.6"></span>[Ps.
104:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003.md), [Prov.
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/pro006.htm#011.md)<span id="iii.iv.vi-p20.6"></span>
*Vatables*, *Pagninus*, and *Castalio* render it “<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p20.7"></span>incessus, vias, aditus,” words of similar
import with “<span id="iii.iv.vi-p20.8"></span>transitus“ of *Calvin*
and of *Mede*. The meaning is thus given by *Drusius*, “I will give thee
the privilege of walking among these;” that is, the angels who stood
there. *Jerome’s* version is, “<span id="iii.iv.vi-p20.9"></span>Et dabo
tibi ambulantes de his qui nunc hic assistant — And I will give thee
walkers of those who now stand here.” The same is given by *Grotius*,
who explains “walkers” in the sense of protectors, and refers to <span
id="iii.iv.vi-p20.10"></span>[Ps
91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p20.10"></span>, and <span
id="iii.iv.vi-p20.11"></span>[Mt
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p20.11"></span>. To the same purpose, as to the meaning,
is the version of *Henderson*; only he renders \[<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p20.12"></span>מהלכים\], guides, conceiving it to be a
hiphil of participle, “causing to walk,” a designation of leaders,
guides, or contractors. According to this view, the promise made is,
that angels would be the guardians and protectors of Joshua and his
associates, and not according to the former view, that Joshua would have
a place among angels in heaven, in which sense the *Targum*, as well as
the Jewish Rabbins, understand the passage.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p21"></span>*Blayney* renders “walkers,” ministers,
being persons ready to go and come when bidden: and by those who stood
by, he understands the inferior priests, who are here promised to Joshua
as his assistants, and are mentioned in the next verse as his
“companions.” There is nothing in the verb \[<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p21.1"></span>עמד\], or \[<span
id="iii.iv.vi-p21.2"></span>ישב\], to prevent this meaning, as they do
not *necessarily* denote a position but a presence.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p22"></span>May not “walkers,” or those who walk or
perambulated, be the same as those mentioned in the first vision, <span
id="iii.iv.vi-p22.1"></span>[Zech.
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#011.md)<span id="iii.iv.vi-p22.1"></span>?
If so, we may render the sentence thus —

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p23"></span>And I will appoint for thee those who
walk to and fro  
From among those who stand here.

<span id="iii.iv.vi-p24"></span>Angels have different offices; and the
most probable meaning of the passage is, that it contains the promise of
angels as guardians. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_40"></span>[41](cc30006.htm#fr_40.md) <span
id="iii.iv.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p9"></span> *Grotius* and *Newcome*, (not
*Blayney*, as misstated by *Henderson*,) following *Theodoret* and
*Kimchi*, strangely consider that Zerubbabel is meant by the “Branch.”
The *Targum*, *Cyril*, *Drusius*, and almost all modern divines, regard
the Messiah as intended. See <span id="iii.iv.vii-p9.1"></span>[Isa.
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#002.md), [Isa.
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vii-p9.1"></span>; <span id="iii.iv.vii-p9.2"></span>[Jer.
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md), [Jer.
33:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/jer033.htm#016.md)<span id="iii.iv.vii-p9.2"></span>.

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p10"></span>“The same person must needs by intended
here as in <span id="iii.iv.vii-p10.1"></span>[Jer
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vii-p10.1"></span>. Besides, it is evident that the *Branch*
is promised as one that was to come, and not as one that had already
enjoyed his estate, such as it was, for many years past.” — *Blayney*.

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p11"></span>Christ is thus called, says
*Menochius*, “because he came forth as a new shoot from the almost dead
root of the Patriarchs.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_41"></span>[42](cc30006.htm#fr_41.md) <span
id="iii.iv.vii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p14"></span> The word \[<span
id="iii.iv.vii-p14.1"></span>מופת\] has two meanings — *a miracle*, such
as those performed in Egypt, <span id="iii.iv.vii-p14.2"></span>[Ex
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#009.md)<span id="iii.iv.vii-p14.2"></span>
— and a *sign*, such as <span id="iii.iv.vii-p14.3"></span>[Isa
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vii-p14.3"></span>, and <span
id="iii.iv.vii-p14.4"></span>[Eze
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.iv.vii-p14.4"></span>; who performed a particular action which
was to be a sign or token of something else. If we render the words
here, “the men of miracle,” the reference seems to be to their
miraculous or extraordinary deliverance from captivity; but if we adopt
the version of *Menochius*, *Marckius*, *Blayney*, and *Henderson*, “men
of sign,” or symbolical men, the meaning is, that in their office they
represented Christ, that what they did was a sign which foreshowed and
prefigured what Christ, the Branch, was to do; and this is the
explanation which *Parkhurst* offers.

<span id="iii.iv.vii-p15"></span>The reading of *Adam Clarke* is not
amiss, “*figurative* *men*, men whose office and ministry *prefigured*
the Lord Jesus Christ.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_42"></span>[43](cc30006.htm#fr_42.md) <span
id="iii.iv.viii-p9.2"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p10"></span> “Seven eyes looking to it,” is the
explanation of *Kimchi*. “Seven being taken for an indefinite number.”
“The eyes of Patriarchs, Prophets, and of all Christians,” says
*Menochius*. The words may indeed admit of this construction, that is,
that “seven” or many “eyes” are fixed on the same; but the probability
is that eyes are ascribed to the stone, which betoken vigilance and
care. See <span id="iii.iv.viii-p10.1"></span>[Ps
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.iv.viii-p10.1"></span>. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_43"></span>[44](cc30006.htm#fr_43.md) <span
id="iii.iv.viii-p10.2"></span>

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p11"></span> With this view correspond the remarks
of *Marckius*, and also of *Drusius*, *Piscator*, and *Pemble*. The
address of the Angel of Jehovah from verse 7 to the end, seems to
consist of two parts; the first is spoken to Joshua and his associates,
to the middle of verse 8, — and the second, to the Prophet, beginning
with the words, “Verily men of sign are these,” or “they,” as though he
pointed to Joshua and his companions. Then the “Branch” and the “stone,”
are proofs of the men being symbolical persons. To separate the two, as
*Henderson* does, does not appear right. I give the following version of
the whole passage: —

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p12"></span>*7. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts,* —*  
If in my ways thou wilt walk,  
And if my charge thou wilt keep,  
Then shalt thou also rule my house,  
And keep also my courts,  
And I will give to thee perambulators  
From among those who stand here:*

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p13"></span>*8. Hear* this *now, Joshua, the high
priest,  
Thou and thy associates.  
Verily men of sign* are *these;  
For behold, I will bring my servant, the Branch;*

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p14"></span>9. For behold the stone, which I have
set before Joshua,  
On one stone seven eyes;  
Behold, I engrave its engraving,  
And will remove the iniquity of that land in one day:  
In that day saith Jehovah of hosts,

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p15"></span>10. Ye shall invite every one his
neighbor,  
Under the vine and under the fig-tree.

<span id="iii.iv.viii-p16"></span>The “Branch” and the “Stone,” as
designative of the Messiah, were symbols well known to the Jews, as they
had been used by former Prophets. *Vitringa*, *Blayney*, and others have
rendered “eyes” fountains, and the following line thus, “Behold I open
its opening,” that is, the orifice through which the fountains were to
flow; they conceived the allusion to be to the rock smitten by Moses in
the wilderness. The main objection to this, as observed by *Marckius*
and *Henderson*, is, that the word rendered “eyes” is masculine, and
means “fountains” only when in the feminine gender. — *Ed.*
