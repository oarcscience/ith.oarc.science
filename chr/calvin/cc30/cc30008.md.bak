5:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p2"></span>**1.** Then I turned, and lifted up mine
eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p3"></span>**1.** Et reversus sum et extuli oculos
meos**,** et aspexi**,** et ecce volumen volans.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p4"></span>**2.** And he said unto me, What seest
thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof *is*
twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p5"></span>**2.** Et dixit mihi**,** Quid tu vides?
Et dixit**,** ego video volumen volans; longitudo ejus viginti in cubito
(*hoc est***,** ad viginti cubitos**,**) et latitudo ejus decem in
cubito (*hoc est***,** ad decem cubitos.)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p6"></span>**3.** Then said he unto me, This *is*
the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every
one that stealeth shall be cut off *as* on this side according to it;
and every one that sweareth shall be cut off *as* on that side according
to it.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p7"></span>**3.** Et dixit mihi**,** Haec est
maledictio**,** quiae egreditur super faciem universae terrae; quia
quisquis furatur**,** ex hac sicut illa punietur; et quisquis
pejerat**,** ex hac sicut illa punietur.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p8"></span>**4.** I will bring it forth, saith the
LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into
the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain
in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof
and the stones thereof.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p9"></span>**4.** Emittam (*vel***,** producam)
eam**,** dicit Iehova exercituum; et veniet ad domum furantis**,** et ad
domum jurantis in nomine meo fallaciter; et residebit in medio domus
ejus**,** et consumet eam et ligna et lapides ejus.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p10"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p11"></span><span id="iii.vi.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p12"></span>The angel shows in this chapter, that
whatever evils the Jews had suffered, proceeded from the righteous
judgment Of God; and then he adds a consolation — that the Lord would at
length alleviate or put an end to their evils, when he had removed afar
off their iniquity. Interpreters have touched neither heaven nor earth
in their explanation of this prophecy, for they have not regarded the
design of the Holy Spirit. Some think that by the volume are to be
understood false and perverted glosses, by which the purity of doctrine
had been vitiated; but this view can by no means be received. There is
no doubt but that God intended to show to Zechariah, that the Jews were
justly punished, because the whole land was full of thefts and
perjuries. As then religion had been despised, as well as equity and
justice, he shows that it was no wonder that a curse had prevailed
through the whole land, the Jews leaving by their impiety and other sins
extremely provoked the wrath of God. This is the import of the first
part. And, then, as this vision was terrible, there is added some
alleviation by representing iniquity in a measure, and the mouth of the
measure closed, and afterwards carried to the land of Shinar, that is,
into Chaldea, that it might not remain in Judea. Thus in the former part
the Prophet’s design was to humble the Jews, and to encourage them to
repent, so that they might own God to have been justly angry; and then
he gives them reason to entertain hope, and fully to expect an end to
their evils, for the Lord would remove to a distance and transfer their
iniquity to Chaldea, so that Judea might be pure and free from every
wickedness, both from thefts and acts of injustice, by which it had been
previously polluted. But every sentence must be in order explained, that
the meaning of the Prophet may be more clearly seen.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p13"></span>He says, that he had *returned*;  <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) and by this word this vision is separated
front the preceding visions, and those also of which we have hitherto
spoken, were not at the same time exhibited to the Prophet, but he saw
them at different times. We may hence learn that some time intervened
before the Lord presented to him the vision narrated in this chapter. He
adds, *that he raised up his eyes and looked*; and this is said that we
may know that what he narrates was shown to him by the prophetic Spirit.
Zechariah very often raised up his eyes though God did not immediately
appear to him; but it behaved God’s servants, whenever they girded
themselves for the purpose of teaching, to withdraw themselves as it
were from the society of men, and to rise up above the world. The
raising up of the eyes then, mentioned by Zechariah, signified something
special, as though he had said, that he was prepared, for the Lord had
inwardly roused him. The Prophets also, no doubt, were in this manner by
degrees prepared, when the Lord made himself known to them. There was
then the raising up of the eyes as a preparation to receive the
celestial oracle.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p15"></span><span id="iii.vi.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p16"></span>He afterwards adds, that he was *asked
by the angel what he saw*. He might indeed have said, that a roll flying
in the air appeared to him, but he did not as yet understand what it
meant; hence the angel performed the office of an interpreter. But he
says, that the roll was *twenty cubits long, and ten broad*. The Rabbis
think that the figure of the court of the temple is here represented,
for the length of the court was twenty cubits and its breadth was ten;
and hence they suppose, that the roll had come forth from the temple,
that there might be fuller reason to believe that God had sent forth the
roll. And this allusion, though not sufficiently grounded, is yet more
probable than the allegory of the puerile Jerome, who thinks that this
ought to be applied to Christ, because he began to preach the gospel in
his thirtieth year. Thus he meant to apply this number to the age of
Christ, when he commenced his office as a teacher. But this is extreme
trifling. I do not feel anxious to know why the length or the breadth is
mentioned; for it seems not to be much connected with the main subject.
But if it be proper to follow a probable conjecture, what I have already
referred to is more admissible — that the length and breadth of the roll
are stated, that the Jews might fully understand that nothing was set
before them but what God himself sanctioned, as they clearly perceived a
figure of the court of the temple.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p17"></span><span id="iii.vi.ii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p18"></span>The angel then says, that it was *the
curse* which *went forth*  <span id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) *over
the face of the whole land*. We must remember what I have just said,
that God’s judgment is here set forth before the Jews, that they might
know how justly both their fathers and themselves have been with so much
severity chastised by God, inasmuch as they had procured for themselves
such punishments by their sins. From the saying of the angel, that the
roll went *through the whole land*, we learn, that not only a few were
guilty, or that some corner of the land only had been polluted, but that
the wrath of God raged everywhere, as no part of the land was pure or
free from wickedness. As then Judea was full of pollutions, it was no
wonder that the Lord poured forth his wrath and overwhelmed, as it were
with a deluge, the whole land.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p21"></span>It afterwards follows, *for every
thief*, or *every one that steals, shall on this as on that side, be
punished*, or *receive his own reward*; *and every one who swears, shall
on this as on that side be punished*. As to the words, interpreters
differ with regard to the particles, <span
id="iii.vi.ii-p21.1"></span>מזה כמוה, *mese camue*; some take the
meaning to be, “by this roll, as it is written;” others, “on this side
of the roll, as on the other;” for they think that the roll was written
on both sides, and that God denounced punishment on thieves as well as
on perjurers. But I rather apply the words to the land, and doubt not
but that this is the real meaning of the Prophet. As then there is no
respect of persons with God, the Prophet, after having spoken of the
whole land, says, that no one who had sinned could anywhere escape
unpunished, for God would from one part to the other summon all to
judgment without any exception.  <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p23"></span>Now the Prophet says, that all
perjurers, as well as thieves, shall be punished; and there is nothing
strange in this, for God, who has forbidden to steal, has also forbidden
to forswear. He is therefore the punisher of all transgressions. Those
who think that this roll was disapproved, as though it contained false
and degenerate doctrine, bring this reason to prove its injustice, that
the thief is as grievously punished as the perjurer: but this is
extremely frivolous. For, as I have said already, God shows here that he
will be the defender of his law in whatever respect men may have
transgressed it. We must therefore remember that saying of James,

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p24"></span>“he who forbids to commit adultery,
forbids also to steal: whosoever then offends in one thing is a
transgressor of the whole law:” (<span id="iii.vi.ii-p24.1"></span>[Jas
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.vi.ii-p24.1"></span>)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p25"></span>for we ought not simply to regard what
God either commands or forbids, but we ought ever to fix our eyes on his
majesty, as there is nothing so minute in the law which all ought not
reverently to receive; for the laws themselves are not only to be
regarded, but especially the lawgiver. As then the majesty of God is
dishonored, when any one steals, and when any one transgresses in the
least point, he clearly shows that the word of God is not much regarded
by him. It is hence right that thieves and perjurers should be alike
punished: yet the Scripture while it thus speaks, does not teach that
sins are equal in enormity, as the Stoics in former times foolishly and
falsely taught. But the equality of punishment is not what is here
referred to; the angel means only, that neither thieves nor perjurers
shall go unpunished, as they have transgressed the law of God.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p26"></span>We must also observe, that the mode of
speaking adopted here is that of stating a part for the whole; for under
the word theft is comprehended whatever is opposed to the duties of
love; so that it is to be referred to the second table at the law. And
the Prophet calls all those perjurers who profane the worship of God;
and so perjury includes whatever is contrary to the first table of the
law, and tends to pollute the service due to God. The meaning is, — that
God, as I have said, will be the punisher of all kinds of wickedness,
for he has not in vain given his law. Much deceived then are those who
flatter themselves, as though by evasions they can elude the judgment of
God, for both thieves and perjurers shall be brought before God’s
tribunal, so that no one can escape, that is, no wickedness shall remain
unpunished; for not in vain has he once declared by his own mouth, that
cursed are all who fulfill not whatever has been written. (<span
id="iii.vi.ii-p26.1"></span>[De
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.vi.ii-p26.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p27"></span>And the same thing the Prophet more
clearly expresses in the following verse, where God himself declares
what he would do, that he would cause *the curse to go forth over the
whole land*; as though he had said, “I will really show, that I have not
given the law that it may be despised; for what the law teaches shall be
so efficacious, that every one who violates it shall find that he has to
do, not with a mortal man, nor with sounds of words, but with the
heavenly judge; *I will bring forth the curse over the whole land*.”

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p28"></span>I have said, that the Prophet was
instructed in the import of this vision, that all the Jews might know
that it was nothing strange that they had been so severely chastised,
inasmuch as they had polluted the whole land by their sins, so that no
part of the law was observed by them; for on the one hand they had
corrupted the worship of God and departed from true religion; and on the
other, they distressed one another by many wrongs, and oppressed them by
frauds. As then no equity prevailed among the people, nor any true
religion, God shows that he would punish them all, as none were
guiltless.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p29"></span><span id="iii.vi.ii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p30"></span>He afterwards adds, *It shall come into
the house of the thief, and into the house of him who swears in my name
falsely; and there will it reside, and it shall consume the hoarse, both
the wood and the stones*. Here the Prophet further stimulates the Jews
to repentance, by showing that the curse would so fly as to enter into
all their houses; as though he had said, “In vain shall they, who
deserve punishment, fortify or shut up themselves; for this curse, which
I send forth, shall come to each individual, and with him it shall
remain.” We know that hypocrites so flatter themselves, as though they
could escape for the moment while God is angry and displeased; but the
Prophet shows here that vain is such a hope, for the curse would
overtake all the ungodly, and wholly overthrow them; yea, it would
consume their houses, both the wood and the stones. In short, he
intimates, that punishment ends not until men are reconciled to God. And
by these words he reminds us how terrible it is to fall into the hands
of God, for he will punish the ungodly and the wicked until he reduces
them to nothing. We now then comprehend the design of the Prophet and
the meaning of the words. It now follows —

<span id="iii.vi.iii"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
5:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/zac005.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p2"></span>**5.** Then the angel that talked with
me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what
*is* this that goeth forth.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p3"></span>**5.** Et egressus est angelus**,** qui
loquebatur mecum**,** et dixit mihi**,** Tolle nunc oculos tuos**,** et
aspice quidnam sit illud quod egreditur.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p4"></span>**6.** And I said, What *is* it? And he
said, This *is* an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This *is*
their resemblance through all the earth.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p5"></span>**6.** Et dixi**,** Quid hoc? et
dixit**,** Hoc modius egrediens (*id est***,** hoc quod egreditur est

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p6"></span>**7.** And, behold, there was lifted up
a talent of lead: and this *is* a woman that sitteth in the midst of the
ephah.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p7"></span>**7.** Et ecce massa plana plumbi
ferebatur (*vertunt alii***,** talentum; *et* \[<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p7.1"></span>כבר\] *significat talentum*<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p7.2"></span>, *et significat planitiam etiam Hebrais*;
*ideo non dubito*<span id="iii.vi.iii-p7.3"></span>, *quin Propheta

mulier una habitans in medio modii.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p8"></span>**8.** And he said, This *is*
wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the
weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p9"></span>**8.** Et dixit**,** Haec est
impietas**,** et projecit eam in medium modii**,** et projecit lapidem
plumbi (*vel***,** pondus; *id est***,** massam illam extentam instar
operculi; projecit *ergo*) super os ejus (*id est*<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p9.1"></span>, super os modii.)

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p10"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p11"></span><span id="iii.vi.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p12"></span>Here I stop; I intended to add all the
verses, but I can hardly finish the whole today. It will be enough for
us to understand that this is the second part of the vision, in which
the Prophet, in order to relieve or in some measure to mitigate the
sorrow of the Jews, shows, that God would not treat them with extreme
rigor, so as to punish them as they deserved, but would chastise them
with paternal moderation. Hence he says, that a measure appeared to him
and a woman in the measure. The woman was wickedness;  <span
id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) there was also a covering of lead, a wide
or an extended piece. The plate of lead was borne upwards when the woman
was seen in the measure. He then says, that the measure was closed up,
and that there impiety was kept hid as a captive in prison. He
afterwards adds, that it was driven away into the land of Shinar, very
far from Judea, and that wickedness was thus turned over to the enemies
of the chosen people.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p14"></span>We see that God, as I have already
noticed, gives here a token of favor; for he says that wickedness was
shut up in a measure. Though then he had spoken hitherto severely, that
he might shake the Jews with dread, it was yet his purpose soon to add
some alleviation: for it was enough that they were proved guilty of
their sins, that they might humble themselves and suppliantly flee to
God’s mercy, and also that repentance might really touch them, lest they
should murmur, as we know they had done, but submit themselves to God
and confess that they had suffered justly. Since then the angel had
already shown that the curse had deservedly gone over the face of the
whole land, because no corner was free from wickedness, the angel now
adds, that he came to show a new vision, *Raise*, he says, *now thine
eyes, and see what this is which goes forth*. The Prophet was no doubt
cast down with fear, so that he hardly dared to look any longer. As then
the curse was flying and passing freely here and there, the Prophet was
struck with horror, and not without reason, since he beheld the wrath of
God spreading everywhere indiscriminately. This is the reason why the
angel now animates him and bids him to see what was going forth. And he
tells what was exhibited to him, for he saw a measure; which in Hebrew
is <span id="iii.vi.iii-p14.1"></span>איפה, *aiphe*:  <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) and some render it measure or bushel;
others, firkin or cask; but in this there is no difference. When the
Prophet saw this measure, he asked the angel what it was: for the vision
would have been useless, had he not been informed what the measure and
the woman sitting in it signified, and also the lead covering. He
therefore asked what they were.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p16"></span><span id="iii.vi.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p17"></span>Then the angel answered, *This is the
measure that goes forth, and this is their eye in all the earth*. By
saying that the measure is their eye, he no doubt means that the ungodly
could not thus be carried away at their own pleasure, but that God
restrained them whenever it seemed good to him; for they could not
escape his sight. For by their eyes he understands passively the power
of seeing in God, by which he notices all the sins of the ungodly, that
he may check them when he pleases, when they hurry on without restraint.
 <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md)

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p19"></span>But that the meaning of the Prophet may
be made more clear, let us first see what wickedness means, — whether it
is to be taken for those sins which provoked God’s wrath against the
Jews, — or whether for those wrongs which heathen enemies had done. The
last is the view I prefer, though if we take it for the wickedness which
had previously reigned in Judea, the meaning would not be unsuitable.
For as wickedness is hateful to God, his vengeance against the Jews
could not have ceased except by cleansing them from their sins, and by
renewing them by his Spirit. For they had carried on war with him in
such a way, that there was no means of pacifying him but by departing
from their sins. And whenever God reconciles himself to melt, he at the
same time renews them by his Spirit; he not only blots out their sins,
as to the guilt, but also regenerates those who were before devoted to
sin and the devil, so that he may treat them kindly and paternally.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p20"></span>With regard then to the subject in
hand, both views may be suitably adopted. We may consider the meaning to
be, — that God would take away iniquity from Judea by cleansing his
Church from all defilements, since the Jews could not partake of his
blessing except iniquity were driven afar off and banished. As God then
designed to be propitious to his people, he justly says, that he would
cause wickedness to disappear from the midst of them. Yet the other
view, as I have said, is more agreeable to the context, — that
wickedness would not be allowed freely to prevail as before; for we know
that loose reins had been given to the cruelty of their enemies,
inasmuch as the Jews had been exposed to the wrongs of all. As then they
had been so immoderately oppressed, God promises that all unjust
violence should be driven afar off and made to depart into the land of
Shinar, that is, that the Lord would in turn chastise the Babylonians
and reward them as they had deserved. The import of the whole is, that
God, who had chosen the seed of Abraham, would be propitious to the
Jews, so as to put an slid at length to their calamities.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p21"></span><span id="iii.vi.iii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p22"></span>Now the Prophet says that wickedness,
when first seen, was in mid air, and in a measure; but at the same time
he calls the measure the eye of the ungodly, for though wickedness
extends itself to all parts, yet God confines it within a hidden
measure; and this he designates by eyes, whereby he seems to allude to a
former prophecy, which we have explained. For he had said that there
were seven eyes in the stone of the high priest, because God would carry
on by his providence the building of the temple. So also he says, that
God’s eyes are upon all the ungodly, according to what is said in the
book of Psalms —

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p23"></span>“The eyes of the Lord are over the
wicked, to destroy their memory from the earth.”  
(<span id="iii.vi.iii-p23.2"></span>[Ps
34:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p23.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p24"></span>And this mode of speaking often occurs
in Scripture. The meaning then is, that though wickedness spreads and
extends through the whole earth, it is yet in a measure; but this
measure is not always closed up. However this may be, still God knows
how to regulate all things, so that impiety shall not exceed its limits.
And this is most true, whatever view may be taken; for when enemies
harass the church, though they may be carried along in the air, that is,
though God may not immediately restrain their wrongs, they yet sit in a
measure, and are ruled by the eyes of God, so that they cannot move a
finger, except so far as they are permitted. Let us in a word know, that
in a state of things wholly disordered, God watches, and his eyes are
vigilant, in order to put an end to injuries. The same also may be said
when God gives up to a reprobate mind those who deserve such a
punishment; for though he cast them away, and Satan takes possession of
them, yet this remains true — that they sit in a measure. They are not
indeed shut in; but we ought not, as I have said, to suppose that God is
indifferent in heaven, or that sins prevail in the world, as though he
did not see them; for his connivance is not blindness. The eyes of God
then mark and observe whatever sins are done in the world.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p25"></span><span id="iii.vi.iii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p26"></span>Now the angel adds, that *a thin piece
of lead was cast over the mouth of the measure, and that wickedness was
cast into the measure*. The expression, that wickedness was thrown into
the measure, may be explained in two ways — either that God would not
permit so much liberty to the devil to lead the Jews to sin as before;
for how comes it that men abandon themselves to every evil, except that
God forsakes them, and at the same time delivers them up to Satan, that
he may exercise his tyranny over them? or, that a bridle would be used
to restrain foreign enemies, that they might not in their wantonness
oppress the miserable people, and exercise extreme violence. God, then,
intending to deliver them from their sins, or to check wrongs, shuts up
wickedness, as it were, in a measure; and then he adds a cover; and it
is said to have been a thin piece, or a weight of lead, because it was
heavy; as though the Prophet had said, that whenever it pleased God
iniquity would be taken captive, so that it could not go forth from its
confinement or its prison. It afterwards follows —

<span id="iii.vi.iv"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah

id="iii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p2"></span>**9.** Then lifted I up mine eyes, and
looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind *was* in
their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they
lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p3"></span>**9.** Et extuli oculos meos et

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p4"></span>**10.** Then said I to the angel that
talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah?

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p5"></span>**10.** Et dixi angelo qui loquebatur

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p6"></span>**11.** And he said unto me, To build it

there upon her own base.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p8"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p9"></span><span id="iii.vi.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p10"></span>The Prophet says here that such would be
the change of things, that God would in turn afflict the Chaldeans, who
had so cruelly treated the chosen people. And this is the reason why I
think that iniquity is to be taken for the violent injustice and plunder
which heathen enemies had exercised towards the Jews. For when he says
that a *house* would be for *iniquity in the land of Shinar*, it is as
though he had said, “as Judea has been for a long time plundered by
enemies, and has been exposed to their outrages, so the Chaldeans in
their turn shall be punished, not once, nor for a short time, but
perpetually; for God will fix a habitation for wickedness in their
land.” We hence see the design of the vision, that is, that when God had
mercy on his Church its enemies would have to render an account, and
that they would not escape God’s hand, though he had employed them to
chastise his people.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p11"></span>He says then, that wickedness was taken
away, that a house might be made for it, that is, that it might have a
fixed and permanent dwelling in the land of Shinar, which means among
the Chaldeans, who had been inveterate enemies to the Jews; and as
Babylon was the metropolis of that empire, he includes under it all the
ungodly who opposed or persecuted the children of God. Why God
represents the measure as carried away by women rather than by men does
not appear to me, except it was that the Jews might know that there was
no need of any warlike preparations, but that their strongest enemies
could be laid prostrate by weak and feeble instruments; and thus under
the form of weakness his own power would be made evident. The Prophet
saw women with wings, because sudden would be the change, so that in one
day, as we shall presently see, wickedness was taken away. By the wings
of a *stork* either celerity or strength is indicated. This is the sum
of the whole.  <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md)

<span id="iii.vi.v"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.v-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="iii.vi.v-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou
threatens us with severe punishment to restrain us from sin, we may
regard thy judgment, and not abuse thy long-suffering in sparing us for
a time; and also that, whenever thou chastises us, we may seriously
consider that we deserve thy displeasure, as we have in various ways
provoked thy wrath: and may we not at the same time despair or be broken
down, but learn so to recomb on thy mercy as not to doubt but that there
will be a seasonable end to our evils, and that thou wilt not only
mitigate the rigor of punishment as far as necessary for our comfort,
but wilt also punish our enemies, so that we may know that nothing is
better for us, or more desirable, than to be chastised by thy hand, not
that thou mayest destroy us, but recall us to the way of salvation,
until we be at length made capable of receiving that favor which has
been laid up for us in heaven, through Jesus Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[54](cc30008.htm#fr_53.md) <span
id="iii.vi.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p14"></span> Some, such as *Piscator*, *Drusius*,
*Dathius*, *Newcome*, and *Henderson*, think that the verb \[<span
id="iii.vi.ii-p14.1"></span>שוב\] is used here adverbally, which is
sometimes the case, and render the sentence, “And I lifted up mine eyes
again.” The *Septuagint*, *Jerome*, and our version, have rendered it,
“I turned,” that is, from one vision to another, or from one direction
to another. “Returned” seems not so suitable.—*Ed.*

<span id="fn_54"></span>[55](cc30008.htm#fr_54.md) <span
id="iii.vi.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p19"></span> “From the temple,” says *Jerome*; “from
God,” says *Drusius*.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p20"></span>On the previous words, “this is the
curse,” *Henderson* makes the remark, that it is a similar phrase to
“this is my body,” that is, signifies my body; which is a mode of
speaking quite common in Scripture, and it is very strange that any
should attach to the phrase any other meaning.—*Ed.*

<span id="fn_55"></span>[56](cc30008.htm#fr_55.md) <span
id="iii.vi.ii-p21.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p22"></span> This is no doubt the best construction.
*Newcome* retains our version instead of “on this side;” so does
*Marckius*; but *Henderson* follows it in both instances. To render
\[<span id="iii.vi.ii-p22.1"></span>נקה\] “punished,” is not quite
correct, though the general meaning is given. It means to be cleared or
swept away, and so *Henderson* correctly renders it, “shall be cleared
away.” See <span id="iii.vi.ii-p22.2"></span>[Isa
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.vi.ii-p22.2"></span>; <span id="iii.vi.ii-p22.3"></span>[Jer.
30:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer030.htm#011.md), [Jer.
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer046.htm#028.md)<span
id="iii.vi.ii-p22.3"></span>. There is no necessity whatever for the
emendation of *Houbigant*, who thinks that it ought to be \[<span
id="iii.vi.ii-p22.4"></span>נקם\]; nor for the conjecture of others,
that it is put here for \[<span id="iii.vi.ii-p22.5"></span>נכה\], “to
be cut off.” Nor is *Blayney*’s version to be admitted, “because, on the
one hand, every one that stealeth *is* as he that is guiltless,” for it
is wholly inconsistent with the context. He regards it as a description
of the state of things which the curse was to rectify.—*Ed.*

<span id="fn_56"></span>[57](cc30008.htm#fr_56.md) <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p13"></span> <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p13.1"></span>*Impietas*; \[<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p13.2"></span>הרשעה\], rendered “wickedness” in our
version, and by *Newcome* and *Henderson*; “the wicked one,” by
*Blayney*; and \[<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p13.3"></span>ανομια\]—lawlessness, by the *Septuagint*.
It is a general term, which means what is unjust, wrong, wicked or
sinful, everything contrary to the will and command of God. *Leigh*
renders the adjective “Ungodly, lewd, turbelent, wavering, irreligious
towards God, debauched in morals, turbelent in the commonwealth,
unsettled in all things.” So the noun here may be regarded as including
*sin* universally, as committed against God and man. But *Henderson*
thinks, and perhaps not without reason, that idolatry is what is
especially intended, as the article \[<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p13.4"></span>ה\] is prefixed; and this had been the
chief sin or wickedness of the people, the mother of many other sins:
and this was certainly removed from the people after the Babylonian
captivity, as they had never been since guilty of idolatry, though of
many other sins.—*Ed.*

<span id="fn_57"></span>[58](cc30008.htm#fr_57.md) <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p14.2"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p15"></span> It is translated “\[<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p15.1"></span>μετρόν\]—measure,” by the *Septuagint*, and
“<span id="iii.vi.iii-p15.2"></span>modius—a bushel,” by *Grotius*; and
he says that an ephah was a measure nearly the size of a bushel.—*Ed.*

<span id="fn_58"></span>[59](cc30008.htm#fr_58.md) <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p18"></span> Respecting this “eye” there are
various opinions. *Newcome* and *Blayney* follow the *Septuagint* and
the *Syriac*, and render it, “their iniquity,” \[<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p18.1"></span>עונם\]; the difference being only of a
*vau* instead of a *iod*; and there is one MS. in which it is so found.
Then the sentence would be “This *is* their iniquity in all the land.”
But *Castalio*, *Grotius*, *Dathius*, and *Henderson* follow the
received text, only they give to \[<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p18.2"></span>עיז\] a similar meaning to that of our
version, — form, appearance, resemblance, or emblem, that is, what is
seen, what the eye observes; and this sense it evidently has in <span
id="iii.vi.iii-p18.3"></span>[Le
13:55](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#055.md)<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p18.3"></span>; <span id="iii.vi.iii-p18.4"></span>[Nu
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p18.4"></span>; <span id="iii.vi.iii-p18.5"></span>[Pr
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#031.md)<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p18.5"></span>; <span id="iii.vi.iii-p18.6"></span>[Ezek.
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#004.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#007.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.vi.iii-p18.6"></span>. “The meaning is,” says *Grotius*, “that
which thou seest symbolizes those things which the Jews have done and
which they have suffered.”—*Ed.*

<span id="fn_59"></span>[60](cc30008.htm#fr_59.md) <span
id="iii.vi.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p12"></span> *Henry*, *Marckius*, and *Scott*, and
also *Newcome*, take a different view of this vision, and consider it as
symbolizing the final destruction of the Jews by the Romans. The woman,
according to them, represents the apostate people, the two women who
carried the measure the Roman armies, the land of Shinar the land of
their dispersion, so called on account of their first captivity.
*Henderson* regards the vision as symbolic of the banishment of the sin
of idolatry from the land of Israel. “In this striking hieroglyphic,” he
says, “we are taught how idolatry, with all its accompanying atrocities,
was removed from the land of the Hebrews, which it had desecrated, to a
country devoted to it, and where it was to commingle with its native
elements, never to be reimported into Canaan. How exactly has the
prediction been fulfilled! From the time of the captivity to the
present, a period of more than 2000 years, the Hebrewpeople have never
once lapsed into idolatry!”

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p13"></span>This seems to be the most satisfactory
view; and I would adopt the reading of the *Septuagint* and the
*Syriac*, taking \[<span id="iii.vi.iv-p13.1"></span>עונם\] to be
\[<span id="iii.vi.iv-p13.2"></span>עונם\], not “their eye,” or, “their
appearance,” but “their iniquity,” and I would render verse 8 somewhat
different from others, as having been spoken by the angel *while* he was
casting the woman into the ephah. I give the following version of the
sixth, seventh, and eighth verses,—

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p14"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p15"></span>**6.** And I said, “What is it?” And he
said, “This is an ephah that is going forth:” he said also, “That
(pointing to a woman)

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p16"></span>**7.** is their iniquity through the
whole land. And, behold, a talent of lead was lifted up, and a woman was
sitting in the midst of the ephah: and he said, “This is the wicked
one,” when he cast her into the midst of the ephah, and cast the leaden
weight on its mouth.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p17"></span>“What is it?” signifies here, What does
it mean? for the Prophet of course knew it to be an ephah. \[<span
id="iii.vi.iv-p17.1"></span>זאת\] repeated is to be rendered “this” and
“that.” See <span id="iii.vi.iv-p17.2"></span>[1Ki
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/kg1003.htm#023.md)<span
id="iii.vi.iv-p17.2"></span>. The “two women” who carried away the ephah
were probably, as *Newcome* observes, “mere agents in the symbolic
vision,” not designed to set forth anything in particular; but *Grotius*
and *Henderson* think that they designated the Assyrian and the
Babylonian powers, through whom idolatry had been removed from the land
of Canaan.—*Ed.*
