<span id="iii.i-p1"></span>calvin’s preface to zechariah

<span id="iii.i-p2"></span>The Prophecies of Zechariah come next. He was
a fellow-helper and colleague Of Haggai, and also of Malachi, as it will
presently appear. These three, then, were sent by God nearly at the same
time, that they might assist one another, and that they might thus by
one consent and one mouth confirm what God had committed to them. It was
indeed of great service that several bore their testimony: their
prophecies gained thus greater authority; and this was needful, for the
people had to contend with various and most grievous trials. Satan had
already raised up great opposition to them; but there were still greater
evils at hand. Hence, to prevent them from despairing, it was necessary
to encourage them; by many testimonies.

<span id="iii.i-p3"></span>But what our Prophet had especially in view
was, to remind the Jews why it was that God dealt so severely with their
fathers, and also to animate them with hope, provided they really
repented, and elevated their minds to the hope of true and complete
deliverance. He at the same time severely reproves them; for there was
need of much cleansing, as they still continued in their filth. For
though the recollection of their exile ought to have restrained them,
and to have made them careful to fear and obey God, yet it seemed to
have been otherwise; and it will appear more fully as we proceed, that
being not conscious of having been punished for their sins, they were so
secure, that there was among them hardly and fear of God, or hardly any
religion. It was therefore needful to blend strong and sharp reproofs
with promises of favor, that they might thus be prepared to receive
Christ. This is the substance of the whole  <span
