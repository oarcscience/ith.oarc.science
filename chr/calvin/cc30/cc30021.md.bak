<span id="iv.iii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="iv.iii.i"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.iii.i-p1.1"></span>[Mal.
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.iii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And now, O ye priests, this
commandment *is* for you.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Et nunc ad vos praeceptum hoc, O
sacerdotes, —

<span id="iv.iii.i-p4"></span>**2.** If ye will not hear, and if ye will
not lay *it* to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of
hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your
blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay *it*
to heart.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Si non audieritis et non posueritis
super cor, ut detis gloriam nomini meo, dicit Iehova exercituum, mittam
(copula hic abundat) in vos maledictionem et maledicam benedictionibus
vestris, atque etiam maledixi eam (est mutatio numeri, pro eas,) quia
non ponitis super cor.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p6"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.i-p7"></span><span id="iv.iii.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p8"></span>Though the priests did not sin alone, yet
it is not without reason, as we have said, that they were regarded as
the first in wickedness; for it was their office to correct what the
people did amiss. Their dissimulation had the effect of encouraging the
common people to sin: hence the Prophet accuses them especially as the
authors of impiety; and this is what the words intimate, if they are
rightly considered.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p9"></span>*To you*, he says, *O priests*. They might
have indeed exonerated themselves, or at least transferred a part of
their guilt to others: “Oh! what can we do? for we see that the people
are growing cold in God’s worship; it is better that imperfect
sacrifices should be offered than none at all.” As then they might by
evasion have somewhat extenuated their guilt, the Prophet the more
sharply reproves them and says, *To you* especially *is addressed this
command*, as they ought to have shown to others the right way; for when
they dissembled, their connivance was nothing else but a consent; and
thus they divested the people of God’s fear, and allowed them to corrupt
the whole of religion by offering spurious sacrifices. *To you* then, he
says, that is, “Though the whole people is guilty before God, think not
that ye are on this account excused; for it behoves you to check this
wickedness, for God has set you over the people as their teachers and
guides: as then ye have neglected your duty, whatever others have done
amiss, falls justly on your heads. For how has it happened that the
people have dared to proceed so far in impiety? even because you have no
concern for religion; for God has promoted you to the priesthood for
this end — to preserve in integrity the worship of his name; but ye know
of all the prevailing profanations, and ye hold your peace: *To you*
then *is this command*.”

<span id="iv.iii.i-p10"></span><span id="iv.iii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p11"></span>He then adds, *If ye will not hear nor
lay it to heart to give glory to my name*, *etc*. He seems here to
threaten the priests alone; and yet if any one carefully considers the
whole passage, he will easily perceive that this address extends to the
whole people, in such a way however that it is in the first place
directed to the priests; for as I have said the greater portion of the
guilt belonged to them. God then denounces a heavy punishment on the
whole people as well as on the priests, even that he would *send a
curse*. But that they might not object and say that they were too
severely dealt with, God shows how justly he was displeased with them,
because they hearkened not nor attended to his warnings. What indeed is
less tolerable than not to hear God speaking? But as many thought it
enough to stretch the ear, and then immediately to forget what had been
spoken, it is added, *If ye lay it not to heart*, that is, If ye attend
not and seriously apply your hearts to what is said. We see then that
the Prophet shows how that God had a just cause for severely punishing
them; for it was an impiety not to be borne, when he could obtain no
hearing from men. But the Prophet shows at the same time what it is to
hear God; he therefore adds the latter clause as a definition or an
explanation of the former: for God is not heard, if we receive with
levity his words, so that they soon vanish away; but we hear them when
we lay them on the heart, or, as the Latins say, when we apply the mind
to them. There is then required a serious attention, otherwise it will
be the same as though the ears were closed against God.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p12"></span>Let us further learn from this passage
that obedience is of so much account with God, that he bears nothing
less than a contempt of his word or a careless attention to it, as
though we regarded not its authority. We must also notice that our guilt
before God is increased and enhanced, when he recalls us to the right
way, and seeks to promote our welfare by warning and exhorting us. When
therefore God is thus kindly careful for our salvation, we are doubly
inexcusable, if we perversely reject his teaching, warnings, counsels,
and other remedies which he may apply.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p13"></span>He now adds, *I will send on you a
curse*; and this curse he immediately explains, *I will curse your
blessings*  <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) The word blessing,
we know, means everywhere in Scripture the beneficence or kindness of
God. God then is said to bless us when he bountifully supports us and
supplies whatever is necessary for us. And hence seems to have arisen
the expression, that God by his nod alone can satisfy us with all
abundance of good things. By blessings then he means a large and an
abundant provision, and also rest from enemies, a healthy air, and
everything of this kind. Some think that those prayers are intended, by
which the priest blessed the people; but there is no reason for this.
God then had manifested his favor to the Jews; he now declares that he
will deprive them of all his benefits, that they might know that he is
not propitious to them. Blessings then are evidences of God’s bounty and
paternal favor.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p15"></span>But he immediately adds, *Yea, I have
cursed*. By which words he proves their senselessness: for they were not
even taught by their evils, which yet produce some effect even on fools,
who, according to the common proverb, begin to be wise when they are
chastised. God then here reproves the stupidity of the Jews; for they
had already been deprived of his benefits, and they might have known by
experience that he was not propitious to them, but on the contrary an
angry judge; and yet they were touched by no penitence, according to
what we have seen in the other Prophets.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p16"></span>We now understand the import of the
words, and at the same time the object of the Prophet: *I will* then
*curse your blessings, and what is more*, (so I explain, <span
id="iv.iii.i-p16.1"></span>וגם, *ugam*,) *I have already cursed* them:
but ye are like blocks of wood or stones; for the very scourges avail
nothing with you. He again repeats, *because ye lay it not on your
heart*, in order to show that he could not bear the contempt of his
word, for it was, as we have said, a sign of extreme impiety. It follows

<span id="iv.iii.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p2"></span>**3.** Behold, I will corrupt your seed,
and spread dung upon your faces, *even* the dung of your solemn feasts;
and *one* shall take you away with it.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p3"></span>**3.** Ecce ego corrumpo (vel perdo)
vobis semen (vertunt Graeci, brachium; sed decepti sunt in una litera,)
et spergam stercus super facies vestras, stercus solemnitatum vestrarum;
et tollet vos ad se (alii vertunt, tollet vos ad ipsum; sed coacta est
illa expositio.)

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p6"></span>He confirms here again what he had said
in the last verse, — that they would perceive God’s curse in want and
poverty. The curse of God is any kind of calamity; for as God declares
especially his favor by a liberal support, so the sterility of the land
and defective produce most clearly evidence the curse of God. The
Prophet then shows, by mentioning one thing, what sort of curse was nigh
the Jews, — that God would *destroy* their *seed*. Some read, but
improperly, “I will destroy you and the seed.” I wonder how learned men
make such puerile mistakes, when there is nothing ambiguous in the
Prophet’s words. *I will destroy* then *for you the seed*; that is, “Sow
as much as you please, I will yet destroy your seed, so that it shall
produce no fruit.” In short, he threatens the Jews with want and famine;
for the land would produce nothing when cursed by God.  <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md)

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p10"></span>But as the Jews flattered themselves on
account of their descent, and ever boasted of their fathers, and as that
preeminence with which God had favored them proved to them an occasion
of haughtiness and pride, the Prophet here ridicules this foolish
confidence, *I will scatter dung*, he says, *on your faces*: “Ye are a
holy nation, ye are the chosen seed of Abraham, ye are a royal
priesthood; these are your boastings; but the Lord will render your
faces filthy with dung; this will be your nobility and preeminence!
there is then no reason for you to think yourselves exempt from
punishments because God has adopted you; for as ye have abused his
benefits and profaned his name, so ye shall also find in your turn, that
he will cover you with everything disgraceful and ignominious, so as to
make you wholly filthy: ye shall then be covered all over with dung, and
shall not be the holy seed of Abraham.”

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p11"></span>But as they might have again raised a
clamor and say, “Have we then in vain so diligently served God? Why has
he bidden a temple to be built for him by us and promised to dwell
there? God then has deceived us, or at least his promises avail
nothing.” — The Prophet gives this answer, “God will overwhelm you with
disgrace and also your sacrifices.” But he calls them the *dung of
solemnities*, as though he had said, “I will cover you with reproach on
account of your impiety, which is seen in your sacrifices.” Had the Jews
any holiness they derived it from their sacrifices, by which they
expiated their sins and reconciled themselves to God: but the Prophet
says that it was their special ill-savor which offended God, and which
he abominated, because they vitiated their sacrifices. Nor is that to be
disapproved which some of the rabbins have said, that the Prophet
alludes to the oxen, calves, and rams; for when the Jews from various
places brought their sacrifices, there must have been much dung from all
that vast number. There is then here a striking allusion to the victims
themselves, as though he had said, “Ye think that I can be pacified by
your sacrifices, as though loads of dung were pleasing to me; for when
ye bring such a vast number, even the place itself, the area before the
temple, throws an ill-savor on account of the dung that is there. Ye are
then, forsooth! holy, and all your filth is cleansed away by means of
this dung. Begone then together with the dung of your solemnities; for I
will cast this very dung on your heads.”

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p12"></span>We now perceive what the Prophet means:
and emphatical are the words, *Behold I*; for God by these single words
cuts off all those pretences by which the Jews deceived themselves, and
thought that their vices were concealed from God: “I myself,” he says,
“am present, to whom ye think your sacrifices to be acceptable; *I* then
*will destroy your seed, and I will* also *cast dung on your faces*; all
the dignity which ye pretend shall be abolished, for ye think that ye
are defended by a sort of privilege, when ye boast yourselves to be the
seed of Abraham: it is dung, it is dung,” he says. He afterwards shows
what was especially the dung and the filth: for when they objected and
said, “What! have our sacrifices availed nothing?” he answers, “Nay, I
will cast that dung upon you, because the chief pollution is in your
sacrifices, for ye vitiate and adulterate my service: and what else is
your sacrifice but profanation only? ye are sacrilegious in all your
empty pomps. Since then all your victims have an ill-savor and displease
me, and as I nauseate them, (as it is also said in the first and last
chapter of Isaiah,) I will heap the dung on your own heads, because ye
think it to be your chief expiation.”

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p13"></span>He adds at last, *It shall take you to
itself*; that is, “Ye shall be dung altogether; and thus all your
boastings, that ye are descended from the holy Patriarch Abraham, shall
be wholly useless; though I made a covenant and promised that you should
be to me a royal priesthood, yet the dung shall *take you to itself*,
and thus whatever dignity I have hitherto conferred on you shall be
taken away.”  <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) Let us proceed

<span id="iv.iii.iii"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p1"></span><span
id="iv.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p2"></span>**4.** And ye shall know that I have
sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi,
saith the LORD of hosts.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p3"></span>**4.** Et scietis quod miserim ad vos
hoc mandatum ut sit (vel, ut esset; sed magis placet, ut sit; est, ad
assendum, ad verbum; ergo ad assendum pactum meum, si posset dici
Latine,) pactum meum cum Levi, dicit Iehova exercituum.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p6"></span>Here he addresses in particular the
priests; for though the whole people with great haughtiness resisted
God, yet the priests surpassed them. And we know how ready men are to
turn to evil whatever benefits God may bestow on them. It has been then
a common evil in men from the beginning of the world, to exalt
themselves and to raise their crests against God, when they found
themselves adorned with his benefits: but we know that the more any one
is bound to God the more thankful he ought to be, for our gifts are not
our own, but the benefits by which God binds us to himself.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p7"></span>“What best thou as thine own?” says
Paul, “thou best then no reason to glory.”  
(<span id="iv.iii.iii-p7.2"></span>[1Co
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#007)<span id="iv.iii.iii-p7.2"></span>.md)

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p8"></span>This evil however has ever prevailed
among men — that they have defrauded God of his glory, and have turned
to an occasion of pride the favors received from him. But it is an evil
which is very commonly seen in all governors; for they who are raised to
a high dignity, think no more that they are men, but take to themselves
very great liberty when they find themselves so much exalted above
others. Thus kings and those in authority seem to themselves to be above
the common order of men, and presumptuously disregard all laws; they
think that everything is lawful for them, as no one opposes their
willfulness. The same thing is also to be seen in teachers. For when God
favored the priests with the highest honor, they became blinded, as it
will hereafter be seen, by that favor of God, that they thought
themselves to be as it were semi-gods; and the same thing has taken
place in the kingdom of Christ.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p9"></span>For how have arisen so great impieties
under the Papacy, except that pastors have exercised tyranny and not
just government? For they have not regarded the purpose for which they
have been called into their office, but as the name of pastor is in
itself honorable, they have dared to raise themselves above the clouds,
and to assume to themselves the authority of God himself. Hence it has
been, that they have dared to bind consciences by their own laws, to
change the whole truth, and to corrupt the whole worship of God: and
hence also followed the scandalous sale of justice. How have these
things happened? Because priests were counted as angels come down from
heaven; and this same danger is ever to be feared by us.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p10"></span>This then is the vice which the Prophet
now refers to; and he shows that the priests had no reason to think that
they could shake off the yoke, *Ye shall know*, he says, *that to you
belongs this command*. We indeed see what they objected to Jeremiah,

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p11"></span>“The law shall not depart from the
priests nor counsel and wisdom from the elders.” (<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p11.1"></span>[Jer
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p11.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p12"></span>These are the weapons by which the
Papists at this day defend themselves. When we allege against them plain
proofs from Scripture, they find themselves clearly reproved and
convicted by God’s word; but here is their Ajax’s shield, under which
they hide all their wickedness, retailing as it were from the ungodly
and wicked priests what is related by Jeremiah, “‘The law shall not
depart from the priests;’ we are the Church, can it err? is not the Holy
Spirit dwelling in the midst of us? ‘I am with you always to the end of
the world,’ (<span id="iv.iii.iii-p12.1"></span>[Mt
28:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p12.1"></span>;) did Christ intend to deceive his Church
when he said this to his Apostles? and we are their successors.” The
Prophet now gives the answer, *Ye shall know*, he says, *that to you,
belongs this cornmand*

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p13"></span>And he adds, not without severity,
*that my covenant may be with Levi*;  <span
id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) as though he had said, “On what
account are ye thus elated? for God cannot get a hearing for himself,
yet ye say that the covenant with Levi is not to be void, as though God
had put Levi in his own place, and divested himself of all authority
when he appointed that tribe, and made you ministers of the temple and
teachers of the people; is he nothing? What was God’s purpose when he
honored you with that dignity? He certainly did not mean to reduce
himself to nothing, but, on the contrary, his will was, that his own
right should remain entire and complete. When therefore I reprove your
vices, and show that ye are become vile, and as it were dung, that ye
are defiled by everything disgraceful, — when I make these things openly
known, I do not violate the covenant made with Levi. God then justly
summons you before his tribunal, and strips you of your honor, in order
that the covenant he made with Levi may be confirmed and ratified.” This
is, as I have said, a severe derision.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p15"></span>But we may hence learn a useful truth.
The Prophet briefly teaches us that the priestly office takes away
nothing from God’s authority, who requires a pure and holy worship, and
that it lessens in nothing the authority of the law, for sound doctrine
ought ever to prevail. So at this day, when we resist the Papal priests,
we do not violate God’s covenant, that is, it is no departure from the
order of the Church, which ought ever to remain sacred and inviolable.
We do not then on account of men’s vices, subvert the pastoral office,
and the preaching of the word; but we assail the men themselves, so that
due order may be restored, that sound doctrine may obtain a hearing
among men, that the worship of God may be pure, which these unprincipled
men have violated. We therefore boldly attempt to subvert the whole of
the Papacy, with this full confidence, that we lessen nothing from the
authority of teaching, nor in any way defraud the pastoral office; nay,
order in the Church, the preaching of the truth, and the very dignity of
pastors, cannot exist, except the Church be purged from its defilements,
and its filth removed. Thus must we say also of those unprincipled men,
who are too nearly connected with us, or too near us, and I wish they
were wholly extinct in the world: but how many pests conceal themselves
under this covering, or under this mask — “What! are we not the
ministers of the word?” So say you who are without any principle; I wish
ye were in your dung, or in your cells, where formerly ye too much
corrupted the world; but now the devil has brought you forth into the
Church of God, that ye may corrupt whatever had hitherto remained sound.
As then there are many at this day who boast of this honor — that they
are ministers of the word, and pastors, and that they teach the gospel,
they ought to be checked by this answer of the Prophet — that when all
their corruptions are fully and really cleansed away, then confirmed and
ratified will be the compact which God would have to be valid with his
Church and with the ministers of his word. He then adds an explanation —

<span id="iv.iii.iv"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p1"></span><span id="iv.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p2"></span>**5.** My covenant was with him of life
and peace; and I gave them to him *for* the fear wherewith he feared me,
and was afraid before my name.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p3"></span>**5.** Foedus meum fuit cum eo vitae et
pacis; et dedi illi timorem; et timuit me, et a facie nominis mei
contritus fuit.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p6"></span>The Prophet now proves more clearly how
God violates not his covenant, when he freely rebukes the priests, and
exposes also their false attempts in absurdly applying to themselves the
covenant of God, like the Papal priests at this day, who say that they
are the Church. How? because they have in a regular order succeeded the
apostles; but this is a foolish and ridiculous definition; for he who
occupies the place of another ought not on that account only to be
deemed a successor. Were a thief to kill the master of a family, and to
occupy his place, and to take possession of all his goods, is he to be
accounted his legitimate successor? So these dishonest men, to show that
they are to be regarded as apostles, only allege a continued course of
succession; but the likeness between them ought rather to be the subject
of inquiry. We must see first whether they have been called, and then
whether they answer to their calling; neither of which can they prove.
Then their definition is altogether frivolous.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p7"></span>So also our Prophet here shows, that the
priests made pretences and deceived the common people, while they sought
to prove themselves heirs of the covenant which God had made with Levi
their father, that is, with the tribe itself. “I shall be faithful,”
says God, “and my faithfulness will be evident from the compact itself;
*my compact with your father was that of life and peace*:  <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) but it was mutual: ye seem not to
think that there are two parties in a compact, and that there is,
according to what is commonly said, a reciprocal obligation: but I on my
part promised to your father to be his father, and I also stipulated
with him that he was to obey me, to obey my word, and whatever I might
afterwards require. Now ye will have me to be bound to you, and
yourselves to be free from every obligation. What equity is this — that
I should owe everything to you and you nothing to me? *My compact* then
*with him was that of life and peace*; but what is your compact? what is
it that ye owe to me? Even what the mutual compact which I made with
your father Levi and his tribe requires; perform this, and ye shall find
that I am faithful and constant in all my promises.” I cannot go farther
now.

<span id="iv.iii.v"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.v-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="iv.iii.v-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God that as thou hast been
pleased to choose us at this day thy priests, and hast consecrated us to
thyself by the blood of thine only-begotten Son and through the grace of
thy Spirit, — O grant, that we may rightly and sincerely perform our
duties to thee, and be so devoted to thee that thy name may be really
glorified in us; and may we be thus more and more confirmed in the hope
of those promises by which thou not only guides us through the course of
this earthly life, but also invites us to thy celestial inheritance; and
may Christ thy Son so rule in us, that we may ever cleave to our head,
and be gathered as his members into a participation of that eternal
glory into which he has gone before us. — Amen.

<span id="iv.iii.vi"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Seventy-fourth

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p2"></span>We began in the last lecture to explain
what the Prophet says here of the priesthood, and we have said that the
sum of the whole is — that wicked priests in vain lay claim to the title
of honor, who do not faithfully perform their office; for the compact
between God and them is mutual, inasmuch as God did not institute
priests under the law in order to allow them unbridled liberty, or to
deprive himself of every power; but, on the contrary, he set them over
the Church in order to retain the people in true religion. As then the
obligation is, as they say, reciprocal, there is no reason for the
priests to arrogate supreme power and to deprive God of it. The Prophet
then had said, that God’s compact with Levi was that of life and peace,
because God, who is faithful in his promises, had promised to be
propitious to the Levites. Our Prophet therefore calls it the compact of
life and peace, because the Levites had found that God was in every
respect kind and bountiful, whenever they performed their parts.

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p3"></span>He now adds, *I gave to him fear, and he
feared me*. The interpreters who consider the preposition *for*, or, on
account of (*propter*), to be understood, pervert the whole sense; for
fear here is to be taken for the rule of worshipping God, as though he
had said, “I have prescribed how he is rightly to perform his office.”
He means then that God gave to the Levites a knowledge of the way in
which he was to be served, because he would not have them to wander
according to their own notions, but he prescribed to them the duties of
their office, as though he had said, “Ye are indeed endued with no
common honor, for ye are the teachers of the Church; but yet I have laid
a restraint upon you, as I have commanded the people to obey you, so
have I commanded you what to do. Since then I have given my fear to
Levi, since I have prescribed how he is to worship me, is it not now
most shameless and most impious, to boast of the honorable name of
priesthood, and at the same time to be no priests? for what is it to be
God’s priest, except to govern the Church as God has commanded? *I have*
then *given him my fear*.”  <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md)

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p9"></span>*And he feared me*; that is, he observed
the law laid down for him; *and he was contrite before my name*; that
is, “he conducted himself in a humble manner, he did not exalt himself
by vain pride, that he might oppress my Church, rule tyrannically, and
subvert all due order; but he was an example of humility, for he owned
himself the more bound to me, because I honored him with so much dignity
as to make him the ruler of my Church.” It afterwards follows —

<span id="iv.iii.vii"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p2"></span>**6.** The law of the truth was in his
mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in
peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p3"></span>**6.** Lex veritatis fuit in ore ejus,

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p6"></span>He explains mote fully how Levi
responded to God’s command, — that he had *the law of truth in his
mouth*. The chief duty of a priest is to show the right way of living to
the people; for however upright and holy one may be through his whole
life, he is not on that account to be deemed a priest. Hence our Prophet
dwells especially on this point — that Levi taught the people. He does
not speak of Levi himself; for we know that Levi was dead when Aaron was
made a priest. For God does not here speak of individuals, but of the
tribe; as though he had said, “Aaron and Eleazar, and those who followed
them, knew for what end they were honored with the priesthood, and they
faithfully performed their duties.” The Prophet now explains what God
mainly requires from priests — to show to the people, as I have already
said, the way of living a pious and holy life; but he adopts different
words, which yet mean the same thing.

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p7"></span>*The law of truth*, he says, *was in his
mouth*. Why does he not commend the integrity of his heart rather than
his words? Had he spoken of an individual, the Prophet might have justly
said, that he who sought to be an approved servant of God, had conducted
himself harmless towards men; but he speaks of a public office, when he
says, that the law of truth was in his mouth; for he is not worthy of
that honor who is mute: and nothing is more preposterous, or even more
ridiculous, than that those should be counted priests who are no
teachers. These two things are, as they say, inseparable — the office of
the priesthood and teaching.

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p8"></span>And that he might more clearly show that
he speaks not of an ordinary matter, he repeats the same thing in other
words, *Iniquity was not found in his lips*. We hence see that all this
belongs peculiarly to the sacerdotal office. He afterwards adds, *In
peace and rectitude he walked before me*. The Prophet here commends also
the sincere concern for religion which the first priests manifested, for
they walked with God in peace and uprightness; they not only carried
signals in their lips and mouth, by which they might have been justly
deemed the ministers of God and the pastors of his Church; but they also
executed faithfully their office. And he alludes to the peace of which
he had spoken: as God then had promised peace to the Levites, so also he
says, that the Levites had lived themselves peaceably before God; for
they did not break the covenant which he had made with them. As then
they had responded to the stipulation of God, he says that they had
walked in peace: but he also mentions how this was; it was, because they
had walked in uprightness.

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p9"></span>And the phrase, <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p9.1"></span>אתי, *ati*, with me, ought to be observed;
for it confirms what I have stated, — that the honor of the priesthood
in no way lessens God’s authority, for he keeps the priests devoted to
himself. He intimates then that they were not elevated to such a height,
that their dignity took away anything from God’s authority: for the
obligation, which has been mentioned, ought to be mutual: God is
faithful; the priests also must be faithful in their office, and show
themselves to be the legitimate ministers of God.  <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md)

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p12"></span>He also mentions the fruit of their
doctrine; for Levi *turned many from iniquity*, that is, he led many to
repentance. It afterwards follows (for this verse ought to be joined) —

<span id="iv.iii.viii"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p1"></span><span
id="iv.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.iii.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p2"></span>**7.** For the priest’s lips should
keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he *is*
the messenger of the LORD of hosts.

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p3"></span>**7.** Certe labia sacerdotis
custodient scientiam, et Legem requirent ex ore ejus, quia nuntius
Iehovae exercituum est.

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p6"></span>What the Prophet has said of the first
priests he extends now to the whole Levitical tribe, and shows that it
was a perpetual and unchangeable law as to the priesthood. He had said
that Levi had been set over the Church, not to apply to himself the
honor due to God, but to stand in his own place as the minister of God,
and the teacher of the chosen people. The same thing he now confirms,
declaring it as a general truth that *the lips of the priest ought to
retain knowledge*, as though he had said, that they were to be the
store-house from which the food of the Church was to be drawn. God then
did appoint the priests over his chosen people, that the people might
seek their food from them as from a store-room, according to what we
find to be the case with a master of a family, who has his store of wine
and his store of provisions. As then the food of a whole family is
usually drawn out from places where provisions are laid up, so the
Prophet makes use of this similitude, — that God has deposited knowledge
with the priests, so that the mouth of every priest might be a kind of
store-house, so to speak, from which the people are to seek knowledge
and the rule of a religious life: *Keep knowledge* then *shall the lips
of the priest, and the law shall they seek from his mouth*  <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md)

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p10"></span>He shows how it is to be kept; the
priests are not to withhold it, but the whole Church is to enjoy the
knowledge of which they are the keepers. They shall then seek or demand
the law from his mouth.

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p11"></span>Law may be taken simply for truth; but
the Prophet no doubt alludes here to the doctrine of Moses, the only
true fountain of all knowledge. We indeed know that God included in his
law whatever was necessary for the welfare of his Church; nor was there
anything added by the Prophets. Our Prophet then so includes every truth
in the word, <span id="iv.iii.viii-p11.1"></span>תורה, *ture*, law, that
he might at the same time show that it was laid up in what Moses has
taught.

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p12"></span>He says in the last place, that the
priest is the *messenger of Jehovah*. He briefly defines here what the
priesthood is, even an embassy which God commits to men, that they may
be his interpreters in teaching and ruling the Church. What then is a
priest? A messenger of God, and his interpreter. It hence follows that
the office of teaching cannot be separated from the priesthood; for it
is a monstrous thing when any one boasts himself to be a priest, when he
is no teacher. The Prophet then draws an argument from the definition
itself, when he says that a priest is a *messenger* of God. Then follows
the contrast when he says

<span id="iv.iii.ix"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p1"></span><span id="iv.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.iii.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p2"></span>**8.** But ye are departed out of the
way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the
covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p3"></span>**8.** Atqui vos declinastis e via,
impingere (vel, ruere) fecistis multos in lege; corrupistis foedus Levi,
dicit Iehova exercituum.

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p6"></span>He shows here how far were the priests of
his time from fulfilling that compact which he had mentioned. He hence
concludes that they were unworthy of the honor of which they were so
confidently proud, and under the shadow of which they sought to cover
their vices, as though they were not bound to God, and were at liberty
to tread the Church under foot with impunity. He then shows that it was
an extremely foolish arrogance in them to seek to be exempt from all
law, and yet to regard God and the whole Church bound to them.

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p7"></span>He says first, that they *deviated from
the way*, that is, they exhibited nothing suitable to their office, on
account of which they were counted priests. He then amplifies their
guilt — that they *made many to stumble in the law*  <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) He had before said that Levi walked in
peace and uprightness; what he now says is very different — that the
priests, forgetting religion, had first shaken off the yoke. He had said
that Levi restored many from iniquity; but he now says that the priests
made many to stumble.

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p10"></span>He adds in the last place — *Ye have
therefore corrupted the covenant*. An illative is to be put here, for so
ought the sentence to be explained — “As ye have deviated from the way,
and perverted the whole worship of God, ye have thus violated the
compact which had been sanctioned with Levi; ye have then no reason to
boast of your title of honor, for succession failed when ye fell away
from the faithfulness of your father Levi.” At length it follows —

<span id="iv.iii.x"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.x-p1"></span><span id="iv.iii.x-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.iii.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.x-p2"></span>**9.** Therefore have I also made you
contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not
kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p3"></span>**9.** Atqui etiam ego dedi vos probrosos
et abjectos toti populo, secundum quod non servastis vias meas, et
extulistis personas in lege.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.x-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.x-p6"></span>The Prophet draws this conclusion — that
the priests in vain gloried in the honor of their office, for they had
ceased to be the priests of God. We may now return to the main point.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p7"></span>We perceive what the subject is which the
Prophet handles here: as the priests sought by a peculiar privilege to
exempt themselves from all reproof, he assails them in particular; for
teaching would have been useless as to the common people, except the
priests themselves were brought to order. The priests no doubt flattered
the people, and thus attempted to deprive the Prophets of every respect,
in order that their doctrine might produce no effect. This is the reason
why our Prophet so sharply reproves them. But we must consider the state
of the case. The priests said that they had been set, by divine
authority, over the whole Church, and that they could not be deprived of
that honor which they had received from God. They however took only but
one part of the covenant, and yet sought to deprive God of his right.
The Prophet here answers them — that God had indeed favored them with no
common honor in appointing them the priests of his Church, but that the
compact, which included a mutual stipulation, was at the same time to be
considered; for God had not simply appointed them the guides of his
Church, but had also added a condition.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p8"></span>We hence see that the hinge of the matter
was, that the priests presumptuously and absurdly laid hold on what
favored only their own cause, and at the same time passed by and
cunningly overlooked the chief thing — that the priesthood was connected
with the worship of God. Now had they attained what they wished, there
would have been no God in the Church, but they would have exercised over
it a tyrannical power. But it has ever been, and is still the will of
God, to retain the supreme power over mortals in his own hand.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p9"></span>Having now seen the design of the Prophet,
we may easily perceive the import of the whole subject. But before we
proceed farther, we must first observe, that we have here described to
us the character of true and legitimate priests; for the Prophet not
only speaks of the office of priests, but sets before us a living image
in which we cannot be deceived: and hence all who are engaged in the
pastoral office may know what God requires from them. I will only just
mention what he first says — that God gave fear to priests; for I have
already given a sufficient explanation of this by saying, that priests
are not to abuse their right, as though the highest power were granted
to them; for God will not have his Church subject to tyranny, but his
will is to reign alone in it through the ministry of men. The main thing
then to be borne in mind is this — that a rule is prescribed to priests,
that though they preside and possess the first rank of honor among the
people, it is yet under certain conditions.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p10"></span>We shall now consider only this which the
Prophet says — that Levi faithfully and sincerely performed his office,
because *the law of truth was in his mouth*, and *no iniquity was found
in his lips*; to which we ought yet to add the general truth which
immediately follows — that the priest’s lips ought to keep knowledge. It
is then a law which cannot be abolished, that those who are priests or
pastors in the Church are to be teachers. And not unwisely does Gregory
apply a custom under the law to this subject; for we know that appended
to the priest’s dress were bells; and it is distinctly commanded by
Moses, that the priest should not go forth without this sound, (<span
id="iv.iii.x-p10.1"></span>[Ex
28:35](../../../bib/kjv/exo028.htm#035.md)<span
id="iv.iii.x-p10.1"></span>.) Gregory, as I have said, accommodated this
to teaching — “Woe,” he says, “to us, if we go forth without sound, that
is, if we boast that we are pastors, and in the meantime are dumb dogs;
for nothing is less tolerable than that he who speaks not in the Church
and whose voice is not clearly heard to the edification of the people,
should be deemed a pastor.” This is what a Roman Pope has said. Let
those who now proudly and confidently boast themselves to be his
successors, at least give the sound, and let us hear what they teach:
but as their whole power is exercised in cruelty, it is evident how
faithfully they keep God’s covenant! But I now return to the words of
the Prophet.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p11"></span>He says, that this law has been fixed by
God, and that it cannot be nullified by any decrees or customs of men, —
that the priest is to *keep knowledge* in his lips. He farther explains
himself by showing that the priest is to be the keeper of knowledge, not
that he may reserve it for himself, but that he may teach the whole
people: *they shall seek*, he says, *the law from his mouth*; and
afterwards he confines knowledge to true doctrine, as it was to flow
from the law of God, the only true fountain of truth; for he had said,
that the law of truth was in the mouth of Levi. It would not then be
enough for one to have his mouth open and to be prepared to teach
others, except purity of doctrine be retained. We hence see, that not
only teaching is required from priests, but pure teaching, derived from
the very mouth of God, according to what is said in <span
id="iv.iii.x-p11.1"></span>[Eze
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#017.md)<span id="iv.iii.x-p11.1"></span>,

<span id="iv.iii.x-p12"></span>“Thou shalt receive from my mouth the
word, and shalt declare it to them from me.”

<span id="iv.iii.x-p13"></span>God shows there that the Prophets had no
such authority as that they could bring forth anything they pleased, or
what they thought would be right, but that they were so far faithful
teachers as they were his disciples alone: hence he bids him to seek the
word from his mouth; and then he adds, “Thou shalt declare it to them
from my mouth.” So also it is said in <span
id="iv.iii.x-p13.1"></span>[Jer
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.iii.x-p13.1"></span>,

<span id="iv.iii.x-p14"></span>“What is the chaff to the wheat? The
Prophet who has a dream, let him declare his dream; but he who has my
word, let him declare my word faithfully.”

<span id="iv.iii.x-p15"></span>Here God limits and defines the prophetic
right, as though he had said, that the Prophets were not appointed, that
they might bring anything indiscriminately, but that each, according to
the measure of what was revealed to him, might faithfully dispense, or
deliver, as it were from hand to hand, what he had received from heaven:
for by mentioning two things, it was God’s design to show that no
doctrine is to be allowed, except what he himself has revealed; and he
compares to chaff whatever men devise themselves, while the pure
doctrine of the law is to be regarded as the wheat. This is then the
second thing to be noticed in what the Prophet says in this passage: but
we must also consider the last thing — that the priest is the
*messenger* of the God of hosts.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p16"></span>This seems to have been said in honor of
the priesthood; but the Prophet means that priests have nothing of their
own or separate from God, and that whatever reverence is due to them
ought to be referred to God himself, whose ministers they are. I have
said that he reasons from the definition itself, as though he had said,
that every one who would be a priest must also be a teacher. But we must
also observe, that there is an implied comparison between God and
priests, as though he had said, “Priests can claim nothing for
themselves, but as interpreters of God.” Hence, the plain conclusion is,
that the priesthood takes away nothing from God’s authority.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p17"></span>We now see that the Prophet includes in
these few words two things of great importance — that there is no
priesthood without doctrine or teaching, and no priest except he who
faithfully performs his office as a teacher: and secondly, that God
resigns not his own right and power when priests are set over the
Church; for God commits to them the ministration only, and on this
condition, that the authority remains in himself alone; for otherwise
the priest would not be the messenger of the God of hosts. Among other
things the Prophet requires also this of the priests — that they
sincerely perform their duties. We indeed know that many apparently
discharge their office, and excel in teaching, and carefully apply to
their duties; but ambition stimulates some and avarice others. Hence the
Prophet lays down another condition — that they are to walk in
uprightness before God; that is, that they are not only to satisfy men,
or to catch at the applause of the world, but to discharge their office
with a pure conscience.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p18"></span>Thus have I shown that there is here set
before our eyes a pattern by which we may know what God requires from us
when he makes us pastors over his Church.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p19"></span>Now follows a reprobation of their
conduct, for the Prophet says, *Ye have departed from the way*. Since he
so boldly chastises the priests, we hence learn that they were subject
to reproof; and nothing is more unreasonable than that the Papal clergy
should seek to be exempt from every law and discipline, for the priests
are here called to order, that they might know their own faults: *Ye
have departed*, he says, *from the way*, and then, *ye have made many to
err in the law*. This second thing being added, the priests ought by no
means to be spared. When they sin only privately, though they may by bad
examples corrupt the Church, yet this may somehow be borne with; but
when they corrupt and deprave sound doctrine, when they subvert the
order laid down in the law, they deserve no indulgence. This is the
reason why Malachi so severely and so boldly reproves them.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p20"></span>He at last adds, *Ye have therefore
violated the covenant*. This third clause may indeed be explained in two
ways, — that the Prophet proceeds with his reproof, or that he draws a
conclusion from the preceding clauses, — that they were deservedly
stripped of all honor, because they stood not to the covenant. Now this
latter exposition is the most suitable, according to what I have already
stated. He then as I have said, draws this conclusion, that their
boasting was foolish, that they in vain said that they were a holy tribe
whom God had chosen to be a peculiar possession to himself, for he says
that the covenant of Levi had been violated by them; and this clause is
set in opposition to the former, in which he says, ye shall know that my
covenant was with Levi. We said then that the unfaithful ever contrive
some disguise when they are reproved, as though they would deprive God
of his right: so the Levitical priests said, that what God had once
established could not be made void. Under this pretext, that they were
of the holy tribe, they sought to be deemed holy; the Prophet then said
to them, ye shall know that God’s covenant is holy, and that ye are not
holy. So also in this place, *Ye have violated*  <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) *the covenant of Levi*, that is, “ye
in vain pretend that you have been chosen by God, and that the honor of
your priesthood has been confirmed to you; for God intended that his
law, laid down by himself, should be kept. As then ye have violated the
covenant of Levi, ye are no more Levites; as ye are become degenerated
children, your inheritance is rightly taken away from you, and ye are
deprived of the honor of the priesthood.

<span id="iv.iii.x-p22"></span>And corresponding with this view is what
follows, *And I have already rendered* (or, will render) *you despicable
and base to the whole people*,  <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md)
*as ye have not kept my ways and had respect of persons in the law*
 <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) God first shows that he was now
bound by no law, so that he would not cast away these unfaithful priests
who had broken his covenant. He also adds, that they had *respect to
persons in the law*, for they coveted gain, and therefore turned to
gratify men, and corrupted the whole truth of religion; and this is
indeed a necessary consequence, when ambition or avarice bears rule,
there can then be no sincerity, and the teaching of true religion will
be adulterated. I cannot now finish. We shall consider tomorrow the
difference between the ancient priesthood and that of the Christian
Church.

<span id="iv.iii.xi"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="iv.iii.xi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast
deigned to take us as a priesthood to thyself, and hast chosen us when
we were not only of the lowest condition, but even profane and alien to
all holiness, and hast consecrated us to thyself by thy Holy Spirit,
that we may offer ourselves as holy victims to thee, — O grant, that we
may bear in mind our office and our calling, and sincerely devote
ourselves to thy service, and so present to thee our efforts and our
labors, that thy name may be truly glorified in us, and that it may
really appear that we have been in grafted into the body of thy
only-begotten Son; and as he is the chief and the only true and
perpetual priest, may we become partakers of that priesthood with which
thou hast been pleased to honor him, so that he may take us as
associates to himself; and may thus thy name be perpetually glorified by
the whole body as well as by the head. — Amen.

<span id="iv.iii.xii"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Seventy-fifth

<span id="iv.iii.xii-p2"></span>We said yesterday, that the priests of
the ancient Church were made its guides on the condition that they
faithfully discharged their office, and further, that when wicked
priests who acted perfidiously in their office boasted of their dignity,
this false pretense was to be deemed as nothing, the title being claimed
without the reality. These two things we have explained.

<span id="iv.iii.xii-p3"></span>We must now see whether this applies to
the state and discipline of the Christian Church. The Papists deny this,
for they wish to rule freely and with unbridled license, and to perform
nothing to God, as though their very dignity nullified his authority;
but they cannot shake off the yoke, except they deprive God of all his
right. Nor is it a wonder that they act in this way; for even under the
law the Prophet had a hard contest with ungodly priests, who had fallen
away from the duties of their office, their calling being ever in their
mouths, though they very far departed from the law which God had
prescribed to them. There is therefore nothing new in the case of the
Papists, who seek to be free from every law, that they may do whatever
they please and despise all reproofs; for they indeed possess power, and
that tyrannical and barbarous. But what they say we ought to disregard,
for God declares from above what we here read in the Prophet’s words, —
that he so rules the Church, that he is supreme above all mortals. It
was not God’s will, most surely, after Christ’s coming in the flesh, to
abandon the care and government of his Church, nor was it his will to be
forced to submit as a private individual. If then the authority of God
remains at this day safe and secure, it follows that nothing is changed
in this respect as to his right over the priesthood. Whatever authority
they pretend, who would be deemed pastors of the Church, they must
necessarily so continue in their station as faithfully to perform the
office which has been committed to them from above; for as God has
raised them to that great honor, so he has also stipulated with them,
that they should faithfully rule the Church.

<span id="iv.iii.xii-p4"></span>But if the Papal clergy compare
themselves with the Levitical priests, they will find that the latter
had the advantage; for God, as it is well known, instituted an
hereditary priesthood under the law. His purpose was, that after the
coming of Christ pastors should be made by the suffrages of the Church;
but the Levitical tribe claimed this honor as their own right under the
law; for God had deposited the right and honor of the priesthood in that
tribe. If then the Papists contend that more is due to them than to the
Levitical priests, their claim is absurd; for there is no hereditary
right, so that sons succeed their fathers in the ministry or pastoral
office. We hence see that if a comparison be in this respect made, the
priesthood under the law was as to succession far more important. And we
know also what God had promised to Aaron and to his successors. From
Aaron the dignity passed to the posterity of Phinehas, and he seems to
have been favored, and also his descendants, with an unalienable right.
But God here expostulates with the priests, because they had violated
the compact; and hence he says that he was no longer bound to them,
because they had become covenant-breakers and apostates. Let now the
Pope, with all his party, pretend what they please, most certain it is,
that all they can allege vanish into nothing compared with the lofty
claims which the Levitical priests might have apparently made.

<span id="iv.iii.xii-p5"></span>The Pope says that the apostolic seat
was fixed at Rome, because it was said to Peter, “Thou art Peter,” etc.
(<span id="iv.iii.xii-p5.1"></span>[Mt
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xii-p5.1"></span>.) I will not stop here to refute trifles of
this kind; for there is no need of many words in discussing this point —
whether this ought to be confined to the person of Peter, or whether it
is to be extended to others; as it is not there stated. He says that
Peter was a Roman bishop. Though this be conceded, (which yet can be
easily disproved by history,) it does not follow that the primacy by a
sort of hereditary right was transferred to all Roman bishops. Hence the
succession, of which they proudly boast, is a mere fume. But were we to
grant all they require, we must make this exception, — that the
priesthood was not fixed to the place, so that every one called the
bishop of the Roman Church should at the same time obtain the primacy,
and be reputed head of the whole Church.

<span id="iv.iii.xii-p6"></span>We must also in the second place see
what sort of thing is the Papal priesthood; for though that beast
appoints his own priests, it follows not that it is the ordination of
Christ: nor is it anything like it. For what is a priest under the
Papacy? even one who sacrifices Christ, that is, who robs Christ of that
honor which the heavenly Father has confirmed to him by a solemn oath.
Christ was called a priest; and this honor, as I have just said, was
confirmed to him by an oath. All the Papal priests are inaugurated into
their office, it at they may sacrifice: “We give to thee power to offer
appeasing sacrifices;” for thus they inaugurate them: and such words are
suitable to the Papists; for those magical superstitions, which the
Romans formerly used, continue still under the Papacy. We hence see,
that when we examine the Papal priesthood according to the rule of
Christ, it is altogether profane, nay, wholly sacrilegious.

<span id="iv.iii.xii-p7"></span>But were their calling lawful, were we
to grant that they are pastors of the Church, by a continued succession
from the apostles, we must yet deny that they are to be allowed to claim
all kinds of liberty and to tyrannize over the Church without being
reproved; for whence do they derive such a privilege?

<span id="iv.iii.xii-p8"></span>We therefore in short draw this
conclusion — that what we read here of the Levitical priests not only
applies to the Papal priests, but also bears with much more force
against them; for they have no hereditary honor, their calling is not
true nor legitimate, and they cannot be counted the pastors of the
Church; on the other hand, they deprive Christ of his honor, yea, they
daily sacrifice and slay him. We hence conclude, that they ought by no
means to be suffered in the Church, for the covenant of God ought to
remain inviolable; and what is it? that they keep the law of God in
their mouth, and be his messengers and interpreters. When we see that
these are dumb idols, yea, when we see that they turn the whole truth of
God into falsehood, how can this barbarity be suffered? God is excluded,
and the devil himself in the persons of men adulterates the whole
worship of God, perverts, demolishes, and even reduces to nothing the
whole of religion! and he also fills with lies the Church, which ought
to be the sanctuary of truth!

<span id="iv.iii.xii-p9"></span>These things might have been more fully
handled; but it is enough briefly to show how foolishly the Papal clergy
boast that they possess the honor of the priesthood, when yet it is
evident that there is no right, no authority, when faith is not kept
with God and with his Church. Let us now proceeds

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p6"></span>The Prophet accuses the Jews here of
another crime — that they were perfidious towards God and their own
brethren, and departed from that pre-eminence into which God had raised
them, when they were chosen in preference to other nations to be a holy
and peculiar people. This ingratitude the Prophet now condemns by
saying, that they *all had one father, and that they had been all
created by one God*

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p7"></span>The word *Father* may be applied to God
as well as to Abraham, and some interpreters will have it repeated,
which is no uncommon thing in Hebrew: they say then that all had God as
their Father, because he created them all; so that the latter clause is
taken as an explanation. But it is better, as I think, to apply the word
to Abraham, and the passage requires this; for it follows at the end of
the verse, that the covenant which the Lord had made with their fathers
had been violated; and this will appear still more certain, when we bear
in mind the design of the Prophet.  <span
id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) Presently a reproof follows, because
they had taken many wives; but the Prophet seems not as yet to mention
this vice, but speaks generally, that they did not preserve that purity
to which they had been called, for they indiscriminately married heathen
wives. As then they mingled without distinction with unbelievers and the
despisers of God, the Prophet complains that they were unmindful of that
dignity to which they had been elevated, when God deigned to adopt them
as his holy people. For thus it happened, that the pre-eminence which
Moses celebrates in <span id="iv.iii.xiii-p8.1"></span>[De
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p8.1"></span>, disappeared, “What nation is so renowned,
to whom God draws nigh, as thou seest that he is nigh to thee?” When
therefore the Jews rendered themselves vile, the Prophet condemns them
for ingratitude. He, at the same time, shows that they were become
inhuman towards their brethren, with whom they had been united by a most
sacred bond. It then seems probable to me, that God and Abraham are
mentioned here, because God had chosen the race of Abraham and adopted
them as his people, and also, because he had deposited his covenant with
Abraham and the fathers: thus Abraham became, as it were, the mediator
of the covenant which God made with his whole race. By thus
understanding the subject of the Prophet, it is easier for us to see why
he mentions Abraham as well as God.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p9"></span>*Is there not one father*, he says, *to
us all?* that is, “Did not God select us from the rest of the world,
when he promised to our father Abraham to be a God to him and to his
seed? Since then God’s favor has flowed to us from that fountain, what
sottishness it is to break that sacred bond by which God has joined us
to himself in the person of Abraham?” For when the Jews did not consider
that they derived their origin from the holy patriarch, the consequence
was, that the covenant of God with them became void and of no effect.
This then is the reason why he says, that one God was to them all a
Father. And as other nations might have claimed the same privilege, he
adds, *Has not one God created us?* He shows that the Jews had descended
in no common or ordinary way from their holy father Abraham, but that
God was the maker of his race, that he created them. Did not he also
create the rest of the world? Not in the same manner; for this creation
ought to be confined especially to the Church. God has created the whole
human race; but he created also the race of Abraham: and hence the
Church is often called in Isaiah the work and the formation of God,
(<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p9.1"></span>[Isa
66:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p9.1"></span>,) and Paul also adopts the same mode of
speaking, (<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p9.2"></span>[Eph
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p9.2"></span>.) Our Prophet then does not mean that the
Jews had been created by God when born into this world, but that they
had become his holy and peculiar people. As then God had thus created
the Jews, and had given to them one father, that being mindful of their
origin they might remain united in true religion, the Prophet here
reprobates their sottishness in casting away from themselves this
invaluable favor of God.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p10"></span>*Every one dealt falsely with his
brother*; and thus they violated the covenant of the fathers. As to the
verb, <span id="iv.iii.xiii-p10.1"></span>נכגד, *nubegad*, it has been
variously explained by grammarians; but as to what is meant it is
agreed, that the Jews are here condemned, because they were not only
perfidious to God, but also fraudulent as to their neighbors: and thus
they doubled their perfidy, the proof which was manifest, because they
did not act with sincerity towards their brethren.  <span
id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) *Why* then, he says, *do we deal
falsely with man, that is, every one with his own brother, so that we
pollute the covenant of our fathers?* Here the covenant of the fathers
is to be taken for that separation or laying apart which we have
mentioned, by which God had adopted Abraham and his posterity, that they
might be separated from all the nations of the world. Hence under this
covenant of the fathers is God himself included; and as this has not
been perceived, it is no wonder that this passage has been so frigidly
explained, and that Malachi has been as it were wholly buried in
darkness; though interpreters have tried to bring light, yet the effect
has been to pervert the real meaning of the Prophet. But it appears now
plain, I think, that the Jews are here said to be guilty of a twofold
perfidy — because they rejected the honor offered to them by God’s
gratuitous election, and also because they acted fraudulently towards
their own brethren. It hence followed that the covenant of the fathers,
that is, what God had deposited with the patriarchs, that it might come
from hand to hand to their posterity, had been violated and made void by
their wickedness.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p14"></span>We must yet notice what I have already
referred to — that the priests are so reproved that the whole people are
also included; and this we shall again presently see, and I add also,
that the Prophet connects God with Abraham, in order to show that we
shall fail to seek God effectually, if we seek him apart from his
covenant, and also that our minds ought not to be fixed on men. There
are indeed two vices against which we ought carefully to guard. Some,
passing by all means, seek to fly upward to God; and so they entertain
many vain thoughts and devise for themselves many labyrinths, from which
they never emerge. We see how many fanatics there are at this day, who
proudly speak against God’s word, and yet touch neither heaven nor
earth; and why? because they would be superior to angels, and do not
acknowledge that they need any helps by which they might by degrees,
according to their weakness, ascend up to God himself. Now this is to
seek God without the covenant or without the word. This is the reason
why the Prophet here unites father Abraham to God himself; it was done
that the Jews might know that they were confined by certain limits, in
order that they might in humility make progress in God’s school, and be
carried by degrees into heaven: for God, as it has been said, had
deposited his covenant with Abraham. But yet as they might have depended
on a mortal man, the Prophet adds a corrective — that they had been
*created by God*; for they were not to separate their father Abraham
from the very author of the covenant.

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p15"></span>This passage then is worthy of special
notice; for men from the beginning and in all ages have been inclined to
the two vices which I have mentioned; and at this day we see that some
indulge their dreams and despise the outward preaching of the word; for
many fanatics say, that there is no need of rudiments or of the first
elements, since God has promised that the sons of the Church would be
spiritual. Hence Satan by such delusions strives to draw us away from
pure simplicity of doctrine. It is therefore necessary to set up this
shield — that God is not exhibited to us without Abraham, that is,
without a Prophet and an interpreter. The Papists are also sunk in the
same mud; for they have always the fathers in their mouths, but make no
account of God. This is also very preposterous. Let us then remember
that God is not to be separated from his word, and that the authority of
men is of no account, when they depart from it. And the Prophet confirms
the same thing at the end of the verse, when he speaks of the covenant
of the fathers; for he does not here simply commend the covenant of the
fathers, as the Turks might do, or as it is done by Papists and Jews;
but he means the covenant which God had given, and which the holy
patriarchs faithfully handed down to their posterity, according to what
Paul says in the twenty-second chapter of the Acts, when speaking of his
father’s religion; he did not speak of it as heathens might do of their
religion, but he took it as granted that the law promulgated by Moses
was not his invention, but had God as its author. It now follows-

<span id="iv.iii.xiv"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p6"></span>The Prophet now explains how the Jews
departed from the covenant of their fathers, and he exaggerates their
sin and says, that abomination was done in Israel; as though he had
said, that this perfidy was abominable. Some render the verb, <span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p6.1"></span>בגד, *begad*,  <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) transgressed, and so it is often taken
in Hebrew: but as in the last verse the Prophet had said, <span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p7.3"></span>נבגד, *nubegad*, “Why do we deal
perfidiously every one with his brother?” I doubt not but that it is
repeated here in the same sense. But as I have already stated, he shows
the crime to be detestable, and says that it existed in *Judah and in
Jerusalem*. God had indeed, as it is well known, preferred that tribe to
others; and it was not a common favor that the Jews almost alone
returned to their own country, while others nearly all remained in their
dispersions. He adds *Jerusalem*, not for honor’s sake, but for greater
reproach, as though he had said, that not only some of the race of
Abraham were subject to this condemnation, but that even the Jews were
so, who had been allowed to return to their own country, and that even
the holy city rendered itself subject to this reproof, in which the
temple was, the sanctuary of God, which was then alone the true one in
the whole world. By these circumstances then does the Prophet enhance
their crime.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p8"></span>But he immediately comes to particulars:
*Polluted*, he says, *has Judah the holiness of Jehovah, which he
loved*;  <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) that is, because they
individually indulged their lusts, and procured for themselves wives
from heathen nations.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p15"></span>Some take, <span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p15.1"></span>קדש, *kodash*, for the sanctuary or the
temple; others for the keeping of the law; but I prefer to apply it to
the covenant itself; and we might suitably take it in a collective
sense, except the simpler meaning be more approved — that Judah polluted
his separation. As to the Prophet’s object and the subject itself, he
charges them here, I have no doubt, with profanation, because the Jews
rendered themselves vile, though God had consecrated them to himself.
They had then *polluted holiness*, even when they had been separated
from the world; for they had disregarded so great an honor, by which
they might have been pre-eminent, had they continued in their integrity.
It may be also taken collectively, *they have polluted holiness*, that
is, they have polluted that nation which has been separated from other
nations: but as this exposition may seem hard and somewhat strained, I
am inclined to think that what is here meant is that separation by which
the Jews were known from other nations. But yet what I have stated may
serve to remove whatever obscurity there may be. And that this holiness
ought to be referred to that gratuitous election by which God had
adopted the Jews as his peculiar people, is evident from what the
Prophet says, that they married foreign wives.  <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md)

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p17"></span>We then see the purpose of this
passage, which is to show, — that the Jews were ungrateful to God,
because they mingled with heathen nations, and knowingly and wilfully
cast aside that glory by which God had adorned them by choosing them, as
Moses says, to be to him a royal priesthood. (<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p17.1"></span>[Ex
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p17.1"></span>.) Holiness, we know, was much recommended
to the Jews, in order that they might not abandon themselves to any of
the pollutions of the heathens. Hence God had forbidden them under the
law to take foreign wives, except they were first purified, as we find
in <span id="iv.iii.xiv-p17.2"></span>[Deut.
21:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p17.2"></span>; if any one wished to marry a captive, she
was to have her head shaven and her nails pared; by which it was
intimated, that such women were impure, and that their husbands would be
contaminated, except they were first purified. And, yet it was not
wholly a blameless thing, when one observed the law as to a captive: but
it was a lust abominable to God, when they were not content with their
own nation, and burnt in love with strange women. As however the Jews,
like all mortals without exception, were inclined to corruptions, God
purposed to keep them together as one people, lest the wife by her
flatteries should draw the husband away from the pure and legitimate
worship of God. And Moses tells us, that there was a crafty counsel
given by Balsam when he saw that the people could not be conquered in
open war; he at length invented this artifice, that the heathens should
offer to them their wives and their daughters. It hence happened that
the people provoked God’s wrath, as we find it recorded in <span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p17.3"></span>[Nu
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p17.3"></span>.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p18"></span>As then the Jews after their return had
again lapsed into this corruption, it is not without reason that the
Prophet so severely reproves them, and that he says, that by marrying
strange women they had polluted holiness, or that separation, which was
their great honor, as God had adopted them alone as his people; and he
calls it a holiness which God loved. Thus their crime was doubled,
because God had not only bound them to himself, but he had also embraced
them gratuitously. For if the cause of the separation be enquired,
whether they excelled other nations, or whether they had any worthiness
or merit? the answer is, No; but God loved them freely. For by the word
love, the Prophet means the mere kindness and bounty of God, with which
he favored Abraham and his race, without regard to any worthiness or
excellency. He therefore condemns them for this ingratitude, because
they had not only departed from the covenant which the Lord had made
with their fathers, but had also neglected and despised that gratuitous
love, which ought to have softened even their iron hearts. For if God
had found anything in them as a reason why he preferred them to other
nations, they might have been more excusable, at least they might have
extenuated their fault; but since God had adopted them as his peculiar
people, though they were unworthy and wholly undeserving, they must
surely have been extremely brutish, to have thus despised the gratuitous
favor of God. Their baseness then is increased, as I have said, by this
circumstance, — that so great a kindness of God did not turn their
hearts to obedience.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p19"></span>At the end of the verse the Prophet
makes known, as I have already stated, their profanation; they had
married the daughters *of another god*. By way of reproach he calls them
the daughters of a strange god. He might have simply said foreign
daughters; but he intended here to imply a comparison between the God of
Israel and idols: as though he had said, “Whence have these wives come
to you? from idols. Ye ought then to have hated them as monsters: had
you any religion in your heart, what but detestable to you must have
been everything which may have come from idols? but your hearts have
become attached to the daughters of false gods.”

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p20"></span>And we find that this vice had been
condemned by Moses, and branded with reproach, before the giving of the
Law, when he said, that the human race had been corrupted, because the
sons of God married the daughters of men, (<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p20.1"></span>[Ge
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p20.1"></span>,) even because the posterity of Seth, who
were born of the holy family, degraded themselves and polluted that
small portion, which was holy and consecrated to God, by mixing with the
world; for the whole world had at that time departed from God, except
the descendants of Seth. The Lord then had before the Law marked this
lust with perpetual disgrace; but when the Law itself which ought to
have been like a rampart, again condemned it, was it not a perverseness
wholly inexcusable, when the wantonness of the people broke through all
restraints? He then adds —

<span id="iv.iii.xv"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p6"></span>The Prophet here teaches us, that neither
the priests nor the people would go unpunished, because they had mingled
with the pollutions of the heathens, and profaned and violated the
covenant of God. God then says, *Cut off* (the word means to scrape off
or to blot out) *shall God the man who has done this, the mover*, or
prompter, *as well as the respondent*  <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) *Jerome* renders the last words, the
master and the disciple; and interpreters vary. Some indeed explain the
terms allegorically, and apply them to the dead; but by the mover, I
have no doubt, he understands every one who was in power, and could
command others, and by the respondent the man who was subject to the
authority of his master. The masters then prompted or roused, for it
belonged to them to command; and the servants responded, for it was
their duty to receive orders and to obey them. It is the same as though
the Prophet had said, that God would punish this perfidy, without
passing by any, so that he would spare neither the common people nor the
chief men: and he also adds the priests, intimating, that the priests
themselves would not be excepted.

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p16"></span>In short, he denounces punishment on the
Jews universally, and shows that however prevalent had this impiety
become everywhere, and that though every one thought that whatever was
commonly practiced was lawful, yet God would become an avenger, and
would include in the same punishment both the masters and the servants,
and would not exempt the priests, who considered themselves safe by
peculiar privilege. The rest tomorrow.

within the limits of thy word, and thus restrain all the desires of our
flesh; and that whatever Satan may contrive to draw us here and there,
may we continually proceed in obedience to thy word, and being mindful
of that eternal election, by which thou hast been pleased gratuitously
to adopt us, and also of that calling by which thy eternal election has
been confirmed, and by which thou hast received us in thine
only-begotten Son, may we go on in our course to the end, and so cleave,
by persevering faith, to Christ thy Son, that we may at length be
gathered into the enjoyment of that eternal kingdom which he has
purchased for us by his blood. — Amen.

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p6"></span>The Prophet amplifies again the fault
of the priests, because the people, when they perceived that God was
adverse to them, found no means of pacifying him. And when men have an
idea that God is inexorable to them, every zeal for religion must
necessarily decay; and hence it is said in <span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p6.1"></span>[Ps
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p6.1"></span> — “With thee is propitiation, that thou
mayest be feared.” As the people then gained nothing by sacrificing,
they had now nearly fallen off from divine worship. This evil, a most
grievous one, the Prophet says, was to be justly ascribed to the
priests; for as they were become polluted, how could their persons have
been accepted by God, that they might be mediators to expiate sins and
to pacify God?

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p7"></span>This is the real meaning of the
Prophet, which none of the interpreters have perceived. The Rabbins
think that the priests are here reproved, because their wives filled the
altar in the sanctuary with weeping, because they saw that their
husbands did not faithfully treat them, according to the law of
marriage; and almost all have agreed with them. Thus then they explain
the verse — *Ye have in the second place done this*; that is, “That sin
was of itself sufficiently grievous, when ye suffered lean victims to be
sacrificed to me, as it were in mockery; but in addition to this comes
your sin against your wives, who continually complain and deplore their
condition before the altar of God, even because they are not loved by
you, as the right of marriage requires.” They thus refer the tears, the
weeping, and lamentation, to the wives of the priests, which were so
cruelly treated by their husbands: they were not able to do anything
else than to fill God’s sanctuary with their constant complaints. Hence
they render, <span id="iv.iii.xviii-p7.1"></span>מאין עוד פנות, *main
oud penut*, “I will not therefore regard,” or, “no one regards;” but
both versions are not only obscure, but wholly pervert the sense of the
Prophet.

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p8"></span>But what I have already stated is the
most suitable — that it was to be ascribed to the priests that no one
could from the heart worship God, at least with a cheerful and willing
mind; for God was implacable to the people, because the only way of
obtaining favor under the law was when the priests, who represented the
Mediator, humbly entreated pardon in the name of the whole people. But
how could God attend to the prayers of the priests when they had
polluted his altar by the filth of wickedness? We then see the object of
this amplification — *Ye cover the altar of Jehovah with tears, with
weeping and wailing*. The praises of God ought to have resounded in the
temple, according to what is said —

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p9"></span>“Praise, O God, waits for thee in
Zion.” (<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p9.1"></span>[Ps
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p9.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p10"></span>And the principal sacrifice was, that
the people exercised themselves in contemplating the blessings of God,
and in thanksgiving. But he says that none went forth before the altar
with a cheerful mind, but all were sad and sorrowful, because they found
that God was severe and rigid.

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p11"></span>And the reason is added — <span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p11.1"></span>מאין עוד פנות, *main oud penut*,
literally, “Is it not any more by regarding,” etc.? It is easy to see
how far they depart from the meaning of the Prophet who read — “They
shall therefore offer no more;” for is this to be applied to God? Others
also, who give this rendering — “I shall not therefore accept,” pervert
also the very letter of the text. But the most appropriate meaning is
this — that all wept and groaned before the altar, because they saw that
they came there without any advantage, that their sacrifices did not
please God, and that the whole worship was in vain, inasmuch as God did
not answer their prayers. The Prophet ascribes the fault to the priests,
that God did not turn to mercy, so as to forgive the people when they
sacrificed. With weeping, then, he says, was the altar filled or
covered, because God received not *what pleased him from their hand*;
that is, because no victims pleased him which were offered by polluted
and impure hands.  <span id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) He afterwards

<span id="iv.iii.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.xix-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xix-p6"></span>The Prophet tells us here as before how
prone the priests were to make a clamor, and it is a very common thing
with hypocrites immediately to set up a shield to cover their vices
whenever they are reproved; and hence it appears, that men are in a
manner fascinated by Satan, when they attain such hardness as to dare to
answer God, and with obstreperous words to repel all warnings. Malachi
has several times already used this mode of speaking; we may hence
conclude, that the people had become then so hardened that warnings were
of no account with them. But he mentions one particular, by which it
seems evident that they had lapsed into vices which were not to be
borne. There is indeed no doubt but that he points out one of the many
vices which prevailed. There is then in this verse an instance of
stating one thing for the whole, as though he had said, “Your hypocrisy
is extremely gross; but, to omit other things, by what pretext can you
excuse this perfidy — that there is no conjugal fidelity among you? Were
there any integrity and a sense of religion in men, they would surely
appear in their conjugal connection; but ye have cast away all shame,
and have taken to yourselves many wives. There is then no ground for you
to think that you can escape by evasions, because this one glaring vice
sufficiently proves your guilt.” This is the import of the Prophet’s
answer.

<span id="iv.iii.xix-p7"></span>We have indeed seen that the priests
were implicated in other vices; the Prophet then does not now charge
them with perfidy as though they were free from other sins, but he meant
to show, as I have already said, by one thing, how wickedly and
shamelessly they sought to evade God’s judgment, though they had
violated the marriage pledge, which was wholly to destroy the very order
of nature; for there can be, as it has been already said, no chastity in
social life except the bond of marriage be preserved, for marriage, so
to speak, is the fountain of mankind.

<span id="iv.iii.xix-p8"></span>But in order to press the matter more on
the priests, he calls their attention to the fact that God is the
founder of marriage. *Testified has Jehovah*, he says, *between thee and
thy wife*  <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) He intimates in these
words, that when a marriage takes place between a man and a woman, God
presides and requires a mutual pledge from both. Hence Solomon, in <span
id="iv.iii.xix-p9.2"></span>[Pr
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xix-p9.2"></span>, calls marriage the covenant of God, for it
is superior to all human contracts. So also Malachi declares, that God
is as it were the stipulator, who by his authority joins the man to the
woman, and sanctions the alliance: God then has *testified between thee
and thy wife*, as though he had said, “Thou hast violated not only all
human laws, but also the compact which God himself has consecrated, and
which ought justly to be deemed more sacred than all other compacts: as
then God has testified between thee and thy wife, and thou now deceivest
her, how darest thou to come to the altar? and how canst thou think that
God will be pleased with thy sacrifices or regard thy oblations?”

<span id="iv.iii.xix-p10"></span>He calls her *the wife of his youth*,
because the more filthy is the lust when husbands cast away conjugal
love as to those wives whom they have married in their youth. The bond
of marriage is indeed in all cases inviolable, even between the old, but
it is a circumstance which increases the turpitude of the deed, when any
one alienates himself from a wife whom he married when a girl and in the
flower of her age: for youth conciliates love; and we also see that when
a husband and his wife have lived together for many years, mutual love
prevails between them to extreme old age, because their hearts were
united together in their youth. It is not then without reason that this
circumstance is mentioned, for the lust of the priests was the more
filthy and as it were the more monstrous, because they forsook wives
whom they ought to have regarded with the tenderest love, as they had
married them when they were young: *Thou hast dealt unfaithfully with
her, he says, though she was thy consort and the wife of thy covenant*

<span id="iv.iii.xix-p11"></span>He calls her a consort, or companion,
or associate,  <span id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) because marriage,
we know, is contracted on this condition — that the wife is to become as
it were the half part of the man. As then the bond of marriage is
inseparable, the Prophet here goads the priests, yea, touches them to
the quick, when he reproves them for being unmindful of what was
natural, inasmuch as they had blotted out of their minds the memory of a
most sacred covenant. The *wife of thy covenant* is to be taken for a
covenanted wife, that is, “The wife who has been united to thee by God’s
authority, that there might be no separation; but all integrity is
violated, and as it were abolished.” He then adds

<span id="iv.iii.xx"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p1"></span><span id="iv.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p2"></span>**15.** And did not he make one? Yet had
he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a
godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal
treacherously against the wife of his youth.

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p3"></span>**15.** Et non unum fecit? et exuperantia

secundae)

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.xx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p6"></span>There is in this verse some obscurity,
and hence it has been that no interpreter has come to the meaning of the
Prophet. The Rabbins almost all agree that Abraham is spoken of here.
Were we to receive this view a two-fold meaning might be given. It may
be an objection, — “Has not one done this?” that is, has not Abraham,
who is the one father of the nations, given us an example? for he
married many wives: and thus many explain the passage, as though the
priests raised an objection and defended the corruption just condemned
by the example of Abraham, — “Has not one done this while yet an
excellency of spirit was in him?” We indeed know how prone men are to
pretend the authority of fathers when they wish to cover their own
vices.

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p7"></span>Others prefer regarding the words as
spoken by the Prophet himself, and at the same time say that there is
here an anticipation of an objection, and think that an occasion for an
excuse is here cut off, as though the Prophet had said, “Did not
Abraham, when he was one alone, do this?” For as the Jews might have
adduced the example of Abraham, the interpreters, whose opinion I now
refer to, think that a difference is here stated, as though he had said,
“Ye reason badly, for every one of you is led to polygamy by the lust of
your flesh; but it was far otherwise with Abraham, for he was one, that
is, alone;” and in Isaiah Abraham is called one on account of his having
no children. The meaning then they think is this, “Was not Abraham
forced by necessity to take another wife? even because he had no child
and no hope of the promised seed. Lust then did not stimulate your
father Abraham, as it does you, but a desire of having an offspring.”
And they think, that this view is confirmed by what follows, “And why
alone seeking the seed of God?” that is, the object of holy Abraham was
far otherwise than to indulge his lust; for he sought that holy seed,
the hope of which was taken away from him on account of the barrenness
of his wife, and of her great age. When therefore Abraham saw that his
wife was barren, and that she could no more conceive on account of her
old age, he had recourse to the last remedy: hence the mistake of
Abraham might have been excused, since his object was right; for he
sought the seed of God, the seed in which all nations were to be
blessed. Thus far have I told you what others think.

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p8"></span>I thought twelve years ago that this
passage ought to have been otherwise rendered in the French Bibles, and
that, <span id="iv.iii.xx-p8.1"></span>אחד, *ached*, ought to be read in
the objective case; “Has he not made one?” *Jerome* seems to me to have
had a better notion of what the Prophet means than what others have
taught; but he could not attain the real meaning, and therefore stopped
as it were in the middle of his course. He read the word in the
nominative case, “Has not one,” that is, God, “made them? “and then he
added, “And in him alone,” that is, Abraham, “was an exuberant spirit.”
We see how he dared not to assert anything, nor did he explain what was
necessary. The sense is indeed suspended, and is even frigid, if we say,
“Has not one made them?” but if we read, “Has he not made one?”  <span
id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) there is no ambiguity. It is a common
thing in Hebrew, we know, that the name of God is often not expressed,
when he is referred to; for so great is He, that his name may be easily
understood, though not expressed. It ought not therefore to confuse us,
that the Prophet withholds the name of God, and mentions a verb without
its subject, for such is the usage, as I have said, of the Hebrew
language.

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p10"></span>I proceed now to explain the meaning of
the Prophet. *Has he not made one?* that is, Was not God content with
one man, when he instituted marriage? and *yet the residue of the Spirit
was in him*. The Rabbins take, <span id="iv.iii.xx-p10.1"></span>שאר,
*shar*, as meaning excellence; but I know not what reason have induced
them, except that they ventured to change the sense of the word, because
they could not otherwise extricate themselves; for the mistake, that
Abraham is spoken of here, had wholly possessed their minds. What then
is, <span id="iv.iii.xx-p10.2"></span>שאר רוח, *shar* *ruch*? Excellence
of Spirit, say they; but, <span id="iv.iii.xx-p10.3"></span>שאר, *shar*,
we know, is residue or remnant: what then remains of anything is called,
<span id="iv.iii.xx-p10.4"></span>שאר, *shar*; for the verb means to
remain and to lean. Here then the Prophet takes the residue of the
Spirit, so to speak, for overflowing power; for God could have given to
one man two or three wives; inasmuch as the Spirit failed him not in
forming one woman: as he inspired Eve with life, so also he might have
created other women and imparted to them his Spirit. He might then have
given two or four or ten women to one man; for there was a spirit
remaining in him. We now then understand what the Prophet means at the
beginning of this verse.

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p11"></span>But before we proceed farther, we must
bear in mind his object, which was, to break down all those frivolous
pretences by which the Jews sought to cover their perfidy. He says, that
in marriage we ought to recognize an ordinance divinely appointed, or,
to speak more distinctly, that the institution of marriage is a
perpetual law, which it is not right to violate: there is therefore no
cause for men to devise for themselves various laws, for God’s authority
is here to be regarded alone; and this is more clearly explained in
<span id="iv.iii.xx-p11.1"></span>[Mt
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xx-p11.1"></span>; where Christ, refuting the objection of
the Jews as to divorce, says, “From the beginning it was not so.” Though
the law allowed a bill of divorce to be given to wives, yet Christ
denies this to be right, — by what argument? even because the
institution was not of that kind; for it was, as it has been said, an
inviolable bond. So now our Prophet reasons, *Has not God made one?*
that is, “consider within yourselves whether God, when he created man
and instituted marriage, gave many wives to one man? By no means. Ye see
then that spurious and contrary to the character of a true and pure
marriage is everything, that does not harmonize with its first
institution.”

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p12"></span>But some one may ask here, why the
Prophet says that God made one? for this seems to refer to the man and
not to the woman: to this I answer, that man with the woman is called
one, according to what Moses says,

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p13"></span>“God created man; male and female
created he them,”  
(<span id="iv.iii.xx-p13.2"></span>[Ge
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xx-p13.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p14"></span>After having said that man was created,
he adds by way of explanation, that man, both male and female, was
created. Hence when he speaks of man, the male makes as it were
one-half, and the female the other; for when we speak of the whole human
race, one-half doubtless consists of men, and the other half of women.
So also when we come to individuals, the husband is as it were the half
of the man, and the woman is the other half. I speak of the ordinary
state of things; for if any one objects and says, that bachelors are not
then complete or perfect men, the objection is frivolous: but as men
were created, that every one should have his own wife, I say, that
husband and wife make but one whole man. This then is the reason why the
Prophet says, that one man was made by God; for he united the man to the
woman, and intended that they should be partners, so to speak, under one
yoke. And in this explanation there is nothing strained; for it is
evident that the Prophet here calls the attention of the Jews to the
true character of marriage; and this could not have been otherwise known
than from the very institution of God, which is, as we have said, a
perpetual and inviolable law; for God created man, even male and female:
and Christ also has repeated this sentence, and carefully explained it
in the passage which we have quoted.

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p15"></span>And here the Prophet sharply goads the
Jews, as though they wished to overcome God, or to be more wise than he;
*Had he not, he says, an exuberance of spirit?* He takes spirit not for
wisdom, but for that hidden influence by which God vivifies men. Could
not God, he says, have put forth his spirit to create many wives for one
man? but his purpose was to create one pair; to make man a husband and a
wife: as God then was not without a remaining Spirit, and yet did not
exceed this measure; it hence follows, that the law of marriage is
violated, when man seeks for himself many wives. The meaning of the
Prophet is now, I think, sufficiently clear.

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p16"></span>It follows, *And wherefore one*, <span
id="iv.iii.xx-p16.1"></span>ומה האחד, *vame, eached*? The interrogatory
particle, <span id="iv.iii.xx-p16.2"></span>מה, *me*, refers to the
cause, end, form, or manner; we may therefore properly render it, For
*what*, or wherefore, has God made *one*? even to *seek the seed of
God*. The seed of God is to be taken for what is legitimate; for what is
excellent is often called God in Hebrew, and also what is free from all
vice and blemish. He sought then the seed of God, that is, he instituted
marriage, that legitimate and pure offspring might be brought forth.
Hence then the Prophet indirectly shows, that all are spurious who
proceed from polygamy, because they cannot be deemed legitimate
children; nor ought any to be so counted but those who are born
according to God’s institution. When a husband violates his pledged
faith to his wife, and takes another; as he subverts the ordinance of
marriage, so he cannot be a legitimate father. We now perceive why the
Prophet says, that it was God’s purpose to unite only one wife to one
man, in order that they might beget legitimate offspring, for he shows
by the effect how frivolous were the evasions which the Jews had
recourse to; for however they might contend, their very offspring would
prove them liars, as it would be spurious.

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p17"></span>He then draws this conclusion,
Therefore, *watch ye over your spirit*; that is, “Take heed lest any
should deceive the wife of his covenant.” After having shown how
perversely they violated the marriage vow who rushed into polygamy, he
here counsels and exhorts them; and this is the best mode of teaching,
to show first what is right and lawful, and then to add exhortations.
The Prophet then endeavored first to convince the Jews that they were
guilty of a nefarious crime: for otherwise his exhortation would not
have been received, as they would have always a ready objection, “It is
lawful for us to do so, for we follow the example of our father Abraham;
and further, this has been permitted for a long time, and God would have
never suffered it, were it wrong, to prevail for so many ages among the
people: it hence follows, that thou condemnest what is lawful.” It was
necessary, in the first place, to remove all these false pretences: then
follows the exhortation in its proper order, Watch over your spirit; for
he speaks of what has been, as it were, sufficiently proved.  <span
id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) It now follows

<span id="iv.iii.xxi"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p1"></span><span
id="iv.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#016.md)<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p2"></span>**16.** For the LORD, the God of Israel,
saith that he hateth putting away: for *one* covereth violence with his
garment, saith the LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit,
that ye deal not treacherously.

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p3"></span>**16.** Si odio habeas (quisque odio
habet,) dimittat (i.e., uxorem) dicit Iehovah Deus Israel; et operit,
(vel, texit) violentiam sub vestimento suo, dicit Iehovah exercituum:
ergo custodiamini in spiritu vestro et ne fraudetis.

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.xxi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p6"></span>Here again the Prophet exaggerates the
crime which the priests regarded as nothing; for he says, that they
sinned more grievously than if they had repudiated their wives. We
indeed know that repudiation, properly speaking, had never been allowed
by God; for though it was not punished under the law, yet it was not
permitted.  <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) It was the same as
with a magistrate, who is constrained to bear many things which he does
not approve; for we cannot so deal with mankind as to restrain all
vices. It is indeed desirable, that no vice should be tolerated; but we
must have a regard to what is possible. Hence Moses has specified no
punishment, according to the heinousness of the crime, if one repudiated
his wife; and yet it was never permitted.

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p8"></span>But if a comparison be made, Malachi
says, that it is a lighter crime to dismiss a wife than to marry many
wives. We hence learn how abominable polygamy is in the sight of God. I
do not consider polygamy to be what the foolish Papists have made it,
who call not those polygamists who have many wives at the same time, but
those who marry another when the former one is dead. This is gross
ignorance. Polygamy, properly so called, is when a person takes many
wives, as it was commonly done in the East: and those nations, we know,
have always been libidinous, and never observe the marriage vow. As then
their lasciviousness was so great that they were like brute beasts,
every one married several wives; and this abuse continues at this day
among the Turks and the Persian and other nations. Here, however, where
God compares polygamy with divorce, he says that polygamy is the worse
and more detestable crime; for the husband impurely connects himself
with another woman, and then, not only deals unfaithfully with his wife
to whom he is bound, but also forcibly detains her: thus his crime is
doubled. For if he replies and says that he keeps the wife to whom he is
bound, he is yet an adulterer as to the second wife: thus he blends, as
they say, holy with profane things; and then to adultery and
lasciviousness he adds cruelty, for he holds under his authority a
miserable woman, who would prefer death to such a condition; for we know
what power jealousy has over women. And when any one introduces a
harlot, how can a lawful wife bear such an indignity without being
miserably tormented?

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p9"></span>This then is the reason why the Prophet
now says, *If thou hatest, dismiss*; not that he grants indulgence to
divorce, as we have said, but that he might by this circumstance enhance
the crime; and hence he adds, *For he covers by a cloak his violence*.
Some interpreters take violence here for spoil or prey, and think that
the wife is thus called who is tyrannically compelled to remain with an
adulterer, when yet she sees a harlot in her house, by whom she is
driven from her conjugal bed: but this is too strained and too remote
from the letter of the text. The Prophet here, I doubt not, shakes off
from the Jews their false mask, because they thought that they could
cover over their vice by retaining their first wives. “What else is
this,” he says, “but to cover by a cloak your violence, or at least to
excuse it? for ye do not openly manifest it: but God is not deceived,
nor can his eye be dazzled by such a disguise: though then your iniquity
is covered by a cloak, it is not yet hid from God; nay, it is thus
doubled, because ye exercise your cruelty at home; for it would be
better for robbers to remain in the wood and there to kill strangers,
than to entice guests to their houses and to kill them there and to
plunder them under the pretext of hospitality. This is the way in which
you act; for ye destroy the bond of marriage, and ye afterwards deceive
your miserable wives, and yet ye force them by your tyranny to continue
at your houses, and thus ye torment your miserable wives, who might have
enjoyed their freedom, if divorce had been granted them.”  <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md)

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p15"></span>He concludes again with these words,
*Watch over your spirit*; that is, “Take heed; for this is an
intolerable wickedness before God, however you may endeavor to extenuate
its heinousness.”

<span id="iv.iii.xxii"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="iv.iii.xxii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that though we
daily in various ways violate the covenant which thou hast been pleased
to make with us in thine only-begotten Son, we may not yet be dealt with
according to what our defection, yea, the many defections by which we
daily provoke thy wrath against us, do fully deserve; but suffer and
bear with us kindly, and at the same time strengthen us that we may
persevere in the truth and perform to the end the pledge we have given
to thee, and which thou midst require from us in our baptism, and that
we may each of us so conduct ourselves towards our brethren, and
husbands towards their wives, that we may cherish that unity of spirit
which thou hast consecrated between us by the blood of thine own Son. —
Amen.

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p6"></span>The Prophet here reproves the Jews who
expostulated with God in their adversity, as though he had undeservedly
forsaken them, and had not brought them immediate help. Thus are
hypocrites wont to do; unless God immediately assists them, they not
only indirectly complain, but also break out into open blasphemies; for
they think that God is bound to them, and hence they assail him more
boldly, and even with greater freedom and insolence. It is indeed a
proof of true piety when we patiently submit to the judgments of God,
and when, as Jeremiah teaches us by his own example,

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p7"></span>“we sustain his wrath, because we know
that we have sinned.” (<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p7.1"></span>[Jer
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p7.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p8"></span>But as hypocrites are conscious of
nothing wrong, (for they flatter themselves, and stupify their own
consciences,) because they examine not themselves, they think that God
acts unjustly towards them when he does not immediately bring them aid.
Such was the dishonesty of the people of whom the Prophet now speaks.

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p9"></span>He says that they had *wearied* God,
that is, that they had been troublesome to him by their clamorous
complaints; for the verb, <span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p9.1"></span>יגע, *igo*,
means to be weary; he says then that they unreasonably complained of
God’s slowness. It is indeed a mode of speaking taken from men, for we
know that no passions belong to God; but as elsewhere God reproves them
because they saddened his Spirit, (<span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p9.2"></span>[Ps
106:33](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#033.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p9.2"></span>,) so he says here that they *wearied* him.
We now perceive the Prophet’s meaning.

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p10"></span>But there is a dilemma presented in
the words; for the Jews thought that God favored the wicked, inasmuch as
he did not immediately punish them, or that he was now unlike himself,
and forgot his own nature. The difficulty or the dilemma appears not at
the first view, as they seemed to have repeated the same thing. But in
the first clause they accuse God of injustice; and in the second they
intimate that there is no God, for he cannot exist without exercising
judgment. Then the passages contains two clauses differing from each
other — “God has either changed his nature, and so is no God, or he
favors our enemies; for he does not immediately execute vengeance.” We
see then that they concluded that God either acted unjustly, or that
there was no God. But we have mentioned the cause of this blasphemy —
the Jews did not examine themselves, and therefore did not confess that
they deserved these chastisements. They were like vicious horses, who
kick and fling, though gently treated by their riders.

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p11"></span>But such insolence is now seen in all
masked men, who vauntingly profess religion when they are treated
according to their own wishes; but when God deals more sharply with
them, they not only murmur, but vomit forth, as I have already said,
impious slanders against him, as though he did not render to them the
reward due to their just dealings. Admonished by this example, let us
learn that it is true wisdom to humble ourselves under the mighty hand
of God, (<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p11.1"></span>[1Pe
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p11.1"></span>;) and that though he may suspend the
granting of our prayers, we ought still to bear, not impatiently, what
is hard and severe, and also to subdue our feelings, and to seek from
them the Spirit of meekness, to retain us in a tranquil submission.

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p12"></span>He says that they still replied — *In
what have we wearied thee?*  <span id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md)
Here he strongly reproves their hardness, because they did not become
wise through the rebuke given them, but regarded with scorn the words of
the Prophet, by which we clearly see that they must have been convinced
of their guilt, had they not been doubly stupid. It was an intolerable
reproach cast on God, to say that he favored the ungodly, and was
pleased with their crimes; for God would thus not only rule as a tyrant,
but also subvert all order. But nothing is more contrary to his nature
than to hold forth his hand to the ungodly as though he had an alliance
with them. As this then was an evident impiety, it was a monstrous
stupidity to ask in what they wearied God; they ought indeed to have
known that he regards nothing as precious as his own honor; and yet, as
though Malachi had unjustly reproved them, they opposed him with an iron
front, according to similar instances which we have before observed; for
though they were covenant-breakers as to marriage, though they defrauded
God in the tenths, though they cunningly evaded the Prophets, they yet
as it were wiped their mouths and asked, In what had they sinned? The
Prophet shows that they were become so hardened in their contumacy that
they daringly rejected all admonitions; for they did not ask this as
though it was a doubtful thing, nor can it be concluded from their words
that they were teachable; but it was the same as if they were armed,
ready for a contest, yea, armed with effrontery and perverseness; for
they no doubt despised and ridiculed the Prophet’s reproof.

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p14"></span>He then answers them — *When ye say,
Whosoever doeth evil is acceptable in the eyes of Jehovah, and in them
he delights*. The word rendered “acceptable” is <span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p14.1"></span>טוב, *thub*; but such is its meaning often
in Hebrew.  <span id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) What they said was,
that the ungodly and the wicked pleased God, even because they covered
by false colors their sins, so that they were not convinced of anything
wrong. They then imputed whatever was evil to their enemies; they did
not commonly expostulate with God because he left sins unpunished, but
because they received not his aid. We hence see that the Jews here did
not clamor and contend with God through hatred of wickedness, but had
only a regard to their own advantages; nor did they condemn the sins of
others, except those by which they received some harm or loss, and that
they considered none wicked except those by whom they were injured. We
hence learn that they did not complain through zeal for what was right,
but because they would have God bound to them to undertake their cause
like earthly patrons.

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p20"></span>We indeed know that even the godly are
sometimes wearied, and their faith is ready to fail, when things in the
world are in a disturbed and confused state: and this was the case with
David, as it is recorded in the seventy-third Psalm; but there is in the
servants and sincere worshipers of God some concern for what is just and
right, whenever they have such grief and trouble of mind, according to
the case of Habakkuk, when he said,

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p21"></span>“How long, O Lord!” (<span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p21.1"></span>[Hab
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p21.1"></span>;)

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p22"></span>for no doubt his complaint arose from
a right principle, because his desire was that God should be truly
served in the world. But there was nothing of this kind in the Jews,
with whom our Prophet contends here; for as we have said, there was no
hatred of wickedness, but only a care for their own advantage; they
hence said, that the ungodly pleased God, because God did not
immediately interpose when they apprehended some trouble from their
enemies.

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p23"></span>The repetition is a proof of greater
bitterness; for they were not content with one clamorous expression, but
added, that God took delight in them.

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p24"></span>Then follows the other clause, *or
where is the God of judgment?*  <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md)
They seem not here to reason amiss, that is, from the nature of God. Men
may change their counsel and their design, and remain men still, for
they are subject to inconstancy and fickleness; but to God there belongs
no change. There seems not then to be an impropriety in this — that
there is no God, except he be the judge of the world; for he cannot
divest himself of his office without denying himself. But they
malignantly impeached God; nay, they now insinuate that there is none,
because he had abdicated his judgment; for they took it as granted, that
God had ceased to be the punisher of wickedness, which was most false;
but yet they thought that according to facts it was certain and clear.
Hence they concluded that there was no God, as his divinity must have
been abolished together with his judgment. We hence see to what extent
of insolence they burst forth in their complaints, so that they either
charged God with injustice, or alleged that his divinity was
annihilated. Now follows

<span id="iv.iii.i-p14"></span> It is “your blessing” in one MS., in the
*Septuagint*, the *Targum*, and *Arabic*; and this reading is confirmed
by “it” in the next line. By “blessing,” says *Newcome*, “is meant the
portion of the priests:” and as the priests are especially addressed,
this is probable. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_213"></span>[214](cc30021.htm#fr_213.md) <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p7"></span> The word <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p7.1"></span>זרע, means “the shoulder” as well as “seed,”
and it is so rendered by the *Septuagint*, and the *Arabic*, and also by
*Grotius* and *Newcome*, —

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p8"></span>Behold, I will withhold from you the
shoulder.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p9"></span>The shoulder belonged to the priests, see
<span id="iv.iii.ii-p9.1"></span>[Le
7:32](../../../bib/kjv/lev007.htm#032.md)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p9.1"></span>;
<span id="iv.iii.ii-p9.2"></span>[De
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003.md)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p9.2"></span>.
This rendering suits the context better than the other. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_214"></span>[215](cc30021.htm#fr_214.md) <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p14"></span> Participles and vers are often
connected by “and” in Hebrew, and so in Welsh; but then the auxiliary is
understood. Such is the case here, and the *Septuagint* have so regarded
it, “<span id="iv.iii.ii-p14.1"></span>καὶ λήψομαι ὑμας εἰς το <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p14.2"></span>ὰυ᾿τό — and I will take you to the same.” —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_215"></span>[216](cc30021.htm#fr_215.md) <span
id="iv.iii.iii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p14"></span> That any covenant may remain with
Levi. — *Newcome*. This seems to be the sense. He sent “this command,”
or this message, as <span id="iv.iii.iii-p14.1"></span>מצוה may be
rendered here, in order that by reforming his sons his covenant might
remain in force, for disobedience on their part would abrogate it, as it
was a conditional covenant. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_216"></span>[217](cc30021.htm#fr_216.md) <span
id="iv.iii.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p8"></span> That we may understand these terms we
must have recourse to the case evidently alluded to, that of Phinehas,
in <span id="iv.iii.iv-p8.1"></span>[Num.
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.iii.iv-p8.1"></span>.
God promised to him the covenant of peace and of perpetual priesthood—of
peace, that is, of reconcilement, because God through the zeal displayed
by Phinehas became reconciled to the children of Israel — and of
perpetuity as to the priesthood, signified here by life or “lives,” as
the word is plural. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_217"></span>[218](cc30021.htm#fr_217.md) <span
id="iv.iii.vi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p4"></span> *Calvin’s* copy must have had the verb
to “give” without the affix <span id="iv.iii.vi-p4.1"></span>ם, as it is
in two MS., and according to the *Septuagint*, the *Targum*, and the
*Arabic*. But even in this case the meaning gien can hardly be defended:
for <span id="iv.iii.vi-p4.2"></span>מורא, which occurs elsewhere about
eleven times, has not the sense here assigned to it. It means fear in
the sense of dread or terror, the fear which arises from the
apprehension of displeasure or wrath, the fear which a servant has for
his master, as in 1:6, where this very word occurs. The idea expressed
by *Calvin* is the same with that of the *Targum*, and adopted also by
*Grotius*; and the meaning given is, “the doctrine of the law.” But that
it means fear here, the fear of majesty and the fear of wrath, is
evident from the whole context. The subject at the end of the last
chapter is the fear inspired by God’s greatness, and the conclusion of
this verse is sufficiently express.

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p5"></span>The <span id="iv.iii.vi-p5.1"></span>ם
after the verb “gave” is no doubt the right reading, as it exists in all
MS., except two. Then comes the difficulty of construction. There is one
MS. which has <span id="iv.iii.vi-p5.2"></span>ב before “fear,” and the
*Septuagint* have <span id="iv.iii.vi-p5.3"></span>επι, *for*, or, *on
account of*, before it. This removes the difficulty, and the meaning
will be found consistent with the facts of the case alluded to, and with
the general tenor of this passage. The verse then would run this—

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p6"></span>**5.** My covenant with him was that of
life and peace, And I gave them to him on account of *his* fear; For he
feared me, And at the presence of my name he was terrified.

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p7"></span>The last verb is the Niphil of <span
id="iv.iii.vi-p7.1"></span>חת, which means to break, and to be broken,
and hence to be broken in mind by fear and dread, to be dismayed or
terrified. “Dismayed” is the rendering *Newcome*, and “stood in awe” is
that of *Henderson*. It is rendered “discouraged” in <span
id="iv.iii.vi-p7.2"></span>[De
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#021.md)<span id="iv.iii.vi-p7.2"></span>,
but it ought to be “terrified” or “dismayed,” as in <span
id="iv.iii.vi-p7.3"></span>[Jer
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#017.md)<span id="iv.iii.vi-p7.3"></span>;
<span id="iv.iii.vi-p7.4"></span>[Ezek.
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze002.htm#006.md), [Ezek.
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.iii.vi-p7.4"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p8"></span>“At the presence of my name,” seems to
mean the same thing as “at my presence.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_218"></span>[219](cc30021.htm#fr_218.md) <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p9.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p10"></span> “The fear of God,” says *Cocceius*,
“which was in the first priests, is more fully declared by its effects,
which are twofold—sayings and doings. The doctrine of truth was in their
mouth; they taught the truth, they were not silent, but sincerely taught
it, without admiring what was false; for what is false is injustice, and
it is the truth set forth either in a perverted form, or by addition, or
by diminution. As to doings, they walked in peace, they did not rebel
against God, nor did they seek devious and crooked ways, but walked in a
strait course.”

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p11"></span>The word <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p11.1"></span>עולה is rendered “unrighteousness, or,
injustice — <span id="iv.iii.vii-p11.2"></span>ἀδικία,” by the
*Septuagint* and the *Targum*, — “<span
id="iv.iii.vii-p11.3"></span>falsitas, falseness,” by *Drusius*, — and
“iniquity” by many. There being no agreement in gender between it and
the verb “formed,” *Marckius* suggests that <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p11.4"></span>דבר is understood, “the word of iniquity,”
etc. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_219"></span>[220](cc30021.htm#fr_219.md) <span
id="iv.iii.viii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p7"></span> The verbs, as here rendered, are
future: but being preceded by <span id="iv.iii.viii-p7.1"></span>כי,
many consider them as declaring what *ought* to be: and they are thus
rendered by *Drusius*, *Dathius*, *Newcome*, and *Henderson*, “should
keep,” or “ought to keep,” etc. We find the future thus used when
preceded by <span id="iv.iii.viii-p7.2"></span>ה, “whether,” in <span
id="iv.iii.viii-p7.3"></span>[Eze
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.viii-p7.3"></span>; and when preceded by no particle, as in
<span id="iv.iii.viii-p7.4"></span>[Mal
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.viii-p7.4"></span>, where the version ought clearly to be, —

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p8"></span>A son should honor a father,  
And a servant, his Lord.

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p9"></span>This use of the future, as designating
a duty or obligation, is much more frequent in Hebrew than what is
commonly supposed. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_220"></span>[221](cc30021.htm#fr_220.md) <span
id="iv.iii.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p8"></span> “At the law” is our version, and that of
*Newcome*, who adds, “By offering blemished sacrifices.” *Henderson* has
“in the law.” They departed from the *way* prescribed in the law, and
caused others to fall or stumble in it, that is, in the way which the
law pointed out. The way, says *Drusius*, is the law itself. To stumble
in the law is to transgress it.

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p9"></span>For “causing to stumble,” the
*Septuagint* have “ye have weakened—<span
id="iv.iii.ix-p9.1"></span>ησθενήσατε;” *Sym*. and *Theodoret,* “ye have
caused to stumble — <span id="iv.iii.ix-p9.2"></span>εσκανδαλίσατε;” and
so the *Vulgate* *Dathius* gives this paraphrase — “ye have caused many
to sin against the law.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_221"></span>[222](cc30021.htm#fr_221.md) <span
id="iv.iii.x-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.x-p21"></span> The verb means to corrupt, and also to
destroy or to make void. The *Septuagint* give the first meaning, “ye
have corrupted — <span id="iv.iii.x-p21.1"></span>διεφθείρατε,” and
*Jerome* the second, “ye have made void — <span
id="iv.iii.x-p21.2"></span>irritum fecistis.” *Marckius* and *Henderson*
have the first word, and *Newcome* the second, which is more suitable
when applied to a covenant, though not when applied to “ways.” To “make
void,” is also the most appropriate when it refers to wisdom, as in
<span id="iv.iii.x-p21.3"></span>[Eze
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.iii.x-p21.3"></span>.
— *Ed.*

<span id="fn_222"></span>[223](cc30021.htm#fr_222.md) <span
id="iv.iii.x-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.x-p23"></span> Striking and remarkable are the words of
*Adam Clarke* on this verse, “See what happened to the truly abominable
priesthood of France and Rome, 1796-8. They were the sole cause of that
infidelity that brought to supply by grimace, paltry superstition, and
jesuitical cunning, what they want in purity of morals, soundness of
doctrine, and unction from God. *They must mend, or look for another
revolution*.”

<span id="fn_223"></span>[224](cc30021.htm#fr_223.md) <span
id="iv.iii.x-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.x-p24"></span> “Having one decision for the poor and
another for the rich. See <span id="iv.iii.x-p24.1"></span>Leviticus
29:15<span id="iv.iii.x-p24.1"></span>.” — *Newcome*; or, as *Jerome*
says, “Despising the just when poor, and honoring the unjust when rich.”
— *Ed.*

<span id="fn_224"></span>[225](cc30021.htm#fr_224.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p8"></span> This is the view taken by
most—*Jerome*, *Theodoret*, *Drusius*, *Grotius*, *Marckius*, and
*Henry*. *Henderson* has been led astray by a supposed parallelism
between this and the next sentence; and he regards God to be meant.
*Scott* has taken it in both views, but this is not to explain the
passage. Indeed the very argument here used renders it necessary that
Abraham, or Isaac, or Jacob, should be intended. Taking God to be meant
by “father,” some have been led to think that it is the language of the
Jews who married strange wives, in their own defense, “Have we not all,
Gentiles as well as Jews, one Father? and has not the same God created
me?” This might do well until we come to the conclusion of the verse,
where the violation of the *covenant* of the fathers is mentioned. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_225"></span>[226](cc30021.htm#fr_225.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p10.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p11"></span> The word <span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p11.1"></span>בגד, as a noun, which is its root, means a
robe, a cloak, or a covering; when used as a verb, it signifies to cover
or cloak things over, and so to act falsely, hypocritically, or
treacherously. *Drusius*’ definition is, to act perfidiously, to
prevaricate, to deceive. It is rendered here improperly by the
*Septuagint* “<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p11.2"></span>εγκατελίπετε — ye have
forsaken.” It is here in the future tense, and may be rendered as though
it were in the subjunctive mood, —

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p12"></span>Why should we act perfidiously, each
one with his brother,  
By violating the covenant of our fathers?

<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p13"></span>“Violating” is <span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.1"></span>חלל, which means to perforate, to pierce,
and to break in, so as to violate a holy place, and hence to profane;
and so it is rendered by the *Septuagint*—<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.2"></span>του βεβηλωσαι. To profane one’s word in
<span id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.3"></span>[Nu
30:2](../../../bib/kjv/num030.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.3"></span>, is to break it; and to profane a
covenant in <span id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.4"></span>[Ps
55:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.4"></span>, is to break it; and so it is rendered in
both these places in our version. To *break* a covenant is a metaphor
not very unlike that of *piercing* or *perforating* it. *Newcome* says
that it refers to the ancient mode of cancelling bonds, which was done
by striking a nail through them. See <span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.5"></span>[Col
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiii-p13.5"></span>. “Hence the word,” he adds, “signifies to
*make void*.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_226"></span>[227](cc30021.htm#fr_226.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p7"></span> It is <span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p7.1"></span>בגדה in the feminine gender, because by
Judah is meant the tribe or the family; so Ephraim is often regarded.
See <span id="iv.iii.xiv-p7.2"></span>[Hos.
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md), [Hos.

9:13](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p7.2"></span>. We find here Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem
mentioned; and probably because the purpose was to include the whole of
the people, as some of Israel or of the ten tribes were among them. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_227"></span>[228](cc30021.htm#fr_227.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p9"></span> This last clause has been variously
explained: “whom,” *i.e.*, Judah, “he loved,” or, “which,” *i.e.,*
holiness, “he loved,” or, “which he,” Judah “had loved.” The last seems
the most natural construction according to the tenor of the passage, if
<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p9.1"></span>אשר be a relative; for Judah is the
subject in the sentence. Judah did in former times love and delight in
that separating which God had made and appointed between his people and
the heathen world. To say that God loved it seems an odd idea; but to
say that Judah delighted in it was much to the purpose, and added it for
the sake of enhancing the guilt of that generation.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p10"></span>*Dathius* gives this version, —

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p11"></span>For he profanes Judah, the holiness of
Jehovah, Who loves and marries a foreign wife.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p12"></span>But more suitable to the genius of the
language would be this, —

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p13"></span>For profaned has Judah the holiness of
Jehovah, Because he has loved and married The daughter of a strange God.

<span id="iv.iii.xiv-p14"></span>The word <span
id="iv.iii.xiv-p14.1"></span>אשר is often a conjunction as well as a
relative; *because*, *for*, *inasmuch* *as*. See <span

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p7"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p8"></span>*Him that teacheth and him that
answereth.*—Newcome

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p9"></span>*or*,

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p10"></span>*Him that passeth out and him that

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p11"></span>*Him that watcheth and him that

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p12"></span>*The teacher and the scholar.*—Drusius
*and* Grotius

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p13"></span>The most literal rendering is, —

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p14"></span>The rouser and the respondent, <span
id="iv.iii.xv-p14.1"></span>ער ועגה

<span id="iv.iii.xv-p15"></span>It seems to mean the leader in the
faction and his assistant, the bold answer of his wickedness and his
timid follower. Such we find to be in all factions. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_230"></span>[231](cc30021.htm#fr_230.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p11.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p12"></span> It is not easy to give a version of
this verse. *Henderson* renders the first line thus —

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p13"></span>And this ye have done the second
time.

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p14"></span>The reference is, he says, to the
repetition of the evil which had been corrected under <span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p14.1"></span>[Ezra
9](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#000.md)<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p14.1"></span>
and 10. This seems probable; but we may view this “second,” or again,
with regard to the previous denunciations. What are regarded as verbs in
the infinitive mood are in my view participial nouns; the last, <span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p14.2"></span>לקחת, is evidently so. Then the literal
rendering would be this—

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p15"></span>And this again ye do — Covering with
tears the altar, Weeping and groaning, Because *there* is no more
turning to the offering, Or the receiving of what is acceptable from
your hand.

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p16"></span>That <span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p16.1"></span>מאין is to be rendered “because not,” or,
“inasmuch as not,” is evident from other places. See <span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p16.2"></span>[Jer.
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#006.md), [Jer.
19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p16.2"></span>. “Turning” signifies having a regard to.
“What is acceptable,” <span id="iv.iii.xviii-p16.3"></span>רצון, is
rendered “<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p16.4"></span>δεκτον — acceptable,” in
the *Septuagint*; “<span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p16.5"></span>ἑυδοκίαν—good-will,” by *Aq.;* “<span
id="iv.iii.xviii-p16.6"></span>τὸ ευδοκημένον — what is approved,” by
*Sym*.; “<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p16.7"></span>τέλαιον — perfect,” by
*Theodoret*

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p17"></span>The difference between *Calvin* and
most expositors after him, as well as before him, is, that he regarded
the lamentation to have been by the priests and people, and they by the
repudiated wives. The cause of the weeping, as stated here, was the
rejection of the offerings, as declared by the Prophet; and this seems
enough to confirm *Calvin’s* view.

<span id="iv.iii.xviii-p18"></span>The priests and people had been
denounced for their wickedness, especially for marrying strange wives.
After this denunciation they “again” went to the altar and wept because
God would not receive their sacrifices; and they did this without
amending their ways. Then in the next verse the Prophet explains why God
would not receive their offerings. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_231"></span>[232](cc30021.htm#fr_231.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xix-p9"></span> Or, “a witness has Jehovah been between
thee and thy wife.” But *Theodoret*, *Cyril*, and *Jerome*, and also
*Cocceius*, refer this to God’s testimony in the first institution of
marriage, in <span id="iv.iii.xix-p9.1"></span>[Ge
2:24](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xix-p9.1"></span>. More suitabele to the context no doubt is
to consider God as a witness to the marriage contract; and this is the
view taken by *Drusius*, *Henry*, *Scott*, *Newcome*, and *Henderson*. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_232"></span>[233](cc30021.htm#fr_232.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xix-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xix-p12"></span> “<span
id="iv.iii.xix-p12.1"></span>Κοινωνός — partner,” by the *Septuagint*;
“<span id="iv.iii.xix-p12.2"></span>ὁμόσαρκος — of the same flesh,” by
*Cyril*; “<span id="iv.iii.xix-p12.3"></span>particeps — partner,” by
*Jerome*; “companion,” in our version, and by *Newcome* and *Henderson*.
The word comes from <span id="iv.iii.xix-p12.4"></span>חבר, to conjoin,
to couple, to fit together. “Partner” perhaps would be the most
appropriate term. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_233"></span>[234](cc30021.htm#fr_233.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xx-p8.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p9"></span> The position of the words shows that it
is a question, for there is no interrogative particle. So it is in our
language, “Has he not made one?” And that it is a question, is evident
from what follows, “and by one?” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_234"></span>[235](cc30021.htm#fr_234.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xx-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xx-p18"></span> This is the most lucid and satisfactory
explanation of a text which has been deemed, and is still deemed by
some, difficult. Some moderns have gone back to the track of the
ancients, but needlessly. *Newcome*’s attempt at a revision of the text
is wholly useless, and renders the passage more abstruse. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_235"></span>[236](cc30021.htm#fr_235.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xxi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p7"></span> This is not strictly correct, see <span
id="iv.iii.xxi-p7.1"></span>[De
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxi-p7.1"></span>; and our Savior allows that Moses
“suffered” the Israelites to put away their wives, though he says that
is was for the hardness of their hearts. See <span
id="iv.iii.xxi-p7.2"></span>[Mt
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxi-p7.2"></span>. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_236"></span>[237](cc30021.htm#fr_236.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xxi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p10"></span> The interpretation given of the first
clause of this verse is according to the *Septuagint* and the *Targum*,
and has been adopted by *Cyril*, *Jerome*, *Theodoret*, *Drusius*,
*Grotius*, *Dathius*, and others. Our version is derived from *Jun*. and
*Trem.,* and *Piscator*, and has been followed by *Marckius*, *Lowth*,
*Scott*, *Adam Clarke*, *Newcome*, and *Henderson*. The second clause
has been variously interpreted both by the ancients and the moderns. The
*Septuagint* make “violence,” or wrong, the nominative to “cover,” and
the *Targum* the accusative. “Iniquity shall cover his garment,” is the
version of *Jerome*. “For he covers violence *as* with his garments,”
has been the version of others; which corresponds with the *Targum*, as
the former does with the *Septuagint*.

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p11"></span>The most natural construction of the
first part is no doubt what our version exhibits; the meaning of the
second is less obvious: but they seem connected. What seems to be said
is, — that God hates the divorcer, and him also who maltreats his wife
without divorcing her. Then we may give this literal rendering, —

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p12"></span>For he hates the divorcer, (or him who
puts away,) Saith Jehovah, the God of Israel; And the coverer of outrage
on his own garment, Saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p13"></span>To speak of God here in the third
person is in accordance with the preceding verses. “His own garment,”
according to *Venema*, *Dathius*, and *Henderson*, is a figurative
designation of a wife. See <span id="iv.iii.xxi-p13.1"></span>[Ru
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/rut003.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxi-p13.1"></span>; <span id="iv.iii.xxi-p13.2"></span>[Eze
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#008.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxi-p13.2"></span>.

<span id="iv.iii.xxi-p14"></span>The condemning of divorce is more
suitable to this place, than any reference to its permission; because in
the previous part the allusion is evidently made to the first
institution of marriage, and not to any posterior modification. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_237"></span>[238](cc30021.htm#fr_237.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p13"></span> There is a stronger word employed by
the *Septuagint* — “<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p13.1"></span>παρωξύναμεν —
have we irritated, *or*, provoked.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_238"></span>[239](cc30021.htm#fr_238.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p14.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p15"></span> Some have contended that from the
order in which the words occur, the rendering ought to be as follows —

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p16"></span>Whosoever makes evil good in the eyes
of Jehovah, Even in them he delights. (See <span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p16.1"></span>[Isa
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p16.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p17"></span>The *Septuagint* favor this version,
as the word for “good,” <span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p17.1"></span>καλον, is in
the accusative case. But the usual rendering is the best—

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p18"></span>Every doer of evil *is* good
(approved) in the eyes of Jehovah, And in them he delights.

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p19"></span>*Cocceius* observes on these words —
“None are so impiously bold as actually to express such words, but
Scripture is wont to ascribe to the wicked such expressions as are
suitable to their character.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_239"></span>[240](cc30021.htm#fr_239.md) <span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.xxiv-p25"></span> “The God of righteousness — <span
id="iv.iii.xxiv-p25.1"></span>δικαιοσύνης,” is the version of the
*Septuagint*. — *Ed.*
