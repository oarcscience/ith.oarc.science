<span id="iv.ii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="iv.ii.i"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.i-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.ii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.i-p2"></span>**1.** The burden of the word of the LORD
to Israel by Malachi.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Onus sermonis Iehovae ad Israel in
manu Maleachi.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.ii.i-p5"></span><span id="iv.ii.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.i-p6"></span>They who explain <span
id="iv.ii.i-p6.1"></span>משא, *mesha*, burden, as signifying prophecy,
without exception, are mistaken, as I have elsewhere reminded you; for
prophecy is not everywhere called a burden; and whenever this word is
expressed, there is ever to be understood some judgment of God; and it
appears evident from <span id="iv.ii.i-p6.2"></span>[Jer
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#038.md)<span id="iv.ii.i-p6.2"></span>,
that this word was regarded as ominous, so that the ungodly, when they
wished to brand the Prophets with some mark of reproach, used this as a
common proverb, “It is a burden,” intimating thereby that nothing else
was brought by the Prophets but threatenings and terrors, in order that
they might have some excuse for closing their ears, and for evading all
prophecies by giving them an unhappy and ominous name.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p7"></span>As we proceed it will become evident that
the doctrine of Malachi is not without reason called a Burden; for as I
have stated in part, and as it will be more fully seen hereafter, it was
necessary that the people should be summoned before God’s tribunal,
inasmuch as many sins had again begun to prevail among them, and such as
could not be endured: and for this reason he says that God’s judgment
was at hand.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p8"></span>But under the name of *Israel* he refers
only to those who had returned to their own country, whether they were
of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, or of the tribe of Levi. It is
nevertheless probable that there were also some mixed with them from the
other tribes: but the Jews and their neighbors, the half tribe of
Benjamin, had almost alone returned to their country, with the exception
of the Levites, who had been their guides in their journey, and
encouraged the rest of the people. They were yet called Israel
indiscriminately, since among them only pure religion continued: but
they who remained dispersed among foreign and heathen nations, had as it
were lost their name, though they had not wholly departed from the pure
worship of God and true religion. Hence, by way of excellency, they were
called Israel, who had again assembled in the holy land, that they might
there enjoy the inheritance promised them from above.

<span id="iv.ii.i-p9"></span>The word *hand*, as we have observed
elsewhere, means ministration. The meaning then is, that this doctrine
proceeded from God, but that a minister, even Malachi, was employed as
an instrument; so that he brought nothing as his own, but only related
faithfully what had been committed to him by God from whom it came. It
then follows —

<span id="iv.ii.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
1:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p2"></span>**2.** I have loved you, saith the LORD.
Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? *Was* not Esau Jacob’s brother?
Saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p3"></span>**2.** Dilexi vos, dicit Jehovah; et
dixistis, In quo dilexisti nos? Annon frater Esau erat ipsi Jacob? dicit
Jehova; et dilexi Jacob,

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p4"></span>**3.** And I hated Esau, and laid his
mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p5"></span>**3.** Et Esau odio habui; et posui montes
ejus solitudinem, et haereditatem ejus serpentibus desertum (alii
vertunt, deserti.)

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p6"></span>**4.** Whereas Edom saith, We are
impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus
saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and
they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against
whom the LORD has indignation for ever.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p7"></span>**4.** Si dixerit Edom, Attenuati sumus,
sed revertemur, et aedificabimus deserta: sic dicit Iehova exercituum,
Ipsi aedificabunt, et ego diruam; et dicetur illis, Terminus impietatis
et populus cui infensus est Iehova in perpetuum.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p8"></span>**5.** And your eyes shall see, and ye
shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p9"></span>**5.** Et oculi vestri videbunt, et vos
dicetis, Magnificabitur Iehova super terminum Israel. (Addendus etiam
sextus versus, saltem initium:)

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p10"></span>**6.** A son honoureth *his* father, and
a servant his master: if then I *be* a father, where *is* mine honour?
and if I *be* a master, where *is* my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto
you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we
despised thy name?

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p11"></span>**6.** Filius honorat patrem, et servus
dominum suum; et si pater ego, ubi honor meus? et si dominus ego, ubi
timor mei? dicit Iehova exercituum ad vos, O sacerdotes, qui contemnitis
nomen meum: et dixistis, In quo contempsimus nomen tuum?

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p12"></span> 

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p13"></span><span id="iv.ii.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p14"></span>I am constrained by the context to read
all these verses; for the sense cannot be otherwise completed. God
expostulates here with a perverse and an ungrateful people, because they
doubly deprived him of his right; for he was neither loved nor feared,
though he had a just claim to the name and honor of a master as well as
that of a father. As then the Jews paid him no reverence, he complains
that he was defrauded of his right as a father; and as they entertained
no fear for him, he condemns them for not acknowledging, him as their
Lord and Master, by submitting to his authority. But before he comes to
this, he shows that he was both their Lord and Father; and he declares
that he was especially their Father, because he loved them.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p15"></span>We now then understand the Prophet’s
intention; for God designed to show here how debased the Jews were, as
they acknowledged him neither as their Father nor as their Lord; they
neither reverenced him as their Lord, nor regarded him as their Father.
But he brings forward, as I have already said, his benefits, by which he
proves that he deserved the honor due to a father and to a master.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p16"></span>Hence he says, *I loved you*. God might
indeed have made an appeal to the Jews on another ground; for had he not
manifested his love to them, they were yet bound to submit to his
authority. He does not indeed speak here of God’s love generally, such
as he shows to the whole human race; but he condemns the Jews, inasmuch
as having been freely adopted by God as his holy and peculiar people,
they yet forgot this honor, and despised the Giver, and regarded what he
taught them as nothing. When therefore God says that he loved the Jews,
we see that his object was to convict them of ingratitude for having
despised the singular favor bestowed on them alone, rather than to press
that authority which he possesses over all mankind in common. God then
might have thus addressed them, “I have created you, and have been to
you a kind Father; by my favor does the sun shine on you daily, and the
earth produces its fruit; in a word, I hold you bound to me by
innumerable benefits.” God might have thus spoken to them; but as I have
said, his object was to bring forward the gratuitous adoption with which
he had favored the seed of Abraham; for it was a less endurable impiety,
that they had despised so incomparable a favor; inasmuch as God had
preferred them to all other nations, not on the ground of merit or of
any worthiness, but because it had so pleased him. This then is the
reason why the Prophet begins by saying, that the Jews had been *loved*
by God: for they had made the worst return for this gratuitous favor,
when they despised his doctrine. This is the first thing.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p17"></span>There is further no doubt but that he
indirectly condemns their ingratitude when he says, *In what hast thou
loved us?* The words indeed may be thus explained — “If ye say, or if ye
ask, In what have I loved you? Even in this — I preferred your father
Jacob to Esau, when yet they were twin brothers.” But we shall see in
other places that the Jews by evasions malignantly obscured God’s favor,
and that this wickedness is in similar words condemned. Hence the
Prophet, seeing that he had to do with debased men, who would not easily
yield to God nor acknowledge his kindness by a free and ingenuous
confession, introduces them here as speaking thus clamorously, “He! when
hast thou loved us! in what! the tokens of thy love do not appear.” He
answers in God’s name, *Esau was Jacob’s brother; and yet I loved Jacob,
and Esau I hated*.”

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p18"></span><span id="iv.ii.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p19"></span>We now see what I have just referred to,
— that the Jews are reminded of God’s gratuitous covenant, that they
might cease to excuse their wickedness in having misused this singular
favor. He does not then upbraid them here, because they had been as
other men created by God, because God caused his sun to shine on them,
because they were supplied with food from the earth; but he says, that
they had been preferred to other people, not on account of their own
merit, but because it had pleased God to choose their father Jacob. He
might have here adduced Abraham as an example; but as Jacob and Esau
proceeded from Abraham, with whom God had made the covenant, his favor
was the more remarkable, inasmuch as though Abraham had been alone
chosen by God, and other nations were passed by, yet from the very
family which the Lord had adopted, one had been chosen while the other
was rejected. When a comparison is made between Esau and Jacob, we must
bear in mind that they were brothers; but there are other circumstances
to be noticed, which though not expressed here by the Prophet, are yet
well known: for all the Jews knew that Esau was the first-born; and that
hence Jacob had obtained the right of primogeniture contrary to the
order of nature. As then this was commonly known, the Prophet was
content to use only this one sentence, *Esau was Jacob’s brother*

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p20"></span>But he says that Jacob was chosen by God,
and that his brother, the first-born, was rejected. If the reason be
asked, it is not to be found in their descent, for they were twin
brothers; and they had not come forth from the womb when the Lord by an
oracle testified that Jacob would be the greater. We hence see that the
origin of all the excellency which belonged to the posterity of Abraham,
is here ascribed to the gratuitous love of God, according to what Moses
often said, “Not because ye excelled other nations, or were more in
number, has God honored you with so many benefits; but because he loved
your fathers.” The Jews then had always been reminded, that they were
not to seek for the cause of their adoption but in the gratuitous favor
of God; he had been pleased to choose them — this was the source of
their salvation. We now understand the Prophet’s design when he says,
that *Esau was Jacob’s brother*,  <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) and yet was not loved by God.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p29"></span>We must at the same time bear in mind
what I have already said — that this singular favor of God towards the
children of Jacob is referred to, in order to make them ashamed of their
ingratitude, inasmuch as God had set his love on objects so unworthy.
For had they been deserving, they might have boasted that a reward was
rendered to them; but as the Lord had gratuitously and of his own good
pleasure conferred this benefit on them, their impiety was the less
excusable. This baseness then is what our Prophet now reprobates.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p30"></span>Then follows a proof of hatred as to
Esau, the Lord *made his mountain a desolation, and his inheritance a
desert where serpents dwelt*. Esau, we know, when driven away by his own
shame, or by his father’s displeasure, came to Mount Seir; and the whole
region where his posterity dwelt was rough and enclosed by many
mountains. But were any to object and say, that this was no remarkable
token of hatred, as it might on the other hand be said, that the love of
God towards Jacob was not much shown, because he dwelt in the land of
Canaan, since the Chaldeans inhabited a country more pleasant and more
fruitful, and the Egyptians also were very wealthy; to this the answer
is — that the land of Canaan was a symbol of God’s love, not only on
account of its fruitfulness, but because the Lord had consecrated it to
himself and to his chosen people. So Jerusalem was not superior to other
cities of the land, either to Samaria or Bethlehem, or other towns, on
account of its situation, for it stood, as it is well known, in a hilly
country, and it had only the spring of Siloam, fiom which flowed a small
stream; and the view was not so beautiful, nor its fertility great; at
the same time it excelled in other things. for God had chosen it as his
sanctuary; and the same must be said of the whole land. As then the land
of Canaan was, as it were, a pledge of an eternal inheritance to the
children of Abraham, the scripture on this account greatly extols it,
and speaks of it in magnificent terms. If Mount Seir was very wealthy
and replenished with everything delightful, it must have been still a
sad exile to the Idumeans, because it was a token of their reprobation;
for Esau, when he left his father’s house, went there; and he became as
it were an alien, having deprived himself of the celestial inheritance,
as he had sold his birthright to his brother Jacob. This is the reason
why God declares here that Esau was dismissed as it were to the
mountains, and deprived of the Holy Land which God had destined to his
chosen people.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p31"></span>But the Prophet also adds another thing,
— that God’s hatred as manifested when the posterity of Esau became
extinct. For though the Assyrians and Chaldeans had no less cruelly
raged against the Jews than against the Edomites, yet the issue was very
different; for after seventy years the Jews returned to their own
country, as Jeremiah had promised: yet Idumea was not to be restored,
but the tokens of God’s dreadful wrath had ever appeared there in its
sad desolations. Since then there had been no restoration as to Idumea,
the Prophet shows that by this fact the love of God towards Jacob and
his hatred towards Esau had been proved; for it had not been through the
contrivance of men that the Jews had liberty given them, and that they
were allowed to build the temple; but because God had chosen them in the
person of Jacob, and designed them to be a peculiar and holy people to
himself.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p32"></span>But as to the Edomites, it became then
only more evident that they had been rejected in the person of Esau,
since being once laid waste they saw that they were doomed to perpetual
destruction. This is then the import of the Prophet’s words when he
says, that the possession of Esau had been given to *serpents*. For, as
I have already said, though for a time the condition of Judea and of
Idumea had not been unlike, yet when Jerusalem began to rise and to be
repaired, then God clearly showed that that land had not been in vain
given to his chosen people. But when the neighboring country was not
restored, while yet the posterity of Esau might with less suspicion have
repaired their houses, it became hence sufficiently evident that the
curse of God was upon them.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p33"></span><span id="iv.ii.ii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p34"></span>And to the same purpose he adds, *If Edom
shall say, We have been diminished, but we shall return and build
houses; but if they build, I will pull down, saith God*. He confirms
what I have stated, that the posterity of Edom had no hope of
restoration, for however they might gather courage and diligently labor
in rebuilding their cities, they were not yet to succeed, for God would
pull down all their buildings. This difference then was like a living
representation, by which the Jews might see the love of God towards
Jacob, and his hatred towards Esau. For since both people were
overthrown by the same enemy, how was it that liberty was given to the
Jews and no permission was given to the Idumeans to return to their own
country? There was, as it has been said, a greater ill-will to the Jews,
and yet the Chaldeans dealt with them more kindly. It then follows, that
all this was owing to the wonderful purpose of God, and that hence it
also appeared, that the adoption, which seemed to have been abolished
when the Jews were driven into exile, was not in vain.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p35"></span>*Thus* then saith *Jehovah of hosts, They
shall build*, that is, though they may build, *I will overthrow; and it
shall be said to them, Border of ungodliness, and a people with whom
Jehovah is angry for ever*. By the border of ungodliness he means an
accursed border; as though he had said, “It will openly appear that you
are reprobate, so that the whole world can form a judgment by the event
itself.” By adding, *A people with whom Jehovah is angry* or displeased,
he again confirms what I have said of love and hatred. God might indeed
have been equally angry with the Jews as with the Edomites, but when God
became pacified towards the Jews, while he continued inexorable to the
posterity of Esau, the difference between the two people was hence quite
manifest.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p36"></span>Noticed also must be the words, <span
id="iv.ii.ii-p36.1"></span>עד-עולם, *od-oulam*, for ever: for God seemed
for a time to have rejected the Jews, and the Prophets adopt the same
word <span id="iv.ii.ii-p36.2"></span>זעם, *som*, angry, when they
deplore the condition of the people, who found in various ways that God
was angry with them. But the wrath of God towards the Jews was only for
a time, for he did not wholly forget his covenant; but he became angry
with the Edomites for ever, because their father had been rejected: and
we know that this difference between the elect and the reprobate is ever
pointed out, that when God visits sins in common, he ever moderates his
wrath towards his elect, and sets limits to his severity, according to
what he says, “If his posterity keep not my covenant, but profane my
law, I will chastise them with the rod of man; but my mercy will I not
take away from him.” (<span id="iv.ii.ii-p36.3"></span>[Ps
89:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#031.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p36.3"></span> <span id="iv.ii.ii-p36.4"></span>[2Sa
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p36.4"></span>.) But with regard to the reprobate, God’s
vengeance ever pursues them, is ever suspended over their heads, and
ever fixed as it were in their bones and marrow. For this reason it is
that our Prophet says, that God would be angry with the posterity of
Esau.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p37"></span><span id="iv.ii.ii-p37.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p38"></span>He adds, *Your eyes shall see*. The Jews
had already begun in part to witness this spectacle, but the Prophet
speaks here of what was to continue. *See* then *shall your eyes*; that
is, “As it has already appeared of what avail gratuitous election has
been to you, by which I have chosen you as my people, and as ye have
also seen on the other hand how it has been with your relations the
Edomites, because they had been rejected in the person of their father
Esau; so also this same difference shall ever be evident to you in their
posterity: *see* then *shall your eyes*

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p39"></span>*And ye shall say, Magnified let Jehovah
be over the border of Israel*; that is, “The event itself will extort
this confession, — that I greatly enhance my goodness towards you.” For
though tokens of God’s grace shone forth everywhere, and the earth, as
the Psalmist says, is full of his goodness, (<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p39.1"></span>[Ps
104:24](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ii-p39.1"></span>;) yet there was in Judea something special,
so that.our Prophet does not in vain say, that there would be always
reasons for the Jews to celebrate God’s praises on account of his bounty
to them more than to the rest of the world. And the Prophet no doubt
reproves here indirectly the wickedness of the people, as though he had
said, — “Ye indeed, as far as you can, bury God’s benefits, or at least
extenuate them; but facts themselves must draw from you this confession
— that God deals bountifully with the border of Israel, that he
exercises there his favor more remarkably than among any of the
nations.”

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p40"></span>After having briefly referred to those
benefits which ought to have filled the Jews with shame, he comes at
length to the subject he had in view; for his main object, as I have
already stated, was to show, that it was God’s complaint that he was
deprived of his own right and in a double sense, for the Jews did not
reverence him as their Father, nor fear him as their Lord. He might
indeed have called himself Lord and Father by the right of creation; but
he preferred, as I have already explained, to appeal to their adoption;
for it was a remarkable favor, when the Lord chose some out of all the
human race; and we cannot say that the cause of this was to be found in
men. Whom then he designs to choose, he binds to himself by a holier
bond. But if they disappoint him, wholly inexcusable is their perfidy.

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p41"></span>As we now understand the Prophet’s
meaning, and the object of this expostulation, it remains for us to
learn how to accommodate what is taught to ourselves. We are not indeed
descended fronm Abraham or from Jacob according to the flesh; but as God
has engraved on us certain marks of his adoption, by which he has
distinguished us from other nations, while we were yet nothing better,
we hence see that we are justly exposed to the same reproof with the
Jews, if we do not respond to the calling of God. I wished thus briefly
to touch on this point, in order that we may know that this doctrine is
no less useful to us at this day than it was to the Jews; for though the
adoption is not exactly the same, as it then belonged to one seed and to
one family, yet we are not superior to others through our own
worthiness, but because God has gratuitously chosen us as a people to
himself. Since this has been the case, we are his; for he has redeemed
us by the blood of his own Son, and by rendering us partakers, by the
gospel, of a favor so ineffably great, he has made us his sons and his
servants. Except then we love and reverence him as our Father, and
except we fear him as our Lord, there is found in us at this day an
ingratitude no less base than in that ancient people. But as I wished
now only to refer to the chief point, I shall speak tomorrow, as the
passage requires, on the subject of election: but it was necessary first
briefly to show the Prophet’s design, as I have done; and then to treat
particular points more at large, as the case may require.

<span id="iv.ii.iii"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="iv.ii.iii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast
not only designed to give us a life in common in this world but hast
also separated us from other heathen nations, and illuminated us by the
Sun of Righteousness, thine only begotten Son, in order to lead us into
the inheritance of eternal salvation, — O grant, that having been
rescued from the darkness of death, we may ever attend to that celestial
light, by which thou guidest and invitest us to thyself; and may we so
walk as the children of light, as never to wander from the course of our
holy calling, but to advance in it continually, until we shall at length
reach the goal which thou hast set before us, so that having put off all
the filth of the flesh, we may be transformed into that ineffable glory,
of which we have now the image in thine only-begotten, Son. — Amen.

<span id="iv.ii.iv"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Seventieth

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p2"></span>We saw yesterday what the object of
Malachi was in reminding the Jews that they were loved and chosen by
God; it was, that he might the more amplify their ingratitude for having
rendered such an unworthy reward for so great a favor of God: as he had
preferred them to all other nations, he had justly bound them to
perpetual obedience; but they had shaken off the yoke, and having
despised God had given themselves up again to many corruptions, as we
have yesterday stated. But I reminded you at the same time, that the
Prophet refers not here to those benefits with which God favors
indiscriminately all mankind, but brings forward the adoption by which
he had set apart the seed of Abraham as his peculiar people.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p3"></span>But that it may appear more fully how just
this expostulation was, let us first observe, that it is one kind of
obligation that God has created us men in his image and after his
likeness; for he might have created us dogs and asses, and not men.
Adam, we know, was taken from the earth, as other animals were: then as
to the body there is no difference between men and other creatures. When
it is said that God breathed into man the breath of life, we ought not
to dream as the Manicheans do, that man’s soul is by traduction; for so
they say, affirming that man’s soul is from the substance of the Deity;
but Moses on the contrary understands that man’s soul was created from
nothing. We are born by generation, and yet our origin is clay; and the
chief thing in us, the soul, is created from nothing. We hence see that
we differ from animals because God was pleased to create us men. He
therefore will justly charge us with ingratitude, if we do not serve
him; for it was for this end he created us in his own image.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p4"></span>But there is here mentioned a special
favor — that the Lord took to himself the seed of Abraham, as it is said
in the song of Moses, that all nations are God’s, but that he had cast
his line to set apart Israel for himself. (<span
id="iv.ii.iv-p4.1"></span>[De
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#009)<span id="iv.ii.iv-p4.1"></span>..md)
Though then the whole world was under God’s government, it was yet his
will to choose one family. If the cause be enquired, it is not to be
found in men; for all were created from the earth, and souls were
implanted in their bodies created from nothing. Since it was so, we see
that the difference arose from the fountain of gratuitous favor — that
God preferred one race to the rest; and as we stated yesterday, Moses
often repeats this — that the Jews were not chosen because they were
more excellent than other nations, but because God gratuitously loved
their fathers. (<span id="iv.ii.iv-p4.2"></span>[De
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#007)<span id="iv.ii.iv-p4.2"></span>..md)
By love he means gratuitous favor.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p5"></span>Malachi then does not consider here that
the Jews had been chosen before other nations on the ground of their own
merit; for if he granted this, they might have objected and said — “Why
dost thou remind us that God has favored us more than other nations,
since he deemed us worthy, and rewarded our merit?” But the Prophet
takes it as admitted, according to what I have already said, that the
Jews were by nature like other nations, so that their different
condition did not proceed from themselves, or from their own worthiness,
but from the gratuitous love of God.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p6"></span>A third step is also to be noticed here;
for God selected a part only from the very race of Abraham, as Esau and
Jacob were brothers, and Esau was first according to the order of
nature, for he was the first-born; and yet God rejected him, and
appointed the favor of election to be in the posterity of Jacob. This
third step then was election.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p7"></span>These things ought to be carefully
considered. Men are peculiarly bound to God, because he might have
created them asses and dogs, and not men; but it has pleased him to form
them in his own image. The second step is, that he chose the race of
Abraham, when his empire extended over all nations without exception:
for how was it that God chose to be the father and savior of one people
only, when the whole world was under his authority? Here shines forth,
as I have already said, his gratuitous favor; and in addition to the
testimonies of Moses, it is often said in the Psalms that God loved the
fathers, that he did to them what he had not done to other nations, that
he made known his judgments to them. (<span
id="iv.ii.iv-p7.1"></span>[Ps
147:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iv-p7.1"></span>.) There are many passages in which God
commemorates his favor to the Jews, because it pleased him to
distinguish them from other nations, while yet the condition of all by
nature was wholly the same. Now the third step which Malachi mentions
ought to be carefully noticed — that God not only promised to be a God
to Abraham and to his seed, but also made a difference between the very
sons of Abraham, so as to reject some and to choose others; and it is on
this point that Paul dwells in the ninth chapter to the Romans; <span
id="iv.ii.iv-p7.2"></span>[Ro
9:1-33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.ii.iv-p7.2"></span>
for he says, that not all who are of Israel-that is, who derive their
origin from him — are true and legitimate Israelites, but those who are
called. For it was Paul’s object to refute the Jews, for they boasted
that they were a holy people, though they wilfully rejected Christ and
his gospel. For when the apostles proved that the Redeemer promised had
been sent, the proud answer in the mouth of the Jews was this — “Are not
we the Church of God? but we do not acknowledge this Christ whom ye
would thrust upon us.” As then the Jews, through this false pretense,
despised the favor of God, and sought to trample Christ as it were under
foot, Paul repels this arrogance, and shows that they excelled not the
nations, except by virtue of a gratuitous adoption, and that this
adoption was to be so extended to the whole race of Abraham as yet to be
confined to a certain number.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p8"></span>In the same manner do the Papists act in
the present day. As they estimate faith by external tokens, they
haughtily object to us, and say that they are the Church; as though a
general promise were sufficient without the Spirit, who is justly called
the Spirit of adoption, by whom God seals it within, even in our hearts.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p9"></span>Now Paul adds evidences of the fact, and
brings forward the instance of Jacob and Esau. Of the twin brothers,
one, he says, was chosen, and the other passed by; and yet both were the
sons of Abraham. It then follows that there is a third step in election,
as I have already stated. Now from this third proceeds a fourth — that
God takes some of the sons of Jacob, whom he has chosen before the
foundation of the world, and others he rejects; and of this fact Paul
adduces a sure proof, or assigns an evident reason: God preferred Jacob
to his brother, the first-born, but not on account of any merit: if then
the free mercy of God availed so much in the election of Jacob, it
follows that the same still prevails with regard to his posterity. If it
be again asked, whence comes it that some are faithful and others are
reprobate, the answer is, because it so pleases God. Hence Paul ascends
higher and says, that before they were born, and had done neither good
nor evil, it was said, the elder shall serve the younger; and then he
brings forward this prophecy-Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.”

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p10"></span>If then we wisely consider the whole
passage, we shall find what I have stated — that from the third step we
may proceed to a fourth, and that is, that from the sons of Jacob God
chose whom he pleased and rejected others; for when he chose Jacob, God
was not bound to him any more than he was before. The same promise was
indeed repeated to Jacob, which had been given to Abraham; but from
Abraham proceeded Ishmael, who was rejected, we know, from God’s Church;
and the same was the case with the other sons of Abraham. Isaac was
alone chosen. But Isaac, the father of Esau and Jacob, was not able at
his own pleasure to retain them both; but here the free and hidden
election of God appeared, so that Esau was rejected, and Jacob remained
as the legitimate heir to the divine favor.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p11"></span>We now then more fully understand what
the Prophet means: he does not charge the Jews with having shaken off
every fear of that God, in whose image they had been created; but he
enhances their ingratitude, because they gave no response to the free
adoption of God, for they had been chosen from all other nations, and
not only this, but they had been separated again from the very race of
Abraham, and this was their second election. Another thing must also be
added respecting their gratuitous election; for the reproof of the
Prophet would not have been received, except God in his adoption had
regard only to his own favor; for if we grant that either Jacob or
Abraham had merited anything, what the Prophet says, *Was not Esau
Jacob’s brother?* would not have availed. An answer might have been
readily given, “He was indeed his brother, but his virtue being
meritorious set him before his brother.” But the Prophet here presses
this point on the Jews — that having been bound by so many benefits,
they yet were become as it were spurious; for they had degenerated from
the favor which God had conferred on them. We hence see that by these
words of the Prophet it is sufficiently proved — that Abraham had been
chosen by God in preference to all other nations, Isaac in preference to
his brother Ishmael, and Jacob in preference to Esau.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p12"></span>And Scripture is full of proofs on the
subject, and experience also sufficiently demonstrates the truth. Moses
says, that it was not by their own virtue that they excelled other
nations, for they were a rebellious and a stiff-necked people. Though
God then knew the perverse character of that nation, it yet pleased him
to make them an example of his wonderful goodness. There is therefore no
reason for us to seek any other cause for adoption except the will of
God. And since the election of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was gratuitous,
it follows that each one is freely chosen whom God separates from the
whole body; and thus we come to the fourth step; for what is said here,
that Jacob was chosen, ought not to be confined to his person, but what
he had in common with his posterity. Jacob then was chosen — for what
purpose? that his children might be God’s holy and peculiar people. Now
if we consider his whole offspring, we shall find that all who descended
from Jacob were not legitimate Israelites, for the greatest part of them
were rejected. As then many who derived their origin from Jacob, were
not less reprobate than Esau, it follows that God’s free favor and
gratuitous mercy prevails as to individuals: and this is the subject
which Paul discusses in the ninth chapter to the Romans.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p13"></span>It seems hard to many, that God should
choose some and not all, and that he should regard no worthiness, but of
his own free will choose whom he pleases, and reject others. But whence
comes this objection, except that they wish to restrain God and subject
him to their own judgment? But we must come to the principle to which I
have referred. If it seems unreasonable to them that one of two should
be chosen and the other rejected, how can they defend the justice of God
(if need there be of their apology) with regard to an ass and man? for
as I have said, they both proceeded, both asses and men, from the same
lump as to their bodies. Every vigor and strength in the ass has been
created by the hidden power of God: and as to the soul of man, though
its essence is immortal, it has yet been created from nothing. Now,
then, let these wise censors answer for God in this case, whom they
think to be exposed to many calumnies, when we say that men’s salvation
depends on his will, so that he rejects some and chooses others.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p14"></span>But as to general election, there is the
same difficulty to satisfy the judgment of men: for as we have already
said, there is no difference between men but what arises from hidden
election. They indeed imagine in this case a foreknowledge as the mother
of election: but the notion is extremely foolish and puerile. They then
say, that some are elected by God and some are rejected, because God, to
whom nothing is hid, foresees what every one will be. But I now ask,
Whence is it that one is virtuous, while another is vicious? If they
say, from free-will, doubtless creation is anterior to free-will: this
is one thing. Then we know that in Adam all men were created alike; for
how is it that we are all exposed to eternal death, and that the
vengeance of God extends over us all, and at this day prevails through
the whole world? How is this, except that the condition of us all
originally is one and the same? It follows then, that if Adam stood
upright, all men would be alike in their integrity. I do not now speak
of special gifts: for there would have been, I allow, a difference of
endowments had nature remained perfect; but as to eternal life the
condition of all would have been the same. Now after the fall of Adam we
are all lost. What can then be more foolish and absurd than to imagine
that there is some virtue in man by which he excels others, since we are
all equally accursed in the person of Adam? For who hath made thee to
excel, saith Paul? He proves that there is no excellency in man, except
what proceeds from the bounty of God only, and as I have stated, the
reason is quite manifest.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p15"></span>For either original sin does not belong
to all men, or God cannot foresee that this man will be just and that
man unjust. Why? All are naturally reprobate in Adam and liable to
eternal death, and the reason is evident, for nothing is found in men
but sin. The foreknowledge of God then cannot be the cause of our
election, for by looking on the whole race of man, he finds them all
under a curse from the least to the greatest.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p16"></span>We see then how foolishly do they talk
and prattle who ascribe to mere and naked prescience what ought to be
ascribed to the good pleasure of God. That God made himself known to the
race of Abraham, that he designed to deposit his law with the Israelites
— all this was his peculiar favor, and no other reason can be assigned
for it except gratuitous adoption. God then favored the children of
Abraham with this privilege, because it so pleased him: for if we say
that they were worthy, and by their virtue rendered themselves
deserving, the Holy Spirit does in the first place everywhere speak
against us, and in the second place experience and facts, for the
obstinacy of that people was extraordinary. But we ought to be satisfied
with the authority of Scripture, since God makes known and illustrates
his favor by this instance — that he loved Abraham and his children,
that is, that he was favorable to the Jews through his own goodness
only, and this is what we shall hereafter see still more clearly. Let
this then remain as a fixed principle — that the cause of our election
is nothing else but the mere favor of God. If we seek a cause apart from
God, when we enquire about our election, we shall wander in a labyrinth.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p17"></span>That the same principle holds as to
individuals, I have already proved. It ought indeed to be sufficient for
us, that Paul passes from the person of Jacob to individuals among his
posterity. For he adduces as it wet e an instance in the two brothers,
in order to convince us that no one is chosen on account of his own
virtue, but according to the good pleasure of God: nor was it necessary
to state these circumstances — that one was chosen when the brothers
were not yet born, and when they had not done either good or evils that
it was not through works but through him who called, except he meant to
prove this, that it is in God’s power to choose whom he wills and to
reject whom he wills. But as Augustine reminds us, nothing can be
imagined more absurd than that notion, with which many are pleased, that
God has foreknown what men will be, for Paul excludes such foreknowledge
as the cause which he infers, that it was not owing to works but to him
who called, that God preferred the one to the other, for neither of
them, while in their mother’s womb, had done either good or evil.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p18"></span>Paul brings also a confirmation from
another declaration of Moses, “I will pity whom I will pity, and mercy
will I show to whom I will be merciful. “By these words God clearly
declares that it was in his power to reject whom he pleased of the seed
of Jacob, and to choose whom he pleased. What then he had before said
respecting one man, God now applies to the whole seed, for he speaks not
there of foreign nations, but of that holy and chosen people. When God
threatened with ruin all the children of Abraham, Moses humbly
deprecated this, lest he should annul his own covenant: God answered
him, “I will pity whom I will pity,” — what does this mean? that there
is no other cause why God retains some for himself and rejects others,
than his own will. The repetition may seem superfluous and frigid, “I
will pity whom I will pity,” but it is very emphatical; as though he had
said, “I might have chosen for myself another from the world and not
Abraham, but I have according to my own good pleasure adopted him; and
Ishmael might have been as dear to me as Isaac, but it has been my will
that the blessing should rest on Isaac; when he also had begotten two
children, I repudiated the first born and choose Jacob, and now from the
posterity of Jacob I will choose for myself whom I please, for there is
to be found no other cause but my will, ‘I will then pity whom I will
pity, and mercy will I show to whom I will be merciful.’” If then in
this case men will contend with God, and would know why he chooses this
rather than that man, the answer he gives is, that the cause is to be
found in his mercy alone, for he is bound to no one.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p19"></span>We now see how the folly of those
vanishes away who would have foreknowledge to be the cause of election;
and also that they who murmur against God, are sufficiently refuted by
this reason, that it is in his power either to choose or to reject,
inasmuch as he is under obligations to none.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p20"></span>As to reprobation, the cause of it is
sufficiently manifest in the fall of Adam, for, as we have said, we all
fell with him. It must still be observed, that the election of God is
anterior to Adam’s fall; and that hence all we who are rescued from the
common ruin have been chosen in Christ before the creation of the world,
but that others justly perish though they had not been lost in Adam;
because God appointed Christ the head of his Church, in order that we
might be saved in him, not all, but those who have been chosen.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p21"></span>And with regard to the proof, it is not
necessary here to bring together the mass of passages found in
scripture, for this would be endless. But there are, however, some
remarkable passages, by which it is sufficiently evident that some are
chosen from the whole world as well as from the race of Abraham,
according to God’s good pleasure only, and that others are rejected, and
that there is no other cause to be found but his will; for our election
is hid in the eternal and secret counsel of God, and founded on Christ,
and reprobation is also hid in the judgment of God. Now if we wish to
penetrate into this mystery, we must know that it is a great and
unfathomable abyss: here all our ideas vanish away. In the meantime,
however, God does not lose his liberty to choose and reject whom he
pleases.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p22"></span>With regard to election, the ninth
chapter to the Romans (<span id="iv.ii.iv-p22.1"></span>[Ro
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001)<span id="iv.ii.iv-p22.1"></span>.md)
ought to be sufficient, or rather the three chapters, for Paul pursues
the same argument to the end of the eleventh chapter, and then exclaims
that the riches of God’s wisdom and goodness are incomprehensible, and
that his judgments are untraceable. He speaks also of the elect in the
first chapter to the Ephesians; <span id="iv.ii.iv-p22.2"></span>[Eph
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.ii.iv-p22.2"></span>
and the sum of what he says is, that all the faithful had been chosen in
Christ before the creation of the world, and through the good pleasure
of God only, in order that he might show in them the glory of his
goodness.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p23"></span>By no refinements can they escape who
attempt to darken this truth; for Paul very clearly and briefly declares
that the whole world has not been chosen, but the faithful, who are
afterwards favored with the Spirit of adoption: and thus sufficiently is
that fancy refuted, that the election of God ought to be connected with
his promises. I wonder that men of learning, endued with judgment and
versed in scripture, so frigidly pass over the subject, and that they
are not at least moved when they see that they give to many the occasion
of foolishly going astray, and that some take hence the opportunity to
calumniate. We must, however, declare what this passage requires — that
those are very unwise who seek to subvert or overthrow the eternal
election of God by this contrivance — that God addresses all men
generally, “Come unto me” — “I am your Father.” Since God then offers
his grace to all by the external preaching of his word, they will have
it that all are elected: but Paul says, that we are believers, because
we have been elected. If then it be asked, why some obstinately reject
the grace of God, and others embrace it in the spirit of meekness, Paul
assigns the reason, and it is this — because God illuminates those who
believe, inasmuch as he has chosen them before the creation of the
world. It then follows that God so speaks generally, as that the
efficacy of the doctrine still depends on his secret good pleasure; for
whence is faith, but from his peculiar favor? and why does he not
communicate his grace to all? even because he has not chosen all. We see
that Paul thus proceeds step b,y step, that he might teach us that faith
emanates from the fountain of free election; and he raises up election
into the highest eminence to show that it is not right to inquire into
its cause. Thus much about election.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p24"></span>As to reprobation, I know that many
greatly dislike this doctrine — that some are rejected, and that yet no
cause can be found in themselves why they thus remain disapproved by
God. But there is here need of docility and of a meek spirit, to which
Paul also exhorts us, when he says,

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p25"></span>“O man, who art thou who answerest
against God?”  
(<span id="iv.ii.iv-p25.2"></span>[Ro
9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.ii.iv-p25.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p26"></span>For were it lawful to investigate the
cause, surely Paul, who had been taken up to the third heaven, might
have showed us the way; but he is here silent and drives us away from
the indulgence of a bold and an over curious spirit. Since the Holy
Spirit by the mouth of Paul restrains the presumption of men, that they
may not dare to go beyond this step — that God hardens whom he wills and
rejects whom he wills, why do men leap beyond this, except they wilfully
seek to carry on war with God? and yet they pretend modesty, and under
this pretext they seek to bury the doctrine of election; we ought, they
say, to speak soberly of mysteries. This last sentence I allow fully;
but what is our sobriety but our docility? that is, when we embrace what
God declares in his word, and never allow ourselves to investigate more
than what he teaches us. But they would extinguish God’s word; nay, they
dare openly to pronounce blasphemies against God, and to find fault with
the Spirit, who has spoken by the prophets and the apostles.

<span id="iv.ii.iv-p27"></span>We indeed see that there are many devils
who preach modesty, when their object is to suppress the light and this
chief doctrine, the main basis of our salvation; and they extort wicked
edicts from the ignorant and the slumbering, as though it were in the
power of men, by babbling about things unknown, and by barbarously
mixing all things together, to thrust God as it were from his celestial
throne. This is horribly monstrous, and ought to be detested by all; for
it would be better that all the empires of the world should be swallowed
up in the lowest depths, than that mortal creatures should raise
themselves up as it were into heaven, and attempt to penetrate into the
secret things of God. But, however, when the whole world either assail
this doctrine by barking, or seek to subvert it by threats and terrors,
or when all in various ways manifest their rage, and when they roll
thunders who seem to themselves to be very powerful, it behoves us to
hold fast this doctrine, that God alone is the author of our salvation,
because he has been pleased freely to elect us, and also that he
possesses power over all the human race, so that some, according to his
will, are elected and some are rejected, and that he ever acts justly,
and holds secret the cause both of election and of reprobation. But it
is no wonder that we are so blind, for we are stupid by nature, nay,
blind altogether; and were we angels, it would be still our duty
reverently to regard the manifold wisdom of God, which no human minds,
no, not even angelic minds, can fully comprehend. Other things we must
defer.

<span id="iv.ii.v"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.v-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="iv.ii.v-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou best been
pleased to adopt us as thy people for this end, that we may be ingrafted
as it were into the body of thy Son, and be made conformable to our
head, — O grant, that through our whole life we may strive to seal in
our hearts the faith of our election, that we may be the more stimulated
to render thee true obedience, and that thy glory may also be made known
through us; and those whom thou hast chosen together with us may we
labor to bring together, that we may unanimously celebrate thee as the
Author of our salvation, and so ascribe to thee the glory of thy
goodness, that having cast away and renounced all confidence in our own
virtue, we may be led to Christ only as the fountain of thy election, in
whom also is set before us the certainty of our salvation through thy
gospel, until we shall at length be gathered into that eternal glory
which He has proctored for us by his own blood. — Amen.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p8"></span> 

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p9"></span><span id="iv.ii.vii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p10"></span>God as already proved that he had by
many favors been a Father to the Jews. They must have felt that he had
indeed bound them to himself, provided they possessed any religion or
gratitude. He now then concludes his address to them, as though he had
said, that he had very ill bestowed all the blessings he had given them;
and he adopts two similitudes; he first compares himself to a father,
and then to a master. He says, that in these two respects he had a just
cause to complain of the Jews; for he had been a father to them, but
they did not in their turn conduct themselves as children, in a
submissive and obedient manner, as they ought to have done. And farther,
he became their master, but they shook off the yoke, and allowed not
themselves to be ruled by his authority.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p11"></span>As to the word, Father, we have already
shown that the Jews were not only in common with others the children of
God, but had been also chosen as his peculiar people. Their adoption
then made them God’s children above all other nations; for when they
differed nothing from the rest of the world, God adopted them. With
regard to the right and power of a master, God, in the first place, held
them bound to him as the Creator and former of the whole world; but he
also, as it is well known, attained the right by redemption. That he
might then enhance their crime, he not only expostulates with them for
having abused his favors, but he charges them also with obstinacy,
because they disobeyed his authority, while yet he was their Lord.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p12"></span>He says, that a *son who honors his
father, and a servant* his *master*. He applies the same verb to both
clauses; but he afterwards makes a difference, ascribing honor to a
father and fear to a master. As to the first clause, we know that
whenever there is authority, there ought to be honor; and when masters
are over servants, they ought to be honored. But in a subsequent clause
he speaks more distinctly, and says, that a master ought to be feared by
a servant, while honor is due to a father from a son. For servants do
not love their masters; not being able to escape from their power, they
fear them: but the reverence which sons have for their fathers, is more
generous and more voluntary. But God shows here, that the Jews could by
no means be kept to their duty, though so many favors ought to have made
it their sweet delight. God had indeed conciliated them as much as
possible to himself, but all was without any benefit. The majesty also
of God ought to have struck them with fear. It was then the same, as
though he had said, that they were of so perverse a nature, that they
could not be led to obedience either by a kind and gracious invitation,
or by an authoritative command.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p13"></span>The Lord then complains that he ass
deprived by the Jews of the honor which sons owe to their fathers, as
well as of the fear which servants ought to have for their masters; and
thus he shows that they were like untameable wild beasts, which cannot
be tamed by any kind treatment, nor subdued by scourges, or by any kind
of castigation.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p14"></span>He then adds, *To you, O priests*. It is
certain that this complaint ought not to be confined to the priests
alone, since God, as we have seen, speaks generally of the whole race of
Abraham: for he had said that Levi was advanced to the sacerdotal honor,
while the other brethren were passed by; but he had said also, that
Jacob was chosen when Esau was rejected; and this belonged in common to
the twelve tribes. Now it ought not, and it could not, be confined to
the tribe of Levi, that God was their father or their master. Why then
does he now expressly address the priests? They ought indeed to have
been leaders and teachers to the rest of the people, but he does not on
this account exempt the whole people from blame or guilt, though he
directs his discourse to the priests; for his object was to show that
all things had become so corrupt among the people, that the priests were
become as it were the chief in contempt of religion and in sacrileges,
and in every kind of pollution. It hence follows that there was nothing
sound and right in the community; for when the eyes themselves are
without light, they cannot discharge their duty to the body, and what at
length will follow?

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p15"></span>God then no doubt shows that great
corruptions prevailed and had spread so much among the people, that they
who ought to have been examples to others, had especially shaken off the
yoke and given way to unbridled licentiousness. This then is the reason
why the Prophet condemns the priests, though at the beginning he
included the whole people, as it is evident from the context.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p16"></span>We must at the same time bear in mind
what we have elsewhere said -that the fault of the people was not
lessened because the sin of the priest was the most grievous; but that
all were involved in the same ruin; for God in this case did not absolve
the common people, inasmuch as they were guilty of the same sins; but he
shows that the most grievous fault belonged to the teachers, who had not
reproved the people, but on the contrary increased licentiousness by
their dissimulation, as we shall presently find again.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p17"></span>He says that they *despised his name*;
not that the fear of God prevailed in others, but that it was the duty
of the priests to reprove the impiety of the whole people. As then they
allowed to others so much liberty, it appeared quite evident that the
name of God was but little esteemed by them; for had they possessed true
zeal, they would not have suffered the worship of God to be trodden
under foot or profaned, as we shall presently find to have been the
case.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p18"></span>It then follows, *Ye have said, In what
have we despised thy name?* As the Prophet at the beginning indirectly
touched on the hypocrisy and perverseness of the people, so he now no
doubt repeats the same thing by using a similar language: for how was it
that the priests as well as the people asked a question on a plain
matter, as though it were obscure, except that they were blind to their
own vices? Now the cause of blindness is hypocrisy, and then, as it is
wont to do, it brings with it perverseness; for all who deceive
themselves, dare even to raise their horns against God, and petulantly
to clamor that he too severely treats them; for the Prophet doubtless
does not here relate their words, except for the purpose of showing that
they had such a brazen front and so hard a neck, that they boldly
repelled all reproofs. We see at this day in the world the same
sottishness; for though the crimes reproved are sufficiently known, yet
they, even the most wicked, immediately object and say that wrong is
done to them; and they will not acknowledge a fault except they be a
hundred times convicted, and even then they will make some pretense. And
truly were there not daily proofs to teach us how refractory men are
towards God, the thing would be incredible. The Prophet then did no
doubt by this cutting expression goad and also wound the people as well
as the priests, intimating that so gross was their hypocrisy, that they
dared to make shifts, when their crimes were openly known to all.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p19"></span>*Ye have said then, by what have we
despised thy name?* They inquired as though they had rubbed their
forehead, and then gained boldness, “What does this mean? for thou
accuses us here of being wicked and sacrilegious, but we are not
conscious of any wrong.” Then the answer is given in God’s name, *Ye
offer on mine altar polluted bread*. A question may be here asked,
“Ought this to have been imputed to the priests as a crime; for had
victims been offered, such as God in his law commanded, it would have
been to the advantage and benefit of the priests; and had fine corn been
brought, it would have been advantageous to the priests?” But it seems
to me probable, that the priests are condemned because like hungry and
famished men they seized indiscriminately on all things around them.
Some think that the priests grossly and fraudulently violated the law by
changing the victims — that when a fat ram was offered, the priests, as
they suppose, took it away, and put in its place a ram that was lean, or
lame, or mutilated. But this view appears not to me suitable to the
passage. Let us then regard the meaning to be what I have stated — that
God here contends with the whole people, but that he directs his
reproofs to the priests, because they were in two ways guilty, for they
formed a part of the people, and they also suffered God to be
dishonored; for what could have been more disgraceful than to offer
polluted victims and polluted bread?

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p20"></span>If it be now asked, whether this ought
to have been ascribed as a fault to the priests, the answer is this —
that the people then were not very wealthy; for they had but lately
returned from exile, and they had not brought with them much wealth, and
the land was desolate and uncultivated: as, then, there was so much want
among the people, and they were intent, each on his advantage, according
to what we have seen in the Prophet Haggai, (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p20.1"></span>[Hag
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p20.1"></span>,) and neglected the temple of God and their
sacrifices, there is no doubt but that they wished anyhow to discharge
their duty towards God, and therefore brought beasts which were either
lame or blind; and hence the whole worship of God was vitiated, their
sacrifices being polluted. The priests ought to have rejected all these,
and to have closed up God’s temple, rather than to have received
indiscriminately what God had prohibited. As then this indifference of
the people was nothing but a profanation of divine worship, the priests
ought to have firmly opposed it. But as they themselves were hungry,
they thought it better to lay hold on everything around them — “What,”
they said, “will become of us? for if we reject these sacrifices,
however vicious they may be, they will offer nothing; and thus we shall
starve, and there will be no advantage; and we shall be forced in this
case to open and to close the temple, and to offer sacrifices at our own
expense, and we are not equal to this burden.” Since then the priests
spared the people for private gain, our Prophet justly reproves them,
and says, *ye offer polluted bread*

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p21"></span><span id="iv.ii.vii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p22"></span>It was indeed the office of the priests
to place bread daily on the table; but whence could bread be obtained
except some were offered? Now nothing was lost to the priests, when they
daily set bread before God, for they presently received it; and thus
they preferred, as it was more to their advantage, to offer bread well
approved, made of fine flour: but as I have said, their own convenience
interposed, for they thought that they could not prevail with the people
— “If we irritate these men, they will deny that they have anything to
offer; and thus the temple will be empty, and our own houses will be
empty; it is then better to take coarse bread from them than nothing; we
shall at least feed our families and servants with this bread, after
having offered it to the Lord.” We hence see how the fault belonged to
the priests, when the people offered polluted bread, and unapproved
victims.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p23"></span><span id="iv.ii.vii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p24"></span>I have hitherto explained the Prophet’s
words with reference chiefly to the shew-bread; not that they ought to
be so strictly taken as many interpreters have considered them; for
under the name of bread is included, we know, every kind of eatables; so
it seems probable to me that the word ought to be extended to all the
sacrifices; but one kind is here mentioned as an example; and it seems
also that what immediately follows is added as an explanation — *ye
offer the lame and the blind and the mutilated*. Since these things are
connected together, I have no doubt but that God means by bread here
every kind of offering, and we know that the shew-bread was not offered
on the altar; but there was a table by itself appointed for this purpose
near the altar. And why God designates by bread all the sacrifices may
be easily explained; for God would have sacrifices offered to him as
though he had his habitation and table among the Jews; it was not indeed
his purpose to fill their minds with gross imaginations, as though he
did eat or drink, as we know that heathens have been deluded with such
notions; but his design was only to remind the Jews of that domestic
habitation which he had chosen for himself among them. But more on this
subject shall presently be said; I shall now proceed to consider the
words.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p25"></span>Ye offer on my altar polluted bread; and
ye have said, *In what have we polluted thee?* The priests again answer
as though God unjustly accused them; for they allege their innocency, as
the question is to be regarded here as a denial: *In what* then *have we
polluted thee?* They deny that they were rightly condemned, inasmuch as
they had duly served God. But we may hence conclude, according to what
has been before stated, that the people were under the influence of
gross hypocrisy, and had become hardened in their obstinacy. It is the
same at this day; though there be such a mass of crimes, which
everywhere prevails in the world, and even overflows the earth, yet no
one will bear to be condemned; for every one looks on others, and thus
when no less grievous sins appear in others, every one absolves himself.
This is then the sottishness which the Prophet again goads — *Ye have
said, In what have we polluted thee?* He and other Prophets no doubt
charged the Jews with this sacrilege — that they polluted the name of
God.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p26"></span>But it deserves to be known, that few
think that they pollute God and his name when they worship him
superstitiously or formally, as though they had to do with a child: but
we see that God himself declares, that the whole of religion is
profaned, and that his name is shamefully polluted when men thus trifle
with him.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p27"></span>He answers, *when ye said*, literally,
in your saying, *The table of Jehovah, it is contemptible*. Here the
Prophet discovers the fountain of their sin; and he shows as it were by
the finger, that they had despised those rites which belonged to the
worship of God. The reason follows, *If ye offer the blind*, he says,
*for sacrifice, it is no evil*. Some read the last clause as a question,
“is it not evil?” but he, the mark of a question, is not here; and we
may easily gather from the context that the Prophet as yet relates how
presumptuously both the priests and the whole people thought they could
be acquitted and obtain pardon for themselves, “It is no evil thing if
the lame be offered, if the blind be offered, if the maimed be offered;
there is nothing evil in all this.”  <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) We now then understand what the
Prophet means.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p31"></span>But the subject would have been obscure
had not a fuller explanation been given in these words, *The table of
Jehovah, it is contemptible*  <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md)
God does here show, as I have before stated, why he was so much
displeased with the Jews. Nothing is indeed so precious as his worship;
and he had instituted under the law sacrifices and other rites, that the
children of Abraham might exercise themselves in worshipping him
spiritually. It was then the same as though he had said, that he cared
nothing for sheep and calves, and for any thing of that kind, but that
their impiety was sufficiently manifested, inasmuch as they did not
think that the whole of religion was despised when they despised the
external acts of worship according to the law. God then brings back the
attention of the Jews from brute animals to himself, as though he had
said, “Ye offer to me lame and blind animals, which I have forbidden to
be offered; that you act unfaithfully towards me is sufficiently
apparent; and if ye say that these are small things and of no moment, I
answer, that you ought to have regarded the end for which I designed
that sacrifices should be offered to me, and ordered bread to be laid on
my table in the sanctuary; for by these tokens you ought to have known
that I live in the midst of you, and that whatever ye eat or drink is
sacred to me, and that all you possess comes to you through my bounty.
As then this end for which sacrifices have been appointed has been
neglected by you, it is quite evident that ye have no care nor concern
for true religion.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p33"></span>We now then perceive why the Prophet
objects to the priests, that they had called the table of Jehovah
contemptible; not that they had spoken thus expressly, but because they
had regarded it almost as nothing to pervert and adulterate the whole of
divine worship according to the law, which was an evidence of religion
when there was any.

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p34"></span>Now it may seem strange, that God one
while so strictly requires pure sacrifices and urges the observance of
them, when yet at another time he says that he does not seek sacrifices,
“Sacrifice I desire not, but mercy,” (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p34.1"></span>[Ho
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p34.1"></span>;) and again, “Have I commanded your fathers
when I delivered them from Egypt, to offer victims to me? With this
alone was I content, that they should obey my voice.” He says afterwards
in Micah,

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p35"></span>“Shall I be propitious to you if ye
offer me all your flocks? but rather, O man, humble thyself before thy
God.”  
(<span id="iv.ii.vii-p35.2"></span>[Mic
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p35.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p36"></span>The same is said in the fiftieth Psalm,
in the first and the last chapters of Isaiah, and in many other places.
Since then God elsewhere depreciates sacrifices, and shows that they are
not so highly esteemed by him, why does he now so rigidly expostulate
with the Jews, because they offered lame and maimed animals? I answer,
that there was a reason why God should by this reproof discover the
impiety of the people. Had all their victims been fat or well fed, our
Prophet would have spoken as we find that others have done; but since
their faithlessness had gone so far that they showed even to children
that they had no regard for the worship of God — since they had advanced
so far in shamelessness, it was necessary that they should be thus
convicted of impiety; and hence he says, *ye offer to me polluted
bread*, as though he had said, “I supply you with food, it was your duty
to offer to me the first-fruits, the tenths, and the shew-bread; and the
design of these external performances is, that they may regard
themselves as fed by me daily, and also that they may feed moderately
and temperately on the bread and flesh and other things given them, as
though they were sitting at my table: for when they see that bread made
from the same corn is before the presence of God, this ought to come to
their minds, ‘it is God’s will, as though he lived with us, that a
portion of the same bread should ever be set on the holy table:’ and
then when they offer victims, they are not only to be thus stirred up to
repentance and faith, but they ought also to acknowledge that all these
are sacred to God, for when they set before the altar either a calf, or
an ox, or a lamb, and then see the animal sacrificed, (a part of which
remains for the priests,) and the altar sprinkled with blood, they ought
to think thus within themselves, ‘Behold, we have all these things in
common with God, as though clothed in a human form he dwelt with us and
took the same food and the same drink.’ They ought then to have
performed in this manner their outward rites.”

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p37"></span>God now justly complains, that his table
was contemptible, as though he had said, that his favor was rejected,
because the people, as it were in contempt, brought coarse bread, as
though they wished to feed some swineherd, — a conduct similar to that
mentioned in Zechariah, when God said, that a reward was offered for him
as though he were some worthless hireling, (<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p37.1"></span>[Zec
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#012.md)<span
id="iv.ii.vii-p37.1"></span>) — “I have carefully fed you,” he says,”
and I now demand my reward: ye give for me thirty silverings, a mean and
disgraceful price.” So also in this place, *Ye have said, the table of
Jehovah*, it is polluted. There is an emphasis in the pronoun; for God
shows that he by no means deserved such a reproach: “Who am I, that ye
should thus despise my table? I have consecrated it, that ye might have
a near access to me, as though I dwelt in the visible sanctuary; but ye
have despised my table as though I were nothing.”

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p38"></span>He afterwards adds, *Offer this now to
thy governor; will he be pleased with thee?* God here complains that
less honor is given to him than to mortals; for he adduces this
comparison, “When any one owes a tribute or tax to a governor, and
brings any thing maimed or defective, he will not receive it.” Hence he
draws this inference, that he was extremely insulted, for the Jews dared
to offer him what every mortal would reject. He thus reasons from the
less to the greater, that this was not a sacrilege that could be borne,
as the Jews had so presumptuously abused his kindness; and hence he
subjoins

<span id="iv.ii.viii"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.ii.viii-p5"></span><span id="iv.ii.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.viii-p6"></span>He wounds here the priests more
grievously, — because they had so degenerated as to be wholly unworthy
of their honorable office and title; “Go,” he says, “and *entreat the
face of God*.” All this is ironical; for interpreters are much mistaken
who think that the Prophet here exhorts the priests humbly to ask pardon
from God, both for themselves and for the people. On the contrary, he
addresses them, as I have said, ironically, while telling them to be
intercessors and mediators between God and the people; and yet they were
profane men, who on their part polluted the whole worship of God, and
thus subverted the whole of religion: go thou and *entreat*, he says,
*the face of God*. This duty, we know, was enjoined on the priests; they
were to draw nigh to the sanctuary and present themselves before God as
though they were advocates pleading the cause of the people, or at least
intercessors to pacify God. Since then they were in this respect the
types of Christ, it behoved them to strive themselves to be holy; and
though the people abandoned themselves to all kinds of wickedness, it
yet became the priests to devote themselves with all reverence to the
duties of their calling; and as God had preferred them to their
brethren, they ought especially to have consecrated themselves to him
with all fear; for the more excellent their condition was, the more
eminent ought to have been their piety and holiness. Justly then does
the Prophet here inveigh so severely against them, because they did not
consider that they were honored with the priesthood, that they might
entreat God, and thus pacify his wrath, and reconcile to him miserable
men: Go, he says, and *entreat the face of God*; forsooth! *he will
accept your face*. We now understand the real meaning of the Prophet.

<span id="iv.ii.viii-p7"></span>*And now*, he says, *he will have mercy
on us*. Here also the Prophet derides them, because they boasted that
they could prevail through their own high dignity to render God
propitious; forsooth! he says, *he will have mercy on us*. But *this is
done by your hand*, *i.e., by you.* “Do ye raise up your hands to God?
and will he on seeing you be pacified towards you? As then ye are
polluted, ye are unworthy of the honor and office, in which ye so
proudly glory.”

<span id="iv.ii.viii-p8"></span>He does not however, as we have already
said, extenuate the fault of the people, and much less does he exempt
them from guilt who were implicated in the same crimes; but he shows
that the state of things was wholly desperate; for the common people
disregarded God, and the priests, neglecting to make any distinctions,
received every sort of victims, only that they might not be in want: he
shows them that the state of the people was extremely bad, as there was
no one who could, according to what his office required, pacify God.
*Will he* then *receive your face*? The Prophet seems to allude to the
person of the Mediator; for as Christ had not as yet appeared, when the
priest presented himself before the altar, it was the same as though God
looked on the face of one, and became thus propitious to all. On this
account he says, that the priests were not worthy that God should look
on them, since they had polluted his sanctuary and corrupted his whole
service.  <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) For the same purpose
he subjoins —

<span id="iv.ii.ix"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ix-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.ix-p1.1"></span>[Malachi

<span id="iv.ii.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.ii.ix-p5"></span><span id="iv.ii.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ix-p6"></span>He goes on with the same subject, — that
the priests conducted themselves very shamefully in their office, and
that the people had become hardened through their example, so that the
whole of religion was disregarded. Hence he says, that the *doors* were
not closed by them. Some interpreters connect the two things together —
that they closed not the doors of the temple, nor kindled the altar for
nothing; and thus they apply the adverb, <span
id="iv.ii.ix-p6.1"></span>חנם, *chenam*, to both clauses; as though he
had said, that they were hirelings, who did not freely devote themselves
to serve God, but looked for profit and gain in everything: and this is
the commonly received explanation.  <span
id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) But it seems better to me to take them
separately and to say, Who does even shut the doors? not however for
nothing, and the copulative, <span id="iv.ii.ix-p10.3"></span>ו, *vau*,
as in many other places, may be rendered *even*: and yet *ye kindle not
for nothing my altar*; as though God had said, “I have fixed your works;
ye are then to me as hired servants; and now since I have ordered a
reward to be given to you whenever ye stand at my altar, why do ye not
close my door?” Some render <span id="iv.ii.ix-p10.4"></span>חנם,
*chenam*, in vain, and give this explanation “Who closes the doors? then
kindle not afterwards in vain my altar;” as though God rejected the
whole service, which had been corrupted by the avarice or the sloth of
the priests, and by the presumption of the people.

<span id="iv.ii.ix-p11"></span>It is indeed certain that it is better to
separate the two clauses so that the adverb, <span
id="iv.ii.ix-p11.1"></span>חנם, *chenam*, may be confined to the letter;
but there may yet, as I have said, be a two-fold meaning. If we render,
<span id="iv.ii.ix-p11.2"></span>חנם, *chenam*, in vain the import is
that the Prophet declares that they labored to no purpose while they
thus sacrificed to God contrary to his law for they ought to have
attended especially to the rule prescribed to them: as then they
despised this, he justly says, “Offer not to me in vain;” and thus the
future tense is to be taken for the imperative, as we know is the case
sometimes in Hebrew.

<span id="iv.ii.ix-p12"></span>But no interpreter seems to have
sufficiently considered the reason why the Prophet speaks of not closing
the doors of the temple. The priests, we know were set over the temple
for this reason — that nothing polluted might be admitted; for there
were of the Levites some doorkeepers, and others stood at the entrance;
in short, all had their stations: and then when they had brought in the
victim it was the office of the priests to examine it and to see that it
was such as the law of God required. As then it was their special office
to see that nothing polluted should be received into the temple of God,
he justly complains here that they indiscriminately received what was
faulty and profane: hence he rightly declares (for this seems to me to
be the true exposition) “Offer not in vain.” He then draws the
conclusion, that the priests lost all their labor in thus sacrificing,
because God would not have his name profaned, and justly preferred
obedience to all sacrifices. He therefore denies that they did any good
in slaying victims, because they ought in the first place to have
attended to this — not to change anything in God’s word and not to
deviate from it in the least. But I cannot now proceed farther.

<span id="iv.ii.x"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xi"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xi-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Seventy-second

<span id="iv.ii.xi-p2"></span>I could not yesterday finish the complaint
which God made against the priests — that no one of them closed the
doors of the temple, so that it might continue pure from all
defilements; for as their avarice was insatiable, they indiscriminately
admitted all sorts of profanations: hence he comes to this conclusion —
“Offer not hereafter in vain;” for by saying, *Kindle not my altar*, he
means that they spent their toil to no purpose in offering sacrifices,
because God required his worship to be performed according to the
prescription of his law. I omit now the two other expositions I
mentioned yesterday; for it seems to me that the Prophet meant, that the
priests wearied themselves in vain while daily offering victims, because
the Lord repudiated their service as impure and vicious.

<span id="iv.ii.xi-p3"></span>He now adds, *I am not pleased with you*,
 <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) *and an offering I will not
accept from your hand*. In the first clause he says that they were not
approved by God, or did not please him; and then he adds, that their
offerings were rejected; for where there is no pure heart, there we know
all works are impure. For we must remember what Moses says — that Abel
pleased God together with his sacrifices, (<span
id="iv.ii.xi-p4.1"></span>[Ge 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.ii.xi-p4.1"></span>;) and we have seen in another Prophet, that
is Haggai, that what is highly esteemed by men is an abomination to God,
when he is not worshipped in sincerity and truth, (<span
id="iv.ii.xi-p4.2"></span>[Hag
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#015)<span id="iv.ii.xi-p4.2"></span>.md).
Our Prophet now means the same thing — *I am not pleased with you, and I
regard not as acceptable the victims from your hand*. It now follows

<span id="iv.ii.xii"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>[Malachi

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p5"></span><span id="iv.ii.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p6"></span>Here God shows that he no longer cared
for the Jews, for he would bid altars to be reared for him everywhere
and through all parts of the world, that he might be purely worshipped
by all nations. It is indeed a remarkable prophecy as to the calling of
the Gentiles; but we must especially remember this, — that whenever the
Prophets speak of this calling, they promise the spread of God’s worship
as a favor to the Jews, or as a punishment and reproach.

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p7"></span>The Prophets then promised to the Jews
that the Gentiles would become allied to them; so does Zechariah,

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p8"></span>“In that day lay hold shall ten men on
the skirt of the garment, and will say to a Jew, Be thou our leader; for
the same God with thee will we worship.” (<span
id="iv.ii.xii-p8.1"></span>[Zec
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.ii.xii-p8.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p9"></span>It would have been then the highest honor
to the Jews had they become teachers to all nations, so as to instruct
them in true religion. So also Isaiah says, that is, that those who were
before aliens would become the disciples of the chosen people, so that
they would willingly submit to their teaching. But as the Jews have
fallen from their place, the Gentiles have succeeded and occupied their
position. Hence it is that the Prophets when speaking of the calling of
the Gentiles, often denounce it as a punishment on the Jews; as though
they had said, that when they were repudiated there would be other
children of God, whom he would substitute in their place, according to
what Christ threatened to the men of his age,

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p10"></span>“Taken away from you shall be the
kingdom of God, and shall be given to another nation.” (<span
id="iv.ii.xii-p10.1"></span>[Mt
21:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#043.md)<span
id="iv.ii.xii-p10.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p11"></span>Such is this prophecy: for our Prophet
does not simply open to the Gentiles the temple of God, to connect them
with the Jews and to unite them in true religion; but he first excludes
the Jews, and shows that the worship of God would be exercised in common
by the Gentiles, for the doctrine of salvation would be propagated to
the utmost extremities of the earth.

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p12"></span>This difference ought to be noticed,
which interpreters have not observed, and yet it is what is very
necessary to be known; and for want of knowing this has it happened that
passages wholly different have been indiscriminately blended together.
The Prophet then does not here promise, as we have often stated in other
places, that the whole world would be subject to God, so that true
religion would everywhere prevail, but he brands the Jews with reproach,
as though he had said, “God has repudiated you, but he will find other
sons for himself, who will occupy your place.” He had repudiated in the
last verse their sacrifices, and we know how haughtily the Jews gloried
in the holiness of their race. As then they were inflated with so much
pride, they thought that God would be no God except he had them as his
holy Church. The Prophet here answers them, and anticipates their
objection by saying, that God’s name would be celebrated through the
whole world: “Ye are a few people, all the nations will unite in one
body to worship God together; God then will not stand in need of you,
and after he rejects you his kingdom will not decay. Ye indeed think
that his kingdom cannot be safe, and that his glory will perish except
he is worshipped by you; but I now declare to you, that the worship of
God will flourish everywhere, even after he shall cast you out of his
family.”

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p13"></span>We now then see what the Prophet means
when he says, that *Great will be the name of God from the rising to the
setting of the sun*  <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) It is
simply said in <span id="iv.ii.xii-p16.1"></span>[Ps
113:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.ii.xii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p17"></span>“From the rising to the setting of the
sun wonderful shall be the name of God.”

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p18"></span>There indeed it is only a promise, but
here the Prophet includes the punishment which the Jews had deserved, as
though he had said, that after they were rejected by God on account of
their ingratitude, the Gentiles would become holy to God, because he
would adopt them instead of that wicked and ungodly people.

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p19"></span>But I have said, that the calling of the
Gentiles is here clearly proved, or may with certainty be elicited from
this prophecy, for this reason, because the name of God cannot be great
without the teaching of the truth. It is therefore the same thing as
though the Prophet had said, that the law which had been given to the
Jews would be proclaimed among all nations, so that true religion might
spread everywhere: for the basis of true religion is to know how he is
to be worshipped by us, inasmuch as obedience is better than all
sacrifices. And it is necessary always to begin with this principle — to
know the God whom we worship: and hence Christ himself, in the fourth
chapter of John, condemns all the religions which then prevailed in the
world, because men presumptuously worshipped gods devised by themselves.
Since then it is necessary that the worship of God should be based on
the truth, then God declares that his name would become renowned in
every place, he doubtless shows that his law would be known to all
nations, so that his will might be known everywhere, which is, as we
have said, the only rule of true religion.

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p20"></span>He afterwards adds — *Everywhere shall
be offered incense to my name, and a clean offering*. Why? Because *my
name shall be great*. The repetition is not useless; for it was a thing
then incredible, inasmuch as God had not in vain separated the Jews from
the rest of the world; nor was it an ordinary commendation, when Moses
said in the fourth chapter of Deuteronomy — “Show me a nation to whom
God draws nigh as lie does to you: this then is your nobility and your
excellency, to have a God nigh and friendly to you.” Hence also it is
said in <span id="iv.ii.xii-p20.1"></span>[Ps
147:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.ii.xii-p20.1"></span> —

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p21"></span>“He has not done thus to other nations;
his judgments has he not made known to them.”

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p22"></span>It was then the peculiar privilege of
the race of Abraham that God was known and worshipped by them. The very
novelty, then, of what is here said might have closed the door against
this prophecy; and this is the reason why the Prophet repeatedly
confirms what it was then difficult to believe — *the name of God, he
says, shall be great in every place*

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p23"></span>We must also bear in mind that God
cannot be rightly worshipped except he is known, which Paul confirms
when he says — “How shall they call on him in whom they have not
believed?” for except the truth shines forth, we shall grope like the
blind, and wander through devious ways. There is therefore no religion
approved by God except what is based on his word.

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p24"></span>Moreover the Prophet, by <span
id="iv.ii.xii-p24.1"></span>מנחה, *meneche*, offering, and by incense,
means the worship of God; and this mode of speaking is common in the
Scriptures, for the Prophets who were under the law accommodated their
expressions to the comprehension of the people. Whenever then they
intend to show that the whole world would come to the faith and true
religion — “An altar,” they say, “shall be built to God;” and by altar
they no doubt meant spiritual worship, and not that after Christ’s
coming sacrifices ought to be offered. For now there is no altar for us;
and whosoever builds an altar for himself subverts the cross of Christ,
on which he offered the only true and perpetual sacrifice.

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p25"></span>It then follows that this mode of
speaking ought to be so taken, that we may understand the analogy
between the legal rites, and the spiritual manner of worshipping God now
prescribed in the gospel. Though then the words of the Prophet are
metaphorical, yet their meaning is plain enough — that God will be
worshipped and adored everywhere. But what are the sacrifices of the New
Testament? They are prayers and thanksgivings, according to what the
Apostle says in the last chapter of the epistle to the Hebrews. There
was also under the law the spiritual worship of God, as it is especially
stated in the fiftieth psalm; but there were then shadows connected with
it, as it is intimated in these words of Christ —

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p26"></span>“Now is come the hour when the Father
shall be worshipped in spirit and in truth.”  
(<span id="iv.ii.xii-p26.2"></span>[Joh
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.ii.xii-p26.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p27"></span>He does not indeed deny that God was
worshipped in spirit by the fathers; but as that worship was concealed
under outward rites, he says that now under the gospel the simple, and,
so to speak, the naked truth is taught. What then the Prophet says of
offering and incense availed under the law; but we must now see what God
commands in his gospel, and how he would have us to worship him. We do
not find there any incense or sacrifices.

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p28"></span>This passage contains nothing else than
that the time would come when the pure and spiritual worship of God
would prevail in all places.

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p29"></span>And thus it appears how absurd are the
Papists, when they hence infer that God cannot be worshipped without
some kind of sacrifice; and on this ground they defend the impiety of
their mass, as though it were the sacrifice of which the Prophet speaks.
But nothing can be more foolish and puerile; for the Prophet, as we have
said, adopts a mode of speaking common in Scripture. And were we to
allow offering and incense to be taken here literally, how could, <span
id="iv.ii.xii-p29.1"></span>מנחה, *meneche*, offering, be the body and
blood of Christ? “Oh!” they say, “it is a sacrifice made of bread, and
wine was added. Oh! Christ has thus commanded.” But where has he said
“sacrifice?”  <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) They again deny
that it is bread? for they say that it is transubstantiated into the
body of Christ: now then it is not a sacrifice of bread, nor of fine
flour; for the form only, visible to the eyes, and without substance,
remains, as they imagine. There is in the meantime no reason for us
carefully to discuss a subject so clear; for as we have seen in Joel —

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p31"></span>“In the last days I will pour my Spirit
on all flesh, and prophesy shall your sons and your daughters; your old
men dreams shall dream, and your young men visions shall see.”  
(<span id="iv.ii.xii-p31.2"></span>[Joe
2:28](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.ii.xii-p31.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p32"></span>So also we find what is similar in this
place; for the Apostles, though not taught by visions, were yet we know
illuminated; and then visions were not given commonly at the
commencement of the gospel, nor dreams; they were indeed very rare
things. What then does Paul mean? For he speaks of the whole body of the
Church, as though he had said that all, from the least to the greatest,
would be Prophets. Did they become Prophets by visions and dreams, whom
God illuminated by the doctrine of the gospel? By no means. But Joel, as
I have said, accommodated what he said to the time of the law. So also
in this place the Prophet, by offering and incense, designates the
spiritual worship of God. Let us now proceed-

<span id="iv.ii.xiii"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p1"></span><span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p2"></span>**12.** But ye have profaned it, in that
ye say, The table of the LORD *is* polluted; and the fruit thereof,
*even* his meat, *is* contemptible.

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p3"></span>**12.** Et vos polluistis illud, quum
dicitis, Mensa Iehovae polluta est; et proventus ejus (vel, fructus;
alii vertunt, sermonem) contemptibilis cibus ejus.

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p5"></span><span id="iv.ii.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p6"></span>This verse may be confined to the
priests, or it may be extended to the whole people; for both views are
appropriate. As to my own view, I doubt not but that the Prophet here
reproves with additional severity the priests, and that at the same time
he extends his reproof to the people in general. We saw in our
yesterday’s lecture how religion had been polluted by the priests, and
how impiously they had profaned the worship of God: but this was the
general sin of the whole people, as we shall presently see. Let us then
know that the whole people, as well as the priests, are here reproved:
but as a crime in the priests was more grievous, they being the occasion
of sacrilege to others, the Prophet assails them in an especial manner,
*Ye*, he says, *have polluted my name*

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p7"></span>He gives a reason, and at the same time
enhances their guilt: for they might have complained, that God not only
put them on a level with the Gentiles, but also rejected them, and
substituted aliens in their place. He shows that God had a just cause
for disinheriting them, and for adopting the Gentiles as his children,
for they had polluted God’s name. He at the same time amplifies their
sin, when he says, “The Gentiles, by whom I have been hitherto despised,
and to whom my name was not made known, will soon come to the faith;
thus my name shall be great, it shall be reverently worshipped by all
nations; but ye have polluted it.” It was certainly very strange, that
the Jews, peculiarly chosen and illuminated by the doctrine of the Law,
so presumptuously polluted God’s worship, as though they despised him,
and that the Gentiles, being novices, rendered obedience to God as soon
as they tasted of the truth of religion, so that his glory became
through them illustrious.

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p8"></span>He afterwards shows how the name of Gog
was polluted, *Ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted*; that is, ye
distinguish not between what is sacred and profane: for he repeats what
we noticed yesterday, — that the Jews thought it a frivolous matter,
when the Prophets taught them that God was to be worshipped with all
reverence. It is not however probable, that they openly uttered such a
blasphemy as that the table of God was polluted; but it is easy to
conclude from what is said, that God’s table was profaned by them, for
they made no account of it. The holiness of the table ought to have been
so regarded by the Jews, as not to approach the sanctuary without true
repentance and faith; they ought to have known that they had to do with
God, and that his majesty ought to have deeply touched them. When
therefore they came to the temple, and brought with them their
uncleanness like swine, it was quite evident that they had no reverence
for the temple, or the altar, or the table. According to this sense then
are the words of the Prophet to be understood, — not that the Jews
openly mocked God, but that the holiness of the temple was with them of
no account.

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p9"></span>With regard to the *Table*, we stated
yesterday, that when God ordered sacrifices to be offered to him, it was
the same as though he familiarly dwelt among the Jews, and became as it
were their companion. It was the highest honor and an instance of God’s
ineffable goodness, that he thus condescended, so that the people might
know that he was not to be sought afar off. And for this reason the less
excusable was their impiety, as they did not consider that sacrifices
were celebrated on earth, that their minds might be raised up above the
heavens: for it is to this purpose that God descends to us, even to
raise us above, as we have elsewhere stated. It was then an extremely
base and shameful senselessness and stupidity in the Jews, that they did
not consider that God’s table was set among them, that they might by
faith penetrate into heaven, and know it to be even before their eyes.

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p10"></span>As to the words, *Its fruit is his
contemptible food*, we must observe, that some render, <span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p10.1"></span>ניב, *nib*, word, and bring this passage
from Isaiah, “I have created the fruit of the lips, peace, peace,”
(<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p10.2"></span>[Isa
57:19](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p10.2"></span>.) The verb, <span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p10.3"></span>נוב, *nub*, means to fructify; hence, <span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p10.4"></span>ניב, *nib*, is fruit or produce. Were we to
grant that it is metaphorically taken for word, yet I see no reason why
we should depart from its simple and real meaning. For first there will
be a relative without an antecedent, <span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p10.5"></span>ניבו, *nibu*, his word; and then there will
be a change of number; for they apply it to the priests, his word, that
is, the word of them — of whom? of the priests. It is common, I know, in
Hebrew, to put a relative without an antecedent; but as I have said,
nothing requires this here. The most suitable rendering then is, *Its
provision*, that is, of the altar, *is the contemptible food* of God.
 <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) I take then the words to mean
this, that a speech of this kind was often in the mouth of the people as
well as of the priests, — “Oh! the provision for the altar is any kind
of meat; be not so anxious in your choice, so as to offer the best
animals; for God is satisfied even with the lean and the maimed.”

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p17"></span>And here again God reproves the impiety
and contempt of the people; and at the same time he condemns their
avarice, because they took the worst of their animals to offer in the
temple, as though they lost everything they consecrated to God.

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p18"></span>Why he calls the sacrifices the *meat*
or food of God, we now sufficiently understand. Only this ought to be
observed, that the impiety of the people was evident, as they were so
unconcerned in their duties; for God had not in vain instituted
sacrifices and other rites. The contempt then of the signs openly showed
not only the negligence of the people, but also their contempt of all
religion. Were any one at this day to regard as nothing outward teaching
and the sacraments, would he not prove himself to be an impious despiser
of God? Yet religion, I allow, does not consist in these things; for
though hypocrites pretend the most ardent zeal, they yet profane the
name of God, whenever the truth sounds in their ears and the heart is
not touched, and when they come to the Lord’s table and are at the same
time alienated from Christ. These things I allow; but as no true servant
of God can despise these ordinances, which on account of our common
infirmity are useful to us, and without which we cannot be as long as we
sojourn in this world, whosoever derides our simplicity in frequenting
God’s house, or if silent abstains from doing so, and regards such a
practice as nothing or as unimportant, he is thus, as I have said,
proved guilty of impiety. This is the reason why the Prophet so sharply
reproves the Jews, because they said that the provision for the altar
was God’s contemptible food. It follows —

<span id="iv.ii.xiv"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p2"></span>**13.** Ye said also, Behold, what a
weariness *is it*! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts:
and ye brought *that which was* torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus
ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the
LORD.

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p3"></span>**13.** Et dixistis, Ecce fatigatio (alii
vertunt, Ecce ex fatigatione,) et sufflastis in illud, dicit Iehova
exercituum; et obtulistis raptum et claudum et debile; et obtulistis
Minchah (hoc est, oblationem;) an gratam hanc habebo e manu vestra,
dicit Iehova.

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p5"></span><span id="iv.ii.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p6"></span>He pursues the same subject — that the
worship of God was despised by them and regarded as almost worthless. We
must bear in mind what I have before stated — that the Jews are not
reprehended here as though they had openly and avowedly spoken
reproachfully of God’s worship; but that this was sufficiently evident
from their conduct; for they allowed themselves so much licentiousness,
that it was quite manifest that they were trifling with God, inasmuch as
they had cast off every fear of him and all reverence towards him.

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p7"></span>*Ye have said, Behold, labor*. This may
apply to the whole people, or to the priests alone. It is commonly
explained of the priests — that they complained that they had a hard
office, because they were continually in the temple and constantly
watched there, and were much occupied in cleaning the vessels.

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p8"></span>The monks at this day under the Papacy,
and the priests, boasting of themselves, say, “While all others sleep,
we are watching; for we are constant in prayers.” Forsooth! they howl at
midnight in their temples; and then by massing and by doing other
strange things they imagine that they are seriously engaged in pacifying
God. In this sense do some understand this passage, as though the
priests, in order to commend their work, alleged that they labored much
in God’s service, and as though God had enjoined on them many and
difficult things. But I prefer applying this to the whole people, and
yet I do not exclude the priests; for the Prophet here condemns both,
and shows that it was wearisome to them to spend labor in worshipping
God, that they considered it weariness, as we commonly say, *Tu le fais
par courvee*.  <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md)

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p14"></span>And the import of what follows is the
same, *Ye have snuffed at it*, that is, through disdain. Some give this
rendering, “With sorrow have ye moved him;” and the verb is in Hiphil,
and is often taken in this sense. The verb, <span
id="iv.ii.xiv-p14.1"></span>נפח, *nephech*, is properly to snuff; and it
is here in another conjugation; but even in Hiphil it has this meaning,
and cannot be taken otherwise. Now they who render it, to move or touch
with sorrow, are under the necessity of turning the words of the Prophet
to a sense the most foreign and remote, even that the priests, extremely
greedy of gain, compelled the common people to bring sacrifices, and
thus extorted sacrifices, but not without sorrow and lamentation. We see
how forced this is: I therefore wholly reject it. Some have hammered out
a very refined sense, which is by no means suitable, “Ye have snuffed at
it,” that is, Ye have said indeed that the victims are good and
sufficiently fat; and yet ye may by breath blow them into the air.
Others render it, to cast down, because they threw the sacrifices on the
ground. But what need there is of departing from the common meaning of
the word, since it is easy to conclude that both the priests and the
people are here condemned, because the worship of God was a weariness to
them, as we snuff at a thing when it displeases us. The behavior then of
the fastidious is what the Prophet meant here to express. The passage
will thus be very appropriate, Ye have said, *Behold weariness! Ye have
snuffed at it*: then he adds, —

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p15"></span>*Ye have offered the torn, and the lame,
and the weak*. These words prove the same thing — that they performed
their duty towards God in a trifling manner by offering improper
victims: when they had anything defective or diseased, they said that it
was sacred to God, as we find it stated in the next verse. Some
improperly render, <span id="iv.ii.xiv-p15.1"></span>גזול, *gazul*, a
prey, what had been unjustly procured, as though he had said, that they
offered victims obtained by plunder: but I wonder how they could thus
distort the words of the Prophet without any pretense. He mentions here
three kinds — the torn, the lame, and the maimed or the feeble. Who then
does not see that the torn was an animal which had been torn by wild
beasts? When therefore they had an animal half dead, having been torn by
wolves, they thought that they had a suitable victim: “I am constrained
to offer a sacrifice to God, this lamb is very suitable, for the wolf
has devoured a part of it, and it has hardly escaped: as then it is
maimed, I will bring it.” The Prophet then calls those torn victims
which had been lacerated by the teeth of wild beasts.

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p16"></span>We now understand the import of the
words; but we must remember what I have said — that God required not the
performance of external rites, because he had need of meat and drink, or
because he set a great value on these sacrifices, but on account of
their design. The sacrifices then which God demanded from his ancient
people had in themselves nothing that promoted true religion; nor could
the odour of sacrifices of itself delight God; but the end was to be
regarded. As then God ordered and commanded sacrifices to be offered to
him, that he might exercise his people in penitence and faith, it was
for this reason that he valued them. But when the people had fallen into
gross contempt of them, that they brought to God, as it were to insult
him, the maimed and the lame, their extremely base and intolerable
impiety, as I have already said, was made fully evident. This is the
reason why the Prophet now so vehemently chides the priests and the
whole people; they offered to God such sacrifices as man would have
rejected, according to what we noticed yesterday. It then follows —

<span id="iv.ii.xv"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xv-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>[Malachi
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#014.md)<span id="iv.ii.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xv-p2"></span>**14.** But cursed *be* the deceiver,

and my name *is* dreadful among the heathen.

long.

<span id="iv.ii.xvi"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xvi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="iv.ii.xvi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou dost
not keep us at this day under the shadows of the law, by which thou
didst train up the race of Abraham, but invitest us to a service far
more excellent, even to consecrate ourselves, body and soul, as victims
to thee, and to offer not only ourselves, but also sacrifices of praise
and of prayer, as thou hast consecrated all the duties of religion which
thou requirest from us, through Christ thy Son, — O grant, that we may
seek true purity, and labor to render, by a real sincerity of heart, our
services approved by thee, and so reverently profess and call upon thy
name, that really fulfilled in us may that be which thou best declared
by thy Prophet — that thy name shall be magnified and celebrated through
the whole world, as it was truly made known to us in the person of thine
only begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="iv.ii.xvii"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xvii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Seventy Third

<span id="iv.ii.xvii-p2"></span>I repeated yesterday the last verse of
the first chapter, but I did not explain it. The Prophet declares here,
that all who dealt deceitfully and unfaithfully with God were under a
curse; and at the same time he specifies the kind of fraud practiced;
they chose from the flock such as were diseased or defective to offer as
sacrifices to God. It was indeed a proof of extreme dishonesty thus
perversely to mock God: for as we have seen no man would bear such an
insult. Then the Prophet, in order at once to complete what he had
begun, distinctly says, that they were *all accursed*

<span id="iv.ii.xvii-p3"></span>The verb, <span
id="iv.ii.xvii-p3.1"></span>נכל, *necal*, means in Hebrew, to think; but
it is taken almost at all times in a bad sense: hence interpreters have
not improperly rendered it here, deceitful; but the deceit the Prophet
meant to express is of this kind — when men craftily contrive for
themselves vain pretences; for when they can cover their baseness before
the world, they think that they are at the same time absolved in heaven.
The Prophet then says, that they who think that they can escape God’s
judgment by such artifices are under a curse.

<span id="iv.ii.xvii-p4"></span><span id="iv.ii.xvii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xvii-p5"></span>I come now to the kind of fraud they
practiced, *If there be, he says, in his flock a male, that is, a lamb
or a ram, when he vows, then what is corrupt he offers to Jehovah*. He
then means, that though they pretended some religion, yet nothing was
done by them with a sincere and honest heart; for they immediately
repented of the vow made to God; they thought that they might be reduced
to poverty, if they were too bountiful in their sacrifices. Hence then
the Prophet proves that they offered to God with a double mind, and that
whatever they thus offered was polluted, because it did not proceed from
a right motive.

<span id="iv.ii.xvii-p6"></span>We said yesterday, that the Prophet did
not require fat or lean beasts, because God valued either the blood or
flesh of animals on its own account, but for the end in view; for these
were the performances of religion by which God designed to train up the
Jews for the end contemplated, and in the duty of repentance. As then
they were so sordid as to these sacrifices, it was easy to conclude,
that they were gross and profane despisers of God, and had no concern
for religion.

<span id="iv.ii.xvii-p7"></span>The reason follows, *For a great king am
I, saith Jehovah, and my name is terrible*  <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) *among the nations*. God declares here
that his majesty was of no account among the Jews, as though he had
said, “With whom do you think that you have to do?” And this is what we
ought carefully to consider when engaged in God’s service. We indeed
know that it is a vice which has prevailed in all ages, that all nations
and individuals thought that they worshipped God, when they devised
foolish and frivolous rites according to their own fancies. If then we
have a desire to worship God aright, we must remember how great he is;
for his majesty will raise us up above the whole world, and cease will
that audacity which possesses almost all mankind; for they think that
their own will is a law, when they presumptuously obtrude anything on
God. The greatness of God then ought to humble us, that we may not
worship him according to the perceptions of our flesh, but offer him
only what is worthy of his celestial glory.

<span id="iv.ii.xvii-p9"></span>He again repeats what we have before
observed, though it was disregarded by the Jews, — that he was a *great
king* through the whole world. As then the Jews thought that sacrifices
could not be offered to God, such as he would accept, in any other place
but at Jerusalem, and in the temple on Mount Sion, he testifies that he
is a great king even in the farthest parts of the world. It hence
follows, that God’s worship would not be confined to Judea, or to any
other particular part of the world; for by the gospel the Lord would
receive to himself all nations, and come into the possession of his
kingdom. Now follows

<span id="fn_201"></span>[202](cc30020.htm#fr_201.md) <span
id="iv.ii.ii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p21"></span> The order of the words in the original
gives a peculiar emphasis to the sentence —

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p22"></span>Was it not a brother that Esau was to
Jacob?

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p23"></span>The *Welsh* will express it word for word
—

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p24"></span><span id="iv.ii.ii-p24.1"></span>*Onid
brawd* oedd *Esau i Jacob?*

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p25"></span>These two verses may be thus rendered —

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p26"></span>**2.** “I have loved you,” saith Jehovah;
But ye say, “How hast thou loved us?”— “Was not Esau a brother to
Jacob,” saith Jehovah?

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p27"></span>**3.** “Yet I loved Jacob, and Esau I
hated; And I have set his mountains a waste, And his heritage for the
serpents of the desert.”

<span id="iv.ii.ii-p28"></span> — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_202"></span>[203](cc30020.htm#fr_202.md) <span
id="iv.ii.vii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p28"></span> It is rather an ironical language, as
it will appear from the following literal version —

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p29"></span>**8.** And when ye bring the blind for a
sacrifice, no evil! And when ye bring the lame and the sick, no evil!
Offer, it, I pray, to thy governor; Will he be pleased with thee or
accept thy person, Saith Jehovah of hosts?

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p30"></span>The whole is in the strain of irony; and
the first lines are much more striking than when the interrogative
particle is introduced. So is the rendering of the *Septuagint*, <span
id="iv.ii.vii-p30.1"></span>οὐ κακὸν — no evil. It was the *Targum* that
introduced the interrogative form. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_203"></span>[204](cc30020.htm#fr_203.md) <span
id="iv.ii.vii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.vii-p32"></span> So ought this sentence to be rendered;
and it is thus rendered by *Newcome*, only for “contemptible” he has
“despicable,” while *Henderson* retains the former, as it is in our
version. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_204"></span>[205](cc30020.htm#fr_204.md) <span
id="iv.ii.viii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.viii-p9"></span> It is generally admitted that this
verse is ironical. The second line has been differently interpreted:
some regard the impure sacrifices before mentioned as being referred to,
“from your hand have these come,” following the *Septuagint*, where
<span id="iv.ii.viii-p9.1"></span>זאת is rendered “<span
id="iv.ii.viii-p9.2"></span>ταυτα — these:” but the most obvious meaning
is that given by *Calvin*, that the sentence is a concession as to what
the priests are ironically exhorted to do. I give the following version,
—

<span id="iv.ii.viii-p10"></span>And now, intreat now God’s face that he
may favor us; By you (*literally* by your hand) has this been done: Will
he on your account lift up the face? Saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="iv.ii.viii-p11"></span>To “lift up the face” is to show favor.
The words seem to be spoken by the Prophet, and by saying, “saith
Jehovah,” at the end, he identifies what he says with the mind of God,
as though he said that what he addressed to them was communicated to him
from above. Instead of <span id="iv.ii.viii-p11.1"></span>מכם, “on your
account,” some MS., have <span id="iv.ii.viii-p11.2"></span>לכם, “for
you,” or “for your sake.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_205"></span>[206](cc30020.htm#fr_205.md) <span
id="iv.ii.ix-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ix-p7"></span> Adopted by *Jerome*, *Cyril*, and in our
version, and by *Henry*, *Scott*, *Adam Clarke*, and *Henderson*. But
*Marckius* takes another view, previously taken by *Drusius*, *Gataker*,
and *Cocceius*, according to the following version —

<span id="iv.ii.ix-p8"></span>Who is there moreover among you? let him
even close the doors, That ye may not kindle my altar in vain.

<span id="iv.ii.ix-p9"></span>“What he seems to say is this,” observes
*Drusius*, “I wish there were some one so inflamed by a pious zeal, as
to close the doors, and thus to exclude all unlawful sacrifices.” To
kindle or light the altar was to light the fire under it to consume the
sacrifice. The *Targum* favors “in vain,” or to no purpose, “Offer ye
not on my altar an execrable oblation.” The word <span
id="iv.ii.ix-p9.1"></span>הכם is used in both senses — “for nothing” or
without gain, <span id="iv.ii.ix-p9.2"></span>[Ge
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#015.md)<span id="iv.ii.ix-p9.2"></span>;
<span id="iv.ii.ix-p9.3"></span>[Ex
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.ii.ix-p9.3"></span>,—and “in vain” or uselessly, <span
id="iv.ii.ix-p9.4"></span>[Pr
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#027.md)<span id="iv.ii.ix-p9.4"></span>;
<span id="iv.ii.ix-p9.5"></span>[Eze
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#010.md)<span id="iv.ii.ix-p9.5"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.ix-p10"></span>It is difficult to know which of these
views is the right one. What seems against our version is the negative
<span id="iv.ii.ix-p10.1"></span>לא in the second line. The sense given
would be better brought out without it; and so *Jerome* leaves it out in
his explanation. The form also of the sentence being changed renders it
improbable that <span id="iv.ii.ix-p10.2"></span>חנם belongs to the
former clause. The version of *Drusius* comes nearest to the original,
and is countenanced by the *Septuagint* and the *Targum*. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_206"></span>[207](cc30020.htm#fr_206.md) <span
id="iv.ii.xi-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xi-p4"></span> Literally it is — “Not to me *is* delight
in you,” *i.e.*, I have no delight in you. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_207"></span>[208](cc30020.htm#fr_207.md) <span
id="iv.ii.xii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p14"></span> The verse begins with <span
id="iv.ii.xii-p14.1"></span>כי, which *Calvin* suggests may be rendered
“<span id="iv.ii.xii-p14.2"></span>certe — surely,” or verily; and this
would be most suitable here —

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p15"></span>Verily, from the rising of the sun to it
setting, Great *shall be* my name among the nations; And in every place
incense *shall be* brought To my name, and a pure offering: Verily,
great *shall* be my name Among the nations, saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p16"></span>The *Septuagint* render the first part
as past, “glorified has been my name;” and the second in the present,
“is brought.” But the future is intended, as the last verb is in that
tense, “I will not accept:” for when there is no verb in a sentence, and
the auxiliary verb is understood, as is often the case in Hebrew, the
tense is regulated by the context. “I will not accept your offering, but
an offering shall be brought to me,” and has been or is, but shall be. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_208"></span>[209](cc30020.htm#fr_208.md) <span
id="iv.ii.xii-p29.2"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xii-p30"></span> As an instance of a gradual deviation
from the truth, *Justin Martyr*, in the second century, rendered the
word “incense,” <span id="iv.ii.xii-p30.1"></span>θυσια, a sacrifice,
while in the *Septuagint* it is <span
id="iv.ii.xii-p30.2"></span>θυμιαμα, incense.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[210](cc30020.htm#fr_209.md) <span
id="iv.ii.xiii-p10.6"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p11"></span> And what is offered thereon, *even*
its food, is despicable.—*Newcome*. This is nearly the version of the
*Septuagint*.

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p12"></span>*And its fruit, even his food, is
contemptible.*—Henderson

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p13"></span>*The table of Jehovah, polluted it is
and his (or, its) fruit; contemptible is his (or, its) food.*—Marckius

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p14"></span>The last comes nearest to the original,
and is the most obvious construction. The verse may be thus rendered:

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p15"></span>But ye profane it by saying,  
“The table of Jehovah, Polluted is it and its fruit,  
Contemptible is its food.”

<span id="iv.ii.xiii-p16"></span> — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_210"></span>[211](cc30020.htm#fr_210.md) <span
id="iv.ii.xiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p9"></span> Variety of meanings has been given to
the word <span id="iv.ii.xiv-p9.1"></span>מתלאה *Calvin* takes it as one
word with two letters added to <span id="iv.ii.xiv-p9.2"></span>לאה, to
be weary or tired. But *Drusius*, *Marckius*, *Parkhurst*, *Henderson*,
and others, regard it as a contraction for <span
id="iv.ii.xiv-p9.3"></span>מה and <span id="iv.ii.xiv-p9.4"></span>תלאה,
according to some other instances in Hebrew, and render it “What
weariness!” and this corresponds with the context more than any other
view. The *Septuagint* and the *Targum* considered the <span
id="iv.ii.xiv-p9.5"></span>מ as a preposition, and this mistake has been
followed by *Jerome* and the fathers, and also by *Grotius* and
*Newcome*. “Behold, from weariness,” or from labor, or from affliction:
and it has been regarded as an excuse made by the priests on account of
their poor and depressed condition. But there is nothing to countenance
this notion in the context.

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p10"></span>*Calvin* adopted the past tense in this
and the preceding verse, and so has *Henderson*; but *Marckius* and
*Newcome*, with more correctness, render the verbs in the present tense,
for they are all in this verse preceded by a conversive <span
id="iv.ii.xiv-p10.1"></span>ו, *vau*; and the last line shows that the
present time is intended, —

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p11"></span>**13.** And ye say, “What weariness!”
And ye snuff at it, saith Jehovah of hosts; And ye bring the torn, and
the lame, and the sick, When ye bring an offering: Shall I accept it
from your hand, saith Jehovah?

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p12"></span>There are two evils ascribed to the
priests—they were discontented with their office and performed it as a
drudgery — and they allowed forbidden victims to be offered.

<span id="iv.ii.xiv-p13"></span>“Offering,” <span
id="iv.ii.xiv-p13.1"></span>מנחה, signifies a gift or a present, whether
a victim or meat-offering. See <span id="iv.ii.xiv-p13.2"></span>[Ge
4:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.ii.xiv-p13.2"></span>. Here evidently it comprehends “the torn,”
“the lame,” etc., as it is clear from the words, “Shall I accept it?”
that is, the offering, including those specified; for if it meant a
meat-offering, as some suppose, non-acceptance would be confined to it
alone. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_211"></span>[212](cc30020.htm#fr_211.md) <span
id="iv.ii.xvii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii.xvii-p8"></span> Rendered “illustrious — <span
id="iv.ii.xvii-p8.1"></span>επιφανὲς,” by the *Septuagint*, —
“powerful,” by the *Targum*, — “dreadful — horrible,” by *Jerome*, —
“terrible — terrible,” by *Marckius*, — “shall be feared,” by
*Henderson*, — “shall be had in reverence,” by *Newcome*, and the same
with *Drusius*, “<span id="iv.ii.xvii-p8.2"></span>reverendum.” The word
is literally “to be feared,” <span id="iv.ii.xvii-p8.3"></span>נורא; it
is often rendered “terrible,” what causes dread or terror. Some take the
present tense, “my name is terrible,” *i.e.*, is dreaded on account of
my greatness, manifested by my judgments. But if we take the future,
then we must render the words — “my name shall be feared” or reverenced.
— *Ed.*
