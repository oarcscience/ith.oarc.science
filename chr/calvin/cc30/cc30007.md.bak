<span id="iii.v-p1"></span>Chapter 4.

<span id="iii.v.i"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i-p1"></span><span id="iii.v.i-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.v.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i-p2"></span>**1.** And the angel that talked with me
came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,

<span id="iii.v.i-p3"></span>**1.** Et reversus et angelus**,** qui
loquebatur mecum**,** et excitavit me**,** quasi virum qui excitatur
(*vel***,** evigilat) a somno suo.

<span id="iii.v.i-p4"></span>**2.** And said unto me, What seest thou?
And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all *of* gold, with
a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes
to the seven lamps, which *are* upon the top thereof:

<span id="iii.v.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et dixit ad me**,** Quid tu vides?
et dixit**,** Video**,** et ecce candelabrum ex auro totum (*hoc
est***,** ex solido auro**,**) et pelvis super caput ejus; et septem
lucernae super ipsum; septem et septem infusoria lucernis**,** quae sunt
super caput ejus;

<span id="iii.v.i-p6"></span>**3.** And two olive trees by it, one upon
the right *side* of the bowl, and the other upon the left *side*
thereof.

<span id="iii.v.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et duae oleae super ipsum**,** una a
dextera pelvis**,** et una ad sinistram ejus.

<span id="iii.v.i-p8"></span>**4.** So I answered and spake to the angel
that talked with me, saying, What *are* these, my lord?

<span id="iii.v.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et respondit et dixi angelo**,** qui
loquebatur mecum**,** dicendo**,** Quid ista**,** Domine mi?

<span id="iii.v.i-p10"></span>**5.** Then the angel that talked with me
answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said,
No, my lord.

<span id="iii.v.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et respondit angelus**,** qui
loquebatur mecum**,** et dixit mihi**,** Annon cognoscis quid sint haec?
Et dixi**,** Non**,** Domine mi.

<span id="iii.v.i-p12"></span>**6.** Then he answered and spake unto me,
saying, This *is* the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by
might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts.

<span id="iii.v.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et respondit et dixit mihi
dicendo**,** Hic sermo Iehovae ad Zerubbabel**,** dicendo**,** Non in
exercitu**,** et non in fortitudine**,** sed in Spiritu meo**,** dicit
Iehova exercituum.

<span id="iii.v.i-p14"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.i-p15"></span><span id="iii.v.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i-p16"></span>Another vision is narrated here, — that a
candlestick was shown to the Prophet, on which there were seven lights.
He says that the candlestick was formed *all of gold*: and he says that
to the seven lamps there were as many cruses, (infusoria — pourers,) or,
as some think, there were seven cruses to each lamp: but the former view
is what I mostly approve, that is, that every lamp had its own cruse. He
further says, that there were two olive-trees, one on the right, the
other on the left hand, so that there was no deficiency of oil, as the
olive-trees were full of fruit. Since then there was a great abundance
of berries, the oil would not fail; and the lamps were continually
burning. This is the vision, and the explanation is immediately added,
for God declares that his Spirit was sufficient to preserve the Church
without any earthly helps, that is, that his grace would always shine
bright, and could never be extinguished.

<span id="iii.v.i-p17"></span>There is, moreover, no doubt but that God
set forth to Zechariah a figure and an image suitable to the capacities
of the people. The candlestick in the temple, we know, was made of gold;
we know also, that seven lamps were placed in the candlestick, for it
had six branches; and then there was the trunk of the candlestick. As
then the seven lamps shone always in the temple on the golden
candlestick, it was the Lord’s design here to show that this ceremonial
symbol was not superfluous or insignificant; for his purpose was really
to fulfill what he exhibited by the candlestick: and such analogy is to
be seen in many other instances. For it was not the Lord’s purpose
simply to promise what was necessary to be known; but he also designed
to add at the same time a confirmation by ceremonial types, that the
Jews might know that their labor was not in vain when they lighted the
lamps in the temple; for it was not a vain or a deceptive spectacle, but
a real symbol of his favor, which was at length to be exhibited towards
them. But we may more fully learn the design of the whole, by
considering the words, and each part in order.

<span id="iii.v.i-p18"></span>He says that the Angel *returned*; by
which we understand that God, without any request or entreaty on the
part of the Prophet, confirmed by a new prophecy what we have already
observed; for the Prophet confesses that he was as it were overcome with
astonishment, so that it was necessary to awake him as it were from
sleep. The Prophet was not therefore able to ask any thing of God when
under the influence of amazement; but God of his own free will came to
his aid, and anticipated his request. We hence see that the faithful
were not in one way only taught to entertain confidence as to the
restoration of the Church; but as there was need of no common
confirmation, many visions were given; and it must at the same time be
added, that though no one interposed, yet God was of his own self
solicitous about his Church, and omitted nothing that was necessary or
useful to support the faith of his people. And farther, as the Prophet
says that he was awakened by the Angel, let us learn, that except God
awakens us by his Spirit, torpor will so prevail over us, that we cannot
raise our minds above. Since God then sees that we are so much tied down
to the earth, he rouses us as it were from our lethargy. For if the
Prophet had need of such help, how much more have we, who are far below
him in faith? Nay, if he was earthly, are we not altogether earth and
ashes? It must yet be observed, that the Prophet was not so overwhelmed
with drowsiness as with astonishment; so that he was hardly himself, as
it is the case with men in an ecstasy.

<span id="iii.v.i-p19"></span><span id="iii.v.i-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i-p20"></span>The Prophet was also reminded to be
attentive to the vision — *What seest thou?* Then there was presented to
him a sight which we have described; but the Prophet by seeing could
have seen nothing, had he not been instructed by the Angel. We must also
observe, that this tardiness of the Prophet is useful to us; for we
hence more surely conclude, that nothing was represented without a
design; but that the whole was introduced for his benefit, though he
overlooked, as with closed eyes, what God showed to him by the Angel. We
then conclude that there was nothing done by chance, but that the
Prophet was really under a divine guidance, so that he might learn what
he was afterwards faithfully to deliver to others.

<span id="iii.v.i-p21"></span>The vision is then narrated — that a
candlestick of God was shown to him. The substance of the candlestick
was intended to set forth a mystery. It is indeed true that gold is
corruptible; but as we cannot otherwise understand what exceeds the
things of the world, the Lord, under the figure of gold, and silver, and
precious stones, sets forth those things which are celestial, and which
surpass in value the earth and the world. It was for this purpose that
God commanded a candlestick to be made of gold for him, not that he
needed earthly wealth or riches, or was pleased with them as men are,
whose eyes are captivated by the sight of gold and silver. We indeed
know that all these things are counted as nothing before God; but regard
was had in these symbols to this — that they might know that something
sublime and exalted was to be understood whenever they looked on the
golden candlestick. Hence by the gold the Prophet must have learnt, that
what was here set forth was not worthless or mean, but unusual and of
great importance.

<span id="iii.v.i-p22"></span>He afterwards says that there was a
*vessel*, or some render it a pot; but it was a round vessel, and it was
*on the top of the candlestick*; for the lamps burned on the very summit
of the candlestick. Now there was a pot or bowl; and here there was a
little difference between the candlestick of the temple and that of
which the Prophet speaks now; for in the candlestick of the temple there
were many pots or bowls, but here the Prophet says that there was but
one; and also that there were seven pourers or postings; for by this
term we may understand the very act of pouring, as well as the
instruments themselves. But it is better to refer this to the pourers,
which distilled the oil continually, that the wick might not become dry,
but gather always new strength. He says that there were seven pourers to
the lamps on the top;  <span id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) and also
that there were *two olive-trees*, which supplied new abundance, so that
the oil was always flowing.

<span id="iii.v.i-p24"></span><span id="iii.v.i-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i-p25"></span>We must now then enquire the meaning of
the vision. Many understand by the candlestick the Church; and this may
be allowed. At the same time I think that God here simply testified to
the Jews, that in having commanded them to set up a candlestick, he did
not appoint an empty, or a deceptive, but a real symbol. God no doubt
represented by the lamps the graces, or the various gifts of his Spirit;
yet the idea of a sevenfold grace is a mere fancy; for God did not
intend to confine to that number the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the
variety of which is manifold, even almost infinite. Hence the number
seven designates perfection, according to the common usage of Scripture.
God then intended by placing the candlestick in the midst of the temple,
to show that the grace of his Spirit always shines in his Church, not of
one kind only, but so that there was nothing wanting as to its
perfection. Some think that teachers are represented by the lamps; but
as I have already said, it is better to take a simple view of the
meaning than refinedly to philosophise on the subject. There is indeed
no doubt but that God pours forth his graces to illuminate his Church by
his ministers; this we find by experience; but what I have stated is
sufficient that God never forsakes his Church, but illuminates it with
the gifts of his Spirit; while yet the variety of these gifts is set
forth by the seven lamps. This is one thing.

<span id="iii.v.i-p26"></span><span id="iii.v.i-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i-p27"></span>It afterwards follows, that the Prophet
inquired of the Angel, *What does this mean?* We hence learn again, that
the Prophet was instructed by degrees, in order that the vision might be
more regarded by us; for if the Prophet had immediately obtained the
knowledge of what was meant, the narrative might be read by us with no
attention; we might at least be less attentive, and some might probably
think that it was an uncertain vision. But as the Prophet himself
attentively considered what was divinely revealed to him, and yet failed
to understand what God meant, we are hereby reminded that we ought not
to be indifferent as to what is here related; for without a serious and
diligent application of the mind, we shall not understand this prophecy,
as we are not certainly more clear-sighted than the Prophet, who had
need of a guide and teacher. There is also set before us an example to
be imitated, so that we may not despair when the prophecies seem obscure
to us; for when the Prophet asked, the Angel immediately helped his
ignorance. There is therefore no doubt but that the Lord will supply us
also with understanding, when we confess that his mysteries are hid from
us, and when conscious of our want of knowledge, we flee to him, and
implore him not to speak in vain to us, but to grant to us the knowledge
of his truth. The angel’s question to the Prophet, whether he understood
or not, is not to be taken as a reproof of his dullness, but as a
warning, by which he meant to rouse the minds of all to consider the
mystery. He then asked, *Art thou ignorant of what this means*, in order
to elicit from the Prophet a confession of his ignorance. Now if the
Prophet, when elevated by God’s Spirit above the world, could not
immediately know the purpose of the vision, what can we do who creep on
the earth, except the Lord supplies us with understanding? In short,
Zechariah again recommends to us the excellency of this prophecy, that
we may more attentively consider what God here declares.

<span id="iii.v.i-p28"></span><span id="iii.v.i-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i-p29"></span>He calls the angel his *Lord*, according
to the custom of the Jews; for they were wont thus to address those who
were eminent in power, or in anything superior. He did not call him Lord
with the intention of transferring to him the glory of God; but he thus
addressed him only for the sake of honor. And here again we are
reminded, that if we desire to become proficient in the mysteries of
God, we must not arrogate any thing to ourselves; for here the Prophet
honestly confesses his own want of knowledge. And let us not at this day
be ashamed to lie down at God’s feet, that he may teach us as little
children; for whosoever desires to be God’s disciple must necessarily be
conscious of his own folly, that is, he must come free from a conceit of
his own acumen and wisdom, and be willing to be taught by God.

<span id="iii.v.i-p30"></span><span id="iii.v.i-p30.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.i-p31"></span>Now follows the explanation the angel
gives this answer — *This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying*,
*etc*. Here the angel bears witness to what I have shortly referred to
that the power of God alone is sufficient to preserve the Church, and
there is no need of other helps. For he sets the Spirit of God in
opposition to all earthly aids; and thus he proves that God borrows no
help for the preservation of his Church, because he abounds in all
blessings to enrich it. Farther, by the word spirit we know is meant his
power, as though he had said, “God designs to ascribe to himself alone
the safety of his Church; and though the Church may need many things,
there is no reason why it should turn its eyes here and there, or seek
this or that help from men; for all abundance of blessings may be
supplied by God alone.” And *host* and *might*,  <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) being a part for the whole, are to be
taken for all helps which are exclusive of God’s grace. It is indeed
certain that God acts not always immediately or by himself, for he
employs various means, and makes use in his service of the ministrations
of men; but his design is only to teach us that we are very foolish,
when we look around us here and there, or vacillate, or when, in a word,
various hopes, and various fears, and various anxieties affect us; for
we ought to be so dependent on God alone, as to be fully persuaded that
his grace is sufficient for us, though it may not appear; nay, we ought
fully to confide in God alone, though poverty and want may surround us
on every side. This is the purport of the whole.

<span id="iii.v.i-p33"></span>But God intended also to show that his
Church is built up and preserved, not by human and common means, but by
means extraordinary and beyond all our hopes and all our thoughts. It is
indeed true, as I have just said, that God does not reject the labors of
men in building up and in defending his Church; but yet he seems as
though he were not in earnest when he acts by men; for by his own
wonderful power he surpasses what can be conceived by human thought. To
be reminded of this was then exceedingly necessary, when the Church of
God was despised, and when the unbelieving haughtily ridiculed the
miserable Jews, whom they saw to be few in number and destitute of all
earthly aids. As then there was nothing splendid or worthy of admiration
among the Jews, it was needful that what we find here should have been
declared to them — even that his own power was enough for God, when no
aid came from any other quarter. The same also was the design of what we
have noticed respecting the seven pourers and the olive-trees; for if
God had need of earthly helps, servants must have been at hand to pour
forth the oil; but there were seven pourers to supply the oil
continually. Wherefrom? even from the olive-trees. As then the trees
were fruitful, and God drew from them the oil by his hidden power, that
the lamps might never be dry, we hence clearly learn, that what was
exhibited is that which the angel now declares, namely, that the Church
was, without a host and without might, furnished with the gifts of the
Holy Spirit, and that in these there was a sufficient defense for its
preservation, in order that it might retain its perfect state and
continue in vigor and safety.

<span id="iii.v.i-p34"></span>When therefore we now see things in a
despairing condition, let this vision come to our minds — that God is
sufficiently able by his own power to help us, when there is no aid from
any other; for his Spirit will be to us for lamps, for pourers, and for
olive-trees, so that experience will at length show that we have been
preserved in a wonderful manner by his hand alone.

<span id="iii.v.i-p35"></span>We now then understand the design of the
Prophet, and the reason why this vision was shown to him — that the
faithful might be fully induced to entertain a firm hope as to that
perfect condition of the Church which had been promised; for no judgment
was to be formed of it according to earthly means or helps, inasmuch as
God had his own power and had no need of deriving any assistance from
others. And Zechariah says also, that this *word* was to *Zerubbabel*,
even that he might take courage and proceed with more alacrity in the
work of building the temple and the city. For Zerubbabel, we know, was
the leader of the people, and the Jews returned to their country under
his guidance; and in the work of building the city his opinion was
regarded by all, as peculiar honor belonged to him on account of his
royal descent. At the same time God addressed in his person the whole
people: it was the same as though the angel had said, “This word is to
the Church.” The head is here mentioned for the whole body, a part being
specified for the whole.

<span id="iii.v.i-p36"></span>Now as Zerubbabel was only a type of
Christ, we must understand that this word is addressed to Christ and to
all his members.

<span id="iii.v.i-p37"></span>Thus we must remember that all our
confidence ought to be placed on the favor of God alone; for were it to
depend on human aids, there would be nothing certain or sure. For God,
as I have said, withdraws from us whatever may add courage according to
the judgment of the flesh, in order that he may invite or rather draw us
to himself. Whenever, then, earthly aids fail us, let us learn to recumb
on God alone, *for it is not by a host or by might* that God raises up
his Church, and preserves it in its proper state; but this he does by
his Spirit, that is, by his own intrinsic and wonderful power, which he
does not blend with human aids; and his object is to draw us away from
the world, and to hold us wholly dependent on himself. This is the
reason why he says that the word was addressed to Zerubbabel. The rest I
shall consider tomorrow.

<span id="iii.v.ii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.ii-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="iii.v.ii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou shinest
on us by thy word, and showest to us the way of salvation, we may with
open eyes look on that light; and as we are blind also at mid-day, open
thou our eyes, and may the inward light of thy Spirit lead us to the
light of thy word, that we may not doubt but that thou alone art
sufficient to supply us with all those things which are necessary for
the enjoyment of celestial life, that by thus distilling on us
frequently and continually thou mayest refresh us, so that the light of
faith, which has been once kindled in our hearts by thy grace, may never
be extinguished, until at length we shall attain to that fullness which
has been laid up for us in heaven: and may we thus now in part be
satisfied with the measure of knowledge which thou hast given us, until
we shall at length see thee face to face, that being thus transformed to
thine image, we may enjoy the fullness of that glory into which Christ
our Lord has been received. — Amen.

<span id="iii.v.iii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Forty-second

<span id="iii.v.iv"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv-p1"></span><span id="iii.v.iv-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#007.md)<span id="iii.v.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv-p2"></span>**7.** Who *art* thou, O great mountain?
before Zerubbabel *thou shalt become* a plain: and he shall bring forth
the headstone *thereof with* shoutings, *crying,* Grace, grace unto it.

<span id="iii.v.iv-p3"></span>**7.** Quis tu mons magne coram
Zerubbabel? in planitiem; et educat lapidem capitis ejus**,**
clamores**,** gratia**,** gratia ei.

<span id="iii.v.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.iv-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv-p6"></span>Here the angel pursues the same subject
which we have been already explaining — that though the beginning was
small and seemed hardly of any consequence and importance, yet God would
act in a wonderful manner as to the building of the temple. But as this
was not only arduous and difficult, but also in various ways impeded,
the angel now says, that there would be no hindrance which God would not
surmount or constrain to give way. He compares to a mountain either the
Persian monarchy or all the hosts of enemies, which had then suddenly
arisen in various parts, so that the Jews thought that their return was
without advantage, and that they were deceived, as the event did not
answer to their wishes and hopes.

<span id="iii.v.iv-p7"></span>We now then perceive the design of the
Holy Spirit: as Satan attempted by various artifices to prevent the
building of the temple, the angel declares here that no obstacle would
be so great as to hinder the progress of the work, for God could
suddenly reduce to a plain the highest mountains. *What art thou, great
mountain?* The expression has more force than if the angel had simply
said, that all the attempts of enemies would avail nothing; for he
triumphs over the pride and presumption of those who then thought that
they were superior to the Jews: “Ye are,” he says, “like a great
mountain; your bulk is indeed terrible, and sufficient at the first view
not only to weaken, but also to break down the spirits; but ye are
nothing in all your altitude.”

<span id="iii.v.iv-p8"></span>But the text may be read in two ways,
“What art thou, great mountain? A plain before Zerubbabel;” or, “What
art thou, great mountain before Zerubbabel? A plain.” The latter
rendering is the best, and it is also what has been universally
received. And he says that this mountain was *before* Zerubbabel, that
is, in his presence, for it stood in opposition to him.

<span id="iii.v.iv-p9"></span>Now this doctrine may be fitly applied to
our age: for we see how Satan raises up great forces, we see how the
whole world conspires against the Church, to prevent the increase or the
progress of the kingdom of Christ. When we consider how great are the
difficulties which meet us, we are ready to faint and to become wholly
dejected. Let us then remember that it is no new thing for enemies to
surpass great mountains in elevation; but that the Lord can at length
reduce them to a plain. This, then, our shield can cast down and lay
prostrate whatever greatness the devil may set up to terrify us: for as
the Lord then reduced a great mountains to a plain, when Zerubbabel was
able to do nothing, so at this day, however boldly may multiplied
adversaries resist Christ in the work of building a spiritual temple to
God the Father, yet all their efforts will be in vain.

<span id="iii.v.iv-p10"></span>He afterwards adds, *He will bring forth
the stone of its top*. The relative is of the feminine gender, and must
therefore be understood of the building. Zerubbabel shall then bring
forth the stone, which was to be on the top of the temple. By the stone
of the top, I understand the highest, which was to be placed on the very
summit. The foundations of the temple had been already laid; the
building was mean and almost contemptible: it could not however be
advanced, since many enemies united to disturb the work, or at least to
delay it. Nevertheless the angel promises what he afterwards explains
more fully — that the temple would come to its completion, for
Zerubbabel was to bring forth and raise on high the stone of the top,
which was to be on the very summit of the temple.  <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) And then he subjoins, *shoutings, Grace,
grace, to it*; that is, God will grant a happy success to this stone or
to the temple. The relative here again is feminine; it cannot then be
applied to Zerubbabel, but to the temple or to the stone: it is however
more probable that the angel speaks of the temple. And he says that
there would be shoutings; for it was necessary to encourage the
confidence of the faithful and to excite them to prayer, that they might
seek, by constant entreaties, a happy and prosperous issue to the
building of the temple. The angel, then, bids all the godly with one
voice to pray for the temple; but as all prosperous events depend on the
good pleasure of God, he uses the word <span
id="iii.v.iv-p15.1"></span>חן, *chen*, grace, which he repeats, that he
might more fully encourage the faithful to perseverance, and also that
he might kindle their desire and zeal.

<span id="iii.v.iv-p16"></span>We now then see what this verse on the
whole contains: first, the angel shows that however impetuously the
ungodly might rage against the temple, yet their attempts would be
frustrated, and that though they thought themselves to be like great
mountains, it was yet in the power and will of God to reduce them to a
plain, that is, suddenly to lay them prostrate. This is one thing. Then
secondly, he adds, that a happy success would attend the building of the
temple; for Zerubbabel would bring forth the top-stone, the highest. And
lastly, he subjoins, that the faithful ought unanimously to pray, and so
to persevere with the greatest ardor and zeal, that God might bless the
temple, and cause the building of it to be completed. It now follows —

<span id="iii.v.v"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p1"></span><span id="iii.v.v-p1.1"></span>[Zech.
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#009.md)<span id="iii.v.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p2"></span>**8.** Moreover the word of the LORD came
unto me, saying,

<span id="iii.v.v-p3"></span>**8.** Et factus est sermo Iehovae ad me
dicendo**,**

<span id="iii.v.v-p4"></span>**9.** The hands of Zerubbabel have laid
the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou
shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.

<span id="iii.v.v-p5"></span>**9.** Manus Zerubbabel fundarunt domum
hanc**,** et manus ejus perficient eam; et congnosces quia Iehova
exercituum miserit me ad vos.

<span id="iii.v.v-p6"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.v-p7"></span><span id="iii.v.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p8"></span>He confirms in this passage what I lately
stated — That there was no reason for the faithful to entertain doubts
or to feel anxious, because they saw that the beginning of the building
was mean and despised by the world; for the Lord would at length show
that it was built by his sanction and command, and that it would succeed
far better than all of them had thought.

<span id="iii.v.v-p9"></span>But he says that the *word of Jehovah* came
to him;  <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) and yet at the end of the
next verse he shows that this address came from the mouth of the angel.
But it is a well-known and a common mode of speaking, that God himself
is said to speak, when he employs either angels or men as his agents;
for the person of the messenger lessens in no degree the reverence due
to the word: the majesty, then, of God ought to remain inviolable in his
word, whether brought to us by men or by angels. Now the Prophet felt
assured that nothing was adduced by the angel, but what he conveyed as
the minister of God.

<span id="iii.v.v-p11"></span>The sum of the whole is, that the temple,
though some interruptions happened, was yet so begun that its completion
was at length to be expected; as God had made use of the labors of
Zerubbabel, so he would not forsake the work of his hands. Since, then,
God was the chief founder of the building, it could not be but that the
temple would at length be completed.

<span id="iii.v.v-p12"></span><span id="iii.v.v-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p13"></span>This is what the angel had in view in
these words, *The hands of Zerubbabel have founded this house*. Of the
foundation there was indeed no doubt; but many believed that the
building would ever remain unfinished, for Satan had already by means of
the most powerful enemies impeded its progress. As then despair had laid
hold on the minds of almost all, the angel declares that Zerubbabel
would gain his object in finishing the temple which he had begun.

<span id="iii.v.v-p14"></span>He afterwards adds, *Thou shalt know that
God has sent me to you*. Of this knowledge we have spoken elsewhere. The
meaning is, that the event would be a sure and suitable proof, that
nothing had been rashly undertaken by them, but that the temple was
built by God’s command, for his power would be evident in its
completion. And he addresses the Prophet, who though he was fully
persuaded of the event and of the fulfillment of this prophecy, yet
learnt by what took place that the angel who gave the promise was sent
from above. We have said elsewhere that there are two kinds of
knowledge; one is of faith, which we derive from the word, though the
thing itself does not appear; the other is of experience, when God adds
accomplishment to the promise, and proves that he had not spoken in vain
and this is the knowledge which the angel means when he says, *Thou
shalt know* that I have been sent from above to you.

<span id="iii.v.v-p15"></span>Now if this be applied to Christ, it may,
as I have said, be justly done; for it is certain that angels were then
sent in such a manner that Christ was the chief. Since, then, nothing
was undertaken as to the building of the temple without Christ being the
leader, he rightly says here that he was sent by the Father. It
afterwards follows —

<span id="iii.v.vi"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vi-p1"></span><span id="iii.v.vi-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#010.md)<span id="iii.v.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vi-p2"></span>**10.** For who hath despised the day of
small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the
hand of Zerubbabel *with* those seven; they *are* the eyes of the LORD,
which run to and fro through the whole earth.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p3"></span>**10.** Quia quis contempsit diem
parvitatum (parvorum; *sed hic acciptitur pro parvitate?*) gaudabunt et
videbunt (*ad verbum*) lapidem stanneum in manu Zerubbabel (*sed ita
resolvi debet oratio***,** certe gaudabunt ubi viderint lapidem in manu
Zerubbabel:) septem hi**,** oculi Iehovae sunt**,** circumeuntes
(*vel***,** qui discurrunt) per totam terram.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.vi-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vi-p6"></span>Here the angel reproves the sloth and fear
of the people, for the greater part were very faint-hearted; and he also
blames the Jews, because they formed a judgment of God’s work at the
first view, *Who is he*, he says, *that has despised the day of
paucities?* He does not ask who it was, as though he spoke only of one,
or as though they were few in number or insignificant but he addresses
the whole people, who were chargeable with entertaining this wrong
feeling; for all were cast down in their minds, because they thought
that the work begun would be a sport to the ungodly, and would come to
nothing, according to what we read in <span
id="iii.v.vi-p6.1"></span>[Ne
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/neh003.htm#012.md)<span id="iii.v.vi-p6.1"></span>,
that the old men wept, so that nearly all threw down their tools, and
left off the building of the temple. We hence see that not a few
despised the small beginnings, and that the minds of all the people were
dejected, for they thought that they labored in vain while building the
temple, which made no approach to the glory and splendor of the former
temple: “What are we doing here? we seek to build a temple for God; but
what is it? does it correspond to the temple of Solomon? No, not in the
tenth degree; yet God has promised that this temple would be most
glorious.” While then they were considering these things, they thought
either that the time was not come, or that they toiled in vain, because
God would not dwell in a tent so mean. This is the reason why the
Prophet now says, *Who is he that has despised the day of paucities?*
 <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md)

<span id="iii.v.vi-p8"></span>God then sets himself in opposition to an
ungrateful and ill- disposed people, and shows that they all acted very
foolishly, because they cast and fixed their eyes only on the beginning
of things, as though God would not surpass by his power what human minds
could conceive. As then God purposed in a wonderful manner to build the
temple, the angel reproves here the clamors of the people.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p9"></span>He then adds, *They shall rejoice when
they shall see the workman’s plummet in the hard of Zerubbabel*  <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) Though he had adopted a severe and sharp
reproof, he yet mitigates here its severity, and promises to the Jews
that however unworthy they were of such kindness from God, they would
yet see what they had by no means expected, even Zerubbabel furnished
with everything necessary for the completion of the temple. Hence *they
shall see Zerubbabel with his tin-stone*;  <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) that is, with his plummet. As builders in
our day use a plumb-line, so he calls that in the hand of Zerubbabel a
tin-stone, which he had when prepared to complete the temple.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p12"></span>This doctrine may be also applied to us:
for God, to exhibit the more his power, begins with small things in
building his spiritual temple; nothing grand is seen, which attracts the
eyes and thoughts of men, but everything is almost contemptible. God
indeed could put forth immediately his power, and thus rouse the
attention of all men and fill them with wonder; he could indeed do so;
but as I have already said, his purpose is to increase, by doing
wonders, the brightness of his power; which he does, when from a small
beginning he brings forth what no one would have thought; and besides,
his purpose is to prove the faith of his people; for it behaves us ever
to hope beyond hope. Now when the beginning promises something great and
sublime, there is no proof and no trial of faith: but when we hope for
what does not appear, we give due honor to God, for we depend only on
his power and not on the proximate means. Thus we see that Christ is
compared to a shoot, which arises from the stem of Jesse. (<span
id="iii.v.vi-p12.1"></span>[Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.v.vi-p12.1"></span>.) God might have arranged that Christ should
have been born when the house of David was in its splendor, and when the
kingdom was in a flourishing state: yet his will was that he should come
forth from the stem of Jesse, when the royal name was almost cut off.
Again, he might have brought forth Christ as a full-grown tree; but he
was born as an insignificant shoot. So also he is compared by Daniel to
a rough and unpolished stone cut off from a mountain. (<span
id="iii.v.vi-p12.2"></span>[Da
2:45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#045.md)<span
id="iii.v.vi-p12.2"></span>.) The same thing has also been accomplished
in our age, and continues still at this day to be accomplished. If we
consider what is and has been the beginning of the growing gospel, we
shall find nothing illustrious according to the perceptions of the
flesh; and on this account the adversaries confidently despise us; they
regard us as the off-scourings of men, and hope to be able to cast us
down and scatter us by a single breath.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p13"></span>There are many at this day who despise
the day of paucity, who grow faint in their minds, or even deride our
efforts, as though our labor were ridiculous, when they see us
sedulously engaged in promoting the truth of the gospel; and we
ourselves are also touched with this feeling: there is no one who
becomes not sometimes frigid, when he sees the beginning of the Church
so mean before the world, and so destitute of any dignity. We hence
learn how useful it is for us at this day to be reminded, that we shall
at length see what we can by no means conjecture or hope for according
to present appearances; for though the Lord begins with little things,
and as it were in weakness, yet the plummet will at length be seen in
the hand of the Architect for the purpose of completing the work. There
is at this day no Zerubbabel in the world, to whom the office of
building the temple has been committed; but we know that Christ is the
chief builder, and that ministers are workmen who labor under him.
However then may Satan blind the unbelieving with pride and haughtiness,
so that they disdain and ridicule the building in which we labor; yet
the Lord himself will show that he is the chief builder, and will give
to Christ the power to complete the work.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p14"></span>He afterwards adds, *These seven are the
eyes of Jehovah, going round through the whole earth*. The angel calls
the attention of Zechariah to what we have before observed; for the
discourse was respecting the plummet, and Zechariah said, that there
were shown to him seven eyes in that stone. The angel explains what
those seven eyes meant, even that the Lord by his providence would
conduct the work to its completion. But we have said that seven eyes are
attributed to God, that we may be assured that nothing is hid from him;
for no one among men or angels possesses so great a clear-sightedness
but that he is ignorant of some things. Many of Gods mysteries, we
allow, are hid from angels; but when they are sent forth, they receive
as much revelation as their office requires. But the angel shows here,
that we ought by no means to fear that anything will happen which God
has not foreseen; for the *seven eyes*, he says, *go around through the
whole earth*: not that God has need of seven eyes; but we know what the
number seven means in Scripture; it signifies perfection.  <span
id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md)

<span id="iii.v.vi-p19"></span>The meaning then is — that God would
sufficiently provide that nothing should happen that might disturb him,
or turn him aside, or delay him in the execution of his work. How so?
because there were seven eyes; that is, he by his providence would
surmount all difficulties, and his eyes went round through the whole
earth, so that the devil could devise nothing behind or before, on the
right hand or on the left, above or below, which he could not easily
frustrate. We now then perceive the object of the Prophet.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p20"></span>With regard to the words, some render
<span id="iii.v.vi-p20.1"></span>אלה, *ale*, in the neuter gender,
“These are seven, they are the eyes of God.” But as to the sense, there
is no ambiguity: for the angel would have the faithful to recumb on
God’s providence, in order that they might be secure and fear no danger;
as the Lord would remove whatever was contrary to his purpose. It now
follows —

<span id="iii.v.vii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
4:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac004.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p2"></span>**11.** Then answered I, and said unto
him, What *are* these two olive trees upon the right *side* of the
candlestick and upon the left *side* thereof?

<span id="iii.v.vii-p3"></span>**11.** Et respondi et dixi ad eum**,**
Quid duae oleae istae ad dextram candelabri et ad sinstram ejus?

<span id="iii.v.vii-p4"></span>**12.** And I answered again, and said
unto him, What *be these* two olive branches which through the two
golden pipes empty the golden *oil* out of themselves?

<span id="iii.v.vii-p5"></span>**12.** Et respondi secundo et dixi ad
eum**,** Quid duo alvei (*vel***,** cursus**,** *vertunt alii***,**
spicas) olearum**,** quae sunt inter duas fistulas auri**,** fundentes a
se aurum?

<span id="iii.v.vii-p6"></span>**13.** And he answered me and said,
Knowest thou not what these *be*? And I said, No, my lord.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p7"></span>**13.** Et dixit mihi dicendo**,** Annon
cognoscis quid haec sunt? Et dixi**,** Non**,** Domine mi.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p8"></span>**14.** Then said he, These *are* the two
anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p9"></span>**14.** Et dixit**,** Hi sunt duo filii
olei qui astant apud Dominatorem cunctae terrae.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p10"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.vii-p11"></span><span id="iii.v.vii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p12"></span>The same vision is again related, at
least one similar to that which we have just explained; only there is
given a fuller explanation, for the Prophet says that he asked the angel
what was meant by the two olive-trees which stood, one on the right, the
other on the left side of the candlestick, and also by the two pipes of
the olive-trees. Some render <span id="iii.v.vii-p12.1"></span>שבלים,
*shebelim*,ears of corn, thinking that the branches of the olive-trees
are compared to ears of corn, because they were full and loaded with
berries; but the metaphor seems to me immaterial. The word in Hebrew is
indeed ambiguous; but it often means a pipe, or a running or flowing;
and this sense best suits this passage; and I wonder that this meaning
has been overlooked by all interpreters; for no doubt necessity
constrained them to retake themselves to this metaphor, however
unnatural it was. But we know that this spectacle was presented to
Zechariah in order to show that the olive-tree continually supplied
abundance of oil, lest the wick should become dry, and lest the lamps
should thus fail. Since then on every side there were pourers or pipes,
and three tubes received the oil from one olive-tree, and four received
it from the other, so that great abundance thus flowed from the two
olive-trees, and since there were also seven pipes, we see how suitable
it was that they should be between the olive-trees on the right and on
the left, and also that their tubes for the oil should be between the
pourers and the two pipes. As then the oil ran through the pourers and
passed through the two pipes, he asks the angel what these flowing
meant? The answer was, *These are the two sons of oil, who stand before
the Lord of all the earth*; that is, they are the two fountains which
supply oil from God himself, lest the lamps should fail through the want
of it.  <span id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) This is the import of the
whole.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p15"></span><span id="iii.v.vii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p16"></span>I have said that there is some
difference in the visions though the angel relates hardly anything new,
except respecting the flowing and the tubes; but as a new explanation is
given, Zechariah no doubt more fully considered what he had slightly
looked on before. The more attentive then to the vision the Prophet
became, the more confirmed he was; for God showed to him now what he had
not sufficiently observed before, namely, that there were pipes or tubes
through which the oil flowed into each of the pourers, and further, that
these flowing or a continual running of the oil, was like that of a
river, which runs through its own channel. But God intended to instruct
his Prophet by degrees, that we may learn at this day to apply our
thoughts to the understanding of his doctrine; for the instruction to be
derived from it is not of an ordinary kind, as I have already reminded
you. Indeed the state of things in our time is nearly the same with that
of his time: for Christ now renews by the power of his Spirit that
spiritual temple which had been pulled down and wholly demolished; for
what has been the dignity of the Church for many ages? Doubtless, it has
been for a long time in a dilapidated state; and now when God begins to
give some hope of a new building, Satan collects together many forces
from all parts to prevent the progress of the work. We are also tender
and soft, and even faint-hearted, so that hardly one in a hundred labors
so courageously as he ought.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p17"></span>We hence then learn how necessary for us
is this doctrine: it was not, therefore, to no purpose that the Prophet
did not apprehend at once and in an instant what was presented to him in
the vision, but made progress by degrees.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p18"></span><span id="iii.v.vii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p19"></span>We have also mentioned before, that the
desire of improvement observed in Zechariah ought to be noticed. For
though we attain not immediately what God teaches, yet the obscurity of
a passage ought not to damp our ardor; but we ought rather to imitate
the Prophet, who, in things difficult and unknown to him, asked
explanations from the angel. Angels are not indeed sent now to us from
heaven to answer our questions; but yet no one shall be without benefit
who will humbly and with a sincere desire ask of God; for God will
either by his ministers so elucidate what seems obscure to us and full
of darkness, that we shall know that there is nothing but what is clear
in his word; or he will by the Spirit of knowledge and judgment supply
what is deficient in the ministrations of men.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p20"></span>And this is also the reason why the
angel replies, *Dost thou not know what these mean?* For he does not
upbraid Zechariah with ignorance, but rather reminds all the faithful,
that they ought to quicken themselves, and to exert all their ardor to
learn, lest sloth should close up the way against them. This reply,
then, of the angel no doubt belongs to us all, “Dost thou not know what
these mean?” We ought to remember that the things we esteem as common
far exceed our thoughts. It indeed often happens that one runs over many
parts of Scripture, and thinks that he reads nothing but what is clear
and well known, while yet experience teaches us that we are inflated
with too much self-confidence; for we look down, as it were from on
high, on that doctrine which ought, on the contrary, to be reverently
adored by us. Then let every one of us, being warned by this sentence of
the angel, acknowledge that he as yet cleaves to first principles, or,
at least, does not comprehend all those things which are necessary to be
known; and that therefore progress is to be made to the very end of
life: for this is our wisdom, to be learners to the end.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p21"></span><span id="iii.v.vii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p22"></span>I come now to the answers of the angel,
*These are the two sons of oil*. Some understand by the two sons of oil
a king and a priest; but this is by no means suitable. There is no doubt
but that he calls the perpetual flowing the two sons of oil; as though
he had said, that it could not possibly be that the grace of God should
ever fail to preserve the Church, as God possesses all abundance, and
bids his grace so to flow, as that its abundance should never be
diminished.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p23"></span>He therefore says, that they *stand with
the Lord of the whole earth*: for <span id="iii.v.vii-p23.1"></span>על,
*ol*, sometimes means with, and sometimes concerning; but I prefer
taking its simple meaning; therefore, stand do the sons of oil *with*
the Lord. Some render, “nigh the Lord,” but improperly; for they pervert
the Prophet’s meaning, inasmuch as the angel means that these two sons
of oil stood with God, as though he had said, that there is such
fullness of grace in God, that it could never be exhausted. Though then
the oil flowed, it would yet be sufficient to replenish the seven lamps,
that is, fully; so that God would raise up his Church, preserve it safe,
and lead it to the highest perfection. Hence God is not so poor but that
he can continually supply as much grace as will be sufficient for the
preservation of his Church. How so? because there are two sons of oil,
that is, two continual flowing from him, so that the faithful shall
really find, that when they are enriched by the gifts of God, they are
in no danger of being in want. This is the meaning.

<span id="iii.v.viii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.viii-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="iii.v.viii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since Satan at
this day sets against us many terrors to cast us down, and we are very
weak, — O grant, that with our eyes lifted above we may meditate on that
invincible power which thou possesses, and by which thou canst overcome
all the hindrances of this world: and then, when nothing in this world
but what is contemptible appears to us as capable to confirm and support
our faith, may we, by the eye of faith, behold thine hidden power, and
never doubt but that thou wilt at length perform what the world at this
day thinks to be impossible and therefore ridicules; and may we so
constantly persevere in this confidence, that every one of us may devote
to thee his labor to the end, and never faint in the work of promoting
the spiritual building, until at length we ourselves shall be gathered,
and others shall be gathered through our labors, to offer to thee not
only spiritual sacrifices, such as thou receives now from us, but also
to offer to thee, together with the angels, eternal sacrifice of praise
and triumphant thanksgiving, on seeing perfected what at this day is
only weakly begun. — Amen.

<span id="iii.v.i-p23"></span> Literally it is, “seven and seven
pourers,” or pipes, or tubes “to the lamps” or lights. Some, as
*Henderson*, regard the first “seven” as an interpolation, and it is not
in the *Septuagint* nor *Vulgate*. Others, as *Newcome*, receive it, and
place it before lamps — “to the seven lamps.” If “seven and seven” be
taken as a form to express fourteen, then there were two pipes to convey
the oil from the bowl to each lamp, answerable to the two olive-trees
which supplied the oil; and it may be that this was expressed in order
to intimate with more distinctness that the oil proceeded equally to
each lamp from the two olive-trees. — *Ed.*

*Newcome* and *Henderson* adopt our version, “not by might nor by
power.” The first word, \[<span id="iii.v.i-p32.4"></span>חיל\] seems to
mean combined force, either of wealth or of armies; and the second,
\[<span id="iii.v.i-p32.5"></span>כח\], is the strength or vigor of men
— courage or valor. It was not by the united power of the world, nor by
individual strength or courage, that the work was to be effected — “not
by power nor by strength.” — *Ed.*

id="iii.v.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv-p11"></span> The *Targum* seems here to have given a
false view of this stone, regarding it as the chief corner-stone of the
foundation; and this view has been adopted by *Jerome*, *Cyril*,
*Drusius*, *Grotius*, and *Henderson*. But the context is wholly opposed
to it. The ninth verse is decisive on the subject, as noticed by
*Marckius*. This stone Zerubbabel was to bring forth; he had already
laid the foundation-stone. It is considered as “the topmost stone” by
*Theodoret*, *Cocceius*, *Pemble*, and *Newcome*. See <span
id="iii.v.iv-p11.1"></span>[Ps
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md)<span
id="iii.v.iv-p11.1"></span>. The last renders the distich thus,

<span id="iii.v.iv-p12"></span>*And he shall bring forth the
head-stone,  
*With *shoutings,* cryings*, Favor, favor, unto it.*

<span id="iii.v.iv-p13"></span>The last line is rendered by *Marckius* —

<span id="iii.v.iv-p14"></span>*Acclamations of favor,* — *of favor
(*shall be*) to it.*

<span id="iii.v.iv-p15"></span>“Favor,” or grace, here seems to be a
metonymy, prosperity or success being the effect of God’s favor: and
this is the view given by *Calvin*. — *Ed.*

id="iii.v.v-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p10"></span> That is, what follows was especially
addressed to the Prophet. The former part, beginning at the sixth verse,
was a communication to Zerubbabel, and may be considered as parenthetic;
the angel now proceeds to give an answer to the Prophet. — *Ed.*

id="iii.v.vi-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vi-p7"></span> “The day of small beginnings,” says
*Drusius*. It is explained by *Blayney* with reference to the time when
the resources of the nation appeared in the eyes of many inadequated to
the building of the temple. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_49"></span>[50](cc30007.htm#fr_49.md) <span
id="iii.v.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vi-p10"></span> Literally it is, “But they shall rejoice
and see the tin-ore (or plummet) in the land of Zerubbabel.” The regular
order would have been “see” and “rejoice;” but it is according to the
manner of statement often observed in the Prophets: they frequently
mention first the effect, and then the cause. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_50"></span>[51](cc30007.htm#fr_50.md) <span
id="iii.v.vi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vi-p11"></span> “It seems strictly to mean a piece of
*tin-ore*, (compare <span id="iii.v.vi-p11.1"></span>[De
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#009)<span id="iii.v.vi-p11.1"></span>,.md)
which is heavier than that of any other metal, and so more proper for a
*plummet*. — *Parkhurst.*

<span id="fn_51"></span>[52](cc30007.htm#fr_51.md) <span
id="iii.v.vi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vi-p15"></span> This verse has been variously rendered.
*Marckius* and *Henderson* consider the nominative case to “rejoice” to
be the “seven eyes,” according to the marginal reading of our version;
but *Dathius* and *Newcome* agree with *Calvin*, and regard the people
who despised the day of small thing to be intended. The latter’s version
is the following, —

<span id="iii.v.vi-p16"></span>*10.*<span id="iii.v.vi-p16.1"></span>
For who hath despised the day of small things?  
They shall rejoice and shall see  
The plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel.  
These seven **are**<span id="iii.v.vi-p16.5"></span> the eyes of
Jehovah:  
They run to and fro through the whole earth.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p17"></span>There is so much inversion in our
marginal reading that is wholly inconsistent with the general character
of the Hebrew language. “These seven,” according to *Dathius*, were “the
lamps,” and not the “eyes” on the stone mentioned in chapter 3:9, as
some think; for the explanation belongs to the present vision, and not
the former. Here is the direct answer to the question asked in verse 4.
The two last lines are literally as follows, —

<span id="iii.v.vi-p18"></span>*These seven, they eyes of Jehovah* are
*they,  
Which run to and fro through the whole earth.* — Ed.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[53](cc30007.htm#fr_52.md) <span
id="iii.v.vii-p12.2"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p13"></span> The second questions, which seems to be
a modification of the first, has been variously explained. The word
\[<span id="iii.v.vii-p13.1"></span>שבלים\], except in the feminine
gender, has not the meaning attached to it by *Calvin*. It is rendered,
“branches,” <span id="iii.v.vii-p13.2"></span>κλαδοι, by the
*Septuagint*, *Piscator*, *Newcome*, *Henderson*, and by our own
version; “berries,” by *Jun.* and *Trem*., *Drusius* and *Pemble*; and
“tubes” by *Grotius*. As it is a repetition of the former question, it
is probable that the branches in immediate connection with the
candlestick are intended: the oil proceeded from them by means of tubes
or pipes to the bowl or the reservoir at the top of the candlestick, and
hence by means of seven tubes, or pourers to the seven lamps. The
question now is respecting the olive-trees or the branches from which
the oil proceeded; and the answer is, that they are “the sons of oil.”

<span id="iii.v.vii-p14"></span>What is said of these “sons of oil,”
that they “stand with (or before) the Lord,” can hardly comport with the
explanation given by *Calvin*: but it is more suitable to regard them as
persons annointed, as rendered in our version, and by *Kimchi*,
*Drusiu*s, *Dathius*, *Newcome*, and *Henderson*. They are considered
here to mean Zerubbabel and Joshua; but yet as types of Christ in his
twofold character of a king and priest. *Blayney* takes another view; he
renders \[<span id="iii.v.vii-p14.1"></span>שבלים\], “orderers,”
deriving it from the Syriac, in which language the verb signifies to
direct, to guide in the way. He conceives them to be two persons,
guiding the oil to the channels or tubes which conveyed it to the lamps,
and that they were types of Moses and of Christ, the authors of the two
dispensations. The preceding view seems the most probable. — *Ed.*
