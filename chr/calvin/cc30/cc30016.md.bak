<span id="iii.xiv-p1"></span>Chapter 13

<span id="iii.xiv.i"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p1"></span><span
id="iii.xiv.i-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.xiv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p2"></span>**1.** In that day there shall be a
fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p3"></span>**1.** In die illo erit fons apertus
domui Davidis**,** et incolis Ierosolymae**,** ad peccatum et ad
immunditiam (*vel***,** ad expiationem et aspersionem.)

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p5"></span><span id="iii.xiv.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p6"></span>From this verse we again learn, that
Zechariah promised the spirit of repentance to the Jews, so that they
would find God still propitious to them, when their circumstances were
brought to the verge of despair: for it would not have been enough for
them to feel sorrow, except God himself became propitious and merciful
to them. He had said indeed that the Spirit of grace and of
commiserations would be poured forth; but he had not as yet taught
clearly what he now adds respecting remission and pardon. After having
then declared that there would be felt by the Jews the bitterest sorrow,
because they had as it were pierced God, he now mentions the fruit of
this repentance. And hence also appears what Paul means by sorrow not to
be repented of; for it generates repentance unto salvation. When then
our sorrow is blessed by the Lord, the end is to be regarded; for our
hearts are thereby raised up to joy. But the issue of repentance, as
Zechariah declares here, is ablution: and he alludes to the legal rites
when he says,

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p7"></span>*A fountain shall be opened to the house
of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem*. We know that formerly
under the law many washings were prescribed to the Jews; and when any
one had become defiled, to wash himself was the remedy. It is certain
that water was of no value to cleanse the heart; but the sins of men, we
know, are expiated by the death of Christ, so that true ablution is by
the blood which he shed for us.  <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md)
Hence the types of the law ought no doubt to be referred to this blood.
The meaning is that God would be reconciled to the Jews when they became
touched with sincere sorrow, and that reconciliation would be ready for
them, for the Lord would cleanse them from every defilement.

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p9"></span>He speaks of a *fountain opened*; and he
no doubt intimates here a difference between the law and the gospel.
Water was brought daily to the temple; but it was, we know, for private
washings. But Zechariah promises here a perpetual stream of cleansing
water; as though he had said, “Ablution will be free to all, when God
shall again receive his people into favor.” Though remission of sins was
formerly offered under the law, yet it is now much more easily obtained
by us; not that God grants a license to sin, but that the way in which
our filth is cleansed, has become more evident since the coming of
Christ. For the fathers under the law were indeed fully assured that God
was so propitious as not to impute sins; but where was the pledge of
ablution? In the sprinkling of blood, and that blood was the blood of a
calf or a lamb. Now since we know that we have been redeemed by Christ,
and that our souls are sprinkled with his blood by the hidden power of
the Holy Spirit, it is doubtless the same as though God had not only set
before our eyes our ablution, but also placed it as it were in our
hands, while to the fathers it was more obscure or shown to them at a
distance.

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p10"></span>And he says, *To the house of David and
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem*. He had before restricted God’s favor
to that city, that he might goad the Jews, who had preferred their
outward gratifications to so great a happiness; for they thought
themselves happy in their exile, because they inhabited a pleasant and
fruitful country, and enjoyed quietness and peace; and thus it happened
that they despised the deliverance offered to them. Hence the Prophet
promises here to the citizens of Jerusalem and to the royal family a
fountain in which they might wash away their filth; for from Sion was
the law to go forth, and from Jerusalem the word of the Lord. (<span
id="iii.xiv.i-p10.1"></span>[Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.i-p10.1"></span>.) And we know that from thence were taken
the first-fruits of the new Church.  <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) What we have before seen respecting
God’s favor being extended farther, is no objection; for both events
were in their due order fulfilled, as God blessed the tribe of Judah,
who trusted in his promises and returned to their own country, and
afterwards extended wider his favor, and gathered into one body those
who had been dispersed through distant parts of the world.

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p12"></span>He adds, *For sin and for uncleanness*,
or as some read, “for sprinkling,” which is by no means suitable, except
the word “sin” be taken for expiation. The word is derived from <span
id="iii.xiv.i-p12.1"></span>נדד, *nedad*, but it often means sprinkling,
sometimes uncleanness, and sometimes the uncleanness of women, and so
some render it here. The verb signifies to remove or to separate; and
hence <span id="iii.xiv.i-p12.2"></span>נדה, *nede*, is the removal of a
woman from her husband during her uncleanness, but it is applied to
designate any uncleanness. It might indeed be taken here for the
uncleanness of women, as an instance of a part for the whole; but I am
led by the context to render it uncleanness. Now if we translate <span
id="iii.xiv.i-p12.3"></span>חטאת, *chathat*, sin, then <span
id="iii.xiv.i-p12.4"></span>נדה, *nede*, must be rendered uncleanness;
but if the first be expiation, then the second may be sprinkling: and
this meaning I am disposed to take, for under the law sins were cleansed
by sacrifices as well as by washings.  <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md)

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p18"></span>The import of the whole then is — that
though the Jews had in various ways defiled themselves, so that they
were become filthy before God, and their uncleanness was abominable, yet
a fountain would be prepared for them, by which they might cleanse
themselves, so as to come before God pure and clean. We hence see that
it was the Prophet’s object to show, that the repentance of which he had
spoken would not be useless, for there would be a sure issue, when God
favored the Jews, and showed himself propitious to them, and already
pacified, and even provided for them a cleansing by the blood of his
only-begotten Son, so that no filth might prevent them to call on him
boldly and in confidence; for instead of the legal rites there would be
the reality, as their hearts would be sprinkled by the Spirit, so that
they would be purified by faith, and would thus cast away all their
filth.

<span id="iii.xiv.ii"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="iii.xiv.ii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou
hast been pleased to adopt us as thy people, and from being thine
enemies, profane and reprobate, to make us the children of Abraham, that
we might be to thee a holy heritage, — O grant, that through the whole
course of our life we may so repent as to attain thy mercy, which is
daily set before us in thy gospel, and of which thou hast given us a
sure pledge in the death of thy only Son, so that we may become more and
more humble before thee, and labor to form our life according to the
rule of righteousness, and so loathe ourselves, that we may at the same
time be allured by the sweetness of thy goodness to call upon thee, and
that being thus united to thee, we may be confirmed in the faith, until
we shall reach that blessed rest which has been procured for us by the
blood of thy Son Jesus Christ. — Amen.

<span id="iii.xiv.iii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Sixty-third

<span id="iii.xiv.iv"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p1"></span><span
id="iii.xiv.iv-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#002.md)<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p2"></span>**2.** And it shall come to pass in that
day, saith the LORD of hosts, *that* I will cut off the names of the
idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I
will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p3"></span>**2.** Et erit in die illo**,** dicit
Iehova exercituum**,** Excidam (*vel***,** delebo) nomina simulachrorum
e terra**,** et non erunt in memoria amplius; atque etiam Prohetas et
spiritum immundum auferam (*vel*<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p3.1"></span>,
exterminabo**,** *ad verbam* *est***,** transire faciam) e terra.

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p5"></span><span id="iii.xiv.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p6"></span>Here the Prophet mentions another
effect, which would follow the repentance of the people, and which the
Lord also would thereby produce. There was to be a cleansing from all
the defilements of superstitions; for the pure and lawful worship of God
cannot be set up without these filthy things being wiped away; inasmuch
as to blend sacred with profane things, is the same thing as though one
sought to take away the difference between heaven and earth. No religion
then can be approved by God, except what is pure and free from all such
pollution. We hence see why the Prophet adds, that there would be an end
to falsehoods and all errors, and to the delusions of Satan, when God
restored his Church; for the simplicity of true doctrine would prevail,
and thus abolished would be whatever Satan had previously invented to
corrupt religion.

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p7"></span>We hence learn what I have just stated —
that God cannot be rightly worshipped, except all corruptions,
inconsistent with his sincere and pure worship, be taken away. But we
must at the same time observe, that this effect is ascribed to God’s
word; for it is that which can drive away and banish all the
abominations of falsehood, and whatever is uncongenial to true religion.
As then by the rising of the sun darkness is put to flight, and all
things appear distinctly to the view, so also when God comes forth with
the teaching of his word, all the deceptions of Satan must necessarily
be dissipated.

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p8"></span>Now these two things ought especially to
be known; for we see that many, who are not indeed ungodly, but foolish
and inconsiderate, think that they give to God his due honor, while they
are entangled in many errors, and refrain not from superstitions.
Others, more politic, devise this way of peace — that they who think
rightly are to concede something to tyrants and false Prophets; and thus
they seek to form at this day a new religion for us, made up of Popery
and of the simple doctrine of the gospel, and in this manner as it were
to transform God. As then we see that men are so disposed to mix all
sorts of things together, that the pure simplicity of the gospel may be
contaminated by various inventions, we ought to bear in mind this truth,
— that the Church cannot be rightly formed, until all superstitions be
rejected and banished. This is one thing.

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p9"></span>We may also deduce hence another
principle — that the word of God not only shows the way to us, but also
discovers all the delusions of Satan; for hardly one in a hundred
follows what is right, except he is reminded of what he ought to avoid.
It is then not enough to declare that there is but one true God, and
that we ought to put our trust in Christ, except another thing be added,
that is, except we warn men of those intrigues by which Satan has from
the beginning deceived miserable mortals: even at this day with what
various artifices has he withdrawn the simple and unwary from the true
God, and entangled them in a labyrinth of superstitions. Except
therefore men be thus warned, the word of God is made known to them only
in part. Whosoever then desires to perform all the duties of a good and
faithful pastor, ought firmly to resolve, not only to abstain from all
impure doctrines, and simply to assert what is true, but also to detect
all corruptions which are injurious to religion, to recover men from the
deceptions of Satan, and in short, avowedly to carry on war with all
superstitions.

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p10"></span>This was what Zechariah had in view
when he said, *In that day*, that is, when God would restore his Church,
*perish shall the names of idols,*  <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) *so that they shall be remembered no
more*. By this last expression he sets forth more clearly what I have
just stated, that the pure worship of God is then established as it
ought to be, and that religion has then its own honor, when all errors
and impostures cease, so that even the memory of them does not remain.
It is indeed true, that superstitions can never be so abolished, so that
no mention of them should be made; nay, the recollection of them is
useful —

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p12"></span>“Thou shalt remember thy ways,” says
Ezekiel, “and be ashamed,” (<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p12.1"></span>[Eze
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.iv-p12.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p13"></span>But by this form of speaking Zechariah
means, that such would be the detestation of superstitions, that the
people would dread the very mention of them. And hence we may learn how
much purity of doctrine is approved by God, since he would have us to
feel a horror as at something monstrous, whenever the name of an idol is
mentioned.

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p14"></span>He then refers to false teachers, *I
will exterminate,* he says, *the Prophets and the unclean Spirit*  <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) *from the land*. The connection here
is worthy of being noticed; for it hence appears how all errors arise,
even when a loose rein is given to false teachers. It is indeed true I
allow, that the seed of all errors is implanted in each of us, so that
every one is a teacher to deceive himself; for we are not only disposed
to what is false, but rush headlong into it: it is the corruption of our
nature. But at the same time when liberty is taken to teach anything
that may please men, the whole of religion must necessarily be
corrupted, and all things become mixed together, so that there is no
difference between light and darkness. God then here reminds us, that
the Church cannot stand, except false teachers be prevented from turning
truth into falsehood, and from pealing at their pleasure against the
word of God.

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p16"></span>And this is what ought to be carefully
observed; for we see at this day how some unprincipled men adopt this
sentiment — that the Church is not free, except every one is allowed
with impunity to promulgate whatever he pleases, and that it is the
greatest cruelty to punish a heretic; for they would have all liberty to
be given to blasphemies. But the Prophet shows here, that the Church
cannot be preserved in a pure state, and, in a word, that it cannot
exist as a healthy and sound body, except the rashness and audacity of
those who pervert sound and true doctrine be restrained.

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p17"></span>We now then understand the import of
this verse — that in order that God may be alone and indeed be rightly
worshipped, he will take away and banish all idols and all
superstitions, and also, that he will exterminate all ungodly teachers
who pervert sound doctrine.

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p18"></span>He calls them first *Prophets*, and
then *unclean spirits*. The name of Prophets is conceded to them, though
they were wholly unworthy of so honorable a title. As ungodly men ever
boast themselves in an audacious manner and hesitate not to pretend
God’s name, that they may more boldly proceed in deceiving: hence it is,
that Scripture sometimes concedes to them a name which they falsely
claim. So also the word spirit is sometimes applied to them —

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p19"></span>“Prove the spirits, whether they are of
God: every spirit that denies that Christ has come in the flesh, he is a
liar.”  
(<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p19.2"></span>[1Jo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.iv-p19.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p20"></span>John doubtless adopted this mode of
speaking according to common usage; for all false teachers claimed this
title with great confidence, and maintained that all the errors they
spread abroad were revealed to them by the Spirit.” Be it so then, but
ye are lying spirits.”

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p21"></span>Now then as to this title, there is no
obscurity in what the Prophet means: and by way of explanation he adds
the unclean spirit, that he might distinguish those vile men from the
faithful ministers of God; as though he had said, “They indeed declare
that they have drawn down the Spirit from heaven; but it is the spirit
of the devil, it is an unclean spirit.” Now as Zechariah declares, that
this would be in the Church of God, we learn how foolish the Papists
are, who are content with the mere title of honor, and claim to
themselves the greatest power, and will have themselves heard without
dispute, as though they were the organs of the Spirit. What right indeed
do they pretend? that they have been called by the Lord. The same reason
might have been assigned by these unprincipled men, whom it was
necessary to drive away, in order that the Church might rise again. It
then follows that we are not to consider only what name a person has, or
with what title he is distinguished, but how rightly he conducts
himself, and how faithfully he performs his duties and discharges the
office of a pastor. Let us proceed -

<span id="iii.xiv.v"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p1"></span><span
id="iii.xiv.v-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#003.md)<span id="iii.xiv.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p2"></span>**3.** And it shall come to pass, *that*
when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat
him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in
the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall
thrust him through when he prophesieth.

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p3"></span>**3.** Et erit**,** quum prophetaverit
vir (*hoc est***,** quispiam) adhuc**,** dicent ad eum pater ejus et
mater ejus**,** qui eum genuerunt**,** Non vies**,** qu ia mendacium
loquutus es in nomine Iehovae; et transfigent eum (*vel***,**
confodient**,** *nam habetur verbum illud*<span
id="iii.xiv.v-p3.1"></span>, \[<span
id="iii.xiv.v-p3.2"></span>דקר\]**,** *quod heri vidimus*) pater ejus et
mater ejus**,** qui genuerunt eum**,** quia prophetaverit.

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p5"></span><span id="iii.xiv.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p6"></span>The same concession is made in this
verse, where Zechariah speaks of the office of prophesying: he indeed
confines what he says altogether to false teachers, for he takes it as
granted that there was then no attention given to God’s servants,
inasmuch as false spirits had conspired together, so that nothing pure
or sound remained in the Church. As then a false and diabolical faction
had then prevailed, Zechariah calls them Prophets as though they were
all such, for they were heard as the Lord’s servants during that
disorder of which mention is made. But he proceeds farther in this verse
than before, and says, that there would be so much zeal in God’s
children when renewed by his Spirit, that they would not spare even
their own children, but slay them with their own hands, when they saw
them perverting the truth of God.

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p7"></span>Zechariah no doubt alludes to the 13th
chapter of <span id="iii.xiv.v-p7.1"></span>[De
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.xiv.v-p7.1"></span>
where God requires such a rigorous severity in defending pure doctrine,
that a father was to rise up against the son whom he had begotten, that
a husband was to lead his wife to death rather than to indulge his love
and to pardon impiety, in case the wife solicited him or others to
forsake God. The Lord then would have all the godly to burn with so much
zeal in the defense of lawful worship and true religion, that no
connection, no relationship, nor any other consideration, connected with
the flesh, should avail to prevent them from bringing to punishment
their neighbors, when they see that God’s worship is profaned, and that
sound doctrine is corrupted. This was the rule prescribed by the law.
Now after religion had been for a time neglected, and even trodden
almost under foot, Zechariah says, that the faithful, when they shall
have repented, would be endued with so much zeal for true religion, as
that neither father nor mother would tolerate an ungodly error in their
own son, but would lead him to punishment; for they would prefer the
glory of God to flesh and blood, they would prefer to all earthly
attachments that worship which ought to be more precious to us than life
itself.

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p8"></span>But it must at the same time be observed,
that this zeal under the reign of Christ is approved by God; for
Zechariah does not here confine what he teaches to the time of the law,
but shows what would take place when Christ came, even that this zeal,
which had become nearly extinct, would again burn in the hearts of all
the godly. It then follows, that this law was not only given to the
Jews, as some fanatics verily imagine, who would have for themselves at
this day a liberty to disturb the whole world, but the same law also
belongs to us: for if at this day thieves and robbers and sorcerers are
justly punished, doubtless those who as far as they can destroy souls,
who by their poison corrupt pure doctrine, which is spiritual food, who
take away from God his own honor, who confound the whole order of the
Church, doubtless such men ought not to escape unpunished. It would be
indeed better to grant license to thieves and sorcerers and adulterers,
than to suffer the blasphemies which the ungodly utter against God, to
prevail without any punishment and without any restraint. And this is
evident enough from the words of our Prophet.

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p9"></span>And little consideration do they also
show, who immediately fret from a regard to their own relatives. When
faithful ministers and pastors are constrained to warn their people to
beware of the artifices of Satan, they seek to bury every recollection
of this, because it is invidious, because it leads to reproach. What if
their children were to be drawn forth to punishment? How could they bear
this, though they might remain at home; for they cannot attend to a free
warning from their own pastor, when they find that impious errors are
reproved, which we see prevailing, I say not in our neighborhood only,
but also in our own bosom and in the Church. Let them then acknowledge
their own folly, that they may learn to put on new courage, so that they
may make more account of the glory of God, and of the pure doctrine of
religion, than of their own carnal attachments, by which they are too
fast held. And this is also the reason why the Prophet says, *who have
begotten him*, and he repeats it twice: nor was it in vain that God had
those words expressly added,

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p10"></span>“The husband shall not suffer the wife
who sleeps in his bosom to go unpunished; nor shall the father pardon
his son whom he has begotten, nor the mother her own offspring, whom she
has nourished, whom she has carried in her womb.”  
(<span id="iii.xiv.v-p10.2"></span>[Deut.
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#006.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#009)<span id="iii.xiv.v-p10.2"></span>..md)

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p11"></span>All these things are said, that we may
learn to forget whatever belongs to the world and to the flesh, when
God’s glory and purity of doctrine are to be vindicated by us.  <span
id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md)

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p14"></span>Now the Prophet shows clearly that all
this is to be understood of false teachers, for he adds, *For falsehood
hast thou spoken in the name of Jehovah*. And at the same time the
atrocity of their sin is here pointed out; for if we rightly consider
what it is to speak falsehood in the name of Jehovah, it will certainly
appear to us to be more detestable than either to kill an innocent man,
or to destroy a guest with poison, or to lay violent hands on one’s own
father, or to plunder a stranger. Whatever crimes then can be thought
of, they do not come up to this, that is, when God himself is involved
in such a dishonor, as to be made an abettor of falsehood. What indeed
can more peculiarly belong to God than his own truth? and it is his will
also to be worshipped by us according to this distinction: God is truth.
Now to corrupt pure doctrine — is it not the same thing, as though one
substituted the devil in the place of God? or sought to transform God,
so that there should be no difference between him and the devil? Hence
the greatest of all crimes, as I have already said, does not come up to
this horrible and monstrous wickedness. For how much does the salvations
of souls exceed all the riches of the world? and then, how much more
excellent is the worship of God than the fame and honors of mortals?
Besides, does not religion itself, the pledge of eternal life, swallow
up in a manner every thing that is sought in the world? But most sacred
to us ought to be the name of God, the sanctifying of which we daily
pray for. When therefore what is false is brought forward in the name of
God, is not he, according to what I have already said, as it were
violently forced to undertake the office of the devil, to renounce
himself, and to deny that he is God?

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p15"></span>We hence see the design of the Prophet,
when he shows that there is no place for pardon, when the ungodly thus
wantonly rise up to pervert pure doctrine, and so to confound all things
as wholly to destroy true religion.

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p16"></span>He adds, *Pierce him shall his father
and his mother who have begotten him*. It is much harder to kill their
son by their own hands than to bring him to the Judge, and to leave him
to his fate. But the Prophet has taken this from the law — that so much
zeal is required from the faithful, that, if it be necessary, they are
to exterminate from the world such pests as deprive God of his own
honor, and attempt to extinguish the light of true and genuine religion.
It follows —

<span id="iii.xiv.vi"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p1"></span><span
id="iii.xiv.vi-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004.md)<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p2"></span>**4.** And it shall come to pass in that
day, *that* the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when
he hath prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p3"></span>**4.** Et erit in die illa**,**
pudefient Prophetae**,** quisque a visione sua**,** ubi prohetaverint;
et non induent vestem pilosam ut mentiantur.

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p5"></span><span id="iii.xiv.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p6"></span>Zechariah proceeds with the same
subject, but in other words and in another mode of speaking, and says,
that so great would be the light of knowledge, that those who had
previously passed themselves as the luminaries of the Church would be
constrained to be ashamed of themselves. And he farther shows how it was
that so great and so gross errors had arisen, when the whole of religion
had been trodden under foot, and that was because Satan had veiled the
eyes and minds of all, so that they could not distinguish between black
and white.

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p7"></span>And such ignorance has been the source
of all errors under the Papacy. How great has been the stupidity of that
people, as they have indiscriminately admitted whatever their ungodly
teachers have dared to obtrude on them? And in their bishops themselves,
and in the whole band of their filthy clergy, how great a sottishness
has prevailed, so that they differ nothing from asses? For artisans, and
even cowherds, surpass many of the priests and many of the bishops, at
least in common prudence. While then there was such ignorance in these
asses, there could not have been any difference made between truth and
falsehood. And then when they put on fine rings, and adorn themselves
with a forked metre and its ornaments, and also display their crook, and
appear in all their pontifical splendor, the eyes of the simple are so
dazzled, that all think them to be some new gods come down from heaven.
Hence these prelates were beyond measure proud, until God stripped off
their mask: and now their ignorance is well known, and no one among the
common people is now deceived.

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p8"></span>How then is it, that many are still
immersed in their own errors? Because they wish to be so; they close
their own eyes against clear light. The kings themselves, and such as
exercise authority in the world, desire to be in their filth, and are
indifferent as to any kind of abomination; for they fear lest in case of
any innovation the common people should take occasion to raise tumults.
As they themselves wish to remain quiet, hence it is that they defend
with a diabolical pertinacity those superstitions which are abundantly
proved to be so. And the people themselves neither care for God nor for
their own salvation. Hence then it is, that almost all, from the least
to the greatest, regard these asses, who are called prelates, as the
most ignorant, and yet they submit to their tyranny. However this may
be, the Lord has yet discovered the shame of those who had been a little
while ago almost adored.

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p9"></span>This is what Zechariah now declares,
*Ashamed*, he says, *shall all the Prophets be in that day, every one
for his own vision, when they shall have prophesied*. And the
concession, of which we have spoken, is not without reason; for when the
brawling monks about thirty years ago ascended their pulpits, or the
prelates, who theatrically acted their holy rites, there was nothing,
but what was divine and from heaven. Hence with great impudence they
boasted themselves to be God’s messengers, his ministers, vicars, and
pastors; though the name of pastors was almost mean in their esteem; but
they were Christ’s vicars, they were his messengers, in short, there was
nothing which they dared not to claim for themselves. The Prophet
ridicules this sort of pride, and seems to say, “Well, let all their
trumperies be prophecies; and all their babblings, let these be for a
time counted oracles: but when they shall thus prophesy, the Lord will
at length *make them ashamed, every one for his vision*.”

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p10"></span>It follows, *And they shall not wear a
hairy garment that they may lie*; that is, they shall not be solicitous
of retaining their honor and fame, but will readily withdraw from
courting that renown which they had falsely attained. It appears from
this place that Prophets wore sordid and hairy garments. Yet
interpreters do not appropriately quote those passages from the Prophets
where they are bidden to put on sackcloth and ashes; for Isaiah, while
announcing many of his prophecies, did not put on sackcloth and ashes,
except when he brought some sad message. The same also may be said of
Jeremiah, when he was bidden to go naked. But it was a common thing with
the Prophets to be content with a hairy, that is, with a sordid and mean
garment. For though there is liberty allowed in external things, yet
some moderation ought to be observed; for were I to teach in a military
dress, it would be deemed inconsistent with common sense. There is no
need of being taught as to what common decency may requite. The true
Prophets accustomed themselves to hairy garments in order to show that
they were sparing and frugal in their clothing as well as in their diet:
but they attached no sanctity to this practice, as though they acquired
some eminence by their dress, like the monks at this day, who deem
themselves holy on account of their hoods and other trumperies. This was
not then the object of the Prophets; but only that by their dress they
might show that they had nothing else in view but to serve God, and so
to separate themselves from the world, that they might wholly devote
themselves to their ministry. Now the false Prophets imitated them;
hence Zechariah says, *they shall no more wear a hairy garment*, that
is, they shall no more assume a prophetic habit.

<span id="iii.xiv.vi-p11"></span>His purpose was, not to condemn the
false Prophets for wearing that sort of garment, as some have supposed,
who have laid hold of this passage for the purpose of condemning long
garments and whatever displeased their morose temper; but the Prophet
simply means, that when purity of doctrine shall shine forth, and true
religion shall attain its own honor, there will be then no place given
to false teachers; for they will of themselves surrender their office,
and no longer try to deceive the unwary. This is the real meaning of the
Prophet: hence he says, *that they may lie*. We then see that hairy
garments are condemned on account of a certain end — even that rapacious
wolves might be concealed under the skin of sheep, that foxes might
introduce themselves under an appearance not their own. This design, and
not the clothing itself, is what is condemned by Zechariah. He
afterwards adds —

<span id="iii.xiv.vii"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p1"></span><span

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p5"></span><span id="iii.xiv.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p6"></span>He describes repentance in this verse
more fully. When Paul wished to exhort the faithful to newness of life,
he said,

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p7"></span>“Let him who has stolen, steal no more;
but rather work with his own hands, that he may relieve the wants of
others.”  
(<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p7.2"></span>[Eph
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p7.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p8"></span>Paul notices two parts of repentance, —
that thieves are to refrain from acts of dishonesty and wrong, — and
that they ought to labor in order to aid others and relieve their wants.
So also Zechariah mentions these two particulars, — that false prophets
will give up their office, — and that they will then spend their labor
in doing what is right and just, supporting themselves in a lawful and
innocent manner, and affording aid to their brethren.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p9"></span>Having spoken already of the former
part, he repeats the same thing again, *I am not a prophet*. It is then
the first thing in repentance, when they who had been previously the
servants of Satan in the work of deception, cease to deal in falsehoods,
and thus put an end to their errors. Now follows the progress, — that
they who lived before in idleness and in pleasures under the pretext of
sanctity, willingly devote themselves to labor, and continue no longer
idle and gluttonous as before, but seek to support themselves by just
and lawful employment. It would not then have been enough for him to
say, *I am no prophet*, had he not added, *I am an husbandman*; that is,
I am prepared to labor, that I may support myself and aid my brethren.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p10"></span>A half reformation might probably
succeed with many at this day. Were many monks sure that a rich mess
would continue to them in their cloisters, and were also the milted
bishops and abbots made certain that nothing of their gain and profit
would be lost to them, they would easily grant a free course to the
gospel. But the second part of reformation is very hard, which requires
toil and labor: in this case the stomach has no ears, according to the
old proverb. And yet we see what the Prophet says, — that those are they
who truly and from the heart repent, who not only abstain from
impostures, but who are also ready to get their own living,
acknowledging that they had before defrauded the poor, and procured
their support by rapine and fraud.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p11"></span>The Prophet no doubt speaks of
impostors, who were then numerous among the Jews; and there were also
women who boasted that they were favored with a prophetic spirit; and
the true prophets of God had to contend with these sorceresses or wise
women, who had ever intruded themselves during a confused state of
things, and undertook the office of teaching. As then there were at that
time many idlers who lived on superstition, rightly does the Prophet
send them away to cultivate the land. So at this day there are many
brotherlings who hide their ignorance under their hood, and even all the
papal clergy, under the sacred vestment, as they call it; and were they
unmasked, it might easily be found out, that they are the most ignorant
asses. Now, as the Lord has abundantly discovered their baseness, were
they to acknowledge that they have been impostors, what would remain for
them, but willingly to do what they are here taught? that is, to become
husband men instead of being prophets.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p12"></span>As to the end of the verse, some
retain the word Adam; others render it man; and generally the word Adam
means man in Scripture. But they who think that Zechariah speaks of the
first man, adduce this reason, — that as this necessity of “eating his
bread by the sweat of his face” (<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p12.1"></span>[Ge
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p12.1"></span>) was imposed on all mankind after the
fall, so also all his posterity were thus taught by Adam their first
parent; but this interpretation seems too far-fetched. I therefore take
the word indefinitely; as though he had said, “I have not been taught by
any master, so as to become capable to undertake the prophetic office;
but I am acquainted only with agriculture, and have made such progress,
that I can feed sheep and oxen; I am indeed by no means fit to take upon
me the office of a teacher.” I take the passage simply in this sense.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p13"></span>With regard to the verb <span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p13.1"></span>הקנני, *ekenni*, <span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p13.2"></span>קנה, *kene*, means to possess, to acquire;
but as the word <span id="iii.xiv.vii-p13.3"></span>מקנה, *mekene*,
which signifies a flock of sheep or cattle, is derived from this verb,
the most learned interpreters are inclined to give this meaning, “Man
has taught me to possess sheep and oxen.” I am however disposed to give
this rendering, as I have already stated, “Man has taught me to be a
shepherd.”  <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md)

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p21"></span>The import of the whole is, — that
when God shall discover the ignorance, which would so prevail in the
Church, as that the darkness of errors would extinguish as it were all
the light of true religion, then they who repent shall become so humble,
as to be by no means ashamed to confess their ignorance and to testify
that they had been impostors as long as they had under a false pretense
assumed the office of prophets. The Spirit of God then requires here
this humility from all who had been for a time immersed in the dregs of
falsehood, that when they find that they are not fit to teach, they
should say, “I have not been in school, I was wholly ignorant, and yet I
wished to be accounted a most learned teacher; at that time the
stupidity of the people veiled my disgrace: but now the light of truth
has shone upon us, which has constrained me to feel ashamed; and
therefore I confess that I am not worthy to be heard in the assembly,
and I am prepared to employ my hands in labor and toil, that I may gain
my living, rather than to deceive men any longer, as I have hitherto
done.”

<span id="iii.xiv.viii"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="iii.xiv.viii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast
been pleased to draw us at this day, by the light of thy gospel, out of
that horrible darkness in which we have been miserably immersed, and to
render thy face so conspicuous to us in the person of thy only-begotten
Son, that nothing but our ingratitude prevents us from being transformed
into thy celestial glory, — O grant, that we may make such advances in
the light of truth, that every one of us may be ashamed of his former
ignorance, and that we may freely and ingenuously confess that we were
lost sheep, until we were by thy hand brought back into the way of
salvation; and may we thus proceed in the course of our holy vocation,
until we shall at length be all gathered into heaven, where not only
that truth shall give us light, which now rules us according to the
capacity of our flesh, but where also shall shine on us the splendor of
thy glory, and shall render us conformable to thine image, through Jesus
Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="iii.xiv.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.xiv.x-p5"></span><span id="iii.xiv.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.x-p6"></span>Here the Prophet, in order to finish what
we explained yesterday, says that such would be the discipline among the
new people after having repented, that each in his own house would
chastise his sons and relatives: and it is an evidence of perfect zeal,
when not only judges perform their office in correcting wickedness, but
when also private individuals assist to preserve public order, each
according to his power. It is indeed true that the use of the sword is
not allowed us, so that the offender may be punished by his neighbor:
but as it was always allowed by the law of God, that when the matter did
not come before a public tribunal, friends might inflict punishment,
Zechariah, alluding to this custom, says, that though they who unjustly
claimed the prophetic office and spread abroad false and impious errors,
should not be visited with capital punishment, yet such would be their
zeal for true religion, that friends would privately chastise such as
they found to be of this character.

<span id="iii.xiv.x-p7"></span>If any one objects and says, that these
two things are inconsistent, — that false Prophets were punished with
death, and that they were only chastised with stripes or scourges. To
this I answer, that Zechariah does not speak precisely of the kind and
mode of punishment, but says generally, that false teachers, even in the
estimation of their parents, were worthy of death; and that if they were
treated more gently they should yet suffer such a punishment, that they
would through life be mutilated and ever bear scars as proofs of their
shame.

<span id="iii.xiv.x-p8"></span>We may at the same time gather from the
answer what proves true repentance, *Say will* one, (it is put
indefinitely,) or it will be said, *What mean these wounds in thine
hands? Then he will say, I have been stricken by my friends*. The
Prophet shows that those who had previously deceived the people would
become new men, so as patiently to bear correction; though it might seem
hard when the hands are wounded and pierced, yet he says that the
punishment, which was in itself severe, would bee counted mild, for they
would be endued with such meekness as willingly to bear to be corrected.
Some apply this to Christ, because Zechariah has mentioned wounds on the
hands; but this is very puerile; for it is quite evident that he speaks
here of false teachers, who had for a time falsely pretended God’s name.
As then they say, that they were friends by whom they were smitten, they
acknowledge themselves worthy of such punishment, and they murmur not,
nor set up any complaint.  <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) It
now follows —

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p5"></span><span id="iii.xiv.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p6"></span>It was pleasant and delightful to hear
what the Prophet said at the beginning of the chapter, for he promised
that a fountain would be opened, by which the Jews might cleanse away
all their filth, and that God, having been reconciled, would be
bountiful to them. As then he had promised so blessed and happy a state,
what he had said before might have been so taken, even by the true and
faithful servants of God, as though the condition of the Church were to
be after that time free from every trouble and inconvenience; hence
Zechariah anticipates such a conclusion, and shows that the happy state
which he had promised was not to be so looked for, as it though the
faithful were to be free from every affliction, for God would in the
meantime severely try his Church. Though then God had promised to be
bountiful to his Church, he yet shows that many troubles would be mixed
up with its prosperity in order that the faithful might prepare
themselves to endure all things.

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p7"></span>This discourse may indeed appear abrupt,
but its different parts harmonise well together, for God so regulates
his benefits which he bestows on his Church in this world, as ever to
try it in various ways. What is here said was especially necessary,
since very grievous afflictions were nigh at hand: for, as it is evident
from history, that nation was on the borders of despair when the coming
of Christ approached. This then is the reason why the Prophet seems at
the first view to join together things so contrary. For what he has
hitherto promised tended to prepare the faithful to bear all things
patiently, inasmuch as deliverance was nigh. But in the meantime it was
needful that they should be expressly encouraged to persevere, lest they
should succumb under the extreme evils which were not far distant.

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p8"></span>The sum of the whole is, that before the
Lord would cleanse his Church and bring it back to perfect order, very
grievous calamities were to intervene, for a dreadful disorder there
must be when God smites the very shepherds; and the apostrophe, when God
addresses the sword, a thing void of reason, is very emphatical. It is
much more striking than if he had said, “A sword shall be raised against
my shepherds and against my ministers, so that the flock shall be
dispersed.” But the metaphor, as I said, is much more expressive, when
God directs his words to the sword itself; *Awake*, watch, *O sword*, —
how? *against my shepherd*

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p9"></span>Most of our interpreters confine this
passage to the person of Christ, because in <span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p9.1"></span>[Mt
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p9.1"></span>, this sentence is quoted,

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p10"></span>“Smite the shepherd, and the sheep
shall be scattered:”

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p11"></span>but this is no solid reason; for what
is said of a single shepherd ought probably to be extended to the whole
order. When God says in <span id="iii.xiv.xi-p11.1"></span>[De
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p11.1"></span>,

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p12"></span>“A prophet will I raise up from the
midst of you,”

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p13"></span>though mention is indeed made of one
Prophet only, yet God includes all the Prophets; as though he had said,
“I will never deprive you of the doctrine of salvation, but in every age
will I show that I care for you, for my Prophets shall be ever present,
by whose mouth I shall make it known that I am near you.” This passage
is quoted as referring to Christ, and very suitably, because all the
Prophets spoke by his Spirit, and at length he himself appeared, and by
his mouth the heavenly Father spoke familiarly with us, and fully
explained his whole mind, as it is said in the first chapter to the
Hebrews

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p14"></span>“In various ways and often did God
speak formerly to the fathers by the Prophets, but now in these last
times by his only-begotten Son.”

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p15"></span>As then Christ possesses a supremacy
among the Prophets, and hence rightly applied to him are the words of
Moses; so also as he is the head and prince of shepherds, this
pre-eminence justly belongs to him. But what is said by the Prophet is
however to be viewed as a general truth. In short, God threatens the
people, and declares that there would be a dreadful disorder; for they
would be deprived of their shepherds, so that there would be no
government among them, or one in great confusion.

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p16"></span>The word <span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p16.1"></span>עמית, *omit*, is rendered by some, kindred,
(<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p16.2"></span>*contribulis* — one of the same
tribe,) by others, kinsman, (<span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p16.3"></span>*consanguineus* — one of the same blood,)
and by others, one connected, (<span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p16.4"></span>*co-haerens*,) that is, with God; and they
have considered that this passage cannot be understood of any but of
Christ alone: but they have taken up, as I have said, a false principle.
The Greek version has citizen (τὸν πολίτην,) and some render it, as
Theodotion, kindred (<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p16.5"></span>*sumfulon* — one
of the same tribe.) Jerome prefers the rendering, one connected or
united with me (<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p16.6"></span>*cohaerentem mihi*.)
 <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) The word, according to the
Hebrews, means an associate, a neighbor, or a friend, or one in any way
connected with us. God, I have no doubt, distinguished pastors with this
title, because he gave a representation at himself by then to the
people; and the more eminent any one is, the nearer, we know, he is to
God: and hence kings and judges, and such as exercise authority, are
called his sons. So also pastors are called his associates, for they
spend their labor in building up the Church. He is the chief Pastor, but
he employs his ministers to carry on his work. This is the reason why
they are called the associates of God, that is, on account of the
connection between them, for they are co-workers with God, as Paul also
teaches us. In short, the Prophet calls pastors the associates of God in
the same sense in which Paul calls them fellow-workers. (συνεργους <span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p17.3"></span>[1Co
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p17.3"></span>.)

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p18"></span>Having said that the sword was
permitted, nay, commanded, to rise against the shepherd, he immediately
adds, that *the sheep were dispersed*. We then see that in these words
is set forth a calamity that was to be feared, and which the people were
not able to escape, in order that the faithful might not be too much
disheartened, as though God would disappoint them, but that they might
stand firm amidst grievous troubles and violent commotions. Since then
this disorder was nigh, Zechariah bids the faithful to continue firm and
patiently, and quietly hope, until God showed himself again propitious
to them, and those evidences of his favor appeared of which he had
before spoken. We now see what the design of the Prophet was. But we
must especially notice, that it is a sure presage of the people’s ruin
and destruction when pastors are taken from them; for when God intends
to keep us safe, he employs this instrumentality, that is, he raises up
faithful teachers, who rule in his name; and he rules them by his
Spirit, and fits them for their rank and station: but when he strikes
them, he not only forsakes the people, but also shows that he is the
avenger of wickedness, so that the people themselves are destroyed. This
is the import of the Prophet’s words.

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p19"></span>But this, as I have already observed,
was fulfilled in Christ; for he accommodated the passage to himself when
his disciples fled from him. Though they were but a small flock, being
very few in number, yet they were scattered and put to flight. In that
case then, as in a mirror, appeared how truly it had been said by
Zechariah, that the scattering is nigh when a pastor is smitten.

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p20"></span>By the word *sword*, he means
affliction; for though Christ was not slain by a sword, yet crucifixion
and violent death are fitly designated by the word sword.

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p21"></span>It follows at the end of the verse,
*And I will turn my hand to the little ones*. Some consider that the
little ones would be exposed to many evils, because the Lord would ever
hold his rod in his hand to chastise them. But the Prophet, I have no
doubt, meant what is far different, — that God would show mercy to them,
when the body of the people had been as it were torn into many parts.
For all the godly might have been wholly dejected when their shepherds
were taken away, and when the people were become like a straying flock.
God then comes to their aid, and testifies that his hand would be
extended over the miserable and the poor ones, who had been almost
overwhelmed by a mass of evils.

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p22"></span>This passage is also very serviceable
to us in the present state of the Church: for we see how God has lately
cut off many pastors, so that what is called the Church is become like a
mutilated body. We also see that God often deprives of good and faithful
pastors those who have abused his truth, or with impious contempt
rejected it. We might then in this case be terrified and cast off all
hope of salvation, were we not to remember what Zechariah teaches us
here, even that though the Church were contemptible in the world, and
though the faithful were few in number, and all of them exposed to
calamities, yet God’s hand will be over them, so as to gather for
himself again a Church from the torn members. This is the import of the
whole. It follows —

<span id="iii.xiv.xii-p5"></span><span id="iii.xiv.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.xii-p6"></span>He goes on with the same subject; for
he reminds the faithful, that though God had resolved to restore his
Church, and though his blessing would be evident, yet very heavy
afflictions were not far distant; as though he had said, “God will give
you a serene heaven and a bland air, that the land may bring forth its
fruit; but still there is a heavy tempest impelling, and ye shall not be
exempt from storms and hail. But when God has laid waste a part of the
land, he will bless you with corn and wine, so that you shall have
sufficient support.” So also in this place he says, “God will protect
his Church, and will also be propitious to it, for he will wash away all
the filth of wickedness, and will give to you faithful pastors, when he
has removed the impostures of Satan: but in the meantime most grievous
afflictions await you, and a hard state of things, and difficult to be
borne, must be expected; for God will appear as though he intended to
destroy his people: such will be the scattering.”

<span id="iii.xiv.xii-p7"></span>For this reason he says, that there
will be through the whole land the most grievous calamities: *Two
parts*, he says, *shall die; the third only shall remain*

<span id="iii.xiv.xii-p8"></span>We now see how all these things agree,
and how the Prophet’s words harmonise. In short, he means, that what he
had before promised respecting the future favor of God, does not belong
indifferently to all, or to the whole body of the people, but to the
faithful, whom God will in a wonderful manner deliver from ruin; for of
the people God will only save the third part, as he had already resolved
to destroy the other two parts. The intention of the Prophet is now by
no means doubtful.

<span id="iii.xiv.xii-p9"></span>But we hence conclude, that what God
daily promises to his Church is not to be extended indiscriminately to
all, for many falsely profess his name: but he knows his own, as Paul
says, and therefore exhorts them to depart from iniquity. (<span
id="iii.xiv.xii-p9.1"></span>[2Ti
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.xii-p9.1"></span>.) Let us then know that promises of God’s
favor do not appertain to hypocrites: for though he has decreed to deal
kindly and graciously with his Church, he yet continues to diminish it,
so that the third part only remains safe. Whenever then we speak of
God’s mercy towards his Church, and of his aid and help, let us ever
bear in mind the cleansing of which Zechariah now speaks, that God will
reserve the third part, while the greater portion ever runs headlong
into ruin. It is then enough that the third part should be delivered
from destruction. But this verse, as it has already appeared, ought to
be applied to the kingdom of Christ.

<span id="iii.xiv.xii-p10"></span>Literally we read, *the mouth of the
two*; but <span id="iii.xiv.xii-p10.1"></span>פי, *pi*, is to be taken
metaphorically for part or portion. A part then of the two in it, or
*two parts in it*, (the plural is joined with the singular, as often is
the case,) *shall perish, shall be cut off*. The verb <span
id="iii.xiv.xii-p10.2"></span>כרת, *caret*, means to cut off; and then
<span id="iii.xiv.xii-p10.3"></span>גוע, *guo*, signifies to die or to
sink. Though he understands the same things by the two words, it is not
yet an unmeaning repetition; for it might have seemed hard and
unreasonable that only a third part of God’s people should remain. This
diminution of the Church might have disturbed the minds of many, and
might have appeared incredible: hence the Prophet, in order to confirm
what in itself seemed a paradox, says, they *shall die*, they *shall
perish*; it has been so decreed, and you are not to contend with God;
for given up to ruin shall the greater number be, while a few only shall
remain: *the third part* then *shall remain in it*. It follows —

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p2"></span>**9.** And I will bring the third part
through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will
try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear
them: I will say, It *is* my people: and they shall say, The LORD *is*
my God.

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p3"></span>**9.** Et ducam (*vel***,** venire
faciam) tertiam partem per ignem; et conflabo eos sicuti conflatur
argentum: et examinabo eos sicuti probatur aurum: ipse invocabit nomen
meum**,** et ego respondebo ei; et dixi**,** (*vel***,** dicam**,**)
populos meus est; et ipse dicet**,** Iehova Deus meus.

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p5"></span><span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p6"></span>Zechariah proceeds further here, that
when God shall cut off two parts of the people, he will yet save the
third for this end — that it might be proved by various kinds of trials,
and be made to bear many afflictions. With regard to the two parts, the
Lord did not afflict them in order to turn them to repentance, but
resolved wholly to destroy them. The third part then is reserved for
salvation; and yet it is necessary even for them to be cleansed through
many afflictions.

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p7"></span>Very useful is this doctrine; for we
hence first conclude that many, not only from the world, are led into
perdition, but also from the bosom of the Church: for when three hundred
shall profess to worship God, one hundred only, says Zechariah, will be
saved. There are always among the people many hypocrites; nay, the
grains lie hid in the midst of much chaff and refuse; it is therefore
necessary to devote to ruin and eternal death a larger number than those
who shall be saved. Let us then not envy the ungodly, though their
prosperity may disturb us and cause us to grieve. (<span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p7.1"></span>[Ps
37:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p7.1"></span>.) We think them happy; for while God
spares and supports them, they deride us and triumph over our miseries.
But under this circumstance, the Holy Spirit exhorts us to bear
patiently our afflictions; for though for a time the happiness of the
ungodly may goad us, yet God himself declares that they are fattened in
order to be presently slain, when they shall have gathered much fatness.
This is one thing.

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p8"></span>Then it is in the second place added,
that after the greater part, both of the world and of the Church, (at
least such as profess to belong to it,) shall be destroyed, we cannot be
retained in our position, except God often chastises us. Let us then
remember what Paul says, that we are chastised by the Lord, that we may
not perish with the world; and the metaphors which the Prophet adopts
here are to the same purpose; for he says, *I will lead them through the
fire*. He speaks here of the faithful whom God has chosen into
salvation, and whom he has reserved that they might continue safe: yet
he says, that they shall be saved through fire, that is, hard trials.
But he sets forth this still more clearly, *He will prove them*, he
says, *as silver and gold*  <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) The
stubble and the chaff, as John the Baptist teaches us, are indeed cast
into the fire, (<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p12.1"></span>[Mt
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p12.1"></span>,) but without any benefit; for the fire
consumes the refuse and the chaff, and whatever is corruptible. But when
the gold and the silver are put in the fire and are purified, it is done
that greater purity may be produced, and also that what is precious in
these metals may become more apparent: for when the silver is drawn out
of the mine, it differs not much from what is earthy. The same is the
case with gold. But the furnace so purifies the gold and silver from
their dross, that they attain their value and excellency. Hence
Zechariah says, that when God casts his faithful people into the fire,
he does this according to his paternal purpose in order to burn out
their dross, and thus they become gold and silver who were before filthy
and abominable, and in whom much dross abounded. We see then that the
elect of God, even those who may be rightly counted his children, are
here distinguished from the reprobate, however they may profess God’s
name and worship.

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p13"></span>Now this passage is not inconsistent
with that in Isaiah,

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p14"></span>“I have not purified thee as silver
and gold, for thou hast been wholly consumed.”  
(<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p14.2"></span>[Isa
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa048.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p14.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p15"></span>Though God tries his elect by the
fire of afflictions, he yet observes moderation; for they would wholly
faint were he to purify them to the quick. It is however necessary to
pass through this trial of which the Prophet now speaks: and thus the
state of the Church is here described — that it ought to be always and
continually cleansed, for we are altogether unclean; and then, after God
has washed us by his Spirit, still many spots of uncleanness remain in
us; besides, we contract other pollutions, for it cannot be but that
much contagion is derived from those vices by which we are on every side
surrounded.

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p16"></span>He now adds, *He will call on my
name, and I will answer him*  <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md)
With this consideration God mitigates what was in itself hard and
grievous. It is hard to see so many dreadful evils, when God treads
under foot the greater part of the world, and when his vengeance bursts
forth on the Church itself, so that his severity on every side fills us
with fear. But this also is added — that we are daily to feel the fire,
as though God meant to burn us, while yet he does not consume us. Hence
the Prophet shows how these miseries are to be sweetened to us, and how
sorrow becomes not too grievous; for we are tried by the cross and the
scourges and chastisements of God in order that we may call on his name.
Hearing follows calling; and nothing can be more desirable than this.
The Prophet then proves from the happy effect, that there is no reason
for the faithful to murmur against God, or impatiently to bear their
evils, because being purified they can now really flee to him.

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p20"></span>Were any to ask, whether God can by
his Spirit only draw the elect to true religion? If so, why is this fire
of affliction and hard trial necessary? The answer is, that he speaks
not here of what God can do, nor ought we to dispute on the subject, but
be satisfied with what he has appointed. It is his will then, that his
own people should pass through the fire and be tried by various
afflictions, for this purpose — that they may sincerely call on his
name. We must at the same time learn that it is the true preparation by
which the Lord brings back the elect to himself, and forms in them a
sincere concern for religion, when he tries them by the cross and by
various chastisements; for prosperity is like mildew or the rust. We
cannot then look to God with clear eyes, except our eyes be cleansed.
But this cleansing, as I have said, is what God has appointed as the
means by which he has resolved to render his Church submissive. It is
therefore necessary that we should be subject, from first to last, to
the scourges of God, in order that we may from the heart call on him;
for our hearts are enfeebled by prosperity, so that we cannot make the
effort to pray. But this consolation is ever to be applied to ease our
sorrows, when our flesh leads us either to perverseness or to despair;
let this remedy occur to us, that though chastisement is hard while it
is felt, it ought yet to be estimated by what it produces, as the
Apostle also reminds us in <span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p20.1"></span>[Heb
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p20.1"></span>. Let us especially know that the name of
God is then seriously invoked, when we are subdued, and all ferocity,
and all the indulgence of the flesh, are corrected in us: for we are
like untamed heifers, as Jeremiah says, when God indulges us. (<span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p20.2"></span>[Jer
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p20.2"></span>.) Hence the discipline of the cross is
necessary, so that earnest prayer may become vigorous in us.

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p21"></span>He shows at last how God may be
invoked, for we are taught that he will be kind and propitious to us,
whenever called upon. It would not indeed be enough for us to groan
under the burden of afflictions, and to be thus awakened to prayer,
except God himself allured us and gave us hope of favor. Hence the
Prophet adds, *I will say, My people they are; and they will say,
Jehovah our God is he*. The Prophet in short means, that unless the
promises of God shine on us, and invite us to prayer, no sincere prayer
can ever be drawn from us. How so? Because we first come to God by faith
alone, and this opens the gate to us, and all prayers not founded on
faith are rejected; and further, we know that men naturally dread the
presence of God, and will do so until he gives them a taste of his
goodness and love. Hence what Zechariah says here is especially worthy
of notice, — that God’s word precedes, so that we may follow with
confidence, and be able to enter through the gate opened to prayer, for
except he first says, “ye are my people,” we cannot claim the privilege
of entering into his presence and say, “thou art our God.” For who has
bound God to us, that he should be a God to us? even he himself; for he
has bound himself to us when he promised that we shall be his people.
There is then, as I have said, no right beginning to prayer until we are
taught that God is ready to hear our prayers, as it is said in <span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p21.1"></span>[Ps
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p21.1"></span>, “Thou God hearest prayers, and all
flesh shall come to thee.”

<span id="iii.xiv.xiv"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.xiv-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="iii.xiv.xiv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou sees
that we are full of so many sinful desires, which defile whatever purity
thou hast conferred on us by thy Spirit, — O grant, that we may daily
profit under thy scourges, and so submit ourselves to be ruled by thee,
as to become resigned and obedient, even when thou dealest with us with
unusual severity; and may we ever taste of the sweetness of thy goodness
in thy greatest rigour, and know that thou thereby providest for our
safety, and leadest us towards perfect purity, from which we are as yet
far distant, so that we may be obedient to thee in this world, and
become hereafter partakers of that victory which Christ has procured for
us, and enjoy with him his triumph in thy heavenly kingdom. — Amen.

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p8"></span> *Jerome* and *Cyril* say that the
“fountain” is baptism; but *Theodoret* with more wisdom considered it to
be the blood of Christ. *Marckius* regarded it as the grace of God
flowing to us through the merits of the Redeemer, and applied for
justification and sanctification. The word “fountain,” says *Drusius*,
intimates the perennity and abundance of grace. — *Ed.*

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p11"></span> The house of David and the inhabitants
of Jerusalem were specifically mentioned, says *Grotius*, because they
had grievously offended. The design seems to have been to point out
those who had been most guilty, who had been themselves the murderers of
their own Messiah. This fountain was yet opened for them. — *Ed*.

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p16"></span>Our version cannot be mended “for sin
and for uncleanness.” The latter word, \[<span
id="iii.xiv.i-p16.1"></span>נדה\], has been strangely rendered by some.
Its first meaning is removal or separation, which took place in case of
uncleanness: but it is also used to designate the *cause* of removal,
even uncleanness, and that generally, as we find from <span
id="iii.xiv.i-p16.2"></span>[Ezr
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/ezr009.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.i-p16.2"></span>, where the “land” is said to be “unclean
(\[<span id="iii.xiv.i-p16.3"></span>נדה\]) with the filthiness (\[<span
id="iii.xiv.i-p16.4"></span>נדת\]) of the people,” or rather polluted
with the pollution of the people “of the lands.” It is used in this text
as synonymous with \[<span id="iii.xiv.i-p16.5"></span>טמא\], which
means what is unclean, defiled, or polluted. See <span
id="iii.xiv.i-p16.6"></span>[Ezr
6:21](../../../bib/kjv/ezr006.htm#021.md)<span id="iii.xiv.i-p16.6"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.i-p17"></span>This verse is most strangely rendered by
the *Septuagint*, in a way quite unaccountable. The three other versions
— Aq., *Sym*., and *Theod*., — are not very far from the original. —
*Ed.*

id="iii.xiv.iv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p15"></span> Or, “the spirit which pollutes,” or,
“the polluted spirit.” It is rendered “the unclean (\[<span
id="iii.xiv.iv-p15.1"></span>ακαθαρτον\]) spirit,” by the *Septuagint*,
a phrase used often in the gospels. The word \[<span
id="iii.xiv.iv-p15.2"></span>טמא\], polluting, or polluted, stands
opposed to \[<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p15.3"></span>קדש\], holy, applied to
the divine Spirit. If it be rendered polluting, the effect produced by
it is designated, or, if polluted, the character of the Spirit itself.
It is no doubt the same with the “lying spirit,” mentioned by Micaiah,
<span id="iii.xiv.iv-p15.4"></span>[1Ki
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.iv-p15.4"></span>. “He thus calls,” says *Drusius*, “either
the emotions excited in the heart by the evil spirit, *i.e.*, Satan, or
the impure doctrine of the false prophets which proceeds from the impure
spirit.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_171"></span>[172](cc30016.htm#fr_171.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.v-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p12"></span> From the tenor of the preceding and the
following remarks, it appears evident that *Calvin*, in common with
almost all the Reformers, considered that heretics are worthy of death,
and that it is the duty of the Christian public to inflict on them this
punishment. The defence then which has been unwisely set up for him, is
without foundation. Toleration was not understood in his day. The
Papists certainly can throw no stone at him, for he only adhered to a
principle which he had derived from them, and defended it with arguments
which have been often used by themselves. Nor is it a right for
Protestants in the present day to fall foul on Calvin *alone*, since he
held a principle which nearly all the Reformers maintained.

<span id="iii.xiv.v-p13"></span>We see by what is here said how the
principle was defended, that is, by borrowing what was peculiar to the
old dispensation, and adding it to the New, forgetting, at the same
time, the character of the gospel, that its weapons are not carnal, are
not human force or power, but such as are mighty only through God to the
pulling down of strongholds. “The Son of man is not come to destroy
men’s lives, but to save them.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_172"></span>[173](cc30016.htm#fr_172.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p13.4"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p14"></span> 

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p15"></span>*For* another *man hath possessed me
from my youth.*—Newcome

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p16"></span>*For I have been in a state of slavery
from my youth.*—Henderson

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p17"></span>The latter is a very loose paraphrase;
the first is the literal rendering; “another” need not be have been put
in. “Disclaiming all pretensions to the character of a prophet, he shall
profess himself to be no other than a plain laboring man, employed in
husbandry business by those whose property he had been, <span
id="iii.xiv.vii-p17.1"></span>*quasi* *adstrictus glebae*, from his
youth.” — *Blayney*.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p18"></span>The line may be rendered, as proposed
by *Parkhurst*,

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p19"></span>For man has purchased me in my youth.

<span id="iii.xiv.vii-p20"></span> — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_173"></span>[174](cc30016.htm#fr_173.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.x-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.x-p9"></span> This verse may be thus rendered —

<span id="iii.xiv.x-p10"></span>*When* one *shall say to him,  
“Why* are *these wounds in thine hands?”  
Then he will say,  
“Because I have been smitten at home by my friends,”* or

<span id="iii.xiv.x-p11"></span>by my lovers, \[<span
id="iii.xiv.x-p11.1"></span>מאהבי\].

<span id="iii.xiv.x-p12"></span>*Grotius*, *Blayney*, and *Henderson*,
consider the “wounds” or stripes, punctures or marks, to have been those
made in honor of some idol, and ascribed to friends for the purpose of
escaping punishment: but the obvious meaning is that stated by *Calvin*,
— that they were the wounds inflicted by the nearest relatives,
particularly mentioned in the 3rd verse, “and pierce him shall his
father and his mother,” etc. *Marckius*, *Adam* *Clarke*, and
*Henderson*, agree with *Calvin* in repudiating the notion that this
verse is to be understood by Papal expositors: but *Henry* and *Scott*
refer to the sentiment without condemning or approving it. Both *Jerome*
and *Theodoret* refer, as it is done here, to the punishment inflicted
by the parents; and it is strange that any sound expounder could do
otherwise. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_174"></span>[175](cc30016.htm#fr_174.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p16.7"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.xi-p17"></span> Much as been written about this word,
but unnecessarily. It occurs about nine times in Leviticus, and nowhere
else but here, and is rendered “neighbor,” and, “one another.” <span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p17.1"></span>[Lev.
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#012.md), [Lev.
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p17.1"></span>, etc. “Against the man who is near into
me,” is *Newcome’s* version; *Henderson’s* is, “who is united to me;”
and *Blayney* paraphrases the two words thus, “him that is next to me in
favor and authority,” conceiving that the word \[<span
id="iii.xiv.xi-p17.2"></span>גבר\], is not simply a man, but one
superior to others in strength, power, or authority.” To deduce from
this word an argument in favor of our Lord’s divinity seems an
over-strained criticism. A neighbor, it is true, is one of the same
nature with ourselves, but he is also a member of the same society, and
of a similar station in the community, on which account he is especially
called a neighbor. The view that *Calvin* takes of the word, is no doubt
the correct one; and the same is taken by *Newcome*, *Archbishop
Secker*, and *Blayney*

<span id="fn_175"></span>[176](cc30016.htm#fr_175.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p9"></span> I would render the first lines of
this verse thus —

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p10"></span>*And I will bring the third part into
the fire,  
And will purify them as he who purifies silver,  
*or*, as the purifier of silver,*

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p11"></span>*And will try them as he who tries
gold,  
*or*, as the trier of gold.*

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p12"></span>The participle following “as” I
regard as active, and not passive, as made by the Punctuists. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_176"></span>[177](cc30016.htm#fr_176.md) <span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p17"></span> The singular number “he,” or rather
“it,” refers to “the third part” at the beginning of the verse.
*Henderson*, renders these lines literally, “It shall invoke my name,”
etc. According to our version and *Newcome*, this is partly done. It
would be better in a translation to adopt the plural throughout —

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p18"></span>They shall call on my name,  
And I will answer them;  
And I will say, “My people are they;”  
And they will say, “Jehovah is our God.”

<span id="iii.xiv.xiii-p19"></span>There is a conversive \[<span
id="iii.xiv.xiii-p19.1"></span>ו\] wanting before “say” in the third
line, for the verb is in the past tense; it is supplied by the
*Septuagint*, the *Syriac*, and the *Arabic*. Here is an instance of
manifest omission, not supported by any MS., but by the early versions.
— *Ed.*
