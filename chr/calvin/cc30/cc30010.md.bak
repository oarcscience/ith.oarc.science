7:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.viii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p2"></span>**1.** And it came to pass in the
fourth year of king Darius, *that* the word of the LORD came unto
Zechariah in the fourth *day* of the ninth month, *even* in Chisleu;

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p3"></span>**1.** Et factus est (datus est**,**)
anno quarto Darii regis**,** sermo Iehovae ad Zachariam**,** quarta die
mensis noni Chisleu;

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p4"></span>**2.** When they had sent unto the
house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the
LORD,

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p5"></span>**2.** Nam miserat in domum Dei (hoc
est**,** Templum) Sareezer et Regem-melech et viros ejus ad deprecandam
faciem Iehovae (aut**,** Miserat in domum Dei Sareezer et
Regem-melech**,** in nominativo casu**,** et viri ejus ad deprecandam
faciem Iehovae:)

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p6"></span>**3.** *And* to speak unto the priests
which *were* in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets,
saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have
done these so many years?

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p7"></span>**3.** Ad dicendum sacerdotibus qui
erant in domo Iehovae exercituum**,** et Prophetis**,** dicendo**,** An
flebo mense**,** quinto? Separabo me? quemadmodum feci his annis? (est
turbata series verborum**,** quemadmodum solitus sum facere his annis?)

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p8"></span> 

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p9"></span><span id="iii.viii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p10"></span>There is no vision here, but the
answer which Zechariah was commanded to give to the messengers of the
captives: for he says that some had been sent from Chaldea to offer
sacrifices to God, and at the same time to inquire whether the fast,
which they had appointed when the city was taken and destroyed, was to
be observed. But there is some ambiguity in the words of the Prophet,
for it is doubtful whether the two whom he names, even Sherezer and
Regem-melech, together with the others, had sent the messengers of whom
mention is made, or they themselves came and brought the message from
the captives. But this is a matter of no great moment. As to the
question itself, I am disposed to adopt their view, who think that these
two came with their associates to Jerusalem, and in the name of them all
inquired respecting the fast, as we shall hereafter see.  <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md) The Jews think that these were Persian
princes; but this opinion is frivolous. They are thus accustomed to draw
whatever occurs to the glory of their own nation without any discretion
or judgment, as though it had been an object much desired by the Jews,
that two Persian should go up to the temple. But there is no need here
of a long discussion; for if we regard the Prophet’s design, we may
easily conclude that these were Jews who had been sent by the exiles,
both to offer gifts and to inquire about the fast, as the Prophet tells
us. The sum of the whole then is, that Sherezer and Regem-melech, and
their companions, came to the temple, and that they also asked counsel
of the priests and Prophets, whether the fast of the fifth month was
still to be observed.

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p21"></span>It must first be observed, that though
all had not so much courage as to return to their own country as soon as
leave was given them, they were not yet gross despisers of God, and
wholly destitute of all religion. It was indeed no light fault to remain
torpid among the Babylonians when a free return was allowed them; for it
was an invaluable kindness on the part of God to stretch forth his hand
to the wretched exiles, who had wholly despaired of a return. Since then
God was prepared to bring them home, such a favor could not have been
neglected without great ingratitude. But it was yet the Lord’s will that
some sparks of grace should continue in the hearts of some, though their
zeal was not so fervid as it ought to have been. The same sloth we see
in the present day to be in many, who continue in the filth of Popery;
and yet they groan there, and the Lord preserves them, so that they do
not shake off every concern for religion, nor do they wholly fall away.
All then are not to be condemned as unfaithful, who are slothful and
want vigor; but they are to be stimulated. For they who indulge their
torpor act very foolishly; but at the same time they ought to be pitied,
when there is not in them that desirable alacrity in devoting themselves
to God, which they ought to have. Such an instance then we see in the
captives, who ought to have immediately prepared themselves for the
journey, when a permission was given them by the edicts of Cyrus and
Darius. They however remained in exile, but did not wholly renounce the
worship of God; for they sent sacred offerings, by which they professed
their faith; and they also inquired what they were to do, and showed
deference to the priests and Prophets then at Jerusalem. It hence
appears, that they were not satisfied with themselves, though they did
not immediately amend what was wrong. There are many now, who, in order
to exculpate themselves, or rather to wipe away (as they think) all
disgrace, despise God’s word, and treat us with derision; nay, they
devise crimes with which they charge us, with the view of vilifying the
word of the Lord in the estimation of the simple. But the Prophet shows
that the captives of whom he speaks, though not so courageous as they
ought to have been were yet true servants of God; for they sent
sacrifices to the temple, and also wished to hear and to learn what they
were to do.

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p22"></span><span id="iii.viii.ii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p23"></span>He says first, that messengers were
sent to *entreat the face of Jehovah*. Here by the word entreating or
praying, the Prophet means also sacrifices. For it is certain that the
Jews prayed in exile, as there could have been no religion in them had
they not exercised themselves in prayer. But the mention made here is of
that stated prayer, connected with sacrifices, by which they professed
themselves to be God’s people. We may hence also learn, that sacrifices
of themselves are of no great importance, since prayer, or calling on
God, has ever the first place. Sacrifices then, and other offerings,
were, as we may say, additions; (*accessoria* — accessions;) for this
command ought ever to be regarded by the faithful,

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p24"></span>“offer to me the sacrifice of praise.”
(<span id="iii.viii.ii-p24.1"></span>[Ps
50:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.viii.ii-p24.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p25"></span>He says, in the second place, that
messengers were sent, that they might learn from the priests and the
Prophets what was to them doubtful. We hence conclude, that it was no
gross dissimulation, such as is found in hypocrites who pretend to pray
to God, but that there was a real desire to obey. And, doubtless, when
God’s word and celestial truth are despised, there is then neither any
real prayer, nor any other religious exercise; for unbelief pollutes and
contaminates whatever is otherwise in its nature sacred. Whosoever then
desires rightly to pray to God, let him add faith, that is, let him come
to God in a teachable frame of mind, and seek to be ruled by his word.
For the Prophet in telling us what was done, no doubt keeps to the
method or the order observed by the captives. It was then worthy of
praise that they not only were anxious to seek God’s favor by prayers
and sacrifices, but that they also sought to know what was pleasing to
Cod. Nor was it a matter of wonder that they sent to Jerusalem on this
account, for they knew that that place had been chosen by God as the
place from which they were to seek the right knowledge of religion.
Since then Jerusalem was the sanctuary of God, the captives sent there
their messengers, particularly as they knew that the priests were the
ambassadors of God, and that the interpretation of the law was to be
sought from their mouth. They indeed knew that the time was not yet come
when the doctrine of salvation was to be disseminated through the whole
world.

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p26"></span>But the Prophet says, that the
captives not only inquired of the priests, but also of the Prophets. It
hence appears, that it was a thing commonly known, that God had raised
up Prophets, which he had ceased to do for a long time. For it was not
without reason that Isaiah said, that God would yet speak by his
Prophets, when he would again comfort his people. (<span
id="iii.viii.ii-p26.1"></span>[Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.viii.ii-p26.1"></span>.) There had been then a mournful silence
for seventy years, when no Prophets were sent forth, according to what
is said in the book of Psalms,

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p27"></span>“our signs we see not, nor is there a
Prophet among us.”  
(<span id="iii.viii.ii-p27.2"></span>[Ps
74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.viii.ii-p27.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p28"></span>God indeed had been accustomed to lead
the people as by an erected banner when they dwelt in the holy land, and
Prophets continually succeeded one another in regular order, according
to what the Lord had promised by Moses,

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p29"></span>“A Prophet will I raise up in the
midst of thee,” etc.  
(<span id="iii.viii.ii-p29.2"></span>[De
18:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.viii.ii-p29.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p30"></span>From the time then in which they had
been driven into exile, while looking there on one another, they could
hear no voice to encourage them with hope, until new Prophets were again
raised up beyond what they expected. And it was God’s will that the
Prophets should have their abode and habitation at Jerusalem, in order
that he might gather the dispersed Israel; for had there been Prophets
in Chaldea, many might hence lay hold of a pretext for their
slothfulness: “Does not God dwell in the midst of us? what need is there
of undertaking a difficult and toilsome journey? we shall indeed find
nothing better at Jerusalem than in this exile; for God shows that he is
present with us by his Prophets.” It would have therefore been a great
evil to the Jews to have Prophets in their exile. But when the captives
heard that the gift of prophecy appeared again in the temple, they might
have called to mind what their fathers had heard from the mouth of
Isaiah, and also from the mouth of Micah, “from Zion shall go forth a
law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.” (<span
id="iii.viii.ii-p30.1"></span>[Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.viii.ii-p30.1"></span> <span id="iii.viii.ii-p30.2"></span>[Mic
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.viii.ii-p30.2"></span>.) We now perceive why Zechariah joined
Prophets to priests.

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p31"></span>But we must bear in mind what we have
stated elsewhere that the prophetic was, as it were, an extraordinary
office, when God took others as the ministers of his word besides the
priests. For their work was sacerdotal; but God meant to condemn the
priests by transferring the work of teaching to others, that is, when
Prophets were taken from the common people, or from other families, and
not from the Levitical tribe. It is not indeed true that all the priests
were Prophets; but the office itself would not have been transferred to
any other tribe, had not God thus punished the ingratitude of those who
bestowed more labor on their own private concerns than on teaching the
people. However this case may have been, it was an illustrious testimony
of God’s favor, that Prophets at that time had again been raised up. And
this fact has been added — that they dwelt nowhere else but at
Jerusalem, in order to encourage the dispersed to return, and to show to
them that the place had not in vain been previously chosen by God. This
is the reason why the Prophet expressly says, that the Prophets, as well
as the priests, were in the house or in the temple of the Lord of hosts.

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p32"></span>The time is also mentioned, *the
fourth year of Darius, and the ninth month* and *the fourth day*  <span
id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md) The beginning of the year, we know, was
in March; hence the month Chisleu was November, or a part of October and
November, for they were wont to commence their months at the new moons.
Of king Darius we have spoken elsewhere. He was not, indeed, the first
Darius, the father-in-law of Cyrus, who transferred the monarchy to the
Persian, but Darius the son of Hystaspes. Passed away then had the
seventy years, for this, as it has been stated before, was the fourth
king.

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p34"></span><span id="iii.viii.ii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p35"></span>Let us now consider the question which
the captives proposed to the priests. They asked whether they were to
weep in the fifth month, and whether they were to separate themselves as
they had done for seventy years and more; for some years, as we have
seen, had elapsed beyond that number. We hence learn that a regular fast
was observed from the time in which the temple was burned and the city
destroyed. He speaks here only of the fifth month, but shortly after
mention is made of the seventh month. It is evident from sacred history
that the city was demolished and the temple pulled down in the fifth
month. It is therefore probable that there was a day of mourning
observed by the people in memory of that sad event. In the seventh
month, though not in the same year, Gedaliah was slain, and the
remainder of the people were driven into exile. As the land became then
desolate, it is also probable that another fast was appointed, that they
might yearly humble themselves before God, and suppliantly seek his
pardon. Since then there was a reason for both fasts, it is evident that
they could not have been condemned by the priests: nor is there a doubt,
but that it was by the public consent of all, that they every year kept
these days of weeping. We also see the end which God has in view in
prescribing a fast, — that men in coming to him may feel true penitence,
and remind themselves by their external appearance of their own guilt.
As then the Jews observed this rule in their fasts, we must conclude
that they pleased God; for these were religious exercises, by which they
might have been led to repentance.

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p36"></span>Now they inquired, whether they were
to continue their weeping; for the temple had now been begun to be built
as well as the city. Since the reason for their mourning had been, that
the temple no longer stood where they might offer their sacrifices, and
that the holy city had been demolished, it was then doubtless right to
give thanks to God, and to feel joy, when an end came to their
calamities. However, the captives ventured not to change anything
without the authority and consent of the priests, so that they might all
agree together. And thus they also testified that they were true members
of the Church, as they had no desire to have anything different from
others.

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p37"></span>The word fast is not mentioned; but
they asked, “Shall we weep?” Hence also it appears, that they were not
so gross in their ideas as to think that the chief part of religion is
fasting, as hypocrites do, who imagine that they honor God by abstaining
from food, and thus mock God, who is a Spirit, with mere trifles, when
it is his express will to be spiritually worshipped. We then plainly
see, that the Jews were not imbued with this gross and foolish thought,
when they established this annual fast; for they put weeping in the
place of fasting. And why was this weeping, except that they went into
God’s presence conscious of their guilt and in a suppliant manner, and
testified by external signs that they acknowledged their sins, so that
they might obtain mercy and forgiveness?

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p38"></span>They mentioned also *consecration*.
The word <span id="iii.viii.ii-p38.1"></span>נזר, *nezar*, which means
to separate, is variously explained: but here many interpreters confine
it to abstinence from food, as though they had said, “Shall we separate
ourselves from food?”  <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) This seems
forced to me: I therefore prefer to apply it to sanctification; for we
know that when a day was prescribed for fasting or for offering
sacrifices, there was sanctification added. For though it became the
Jews through their whole life to abstain from all defilements, yet we
know that when a fast or any particular sacrifice was appointed, they
were more diligent and solicitous to cast aside every pollution. We now
then understand what the Jews had in view, and what they meant by these
words. It now follows —

<span id="iii.viii.iii"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.viii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
7:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#004.md)<span

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p2"></span>**4.** Then came the word of the LORD
of hosts unto me, saying,

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p3"></span>**4.** Et datus sermo Iehovae

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p4"></span>**5.** Speak unto all the people of
the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the
fifth and seventh *month*, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p8"></span>**7.** *Should ye* not *hear* the

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p10"></span>**8.** And the word of the LORD came
unto Zechariah, saying,

et beneficentiam et misericordias facite quisque cum fratre suo.

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p14"></span> 

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p15"></span><span id="iii.viii.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p16"></span>Here the Prophet tells us that he was
sent to the people and to the priests, not so much to teach the
messengers who came from distant lands, as to correct the vices of his
own nation; for the Jews had then begun, according to their usual
manner, to dissemble with God, and had glided, as it has elsewhere
appeared, into many evil practices. And it appears evident, that God did
not commit to Zechariah what the messengers might bring back to Chaldea;
but that an occasion was taken to remind the Jews, that they were to
look to themselves. It may have been the case, that the priests
themselves and all the rest had begun to raise a controversy, “How is
this? our brethren inquire, whether the fast is to be still observed:”
and the opinions might have been various. But as this is doubtful, I
leave it as such. We however see that the Prophet does not speak here
respecting the captives, nor does he address to their messengers
anything which they might convey to Chaldea, but turns his discourse to
the priests and to the people. The sum of the whole is, that while the
captives gave no mean testimony of their religion, God reproved the
Jews, who had returned to their own country, for ingratitude, as they
had already begun to pollute themselves.

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p17"></span><span id="iii.viii.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p18"></span>He therefore brings this charge
against them, *Have ye fasted to me? have ye eaten to me?* as though he
had said, “God regards not fastings, except they proceed from a sincere
feeling and tend to a right and lawful end.” It was then the object of
the Prophet to awaken the Jews, that they might not imagine that God was
pacified by fasting or by any other frigid ceremonies, but that they
might know that something more was required. And we see how prone
mankind are to rely on external rites, and to think that they have
rightly performed their duty to God when they have fasted. As then human
nature labors under this disease, the Prophet is here sent to dissipate
this delusion; which he does by declaring that fasting does not please
God, or is acceptable to him, as though it were something meritorious,
or as though there was in it any holiness.

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p19"></span>He says first, that *the word of
Jehovah was given* to him, that he might go to *the people of the land
and to the priests*. We see the truth of what I have already said, that
the answer was not directed to the captives, but to the very inhabitants
of the land and to the citizens of Jerusalem, and for this reason, —
because they thought that when the question respecting fasting was
moved, the first and chief part of all religion was the subject of
inquiry. Hence God, that he might strip them of this superstition, says,
*When ye fasted in the fifth month and in the seventh month, and during
the seventy years*, did ye fast to me — to me? for he has put an affix
to the verb, <span id="iii.viii.iii-p19.1"></span>צמתני, *tsametni*, and
afterwards added <span id="iii.viii.iii-p19.2"></span>אני, *ani*: as
though he had said, “Was it to me that ye fasted? Shall I approve of
such fasting?” There is an emphasis in the repetition, as though he had
said, that there was no reason for the Jews to boast that they
faithfully served God, and fully performed their duty, because they
fasted twice in the year, for they had to do with that God who rejected
such trifling things.

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p20"></span>We hence learn that nothing is more
preposterous than for men to judge of God’s worship according to their
own notions, and to trust in themselves. It is indeed easy for us to
deceive ourselves; for as we are earthly, so we may think that whatever
glitters before our eyes is most acceptable to God. But the Prophet here
reminds us, by one sentence, how frivolous are such self-pleasing
thoughts; for God meets us with this question, *“Have ye fasted to me?*
Are ye to be judges, and is it right for you at your pleasure to invent
various modes of worship? But I remain always like myself, and not
transform me according to what pleases you; for I repudiate everything
of this kind.”

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p21"></span><span id="iii.viii.iii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p22"></span>By saying, that *to themselves they
did* *eat and drink*, he intimates that to eat and to drink, or to
abstain from eating and drinking, are things wholly unconnected with the
worship of God. Another sense may indeed be elicited, — that the Jews
did eat as heathens did: and there will be in this case an indirect
reproof, — that they sought to pacify God only twice in the year, and
that during the rest of the time they were heedless and indulged
themselves in excesses. We ought indeed to bear in mind what Paul says,
that

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p23"></span>“whether we eat or drink, all things
ought to be done  
to the praise of God.” (<span id="iii.viii.iii-p23.2"></span>[1Co
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031.md)<span
id="iii.viii.iii-p23.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p24"></span>The law also expressly commanded the
Jews to “feast before the Lord,” that is, not to taste food without
thanksgiving, as though God were present. When, therefore, the Jews
fasted themselves without any regard to God, it is no wonder that their
fastings where rejected; for their course was not consistent. For though
the godly do not always fast, yet while they partake most freely of meat
and drink, they turn not away their thoughts from God, but on the
contrary rejoice before him. They therefore eat and drink to God, as
well as abstain on God’s account. But the Prophet shows here that the
Jews *did eat to themselves*, and that hence their fasting was not
regarded before God. This latter sense is not unsuitable: but as to the
subject itself, it is enough for us to know, that the Prophet, as he had
to deal with hypocrites, ridicules their superstition in their fastings,
inasmuch as they thought that these were expiations by which their sins
were blotted out, and that if they abstained for a day or two from meat
and drink, God was thereby pacified.

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p25"></span><span id="iii.viii.iii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p26"></span>And the Prophet’s object is more
evident from the next verse, when he says, *Are not these the words
which Jehovah proclaimed by the former Prophets?* He confirms here his
doctrine by many testimonies, that is, that God had already through
successive ages exhorted the Jews to true repentance, and condemned
their dissimulation, that they might not think that true religion was
made up of fasting and of similar things. And this the Prophet did, not
only to gain or secure to himself more credit, but also to render double
the wickedness of the Jews; as though he had said, that they were
apparently very anxious not to offend God, but that it was merely a
false pretense; for had they from the heart wished to please God, they
might have long ago learnt that fastings were of themselves of no
moment, but that a beginning ought to be made with true religion and
spiritual worship.

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p27"></span>I have already mentioned, that
possibly, when the question was raised by the captives, much disputing,
as it is commonly the case, prevailed among the people. But as the Jews
ever reverted to their old ways, being blindly attached to their frigid
ceremonies, and thinking in this manner to propitiate God, the Prophet,
for this reason, derides their preposterous labor and toil. “See,” he
says, “the only question now is, whether there should be fasting, as
though this were the principal thing before God; in the meantime
godliness is neglected, and neglected is real calling on God, and the
whole of spiritual worship is also esteemed by you as nothing, and no
integrity of life prevails: for ye bite one another, plunder one
another, wrong one another, and are guilty of lying: ye heedlessly close
your eyes to such vices as these; and at the same time when fasting is
neglected, ye think that the whole of religion falls to the ground.
These are your old ways, and such were commonly the thoughts and doings
of your fathers; and it appears evident that ye trifle with God, and
that ye are full of deceits, and that there is not in you a particle of
true religion. For God formerly spoke loudly in your ears, and his words
were not obscure when he exhorted you by his Prophets; he showed to you
what true repentance was, but effected nothing. Is it not then quite
evident that ye are now acting deceitfully, when ye so carefully enquire
about fasting?” We now perceive what force there is in this sentence,
*Are not these the words which Jehovah* formerly *proclaimed?* For it
was not enough to remind the Jews of true repentance; but this reproof
was needful, in order more sharply to stimulate them; and it was wholly
necessary to discover their hypocrisy, that they might not be too much
pleased with external performances.

<span id="iii.viii.iii-p28"></span>That they might not then object, that
what they asked respecting God’s counsel was done with a good intention,
the Prophet answers them, “Where are the words by which God had
testified as to what can please him?” And for the same purpose he uses
the word, <span id="iii.viii.iii-p28.1"></span>קרא, *kora*, proclaimed:
for he does not say, that God merely declared words by his Prophets, but
that he uttered them loudly, and as it were with a full mouth. “See,” he
says, “ye enquire as though ye were in doubt, and that the knot could
hardly be untied, and as though it were a matter of great moment. God
has indeed not only spoken, but has also cried aloud in the ears of your
fathers; in the meantime ye tread under foot his teaching, or pass it by
with closed eyes.” What does this mean? to enquire so anxiously about
fasting, and at the same time to despise what is far more important? In
a similar manner does Christ also condemn hypocrites, because they
hesitated not to swallow a camel, while they were wont to strain at a
gnat, (<span id="iii.viii.iii-p28.2"></span>[Mt
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#024.md)<span
id="iii.viii.iii-p28.2"></span>;) for in trifling things they dared not
to attempt anything; but as to gross wickedness, they leaped over it as
it were with the audacity of wild beasts. The object then of the
Prophet’s words was to show that the Jews did not seriously and in
earnest enquire respecting God’s will, but pretended to be very
attentive to religion, while they openly, and with gross and headless
audacity, rejected the true doctrine, which was by no means ambiguous,
as God had by his many Prophets clearly taught them and their fathers
what he required from them.

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="iii.viii.iv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we are so
inclined to dissimulation, we may learn strictly to examine ourselves,
and to descend into our own consciences, so that none of us may sleep in
self-delusion, but be so displeased with our hidden vices, as in the
meantime to aspire after, and with every care and labor, to attain true
religion, and so strive to devote ourselves wholly to thee, that we may
groan under the burden of our sins, and so suppliantly flee to thy
mercy, as at the same time to be touched with true penitence, until
having at length put off the corruptions of our flesh, we shall be
received into that purity which has been prepared for us in heaven by
Jesus Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="iii.viii.v-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Forty-seventh

<span id="iii.viii.v-p2"></span><span id="iii.viii.v-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.v-p3"></span>*Thus saith Jehovah of hosts*,  <span
id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) saying, *The judgment of truth judge, and
kindness and mercies show, every one to his brother*. We have seen what
the Prophet said of fasting, when messengers were sent by the exiles to
enquire on the subject. It was a suitable opportunity for handling the
question. For, as we then said, the people were so devoted to their
ceremonies, as to think that the whole of religion consisted in fasting
and in similar exercises. And as we are by nature prone to this evil, we
ought carefully to consider what the Prophet has taught us — that
fasting is not simply, or by itself, approved by God, but on account of
the end designed by it. Having already shown to the Jews their error, in
thinking that God could be pacified by ceremonies, he now reminds them
of what God mainly requires in his law — that men should observe what is
just and right towards one another. It is indeed true that the first
part of the law refers to the service due to God; but it is a way which
God has commonly adopted, to test the life of men by the duties of the
second Table, and to show what this part of the law especially requires
God then in this passage, as in many others, does not commend
righteousness towards men so as to depreciate godliness; for as this far
excels everything in the whole world, so we know that in rightly forming
the life, the beginning ought ever to be made by serving God aright. But
as the Prophet had to do with hypocrites, he shows that they only
trifled with God, while they made much of external things, and at the
same tinge neglected uprightness, and the duties of love

<span id="iii.viii.v-p5"></span>We now then understand the Prophet’s
object. He had said in the last lecture that he brought forward nothing
new, but only reminded them of what had been taught by other Prophets;
and here he pursues the same subject — that God made more account of
uprightness and kindness than of those legal shadows, which in
themselves were of no moment.

<span id="iii.viii.v-p6"></span>*The judgment of truth*, he says,
*judge*. This could not have been extended indiscriminately to the whole
people; but by these words the Prophet indirectly reproved the judges,
because they committed plunder, either through favor or hatred, so that
they decided cases not in a just and equitable manner. We then learn
from the Prophet’s words, that judgments were then given corruptly, so
that the judge either decided in favor of a friend, or was bought by a
price or a reward. As then there was no truth in the judgments given,
but false pretences and colourings, the Prophet here exhorts them to
execute *the judgment of truth*, that is, true judgment, when no respect
of persons is shown, and when neither hatred nor favor prevails, but
equity alone is regarded.

<span id="iii.viii.v-p7"></span>He then addresses the whole people in
common, and says, *Show*, or exercise, *kindness and mercies*  <span
id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) *every one towards his brother*. He not
only bids them to abstain from doing any wrong, but exhorts them to show
kindness; for it would not be enough to do no harm to any one, except
each of us were also solicitous to assist our neighbors; inasmuch as it
is the dictate of benevolence to help the miserable when necessity so
requires. But we must recollect that a part is given twice for the whole
in what the Prophet says: in the first place, he refers only to the
second Table of the law, while he includes in general the rule by which
our life is to be formed; and in the second place, he enumerates not
every thing contained in the second Table, but mentions only some things
as instances. It is however certain, that his design was to show that
men are greatly deceived when they seek to discharge their duties
towards God by means of external rites and ceremonies; and farther, that
it is a true and substantial evidence of piety, when and one observes
what is just and equitable towards his neighbor. He afterwards adds —

<span id="iii.viii.vi"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p1"></span><span
id="iii.viii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#010.md)<span

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p2"></span>**10.** And oppress not the widow, nor
the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine
evil against his brother in your heart.

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p3"></span>**10.** Et viduam et pupillum**,**

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p5"></span><span id="iii.viii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p6"></span>He mentions here some other duties, but
for the same purpose of showing, that the fear of God is not proved by
ceremonies, but by acting justly towards our brethren, and not by
abstaining only from doing wrong, but by being ready to help the
miserable. As widows, and orphans, and strangers are exposed as it were
to plunder, Moses often in the law recommends them to favor, and shows
that God cares for them, and will be their defender, when by one
injured. So also the Prophet speaks here expressly of widows, and
orphans, and strangers, that the Jews might understand, not only that
they were to take heed, lest any one, being wronged, should complain, or
lest any one should retaliate an injury, but that they were to observe
integrity before God; for the ungodly are often terrified by fear, and
refrain from doing mischief, because they know that there will be an
avenger. Hence it comes that the rich and the opulent are safe from all
injuries, because they are surrounded and fortified by strong defences;
but the widows and the orphans are not thus able to repel wrongs. This
is the reason why the Prophet prefers here to mention widows, and
orphans, and strangers, rather than to speak indiscriminately of all the
people. For the import of the whole is, as I have reminded you, that the
fear of God is not really proved, except when a person cleaves to what
is just and right, and is not restrained by fear or shame, but
discharges his duty as it were in the presence of God and of his angels,
so that he shows favor to the poor and miserable, who are without any to
help them. But as I have elsewhere explained this subject more at large,
it is enough now briefly to touch on it.  <span
id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) Let us proceed —

<span id="iii.viii.vii"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.viii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
7:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.viii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p2"></span>**11.** But they refused to hearken,
and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should
not hear.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p3"></span>**11.** Et renuerent attendere**,** et

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p4"></span>**12.** Yea, they made their hearts
*as* an adamant-stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words
which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets:
therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p5"></span>**12.** Et cor suum posuerunt
adamantem**,** ne audirent verba quae miserat Iehova exercituum in
Spiritu suo**,** in manu prophetarum superiorum; et fuit ira magna a
Iehova exercituum.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p6"></span> 

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p7"></span><span id="iii.viii.vii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p8"></span>The Prophet here by referring to the
fathers more sharply reproves the Jews of his age; for he saw that they
differed but little from their fathers. The sum of what he says is, that
the Jews in all ages dealt unfaithfully and perversely with God; for how
much soever they boasted of their care and zeal for religion they yet
sought to satisfy God only by vain trifles. This then was the Prophet’s
object. For it is certain that there ever had been some pretense to
religion in that nation but it was mere dissimulation for they were in
the mean time intent on their ceremonies and when God seriously
remonstrated with them their obstinacy and perverseness before concealed
instantly appeared.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p9"></span>He therefore says that they *refused
to hear*. He does not now accuse the dead except for this purpose to
teach the people of his acre. He saw that they were solicitous about
fasting at appointed seasons, while at the same time they regarded
almost as nothing the main requirements of the law, even mercy, and
justice, and uprightness. These are indeed the three things, which
Christ mentions. (<span id="iii.viii.vii-p9.1"></span>[Mt
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md)<span
id="iii.viii.vii-p9.1"></span>.) He then intimates that this doctrine
was not new, and that their fathers had been sufficiently warned and
instructed, but that they wilfully, and as it were designedly rebelled
against God. In short, he pulls off their mask of ignorance; for as men
for the most part seek to extenuate their sins by the plea, that they
had not been clearly or seasonably taught, the Prophet declares that
there was not any excuse of this kind, because they had been refractory
and untameable, they had *refused to hear*

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p10"></span>To set forth more fully this
perverseness, he afterwards says, that the *shoulder of withdrawing* had
been presented by them. The Hebrews say that men serve with the
shoulder, when they are submissive, and tractable, and willingly undergo
the burden laid on them, according to what we have seen in <span
id="iii.viii.vii-p10.1"></span>[Zep
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.viii.vii-p10.1"></span>. The Prophet now, on the contrary, says
that the Jews had a refractory shoulder, as they refused to bear the
yoke, but shook off every fear of God. The reason for the metaphor is
this — that as burdens are carried on the shoulder, so the Lord lays the
law on our shoulders, that the flesh may not lasciviate at pleasure, but
be kept under restraint. He hence says, that they had presented a
rebellious shoulder. The word <span id="iii.viii.vii-p10.2"></span>סררת,
*sarret*, is properly rendered declining; but some render it perverse,
and others contumacious: since the meaning is the same, I contend not
about the word. It is enough to know that the contumacy of the Jews is
what is here condemned; for they had been wholly unteachable, and had
refused to submit to God and to his word.  <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md)

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p19"></span>He afterwards mentions their ears,
*They made heavy their ears, lest they should hear*. In short, the
Prophet sought by all means to prove the Jews guilty, that they might
not adduce anything to extenuate their sin: for they had in every way,
with the most determined wickedness, refused to obey God, when his
teaching was sufficiently clear and intelligible.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p20"></span><span id="iii.viii.vii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p21"></span>He then comes to the heart, *They
made*, he says, *their heart adamant*, or the very hardest stone. Some
render it steel, and others flint. It means sometimes a thorn; but in
this place, as in <span id="iii.viii.vii-p21.1"></span>[Eze
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze003.htm#009.md)<span
id="iii.viii.vii-p21.1"></span>, and in <span
id="iii.viii.vii-p21.2"></span>[Jer
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.viii.vii-p21.2"></span>, it is to be taken for adamant, or the
hardest stone.  <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) We now see that the
Prophet’s object was to show that the Jews had no excuse, as if they had
fallen away through error or ignorance, but had ever wilfully and
perversely rejected sound doctrine. The Prophet then teaches us that
hypocrisy had been the sole hindrance to prevent them from understanding
and following what was right.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p23"></span>But it may be useful to notice the
manner of speaking which the Prophet adopts in condemning the
perverseness of the Jews, when he says, that they had refused attention
to God. For we ought here to observe the connection between the fear of
God and obedience, and on the other hand, between the contempt of the
law and wilful rebellion. If then we would not be condemned for
contumacy before God, attention must in the first place be given to his
word, and afterwards the shoulders must be put under, so that we may
bear submissively the yoke laid on us; and thirdly, we must listen with
the ears, so that the word of God, preached to us, may not be lost, but
strike in us deep roots; and lastly, our hearts must be turned to
obedience, and all hardness corrected or softened. Then Zechariah adds,
that the Jews had a stonily or an iron heart, so that they repudiated
the law of God and all his Prophets. He gives the first place to the
law, for they ought to have sought from it the whole doctrine of
religion; and the Prophets, as it has been often stated, were only
interpreters of the law.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p24"></span>He afterwards mentions the words
which had been sent *by Jehovah through his Spirit and through his
Prophets*  <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) By saying that God spoke
by his Prophets, he meets an objection by which hypocrites are wont to
cover themselves, when they reject the truth. For they object and say,
that they would be willingly submissive to God, but that they cannot
bear the authority of men, as though God’s word changed its nature by
coming through the mouth of man. But as hypocrites and profane men are
wont to lessen the authority of the word, the Prophet here shows, having
this pretext in view, that God designed to be heard, though he employed
ministers. Hence by this kind of concession it is implied, that Prophets
are middle persons, and yet that God so speaks by their mouth, that
contempt is offered to him when no due honor is shown to the truth. And
further, lest the baseness of men should withhold regard from the word,
he mentions also the *Spirit*, as though he had said, that God had
spoken not only by his servants, even mortal men, but also by his
Spirit. There is then no reason for hypocrites deceitfully to excuse
themselves, by saying, that they rebel not against God, when they
depreciate his Prophets; for the power and majesty of the Holy Spirit
appear and shine forth in the doctrine itself, so that the condition of
men takes nothing away from its authority. This part was also added in
order to condemn the Jews, because they had from the very beginning been
seasonably warned, and it was only their own fault that they did not
repent. For if the Lord had allowed them for a long time to go astray,
there would have been some pretense for their evasions: but since God
had tried to recall them to the right way, and Prophets, one after
another, had been continually sent to them, their unfaithfulness, yea
their iron perverseness, in obstinately refusing to obey God, was more
fully discovered. This is the reason why Zechariah mentions here the
former Prophets.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p26"></span>He then adds, that *there was great
wrath from Jehovah of hosts*; by which sentence he reminded them, that
it was no matter of dispute, as in case of a doubtful thing, whether
their fathers had been wicked and disobedient to God; for he had
sufficiently proved be punishments that he abominated their conduct; for
this principle is to be held true that God does not deal unjustly with
men when he chastises them, but that the demerit of crimes is to be
estimated by the punishment which he inflicts. As then God had so
severely chastised the ancient people, the natural conclusion is, that
their wickedness had become intolerable. We now then see why the Prophet
said that there had been *great wrath from* God; the reason was, that
the Jews might not think that he had been lightly offended, as he had
not been satisfied with a moderate punishment; for since his wrath had
been so great, and since he had in so dreadful a manner punished the
sins of the people, it follows, that their wickedness had been more
grievous than what men considered it to have been.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p27"></span>There is also here an implied
comparison; for the unfaithfulness of those who then lived was the
worse, for this reason — because they took no warning from the
calamities of their fathers, so as to deal with more sincerity with God.
They knew that their fathers had been carefully and in various ways
admonished; they knew that exile followed, which was an evidence of the
dreadful vengeance of God. As then they were like their fathers, and had
not put off their perverse disposition, they proved themselves guilty of
greater and more refractory baseness, for they ought to have been
influenced at least by fear, when they saw that God’s judgment had been
so dreadful against obstinate men. It afterwards follows —

<span id="iii.viii.viii"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.viii.viii-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.viii.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p2"></span>**13.** Therefore it is come to pass,
*that* as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would
not hear, saith the Lord of hosts.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p3"></span>**13.** Et fuit**,** sicuti clamavit
et non audierunt**,** sic clamabunt et non audiam**,** dicit Iehova
exercituum.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p5"></span><span id="iii.viii.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p6"></span>The Prophet sets forth more fully the
dreadfulness of this punishment — that they in vain groaned and
complained, for God was deaf to their complaints and cryings. When God
in some measure fulminates and becomes soon reconciled, he does not seem
to be greatly incensed, but when the miserable whom he afflicts by his
hand, avail nothing by their entreaties and prayers, it then appears
evident that God is in no common degree offended. This then is what the
Prophet meant by saying, that they were not *heard* by God when they
cried.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p7"></span>But we must notice what is said of
their perverseness; for he says, that God had called, and that he was
not heard by them. Now it cannot be deemed an unjust reward, that God
should punish the contempt of his word; for how great is the honor by
which he favors miserable wretches, when he invites them to himself, and
most expressly invites them? When, therefore, the calling of God is thus
rejected and despised, do not they who are so refractory deserve what
the Prophet declares here — that they would have to cry in vain, as God
would be deaf to their groanings?

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p8"></span>As to the words, the change of person
may embarrass the unlettered, but it is a mode of speaking common to the
Prophets, for they assume the person of God in order to gain more
authority to their doctrine; and they spoke sometimes in the third and
sometimes in the first person: when in the first God himself speaks, and
when in the third it is in the character of ministers, who declare and
deliver, as it were from hand to hand, what had been committed to them
by God. Hence the Prophet in the first clause speaks as God’s minister;
he afterwards assumes his person, as though he were God himself. But
this, as it has been said, was done with regard to the word delivered.
*It was, that as he called and they heard not*, *etc*. Who called? It is
not right to apply this, as some do, to the Prophet; he, therefore,
charges here the Jews, no doubt, with the sin of turning a deaf ear to
God’s word. *So*, he says, *they shall call, and I will not hear*. It
might have been said, “so they shall call, and the Lord will not hear.”
There is in the meaning, as we see, nothing obscure or ambiguous.  <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md)

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p19"></span>The import of the whole then is,
that God had not threatened in vain by his ancient Prophets; but that as
he had denounced vengeance by the mouth of Isaiah, so it had been
executed on the Jews, for they had without effect cried, and found God a
severe judge, whose voice they had previously despised. We indeed know,
that it is a truth often repeated, that the ungodly are not heard by
God; nay, that their prayers are abominable; for they profane God’s name
by an impure heart and mouth whenever they flee to him, as they approach
him without faith and repentance. We then learn from these words, that
those who perversely despise God’s word deservedly rot in their own
calamities; for it is by no means right or reasonable that the Lord
should be ready to hear the crying of those who turn a deaf ear to his
voice. It follows —

<span id="iii.viii.ix"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.ix-p1"></span><span
id="iii.viii.ix-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac007.htm#014.md)<span

<span id="iii.viii.ix-p2"></span>**14.** But I scattered them with a
whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was
desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they
laid the pleasant land desolate.

<span id="iii.viii.ix-p3"></span>**14.** Et affligar cum illis (*vertunt

transiens**,** nec revertens; et posuerunt terram desiderabilem in
vastitatem.

<span id="iii.viii.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.viii.ix-p5"></span><span id="iii.viii.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.ix-p6"></span>Here the Prophet concludes what he had
been speaking of God’s vengeance, by which he had fully proved, that the
sins of that nation had arrived to such a pitch, that there was no room
for pardon. Hence he says, that they had been *dispersed*; for so I
prefer to render the word, and the context seems to require this.
Interpreters vary as to its meaning; and, indeed, the Hebrews themselves
say, that this is a difficult passage, for, according to the rules of
grammar, the word can hardly be made suitable to the context. But let us
first see what the Prophet treats of; and secondly, what meaning, as the
word signifies various things, is the most suitable.

<span id="iii.viii.ix-p7"></span>The Prophet no doubt refers here to
God’s vengeance, as evidenced by the dispersion of the Jews among many
nations, not only when they were driven into exile, but also when
scattered in various parts of the world. The verb, taken transitively,
is by no means doubtful in its meaning, for <span
id="iii.viii.ix-p7.1"></span>סער, *sor*, means to move one from a place,
or to expel, and that by force, inasmuch as it is derived from
whirlwind. As it may therefore be here a transitive verb, I see no
reason why we should seek other meanings at variance with the design and
object of the Prophet. He then says, that the Jews had been *dispersed*
— how? *among all nations*, that is, through all parts of the world; and
then *among unknown nations*. Now we know, that the farther the exile,
the more severe it is, for neighbors for the most part are the most
humane; and when one is removed far to a barbarous nation, he would
rather a hundred times to die on his journey than to live at a great
distance from his country, and among a people of new and strange habits.
The meaning is, that the Jews had been severely visited by God, not only
because they had departed from his true worship and holy fear, but
because they had been perverse, had rejected all sound doctrine, and had
been deaf and indifferent to all admonitions. It was then for this
reason that they had been *dispersed among all nations*

<span id="iii.viii.ix-p8"></span>He afterwards adds, that *the land
after them became desolate* that no one passed through it. This
circumstance also, that God devoted the land to desolation, proved more
fully his wrath: for when God imprints marks of his vengeance on the
land, and on other harmless things, necessary for man’s support, it
becomes evident that he is not lightly displeased with men. He then
intimates, that God was not satisfied with the exile and dispersion of
that people, but that he intended that there should be also visible
marks of their wickedness in the sterility and desolation of the land
itself: and that land, we know, was very fruitful, both by nature and by
God’s blessing; for he had promised to give to the Israelites a land
flowing with milk and honey. When this fruitfulness was turned to
sterility, such a change ought to have roused the minds of all to
consider the dreadful judgment of God. We now then see why the Prophet
says, that *the land after them*, that is, after their departure,
*became desolate*; for they had polluted the land so far as to constrain
it, though innocent, to bear the judgment of God.

<span id="iii.viii.ix-p9"></span>And he says further, that *the
desirable land became a waste*, even through their fault. God was indeed
the author of that waste, but Zechariah imputes this calamity to the
people, because they had provoked God’s wrath, and procured this evil
for themselves; yea, they had involved the land itself as it were in the
same guilt, for it was cursed by God, though they had been driven hence
to another country. Desirable land was a name often given to Judea, not
only on account of its fruitfulness, and the abundance of its produce,
but because God had chosen it for himself: for though that land excelled
other lands in many respects, it is yet certain that its chief
excellency consisted in this, — that God honored it with peculiar favor.

<span id="iii.viii.ix-p10"></span>Zechariah then condemns the Jews, not
only because they had by their own fault extinguished the favor as to
the produce of the land, but because they had corrupted the land itself,
which had been so singularly favored as to have become the habitation of
God. And hence we more fully learn how great was the enormity of their
sins, which caused God to devote to desolation a land chosen by himself;
for, as we have said, it was no common honor for that land, in which God
designed to be worshipped by his chosen and holy people, to have been
destined by him to be made like Paradise. But when such an honor was
turned to shame and perpetual reproach, it was clearly a remarkable sign
of God’s wrath: and hence also becomes evident the impiety of that
people who, as it had been said, turned aside God’s favor from the land,
that not only it did not bring forth its usual produce, but that it also
became, as it were, a disgraceful spectacle, and filled all with horror
on seeing it so desolate, where was previously seen the temple and the
worship of God.

<span id="iii.viii.x"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.x-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="iii.viii.x-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast
adopted us for this end, that we may show brotherly kindness one towards
another, and labor for our mutual benefit, — O grant, that we may prove
by the whole tenor of our life, that we have not been called in vain by
thee, but that we may so live in harmony with each other, that integrity
and innocence may prevail among us; and may we so strive to benefit one
another, that thy name may be thus glorified by us; until having at
length finished our course, we reach the goal which thou hast set before
us, that having at last gone through all the evils of this life, we may
come to that blessed rest which has been prepared for us in heaven by
Christ our Lord. — Amen

<span id="fn_67"></span>[68](cc30010.htm#fr_67.md) <span
id="iii.viii.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p11"></span> *Grotius*, *Newcome*, and others
adopt this view; but *Blayney* justly says that \[<span
id="iii.viii.ii-p11.1"></span>בית-אל\] is nowhere used in Scripture for
the temple; and therefore he, in accordance with the *Septuagint* for
the temple; and therefore it as the name of the city so called, and
situated in the tribe of Benjamin. So *Drusius*, *Henderson*, and
others. Then the true version of the whole passage, and the most
literal, would be the following:—

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p12"></span> 

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p13"></span>**2.** When Bethel sent Sherezer and
Regem-melech and its men to entreat the face of Jehovah, *and* to speak
to the priests who were

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p14"></span>**3.** over the house of Jehovah of
hosts, and to the prophets, saying, “Shall I weep in the fifth month,
separating myself as I have done

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p15"></span>**4.** these so many years?” then came
the word of Jehovah of hosts to

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p16"></span>**5.** me, saying, “Speak to all the
people of the land, and to the priests, saying,”—

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p17"></span>“When ye fasted and mourned in the
fifth and in the seventh, even

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p18"></span>**6.** these seventy years, fasting
did ye fast to me, even to me? and when ye ate and when ye drank, were
not ye yourselves the eaters

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p19"></span>**7.** and ye yourselves the drinkers?
Were not these the words which Jehovah proclaimed by the former
Prophets, when Jehovah was inhabited and peacable, and her cities around
her, and *when* the south and the plain were inhabited?”

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p20"></span>“Bethel” here means the town; and
therefore “its,” and not “his men,” is the proper version; and instead
of “Shall I weep,” the most suitable rendering would be, “Shall we
weep.” That the inhabitants of Judea are intended, and not messengers
from Babylon, is quite evident from the fifth verse, “Speak to all the
people of the land.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_68"></span>[69](cc30010.htm#fr_68.md) <span
id="iii.viii.ii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p33"></span> Two years had elapsed since the
“visions” recorded in the former chapters. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_69"></span>[70](cc30010.htm#fr_69.md) <span
id="iii.viii.ii-p38.2"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.ii-p39"></span> The word means literally
“nazariting.” It was to do after the manner of the Nazarites, who
abstained from all delicacies, and from society. It appears to have been
abstinence as betokened grief and mourning; for so we find from the
answer, “when ye fasted and *mourned*,” etc. The *Targum’s* version is,
“When I restrained my soul from pleasures.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_70"></span>[71](cc30010.htm#fr_70.md) <span
id="iii.viii.v-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.v-p4"></span> Both *Newcome* and *Henderson* render
the verb \[<span id="iii.viii.v-p4.1"></span>אמר\] here in the past
tense — “Thus spake Jehovah of hosts;” and this seems right, as the
reference is made to what the Lord had spoken by the former Prophets, as
it appears from the 11th verse. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_71"></span>[72](cc30010.htm#fr_71.md) <span
id="iii.viii.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.v-p8"></span> Rendered “kindness and mercy” by
*Henderson*, but more correctly “mercy and compassion” by *Newcome*; or
they may be rendered “mercy and sympathies.” The meaning is, “Do acts of
mercy and of compassions,” or sympathies. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_72"></span>[73](cc30010.htm#fr_72.md) <span
id="iii.viii.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p7"></span> There is one sentence passed by
unnoticed, rendered thus by *Newcome*,—

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p8"></span>Neither imagine in your heart  
Every man evil againsthis brother.

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p9"></span>Verbatim it is—

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p10"></span>And the evil of (or, evil to) man, his
brother,  
Devise ye not in your heart.

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p11"></span>They were not to devise or contrive in
their hearts any evil or wrong to man, he being a brother. This sense is
given in the *Targum*, and by *Grotius*, *Henry*, and others; but
*Henderson*, following the *Septuagint*, gives another meaning; and his
version or rather paraphrase is —

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p12"></span>And think not in your heart of the
injury  
Which one hath done to another.

<span id="iii.viii.vi-p13"></span>But the original can hardly admit of
such a construction: the former, no doubt, is the true meaning. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_73"></span>[74](cc30010.htm#fr_73.md) <span
id="iii.viii.vii-p10.3"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p11"></span> 

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p12"></span>*And withdraw the shoulder,*—Newcome.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p13"></span>He adds, “The line occurs in <span
id="iii.viii.vii-p13.1"></span>[Ne
9:29](../../../bib/kjv/neh009.htm#029.md)<span
id="iii.viii.vii-p13.1"></span>. The metaphor is taken from beasts that
decline the yoke. See <span id="iii.viii.vii-p13.2"></span>[Ho
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.viii.vii-p13.2"></span>.”

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p14"></span>*And turned their back
rebelliously,*—Henderson

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p15"></span>He observes that “to turn the
shoulder is equivalent to turning the back upon any one. The cause of
such action is traced to a refractory, rebellious, and intractable
disposition.”

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p16"></span>Literally it is—

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p17"></span>And gave (or presented) the shoulder
of turning away.

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p18"></span>It is a metaphor taken, as some say,
from refractory children or servants, who being admonished, despise and
reject what is commanded them, as *Drusius* observes, by turning their
backs. This is the most suitable view according to the context.
Non-attendance to God’s word, and not insubordination, is the subject.
They refused to hear, turned their backs, and pretended deafness, or
conducted themselves as though they were deaf. Then the source of this
conduct is mentioned; the heart was made as hard as adamant, so that
they would not *hear* the law and the words sent by the Prophets. The
want of attention is throughout the subject; and the evident fact is
first referred to, in the various ways in which it displayed itself; and
then it is traced up to an adamantine heart. This is often the way in
which things are stated by the Prophets — the most palpable acts are
first stated, then the most hidden participles. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_74"></span>[75](cc30010.htm#fr_74.md) <span
id="iii.viii.vii-p21.3"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p22"></span> It occurs in this sense only here
and in the two places referred to. *Jerome* says that it is a stone
which breaks every metal, and can be broken by none; and that hence in
Greek it is rendered \[<span id="iii.viii.vii-p22.1"></span>αδαμας\],
which means unconquerable. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_75"></span>[76](cc30010.htm#fr_75.md) <span
id="iii.viii.vii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.vii-p25"></span> Literally it is, “By his Spirit, by
the hand of the former Prophets.” *Henderson* justly remarks, “The
double agency by which the divine will was communicated is
recognised—that of the inspiring Spirit and that of the instruments
inspired. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_76"></span>[77](cc30010.htm#fr_76.md) <span
id="iii.viii.viii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p9"></span> The verse may be thus literally
rendered —

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p10"></span> 

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p11"></span>**13.** And it was, as he had
called, and they heard not, So “call shall they do, and I will not
hear,” Said Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p12"></span>The Prophet relates what Jehovah had
said when the Jews refused to hear him. The verb \[<span
id="iii.viii.viii-p12.1"></span>אמר\] here, as in a former instance, is
to be rendered in the past tense. It is improperly rendered “saith” in
our version, and also by *Newcome* and *Henderson*. The past tense is
observed by *Marckius*. Then the beginning of the following verse is a
continuation of what Jehovah had said—

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p13"></span> 

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p14"></span>**14.** “And I will drive them as by
a whirlwind Among all the nations whom they know not;” And the land
became desolate after them, Without a passenger and without an
inhabitant; Yea, they made the land of delight a desolation.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p15"></span>The first two lines are literally
thus—

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p16"></span>“And I will whirlwind them  
Over all the nations whom they know not.”

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p17"></span>In the three last lines the Prophet
states what the effect had been.

<span id="iii.viii.viii-p18"></span>*Newcome* says, that \[<span
id="iii.viii.viii-p18.1"></span>ם\], “them,” after “know,” is redundant.
It is an instance of two pronouns, relative and personal, “whom they
knew them not.” It is the same in Welsh, “<span
id="iii.viii.viii-p18.2"></span>Y rhai nad adwaenant hwynt.” — *Ed.*
