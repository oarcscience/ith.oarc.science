<span id="iii.ii.ii-p2"></span>**1.** 1 In the eighth month, in the
second year of Darius, came the word of the Lord unto Zechariah, the son
of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p8"></span>**3.** Therefore say thou unto them, Thus

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p10"></span> 

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p11"></span><span id="iii.ii.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p12"></span>We here learn what we have already
stated, — that Haggai and Zechariah were by God joined together, that
they might confirm each other’s doctrine, for they had to do with a
refractory people: besides, the people had to endure hard and arduous
trials, so that they needed more than a common testimony to confirm
them. Haggai commenced the work of his office in the *sixth* month;
Zechariah shortly followed him, in the *eighth* month of the same year.
It has already been shown who was the Darius mentioned here; though some
interpreters dissent, we may yet learn from certain and indubitable
proofs, that he was the son of Hystaspes. We shall again speak of this
Darius, when a better occasion will offer itself: I wished only in
passing to say thus much.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p13"></span>*The word of Jehovah came to Zechariah*.
We have already said that the word of God comes in two ways to men. God
addresses all from the least to the greatest; but in the first place he
sends his word especially to his Prophets, to whom he commits the office
of teaching. The word of God thus comes to private individuals, and it
comes also to teachers, who sustain a public character, and become God’s
interpreters or messengers. It was thus that God’s word came to
Zechariah, not that he might keep to himself what God had said, but that
he might be a faithful dispenser of his truth.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p14"></span>With regard to Zechariah, they are
mistaken who regard him as the son of Jehoiadah, they are mistaken by
Christ in <span id="iii.ii.ii-p14.1"></span>[Mt
23:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#035.md)<span
id="iii.ii.ii-p14.1"></span>. Zechariah is indeed said there to have
been killed between the temple and the altar, and he is called the son
of Barachiah:  <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) but the counting of
years will easily prove their mistake, who would have him to be the same
Zechariah. The former, who is called in sacred history the son of
Jehoiadah the priest, was slain under Joash. Let us now see how many
kings succeeded him, and also how many years he reigned. That Zechariah
must have been almost two hundred years old at the Babylonian exile, if
he was alive, had be been a boy when he was stoned. Now this Zechariah,
of whom we now speak, performed the office of a Prophet after the return
of the people from exile. He must then have been not only more than a
hundred and fifty years of age, but must have exceeded two hundred years
when he died. The idea respecting the renascence of men, being a reverie
of the Jews, is not worthy of a record, much less of a refutation. He is
however called the son of Barachiah; but the probable conjecture is that
Jehoiadah the priest had two names, and it does not appear that he was a
prophet. However this may be, the Zechariah who was stoned in the temple
by the order of the king, was the son of the high priest, and died more
than a hundred years before the Babylonian exile. For we have said that
this Darius was not the Mede who reigned with Cyrus, but the son of
Hystaspes, who reigned a long time after, that is, after Cambyses and
the Magi. Their want of knowledge is easily proved, who think that these
Prophets were sent by God before the completion of the time mentioned by
Jeremiah. As then the seventy years had elapsed, this Prophet was no
doubt born after the time when the city was destroyed, the temple
pulled-down, and the people led captive into Babylon. I come now to the
doctrine itself.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p16"></span><span id="iii.ii.ii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p17"></span>*Angry was Jehovah with anger against
your fathers*  <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) The Prophet here
refers to the severity of the punishment with which the Jews had been
visited, in order that posterity might know that God, who so rigidly
punishes the despisers of his word and instruction, ought not to be
provoked. For by saying that God was angry with anger, he means, that
God was in no common measure offended with the Jews, and that the very
grievousness of their punishment was a clear evidence how displeased God
was with them. But the object of the Prophet was to rouse the Jews, that
they might begin seriously to fear God on seeing how dreadful is his
wrath. The Apostle states it as a general truth, that it is a dreadful
thing to fall into the hands of the living God, (<span
id="iii.ii.ii-p20.1"></span>[Heb
10:30](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.ii.ii-p20.1"></span>:) so also the Scripture speaks everywhere.
But Zechariah mentions here to his own people a signal evidence of God’s
wrath, which ought to justly to have smitten all of them with terror. He
does not then speak here of a thing unknown, but reminds them seriously
to consider how terrible is God’s vengeance; as a proof of this, their
fathers had been deprived of their perpetual inheritance, they had
suffered many degradations, and had also been harassed and oppressed by
tyrants; in short, they had been nearly sunk in the lowest depths. Since
then God has so severely dealt with their fathers, the Prophet bids them
to know that God ought to be feared, lest they should grow wanton or
indulge themselves in their usual manner, but that they might from the
heart repent, and not designedly provoke God’s wrath, of which their
fathers had so severe an experience.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p21"></span><span id="iii.ii.ii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p22"></span>It then follows, *Thou shalt say to
them, Return ye to me, and I will return to you*  <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) The Prophet now expresses more clearly
for what purpose he had spoken of God’s vengeance, with which he had
visited his chosen people, even that their posterity might take heed to
themselves; for the common proverb, “Fools by adversity become wise,”
ought in this case to have been verified. For where there is really a
teachable spirit, men become instantly attentive to what God says: but
even when they are sluggish and slothful, it is a wonder, that when they
are smitten, the strokes which they feel do not shake off at least in
some degree their torpor. Hence the Prophet, after having spoken of the
punishments which God had inflicted, exhorts the Jews to repentance.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p24"></span>It ought however to be observed, that
our Prophet not only speaks of repentance, but shows also its true
character, that the Jews might not seek carelessly to please God, as is
commonly the case, but that they might sincerely repent; for he says,
*return ye to me, and I will return to you*. And this was not said
without reason, when we consider in what sort of delusions the Jews
indulged themselves immediately after their return. We have seen that
they became devoted to their private concerns, while the temple remained
desolate; and we also know what sacred history relates, that they
married heathen women, and also that many corruptions prevailed among
them, so that religion almost disappeared. They indeed retained the name
of God, but their impiety showed itself by clear signs. It is then no
wonder that the Prophet sharply stimulates them to repentance.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p25"></span>It must at the same time be noticed,
that we cannot enjoy the favor of God, even when he kindly offers to be
reconciled to us, except we from the heart repent. However graciously,
then, God may invite us to himself, and be ready to remit our sins, we
yet cannot embrace his offered favor, except our sins become hateful to
us; for God ceases not to be our judge, except we anticipate him, and
condemn ourselves, and deprecate the punishment of our sins. Hence we
then pacify God when real grief wounds us, and we thus really turn to
God, without dissimulation or falsehood. Now the experience of God’s
wrath ought to lead us to this; for extremely heedless are they who,
having found God to be a Judge, do carelessly disregard his wrath, which
ought to have filled their hearts with fear. “Let no one deceive you
with vain words,” says Paul, “for on account of these things comes the
wrath of God on the children of unbelief,” or on all the unbelieving.
(<span id="iii.ii.ii-p25.1"></span>[Eph
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.ii.ii-p25.1"></span>.) Paul bids us to consider all the
evidences which God gives of his wrath in the world, that they may
instruct us as to the fear of God; how much more then should domestic
examples be noticed by us? For the Prophet speaks not here of foreign
nations; but says, *angry has God been with anger against your fathers*.
Since, then, it appeared evident that God had not spared even his chosen
people, they ought, unless they were in the extreme refractory, to have
carefully continued in obedience to the law. Hence the Prophet here
condemns their tardiness, inasmuch as they had made so little progress
under the chastisements of God.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p26"></span>We thus see that no excuse can be
brought before God, if we do not make a right use of all the punishments
by which he designs to recover us from our sins. We have referred to
that general truth announced by Paul, that God’s judgment, executed on
the unbelieving, ought to be feared; it hence follows that our
insensibility is extreme, if we are not thoroughly moved when God
teaches us by our own experience, or at least when he sets domestic
examples before us, as when he punishes our fathers and others connected
with us; for this mode of teaching comes much nearer to us.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p27"></span>But when the Prophet says, *return ye to
me, and I will return to you*, he means, as I have before stated, that
though God meets sinners, and is ready with extended arms to embrace
them, his favor cannot come to those to whom it is offered, except a
real feeling of penitence leads them to God. In short, the Prophet
means, that though they had returned from exile, they could not expect a
permanent state of safety, except they turned from the heart to him; for
if they imitated their fathers, God had in readiness far severer
scourges to chastise them; and they might also be again driven into
exile. he then briefly reminds them, that if they wished to enjoy the
incomparable kindness with which God had favored them, it was necessary
for them seriously to return to him. Though, then God had already in
part returned to them, that is, he had really proved that he was
pacified and propitious to them, yet he had begun by many evidences to
show that he was again offended with them; for their fruit had either
withered through heat, or had been smitten by hail, as we have found
elsewhere; (<span id="iii.ii.ii-p27.1"></span>[Hag
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.ii.ii-p27.1"></span>;) so that they had already labored for
several years under want and other evils. God then had not so blessed
them, that they could in every way recognize his paternal favor. This is
the reason why the Prophet says, *I will return to you* when ye return
to me.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p28"></span>We now perceive the meaning of the
Prophet to be, that though God had delivered his people, they ought yet
to have feared lest his wrath should suddenly burn against the
ungrateful and the wicked, and that being not in full favor, they ought
also to have known that God was still offended with them. So the Prophet
shortly reminded them, that it was no wonder that God treated them with
no great kindness, for they allowed no place for his favor, but provoked
his wrath, like their fathers, inasmuch as they did not from the hear
repent.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p29"></span>The Papists allege this passage in
defense of free-will; but it is a most puerile sophistry. They say that
the turning of God to men is the same as their turning to him, as though
God promised the grace of his Spirit as a help, when men anticipate him.
They imagine then that free-will precedes, and then that the help of the
Spirit follows. But this is very gross and absurd. The Prophet indeed
means that God would return to the Jews; for he shows that God would in
every respect be a father to them, when they showed themselves to be
dutiful and respectful children. We must therefore remember that God
does not here promise the aid of his Spirit to assist free-will, and to
help the efforts of man, as these foolish and senseless teachers
imagine, but that he promises to return to the Jews to bless them. Hence
the return of God here is nothing else than the prosperity which they
desired; as though he had said — “Fear me from the heart, and ye shall
not labor under hunger and thirst; for I shall satisfy you, as neither
your fields nor your vines shall hereafter disappoint your hopes. Ye
shall find me most bountiful, when ye deal with me in a faithful
manner.” This is the meaning.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p30"></span>We must further bear in mind, that,
according to the common usage of Scripture, whenever God exhorts us to
repentance, he does not regard what our capacity is, but demands what is
justly his right. Hence the Papists adopt what is absurd when they
deduce the power of free-will from the command or exhortation to repent:
God, they say, would not have commanded what is not in our power to do.
It is a foolish and most puerile mode of reasoning; for if everything
which God requires were in our power, the grace of the Holy Spirit would
be superfluous; it would not only be as they say a waiting-mind, but it
would be wholly unnecessary; but if men need the aid of the Spirit, it
follows that they cannot do what God requires of them. But it seems
strange that God should bid men to do more than what they can. It seems
so indeed, I allow, when we form our judgment according to the common
perception of the flesh; but when we understand these truths — that the
law works wrath — that it increases sin — that it was given that
transgression might be made more evident, then the false notion — that
God requires nothing but what men can perform, comes to nothing. But it
is enough for us to know, that God in exhorting us to repentance
requires nothing but what nature dictates ought to be done by us. Since
it is so, however short we are in the performance, it is not right to
charge God with too much strictness, that he demands what is beyond our
power.

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p31"></span>The frequent repetition of God’s name by
the Prophet is emphatical; it was done, that what he taught might more
sharply goad the hearts of the people. Had he simply said, that he had a
commission from above to remind the people of the punishments which
their fathers had endured, and also to call them to repentance, this
mode of teaching would not have so penetrated into their hearts, as when
the name of God is so often brought before them — *Thou* *shalt say*,
*Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Return to me, saith* *Jehovah of hosts,
and I will return to you, saith Jehovah of hosts*. It surely behoved the
Jews, when they heard God’s name pronounced three times, to awake and to
consider with whom they had to do. For what can be more base or more
disgraceful than for men, when God anticipates them and desires to be
united to them, to refuse to respond and to devote themselves to his
service?

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p32"></span>It is at the same time evident, that the
Prophet adopted a mode of speaking then in use: and we know that the
language of the Jews underwent a change after their Babylonian exile. It
lost that clearness and elegance which it possessed before: as it
clearly appears from the style of those who wrote after the exile. I
allow also that previously the Prophets exhibited not the same degree of
eloquence; for Isaiah differs greatly from Jeremiah and from Amos. It is
yet quite evident from the writings of the last Prophets, that the
language had become somewhat muddy after the return of the people from
exile. Let us now proceed —

<span id="iii.ii.iii"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#004.md)<span id="iii.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p2"></span>**4.** Be ye not as your fathers, unto
whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the Lord of
hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and *from* your evil doings: but
they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the Lord

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p3"></span>**4.** Ne sitis sicut patres vestri**,**
quia clamarunt ad eos Prophetae superiores**,** sic dicit Iehovah
exercituum**,** Revertimini quaeso a viis vestris malis**,** et ab
operibus vestris malis; et mom audierunt**,** neque attenderunt ad
me**,** dicit Iehovah.

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p5"></span><span id="iii.ii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p6"></span>In order to correct and to subdue the
obstinacy of the people, he here upbraids them with having descended
from wicked and perverse parents. The Jews, we know, too much flattered
themselves; and we know that they were especially inflated with the vain
boasting that they derived their origin from the holy fathers. But the
Prophets had something else in view. We indeed know that when anything
becomes customary, almost all become hardened and flatter themselves in
their vice; for immorality is then counted almost as the law, and what
is sanctioned by public consent seems lawful. Since then they had not
ceased for many years to provoke the wrath of God, it was necessary to
add this reproof, *Be not like your fathers*: for they no doubt imagined
that God approved of them, as they were not worse than their fathers.
But God shows that their fathers had been very wicked and perverse.

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p7"></span>Let us learn from this passage, that the
examples which are wont to be set up as a shield are so far from being
of any weight before God, that they enhance our guilt: and yet we see
that this folly infatuates many; for at this day the religion of the
Papists seems to them holy and irreprehensible, because it has been
handed down to them by their fathers. Hence, whenever they bring forward
the fathers, they think it a sufficient defense against the charge of
any errors. But nothing occurs more frequently in the Prophets than the
truth, that examples tend more to kindle the wrath of God, when some men
become the occasion of sin to others, and when posterity think that
whatever has proceeded from their fathers is lawful.

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p8"></span>But we must at the same time bear in
mind the design of the Prophet, for he did not intend simply to show,
that the Jews in vain alleged the examples of the ancient; but, as I
have said, he intended to shake off their self-flatteries by which they
lulled themselves asleep; and he intended especially to put down those
evil practices, which by long use had prevailed among them. This then is
the reason why he says, *Be not like your fathers*. The Spirit employs
the same sentiment in many other places, especially in the ninety- fifth
Psalm (<span id="iii.ii.iii-p8.1"></span>[Ps
95:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.ii.iii-p8.1"></span>), and also in other Psalms.

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p9"></span>Then he says, that the *Prophets*, who
had been sent by God, had cried to their fathers, but that they did not
attend. As then contempt of the truth had for so many ages prevailed
among the Jews, and as this impiety was not duly abhorred by them, since
they thought themselves to be as it were in perpetual possession — these
are the reasons why the Prophet expressly upbraids them with this, that
God’s word had been formerly despised by their nation — *cry* then *did
the former Prophets*. He also exaggerates again their crime and their
sin, because God had often recalled them to himself but without success.
Had the Prophets been silent, and had God applied no remedy for their
defection, their ingratitude would not indeed have been excusable; but
since Prophets had often been sent to them, in succession, one after the
other, and each had endeavored to restore the wretched men to a state of
safety, not to attend to their holy and serious admonitions, by which
God manifested his care for their well-being, was a much more atrocious
crime.

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p10"></span>We hence learn, that when we find any
people prone to this or that vice, it ought to be resisted with greater
diligence; for Satan almost always employs this artifice — that when he
finds us prone to this or that vice, he directs all his efforts to drive
us headlong into it.

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p11"></span>As then the Prophets had been for a
long time despised by the Jews, Zechariah designedly brings before them
that perverseness which had been too long known. *cry* then *did* the
*former Prophets*,  <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) saying *Thus
saith Jehovah of hosts, return ye, I pray, from your evil ways, and from
your evil works; but they heard not nor attended*. After having spoken
of God’s kind invitation, which was a singular pledge of his love, since
he thus manifested his concern for their safety, he shows on the other
hand how unworthily the Jews had conducted themselves, for they
obstinately rejected this favor of God. They were indeed more than
sufficiently proved guilty; for by saying, *Return ye, I pray, from your
evil ways and from your evil works*, he assumes it as a fact that the
reproofs given were just. And he farther says, that they refused to
hear. Hence their perverseness was less endurable; for though they were
self-condemned, they did not yet repent, nor deigned to hearken to God.
And he subjoins the words, *nor did they attend*; for by this repetition
 <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) is more fully expressed, not only
their stupidity, but their strange madness, inasmuch as they had so
rejected God, and closed up the door of his favor, as though they sought
designedly to drive him far from them, lest he should come to them.

<span id="iii.ii.iv"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iv-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="iii.ii.iv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast
not only once embraced us in thy paternal bosom, when it pleased thee to
offer to us the salvation obtained by the death of thine only-begotten
Son, but continuest also daily to invite us to thyself, and also to
recall the wandering to the right way — O grant, that we may not always
remain deaf and hardened against thy warnings, but bring to thee hearts
really submissive, and study so to devote ourselves to thee, that it may
be evident that we have not received thy grace in vain; and may we also
continue in the constant fruition of it, until we shall at length fully
attain that blessed glory, which having been obtained for us, id daily
set before us by the teaching of the Gospel, that we may be confirmed in
it. May we therefore make such continual advances, through the whole
course of our life, that having at last put off all the corruptions of
our flesh, we may be really united to thee in that perfect purity to
which thou invitests us, and which we hope for, through the grace of
thine only Son. — Amen.

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p6"></span> 

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p7"></span><span id="iii.ii.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p8"></span>In what we considered yesterday Zechariah
reminded the Jews of the conduct of their fathers, in order that they
might not, by their continued sins, bring on themselves new punishments.
Many interpreters think that the sentiment contained at the beginning of
the fourth verse is now confirmed, *your fathers, where are they?* for
it seems t them that God is here exulting over the Jews — “Think now
what has happened to your fathers; are they not all gone and destroyed?”
They suppose also that the Jews answer, taking the latter clause as
spoken by them, “The Prophets also, have they not perished? Why do you
mention to us the fathers? There is no difference between them and the
Prophets; it is not therefore a suitable argument.” And then in the
third place, they consider that God refutes the answer given by the
Jews, “But my word and my statutes, what I had entrusted to the
Prophets, have not been without their effect.” This view of the passage
has been adopted by many, and by all of the most ancient interpreters;
and those who followed them have been disposed to subscribe to it.
 <span id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) But more probable is the opinion
of Jerome, who understands the latter clause of false Prophets, — “Your
fathers and your Prophets, where are they?” as though God thus reproved
the Jews: “See now, have not your fathers miserably perished, and also
the Prophets by whom they were deceived?” Thus Jerome thinks that the
object in both clauses is to shake off the delusions of the Jews, that
they might not harden themselves against God’s judgments, or give ear to
flatterers. This interpretation comes nearer to the design of the
Prophet, though he seems to me to have something else in view.

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p10"></span>I join the two clauses together, as they
may be most fitly united — “Your fathers and my Prophets have both
perished; but after their death, the memory of the doctrine, which has
not only been published by my servants, but has also been fully
confirmed, is to continue, so that it ought justly to terrify you; for
it is very foolish in you to enquire whether or not the Prophets are
still alive; they performed their office to the end of life, but the
truth they declared is immortal. Though then the Prophets are dead, they
have not yet carried away with them what they taught, for it never
perishes, nor can it at any age be extinguished. The ungodly are also
dead, but their death ought not to obliterate the memory of God’s
judgments; but after their death these judgments ought to be known among
men, and serve to teach them, in order that posterity may understand
that they are not presumptuously to provoke God.” This seems to be the
real meaning of the Prophet.

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p11"></span>By saying, *Your fathers where are they?
and the Prophets do they live for ever?* he makes a concession, as
though he had said, “I allow that both your fathers and my Prophets are
dead; but my words are they dead?” God, in a word, distinguishes between
the character of his word and the condition of men, as though he had
said, that the life of men is frail and limited to a few years, but that
his truth never perishes. And rightly does he mention the ungodly as
well as the Prophets; for we know that whenever God punishes the
despisers of his word, he gives perpetual examples, which may keep men
in all ages within the boundaries of duty. Hence, though many ages have
passed away since God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, yet that example
remains, and retains its use to this day; for the ruin of Sodom is a
mirror in which we may see at this time that God is the perpetual judge
of the world. Since then the ungodly have perished, the punishment with
which God visited their sins ought not to be buried with them, but to be
ever remembered by men. This is the reason why he says, “your fathers
are dead: this you must admit; but as they had been severely chastised,
ought ye not at this day to profit by such examples?” Then he says, “my
Prophets also are dead; but it was my will that they should be the
preachers of my truth, and for this end, that after their death
posterity might know that I had once spoken through them.” To the same
purpose are the words of Peter, who says, that he labored that the
memory of what he taught might continue after he was removed from his
tabernacle.

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p12"></span>“As then,” he says, “the time of my
dissolution is at hand, I endeavor as far as I can, that you may
remember what I teach after my death.” (<span
id="iii.ii.vi-p12.1"></span>[2Pe
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.ii.vi-p12.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p13"></span>We now perceive the object of the
Prophet.

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p14"></span><span id="iii.ii.vi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p15"></span>He then immediately adds, *But my words
and my statutes*  <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) *which I have
committed to my Prophets, have they not laid hold on your fathers?* We
have seen that he made a concession in the last verse; but here God
expressly declares what I have stated — that though men vanish, or are
hence removed after a short time, yet heavenly truth is ever firm, and
retains its own power. But the Prophet uses another form of expression,
*My words*, he says, *which I have committed to my servants, the
Prophets, have they not laid on*  <span id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md)
*your father?* that is, “ought the remembrance of the punishment, by
which I intended to teach you, and your children, and your
grandchildren, that ye might not provoke my wrath as your fathers did,
to be lost by you? Since the ye see the effect of my doctrine in your
fathers, why do ye not consider, that as I am always the same, my words
cannot possibly be in vain at the present day, or be without effect?” We
now see how clearly the Prophet distinguishes between the word of God
and the condition of men; for God does not declare what is empty, nor
give utterance to words which produce no effect; but he executes
whatever he has committed to his Prophets.

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p18"></span>He then adds, *They returned and said,*
 <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) *As Jehovah of hosts had purposed
to do to us on account of our ways and our works, so he hath done*.
Added here is a confession, which ought to have perpetually stimulated
the Jews, while they saw that the obstinacy of their fathers had been
subdued by the scourges of God. It is indeed true, that though they been
sharply chastised, many of them did not yet really repent. God however
extorted from them the confession that they were justly punished. Even
the ungodly then had been constrained to give glory to God, and to
confess that they were justly treated as guilty; but their children
became immediately forgetful — was this a stupidity capable of being
excused? He at the same time indirectly warns posterity that they might
not imitate the negligence of their fathers, who would not have repented
had they not been severely chastised; but that they might, on the
contrary anticipate the judgment of God. We then see why the Prophet
mentions that the Jews, who had been severely treated, freely confessed
that they had been chastised by the hand of God; but we must notice the
words.

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p20"></span>He says, that the fathers had
*returned*. Though their repentance was not sincere, yet God intimates
that such was their punishment that it drew from them the confession
that is here mentioned. What then could their posterity mean? or how
could they become so audaciously mad against God, when they saw that
their fathers and their obstinacy had been, as it were, broken down by
the severe strokes by which God had smitten them? He then subjoins, *and
said*, *As Jehovah hath prepared to do*. They confessed that they
suffered evils not through chance, but that the purpose of God was thus
fulfilled, which they had previously despised and almost derided. They
further confessed, that they justly suffered; and they referred to their
works and to their course of life. Since, then, the father had made this
confession, who had hardened themselves long in their sins, their
posterity were wholly without excuse in going on still to their own
ruin, in containing impenitent, though warned by examples so memorable.
This is the import of the passage. It now follows —

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p2"></span>**7.** Upon the four and twentieth day
of the eleventh month, which *is* the month Sebat, in the second year of

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p12"></span> 

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p13"></span><span id="iii.ii.vii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p14"></span>Here is related a second prophecy,
connected with a vision. At the beginning God alone spoke and gave
commission to his Prophet to reprove the Jews: he now confirms the
prediction as to the reduction of the city; for to the word is added a
vision, which is, as we have seen elsewhere, a sort of seal. As the
vision is obscure it may be variously explained, but I shall endeavor to
accommodate it, without any refinements, to our use; and so no ambiguity
will remain, provided we seek to be soberly and moderately wise, that
is, provided we aim at no more than what edification requires.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p15"></span><span id="iii.ii.vii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p16"></span>The Prophet says, that a vision was
given him; and he saw a horseman among the myrtles sitting on a red
horse; and with him there were horses red, variegated  <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) and white, and having no doubt riders. So
I understand the passage; for extremely gross is the idea that the
horses spoke. There were then, as it were, a troop of horsemen; but the
Prophet says, that one appeared as the chief leader, who was accompanied
by others. In the meantime an angel stood at the side of the Prophet,
who led him, and showed to him his concern for the holy city and the
chosen people. He then adds, that these horsemen had returned from an
expedition; for they had been sent to review the whole world and its
different parts. He therefore says, that they had returned from their
journey, and also that the whole earth was quiet, that men enjoyed peace
and tranquillity everywhere. At length he adds, that the angel of God
cried out, *How long, Jehovah, wilt thou not show mercy to Jerusalem?*
For the angel, touched with grief on hearing that all the heathens were
enjoying rest, expostulates with God; for it seemed a very unbecoming
and strange thing that the faithful alone should be oppressed with
adversities, while others lived in peace and enjoyed their pleasures.
There follows at length an answer from God, as we shall presently see.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p19"></span>But let us now enquire the Prophet’s
design. I regard this as the object — that horsemen were presented to
the Prophet, that he might know that God does not remain shut up in
heaven and neglect the affairs of men; but that he has, as it were,
swift horses, so that he knows what things are everywhere carried on. As
then kings having horses at command, send their riders here and there,
and bid them soon to return to them that they may know what to do; so
the Prophet ascribes here to God the character of a chief sovereign, who
inquires respecting all the affairs of men. It is indeed certain, that
God receives no information from angels, for nothing is hid from him:
nay, all things were fully known to him before he created angels. God,
therefore, needs no such helps in order to know what is going on from
the rising to the setting sun; but such a mode of speaking often occurs
in scripture; and it is a common thing, that God assumes the character
of man in order that he may more familiarly instruct us. Let us then
especially bear in mind, that the riders who appeared to the Prophet
were angels, who are ever ready to serve God. And they were sent here
and there, not that they might declare to God any thing unknown to him,
but that we may believe that God cares for human affairs; and that
though angels appear not to us they are always engaged, and survey the
world, so that nothing is done without the knowledge and will of God.
This is one thing.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p20"></span>The Prophet says also, that the vision
was given him in the *night*: he refers no doubt to what actually took
place, and also to the manner in which he was taught; for though the
vision was not given in vain, yet God meant that it should not be plain,
in order that he might give by little and little a glimpse of hope to
the Jews. As then God did not intend to exhibit in full light what he
afterwards in due time taught them, the vision appeared in the night.
And to the same purpose is what he says respecting the angels, that they
were in a *dark* or *deep place*, and that they were among the myrtles.
For to consider what is here said allegorically seems to me frivolous. I
will, therefore, not refinedly discuss here the nature of myrtles: but
as we know that the trees are dark and afford a thick shade, God
intended, I have no doubt, by the sight of them, to produce an effect on
the Prophet’s mind, so that he might understand that the prophecy was
yet obscure, and that the time for a plain and clear revelation was not
come. There were then horsemen among the myrtles, that is, under these
dark and shady trees; and also in a deep place and in a thick shade. We
see how aptly these things correspond. Some think that by their colors
is designated the state of the people, being that of sorrow and of joy;
for though quietness in part was restored to the people, yet much
darkness remained and much perplexity in their affairs: but as this idea
is probable, I do not reject it, provided we retain what I have stated,
that the obscurity of the Prophecy is noted by the deep valley and the
myrtles.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p21"></span>There was one more eminent than the
rest, and in this there is nothing unusual; for when God sends forth a
company of angels, he gives the lead to some one: and this is the reason
why one is described here as more illustrious than all the others. If we
regard this angel to be Christ, the idea is consistent with the common
usage of Scripture; for Christ, we know, being the head of angels, ever
exercises such dominion over them, that in obeying God they do nothing
but under his authority. It may be then that one angel assumed here a
pre-eminence over the rest, that the Prophet might think of the
Redeemer, who exercises power over angels and the whole Church.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p22"></span>With regard to the different colors the
Prophet no doubt understood that they designated the offices allotted to
angels, as some convey God’s benefits, and others come armed with
scourges and swords. For what was the design of the vision in which some
riders appeared on white horses, some on red, and some on bay, (or, on
those of a mixed color, which is more probable,) except that God
intended to show that he sent angels, not only that they might survey
the state of things, but that they might also come to chastise men, or
to be ministers of his benefits? Besides, it was God’s purpose, as I
have already hinted, to make it known, that nothing is carried on in
this world but what is known by angels, who are his emissaries and
agents.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p23"></span><span id="iii.ii.vii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p24"></span>They said that *the whole earth was
then quiet*,  <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) that is, the
countries bordering on Judea, or the oriental regions. Hence a greater
confidence might be entertained by the Jews, for with the prayer of the
angel is connected a complaint — “God of hosts, what is thy purpose?”
that is, “Is it thy will that all others should enjoy quietness and
peace, while enemies are continually hostile and troublesome to thy
people? Is it right that thy Church should be ever miserably distressed,
while heathens, who have no care for religion, should be so bountifully
favored by thee? Is it not better that the memory of thy name should be
extinguished, and that all worship should fall to the ground, than that
so unjust a reward should be returned to thy servants?” We now see the
design of the vision, even that the Jews might be assured that the
distresses which they endured would not be perpetual. How so? because
God slept not in heaven, but had his runners; and further, since his
will was that all nations should be tranquil, he would no doubt have at
length a regard for his own people, so as to deliver them from their
troubles.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p26"></span>Though then the vision is obscure, yet
its design is not doubtful. Besides, if we are content with what is
moderate, there will be found here nothing so perplexing but that we may
easily learn at least the import of the Prophecy. But the curiosity of
those interpreters has done much harm, who by examining every single
syllable have advanced many puerile things. There is therefore nothing
better than to attend to the design of the Prophet, and then to regard
the circumstances of the time, and thirdly, to follow the analogy
between the signs and things signified.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p27"></span>I have said that angels are here
introduced, because it would be difficult for us to ascend to the
highest glory of God. God, we know, is not constrained by necessity to
employ angels as ministers to execute his judgments, to punish men, or
to confer benefits: for God himself is sufficient for all these things.
Why then does he employ angels and make use of their ministration, if it
be superfluous? The obvious answer is this — as we are prone to
unbelief, we ever tremble in dangers, except we know that God is
prepared with many forces to help us in time of need. When it is said in
<span id="iii.ii.vii-p27.1"></span>[Psalm
24](../../../bib/kjv/psa024.htm#000.md)<span id="iii.ii.vii-p27.1"></span>
that angels encamp around those who fear God, is it not a much more
effectual relief than if it had been simply said that God is our
citadel? It is indeed said in many places that God is an unassailable
fortress; but as many still continue to doubt when they hear that there
is a sufficient defense for them in God, he consults now their weakness,
and adds, “I come with a great host; I am not alone your helper, but
there is a great army ready at my bidding. Whenever then it may please
me a troop of angels, yea, many myriads shall assemble together.” When
therefore God thus speaks, it is a mode of teaching suitable to the
capacities of men. So now, when Zechariah sees many runners, who have
been sent by God to perambulate and to survey the earth, it may with
greater certainty be learnt that nothing is carried on without design or
by chance in the world, but that all things come before God, and that
the manner in which all things occur is set forth by the angels. In the
same way is the representation given in the first chapter of Job (<span
id="iii.ii.vii-p27.2"></span>[Job
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.ii.vii-p27.2"></span>) All the sons of God, that is, angels,
came before his throne; and also among them Satan came; for though he
does not willingly obey God, yet while he perambulates the earth, he at
the same time executes God’s judgments, though unwillingly. We now then
see the reason why God did not himself appear, and testified to the
Prophet, that whatever took place among the nations was known to him;
but he shows that his runners rode swiftly through the whole earth, and
returned afterwards to the heavenly tribunal, and proved that they had
carefully performed their office.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p28"></span>Now the Prophet says, that he had this
vision in the *eleventh month, called Sebat,*  <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) *and on the twenty-fourth day* of the
month; that is, in the third month after his first Prophecy. He had in
the eighth month sharply reproved the Jews: now a consolation is added,
lest they should despair, but know that they were still the objects of
God’s care. And possibly the reproof referred to had been effectual;
nay, it is probable, that the Prophet did not labor in vain in exhorting
the Jews to true and sincere repentance. When therefore they had given
some evidence of religion, we see that God afterwards treated them more
kindly, and set before them the hope of a future deliverance.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p30"></span>With regard to the night time, it is of
importance to observe, that though God does not always set forth with
full clearness his predictions, they are not yet without instruction,
provided we be attentive, and provided also we suffer ourselves, while
in darkness, to be ruled by the spirit of knowledge. By whatever
different means then God may teach his faithful people, he always
teaches them something useful, provided they murmur not when any thing
is for a time obscure, but wait for the day of full revelation. And this
is the design of Paul’s admonition, “If ye think otherwise, this also
will God reveal to you.” Let us then know that God’s manner of teaching
is not always the same, but that his teaching is always profitable,
provided the faithful retain due moderation and sobriety, and suffer
themselves to be guided step by step by God. This observation is to be
applied to the whole verse, when it is said, that the horses and the
horsemen stood under the myrtles, and also in a low place.

<span id="iii.ii.vii-p31"></span>And, then, as to the various colors of
the horses, it ought not to be deemed strange, that God should thus
allot different offices to angels; for he does not always punish us by
the ministry of Satan. He has celestial angels, when it pleases him, as
executioners of his vengeance; and he sometimes employs devils for this
purpose. However this may be, it is in his power to delegate angels as
ministers of his kindness, or to send them to execute his vengeance, so
that they appear in red color, or in some other. In conclusion, it ought
also to be borne in mind, that angels do stand before the tribunal of
God, after having diligently perambulated the earth, not after the
manner of men: for it would be gross and puerile to imagine angels
sitting on horses, inasmuch as they are spirits who are confined to no
certain place; but as we cannot understand, according to our capacities,
the celestial mysteries of God, it is necessary that such
representations should be set before our eyes. however this may be, it
ought to remain a fixed principle, that angels are always employed, for
they survey the earth, that nothing may be done or carried on without
design; and they are also sent with power and authority, so that they
are, as it were, the hand of God: and at one time they execute his
judgments, inflict punishments, as it has been said; and at another they
come with blessings from God. This then is the meaning as to the
horsemen. I cannot proceed farther: the rest I shall defer.

<span id="iii.ii.viii"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.viii-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="iii.ii.viii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since we live
here as in thick darkness, and are also surrounded with so much darkness
of ignorance, that we often entertain doubts as to thy providence, and
think ourselves forsaken by thee whenever thou dost not immediately
succor us, — O grant, that with our minds raised above, we may
contemplate those things which thou hast once revealed to thy servant
Zechariah, and not doubt, but thou lookest on us also and commandest thy
angels to take care of us, and to raise us up in their hands, and to
guide us in all our ways, yea, in all the crooked windings of this life,
so that we may learn to commit ourselves to be wholly ruled by thee, and
thus suffer ourselves to be drawn and turned here and there in the
world, so as still to follow the way which thou hast pointed out to us,
and to proceed straight towards the mark which thou hast been pleased to
set before us, until we shall at length be gathered into that eternal
rest, which has been obtained for us by the blood of thine only-begotten
Son. — Amen.

<span id="iii.ii.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.ii.x-p5"></span><span id="iii.ii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.x-p6"></span>The Prophet now shows that the angel who
was his guide and teacher, became even a suppliant before God in behalf
of the welfare of the Church. Hence the probable opinion is, that this
angel was Christ the Mediator. For they who say that it was the Holy
Spirit, who forms prayers in our hearts, seem to depart very far from
the meaning of the Prophet: and it is nothing new, that Christ should
exercise care over his Church. But if this view be disapproved, we may
take any one of the angels to be meant. It is certain that it is
enjoined them all to minister to the salvation of the faithful,
according to what the Apostle says in the first chapter of the Hebrews
<span id="iii.ii.x-p6.1"></span>[Heb
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.ii.x-p6.1"></span>;
and indeed the whole Scripture is full of evidences, which prove that
angels are guardians to the godly, and watch over them; for the Lord,
for whose service they are ever ready, thus employs them: and in this we
also see the singular love of God towards us; for he employs his angels
especially for this purpose, that he might show that our salvation is
greatly valued by him.

<span id="iii.ii.x-p7"></span>There is then nothing wrong, if we say
that any one of the angels prayed for the Church. But absurdly, and very
foolishly do the Papists hence conclude, that dead saints are our
advocates before God, or that they pray for us; for we never read that
it is an office committed to the dead to intercede for us; nay, the
duties of love, we know, are confined to the present life. When,
therefore, the faithful remove from this world, having finished their
course, they enter on a blessed life. Though then the case is different,
yet the Papists foolishly pass from angels to the dead: for as it has
been stated, the case of the faithful has been committed to angels, and
they ever watch over the whole body, and over every member of it. It is
then nothing strange that they offer prayers for the faithful; but it
does not hence follow, that angels are to be invoked by us. Why does
Scripture testify, that angels supplicate God for us? Is it that each of
us may flee to them? By no means; but that being assured of God’s
paternal love, we may entertain more hope and confidence; yea, that we
may courageously fight, being certain of victory, since celestial hosts
contend for us, according to what appears from many examples. For when
the servant of Elisha saw not the chariots flying in the air, he became
almost lost in despair; but his despair was instantly removed, when he
saw so many angels ready at hand for help, (<span
id="iii.ii.x-p7.1"></span>[2Ki
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#017)<span id="iii.ii.x-p7.1"></span>;.md)
so whenever God declares that angels are ministers for our safety, he
means to animate our faith; at the same time he does not send us to
angels; but this one thing is sufficient for us, that when God is
propitious to us, all the angels have a care for our salvation. And we
must further notice what is said by Christ,

<span id="iii.ii.x-p8"></span>“hereafter ye shall see angels ascending
and descending,”  
(<span id="iii.ii.x-p8.2"></span>[Joh
1:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#051)<span id="iii.ii.x-p8.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="iii.ii.x-p9"></span>which means, that when we are joined to
the head, there will thence proceed a sacred union between us and
angels; for Christ, we know, is equally Lord over all. When, therefore,
we are united to the body of Christ, it is certain that angels are
united to us, but only through Christ. All this favor then depends on
the one true Mediator. Far then is it from being the case, that
Scripture represents angels as patrons to whom we may pray. The meaning
then is what we have stated, when Zechariah says, that the angel thus
prayed, *O Jehovah of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on
Jerusalem and the cities of Judah?*

<span id="iii.ii.x-p10"></span>The angel seems in this place to have
indirectly blamed God for having too much delayed to bring help to his
Church: but this mode of speaking, we know, frequently occurs in the
prayers of the saints; they in a manner charged God with delay, that is,
according to the perception of their flesh. But this is not inconsistent
with the obedience of faith, since the faithful submit at length to the
counsel of God. Hence, however familiarly they may often expostulate
with God, when he seems to delay and to withhold his aid, they yet
restrain themselves, and at length feel assured that what God has
appointed is best. But they thus pour forth their cares and their
sorrows into the bosom of God, in order to disburden themselves. The
angel now adopts this form when he says, “How long wilt thou not show
mercy?” It is not however the complaint of unreasonable fervor, as that
of the ungodly, who in praying accuse God, rage against him, and quarrel
with his judgments. The angel then was not moved by any turbulent
feeling, nor were the saints, when they adopted this mode of praying;
but they did what God allows us all to do; they thus disburndened their
cares and sorrows.

<span id="iii.ii.x-p11"></span>We ought at the same time to notice the
special import of the words, “how long,” <span
id="iii.ii.x-p11.1"></span>עד-מתי, *od-mati?* The angel indeed
afterwards explains himself, when he expressly mentions the term of
seventy years.  <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) It was not then
without design, or through a strong impulse of feeling, that the angel
said, How long? but he had regard to a memorable prophecy, which was in
the mouth of all the godly; for God had fixed seventy years for the
exile of the people. Since the people knew that a time had been
predetermined by God, he does net here supplicate God according to his
own will, but only alleges the promise itself: and it is an usual thing
with the saints to plead before God what he has promised to them. What
indeed can better sustain our hope? and what can give us a greater
encouragement in praying, than when we plead with God according to his
promises? For God will have our prayers to be founded first on his
gratuitous goodness, and then on the constancy of his faithfulness and
truth. When therefore they thus address God, “O Lord, thou art true, and
thou hast promised this to us; relying on thy word, we dare ask what
otherwise we could not,” — they certainly do not exceed the limits as
though they prescribed to God a law, but anxiously seek to obtain what
had been freely offered. We have seen that the angel does not here
complain of delay, but that he founded his plea on that remarkable
prophecy, in which God had fixed the term of seventy years for his
people.

<span id="iii.ii.x-p13"></span>The angel seems in this place to have
indirectly blamed God for having too much delayed to bring help to his
Church: but this mode of speaking, we know, frequently occurs in the
prayers of the saints; they in a manner charged God with delay, that is,
according to the perception of their flesh. But this is not inconsistent
with the obedience of faith, since the faithful submit at length to the
counsel of God. Hence, however familiarly they may often expostulate
with God, when he seems to delay and to withhold his aid, they yet
restrain themselves, and at length feel assured that what God has
appointed is best. But they thus pour forth their cares and their
sorrows into the bosom of God, in order to disburden themselves. The
angel now adopts this form when he says, “How long wilt thou not show
mercy?” It is not however the complaint of unreasonable fervor, as that
of the ungodly, who in praying accuse God, rage against him, and quarrel
with his judgments. The angel then was not moved by any turbulent
feeling, nor were the saints, when they adopted this mode of praying;
but they did what God allows us all to do; they thus disburdened their
cares and sorrows.  <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md)

<span id="iii.ii.x-p15"></span>I have said, that it is more suitable to
the passage to say, that the cities had been despised by God: but if any
prefers the other view, I will not contend; yet whosoever will minutely
consider the intention of the Prophet, will, I think, readily assent to
the idea, that the cities had been despised or rejected by God, because
he gave them no sign of his mercy.  <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md)
It now follows —

<span id="iii.ii.xi"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#013.md)<span id="iii.ii.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p2"></span>**13.** And the Lord answered the angel
that talked with me *with* good words *and* comfortable words.

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p3"></span>**13.** Et respondit Iehova angelo mecum
loquenti verba bona (*vel***,** dulcia) verba consolatoria.

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p5"></span><span id="iii.ii.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p6"></span>The Prophet shows here, that though God
did not immediately on the first day stretch forth his hand to the
miserable Jews, he was yet propitious to them. But we must notice, that
God speaks only, and does not yet manifest his power. The Prophet’s
design must be here observed; for first he reminds the faithful that
there was no reason for them to despair, or to be cast down with sorrow;
for celestial angels prayed to God for them, and pleaded for their
salvation. This is one thing. But a greater and fuller confirmation is
added; for God testifies that he is ready to deliver the Jews, though he
does not declare this immediately at first. And here we may remark, that
it ought to be sufficient to sustain our hope and patience, when God
testifies and affirms that he favors us, and that our salvation is dear
to him, however miserable our condition may apparently be. God might
indeed have immediately given a real proof to the Jews that the time had
come to restore them to full prosperity: this he did not, but only made
a promise. He gave words only: but his purpose was, by an actual trial,
to prove the patience and obedience of his people, when he said that he
had not forgotten his covenant, on which depended all the promises
previously made.

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p7"></span>But the Prophet seems to allude to a
prophecy of Isaiah in the fortieth chapter,

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p8"></span>“Comfort ye my people, saith your God.”
<span id="iii.ii.xi-p8.1"></span>[Isa
40:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.ii.xi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p9"></span>The Prophets had been for a long time
silent: it was indeed right that the Jews should remain long struggling,
as they had for so many years hardened themselves against all
threatening, and even despised all God’s judgments, according to what is
said by Isaiah,

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p10"></span>“Let us eat and drink, tomorrow we shall
die.”  
(<span id="iii.ii.xi-p10.2"></span>[Isa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013.md)<span
id="iii.ii.xi-p10.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.ii.xi-p11"></span>As then the obstinacy of the people had
been so great, it was proper that they should long mourn without
comfort. But Isaiah says, that the time would come when God would
command his servants to comfort his people again as in former times.
Zechariah says now, that God spoke *consoling words*. We hence learn,
that the desires of the godly and the prayer of the angel had been
heard; for redemption was now nigh at hand, according to what is said in
the hundred and second Psalm, “It is time for thee, O God, to have mercy
on Sion, for its time is come;” that is, “The seventy years are
completed, which it has pleased thee to assign for our exile.” It now
follows —

<span id="iii.ii.xii"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#014.md)<span id="iii.ii.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p2"></span>**14.** So the angel that communed with
me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am
jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p3"></span>**14.** Et dixit angelus qui loquebatur
mecum**,** Clama dicendo**,** sic dicit Iehova exercituum**,** Zelatus
sum Ierusalem et Sion zelo magno.

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p5"></span><span id="iii.ii.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p6"></span>Zechariah now mentions the chief
consolation to which he had referred; for it would not have been
sufficient to say in general, and in a few words without explanation,
that God gave a kind answer to the angel. For we know how strong were
those temptations with which the faithful had to struggle. It was then
needful for them to be furnished, not with light weapons, in so arduous
a contest. This is the reason why Zechariah more fully expressed the
words by which God then strengthened the faith of his people.

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p7"></span>He says that the angel had spoken; and
he thus intimates that the consolation was not given privately to the
angel that he might keep it in his own bosom, but convey it to the whole
people. This was not then a secret consolation but what the Lord
intended to be proclaimed by his Prophets, according to what is said by
Isaiah in the passage to which we have already referred — “Comfort ye,
comfort ye my people saith your God.”

<span id="iii.ii.xii-p8"></span>What God says, that he was *moved with
great zeal for Jerusalem and Sion*,  <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) is according to the common language of
Scripture. For as God cannot otherwise sufficiently express the
ineffable favor which he has towards his elect he is pleased to adopt
this similitude, that he undertakes the defense of his people according
to what is done by a husband who fights with the greatest zeal for his
own wife. This is the reason why he says that he was zealous for
Jerusalem. And we ought especially to notice this mode of speaking, that
we may not think that God is indifferent when he delays and defers his
aid: for as we are hasty in our wishes so we would have God to be
precipitant in the same manner; and we impute to him indifference when
he does not hasten according to our desires. These doubts God checks
when he testifies that he is zealous: for he intimates that his slowness
did not proceed from neglect or because he despised or disregarded them;
but that there was another reason why he held them in suspense. We may
therefore be fully persuaded that even when God withholds his aid he is
not otherwise affected towards us than the best of fathers towards his
own children; and further that the signs of his love do not appear
because it is not always expedient for us to be delivered soon from our
troubles. Let this then be our shield against all hasty desires, so that
we may not indulge our too ardent wishes, or think that our salvation is
neglected by God, when he hides himself for a time and does not
immediately stretch forth his hand to help us. It follows —

<span id="iii.ii.xiii"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.ii.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p2"></span>**15.** And I am very sore displeased
with the heathen *that are* at ease: for I was but a little displeased,
and they helped forward the affliction.

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p3"></span>**15.** Et ira magna ego irascor contra
gentes has quietas; quia ego iratus fui parum**,** et adjuverunt in
malum.

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p5"></span><span id="iii.ii.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p6"></span>God here obviates the doubt which might
have easily crept into the minds of the godly. “Why should he then give
up the miserable Jews to the will of the Gentiles, and suffer these
heathens at the same time to be in a quiet state and to enjoy their
pleasures?” This indeed at the first view seemed very strange: if God
had such a zeal towards Jerusalem, why did he not give some token at
least of his favor? He therefore gives this answer, — That though the
condition of the Gentiles was now better, there was yet no reason for
the Jews to be discontented in their troubles, because they were to look
forward to the end that was to come. It must further be noticed, that
God *speaks* only here, and is not going forth prepared to execute his
vengeance: and it is a real and just trial of faith, when God bids us to
depend on his word.

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p7"></span>The manner of speaking, used here
deserves notice, God was *angry with the quiet nations*. It is not a
superfluous repetition, when it is said, that the nations were quiet.
Some render the word wealthy, but not so suitably; for as we have said
before, the angel complained that while the whole world was tranquil,
God severely chastised his Church alone. God then does here anticipate a
temptation which would have otherwise distressed and even wholly
disheartened the faithful; and he in effect says, “It is indeed true
that the Gentiles all around are quiet, that there are no calamities,
that there is no enemy, and that they are subject to no evils: this is
no doubt true; but as I am angry, their happiness, while I am opposed to
and displeased with them, is a curse.” God, then, does here elevate the
thoughts of the godly, that they might know that happiness is to be
found in his favor alone, and that whenever he is angry or displeased,
though men may think themselves happy, and flatter themselves and exult
in their condition, they are yet in a most miserable state; for all
happiness is ruinous which does not flow from the fountain of God’s
gratuitous love; in short, when God is not our Father, the more we
abound in all kinds of blessings, the deeper we sink in all kinds of
miseries. This then is the meaning, when God says that he was angry with
the quiet nations.

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p8"></span>What, then, is the application of this
doctrine? That it behaved the Jews, though their condition was very hard
according to the perception of men, to have yet acquiesced in the love
of God, for they knew that he was their Father, and also, that though
they saw their enemies happy, they were yet to regard it no otherwise
than a cursed happiness. so also in the thirty-seventh Psalm, the
faithful are bid not to envy the unbelieving, while they saw them
flourishing in wealth and rolling in pleasures; for it behaved them to
regard their end. Let us hence learn to raise up our thoughts to the
contemplation of God’s hidden love, when he deals severely with us, and
to be satisfied with his word, as we have there an indubitable evidence
of his favor: nor let us envy our enemies and the wicked, however the
whole world may applaud them, and they themselves luxuriate in their
blessings, for we know that God is adverse to them.

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p9"></span>A reason also follows, *Because God was
a little angry, and they helped forward the evil*; that is, they
exceeded moderation. The meaning is, that the reward of cruelty would be
repaid to all the enemies of the Church, because they had exercised
immoderate severity, when it was God’s purpose to chastise his children
in a gentle and paternal manner.

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p10"></span>It may be here first asked, How is it
that God declares that he had been a little angry with his people, since
his judgment, as pronounced by his servants, was most severe?

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p11"></span>“Whosoever shall escape the famine,
shall fall by the sword;  
whosoever shall escape the sword, shall fall among wild beasts.”  
(<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p11.3"></span>[Eze
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.ii.xiii-p11.3"></span>.)

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p12"></span>And in many other places he declares
the same, that there would be no hope of pardon to the people, but that
they were all to perish; that is, the whole body: “Though Noah, Daniel,
and Job,” he says, “were in this city, they shall deliver only their
lives; but I will not hear their prayers for this irreclaimable people.”
But the particle little, <span id="iii.ii.xiii-p12.1"></span>מעט, *mot*,
must be applied to the elect: for though God in his dreadful vengeance
consumed almost the whole people, yet a remnant, as we know, was
preserved. This is the reason why God says, that he was but little angry
with his people; for he speaks not of the reprobate and of that impure
mass from which he purposed to cleanse his own house; but he has respect
to his covenant. We now perceive for what purpose Zechariah says, that
God was but moderately angry with his people.

<span id="iii.ii.xiii-p13"></span>But another difficulty meets us — In
what sense did the nations help on the evil? For it hence follows, that
the heathens were not restrained from raging immoderately and at their
pleasure. And this place has been also laid hold of by that miscreant,
who has been lately writing against God’s providence, holding that the
wicked become wanton by means of God’s hand and power, and are not
thereby restrained. But this is extremely foolish; for the Prophet here
does not regard what the nations were able to do or had done; but, on
the contrary, he speaks of their cruelty, that they thought that there
ought to have been no end until the memory of that people had been
obliterated. And this is the reason why Isaiah says, “Thou hast not seen
her end.” He therefore upbraids the unbelieving, that they did not
calculate rightly as to the end of the Church; for the unbelieving
furiously attempted to destroy it, as though that promise could be made
void, “My mercy I will not take away.” Since the unbelieving did not see
her end, because it was the Lord’s will ever to preserve some remnant
among his chosen people, the Prophet says, that they *helped forward the
evil*. We now then perceive the intention of the Prophet, and see that
the object is no other but to sustain the hope of the faithful, until
what they heard from the mouth of God really took place. Let us proceed
-

<span id="iii.ii.xiv"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xiv-p1"></span><span
id="iii.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Zechariah
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#016.md)<span id="iii.ii.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xiv-p2"></span>**16.** Therefore thus saith the Lord; I
am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it,
saith the Lord of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon
Jerusalem.

<span id="iii.ii.xiv-p3"></span>**16.** Propterea sic dicit Iehovah**,**
Reversus sum ad Ierusalem in miserationibus; domus mea aedificabitur in
ea**,** dicit Iehovah exercituum; et linea extendetur super Ierusalem.

<span id="iii.ii.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.ii.xiv-p5"></span><span id="iii.ii.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xiv-p6"></span>This is a confirmation of the last
prophecy, — that God purposed to put an end to his chastisement, as it
is said by Isaiah, “They have received at Jehovah’s hand double for all
their sins.” For in these words God reminds us that he was satisfied
with the punishment he had inflicted on his people, like a father, who
thinks that he had been sufficiently severe and rigid in punishing his
son. So now, *Thus saith Jehovah, I have returned to Jerusalem in
mercies*: for it was necessary to give the people the hope of pardon and
reconciliation, that they might look forward with confidence. Hypocrites
very quickly raise up their crests as soon as a kind word is addressed
to them; but the faithful, being conscious of what is wrong, and having
their sins before their eyes, do not so easily take courage; nor can
they do so, until they are convinced that their sins are buried, and
that they themselves are freed from guilt. Hence the Prophet says, that
God had turned to Jerusalem, that the Jews might know that the
punishment with which God had visited them was to be only for a time.

<span id="iii.ii.xiv-p7"></span>But in the meantime he exhorts them to
humility: for the people could not from this prophecy entertain any
hope, except they duly considered that they had suffered justly, because
they had provoked God’s wrath. Hence the Prophet reminds them that what
they had hitherto endured was to be imputed to their sins; but that God
yet intended to treat them in a paternal manner; for, as I have already
stated, he had promised that his mercy towards his elect and faithful
would be perpetual. Hence he says, that he had *returned in mercies to
Jerusalem*

<span id="iii.ii.xiv-p8"></span>He then adds, *My house shall be built
in it; and over Jerusalem shall a line be stretched forth*. Line, <span
id="iii.ii.xiv-p8.1"></span>קוה, *kue*, is to be taken for a
perpendicular line, as in <span id="iii.ii.xiv-p8.2"></span>[Isa
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#017.md)<span
id="iii.ii.xiv-p8.2"></span>, and in other places. There is here an
addition of <span id="iii.ii.xiv-p8.3"></span>ה, *he*, for as it has
been elsewhere said, the language had become somewhat degenerated. The
import of the whole is, that there was a hope of the temple and of the
city being built, because God had returned into favor with the people.
There are then two things to be noticed, — that God was now pacified
towards Jerusalem, — and that the fruit of reconciliation would be the
building of the temple, the establishment of divine worship and of the
dignity of the kingdom. The Prophet teaches us at the same time, that
the building of the temple was not to be expected but as an instance of
God’s gratuitous favor, so that the Jews might know that every hope
would have been cut off, had not God been pleased to abolish their
guilt.

<span id="iii.ii.xiv-p9"></span>This doctrine ought also to be extended
to the state of the Church at all times: for whence comes it that the
Church remains safe in the world? Nay, how is it that it sometimes
increases, except that God indulges us according to his infinite
goodness? For we cease not daily to provoke him, and deserve to be
wholly exterminated from the world. There would then be no Church, were
not God to preserve it in a wonderful manner through his goodness and
mercies, and also to restore it when it seems to have wholly fallen. He
at length adds —

and reconcilable to us, so that we may not despair in our greatest
troubles, but relying on thy goodness may utter our groans to thee,
until the ripened time of our deliverance shall come: nor let us in the
meantime envy the evanescent happiness of thy enemies; but patiently
wait, while thou showest that the chief object of desire is to have thee
propitious to us, and that accursed is every good thing which the
ungodly receive while they provoke thee and make thee angry, until
Christ shall at length reveal to us the real happiness and glory of thy
Church, when he shall appear at the last day for our salvation — Amen.

<span id="iii.ii.xvii"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xvii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Thirty-seventh

<span id="iii.ii.xvii-p2"></span><span id="iii.ii.xvii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xvii-p3"></span>I was not able in my last lecture fully
to explain the verse in which the Prophet says that he was commanded by
the angel to cry again, that God had returned to Jerusalem in mercies.
The design of the words is this, — that though it was difficult to
believe the restoration of Jerusalem, it was yet to be fully expected,
for the Lord had so appointed. But he enlarges on what I have before
stated; for the blessing of God is extended to the cities of Judah,
though an express mention is made only of Jerusalem. *Yet cities*, he
says, *shall wear out through abundance of blessings*; for so I think
the verb <span id="iii.ii.xvii-p3.1"></span>תפוצנה, *tephutzne*, is to
be taken, as futs means to spread, and also to wear out, and to break.
Some elicit a forced meaning, that cities would spread themselves;
others, that they would be separated, that is, that security would be so
great, that cities, though distant from one another, would be in no
danger or fear. But the meaning of the Prophet is clear, unless we
designedly pervert it in a matter so manifest and easy. The cities, he
says, shall be worn out or wearied through abundance of blessings, or as
we say, *elles seront entassees*; for where there is a great heap, there
is crushing. He therefore says, that so great and so full would be the
abundance of all things, that the corn would press down itself, and that
the vessels would hardly contain the vintage. We now perceive what the
Prophet means, — that Jerusalem would yet be made complete, and also
that other cities would be filled with all good things, because God
would extend his favor to the whole people.  <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md)

<span id="iii.ii.xvii-p7"></span>He then adds, *Comfort Zion will yet
Jehovah, and he will yet choose Jerusalem*. The particle <span
id="iii.ii.xvii-p7.1"></span>פוף, *oud*, yet, is repeated; for the
suspension of favor, of which we have before spoken, might have somewhat
prevented the faithful from realising the promise. As then God’s favor
was for a time hid, the angel declares, that such would be the change,
that God’s goodness and love towards his chosen people would again shine
forth as in former days.

<span id="iii.ii.xvii-p8"></span>As to the word “chosen,” it must be
observed, that it is applied, not in its strict sense, to the effect or
the evidence of election; for God had chosen before the creation of the
world whom he had designed to be his own. But he is said to choose whom
he receives into favor, because their adoption seems obliterated in the
eyes of men, when there appears no evidence of his paternal favor. As
for instance, whenever we read that God had repudiated his own people,
it is certain, as Paul says, that the calling of God is without
repentance, (<span id="iii.ii.xvii-p8.1"></span>[Ro
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md)<span
id="iii.ii.xvii-p8.1"></span>:) nor does he declare this only of the
secret election of each, but also of that general election, by which God
had set apart the race of Abraham from the rest of the nations. At the
same time many of Abraham’s children were reprobates, as he instances in
the case of Esau and of others: yet the election of God was
unchangeable; and hence it was that there remained still some hope as to
that people, that God would at length gather to himself a Church from
the Jews as well as from the Gentiles, so that those who were then
separated might be hereafter united together. Since then the calling of
God is without repentance, αμετα μελητος, how is it that the Lord is
often said to choose, and is also said to reject his chosen? These
expressions refer to the outward appearance of things. God therefore
will secure his own election to the end; but as we cannot otherwise
perceive but that we are rejected by God when he turns away his face
from us, he is said to choose again those whom he has repudiated, that
is, when he really and by a clear evidence proves that he has not
forgotten their first adoption, but that he continues unchangeable in
his purpose.

<span id="iii.ii.xvii-p9"></span>We now then understand what the Prophet
means. I have more fully dwelt on this point, because it is necessary to
understand this great truth, — that whatever blessings God confers on
his own people proceed from eternal election, that this is a perpetual
fountain, and yet that election is catachrestically  <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) applied to its evidences or effects, as
also rejection is to be taken in the same sense for outward punishment,
which seems at the first view to be an evidence of rejection, though it
be not really so. Let us now proceed -

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p11"></span><span id="iii.ii.xviii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p12"></span>Now follows another vision, by which
God confirms what he had before testified to his Prophet. He then says,
that though enemies should on every side rise up against the Church and
cause it many troubles, there was yet a remedy in God’s hand, as he
would break in pieces all horns by his hammers. He compares the
Gentiles, who had been hostile to the Jews, to horns; and he afterwards
compares to workmen the other enemies, whose hand and labor God would
use for the purpose of breaking down the efforts of all those who would
be troublesome to the Church. The import of the whole then is, — that
though the Church would not be exempt and free from troubles, and those
many, yet God would have in his hand those remedies by which he would
check all the assaults of the wicked, however impetuously and violently
they may rage against his miserable Church.

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p13"></span>But let us see in the first place why
the Prophet mentions *four horns*. The Jews refer to the Assyrians and
the Babylonians, to the Persian, the Grecians, and the Romans; because
we find in other places, and Daniel especially shows very clearly,
(<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p13.1"></span>[Da
2:32](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#032.md)<span
id="iii.ii.xviii-p13.1"></span>,) that there were to be four principal
monarchies, by which God intended to give clear and memorable examples
of his judgments. But the Prophet, I have no doubt, speaks here of the
Moabites and of the Syrians, and of other nations, as well as of the
Assyrians or Chaldees. They are then mistaken, as I think, who suppose
that these four monarchies are intended here:  <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) but Zechariah says that they were four
horns, because they arose from the four quarters of the world; for we
know that the Jews were not harassed only on one side, but on the east
and the west, on the north and the south. Since then enemies on every
side joined their strength and their forces against the Jews, so that
there was a cause for trembling from the four quarters of the world,
that is, from all places around them, the Prophet says, that they had
been *scattered by four horns*

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p15"></span>This view, however, seems still
frigid, because it was not necessary for the Prophet to state what was
well known to all: but God intended to show that the nations which had
been inimical and hostile to the Jews, had done nothing but through his
hidden impulse, in order that the Jews might understand that these were
so many scourges by which he purposed to chastise them.

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p16"></span><span id="iii.ii.xviii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p17"></span>But we must join the latter part, —
that God showed also to the Prophet *four smiths*, for these two visions
are connected together. Whosoever then takes only the first part, acts
very absurdly, for the meaning of the prophecy will not be thus evident.
If then we would not mutilate what is connected, we must not separate
what is added respecting the four smiths. Inasmuch then as the Jews had
been on every side oppressed, God shows that he has remedies enough, and
even from various quarters. The Prophet had seen four horns; he now sees
four smiths, that is, he is made to know that God can immediately find
means to check all disorders and tumults; for he can beat as it were on
an anvil these horns, and break in pieces those which had previously
scattered the Jews. The same view then is to be taken of the number
*four* as in the former instance: for as the Chaldeans had raged against
the Jews, so the Lord shows that he had enemies ready at hand, as he had
already in part made it evident; for how was it that the Persian and
Medes had so suddenly taken possession of Babylon, had they not been
workmen whom God had employed to strike down the Babylonian horn? And
whence was it that the Syrians, the Egyptians, and other nations had
been made prostrate? It was because they were horns. But the Lord broke
down the ferocity of so many nations by his many workmen, for he
employed these as though they were hired and ready to do his service. We
now apprehend the real object of the Prophet.

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p18"></span>But though the Prophet intended by
this prophecy to encourage and animate to patience his own nation, as
the Spirit of God had given him this office; yet there is here set
before us by the Lord as in a mirror, the real condition of the Church
at this day. Let us not then wonder if the world rage on every side
against the Church and if storms and tempests arise from the east as
well as from the west: nor is it a new thing that many enemies from
various parts unite together; and that God’s Church should thus have to
bear many assaults. This is one thing. In the meantime let this be our
consolation, — that God has many smiths at hand. Very apposite is the
Prophet’s metaphor; for the hardiness of the horns was formidable LO the
Jews; but the Prophet intimates that there is hardness in the hammers,
capable of breaking in pieces all horns. God then, though we may be
struck by our enemies, will find smiths to break them in pieces; and
this indeed is what we have found by experience. How comes it, that the
small number of those who purely worship God continue to exist,
notwithstanding the rage of enemies, and in spite of so many
consultations and devices? For what do all monarchies desire more, or
with greater avidity, than to extinguish the memory of the gospel? If
then we enquire, what is the condition of the whole world at this day,
we shall find that there is hardly a city or a people, or a monarch, or
even one of the least princes, whose race is not exhibited against the
Church. How then comes it, that they do not put forth their strength and
demolish the Church, which by one breath might a hundred times fall to
the ground? How is this, except that God by his handlers breaks the
horns, and that by means of smiths?

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p19"></span><span id="iii.ii.xviii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p20"></span>And who are these smiths? They are
also horns; for they all wish to destroy as much as they can the Church;
but God does not permit them; on the contrary he excites them to mutual
wars to destroy one another. Though then all these are horns, ready to
assault the Church, and though it appears evident from the comparison
that they are as it were furious and vicious bulls, and as much as they
can unite together to scatter the Church, yet God gives hammers to two
or three of them, and bids them to check the ferocity of their
associates. While all these are intent on striking and dispersing the
Church by their horns, the Lord calls them to a different work, and as I
have said, bids them to be smiths that they may strike and break in
pieces these horns, even their associates, with whom they had previously
wickedly conspired. And it is certainly a wonderful instance of God’s
providence, that amidst so violent and turbulent commotions the Church
should take breath, though under the cross; for except these hammers had
broken the horns, we must have been pierced through, not only a hundred
but a thousand times, and had been dashed into fragments. But God has
turned aside their strokes and assaults by his hammers, and, as I have
said, has employed his enemies for this purpose.

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p21"></span>We now then see that this prophecy
was not only useful in the age of Zechariah, but that it has been so in
all ages, and that it ought not to be confined to the ancient people,
but extended to the whole body of the Church.

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p22"></span>But the Prophet, by saying that he
asked the angel, sets before us an example of a truly teachable
disposition. Though the Lord then may not immediately explain to us his
messages, there is yet no reason for us in disdain to reject what is
obscure, as we see to be done by many in our day; for when any thing
seems ambiguous to them, they immediately reject it, and also complain
that God’s word is extremely difficult; and such blasphemies are uttered
by many at this day. But the Prophet, though perplexed, did not yet
morosely reject what God had showed; on the contrary, he asked the
angels. Though the angels are not nigh us, or at least do not appear to
us in a visible form, yet God can by other means afford us help when
there is any perplexity in his word: he promises to give us the spirit
of understanding and wisdom, whenever there is need; and we also know
that the preaching of the word and the sacraments are helps to lead us
to himself. If then we neglect not these helps which God affords us, and
especially if we ask him to guide us by his Spirit, there will certainly
be nothing obscure or intricate in the prophecies, which he will not, as
far as it is necessary, make known to us. He does not indeed give the
Spirit in an equal degree to all; but we ought to feel assured, that
though prophecies may be obscure, there will yet be a sure profit
derived, if we be teachable and submissive to God; for we find that
Zechariah was not deprived of his request, as the angel gave him an
immediate answer.

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p23"></span>It must also be observed, that in one
place he calls him Jehovah, and in another angel; and indeed he speaks
thus indiscriminately of one and the same person. It hence follows that
God appeared among the angels. But we must remember what I have already
said, that this chief angel was the Mediator and the Head of the Church;
and the same is Jehovah, for Christ, as we know, is God manifested in
the flesh. There is then no wonder that the Prophet should
indiscriminately call him angel and Jehovah, he being the Mediator of
the Church, and also God. He is God, being of the same essence with the
Father; and Mediator, having already undertaken his Mediatorial office,
though not then clothed in our flesh, so as to become our brother; for
the Church could not exist, nor be united to her God without a head. We
hence see that Christ, as to his eternal essence, is said to be God, and
that he is called an angel on account of his office, that is, of a
Mediator.

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p24"></span>The meaning is now evident: God
declares that the horns were those which dispersed or scattered Judah as
well as Jerusalem, and the kingdom of Israel: but that he had as many
smiths,  <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) who would by force and by
hammers, shatter these horns in pieces, though for a time they would
greatly harass the Church. It must be also noticed that horn is to be
taken differently when the number is changed: the Gentiles are called
horns in the plural number to show their hardness or their strength; and
they are then said to lift up their horn in the singular number to show
that they ferociously exerted all their power to lay prostrate or to
scatter the people of God. Then follows —

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p5"></span> This refers no doubt to Zechariah, and
not to Ido, according to the usual order adopted in Hebrew, and also
because the object is to show that Zechariah, and not Ido, was a
prophet. It is a name give, as *Cocceius* observes, not only to him who
announces future things, but to every one who as God’s minister
proclaims his words, explains spiritual things, and applies them to the
conscience. — *Ed.*

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p19"></span>Wroth was Jehovah,

<span id="iii.ii.ii-p23"></span> The verb, \[<span
id="iii.ii.ii-p23.1"></span>שב\], means to turn, and to return.
*Newcome* retains our version, “turn,” but *Marckius* and *Henderson*
adopt with *Calvin* the word “return,” though *Henderson*, in verse 4,
has “turn.” The most suitable rendering seems to be “return,” as it
intimates a departure, which was the case in both instances, with
respect to the people, and also with respect to God. They had departed
from God, and God had departed from them; they had also departed from
God’s ways. “Return” therefore is the most appropriate term. — *Ed.*

id="iii.ii.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p12"></span> This sentence is peculiar in its
construction. Our version, “unto whom the former Prophets have cried,”
gives the meaning, but not the form of the sentence, which perhaps can
hardly be done except in *Welsh*; but in that language the idiom is
exactly the same. The relative “whom,” \[<span
id="iii.ii.iii-p12.1"></span>אשר\] comes first, then the verb, followed
by a pronoun having a preposition prefixed to it — “to them,” \[<span
id="iii.ii.iii-p12.2"></span>שמע\]. The literal rendering in English
would be, “whom they called (or cried) to them, the Prophets the
former.” The rendering in *Welsh* would be the Hebrew word for word —

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p13"></span><span id="iii.ii.iii-p13.1"></span>Y
*rhai y galwodd arnynt y prophwydi blaenorol*

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p14"></span>Calvin in his version renders \[<span
id="iii.ii.iii-p14.1"></span>אשר\], “<span
id="iii.ii.iii-p14.2"></span>quia,” which is not correct; it ought to
have been “<span id="iii.ii.iii-p14.3"></span>ouibus.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_12"></span>[13](cc30004.htm#fr_12.md) <span
id="iii.ii.iii-p14.4"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.iii-p15"></span> It is not perhaps exactly a
repetition. *Newcome* retains our version, “hear” and “hearken;” but
*Henderson* has “hearken” and “give heed.” The first, \[<span
id="iii.ii.iii-p15.1"></span>שמע\], is the mere act of hearing; but the
second, \[<span id="iii.ii.iii-p15.2"></span>קשב\], means attention; it
signifies to incline the ear so as to listen. The Jews had been
unwilling to hear, or to give the least attention to what had been said
to them. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_13"></span>[14](cc30004.htm#fr_13.md) <span
id="iii.ii.vi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p9"></span> This notion was originated by the
*Targum*. The second was adopted by *Cyril* and others, as well as by
*Jerome;* but *Drusius*, *Grotius*, *Mede*, *Marckius*, *Newcome*, and
*Henderson* agree with the view given by *Calvin*. — *Ed.*

id="iii.ii.vi-p16.3"></span>decreta,” *Dathius*; “decrees,” *Henderson*.
The word means what is defined or appointed, as an order or a course, or
a portion. It signifies here the portion defined and allotted to the
Jews, the judgments denounced on them, which had been executed. They
were God’s defined and allotted portions, what he had exactly described
and defined by his Prophets. He says first, “my words,” a general term,
and then, to express more distinctly what was intended, he adds, “my
decrees,” or my appointments, or my allotted portions. — *Ed.*

<span id="iii.ii.vi-p17"></span> “Overtake” is adopted by *Newcome* and
*Henderson*; “<span id="iii.ii.vi-p17.1"></span>supervenerunt“ — came
upon,” *Grotius*. God’s judgments pursued and overtook them as a hunter
his prey, or an enemy a flying enemy. — *Ed.*

ut reversi dixerint — so that when they returned they said,” *Jun.* et
*Trem.,* and *Piscator*; “so that they turned and said,” *Henderson*.
*Newcome* continues the question from the preceding line, “and did they
*not* return and say?” The “return” here seems not to have been from a
sinful course, but from exile. The confession was made by those who
returned from Babylon. The sentence may be thus rendered, “when they
returned, they said.” — *Ed.*

*Sept*.; “dun,” *Newcome*; “bay,” *Henderson*; “gilvus-ash color,”
*Bochart*; “brown,” *Blayney.* It seems to have been a mixed color,
between red and white, to denote a mixed state of things.

less than *three* events are coincident with this number, as it is
clearly proved by *Petavius*, *Prideaux*, *Bishop Newton*, and others.

“So that taking it,” says *Prideaux*, “which way you will, and at what

<span id="iii.ii.x-p16"></span> The contrast seems to show that
displeasure, or wrath, or flaming wrath, which \[<span
id="iii.ii.x-p16.1"></span>זעם\], pity or compassion, is what is prayed
for. God had been as it were angry or indignant, but now his pity is
solicited. He is asked to show pity to a people to whom he had
manifested extreme displeasure. “Compassionate” and “angry” are the two
words used by *Henderson*; and “have mercy” and “had indignation,” by
*Newcome*. The former appears to be the most appropriate rendering.
Compassion or pity, and anger or wrath, seem to be the contrasts. —

the *Septuagint*; “shall spread themselves,” by *Grotius*; “shall be
spread abroad,” by *Newcome*; “shall overflow,” by *Henderson*. There
are here two ideas; one derived from the Targum, and the other from the
Septuagint. The original verb means properly to burst out, to dilate, to
spread; and the line may be rendered.

<span id="iii.ii.xvii-p5"></span>Burst out again shall my cities through
abundance.

<span id="iii.ii.xvii-p6"></span>The reference seems to be to their
enlargement, and not to their multiplicity, as *Newcome* thinks, and
that through abundance of blessings, literally, “though good,” \[<span
id="iii.ii.xvii-p6.1"></span>מטוב\], or good things, the poetical
singular instead of the plural. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_25"></span>[26](cc30004.htm#fr_25.md) <span
id="iii.ii.xvii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xvii-p10"></span> <span
id="iii.ii.xvii-p10.1"></span>Καταχρηστικως, forcedly, contrary to usage
or what is strictly correct. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_26"></span>[27](cc30004.htm#fr_26.md) <span
id="iii.ii.xviii-p13.2"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p14"></span> Some of the Rabbins, *Jerome*,
*Vatablus*, and latterly *Blayney*, have adopted this view; but it is
wholly inadmissible. The single reason that the *past* enemies of the
Jews are here referred to, is a sufficient refutation. The number *four*
is differently accounted, for by *Cyril* and some others. It is
explained of the four principal enemies of the Jews — Pul, Shalmenezar,
Sennacherib, and Nebuchadnezzar. But what *Calvin* says seems most
satisfactory. “Why four? to denote that these kingdoms had many enemies,
enemies on every side, <span id="iii.ii.xviii-p14.1"></span>[Ezr
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr004.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.ii.xviii-p14.1"></span>; <span
id="iii.ii.xviii-p14.2"></span>[Ne
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/neh004.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.ii.xviii-p14.2"></span>.” — *Newcome*. With this view
*Theodoret*, *Marckius*, and *Henderson* also agree. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_27"></span>[28](cc30004.htm#fr_27.md) <span
id="iii.ii.xviii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p25"></span> The word, \[<span
id="iii.ii.xviii-p25.1"></span>חרשים\], is of general import, and means
artificers, or workmen either in iron, brass, stone, or wood. It is
rendered “workmen” by *Newcome* and *Henderson*, and “carpenters” in our
version. They may be viewed here as signifying skillful men, fitted to
do the work assigned to them. The terms used to designate what they were
to do, would lead us to this supposition; they were to “drive away” and
to “thrust away.” It was not then a work suitable to any particular
trade: hence, “skillful men,” would be perhaps the most suitable
rendering.

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p26"></span>To give the meaning of terrifying to
\[<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p26.1"></span>החריד\] seems not suitable here:
the idea must be similar to that included in \[<span
id="iii.ii.xviii-p26.2"></span>ידות\], which is not introduced as
explanatory. To cause to fly or to move quickly, is the most common
meaning of the first verb, so that it may be rendered, “drive or hurry
away:” and the other verb means to throw or cast out, to hurl, to thrust
forth or away. It seems to note a stronger action, or a greater force
than the former.

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p27"></span>There is here an evident instance in
which \[<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p27.1"></span>אלה\] being repeated must
be rendered, *those* and *these*; there is otherwise a confusion in the
passage. I offer the following version: —

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p28"></span>**21.** And I said, “What *are* these
coming to do?” And he said, saying, “Those *are* the horns which have
scattered Judah, so that no one lifted up his head; and these are come
to drive them away, — to thrust away the horns of the nations, which
have raised the horn over the land of Judah, to scatter it abroad.”

<span id="iii.ii.xviii-p29"></span>Notwithstanding this difference as to
the literal rendering of this verse, yet the general drift of *Calvin’s*
remarks remains the same. — *Ed.*
