*Take to thee a wife, etc*., Whether the marriage of the Prophet was a
real transaction or not, has been a subject much controverted by the
learned. Bishop Horsley, in his Introduction to his New Translation of
Hosea, defends, with his usual ability, the opinion that it was a real
marriage. Dr. Henderson, in his work on the Minor Prophets, takes the
same view. The strongest point in favor of the opposite sentiment, that
it was a kind of a parabolic representation, is the command, similar to
this, which is given to the Prophet in the third chapter; and to this
Calvin especially alludes. Though the latter command is similar, yet it
materially differs in many circumstances; and the design of the
transaction is wholly different.

<span id="vii.i-p6"></span>The reason for what is commanded is given in
both instances. The first marriage was to represent the defection of
this people from God, because “by wantoning the land had grown wanton,
that it did not follow Jehovah.” The second contract (for it was no
marriage) was to set forth “the love of Jehovah towards the children of
Israel.”

<span id="vii.i-p7"></span>There seems to be no ground for the opinion,
that the first wife, Gomer, is “the woman” mentioned in the third
chapter, who, having been repudiated for her incontinence, was again to
be restored. The dowry which the Prophet is said to have given for her,
according to the usual manner of those times, clearly shows that it was
a new engagement, and not the renewal of a former union. What Dr.
Henderson states in favor of what he thinks to have been a reunion,
seems to be of no force. The command, he says, is different; it is not
“take,” but “love.” The evident reason for this difference is, that it
was no marriage but a contract for marriage, as the sequel evidently
proves: he “bought” her, she was to “abide” for him, she was not to be
for another, and he promised to be for her.

<span id="vii.i-p8"></span>The evident design of the first marriage,
whether real or not, was to represent the state of the people at that
time, in their idolatry, and the ruinous consequences of that idolatry.
The evident design of what is recorded in the third chapter, as Calvin
states at large, was to set forth the dealings of God with the people
during their exile. As the latter transaction bears much the appearance
of a parable, we may reasonably conclude that the first was of the same
character.

<span id="vii.i-p9"></span>It may be added, that *Marckius,* who wrote
largely and learnedly on the Minor Prophets, maintains that “children of
wantonness,” or of fornications, do not mean spurius children, but those
addicted to wantonness; as in the case of the mother, who was not called
a woman of fornications because of her birth, but of her lewd conduct.
The children, then, were thus called prospectively; that is, with regard
to what they would be. Now, if this be true as to the children, the
question may be asked, Was not this also the case with the mother; that
is, was she not called prospectively “a wife of fornications?” This
would certainly be a corrector emblem of the state of the people, who
had become idolaters, after God as it were married them, or entered into
covenant with them.

following texts are adduced: — <span id="vii.i-p10.3"></span>[Gen.

<span id="vii.i-p10.8"></span>[Isa
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#009.md)<span id="vii.i-p10.8"></span>.
These are *all* the instances in which the verb <span
id="vii.i-p10.9"></span>נשא is followed by <span
id="vii.i-p10.10"></span>ל, without an objective case: and it means
invariably to forgive, and not to take away. And the last text in Isaiah
has nearly the very words of this passage, <span
id="vii.i-p10.11"></span>ולא-תשא להם, “and forgive them not.”

<span id="vii.i-p11"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p11.2"></span>[Hosea.
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#011.md)<span id="vii.i-p11.2"></span>**,
*Her new moon,* *etc*., It is the character of poetry to use the
singular number in a collective sense; her new moon, not her new moons.
Several instances of this we meet with in this chapter: “her vine and
her fig-tree” — “her ear-ring and her chain” — “the bird of heaven and
the reptile of the earth,” — all these, though in the singular number,
are to be understood as including multiplicity. Calvin retains this
poetic character of the original. It would have been better if it had
been retained in all translations.

<span id="vii.i-p12"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p12.2"></span>[Hosea
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#004.md)<span id="vii.i-p12.2"></span>,**
*Without a statue*, *etc*., “If I may offer a conjecture concerning the
difference between these idolatrous statues and teraphim, I would say,
that the statues were of large dimensions, set up in public, as objects
of popular adoration, \[as crucifixes, etc., in Popish countries:\] the
teraphim were of a smaller size, and for different purposes; kept in the
most secret recesses of the temples or consecrated chapels, for magical
rites, and rarely, if ever, exposed to public view.

<span id="vii.i-p13"></span>“Thus, since it appears that both the statue
and the teraphim of Hosea were impliments of idolatry, no doubt can
remain, that the *ephod,* which is mentioned between the two, is to be
understood of the idolatrous ephod, not that which belonged to the holy
vestments of the high priest. As it is put between the statue and the
teraphim, it may seem, that it may be connected with either: connected
with the statue, it will denote the robe with which the idol was
clothed: connected with the teraphim, the ephod of the priest of the
teraphim. And in this connection (to which, indeed, the structure of the
sentence in the original seems to point in preference) I would choose to
take it. For thus we shall have idolatry described by the three
principal features in its external appearance, — the statue, the public
object of popular adoration, — the teraphim, the images of the more
secret rites of incantation, — and the sorcerer, or heirophant,
conduction the ceremonies, and propounding to the consultors of the
oracle the answers he pretended to receive, represented by the ephod,
the most remarkable of his robes of office.” — <span
id="vii.i-p13.1"></span>Bishop Horsely

<span id="vii.i-p14"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p14.2"></span>[Hosea
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.i-p14.2"></span>,**
*To iniquity they lift up the heart of each,* Probably the words are not
correctly rendered according to the exposition given by Calvin. As he
explains *As to iniquity,* would be perhaps the best rendering; for his
comment is, “that the priests lifted up the soul of each by relieving
their consciences by soothing words of flattery.” However true this may
have been, yet the meaning of this sentence is, I believe, what I have
stated in a note. The rendering I have given removes the anomalies of
persons which Calvin notices. The persons who did eat or feed on the sin
of the people were evidently the priests, and they were those who raised
or lifted up the heart or mind of the people. The affix, *their,* to
iniquity, refers to the priests, and the affix, *his*, to the heart or
mind, refers to the people, and ought to be rendered, *their,* in our
language. Some copies have *their* appended to the word, <span
id="vii.i-p14.3"></span>נפשם; but this, I have no doubt, has been an
attempt, as in other instances, to correct what appeared to be an
anomaly. *Dr. Henderson* renders the line, “And long for their
iniquity,” and adds in a note, that <span id="vii.i-p14.4"></span>נשא
נפש, *to lift up the animal soul* for anything, means to *lust after
it,* long or have a strong desire for it. It has no doubt this meaning;
but it means also, to raise up, or guide, or direct the soul, including
the mind, the attention, and affections, to an object. The phrase is
included, with all its accompaniments, the verb, an objective case, and
the proposition <span id="vii.i-p14.5"></span>אל or <span
id="vii.i-p14.6"></span>אלי, in the following sentence, <span
id="vii.i-p14.7"></span>נפשי אשא אליך יהוה, ‘To thee, Jehovah, my soul I
lift up,’ <span id="vii.i-p14.8"></span>[Ps
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa025.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.i-p14.8"></span>.

<span id="vii.i-p15"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p15.2"></span>[Hosea
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018.md)<span id="vii.i-p15.2"></span>,**
*Putrid is become their drink,* *Newcome* reads, “He is gone after their
wine,” that is, of idols. But this rendering cannot be admitted, as it
gives a sense to <span id="vii.i-p15.3"></span>סר which it nowhere has.
*Horsley* renders thus, — “Their strong drink is vapid;” and has this
note, — The allusion is to libations made with wine grown dead or
turning sour. The image represents the want of all spirit of piety in
their acts of worship, and the unacceptableness of such worship before
God: which is alleged as a reason for the determination expressed in the
preceding clause, to give Ephraim up to his own ways. “Leave him to
himself,” says God to the Prophet, “his pretended devotions are all
false and hypocritical, I desire none of them.” *Henderson’s* rendering
is new, but seems unsuitable to the text, — “When their carousal is
over, they indulge in lewdness.” What appears to comport best with the
words and with the context, is what is given by *Dathius,* “<span
id="vii.i-p15.4"></span>compotationes eos seduxerunt,” — drinkings have
seduced them. He takes <span id="vii.i-p15.5"></span>סר in a causative
sense. Then the literal version of <span id="vii.i-p15.6"></span>סר סבאם
would be, “Turned *them* aside, or seduced *them,* has their strong
drink.” Drunkenness was ascribed to them in verse 11. If this be the
meaning, then we have in this verse three of the prevailing sins of the
people — drunkenness — fornication, that is idolatry — and bribery.

<span id="vii.i-p16"></span>With regard to the remaining portion of the
verse, both *Newcome* and *Henderson* have taken such liberties in
clipping and in changing the order of the words, that their versions are
wholly inadmissible. Where there is a meaning, and a striking one too,
this liberty is by no means to be allowed. Horsley’s version
substantially agrees with that of Calvin; and it is this, “Given up to
lasciviousness, greedy of gain, (O shame!) are her great men.” The
parethetic expression, “O shame!” had been previously suggested by
*Drusius.* “For a long time,” says the Bishop, “I thought myself
original and single in this way of rendering: but I have the
satisfaction to find, that the learned Drusius was before me in it. He
renders thus,’ — <span id="vii.i-p16.1"></span>Scortando scortati sunt,
amant date (O dedecus) protedctores ejus.’” This is certainly a very
literal rendering of the original, —

<span id="vii.i-p17"></span><span id="vii.i-p17.1"></span> הזנה הזנו  
<span id="vii.i-p17.3"></span>אהבו הבו קלזן מגניה

<span id="vii.i-p18"></span>Wantoning they have become wanton,  
‘Bring ye,’ (O shame!) do her protectors love.

<span id="vii.i-p19"></span> 

<span id="vii.i-p20"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p20.2"></span>[Hosea
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.i-p20.2"></span>,**
*A net expanded over Tabor,* Striking are the words of *Bishop Horsley*
in connection with this passage, — “The toils and nets are whatever, in
the external form of idolatry, was calculated to captivate the minds of
men; magnificent temples, stately altars, images richly adorned, the
gaiety of festivals, the pomp, and in many instances, even the horror of
public rites.”

<span id="vii.i-p21"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p21.2"></span>[Hosea
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#005.md)<span id="vii.i-p21.2"></span>,**
*Thy judgments, etc.,* *Henderson* thinks that judgments here are to be
viewed in the sense of punishments, and that “thy judgments” mean those
alluded to and deserved by Ephraim. That this mode of speaking is not
unusual in Hebrew, is no doubt true. But the word here used, commonly
rendered judgments, is one of very wide meaning. It signifies not only
the sentence pronounced on the criminal, but also the sentence
pronounced by God as to what is right or wrong. The latter is very
frequently its meaning. Moses speaks of statutes and judgments, <span
id="vii.i-p21.3"></span>משפטים, which the Israelites were to “do,” or
observe and keep, (<span id="vii.i-p21.4"></span>[De
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#014)<span id="vii.i-p21.4"></span>..md)
The Psalmist prays God to teach him his judgments, (<span
id="vii.i-p21.5"></span>[Ps
119:108](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#108.md)<span
id="vii.i-p21.5"></span>.) Hence precepts, as Horsley renders it,
suitably express the meaning. Then “thy” means given to thee, revealed
and communicated to thee. The expression, “thy judgments,” admits then
no doubt of either of these two meanings. The question is, which of the
two is the most suitable to the rest of the sentence, and to the
context? To compare inflicted judgments to light going forth, appears
not certainly very appropriate; but when the clear teaching of God’s
word as to what is right, and just, and equitable, is compared to
out-spreading light, there is a striking suitableness. And then the
context seems to favor this view.

<span id="vii.i-p22"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p22.2"></span>[Hosea
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#009.md)<span id="vii.i-p22.2"></span>,**
*By consent,* *etc*., *Newcome, Horsley,* and others, render the line
thus, “A company of priests murder *in* the way to Shechem,” taking
<span id="vii.i-p22.3"></span>שכמה, a shoulder, taken figuratively for
consent, as the name of a place. But by this rendering they change the
order of the words: <span id="vii.i-p22.4"></span>דרך, the way, is
before the verb to murder, and cannot be construed “in the way to
Shechem.” Besides, the following line confirms the rendering of Calvin;
for what they are said to do is <span id="vii.i-p22.5"></span>זמה, a
device, a conceived wickedness, or a concerted scheme, which seems to
imply a consent.

<span id="vii.i-p23"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p23.2"></span>[Hosea
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011.md)<span id="vii.i-p23.2"></span>,**
*Judah also did set a plant for thee* There is much difference in the
meaning attached to this line. The foregoing is certainly its most
literal rendering, except that for “plant” some would substitute
“harvest:” but the word means both. In all other versions there is
something that seems forced. Some then disjoin the next line from this,
and connect it with the first verse of the following chapter, and mainly
because they cannot see its meaning as connected with this. Now it
appears to me, that by this arrangement a confusion is introduced. It
must be borne in mind that this section commences in verse 4, in which
both Ephraim and Judah are mentioned: but, in the next chapter, Israel
or Ephraim is alone spoken of throughout. Hence, to begin the next
chapter by introducing Judah, which is evidently meant by “my people,”
while the whole chapter refers only to Ephraim, is certainly not to
produce order, but rather disorder. The connection of the line with the
preceding one is, in my view, made sufficiently clear by Calvin, — that
while God was restoring, or endeavoring to restore, the captivity, the
dispersed state of his people, (for many of them were taken captives by
the neighboring nations long before their final captivity,) — while God
was doing this, Judah was engaged in setting the plant of idolatry in
the land; and he is said to do this “for thee,” that is, for Ephraim, to
further as it were, and assist Ephraim in his idolatry.

<span id="vii.i-p24"></span>The Prophet is supposed to allude to what is
recorded in <span id="vii.i-p24.1"></span>[2Ch
28](../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#000.md)<span id="vii.i-p24.1"></span>. And
there we see Jewish captives restored, and Ahaz, the king of Judah, was
at the same time introducing idolatry into the land: he was making, as
it were, a large plantation; for he made “molten images,” and
“sacrificed to the gods of Damascus.”

<span id="vii.i-p25"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p25.2"></span>[Hosea
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.i-p25.2"></span>,**
*The watchmen of Ephraim, etc.* The objection to this, because Ephraim
is not in construction in the original with watchman, is not valid; for
the latter word is a participle, and used as a personal noun, as is
often the case in Hebrew. Literally, it is, “He who watcheth Ephraim.”
The rendering of Henderson is far-fetched, and irrelevant, as there is
nothing in the context which justifies it. It is this, — “Ephraim
expecteth help from my God.” To translate <span
id="vii.i-p25.3"></span>צזפה, “expecteth help,” is without any example.
The references, <span id="vii.i-p25.4"></span>[Ps.
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa005.htm#003.md), [Lam.
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#017.md)<span id="vii.i-p25.4"></span>, do
not bear out the meaning. Besides, the common usage in Hebrew is, when a
participle is employed as a verb to express the present time, the
auxiliary verb being understood, that it follows the nominative case,
and does not precede it as here. It is quite clear that the “watchman”
and “the Prophet” is the same, and that he is described “as a snare of
the fowler in all his ways.” The only difficulty is in the words, <span
id="vii.i-p25.5"></span>ען-אלהי, “with my God.” If not construed with
Prophet, as I have proposed in my note, it may be appended to the first
line, and <span id="vii.i-p25.6"></span>עם may be rendered “before,” or,
“in the presence of,” as in <span id="vii.i-p25.7"></span>[1Sa
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#021.md)<span id="vii.i-p25.7"></span>,
where it is said that Samuel grew <span id="vii.i-p25.8"></span>עם-יהוה,
“before Jehovah.” *Grotius* suggests that <span
id="vii.i-p25.9"></span>עם here may be taken for people; and so it may,
for the punctuists alone have made it especially a preposition. Then it
would be, “the people of my God,” a designation of Ephraim according to
God’s adoption and their own profession, notwithstanding their idolatry.
The meaning still would be nearly the same, for the false prophet, as
well as the people, professed God’s name, and claimed to be a Prophet
before God: and by this means especially were the people deluded. Satan
is never so dangerous as when he pretends to be an angel of light — a
servant of God, and an advocate of idolatry — a Prophet in the presence
of God, and a fowler to catch men, and to draw them into superstition.

<span id="vii.i-p26"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p26.2"></span>[Hosea
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md)<span id="vii.i-p26.2"></span>,**
*Judgment grows up, etc.* Though I gave in a note a view of this
sentence different from that of Calvin, yet on looking on the original,
I find that the order of the words favors his view. Rendered according
to the order of the words it is this, —

<span id="vii.i-p27"></span>And germinate like wormwood does judgment on
the furrows of the field.

<span id="vii.i-p28"></span>By Judgment Calvin means religious conduct;
I take it to be the administration of justice; but *Dr. Henderson,* with
*Grotius* and others, considers it to be punishment, inflicted on the
people, which seems not suitable either to the comparison or to the
context. *Newcome’s* explanation is, “In these times of confusion,
judgment has changed its nature, and has become destructive.” The
passage in <span id="vii.i-p28.1"></span>[Am
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#012.md)<span id="vii.i-p28.1"></span>,
seems to determine the meaning here. “<span
id="vii.i-p28.2"></span>Judicium hic accipio pro impia gubernatione
principum Israelis, maximè in jure dicendo: quae judicia, cum deberent
esse salutaria et grata, acerba et amara fiunt et hominibus perniciosa.”
— *Rivetus,* quoted by Poole.

<span id="vii.i-p29"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p29.2"></span>[Hosea
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#009.md)<span id="vii.i-p29.2"></span>,**
*There they stood*. It ought, perhaps, to be, “There they have stood,
(<span id="vii.i-p29.3"></span>steterunt;”) that is, they have continued
the same, perverse and corrupt. *Horsley* says, “They stood;” that is,
the Israelites set themselves in array for the attack: which, in this
connection, seems to have no meaning. *Henderson* considers the
Gibeonites to be meant, “There they remain,” that is, the same in
character as at this day: but this view, no less than the former, seems
foreign to the context.

<span id="vii.i-p30"></span>In the next line *Newcome* and *Boothroyd,*
with several others, following the conjecture of *Hobigant,* without the
countenance of any MS., guided only by a hint given in the Septuagint,
make a considerable alteration. They separate the end of the ninth
verse, and join it to the beginning of the tenth. The dismembered line
and the newly-formed one are thus given, —

<span id="vii.i-p31"></span>“Did not the war overtake them in Gilbeah?  
I came against the sons of iniquity and chastised them.”

<span id="vii.i-p32"></span>The first word in verse 10 is changed; <span
id="vii.i-p32.1"></span>באתי is put for <span
id="vii.i-p32.2"></span>באותי. Both *Horsley* and *Henderson* very
justly reject this emendation.

<span id="vii.i-p33"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p33.2"></span>[Hosea
10:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#015.md)<span id="vii.i-p33.2"></span>,**
*Thus shall Bethel do to you,* *Horsley* gives the same rendering.
*Newcome,* on the mere authority of the Septuagint, changes the whole
sentence, “*Thus shall* it be done unto you, O house of Israel.” No less
frigid and inconsistent with the words in Hebrew is the version of
*Henderson,* “Thus shall he act towards you at Bethel.” The comment of
Calvin shows the remarkably striking import of this sentence.

<span id="vii.i-p34"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p34.2"></span>[Hosea
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.i-p34.2"></span>,**
*To him on high they call them, etc.* *Rivetus,* as quoted in *Poole’s*
Syn., gives a very different rendering of this clause. In commenting on
the Vulgate, which has this version — “<span
id="vii.i-p34.3"></span>Jugum autem impontur eis simul, quod non
auferetur — but a yoke will be laid on them together, which shall not be
taken away,” *Rivetus* says, that nothing opposes this meaning, except
that the Hebrews say that <span id="vii.i-p34.4"></span>על here does not
mean a yoke, but the high one, that is, God. But the same word, without
the <span id="vii.i-p34.5"></span>ו, which it commonly has, when it
means a yoke, occurs in verse 4: and there seems to be a allusion here
to what is said there; as there is in the verb <span
id="vii.i-p34.6"></span>יקרא to what is expressed in verse 2. The yoke
is considered to be that of captivity. God called them by his prophets
to himself, as it is said in the second verse; they turned away from
God, yet God continued his kindness, and when they were distressed, he
raised up the yoke, that is, relieved them: but now, they being bent on
defection, he threatens them with subjugation to a foreign power, and
withdraws every hope of relief. Taking this view, we might render the
words thus, —

<span id="vii.i-p35"></span>*Therefore to the yoke he will call them
together;  
He will not raise* it *up;*

<span id="vii.i-p36"></span>Or, as Rivetus proposes,

<span id="vii.i-p37"></span>None will raise it up.

<span id="vii.i-p38"></span>Not only is this a literal rendering, but it
fits in remarkably with the following as well as with the previous
context. The exclamation which follows naturally flows from this
denunciation of judgment. The version of Newcome is somewhat like this,
but not so literal nor so suitable to the context, —

<span id="vii.i-p39"></span>*And* though *they call on him together
because of the yoke,  
he will not raise* it.

<span id="vii.i-p40"></span> 

<span id="vii.i-p41"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p41.2"></span>[Hos.
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#011.md)<span id="vii.i-p41.2"></span>**,
*After Jehovah shall they walk,* *etc* *Calvin* differs from most, if
not from all, commentators, as to the meaning of these two verses. It is
said that Jehovah “will roar as a lion.” This roaring will cause
trembling, — to whom? Most say, to the children of Israel; but *Calvin*
says, to their enemies. But in order to avoid the evident incongruity of
applying trembling to the Israelites, the meaning of hastening has been
given to the verb <span id="vii.i-p41.3"></span>חרד, which it is said to
have only here and in <span id="vii.i-p41.4"></span>[2Ki
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#013.md)<span id="vii.i-p41.4"></span>,
its general import being that of trembling or shaking with fear. The
Septuagint favors this latter idea, <span
id="vii.i-p41.5"></span>εκστησονται — shall be astounded; and “children
from the west” is rendered <span id="vii.i-p41.6"></span>τεκνα ὐδατων —
children of the waters, or, according to another copy, <span
id="vii.i-p41.7"></span>ὑιοι θαλασσης — sons of the sea. The Israelites
were not thus designated, but their enemies. But no doubt the last
clause has occasioned this mistake, which, according to our version, is,
“I will place them in their houses;” which may be rendered, “I will
cause them to sit still on (that is, the top of roof of) their houses:”
for it is not *in,* but *on,* <span id="vii.i-p41.8"></span>על. The flat
roofs of the east were places to which people in fear would likely
betake themselves.

<span id="vii.i-p42"></span>*Bishop Horsley* has here a beautiful
disquisition on the progress of the Gospel; he takes roaring for
preaching, a singular notion. “The roaring,” he says, “is unquestionably
the sound of the Gospel. Jehovah himself shall roar: the should shall
begin to be uttered by the voice of the incarnate God himself. The first
effect shall be, that children shall come fluttering from the west, a
new race of children, converts of the Gentiles, chiefly from the western
quarters of the world; — afterwards the natural Israel shall hurry from
all the regions of their dispersion, and be settled in their own
dwellings,” etc., etc. Though all this is very fine, it has nothing to
do with this passage. Speaking of this roaring being applied to the
preaching of the Gospel, *Calvin* says, “This and the like are
refinements of which I think the Prophet never thought.

<span id="vii.i-p43"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p43.2"></span>[Hosea
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#012.md)<span id="vii.i-p43.2"></span>,**
*But Judah as yet rules with his God, etc.* Notwithstanding what modern
critics have said on this verse, the rendering of *Calvin,* which as to
the first line is adopted by *Horsley,* seems to most natural, and the
most literal. *Newcome* mangles the whole text, assisted by the
Septuagint, the Syriac, and Arabic versions, and the Vulgate.
*Henderson,* following *Dathius, Boothroyd,* and others, affixes a new
idea to <span id="vii.i-p43.3"></span>רד, supported, as they say, by the
following texts: <span id="vii.i-p43.4"></span>[Jer.
2:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#031.md), [Gen.
27:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#040.md), [Ps.
55:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.i-p43.4"></span>.
There are no other examples, except that the word occurs, as it is
thought, in the form of a noun in <span id="vii.i-p43.5"></span>[Lam.
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam001.htm#007.md), [Lam.
3:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#019.md)<span id="vii.i-p43.5"></span>.
Now, in none of these places is there anything *decisive* in favor of
the meaning attached in the following version, —

<span id="vii.i-p44"></span>“And as for Judah he is still inconstant
with God.”

<span id="vii.i-p45"></span>It is said that the word includes the ideas
of being *unfaithful, rebelling, wandering at large.* Much stronger and
clearer examples must be adduced before this meaning can be received. It
is always suspicious when anything doubtful or far-fetched is brought
forward to explain a text. The meaning of ruling with or before God, as
explained by *Calvin* and by others, such as *Rivetus,* seems quite
satisfactory, and obviates the difficulty felt by *Dathius* and others,
and which obviously induced them to seek a new interpretation.

<span id="vii.i-p46"></span>With regard to the other line, *And together
with the saints he is faithful,* I find no improvement, but otherwise.

<span id="vii.i-p47"></span>*Newcome’s* version of the whole verse is
this, —

<span id="vii.i-p48"></span>*“Ephraim hath compassed me about with
falsehood,  
And the house of Israel and of Judah with deceit;  
*But *hereafter they shall come down a people of God,  
Even a faithful people of saints.”*

<span id="vii.i-p49"></span>*Henderson’s* is the following, —

<span id="vii.i-p50"></span>“Ephraim hath encompassed me with
falsehood,  
And the house of Israel with deceit;  
And as for Judah, he is still inconstant with God,  
Even with the faithful holy ones.”

<span id="vii.i-p51"></span>So various become versions, when once a
license is taken with the text, or with the current meaning of the
words. *Junius* and *Tremelius* agree with *Calvin,* except as to time,
the past tense is adopted. The last two lines are thus given, —

<span id="vii.i-p52"></span>*“*<span id="vii.i-p52.1"></span>*Quando
Jehudah adhuc dominabatur cum* Deo *forti,  
Et cum sanctis fidelis erat.”*

<span id="vii.i-p53"></span>The whole verse, according to this version,
is as follows, —

<span id="vii.i-p54"></span>“Surround me did the Ephraimites with
falsehood,  
And with guile, the house of Israel;  
When Judah as yet ruled with God,  
And with the saints was faithful.”

<span id="vii.i-p55"></span>By referring to past times, the objection as
to the condition of Judah, he being at that time much given to
superstition and idolatry, though still adhering to the outward form of
true worship, is to a great extent removed. But the remarks of *Calvin*
on this point seem sufficient.

<span id="vii.i-p56"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p56.2"></span>[Hosea
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.i-p56.2"></span>,**
*In all my labors, etc.* *Newcome’s* version is very different, he
having been led astray, as usual, by the Septuagint, —

<span id="vii.i-p57"></span>*“All his labors shall not be found*
profitable *unto him,  
*For *the iniquity wherewith he hath sinned.”*

<span id="vii.i-p58"></span>*Horsley’s* rendering is nearly as far from
the Original as this — “All my labors procured not for me what may
expiate iniquity.” *Henderson’s* version is a paraphrase, but materially
agrees with that of *Calvin,* —

<span id="vii.i-p59"></span>“In none of my labors am I chargeable with
guilt.”

<span id="vii.i-p60"></span>What he considers the literal rendering is
this — “With respect to all my efforts, they shall not find attaching to
me iniquity which is sin.” Perhaps the words may admit of a still more
literal rendering — “All my labors shall not be found *to be* an
iniquity to me, that *is* a sin.”

<span id="vii.i-p61"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p61.2"></span>[Hosea
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md)<span id="vii.i-p61.2"></span>,**
*Is there iniquity in Gilead?* There is considerable difficulty
connected with this passage, and, indeed, with the whole of this
chapter, from the eighth verse to the end. The main drift is evidently
what is stated by *Calvin,* and in this most commentators agree. It was
clearly the design of the Prophet, in alluding to Jacob and his history,
to prove the ingratitude and to beat down the pride of Ephraim. But
still, to connect the whole together in a continuous narrative, is no
easy task. On this very line there is a great variety. *Grotius* reads,
“<span id="vii.i-p61.3"></span>Si in Galaade idolum fuit;” *Junius* and
*Tremelius,* “<span id="vii.i-p61.4"></span>An in Gilhade iniquitas?”
*Horsley,* “Was there idolatry in Gilead?” *Newcome,* “Verily, *in*
Gilead *there is* iniquity;” and *Henderson,* “Verily, Gilead is
iniquitous.”

<span id="vii.i-p62"></span>It appears that Gilead was at this time
destroyed; for what is said in <span id="vii.i-p62.1"></span>[2Ki
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029.md)<span id="vii.i-p62.1"></span>,
was evidently previous to the time of Hosea. It is there stated that the
king of Assyria had taken Gilead, with other cities, and carried the
inhabitants captive to Assyria.  <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md)
The reference, then, to Gilead, must have been to its former state.
Gilgal being still in the possession of Israel, its state at that time
is described. This shows that *Grotius* and *Horsley* are more correct
than *Calvin, Newcome,* and *Henderson.* Gilead is evidently introduced
as an instance of the effects of idolatry, and the folly of Israel is
exposed in continuing the same idolatry at Gilgal. That I may attempt to
exhibit the whole passage from verse eighth to the end, in a connected
form, I submit to the reader the following version, —

<span id="vii.i-p64"></span>8. Canaan is he!  <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) In his hand are the balances of deceit;  
He loves to oppress:

<span id="vii.i-p66"></span>9. Yet Ephraim says, “Surely I am become
rich,  
I have found substance for myself;  
In all my labors they will not find against me  
An iniquity that is a sin.”

<span id="vii.i-p67"></span>10. But I, Jehovah, thy God from the land of
Egypt,  
Will yet make thee to dwell in tents,  
As in the days of meeting:  <span id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md)

<span id="vii.i-p69"></span>11. Thus have I spoken by the prophets,  
When I had visions multiplied,  
And by the prophets showed similitudes.

<span id="vii.i-p70"></span>12. If Gilead has been iniquitous,
(literally, iniquity;)  
Surely vain have they become in Gilgal;  
They sacrifice oxen, yea their altars  
Are like the heaps on the furrows of the field.

<span id="vii.i-p71"></span>13. When Jacob fled to the land of Aram,  
Then Israel served for a wife,  
And for a wife he kept sheep;  
By a prophet also did Jehovah bring Israel from Egypt,  
And by a prophet was he preserved.

<span id="vii.i-p72"></span>14. Yet Ephraim has caused the bitterest
provocation:  
But his blood on himself shalt be left,  
And his reproach will his Lord return to him.

<span id="vii.i-p73"></span> 

<span id="vii.i-p74"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p74.2"></span>[Hosea
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.i-p74.2"></span>,**
*Who sacrifices men, etc.* *Henderson,* after mentioning several authors
for and against this rendering, strengthens his own, which agrees with
our common version, by referring to a rule of syntax laid down by
Gesenius; but that rule refers to adjectives and to passive participles,
according to the instances given, and not to participles, as in the
present case, in an active form. The words here are literally “the
sacrificers of men,” which certainly can never mean the men who
sacrifice. The words are not in apposition but *in regimine.* We have in
<span id="vii.i-p74.3"></span>[De
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#003.md)<span id="vii.i-p74.3"></span>,
<span id="vii.i-p74.4"></span>הזבח זבחי, “the sacrificers of the
sacrifice,” a phrase similar to the present.

<span id="vii.i-p75"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p75.2"></span>[Hosea
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md)<span id="vii.i-p75.2"></span>,**
*From the power of the grave would I redeem thee, etc.* The conditional
form is adopted by *Grotius* and others, but disapproved by *Horsley,
Newcome,* and *Henderson.* When we consider what precedes this verse,
and what follows it, the condition seems the most suitable. Then the
expression, “repentance is hid from my eyes,” appears more consistent
with a threatening than with a promise, especially as the threatening is
continued in the next verse. To repent of evil, and not of good, is the
phrase usually found in the Old Testament. It is true that Paul makes
use of the expression with regard to the gifts of God, (<span
id="vii.i-p75.3"></span>[Ro 11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md)<span
id="vii.i-p75.3"></span>,) but the context here seems to favor the other
notion.

<span id="vii.i-p76"></span>**<span id="vii.i-p76.2"></span>[Hosea
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.i-p76.2"></span>,**
*Bring good.* *Horsley* reads, “Accept the good;” *Newcome,* “Let us
receive good;” *Henderson,* “Graciously receive us.”  <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) The words are <span
id="vii.i-p77.2"></span>וקח-טוב, literally, “and receive,” or “bring
good.” The verb means simply to “take’” but then it is used to express
taking for one’s self in the sense of receiving, and taking for another
in the sense of bringing. Naaman said to Elisha, <span
id="vii.i-p77.3"></span>קח נא ברכה, “Take,” or “receive, I pray, a
blessing,” <span id="vii.i-p77.4"></span>[2Ki
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2005.htm#015.md)<span id="vii.i-p77.4"></span>;
and Jacob said to Joseph, <span id="vii.i-p77.5"></span>קחם-נא אלי,
“Take,” or “bring them, I pray, to me,” <span
id="vii.i-p77.6"></span>[Ge 48:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#009.md)<span
id="vii.i-p77.6"></span>. See also <span id="vii.i-p77.7"></span>[Ge
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009.md)<span id="vii.i-p77.7"></span>;
<span id="vii.i-p77.8"></span>[2Ki
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#020.md)<span id="vii.i-p77.8"></span>. So
the meaning may be either that given by *Horsley* or by *Calvin;* and as
the latter is more consonant with this passage, and does not blend in
sense, as the former does, with the next clause in the verse, it ought
to be preferred. But the Bishop’s note must be added, — “*Take away all
iniquity, i.e.,* Take away entirely the sinful principle within us. Take
away the carnal heart of the old Adam. *Create in me a clean heart, O
God, and renew a right spirit within me.* And then, when we are thus
begotten again unto holiness by thy Spirit, *accept the good,* accept as
good, what, so regenerate, we shall be enabled to perform.” All this is
perfectly true; but the former part is not an explanation of the text;
for to *take away sin* does not mean the renewal of the heart, but the
forgiveness of sin. Though they be two gracious acts which go together,
they are yet wholly separate and distinct; and to confound them may lead
to serious mistakes.

<span id="vii.i-p78"></span>The same verb is used at the beginning of
the verse, *Take,* or bring *with you words.* As they were to bring
words of confession and prayer, so God is solicited to *bring good;* and
to bring good very suitably follows the taking away of iniquity; and
then follows the gratitude that is required.

<span id="vii.i-p68"></span> This refers to the meeting or assembling of

<span id="vii.i-p77"></span> The Doctor says, that *Horsely* is wrong in
his philogy in this instance, and adds, that <span

and it is difficult to find one. Let it be adduced, and then the
philogical accurateness of this rendering shall be allowed. The fact is,
that in Hebrew very few words of this kind are taken adverbially: the
language deals very sparingly in adverbs. — *Ed*
