<span id="vi.iii-p1"></span>a translation

<span id="vi.iii-p2"></span>of Calvin’s Version

<span id="vi.iii-p3"></span>of The Prophecies of Obadiah.

<span id="vi.iii.i"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.i-p1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 1.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p3"></span>**1** The vision of Obadiah: Thus saith
the Lord Jehovah against Edom,— A rumor have we heard from Jehovah, And
a messenger to the nations has been sent,—(423) “Arise ye, and we shall
arise against her to battle.”

<span id="vi.iii.i-p4"></span>**2** Lo, small have I set thee among the
nations, Despised greatly wert thou: (425)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p5"></span>**3** The pride of thine heart hath
deceived thee, Who dwellest in the clefts of the rock: “Who shall draw
me down to the ground?”

<span id="vi.iii.i-p6"></span>**4** If thou shouldst rise high as the
eagle, And if among the clouds thou shouldest set thy nest, Thence shall
I draw thee down, saith Jehovah.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p7"></span>**5** Have thieves come to thee, or
night-robbers? How hast thou been reduced to silence? Have they not
stolen what sufficed them? Have vintagers come to thee? Have they not
left some clusters?—

<span id="vi.iii.i-p8"></span>**6** How much sought out have been the
things of Esau, *And* thoroughly searched his hidden places!

<span id="vi.iii.i-p9"></span>**7** To the border have they driven thee,
All the men of thy confederacy; Deceived thee, prevailed against thee,
have they, The men who were at peace with thee; The men who did eat thy
bread Have set a wound under thee:— There is in him no understanding!

<span id="vi.iii.i-p10"></span>**8** Shall I not in that day, saith
Jehovah, Destroy the wise from Edom, And understanding from the mount of
Esau? Yea, broken down shall be thy valiant ones, O Teman,

<span id="vi.iii.i-p11"></span>**9** So that cut off shall be every man,
From the mount of Esau by slaughter.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p12"></span>**10** For the oppression of thy brother
Jacob, Cover thee shall reproach, And thou shalt be cut off forever.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p13"></span>**11** In the day when thou didst stand
on the other side, In the day when aliens took away his substance, And
foreigners entered his gates, And on Jerusalem did cast lots, Even thou
wert as one of them.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p14"></span>**12** But thou shouldest not look on the
day of thy brother, In the day of his alienation; Nor shouldest rejoice
over the children of Judah, In the day of their destruction; Nor speak
with thy mouth proud things, In the day of distress;

<span id="vi.iii.i-p15"></span>**13** Nor shouldest thou enter the gate
of my people, In the day of their destruction; Nor look on him,
especially thou, in his distress, In the day of his destruction; Nor
stretch *thy hand* to his substance, In the day of his destruction:

<span id="vi.iii.i-p16"></span>**14** Nor shouldest thou stand on the
outlets, To destroy those who were escaping; Nor deliver up his remnants
in the day of distress.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p17"></span>**15** Seeing that near is the day of
Jehovah on all nations, As thou hast done, it shall be done to thee, Thy
reward shall be returned on thine own head;

<span id="vi.iii.i-p18"></span>**16** For as ye have drunk on my holy
mountain, Drink shall all nations continually; They shall drink and
drink up; And they shall be as though they never had been.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p19"></span>**17** But in mount Zion shall be
deliverance, And *Zion* shall be holiness; And possess shall the house
of Jacob their own possessions:

<span id="vi.iii.i-p20"></span>**18** The house of Jacob shall be also a
fire, And the house of Joseph a flame, And the house of Esau shall be
chaff; And kindled they shall be among them, and consume them; And no
remnant shall be to the house of Esau; For *thus* hath Jehovah spoken.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p21"></span>**19** They shall also possess the south
of the mount of Esau, And the plain, even *that* of the Philistines; And
they shall possess the fields of Ephraim And the fields of Samaria, And
Benjamin *shall* *possess* Gilead:

<span id="vi.iii.i-p22"></span>**20** And the emigrants of this host of
the children of Israel Shall possess *the land* of the Canaanites to
Zarephath; And the emigrants of Jerusalem, what is in Sepharad, Even the
southern cities: (451)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p23"></span>**21** And ascend shall saviors to mount
Zion, To judge the mount of Esau; And Jehovah’s shall be the kingdom.
