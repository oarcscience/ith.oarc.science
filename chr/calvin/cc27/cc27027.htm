<p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN14"><a name="vii.iii-p1"></A>Addenda to AMOS</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p2"></A><b><a name="vii.iii-p2.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007">Amos 2:7</a><a name="vii.iii-p2.2"></A></b>, <i>Who pant, etc.</i> Our common version is the literal one, which is followed by <i>Henderson,</i> but altered for the worse by <i>Newcome,</i> who was led astray 			 by Hobigant and the Septuagint. Not only are the words inverted, but a change is made in the verb, without the authority of any MS. It is a strong mode of expression to set forth the extreme cruelty and avariciousness of the persons referred to. &#8220;They even begrudged them,&#8221; as Henderson observes, &#8220;the small quantity of dust they had cast on their heads in token of mourning:&#8221; or, as <i>Parkhurst</i> says, They &#8220;<i>longed</i> to see the poor and miserable still more wretched: a most diabolical character surely!&#8221; To cast dust on the head was then customary in seasons of great distress. See <a name="vii.iii-p2.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012">Job 2:12</a><a name="vii.iii-p2.3"></A>; <a name="vii.iii-p2.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#030">Eze 27:30</a><a name="vii.iii-p2.4"></A>; and <a name="vii.iii-p2.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#019">2Sa 13:19</a><a name="vii.iii-p2.5"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p3"></A><b><a name="vii.iii-p3.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#005">Amos 3:5</a><a name="vii.iii-p3.2"></A></b>, <i>Will a bird fall into a snare on the earth without a fowler? etc.</i> <i>Newcome,</i> with whom <i>Henderson</i> materially agrees, renders this verse 			 differently, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent36"><a name="vii.iii-p4"></A><i>&#8220;Can a bird fall into a snare upon the earth, <br> 			 Where no gin </i>is set <i>for him? <br> 			 Will a snare spring from the ground, <br> 			 When it hath not taken anything</i>?<i>&#8221;</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p5"></A>The comparison is more appropriate according to the version of Calvin; and the probability is that it is the right one. The word <a name="vii.iii-p5.1"></A>&#1502;&#1493;&#1511;&#1513;, rendered, &#8220;gin&#8221; by <i>Newcome,</i> as it is in our version, is considered by <i>Henderson</i> as 			 redundant; and this very circumstance creates a suspicion that the passage is not rightly understood. This word is often rendered in our version &#8220;snare,&#8221; but it means more properly the act, ensnaring, than the instrument, snare: and it may be considered here a Hiphil participle &#8212; &#8220;he who ensnares,&#8221; or, &#8220;the ensnarer.&#8221; It is rendered <a name="vii.iii-p5.2"></A>&#7985;&#958;&#949;&#965;&#964;&#951;&#962;, a bird catcher by the Septuagint. Then the two following 			 lines will admit naturally of Calvin&#8217;s rendering, and there will be no need of having recourse to <i>Henderson&#8217;s</i> &#8220;elastic snare,&#8221; or to <i>Adam Clarke&#8217;s</i> &#8220;spring-trap,&#8221; neither of which is, I believe, intended by the word <a name="vii.iii-p5.3"></A>&#1508;&#1495;, which signifies a snare spread out, or an expanded net. See 			 <a name="vii.iii-p5.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#009">Job 18:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005">Ps. 140:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#003">Ps. 142:3</a><a name="vii.iii-p5.4"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p6"></A><b><a name="vii.iii-p6.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#003">Amos 4:3</a><a name="vii.iii-p6.2"></A>, </b><i>And ye shall cast yourselves down from the palace.</i> This difficult line is variously rendered. <i>Dathius</i> renders it, &#8220;To Amenia shall ye be led away;&#8221; <i>Newcome,</i> following <i>Houbigant,</i> who always mends the text, &#8220;And I will cast it forth, and will utterly destroy it;&#8221; <i>Henderson,</i> &#8220;Ye shall be even thrown out of the palace;&#8221; and <i>Horsley,</i> following <i>Parkhurst</i>, &#8220;And ye shall be thrown into the shambles.&#8221; The whole difficulty lies in the word <a name="vii.iii-p6.3"></A>&#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, found only here. The idea of shambles agrees well with the context, in which cows are mentioned. <i>Parkhurst</i>, after <i>Schultens,</i> derives it from <a name="vii.iii-p6.4"></A>&#1492;&#1512;&#1501;, not found in Hebrew as a verb, but it means in Arabic, &#8220;to cut 			 into small pieces.&#8221; Hence as a noun, <a name="vii.iii-p6.5"></A>&#1492;&#1512;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; seems to denote the place in which meat is thus cut. The <a name="vii.iii-p6.6"></A>&#1492;, as <i>Parkhurst</i> observes, is evidently radical, as it is preceded by <a name="vii.iii-p6.7"></A>&#1492; servile. This appears to be the best solution of the difficulty.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p7"></A><b><a name="vii.iii-p7.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005">Amos 4:5</a><a name="vii.iii-p7.2"></A></b>, <i>And burn incense,</i> <i>etc.</i> The word for incense is not in the form of a verb. Both <i>Houbigant</i> and <i>Horsley</i> take it here not a verb but a noun: but their transpositions are by no means necessary. The latter part of the fourth verse, and the whole of this, I would render thus, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent35"><a name="vii.iii-p8"></A>And bring, in the morning, your sacrifices, <br> 			 In the third year, your tithes,</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent36"><a name="vii.iii-p9"></A><i>5. And incense with the leaven of thank-offering, <br> 			 Yea, publish vows, proclaim </i>them; <i><br> 			 For thus ye love </i>to do,<i> O children of Israel, <br> 			 Saith the Lord Jehovah.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p10"></A>&nbsp;</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p11"></A><b><a name="vii.iii-p11.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024">Amos 5:24</a><a name="vii.iii-p11.2"></A>,</b> <i>And run down,</i> <i>etc.</i>,</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent35"><a name="vii.iii-p12"></A>&#8220;But judgment shall come rolling on like waters, <br> 			 And justice like a resistless torrent.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p13"></A>&#8220;That is, the irresistible judgment and justice of God shall come upon those hypocrites like an inundation, and sweep them away like a torrent.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Horsley.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p14"></A><b><a name="vii.iii-p14.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001">Amos 6:1</a><a name="vii.iii-p14.2"></A>, </b><i>which have been renowned,</i> <i>etc.</i> Various are the expositions of this and the following line. <i>Newcome&#8217;s </i>version overleaps the rule of grammar, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent35"><a name="vii.iii-p15"></A>&#8220;That are named after the chief of the nations, <br> 			 And to them the house of Israel resort.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p16"></A>The explanation is this, &#8212; &#8220;They call themselves, not after their religious ancestors, but after the chief of the idolatrous nations, with whom they intermarry contrary to their law.&#8221; How foreign to everything in the context is this! <i>Henderson&#8217;s </i>rendering is more like a version of the original, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent35"><a name="vii.iii-p17"></A>&#8220;The distinguished men of the first of nations, <br> 			 To whom the house of Israel come.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p18"></A>He considers that the chief persons of the Hebrew nation are here spoken of, to whom the house of Israel, the community, came for judgment: and this has little to do with the context. <i>Horsley</i> seems to have given the most literal version, and the most suitable to this place, &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent35"><a name="vii.iii-p19"></A>&#8220;Marking out the first of the nations, <br> 			 Go unto them, O house of Israel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p20"></A>And then the Prophet mentions in the next who these nations were, &#8220;Pass over,&#8221; he says, &#8220;into Calneh,&#8221; etc. So that this distich is connected with the following verses. For <a name="vii.iii-p20.1"></A>&#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;, one copy of Kennicott has <a name="vii.iii-p20.2"></A>&#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1493;, 			 &#8220;Mark ye out,&#8221; or, notice; this would make the line complete. Though the Septuagint here goes much astray, yet it gives the verb used here in the third person plural: and that person in Hebrew is the same as the second person plural of the imperative.</p>  		  
<p><a name="vii.iii-p21"></A><b><a name="vii.iii-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012">Amos 9:12</a><a name="vii.iii-p21.2"></A>, </b><i>That possess they may,</i> <i>etc</i>. Both this and the preceding verse are quoted, in <a name="vii.iii-p21.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016">Acts 15:16</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017">17</a><a name="vii.iii-p21.3"></A>, not literally, but 			 mainly from the Septuagint, which differs considerably in words, but not in sense, from the Hebrew. <i>Newcome, </i>with the view of producing a verbal agreement, has changed and altered the Hebrew text without the authority of a single MS. This is rightly disapproved both by <i>Adam Clarke</i> and <i>Henderson. </i>The former says, &#8220;We must dismiss all these 			 conjectural emendations, and take the Hebrew text as we find it. That it speaks of the <i>conversion of the Jews</i> in gospel times, we have the authority of the New Testament; and if we cannot make the <i>words</i>, as they stand there, <i>entirely</i> to agree with the words here, the <i>subject</i> is not affected by 			 it.&#8221;</p>
