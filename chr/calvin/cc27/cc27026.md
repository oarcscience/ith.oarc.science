<span id="vii.ii-p1"></span>ADDenda to Joel

<span id="vii.ii-p2"></span>**<span id="vii.ii-p2.2"></span>[Joel
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004.md)<span id="vii.ii-p2.2"></span>,**
*The residue of the locusts,* *etc.* “A comparison,” says Dr. Henderson,
“of the different passages in which these names occur, renders it more
than probable that they are here employed by the Prophet, not with any
reference to the species into which the locusts may be scientifically
divided, but to designate four successive swarms, according to certain
destructive qualities, by which, as a genus of insects, they are
distinguished, and thereby to heighten the terror which this description
was intended to produce.”

<span id="vii.ii-p3"></span>*Mercerius,* as quoted in Poli Syn., tells
us, that almost all divines, both ancient and modern, understood this
narrative of the locusts allegorically; and it appears that, according
to some, they designate the four incursions of the Chaldeans into the
land, that is, by Tiglathpileser, Shalmanezer, Sennacherib, and
Nebuchadnezzar; or, according to Cyril, by Shalmanezer, Nebuchadnezzar,
Antiochus, and the Romans; or, according to Jerome, the four empires
which successively ruled over the Jews, the first locust representing
the Chaldeans, — the second, the Medes and Persians, — the third, the
Macedonians, — and the fourth, the Romans. But these are hallucinations
and not expositions. Much more appropriate is the opinion stated and
approved by *Henderson,* that in this chapter Joel describes a
devastation of the country by natural locusts; and that in the second he
predicts a devastation by the Assyrians in a language highly
metaphorical, borrowed in some measure from the scene described here;
and this is exactly the view of *Calvin.*

<span id="vii.ii-p4"></span>**<span id="vii.ii-p4.2"></span>[Joel
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#012.md)<span id="vii.ii-p4.2"></span>,**
*But even now,* etc. Our version, “Therefor also now,” is not so
emphatical as that of *Calvin.* The full meaning has been perceived by
*Newcome,* “Yet even now,” though omitted by *Henderson,* whose
rendering is, “Now therefore,” which comes short of our common version.

<span id="vii.ii-p5"></span>**<span id="vii.ii-p5.2"></span>[Joel
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#013.md)<span id="vii.ii-p5.2"></span>,**
*For he is propitious,* etc. It is of great importance that this
declaration of what God is should be correctly rendered. *Newcome’s*
version is the same with our common translation. Henderson’s is
different; it is this, —

<span id="vii.ii-p6"></span>“For he is pitiful and compassionate,  
Long-suffering and of great mercy,  
And repenteth of the evil.”

<span id="vii.ii-p7"></span>The first, <span
id="vii.ii-p7.1"></span>חנון, is not “pitiful,” but gracious,
benevolent, propitious, gratuitously kind, favorable to the undeserving;
it comes from <span id="vii.ii-p7.2"></span>חן, to show favor or
kindness; and the last letter being doubled, it may be rendered, very
kind, or very gracious. The second is <span
id="vii.ii-p7.3"></span>רחום, which more properly means pitiful, but
rightly rendered, “compassionate,” rather than “merciful,” as in our
version. The third, <span id="vii.ii-p7.4"></span>ארך אפים, is better
expressed by “slow to anger,” or to wrath, than by “long-suffering.” The
fourth is, <span id="vii.ii-p7.5"></span>רב-חסד, much, or abundant in
goodness: the word <span id="vii.ii-p7.6"></span>חסד is sometimes
rendered mercy, but not properly; it means overflowing goodness, or
exuberant benevolence. *Adam Clarke* has given an accurate description
of these terms: — *“gracious* — good and benevolent in his own nature, —
*merciful* — pitying and forgiving, — *slow to anger* — not easily
provoked to punish, — *of great kindness* — exuberant goodness to all
them who return to him.”

<span id="vii.ii-p8"></span>**<span id="vii.ii-p8.2"></span>[Joel
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#014.md)<span id="vii.ii-p8.2"></span>**,
*who knows,* *etc.* *Henderson* has been very felicitous in his version
of this line, —

<span id="vii.ii-p9"></span>“Who knoweth? He may turn and repent.”

<span id="vii.ii-p10"></span>It is an instance of the potential or
subjunctive meaning of the future tense in Hebrew; which is the case
probably much oftener than what is generally thought. But not so
felicitous is the rendering of <span id="vii.ii-p10.1"></span>חוסה, in
verse 17, by “Have pity.” The meaning of the verb is, no doubt to spare,
as it is rendered, I believe, uniformly in our version. It may be seen
in connection with two other verbs, which include the ideas of pity and
sympathy, in <span id="vii.ii-p10.2"></span>[Jer.
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer013.htm#014.md), [Jer.
21:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.ii-p10.2"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p11"></span>**<span id="vii.ii-p11.2"></span>[Joel
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#020.md)<span id="vii.ii-p11.2"></span>**,
*For high hath he exalted himself to do his purpose.* Both *Newcome* and
*Henderson* retain the common version, only the former reads, “Though,”
instead of “because he hath done great things.” <span
id="vii.ii-p11.3"></span>כי הגדיל לעשות, “For he made himself great in
(or, by) doing,” or, “Became great in doing.” It is the greatness of the
doer that is set forth, rather than of the things done. *Henderson* very
justly observes, that those words “convey the idea of moral agency, and
can with no propriety be interpreted of the locusts.” Exactly the same
words are adopted in the next verse in reference to God.

<span id="vii.ii-p12"></span>**<span id="vii.ii-p12.2"></span>[Joel
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#025.md)<span id="vii.ii-p12.2"></span>,**
*My great army,* *etc.* *Newcome* says, “We have here a key to the grand
and beautiful description which runs through these two chapters.” He
considered that the Prophet is to be understood throughout “as
foretelling a plague of locusts.” But this can be no key to such an
interpretation, for what is said in this verse coalesces much better
with the other view. On the supposition that there *had* been locusts,
as related in the first chapter, and that the Prophet threatens a
heavier judgment in this, which could only be prevented by repentance,
to which he exhorts them, it appears most appropriate for him to say,
that not only “the Northlander,” of whose invasion he had spoken, would
be driven away and destroyed, but that also the devastations already
produced by the locusts would be repaired. So far then is this verse
from being a key to the proposed interpretation, that it is much more
suitable to the other.

<span id="vii.ii-p13"></span>**<span id="vii.ii-p13.2"></span>[Joel
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#030.md)<span id="vii.ii-p13.2"></span>,**
*And I will set prodigies,* *etc.* *Calvin* extends the range of these
prodigies beyond what most commentators do. They are viewed by most as
those prodigies, recorded even by the historian Josephus, which preceded
the overthrow of the city and the temple by the Romans, when the whole
kingdom, in a civil and ecclesiastical sense, was completely abolished.
*The day of the Lord,* as mentioned here, has therefore been regarded as
the day or time when this awful calamity happened to the Jews: but
*Calvin* regards it as the day of final judgment. There is no doubt much
truth in what he says about prodigies or awful judgments ever
accompanying the gospel, not as its effects, but as visitations for
unbelief, and willful and malicious opposition to it. There is much in
the history of the world in confirmation of what he advances. The
determinate suppression of the gospel by those who had opportunity of
knowing it, or the evident depravation of it either by the influence of
infidelity or of superstition, have often been visited in this world
with awful judgments, such as wars and political disturbances.
