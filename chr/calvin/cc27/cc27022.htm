<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p3"></A><b>1 </b>The words of Amos, who was among the shepherds at Tekos, which he saw concerning Israel, in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake; and he said,&#8212;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p4"></A><b>2 </b>Jehovah from Zion will roar, And from Jerusalem will he utter his voice; And perish shall the habitations of shepherds, And wither shall the top of Carmel.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,&#8212; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not be propitious to it; (157) Because they have threshed Gilead with iron wains:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p6"></A><b>4 </b>And I will send fire into the house of Hazael, And it shall devour the palaces of Benhadad;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And I will break in pieces the bar of Damascus, And cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, And the holder of the scepter from the house of Eden; And removed shall be the people of Syria to Kir, saith Jehovah.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,&#8212; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not be propitious to it; For they carried away a complete captivity, To shut them up in Edom:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p9"></A><b>7 </b>And I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, And it shall devour its palaces;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And I will cut off the inhabitant from Azotus, And the holder of the scepter from Ascalon; And I will turn my hand against Ekron, And perish shall the remnants of the Philistines, Saith the Lord Jehovah.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,&#8212; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not be propitious to it; For they have shut up a complete captivity in Edom, And have not remembered the covenant of brethren:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p12"></A><b>10 </b>And I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, And it shall devour its palaces.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p13"></A><b>11 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,&#8212; For three transgressions of Edom, and for four, I will not be propitious to it; For he pursued with the sword his own brother, And destroyed his own compassions; And raged continually has his anger, And his wrath has he kept perpetually:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p14"></A><b>12 </b>And I will send a fire on Teman, And it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p15"></A><b>13 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,&#8212; For three transgressions of the children o Ammon, and for four, I will not be propitious to him; For they have rent the pregnant women of Gilead, That they might extend their own borders:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p16"></A><b>14 </b>And I will kindle a fire on the wall of Rabbah, And it shall devour its palaces, With clamor in the day of battle, With whirlwind in the day of tempest;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.i-p17"></A><b>15 </b>And pass shall its king into captivity, He and his princes together, saith Jehovah.</p>  <a name="vi.ii.ii"></A>

<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p3"></A><b>1 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,&#8212; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not be propitious to him; For he burnt the bones of the king of Edom into ashes:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p4"></A><b>2 </b>And I will send a fire on Moab, And it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth; And die in a tumult shall Moab, With shouting, at the sound of the trumpet;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>And I will cut off the judge from the midst of him, And with him all his princes will I slay, saith Jehovah.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,&#8212; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not be propitious to him; For they have despised the law of Jehovah, And his statutes have they not kept; And to go astray have their lies made them, After which their fathers walked:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>And I will send a fire on Judah, And it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,&#8212; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not be propitious to him; For they have sold the just for silver, and the poor for shoes;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>Panting for the dust of the earth on the head of the needy, They turn aside the way of the miserable; The son and his father enter in into the <i>same</i> maid, So that they profane my holy name;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>And on pledged garments they lie near every altar, And the wine of the condemned they drink In the house of their god.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Yet I exterminated the Amorite before their face, Whose tallness was like the tallness of cedars, And who was strong like the oak; And I destroyed his fruit above and his root beneath;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p12"></A><b>10 </b>And I brought you up from the land of Egypt, And led you in the desert forty years, That you might possess the land of the Amorite;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p13"></A><b>11 </b>And I raised up Prophets from your sons, And from your youths, Nazarites;&#8212; Have I not done all this, O children of Israel, saith Jehovah:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>But to the Nazarites have ye quaffed wine; And on my Prophets have ye laid a command, Saying, &#8220;Ye shall not prophesy.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="vi.ii.ii-p17"></A><b>15 </b>And the holder of the bow shall not stand, And the swift on foot shall not escape, Nor shall he who mounts a horse save his life;</p>

<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p5"></A><b>3 </b>Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p6"></A><b>4 </b>Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? Will a young lion roar in his den, when nothing is taken?</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p7"></A><b>5 </b>Will a bird fall into a snare on the ground without a fowler? Will a fowler take up his snare from the ground before he catches?</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p8"></A><b>6 </b>Shall a trumpet sound in a city, and the people tremble not? Shall there be an evil in a city, which Jehovah hath not done?</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p9"></A><b>7 </b>For nothing will the Lord Jehovah do, Except he has revealed his secret to his servants the Prophets.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p10"></A><b>8 </b>The lion hath roared, who would not fear? The Lord Jehovah hath spoken, who would not prophesy?</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p11"></A><b>9 </b>Publish in the palaces of Ashdod, And in the palaces of the land of Egypt, and say,&#8212; &#8220;Assemble ye on the mountains of Samaria, &#8220;And see the great tumults within it, &#8220;And the oppressions in the midst of it.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="vi.ii.iii-p14"></A><b>12 </b>Thus saith Jehovah,&#8212; As when a shepherd snatches from the mouth of a lion Two legs and the extreme part of the ear, So shall be rescued the children of Israel, Who dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, And in Damascus on a couch.</p>

<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p8"></A><b>6 </b>But I even gave you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, And want of bread in all your borders; Yet ye turned not to me, saith Jehovah:</p>  			 
<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p9"></A><b>7 </b>I also withheld from you the rain, When as yet there were three months to the harvest; And I rained on one city, And on another city I made it not to rain; One part was rained upon, And the part where it rained not dried up;</p>

<p><a name="vi.ii.iv-p13"></A><b>11 </b>I overthrew you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, And ye were as a brand snatched from the burning; Yet ye turned not to me, saith Jehovah.</p>
