<p><a name="iv.vii.ii-p10"></A><a name="iv.vii.ii-p10.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.ii-p11"></A>Amos shows in this chapter that God had already often deferred the punishments which he had yet determined to inflict on the people; and thus he reminds the Israelites of their perverseness, inasmuch as they had abused the forbearance of God, and repented not after a long lapse of time: for God had suspended his judgments for this end &#8212; that they might willingly return to the right way, as he commonly allures men by his kindness, 				provided they be teachable. Since then this forbearance of God had been without fruit, Amos reproves the Israelites, though he had also another object in view: for ungodly men, we know, when God spares them and does not immediately indict the punishments they deserve, laugh at them, and harden themselves for the future, so that they fear nothing; and when the Lord threatens, and does not instantly execute his vengeance, they then especially think that all threatening are mere bugbears; and 				therefore they harden their minds in security and think that they can with impunity trifle with God. Inasmuch then as this obstinacy prevailed among the Israelites, the Prophet here shows in various ways, that in vain they gloried, and thus securely despised the judgment of God; for though the Lord for a time had spared them, yet the final vengeance was not far distant. This is the sum of the whole: but such expression must be considered in its order.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.ii-p12"></A><i>A vision,</i> he says, had been <i>shown</i> to him by the Lord; and the vision was, that God himself had <i>formed locusts. 				</i>Yet some think <a name="iv.vii.ii-p12.1"></A>&#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512;, <i>iutsar,</i> to be a noun, and render it, creation; others, a swarm or a troop. But these are forced expositions. The Lord then, I doubt not, formed locusts in the Prophet&#8217;s presence, which devoured all the grass. He therefore says, <i>when the 				grass began to grow,</i> that is, <i>after the cuttings of the king</i>  Here also expounders vary: some think that the shearings of the king are referred to, when the king had sheared his sheep. Others regard it as the mowing of hay; and they say, that the best grass was then cut for the use of the king, that he might feed his 				horses and his cattle. But these conjectures have nothing well-founded in them. I therefore doubt not, but the Prophet here calls that a royal cutting, when by a public order they began to cut their meadows. It is indeed credible that there was then some rule: as with us, no one begins the vintage at his own will, but a certain regular time is observed; so those cuttings, which were publicly done, were called royal; as the king&#8217;s highway is called that which is public. But yet the Prophet, I 				think, refers under this figurative expression to the previous calamities, by which the people had been already reduced as to their number.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.ii-p13"></A><a name="iv.vii.ii-p13.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.ii-p14"></A>But we must supply this prophecy or vision to its proper time. I doubt not, and I think that I can gather this from certain considerations, that the Prophet here compares the time which had preceded the reign of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, with the prosperous time which followed. For when Jeroboam the Second began to reign, the kingdom was laid waste, partly by hostile incursions, and partly by drought and heat, by 				inclement weather, or by pestilence. Since then the condition of the people, as sacred history relates, was most miserable, hence the Prophet says, that locusts had been shown to him, which devoured all the grass and standing corn: for he not only says, that locusts were formed, but also that they devoured the grass, so that nothing remained, <i>When they had finished,</i> he 				says, <i>to eat the grass of the earth, then I said, Lord Jehovah,</i> <i>etc.</i> Thus then the Prophet shows that sure tokens of God&#8217;s wrath had then already appeared, and that the people had in part been already afflicted, but yet that God had afterwards given them time for repentance.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.ii-p15"></A>Now by locusts I understand a moderate kind of punishment. We have seen elsewhere (<a name="iv.vii.ii-p15.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#004">Joe 1:4</a><a name="iv.vii.ii-p15.1"></A>) that the country had been then nearly consumed by the locusts and the cankerworms, and the like pests. But in this place the Prophet metaphorically designates hostile invasions, which had not immediately laid waste the whole country but in some measure desolated 				it. This was indeed manifest to all, but few viewed it as the judgment of God, as also the Lord complains, that the perverse regard not the hand of the smiter, (<a name="iv.vii.ii-p15.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003">Isa. 10:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#000">Isa. 4:0</a><a name="iv.vii.ii-p15.2"></A>) Though then the Israelites saw their land consumed, they did not think that God was displeased with them; for ungodly men do not willingly examine themselves nor raise their eyes to heaven, when the Lord chastises 				them: for they would grow, as it were, stupid in their calamities rather than set before themselves the judgment of God, that they may be seriously led to repentance: this they naturally shun almost all. Hence the Prophet says that this was especially shown to him. The calamity then was known to all, and evident before the eyes of the people; but the Prophet alone, by a vision, understood that God in this manner punished the sins of the people: at the same time, the special object of the vision 				was, &#8212; to make the Israelites to know that the hand of God was withheld, as it were, in the middle of its work. They had seen the enemies coming, they had felt many evils; but they thought that the enemies retreated either through good fortune or some other means. They did not consider that God had spared them, which was the main thing. It was therefore shown to the prophet in a vision, that God spared his people, though he had resolved to destroy the whole land.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.ii-p16"></A>And the Prophet expressly declares, that God had been pacified through his intercession and prayer: hence appears very clearly what I have already referred to, that is, that the Prophet condemns the unbelieving for having perversely trifled with God; for they regarded the threatening which they had heard from the mouth of Amos and of others as jests. Whence was this? Because God had spared them. The Prophet shows how this took place; 				&#8220;The Lord,&#8221; he says, &#8220;had at first resolved to destroy you, but yet he waits for you, and therefore suspends his extreme vengeance, that by his kindness he may allure you to himself; and this has been done through my prayers: for though ye think me to be adverse to you, as I am constrained daily to threaten you, and as a heavenly herald to denounce war on you; I yet feel compassion for you, and wish you to be saved. There is, therefore, no reason for you to think that I am influenced by hatred 				or by cruelty, when I address you with so much severity: this I do necessarily on account of my office; but I am still concerned and solicitous for your safety; and of this the Lord is a witness, and the vision I now declare to you.&#8221; We now see that God&#8217;s servants had so ruled and moderated their feelings, that pity did not prevent them from being severe whenever their calling so required; and also, that this severity did not obliterate from their minds the feelings of compassion. Amos, as we 				have already seen, severely inveighed against the people, sharply reproved their vices, and daily summoned irreclaimable men to the tribune it of God: as he was so vehemently indignant on account at their vices, and as he so sharply threatened them, he might have appeared to have forgotten all compassion; but this place shows that he had not yet divested himself of pity, though he faithfully discharged his office, and was not diverted from his purpose, when he saw that he had to do with wicked 				and obstinate men. He was therefore severe, because God so commanded him; it was what his calling required; but at the same time he pitied the people.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.ii-p17"></A>Let then all teachers in the Church learn to put on these two feelings &#8212; to be vehemently indignant whenever they see the worship of God profaned, to burn with zeal for God, and to show that severity which appeared in all the Prophets, whenever due order decays, &#8212; and at the same time to sympathize with miserable men, whom they see rushing headlong into destruction, and to bewail their madness, and to interpose with God as much as is in 				them; in such a way, however that their compassion render them not slothful or indifferent, so as to be indulgent to the sins of men. Indeed, the temper of mind which I have mentioned ought to be possessed, so that they may go forth as suppliants before God, and implore pardon for miserable and wretched men: but when they come to the people, in their new character, that they may be severe and rigid, let them remember by whom they are sent and with what commands, let them know that they are the 				ministers of God, who is the judge of the world, and ought not therefore to spare the people: this then is to be attended to by us.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.ii-p18"></A>Now as to the word <i>repent,</i> as applied to God, let us know, as it has been elsewhere stated, that God changes not his purpose so as to retract what he has once determined. He indeed knew what he would do before he showed the vision to his Prophet Amos: but he accommodates himself to the measure of men&#8217;s understanding, when he mentions such changes. It was then the eternal 				purpose of God, to threaten the people, to show tokens of his displeasure, and yet to suspend for a time his vengeance, that their perverseness might be the more inexcusable. But in the meantime, as this was without advantage, he sets forth another thing &#8212; that he was already armed to execute his vengeance. God then does not relate what he had decreed, but what the Israelites deserved, and what punishment or reward was due to them. When, therefore, God begins to inflict punishment on sinners, 				it is as though he intended to execute fully his vengeance; he however forms a purpose in himself, but that is hid from us. As soon then as he lifts up his finger, we ought to regard it as owing to his mercy, that we are not instantly reduced to nothing; when it so happens, it is as though he changed his purpose, or as though he withheld his hand. This then ought to be borne in mind, when the prophet says, that God created locusts to devour all the grass, but that he suppliantly entreated God 				to put an end to this calamity. He then adds, that it repented God, not that there was any change of mind in God, but because God suddenly and beyond hope suspended the vengeance which was near at hand. <i>It shall not</i> then <i>be</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.ii-p19"></A>With regard to the clause, <i>Be propitious, I pray; how will Jacob rise up,</i> or <i>who will raise up Jacob?</i> it appears that the Prophet saw no other remedy, except the Lord, according to his infinite goodness, forgave the people, and hence he prays for pardon. 				In the meantime, he shows that he prayed for the Church, &#8220;Lord,&#8221; he says, &#8220;thy hand does not now pursue strangers, but an elect people, thy peculiar possession:&#8221; for by the name, <i>Jacob,</i> the Prophet extols the covenant which God made with Abraham and the Patriarchs; as though he said, &#8220;O God, wilt thou be inexorable towards the people whom thou hast chosen and adopted, of whom thou art the Father? Remember that they are neither Babylonians, nor 				Egyptians, nor Assyrians, but a royal priesthood, and thy holy and peculiar people.&#8221; And there is nothing that inclines God more to mercy than the recollection of his gratuitous covenant, as we have elsewhere seen.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.ii-p20"></A>He then says, that Jacob was <i>small.</i> He does not allege the worthiness of Jacob, or adduce any proof of excellency, but says that he was small; as though he said, &#8220;O Lord, thou drawest forth now thy power against miserable creatures, who are already enfeebled enough&#8221; for he calls him <i>small,</i> because he had been worn out by many calamities: and hence I said, that reference is here made to that miserable time, of which 				Scripture records, when it declares that the free as well as the captive were reduced to extreme distress, before Jeroboam the second began to reign. Then indeed God restored his people; but short was that favor; for immediately after the death of king Jeroboam, a sedition arose, which proved ruinous to the whole kingdom: his son Zachariah, as it is well known, was slain by Shallum, (<a name="iv.vii.ii-p20.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#008">2Ki 15:8-10</a><a name="iv.vii.ii-p20.1"></A>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.ii-p21"></A><i>How</i> then <i>will Jacob rise up?</i> Some take the verb <a name="iv.vii.ii-p21.1"></A>&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;, <i>ikum, </i>  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">48</FONT></A>
 				 in a transitive sense, &#8220;Who will raise him up?&#8221; but others think it to be a neuter verb, &#8220;How will Jacob rise up?&#8221; that is, by what means will Jacob rise up? as <a name="iv.vii.ii-p22.4"></A>&#1502;&#1497;, <i>mi,</i> may be taken to mean, how, or by what means: How then will Jacob rise up? But this difference has little to do with the main point It is 				then enough to say, that the Prophet here speaks of the weakness of the people, that on this account God might be more ready to forgive them. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.vii.iii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption18"><a name="iv.vii.iii-p1"></A><a name="iv.vii.iii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#004">Amos 7:4-6</a><a name="iv.vii.iii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p2"></A><b>4.</b> Thus hath the Lord God shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord God called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p3"></A><b>4. </b>Sic ostendit mihi Dominus Jehova: et ecce vocans ad disceptandum in igne Dominus Jehova, et consumpsit (aut, voravit) abyssum magnam (et consumpta fuit possessio) (alii <a name="iv.vii.iii-p3.1"></A>&#1495;&#1500;&#1511; vertunt partem agri; sed malo accipere pro tota possessione.</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p4"></A><b>5.</b> Then said I, O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he <i>is</i> small.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p5"></A><b>5. </b>Et dixi, Adonai Jehova, cessa, obsecro; quis (hoc est, quomodo) consurget Jacob? (vel, quis attollet, ut prius dictum est;) quia parvus est.</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p6"></A><b>6.</b> The Lord repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord God.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p7"></A><b>6.</b> Poenituit Jehova super hoc; Etiam hoc non erit, dicit Dominus Jehova.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p8"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p9"></A><a name="iv.vii.iii-p9.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p10"></A>The Prophet shows that God had not once only spared the people, but that when he was again prepared for vengeance, he still willingly deferred it, that, if possible, the people might willingly recover themselves: but as all were unhealable, this forbearance of God produced no fruit. Now as to the words of the Prophet, we see that a heavier punishment is designated by the similitude of fire, than by what he said before when he spoke of 				locusts. We stated that by locusts is to be understood ordinarily a moderate punishment, one not so dreadful at first sight. For though the want and famine introduced by locusts, when they consume all kinds of fruit, are most grievous evils; yet fire sometimes strikes people with much greater dread. Hence the Prophet shows by mentioning fire, that God had become very indignant, having seen that the people had hardened themselves and could not be reformed by common and usual remedies. The Lord&#8217;s 				usual mode of proceeding, as he declares everywhere in Scriptures is this: At first he tries to find whether men are capable of being healed, and applies not the most grievous punishment, but such as may be endured; but when he perceives in sinners hardness and obstinacy, he doubles and trebles the punishment, yea, as he says by Moses, he increases his judgments sevenfold (<a name="iv.vii.iii-p10.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#025">De 28:25</a><a name="iv.vii.iii-p10.1"></A>.) Such then 				was the manner which Amos now records; for God at first created the locusts, and then he kindled a fire, which consumed the great deep, and devoured their possession.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p11"></A>The point, denoting a participial form in the word here used, shows that they are mistaken who render <a name="iv.vii.iii-p11.1"></A>&#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512;, <i>iutsar,</i> creation, of which we have spoken before; for the point here corresponds with that in <a name="iv.vii.iii-p11.2"></A>&#1497;&#1493;&#1510;&#1512;, <i>iutsar, </i>  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A>
 				. In both places the Lord shows himself to be the author of punishment, which is wont to be ascribed to chance; for men imagine that evils proceed from something else rather than from God. Hence it was necessary for this to be distinctly expressed, as the Prophet does also, when he says that locusts had been created by God, and that fire had been kindled by him.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p13"></A>God then <i>called to contend by fire.</i> It was not without a design that the Prophet uses the verb <a name="iv.vii.iii-p13.1"></A>&#1512;&#1493;&#1489;, <i>rub</i>, which yet expositors have not duly weighed. For he indirectly 				condemns the hardness of the people, inasmuch as the Lord had already not only chastised the vices of the people, but had also contended with men depraved and obstinate: as when no justice can be obtained, a litigation becomes necessary; so the Prophet says here, that God was coming prepared with fire, to contend with the stubbornness of the people. <i>The great deep,</i> he says, 				<i>was consumed by this fire</i>. Hence what I have already said becomes more evident, &#8212; that a more dreadful punishment is here described than in the first vision. The locusts devoured the grass only but the fire penetrates into the utmost deep; it consumes and destroys not only the surface of the earth, but burns up the very roots, yea, it descends to the center and consumes the whole earth. They who render <a name="iv.vii.iii-p13.2"></A>&#1495;&#1500;&#1511;, <i>chelak,</i> a part, do not sufficiently attend to the design of the Prophet, for he concludes that the surface of the earth had been laid waste, because the very gulfs had not escaped the burning. And when the fire reaches to the very bowels of the earth, how could their possession stand, which was also exposed to the heat of the sun? We see how the earth is burnt up by 				heat, when the sun is scorching at Midsummer. We now perceive the Prophet&#8217;s design.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p14"></A><a name="iv.vii.iii-p14.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iii-p15"></A>He adds, that God was again pacified. We must ever bear in mind the object he had in view; for ungodly men thought the Prophets to be liars, whenever God did not immediately execute the vengeance he had denounced: but Amos here reminds them, that when God defers punishment, he does not in vain threaten, but waits for men to repent; and that if they still go on in abusing his patience, they will have at last to feel how dreadful is the 				vengeance which awaits all those who thus pervert the goodness of God, who hear not God inviting them so kindly to himself. This is the meaning. It follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.vii.iv"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption18"><a name="iv.vii.iv-p1"></A><a name="iv.vii.iv-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#007">Amos 7:7-9</a><a name="iv.vii.iv-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.vii.iv-p2"></A><b>7.</b> Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall <i>made</i> by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.vii.iv-p3"></A><b>7. </b>Sic ostendit mihi: et ecce Dominus stabat (stans) super murum perpendiculi, et in manu ejus perpendiculum.</p>

<p><a name="iv.vii.iv-p10"></A>This vision opens more clearly to us what the Prophet meant before, and what was the object of his doctrine: his intention was to show the people that what they had gained by their obstinacy was only to render God implacable, and to cause him not to spare them any longer, as he had hitherto done. The meaning is, &#8212; &#8220;God has hitherto borne with you according to his own goodness, promise not to yourselves that he will ever deal in the same 				manner with you; for your contumacy and waywardness has provoked him. As he sees you to be beyond measure obstinate, he must now necessarily execute on you final vengeance. There is therefore now no forgiveness provided for you; but as ye are incurable, so the Lord on his part will remain unchangeable in the rigor of his judgment, and will by no means turn to mercy.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iv-p11"></A>Interpreters explain this vision in various ways, and refinedly philosophize on the word,<i> plumbline;</i> and yet frigid are almost all their refinements. Were I disposed plausibly to handle this passage, I would say, that the plumbline is the law of God; for it prescribed to his people a regular order of things, which might serve as a plumbline; inasmuch as all things were directed according to the best rule. I might speak thus; but I 				am not disposed to refine in this manner; for I doubt not but that God meant only that this would be the last measuring; for he would punish his people without any remission and without any delay. We now apprehend the Prophet&#8217;s meaning: but all this will become more evident from the words of the passage.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iv-p12"></A><i>Thus he showed to me; and, behold, the Lord stood on a wall of a plumbline.</i> The wall of a plumbline he calls that which had been formed by rule, as though he had said that it was a wall by a plumbline. God then stood on a plumbline-wall, and <i>a plumbline,</i> he says, <i>was in his hand</i>  False then is what some interpreters say, that a plumbline was cast away by God, because he would no more perform the office of a mason in ruling his people. This is frivolous; for the Prophet testifies here expressly that a plumbline was in the hand of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iv-p13"></A><a name="iv.vii.iv-p13.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iv-p14"></A>But that which follows has an important meaning: God asks his Prophet, <i>What sees thou, Amos?</i> It is probable that the Prophet was astonished at a thing so mysterious. When locusts were formed, and when there was a contention by fire, he might have easily gathered what God meant; for these visions were by 				no means ambiguous: but when God stood on a wall with a plumbline, this was somewhat more hard to be understood; and the probability is, that the Prophet was made to feel much astonishment, that the people might be more attentive to hear his vision, as we commonly apply our thoughts more to hidden things; for we coldly attend to what we think to be easily understood; but mysteriousness, or something difficult to be known, sharpens our minds and attention. I do not then doubt but that God made 				the Prophet for a time to feel amazed, with the view of increasing the attention of the people. <i>What </i>then <i>dost thou see, Amos?</i> <i>A plumbline,</i> he says: but, at the same time, he knew not what was the meaning of this plumbline, or what was its design. Then God answers, <i>Behold, I set a plumbline in the midst of my people;</i> that is, I fix this to be the last rule, or the final measure, <i>and I will not add any more to pass by them</i>  As God had twice leaped over the bounds of his judgment by sparing them, he says, now that the last end was come, &#8220;I will proceed no farther,&#8221; he 				says, &#8220;in forgiving them: as when a wall is formed to the plumbline, that no part may, in the least, exceed another, but that there may be regularity throughout so also this shall be the last order; this measuring shall be true and just. I will pass by them no more.&#8221; This, I have no doubt, is the real meaning of the Prophet. We now also perceive the design of the other two visions to have been to prevent the Israelites from deceiving themselves by false self-flatteries, because God was kind and 				favorable to them. He shows that he dealt so with them, not because they were just; for God had already begun to execute his judgments on them; and the punishments with which they had been visited were strong evidences of their crimes: for God is not without reasons angry with men, especially with his chosen people. Since then they had been already smitten once and again, the Prophet proves that they were worthy of heavier punishments; and that punishments had been mild and moderated, was to be 				ascribed, he says, to the indulgence of God, because he was willing to forgive his people; but that the time had now come when he would no longer pardon them; for he saw that he had to do with irreclaimable obstinacy. This is the meaning.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iv-p15"></A><a name="iv.vii.iv-p15.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iv-p16"></A>It now follows, <i>And destroyed shall be the high places of Isaac, and overthrown shall be the sanctuaries</i> (some render <i>palaces) of Israel; and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</i> The 				Prophet here distinctly declares, that the people in vain trusted in their temples and superstitions, for by these they kindled the more against themselves the wrath of God. He would not indeed have expressly threatened the high places and the temples, unless the Israelites had provoked in this way, as I have already said, the vengeance of God against themselves, inasmuch as they had corrupted the true and lawful worship of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iv-p17"></A><i>Destroyed then shall be the high places of Isaac</i>  It may be asked, Why does he mention here the name of Isaac, which is rarely done by the Prophets? And there is also a change of one letter; for the word Isaac is commonly written with <a name="iv.vii.iv-p17.1"></A>&#1509;, <i>tsade</i>, but here it is written with <a name="iv.vii.iv-p17.2"></A>&#1513;, <i>shin</i>; but it is well known that <a name="iv.vii.iv-p17.3"></A>&#1513;, <i>shin</i> 				and <a name="iv.vii.iv-p17.4"></A>&#1509;, <i>tsade,</i> are interchangeably used. It is, however, beyond dispute, that the Prophet speaks here of the holy man Isaac; and the reason seems to be plainly this, &#8212; because the Israelites absurdly pretended to imitate their father in their superstitions; for temples, we know, had been erected where Isaac had worshipped God, and also 				their father Abraham and Jacob. Inasmuch then as the Israelites boasted of the examples of holy fathers, the Prophet here condemns this vain and false boasting. They who understand by the word Isaac, that the Prophet threatens the Idumeans as well as the Israelites, have no reason for their opinion; but the reason which I have already mentioned is quite sufficient.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iv-p18"></A>We indeed know, that the Israelites had ever in their mouths the examples of the fathers, like the woman of Samaria, who said to Christ, &#8216;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain,&#8217; (<a name="iv.vii.iv-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#020">Joh 4:20</a><a name="iv.vii.iv-p18.1"></A>) So also the Israelites were wont formerly to allege, that the holy patriarchs worshipped God in those places, &#8212; that God 				appeared in Bethel to holy Jacob, and also that in other places altars were built. Being armed with the examples of the fathers, they thought them to be their shield. The case is the same with the Papists in our day; when they hear of anything as having been done by the fathers, they instantly lay hold on it; but these are vain excuses. Like them were also the Israelites; hence the Prophet says, &#8220;Behold, ye gain nothing by this fallacious pretense; for <i>destroyed shall be the high places of Isaac,</i> even those which are now covered by an honorable name: and at the same time the temples or palaces of Israel shall be overthrown.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.iv-p19"></A><i>And I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword</i>  We learn from this last clause that things were then, as we have stated elsewhere, in a prosperous state in the kingdom of Israel, though God had in various ways wasted it before Jeroboam: but they had been ever obstinate. He afterwards restored them to a better 				condition; for the state of the people greatly improved under Jeroboam: he recovered many cities enlarged the borders of his kingdoms and then the people, in their affluence began to grow wanton against God. As then the Prophet thus saw that they abused God&#8217;s goodness, he denounced destruction on Jeroboam; hence he says, <i>Against the house of Jeroboam I will rise up with the sword;</i> that is, &#8220;I will begin to execute my judgment on the offspring of the king himself; though I may spare him, yet his posterity shall not escape my hand.&#8221;</p>  <a name="iv.vii.v"></A>

<p><a name="iv.vii.v-p2"></A>Almighty God, since thou so suspendest thy hand in chastising us, that except we be wholly blind and stupid, we must acknowledge that we are spared in order that we may willingly return to thee, and that being allured by the gentleness of thy forbearance, we may submit ourselves to thee in willing obedience, &#8212; O grant, that we may not harden our hearts, nor be slow, nor slothful, nor even backward to repent, when thou deferrest extreme punishment, 				but strive to anticipate thy final vengeance, and so submit ourselves to thee, that we may be pardoned while it is time, and so hasten to offer our hearts whole and sincere to thee, and so repent, while urged by extreme danger, that there may not remain any hidden hypocrisy in our hearts, but that we may in such a way search every faculty of our soul, that thou mayest become to us a real and faithful witness of that integrity which thou requires of all who return to thee to obtain pardon 				through Jesus Christ our Lord.

<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p11"></A><a name="iv.vii.vii-p11.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p12"></A>The Prophet here relates the device by which Satan attempted to depress his mind, that he might not go on in the discharge of his prophetic office. He says, that Amaziah had sent to the king to induce him to adopt some severe measure; for he pretended that as Amos scattered words full of sedition, and made turbulent speeches, the affairs of the king could not be carried on, except the king in due time prevented him: and besides, the 				same Amaziah said, that nothing could be better for the Prophet than to flee into the land of Judah, as he might live in safety there; for he had incurred great danger in having dared to prophesy against the king. It hence appears that Amaziah was a perfidious and cunning man, but not so bloody as to attempt openly anything serious against the Prophet&#8217;s life; unless perhaps he thought that this could not be done, and gave this advice, not so much through his kindness, as that the thing was 				impracticable: and this second supposition is probable from the words of the passage.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p13"></A>For, in the first place the Prophet says, that <i>Amaziah</i> had <i>sent to the king</i>  He then tried whether he could excite the king&#8217;s mind to persecute Amos. It may be that his design did succeed: hence he undertook 				what in the second place is related, that is, he called the Prophet to himself, and tried to frighten him, and drive him by fear from the land of Israel, that he might no longer be troublesome to them. But we must, in the first place, notice the motive by which this Amaziah was influenced, when he endeavored so much, by any means possible, to banish the Prophet from the kingdom of Israel. It is certainly not credible that he was influenced by what he pretended to the king, that there was a 				danger of sedition; but it was a pretense cunningly made. Amaziah then had a care for his own advantage, as we see to be the case in our day with cardinals and milted bishops who frequent the courts of princes, and do not honestly profess what their designs are; for they see that their tyranny cannot stand unless the gospel be abolished; they see that our doctrine threatens to become a cold and even an ice to their kitchens; and then they see that they can be of no account in the world, except 				they crush us. And what do they at the same time pretend? that our doctrine cannot be received without producing a change in the whole world, without ruin to the whole civil order, without depriving kings of their power and dignity. It is then by these malicious artifices that they gain favor to themselves. Such was the device of Amaziah, and such was his manoeuvre in opposing the Prophet Amos.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p14"></A><i>Behold,</i> he says to the king, <i>he has conspired against thee</i>  <a name="iv.vii.vii-p14.1"></A>&#1511;&#1513;&#1512;, <i>kosher,</i> is to bind, but, by a metaphor, it signifies to conspire: <i>Conspired </i>then <i>has Amos against thee.</i> But who speaks? Amaziah; and the Prophet omits not the title of Amaziah; for he says that he was <i>the priest of Bethel</i>  He might have only said, &#8220;Amaziah sent to king Jeroboam&#8221;, but by mentioning that he was a priest, the Prophet shows that Amaziah did not strive for the peace of the public, as he pretended; and that this was therefore a fallacious pretense, for he fought for his own Helen, that is, he fought for his own kitchen, in short, for his living: for he would have been deprived, with disgrace, of his priesthood, and then reduced to penury and want, except he had 				driven away the Prophet Amos. Since then he saw that such and so great an evil was nigh him except Amos was banished, he had this object in view, and pretended another thing, and sent to the king and said, <i>Amos has conspired;</i> and he enhances the crime, <i>In the midst of the house of Israel.</i> &#8220;This is not done,&#8221; he says &#8220;in a corners or in some obscure place; but his doctrine is heard on all the public roads, whole cities are filled with it; in short, it burns like fire in the very bosom, in the very midst of the kingdom; and thou wilt soon find thy own house to be all in a flame, unless thou applies a remedy, yea, except thou extinguishest it.&#8221; We hence see how Amaziah acted, and the reason why he so earnestly persuaded the king to give liberty no longer to the Prophet 				Amos.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p15"></A>With regard to what follows, &#8212; <i>that the land could no longer bear his words,</i> the sentence admits of two probable meanings. The first is, that he said, that the people, being offended with his turbulent doctrine, did now of themselves hate and detest the Prophet Amos, as a seditious man. Kings are in our day stirred on in like 				manner, &#8212; &#8220;Why do you delay? Your subjects desire nothing so much as to extinguish this evil, and all of them will eagerly assist you: ye are in the meantime idle, and your people complain of your tardiness. They think the princes in power are unworthy of their station, since they thus suffer the ancient rites and ordinances of holy Mother Church to fall into decay.&#8221; So they speak: and we may imagine the words of Amaziah to have been in the same strain, &#8212; that he stimulated the king by this 				artifice &#8212; that the people were prepared to do their part. The other meaning is this, <i>The land cannot bear his words;</i> that is, &#8220;If he goes on here with full liberty to raise tumults, as he has begun, the whole kingdom will be on the verge of ruin, for many will follow him; and when an open sedition will arise, it cannot be checked without great difficulty. We must therefore make every haste, lest Amos 				should get the upper hand; for there is already the greatest danger.&#8221; As the Pharisees held a consultation, and said,</p>  			 
<p class="Center"><a name="iv.vii.vii-p16"></A>&#8216;Lest the Romans come and take away our place and nation,&#8217; <br> 				(<a name="iv.vii.vii-p16.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#048">Joh 11:48</a><a name="iv.vii.vii-p16.2"></A>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p17"></A>so also Amaziah might have excited the king by causing him to fear, that the land, the country, or its inhabitants, had been disturbed by the words of Amos, and that therefore it was time to put a stop to him. Such was the message of Amaziah to the king.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p18"></A><a name="iv.vii.vii-p18.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p19"></A>Now our Prophet is wholly silent as to the answer of the king: it is therefore probable, either that the king was not much excited, &#8212; or that he dared not openly to take away the life of Amos; for he had probably obtained some authority among the people; and though he was hated, yet his name as a Prophet and his office were had in reverence, &#8212; or that the matter was by agreement arranged between the two enemies of 				sound doctrine, as flatterers often gratify kings by putting themselves in their place, and by bearing all the ill will. However this might have been, it is certainly a probable conjecture, that the king did not interfere, because he was so persuaded by the priest Amaziah, or because he feared the people, or because religion restrained him, as even the ungodly are sometimes wont to contain themselves within the bounds of moderation; not that they are touched by real fear towards God, or that 				they desire to embrace his true worship: they wish God to be thrust down from heaven, they wish all knowledge of religion to be obliterated; but yet they dare not pour forth their fury. Such fear then might have seized the mind of Jeroboam, that he did not tyrannically rage against the Prophet Amos. But if we regard the tendency of the words of Amaziah, he certainly wished the Prophet Amos to be immediately visited with capital punishment; for conspiracy is a crime worthy of death; and then, 				fear might have impelled the king to put the holy Prophet immediately to death. Amaziah therefore expected more than what he attained: and then appeared his vulpine wiliness, for he sent for the Prophet and advised him to withdraw to the land of Judah. Hence, as I said at the beginning, it is very probable that Jeroboam was not excited according to the expectation of the ungodly priest of Bethel, who at first was a cruel wild beast; but when he could not proceed openly to destroy Amos, he put 				on a new character; he became a fox, because he could do nothing as a raging lion. Hence follows his second attempt, <i>And Amaziah said to Amos,</i> etc.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p20"></A>I have passed over one clause in the last verse: <i>Amos says, By the sword shall Jeroboam die, and Israel, by migrating, shall migrate from their own land.</i> These, in short, are two heads of accusation. Some interpreters think that Amaziah had slanderously perverted the words of the Prophet Amos; for he 				did not denounce death on king Jeroboam, but only on his people and posterity: but I do not insist on this. It might then be, that Amaziah did not designedly pervert the words of Amos, but only wished to excite the ill will of the king. Die then shall Jeroboam or his posterity with the sword, and Israel also, by migrating, shall migrate from their own land. We hence learn, that Amaziah was not impelled only by the last address of the Prophet Amos, but that he then discovered the hatred which he 				had long harbored. Amaziah therefore had been, no doubt, on his watch, and had heard what Amos daily taught, and when he thought the matter ripe, he sent to the king. Having tried this way, and found that it did not answer, he came to his second attempt, which we are now to consider.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p21"></A><a name="iv.vii.vii-p21.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p22"></A><i>Amaziah then said to Amos,</i> &#8212; that is, after his first proceeding disappointed him; for he did not obtain from king Jeroboam what he expected, &#8212; then Amaziah said to Amos, <i>Seer, go, flee to the land of Judah!</i> By saying <i>Go,</i> he intimates that he was at liberty to depart, as though he said, &#8220;Why wouldest thou willfully perish among us?&#8221; At the same time, the two clauses ought to be joined together. He says first, <i>Go,</i> and then, <i>flee</i>  When he says Go, he reminds him, as I have 				already said, that if he wished, he might go away, as no one prevented his departure: &#8220;Go, then, for the way is open to you.&#8221; But when he says, <i>flee,</i> he means that he could not long remain safe there: &#8220;Except thou provident for thy life, it is all over with you: flee then quickly away from us, else thou art lost.&#8221; We hence see how cunningly Amaziah assailed God&#8217;s Prophet. He proposed to him an 				easy way of saving his life; at the same time he urged him with the fear of danger, and declared that he could not remain safe, except he immediately fled. These then were the two reasons which he used as mighty engines to depress the heart of the holy Prophet.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p23"></A>He afterwards subjoins, <i>And eat there thy bread</i>  This is the third argument. He might be allowed to live in his own country, and be supplied there with sustenance; for Amos was, as we have said, one of the shepherds of Tekoa. He must then have arisen from the tribe of Judah, and he had his habitation 				and his relations in that kingdom. Besides, Azariah was not an ungodly king: though not one of the most perfect, he yet respected and honored the servants of God. Hence, by saying, <i>Eat there thy bread,</i> Amaziah means that there was a safe residence for the Prophets in the kingdom of Judah, and that they were there esteemed both by the king and by the people, and that they might live there. This is the 				third argument.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p24"></A>Now follows the fourth: &#8220;If thou dost object to me, and say that thou art a Prophet, and that it is neither lawful nor right in thee to be silent<i>, be a prophet there.</i> Thou knowest that prophets are attended to in the kingdom of Judah; thou mayest then perform thine office there, and live at liberty, 				and without fear.&#8221; We hence see four of the reasons by which Amaziah attempted to persuade the Prophet Amos to leave the people of Israel, and to go to his own kindred.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p25"></A>But there follows a fifth reason: <i>But in Bethel prophesy no more; for the sanctuary of the king it is, and his court.</i> Here Amaziah annoys the Prophet by another pretense, or he tries, at least, to shake his courage, by intimating that it was unbecoming to raise commotions in the kingdom of Israel, and also that, by so doing, 				he offended God, because Jeroboam was a divinely appointed king, and endued with the chief authority. Since then the king could, by his own right, institute new modes of worship, Amaziah here argues that it is not in the power of any one who pleased to pull down those rites which had been universally received, and then confirmed by a royal edict, but that they ought to be received without any dispute. We then perceive now the import of the whole.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p26"></A>But it must be noticed in this place, that we must be watchful, not only against the open violence and cruelty of enemies, but also against their intrigues; for as Satan is a murderer, and has been so from the beginning, so he is also the father of lies. Whosoever then wishes strenuously and constantly to spend his labors for the Church and for God, must prepare himself for a contest with both: he must resist all fears and all 				intrigues. We see some not so fearful, though a hundred deaths were denounced upon them, who are yet not sufficiently cautious when enemies craftily insinuate themselves. I have not, therefore, said without reason, that God&#8217;s servants have need of being fortified against both; that they ought to be prepared against the fear of death, and remain intrepid, though they must die, and that they ought to lay down their necks, if needs be, while performing their office, and to seal their doctrine with 				their own blood; &#8212; and that, on the other hand, their ought to be prudent; for oftentimes the enemies of the truth assail them by flatteries; and the experience of our own times sufficiently proves this. More danger, I know, has ever been from this quarter; that is, when enemies attempt to terrify by such objections as these, &#8220;What is your purpose? See, the whole world must necessarily at length be consumed by calamities. What else do you seek, but that religion should everywhere flourish, that 				sound learning should be valued, that peace should prevail everywhere? But we see that the fiercest war is at hand: if once it should arise, all places would be full of calamities, savage barbarity, and cruelty, would follow, and religion would perish: all this ye will effect by your pertinacity.&#8221; These things have often been said to us. When therefore we read this passage, we ought to notice the arts by which Satan has been trying to undermine the efforts of the godly, and the constancy of 				God&#8217;s servants.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p27"></A>As to the first argument, there is no need much of dwelling longer upon it; for every one can of himself perceive the design of all this crafty proceeding. He says first, Seer, go. Amaziah addresses Amos in a respectful way: he does not reproachfully call him, either an exile, or a seditious man, or one unlearned, or a cowherd, or a person unworthy of his office. He does not use any such language, but calls him a seer; 				he concedes to him the honorable title of a Prophet; for by the word <a name="iv.vii.vii-p27.1"></A>&#1495;&#1494;&#1492;, <i>chese</i>, he means this &#8220;I confess thee to be God&#8217;s Prophet: I grant that thou art a Prophet, but not our Prophet; <i>Seer,</i> then, <i>go.&#8221;</i> We hence see that he left to him 				untouched the honor of being a Prophet, that he might more easily creep into his favor, lest by raising a dispute at first, there should be between them a violent contest: he therefore avoided all occasions of contention.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p28"></A>It might however have been asked him, Why he was blind? For the office of a priest was to watch; and the Prophets were in such a manner joined to the priests, that when God substituted Prophets in their place, he indirectly charged them with idleness and indifference. For why were the priests appointed? That they might be the messengers of the Lord of hosts, as it is said by Malachi,</p>  			 
<p class="Center"><a name="iv.vii.vii-p29"></A>&#8216;The people shall seek from the mouth of the priest my law, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts,&#8217; (<a name="iv.vii.vii-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007">Mal 2:7</a><a name="iv.vii.vii-p29.1"></A>)</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p30"></A>Amaziah then ought especially to have performed himself the Prophet&#8217;s office, for he was a priest. He was indeed, I allow, a spurious priest; but having claimed so honorable a name, he ought to have discharged its duties: this he did note and conceded that title to the Prophet. So now our milted bishops are very liberal in conceding titles, &#8220;O, Mr. Teacher, ye can indeed see and understand many things: but yet ye ought, at the same 				time, to consult the peace of the community.&#8221; They call those teachers who have been invested with no public office, but are yet under the necessity of undertaking the duties of others, for they see that these milted bishops are dumb dogs. In a like manner, also, did Amaziah act towards the Prophet Amos; for he was content with his own splendor and great pomp, and with his own riches; he lived sumptuously, and enjoyed a rich booty, and superstitions well warmed his kitchen. He therefore easily 				surrendered to others the title of a Prophet: in the meantime, he prided himself on his priesthood.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p31"></A>But as to the second argument, there was a sharper sting in it, <i>Flee,</i> he says. By flight he intimates, that it was necessary for the Prophet to depart, though he wished to remain. So this second reason was borrowed from necessity; for the Prophet could no longer be borne with, if he proceeded in the free discharge of his office. <i>Flee</i> then <i>to the land of Judah, and there eat bread</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p32"></A>With regard to this third reason, he seems to imply that the Prophet Amos would be too pertinacious and too much wedded to his own opinion, if he preferred not to live safely and quietly in his own country, rather than to endanger his life in another land. Go then. Where would he send him? To his own country. Why? &#8220;Thou art here a foreigner, and sees thyself to be hated; why then dost thou not rather return to thine own country, where 				thy religion prevails?&#8221; Amaziah did not indeed address the Prophet Amos, as man of profane men do at this day, who are less like Epicureans than they are to swine and filthy dogs; for they object and say, &#8220;Thou mayest return to thine own country; why hast thou come to us?&#8221; They send us away to our own country, when they know that there is there no safe place for us. But at that time pure religion flourished in the land of Judah: hence Amaziah says, &#8220;Why dost thou not live with thy own 				countrymen? for there are many there who will supply thee with sustenance; the king himself will be thy friend, and the whole people will also help thee.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p33"></A>As to the fourth argument, we see what a crafty sophist is the devil, <i>Be a Prophet there</i>  Who speaks? Amaziah, who perfectly hated the temple at Jerusalem, who would have gladly with his own hands set it on fire, who would have gladly put to death all the pious priests; and yet he allows to holy Amos 				a free liberty to prophesy, and he allows this, because he could not immediately in an open manner stop the holy Prophet in his course: he therefore sends him away to a distance. We hence see that Satan, by various arts and means, tempts the servants of God, and has wonderful turnings and windings, and sometimes transforms himself into an angel of light, as it is said by Paul, (<a name="iv.vii.vii-p33.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#014">2Co 11:14</a><a name="iv.vii.vii-p33.1"></A>) and in this place we have a remarkable instance of this. Is not Amaziah an angel of light, when he advises the Prophet Amos to serve God freely in his own country, and to prophesy there, and to open his mouth in defense of God&#8217;s worship and of pure religion? provided he did not do all this in the land of Israel. We have then in this chapter, as I have said, a remarkable instance of the wiliness of Satan.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p34"></A><a name="iv.vii.vii-p34.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p35"></A>Now as to the fifth argument, it is especially needful to dwell on it. <i>In Bethel,</i> he says, <i>add no more to prophesy, for it is the king&#8217;s sanctuary, and it is the house of the kingdom</i>  Here only Amaziah shows what he wished, even to retain possession of his priesthood; which he could not have done without banishing the Prophet: for he could not contend with him in arguments. He consulted then his own advantage by getting rid of the Prophet. Whatever various characters therefore he assumed in the last verse, and notwithstanding the many coverings by which he concealed himself, the ape now, as they say, appears as the ape. Amaziah then shows what he had in views 				even that he might remain quiet in the possession of his own tyrannical powers and that Amos should no more molest him, and pull up by the roots the prevailing superstitions: for Amaziah was a priest, and Amos could not perform his office without crying out daily against the temple of Bethel; for it was a brothel, inasmuch as God was there robbed of his own honor; and we also know that superstitions are everywhere compared to fornication. Amaziah then now betrays his wicked intention, 				<i>In Bethel prophesy not;</i> he would retain his quiet state, and wished not the word of God to be heard there. His desire was, as we have already said, to extinguish everywhere the light of heavenly truth; but as he could not do this, he wished to continue at least in his own station without any disputes, as we see the case to be in our time with the Pope and his milted bishops. 				They became quite mad when they heard that many cities and some princes made commotions in Germany, and departed from their submission to them; but as they could not subdue them by force, they said, &#8220;Let us leave to themselves these barbarians; why, more evil than good has hitherto proceeded from them; it is a barren and dry country: provided we have Spain, France, and Italy, secured to us, we have enough; for we have probably lost more than what we have gained by Germany. Let them then have 				their liberty, or rather licentiousness; they will again some time return, and come under our authority: let us not in the meantime be over-anxious about them. But let not this contagion penetrate into France, for one of our arms has been already cut off; nor let Spain nor Italy be touched by it; for this would be to aim at our life.&#8221; Such also was this Amaziah, as it evidently appears, &#8212; Prophesy not then in Bethel.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p36"></A>And he spoke cunningly when he said, <i>Add no more to prophecy;</i> for it was the same as though he pardoned him. &#8220;See, though thou hast hitherto been offending the king and the common feeling of the people, I will not yet treat you with strict justice, I will forgive thee all, let what thou hast done amiss remain buried, provided 				thou &#8216;addest no more&#8217; in future.&#8221; We hence see that there is emphasis in the expression, when he says, Proceed not, or, add not; as though he had said, that he would not inquire into the past, nor would accuse Amos of having been seditious: provided he abstained for the future, Amaziah was satisfied, as we may gather from his words, <i>Add</i> then <i>no more to prophesy.</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p37"></A>And why? Because <i>it is the king&#8217;s sanctuary</i>  This was one thing. Amaziah wished here to prove by the king&#8217;s authority that the received worship at Bethel was legitimate. How so? &#8220;The king has established it; it is not then lawful for any one to say a word to the contrary; the king could do this by his 				own right; for his majesty is sacred.&#8221; We see the object in view. And how many are there at this day under the Papacy, who accumulate on kings all the authority and power they can, in order that no dispute may be made about religion; but power is to be vested in one king to determine according to his own will whatever he pleases, and this is to remain fixed without any dispute. They who at first extolled Henry, King of England, were certainly inconsiderate men; they gave him the supreme power 				in all things: and this always vexed me grievously; for they were guilty of blasphemy (<a name="iv.vii.vii-p37.1"></A><i>erant blasphemi</i><i>) </i>when they called him the chief Head of the Church under Christ. This was certainly too much: but it ought however to remain buried, as they sinned through inconsiderate zeal. But when that impostor, who afterwards became the chancellor of that Proserpina, 				  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">50</FONT></A>
 				 who, at this day, surpasses all devils in that kingdom &#8212; when he was at Ratisbon, he contended not by using any reasons, (I speak of the last chancellor, who was the Bishop of Winchester,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">51</FONT></A>
 				) and as I have just said, he cared not much about the testimonies of Scripture, but said that it was in the power of the king to abrogate statutes and to institute new rites, &#8212; that as to fasting, the king could forbid or command the people to eat flesh on this or that days that it was lawful for the king to prohibit priests from marrying, that it was lawful for the king to interdict to the people the use of the cup in the Supper, that it was lawful for the king 				to appoint this or that thing in his own kingdom. How so? because supreme power is vested in the king. The same was the gloss of this Amaziah of whom the Prophet now speaks: It is the sanctuary of the king.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p40"></A>But he adds afterwards a second thing, <i>It is the house of the kingdom</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">52</FONT></A>
 				 These words of Amaziah ought to be well considered. He says first<i>, It is the king&#8217;s sanctuary,</i> and then, <i>It is the house of the kingdom.</i> Hence he ascribes to the king a twofold office, &#8212; that it was in his power to change religion in any way he pleased, &#8212; and then, that Amos disturbed the peace of the community, and 				thus did wrong to the king by derogating from his authority. With regard to the first clause, it is indeed certain that kings, when they rightly discharge their duty, become patrons of religion and supporters (<a name="iv.vii.vii-p41.3"></A><i>nutricios</i> &#8212; nursers) of the Church, as Isaiah calls them, (<a name="iv.vii.vii-p41.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#023">Isa 49:23</a><a name="iv.vii.vii-p41.4"></A>) What then is chiefly required of kings, is this &#8212; to use the swords with which they are invested, to render free (<a name="iv.vii.vii-p41.5"></A><i>asserendum</i>) the worship of God. But still they are inconsiderate men, who give them too much power in spiritual things; (<a name="iv.vii.vii-p41.6"></A><i>qui faciunt illos nimis spirituales</i>&#8212;who make them too spiritual) and this evil is everywhere dominant in Germany; and in these regions it prevails too much. And we now find what fruit is produced by this root, which is this, &#8212; that princes, and those who are in power, think themselves so spiritual, that there is no longer any church discipline; and this sacrilege greatly prevails among us; for they limit not their office 				by fixed and legitimate boundaries, but think that they cannot rule, except they abolish every authority in the Church and become chief judges as well in doctrine as in all spiritual government. The devil then suggested at that time this sentiment to Amaziah, &#8212; that the king appointed the temple: hence, since it was <i>the king&#8217;s sanctuary, </i>it was not lawful for a private man, it 				was not even lawful for any one, to deny that religion to be of authority, which had been once approved of, and pleased the king. And princes listen to a sweet song, when impostors lead them astray; and they desire nothing more than that all things without any difference or distinction should be referred to themselves. They then gladly interfere, and at first show some zeal, but mere ambition impels them, as they so carefully appropriate every thing to themselves. Moderation ought then to be 				observed; for this evil has ever been dominant in princes &#8212; to wish to change religion according to their will and fancy, and at the same time for their own advantage; for they regard what is of advantage to themselves, as they are not for the most part guided by the Spirit of God, but impelled by their own ambition. Since then we see that Satan by these hidden arts formerly contended against God&#8217;s prophets, we ought to bewail and lament our own courses. But whosoever desires to conduct himself 				as it behaves him, let him watch against this evil.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p42"></A>It now follows, <i>And it is the house of the kingdom</i>  Amaziah contends here no more for the royal prerogative, with regard to spiritual power. &#8220;Be it, that the king ought not to have appointed new worship, thou hast yet offended against the peace of the community.&#8221; The greater part of the princes 				  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">53</FONT></A>
 				 at this day seek nothing so much as that they might enjoy their own quietness. They ever declare that they would he courageous enough even to death in the defense of their first confession; but yet what are the teachers they seek for themselves? Even those who avoid the cross and who, to gratify the Papists, or to render them at least somewhat milder, change according to their wishes: for we see at this day that the minds of princes are inflamed by these fanners, 				not to spare the sacramentarians, nor allow to be called into question what is asserted, not less grossly than foolishly and falsely, respecting the presence of Christ&#8217;s body, or his body being included under the bread. &#8220;When we show that we contend against them, and that we are separated from them, nay, that we will be their mortal enemies, we in this agree with the Papists; there will then be some access to them, at least their great fury will cease, the Papists will become gentle: they will 				no more be so incensed against us; we shall hereafter obtain some middle course.&#8221; So things are at this day carried on in the world; and nothing is more useful than to compare the state of our time with this example of the Prophet, so that we may go on in our works employing the same weapons with which he contended and not be moved by these diabolical arts; for we have no enemies more hostile and open than these domestic traitors.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.vii-p44"></A>It is then <i>the house of the kingdom</i>  He now speaks of the secular arm, as they say, and shows that though religion were to perish a hundred times, yet care was to be taken, lest Amos should pull up by the roots the kingdom of Jeroboam, and the customs of the people. It now follows &#8212;</p>  <a name="iv.vii.viii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption18"><a name="iv.vii.viii-p1"></A><a name="iv.vii.viii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo007.htm#014">Amos 7:14-15</a><a name="iv.vii.viii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="iv.vii.viii-p2"></A><b>14.</b> Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I <i>was</i> no prophet, neither <i>was</i> I a prophet&#8217;s son; but I <i>was</i> an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</p>

<p><a name="iv.vii.viii-p7"></A><a name="iv.vii.viii-p7.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.viii-p8"></A>The Prophet Amos first pleads for himself, that he was not at liberty to obey the counsel of Amaziah, because he could not renounce a calling to which he was appointed. As then he had been sent by God, he proves that he was bound by necessity to prophesy in the land of Israel. In the first place, he indeed modestly says, that he was not a prophet, nor the son of a prophet: why did he say this? To render himself contemptible? By no 				means, though the words apparently have this tendency; but it was to gain for himself more authority; for his extraordinary call gave him greater weight than if he had been brought up from his childhood in the schools of the prophets. He then shows that he became a prophet by a miraculous interposition, and that the office was not committed to him by human authority, and in the usual way; but that he had been led to it as it were by force, so that he could not cast aside the office of teaching, 				without openly shaking off the yoke laid upon him by God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.viii-p9"></A>This account then which Amos gives of himself ought to be noticed<i>, I was not a Prophet, nor the son of a Prophet</i>  Had he said simply that he was not a Prophet, he might have been accused of presumption: how so? No one takes to himself this honor in the Church of God; a call is 				necessary; Were an angel to descend from heaven, he ought not to subvert public order; (<a name="iv.vii.viii-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008">Ga 1:8</a><a name="iv.vii.viii-p9.1"></A>) for all things, as Paul reminds us, ought to be done decently and in lawful order in the Church; for the God of peace presides over us. Had Amos then positively denied that he was a Prophet, he might on this account have been thrust away from his office of teaching, for he wanted a 				call. But he means that he was not a Prophet who had been from his childhood instructed in God&#8217;s law, to be an interpreter of Scripture: and for the same reason he says that he was not the son of a Prophet; for there were then, we know, colleges for Prophets; and this is sufficiently evident from sacred history. As then these colleges were instituted for this end &#8212; that there might be always seminaries for the Church of God, so that it might not be destitute of good and faithful teachers, Amos 				says that he was not of that class. He indeed honestly confesses that he was an illiterate man: but by this as I have already said, he gained to himself more authority inasmuch as the Lord had seized on him as it were by force, and set him over the people to teach them: &#8220;See, thou shalt be my Prophet, and though thou hast not been taught from thy youth for this office, I will yet in an instant make thee a Prophet.&#8221; It was a greater miracle, that Christ chose rude and ignorant men as his 				apostles, than if he had at first chosen Paul or men like him who were skillful in the law. If then Christ had at the beginning selected such disciples, their authority would have appeared less: but as he had prepared by his Spirit those who were before unlearned, it appeared more evident that they were sent from above. And to this refers the expression the Prophet uses, when he says, <i>Jehovah took me away:</i> for it intimates that his calls as we 				have said, was extraordinary. The rest we shall defer till to-morrow.</p>  <a name="iv.vii.ix"></A>

<p><a name="iv.vii.xi-p8"></A>Amos having shown that he must obey God, who had committed to him the office of teaching, now turns his discourse to Amaziah, and points out what he would gain by his insolence in daring to forbid a Prophet, an ambassador of the God of heaven, to proclaim what he had in command. As, then, Amaziah had proceeded into such a degree of rashness or rather of madness Amos now assails him and says, <i>Hear then now the word of Jehovah</i>  He sets here the word or the decree of God in opposition to the prohibition of Amaziah: for the ungodly priest had forbidden God&#8217;s servant to proclaim his words any more in the land of Israel: &#8220;Who art thou? Thou indeed thus speakest; but God will also speak in his turn.&#8221; He shows, at the same time, the difference between the speech of Amaziah and the word of 				God: the impostor had indeed attempted to terrify the holy man so as to makehim to desist from his office, though the attempt was vain; but Amos shows that God&#8217;s word would not be without effect: &#8220;Whether I hold my peace or speak,&#8221; he seems to say, &#8220;this vengeance is suspended over thee.&#8221; But he, at the same time, connects God&#8217;s vengeance with his doctrine; for this was also necessary, that the ungodly priest might know that he gained nothing else, by attempting to do everything, than that he 				had doubly increased the vengeance of God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.xi-p9"></A>There is, therefore, great emphasis in these words, <i>Now hear the word of Jehovah thou who sayest, Prophesy not.</i> Amaziah was indeed worthy of being destroyed by God a hundred times, together with all his offspring: but Amos intimates that God&#8217;s wrath was especially kindled by this madness, &#8212; that Amaziah dared to put a restraint 				on God, and to forbid his Spirit freely to reprove the sins of the whole people. Since, then, he proceeded so far, Amos shows that he would have justly to suffer the punishment due to his presumption, yea, to his furious and sacrilegious audacity, inasmuch as he set himself up against God, and sought to take from him his supreme authority, for nothing belongs more peculiarly to God than the office of judging the world; and this he does by his word and his Prophets. As, then, Amaziah had 				attempted to rob God of his own right and authority, the Prophet shows that vengeance had been thereby increased: <i>Thou</i> then, <i>who sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and speak not, hear the word of Jehovah</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.xi-p10"></A>Remarkable is this passage, and from it we learn that nothing is better for us, when God rebukes us, than to descend into our own consciences, and to submit to the sentence which proceeds from his mouth, and humbly to entreat pardon as soon as he condemns us: for if we be refractory, God will not cease to speak, though we a hundred times forbid him; he will therefore go on notwithstanding our unwillingness. Further, we may vomit forth 				many blasphemies; but what can our clamorous words do? The Lord will, at the same time, speak with effect; he will not scatter his threatening in the air, but will really fulfill what proceeds from his mouth; and for this reason Paul compares heavenly truth to a sword, for vengeance is prepared for despisers. We ought therefore to take notice of this in the Prophet&#8217;s words, &#8212; that when profane men attempt to repel every tenth and all threatening, they gain nothing by their perverseness; for the 				lord will exercise his own right; and he will also join to his word, as they say, its execution. Thou then who sayest, Prophesy not, hear the word of Jehovah; though thou mayest growl, yet God will not be hindered by these thy commands; but he will ever continue complete in his own authority.&#8221; And he mentions <i>word,</i> as we have already said, to show that the truth, with which the ungodly contend, is connected with the power of God. God might indeed destroy all the unbelieving in silence, 				without uttering his voice; but he will have his Word honored, that the ungodly may know that they contend in vain, while they vomit forth their rage against his word, for they will at length find that in his word is included their condemnation.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.xi-p11"></A>Now, when he says, <i>Prophecy not against Israel, and speak not against the house of Isaac,</i> we may learn again from these words, that the word Isaac is used by the Prophet by way of concession; for the people of Israel were then wont to adduce the example of this holy patriarch. Thus superstitious men, 				neglecting the law of God, the common rule, ever turn aside to the examples of the saints; and they do this without any discrimination; nay, as their minds are perverted, when anything has been wrongfully done by the fathers, they instantly lay hold on it: and then, when there is anything peculiar, which God had approved in the fathers but wished not to be drawn, as they commonly say, into a precedent, the superstitious think that they have the best reason in their favor, when they can set up 				such a shield against God. As, then, the Israelites had at that time the name of their father Isaac in their mouths while they were foolishly worshipping God in Bethel and in other places, contrary to what the law prescribed, the Prophet Amos designedly repeats here again the name of Isaac, expressing it probably in imitation of what had been said by Amaziah.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.xi-p12"></A><a name="iv.vii.xi-p12.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.xi-p13"></A>Now follows a denunciation, <i>Therefore thus saith Jehovah</i>  This <a name="iv.vii.xi-p13.1"></A>&#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, <i>lacen</i>, therefore, shows that Amaziah suffered punishment, not only because 				he had corrupted God&#8217;s worship, because he had deceived the people by his impostures and because he had made gain by the disguise of religion; but because he had insolently dared to oppose the authority of God, and to turn aside the Prophet from his office, both by hidden crafts and by open violence. Inasmuch then as he had attempted to do this, Amos now declares that punishment awaited him. We hence see that destruction is doubly increased, when we set up a hard and iron neck against God, who 				would have us to be pliant, and when he reproves us, requires from us at least this modesty &#8212; that we confess that we have sinned. But when we evade, or when we proceed still outward, this issue will at last follow &#8212; that God will execute double vengeance on account of our obstinacy. <i>Therefore</i> then <i>Jehovah 				saith:</i> and O! that this were deeply engraven on the hearts of men; there would not then be so much rebellion at this day prevailing in the world. But we see how daring men are; for as soon as the Lord severely reproves them, they murmur; and then, if they have any authority they stretch every nerve to take away from God his own rights, and from his servants their liberty. At the same time, when we observe the ungodly to be so blind, 				that they perceive not the vengeance, such as the Prophet here denounces, to be nigh them, and dread it not, it behooves us duly to weigh what the Prophet here declares and that is, that perverse men, as I have already said, do gain this only by their obstinacy &#8212; that they more and more inflame God&#8217;s displeasure.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.xi-p14"></A>With respect to the kind of punishment he was to suffer, it is said<i>, Thy wife in the city shall be wanton:</i> it is so literally; but the Prophet speaks not here of voluntary wantonness. He then intimates that Amaziah could not escape punishment, but that his wife would be made a 				prostitute, when the enemies occupied the land of Israel. We indeed know that it was a common thing for conquerors to abuse women: and well would it be, were the practice abolished at this day. Besides, it was deemed lawful in that age for the conqueror to take to himself not only the daughter but also the wife of another. This then is the reason why the Prophet says, <i>Thy wife shall be a prostitute.</i> But he says, <i>in the 				city; </i>which was far more grievous, than if the wife of Amaziah had been led to a distance, and suffered that reproach in an unknown country: it would have less wounded the mind of Amaziah, if the enemies had taken away his wife, and this disgrace had continued unknown to him, it being done in a distant land. But when his wife was publicly and before the eyes of all constrained to submit to this baseness and turpitude, it was much more hard to be 				endured, and occasioned much greater grief. We hence see that the punishment was much increased by this circumstance, which the Prophet states when he says, <i>Thy wife shall in the city be a prostitute.</i></p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.xi-p15"></A>Then it follows, <i>Thy sons and thy daughters shall by the sword fall</i>  It is a second punishment, when he declares, that the sons and also the daughters of the ungodly priest would be slain by the enemies. It was indeed probable, that some also of the common people had suffered the same evils; but God no 				doubt punished the willfulness and madness of Amaziah for having dared to resist admonitions as well as threatening.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.xi-p16"></A>But he also adds, <i>Thy land shall be divided by a line</i>  He means by this statement, that there should be none to succeed Amaziah; but that whatever land he possessed should become a prey to the enemies. <i>Thy land</i> then <i>shall be 				divided by a line. </i>It may at the same time be, that Amos speaks here generally of the land of Israel; and this seems to me probable. I indeed allow that neither by Amaziah nor by the other priests was the law of God kept; but we yet know that there was some affinity between the lawful priesthood, and the spurious priesthood which the first Jeroboam had introduced. Hence I conjecture that Amaziah had no possessions, it being lawful for priests to 				have only gardens and pastures for their cattle; but they cultivated no lands. I am therefore disposed to extend to the whole people what is said of the land of one man; and this opinion is confirmed by what immediately follows.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.xi-p17"></A><i>But thou shalt die in a polluted land.</i> He called that the land of Amaziah in which he and the rest of the people dwelt; but he calls the land into which he, with all the rest, were to be driven, a polluted land. If any one objects and says that this punishment did not apply to one man, the ready answer is this, &#8212; that God meant that an especial mark 				should be imprinted on his common judgment, that Amaziah might know, that he had as it were accelerated God&#8217;s vengeance, which yet he intended to turn aside, when he sent away, as we have seen, the Prophet Amos into the land of Judah.</p>  			 
<p><a name="iv.vii.xi-p18"></A>It follows at last, <i>Israel by migrating shall migrate from his own land</i>  We here see that the Prophet proclaimed no private threatening, either to Amaziah himself or to his wife or to his children, but extended his discourse to the whole people: the fact at the same time remains unchanged that God 				intended to punish the perverseness of that ungodly man, while executing his vengeance on the whole people. Now follows &#8212;</p>
