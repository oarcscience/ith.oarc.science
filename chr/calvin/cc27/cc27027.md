*Calvin's Commentaries, Vol. 27: Joel, Amos, Obadiah*, tr. by John King,
\[1847-50\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

<span id="vii.iii"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p1"></span>Addenda to AMOS

<span id="vii.iii-p2"></span>**<span id="vii.iii-p2.2"></span>[Amos
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/amo002.htm#007)<span id="vii.iii-p2.2"></span>**,
*Who pant, etc.* Our common version is the literal one, which is
followed by *Henderson,* but altered for the worse by *Newcome,* who was
led astray by Hobigant and the Septuagint. Not only are the words
inverted, but a change is made in the verb, without the authority of any
MS. It is a strong mode of expression to set forth the extreme cruelty
and avariciousness of the persons referred to. “They even begrudged
them,” as Henderson observes, “the small quantity of dust they had cast
on their heads in token of mourning:” or, as *Parkhurst* says, They
“*longed* to see the poor and miserable still more wretched: a most
diabolical character surely!” To cast dust on the head was then
customary in seasons of great distress. See <span
id="vii.iii-p2.3"></span>[Job
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#012)<span id="vii.iii-p2.3"></span>;
<span id="vii.iii-p2.4"></span>[Eze
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#030)<span id="vii.iii-p2.4"></span>;
and <span id="vii.iii-p2.5"></span>[2Sa
13:19](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#019)<span id="vii.iii-p2.5"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p3"></span>**<span id="vii.iii-p3.2"></span>[Amos
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo003.htm#005)<span id="vii.iii-p3.2"></span>**,
*Will a bird fall into a snare on the earth without a fowler? etc.*
*Newcome,* with whom *Henderson* materially agrees, renders this verse
differently, —

<span id="vii.iii-p4"></span>*“Can a bird fall into a snare upon the
earth,  
Where no gin* is set *for him?  
Will a snare spring from the ground,  
When it hath not taken anything*?*”*

<span id="vii.iii-p5"></span>The comparison is more appropriate
according to the version of Calvin; and the probability is that it is
the right one. The word <span id="vii.iii-p5.1"></span>מוקש, rendered,
“gin” by *Newcome,* as it is in our version, is considered by
*Henderson* as redundant; and this very circumstance creates a suspicion
that the passage is not rightly understood. This word is often rendered
in our version “snare,” but it means more properly the act, ensnaring,
than the instrument, snare: and it may be considered here a Hiphil
participle — “he who ensnares,” or, “the ensnarer.” It is rendered <span
id="vii.iii-p5.2"></span>ἱξευτης, a bird catcher by the Septuagint. Then
the two following lines will admit naturally of Calvin’s rendering, and
there will be no need of having recourse to *Henderson’s* “elastic
snare,” or to *Adam Clarke’s* “spring-trap,” neither of which is, I
believe, intended by the word <span id="vii.iii-p5.3"></span>פח, which
signifies a snare spread out, or an expanded net. See <span
id="vii.iii-p5.4"></span>[Job 18:9](../../../bib/kjv/job018.htm#009),
[Ps. 140:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa140.htm#005), [Ps.
142:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#003)<span id="vii.iii-p5.4"></span>

<span id="vii.iii-p6"></span>**<span id="vii.iii-p6.2"></span>[Amos
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#003)<span id="vii.iii-p6.2"></span>,**
*And ye shall cast yourselves down from the palace.* This difficult line
is variously rendered. *Dathius* renders it, “To Amenia shall ye be led
away;” *Newcome,* following *Houbigant,* who always mends the text, “And
I will cast it forth, and will utterly destroy it;” *Henderson,* “Ye
shall be even thrown out of the palace;” and *Horsley,* following
*Parkhurst*, “And ye shall be thrown into the shambles.” The whole
difficulty lies in the word <span id="vii.iii-p6.3"></span>ההרמונה,
found only here. The idea of shambles agrees well with the context, in
which cows are mentioned. *Parkhurst*, after *Schultens,* derives it
from <span id="vii.iii-p6.4"></span>הרם, not found in Hebrew as a verb,
but it means in Arabic, “to cut into small pieces.” Hence as a noun,
<span id="vii.iii-p6.5"></span>הרמון seems to denote the place in which
meat is thus cut. The <span id="vii.iii-p6.6"></span>ה, as *Parkhurst*
observes, is evidently radical, as it is preceded by <span
id="vii.iii-p6.7"></span>ה servile. This appears to be the best solution
of the difficulty.

<span id="vii.iii-p7"></span>**<span id="vii.iii-p7.2"></span>[Amos
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#005)<span id="vii.iii-p7.2"></span>**,
*And burn incense,* *etc.* The word for incense is not in the form of a
verb. Both *Houbigant* and *Horsley* take it here not a verb but a noun:
but their transpositions are by no means necessary. The latter part of
the fourth verse, and the whole of this, I would render thus, —

<span id="vii.iii-p8"></span>And bring, in the morning, your
sacrifices,  
In the third year, your tithes,

<span id="vii.iii-p9"></span>*5. And incense with the leaven of
thank-offering,  
Yea, publish vows, proclaim* them; *  
For thus ye love* to do, *O children of Israel,  
Saith the Lord Jehovah.*

<span id="vii.iii-p10"></span> 

<span id="vii.iii-p11"></span>**<span id="vii.iii-p11.2"></span>[Amos
5:24](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#024)<span
id="vii.iii-p11.2"></span>,** *And run down,* *etc.*,

<span id="vii.iii-p12"></span>“But judgment shall come rolling on like
waters,  
And justice like a resistless torrent.

<span id="vii.iii-p13"></span>“That is, the irresistible judgment and
justice of God shall come upon those hypocrites like an inundation, and
sweep them away like a torrent.” — *Horsley.*

<span id="vii.iii-p14"></span>**<span id="vii.iii-p14.2"></span>[Amos
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#001)<span id="vii.iii-p14.2"></span>,**
*which have been renowned,* *etc.* Various are the expositions of this
and the following line. *Newcome’s* version overleaps the rule of
grammar, —

<span id="vii.iii-p15"></span>“That are named after the chief of the
nations,  
And to them the house of Israel resort.”

<span id="vii.iii-p16"></span>The explanation is this, — “They call
themselves, not after their religious ancestors, but after the chief of
the idolatrous nations, with whom they intermarry contrary to their
law.” How foreign to everything in the context is this! *Henderson’s*
rendering is more like a version of the original, —

<span id="vii.iii-p17"></span>“The distinguished men of the first of
nations,  
To whom the house of Israel come.”

<span id="vii.iii-p18"></span>He considers that the chief persons of the
Hebrew nation are here spoken of, to whom the house of Israel, the
community, came for judgment: and this has little to do with the
context. *Horsley* seems to have given the most literal version, and the
most suitable to this place, —

<span id="vii.iii-p19"></span>“Marking out the first of the nations,  
Go unto them, O house of Israel.

<span id="vii.iii-p20"></span>And then the Prophet mentions in the next
who these nations were, “Pass over,” he says, “into Calneh,” etc. So
that this distich is connected with the following verses. For <span
id="vii.iii-p20.1"></span>נקבי, one copy of Kennicott has <span
id="vii.iii-p20.2"></span>נקבו, “Mark ye out,” or, notice; this would
make the line complete. Though the Septuagint here goes much astray, yet
it gives the verb used here in the third person plural: and that person
in Hebrew is the same as the second person plural of the imperative.

<span id="vii.iii-p21"></span>**<span id="vii.iii-p21.2"></span>[Amos
9:12](../../../bib/kjv/amo009.htm#012)<span
id="vii.iii-p21.2"></span>,** *That possess they may,* *etc*. Both this
and the preceding verse are quoted, in <span
id="vii.iii-p21.3"></span>[Acts 15:16](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#016),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#017)<span id="vii.iii-p21.3"></span>,
not literally, but mainly from the Septuagint, which differs
considerably in words, but not in sense, from the Hebrew. *Newcome,*
with the view of producing a verbal agreement, has changed and altered
the Hebrew text without the authority of a single MS. This is rightly
disapproved both by *Adam Clarke* and *Henderson.* The former says, “We
must dismiss all these conjectural emendations, and take the Hebrew text
as we find it. That it speaks of the *conversion of the Jews* in gospel
times, we have the authority of the New Testament; and if we cannot make
the *words*, as they stand there, *entirely* to agree with the words
here, the *subject* is not affected by it.”
