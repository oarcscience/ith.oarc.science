<span id="x-p1"></span>Chapter 3

<span id="x.i"></span>

<span id="x.i-p1"></span>Lecture Eighth

<span id="x.i-p2"></span>We said in our lecture yesterday, that the
Prophet does not in vain bear a testimony again to God’s paternal favor
to his people; for it is our chief happiness, when God acknowledges us
as his own, and when we also can come to his presence with sure
confidence. Hence the order of the Prophet’s words ought to be noticed:
*I will have mercy*, he says, *on Lo-ruchama*; which means, I will be
propitious to the Israelites whom I have hitherto deprived of my favor:
“and I will say to the no-people, *My people are you*: then it follows
*and they will say to me, Thou art our God*  <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md)

<span id="x.i-p4"></span>The Prophet, indeed, means that God anticipates
us with his favor; for we are otherwise restrained from access to him.
Then God of his own good-will precedes, and extends his band to us, and
then follows the consent of our faith. Hence God first speaks to the
Israelites, that they might know that they are now counted his people:
and then, after God has testified of his favor, they answer, ‘Thou
beginnest now to be from henceforth our God.’ We hence see that the
beginning of all good is from God, when he makes of aliens friends, and
adopts as his sons those who were before his enemies.

<span id="x.i-p5"></span>The third chapter follows.

<span id="x.ii"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p1"></span><span id="x.ii-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001.md)<span id="x.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p2"></span>**1.** Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet,
love a woman beloved of *her* friend, yet an adulteress, according to
the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other
gods, and love flagons of wine.

<span id="x.ii-p3"></span>**1.** Et dixit jehova ad me, Adhuc vade, ama
mulierem dilectum a marito (ad verbum, a proximo, *vel*, socio: sed
intelligit comparem) et quae adultera est (sed copula debet resolvi in
adversativam, quae tamen adultera est,) secundum amorem Jehovae erga
filios Israel: et ipsi (hoc est, quitamen) respiciunt ad deos alienos,
et amant lagenas (*vel*, cados) uvarum.

<span id="x.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="x.ii-p5"></span><span id="x.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p6"></span>The substance of this chapter is, that it was
God’s purpose to keep in firm hope the minds of the faithful during the
exile, lest being overwhelmed with despair they should wholly faint. The
Prophet had before spoken of God’s reconciliation with his people; and
he magnificently extolled that favor when he said, ‘Ye shall be as in
the valley of Achor, I will restore to you the abundance of all
blessings; in a word, ye shall be in all respects happy.’ But, in the
meantime, the daily misery of the people continued. God had indeed
determined to remove them into Babylon. They might, therefore, have
despaired under that calamity, as though every hope of deliverance were
wholly taken from them. Hence the Prophet now shows that God would so
restore the people to favor, as not immediately to blot out every
remembrance of his wrath, but that his purpose was to continue for a
time some measure of his severity.

<span id="x.ii-p7"></span>We hence see that this prediction occupies a
middle place between the denunciation the Prophet previously pronounced
and the promise of pardon. It was a dreadful thing, that God should
divorce his people and cast away the Israelites as spurious children:
but a consolation was afterwards added. But lest the Israelites should
think that God would immediately, as on the first day, be so propitious
to them as to visit them with no chastisement, it was the Prophet’s
design expressly to correct this mistake, as though he said, ‘God will
indeed receive you again, but in the meantime a chastisement is prepared
for you, which by its intenseness would break down your spirits were it
not that this comfort will ease you, and that is, that God, though he
punishes you for your sins, yet continues to provide for your salvation,
and to be as it were your husband.’ We now perceive the intention of the
Prophet. But I shall first run over the words, and then return to the
subject

<span id="x.ii-p8"></span>*Jehovah said to me, Go yet and love a woman*.
There is no doubt but that God describes here the favor he promises to
the Israelites in a type or vision: for they are too gross in their
notions, who think that the Prophet married a woman who had been a
harlot. It was then only a vision, as though God had set a picture
before the eyes of the people, in which they might see their own
conduct. And when he says, “yet”, he refers to the vision, mentioned in
the first chapter. But he bids a woman to be loved before he took her to
be the partner of his conjugal bed; which ought to be noticed: for God
intends here to make a distinction between the people’s restoration and
his hidden favor. God then before he restored the people from exile,
loved them as it were in their widowhood. We now understand why the
Prophet does not say, ‘Take to thee a wife,’ but, ‘love a woman.’ The
meaning is this: God intimates, that though exile would be sad and
bitter, yet the people, whom he treated with sharpness and severity,
were still dear to him. Hence, *Love a woman, who had been loved by a
husband*

<span id="x.ii-p9"></span>The word <span id="x.ii-p9.1"></span>רע, *ro,*
is here to be taken for a husband, as it is in the second chapter of
Jeremiah, \[<span id="x.ii-p9.2"></span>[Jer
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#020.md)<span id="x.ii-p9.2"></span>\]
where it is said, ‘Perfidiously have the children of Israel dealt with
me, as though a woman had departed from her husband, <span
id="x.ii-p9.3"></span>מרעה, *meroe,’*, or, ‘from her partner.’ And there
is an aggravation of the crime implied in this word: for women, when
they prostitute themselves, often complain that they have done so
through too much severity, because they were not treated with sufficient
kindness by their husbands; but when a husband behaves kindly towards
his wife, and performs his duty as a husband, there is then less excuse
for a wife, in case she fixes her affections on others. To increase then
the sin of the people, this circumstance is stated that the woman had
been loved by her friend or partner, and yet that this kindness of her
husband had not preserved her mind in chastity.

<span id="x.ii-p10"></span>He afterwards says, *According to the love of
Jehovah towards the children of Israel;* that is, As God loved the
people of Israel, who yet ceased not to look to other gods. This
metaphor occurs often in Scripture, that is, when the verb <span
id="x.ii-p10.1"></span> פנה“panah”, which means in Hebrew, to look to,
is used to express hope or desire: so that when men’s minds are intent
on any thing, or their affections fixed on it, they are said to look to
that. Since then the Israelites boiled with insane ardor for their
superstitions, they are said to look to other gods.

<span id="x.ii-p11"></span>It then follows, *And they love flagons of
grapes*. The Prophet, I doubt not, compares this rage to drunkenness:
and he mentions flagons of grapes rather than of wine, because idolaters
are like drunkards, who sometimes so gorge themselves, that they have no
longer a taste for wine; yea, the very smell of wine offends them, and
produces nausea through excessive drinking; but they try new arts by
which they may regain their fondness for wine. And such is the desire of
novelty that prevails in the superstitious. At one time they go after
this, at another time after that, and their minds are continually tossed
to and fro, because they cannot acquiesce in the only true God. We now
then perceive what this metaphor means, when the Prophet reproaches the
Israelites, because they loved flagons of grapes.

<span id="x.ii-p12"></span>I now return to what the Prophet, or rather
God, had in view. God here comforts the hearts of the faithful, that
they might surely conclude that they were loved, even when they were
chastised. It was indeed necessary that this difference should have been
well impressed on the Israelites, that they might in exile entertain
hope and patiently bear God’s chastisement, and rise that this hope
might mitigate the bitterness of sorrow. God therefore says that though
he shows not himself as yet reconciled to them, but appears as yet
severe, at the same time he is not without love. And hence we learn how
useful this doctrine is, and how widely it opens; for it affords a
consolation of which we all in common have need. When God humbles us by
adversities, when he shows to us some tokens of severity or wrath, we
cannot but instantly fail, were not this thought to occur to us, that
God loves us, even when he is severe towards us, and that though he
seems to cast us away, we are not yet altogether aliens, for he retains
some affection even in the midst of his wrath; so that he is to us as a
husband, though he admits us not immediately into conjugal honor, nor
restores us to our former rank. We now then see how the doctrine is to
be applied to ourselves.

<span id="x.ii-p13"></span>We must at the same time notice the
reproachful conduct of which I have spoken, — That though the woman was
loved yet she could not be preserved in chastity, and that she was
loved, though an adulteress. Here is pointed out the most shameful
ingratitude of the people, and contrasted with it is God’s infinite
mercy and goodness. It was the summit of wickedness in the people to
forsake their God, when he had treated them with so much benignity and
kindness. But wonderful was the patience of God, when he ceased not to
love a people, whom he had found to be so perverse, that they could not
be turned by any acts of kindness nor retained by any favors.

<span id="x.ii-p14"></span>With regard to the flagons of grapes we may
observe, that this strange disposition is ever dominant in the
superstitious, and that is, that they wander here and there after their
own devices, and have nothing fixed in them. Lest, then, such charms
deceive us, let us learn to cleave firmly and constantly to the word of
the Lord. Indeed the Papists of this day boast of their ancientness,
when they would create an ill-will towards us; as though the religion we
follow were new and lately invented: but we see how modern their
superstitions are; for a passion for them bubbles up continually and
they have nothing that remains constant: and no wonder, because the
eternal truth of God is regarded by them as of no value. If, then, we
desire to restrain this depraved lust, which the Prophet condemns in the
Israelites, let us so adhere to the word of the Lord, that no novelty
may captivate us and lead us astray. It now follows —

<span id="x.iii"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p1"></span><span id="x.iii-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
3:2-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#002.md)<span id="x.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p2"></span>**2.** So I bought her to me for fifteen
*pieces* of silver, and *for* an homer of barley, and an half homer of
barley:

<span id="x.iii-p3"></span>**2.** Et acquisivi eam mihi quindecim
argenteis et uno homer (vertunt, corum, Graeci interpretes; uno coro)
hordei et dimidio coro hordei.

<span id="x.iii-p4"></span>**3.** And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide
for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be
for *another* man: so *will* I also *be* for thee.

<span id="x.iii-p5"></span>**3.** Et dixi ad eam, Diebus multis sedebis
mihi, non scortaberis et non eris viro (hoc est, manebis vidua *vel*
coelebs) et ego etiam ad te (nempe, respiciam; *vel*, tibi spondeo me
fore maritum, ubi expertus fuero tuam resipiscentiam: alii vertunt, Et
ego ad te non accedam; sed videtur hoc esse nimis coactum: ideo magis
arridet Hieronymi interpretatio, Ego te expectabo.)

<span id="x.iii-p6"></span>**4.** For the children of Israel shall abide
many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice,
and without an image, and without an ephod, and *without* teraphim:

<span id="x.iii-p7"></span>**4.** Quia diebus multis sedebunt filii
Israel sine rege, et sine principe, et sine sacrificio, et sine statua,
et sine ephod, et sine theraphim.

<span id="x.iii-p8"></span>**5.** Afterward shall the children of Israel
return, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king; and shall
fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter days.

<span id="x.iii-p9"></span>**5.** Postea convertentur (*vel*, redibunt)
filii Israel et quaerent Jehovam Deum suum, et David regem suum, et
timebunt ad Jehovam et ad bonitatem ejus in extermitate dierum.

<span id="x.iii-p10"></span> 

<span id="x.iii-p11"></span><span id="x.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p12"></span>These verses have been read together, for in
these four the Prophet explains the vision presented to him. He says,
first, that he had done what had been enjoined him by God; which was
conveyed to him by a vision, or in a typical form, that by such an
exhibition he might impress the minds of the people: *I bought*, he
says, a wife for fifteen silverings, and for a corus of barley and half
a corus; that is, for a corus  <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) and
a half. He tells us in this verse that he had bought the wife whom he
was to take for a small price. By the *fifteen* silverings and the corus
and half of barley is set forth, I have no doubt, her abject and mean
condition. Servants, we know, were valued at thirty shekels of silver
when hurt by an ox, (<span id="x.iii-p13.1"></span>[Ex
21:32](../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#032)<span id="x.iii-p13.1"></span>..md)
But the Prophet gives her for his wife fifteen silvering; which seemed a
contemptible gift. But then the Lord shows, that though he would but
scantily support his people in exile, they would still be dear to him,
as when a husband loves his wife though he does not indulge her, when
that would be inexpedient: overmuch indulgence, as it is well known, has
indeed often corrupted those who have gone astray. When a husband
immediately pardons an adulterous wife, and receives her with a smiling
countenance, and fawningly humbles himself by laying aside his own right
and authority, he acts foolishly, and by his levity ruins his wife: but
when a husband forgives his wife, and yet strictly confines her within
the range of duty, and restrains his own feelings, such a moderate
course is very beneficial and shows no common prudence in the husband;
who, though he is not cruel, is yet not carried away by foolish love.
This, then is what the Prophet means, when he says, that he had given
for his wife fifteen silverings and a corus and half of barley.
Respectable women did not, indeed, live on barley. The Prophets then,
gave to his wife, not wheat-flour, nor the fine flour of wheat, but
black bread and coarse food; yea, he gave her barley as her allowance,
and in a small quantity, that his wife might have but a scanty living.
We now then understand the Prophet’s meaning.

<span id="x.iii-p14"></span>Some elicit a contrary sense, that the Lord
would splendidly and sumptuously support the wife who had been an
adulteress; but this view by no means harmonizes with the Prophet’s
design, as we have already seen. Besides, the words themselves lead us
another way. Jerome, as his practice is, refines in allegorizing. He
says, that the people were bought for fifteen silverings, because they
came out of Egypt on the fifteenth day of the month; and then he says,
that as the Hebrew homer contains thirty bushels, they were bought for a
corus and half, which is forty-five bushels. because the law was
promulgated forty-five days after. But these are puerile trifles. Let
then the simple view which I have given be sufficient for us, — that
God, though he favored her, not immediately with the honor of a wife and
liberal support, yet ceased not to love her. Thus we see the minds of
the faithful were sustained to bear patiently their calamities; for it
is an untold consolation to know that God loves us. If a testimony
respecting his love moderates not our sorrows, we are very ill-natured
and ungrateful.

<span id="x.iii-p15"></span>The Prophet then more clearly proves in
these words, that God loved his people, though he seemed to be alienated
from them. He might have wholly destroyed them: he yet supplied them
with food in their exile. The people indeed lived in the greatest
straits; and all delicacies were no doubt taken from them, and their
fare was very sordid and very scanty: but the Prophet forbids them to
measure God’s favor by the smallness of what was given them; for though
God would not immediately receive into favor a wife who had been an
adulteress, yet he wished her to continue his wife.

<span id="x.iii-p16"></span><span id="x.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p17"></span>Hence he adds, *I said to her, For many days
shalt thou tarry for me, and thou shalt not become wanton, and thou
shalt not be for any man,* that is, ‘Thou shalt remain a widow; for it
is for this reason that I still retain thee, to find out whether thou
wilt sincerely repent. I would not indeed be too easy towards thee, lest
I should by indulgence corrupt thee: I shall see what thy conduct will
be: you must in the meantime continue a widow.’ This, then was God’s
small favor which remained for the people, even a sort of widowhood. God
might, indeed, as we have said, have utterly destroyed his people: but
he mitigated his wrath and only punished them with exile, and in the
meantime, proved that he was not forgetful of his banished people.
Though then he only bestowed some scanty allowance, he yet did not
wholly deprive them of food, nor suffer them to perish through want.
This treatment then in reality is set forth by this representation, that
the Prophet had bidden his wife to remain single.

<span id="x.iii-p18"></span>He says, *And I also shall be for thee:* why
does he say, *I also?* A wife, already joined to her husband, has no
right to pledge her faith to another. Then the Prophet shows that Israel
was held bound by the Lord, that they might not seek another connection,
for his faith was pledged to them. Hence he says, I also shall be for
thee; that is, ‘I pledge my faith to thee, or, I subscribe myself as thy
husband: but another time must be looked for; I yet defer my favor, and
suspend it until thou givest proof of true repentance.’ “I also”, he
says, “shall be for thee”; that is, ‘Thou shalt not be a widow in vain,
if thou complainest that wrong is done to thee, because I forbid thee to
marry any one else, I also bind myself in turn to thee.’ Now then is
evident the mutual compact between God and his people, so that the
people, though a state of widowhood be full of sorrows ought not yet to
succumb to grief, but to keep themselves exclusively for God, till the
time of their full and complete deliverance, because he says, that he
will remain true to his pledge. “I will then be thine: though at
present, I admit thee not into the honor of wives, I will not yet wholly
repudiate thee.”

<span id="x.iii-p19"></span>But how does this view harmonize with the
first prediction, according to which God seems to have divorced his
people? Their concurrence may be easily explained. The Prophet indeed
said, that the body of the people would be alienated from God: but here
he addresses the faithful only. Lest then the minds of those who were
healable should despond, the Prophet sets before them this comfort which
I have mentioned, — that though they were to continue, as it were,
single, yet the Lord would remain, as it were, bound to them, so as not
to adopt another people and reject them. But we shall presently see that
this prediction regards in common the Gentiles as well as the Jews and
Israelites.

<span id="x.iii-p20"></span><span id="x.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p21"></span>He afterwards adds*, For many days shall the
children of Israel abide* He says, for many days, that they might
prepare themselves for long endurance, and be not dispirited through
weariness, though the Lord should not soon free them from their
calamities. “Though then your exile should be long, still cherish,” he
says, “strong hope in your hearts; for so long a trial must necessarily
be made of your repentance; as you have very often pretended to return
to the Lord, and soon after your hypocrisy was discovered; and then ye
became hardened in your wilful obstinacy: it is therefore necessary that
the Lord should subdue you by a long chastisement.” Hence he says, *The
children of Israel shall abide without a king and without a prince*

<span id="x.iii-p22"></span>But it may still be further asked, What is
the number of the days of which the Prophet speaks, for the definite
number is not stated here; and we know that the exile appointed for the
Jews was seventy years? (<span id="x.iii-p22.1"></span>[Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010)<span id="x.iii-p22.1"></span>..md)
But the Prophet seems here to extend his prediction farther, even to the
time of Christ. To this I answer, that here he refers simply to the
seventy years; though, at the same time, we must remember that those who
returned not from exile were supported by this promise, and hoped in the
promised Mediator: but the Prophet goes not beyond that number,
afterwards prefixed by Jeremiah. It is not to be wondered at, that the
Prophet had not computed the years and days; for the time of the
captivity, that is, of the last captivity, was not yet come. Shortly
after, indeed, four tribes were led away, and then the ten, and the
whole kingdom of Israel was destroyed: but the last ruin of the whole
people was not yet so near. It was therefore not necessary to compute
then the years; but he speaks of a long time indefinitely, and speaks of
the children of Israel and says, *They shall abide without a king and
without a prince:* and inasmuch as they placed their trust in their
king, and thought themselves happy in having this one distinction, a
powerful king, he says, They shall abide without a king, without a
prince. He now explains their widowhood without similitudes: hence he
says, They shall be without a *king* and a *prince,* that is, there
shall be among them no kind of civil government; they shall be like a
mutilated body without a head; and so it happened to them in their
miserable dispersion.

<span id="x.iii-p23"></span>*And without a sacrifice, he says, and*
*without a statue.* The Hebrews take <span id="x.iii-p23.3"></span>מצבה,
*metsabe,* often in a bad sense, though it means generally a statue, as
a monument over a grave is called <span id="x.iii-p23.4"></span>מצבה,
*metsabe,*: but the Prophet seems to speak here of idols, for he
afterwards adds, <span id="x.iii-p23.5"></span> תרפים“teraphim”; and
teraphim were no doubt images, (<span id="x.iii-p23.6"></span>[Ge
31:19-30](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#019.md)<span
id="x.iii-p23.6"></span>,) which the superstitious used while
worshipping their fictitious gods, as we read in many places. The king
of Babylon is said to have consulted the teraphim; and it is said that
Rachel stole the teraphim, and shortly after Laban calls the teraphim
his gods. But the Hebrews talk idly when they say that these images were
made of a constellation, and that they afterwards uttered words: but all
this has been invented, and we know what liberty they take in devising
fables. The meaning is, that God would take away from the people of
Israel all civil order, and then all sacred rites and ceremonies, that
they might abide as a widow, and at the same time know, that they were
not utterly rejected by God without hope of reconciliation.

<span id="x.iii-p24"></span>It is asked, why “ephod” is mentioned; for
the priesthood continued among the tribe of Judah, and the ephod, it is
well known, was a part of the sacerdotal dress. To this I answer, that
when Jeroboam introduced false worship, he employed this artifice — to
make religion among the Israelites nearly like true religion in its
outward form: for it seems to have been his purpose that it should vary
as little as possible from the legitimate worship of God: hence he said,

<span id="x.iii-p25"></span>‘It is grievous and troublesome to you to go
up to Jerusalem; then let us worship God here,’ (<span
id="x.iii-p25.1"></span>[1Ki
12:28](../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#028)<span id="x.iii-p25.1"></span>..md)

<span id="x.iii-p26"></span>But he pretended to change nothing; he would
not appear to be an apostate, departing from the only true God. What
then? “God may be worshipped without trouble by us here; for I will
build temples in several places, and also erect altars: what hinders
that sacrifices should not be offered to God in many places?” There is
therefore no doubt but that he made his altars according to the form of
the true altar, and also added the ephod and various ceremonies, that
the Israelites might think that they still continued in the true worship
of God.

<span id="x.iii-p27"></span><span id="x.iii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p28"></span>But it follows, *Afterwards shall the
children of Israel return and seek Jehovah their God, and David their
king*. Here the Prophet shows by the fruit of their chastisement, that
the Israelites had no reason to murmur or clamour against God, as though
he treated them with too much severity; for if he had stretched out his
hand to them immediately, there would have been in them no repentance:
but when thoroughly cleansed by long correction, they would then truly
and sincerely confess their God. We then see that this comfort is set
forth as arising from the fruit of chastisement, that the Israelites
might patiently bear the temporary wrath of God. *Afterwards*, he says,
*they shall return*; as though he said, “They are now led away headlong
into their impiety, and they can by no means be restrained except by
this long endurance of evils.”

<span id="x.iii-p29"></span>*They shall* therefore *return, and then
will they seek Jehovah their God.* The name of the only true God is set
here in opposition, as before, to all Baalim. The Israelites, indeed,
professed to worship God; but Baalim, we know, were at the same time in
high esteem among them, who were so many gods, and had crept into the
place of God, and extinguished his pure worship: hence the Prophet says
not simply, They shall seek God, but they shall “seek Jehovah their
God”. And there is here an implied reproof in the word <span
id="x.iii-p29.1"></span> אלהים“Elohehem”; for it intimates that they
were drawn aside into ungodly superstitions, that they were without the
true God, that no knowledge of him existed among them; though God had
offered himself to them, yea, had familiarly held intercourse with them,
and brought them up as it were in his bosom, as a father his own
children. Hence the Prophet indirectly upbraids them for this great
wickedness when he says, *They shall seek their God.* And who is this
God? He is even Jehovah. They had hitherto formed for themselves vain
gods: and though, he says, they had been deluded by their own devices,
they shall now know the only true God, who from the beginning revealed
himself to them even as their God. He afterwards adds a second clause
respecting King David: but I cannot now finish the subject.

<span id="x.iv"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="x.iv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou often dost
justly hide thy face from us, so that on every side we see nothing but
evidences of thy dreadful judgment, — O grant, that we, with minds
raised above the scene of this world, may at the same time cherish the
hope which thou constantly settest before us, so that we may feel fully
persuaded that we are loved by thee, however severely thou mayest
chastise us and may this consolation so support and sustain our souls,
that patiently enduring whatever chastisements thou mayest lay upon us,
we may ever hold fast the reconciliation which thou hast promised to us
in Christ thy Son. Amen.

<span id="x.v"></span>

<span id="x.v-p1"></span>Lecture Ninth

<span id="x.v-p2"></span>We have now to consider the second clause,
respecting King David. The Prophet tells us, that when the Israelites
shall be moved with the desire of seeking God, they shall also seek
David their king. They had, as it is well known, departed from their
allegiance to him; though God had set David over the whole people for
this end, — that they might all be happy under his power and dominion,
and remain safe and secure, as though they beheld God with their own
eyes; for David was, as it were, the angel of God. Then the revolt of
the people, or of the ten tribes, was like a renunciation of the living
God. The Lord said to Samuel,

<span id="x.v-p3"></span>‘Thee have they not despised, but rather me,’  
(<span id="x.v-p3.2"></span>[1Sa
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007)<span id="x.v-p3.2"></span>:.md)

<span id="x.v-p4"></span>this must have been much more the case with
regard to David, whom Samuel, by God’s command, had anointed, and whom
the Lord had honored with so many bright commendations; they could not
have cast away his yoke, without openly rejecting, as it were, God
himself. Hence Hosea, speaking of the people’s repentance, does not,
without reasons distinctly mention this, that they shall return to David
their king: for they could not sincerely and from the heart seek God,
without subjecting themselves to that lawful authority to which they had
been bound, not by men, nor by chance, but by God’s command.

<span id="x.v-p5"></span>It is indeed true that David was then dead; but
Hosea sets forth here, in the person of one man, that everlasting
kingdom, which the Jews knew would endure as the sun and moon: for well
known to them all was this remarkable promise,

<span id="x.v-p6"></span>‘As long as the sun and moon shall shine in
heaven, they shall be faithful witnesses to me, that the throne of David
shall continue,’ (<span id="x.v-p6.1"></span>[Ps.
72:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#005.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#018)<span id="x.v-p6.1"></span>..md)

<span id="x.v-p7"></span>Hence, after the death of David, the Prophet
shows here that his kingdom would be forever, for he survived in his
children; and, as it evidently appears, they commonly called their
Messiah the son of David. We must now of necessity come to Christ: for
Israel could not seek their king, David, who had been long dead; but
were to seek that King whom God had promised from the posterity of
David. This prophecy, then, no doubt extends to Christ: and it is
evident that the only hope of the people being gathered was this, that
God had testified that he would give a Redeemer.

<span id="x.v-p8"></span>We now then see what the Prophet had in view:
the Israelites had become degenerate; and, by their perfidy, they ceased
to be the true and genuine people of God, as long as they continued
alienated from the family of David. The Prophet, speaking of their full
restoration, now joins David with God; for they could not be restored to
the body of the Church, without uniting with the Jews in honoring one
and the same head. But we must, at the same time, remember, that the
king, whom the Prophet mentions, is not David, who had been long dead,
but his son, to whom the perpetuity of his kingdom had been promised.

<span id="x.v-p9"></span>This doctrine is especially useful to us; for
it shows that God is not to be sought except in Christ the mediator.
Whosoever, then, forsakes Christ, forsakes God himself; for as John
says,

<span id="x.v-p10"></span>‘He who has not the Son, has not the
Father,’  
(<span id="x.v-p10.2"></span>[1Jo
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#023)<span id="x.v-p10.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.v-p11"></span>And the thing itself proves this; for God
dwells in light inaccessible; how great, then is the distance between us
and him? Except Christ, then, presents himself to us as a middle person,
how can we come to God? But then only we begin really to seek God, when
we turn our eyes to Christ, who willingly offers himself to us. This is
the only way of seeking God aright.

<span id="x.v-p12"></span>Some, with more refinement, contend, that
Christ is Jehovah, because the Prophet says, that he is to be sought not
otherwise than as God is. By the word, seeking, the Prophet indeed
means, that the Israelites had no other way of being safe and secure
than by fleeing under the guardianship and protection of their
legitimate king, whom they knew to have been divinely ordained for them.
This, then, would not be sufficient to confute the Jews. I take the
passage in a simpler way, as meaning, that they would seek their God in
the person of the king, whose hand and efforts God intended to employ in
the preservation of the people.

<span id="x.v-p13"></span>It further follows*, And they shall fear
Jehovah and his goodness in the last day”.* The verb <span
id="x.v-p13.1"></span>פחד, *peched,* means sometimes; to dread, to be
frightened as they are who are so terrified as to lose all courage. But
in this place it is to be taken in a good sense, to fear, as it appears
evident from the context. Then he says, *They shall fear God and his
goodness*. The Israelites had before shaken off the yoke of God: for it
was a proof of wanton contempt in them to build a new temple; to devise,
at their own will, a new religion; and, in a word, to allow themselves
an unbridled licentiousness. Hence he says, They shall hereafter begin
to fear God, and shall continue in his service.

<span id="x.v-p14"></span>And he adds, *and his goodness*; by which he
means that God would not be dreaded by them, but that he would sweetly
allure them to himself, that they might obey him spontaneously and
freely, and even joyfully: and doubtless God does then only make us
really to fear him, when he gives us a taste of his goodness. For God’s
majesty strikes terror into us; and we, in the meantime, seek hiding
places; and were it possible for us to withdraw from him, each of us
would do so gladly; but it is not to worship God with due honor, when we
flee away from him. It is then a sense of his goodness that leads us
reverentially to fear him. ‘With thee,’ says David, ‘is forgiveness,
that thou mayest be feared,’ (<span id="x.v-p14.2"></span>[Ps
130:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#004)<span id="x.v-p14.2"></span>:.md)
for except men know God to be ready to be at peace with them, and feel
assured that he will be propitious to them, no one will seek him, no one
will fear him, for without knowing this, we could not but wish his glory
to be abolished and extinguished, and that he should be without
authority, lest he should become our judge. But every one who has tasted
of God’s goodness, so orders himself as to obey God.

<span id="x.v-p15"></span>What the Prophet then means when he says,
*They shall then fear God*, is this, that they shall understand that
they were miserable as long as they were alienated from him, and that
true happiness is to submit to his authority.

<span id="x.v-p16"></span>But further, this goodness is to be referred
to Christ. Some take <span id="x.v-p16.1"></span>טובו *thubu,* for
glory, as in <span id="x.v-p16.2"></span>[Exodus
33](../../../bib/kjv/exo033.htm#000.md)<span id="x.v-p16.2"></span> \[<span
id="x.v-p16.3"></span>[Ex 32:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#019.md)<span
id="x.v-p16.3"></span>\]; but the connection of this passage requires
the word to be taken in its proper sense. And God’s goodness, we know,
is so exhibited to us in Christ, that not a particle of it is to be
sought for anywhere else: for from this fountain must we draw whatever
refers to our salvation and happiness of life. Let us then know that God
cannot from the heart be worshipped by us, except when we behold him in
the person of his Son, and know him to be a kind Father to us: hence
John says,

<span id="x.v-p17"></span>‘He who honors not the Son, honors not the
Father,’  
(<span id="x.v-p17.2"></span>[Joh
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023)<span id="x.v-p17.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.v-p18"></span>Lastly, he adds, *In the extremity of days*;
for the Prophet wished again to remind the Israelites of what he had
said before, — that they had need of long affliction, by which God would
by degrees reform them. He then shows that their perverseness was such,
that they would not soon be brought into a right mind; but that this
would be *in the extremity of days*. At the same time he relieves the
minds of the godly, that they might not, through weariness, grow faint:
for though they were not at first to taste of God’s goodness, the
Prophet reminds them that there was no reason to despair, because the
Lord would manifest his goodness in the extremity of days. We may add,
that this extremity of days had its beginning at the return of the
people. When liberty was granted to the Jews to return to their own
country, it was the extremity or fulness of days, of which the Prophet
speaks. But a continued series from the people’s return to the coming of
Christ, must at the same time be understood; for the Lord then performed
more fully what he declares here by his Prophet. Hence everywhere in
Scripture, especially in the New Testament, the manifestation of Christ
is placed in the last times. This chapter is now explained. The fourth
now follows.
