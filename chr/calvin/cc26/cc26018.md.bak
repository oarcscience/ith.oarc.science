<span id="xix-p1"></span>Chapter 12

<span id="xix.i"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p1"></span><span id="xix.i-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001.md)<span id="xix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p2"></span>**1.** Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth
after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they
do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.

<span id="xix.i-p3"></span>**1.** Ephraim pascitur vento, et sequitur
orientem: quotidie mendacium et vastitatem multiplicat: foedus cum
Assyrio percutiunt, et oleum in Aegyptum portatur.

<span id="xix.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.i-p5"></span><span id="xix.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p6"></span>The Prophet here inveighs against the vain
hopes of the people, for they were inflated with such arrogance, that
they despised all instruction and all admonitions. It was therefore
necessary, in the first place, to correct this vice, and hence he says,
*Ephraim feeds on wind* For when one gulps the wind, he seems indeed to
fill his mouth, and his throat, and his chest, and his whole stomach;
but there is nothing but air, no nourishment. So he says that Israel
entertained indeed much confidence in their crafty ways, but it was to
feed only on the wind. They dreamt that they were happy, when they
secured confederacies, when they had both the Assyrians and the
Egyptians as their associates. They are only blasts, says the Prophet;
nay, he says, they are noxious blasts; for by the *East* he understands
the east wind, which blows from the rising of the sun; and this, as they
say, is in Judea a dry and often a stormy wind. Other winds either bring
rain or some other advantage: but this wind brings nothing but drought
and storms. It hence then appears that the Prophet meant that Israel,
through this their vain confidence, procured for themselves many sorrows
and ever remained void and empty. *Ephraim then feeds on the wind,* and
further, he *follows after the east wind*

<span id="xix.i-p7"></span>Hosea explains afterwards his mind more
clearly, *He daily multiplies falsehood and desolation,* he says. By
falsehood he glances, I have no doubt, at the impostures by which the
people deceived themselves, as hypocrites do, who, by sharpening their
wits to deceive God, involve themselves in many fatal snares. So also is
Israel said to have multiplied falsehood; for they made themselves so
obstinate, as to become quite hardened against God’s teaching; and this
obstinacy is called falsehood for this reason, for unbelieving men, as
we see, fabricate for themselves many excuses; and though they be
impostures, they yet think themselves safe against all the threatening
of God, provided they set up, I know not what, something which they
think will be sufficiently available. Hence the Prophet repeats again,
that there was nothing but falsehood in all their crafty decrees.

<span id="xix.i-p8"></span>He then presses the point still more, and
says, that it was “desolation”, that is, the cause of desolation. He
then first derides the vain confidence of the people, because they
thought that they could blind the eyes of God by their vain disguises;
“This is falsehood,” he says “this is imposture.” Then he presses them
more heavily and says “This is your perdition: you shall at last
perceive, that you have gained nothing by your counsels but
destruction.”

<span id="xix.i-p9"></span>How so? Because they made a *covenant.* I
take this latter clause as explanatory: for if the Prophet had only
spoken generally, the impiety of the people would not have been
sufficiently exposed; and the masks of secure men must be torn away, and
their crimes, as it were, painted, that they may be ashamed; for except
they are drawn forth as it were before the public, and their turpitude
exposed to the view of all, they will ever hide themselves in their
secret places. This then is the reason why the Prophet here specifically
points out their frauds, which he had before mentioned. *Behold,* he
says, *they made a covenant with the Assyrian, and carry their oil into
Egypt;* that is, they hunt for the friendship of the Assyrian on one
side, and on the other they conciliate with great importunity the
Egyptians; nay, they spare not their own goods, for they carry presents
in order to gain them. We now then understand how Israel had multiplied
falsehood and desolation; for they implicated themselves in illicit
compacts. But why it was unlawful for them to fly to the Assyrians and
Egyptians, we have explained elsewhere, nor is it needful here to repeat
at large what has been said: God wished the people to be under his
protection; and when God promised to be the defender of their safety,
they ought to have been satisfied with his protection alone: but when
they retook themselves to Egypt and to Assyria, it was a clear evidence
of unbelief; for it was the same as to deny the power of God to be
sufficient for them. And we also know that the Israelites never went to
Assyria or to Egypt, except when they meditated the destruction of their
own brethren; for they often laboured to overturn the kingdom of Judah:
they only sought associates to gratify their own cruelty. But this one
reason, however, was abundantly sufficient to condemn them, that they
fortified themselves by foreign aids, when God was willing to keep them
as it were inclosed under his own wings. Whenever then we attempt to
provide for ourselves by unlawful means, it is the same thing as if we
denied God; for he calls and invites us to come under his protection:
but when we run in our thoughts here and there, and seek some vain
helps, we grievously dishonour God: it is, as it were, to fly into Egypt
or into Assyria. And for this purpose ought the doctrine of this verse
to be applied. It follows —

<span id="xix.ii"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p1"></span><span id="xix.ii-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#002.md)<span id="xix.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p2"></span>**2.** The Lord hath also a controversy with
Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his
doings will he recompense him.

<span id="xix.ii-p3"></span>**2.** Contentio Jehovae cum Jehudah, et ad
visitandum super Jacob: secundum vias ejus, secundum opera ejus rependet
ei.

<span id="xix.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.ii-p5"></span><span id="xix.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p6"></span>It may seem strange that the Prophet should
now say, that God *had a controversy with Judah;* for he had before
said, that Judah stood faithful with the saints. It seems indeed
inconsistent, that God should litigate with the Jews, and yet declare
them to be upright and separate them from the perfidious and ungodly.
What then does this mean? The Prophet, as we have said, spake
comparatively of the tribe of Judah, when he said that they remained
faithful with the saints: for he did not intend wholly to exculpate the
Jews, who were also full of grievous evils; but he intended to praise
the worship which as yet prevailed at Jerusalem, that the impiety of the
ten tribes might appear less excusable, who of their own accord had
departed from the rule which God had given.

<span id="xix.ii-p7"></span>When any one at this day reproves the
Papists, they say, that another mode of worship is unknown to them, and
that they have been thus taught by their forefathers, and that the
worship which they observe has so continued from antiquity, that they
dare not either to change it or to deviate from it. Such might have been
the excuse made by the Israelites. But the prophet charges them with
voluntary defection, for the temple which God had chosen for himself
stood in their sight; there the face of God was in a manner to be seen;
for all things were arranged according to the heavenly pattern which had
been shown to Moses in the mount. Since then pure religion was before
their eyes, was not their sin proved by this very fact, that having
neglected the word of God, they gave themselves up to new and fictitious
modes of worship? The Prophet then had before praised the worship, but
not the manners, of the tribe of Judah; and he now comes to their
manners, and says, that there were many things in Judah which God would
chastise.

<span id="xix.ii-p8"></span>*The Lord* then *hath a controversy with
Judah;* and he will begin with that tribe, and will then come down to
*the house of Jacob* The Prophet, however, speaks here only in passing
of the house of Judah, and touches but lightly on the controversy he had
with that portion of the people. How was this? Because he was not a
teacher, as it has been said already, set over the kingdom of Judah, but
only over the Israelites. He now refers only to that kingdom for the
purpose of striking terror into his own people: as though he said “Think
ye that the forbearance of God is to be forever, because he has hitherto
borne with you? Nay, God will begin to contend with the tribe of Judah.
I have said, indeed, that they are innocent compared with you; but yet
they shall not escape punishment; for in a short time God will summon
them to judgement. If he will not spare the Jews, how can your great
crimes go unpunished? For certainly you deserve hundred deaths in
comparison with the Jews, among whom at least some integrity and
uprightness exist; for they have made no change in the worship of God.
Their life is corrupt; but yet the law of God and religion are not
despised by them as they are by you. If then God will not spare them,
much less will he spare you.”

<span id="xix.ii-p9"></span>We now understand for what purpose the
Prophet says that God *had a controversy with Judah;* for it was not his
design to terrify the Jews themselves, or to exhort them to repentance,
except it may be by the way; but his object was to present an example to
the Israelites, that they might fear; for they ought to have thought
within themselves, “If this shall be done in the green, what shall
become of the dry tree? (<span id="xix.ii-p9.1"></span>[Lu
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031)<span id="xix.ii-p9.1"></span>..md)
If God will exercise with so much severity his vengeance against our
brethren the Jews, among whom pure religion as yet exists, what sort of
end and how dreadful is that which awaits us, who have departed from the
law, the worship, the teaching, and the obedience of God, who are become
truce-breakers, and degenerate, and in every way profane?”

<span id="xix.ii-p10"></span>Hence he immediately adds, *And will punish
Jacob* “God will indeed begin with the tribe of Judah; this will be the
prelude, and he will treat the Jews more mildly than you; but against
you he will thunder in full force. It will not then be a remonstrance to
draw you to repentance, but a punishment such as ye deserve; for he has
already contended with you more than enough.”

<span id="xix.ii-p11"></span>*According to his ways. according to his
doings, will he recompense him.* He sets down here *ways* and *doings,*
with no superfluous repetition, but to show that the repentance of this
people had been already more than sufficiently looked for; for they had
not ceased for a long time to pursue their own wickedness. The Prophet
then, no doubt, condemns here the Jews for their perverse wickedness,
that they never left off their sins, though they had now for a long time
been admonished, and had been often reproved by the Prophets. It now
follows —

<span id="xix.iii"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p1"></span><span id="xix.iii-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
12:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003.md)<span id="xix.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p2"></span>**3.** He took his brother by the heel in
the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:

<span id="xix.iii-p3"></span>**3.** In utero apprehendit plantam fratri
suo; et in fortitudine sua dominatus est cum Deo (*quanquam nomen* <span
id="xix.iii-p3.1"></span>אלהים*, Aleim, transfertur etiam saepe ad
Angelos.*)

<span id="xix.iii-p4"></span>**4** Yea, he had power over the angel, and
prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him *in*
Bethel, and there he spake with us;

<span id="xix.iii-p5"></span>**4** Et dominatus est cum Angelo (*vel*,
adversus Angelum; *vel,* luctatus est, *si quis malit, quanquam ad
verbum ita habetur; sed quia sequitur* <span
id="xix.iii-p5.1"></span>יוכל*, iucal, praevaluit, ideo libenter admitto
luctandi verbum, non quod proprie conveniat, sed rem potius respicio
quam verba*) et praevaluit; flevit et rogavit eum: in Bethel invenit
eum, et illic locutus est cum eo;

<span id="xix.iii-p6"></span>**5** Even the Lord God of hosts; the Lord
*is* his memorial.

<span id="xix.iii-p7"></span>**5** Et Jehova Deus exercituum; Jehova
memoria ejus.

<span id="xix.iii-p8"></span> 

<span id="xix.iii-p9"></span><span id="xix.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p10"></span>In all this discourse the Prophet condemns
the ingratitude of the people; and then he shows how shamefully they had
departed from the example of their father, in whose name they yet took
pride. This is the substance. Their ingratitude is showed in this, that
they did not acknowledge that they had been anticipated,  <span
id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md) in the person of their father Jacob, by
the gratuitous mercy of God. The first history is indeed referred to for
this end, that the posterity of Jacob might understand that they had
been elected by God before they were born. For Jacob did not, by choice
or design, lay hold on the heel of his brother in his mother’s womb; but
it was an extraordinary thing. It was then God who guided the hand of
the infant, and by this sign testified his adoption to be gratuitous. In
short, by saying that Jacob held the foot of his brother in his mother’s
womb, the same thing is intended, as if God had reminded the Israelites,
that they did not excel other people by their own virtue or that of
their parents; but that God of his own good pleasure had chosen them.
The same is alleged against them by Malachi,

<span id="xix.iii-p12"></span>‘Were not Jacob and Esau brethren? Yet
Jacob I loved, and Esau I regarded with hatred,’ (<span
id="xix.iii-p12.1"></span>[Mal. 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003)<span id="xix.iii-p12.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.iii-p13"></span>For we know wish what haughtiness this
nation has ever exalted itself. “But whence have ye arisen? Look back to
your origin: ye are indeed the children of Abraham and Isaac. In what
then do ye differ from the Idumeans? They have certainly been begotten
by Esau; and Esau was the son of Isaac and the brother of Jacob, and
indeed the first-born. Ye then do not excel as to any dignity that may
exist in you. Own then your origin, and know that whatever excellency
may be in you proceeds from the mere favour of God, and this ought to
bind you more and more to him. Whence then is this pride?”

<span id="xix.iii-p14"></span>Even thus does our Prophet now speak,
*Jacob held the foot of his brother in his mother’s womb;* that is, “You
have a near relationship with Esau and his posterity; but they are
detested by you. Whence is this? Is it for some merit of your own? Boast
when you can show that any thing has proceeded from you which could gain
favour before God. Nay, your father Jacob, a most holy man indeed, while
yet in his mother’s womb, laid hold on the foot of his brother Esau;
that is, when he became superior to his brother and gained
primogeniture, he was not grown up, and could do nothing by his own
choice or power, for he was then inclosed in his mother’s womb, and had
no worthiness, no merit. Your ingratitude is now then the more base, for
God had put you under obligations to him before ye were born; in the
person of the holy patriarch he chose you for his possession. But now,
having forsaken him, and relinquished the worship which he has taught in
his law, ye abandon yourselves to idols and impious superstitions. Bring
now your pretences by which ye cover your impiety! Is not your baseness
so gross and palpable, that you ought to be ashamed of it?” We now then
understand the end for which the Prophet said that *Esau’s foot was laid
hold on by Jacob in his mother’s womb*

<span id="xix.iii-p15"></span>Moreover, this passage clearly shows that
men do not gain the favour of God by their free-will, but are chosen by
his goodness alone before they are born, and chosen, not on account of
works, as the Papists imagine, who concede some election to God, but
think that it depends on future works. But if it be so, the charge of
the Prophet was frigid and jejune. Now since God through his good
pleasure alone anticipates men, and adopts those whom he pleases, not on
account of works, but through his own mercy, it hence follows that those
who have been chosen are more bound to him, and that they are less
excusable when they reject the favour offered to them.

<span id="xix.iii-p16"></span>But here someone may object and say, that
it is strange that the posterity of Jacob should be said to have been
elected in his person, and yet they had in the meantime departed from
God; for the election of God in this case would not be sure and
permanent; and we know that whom God elects he also justifies, and their
salvation is so secured, that none of them can perish; all the elect are
also delivered to Christ as their preserver, that he may keep them by
his divine power, which is invincible, as John teaches in chapter 10.
 <span id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) What then does this mean? Now we
know, and it has been before stated, that the election of God as to that
people was twofold; for the one was general, and the other special. The
election of holy Jacob was special, for he was really one of the
children of God; special also was the election of those who are called
by Paul the children of the promise, (<span
id="xix.iii-p17.2"></span>[Ro 9:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#008.md)<span
id="xix.iii-p17.2"></span>.) There was another, a general election; for
he received his whole seed into his faith, and offered to all his
covenant. At the same time, they were not all regenerated, they were not
all gifted with the Spirit of adoption. This general election was not
then efficacious in all. Solved now is the matter in debate, that no one
of the elect shall perish; for the whole people were not elected in a
special manner; but God knew whom he had chosen out of that people; and
them he endued, as we have said, with the Spirit of adoption, and
supplied with his own grace, that they might never fall away. Others
were indeed chosen in a certain way, that is, God offered to them the
covenant of salvation; but yet through their ingratitude they caused God
to reject them, and to disown them as children.

<span id="xix.iii-p18"></span>But the Prophet subjoins, that Jacob *by
his strength had power with God, and had prevailed also with the angel*
He reproaches here the Israelites for making a false claim to the name
of Jacob, since they had nothing in common with him, but had shamefully
departed from his example. He *had then power with the angel and with
God himself;* and he prevailed over the angel. But what sort of persons
were they? As the heathen Poets called the Romans, when they became
degenerated and effeminate, Romulidians, and said that they had sprung
from those remarkable and illustrious heroes, whose prowesses were then
well known, and for the same reason called them Scipiadians; so also the
Prophet says, “Come now, ye children of Jacob, what sort of men are ye?
He was endued with a heroic, yea, with an angelic power, and even more
than angelic; for he wrestled with God and gained the victory: but ye
are the slaves of idols; the devil retains you devoted to himself; ye
are, as it were, in a bawdy house; for what else is your temple but a
brothel? And then ye are like adulterers, and daily commit adultery with
your idols. Your abominations, what are they but filthy chains, and
which grove that there is no knowledge and no heart in you? For you must
have been fascinated, when ye forsook God and adopted new and profane
modes of worship.” This difference between the holy patriarch Jacob and
his posterity must be marked, otherwise we shall not understand the
object of the Prophet; and it will avail but little to collect various
opinions, except first we know what the Prophet meant, and what was the
purport of this upbraiding, and of this narrative, that Jacob had power
with God and the angel.

<span id="xix.iii-p19"></span>But it must be noticed, that God and angel
are here mentioned in the same sense; we may, indeed, render it angel in
both places; for <span id="xix.iii-p19.1"></span>אלהים, *Aleim,* as well
as <span id="xix.iii-p19.2"></span>מלאך, *melac,* signifies an angel.
But, however, every doubt is removed by the Prophet, when he at last
adds, *Jehovah, God of hosts, Jehovah is his name,* for here the Prophet
expressly mentions the essential name of God, by which he testifies,
that the same was the eternal and the only true God, who yet was at the
same time an angel. But it may be asked, How was he the eternal God, and
at the same time an angel? It occurs, indeed, so frequently in
Scripture, that it must be well known to us, that when the Lord appeared
by his angel, the name of Jehovah was given to them, not indeed to all
the angels indiscriminately but to the chief angel, by whom God
manifested himself. This, as I have said, must be well known to us. It
then follows that this angel was truly and essentially God. But this
would not strictly apply to God, except there be some distinction of
persons. There must then be some person in the Deity, to which this name
and title of an angel can apply; for if we take the name, God, without
difference or distinction, and regard it as denoting his essence, it
would certainly be inconsistent to say, that he is God and an angel too;
but when we distinguish persons in the Deity, there is no inconsistency.
How so? Because Christ, the eternal Wisdom of God, did put on the
character of a Mediator, before he put on our flesh. He was therefore
then a Mediator, and in that capacity he was also an angel. He was at
the same time Jehovah, who is now God manifested in the flesh.

<span id="xix.iii-p20"></span>But we must, on the other hand, refute the
delirium, or the diabolical madness of that caviller, Servetus, who
imagined that Christ was from the beginning an angel, as if he was a
phantom, and a distinct person, having an essence apart from the Father;
for he says, that he was formed from three untreated elements. This
diabolical conceit ought to be wholly discarded by us. But Christ,
though he was God, was also a Mediator; and as a Mediator, he is rightly
and fitly called the angel or the messenger of God, for he has of his
own accord placed himself between the Father and men.

<span id="xix.iv"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="xix.iv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as thou
showest thyself to us at this day so kindly as a Father, having
presented to us a singular and an invaluable pledge of thy favour in thy
only begotten Son, — O grant, that we may entirely devote ourselves to
thee, and truly render thee that free service and obedience which is due
to a Father, so that we may have no other object in life but to confirm
that adoption, with which thou hast once favoured us, until we at
length, being gathered into thy eternal kingdom, shall partake of its
fruit, together with Christ Jesus thy Son. Amen.

<span id="xix.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="xix.v"></span>

<span id="xix.v-p1"></span>Lecture Thirty-second

<span id="xix.v-p2"></span>Yesterday we explained how it seemed proper
to call him who appeared to holy Jacob in Bethel both God and an angel;
for the name, Jehovah by which is expressed the eternal power, essence,
and majesty of God, could not be transferred to a mere angel. It is
hence certain that he was the only true God. But it could not be, that
he was simply and without any distinction called an angel; but as Christ
even then sustained the character of a Mediator, he was not
inconsistently called an angel; and yet we know that he is the eternal
God. So this passage is worthy of being remembered, as it bears
testimony to the divinity of Christ; for the Prophet clearly affirms
that he is Jehovah, the Creator of heaven and earth, and that he is so
by his own power; and that he does not subsist in another, as all
creatures do. Since then he is so, his sovereignty is proved, so that he
is not inferior to the Father.

<span id="xix.v-p3"></span>But he says, that this is his *memorial,* or
remembrance. This expression has reference to men; the Prophet then
means, that this wonderful and magnificent name would be well known in
the world, when Christ should be revealed. The people, indeed, even then
acknowledged that the true God appeared to their father Jacob; but the
knowledge of a Mediator was hitherto obscure. The Prophet then seems to
have respect here to the coming of Christ; as though he said, that the
name, Jehovah, would be widely known to all, when the Mediator would be
more clearly exhibited. But I will come now to the other parts of the
passage.

<span id="xix.v-p4"></span>The Prophet says that he *was a prince,* or
*had power*, *by his strength with God.* What this saying imports, I
shall shortly explain. The name, Israel, was given to Jacob, because of
the victory he obtained in that noble wrestling, of which mention is
made in <span id="xix.v-p4.1"></span>[Genesis
32](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#000.md)<span id="xix.v-p4.1"></span>:
 <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) for the holy man had not a contest
with a mortal being, but with God himself; and he overcame in that
combat, and is hence called the conqueror of God. As this mode of
speaking is harsh, some have endeavoured by a comment to turn it to
something more moderate, that is, that Jacob was a *prince with God,*
meaning, that God approved of his unwonted courage. But God meant to
express something more, when he gave this name to his servant; for he
confessed that he gave way, being, as it were, overcome, and yielded the
palm of victory to holy Jacob. And this ought not to appear strange to
us; for we know that whenever God proves our faith, and tries us by
temptations, these are so many combats by which he contends with us; for
he seeks to find out what is the strength of our faith. Now? when we are
said to wrestle with God, and the issue of the contest be such, that God
leaves the victory to us, we are not then improperly called conquerors,
yea, even of God himself. But how? Because God works wonderfully in his
saints, so that by his own power he casts down himself; and while he
wrestles with us, he supplies us with strength, by which we are enabled
to bear the weight and pressure of the contest. Were God to assail us,
what would he find but weakness? But when he calls us to the struggle,
he at the same time supplies us with the necessary arms.

<span id="xix.v-p6"></span>And it is a wonderful marshalling of the
contest, when God on one side makes himself an antagonist, and, on the
other, fights in us against his own temptations, or against all those
wrestlings by which he tries our faith. Hence God is said to be overcome
by us, when, by the power and aid of his own Spirit, he strengthens and
renders us unconquerable; yea, when he makes us to triumph over
temptations, and when we consider everything, such is the state of the
case, that God will have the greater portion of strength to be on our
side, and that he only takes the weaker portion to tempt and try us.
There is not indeed, in this case, to be imagined by us, any such
separation, as if God was divided against himself; but we know, that
when he tries our faith, he comes forth as if he were a contender, or as
if he challenged us to the contest. This is indeed certain. For what are
temptations, or what is their object, but to afford us an occasion to
exhibit, as on a field of battle, an example and proof of our strength
and firmness? But this could not be done without an adversary; for what
advantage would it be to fight with a shadow? or when no one engages
with us? Hence God is like an adversary whenever he tries our faith;
and, as it has been said before, we have this contest not with men, but
with God himself. We have indeed to contend with the devil; for Paul
says, that we have to fight not (only) with flesh and blood, but with
mighty powers, (<span id="xix.v-p6.1"></span>[Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012)<span id="xix.v-p6.1"></span>..md)
This is doubtless true; but the Lord, at the same time, holds the first
place, as that remarkable passage in Job testified, ‘The Lord gave, the
Lord has taken away,’ (<span id="xix.v-p6.2"></span>[Job
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#021)<span id="xix.v-p6.2"></span>..md)
So, then, we must engage with God himself. How so? Because he tries and
proves us. But he does not tempt us, as James says, (<span
id="xix.v-p6.3"></span>[Jas. 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#013.md),
Jas. 14:0<span id="xix.v-p6.3"></span>;) for a person is tempted when he
is drawn away by his own lust. He does not tempt us to evil; he does not
instil into us corrupt desires, which grow up spontaneously, and which
are innate in our nature: but he tempts, that is, proves us, as he is
said to have tempted Abraham, (<span id="xix.v-p6.4"></span>[Ge
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001)<span id="xix.v-p6.4"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.v-p7"></span>Since it is so, we must now wrestle with God;
but for what end? That we may conquer: for God intends not to overwhelm
us, while he is making known our faith and constancy of obedience; but,
on the contrary, he builds a theatre, on which to show his gifts. We
therefore come to the struggle with the hope of overcoming. That we may
overcome, he, as I have said, not only exhorts us to be strong, but
supplies us also with arms, endues us with strength, and also fights
himself, in a manner, with us, and is powerful in us, and enables us to
overcome our temptations. For this reason, Jacob is said to have power
with God, or to have been God’s conqueror.

<span id="xix.v-p8"></span>But what the Prophet adds may seem strange,
that this was done by *his strength.* He had power with God, he says, by
his own strength. But if Israel had fought by his own valour, he could
not have borne even the shadow of God, for he must have fallen. He must
have been brought to nothing, had he not power greater than that of man.
What, then, does this mean, that he was a conqueror by his own strength?
We grant, that this strength, of which the Prophet speaks, may be
ascribed to holy Jacob when he gained dominion. There is no better
title, as they commonly say, than that of donation; and God is wont to
transfer to us whatever he bestows, as if it were our own. It is then
necessary to distinguish wisely here between the strength which man has
in himself, and that which God confers on him. The Papists, as soon as
any mention is made of the strength or power of man, instantly lay hold
on it, and say, “If there is no freewill in man, there is no strength,
or there is no power to resist.” But they betray their own stupidity and
thoughtlessness, inasmuch as they cannot distinguish between the
intrinsic strength which is in man himself by nature, and the
adventitious strength with which God endues men, and which is the gift
of the Holy Spirit. And the Prophet, when he here commends the strength
of holy Jacob, does not extol his free-will, as though he derived
strength from himself, by which he overcame God; but he means that he
was divinely endued with unconquerable power, so that he came forth a
conqueror in the contest. We now then apprehend the meaning of the
Prophet.

<span id="xix.v-p9"></span><span id="xix.v-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xix.v-p10"></span>And since this was especially worthy of
being remembered, he repeats, that *he had power with the angel, and
prevailed*. But we have already said how Jacob prevailed not indeed of
himself, but because God had so distributed his power, that the greater
part was in Jacob himself. I am therefore wont, when I speak of the
wrestling and of the daily contests with which God exercises the godly,
to adduce this similitude, — That God fights with us with his left hand,
and defends us with his right hand, that is, he assails us in a weak
manner, (so to speak,) and at the same time stretches forth his right
hand to defend us: he displays, in the latter instance, his greater
power, that we may become victorious in the struggle. And this mode of
speaking, though at the first view it seems harsh, does yet wonderfully
set forth the grace and goodness of God, inasmuch as he deigns to humble
himself for our sake, so as to choose to concede to us the praise of
victory; not indeed that we may become proud of ourselves, but that he
may be thus more glorified, when he prefers exercising his power in
defending us rather than in overwhelming us, which he could do with one
breath of his mouth. For he has no need of making any effort to reduce
us to nothing: if he only chooses to blow on the whole human race, the
whole world would in a moment be extinguished. But the Lord fights with
us, and at the same time suffers us not to be crushed; nay, he raises us
up on high, and, as I have already said, concedes to us the victory. Let
us now go on.

<span id="xix.v-p11"></span>The Prophet adds, that he wept and
entreated: *He wept,* he says, *and made supplication unto him* Some
explain this clause of the angel; but I know not whether weeping was
suitable to him. The saying may be indeed defended that the angel was as
it were a suppliant, when he yielded up the conquest to the holy man;
for it was the same as though he who owns himself unequal in a contest
were to throw himself on the ground. Then they explain weeping thus,
“The angel entreated the patriarch when he said, ‘Let me go;’ and this
was a confession of victory.” The sense would then be, that the
patriarch Jacob did not gain any ordinary thing when he came forth a
conqueror in the struggle; for God was in a manner the suppliant, for he
conceded to him the name and praise of a conqueror. But I prefer
explaining this of the patriarch, and to do so is, in my judgement, more
suitable. It is not indeed said that Jacob wept; that is, it is not, I
own, stated distinctly and expressly by Moses; but weeping may be taken
for that humility which the faithful ever bring to the presence of God:
and then weeping was meet for the patriarch; for he so gained the
victory in the combat, that he did not depart without grief and loss,
inasmuch as we know that his leg was put out of joint, and that his
thigh was dislocated so that he was lame all his life. Jacob then
obtained the victory, and there triumphed with God’s approbation: but
yet he departed not whole, for God had left him lame. He felt then no
small grief, since this weakness in his body continued through life.
Hence weeping did not ill become the holy man, who was humbled in the
struggle, though he carried away the palm of victory.

<span id="xix.v-p12"></span>And this ought to be carefully noticed; for
here the Prophet meets all calumnies, when he so moderates the sentence,
that he takes away nothing from God and his glory, though he thus
splendidly adorns the victory of the patriarch. He was then *a prince
with God;* he *prevailed* also, he became a conqueror, — but how? He
*yet wept and entreated him;* which means, that there was no cause for
pride that he carried away the palm of victory from the contest, but
that God led him to humility even by the dislocation of his thigh or
leg: and so he entreated him. The praying of Jacob is related by Moses,
which he made, when he asked to be blessed. But the less, as the Apostle
says, is blessed by the greater, (<span id="xix.v-p12.1"></span>[Heb
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#007)<span id="xix.v-p12.1"></span>..md)
Then Jacob did not exalt himself, as blind men do, who claim merit to
themselves; but he prayed to God, and asked to be blessed by Him, who
owned himself to be overcome. And this ought to be carefully observed,
especially the additional circumstance; for we hence learn that there is
no cause why they who are proved by temptations should flee away from
God, though our flesh indeed seeks ease, and desires to be spared.

<span id="xix.v-p13"></span>But when a temptation is at hand, we
withdraw ourselves, and there is no one who would not gladly make a
truce, and also hide himself at a distance from the presence of God.
Inasmuch then as we desire God to be far from us, when he comes forth as
an antagonist to try our faith, this praying of Jacob ought to be
remembered; for though he had his leg disjointed, though he was worn out
with weariness, he did not yet withdraw himself, he did not wish the
departure of the angel, but retained him as it were by force: “Thou
shalt bless me; I would rather contend with thee, and be wholly
consumed, than to let thee go before thou blesses me.” We hence see that
we ought to seek the presence of God; though he may severely try us,
though we may suffer much, though our strength fail, though we may be
made lame through life, we ought not yet to shun the presence of God,
but rather embrace him with both arms, and retain him as it were by
force; for it is much better to groan under our burden, and to feel his
power who is above us, than to continue free from toil, and to rot in
our pleasures, as they do whom God forsakes. And we see how much such an
indulgence ought to be dreaded by us; for unless we are daily sharpened
by various temptations, we immediately gather rust and other evils. It
is therefore necessary, in order that we may continue in a sound state,
that our contests should be daily renewed: and hence I have said, that
we ought to seek the presence of God, however severe the wresting may
be.

<span id="xix.v-p14"></span>It follows, *He found him in Bethel* To
remove every ambiguity, I would render it, “In Bethel he had found him.”
It is indeed a verb in the future tense; but it is certain that the
Prophet speaks of the past. But when we take the past tense, ambiguity
in the language still remains; for some thus understand the place, that
God had afterwards found Jacob in Bethel, or, that Jacob had found God;
that is, when the name of Israel was confirmed to him, after the
destruction of the town of Sichem; for, to console his grief, God
appeared to him there again. They then explain this of a second vision
in that place. But it seems to me that the Prophet had another thing in
view, even this, that God had already found Jacob in Bethel, that he had
met him when he fled to Syria, and went away through the fear of his
brother. It was then for the first time that God appeared to his
servant, and exhorted him to faithfulness: he promised to him a safe
return to his own country. The Prophet then means, that Jacob gained the
victory, because God had long before began to embrace him in his love,
and also testified his love when he had manifested himself to him in
Bethel. Hence he found him in Bethel. This might indeed be referred to
Jacob, “He found him in Bethel;” that is, he found God. But as it is
immediately added, *There he spake with us,* and as this cannot be
applied to any other than to God himself, I am inclined to add also,
that God had found Jacob in Bethel. And the Prophet commends to us again
the gratuitous goodness of God towards Jacob, because he deigned to meet
him on his way, and to show that he was the leader of Jacob on his
journey: for he did not think previously that God was nigh him, as he
says himself,

<span id="xix.v-p15"></span>‘This is the house of God, and the gate of
heaven,  
and I knew it not,’ (<span id="xix.v-p15.2"></span>[Gen.
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#017)<span id="xix.v-p15.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.v-p16"></span>When therefore the holy man thought himself
to be as it were cast away by God, and destitute of all aid, when he was
alone and without any hope, God is said to have found him; for of his
own good will he presented himself to him, when the holy man hoped no
such thing, nor conceived such a thing in his mind. Hence God had
already found his servant in Bethel; and there he spake, or (that the
same strain may be continued) had spoken to him.

<span id="xix.v-p17"></span>*There he had spoken with us*. Some take
<span id="xix.v-p17.1"></span>עמנו, *omnu,* for <span
id="xix.v-p17.2"></span>עמו, *omu*  <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md)
, he had spoken with him; and they do this, being forced by necessity;
for they find no sense in the words that God spake with us in Bethel.
But there is no need to change the words contrary to rules of grammar.
Others who dare not to depart from the words of the Prophet, imagine a
sense wholly different. Some say, “He spake with us there;” that is,
“The Lord speaks by me, Hosea, and by Amos, who is my colleague and
friend: for we denounce on you, by his authority, utter ruin and
destruction; and God has made known to us at Bethel whatever we bring to
you.” But how strained is this, all must see: this is to wrest
Scripture, and not to explain it. Others also speak still more frigidly:
“There he spake with us,” as though the angel had said, “Wait, the Lord
will speak with us; I have called thee Israel, but the Lord will at
length come, who will ratify what I now say to thee:” as if he was not
indeed the eternal God; but this he immediately expresses when he says
*Jehovah is his memorial, Jehovah of hosts* But thus the Jews trifle,
who are like irrational beings whenever there is a reference made to
Christ.

<span id="xix.v-p19"></span>There does not seem, however, to be any
great reason why we should toil much about the Prophet’s words: and some
even of the Rabbis (not to deprive them of their just praise) have
observed this to be the meaning, That the Lord had so spoken with Jacob,
that what he said belonged to the whole people. For doubtless whatever
God then promised to his servant appertained to the whole body of the
people, and all his posterity. Why then do interpreters so greatly
torment themselves, when it is evident that God spake through the person
of one man with all the posterity of Abraham? And this agrees best with
the context; for the Prophet now applies, so to speak, to the whole
people what he had hitherto recorded of the patriarch Jacob. That they
might not then think that the history of one man was related, he says
that it belongs to all. How so? Because the Lord had so spoken with holy
Jacob, that his voice ought to resound in the ears of all. For what was
said to the holy man? Did God only reveal himself to him? Did he promise
to be a Father only to him? Nay, he adopted his whole seed, and extended
his favour to all his posterity. Since then he had so spoken to all the
Israelites, they ought now to be more ashamed of their defection,
inasmuch as they had so much degenerated from their father, with whom
they were yet connected. For there was a sacred bond of unity between
Jacob and his children, since God embraced them all in his love, and
favoured them all with his adoption. We now perceive the mind of the
Prophet. Let us proceed —

<span id="xix.vi"></span>

<span id="xix.vi-p1"></span><span id="xix.vi-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
12:6-7](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#006.md)<span id="xix.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.vi-p6"></span> 

<span id="xix.vi-p7"></span><span id="xix.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xix.vi-p8"></span>The Prophet is now here urgent on the
people. Having referred to the example of the patriarch, he shows how
unlike him were his posterity, with whom God could avail nothing by
sound teaching, though he was constantly solicitous for their salvation,
and stirred up his Prophets to bring back the lost and scattered to the
way of safety. Since then it was so, the Prophet accuses them of
ingratitude. But he speaks first of repentance; and then he shows that
he and other ministers of God had laboured in vain; for such was the
perversity of the people, that teaching had no effect. His sermon is
short, but yet it contains much.

<span id="xix.vi-p9"></span>*Turn,* he says, *to thy God.* He glances
here at the apostasy of the people, by bidding them to turn to their
God, and, at the same time, condemns whatever the Israelites were wont
to set up as a defence, when the Prophets reproved them. For they wished
their own fictitious modes of worship to come in as a reason; they
wished the gods devised by themselves to occupy the place of the true
God. The Prophet cuts off the handle from subterfuges of this kind by
commanding the people to turn to their God. “Why,” he says, “you do
indeed worship gods, and greatly weary yourselves in your superstitions;
but confess that you are apostates, who have rejected the law delivered
to you by the true God. *Return,* then, *to your God.”* And he calls God
the God of Israel, not to honour them, but to-reproach them, because
they had willingly and designedly cast off the worship of the true God,
who had made himself known to them.

<span id="xix.vi-p10"></span>There is afterwards shown the true way of
repentance. The beginning of the verse, as I have already said, requires
the people to repent; but as we know that men trifle with God when they
are called to repentance, it is not in vain that a definitive, or, at
least, a short description of repentance, is added by which is made
evident what it is to repent, or to turn to God. Then the Prophet says,
— *Keep mercy,* or *kindness* *and judgement* He begins with the second
table, and then he adds piety towards God. But he lays down two things
only, in which he included the whole teaching of the second table. For
what is God’s design, from the fifth to the last commandment, but to
teach us to shape our life according to the rule of love? We are then
taught in the second table of the law how we ought to act towards our
brethren; or if one wishes to have a shorter summary, in the second
table of the law are shown the mutual duties of men. But the Prophet
begins here with the second part of the law; for the Prophets are not
wont strictly to observe order, Nor do they always observe a regular
method; but it is enough with them to mention the main things by which
they explain their subject; and hence, it is no wonder that the Prophet
here, according to his usual manner, mentions love in the first place,
and then goes on to the worship of God. This order, as I have said, is
not indeed either natural or legitimate; but this is of no importance;
nay, it was not without the best reason that the Prophets usually did
this; for repentance is better tested by the observance of the second
table, than by that of divine worship. For as hypocrites dissemble, and
hide themselves with wonderful coverings, the Lord applies a touchstone,
and this he does whenever he draws them to the light, and exposes to
public view their frauds, robberies, cruelty, perjuries, thefts, and
such like vices. Since, then, hypocrites can be better convicted by the
second table of the law, the Lord rightly appeals to this when he speaks
of repentance; as though he said, “Let it now be made evident what your
repentance is, whether it be feigned or sincere; for if you act justly
and uprightly towards your neighbours, if you observe equity and
rectitude, it is a sure evidence of your repentance.”

<span id="xix.vi-p11"></span>At the same time, the Prophet overlooks not
the worship of God; for he adds, — *Hope always in thy God* By the word,
hope, he first requires faith, and then prayer, which arises from it,
and thanksgiving, which necessarily follows. Thus the whole worship of
God is briefly included, as a part for the whole, in the word, hope. The
meaning of the Prophet then is, that Israel, forsaking their own
superstitions, should recumb on the one true God, and place all their
salvation on him, that they should fly to him, and ascribe to him alone
the praise due for all blessings. By so doing, they would restore the
pure worship of God, and cast away all their adulterous superstitions.
He had spoken already of the second table of the law.

<span id="xix.vi-p12"></span>We hence see that repentance is nothing
else but a reformation of the whole life according to the law of God.
For God has explained his will in his law; and as much as we depart or
deviate from it, so much we depart from the Lord. But when we turn to
God, the true proof is, when we amend our life according to his law, and
begin with worshipping him spiritually, the main part of which worship
is faith, from which proceeds prayer; and when, in addition to this, we
act kindly and justly towards our neighbours, and abstain from all
injuries, frauds, robberies, and all kinds of wickedness. This is the
true evidence of repentance.

<span id="xix.vi-p13"></span><span id="xix.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xix.vi-p14"></span>But while the Prophet exhorted the
Israelites to repentance, he adds, that such was their perverseness,
that it was done without any fruit. *Canaan!* he says; I read this by
itself; for what some consider to be understood is frigid, as, “He was
assimilated to, or was like Canaan, in whose hand,” *etc*.. But, on the
contrary, the Prophet here condemns the Israelites by one word; as
though he said, that they were wholly aliens, and unworthy to be called
the children of Abraham. And thus what we say is often abrupt, when we
speak indignantly. The Prophet then calls them “Canaan” through
indignation; which means this, “Ye are not the children of Abraham; ye
falsely boast of his name, which cannot be suitable to you; for ye are
Canaan.”

<span id="xix.vi-p15"></span>He afterwards adds *In his hand is the
balance of fraud, he loves to plunder,* or to spoil. Literally it is, he
loves to spoil. But the sense is clear, that they loved to plunder; that
is, they were carried away with all greediness to acts of robbery. It
must first be noticed, that the Prophet here exposes to infamy the
carnal descendants of Abraham by calling them Canaan, and this
imputation is often to be met with in the Prophets. And the reason why
they were thus addressed was, that these senseless men were wont proudly
to set up as their shield the distinction of their race. “What! we are a
holy people.” Since by this pretence they rejected all the warnings of
the Prophets, God casts back this reproach, “Ye are not the children of
Abraham; but ye are Canaan:” as though he said, “Nothing in that nation
has as yet changed, the Israelites are always like themselves.” The Lord
had once cleansed the land of godless men: but when the descendants of
Abraham became like the Canaanites, they were called the seed of Canaan;
as though the same nation, which was there formerly, had still remained;
for there was no difference in their manners, for they were equal or the
same in depravity.

<span id="xix.vi-p16"></span>But the reason follows why he calls them
the race of Canaan even because they carried in their *hand a deceitful
balance,* and devoted themselves with all avidity to plunder. The
deceitful balance may be extended to their dissimulations, fallacies,
and falsehoods, by which God, as he had before complained, was
surrounded; but as it immediately follows, *He loves robberies,* I
prefer to understand here those two modes of doing injury which include
almost every kind of wickedness; for men either craftily defraud when
they injure others, or they do harm to their neighbours by open force.
Since, then, they who wrong their neighbours do either openly injure
them, or circumvent the simple by their frauds and crafty dealings,
Hosea lays down here, in the first place, the deceitful balance, and
then he adds their greediness in spoiling or plundering. It is then the
same as if he had said that they were fraudulent, and that they were
also robbers who proceeded with open violence. He means that they were,
without law or any restraint, addicted to acts of wrong and injustice,
and were so intent on doing mischief, as to do it either by craft or by
open force. There is then no wonder that they were called an
uncircumcised race. Why? Because they had nothing to do with God,
inasmuch as they had thus departed from his law; yea, they abhorred
kindness and mercy. It also follows that they were void of all piety,
since they were thus unmindful of all equity towards their neighbours.
This is the meaning.

<span id="xix.vii"></span>

<span id="xix.vii-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="xix.vii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou appearest
not now to us in shadows and types, as formerly to the holy fathers, but
clearly and plainly in thy only-begotten Son, — O grant, that we may be
wholly given to the contemplation of thine image, which thus shines
before us; and that we may in such a manner be transformed into it, as
to make increasing advances, until at length, having put off all the
filth of our flesh, we be fully conformed to that pure and perfect
holiness which dwells in Christ, as in him dwells the fulness of all
blessings and thus obtain at last a participation of that glory which
our Lord has procured for us by his resurrection. Amen.

<span id="xix.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.ix-p5"></span><span id="xix.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ix-p6"></span>Here God complains by his Prophet, that the
Israelites flattered themselves in their vices, because their affairs
succeeded prosperously and according to their wishes: and it is a vice
too common, that men felicitate themselves as long as fortune, as they
commonly say, smiles on them, thinking that they have God then
propitious to them. Since then the condition of the people was such,
they despised all the Prophets and their reproofs. Of this hardihood the
Lord now complains. *Ephraim has said I am yet become rich* There is an
emphasis to be noticed in the adversative particle <span
id="xix.ix-p6.1"></span> אך“*ach*”. It is sometimes in Hebrew a simple
affirmative; but here the Prophet meant to express another thing, even
this, that the Israelites laughed at all reproofs, because God seemed to
be propitious to them, as though he manifested his favour by prosperity.
“*I am, however, become rich;* and therefore I care nothing for what the
Prophets may say, for I am contented with my lot.” This, as I have said,
is a common evil; and hence this passage ought to be carefully noted,
lest when the Lord spares us for a time, we may think that we are
innocent before him; for there is nothing more to be feared than the
dazzling of our eyes by a prosperous and desirable state of things.
Though the Lord then may bear with us, and not immediately draw forth
his vengeance against us, but, on the contrary, cherish us as it were
kindly in his bosom; yet if he reproves us by his word, we ought to
attend to his threatenings.

<span id="xix.ix-p7"></span>But they further add, *All my labours shall
not find iniquity,* or, *they shall not find iniquity in all my
labours*. Many read simply as the words are, “My labours shall not find
iniquity:” but as the expression seems stiff, I have tried to render it
smoother, as others also have done, “They shall not find iniquity in all
my labours.” This boasting went farther, for the Prophet shows that the
people were not only secure, because the Lord gave them some tokens of
his paternal favour; but that they were also inebriated with this
impious confidence, that God would not have favoured them had they not
been exempt from every fault and vice: and this second clause ought to
be carefully noticed. Now it is a depravity that is by no means to be
endured, when men begin to despise God, because he deals kindly with
them, and when they abuse his levity so as to condemn all his teaching
and all his threatening; this is indeed a very great perversion: but
when to all this is added such a pride, that ungodly and reprobate men
persuade themselves that they are just, because God does not immediately
punish them, — this is, as it were, a diabolical madness; and yet we see
that it is a common thing. For godless men are not only proud of their
wealth, they are not only inflated with their own power; but they also
think that God is in some way under obligations to them. “Why! it must
be that God regards me innocent, and pure from every vice, for he
favours me: he then does not find in me what is worthy of punishment.”
Thus the wicked raise up their horns against God, while he indulges
them, and appears not so severe towards them as they have deserved.

<span id="xix.ix-p8"></span>When at the present day we perceive these
evils prevailing among the greater portion of mankind, there is no
reason to feel astonished: but we ought at the same time to profit by
the instruction of the Prophet, so that we may not be blinded by
prosperity, and despise reproofs, and flatter ourselves in our sin; and
also, that we may not accumulate for ourselves a store of God’s wrath,
when he deals kindly with us. Let us not then abuse his forbearance; let
us not think that we are innocent before him, because he does not
immediately execute his judgements; but let us rather learn to make a
scrutiny of ourselves, and to shake off our vices, so that we may humble
ourselves under his hand, though he restrains himself from inflicting
punishment. This is the application of the present doctrine.

<span id="xix.ix-p9"></span>But we must notice what the Prophet adds,
*They shall not find iniquity in my labours;* that is, iniquity shall
not be found in my labours, because this is *wickedness* or a crime
requiring expiation. I wonder that interpreters explain this place so
frigidly; for they say, that there shall not be found in my labours
iniquity or sin. But the Prophet does not set down a copulative, but
uses the particle <span id="xix.ix-p9.1"></span>אשר, *asher*, which is
to be taken here exegetically. And the meaning is, that hypocrites,
while they claim to themselves the praise of innocence, for the sake of
dissembling, detest ostensibly every wickedness and crime. “Iniquity
shall not be found in my labours, for this is wickedness; far be it that
I should be discovered to be a wicked person in my doings; for I am
without fraud in all my dealings.” But is this the case? By no means;
but as they judge of God’s favour by prosperous fortune, they think that
God would not be so kind to them unless he regarded them as just and
pure. Hence we see how securely hypocrites mock God, when they begin to
despise his teaching and warnings. We need not then wonder that at this
day so much perverseness prevails everywhere in the world. But let us
also use this mode of teaching which the Prophet sets before us. Let us
now proceed —

<span id="xix.x"></span>

<span id="xix.x-p1"></span><span id="xix.x-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#009.md)<span id="xix.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.x-p2"></span>**9.** And I *that am* the Lord thy God from
the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the
days of the solemn feast.

<span id="xix.x-p3"></span>**9.** Ego autem Jehova Deus tuus a terra
Aegypti: habitare te faciam in tabernaculis, sicut diebus conventus.

<span id="xix.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.x-p5"></span><span id="xix.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.x-p6"></span>In the first clause God reproaches the
Israelites for having forgotten the benefit of his redemption, the
memory of which ought ever to have prevailed and flourished among them.
*I yet,* he says, *am thy God from the land of Egypt;* that is, “It is
strange that you are so forgetful that your redemption does not come to
your mind, which yet ought to be well known, and be ever, as it were,
before your eyes.” That was, as we know, a memorable instance of God’s
kindness. But when he says that he is the God of that people from the
land of Egypt, he points out the end of redemption, as though he said,
“I redeemed thee for this end, that thou mightest be forever bound to
me.” For we know that when he delivered that people from their cruel
tyranny, he at the same time acquired for himself an eternal kingdom; he
was then sanctified in his elect people. The end of redemption is then
to be observed in the words of the Prophet, “I am,” he says, “thy God
from the land of Egypt; how otherwise couldest thou have come forth from
thy grave?” For they were like the dead, when God stretched out his hand
to them. From the land of Egypt then I am thy God, which means this:
“Since thou hast been so wonderfully restored from death to life by my
favour, am not I thy God from that day? Thou owest then thyself and all
thine to me; for I purchased thee for myself as a peculiar possession.
When now thou detest petulantly to reject my Prophets, who speak in my
name, it is surely an ingratitude not to be endured, that thou
forgettest thy redemptions and the end for which I made known to thee my
power and grace.”

<span id="xix.x-p7"></span>But as to the second clause, interpreters
vary; some explain it in this way, that God would not cease to show
mercy to the Israelites, however unworthy they were, *I will make thee
to dwell in thy tabernacles;* and they take tabernacles, not strictly
proper, for houses. Then they say, *according to the days of Moed,* that
is, of ancient agreement, or, *according to appointed days*; for God had
promised to give the land of Canaan to the posterity of Abraham for
their perpetual rest. But this exposition seems not suitable. Others
say, that the Israelites are here reproved, because they neglected the
command of God, who had instituted a festal-day, on which they were to
commemorate yearly their redemption. We indeed know that there was the
annual feast of tabernacles: so they think the meaning of the Prophet to
be this “I not only once redeemed thee, but I also wished that there
should be a memorial of this favour; and for what purpose have I
commanded you to keep a yearly festival, except that ye might retain in
your memory what otherwise might have been forgotten? But I have
effected nothing by this rite, for I am now rejected, and my prophets
possess no authority among you.” But this sense also is frigid. Some
think that the Prophet here threatens the Israelites, as though he said,
“God will again drive you out, that you may dwell in tents as you did
formerly in the desert.” Though I do not reject this opinion, yet I
think there is something more emphatical in the Prophet’s words, that
is, that God here says in an indirect way, that there was need of a new
redemption, that he might bind the people more to himself; as though he
said, “I see that you are unmindful of my former redemption; for I see
that you esteem it as nothing, as if it were obsolete; I must then lose
all my labour, except the memory of my ancient favour be renewed: I will
therefore make thee to dwell again in tents. It is necessary to eject
thee again from thy heritage, and to restore thee again, and that in a
manner unusual and least expected, that thou mayest understand that I am
thy Redeemer.

<span id="xix.x-p8"></span>We now then apprehend what the Prophet meant.
After God had said that he was the God of Israel from the land of Egypt,
he then adds, “Inasmuch as your former redemption has lost all its
influence through your wicked forgetfulness, I will become again your
Redeemer; I will therefore make thee to abide or dwell in tents as
formerly; as your first redemption avails nothing, I will add a second,
that you may at length repent, and know how much you are indebted to
me.” *The days of Moed* he takes for their manner of proceeding in the
desert as described by Moses; for they assembled together for sacrifices
from their camps. Hence God does not speak here of the convention he had
made with his people, as if he pointed out some perpetual compact; but
he calls those *the days of Moed* on which the Israelites were
assembled, when they were located in their camps according to the
account given by Moses. It now follows —

<span id="xix.xi"></span>

<span id="xix.xi-p1"></span><span id="xix.xi-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#010.md)<span id="xix.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.xi-p2"></span>**10.** I have also spoken by the prophets,
and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of
the prophets.

<span id="xix.xi-p3"></span>**10.** Et locutus sum super Prophetas, et
ego visionem multiplicavi, et in manu Prophetarum assimilavi (*vel*,
similitudines posui.)

<span id="xix.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.xi-p5"></span><span id="xix.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.xi-p6"></span>The Prophet amplifies the sin of the people
in having always obstinately opposed God, so that they were without any
pretext of ignorance: for men, we know, evade God’s dreadful judgement
as long as they can plead either ignorance or thoughtlessness. The
Prophet denies that the people had fallen through want of information,
for they had been often, nay, continually warned by the Prophets. It
then appears that this people were become, as it were, wilfully
rebellious against God; for they had ever despised the Prophets, not
once or twice, but when the Lord sent them in succession: *I have
spoken,* he says, *upon my prophets,* or, *by my Prophets*; for <span
id="xix.xi-p6.1"></span>על, *ol,* is variously taken: ‘I have spoken
upon my Prophets,’ that is, I have deposited with them the doctrine
which ought to have restored you to the right way; and not only so, but
*I have multiplied visions;* it has not been in one way that I have
tried to gather you, but I have accumulated many visions: and then he
says, *In the hand of Prophets I have placed similitudes;* that is, I
have endeavoured in every way possible to restore you to a sound mind;
for God speaks after the manner of men. He might indeed, if he chose,
effect this by the secret movement of his Spirit; but it is enough to
take away every excuse from men to allege the fact, that they obey not
the word, and offer not themselves to God as submissive and teachable,
when he by his Prophets cohorts them to repentance. It is then an
enhancing of sin worthy of being noticed, when God remonstrates, and
says, that he had uselessly spent all his efforts to collect the
dispersed Israel, though he had constantly employed the labours of his
Prophets.

<span id="xix.xi-p7"></span>But this reproach may be also applied to us
at this day; yea, whatever the Prophet has hitherto said may justly be
turned against us. For we see how the world hardens itself against all
warnings; and we see also how long the Lord suspends his judgements, and
tolerates men who scoff at his forbearance. Then the same depravity
rages now in the world, which the Prophet describes in this place.
Besides, God has not only redeemed us from Egypt, but from the lowest
hell, and we know that we have been redeemed by Christ for this end, —
that we may be wholly devoted to God; for Christ died and rose again for
this purpose, — that he might be the Lord of the living and of the dead.
But we see how much is the perverseness of men, and how with impunity
they grow wanton against God. Who among us remember that they are no
longer their own, because they have been purchased by the blood of
Christ? Few think of this. And not only this only true and perpetual
redemption ought to be kept in mind by us; for the Lord again redeemed
us when we were sunk in the gulf of Popery; and daily also does he renew
the same kindness towards us; and yet we are so forgetful, that often
the grace of God is not remembered by us. We now see how necessary is
this doctrine even for our age.

<span id="xix.xi-p8"></span>Besides, God, as I have already said, ceases
not daily to stimulate and urge us; he multiplies prophecies and
similitudes; that is, he in various ways accommodates himself to us; for
by similitudes he means all forms of teaching. And doubtless we see that
God in a manner transforms himself in his word, for he speaks not
according to his own majesty, but as he sees to be suitable to our
capacities and weakness; for the Scriptures set before us various
representations, which show to us the face of God. Since God then thus
accommodates himself to our rudeness, how great is our ingratitude, when
no fruit follows? Let us then remember that the Prophet so reproved the
men of his age, that he also speaks to us at this day. Let us now
proceed —

<span id="xix.xii"></span>

<span id="xix.xii-p1"></span><span id="xix.xii-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011.md)<span id="xix.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.xii-p2"></span>**11.** *Is there* iniquity *in* Gilead?
surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their
altars *are* as heaps in the furrows of the fields.

<span id="xix.xii-p3"></span>**11.** An in Gilead iniquitas? (*vel*, an
Gilead coepit peccare?) certe vanitas (*vel*, mendacium) fuerunt in
Gilgal (alii disjungunt istud <span id="xix.xii-p3.1"></span>בגלגל*,* ut
contexant cum sequentibus) boves sacrificarunt, etiam altaria eorum
sicut acervi super sulcos agrorum.

<span id="xix.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.xii-p5"></span><span id="xix.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.xii-p6"></span>It is an ironical question, when the
Prophet says, *Is there iniquity in Gilead?* and he laughs to scorn
their madness who delighted themselves in vices so gross, when their
worship was wholly spurious and degenerated. When they knew that they
were perfidious towards God, and followed a worship alienated from his
law, they yet were so perverse, that they proudly refused all
admonitions. Since then they were blinded in their vices, the Prophet
asks them ironically, Is there iniquity in Gilead? They are as yet
doubtful, forsooth, whether they are guilty before God, whether they
bear any blame. *Surely,* he says, *they are vanity;* that is, “How much
soever they may seek specious pretences for themselves, and deny that
they are conscious of doing wrong, and also introduce many reasons for
doubt, that they may not be forced to own their sin, they yet, he says,
are guilty of falsehood; all their glosses contain nothing solid, but
they are mere disguises, which avail nothing before God.” We now then
apprehend the meaning of the Prophet.

<span id="xix.xii-p7"></span>But there is no doubt but that he also
condemns here their perverted worship, by which the Israelites at the
same time thought that they rendered the best service to God. But
obedience, we know, is better than all sacrifices. The Prophet then
inveighs here against all fictitious modes of worship, devised without
God against the authority of God’s law. But at the same time, as we have
just hinted, he indirectly exposes their thoughtlessness for imagining
themselves excusable, provided they set up their own good intention, as
it is commonly done, and say, that they built altars with no other
design than to make known everywhere the name of God, to preserve among
themselves some tokens of religion. Since, then, they thus raised up a
cloud of smoke to cover their impiety, the Prophet says, “They indeed
still inquire, as of a doubtful thing, whether there is iniquity in
Gilead; let them inquire and dispute; surely,” he says, “they are vain;”
literally, *surely they have been falsehood:* but he means that they
foolishly brought forward those frivolous excuses, by which they tried
to escape the crime and its punishment. How was it that they were vain?
Because God values his own law more than all the glosses of men, and he
will have all men to obey, without dispute, his own word: but when they
thus licentiously depart from his commandments, it is what he cannot
endure. They are then false and deceive themselves, who think that their
own inventions are of any value before God. He then lays down their
crimes

<span id="xix.xii-p8"></span>*In Gilgal,* he says, *have they sacrificed
oxen* Jerome translates, “They sacrifice to oxen,” and thinks that the
Israelites are reprehended here for sacrificing to the calves: but this
seems too remote from the words of the Prophet. The Prophet then
mentions their sin — that they sacrificed oxen and multiplied altars.
And yet it seemed to be a diligence worthy of praise, that they
increased many altars, that they worshipped God everywhere, that they
spared neither expense nor labour, that they were not content with few
sacrifices, but added a great number; — all this seemed to deserve no
common praise: but the Lord, as it has been already said, valued not
these corrupt practices; for he would have himself to be alone
worshipped by his people, and would have their piety to be attested by
this single evidence — their obedience to his word. When we then turn
aside from God’s word, nay, when we with loose reins abandon ourselves
to new inventions, though we may plausibly profess that our object is to
worship God, yet all this is a vain and fallacious pretence, as the
Prophet here declares.

<span id="xix.xii-p9"></span>Jerome is mistaken in thinking that Gilgal
was a town in the tribe of Judah; and the supposition cannot suit this
place: for Judah, we know, was then free from those gross pollutions;
Judah was not as yet polluted with the defilements which the Prophet
here condemns in the kingdom of Israel. It is then certain, that Gilgal
was a town of Israel; and we know that a celebrated temple and altar
were there: hence he especially points out this place.

<span id="xix.xii-p10"></span>But he afterwards adds, *Their altars are
as heaps on the furrows of the field* There was then we know, only one
legitimate altar; and God would not have sacrifices offered to him,
except in one place. Hence the more active the Israelites were in
multiplying altars, the more they provoked the vengeance of God: how
much soever it was their purpose to worship God, yet God spurned that
foolish affectedness. We then see why the Prophet here compares the
altars then erected in the kingdom of Israel to heaps of stones; as
though he said “As one gathers stones into a heap, when the land is
stony, that he may drive his plough more easily, so every one forms an
altar for himself, as though he were raising up a hillock in his own
field: thus it comes, that they perversely corrupt the pure and lawful
worship which I have appointed.” We now then understand the meaning of
the Prophet to be, that superstitious men gain nothing, when they boldly
and openly boast that they worship God; for whatever disguise they may
invent for themselves and others, the Lord yet abominates every thing
that is contrary to his word: and our mode Of worshipping God is alone
true and lawful, when we only follow what he prescribes, and allow to
ourselves nothing but what is according to his command and appointment.
This is the meaning. Let us proceed —

<span id="xix.xiii"></span>

<span id="xix.xiii-p1"></span><span id="xix.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
12:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012.md)<span
id="xix.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.xiii-p2"></span>**12.** And Jacob fled into the country of
Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept *sheep*

<span id="xix.xiii-p3"></span>**12.** Et fugit Jacob in agrum Syriae, et
servivit Israel in uxore (*hoc est*, pro uxore,) et pro uxore custodivit
(*id est,* custos fuit gregis.)

<span id="xix.xiii-p4"></span>**13.** And by a prophet the Lord brought
Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.

<span id="xix.xiii-p5"></span>**13.** Et per Prophetam eduxit (ascendere
fecit) Jehova Israelem ex Aegypto, et per Prophetam servatus est.

<span id="xix.xiii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xix.xiii-p7"></span><span id="xix.xiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xix.xiii-p8"></span>The Prophet now employs another kind of
reproof, — that the Israelites did not consider from what source they
had proceeded, and were forgetful of their origin. And the Prophet
designedly touches on this point; for we know how boldly and proudly the
people boasted of their own eminence. For as a heathen gloried that he
was an Athenian, so also the Jews think that all we are brute animals,
and imagine that they have a different origin from the rest of mankind,
because they are the posterity of Abraham. Since then they were blinded
by such a pride as this God meant to undeceive them, as he does here:
“Jacob your father, who was he? What was his condition? What was his
nobility? What was his power? What was his dignity and eminence
according to the flesh? Yea, truly, he was a fugitive from his own
country: had he always lived at home, his father was but a sojourner;
but he was constrained to flee into Syria. And how splendidly did he
live there? He was indeed with his uncle; but he was treated no better
than if he had been some worthless slave: He *served for a wife* And how
did he serve? He was a keeper of sheep. Go then now and boast of your
dignity, as if ye were nobler than others, as if your condition were
better than that of the common sort of people.” God then brings against
them the condition of their father, in whose name they gloried, but who
was an abject person and a fugitive, who was like a worthless slave, who
was a keeper of sheep; who, in short, had nothing which could be deemed
reputable among men.

<span id="xix.xiii-p9"></span><span id="xix.xiii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xix.xiii-p10"></span>*And God*, he says, *brought you up by a
Prophet from Egypt, and by a Prophet you have been preserved* This was,
as it were, their second nativity. Some think that the comparison is
between their first origin and their deliverance; as though Hosea had
said, “Though you were born of a very poor and ignoble man, yet God has
favoured you with singular privilege; for he gave Moses to be the
minister of your liberation.” But in my judgement the Prophet speaks in
a more simple way; for, first, he shows what was the first origin of the
people, that they were from Jacob; and then he shows what was their
second origin; for God had again begotten them when he brought them out
of Egypt. And they were there, as it is well known, very miserable, and
they did not come out by their own valour, they did not attain for
themselves their liberty; but Moses alone extended his hand to them,
having been sent for this end by God. Since the case was so, it was
strange that they now provoked God, as he says in the last verse, by
their altars.

<span id="xix.xiii-p11"></span>And it very frequently occurs in the
Prophets, that God reminds the Israelites whence or from what source
they had arisen, “Look to your origin, to the stone from which ye were
cut off; for Abraham was alone and childless, and his wife also was
barren;” and yet God multiplied their race, (<span
id="xix.xiii-p11.1"></span>[Isa
51:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa051.htm#002.md)<span
id="xix.xiii-p11.1"></span>.) This was said, because the Israelites did
not look to God, but in their adversity despaired, when no way appeared
by which they could be restored; but in their prosperity they became
proud, and regarded as nothing the favour of God. We then see what the
Prophet had in view. The Lord says, “Acknowledge what you owe to me; for
I have chosen Jacob your father, and have not chosen him because he was
eminent for his great dignity in the world; for he was a fugitive and a
keeper of sheep, and served for his wife. I afterwards redeemed you from
the land of Egypt; and in that coming forth there was nothing that you
did; there is no reason why you should boast that liberation was
obtained by your velour; for Moses alone was my servant in that
deliverance. I did then beget you the second time, when I redeemed you.
How great is your ingratitude, when you do not own and worship me as
your Redeemer?” We now then see that the Prophet thus treated the people
of Israel, that it might in every way appear that they were unworthy of
so many and so great benefits bestowed on them by God; for they had
perverted all the works of God, and so perverted them, that they did not
think that any thing, belonged to him, and they returned no thanks to
God; nay, they extolled themselves, as if God had never conferred on
them any kindness.

<span id="xix.xiii-p12"></span>But I will not dwell on the history of
Jacob, for it is not necessary for elucidating the meaning of the
Prophet, and it is well known: it is enough to refer only to what is
suitable to this place. *Jacob* then *fled into the country of Syria;*
and then he says, *Israel served for a wife* He mentions the name,
Israel, after Jacob. The name, Israel, was noble and memorable; yea, it
was given by God to the holy patriarch: but at the same time Jacob did
not in himself or in his own person excel; he nevertheless served, and
was in a most humble condition, and he *served for a wife;* that is,
that he might have a wife; for we know how he made an agreement with his
uncle Laban.

<span id="xix.xiii-p13"></span>Further, *By a Prophet he brought them
out of Egypt* This was their second nativity: and *by a Prophet* Israel
*was preserved* There is an allusion here to the word <span
id="xix.xiii-p13.1"></span>שמר, *shimer*; for I take the word <span
id="xix.xiii-p13.2"></span>נשמר, *nushimer,* passively. He had said
before that Jacob *kept* sheep; and he says now, <span
id="xix.xiii-p13.3"></span>נשמר, *nushimer*, *kept was* Israel by a
Prophet; as though he said, “Ye now see that God has given you a reason
for humility in your father, since he was suffered to be so miserably
distressed; and shen he preserved you beyond the hope of men, and by no
human means except by Moses, who was also a fugitives and who came forth
as from a cave, for he was also a keeper of sheep. Since, then, ye have
been thus kept by the favour of God, how comes it that your present
condition fascinates you, and that ye consider not that you were once
redeemed by the Lord for this end, that ye might be wholly devoted to
him forever?” Now he adds — (I will also run over this verse, for there
will be no lecture to-morrow, nor the day after) —

<span id="xix.xiv"></span>

<span id="xix.xiv-p1"></span><span id="xix.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Hosea

<span id="xix.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xix.xiv-p5"></span><span id="xix.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xix.xiv-p6"></span>The Prophet says first, that *Ephraim had
provoked God by his high places* Some, however, take the word <span
id="xix.xiv-p6.1"></span>תמרורים, *tamerurim,* for bitternesses. Then it
is, “Israel or Ephraim have provoked God to bitterness.” But since this
word in other places as in the thirty-first of Jeremiah, is taken for
high places and as it clearly appears that the Prophet here inveighs
avowedly against Israel and their vicious worship, I doubt not but that
he points out these high places in which the Israelites appointed their
false and impious modes of worship. *Ephraim* then *have provoked him
with their high places:*  <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) Ephraim
having in so many ways immersed themselves in their superstitions,
provoked God in their high places.

<span id="xix.xiv-p8"></span>Then *his blood shall remain on him.* As
the word <span id="xix.xiv-p8.1"></span>נתש, *nuthesh,* signifies “to
pour out,” and signifies also to “remain,” some render it, “His blood
shall remain;” others “Shall be poured upon him.” But this makes but a
little difference as to what is meant; for the Prophet intends to show,
that Ephraim would have to suffer the punishment of their impiety; as
though he said, “They shall not at last escape from the hand of God,
they shall receive the wages of their iniquities.”

<span id="xix.xiv-p9"></span>*And his reproach shall his Lord return
unto him* Here he calls God himself the Lord of Israel, though Israel
had shaken off the yoke, and alienated themselves from the service of
God. They cannot, he says, escape the authority of God, though they have
spurned his law; though they have become wanton in their superstitions,
they shall yet know that they remain under the hand and power of God,
they shall know that they effect nothing by this their petulance; though
they thus wander after their abominations, yet the Lord will not lose
his right, which he had obtained for himself by redeeming Israel. *Their
Lord* then *shall render* to them their own reproach, of which they are
worthy.

<span id="xix.xv-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="xix.xv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we have not
only been created by thee, but when thou hast placed us in this world,
thou hast also enriched us with abundance of all blessings, — O grant,
that we may not transfer to others the glory duo to thee, and that

reproved, we may not with an iron hardness resist, but render ourselves
pliable to thee, and not give ourselves up to our own devices, but
follow with true docility and meekness, that rule which thou hast
prescribed in thy word, until at length having put off all the remains
of errors, we shall enjoy that blessed light, which thou hast prepared
for us in heaven, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

not understanding the drift of a passage, have suggested emendations,
which seem plausible, and yet take away an important meaning, as we
shall see in the present case, from Calvin’s explanation. *Horsley*
takes the same view with Calvin, though *Newcome* does not. — *Ed.*

<span id="xix.xiv-p7"></span> Calvin is not correct as to the meaning of
this word. There is no instance in which it means “high places;” in
<span id="xix.xiv-p7.1"></span>[Jer
31:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#021.md)<span id="xix.xiv-p7.1"></span>,
to which reference is made, it means obelisks or pillars set up as
way-marks. There is no doubt but that the word signifies here what is
expressed in our version. *Gesenius* says, that it is to be taken here
adverbially, and with him *Newcome* and most critics agree. *Horsley*
renders the clause thus, — “Ephraim has given bitterest provocation.”
