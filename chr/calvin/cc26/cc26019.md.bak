<span id="xx.i-p1"></span>Lecture Thirty-fourth

<span id="xx.ii"></span>

<span id="xx.ii-p1"></span><span id="xx.ii-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001.md)<span id="xx.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xx.ii-p2"></span>**1.** When Ephraim spake trembling, he
exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.

<span id="xx.ii-p3"></span>**1.** Quam loqueretur Ephraim, tremor:
extulit se ipse in Israel, et peccavit in Baal, et mortuus est.

<span id="xx.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xx.ii-p5"></span><span id="xx.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xx.ii-p6"></span>Interpreters agree not in their view of this
verse. Some say that trembling was excited in Israel when Ephraim, that
is, Jeroboam, who was born of that tribe, exhorted the people to worship
the calves. By the word <span id="xx.ii-p6.1"></span>רתת, *retat*,
“trembling,” they understand, that the people were so astonished, that
they without thought immediately obeyed the will, or rather the humour,
of their impious king. And if this sense be approved, the word,
trembling, may be in another way explained, even in this, — that the
people did not immediately embrace that perverted worship, but dreaded,
as is wont to be the case with regard to new things, and which seem to
have nothing reasonable in their favour. But these expounders wholly
depart, in my judgement, from the intention of the Prophet; for, on the
contrary, he sets forth here the twofold state of the kingdom of Israel,
that it might hence be manifest that the ten tribes had been through
their own fault rejected by the Lord, and had thus fallen from that
dignity unto which the Lord had raised them.

<span id="xx.ii-p7"></span>He therefore says, *When Ephraim spake
formerly, his voice dreaded,*  <span id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) *and
he raised himself in Israel;* that is, among the whole race of Abraham.
But now *he is dead,* or *is fallen*, *after he has begun to sin in
Baal.* Then, in the first sentence, the Prophet records the honours with
which God had favoured that tribe. Ephraim, we know, was the younger of
the sons of Joseph. Manasseh ought not only to have had the
pre-eminence, but also to have reigned alone in that family; for the
people were divided into twelve tribes. But God intended to raise up two
chiefs in the house of Joseph, and preferred the younger to the
first-begotten. Hence Ephraim, who had increased in number and power,
and had at length obtained the royal dignity, ought to have acknowledged
the singular favour of God. And by way of reproach, the Prophet here
says, that all trembled at the single voice of Ephraim; that is, when he
became endued with authority, and then, that he was exalted in Israel.
He ought to have been deemed of no account, he ought to have been
inferior to his brother, who was the first-born, and yet he excelled all
the tribes. Since, then, God had conferred so much honour on the tribe
of Ephraim, the more grievous was his fault, that he afterwards had
fallen away unto idols; yea, that he began his reign with superstition,
when God was pleased to choose and anoint Jeroboam king. And surely that
he, when raised beyond all hope to the throne by the hand of God,
should, instead of testifying his gratitude, immediately corrupt the
whole worship of God, this was extremely inconsistent.

<span id="xx.ii-p9"></span>But the Prophet says, in the second place,
that they *died* from the time they had thus fallen away from true and
lawful worship, in order that they might understand that they received
the just reward of their impiety when God’s hand was opposed to them,
when they were oppressed by adversity. We now perceive the obvious
meaning, of the Prophet to be, that the Israelites formerly flourished,
especially the tribe of Ephraim, from whom Jeroboam arose, so that, by
their voice alone, they subdued all their neighbours, and that beyond
the expectation of men, they suddenly emerged and erected a new kingdom
among the children of Abraham.

<span id="xx.ii-p10"></span>He afterwards adds, that after *they had
sinned by Baal, they became dead:* for God deprived the tribe of Ephraim
of the power with which he had before adorned him, so that they were but
little short of being destroyed. For though his kingdom had not wholly
fallen, it had yet come to such an extremity that the Prophet might
justly say that they, who were so far removed from their former state,
were dead. But when he says that they *sinned by Baal,* he does not mean
that this was the beginning of their idolatry; for Jeroboam at first
made the calves, and it was his successor who built Baal, and borrowed
that superstition, as it is supposed, from the neighbouring Sidonians.
But God records here what is more grievous, and less excusable, — that
the Israelites polluted themselves with the filth of the Gentiles, so
that they differed nothing from the profane and unbelieving, who had no
acquaintance with sound doctrine.

<span id="xx.ii-p11"></span>We are moreover taught in this place, that
when kings are endued with any authority, when they are strong in power,
all this comes from God; for unless God strikes terror into men, no one
would receive the yoke of another, at least all would desire equality,
or one would raise himself above others. It is then certain, that when
any one excels among many in power, this is done through the secret
purpose of God, who constrains to order the common people, and causes
them not to deny obedience to the command of one man. This is what Hosea
now teaches, when he upbraids the tribe of Ephraim with respect to this
terror; for if Ephraim had been formidable through his own power, there
would have been no room for the Prophet’s reproof: but as this was the
peculiar gift of God, the Prophet justly says, that the tribe of Ephraim
were in great honour until they had fallen into superstition. Let us now
proceed —

<span id="xx.iii"></span>

<span id="xx.iii-p1"></span><span id="xx.iii-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
13:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#002.md)<span id="xx.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xx.iii-p2"></span>**2.** And now they sin more and more, and
have made them molten images of their silver, *and* idols according to
their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say
of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.

<span id="xx.iii-p3"></span>**2.** Et nunc addunt ad peccandum (*hoc
est,* pergunt peccare,) et fecerunt sibi conflatile ex argento suo,
secundum intelligentiam suam, idola opus artificum omnis (*vel,* omne:)
ipsis ipsi dicunt sacrificantes hominem, vitulos osculentur.

<span id="xx.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xx.iii-p5"></span><span id="xx.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xx.iii-p6"></span>In this verse the Prophet amplifies the
wickedness of the people, and says, that they had not only in one day
cast aside the pure worship of God, and entangled themselves in
superstitions; but that they had been obstinate in their own depravity.
*They have added,* he says*, to their sin, and have made a molten thing
of their silver* When Israel, as we have said, departed from the worship
of God, they made calves, and made them under a specious appearance; but
when many superstitions were added, one after another, there was, as it
were, an accumulation of madness, as if the Israelites designedly wished
to subvert the law of God, and to show that they cared nothing for the
only true God, by whom they had been redeemed. This is the reason why
the Prophet says that they made progress in wickedness, and observed no
moderation in sinning, and this is what usually happens, unless God
draws men back. As soon as they fall away, they rush headlong into evil;
for they take a greater liberty in sinning, after they have turned their
back on God.

<span id="xx.iii-p7"></span>Hence this reproof of the Prophet ought to
be noticed, for he inveighs against the obstinate wickedness of Israel;
and says, that *they made* for themselves *of their silver a molten
thing* As we have seen above, they abused the gifts of God by devoting
to superstition what the Lord had destined for their use. The end for
which God has bestowed silver, we know, is, that men may carry on
commerce with one another, and apply it also to other useful purposes.
But when they make to themselves gods of silver, there is an astonishing
stupidity in their ingratitude, for they pervert the order of nature,
and forget that silver is given for another end, and that is as we have
said for their use. The Prophet at the same time intimates, that the
Israelites were less excusable, inasmuch as when they were enriched,
they became proud of their wealth. Satiety, we know, is the cause of
wantonness, as, it will be shortly stated again.

<span id="xx.iii-p8"></span>But what the Prophet adds ought to be
especially observed, *According to their own understanding* Here he
severely reproves the Israelites, because they had not subordinated all
their thoughts to God, but, on the contrary, followed what pleased
themselves. It was then *according to their own invention* The word
which the Prophet uses is not unsuitable, though “understanding,” the
word which the Prophet adopts, is among the Hebrews taken in a good
sense. But what is treated of here is the worship of God, with respect
to which all the prudence, all the reason, all the wisdom of men, and,
in short, all their senses, ought to be suspended: for if, in this case,
they of themselves adopt any thing, be it ever so little, they
inevitably vitiate the worship of God. How so? Because obedience, we
know, is better than all sacrifices. This then is the rule, as to the
right worship of God, — that men must become foolish, that they must not
allow themselves to be wise, but that they are only to give ear to God,
and to follow what he commands. But when men’s presumption intrudes, so
that they devise a new mode of worship, they then depart from the true
God, and worship mere idols. The Prophet then by the word,
*understanding,* condemns here whatever pleases the judgement and reason
of men; as though he said, “The true rule of religion, as to the worship
of God, is, that nothing human is to be mingled, that no one is to bring
forward what is his own, or what seems good to himself.” In short, the
understanding of men is here opposed to the command of God; as though
the Prophet said, “One great difference between the true worship of God
and all fictitious and degenerated modes of worship, is obedience to the
word of God; if we be wise according to our own judgement, all we do is
corrupt.” How so? Because whatever men devise of themselves is a
pollution of divine worship. Hence Paul, in <span
id="xx.iii-p8.1"></span>[Colossians
2](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#000.md)<span id="xx.iii-p8.1"></span>,
 <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) refutes all the fancies of men by
this one argument, “They are,” he says, “the traditions of men, though
they may have the show of wisdom.”

<span id="xx.iii-p10"></span>We now apprehend what the Prophet meant,
and why he added the word “understanding;” it was, that the Israelites
might learn, that all the worship which was in use among them, was
perverted and vicious; for it was not founded on the command of God, but
flowed from a different source, even the understanding of men. It then
follows, as we have said before, that in religion nothing is to be
attempted by us, but we are to follow this one law in worshipping God —
simply to obey his word.

<span id="xx.iii-p11"></span>He afterwards adds, *Idols, the work of
artificers altogether* The Prophet, in the second place, derides the
grossness which had fascinated the minds of the people, as they
worshipped in the place of God the works of men. For it is usual with
all the Prophets, in order to render the stupidity of men as it were
palpable, to show that it is wholly unreasonable to worship idols; for a
material cannot with any propriety be worshipped. When there is before
us a great mass or a great heap of gold or silver, no one imagines that
there is in it any divinity: when one passes through a wood, he
transfers not to trees the glory due to God; and the same may be said of
stones. But when the hand of the artificer is applied, the plate of gold
begins to be a god; so also the trunk of a tree seems to put on the
glory of God, when it receives a certain form from the workman; and the
same is the case with other things. Now it is extremely absurd to
suppose that an artificer, as soon as he has hewn some wood, or as soon
as he has melted gold or silver, can make a god, and convey divinity to
a dead thing; and yet it is well known that this is thought everywhere
to be the case. Superstitious men allege in excuse, that this does not
proceed from the hand of the artificer, but that as they wish for some
sign of God’s presence, and as they cannot otherwise set forth what God
is, God is in that form. But this still remains true, that workmen by
their skill make gods of lifeless things, to which no honour can belong.
Since it is so, the Prophet now justly says, that what the people of
Israel worshipped was the work of artifices; and he said this, that they
might know that they became shamefully foolish, when they left the true
God, the Creator of heaven and earth, and prostrated themselves before
idols made by hands.

<span id="xx.iii-p12"></span>But he adds, that *they say to one another
while* *they sacrifice men, Let them kiss the calves*  <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) Though this place is in various ways
explained, I am yet content with the obvious meaning of the Prophet. He
again derides them for exhorting one another to worship the calf: For by
kissing he means by a figure a profession of worship or adoration, as it
is evident from other parts of Scripture. It is said in 1 Kings,  <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) I have preserved for myself seven
thousand men, who have not bent the knee before Baal, nor kissed him. To
kiss Baal then was a sign of reverence. And this practice, we see, has
been retained by the superstitious, as the case is at this day with the
Papists, who observe this special custom of kissing their idols. But
what does the Prophet now say? *They encourage one another,* he says,
*in the worship of the calves,* and in the meantime “they sacrifice
men”. The Prophet doubtless condemns here that abominable and savage
custom of parents sacrificing their children to Moloch. It was utterly
repugnant to the feeling of nature for parents to immolate their own
children. For though this was once commanded to Abraham, we yet know
that the design was, that God intended by this proof to try the
obedience of his servant: but Abraham was not at last suffered to do
what he purposed.

<span id="xx.iii-p15"></span>They then immolated men. If it was right to
sacrifice men, surely such a service ought to have been rendered at
least to the only true God. If it was lawful to sacrifice man for the
sake of man, it was certainly ridiculous to do so to conciliate the
calf; and it was especially strange, when parents hesitated not to
appease dead statues by the blood of their children. This absurdity then
the Prophet now points out as with the finger, that he might try to make
the Israelites ashamed of their base conduct. “See,” he says, “how
brutish ye are; for ye immolate to the calves and kiss them, and more
still, ye sacrifice men. Is there so much worthiness in the calf, that
man, who far excels it, must be killed before it? Is not this wholly
inconsistent with every thing like reason?” We now understand what the
Prophet meant. *They say then one to another, while they immolate men,
Let them kiss the calves*

<span id="xx.iii-p16"></span>But we learn from this and similar places,
that we ought to notice those absurdities in which wretched men involve
themselves, when they are lost in their own devices, after having left
the word of God: for this word is to be to us as a bridle to keep us
from going astray with them in their monstrous devices; for when we
observe these delirious things which even nature itself abhors, it is
evident that God thereby restrains and preserves us as it were by his
outstretched hand. With this design the Prophet now shows how stupid the
Israelites were, and how prodigious was their frenzy when they kissed
the calves with great reverence, and also sacrificed men. So at this day
with respect to those under the Papacy, we ought not only to adopt this
argument, that they departed from the true God when they sought for
themselves new and strange modes of worship, without the warrant of his
word, but we ought also to bear in mind that their puerilities are to be
ascribed to the same cause. And we see how God has given them up to a
reprobate mind, so that they throw aside no kinds of absurdities. And
this consideration, as I have said, will serve to awaken those who are
as yet healable, when they understand that they have been infatuated;
having been in this manner admonished, they may return to the right way.
And that we ourselves may give thanks to God, and detest more and more
that filth in which we were for a time involved, and remember that there
is nothing more to be dreaded than that the Lord should allow us loose
reins, the very example of his vengeance as to all idolaters is made
known to us; for as soon as they departed from the pure worship of God,
they gave themselves up, as we have stated, to the most shameful
stupidity. Let us proceed —

<span id="xx.iv"></span>

<span id="xx.iv-p1"></span><span id="xx.iv-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#003.md)<span id="xx.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xx.iv-p2"></span>**3.** Therefore they shall be as the morning
cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff *that* is
driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the
chimney.

<span id="xx.iv-p3"></span>**3.** Propterea erunt quasi nubes matutina,
quasi ros mane exoriens, transiens quasi palea quae ex area projicitur,
et quasi fumus e fumario, (*Nam* <span id="xx.iv-p3.1"></span>ארבה
*accipitur hoc sensu: significat quidem* fenestram, *sed est* vaporarium
camini.)

<span id="xx.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xx.iv-p5"></span><span id="xx.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xx.iv-p6"></span>The Prophet employs here four similitudes to
show the condition of Israel. How much soever they flourished for a
time, and might be deemed happy, their state would yet be fading and
evanescent. *They shall be,* he says, *as the morning cloud:* though
they be loftily proud, the Lord will yet shake off from them whatever
power they may have. Secondly, they shall be *as the dew that rises up
in the morning* — having nothing substantial in them. Thirdly they shall
be *as the chaff which from the floor is driven by a whirlwind* And,
lastly they shall be, he says, *as the smoke*; for *as the smoke*
produces thick darkness, and, after having gone out of the chimney,
disperses and disappears, so these proud people, how much soever they
may have praised themselves, would not continue in a permanent
condition.

<span id="xx.iv-p7"></span>We hence conclude, that the Israelites were
not so much like the dead, but that yet they had some power remaining in
them: for God would have otherwise threatened to no purpose, that they
should be made like a cloud, and the dew, and the chaff, and the smoke:
but they had been already in a great measure consumed. And God denounces
on them here utter destruction, that they might not think that they had
already suffered the last punishment, and that they might not suppose
that they could gather new strength: for proud men entertain vain
confidence, through which they remove to a distance the judgement of
God. Lest, then, they should delude themselves with such allurements,
the Prophet here declares that their condition would be fading, such as
would soon come to ruin. It follows —

<span id="xx.v"></span>

<span id="xx.v-p1"></span><span id="xx.v-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
13:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#004.md)<span id="xx.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xx.v-p2"></span>**4.** Yet I *am* the Lord thy God from the
land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no god but me: for *there is* no
saviour beside me.

<span id="xx.v-p3"></span>**4.** Et ego Jehova Deus tuus e terra
Aegypti, et Deum extra me non cognosces, et Servator nemo praeter me.

<span id="xx.v-p4"></span>**5.** I did know thee in the wilderness, in
the land of great drought.

<span id="xx.v-p5"></span>**5.** Ego cognovi te in leserto, in terra
siccitatum (*hoc est,* in terra arida.)

<span id="xx.v-p6"></span> 

<span id="xx.v-p7"></span><span id="xx.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xx.v-p8"></span>The Prophet now repeats the sentence which we
have noticed in the last chapter for the sake of amplifying the sin of
the people. For had they never known sound doctrine, had they never been
brought up in the law, there would have been some colour for alleviating
their fault; because they might have excused themselves by saying, that
as they had never known true religion, they had gone astray according to
the common practice of men; but as they had from infancy been taught
sound doctrine, as God had brought them up as it were in his own bosom,
as they had learned from their first years what it was to worship God
purely, when they thus retook themselves to the superstitions of the
heathens, what could there be for an excuse for them? We then see the
bearing of the complaint, when God says, that he had been *the God of
Israel from the land of Egypt*

<span id="xx.v-p9"></span>*I am then*, he says, *Jehovah your God*. By
calling himself *Jehovah*, he glances at all their fictitious gods; as
though he said “I am doubtless justly, and in mine own rights your God;
for I am of myself — I am the Creator of the world, no one can take away
my power: but whence have these their divinity, except from the madness
of men?” He says further, *I am thy God,* O Israel; that is, “I have
manifested myself to thee from the land of Egypt, from thy very
nativity. When I redeemed thee from Egypt I brought thee out as it were
from the womb to the light of life; for Egypt was to thee like the
grave. Thou didst then begin to live, and to be some sort of people,
when I stretched forth my hand to thee.”

<span id="xx.v-p10"></span>And now also ought to be noticed what I have
said before, that the people were redeemed on this condition, that they
should devote themselves wholly to God. As we are at this day Christ’s,
and no one of us ought to live according to his own will, for Christ
died and rose again for this end, that he might be the Lord of the
living and of the dead: so also then, the Israelites had been redeemed
by God, that they might offer themselves wholly to Him. And since God
ruled by this right over the people of Israel, how shameful and
inexcusable was their defections when the people wilfully abandoned
themselves to the superstitions of the Gentiles?

<span id="xx.v-p11"></span>*A God,* he says, *besides me thou oughtest
not to know* These words the Prophet had not before used. This sentence,
then, is fuller, for it more clearly explains the import of what he had
said, that God had purchased Israel for himself by bringing them out of
Egypt, and that is, that Israel ought to have been content with this one
Redeemer, and not to seek for themselves other gods. *A God,* then,
*besides me thou shalt not know.* For if this one God was sufficient for
redeeming his people, what do the people now mean, when they wander, and
seek aid here and there? For they ought to render to God the life
received from him, which they now enjoy, and ought to acknowledge to be
sufficiently safe under his protection. We now then see why this was
added, *Thou shalt not know a God besides me*

<span id="xx.v-p12"></span>A reason, confirmatory of this, follows: *For
no one,* he says, *is a Saviour except me* The copulative <span
id="xx.v-p12.1"></span>ו, *vau,* ought to be regarded here as a
causative, *For no one,* *etc.*, or, *Surely no one is a Saviour except
me.* And this is a remarkable passage; for we learn that the worship of
God does not consist in words, but in faith, and hope, and prayer. The
Papists of the present day think that they do not profane the worship of
God, though they fly to statues, though they pray to dead men, though
they look here and there for the accomplishment of their hopes. How so?
Because they ever retain the only true God, that is, they do not ascribe
the name of God to Christopher or to Antony. The Papists think
themselves free from all blame, since God retains his own name. But we
see how differently the matter is regarded by the Lord. “I am,” he says,
“the only true God.” How is this? “Because I am the only Saviour: feign
not to thyself another God, for thou shalt find none that will save
thee.” Then God puts an especial value on the honour that is due to him
from hope and prayer; that is, when our soul recumbs on him alone, and
when we seek and hope for salvation from no other but from him. We see
then how useful is the doctrine contained in this passage, in which the
Prophet clearly shows, that the Israelites acted absurdly and shamefully
when they formed another god for themselves, for no Saviour, except the
one true God, can be found.

<span id="xx.v-p13"></span><span id="xx.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xx.v-p14"></span>He afterwards adds *Thee I knew in the
desert, in the land of droughts* God here confirms the truth that the
Israelites had acted very absurdly in having turned their minds to other
gods, for he himself had known them. The knowledge here mentioned is
twofold, that of men, and that of God. God declares that he had a care
for the people when they were in the desert; and he designates his
paternal solicitude by the term, knowledge: *I knew thee;* that is, “I
then chose thee a people for myself, and familiarly manifested myself to
thee, as if thou were a near friend to me. But then it was necessary
that I should have been also known by thee.” This is the knowledge of
men. Now when men are known by God, why do they not apply all their
faculties, so that they may remain fixed on him? For when they divert
them to other objects, they extinguish, as much as they can, this
benefit of God. So also Paul speaks to the Galatians,

<span id="xx.v-p15"></span>‘After ye have known God, or rather after ye
are known by him,’ (<span id="xx.v-p15.1"></span>[Ga
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009)<span id="xx.v-p15.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xx.v-p16"></span>In the first clause, he shows that they had
done very wickedly in retaking themselves to various devices after the
light of the gospel had been offered to them: but he increases their sin
by the next clause, when he says, ‘Rather after ye are known by him;’ as
though he said, “God has anticipated you by his gratuitous goodness.
Since, then, God has thus first known you, and first favoured you with
his grace, how great and how shameful is now your ingratitude in not
seeking to know him in return?” We now then see why the Prophet added
that the Israelites had been *known by God in the desert, in the land of
droughts*

<span id="xx.v-p17"></span>And there is an express mention made of the
desert: for it was then necessary for the people to be sustained
miraculously by the Lord; for except God had rained manna from heaven,
and had also given water for drink, the people must have miserably
perished. Since, then God had thus supported the people contrary to the
usual course of nature, so that without his paternal care there could
have been no hope of life, the Prophet now rightly adds, In the desert,
in the land of droughts; that is, in that dry solitude, where not a
grain of corn grew, so that the people could not live except God had, as
it were, with his own hand, given them meat, and put it in their mouth.
We now see that the extreme impiety of the people is here manifestly
proved; for having been taught in God’s law, and been encouraged by so
many benefits, they yet went astray after profane superstitions. And the
Prophet, at the same time, adds —

<span id="xx.vi"></span>

<span id="xx.vi-p1"></span><span id="xx.vi-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
13:6](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#006.md)<span id="xx.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xx.vi-p2"></span>**6.** According to their pasture, so were
they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore
have they forgotten me.

<span id="xx.vi-p3"></span>**6.** Juxta  <span
id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md) pascua sua et satiati sunt, saturati
sunt, et elevatum est cor ipsorum; propterea obliti sunt mei.

<span id="xx.vi-p8"></span> 

<span id="xx.vi-p9"></span><span id="xx.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xx.vi-p10"></span>The Prophet shows here that the people were
in every way intractable. He has indeed handled this argument in other
places; but the repetition is not superfluous. After he had said that
the people were ungrateful in not continuing in the service of their
Redeemer, by whom they had been so kindly and bountifully treated in the
desert, where they must have perished through famine and want, had not
the Lord in an unwonted manner brought them help in their great
necessity, he now adds, “The Lord would have also allured you by other
means, had you not been of a wholly wild and barbarous disposition: but
it is hence manifest, that you are utterly disobedient; for after you
have been brought out of the desert, you came to rich pastures.” For the
land of Israel is here compared to rich and fertile pastures; as though
he said, “God has placed you in an inheritance where you might eat to
the full, as when a shepherd leads his sheep to a spot especially
fertile.” What did take place? *To their pastures they came,* and *were
filled; they were filled, and elevated became their heart, and they
forgat me*

<span id="xx.vi-p11"></span>Since, then, the Israelites had extinguished
the memory of their redemption, after the Lord had fed them when hungry
in the desert, and since in their fulness they rejected God, and shook
off his yoke, and, like ferocious horses, kicked against him, it became
evident that their nature was so unnameable, that they could by no means
be reduced to obedience or submission. We shall defer the rest till
tomorrow.

<span id="xx.vii"></span>

<span id="xx.vii-p1"></span>Prayer

<span id="xx.vii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou dost so
kindly call on us daily by thy voice, meekly and calmly to offer
ourselves to be ruled by thee, and since thou hast exalted us to a high
degree of honour by freeing us from the dread of the devil, and from
that tyranny which kept us in miserable fear, and hast also favoured us
with the Spirit of adoption and of hope, — O grant, that we, being
mindful of these benefits, may ever submit ourselves to thee, and desire
only to raise our voice for this end, that the whole world may submit
itself to thee, and that those who seem now to rage against thee may at
length be brought, as well as we, to render thee obedience, so that thy
Son Christ may be the Lord of all, to the end that thou alone mayest be
exalted, and that we may be made subject to thee, and be at length
raised up above, and become partakers of that glory which has been
obtained for us by Christ our Lord. Amen.

<span id="xx.viii-p1"></span>Lecture Thirty-fifth

<span id="xx.viii-p2"></span>We observed in our yesterday’s lecture,
that the Israelites were condemned, because they were, when fed in rich
pastures, like mettlesome horses; and this is what commonly happens. And
even Moses foretold this in his song,

<span id="xx.viii-p3"></span>‘My chosen, having become fat, kicked
against me,’  
(<span id="xx.viii-p3.2"></span>[De
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015)<span id="xx.viii-p3.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xx.viii-p4"></span>What the Prophet said was now fulfilled;
fulness had produced ferocity in the people of Israel. *According to
their pastures*, he says, *they were filled; they were satiated, and
their heart was elevated* Ezekiel declares the same of Sodom; when their
stomach was well filled they became proud, (<span
id="xx.viii-p4.1"></span>[Eze
16:49](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#049)<span id="xx.viii-p4.1"></span>..md)
But the Prophet speaks there of their cruelty towards men; for he says,
that the Sodomites, while abounding in all blessings, were full of
cruelty, so that they contemptuously despised the poor. But the prophet
condemns here a worse thing in the people of Israel, for their heart was
inflated with pride against God.

<span id="xx.viii-p5"></span>And there is, in the last place, a mention
made of their *forgetfulness* of God. It is impossible, when men are
blinded by a wilful self-confidence, but that they will cast aside every
fear of God and every concern for religion. And this passage teaches us,
that we ought to use our abundance temperately and frugally, and that we
ought, in the first place, beware lest the bounty of God should
introduce a forgetfulness of him. For it is an extreme perversion, that
when the more largely God pours his gifts upon us, our hearts should be
more narrow, and that his benefits should be like veils to cover our
eyes. We ought then to labour, that the benefits of God may, on the
contrary, renew the recollection of him in our minds: and then, as I
have said, let moderation and frugality be added. Let us now proceed —

<span id="xx.ix-p7"></span> 

<span id="xx.ix-p8"></span><span id="xx.ix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xx.ix-p9"></span>The Prophet denounces again on the Israelites
the vengeance of God; and as they were become torpid through their own
flatteries, as we have already often observed, he here describes the
terrible judgement of God, that he might strike fear into the obstinate,
so that they might at length perceive that they had to do with God, and
begin to dread his power. And this, as we have said, was very necessary,
when the Prophets intended to awaken hypocrites; for self- confidence so
inebriates them, that they hesitate not to despise all the threatenings
of God: and this is the reason why he adopts these three similitudes. He
first compares God to a lion, then to a leopard, and then to a bear. *I
will be,* he says, *like a lion, like a leopard*, and then *like a bear*
God, we know, is in his own nature merciful and kind; when he says that
he will be like a lion, he puts on as it were another character; but
this is done on account of men’s wickedness, as it is said in <span
id="xx.ix-p9.1"></span>[Ps 18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)<span
id="xx.ix-p9.1"></span>,

<span id="xx.ix-p10"></span>‘With the gentle, thou wilt be gentle; with
the perverse,  
thou wilt be perverse.’

<span id="xx.ix-p11"></span>For, though God speaks sharply and severely
through his Prophet, he yet expresses what we ought to remember, and
that is, that he thus speaks, because we do not allow him to treat us
according to his own nature, that is, gently and kindly; and that when
he sees us to be obstinate and unnameable, he then contends with us (so
to speak) with the like contumacy; not that perversity properly belongs
to God, but he borrows this similitude from men, and for this reason,
that men may not continue to flatter themselves when he is displeased
with them. *I shall* therefore *be like a lion, like a leopard in the
way*

<span id="xx.ix-p12"></span>As to the word *Assur,* interpreters take it
in various ways. Some render it, Assyria, though it is here written with
*Kamets:* but the Hebrews consider it as an appellative, not the name of
a place or country. Some again render it thus, “I will look on them,”
and derive it from <span id="xx.ix-p12.1"></span>שור, *shur*, and take
<span id="xx.ix-p12.2"></span> א*aleph*, as designative of the future
tense. Others derive it from <span id="xx.ix-p12.3"></span>אשר, *asher,*
and will have it to be in the conjugation *Pual:* and here they differ
again among themselves. Some render it, “I will lay in wait for them:”
and others think it to be *Shoar,* “I will be a layer in wait like a
leopard.” But this variety, with regard to the meaning of the passage,
is of but little moment; for we see the drift of the Prophet’s object.
He intends here to take away from hypocrites their vain confidence, and
to terrify them with the apprehension of God’s vengeance which was
impending. He therefore says that though God had hitherto spared them,
nay, had in a manner kindly cherished them, yet since they continued to
provoke his wrath, their condition would soon be very different; for he
*would come against them like a lion*; that is, he would leap on them
with the greatest fury; he would also be like a leopard: and a leopard,
we know, is a very cruel beast: and, lastly, he compares him to a
bereaved she-bear, or, a bereaved bear.

<span id="xx.ix-p13"></span><span id="xx.ix-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xx.ix-p14"></span>But he afterwards adds, *I will rend,* or
*will tear*, *the inclosure of their heart*. They who understand the
enclosure of the heart to be their obstinate hardness, seem to refine
too much on the words of the Prophet. We know, indeed, that the Prophets
sometimes use this mode of speaking; for they call that a hard heart, or
a heart covered with fatness, which is not pliant, and does not
willingly receive sound doctrine. But the Prophet rather alludes to the
savageness of the bear, when he says, I will rend or tear in pieces the
membrane of the heart, and will devour you as a lion. For it is the most
cruel kind of death, when the lion with his claws and teeth aims at the
heart itself and tears the bowels of man. The Prophet therefore intended
to set forth this most cruel kind of death. “I will therefore,” he says,
“tear asunder the pericardium, or the enclosure of the heart.” I do not
at the same time say, that the Prophet does not allude to the hardness
of the people, while he retains his own similitude.

<span id="xx.ix-p15"></span>*And the beast of the field shall rend them*
He speaks now without a similitude; for God means that all the wild
beasts would be his ministers to execute his judgement. “I will then
send all the beasts of the field to rend and tear them, so that nothing
among them shall remain safe.” We now see the purport of this passage,
and to what use it ought to be applied. If we are by nature so slothful,
yea, and careless, and when God does not stir us up, we indulge our own
delusions, we ought to notice those figurative representations which
tend to shake off from us our tardiness and show to us how dreadful the
judgement of God is. For the same purpose are those metaphors respecting
the eternal fire and the worm that never dies. For Gods seeing the
feelings of men to be so torpid has in Scripture applied those things
which may correct their sluggishness. Whenever then God puts on a
character not his own, let us know that it is through our fault; for we
suffer him not to deal with us according to his own nature, inasmuch as
we are intractable. Let us go on —

<span id="xx.x"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p1"></span><span id="xx.x-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
13:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#009.md)<span id="xx.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p2"></span>**9.** O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself;
but in me *is* thine help.

<span id="xx.x-p3"></span>**9.** Perdidit te Israel; quia in me auxilium

cunctis urbibus tuis, et judices tui, de quibus dixisti, Da mihi regem
et principes?

<span id="xx.x-p12"></span>**11** I gave thee a king in mine anger, and
took *him* away in my wrath.

<span id="xx.x-p13"></span>**11** Dabo tibi (*hoc est),* Dedi tibi regem
in ira mea, et sustuli in furore meo.

<span id="xx.x-p14"></span> 

<span id="xx.x-p15"></span><span id="xx.x-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p16"></span>In the first place, God upbraids the
Israelites for having in their perverseness rejected whatever was
offered for their safety: but he proceeds farther and says, that they
were past hope, and that there was a hidden cause which prevented God
from helping them, and bringing them aid when they laboured under
extreme necessity. *He has destroyed thee, Israel,* he says. Some
consider the word, calf, to be understood, “The calf has destroyed
thee:” but this is strained. Others think that there is a change of
person: and I am inclined to adopt this opinion, as this mode of
speaking we know, is very common: *Destroyed thee has Israel;* thou art
the cause of thine own destruction, or, “Israel has destroyed himself.”
Though then there is here a verb of the third person, and there is
afterwards added an affixed pronoun at the second person, we may yet
thus render the passage, “Israel has destroyed himself.” At the same
time, when I weigh more fully every particular, this passage, I think,
would be better and more fitly explained by being taken indefinitely:
“Something has destroyed thee, Israel:” as though he said, “Inquire now
who has destroyed thee.” God then does not here name Israel as the
author, nor does he point out any as the author of their ruin; but yet
he shows that Israel was lost, and that the cause of their destruction
was to be sought in some one else, and not in him. This is the meaning.
Then it is*, Something has destroyed thee, Israel; for in me was thy
help* God shows and proves that Israel, who had been hitherto preserved,
is now destroyed through their own fault; for God had once adopted the
people, and for this end, that he might continue to show his favour
towards them. If then the wickedness and ingratitude of the people had
not hindered, God would have been doubtless always like himself, and his
goodness towards that people would have flowed in a continuous and
uniform stream.

<span id="xx.x-p17"></span>This is what he means in the second clause,
when he says, *In me was thine help;* by which he seems to say, “How
comes it, and what is the reason, that I do not now help thee according
to my usual manner? Thou hast indeed found me hitherto to be thy
deliverer: though thou hast often struggled with great and grievous
dangers, I was yet never wanting to thee; thou hast ever found from me a
prompt assistance. How comes it now that I have cast thee away, that
thou criest in vain, and that no one brings thee any help? How comes it,
that thou art thus forsaken, and receives no relief whatever from my
hand, as thou hast been wont to do? And doubtless I should never be
wanting to thee, if thou wouldest allow me; but thou closest the door
against me, and by thy wickedness spurnest my favour, so that it cannot
come to thee. It then follows, that thou art now destroyed through thy
own fault: *Something* then *has destroyed thee* He speaks here
indefinitely; but this suspended way of expression is more emphatical
when he shows that Israel was without reason astonished, and had also
without reason expostulated with God. “There is then no ground for
contending with God, as if he had frustrated thy expectation, and
despised thy desires and crying; God indeed is consistent with himself,
for he is not changeable;” as though he said, “Their perdition is from
another cause, and they ought to know that there is some hindrance, why
God should not extend his hand to help them, as he has hitherto usually
done.”

<span id="xx.x-p18"></span>We now perceive the mind of the Prophet: he
in the first place records what God had been hitherto to the people; and
then he takes for granted that he does not change, but that he possesses
a uniform and unwearied goodness. But since he had hitherto helped his
people, he concludes, that Israel was destroyed through some other
cause, inasmuch as God brought him no aid; for unless Israel had
intercepted God’s goodness, it would have certainly flowed as usual. It
then appears that its course was impeded by the wickedness of the
people; for they put as it were an obstacle in its way.

<span id="xx.x-p19"></span>And this passage teaches us, that men in vain
clamour against God in their miseries: for he would be always ready to
help them, were they not to spurn the favour offered to them. Whenever
then God does not help us in our necessity, and suffers us to languish,
and as it were to pine away in our afflictions, it is doubtless so,
because we are not disposed to receive his favour, but, on the contrary,
we obstruct its way; as it is said by Isaiah,

<span id="xx.x-p20"></span>“Shortened is not the Lord’s hand, that it
cannot save, nor is my ear heavy, that it does not hear. Your sins, he
says, have set up a mound between you and me,”  
(<span id="xx.x-p20.2"></span>[Isa.
59:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#002)<span id="xx.x-p20.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xx.x-p21"></span>To the same purpose are the words of the
Prophet here when he says, that we ought to inquire what the cause of
our destruction is, when the Lord does not immediately deliver us: for
as he has once given us a taste of his goodness so he will continue to
do the same to the end; for he is not wearied in his kindness, nor can
his bounty be exhausted. The fault then belongs to us. We hence see how
remarkable is this passage, and what useful instruction it contains.

<span id="xx.x-p22"></span><span id="xx.x-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p23"></span>He afterwards more fully confirms the same by
saying, *I will be;* and then he says, *Thy king, where is he?* By
saying, ‘I will be,’ God retreats what he had before declared, that he
would always be the same; for, as James says

<span id="xx.x-p24"></span>‘No overshadowing happens to him,’ (<span
id="xx.x-p24.1"></span>[Jas 1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017.md)<span
id="xx.x-p24.1"></span>.)

<span id="xx.x-p25"></span>Hence ‘I will be;’ that is, “Though the
Israelites rail against me, that I do not pursue my usual course of
kindness, it is yet most false; for I remain ever the same, and am
always ready to show kindness to men; for I do not, as I have elsewhere
declared, forsake the works of my hands, (<span
id="xx.x-p25.1"></span>[Ps 138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008.md)<span
id="xx.x-p25.1"></span>.) Seeing then that I thus continue my favour
towards men, it must be that the way to my favour is closed up by their
wickedness. Let them therefore examine themselves, when they cry and I
answer not. When in their evils they in a manner pine away, and find no
relief, let them acknowledge it to be their own fault; for I would have
made myself the same as ever I have been, and they would have found me a
deliverer, had not a change taken place in them.” We now comprehend the
meaning of the Prophet in the ninth verse, and as to the expression,
<span id="xx.x-p25.2"></span>אהי, *aei,* *I will be,* in the verse which
follows.

<span id="xx.x-p26"></span>He then says, *Where is thy king?* God again
reproaches the Israelites for having reposed their confidence in their
king and other earthly helps, by which they thought themselves to have
been well fortified. *Where is thy king?* he says. He derides the
Israelites; for they saw that their king was now stripped of every power
to help, and that all their princes were destitute both of prudence and
of all other means. Since then there was no protection from men, the
Prophet shows now that Israel had but a vain trust, when they thought
themselves safe under the shadow of their king, when they considered
themselves secure as long as they were governed by prudent men. All
these things, he says, are vain. But we must ever bear in mind what he
had said before *I will be;* for had not this shield been set up,
hypocrites would have ever said in return, “Where now is God? What is
his purpose? Why does he delay?” Hence God mentioned before that he was
ready to help them, but that they by their wickedness had closed up the
way.

<span id="xx.x-p27"></span>But he further derides them for having in
vain placed their hope and their help in their king and princes. *Where
is thy king,* he says, *that he may save thee in all thy cities?* It is
not without reason that the Prophet mentions cities, because the
Israelites despised all threatening, while their cities were on every
side unassailable and strong to keep out enemies. Hence when God
threatened them by his Prophets, they regarded what was said to them as
fables, and thus defended themselves, “How can enemies assail us? Though
there were hundred wars nigh at hand, have we not cities which can
resist the onsets of enemies? We shall therefore dwell in safety, and
enjoy our pleasures, though God should shake heaven and earth.” Since
then they were so inebriated with this false confidence, the Prophet now
says, “I know that you excel in having great and many cities; but as you
deem them as your protection, God will show that this hope is vain and
deceptive. *Where* then *is thy king, that he may save thee in thy
cities?* And though thy king be well furnished with an army and with
defences, it will yet avail thee nothing, when God shall once rise up
against thee.”

<span id="xx.x-p28"></span>But he subjoins, *And thy judges of whom thou
hast said, Give me a king and princes?* Here the Prophet ascends higher;
for he shows that the people of Israel had not only sinned in this
respect, that they had placed their hope in their king, and in other
helps; but that they had also chosen for themselves a king, whom God had
not approved. For David, we know, was anointed for this end, that he
might unite together the whole body of the people; and God intended that
his Church and chosen people should remain under one head, that they
might be safe. It was therefore an impious separations when the ten
tribes wished for themselves a new king. How so? Because a defection
from the kingdom of David was as it were a denial of God. For if it was
said to Samuel,

<span id="xx.x-p29"></span>‘Thee have they not rejected, but me,  
that I should not reign over them,’ (<span id="xx.x-p29.2"></span>[1Sa
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#007)<span id="xx.x-p29.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="xx.x-p30"></span>it was certainly more fully verified as to
David. We now then see what the Prophet meant: after having inveighed
against the false confidence of the people for thinking that they were
safe through the power of their king, he now adds, “I will advance to
another source: for thou didst not then begin to sin, when thou didst
transfer the glory of God to the king, but when thou didst wish to have
a kingdom of thine own, being not content with that kingdom which he had
instituted in the person of David.” The Prophet does now then accuse the
people of defection, when a new king, that is, Jeroboam, was elected by
them. For though it was done according to the certain purpose of God, as
we have elsewhere observed, yet this availed nothing to alleviate the
fault of the people; for they, as far as they could, renounced God. As
the foot, if cut off from the body, is not only a mutilated and useless
member, but immediately putrefies; so also was Israel, being like a half
part of a torn and mutilated body; and they must have become putrified,
had they not been miraculously preserved. But at the same time God here
justly condemns that defection, that Israel, by desiring a new king, had
broken asunder the sacred unity of the Church and introduced an impious
separation.

<span id="xx.x-p31"></span><span id="xx.x-p31.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p32"></span>These are *the princes, of whom thou hast
said, Give me a king and princes. I gave to thee in my wrath, and took
away in my fury;* that is “It was a cursed beginning, and it shall be a
cursed end; for the election of Jeroboam was not lawful; but through an
impious wilfulness, the people then rebelled against me, when they
revolted from the family of David.” Nothing successful could then
proceed from so inauspicious a beginning. For it is only then an
auspicious token, when we obey God, when his Spirit presides over our
counsels, when we ask at his mouth, and when we begin with prayer to
him. But when we despise the word of God, and give loose reins to our
own humour, and fix on whatever pleases us, it cannot be but that an
unhappy and disastrous issue will follow. God therefore says, that he
gave them a king in his wrath; as though he said, “Ye think that you
have done nobly, when Jeroboam was raised to the throne, that he might
become eminent: for the kingdom of Judah was then far inferior to that
of Israel, which not only excelled in power, but also in the number of
its subjects. Ye think that you were then happy, because Jeroboam ruled
over you: but he was given you in the anger and *wrath* of God,” saith
the Prophet. “But God commanded Jeroboam to be anointed.” True, it was
so: but this, says God, I did in my wrath; and now *I will take away in
my fury;* that is, “I will deprive you of that kingdom which I see is
the cause of your blindness. For if that kingdom remains entire, I shall
be nothing, the authority of my word will be of no weight among you. It
is then necessary that this kingdom should be wholly subverted; for ye
began to be unhappy as soon as ye sought a new king.”

<span id="xx.x-p33"></span>We now understand what the Prophet means. At
the same time, we learn from this passage, that God so executes his
judgements, that whatever evil there is, it ought to be ascribed to men.
For the raising of Jeroboam to the kingdom, we certainly allow to have
been rash and unjust; for thereby was violated that celestial decree
made known to David,

<span id="xx.x-p34"></span>“My Son art thou, I have this day begotten
thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles,’ etc., (<span
id="xx.x-p34.1"></span>[Ps. 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008)<span id="xx.x-p34.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xx.x-p35"></span>But who appointed Jeroboam to be king? The
Lord himself. How could it be, that God raised Jeroboam to the throne,
and that he yet by his decree set David, not only over the children of
Abraham, but also over the Gentiles, with reference to Christ who was to
come? God seems here to be inconsistent with himself. By no means; for
when he set David over his chosen people, it was a lawful appointment:
but when he raised Jeroboam to the throne, it was a singular judgement;
so that in God there is no inconsistency. The people at the same time,
who by their suffrages adopted Jeroboam and made him their king, acted
impiously and perversely. “Yet God seems to have directed the whole by
his providence.” True; for before the people knew any thing of the new
king, God had already determined to elect him and resolved also to
punish in this way the defection and ingratitude of Solomon. All these
things are true, that is, that God by his secret counsel had directed
the whole business, and yet that he had no participation in the sin of
the people.

<span id="xx.x-p36"></span>Thus let us learn wisely to admire the secret
judgements of God, and not imitate those profane cavillers, who make a
great noise, because they cannot understand how God thus makes use of
wicked men, and how he directs for the best end what is done by men
wickedly and foolishly. As they do not perceive this, they conclude that
if the Lord governs all things, he must be the author of sin. But the
Scripture, as we see, when it speaks of the wrath and fury of God, does
at the same time set forth to us his rectitude in all his judgements,
and distinguishes between God and men, even as the difference is great;
for God does not turn the perverse designs of men to answer their own
ends — he is a just judge. And yet his purpose is not always apparent to
us: it is, however, our duty reverently and with chastened minds to
admire and adore those mysteries which surpass our comprehension. It
follows —

<span id="xx.xi-p2"></span>**12.** The iniquity of Ephraim *is* bound
up; his sin *is* hid.

<span id="xx.xi-p3"></span>**12.** Obsignatum est peccatum Ephraim

<span id="xx.xi-p4"></span>**13.** The sorrows of a travailing woman

<span id="xx.xi-p5"></span>**13.** Dolores parturientis venient ei; ipse

<span id="xx.xi-p6"></span> 

<span id="xx.xi-p7"></span><span id="xx.xi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xx.xi-p8"></span>He says, first, that *sealed is the iniquity
of Ephraim,* and that *hidden is his sin;* by which words he means, that
hypocrites in vain flatter themselves while God suspends his vengeance;
for though he may connive for a time, yet he does not sleep; nor ought
it to be believed that he is blind, but he seals up the sins of men, and
keeps them inclosed until the proper time for revealing them shall come.
This is the chief point; but the Prophet has expressed something more.
For as Jeremiah says,

<span id="xx.xi-p9"></span>‘The sin of Judah is written with a pen of
iron,  
with the point of a diamond,’ (<span id="xx.xi-p9.2"></span>[Jer
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#001)<span id="xx.xi-p9.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="xx.xi-p10"></span>so now also does Hosea say, that the
iniquity of Ephraim was sealed up. For writings may perish, when they
spread abroad: but what is laid up and put under a seal always remains.
What, then, Hosea now means is, that the people flattered themselves in
vain, while a truce was granted them; for the Lord kept their sins under
his seal; as though he said “God forgets not your iniquity: as he,
however, spares you only for a time, it would be far better to suffer
immediate punishment, for thus the memory of your sin would pass away;
but he now carefully keeps all your iniquities as it were under seal,
and your sins are laid up in store.”

<span id="xx.xi-p11"></span>We now see that what the Prophet means in
this verse is, that the Israelites had made such advances in their sins,
that now no pardon or remission could be hoped for. “God then shall
never be propitious to you, for *your sin is sealed up.”* And this
sentence applies to all those who disguise themselves before God, when
he does not severely treat them, but, on the contrary, kindly sustains
and bears with them. Since, then, they thus disappointed his
forbearance, it was necessary that this should befall them, that he
should seal up their iniquities, and keep inclosed their sins.

<span id="xx.xi-p12"></span><span id="xx.xi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xx.xi-p13"></span>He afterwards says, that the *sorrows of one
in travail would come* on this proud and rebellious people. He pursues
the same subject, but under another figure; for by the sorrows of one in
travail he points out the sudden destruction which befalls careless men.
And this mode of speaking is common in Scripture. *There will come* then
the *sorrows of one in travail* on these men; that is, “As they promise
to themselves continual peace, and are now awakened by any threatenings,
and as they proudly despise both my hand and my word, a sudden
destruction shall crush them.” Thus much as to the beginning of the
verse, *There shall come on them the sorrows of one in travail*

<span id="xx.xi-p14"></span>He then adds, *He is an unwise son,* that
is, he is altogether foolish. Here God reprobates the extreme madness of
the people of Israel, as though he had said, “If any particle of sound
understanding remained in this people, they would at least perceive the
judgement which is impending; and there would then be some hope of a
remedy: but this people are now wholly infatuated.” And this proves
their folly, *for they ought not,* he says, *to stay in the breaking
forth of children* This clause, however, some interpreters explain thus,
“The time will come, they will not stay in the breaking forth of
children.” But rather the contrary is meant by the words; for the
Prophet means, that when the time of birth came, the people would stop
in the breaking forth; which they would not do, were they endued with a
right and sound mind.

<span id="xx.xi-p15"></span>It must be noticed, that the Prophet alludes
to the time of birth; for he had said before, that the sorrows of one in
travail would come on the people of Israel; he now declares that these
sorrows would be filial. Though a woman be in labour and in great danger
in giving birth, she is yet freed in a moment, and as Christ says, joy
and gladness arise from that sorrow, (<span id="xx.xi-p15.1"></span>[Joh
16:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#021)<span id="xx.xi-p15.1"></span>..md)
But the Prophet says that this bringing forth would be very different;
for it would be an abortion, and the child would be retained to putrefy
in the womb. If a woman in the very birth restrains effort and shrinks
in her strength, she destroys the child and herself at the same time;
for she cannot bring forth without exertion. Since then the safety of
the woman depends on the exertion made, the Prophet now says, that the
contrary would be the case with the people of Israel. They are, he says,
like a woman in travail; but they are at the same time blinded with
folly, for they retain the child in the womb and make no effort: so this
parturition must at last be fatal to them. Why? Because they make no
effort to bring forth the child.

<span id="xx.xi-p16"></span>The Prophet by these figurative
representations no doubt glances at the obstinate hardness of the
people; for when they ought to bewail and humble themselves under the
mighty hand of God, we know how perversely they hardened themselves
against all punishment. Since, then, this people did thus as it were
champ the bridle, and at the same time make hard their heart, partly by
their fierce temper, partly by stupidity, partly by desperation, it was
no wonder that the Prophet said that they were an unwise and insane
people*, for they stayed at the breaking forth of children;* that is
they made no effort to obtain the wished-for end to their evils. For
when the Lord afflicts us, and we bring forth, this bringing forth is
our deliverance. Now, how can there be deliverance except we hate
ourselves for our sins, except we raise up our minds to God, and thus
open a passage for God’s grace? But when we oppose God pertinaciously
through our fierceness and stupidity, it is the same as if one closed up
every avenue. We now then see how appropriate is this metaphor used by
the Prophet, when he says that the people were mad; for when the time of
bringing, forth came, they *stayed in the breaking forth*; that is, at
the opening of the womb, for this is what the Prophet means by the word.
Since then they stayed in the very opening, and restrained, as it were,
every effort, and ceased from all strivings, they must have perished. We
now see what the obstinacy of men produces when they harden themselves,
when they thus contracts as it were, within narrow limits their heart
and mind and all their faculties. For when a woman who is in travail
restrains all efforts, she wilfully seeks death for herself: so they do
the same who harden themselves against all punishments, and especially
when the time of birth is come; and to this the word, breaking forth,
refers: for when the Lord strikes us not only once, but continues to lay
on us many stripes, so that we must either repent or perish for ever, it
is the ripened time for bringing forth; for God then leads us to an
extremity, and nothing remains for us but to humble ourselves under his
mighty hand or to perish. The Prophet then calls that condition, the
breaking forth, in which obstinate men continue, who will not obey God.
It is necessary to join with these verses the two which follow: this I
shall do to-morrow.

<span id="xx.xiv-p7"></span> 

<span id="xx.xiv-p8"></span><span id="xx.xiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xx.xiv-p9"></span>The Prophet, I doubt not, continues here the
same subject, namely, that the Israelites could not bear the mercy
offered to them by God, though he speaks here more fully. God seems to
promise redemption, but he does this conditionally: they are then
mistaken, in my judgement, who take these words in the same sense as
when God, after having reproved and threatened, mitigates the severity
of his instruction, and adds consolation by offering his grace. But the
import of this passage is different; for God, as we have already said,
does not here simply promise salvation, but shows that he is indeed
ready to save, but that the wickedness of the people, as it has been
said, was an impediment in the way. Let us, however, more carefully
examine the words.

<span id="xx.xiv-p10"></span>*From the hand of the grave,* he says. By
the hand he doubtless means power: for Jerome does nothing but trifle,
when he speaks here of works, and says that the works of the grave are
our sins. But this is far away from the mind of the Prophet. It is
indeed a metaphor common in Scripture, that the hand is put for power or
authority. Then it is, *I will redeem them from the power of the grave,
I will redeem them from death;* that is, except they resist, I will
become willingly their Redeemer. Some have therefore rendered the
passage in the subjunctive mood, “From the hand of the grave I would
redeem them, from death I would deliver them.” But there is no need to
change the tense, though, as I have said, they who do so faithfully set
forth the design of the Prophet. But lest any one say that this is too
remote from the words, the text of the Prophet may be very well
understood, though the future tense be preserved. *I will* then *redeem
them,* as far as this depends on me; for a condition is to be introduced
as though God came forth and declared that he was present to fulfil the
office of a Redeemer. What, then, does stand in the way? Even the
hardness of the people; for they would have preferred to perish a
hundred times rather than to turn to the Lord, as we shall presently
see.

<span id="xx.xiv-p11"></span>He afterwards adds, *I will be thy
perdition, O death; I will be thy excision, O grave.* By these words,
the Prophet more distinctly sets forth the power of God, and
magnificently extols it, lest men should think that there is no way open
to him to save, when no hope according to the judgement of the flesh
appears. Hence the Prophet says, “Though men are now dead, there is yet
nothing to prevent God to quicken them. How so? For he *is the ruin of
death, and the excision of the grave;”* that is, “Though death should
swallow up all men, though the grave should consume them, yet God is
superior to both death and the grave, for he can slay death, for he can
abolish the grave.” We now perceive the real meaning of the Prophet.

<span id="xx.xiv-p12"></span>And we may learn from this passage, that
when men perish, God still continues like himself, and that neither his
power, by which he is mighty to save the world, is extinguished, nor his
purpose changed, so as not to be always ready to help; but that the
obstinacy of men rejects the grace which has been provided, and which
God willingly and bountifully offers. This is one thing. We may secondly
learn, that the power of God is not to be measured by our rule: were we
lost a hundred times, let God be still regarded as a Saviour. Should
then despair at any time so cast us down, that we cannot lay hold on any
of God’s promises, let this passage come to our minds, which says, that
God is the excision of death, and the destruction of the grave. “But
death is nigh to us, what then can we hope for any more?” This is to
say, that God is not superior to death: but when death claims so much
power over men, how much more power has God over death itself? Let us
then feel assured that God is the destruction of death, which means that
death can no more destroy; that is, that death is deprived of that power
by which men are naturally destroyed; and that though we may lie in the
grave, God is yet the excision of the grave itself. This is the
application of what is here taught. But some one gives this version, “I
will be thy perdition to death,” as if this was addressed to the people:
it is an absurd perversion of the whole passage, and deprives us of a
most useful doctrine.

<span id="xx.xiv-p13"></span>But many interpreters, thinking this
passage to be quoted by Paul, have explained what is here said of
Christ, and have in many respects erred. They have said first, that God
promises redemption here without any condition; but we see that the
design of the Prophet was far different. They have then assumed, that
this is said in the person of Christ, “From the hand of the grave will I
redeem them.” They have at the same time thought, with too much
refinement, that *the grave* or *hell* is put for the torments with
which the reprobate are visited, or for the place itself where they are
tormented. But the Prophet repeats the same thing in different words,
and well known is this character of the Hebrew style. The grave then
here differs not from death; though Jerome labours and contends that the
grave means what is wholly different from death: but the whole of what
he says is frivolous. They have then been deceived as to these words.
And then into the words of the Prophet “I will be thy excision, O hell,
(or grave,”) they have introduced the word, bait, and have allegorically
explained it of Christ, that he was like a hook: for as a worm, when
fastened to the hook, and swallowed by a fish, becomes death to it; so
also Christ, as they have said, when committed to the sepulchre, became
a fatal bait; for as the fish are taken by the hook, so death was taken
by the bait of the death of Christ. And these vain subtilties have been
received with great applause: hence under the whole Papacy it is
received without doubt as a divine truth, that Christ was the bait of
death. But yet let any one narrowly examine the words of the Prophet,
and he will see that they have ignorantly and shamefully abused the
testimony of the Prophet. And we ought especially to take care, that the
meaning of Scripture should be preserved true and certain.

<span id="xx.xiv-p14"></span>But let us see what to answer to that which
is said of Paul quoting this passage. The solution is not difficult. The
Apostles do not avowedly at all times adduce passages, which in their
whole context apply to the subject they handle; but sometimes they
allude to a word only, sometimes they apply a passage to a subject in
the way of resemblance, and sometimes they bring forward passages as
testimonies. When the Apostles use the testimonies of Scripture, then
the genuine and real truth must be sought out; but when they glance only
at one word, there is no occasion to make any anxious inquiry; and when
they quote any passage of Scripture in the way of resemblance, it is a
too scrupulous anxiety to seek out how all the parts agree. But it is
quite evident that Paul, in <span id="xx.xiv-p14.1"></span>[1co
15:54-57](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054.md)<span
id="xx.xiv-p14.1"></span>, has not quoted the testimony of the Prophet
for the purpose of confirming the doctrine of which he speaks.  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) What then? As the resurrection of the
flesh was a truth very difficult to be believed, nay, wholly contrary to
the judgement of nature, Paul says that it is no matter of wonder,
inasmuch as Christ will come to raise us. How so? Because it is the
peculiar prerogative of God to be the perdition of death and the
destruction of the grave; as though he said, “Were men to putrefy a
thousand times, God would still retain that power of which he declared
when he said, that he would be the ruin of death and the destruction of
the grave.” Let us then know, that, though the judgement of nature
rejects the truth, yet God is endued with that incomprehensible power by
which he can raise us from a state of putrefaction; nay, since he
created the world from nothing, he will also raise us up from the grave,
for he is the death of death, the grave of the grave, the ruin of ruin,
and the destruction of destruction: and the simple object of Paul is, to
extol by these striking words that incredible power of God, which is
beyond the reach of human understanding.

<span id="xx.xiv-p16"></span>Now were any one to quote for the same
purpose this place from the Psalms, “The Lord’s are the issues of death,
(<span id="xx.xiv-p16.1"></span>[Ps
68:20](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#020)<span id="xx.xiv-p16.1"></span>,.md)
would it be needful to inquire in what sense David said this or of what
time he speaks? By no means; but what is spoken of is the unchangeable
prerogative and power of God, of which he can never be deprived, so also
in this place we see what he declares by Hosea, and what he would have
done, had there not been an obstacle in the ingratitude of the people;
for he says *I will be thy ruin, O grave; I will be thy death, O death*
And since God has promised this, let us feel assured that we shall at
last find this to be true as to ourselves. We now then perceive how the
real meaning of the Prophet agrees with the subject handled by Paul.

<span id="xx.xiv-p17"></span>It now follows, *consolation,* or,
*repentance is hid from my eye;* for <span id="xx.xiv-p17.1"></span>נחם,
*nuchem,* means both. <span id="xx.xiv-p17.2"></span>נחם, *nuchem,*
signifies to repent, and it signifies to receive consolation. If the
term, consolation, be approved, the sense will be, “There is no reason
for any one to wonder that I speak so sharply, and do nothing but
thunder against my people; for consolation has now no place among them;
therefore consolation is hid from my eyes.” And this was the case,
because the irreclaimable wickedness of the people did not allow God to
change his severity into mildness, so as to give any hope of pardon and
salvation. In this sense then it is said that consolation was hid from
his eyes. But if the word, repentance, be more approved, it will show
exactly the same thing, — that it was fully determined to destroy that
people. “There is then no reason for you to hope that I can become
milder in course of time; for repentance is hid from mine eyes. This
shall remain fixed, you shall be reduced to nothing; for ye are past all
hope.” We then see that both the words refer to the same thing, that God
takes away from this miserable and reprobate people every hope of
salvation. Now it follows —

<span id="xx.xv"></span>

<span id="xx.xv-p1"></span><span id="xx.xv-p1.1"></span>[Hosea
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015.md)<span id="xx.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xx.xv-p2"></span>**15.** Though he be fruitful among *his*
brethren, an east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up
from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain
shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.

<span id="xx.xv-p3"></span>**15.** Quia ipse inter fratres fructum

ipse diripiet thesaurum omnis vasis desiderabilis.

<span id="xx.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xx.xv-p5"></span><span id="xx.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xx.xv-p6"></span>God again confirms what had been said that
Israel in vain trusted in their strength and fortresses and that certain
destruction was nigh them on account of their sins which they followed
without any limits or restraint. But the Prophet begins with these
words, *He among brethren will increase* He alludes, I doubt not, (as
other interpreters have also noticed,) to the blessing of the tribe of
Ephraim, which is mentioned in <span id="xx.xv-p6.1"></span>[Ge
48](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#000.md)<span id="xx.xv-p6.1"></span>; for
we know that though Ephraim was the younger, he was yet placed first by
Jacob, so that he was preferred in honour to his brother, who was the
firstborn: and further, the prophecy, we know, which Jacob then
announced, was really fulfilled; for the tribe of Ephraim excelled, both
in number and in other respects, all the rest, except only the tribe of
Judah. Ephraim had evidently gained high eminence among the whole
people. But when he ought to have ascribed all this to the gratuitous
goodness of God, he became inflated with pride. This ingratitude the
Prophet now reproves, *He*, he says, *among his brethren will increase:*
but whence this increase? Whence was this so great a dignity, except
that he was preferred to Manasseh, who by right of nature was the first?
Now it was not enough for this wretched people to forget so great a
favour of God, without at the same time abusing their wealth in
fostering pride, and without hardening themselves in contempt of God.
For whence came so great an audacity in their rebellion, whence so great
stupidity and so great a madness as to despise the judgement of God,
except from this — that they had increased among their brethren?

<span id="xx.xv-p7"></span>Though, then, he increases among his
brethren, yet *there shall come an east wind, the wind of Jehovah, which
shall dry his spring, and his fountain shall be dried up* Here God
declares what had been before mentioned, that it was in his power to
take away from the people of Israel what he had gratuitously bestowed,
as he could dry up the fountains whenever he wished. And he applies a
most suitable similitude. As the east wind, he says, dries and burns up,
and if it long prevails, the fountains will be dried up; so will I, he
says, dry up all the springs of Ephraim. Whether or not he thinks that
he possesses more vigour than fountains, which have an exhaustless
source, it is certain that fountains dry up whenever it so pleases me.
*I will then dry up the springs and fountains of Ephraim:* though he
thinks that he draws from a deep fountain, yet the wind, when it shall
rise, will dry up his whole vigour and moisture. We now understand what
the Prophet means.

<span id="xx.xv-p8"></span>Now as to the words, some render <span
id="xx.xv-p8.1"></span>קדים, *kodim,* improperly, the south wind; for it
means the east wind: and then others incorrectly explain *the wind of
Jehovah,* as meaning a strong wind. I indeed allow that what is unusual
is often said to be divine; but in this place the Prophet intended to
express, that God has winds ever ready, by which he can dry up whatever
vigour there may be or seem to be in men. Hence the name of Jehovah is
set in opposition to natural causes or means. It shall not then be a
fortuitous wind that shall dry up the springs of Ephraim, but one raised
up by the counsel and certain purpose of God; as though he said, “This
wind will be the scourge of God.”

<span id="xx.xv-p9"></span>We are then taught here, that when God for a
time blesses us, we must beware lest we abuse his favour and entertain a
false confidence, as we see that Ephraim had done: for he flourished
among his brethren, and then raised up his head; and thus he obliterated
God’s favour through his pride and haughtiness. We ought then, when
prosperous, ever to fear, lest something like this should happen to us.
The more kindly then God deals with us, the more constantly ought we to
be roused up to pray to him, that he may be pleased to carry on his work
to the end, lest we slumber in our enjoyments while God is indulgent to
us. This, in the first place, we ought to bear in mind. Then we must
also notice the warning of the prophet, that God can suddenly, and, as
it were, in a moment, upset the prosperity of men, that there is nothing
in this world which cannot be immediately changed whenever God withdraws
from us his favour. This comparison then ought often to occur to us;
when the air is tranquil, when the season is quiet, a wind will in a
moment rise up, which will dry the earth, which will also make dry the
fountains; and yet the vigour of fountains seems to be perpetual; what
then may not happen to us? Cannot the Lord at any moment make us dry,
since we have in ourselves no source of strength? He might indeed have
said in this place what we find in the 40th chapter of Isaiah  <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) that man is like the flower that soon
fadeth; but he intended to express something more profound; for this
people, being deeply fixed in their own strength, thought that they were
supplied by exhaustless fountains, and that their vigour could not be
dried up: hence he says, “Though thou hast fountains and springs, yet
God will dry thee up; for he will find a wind that has power, as
experience proves, to dry up springs and fountains.”

<span id="xx.xv-p11"></span>But it follows, *It will rob the treasure of
every desirable vessel* This may seem to be improperly applied to wind;
but yet the meaning of the Prophet is sufficiently clear, even this,
that nothing shall remain untouched in the tribe of Ephraim, when the
Lord shall raise up his wind. “However hidden,” he seems to say, “your
treasures may be, yet this wind shall penetrate into the inmost
recesses, so that nothing shall be safe from its violence.” In short,
the Prophet means, that the force of God’s vengeance would be so
violent, that Ephraim could not be secure in any of his fortresses; for
the wind of God would penetrate unto the very inmost springs of the
earth. This is the meaning. It follows —

<span id="xx.xvi"></span>

<span id="xx.xvi-p1"></span><span id="xx.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Hosea

<span id="xx.xvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xx.xvi-p5"></span><span id="xx.xvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xx.xvi-p6"></span>This is the conclusion of the discourse:
this verse has then been improperly separated from the former chapter
 <span id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) ; for the Prophet enters not here
on a new subject, but only confirms what he had said of the ultimate
destruction of Samaria and of the whole kingdom. *Samaria* then *shall
be desolated;* as though he said “I have already often denounced on you
what you believe not, that destruction is nigh at hand; of this be now
persuaded; but if you believe not, God will yet execute what he has
determined, and what he now pronounces by my mouth.” At the same time he
adds the cause, *For they have provoked their God* That they might not
complain that they were severely dealt with, he says, that they only
suffered the punishment which they deserved. He also specifies the kind
of destruction that was to be, *They shall fall by the sword, their
children shall be dashed in pieces, and their pregnant women shall be
torn asunder,* that the child may be extracted from the womb. In saying
that the citizens of Samaria, and the inhabitants of the whole country,
shall fall by the sword, he doubtless intimates that God would make use
of this kind of punishment by sending for enemies who would consign them
to destruction.

<span id="xx.xvi-p8"></span>We now then see what is included in the
words of the Prophet. He first shows that it was all over with Samaria
and the whole kingdom of Israel; as God could by no means bring them to
repentance, he would now take vengeance on so desperate an obstinacy. He
afterwards shows that God would do this justly, because he had been
provoked; and, lastly, he shows what kind their punishment would be.
That they might not think that the Assyrians would come by chance, the
Prophet says that this army, which was to invade and destroy the country
of Samaria, would be, as it were, conducted by the hand of God; for
though the Assyrians wished to extend their own borders, and were
influenced by their own avarice and cupidity, yet God would use them as
instruments to execute his own judgement; and that they might know how
dreadful the vengeance would be, he relates two kinds of evils, — that
their children would be dashed in pieces, and that their women would be
rent asunder, and their offspring extracted from their wombs. Even to
speak of this is horrible; and it is what never takes place, except when
enemies are greatly enraged and extremely provoked. We now then
comprehend the meaning of the Prophet.

<span id="xx.xvi-p9"></span>But if any one objects and says, that
infants, and babes as yet concealed in the wombs of their mothers,
deserve not such a grievous punishment, as they have not hitherto
merited such a thing; it may be answered, that the whole human race are
guilty before God, so that infants though not yet come forth to the
light, are yet included as being under guilt; so that God cannot be
charged with cruelty, though he may use his own right towards them. And
further, we hear what he declares in many places, that he will devolve
the sins of parents on their children. Since it is so, let us learn to
acquiesce in these awful judgements of God, though very repugnant to our
feelings; for we know that we must not contend with God, and that it
would be extreme presumption to do so; nay, it would be impious
audacity. Though then the reason for this punishment may not appear to
us, we ought yet reverently to regard this judgement of God. We may
moreover thus reason — If infants be not spared, even those as yet hid
in the mother’s womb, what will become of adults? what will become of
the old, who through their whole life have continued to provoke the
vengeance of God? The Lord no doubt intended by these words to terrify
those godless despisers of his word, with whom he had to do. “How great
a judgement,” he says, “hangs over you, and how tremendous! since your
infants shall not be exempted: for I shall involve you in the same
judgement, when they shall be dashed against the stones, after having
been drawn out of their mothers’ womb. When such a dreadful punishment
shall be inflicted on them, what shall be done to you? for the cause of
the evil exists in you.” We have now then explained this verse. Then
follows an exhortation.

<span id="xx.vi-p4"></span> A great number of MSS have <span
id="xx.vi-p4.1"></span>ב, *beth*, instead of <span
id="xx.vi-p4.2"></span>כ, *caph*, before the word, “pastures.” But to
connect the first two words in this verse with the last verse, as Bishop
*Horsley* does, is certainly not right; for the two different times here
evidently referred to are thereby confounded. Though *Calvin* in this,
as in some other instances, does not settle the grammatical
construction, he yet sets forth the real meaning of the passage. God
says, that he knew the people of Israel, both in the desert and in
“their pastures;” that is, in the fertile land of Canaan; and then he
states the effect which their pastures had upon them. What favors the
substitution of <span id="xx.vi-p4.3"></span>ב for <span
id="xx.vi-p4.4"></span>כ is, that the former is used before “desert,”
and “the land of droughts,” in the preceding verse. The verb “to know”
is to be understood at the beginning of this verse. The two verses, 5
and 6, may be thus rendered: —

<span id="xx.vi-p5"></span>5**. I knew thee in the desert,  
In the land of droughts;**

<span id="xx.vi-p6"></span>*6*<span id="xx.vi-p6.1"></span>. In their
pastures **also**<span id="xx.vi-p6.2"></span> when they were filled;  
They were filled, and raised up was their heart;  
Hence they forgat me.

<span id="xx.vi-p7"></span>The change of persons from “thee” to “them”
is common throughout this book. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_93"></span>[94](cc26019.htm#fr_93.md) <span
id="xx.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xx.ix-p6"></span> Some render this “the lioness,” but it is
more consonant with this passage to render it “lion,” meaning, as its
name, <span id="xx.ix-p6.1"></span>לביא, *labia,* is taken to signify, a
cruel old lion. The word in the former verse is <span
id="xx.ix-p6.2"></span>שחל, *shechel*, which means a fierce lion. So
that the Lord compares himself to the most devouring and the fiercest
species of the lion tribe. The Hebrews have other names for lions,
designative of their peculiar nature of their age. <span
id="xx.ix-p6.3"></span>כפיר, *caphir*, is a young lion; <span
id="xx.ix-p6.4"></span>אריה, *arie*, a grown up and a rapacious lion,
<span id="xx.ix-p6.5"></span>שחף, *shichets*, a lion of middle age and
fierce; and <span id="xx.ix-p6.6"></span>ליש, *lice*, an old lion. With
respect to the two mentioned here, there is a gradation, according to
the sense of the passage. The first, in verse 7, is a lion in middle
age, bold and ferocious; but the second, in verse 8, is one still older,
but retaining his vigor, and still more ferocious and devouring. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_94"></span>[95](cc26019.htm#fr_94.md) <span
id="xx.x-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xx.x-p4"></span> Bishop Horsley’s rendering of this verse
which was that of *Rivet*, is the following — “It is thy destruction, O
Israel, that upon me (alone it lies) to help thee.” He adds in a note —
“Thy great privilege, to have God alone for thy defense, becomes the
occasion of thy destruction. In my wrath I withdrew my special aid; and
since forsaken by me, thou hast no other helper, thy ruin must ensue.

<span id="xx.x-p5"></span>In this instance our version, as to the first
clause, seems preferable to that offered by Calvin. The verb is not in
the third person, but the second. Its final radica; letter is <span
id="xx.x-p5.1"></span>ת, *tau*, and the same letter is characteristic of
the second person, and it is not here doubled; another instance of which
we find in <span id="xx.x-p5.2"></span>[Eze
28:17](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#017.md)<span id="xx.x-p5.2"></span>,
<span id="xx.x-p5.3"></span>שהת חכמתך. ‘Thou hast corrupted,’ or
‘destroyed, thy wisdom.’

<span id="xx.x-p6"></span>There is reason to doubt the correctness of
our version, as well as that of Calvin, as to the second clause.
Literally it is, “Though in me for thy help,” which seems to mean this,
“Though it was in my power to help thee.”

<span id="xx.x-p7"></span>But if the first word of the verse be taken as
a substantive, as it is by many critics, then the first clause may be
considered as having reference to the preceding verses. The meaning then
would be, that such would be Israel’s destruction, though at the same
time there was for him help in God, if he had sought it: —

<span id="xx.x-p8"></span>Such thy destruction, Israel!  
Though in me there was help for thee.

<span id="xx.x-p9"></span>Then follows the next verse, — I will be *the
same*: thy king, where is he? etc. For changing <span
id="xx.x-p9.1"></span>אהי into <span id="xx.x-p9.2"></span>איה, the
authority is very small, only one MS., and another doubtful: and there
is no need, and indeed the sense is thereby injured. In the Geneva Bible
it is rendered, ‘I am.’ The future tense in Hebrew includes often the
present as well as what is future. To give it its full meaning, it must
be thus rendered, ‘I am and will be,’ that is, thy help; for he had
before said, that there had been help for them in him. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_95"></span>[96](cc26019.htm#fr_95.md) <span
id="xx.xiv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xx.xiv-p4"></span> “Very many MSS. and some editions read
<span id="xx.xiv-p4.1"></span>דברך; and <span
id="xx.xiv-p4.2"></span>דבר in Hebrew is to destroy, to subdue.” —
*Newcome.*

<span id="xx.xiv-p5"></span>This passage presents an instance of that
useless kind of criticism, by which an attempt has been made to
introduce a verbal agreement between sentences in the Old Testament and
the supposed quotations of them in the New. The apostles had more regard
to the meaning than to words.

<span id="xx.xiv-p6"></span>*Horsley* has a long note on the two words
<span id="xx.xiv-p6.1"></span>דבר, predition or destruction, and <span
id="xx.xiv-p6.2"></span>קטב, excision or extirpation; and he renders the
first by “pestilence,” and the second by “burning plague.” That the two
words are so used he proves satisfactorily. But when applied to death
and the grave, they of course can retain only their reading idea of
something destructive, extirpating, and ruinous. Words in all languages
have their primary and secondary meanings: and to retain the primary
meaning in a translation would often be improper. Calvin has in this
instance showed more judgment than the Bishop.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[97](cc26019.htm#fr_96.md) <span
id="xx.xiv-p14.2"></span>

<span id="xx.xiv-p15"></span> “The Apostle’s triumphant exclamation, ‘O
death,’ etc., is an allusion indeed to this text of Hosea, an indirect
allusion, but no citation of it.” — *Bishop Horsley.*

<span id="xx.xv-p10"></span> <span id="xx.xv-p10.1"></span>[Isa

<span id="fn_98"></span>[99](cc26019.htm#fr_98.md) <span
id="xx.xvi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xx.xvi-p7"></span> The fourteenth chapter begins in the
original with this verse; but it has been thought better to retain the
division of our own version.
