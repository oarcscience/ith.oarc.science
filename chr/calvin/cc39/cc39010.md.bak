<span id="xi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="xi.i"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p1"></span><span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
4:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#001.md)<span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p2"></span>**1.** Let a man so account of us, as of the
ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.

<span id="xi.i-p3"></span>**1.** Sic nos aestimet homo ut ministros
Christi, et dispensatores arcanorum Dei.

<span id="xi.i-p4"></span>**2.** Moreover it is required in stewards,
that a man be found faithful.

<span id="xi.i-p5"></span>**2.** Caeterum in ministris hoc quaeritur, ut
fidelis aliquis reperiatur.

<span id="xi.i-p6"></span>**3.** But with me it is a very small thing
that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not
mine own self.

<span id="xi.i-p7"></span>**3.** Mihi viro pro minimo est, a vobis
diiudicari, aut ab humano die:  <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md)
imo nec me ipsum diiudico.

<span id="xi.i-p9"></span>**4.** For I know nothing by myself; yet am I
not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.

<span id="xi.i-p10"></span>**4.** Nullius enim rei mihi sum conscius:
sed non in hoc sum justificatus. Porro qui me diiudicat, Dominus est.

<span id="xi.i-p11"></span>**5.** Therefore judge nothing before the
time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden
things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts:
and then shall every man have praise of God.

<span id="xi.i-p12"></span>**5.** Itaque ne ante tempus quicquam
iudicetis, donec venerit Dominus, qui et illustrabit abscondita
tenebrarum, et manifestabit consilia cordium; et tunc laus erit cuique a
Deo.

<span id="xi.i-p13"></span> 

<span id="xi.i-p14"></span><span id="xi.i-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p15"></span>**1.** *Let a man so account of us* As it was
a matter of no little importance to see the Church in this manner torn
by corrupt factions, from the likings or dislikings that were
entertained towards individuals, he enters into a still more lengthened
discussion as to the ministry of the word. Here there are *three* things
to be considered in their order. In the *first* place, Paul describes
the office of a pastor of the Church. *Secondly*, he shows, that it is
not enough for any one to produce a title, or even to undertake the duty
— a faithful administration of the office being requisite. *Thirdly*, as
the judgment formed of him by the Corinthians was preposterous,  <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) he calls both himself and them to the
judgment-seat of Christ. In the first place, then, he teaches in what
estimation every teacher in the Church ought to be held. In this
department he modifies his discourse in such a manner as neither, on the
one hand, to lower the credit of the ministry, nor, on the other, to
assign to man more than is expedient. For both of these things are
exceedingly dangerous, because, when ministers are lowered, contempt of
the word arises,  <span id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) while, on the
other hand, if they are extolled beyond measure, they abuse liberty, and
become “wanton against the Lord.” (<span id="xi.i-p17.2"></span>[1Ti
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#011)<span id="xi.i-p17.2"></span>..md)
Now the medium observed by Paul consists in this, that he calls them
*ministers of Christ*; by which he intimates, that they ought to apply
themselves not to their own work but to that of the Lord, who has hired
them as his servants, and that they are not appointed to bear rule in an
authoritative manner in the Church, but are subject to Christ’s
authority  <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) — in short, that they
are servants, not masters.

<span id="xi.i-p19"></span>As to what he adds — *stewards of the
mysteries of God*, he expresses hereby the kind of service. By this he
intimates, that their office extends no farther than this, that they are
*stewards of the mysteries of God* In other words, what the Lord has
committed to their charge they deliver over to men from hand to hand —
as the expression is  <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) — not what
they themselves might choose. “For this purpose has God chosen them as
ministers of his Son, that he might through them communicate to men his
heavenly wisdom, and hence they ought not to move a step beyond this.”
He appears, at the same time, to give a stroke indirectly to the
Corinthians, who, leaving in the background the heavenly mysteries, had
begun to hunt with excessive eagerness after strange inventions, and
hence they valued their teachers for nothing but profane learning. It is
an honorable distinction that he confers upon the gospel when he terms
its contents *the mysteries of God.* But as the sacraments are connected
with these mysteries as appendages, it follows, that those who have the
charge of administering the word are the authorized *stewards* of them
also.

<span id="xi.i-p21"></span><span id="xi.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p22"></span>**2.** *But it is required in ministers*
 <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) It is as though he had said, it
is not enough to be a *steward* if there be not an upright stewardship.
Now the rule of an upright stewardship, is to conduct one’s self in it
with fidelity. It is a passage that ought to be carefully observed, for
we see how haughtily  <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) Papists
require that everything that they do and teach should have the authority
of law, simply on the ground of their being called pastors. On the other
hand, Paul is so far from being satisfied with the mere title, that, in
his view, it is not even enough that there is a legitimate call, unless
the person who is called conducts himself in the office with fidelity.
On every occasion, therefore, on which Papists hold up before us the
mask of a name, for the purpose of maintaining the tyranny of their
idol, let our answer be, that Paul requires more than this from the
*ministers of Christ*, though, at the same time, the Pope and his
attendant train are wanting not merely in fidelity in the discharge of
the office, but also in the ministry itself, if everything is duly
considered.

<span id="xi.i-p25"></span>This passage, however, militates, not merely
against wicked teachers, but also against all that have any other object
in view than the glory of Christ and the edification of the Church. For
every one that teaches the truth is not necessarily faithful, but, only
he who desires from the heart to serve the Lord and advance Christ’s
kingdom. Nor is it without good reason that Augustine assigns to
*hirelings*, (<span id="xi.i-p25.1"></span>[Joh
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#012)<span id="xi.i-p25.1"></span>,.md) a
middle place between the *wolves* and the good teachers. As to Christ’s
requiring *wisdom* also on the part of the good *steward*, (<span
id="xi.i-p25.2"></span>[Lu 12:42](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#042.md)<span
id="xi.i-p25.2"></span>,) he speaks, it is true, in that passage with
greater clearness than Paul, but the meaning is the same. For the
*faithfulness* of which Christ speaks is uprightness of conscience,
which must be accompanied with sound and prudent counsel. By a faithful
minister Paul means one who, with knowledge as well as uprightness,
 <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) discharges the office of a good
and faithful minister.

<span id="xi.i-p27"></span><span id="xi.i-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p28"></span>**3.** *But with me it is a very small thing*
It remained that he should bring before their view his *faithfulness*,
that the Corinthians might judge of him from this, but, as their
judgment was corrupted, he throws it aside and appeals to the
judgment-seat of Christ. The Corinthians erred in this, that they looked
with amazement at foreign masks, and gave no heed to the true and proper
marks of distinction.  <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) He,
accordingly, declares with great confidence, that he despises a
perverted and blind judgment of this sort. In this way, too, he, on the
one hand, admirably exposes the vanity of the false Apostles who made
the mere applause of men their aim, and reckoned themselves happy if
they were held in admiration; and, on the other hand, he severely
chastises the arrogance  <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) of the
Corinthians, which was the reason why they were so much blinded in their
judgment.

<span id="xi.i-p31"></span>But, it is asked, on what ground it was
allowable for Paul, not merely to set aside the censure of one Church,
but to set himself above the judgment of men? for this is a condition
common to all pastors — to be judged of by the Church. I answer, that it
is the part of a good pastor to submit both his doctrine and his life
for examination to the judgment of the Church, and that it is the sign
of a good conscience not to shun the light of careful inspection. In
this respect Paul, without doubt, was prepared for submitting himself to
the judgment of the Corinthian Church, and for being called to render an
account both of his life and of his doctrine, had there been among them
a proper scrutiny,  <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) as he often
assigns them this power, and of his own accord entreats them to be
prepared to judge aright. But when a faithful pastor sees that he is
borne down by unreasonable and perverse affections, and that justice and
truth have no place, he ought to appeal to God, and betake himself to
his judgment-seat, regardless of human opinion, especially when he
cannot secure that a true and proper knowledge of matters shall be
arrived at.

<span id="xi.i-p33"></span>If, then, the Lord’s servants would bear in
mind that they must act in this manner, let them allow their doctrine
and life to be brought to the test, nay more, let them voluntarily
present themselves for this purpose; and if anything is objected against
them, let them not decline to answer. But if they see that they are
condemned without being heard in their own defense, and that judgment is
passed upon them without their being allowed a hearing, let them raise
up their minds to such a pitch of magnanimity, as that, despising the
opinions of men, they will fearlessly wait for God as their judge. In
this manner the Prophets of old, having to do with refractory persons,
 <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) and such as had the audacity to
despise the word of God in their administration of it, required to raise
themselves aloft, in order to tread under foot that diabolical
obstinacy, which manifestly tended to overthrow at once the authority of
God and the light of truth. Should any one, however, when opportunity is
given for defending himself, or at least when he has need to clear
himself, appeal to God by way of subterfuge, he will not thereby make
good his innocence, but will rather discover his consummate impudence.
 <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md)

<span id="xi.i-p36"></span>*Or of man’s day.* While others explain it in
another manner, the simpler way, in my opinion, is to understand the
word *day* as used metaphorically to mean *judgment*, because there are
stated *days* for administering justice, and the accused are summoned to
appear on a certain *day* He calls it *man’s day*  <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) when judgment is pronounced, not
according to truth, or in accordance with the word of the Lord, but
according to the humor or rashness of men,  <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) and in short, when God does not
preside. “Let men,” says he, “*sit* for judgment as they please: it is
enough for me that God will annul whatever they have pronounced.”

<span id="xi.i-p39"></span>*Nay, I judge not mine own self.* The meaning
is: “I do not venture to judge myself, though I know myself best; how
then will you judge me, to whom I am less intimately known?” Now he
proves that he does not venture to judge himself by this, that though he
is not conscious to himself of anything wrong, he is not thereby
acquitted in the sight of God. Hence he concludes, that what the
Corinthians assume to themselves, belongs exclusively to God. “As for
me,” says he, “when I have carefully examined myself, I perceive that I
am not so clear-sighted as to discern thoroughly my true character; and
hence I leave this to the judgment of God, who alone can judge, and to
whom this authority exclusively belongs. As for you, then, on what
ground will you make pretensions to something more?”

<span id="xi.i-p40"></span>As, however, it were very absurd to reject
all kinds of judgment, whether of individuals respecting themselves, or
of one individual respecting his brother, or of all together respecting
their pastor, let it be understood that Paul speaks here not of the
actions of men, which may be reckoned good or bad according to the word
of the Lord, but of the eminence of each individual, which ought not to
be estimated according to men’s humors. It belongs to God alone to
determine what distinction every one holds, and what honor he deserves.
The Corinthians, however, despising Paul, groundlessly extolled others
to the skies, as though they had at their command that knowledge which
belonged exclusively to God. This is what he previously made mention of
as *man*’*s day* — when men mount the throne of judgment, and, as if
they were gods, anticipate the day of Christ, who alone is appointed by
the Father as judge, allot to every one his station of honor, assign to
some a high place, and degrade others to the lowest seats. But what rule
of distinction do they observe? They look merely to what appears openly;
and thus what in their view is high and honorable, is in many instances
*an abomination in the sight of God*. (<span id="xi.i-p40.1"></span>[Lu
16:15](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015)<span id="xi.i-p40.1"></span>..md)
If any one farther objects, that the ministers of the word may in this
world be distinguished by their works, as trees *by their fruits*,
(<span id="xi.i-p40.2"></span>[Mt
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#016)<span id="xi.i-p40.2"></span>,.md) I
admit that this is true, but we must consider with whom Paul had to
deal. It was with persons who, in judging, looked to nothing but show
and pomp, and arrogated to themselves a power which Christ., while in
this world, refrained from using — that of assigning to every one his
*seat in the kingdom of God*. (<span id="xi.i-p40.3"></span>[Mt
20:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#023)<span id="xi.i-p40.3"></span>..md)
He does not, therefore, prohibit us from esteeming those whom we have
found to be faithful workmen, and pronouncing them to be such; nor, on
the other hand, from judging persons to be bad workmen according to the
word of God, but he condemns that rashness which is practiced, when some
are preferred above others in a spirit of ambition — not according to
their merits, but without examination of the case.  <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md)

<span id="xi.i-p42"></span><span id="xi.i-p42.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p43"></span>**4.** *I am not conscious to myself of
anything faulty.* Let us observe that Paul speaks here not of his whole
life, but simply of the office of apostleship. For if he had been
altogether unconscious to himself of anything wrong,  <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) that would have been a groundless
complaint which he makes in <span id="xi.i-p44.3"></span>[Ro
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015.md)<span id="xi.i-p44.3"></span>,
where he laments that *the evil which he would not*, *that he does*, and
that he is by sin kept back from giving himself up entirely to God.
Paul, therefore, felt *sin dwelling in him*, and confessed it; but as to
his apostleship, (which is the subject that is here treated of,) he had
conducted himself with so much integrity and fidelity, that his
conscience did not accuse him as to anything. This is a protestation of
no common character, and of such a nature as clearly shows the piety and
sanctity of his breast;  <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) and yet
he says that *he is not thereby justified,* that is, pure, and
altogether free from guilt in the sight of God. Why? Assuredly, because
God sees much more distinctly than we; and hence, what appears to us
cleanest, is filthy in his eyes. Here we have a beautiful and singularly
profitable admonition, not to measure the strictness of God’s judgment
by our own opinion; for we are dim-sighted, but God is preeminently
discerning. We think of ourselves too indulgently, but God is a judge of
the utmost strictness. Hence the truth of what Solomon says —

<span id="xi.i-p46"></span>“Every man’s ways appear right his own eyes,
but the Lord pondereth the hearts.” (<span id="xi.i-p46.1"></span>[Pr
21:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#002)<span id="xi.i-p46.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.i-p47"></span>Papists abuse this passage for the purpose of
shaking the assurance of faith, and truly, I confess, that if their
doctrine were admitted, we could do nothing but tremble in wretchedness
during our whole life. For what tranquillity could our minds enjoy if it
were to be determined from our works whether we are well-pleasing to
God? I confess, therefore, that from the main foundation of Papists
there follows nothing but continual disquietude for consciences; and,
accordingly, we teach that we must have recourse to the free promise of
mercy, which is offered to us in Christ, that we may be fully assured
that we are accounted righteous by God.

<span id="xi.i-p48"></span><span id="xi.i-p48.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p49"></span>**5.** *Therefore judge nothing before the
time* From this conclusion it is manifest, that Paul did not mean to
reprove every kind of judgment without exception, but only what is hasty
and rash, without examination of the case. For the Corinthians did not
mark with unjaundiced eye the character of each individual, but, blinded
by ambition, groundlessly extolled one and depreciated another, and took
upon themselves to mark out the dignity of each individual beyond what
is lawful for men. Let us know, then, how much is allowed us, what is
now within the sphere of our knowledge, and what is deferred until the
day of Christ, and let us not attempt to go beyond these limits. For
there are some things that are now seen openly, while there are others
that lie buried in obscurity until the day of Christ.

<span id="xi.i-p50"></span>*Who will bring to light.* If this is
affirmed truly and properly respecting the day of Christ, it follows
that matters are never so well regulated in this world but that many
things are involved in darkness, and that there is never so much light,
but that many things remain in obscurity. I speak of the life of men,
and their actions. He explains in the second clause, what is the cause
of the obscurity and confusion, so that all things are not now manifest.
It is because there are wonderful recesses and deepest lurking-places in
the hearts of men. Hence, until the thoughts of the hearts are brought
to light, there will always be darkness.

<span id="xi.i-p51"></span>*And then shall every one have praise* It is
as though he had said, “You now, O Corinthians, as if you had the
adjudging of the prizes,  <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) crown
some, and send away others with disgrace, but this right and office
belong exclusively to Christ. You do that *before the time* — before it
has become manifest who is worthy to be crowned, but the Lord has
appointed a day on which he will make it manifest.” This statement takes
its rise from the assurance of a good conscience, which brings us also
this advantage, that committing our *praises* into the hands of God, we
disregard the empty breath of human applause.

<span id="xi.ii"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xi.ii-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#006.md)<span id="xi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p2"></span>**6.** And these things, brethren, I have in
a figure transferred to myself and *to* Apollos for your sakes; that ye
might learn in us not to think *of men* above that which is written,
that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.

<span id="xi.ii-p3"></span>**6.** Haec autem, fratres, transfiguravi in
me ipsum et Apollo propter vos, ut in nobis disceretis, quis supra id
quod scriptum est, de se sentiat: ut ne quis pro hoc vel illo infletur
adversus alterum.

<span id="xi.ii-p4"></span>**7.** For who maketh thee to differ *from
another*? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou
didst receive *it*, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received
it?

<span id="xi.ii-p5"></span>**7.** Quis enim to discernit? quid autem
habes, quod non acceperis? si vero etiam acceperis, quid gloriaris
tanquam non acceperis?

<span id="xi.ii-p6"></span>**8.** Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye
have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that
we also might reign with you.

<span id="xi.ii-p7"></span>**8.** Jam saturati estis, jam ditati estis,
absque nobis regnum adepti estis; atque utinam sitis adepti ut et nos
vobiscum regnemus.

<span id="xi.ii-p8"></span> 

<span id="xi.ii-p9"></span><span id="xi.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p10"></span>**6.** *I have in a figure transferred.*
Hence we may infer, that it was not those who were attached to Paul that
gave rise to parties, as *they*, assuredly, had not. been so instructed,
but those who had through ambition given themselves up to vain teachers.
 <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) But as he could more freely and
less invidiously bring forward his own name, and that of his brethren,
he preferred to point out in his own person the fault that existed in
others. At the same time, he strikes a severe blow at the originators of
the parties, and points his finger to the sources from which this deadly
divorce took its rise. For he shows them, that if they had been
satisfied with good teachers, they would have been exempted from this
evil.  <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md)

<span id="xi.ii-p13"></span>*That is us.* Some manuscripts have it “that
in *you*.” Both readings suit well, and their is no difference of
meaning; for what Paul intends is this — “I have, for the sake of
example, transferred these things to myself and Apollos, in order that
you may transfer this example to yourselves.” “*Learn* then *in us*,”
that is, “in that example which I have placed before you in our person
as in a mirror;” or, “*Learn in you*,” that is, “apply this example to
yourselves.” But what does he wish them to *learn*? *That no one be
puffed up for his own teacher against another*, that is, that they be
not lifted up with pride on account of their teachers, and do not abuse
their names for the purpose of forming parties, and rending the Church
asunder. Observe, too, that pride or haughtiness is the cause and
commencement of all contentions, when every one, assuming to himself
more than he is entitled to do, is eager to have others in subjection to
him.

<span id="xi.ii-p14"></span>The clause *above what is written* may be
explained in two ways — either as referring to Paul’s writings, or to
the proofs from Scripture which he has brought forward. As this,
however, is a matter of small moment, my readers may be left at liberty
to take whichever they may prefer.

<span id="xi.ii-p15"></span><span id="xi.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p16"></span>**7.** *For who distinguisheth thee?* The
meaning is — “Let that man come forward, whosoever he be, that is
desirous of distinction, and troubles the Church by his ambition. I will
demand of him who it is that makes him superior to others? That is, who
it is that has conferred upon him the privilege of being taken out of
the rank of the others, and made superior to others?” Now this whole
reasoning depends on the order which the Lord has appointed in his
Church — that the members of Christ’s body may be united together, and
that every one of them may rest satisfied with his own place, his own
rank, his own office, and his own honor. If one member is desirous to
quit his place, that he may leap over into the place of another, and
invade his office, what will become of the entire body? Let us know,
then, that the Lord has so placed us in the Church, and has in such a
manner assigned to every one his own station, that, being under one
head, we may be mutually helpful to each other. Let us know, besides,
that we have been endowed with a diversity of gifts, in order that we
may serve the Lord with modesty and humility, and may endeavor to
promote the glory of him who has conferred upon us everything that we
have. This, then, was the best remedy for correcting the ambition of
those who were desirous of distinction — to call them back to God, in
order that they might acknowledge that it was not according to any one’s
pleasure that he was placed in a high or a low station, but that this
belonged to God alone; and farther, that God does not confer so much
upon any one as to elevate him to the place of the Head, but distributes
his gifts in such a manner, that He alone is glorified in all things.

<span id="xi.ii-p17"></span>*To distinguish* here means to render
eminent.  <span id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) Augustine, however,
does not ineptly make frequent use of this declaration for maintaining,
in opposition to the Pelagians,  <span id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md)
that whatever there is of excellence in mankind, is not implanted in him
by nature, so that it could be ascribed either to nature or to descent;
and farther, that it is not acquired by free will, so as to bring God
under obligation, but flows from his pure and undeserved mercy. For
there can be no doubt that Paul here contrasts the grace of God with the
merit or worthiness of men.  <span id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md)

<span id="xi.ii-p21"></span>*And what hast thou*? This is a confirmation
of the preceding statement, for that man cannot on good ground extol
himself, who has no superiority above others. For what greater vanity is
there than that of boasting without any ground for it? Now, there is no
man that has anything of excellency from himself; therefore the man that
extols himself is a fool and an idiot. The true foundation of Christian
modesty is this — not to be self-complacent, as knowing that we are
empty and void of everything good — that, if God has implanted in us
anything that is good, we are so much the more debtors to his grace; and
in fine, that, as Cyprian says, we must glory in nothing, because there
is nothing that is our own.

<span id="xi.ii-p22"></span>*Why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not
received it*? Observe, that there remains no ground for our glorying,
inasmuch as it is by

<span id="xi.ii-p23"></span>the grace of God that we are what we are,  
(<span id="xi.ii-p23.2"></span>[1Co
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010)<span id="xi.ii-p23.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.ii-p24"></span>And this is what we had in the first
chapter, that Christ is the source of all blessings to us, that we may

and this we do, only when we renounce our own glory. For God does not
obtain his due otherwise than by our being emptied, so that it may be
seen that everything in us that is worthy of praise is derived.

<span id="xi.ii-p26"></span>**8.** *Now ye are full* Having in good
earnest, and without the use of any figure, beat down their vain
confidence, he now also ridicules it by way of irony,  <span
id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) because they are so self-complacent,
as if they were the happiest persons in the world. He proceeds, too,
step by step, in exposing their insolence. In the first place, he says,
that they were *full*: this refers to the past. He then adds, *Ye are
rich*: this applies to the future. *Lastly*, he says, that they had
*reigned as kings* this is much more than either of those two. It is as
though he had said, “*What* will you attain to, when you appear to be
not merely *full* for the present, but are also *rich* for the future —
nay more, are *kings*?*”* At the same time, he tacitly upbraids them
with ingratitude, because they had the audacity to despise *him*, or
rather *those*, through means of whom they had obtained everything.

<span id="xi.ii-p28"></span>*Without us,* says he. “For Apollos and I
are now esteemed nothing by you, though it is by our instrumentality
that the Lord has conferred everything upon you. What inhumanity there
is in resting with self-complacency in the gifts of God, while in the
meantime you despise those through whose instrumentality you obtained
them!”

<span id="xi.ii-p29"></span>*And I would to God that ye did reign*
 <span id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) Here he declares that he does
not envy their felicity, (if indeed they have any,) and that from the
beginning he has not sought to *reign* among them, but only to bring
them to the kingdom of God. He intimates, however, on the other hand,
that the kingdom in which they gloried was merely imaginary, and that
their glorying was groundless and pernicious,  <span
id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) there being no true glorying but that
which is enjoyed by all the sons of God in common, under Christ their
Head, and every one of them according to the measure of the grace that
has been given him.

<span id="xi.ii-p32"></span>For by these words *that ye also may reign
with us,* he means this — “You are so renowned in your own opinion that
you do not hesitate to despise me, and those like me, but mark, how vain
is your glorying. For you can have no glorying before God, in which we
have not a share — for if honor redounds to you from having the gospel
of God, how much more to us, by whose ministry it was conveyed to you!
And assuredly, this is a madness  <span
id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) that is common to all the proud, that
by drawing everything to themselves, they strip themselves of every
blessing — nay more, they renounce the hope of everlasting salvation.”

<span id="xi.iii-p17"></span><span id="xi.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p18"></span>**9.** *For I think*, etc. It is uncertain
whether he speaks of himself exclusively, or takes in at the same time
Apollos and Silvanus, for he sometimes calls such persons apostles. I
prefer, however, to understand it of himself exclusively. Should any one
be inclined to extend it farther, I shall have no particular objection,
provided only he does not understand it as Chrysostom does, to mean that
the apostles were as if for the sake of ignominy reserved to the last
place.  <span id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) For there can be no
doubt that by the term *last*, he means those who were admitted to the
rank of apostles subsequently to the resurrection of Christ. Now, he
admits that he is like those who are exhibited to the people when on the
eve of being led forth to death. For such is the meaning of the word
*exhibited* — *as* those who on occasion of a triumph were led round
 <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md) for the sake of show, and were
afterwards hurried away to prison to be strangled.

<span id="xi.iii-p21"></span>This he expresses more distinctly by
adding, that they *were made a spectacle*. “This,” says he, “is my
condition, that I exhibit to the world a spectacle of my miseries, like
those who having been condemned to fight with wild beasts,  <span
id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md) or to the games of the gladiators, or
to some other mode of punishment, are brought forth to the view of the
people, and that not before a few spectators, but before the whole
*world*.” Observe here the admirable steadfastness of Paul, who, while
he saw himself to be dealt with by God in this manner, was nevertheless
not broken or dispirited. For he does not impute it to the wantonness of
the wicked, that he was, as it were, led forth with ignominy to the
sport of the arena, but ascribes it wholly to the providence of God.

<span id="xi.iii-p23"></span>The second clause *to angels and to men*, I
take to be expository in this sense — “I am made a sport and spectacle,
not merely to earth, but also to heaven.” This passage has been commonly
explained as referring to devils, from its seeming to be absurd to refer
it to good angels. Paul, however, does not mean, that all who are
witnesses of this calamity are gratified with such a *spectacle* He
simply means, that the Lord has so ordered his lot that he seems as
though he had been appointed to furnish sport to the whole world.

<span id="xi.iii-p24"></span><span id="xi.iii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p25"></span>**10.** *We are fools for Christ’s sake*
This contrast is throughout ironical, and exceedingly pointed, it being
unseemly and absurd that the Corinthians should be in every respect
happy and honorable, according to the flesh, while in the meantime they
beheld their master and father afflicted with the lowest ignominy, and
with miseries of every kind. For those who are of opinion that Paul
abases himself in this manner, in order that he may in earnestness
ascribe to the Corinthians those things which he acknowledges himself to
be in want of, may without any difficulty be refuted from the little
clause that he afterwards subjoins. In speaking, therefore, of the
Corinthians as *wise in Christ*, and *strong*, and *honorable*, he makes
a concession ironically, as though he had said  <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) — “You desire, along with the gospel,
to retain commendation for *wisdom*,  <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) whereas I have not been able to preach
Christ otherwise than by becoming *a fool* in this world. Now when I
have willingly, on your account, submitted to be *a fool*, or to be
reckoned such, consider whether it be reasonable that you should wish to
be esteemed *wise.* How in these things consort — that I who have been
your master, am *a fool for Christ’s sake*, and you, on the other hand,
remain *wise*!” In this way, *being wise in Christ* is not taken here in
a good sense, for he derides the Corinthians for wishing to mix up
together Christ and the wisdom of the flesh, inasmuch as this were to
endeavor to unite things directly contrary.

<span id="xi.iii-p28"></span>The case is the same as to the subsequent
clauses — “You are *strong* says he, and *honorable*, that is, you glory
in the riches and resources of the world, you cannot endure the ignominy
of the cross. In the meantime, is it reasonable that I should be on your
account  <span id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) mean and contemptible,
and exposed to many infirmities? Now the complaint carries with it so
much the more reproach  <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) on this
account, that even among themselves he was *weak and contemptible*.
(<span id="xi.iii-p30.2"></span>[2Co
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#010)<span id="xi.iii-p30.2"></span>..md)
In fine, he derides their vanity in this respect, that, reversing the
order of things, those who were sons and followers were desirous to be
esteemed *honorable* and noble, while their father was in obscurity, and
was exposed also to all the reproaches of the world.

<span id="xi.iii-p31"></span><span id="xi.iii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p32"></span>**11.** *For to this hour.* The Apostle
here describes his condition, as if in a picture, that the Corinthians
may learn, from his example, to lay aside that loftiness of spirit, and
embrace, as he did, the cross of Christ with meekness of spirit. He
discovers the utmost dexterity in this respect, that in making mention
of those things which had rendered him contemptible, he affords clear
proof of his singular fidelity and indefatigable zeal for the
advancement of the gospel; and, on the other hand, he tacitly reproves
his rivals, who, while they had furnished no such proof, were desirous,
nevertheless, to be held in the highest esteem. In the words themselves
there is no obscurity, except that we must take notice of the
distinction between those two participles — <span
id="xi.iii-p32.1"></span>λοιδορουμενοι και βλασφημουμενοι (*reviled* and
*defamed*.) As <span id="xi.iii-p32.2"></span>λοιδορια means — that
harsher sort of raillery, which does not merely give a person a slight
touch, but a sharp bite, and blackens his character by open contumely,
there can be no doubt that <span id="xi.iii-p32.3"></span>λοιδορειν
means — wounding a person with reproach as with a sting.  <span
id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) I have accordingly rendered it —
*harassed with revilings* <span id="xi.iii-p33.5"></span>Βλασφημια
signifies a more open reproach, when any one is severely and atrociously
slandered.  <span id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p35"></span><span id="xi.iii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p36"></span>**12.** When he says that *while persecuted
he suffers it,* and that he *prays* for his *revilers*, he intimates
that he is not merely afflicted and abased by God, by means of the
cross, but is also endowed with a disposition to abase himself
willingly. In this, perhaps, he gives a stroke to the false apostles,
who were so effeminate and tender, that they could not bear to be
touched even with your little finger. In speaking of their *laboring* he
adds — *with our own hands*, to express more fully the meanness of his
employments  <span id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) — “I do not merely
gain a livelihood for myself by my own labor, but by mean labor,
*working with my own hands*.”

<span id="xi.iii-p38"></span><span id="xi.iii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p39"></span>**13.** *As the execrations of the world.*
He makes use of two terms, the former of which denotes a man who, by
public *execrations*, is devoted, with the view to the cleansing of a
city,  <span id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) for such persons, on the
ground of their cleansing the rest of the people, by receiving in
themselves whatever there is in the city of crimes, and heinous offense,
are called by the Greeks sometimes <span
id="xi.iii-p40.2"></span>καθαρμοι, but more frequently <span
id="xi.iii-p40.3"></span>καθάρματα.  <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) Paul, in adding the preposition <span
id="xi.iii-p41.3"></span>περὶ (around) seems to have had an eye to the
expiatory rite itself, inasmuch as those unhappy men who were devoted to
execrations were *led round* through the streets, that they might carry
away with them whatever there was of evil  <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) in any corner, that the cleansing
might be the more complete. The plural number might seem to imply that
he speaks not of himself exclusively, but also of the others who were
his associates, and who were not less held in contempt by the
Corinthians. There is, however, no urgent reason for regarding what he
says as extending to more than himself. The other term — <span
id="xi.iii-p42.3"></span>περίψημα, (offscouring,) denotes filings or
scrapings of any kind, and also the sweepings that are cleared away with
a brush.  <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) As to both terms
consult the annotations of Budaeus.  <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p45"></span>In so far as concerns the meaning of the
passage before us, Paul, with the view of expressing his extreme
degradation, says that he is held in abomination by the whole world,
like a man set apart for expiation,  <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) and that, like offscourings, he is
nauseous to all. At the same time he does not mean to say by the former
comparison that he is all expiatory victim for sins, but simply means,
that in respect of disgrace and reproaches he differs nothing from the
man on whom the execrations of all are heaped up.

<span id="xi.iii-p47"></span><span id="xi.iii-p47.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p48"></span>**14.** *I write not these things to shame
you* As the foregoing instances of irony were very pointed, so that they
might exasperate the minds of the Corinthians, he now obviates that
dissatisfaction by declaring, that he had not said these things with a
view to cover them with shame, but rather to admonish them with paternal
affection. It is indeed certain that this is the nature and tendency of
a father’s chastisement, to make his son feel ashamed; for the first
token of return to a right state of mind is the shame which the son
begins to feel on being reproached for his fault. The object, then,
which the father has in view when he chastises his son with reproofs, is
that he may bring him to be displeased with himself. And we see that the
tendency of what Paul has said hitherto, is to make the Corinthians
ashamed of themselves. Nay more, we shall find him a little afterwards
(<span id="xi.iii-p48.2"></span>[1Co
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#005)<span id="xi.iii-p48.2"></span>.md)
declaring that he made mention of their faults in order that they may
begin to be ashamed. Here, however, he simply means to intimate, that it
was not his design to heap disgrace upon them, or to expose their sins
publicly and openly with a view to their reproach. For he who admonishes
in a friendly spirit, makes it his particular care that whatever there
is of shame, may remain with the individual whom he admonishes,  <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) and may in this manner be buried. On
the other hand, the man who reproaches with a malignant disposition,
inflicts disgrace upon the man whom he reproves for his fault, in such a
manner as to hold him up to the reproach of all. Paul then simply
affirms that what he had said, had been said by him, with no disposition
to upbraid, or with any view to hurt their reputation, but, on the
contrary, with paternal affection he admonished them as to what he saw
to be defective in them.

<span id="xi.iii-p50"></span>But what was the design of this admonition?
It was that the Corinthians, who were puffed up with mere empty notions,
might learn to glory, as he did, in the abasement of the cross, and
might no longer despise him on those grounds on which he was deservedly
honorable in the sight of God and angels — in fine, that, laying aside
their accustomed haughtiness, they might set a higher value on those
*marks*  <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) *of Christ* (<span
id="xi.iii-p51.5"></span>[Ga 6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017.md)<span
id="xi.iii-p51.5"></span>) that were upon him, than on the empty and
counterfeit show of the false apostles. Let teachers  <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) infer from this, that in reproofs they
must always use such moderation as not to wound men’s minds with
excessive severity, and that, agreeably to the common proverb, they must
mix honey or oil with vinegar — that they must above all things take
care not to appear to triumph over those whom they reprove, or to take
delight in their disgrace — nay more, that they must endeavor to make it
understood that they seek nothing but that their welfare may be
promoted. For what good will the teacher  <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) do by mere bawling, if he does not
season the sharpness of his reproof by that moderation of which I have
spoken? Hence if we are desirous to do any good by *correcting* men’s
faults, we must distinctly give them to know, that our reproofs proceed
from a friendly disposition.

<span id="xi.iii-p54"></span><span id="xi.iii-p54.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p55"></span>**15.** *For though you had ten thousand.*
He had called himself *father*, and now he shows that this title belongs
to him peculiarly and specially, inasmuch as he alone has *begotten them
in Christ.* In this comparison, however, he has an eye to the false
apostles to whom the Corinthians showed all deference, so that Paul was
now almost as nothing among them. Accordingly he admonishes them to
consider what honor ought to be rendered to a *father*, and what to a
*pedagogue*  <span id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) “You entertain
respect for those new teachers. To this I have no objection, provided
you bear in mind that I am your *father*, while they are merely
*pedagogues*.” Now by claiming for himself authority, he intimates that
he is actuated by a different kind of affection from that of those whom
they so highly esteemed. “They take pains in instructing you. Be it so.
Very different is the love of a *father*, very different his anxiety,
very different his attachment from those of a *pedagogue* What if he
should also make an allusion to that imperfection of faith  <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) which he had previously found fault
with? For while the Corinthians were giants in pride, they were children
in faith, and are, therefore, with propriety, sent to *pedagogues*
 <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) He also reproves the absurd and
base system of those teachers in keeping their followers in the mere
first rudiments, with the view of keeping them always in bonds under
their authority.  <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p60"></span>*For in Christ* Here we have the reason why
he alone ought to be esteemed as the *father* of the Corinthian Church —
because he had *begotten* it. And truly it is in most appropriate terms
that he here describes spiritual generation, when he says that he has
*begotten them in Christ*, who alone is the life of the soul, and makes
the gospel the formal cause.  <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md)
Let us observe, then, that we are *then* in the sight of God truly
*begotten*, when we are engrafted into Christ, out of whom there will be
found nothing but death, and that this is effected by means of *the
gospel*, because, while we are by nature flesh and hay, the word of God,
as Peter (<span id="xi.iii-p61.2"></span>[1 Pet.
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024.md),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025)<span id="xi.iii-p61.2"></span>.md)
teaches from Isaiah, (<span id="xi.iii-p61.3"></span>[Isa.
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#008)<span id="xi.iii-p61.3"></span>,.md) is
*the incorruptible seed* by which we are renewed to eternal life. Take
away the gospel, and we will all remain accursed and dead in the sight
of God. That same word by which we are *begotten* is afterwards *milk*
to us for nourishing us, and it is also *solid food* to sustain us for
ever.  <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p63"></span>Should any one bring forward this
objection, “As new sons are *begotten* to God in the Church every day,
why does Paul say that those who succeeded him were not *fathers*?” the
answer is easy — that he is here speaking of the *commencement* of the
Church. For although many had been *begotten* by the ministry of others,
this honor remained to Paul untouched — that he had founded the
Corinthian Church. Should any one, again, ask, “Ought not all pastors to
be reckoned *fathers*, and if so, why does Paul deprive all others of
this title, so as to claim it for himself exclusively?” I answer — “He
speaks here comparatively.” Hence, however the title of *fathers* might
be applicable to them in other respects, yet in respect of Paul, they
were merely *instructors* We must also keep in mind what I touched upon
a little ago, that he is not speaking of all, (for as to those who were
like himself, as, for example, Apollos, Silvanus, and Timotheus, who
aimed at nothing but the advancement of Christ’s kingdom, he would have
had no objection to their being so named, and having the highest honor
assigned to them,) but is reproving those who, by a misdirected
ambition, transferred to themselves the glory that belonged to another.
Of this sort were those who robbed Paul of the honor that was due to
him, that they might set themselves off in his spoils.

<span id="xi.iii-p64"></span>And, truly, the condition of the Church
universal at this day is the same as that of the Corinthian Church was
at that time. For how few are there that love the Churches with a
*fatherly*, that is to say, a disinterested affection, and lay
themselves out to promote their welfare! Meanwhile, there are very many
*pedagogues*, who give out their services as hirelings, in such a manner
as to discharge as it were a mere temporary office, and in the meantime
hold the people in subjection and admiration.  <span
id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) At the same time, even in that case it
is well when there are many *pedagogues*, who do good, at least, to some
extent by teaching, and do not destroy the Church by the corruptions of
false doctrine. For my part, when I complain of the multitude of
pedagogues, I do not refer to Popish priests, (for I would not do them
the honor of reckoning them in that number,) but those who, while
agreeing with us in doctrine, employ themselves in taking care of their
own affairs, rather than those of Christ. We all, it is true, wish to be
reckoned *fathers*, and require from others the obedience of sons, but
where is the man to be found who acts in such a manner as to show that
he is a *father*?  <span id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p67"></span>There remains another question of greater
difficulty: As Christ forbids us to

<span id="xi.iii-p68"></span>call any one father upon earth, because we
have one Father in heaven,  
(<span id="xi.iii-p68.2"></span>[Mt
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#009)<span id="xi.iii-p68.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p69"></span>how does Paul dare to take to himself the
name of *father*? I answer, that, properly speaking, God alone is the
Father, not merely of our soul, but also of our flesh. As, however, in
so far as concerns the body, he communicates the honor of his paternal
name to those to whom he gives offspring, while, as to souls, he
reserves to himself exclusively the right and title of Father, I confess
that, on this account, he is called in a peculiar sense *the Father of
spirits*, and is distinguished from earthly *fathers*, as the Apostle
speaks in <span id="xi.iii-p69.1"></span>[Heb
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#009.md)<span id="xi.iii-p69.1"></span>.
As, however, notwithstanding that it is he alone who, by his own
influence, begets souls, and regenerates and quickens them, he makes use
of the ministry of his servants for this purpose, there is no harm in
their being called *fathers*, in respect of this ministry, as this does
not in any degree detract from the honor of God. The word, as I have
said, is the spiritual seed. God alone by means of it regenerates our
souls by his influence, but, at the same time, he does not exclude the
efforts of ministers. If, therefore, you attentively consider, what God
accomplishes by himself, and what he designs to be accomplished by
ministers, you will easily understand in what sense he alone is worthy
of the name of *Father*, and how far this name is applicable to his
ministers, without any infringement upon his rights.

<span id="xi.iv-p1"></span><span id="xi.iv-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
4:16-21](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#016.md)<span id="xi.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p2"></span>**16.** Wherefore I beseech you, be ye
followers of me.

<span id="xi.iv-p3"></span>**16.** Adhortor ergo vos, imitatores mei
estote.

<span id="xi.iv-p4"></span>**17.** For this cause have I sent unto you
Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall
bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach
every where in every church.

<span id="xi.iv-p5"></span>**17.** Hac de causa misi ad vos Timotheum,
qui est filius meus dilectus et fidelis in Domino: qui vobis in memoriam
reducat vias meas, quae sunt in Christo, quemadmodum ubique in omnibus
Ecclesiis doceam.

<span id="xi.iv-p6"></span>**18.** Now some are puffed up, as though I
would not come to you.

<span id="xi.iv-p7"></span>**18.** Perinde quasi non sum ad vos
venturus, inflati sunt quidam:

<span id="xi.iv-p8"></span>**19.** But I will come to you shortly, if
the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed
up, but the power.

<span id="xi.iv-p9"></span>**19.** Veniam autem brevi ad vos, si Dominus
voluerit, et cognoscam non sermonem eorum qui sunt inflati, sed
virtutem.

<span id="xi.iv-p10"></span>**20.** For the kingdom of God *is* not in
word, but in power.

<span id="xi.iv-p11"></span>**20.** Neque enim in sermone regnum Dei
est, sed in virtute.

<span id="xi.iv-p12"></span>**21.** What will ye? shall I come unto you
with a rod, or in love, and *in* the spirit of meekness?

<span id="xi.iv-p13"></span>**21.** Quid vultis? in virga veniam ad vos,
an in dilectione spirituque mansuetudinis?

<span id="xi.iv-p14"></span> 

<span id="xi.iv-p15"></span><span id="xi.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p16"></span>**16.** *I exhort you.* He now expresses
also, in his own words, what he requires from them in his fatherly
admonition — that, being his sons, they do not degenerate from their
father. For what is more reasonable than that sons endeavor to be as
like as possible to their father.  <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) At the same time he gives up something
in respect of his own right, when he *exhorts* them to this, by way of
entreaty rather than of command. But to what extent he wishes them to be
*imitators of him*, he shows elsewhere, when he adds, *as he was of
Christ* (<span id="xi.iv-p17.2"></span>[1Co
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001)<span id="xi.iv-p17.2"></span>..md)
This limitation must always be observed, so as not to follow any man,
except in so far as he leads us to Christ. We know what he is here
treating of. The Corinthians did not merely shun the abasement of the
cross, but they also regarded their *father* with contempt, on this
account, that, forgetting earthly glory, he gloried rather in reproaches
for Christ; and they reckoned themselves and others fortunate in having
nothing contemptible according to the flesh. He accordingly admonishes
them to devote themselves, after his example, to the service of Christ,
so as to endure all things patiently.

<span id="xi.iv-p18"></span><span id="xi.iv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p19"></span>**17.** *For this cause.* The meaning is:
“That you may know what my manner of life is, and whether I am worthy to
be imitated, listen to what Timothy has to say, who will be prepared to
be a faithful witness of these things. Now as there are two things that
secure credit to a man’s testimony — a knowledge of the things which he
relates, and fidelity — he lets them know that Timothy possesses both of
these things. For in calling him his *dearly beloved son*, he intimates
that he knew him intimately, and was acquainted with all his affairs;
and farther, he speaks of him as *faithful in the Lord* He gives also
two things in charge to Timothy — *first*, to recall to the recollection
of the Corinthians those things which they should of themselves have had
in remembrance, and in this he tacitly reproves them; and *secondly*, to
testify to them, how uniform and steady his manner of teaching was in
every place. Now it is probable that he had been assailed by the
calumnies of the false apostles, as though he assumed more authority
over the Corinthians than he did over others, or as though he conducted
himself in a very different way in other places; for it is not without
good reason that he wishes this to be testified to them. It is then the
part of a prudent minister so to regulate his procedure, and to observe
such a method of instruction, that no such objection may be brought
against him, but he shall be prepared to answer on the same ground as
Paul does.

<span id="xi.iv-p20"></span><span id="xi.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p21"></span>**18.** *As though I would not come to you*
This is the custom of the false apostles — to take advantage of the
absence of the good, that they may triumph and vaunt without any
hindrance. Paul, accordingly, with the view of reproving their
ill-regulated conscience, and repressing their insolence, tells them,
that they cannot endure his presence. It happens sometimes, it is true,
that wicked men, on finding opportunity of insulting, rise up openly
with an iron front against the servants of Christ, but never do they
come forward ingenuously to an equal combat,  <span
id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) but on the contrary, by sinister
artifices they discover their want of confidence.

<span id="xi.iv-p23"></span><span id="xi.iv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p24"></span>**19.** *But I will come shortly.* “They are
in a mistake,” says he, “in raising their crests during my absence, as
though this were to be of long duration, for they shall in a short time
perceive how vain their confidence has been.” He has it not, however, so
much in view to terrify them, as though he would on his arrival thunder
forth against them, but rather presses and bears down upon their
consciences, for, however they might disguise it, they were aware that
he was furnished with divine influence.

<span id="xi.iv-p25"></span>The clause, *if the Lord will*, intimates,
that we ought not to promise anything to others as to the future, or to
determine with ourselves, without adding this limitation in so far as
*the Lord will permit* Hence James with good reason derides the rashness
of mankind (<span id="xi.iv-p25.1"></span>[Jas
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#015)<span id="xi.iv-p25.1"></span>.md) in
planning what they are to do ten years afterwards, while they have not
security for living even a single hour. We are not, it is true, bound by
a constant necessity to the use of such forms of expression, but it is
the better way to accustom ourselves carefully to them, that we may
exercise our minds from time to time in this consideration — that all
our plans must be in subjection to the will of God.

<span id="xi.iv-p26"></span>*And I will know not the speech* By *speech*
you must understand that prating in which the false apostles delighted
themselves, for they excelled in a kind of dexterity and gracefulness of
speech, while they were destitute of the zeal and efficacy of the
Spirit. By the term *power*, he means that spiritual efficacy, with
which those are endowed who dispense the word of the Lord with
earnestness.  <span id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md) The meaning,
therefore, is: “I shall see whether they have so much occasion for being
puffed up; and I shall not judge of them by their mere outward
talkativeness, in which they place the sum-total  <span
id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) of their glory, and on the ground of
which they claim for themselves every honor. If they wish to have any
honor from me, they must bring forward that *power* which distinguishes
the true servants of Christ from the merely pretended: otherwise I shall
despise them, with all their show. It is to no purpose, therefore, that
they confide in their eloquence, for I shall reckon it nothing better
than smoke.”

<span id="xi.iv-p29"></span><span id="xi.iv-p29.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p30"></span>**20.** *For the kingdom of God is not in
word* As the Lord governs the Church by his word, as with a scepter, the
administration of the gospel is often called *the kingdom of God* Here,
then, we are to understand *by the kingdom of God* whatever tends in
this direction, and is appointed for this purpose — that God may reign
among us. He says that this kingdom does not consist in *word*, for how
small an affair is it for any one to have skill to prate eloquently,
while he has nothing but empty tinkling.  <span
id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) Let us know, then, a mere outward
gracefulness and dexterity in teaching is like a body that is elegant
and of a beautiful color, while the *power* of which Paul here speaks is
like the soul. *We* have already seen that the preaching of the gospel
is of such a nature, that it is inwardly replete with a kind of solid
majesty. This majesty shows itself, when a minister strives by means of
*power* rather than of *speech* — that is, when he does not place
confidence in his own intellect, or eloquence, but, furnished with
spiritual armor, consisting of zeal for maintaining the Lord’s honor —
eagerness for the raising up of Christ’s kingdom — a desire to edify —
the fear of the Lord — an invincible constancy — purity of conscience,
and other necessary endowments, he applies himself diligently to the
Lord’s work. Without this, preaching is dead, and has no strength, with
whatever beauty it may be adorned. Hence in his second epistle, he says,
that in Christ nothing avails but *a new creature* (<span
id="xi.iv-p31.2"></span>[2Co 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md)<span
id="xi.iv-p31.2"></span>) — a statement which is to the same purpose.
For he would have us not rest in outward masks, but depend solely on the
internal *power* of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="xi.iv-p32"></span>But while in these words he represses the
ambition of the false apostles, he at the same time reproves the
Corinthians for their perverted judgment, in measuring the servants of
Christ by what holds the lowest place among their excellences. Here we
have a remarkable statement, and one that is not less applicable to us
than to them. As to our gospel, of which we are proud,  <span
id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) where is it in most persons except in
the tongue? Where is newness of life? Where is spiritual efficacy? Nor
is it so among the people merely.  <span
id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) On the contrary, how many there are,
who, while endeavoring to procure favor and applause from the gospel, as
though it were some profane science, aim at nothing else than to speak
with elegance and refinement! I do not approve of restricting the term
*power* to miracles, for from the contrast we may readily gather that it
has a more extensive import.

<span id="xi.iv-p35"></span><span id="xi.iv-p35.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p36"></span>**21.** *What will ye*? The person who
divided the Epistles into chapters ought to have made this the beginning
of the *fifth* chapter. For having hitherto reproved the foolish pride
of the Corinthians, their vain confidence, and their judgment as
perverted and corrupted by ambition, he now makes mention of the vices
with which they were infected, and on account of which they ought to be
ashamed — “You are puffed up, as though everything were on the best
possible footing among you, but it were better if you did with shame and
sighing acknowledge the unhappiness of your condition, for if you
persist, I shall be under the necessity of laying aside mildness, and
exercising towards you a paternal severity.” There is, however, still
more of emphasis in this threatening in which he gives them liberty to
choose, for he declares that it does not depend upon himself whether he
shall show himself agreeable and mild, but that it is their own fault
that he is necessitated to use severity. “It is for you,” says he, “to
choose in what temper you would have me. As for me, I am prepared to be
mild, but if you go on as you have done hitherto, I shall be under the
necessity of taking up the rod.” He thus takes higher ground, after
having laid claim to *fatherly* authority over them, for it would have
been absurd to set out with this threatening, without first opening up
the way by what he said, and preparing them for entertaining fears.

<span id="xi.iv-p37"></span>By the term *rod*, he means that severity
with which a pastor ought to correct his people’s faults. He places in
contrast with this, *love, and the spirit of meekness* — not, as though
the father hated the sons whom he chastises, for on the contrary the
chastisement proceeds from love, but because by sadness of countenance
and harshness of words, he appears as though he were angry with his son.
To express myself more plainly — in one word, a father always, whatever
kind of look he may put on, regards his son with affection, but that
affection he manifests when he teaches him pleasantly and lovingly; but
when, on the other hand, being displeased with his faults, he chastises
him in rather sharp terms, or even with the *rod*, he puts on the
appearance of a person in a passion. As then love does not appear when
severity of discipline is exercised, it is not without good reason, that
Paul here conjoins *love* with a *spirit of meekness* There are some
that understand the term *rod* to mean excommunication — but, for my
part, though I grant them that excommunication is a part of that
severity with which Paul threatens the Corinthians, I at the same time
extend it farther, so as to include all reproofs that are of a harsher
kind.

<span id="xi.iv-p38"></span>Observe here what system a good pastor ought
to observe; for he ought of his own accord to be inclined to mildness,
with the view of drawing to Christ, rather than driving. This mildness,
so far as in him lies, he ought to maintain, and never have recourse to
bitterness, unless he be compelled to do so. On the other hand, he must
not *spare the rod*, (<span id="xi.iv-p38.1"></span>[Pr
13:24](../../../bib/kjv/pro013.htm#024)<span id="xi.iv-p38.1"></span>,.md)
when there is need for it, for while those that are teachable and
agreeable should be dealt with mildly, sharpness requires to be used in
dealing with the refractory and contumacious. We see, too, that the Word
of God does not contain mere doctrine, but contains an intermixture of
bitter reproofs, so as to supply pastors with a *rod* For it often
happens, through the obstinacy of the people, that those pastors who are
naturally the mildest  <span id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) are
constrained to put on, as it were, the countenance of another, and act
with rigor and severity.

on detracte apertement de quelqu’vn sans vser de couuerture de paroles;”
— “Now *the first* means not simply to make one’s self merry at
another’s expense, but also to touch his reputation, as if with the view
of blackening it, and wounding it by cutting expressions, as we commonly
say — to give a good humored bite. *The second* means when persons

<span id="xi.iii-p41"></span> The Scholiast on Aristophanes, Plut. 454,
gives the following explanation of the term <span
id="xi.iii-p41.1"></span>κάθαρμα: Καθάρματα ἐλέγοντο ὁι επὶ τὢ καθάρσει
λοιμοῦ τινος ἤτινος ἕτὲρα; νάσου θυόμενοι τοις θεοῖς. Τοῦτο δὲ ἔθος καὶ
παρὰ <span id="xi.iii-p41.2"></span>̔ρωμαίοις ἐπεκράτησε. Those were
called *cleansings* who were sacrificed to the gods for the *cleansing
out* of some famine, or some other calamity. This custom prevailed also
among the Romans. — *Ed*

<span id="xi.iii-p44"></span> The view given by Budaeus of the *former*
term (<span id="xi.iii-p44.1"></span>περικαθάρματα) is stated by Leigh
in his Critica Sacra to be the following: That “the Apostle had allusion
unto the expiations in use among the heathens, in time of any pestilence
or contagious infection; for the removal of such diseases they then
sacrificed certain men unto their gods, which men they termed <span
id="xi.iii-p44.2"></span>καθάρματα. As if the Apostle had said — We are
as despicable and as odious in the sight of the people, as much loaded
with the revilings and cursings of the multitude, as those condemned
persons who were offered up by way of public expiation.” The *latter*
term (<span id="xi.iii-p44.3"></span>περίψημα) Budaeus renders as
follows: “<span id="xi.iii-p44.4"></span>Scobem aut ramentum et quicquid
limando fleter;” — “Filings or scrapings, or whatever is cleared off by
filing.” — *Ed*

<span id="xi.iii-p51"></span> “<span id="xi.iii-p51.1"></span>Les
marques et fietrisseurs de Christ en luy;” — “The marks and brands of
Christ in him.” The allusion, as our Author himself remarks, when
commenting upon <span id="xi.iii-p51.3"></span>[Galatians
6:17](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#017.md)<span id="xi.iii-p51.3"></span>,
is to “the marks with which barbarian slaves, or fugitives, or
malefactors were *branded*.” Hence the expression of Juvenal: <span
id="xi.iii-p51.4"></span>*stigmate* dignum credere — “to reckon one
worthy of being *branded* as a slave.” (Juv. 10. 183.) — *Ed*.

<span id="xi.iii-p56"></span> “The Greek word *pedagogue*,” says
*Calmet*, “now carries with it an idea approaching to contempt. With no
other word to qualify it, it excites the idea of a pedant, who assumes
an air of authority over others, which does not belong to him. But among
the ancients a pedagogue was a person to whom they committed the care of
their children, to lead them, to observe them, and to instruct them in
their first rudiments. Thus the office of a pedagogue nearly answered to
that of a governor or tutor, who constantly attends his pupil, teaches
him, and forms his manners. Paul (<span id="xi.iii-p56.1"></span>[1Co
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015)<span id="xi.iii-p56.1"></span>.md)
says: “For though you have ten thousand instructors (*pedagogues*) in
Christ, yet have ye not many fathers’ — representing himself as their
father in the faith, since he had *begotten them in the gospel*. The
*pedagogue*, indeed, may have some power and interest in his pupil, but
he can never have the natural tenderness of a *father* for him.” — *Ed*.

<span id="xi.iii-p58"></span> Our Author evidently alludes to the
etymology of the original term <span

id="xi.iii-p58.2"></span>παῖς, a *boy*, and <span
id="xi.iii-p58.3"></span>ἄγω, to *lead* Such instructors were generally
slaves, whose business it was to attend upon their youthful charge, to
observe their behavior, and to *lead* them to and from school. (Herod.
