<p><a name="ix.i-p9"></A><b>1.</b><i> And I, when I came</i>  Paul having begun to speak of his own method of teaching, had straightway fallen into a discussion as to the nature of gospel preaching generally. Now again he returns to speak of himself, to show that nothing in him was despised but what belonged to the nature of the 			 gospel itself, and did in a manner adhere to it. He allows therefore that he had not had any of the aids of human eloquence or wisdom to qualify him for producing any effect, but while he acknowledges himself to be destitute of such resources, he hints at the inference to be drawn from this &#8212; that the power of God shone the more illustriously in his ministry, from its standing in no need of such helps. This latter idea, however, he will be found bringing forward shortly afterwards. For the 			 present he simply grants that he has nothing of human wisdom, and in the meantime reserves to himself this much &#8212; that he <i>published the testimony of God</i>  Some interpreters, indeed, explain the <i>testimony of God</i> in a passive sense; but as for myself, 			 I have no doubt that another interpretation is more in <i>accordance </i>with the Apostle&#8217;s design, so that <i>the testimony of God</i> is that which has come forth from God &#8212; the doctrine of the gospel, of which he is the author and witness. He now distinguishes between <i>speech</i> and <i>wisdom</i> (<a name="ix.i-p9.1"></A>&#955;&#8057;&#947;&#959;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8034;&#962; &#963;&#959;&#966;&#8055;&#945;&#962;.) Hence what I noticed before   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">103</FONT></A>
 			  is here confirmed &#8212; that hitherto he has not been speaking of mere empty prattling, but has included the entire training of human learning.</p>

<p><a name="ix.i-p12"></A><b>2.</b> <i>For I did not reckon it desirable.</i> As <a name="ix.i-p12.1"></A>&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957;, in Greek, has often the same meaning as <a name="ix.i-p12.2"></A>&#949;&#954;&#955;&#949;&#947;&#949;&#953;&#957;, that is to choose out anything as precious,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">104</FONT></A>
 			  there is, I think, no person of sound judgment but will allow that the rendering that I have given is a probable one, provided only the construction admits of it. At the same time, if we render it thus &#8212; &#8220;No kind of knowledge did I hold in esteem,&#8221; there will be nothing harsh in this rendering. If you understand something to be supplied, the sentence will run smoothly enough in this way &#8212; &#8220;Nothing did I value myself upon, as worth my knowing, or on the ground of 			 knowledge.&#8221; At the same time I do not altogether reject a different interpretation &#8212; viewing Paul as declaring that he esteemed nothing as knowledge, or as entitled to be called knowledge, except Christ alone. Thus the Greek preposition <a name="ix.i-p13.5"></A>&#945;&#957;&#948;, would, as often happens, require to be supplied. But whether the former interpretation is not disapproved of, or whether this latter pleases better, the substance 			 of the passage amounts to this: &#8220;As to my wanting the ornaments of speech, and wanting, too, the more elegant refinements of discourse, the reason of this was, that I did not aspire at them, nay rather, I despised them, because there was one thing only that my heart was set upon &#8212; that I might preach Christ with simplicity.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.i-p14"></A>In adding the word <i>crucified,</i> he does not mean that he preached nothing respecting Christ except the cross; but that, with all the abasement of the cross, he nevertheless preached Christ. It is as though he had said: &#8220;The ignominy of the cross will not prevent me from looking up to him 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">105</FONT></A>
 			  from whom salvation comes, or <i>make </i>me ashamed to regard all my wisdom as comprehended in him &#8212; in him, I say, whom proud men despise and reject on account of the reproach of the cross.&#8221; Hence the statement must be explained in this way: &#8220;No kind of knowledge was in my view of so much importance as to lead me to desire anything but Christ, <i>crucified though he was</i>.&#8221; This little clause is added by way of enlargement (<a name="ix.i-p15.2"></A>&#945;&#8020;&#958;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#957;,) with the view of galling so much the more those arrogant masters, by whom Christ was next to despised, as they were eager to gain applause by being renowned for a higher kind of wisdom. Here we 			 have a beautiful passage, from which we learn what it is that faithful ministers ought to teach, what it is that we must, during our whole life, be learning, and in comparison with which everything else must be &#8220;counted as dung.&#8221; (<a name="ix.i-p15.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#008">Php 3:8</a><a name="ix.i-p15.3"></A>.)</p>  <a name="ix.ii"></A>

<p><a name="ix.ii-p11"></A><b>3.</b> <i>And I was with you in weakness</i>  He explains at greater length what he had previously touched upon &#8212; that he had nothing shining or excellent in him in the eyes of men, to raise him to distinction. He concedes, however, to his adversaries what they desired in 			 such a way as to make those very things which, in their opinion, tended to detract from the credit of his ministry, redound to its highest commendation. If he appeared less worthy of esteem from his being so mean and abject according to the flesh, he shows that the power of God shone out the more conspicuously in this, that he could effect so much, while sustained by no human helps. He has in his eye not merely those foolish boasters   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">107</FONT></A>
 			  who aimed at mere show, with the view of obtaining for themselves a name, but the Corinthians, too, who gazed with astonishment on their empty shows. Accordingly a recital of this kind was fitted to have great weight with them. They were aware that Paul had brought nothing with him in respect of the flesh that was fitted to help him forward, or that might enable him to insinuate himself into the favor of men, and yet they had seen the amazing success which the Lord 			 had vouchsafed to his preaching. Nay more, they had in a manner beheld with their own eyes the Spirit of God present in his doctrine. When, therefore, despising his simplicity, they were tickled with a desire for a kind of wisdom, I know not of what sort, more puffed up and more polished, and were captivated with outward appearance, nay, even with adventitious ornament, rather than with the living efficacy of the Spirit, did they not sufficiently discover their ambitious spirit? It is with good 			 reason, therefore, that Paul puts them in mind of his <i>first entering in among them</i>, (<a name="ix.ii-p12.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1002.htm#001">1Th 2:1</a><a name="ix.ii-p12.2"></A>,) that they may not draw back from that divine efficacy, which they once knew by experience.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p13"></A>The term <i>weakness</i> he employs here, and in several instances afterwards, (<a name="ix.ii-p13.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#030">2Co 11:30</a><a name="ix.ii-p13.1"></A>; <a name="ix.ii-p13.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#005">2 Cor. 12:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009">9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#010">10</a><a name="ix.ii-p13.2"></A>,) as including everything that can detract from a person&#8217;s favor and dignity in the opinion of others. <i>Fear and trembling</i> are the effects of that <i>weakness</i>  There are, however, two ways in which these two terms may be explained by us. Either we may understand him to mean, that when he pondered the magnitude of the office that he sustained, it was tremblingly, and not without great anxiety, that he occupied himself in it; or that, being encompassed with many dangers, he was in constant alarm and incessant anxiety. Either meaning suits the context 			 sufficiently well. The second, however, is, in my opinion, the more simple. Such a spirit of modesty, indeed, becomes the servants of the Lord, that, conscious of their own weakness, and looking, on the other hand, at once to the difficulty and the excellence of so arduous an office, they should enter on the discharge of it with reverence and <i>fear</i>  For those that intrude themselves confidently, and in a spirit much elated, or who discharge the ministry of the word with an easy mind, as though they were fully equal to the task, are ignorant at once of themselves and of the task.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">108</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p15"></A>As, however, Paul here connects <i>fear</i> with <i>weakness</i>, and as the term <i>weakness </i>denotes everything that was fitted to render 			 him contemptible, it follows necessarily that this <i>fear</i> must relate to dangers and difficulties. It is certain, however, that this <i>fear</i> was of such a nature as did not prevent Paul from engaging in the Lord&#8217;s work, as facts bear witness. The Lord&#8217;s servants are neither 			 so senseless as not to <i>perceive </i>impending dangers, nor so devoid of feeling as not to be moved by them. Nay more, it is necessary for them to be seriously afraid on two accounts chiefly &#8212; <i>first</i>, that, abased in their own eyes, they may learn wholly to lean and rest upon God alone, and <i>secondly</i>, that they may be trained to a thorough renunciation of self. Paul, therefore, was not devoid of the influence of <i>fear</i>, but that <i>fear</i> he controlled in such a manner as to go 			 forward, notwithstanding, with intrepidity through the midst of dangers, so as to encounter with undaunted firmness and fortitude all the assaults of Satan and of the world; and, in fine, so as to struggle through every impediment.</p>

<p><a name="ix.ii-p17"></A><b>4.</b> <i>And my preaching was not in the persuasive words.</i> By the <i>persuasive words of man&#8217;s wisdom</i> he means that exquisite oratory 			 which aims and strives rather by artifice than by truth, and also an appearance of refinement, that allures the minds of men. It is not without good reason, too, that he ascribes persuasiveness (<a name="ix.ii-p17.3"></A>&#964;&#8057; &#960;&#953;&#952;&#8049;&#957;&#959;&#957;)   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">109</FONT></A>
 			  to human wisdom. For the word of the Lord constrains us by its majesty, as if by a violent impulse, to yield obedience to it. Human wisdom, on the other hand, has her allurements, by which she insinuates herself   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">110</FONT></A>
 			  and her blandishments, as it were, by which she may conciliate for herself the affections of her hearers. With this he contrasts the <i>demonstration of the Spirit and of power</i>, which most interpreters consider as restricted to miracles; but I take it in a more general sense, as meaning the hand of God powerfully exercised in every 			 way through the instrumentality of the Apostle. <i>Spirit and power</i> he seems to have made use of by hypallage,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">111</FONT></A>
 			  (<a name="ix.ii-p20.1"></A>&#954;&#945;&#952; &#8127; &#8017;&#960;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#8052;&#957;,) to denote <i>spiritual power</i>, or at least with the view of showing by signs and effects in what manner the presence of the Spirit had shown itself in his ministry. He appropriately, too, makes use of the term 			 <a name="ix.ii-p20.2"></A>&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#948;&#949;&#8055;&#958;&#949;&#969;&#962;, (<i>demonstration</i>;) for such is our dullness in contemplating the works of God, that when he makes use of inferior instruments, they serve as so many veils to hide from us his influence, so that we do not clearly perceive it. On the other hand, 			 as in the furtherance given to Paul&#8217;s ministry, there was no aid furnished from the flesh or the world, and as the hand of God was as it were made bare, (<a name="ix.ii-p20.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010">Isa 52:10</a><a name="ix.ii-p20.3"></A>,) his influence was assuredly the more apparent.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.ii-p21"></A><a name="ix.ii-p21.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.ii-p22"></A><b>5.</b> <i>That your faith should not be in the wisdom of men. To be </i>is used here as meaning <i>to consist</i>  His meaning, then, is, that the Corinthians derived this advantage from his having preached 			 Christ among them without dependence on human wisdom, and relying solely on the Spirit&#8217;s influence, that their faith was founded not on men but on God. If the Apostle&#8217;s preaching had rested exclusively on the power of eloquence, it might have been overthrown by superior eloquence, and besides, no one would pronounce that to be solid truth which rests on mere elegance of speech. It may indeed be <i>helped by it</i>, but it ought not <i>to rest upon it</i>  On the other hand, <i>that </i>must have been most powerful which could stand of itself without any foreign aid. Hence it forms a choice commendation of Paul&#8217;s preaching, that heavenly influence shone forth in it so clearly, that it surmounted so many 			 hindrances, while deriving no assistance from the world. It follows, therefore, that they must not allow themselves to be moved away from his doctrine, which they acknowledge to rest on the authority of God. Paul, however, speaks here of the faith of the Corinthians in such a way as to bring forward this, as a general statement. Let it then be known by us that it is the property of faith to rest upon <i>God </i>alone, without depending on 			 <i>men</i>; for it requires to have so much certainty to go upon, that it will not fail, even when assailed by all the machinations of hell, but will perseveringly endure and sustain every assault. This cannot be accomplished unless we are fully persuaded that God has spoken to us, and that what we have believed is no mere contrivance of men. While faith ought 			 properly to be founded on the word of God alone, there is at the same time no impropriety in adding this second prop, &#8212; that believers recognize the word which they hear as having come forth from God, from the effect of its influence.</p>  <a name="ix.iii"></A>

By those that were <i>perfect</i>, he means not those that had attained a wisdom that was full and complete, but those who possess a sound and unbiased judgment.

 			 <i> He </i>twits, however, in passing, those that had no relish for his preaching, and gives them to understand that it was owing to their own fault: &#8220;If my doctrine is disrelished by any of you, those persons give sufficient evidence from that very token, that they possess a depraved and vitiated understanding, inasmuch as it will invariably be acknowledged to be the highest wisdom among men of 			 sound intellect and correct judgment.&#8221; While Paul&#8217;s preaching was open to the view of all, it was, nevertheless, not always estimated according to its value, and this is the reason why he appeals to sound and unbiased judges,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">113</FONT></A>
 			  who would declare that doctrine, which the world accounted insipid, to be true wisdom. Meanwhile, by the words <i>we speak</i>, he intimates that he set before them an elegant specimen of admirable wisdom, lest any one should allege that he boasted of a thing unknown.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p15"></A><i>Yet not the wisdom of this world</i>  He again repeats by way of anticipation what he had already conceded &#8212; that the gospel was not human wisdom, lest any one should object that there were few supporters of that doctrine; nay more, that it was contemned by all that were most distinguished for intellect. Hence he 			 acknowledges of his own accord what might be brought forward by way of objection, but in such a way as not at all to give up his point.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p16"></A><i>The princes of this world</i>  By the <i>princes of this world </i>he means those that have distinction in the world through means of any endowment, for sometimes there are persons, who, though they are by no means distinguished by acuteness of intellect, are nevertheless 			 held in admiration from the dignity of the station which they hold. That, however, we may not be alarmed by these imposing appearances, the Apostle adds, that they <i>come to nought</i>, or perish. For it were unbefitting, that a thing that is eternal should depend upon the authority of those who are frail, and fading, and cannot give perpetuity even to 			 themselves: &#8220;When the kingdom of God is revealed, let the wisdom of this world retire, and what is transient give place to what is eternal; for the princes of this world have their distinction, but it is of such a nature as is in one moment extinguished. What is this in comparison with the heavenly and incorruptible kingdom of God?&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="ix.iii-p18"></A><b>7.</b> <i>The wisdom of God in a mystery</i>  He assigns the reason why the doctrine of the gospel is not held in high esteem by the <i>princes of this world</i> &#8212; because it is involved in mysteries, and is consequently <i>hidden</i>  For the gospel so far transcends the perspicacity of human intellect, that to whatever height those who are accounted men of superior intellect may raise their view, they never can reach its elevated height, while in the 			 meantime they despise its meanness, as if it were prostrate at their feet. The consequence is, that the more proudly they contemn it, they are the farther from acquaintance with it &#8212; nay more, they are removed to so great a distance as to be prevented from even seeing it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p19"></A><i>Which God hath ordained.</i> Paul having said that the gospel was a <i>hidden</i> thing, there was a danger lest believers should, on hearing this, be appalled by the difficulty, and retire in despair. Accordingly he meets this 			 danger, and declares that it had notwithstanding been appointed to us, that we might enjoy it. Lest any one, I say, should reckon that he has nothing to do with the <i>hidden wisdom</i>, or should imagine it to be unlawful to direct his eyes towards it, as not being within the reach of human capacity, he teaches that it has been communicated to us in accordance 			 with the eternal counsel of God. At the same time he has something still farther in view, for by an implied comparison he extols that grace which has been opened up by Christ&#8217;s advent, and distinguishes us above our fathers, who lived under the law. On this point I have spoken more at large in the end of the last chapter of the Romans. <i>First </i>of 			 all then he argues from what God had <i>ordained</i>, for if God has appointed nothing in vain, it follows, that we will be no losers by listening to the gospel which he has appointed for us, for he accommodates himself to our capacity in addressing us. In accordance with this Isaiah (<a name="ix.iii-p19.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#019">Isa 45:19</a><a name="ix.iii-p19.2"></A>) says &#8212;</p>

<p class="Super"><a name="ix.iii-p22"></A><i>Secondly</i>, with the view of rendering the gospel attractive, and alluring us to a desire of acquaintance with it, he draws an argument still farther from the design that God had in view in giving it to us &#8212; &#8220;<i>for our glory</i>.&#8221; In this expression, too, he seems to draw a comparison between us and the fathers, our heavenly Father not having vouchsafed to them that honor which he reserved for the advent of his Son.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A>

<p><a name="ix.iii-p25"></A><b>8.</b><i> None of the princes of this world knew</i>  If you supply the words <i>by their own discernment</i>, the statement would not be more applicable to them than to the generality of mankind, and the 			 very lowest of the people; for what are the attainments of all of us as to this matter, from the greatest to the least? Only we may perhaps say, that <i>princes</i>, rather than others, are charged with blindness and ignorance &#8212; for this reason, that they alone appear in the view of the word clear-sighted and wise. At the same time I should prefer to understand 			 the expression in a more simple way, agreeably to the common usage of Scripture, which is wont to speak in terms of universality of those things that, happen <a name="ix.iii-p25.1"></A>&#949;&#960;&#953; &#964;&#959; &#960;&#959;&#955;&#965;, that is <i>commonly</i>, and also to make a negative statement in terms of universality, 			 as to those things that happen only <a name="ix.iii-p25.2"></A>&#7952;&#960;&#953; &#7956;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#964;&#959;&#957;, that is <i>very seldom</i>  In this sense there were nothing inconsistent with this statement, though there were found a few men of distinction, and elevated above others in point of dignity, who were at the 			 same time endowed with the pure knowledge of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p26"></A><i>For had they known</i>  The wisdom of God shone forth clearly <i>in Christ</i>, and yet <i>there </i>the <i>princes </i>did not perceive 			 it; for those who took the lead in the crucifixion of Christ were on the one hand the chief men of the Jews, high in credit for holiness and wisdom; and on the other hand Pilate and the Roman empire. In this we have a most distinct proof of the utter blindness of all that are wise only according to the flesh. This argument of the Apostle, however, might appear to be weak. &#8220;What! do we not every day see persons who, with deliberate malice, fight against the truth of God, as to which they are not 			 ignorant; nay, even if a rebellion so manifest were not to be seen by us with our eyes, what else is the sin against the Holy Ghost than a willful obstinacy against God, when a man knowingly and willingly does not merely oppose his word, but even fights against it. It is on this account, too, that Christ declares that the Pharisees, and others of that description, <i>knew him</i>, (<a name="ix.iii-p26.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#028">Joh 7:28</a><a name="ix.iii-p26.1"></A>,) while he deprives them of all pretext of ignorance, and accuses them of impious cruelty in persecuting him, the faithful servant of the Father, for no other reason but that they hated the truth.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p27"></A>I answer that there are two kinds of ignorance. The <i>one </i>arises from inconsiderate zeal, not expressly rejecting what is good, but from having an impression that it is evil. No one, it is true, sins in ignorance in such a way as not to be chargeable meanwhile in the sight of God with an evil conscience, there being always a mixture of hypocrisy, or pride, or contempt; but at the same time judgment, and all intelligence in the mind of 			 man, are sometimes so effectually choked, that nothing but bare ignorance is to be seen by others, or even by the individual himself. Such was Paul before he was enlightened; for the reason why he hated Christ and was hostile to his doctrine was, that he was through ignorance hurried away with a preposterous zeal for the law.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">116</FONT></A>
 			 Yet he was not devoid of hypocrisy, nor exempt from pride, so as to be free from blame in the sight of God, but those vices were so completely covered over with ignorance and blindness as not to be perceived or felt even by himself.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p29"></A>The <i>other </i>kind of ignorance has more of the appearance of insanity and derangement, than of mere ignorance; for those that of their own accord rise up against God, are like persons in a frenzy, who, seeing, see not. (<a name="ix.iii-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#013">Mt 13:13</a><a name="ix.iii-p29.1"></A>.) It must be looked upon, indeed, as 			 a settled point, that infidelity is always blind; but the difference lies here, that in some cases malice is covered over with blindness to such a degree that the individual, through a kind of stupidity, is without any perception of his own wickedness. This is the case with those who, with a good intention, as they speak, or in other words, a foolish imagination, impose upon themselves. In some cases malice has the ascendancy in such a manner, that in spite of the checks of conscience, the 			 individual rushes forward into wickedness of this sort with a kind of madness.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">117</FONT></A>
 			  Hence it is not to be wondered, if Paul declares that <i>the princes of this world would not have crucified Christ, had they known</i> the wisdom of God. For the Pharisees and Scribes did not know Christ&#8217;s doctrine to be true, so as not to be bewildered in their mind, and wander on in their own darkness.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iii-p31"></A><a name="ix.iii-p31.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p32"></A><b>9.</b><i> As it is written, &#8220;What eye hath not seen.&#8221;</i> All are agreed that this passage is taken from <a name="ix.iii-p32.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004">Isa 64:4</a><a name="ix.iii-p32.1"></A>, and as the meaning is at first view plain and easy, interpreters do not give themselves much 			 trouble in expounding it. On looking, however, more narrowly into it, two very great difficulties present themselves. The <i>first </i>is, that the words that are here quoted by Paul do not correspond with the words of the Prophet. The <i>second </i>is, that it seems as though Paul had perverted the Prophet&#8217;s declaration to a purpose quite foreign to his design.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p33"></A>First then as to the words; and as they may be taken in different senses, they are explained variously by interpreters. Some render the passage thus: &#8220;From the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived with their ears, and eye hath not seen any god beside Thee, who doth act in such a manner towards him that waiteth for him.&#8221; Others understand the discourse as 			 addressed to God, in this manner: &#8220;Eye hath not seen, nor hath ear heard, O God, besides thee, the things which thou dost for those that wait for thee.&#8221; Literally, however, the Prophet&#8217;s meaning is: &#8220;From the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor have they perceived with the ears, hath not seen a god, (or O God,) besides thee, will do (or will prepare) for him that waiteth for him.&#8221; If we understand <a name="ix.iii-p33.1"></A>&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; (God) to be in the accusative, the relative <i>who </i>must be supplied. This exposition, too, appears, at first view, to suit better with the Prophet&#8217;s context in respect of the verb that follows being used in the third person;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">118</FONT></A>
 			  but it is farther removed from Paul&#8217;s meaning, on which we ought to place more dependence than on any other consideration. For where shall we find a surer or more faithful interpreter than the Spirit of God of this authoritative declaration, which He himself dictated to Isaiah &#8212; in the exposition which He has furnished by the mouth of Paul. With the view of obviating, however, the calumnies of the wicked, I observe that the Hebrew idiom admits of our understanding 			 the Prophets true meaning to be this: &#8220;O God, neither hath eye seen, nor hath ear heard: but thou alone knowest the things which thou art wont to do to those that wait for thee.&#8221; The sudden change of person forms no objection, as we know that it is so common in the writings of the Prophets, that it needs not be any hindrance in our way. If any one, however, prefers the former interpretation, he will have no occasion for charging either us or the 			 Apostle with departing from the simple meaning of the words, for we supply less than they do, as they are under the necessity of adding a mark of comparison to the verb, rendering it thus: &#8220;<i>who</i> doth act <i>in such a manner</i>.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p35"></A>As to what follows respecting the<i> entering </i>of these things <i>into the heart of man</i>, though the expression is not made use of by the Prophet, it does not differ materially from the clause <i>besides thee</i>  For in ascribing this knowledge to God alone, he excludes from it not merely the bodily senses of men, but also the entire faculty of the understanding. While, therefore, the Prophet makes mention only of sight and hearing, he includes at the same time by implication all the faculties of the soul. And without doubt these are the two instruments by which we attain the knowledge of those things that find their way into the 			 understanding. In using the expression <i>them that love him</i>, he has followed the Greek interpreters, who have translated it in this way from having been misled by the resemblance between one letter and another;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">119</FONT></A>
 			  but as that did not affect the point in hand, he did not choose to depart from the common reading, as we frequently have occasion to observe how closely he follows the received version. Though the words, therefore, are not the same, there is no real difference of meaning.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iii-p37"></A>I come now to the subject-matter. The Prophet in that passage, when mentioning how signally God had on all occasions befriended his people in their <i>emergencies</i>, exclaims, that his acts of kindness to the pious surpass the comprehension of human intellect. &#8220;But what has this to do,&#8221; some one will say, &#8220;with spiritual doctrine, and the promises of eternal life, as to which Paul is here arguing?&#8221; There are three ways 			 in which this question may be answered. There were no inconsistency in affirming that the Prophet, having made mention of earthly blessings, was in consequence of this led on to make a general statement, and even to extol that spiritual blessedness which is laid up in heaven for believers. I prefer, however, to understand him simply as referring to those gifts of God&#8217;s grace that are daily conferred upon believers. In these it becomes us always to observe their source, and not to confine our 			 views to their present aspect. Now their source is that unmerited goodness of God, by which he has adopted us into the number of his sons. He, therefore, who would estimate these things aright, will not contemplate them in their naked aspect, but will clothe them with God&#8217;s fatherly love, as with a robe, and will thus be led forward from temporal favors to eternal life. It might also be maintained that the argument is from the less to the greater; for if man&#8217;s intellect is not competent to 			 measure God&#8217;s earthly gifts, how much less will it reach the height of heaven? (<a name="ix.iii-p37.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#012">Joh 3:12</a><a name="ix.iii-p37.1"></A>.)

Hence the greater the bluntness of the human intellect for understanding the mysteries of God, and the greater the uncertainty under which it labors, so much the surer is our faith, which rests for its support on the revelation of God&#8217;s Spirit. In this, too, we recognize the unbounded goodness of God, who makes our defect contribute to our advantage.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p13"></A><i>For the Spirit searcheth all things</i>  This is added for the consolation of the pious, that they may rest more securely in the revelation which they have from the Spirit of God, as though he had said. &#8220;Let it suffice us to have the Spirit of God as a witness, for 			 there is nothing in God that is too profound for him to reach.&#8221; For such is the import here of the word <i>searcheth</i>  By the <i>deep things</i> you must understand &#8212; not secret 			 judgments, which we are forbidden to <i>search into</i>, but the entire doctrine of salvation, which would have been to no purpose set before us in the Scriptures, were it not that God elevates our minds to it by his Spirit.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iv-p14"></A><a name="ix.iv-p14.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p15"></A><b>11.</b> <i>For what man knoweth?</i> Two different things he intends to teach here: <i>first</i>, that the doctrine of the Gospel cannot be understood otherwise than by the testimony of the Holy Spirit; and 			 <i>secondly</i>, that those who have a testimony of this nature from the Holy Spirit, have an assurance as firm and solid, as if they felt with their hands what they believe, for the Spirit is a faithful and indubitable witness. This he proves by a similitude drawn from our own <i>spirit</i>:<i> 			 </i>for every one is conscious of his own thoughts, and on the other hand what lies hid in any man&#8217;s heart, is unknown to another. In the same way what is the counsel of God, and what his will, is hid from all mankind, for &#8220;who hath been his counselor?&#8221; (<a name="ix.iv-p15.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034">Ro 11:34</a><a name="ix.iv-p15.1"></A>.) It is, therefore, a secret recess, inaccessible 			 to mankind; but, if the Spirit of God himself introduces us into it, or in other words, makes us acquainted with those things that are otherwise hid from our view, there will then be no more ground for hesitation, for nothing that is in God escapes the notice of the Spirit of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p16"></A>This similitude, however, may seem to be not altogether very appropriate, for as the tongue bears an impress of the mind, mankind communicate their dispositions to each other, so that they become acquainted with each other&#8217;s thoughts. Why then may we not understand from the word of God what is his will? For while mankind by pretenses and falsehoods in many cases conceal their thoughts rather than discover them, this cannot happen with God, 			 whose word is undoubted truth, and his genuine and lively image. We must, however, carefully observe how far Paul designed to extend this comparison. A man&#8217;s innermost thought, of which others are ignorant, is perceived by himself alone: if he afterwards makes it known to others, this does not hinder but that his spirit alone knows what is in him. For it may happen that he does not persuade: it may even happen that he does not properly express his own meaning; but even if he attains both 			 objects, this statement is not at variance with the other &#8212; that his own spirit alone has the true knowledge of it. There is this difference, however, between God&#8217;s thoughts and those of men, that men mutually understand each other; but the word of God is a kind of <i>hidden wisdom</i>, the loftiness of which is not reached by the weakness of the human <i>intellect</i>. Thus the light shineth in darkness, (<a name="ix.iv-p16.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#005">Joh 1:5</a><a name="ix.iv-p16.1"></A>,) aye and until the Spirit opens the eyes of the blind.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p17"></A><i>The spirit of a man</i>  Observe, that the <i>spirit of a man </i>is taken here for the soul, in which the intellectual faculty, as it is called, resides. For Paul would have expressed himself inaccurately if he had ascribed this knowledge to man&#8217;s intellect, or in other 			 words, the faculty itself, and not to the soul, which is endued with the power of understanding.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.iv-p18"></A><a name="ix.iv-p18.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p19"></A><b>12.</b> <i>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world</i>  He heightens by contrast the certainty of which he had made mention. &#8220;The Spirit of revelation,&#8221; says he, 			 &#8220;which we have received, is not of the world, so as to be merely creeping upon the ground, so as to be subject to vanity, or be in suspense, or vary or fluctuate, or hold us in doubt and perplexity. On the contrary, it is from God, and hence it is above all heavens, of solid and unvarying truth, and placed above all risk of doubt.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.iv-p20"></A>It is a passage that is most abundantly clear, for refuting that diabolical doctrine of the Sophists as to a constant hesitancy on the part of believers. For they require all believers to be in doubt, whether they are in the grace of God or not, and allow of no assurance of salvation, but what hangs on moral or probable conjecture. In this, however, they overthrow faith in two 			 respects: for <i>first </i>they would have us be in doubt, whether we are in a state of grace, and then afterwards they suggest a <i>second </i>occasion of doubt &#8212; as to final perseverance.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">120</FONT></A>
 			 Here, however, the Apostle declares in general terms, that the <i>elect </i>have the Spirit given them, by whose testimony they are assured that they have been adopted to the hope of eternal salvation. Undoubtedly, if they would maintain their doctrine, they must of necessity either take away the Spirit of God from the elect, or make even the Spirit himself subject to uncertainty. Both of these things are openly at variance with Paul&#8217;s doctrine. Hence we may know the nature of faith 			 to be this, that conscience has from the Holy Spirit a sure testimony of the good-will of God towards it, so that, resting upon this, it does not hesitate to invoke God as a Father. Thus Paul lifts up our faith above the world, that it may look down with lofty disdain upon all the pride of the flesh; for otherwise it will be always timid and wavering, because we see how boldly human ingenuity exalts itself, the haughtiness of which requires to be trodden under foot by the sons of God through 			 means of an opposing haughtiness of heroical magnanimity.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A>

<p><a name="ix.iv-p23"></A><i>That we may know the things that are given us by Christ.</i> The word <i>know </i>is made use of to express more fully the assurance of confidence.

The things that he makes mention of as <i>given by Christ</i> are the blessings that we obtain through his death and resurrection &#8212; that being reconciled to God, and having obtained remission of sins, we know that we have been adopted to the hope of eternal life, and that, being sanctified by the Spirit of regeneration, we are made new creatures, that we may live to God.

In the meantime he returns to the concession that he had made before &#8212; that his preaching had not been adorned with any glitter of words, and had no luster of elegance, but was contented with the simple doctrine of the Holy Spirit.

 			  he means those that savor of human learning, and are polished according to the rules of the rhetoricians, or blown up with philosophical loftiness, with a view to excite the admiration of the hearers. <i>The words taught by the Spirit,</i> on the other hand, are such as are adapted to a pure and simple style, corresponding to the 			 dignity of the Spirit, rather than to an empty ostentation. For in order that eloquence may not be wanting, we must always take care that the wisdom of God be not polluted with any borrowed and profane luster.

 			  that is, he tempers that heavenly wisdom of the Spirit with a simple style of speech, and of such a nature as carries in its front the native energy of the Spirit.

 			  By the <i>animal man </i>he does not mean (as is commonly thought) the man that is given up to gross lusts, or, as they say, to his own sensuality, but any man that is endowed with nothing more than the faculties   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">126</FONT></A>
 			  of nature.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">127</FONT></A>
 			  This appears from the corresponding term, for he draws a comparison between the <i>animal </i>man and the <i>spiritual</i>  As <i>the latter </i>denotes the man whose understanding is regulated by the illumination of the Spirit of God, there can be no doubt that <i>the 			 former </i>denotes the man that is left in a purely natural condition, as they speak. For the soul   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A>
 			  belongs to nature, but the Spirit is of supernatural communication.</p>  		  
<p class="Super"><a name="ix.v-p15"></A>He returns to what he had previously touched upon, for his object is to remove a stumblingblock which might stand in the way of the weak &#8212; that there were so many that despised the gospel. He shows that we ought to make no account of a contempt of such a nature as proceeds from ignorance, and that it ought, consequently, to be no hindrance in the way of our going forward in the race of faith, unless perhaps we choose to shut our 			 eyes upon the brightness of the sun, because it is not seen by the blind. It would, however, argue great ingratitude in any individual, when God bestows upon him a special favor, to reject it, on the ground of its not being common to all, whereas, on the contrary, its very rareness ought to enhance its value.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.v-p17"></A><i>For they are foolishness to him, neither can he know them</i>. &#8220;The doctrine of the gospel,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is insipid  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">130</FONT></A>
 			 in the view of all that are wise merely in the view of man. But whence comes this? It is from their own blindness. In what respect, then, does this detract from the majesty of the gospel?&#8221; In short, while ignorant persons depreciate the gospel, because they measure its value by the estimation in which it is held by men, Paul derives an argument from this for extolling more highly its dignity. For he teaches that the reason why it is contemned is that it is unknown, and that the reason 			 why it is unknown is that it is too profound and sublime to be apprehended by the understanding of man. What a superior wisdom  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">131</FONT></A>
 			 this is, which so far transcends all human understanding, that man cannot have so much as a taste of it!  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">132</FONT></A>
 			 While, however, Paul here tacitly imputes it to the pride of the flesh, that mankind dare to condemn as foolish what they do not comprehend, he at the same time shows how great is the weakness or rather bluntness of the human understanding, when he declares it to be incapable of spiritual apprehension. For he teaches, that it is not owing simply to the obstinacy of the human will, but to the impotency, also, of the understanding, that man does not attain to the <i>things of the 			 Spirit</i>. Had he said that men are not <i>willing </i>to be wise, <i>that </i>indeed would have been true, but he states farther that they are not <i>able</i>. Hence we infer, that faith is not in one&#8217;s own power, but is divinely conferred.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.v-p21"></A><i>Because they are spiritually discerned</i>  That is, the Spirit of God, from whom the doctrine of the gospel comes, is its only true interpreter, to open it up to us. Hence in judging of it, men&#8217;s minds must of necessity be in blindness until they are enlightened by the Spirit of God.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">133</FONT></A>
 			  Hence infer, that all mankind are by nature destitute of the Spirit of God: otherwise the argument would be inconclusive. It is from the Spirit of God, it is true, that we have that feeble spark of reason which we all enjoy; but at present we are speaking of that special discovery of heavenly wisdom which God vouchsafes to his sons alone. Hence the more insufferable the ignorance of those who imagine that the gospel is offered to mankind in common in such a way that 			 all indiscriminately are free   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">134</FONT></A>
 			  to embrace salvation by faith.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.v-p24"></A><a name="ix.v-p24.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.v-p25"></A><b>15.</b> <i>But the spiritual man judgeth all things.</i> Having stripped of all authority man&#8217;s carnal judgment, he now teaches, that <i>the spiritual</i> alone are fit judges as to this matter, 			 inasmuch as God is known only by his Spirit, and it is his peculiar province to distinguish between his own things and those of others, to approve of what is his own, and to make void all things else. The meaning, then, is this: &#8220;Away with all the discernment of the flesh as to this matter! It is <i>the spiritual man</i> alone that has such 			 a firm and solid acquaintance with the mysteries of God, as to distinguish without fail between truth and falsehood &#8212; between the doctrine of God and the contrivances of man, so as not to fall into mistake.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">135</FONT></A>
 			  <i>He</i>, on the other hand, <i>is judged by no man</i>, because the assurance of faith is not subject to men, as though they could make it totter at their nod,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">136</FONT></A>
 			  it being superior even to angels themselves.&#8221; Observe, that this prerogative is not ascribed to the man as an individual, but to the word of God, which <i>the spiritual </i>follow in judging, and which is truly dictated to them by God with true discernment. Where <i>that </i>is afforded, a man&#8217;s persuasion   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">137</FONT></A>
 			  is placed beyond the range of human judgment. Observe, farther, the word rendered <i>judged</i>: by which the Apostle intimates, that we are not merely enlightened by the Lord to perceive the truth, but are also endowed with a spirit of discrimination, so as not to hang in doubt between truth and falsehood, but are able to determine 			 what we ought to shun and what to follow.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.v-p29"></A>But here it may be asked, who is <i>the spiritual man</i>, and where we may find one that is endowed with so much light as to be prepared to <i>judge of all things</i>, feeling as we do, that we are at all times encompassed with much ignorance, and are in danger of erring: nay more, even those who come nearest to perfection from time to time fall and bruise themselves. The answer is easy: Paul does not extend this faculty to everything, so as to represent all that are renewed by the Spirit of God as exempt from every kind of error, but simply designs to teach, that the wisdom of the flesh is of no avail for judging of the doctrine of piety, and 			 that this right of judgment and authority belong exclusively to the Spirit of God. In so far, therefore, as any one is regenerated, and according to the measure of grace conferred upon him, does he judge with accuracy and certainty, and no farther.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.v-p30"></A><i>He himself is judged by no man</i>. I have already explained on what ground he says that <i>the spiritual man </i>is not subject to the judgment of any man &#8212; because the truth of faith, which depends on God alone, and is grounded on his word, does not stand or fall according to the pleasure of men. 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">138</FONT></A>
 			  What he says afterwards, that</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.v-p32"></A>the spirit of one Prophet is subject to the other Prophets, <br> 			 (<a name="ix.v-p32.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#032">1Co 14:32</a><a name="ix.v-p32.2"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.v-p33"></A>is not at all inconsistent with this statement. For what is the design of that subjection, but that each of the Prophets listens to the others, and does not despise or reject their revelations, in order that what is discovered to be the truth of God,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">139</FONT></A>
 			  may at length remain firm, and be received by all? Here, however, he places the science of faith, which has been received from God,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">140</FONT></A>
 			  above the height of heaven and earth, in order that it may not be estimated by the judgment of men. At the same time, <a name="ix.v-p35.2"></A>&#8021;&#960; &#8127; &#959;&#8016;&#948;&#949;&#957;&#8057;&#962; may be taken in the neuter gender as meaning &#8212; by <i>nothing</i>, understanding it as referring to a thing, and not to a man. In this way the contrast 			 will be more complete,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">141</FONT></A>
 			  as intimating that <i>the spiritual man</i>, in so far as he is endowed with the Spirit of God, <i>judgeth all things</i>, but <i>is judged by 			 nothing</i>, because he is not subject to any human wisdom or reason. In this way, too, Paul would exempt the consciences of the pious from all decrees, laws, and censures of men.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="ix.v-p37"></A><a name="ix.v-p37.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.v-p38"></A><b>16.</b> <i>For who hath known</i>? It is probable that Paul had an eye to what we read in the 40th chapter of Isaiah. The Prophet there asks,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="ix.v-p39"></A>Who hath been God&#8217;s counselor? Who hath weighed his Spirit,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">142</FONT></A>
 			  (<a name="ix.v-p40.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013">Isa 40:13</a><a name="ix.v-p40.1"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.v-p41"></A>or hath aided him both in the creation of the world and in his other works? and, in fine, who hath comprehended the reason of his works? Now, in like manner Paul, by this interrogation, designs to teach, that his secret counsel which is contained in the gospel is far removed from the understanding of men. This then is a confirmation of the preceding statement.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ix.v-p42"></A><i>But we have the mind of Christ.</i> It is uncertain whether he speaks of believers universally, or of ministers exclusively. Either of these meanings will suit sufficiently well with the context, though I prefer to view it as referring more particularly to himself and other faithful ministers.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">143</FONT></A>
 			  He says, then, that the servants of the Lord are taught by the paramount authority of the Spirit, what is farthest removed from the judgment of the flesh, that they may speak fearlessly as from the mouth of the Lord, &#8212; which gift flows out afterwards by degrees to the whole Church.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="ix.iii-p36"></A> The word made use of by Isaiah is <a name="ix.iii-p36.1"></A>&#1502;&#1495;&#1499;&#1492;, which is a part of the verb <a name="ix.iii-p36.2"></A>&#1495;&#1499;&#1492;, to <i>wait for</i>, and Calvin&#8217;s meaning most probably is, that the &#8220;Greek interpreters had (from the resemblance between <a name="ix.iii-p36.3"></A>&#1489; and <a name="ix.iii-p36.4"></A>&#1499;) been led into the mistake of supposing it to be a part of the verb <a name="ix.iii-p36.5"></A>&#1495;&#1489;&#1489;, to <i>love</i>, while the corresponding part of the latter <i>verb</i> &#8212; <a name="ix.iii-p36.6"></A>&#1502;&#1495;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;, manifestly differs very widely from the word made use of by the Prophet. 				  There appears, how ever, to have been an oversight, in this instance, on the part of Calvin, as the word in the Septuagint version is <i>not </i>the word made use of by the <i>Apostle</i> &#8212; <a name="ix.iii-p36.7"></A>&#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#8182;&#963;&#953;&#957;, &#8220;them that love&#8221; 				  (him,) but (corresponding to the word made use of bythe <i>Prophet </i><a name="ix.iii-p36.8"></A>&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;, &#8220;them that wait for&#8221; (him.) It is not a little <i>singular</i>, that Clemens Romanus (Ep. ad Cor. Sect. 34.) quotes the words of Isaiah precisely as Paul quotes them, with the exception of the last clause, which he gives as follows: <a name="ix.iii-p36.9"></A>&#8005;&#963;&#945; &#7969;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#956;&#945;&#963;&#949; &#964;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#8212; &#8220;which he hath prepared for them that <i>wait for </i>him.&#8221; Some have supposed the citation to have <i>been </i>taken from one or other of the two Apocryphal books, entitled, &#8220;The Ascension of Esaiah,&#8221; and &#8220;The Apocalyps of Elias,&#8221; in both of which this passage was found, but, as is justly 				  observed by <i>Horne </i>in his <i>Introduction </i>(volume 2,) &#8220;it is so near to the Hebrew here both in sense and words, that we cannot suppose it to be taken from any other source, nor in this case would the Apostle have introduced it with the formula of quotation &#8212; as <i>it is written</i>.&#8221; In accordance with 				  Calvln&#8217;s remark, that &#8220;though the words are not the same, there is no real difference of meaning,&#8221; it is well observed by <i>Poole </i>in his <i>Annotations</i>, that &#8220;waiting <i>for</i>&#8221; God is &#8220;the certain product and 				  effect of <i>love to him</i>.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed</i></p> 			 </P>
