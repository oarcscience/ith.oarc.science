<span id="xvi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 9

<span id="xvi.i"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p1"></span><span id="xvi.i-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
9:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#001.md)<span id="xvi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p2"></span>**1.** Am I not an apostle? am I not free?
have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?

<span id="xvi.i-p3"></span>**1.** Non sum liber? non sum Apostolus?
 <span id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md) nonne Iesum Christum Dominum
nostrum vidi? nonne opus meum vos estis in Domino?

<span id="xvi.i-p5"></span>**2.** If I be not an an apostle unto others,
yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in
the Lord.

<span id="xvi.i-p6"></span>**2.** Si aliis non sum Apostolus, vobis
tamen sum: sigillum enim Apostolatus mei vos estis in Domino?

<span id="xvi.i-p7"></span>**3.** Mine answer to them that do examine me
is this,

<span id="xvi.i-p8"></span>**3.** Haec mea defensio est apudeos, qui in
me inquirunt.

<span id="xvi.i-p9"></span>**4.** Have we not power to eat and to drink?

<span id="xvi.i-p10"></span>**4.** Numquid non habemus potestatem edendi
et bibendi?

<span id="xvi.i-p11"></span>**5.** Have we not power to lead about a
sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and *as* the brethren of the
Lord, and Cephas?

<span id="xvi.i-p12"></span>**5.** Numquid potestatem non habemus
circumducendae uxoris sororis,quemadmodum et reliqui Apostoli,et fratres
Domini, et Cephas?

<span id="xvi.i-p13"></span>**6.** Or I only and Barnabas, have not we
power to forbear working?

<span id="xvi.i-p14"></span>**6.** An ego solus et Barnabas non habemus
potestatem hoc agendi?  <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md)

<span id="xvi.i-p16"></span>**7.** Who goeth a warfare any time own
charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof?
or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?

<span id="xvi.i-p17"></span>**7.** Quis militavit suo sumptu unquam?
quis plantat vitem, et ex fructu ejus non comedit? quis pascit gregem,
et lacte gregis non vescitur?

<span id="xvi.i-p18"></span>**8.** Say I these things as a man? Or saith
not the law the same also?

<span id="xvi.i-p19"></span>**8.** Num secundum hominem haec dico?

<span id="xvi.i-p20"></span>**9.** For it is written in the law of
Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the
corn. Doth God take care for oxen?

<span id="xvi.i-p21"></span>**9.** Numquid lex quoque eadem non dicit?
in lege enim Mosis (<span id="xvi.i-p21.1"></span>[De
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu025.htm#004)<span id="xvi.i-p21.1"></span>.md)
scripture est: non obligabis os bovi trituranti: numquid boves curae
sunt Deo,

<span id="xvi.i-p22"></span>**10.** Or saith he *it* altogether for our
sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, *this* is written: that he that ploweth
should plow in hope; and that he that thrasheth in hope should be
partaker of his hope.

<span id="xvi.i-p23"></span>**10.** Vel propter nos omnino dicit? Et
sane propter nos scripturm est: quoniam debet sub spe, qui arat, arare,
et qui triturat, sub spe participandi. (Alias: quia debeat sub spe qui
arat, arare, et qui triturat sub spe, spei suae particeps esse debeat.)

<span id="xvi.i-p24"></span>**11.** If we have sown unto you spiritual
things, *is it* a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?

<span id="xvi.i-p25"></span>**11.** Si nos vobis spiritualia
seminavimus, magnum, si carnalia vestra metamus?

<span id="xvi.i-p26"></span>**12.** If others be partakers of *this*
power over you, *are* not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this
power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of
Christ.

<span id="xvi.i-p27"></span>**12.** Si alii hanc in vos sumunt
potestatem, an non magis nos? atqui non usi sumus facultate hac: sed
omnia sufferimus, ut ne quam offensionem demus Evangelio Christi.

<span id="xvi.i-p28"></span> 

<span id="xvi.i-p29"></span><span id="xvi.i-p29.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p30"></span>**1.** *Am I not free?* He confirms by facts
what he had stated immediately before, — that he would rather never
taste of flesh during his whole life, than give occasion of stumbling to
a brother, and, at the same time, he shows that he requires nothing more
from them than what he had himself practiced. And, assuredly, natural
equity requires that whatever law is imposed by any one upon others,
should be submitted to by himself. More especially a Christian teacher
should impose upon himself this necessity, that he may have it always in
his power to confirm his doctrine by an exemplary life. We know by
experience, that it is a very unpleasant thing that Paul required from
the Corinthians — to refrain, for the sake of their brethren, from
making use of the liberty that was allowed them. He could scarcely have
demanded this, if he had not taken the lead and shown them the way. And
he had, it is true, promised that he would do this, but, as he might not
be believed by all on his simply promising for the future, he makes
mention of what he had already done. He brings forward a remarkable
instance, in respect of his having denied himself the liberty which he
might otherwise have used, purely in order that he might give the false
Apostles no occasion for calumniating. He had preferred to earn his food
with his own hands, rather than be supported at the expense of the
Corinthians, to whom he administered the Gospel.

<span id="xvi.i-p31"></span>He treats, however, at great length of the
right of the Apostles to receive food and clothing. This he does, partly
for the purpose of stirring them up the more to forego many things for
the sake of their brethren after his example, because they were unduly
tenacious in the retaining of their own rights, and partly for the
purpose of exposing more fully in view the unreasonableness of
calumniators, who took occasion for reviling from what was anything but
blameworthy. He speaks, also, interrogatively, in order to press the
matter home more closely. The question — *Am* *I not free?* is of a
general nature. When he adds — *Am* *I not an Apostle*? he specifies a
particular kind of liberty. “If I am an Apostle of Christ, why should my
condition be worse than that of others?” Hence he proves his liberty on
the ground of his being an Apostle.

<span id="xvi.i-p32"></span>*Have I not seen Jesus Christ*? He expressly
adds this, in order that he may not be reckoned inferior in any respect,
to the other Apostles, for this one thing the malevolent and envious
bawled out on all occasions — that he had received from the hands of men
whatever he had of the gospel, inasmuch as he had never seen Christ.
And, certainly, he had not had converse with Christ while he was in the
world, but Christ had appeared to him after his resurrection. It was not
a smaller privilege, however, to have seen Christ in his immortal glory,
than to have seen him in the abasement of mortal flesh. He makes
mention, also, afterwards of this vision, (<span
id="xvi.i-p32.1"></span>[1Co 15:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p32.1"></span>,) and mention is made of it twice in the Acts,
(<span id="xvi.i-p32.2"></span>[Ac
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003.md)<span id="xvi.i-p32.2"></span>, and
<span id="xvi.i-p32.3"></span>[Ac
22:6](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#006)<span id="xvi.i-p32.3"></span>..md)
Hence this passage tends to establish his call, because, although he had
not been set apart as one of the twelve, there was no less authority in
the appointment which Christ published from heaven.

<span id="xvi.i-p33"></span>*Are not ye my work*? He now, in the
*second* place, establishes his Apostleship from the effect of it,
because he had gained over the Corinthians to the Lord by the gospel.
Now this is a great thing that Paul claims for himself, when he calls
their conversion *his work*, for it is in a manner a new creation of the
soul. But how will this correspond with what we had above — that

<span id="xvi.i-p34"></span>he that planteth is nothing, and he that
watereth is nothing?  
(<span id="xvi.i-p34.2"></span>[1Co
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007)<span id="xvi.i-p34.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xvi.i-p35"></span>I answer, that as God is the efficient
cause, while man, with his preaching, is an instrument that can do
nothing of itself, we must always speak of the efficacy of the ministry
in such a manner that the entire praise of the work may be reserved for
God alone. But in some cases, when the ministry is spoken of, man is
compared with God, and then that statement holds good — *He that
planteth is nothing, and he that watereth is nothing*; for what can be
left to a man if he is brought into competition with God? Hence
Scripture represents ministers as nothing in comparison with God; but
when the ministry is simply treated of without any comparison with God,
then, as in this passage, its efficacy is honorably made mention of,
with signal encomiums. For, in that case, the question is not, what man
can do of himself without God, but, on the contrary, God himself, who is
the author, is conjoined with the instrument, and the Spirit’s influence
with man’s labor. In other words, the question is not, what man himself
accomplishes by his own power, but what God effects through his hands.

<span id="xvi.i-p36"></span><span id="xvi.i-p36.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p37"></span>**2.** *If I am not an Apostle to others*
The sum of this tends to the establishing of his authority among the
Corinthians, so as to place it beyond all dispute. “If there are those,”
says he, “who have doubts as to my Apostleship, to you, at least, it
ought to be beyond all doubt, for, as I planted your Church by my
ministry, you are either not believers, or you must necessarily
recognize me as an Apostle. And that he may not seem to rest in mere
words, he states that the reality itself was to be seen,  <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md) because God had sealed his Apostleship
by the faith of the Corinthians. Should any one, however, object, that
this suits the false Apostles too, who gather disciples to themselves, I
answer, that pure doctrine is above all things required, in order that
any one may have a confirmation of his ministry in the sight of God from
its effect. There is nothing, therefore, here to furnish impostors with
matter of congratulation, if they have deceived any of the populace,
nay, even nations and kingdoms, by their falsehoods. Although in some
cases persons are the occasion of spreading the kingdom of Christ, who,
nevertheless, *do not preach the gospel sincerely*, as is said in <span
id="xvi.i-p38.2"></span>[Php 1:16](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p38.2"></span>, it is not without good reason that Paul infers
from the fruit of his labor, that he is divinely commissioned: for the
structure of the Corinthian Church was such, that the blessing of God
could easily be seen shining forth in it, which ought to have served as
a confirmation of Paul’s office.

<span id="xvi.i-p39"></span><span id="xvi.i-p39.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p40"></span>**3.** *My defense.* Apart from the
principal matter that he has at present in hand, it appears also to have
been his intention to beat down, in passing, the calumnies of those who
clamored against his call, as if he had been one of the ordinary class
of ministers. “I am accustomed,” says he, “to put you forward as my
shield, in the event of any one detracting from the honor of my
Apostleship.” Hence it follows, that the Corinthians are injurious and
inimical to themselves, if they do not acknowledge him as such, for if
their faith was a solemn attestation of Paul’s Apostleship, and his
*defense*, against slanderers, the one could not be invalidated without
the other falling along with it.

<span id="xvi.i-p41"></span>Where others read — *those who interrogate
me*, I have rendered it — *those that examine me* — for he refers to
those who raised a dispute as to his Apostleship.  <span
id="fr_479"></span>[480](#fn_479.md) Latin writers, I confess, speak of a
criminal being *interrogated*  <span id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md)
according to the laws, but the meaning of the word <span
id="xvi.i-p43.2"></span>ἀνακρίνειν which Paul makes use of, seemed to me
to be brought out better in this way.

<span id="xvi.i-p44"></span><span id="xvi.i-p44.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p45"></span>**4.** *Have we not power*? He concludes
from what has been already said, that he had a right to receive food and
clothing from them,  <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) for Paul
ate and drank, but not at the expense of the Church. This, then, was one
liberty that he dispensed with. The other was, that he had not a wife —
to be maintained, also, at the public expense. Eusebius infers from
these words that Paul was married, but had left his wife somewhere, that
she might not be a burden to the Churches, but there is no foundation
for this, for he might bring forward this, even though unmarried. In
honoring a Christian wife with the name of *sister*, he intimates, first
of all, by this, how firm and lovely ought to be the connection between
a pious pair, being held by a double tie. Farther he hints at the same
time what modesty and honorable conduct ought to subsist between them.
Hence, too, we may infer, how very far marriage is from being unsuitable
to the ministers of the Church. I pass over the fact, that the Apostles
made use of it, as to whose example we shall have occasion to speak ere
long, but Paul here teaches, in general terms, what is allowable for
all.

<span id="xvi.i-p47"></span><span id="xvi.i-p47.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p48"></span>**5.** *Even as the other Apostles.* In
addition to the Lord’s permission, he mentions the common practice of
others. And with the view of bringing out more fully the waiving of his
right, he proceeds step by step. In the first place, he brings forward
the *Apostles* He then adds, “Nay, even *the brethren of the Lord*
themselves also make use of it without hesitation — nay more, Peter
himself, to whom the first place is assigned by consent of all, allows
himself the same liberty.” By *the brethren of the Lord*, he means John
and James, who *were accounted pillars*, as he states elsewhere. (<span
id="xvi.i-p48.1"></span>[Ga 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p48.1"></span>.) And, agreeably to what is customary in
Scripture, he gives the name of *brethren* to those who were connected
with Him by relationship.

<span id="xvi.i-p49"></span>Now, if any one should think to establish
Popery from this, he would act a ridiculous part. We confess that Peter
was acknowledged as first among the Apostles, as it is necessary that in
every society there should always be some one to preside over the
others, and they were of their own accord prepared to respect Peter for
the eminent endowments by which he was distinguished, as it is proper to
esteem and honor all that excel in the gifts of God’s grace. That
preeminence, however, was not lordship — nay more, it had nothing
resembling lordship. For while he was eminent among the others, still he
was subject to them as his colleagues. Farther, it is one thing to have
pre-eminence in one Church, and quite another, to claim for one’s self a
kingdom or dominion over the whole world. But indeed, even though we
should concede everything as to Peter, what has this to do with the
Pope? For as Matthias succeeded Judas, (<span
id="xvi.i-p49.1"></span>[Ac 1:26](../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p49.1"></span>,) so some Judas might succeed Peter. Nay more,
we see that during a period of more than nine hundred years among his
successors, or at least among those who boast that they are his
successors, there has not been one who was one whit better than Judas.
This, however, is not the *place* to treat of these points. Consult my
Institutes. (Volume 3.)

<span id="xvi.i-p50"></span>One thing farther must here be noticed, that
the Apostles had no horror of marriage, which the Papal clergy so much
abominate, as unbecoming the sanctity of their order. But it was after
their time that that admirable discovery was made, that the priests of
the Lord are polluted if they have intercourse with their lawful wives;
and, at length matters came to such a pitch, that Pope Syricius did not
hesitate to call marriage “*a pollution of the flesh*, in which no one
can please God.” What then must become of the poor Apostles, who
continued in that pollution until death? Here, however, they have
contrived a refined subtilty to effect their escape; for they say that
the Apostles gave up the use of the marriage bed, but *led about* their
wives with them, that they might receive the fruits of the gospel, or,
in other words, support at the public expense. As if they could not have
been maintained by the Churches, unless they wandered about from place
to place; and farther, as if it were a likely thing that they would run
hither and thither of their own accord, and without any necessity, in
order that they might live in idleness at the public expense! For as to
the explanation given by Ambrose, as referring to other persons’ wives,
who followed the Apostles for the purpose of hearing their doctrine, it
is exceedingly forced.

<span id="xvi.i-p51"></span><span id="xvi.i-p51.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p52"></span>**7.** *Who hath gone a warfare at his own
charges?* It is the present tense that is used  <span
id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) as meaning — is *accustomed to go* a
warfare. I have, however, with the view of taking off somewhat of the
harshness, rendered it in the preterite. Now, by *three* comparisons,
and these, too, taken from common life, he makes it out that it was
allowable for him to live, if he chose, at the public expense of the
Church, to show that he assumes nothing to himself but what human nature
itself teaches us is reasonable. The *first* is taken from military law,
for soldiers are wont to have their provisions furnished to them at the
public expense. The *second* is taken from vine-dressers, for the
husbandman plants a vine — not to throw away his pains, but to gather
the fruit. The *third* is taken from keepers of cattle, for the shepherd
does not lay out his labor for nothing, but *eats of the milk of the
flock* — that is, he is supported from the produce. As natural equity
points out this as reasonable, who will be so unjust as to refuse
sustenance to the pastors of the Church? While it may happen, that some
serve as soldiers at their own expense, as, for example, the Romans in
ancient times, when no tribute was as yet paid, and there were no taxes,
 <span id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) this does not militate against
Paul’s statement, for he simply takes his argument from common and
everywhere received practice.

<span id="xvi.i-p55"></span><span id="xvi.i-p55.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p56"></span>**8.** *Say I these things as a man*? Lest
any one should cavil, and say that in the things of the Lord the case is
different, and therefore that he had to no purpose brought forward so
many comparisons, he now adds, that the very same thing is commanded by
the Lord. To speak *as a man* sometimes means — speaking according to
the perverse judgment of the flesh, (as in <span
id="xvi.i-p56.1"></span>[Ro 3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p56.1"></span>.) Here, however, it means — bringing forward
only those things that are in common use among men, and are merely
current (as they speak) in a human court. Now, that God himself designed
that the labors of men should be remunerated by wages, he proves from
this, that he prohibits the *muzzling of the mouth of the ox that
treadeth out the corn;* and with the view of applying it to the subject
in hand, he says, that God was not *concerned* as to oxen, but rather
had regard to men.

<span id="xvi.i-p57"></span>In the first place, it may be asked, Why has
he more particularly selected this proof, while he had in the law
passages that were much clearer? as for example, <span
id="xvi.i-p57.2"></span>[De 24:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p57.2"></span>,

<span id="xvi.i-p58"></span>The wages of the hireling shall not remain
with thee over night.

<span id="xvi.i-p59"></span>If any one, however, will take a nearer
view, he will acknowledge that there is more force in this quotation, in
which the Lord requires cattle to be taken care of, for from this it is
inferred, from the less to the greater, how much equity he requires
among men, when he wishes that it should be shown to brute animals. When
he says, that *God does not take care for oxen*, you are not to
understand him as meaning to exclude oxen from the care of God’s
Providence, inasmuch as he does not overlook even the least sparrow.
(<span id="xvi.i-p59.1"></span>[Mt
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026.md)<span id="xvi.i-p59.1"></span>,
and <span id="xvi.i-p59.2"></span>[Mt
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029)<span id="xvi.i-p59.2"></span>..md)
Nor is it as if he meant to expound that precept allegorically, as some
hair-brained spirits take occasion from this to turn everything into
allegories. Thus they turn dogs into men, trees into angels, and turn
all scripture into a laughing-stock.

<span id="xvi.i-p60"></span>Paul’s meaning is simple — that, when the
Lord enjoins humanity to oxen, he does not do it for the sake of oxen,
but rather from a regard to men, on whose account, too, the very oxen
were created. That compassion, therefore, towards oxen should be a
stimulus to us to stir up to the exercise of humanity among us, as
Solomon says, (<span id="xvi.i-p60.1"></span>[Pr
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#010)<span id="xvi.i-p60.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="xvi.i-p61"></span>The righteous man hath a care over his
beast,  
but the bowels of the wicked are cruel.

<span id="xvi.i-p62"></span>Let it then be understood by you, that God
is not *so* concerned for oxen, as to have had merely a regard to oxen
in making that law, for he had mankind in view, and wished to accustom
them to equity, that they might not defraud the workman of his hire. For
it is not the ox that has the principal part in plowing or treading out
the corn, but man, by whose industry the ox himself is set to work.
Hence, what he immediately adds — He *that ploweth, should plow in
hope*, etc. is an exposition of the precept, as if he had said, that it
extends generally to any kind of recompense for labor.

<span id="xvi.i-p63"></span><span id="xvi.i-p63.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p64"></span>**10.** *Because he that ploweth ought to
plow in hope.* There is a twofold reading in this passage, even in the
Greek manuscripts, but the one that is more generally received is — *He
that thrasheth*, *in hope of partaking of his hope* At the same time,
the one that does not repeat the term *hope* twice in the second clause
appears simpler, and more natural.  <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) Hence, if I were at liberty to choose,
I would prefer to read it thus: *He that ploweth should plow in hope*,
*and he that thrasheth in hope of participating* As, however, the most
of the Greek manuscripts agree in the former reading, and as the meaning
remains the same, I have not ventured to make change upon it. Now he
expounds the preceding injunction, and hence he says, that it is an
unjust thing that the husbandman should lay out his pains to no purpose
in plowing and thrashing, but that the end of his labor is the hope of
receiving the fruits. As it is so, we may infer, that this belongs to
oxen also, but Paul’s intention was to extend it farther, and apply it
principally to men. Now, the husbandman is said to be *a partaker of his
hope*, when he enjoys the produce which he has obtained when reaping,
but hoped for when plowing.

<span id="xvi.i-p66"></span><span id="xvi.i-p66.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p67"></span>**11.** *If we have sown unto you spiritual
things* There was one cavil remaining — for it might be objected, that
labors connected with this life should without doubt have food and
clothing as their reward; and that plowing and thrashing yield fruit, of
which those that labor in these things are partakers; but that it is
otherwise with the gospel, because its fruit is spiritual; and hence the
minister of the word, if he would receive fruit corresponding to his
labor, ought to demand nothing that is carnal. Lest any one, therefore,
should cavil in this manner, he argues from the greater to the less.
“Though food and clothing are not of the same nature with a minister’s
labors, what injury do you sustain, if you recompense what is
inestimable with a thing that is small and contemptible? For in
proportion to the superiority of the soul above the body, does the word
of the Lord excel outward sustenance,  <span
id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) inasmuch as it is the food of the
soul.”

<span id="xvi.i-p69"></span><span id="xvi.i-p69.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p70"></span>**12.** *If others assume this power over
you* Again he establishes his own right from the example of others. For
why should he alone be denied what others assumed as their due? For as
no one labored more than he among the Corinthians, no one was more
deserving of a reward. He does not, however, make mention of what he has
done, but of what he would have done in accordance with his right, if he
had not of his own accord refrained from using it.

<span id="xvi.i-p71"></span>*But we have not used this power.* He
returns now to the point on which the matter hinges — that he had of his
own accord given up that power which no one could refuse him, and that
he was prepared rather *to suffer all things,* than by the use of his
liberty throw any impediment in the way of the progress of the gospel.
He wishes, therefore, that the Corinthians should, after his example,
keep this end in view — to do nothing that would hinder or retard the
progress of the gospel; for what he declares respecting himself it was
their duty to perform according to their station; and he confirms here
what he had said previously — that we must consider what is *expedient*
(<span id="xvi.i-p71.1"></span>[1Co

unto me: for *it were* better for me to die, than that any man should
make my glorying void.

<span id="xvi.ii-p8"></span>**15.** Ego autem nullo horum usus sum:
neque vero haec scripsi, ut ita mihi fiat: mihi enim satius est mori,
quam ut gloriam meam quis exinaniat.

<span id="xvi.ii-p9"></span>**16.** For though I preach the gospel, I
have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is
unto me, iflpreach not the gospel!

<span id="xvi.ii-p10"></span>**16.** Nam si evangelizavero, non est quod

<span id="xvi.ii-p11"></span>**17.** For if I do this thing willingly, I
have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation *of the gospel* is
committed unto me.

<span id="xvi.ii-p13"></span>**18.** What is my reward then? *Verily*
that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without
charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.

<span id="xvi.ii-p14"></span>**18.** Quae igitur mihi merces? ut quum

<span id="xvi.ii-p24"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p25"></span>**13.** *Know ye not,* Apart from the
question that he discusses, he appears to have dwelt the longer in
taking notice of this point, with the view of reproaching the
Corinthians indirectly for their malignity in allowing the ministers of
Christ to be reviled in a matter that was so justifiable. For if Paul
had not of his own accord refrained from using his liberty, there was a
risk of the progress of the gospel being obstructed. Never would the
false Apostles have gained that point, had not ingratitude, to which the
Corinthians were already prone, opened up the way for their calumnies.
For they ought to have repelled them sharply; but instead of this they
showed themselves excessively credulous, so that they would have been
prepared to reject the gospel, if Paul had used his right. Such contempt
of the gospel, and such cruelty towards their Apostle, deserved to be
more severely reproved; but Paul, having found another occasion, touches
upon it indirectly and mildly, with his usual modesty, that he may
admonish them without affronting them.

<span id="xvi.ii-p26"></span>Again he makes use of a new comparison, to
prove that he had not used the power that he had from the Lord. Nor does
he any longer borrow examples from any other source, but shows that this
has been appointed by the Lord — that the Churches should provide for
the support of their ministers. There are some that think that there are
*two* comparisons in this passage, and they refer the *former* to the
Lord’s priests, and the *latter* to those that acted as priests to the
heathen gods. I am, however, rather of opinion that Paul expresses, as
he is accustomed, the same thing by different terms. And, truly, it
would have been a weak argument that was derived from the practice of
the heathens, among whom the revenues of the priesthood were not devoted
to food and clothing, but to magnificent dresses, royal splendor, and
profuse luxury. These would, therefore, have been things too remote. I
do not call it in question, however, that he has pointed out different
kinds of ministerial offices; for there were priests of a higher order,
and there were afterwards Levites, who were inferior to them, as is well
known; but that is not much to the point.

<span id="xvi.ii-p27"></span>The sum is this — “The Levitical priests
were ministers of the Israelitish Church; the Lord appointed *them*
sustenance from their ministry; hence in ministers of the Christian
Church the same equity must be observed at the present day. Now the
ministers of the Christian Church are those that preach the gospel.”
This passage is quoted by Canonists, when they wish to prove that idle
bellies must be fattened up, in order that they may perform their
masses;  <span id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) but how absurdly, I
leave it to children themselves to judge. Whatever is stated in the
Scriptures as to the support to be given to ministers, or the honor that
is to be put upon them, they immediately seize hold of it, and twist it
to their own advantage. For my part, however, I simply admonish my
readers to consider attentively Paul’s words. He argues that pastors,
who labor in the preaching of the gospel, ought to be supported, because
the Lord in ancient times appointed sustenance for the priests, on the
ground of their serving the Church. Hence a distinction must be made
between the ancient priesthood and that of the present day. Priests
under the law were set apart to preside over the sacrifices, to serve
the altar, and to take care of the tabernacle and temple. Those at the
present day are set apart to preach the word and to dispense the
sacraments. The Lord has appointed no sacrifices for his sacred
ministers to be engaged in;  <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md)
there are no altars for them to stand at to offer sacrifices.

<span id="xvi.ii-p30"></span>Hence appears the absurdity of those who
apply this comparison, taken from sacrifices, to anything else than to
the preaching of the gospel. Nay farther, it may be readily inferred
from this passage, that all Popish priests, from the head himself to the
lowest member, are guilty of sacrilege, who devour the revenues
appointed for true ministers, while they do not in any way discharge
their duty. For what ministers does the Apostle order to be maintained?
Those that apply themselves to the preaching of the gospel. What right
then have *they* to claim for themselves the revenues of the priesthood?
 <span id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) “Because they hum a tune and
perform mass.”  <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) But God has
enjoined upon them nothing of that sort. Hence it is evident that they
seize upon the reward due to others. When, however, he says that the
Levitical priests were *partakers with the altar*, and that they ate of
the things of *the Temple*, he marks out (<span
id="xvi.ii-p32.2"></span>μετωνυμικῶς) by *metonymy*, the offerings that
were presented to God. For they claimed to themselves the sacred victims
entire, and of smaller animals they took the right shoulder, and kidneys
and tail, and, besides this, tithes, oblations, and first-fruits. The
word <span id="xvi.ii-p32.3"></span>ἱερόν, therefore, in the *second*
instance,  <span id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) is taken to mean *the
Temple.*

<span id="xvi.ii-p34"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p35"></span>**15.** *Nor have I written these things*
As he might seem to be making it his aim, that in future a remuneration
should be given him by the Corinthians, he removes that suspicion, and
declares that, so far from this being his desire, *he would rather die*
than give occasion for his being deprived of this ground of glorying —
that he bestowed labor upon the Corinthians without any reward. Nor is
it to be wondered that he set so high a value upon this glorying,
inasmuch as he saw that the authority of the gospel in some degree
depended upon it. For he would in this way have given a handle to the
false apostles to triumph over him. Hence there was a danger, lest the
Corinthians, despising him, should receive them with great applause. So
much did he prefer, even before his own life, the power of advancing the
gospel.

<span id="xvi.ii-p36"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p37"></span>**16.** *For if I preach the gospel.* To
show how very important it was not to deprive himself of that ground of
glorying, he intimates what would have happened, if he had simply
discharged his ministry — that he would in this way have done nothing
else than what the Lord had enjoined upon him by a strict *necessity* By
doing *that*, he says, he would have had no occasion for glorying, as it
was not in his power to avoid doing it.  <span
id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) It is asked, however, what *glorying*
he here refers to, for he glories elsewhere in his *exercising* himself
in the office of teaching *with a pure conscience* (<span
id="xvi.ii-p38.2"></span>[2Ti 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003.md)<span
id="xvi.ii-p38.2"></span>.) I answer, that he speaks of a glorying that
he could bring forward in opposition to the false apostles, when they
endeavored to find a pretext for reviling, as will appear more fully
from what follows.

<span id="xvi.ii-p39"></span>This is a remarkable statement, from which
we learn, in the first place, what, as to ministers, is the nature, and
what the closeness of the tie that is involved in their calling, and
farther, what the pastoral office imports and includes. Let not the man,
then, who has been once *called* to it, imagine that he is any longer at
liberty to withdraw when he chooses, if, perhaps, he is harassed with
vexatious occurrences, or weighed down with misfortunes, for he is
devoted to the Lord and to the Church, and bound by a sacred tie, which
it were criminal to break asunder. As to the *second* point,  <span
id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) he says that a curse was ready to fall
upon him, *if he did not preach the gospel* Why? Because he has been
called to it, and therefore is constrained by *necessity* How,
therefore, will any one who succeeds to his office avoid this
*necessity*? What sort of successors, then, have the Apostles in the
Pope and the other mitred bishops, who think that there is nothing that
is more unbecoming their station, than the duty of teaching!

<span id="xvi.ii-p41"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p41.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p42"></span>**17.** *For if I do this thing willingly*
By *reward* here is meant what the Latins term <span
id="xvi.ii-p42.1"></span>*operae pretium*, recompense for labor,  <span
id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) and what he had previously termed
*glorying* Others, however, interpret it otherwise — as meaning that a
*reward* is set before all who discharge their duty faithfully and
heartily. But, for my part, I understand the man who *does this thing
willingly,* to be the man who acts with such cheerfulness, that, being
intent upon edifying, as his one object of desire, he declines nothing
that he knows will be profitable to the Church; as, on the other hand,
he terms those *unwilling*, who in their actings submit, indeed, to
necessity, but act grudgingly, because it is not from inclination. For
it always happens that the man who undertakes any business with zeal, is
also prepared of his own accord to submit to everything, which, if left
undone, would hinder the accomplishment of the work. Thus Paul, being
one that acted *willingly*, did not teach in a mere perfunctory manner,
but left nothing undone that he knew to be fitted to promote and further
his doctrine. *This* then was his *recompense for labor*,  <span
id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) and *this* his ground of g*lorying* —
that he did with readiness of mind forego his right in respect of his
applying himself to the discharge of his office willingly and with
fervent zeal.

<span id="xvi.ii-p45"></span>*But if unwillingly, a dispensation is
committed to me.* In whatever way others explain these words, the
natural meaning, in my opinion, is this — that God does not by any means
approve of the service done by the man who performs it grudgingly, and,
as it were, with a reluctant mind. Whenever, therefore, God has enjoined
anything upon us, we are mistaken, if we think that we have discharged
it aright, when we perform it *grudgingly*; for the Lord requires that
his servants be *cheerful*, (<span id="xvi.ii-p45.1"></span>[2Co
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007)<span id="xvi.ii-p45.1"></span>,.md)
so as to delight in obeying him, and manifest their cheerfulness by the
promptitude with which they act. In short, Paul means, that he would act
in accordance with his calling, only in the event of his performing his
duty willingly and cheerfully.

<span id="xvi.ii-p46"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p46.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p47"></span>**18.** *What then is my reward?* He infers
from what goes before, that he has a ground of glorying; in this, that
he labored gratuitously in behalf of the Corinthians, because it appears
from this, that he applied himself willingly to the office of teaching,
inasmuch as he vigorously set himself to obviate all the hindrances in
the way of the gospel; and not satisfied with merely teaching,
endeavored to further the doctrine of it by every method. This then is
the sum. “I am under the necessity of preaching the gospel: if I do it
not, wo is unto me, for I resist God’s calling. But it is not enough to
preach, unless I do it willingly; for he who fulfils the commandment of
God unwillingly, does not act, as becomes him, suitably to his office.
But if I obey God willingly, it will in that case be allowable for me to
glory. Hence it was necessary for me to make the gospel *without
charge*, that I might glory on good ground.”

<span id="xvi.ii-p48"></span>Papists endeavor from this passage to
establish their contrivance as to works of *supererogation*.  <span
id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) “Paul,” they say, “would have
fulfilled the duties of his office by preaching the gospel, but he adds
something farther over and above. Hence he does something beyond what he
is bound to do, for he distinguishes between what is done willingly and
what is done from necessity.” I answer, that Paul, it is true, went a
greater length than the ordinary calling of pastors required, because he
refrained from taking pay, which the Lord allows pastors to take. But as
it was a part of his duty to provide against every occasion of offense
that he foresaw, and as he saw, that the course of the gospel would be
impeded, if he made use of his liberty, though that was out of the
ordinary course, yet I maintain that even in that case he rendered to
God nothing more than was due. For I ask: “Is it not the part of a good
pastor to remove occasions of offense, so far as it is in his power to
do so?” I ask again, “Did Paul do anything else than this?” There is no
ground, therefore, for imagining that he rendered to God anything that
he did not owe to him, inasmuch as he did nothing but what the necessity
of his office (though it was an extraordinary necessity) demanded. Away,
then, with that wicked imagination,  <span
id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) that we compensate for our faults in
the sight of God by works of *supererogation*.  <span
id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md) Nay more, away with the very term,
which is replete with diabolical pride.  <span
id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md) This passage, assuredly, is mistakenly
perverted to bear that meaning.

<span id="xvi.ii-p53"></span>The error of Papists is refuted in a
general way in this manner: Whatever works are comprehended under the
law, are falsely termed works of *supererogation*, as is manifest from
the words of Christ. (<span id="xvi.ii-p53.1"></span>[Lu
17:10](../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010)<span id="xvi.ii-p53.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xvi.ii-p54"></span>When ye have done all things that are
commanded you, say,  
We are unprofitable servants: we have done what we were bound to do.

<span id="xvi.ii-p55"></span>Now we acknowledge that no work is good and
acceptable to God, that is not included in God’s law. This *second*
statement I prove in this way: There are two classes of good works; for
they are all reducible either to the service of God or to love. Now
nothing belongs to *the service of God* that is not included in this
summary: *Thou shalt love the Lord with all thy heart, with all thy
soul, with all thy strength* There is also no duty of *love* that is not
required in that precept — *Love thy neighbor as thyself* (<span
id="xvi.ii-p55.1"></span>[Mark 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030.md),
[31](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#031)<span id="xvi.ii-p55.1"></span>..md)
But as to the objection that is brought forward by Papists, that it is
possible for one to be acceptable, if he devotes the *tenth* part of his
income, and infer from this, that if he goes so far as to devote the
*fifth* part, he does a work of *supererogation*, it is easy to remove
away this subtilty. For that the deeds of the pious are approved, is not
by any means owing to their perfection, but it is because the
imperfection and deficiency are not reckoned to their account. Hence
even if they were doing an hundred-fold more than they do, they would
not, even in that case, exceed the limits of the duty that they owe.

<span id="xvi.ii-p56"></span>*That I may not abuse my power.* From this
it appears, that such a use of our liberty as gives occasion of offense,
is an uncontrolled liberty and abuse. We must keep, therefore, within
bounds, that we may not give occasion of offense. This passage also
confirms more fully what I just now touched upon, that Paul did nothing
beyond what the duty of his office required, because it was not proper
that the liberty, that was allowed him by God, should be in any way
abused.

<span id="xvi.ii-p57"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p57.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p58"></span>**19.** *Though I was free from all.* <span
id="xvi.ii-p58.1"></span>Εκ πάντων, that is, *from all*, may be taken
either in the neuter gender or in the masculine. If in the neuter, it
will refer to *things*; if in the masculine, to *persons* I prefer the
*second* He has as yet shown only by one particular instance how
carefully he had accommodated himself to the weak. Now he subjoins a
general statement, and afterwards enumerates several instances. The
*general* observation is this — that while he was not under the power of
any one, he lived as if he had been subject to the inclination of all,
and of his own accord subjected himself to *the weak*, to whom he was
under no subjection. The *particular* instances are these — that among
the Gentiles he lived as if he were a Gentile, and among the Jews he
acted as a Jew: that is, while among Jews he carefully observed the
ceremonies of the law, he was no less careful not to give occasion of
offense to the Gentiles by the observance of them.

<span id="xvi.ii-p59"></span>He adds the particle *as*, to intimate that
his liberty was not at all impaired on that account, for, however he
might accommodate himself to men, he nevertheless remained always like
himself inwardly in the sight of God. To *become all things* is to
assume all appearances, as the case *may* require, or to put on
different characters, according to the diversity among individuals. As
to what he says respecting his *being without law* and *under the law*,
you must understand it simply in reference to the ceremonial department;
for the department connected with morals was common to Jews and Gentiles
alike, and it would not have been allowable for Paul to gratify men to
that extent. For this doctrine holds good only as to things indifferent,
as has been previously remarked.

<span id="xvi.ii-p60"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p60.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p61"></span>**21.** *Though not without law to God.* He
wished by this parenthesis to soften the harshness of the expression,
for it might. have seemed harsh at first view to have it said, that he
*had come to be without law.* Hence in order that this might not be
taken in a wrong sense, he had added, by way of correction, that he had
always kept in view one law — that of subjection to Christ. By this too
he hints that odium was excited against him groundlessly and
unreasonably, as if he called men to an unbridled licentiousness, while
he taught exemption from the bondage of the Mosaic law. Now he calls it
expressly *the law of Christ*, in order to wipe away the groundless
reproach, with which the false apostles branded the gospel, for he
means, that in the doctrine of Christ nothing is omitted, that might
serve to give us a perfect rule of upright. living.

<span id="xvi.ii-p62"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p62.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p63"></span>**22.** *To the weak I became as weak* Now
again he employs a general statement, in which he shows to what sort of
persons he accomodated himself, and with what design. He judaized in the
presence of the Jews, but not before them all, for there were many
headstrong persons, who, under the influence of Pharisaical pride or
malice, would have wished that Christian liberty were altogether taken
away. To those persons he would never have been so accommodating, for
Christ would not have us care for persons of that sort.

<span id="xvi.ii-p64"></span>Let them alone, (says he,) they are blind,
and leaders of the blind. (<span id="xvi.ii-p64.1"></span>[Mt
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#014)<span id="xvi.ii-p64.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xvi.ii-p65"></span>Hence we must accommodate ourselves to the
weak, not to the obstinate.  <span id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md)

<span id="xvi.ii-p67"></span>Now his *design* was, that he might bring
them to Christ — not that he might promote his own advantage, or retain
their good will. To these things a *third* must be added — that it was
only in things indifferent, that are otherwise in our choice, that he
accommodated himself to the weak. Now, if we consider how great a man
Paul was, who stooped thus far, ought we not to feel ashamed — we who
are next to nothing in comparison with him — if, bound up in self, we
look with disdain upon the weak, and do not deign to yield up a single
point to them? But while it is proper that we should accommodate
ourselves to the weak, according to the Apostle’s injunction, and that,
in things indifferent, and with a view to their edification, those act
an improper part, who, with the view of consulting their own ease, avoid
those things that would offend men, and the wicked, too, rather than the
weak. Those, however, commit a two-fold error, who do not distinguish
between things indifferent and things unlawful, and accordingly do not
hesitate, for the sake of pleasing men, to engage in things that the
Lord has prohibited. The crowning point, however, of the evil is this —
that they abuse this statement of Paul to excuse their wicked
dissimulation. But if any one will keep in view these three things that
I have briefly pointed out, he will have it easily in his power to
refute those persons.

<span id="xvi.ii-p68"></span>We must observe, also, the word that he
makes use of in the concluding clause;  <span
id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) for he shows for what purpose he
endeavors to *gain* all — with a view to their salvation. At the same
time, he here at length modifies the general statement, unless perhaps
you prefer the rendering of the old translation, which is found even at
this day in some Greek manuscripts.  <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md) For in this place, too, he repeats it
— *that I may by all means save some*  <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) But as the indulgent temper, that Paul
speaks of, has sometimes no good effect, this limitation is very
suitable — that, although he might not do good to all, he, nevertheless,
had never left off consulting the advantage of at least a few.  <span

<span id="xvi.iii-p12"></span>**27.** Verum subigo corpus meum, et in
servitutem redigo, ne quo modo fiat, ut, quum aliis praedicaverim, ipse
reprobus  <span id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) efficiar.

<span id="xvi.iii-p14"></span> 

<span id="xvi.iii-p15"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p16"></span>**23.** *That I may become a partaker of
it.* As the Corinthians might think with themselves, that this was a
peculiarity in Paul’s case on the ground of his office, he argues, from
the very design of it, that this is common to all Christians. For when
he declares, that his aim had been, that he *might become a partaker of
the gospel*, he indirectly intimates, that all who do not act the same
part with him are unworthy of the fellowship of the gospel. To *become a
partaker of the gospel* is to receive the fruit of it.

<span id="xvi.iii-p17"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p18"></span>**24.** *Know ye not, that they who run in
a race.* He has laid down the doctrine, and now, with the view of
impressing it upon the minds of the Corinthians, he adds an exhortation.
He states briefly, that what they had hitherto attained was nothing,
unless they steadfastly persevered, inasmuch as it is not enough to have
once entered on the Lord’s way, if they do not strive until they reach
the goal, agreeably to that declaration of Christ — *He* *that shall
endure unto the end*, etc. (<span id="xvi.iii-p18.1"></span>[Mt
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#022.md)<span
id="xvi.iii-p18.1"></span>.) Now he borrows a similitude from the
race-course.  <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507.md) For as in that
case many descend into the arena, but he alone is crowned who has first
reached the goal, so there is no reason why any one should feel
satisfied with himself on the ground of his having once entered upon the
race prescribed in the gospel, unless he persevere in it until death.
There is, however, this difference between our contest and theirs, that
among them only *one* is victorious, and obtains the palm — the man who
has got before all the others;  <span id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md)
but our condition is superior in this respect, that there may be *many*
at the same time.  <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) For God
requires from us nothing more than that we press on vigorously until we
reach the goal.  <span id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) Thus one does
not hinder another: nay more, those who run in the Christian race are
mutually helpful to each other. He expresses the same sentiment in
another form in <span id="xvi.iii-p22.2"></span>[2Ti
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005.md)<span id="xvi.iii-p22.2"></span>,

<span id="xvi.iii-p23"></span>If any one striveth, he is not crowned,
unless he strives lawfully.

<span id="xvi.iii-p24"></span>*So run.* Here we have the application of
the similitude — that it is not enough to have set out, if we do not
continue to run during our whole life. For our life is like a
race-course. We must not therefore become wearied after a short time,
like one that stops short in the middle of the race-course, but instead
of this, death alone must put a period to our running. The particle
<span id="xvi.iii-p24.1"></span>ὅυτω, (*so*,) may be taken in two ways.
Chrysostom connects it with what goes before, in this manner: as those
who run do not stop running until they have reached the goal, so do ye
also persevere, and do not stop running so long as you live. It will,
however, correspond not inaptly with what follows. “You must not run
*so* as to stop short in the middle of the race-course, but *so* as to
obtain the prize.” As to the term *stadium*, (*race-course*,) and the
different kinds of races,  <span id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) I say
nothing, as these things may be obtained from grammarians, and it is
generally known that there were some races on horseback, and others on
foot. Nor are these things particularly needed for understanding Paul’s
meaning.

<span id="xvi.iii-p26"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p27"></span>**25.** *Now every one that striveth.* As
he had exhorted to perseverance, it remained to state in what way they
must persevere. This *second* thing he now sets before them by a
comparison taken from pugilists; not indeed in every particular,  <span
id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) but in so far as was required by the
subject in hand, within which he confines himself — how far they ought
to yield to the weakness of the brethren. Now he argues from the less to
the greater, that it is an unseemly thing if we grudge to give up our
right, inasmuch as the pugilists eating their coliphium,  <span
id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md) and that sparingly and not to the
full, voluntarily deny themselves every delicacy, in order that they may
have more agility for the combat, and they do this, too, for the sake of
*a corruptible crown* But if they value so highly a crown of leaves that
quickly fades, what value ought we to set upon a crown of immortality?
Let us not, therefore, think it hard to give up a little of our right.
It is well known that wrestlers were contented with the most frugal
diet, so that their simple fare has become proverbial.

<span id="xvi.iii-p30"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p31"></span>**26.** *I therefore so run* He returns to
speak of himself, that his doctrine may have the more weight, on his
setting himself forward by way of pattern. What. he says here some refer
to *assurance of hope* — (<span id="xvi.iii-p31.1"></span>[Heb
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#011)<span id="xvi.iii-p31.1"></span>.md)
— “I do not run in vain, nor do I run the risk of losing my labor, for I
have the Lord’s promise, which never deceives.” It rather appears to me,
however, that his object is to direct the course of believers straight
forward toward the goal, that it may not be wavering and devious. “The
Lord exercises us here in the way of running and wrestling, but he sets
before us the object at which we ought to aim, and prescribes a sure
rule for our wrestling, that we may not weary ourselves in vain.” Now he
takes in both the similitudes that he had employed. “I know,” says he,
“*whither* I am running, and, like a skillful wrestler, I am anxious
that I may not miss my aim.” Those things ought to kindle up and confirm
the Christian breast, so as to devote itself with greater alacrity to
all the duties of piety;  <span id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) for it
is a great matter not to wander in ignorance through uncertain windings.

<span id="xvi.iii-p33"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p34"></span>**27.** *But I keep under my body*  <span
id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) Budaeus reads <span
id="xvi.iii-p35.2"></span>*Observo*; (*I keep a watch over*;) but in my
opinion the Apostle has employed the word <span
id="xvi.iii-p35.3"></span>ὑπωπιάζειν  <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) here, to mean *treating in a servile
manner*  <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md) For he declares that he
does not indulge self, but restrains his inclinations — which cannot be
accomplished unless the body is tamed, and, by being held back from its
inclinations, is habituated to subjection, like a wild and refractory
steed. The ancient monks, with a view to yield obedience to this precept
contrived many exercises of discipline, for they slept on benches, they
forced themselves to long watchings, and shunned delicacies. The main
thing, however, was wanting in them, for they did not apprehend why it
was that the Apostle enjoins this, because they lost sight of another
injunction —

<span id="xvi.iii-p38"></span>to take no concern for our flesh to
fulfill the lusts thereof.  
(<span id="xvi.iii-p38.2"></span>[Ro
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014.md)<span
id="xvi.iii-p38.2"></span>.)

<span id="xvi.iii-p39"></span>For what he says elsewhere (<span
id="xvi.iii-p39.1"></span>[1Ti
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008)<span id="xvi.iii-p39.1"></span>.md)
always holds good — that *bodily exercise profiteth little*. Let us,
however, treat the body so as to make a slave of it,  <span
id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md) that it may not, by its wantonness,
keep us back from the duties of piety; and farther, that we may not
indulge it, so as to occasion injury, or offense, to others.

<span id="xvi.iii-p41"></span>*That, when I have preached to others*
Some explain these words in this way — “Lest, after having taught others
with propriety and faithfulness, I should incur the judgment of
condemnation in the sight of God by a wicked life.” But it will suit
better to view this expression as referring to men, in this way — “My
life ought to be a kind of rule to others. Accordingly, I strive to
conduct myself in such a manner, that my character and conduct may not
be inconsistent with my doctrine, and that thus I may not, with great
disgrace to myself, and a grievous occasion of offense to my brethren,
neglect those things which I require from others.” It may also be taken
in connection with a preceding statement, (<span
id="xvi.iii-p41.1"></span>[1Co
9:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#023)<span id="xvi.iii-p41.1"></span>,.md)
in this way — “Lest I should be defrauded of the gospel, of which others
are partakers through means of my labors.”

<span id="xvi.ii-p43"></span> “<span id="xvi.ii-p43.1"></span>Ce que

idiomatic phrase, <span id="xvi.ii-p43.2"></span>*operae pretium*, is
ordinarily employed by the classical writers to mean — something *of
importance*, or *worthwhile*. Thus *Livy*, in his Preface, says: “<span
id="xvi.ii-p43.3"></span>facturusne operae pretium sim;” — “whether I am
about to do a work of importance,” and *Cicero* (Cat. 4. 8) says: “<span
id="xvi.ii-p43.4"></span>Operae pretium est;” — “It is *worth while*.”
Calvin, however, seems to make use of the phrase here in a sense more
nearly akin to its original and literal signification — *recompense for
labor* — *what* amply rewarded the self-denial that he had exercised —
consisting in the peculiar satisfaction afforded to his mind in
reflecting on the part that he had acted. The term made use of by him in
his French Translation — <span
id="xvi.ii-p43.5"></span>*chef-d*’*oeuure* (*masterpiece*) corresponds
with the Latin phrase <span id="xvi.ii-p43.6"></span>*operae pretium* in

artist, or workman, sets a *value* upon, and in which he feels
*satisfaction*, as *amply recompensing* the pains bestowed. — *Ed*.
