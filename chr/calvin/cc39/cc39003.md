<span id="iv"></span>

<span id="iv-p1"></span>A COMMENTARY

<span id="iv-p2"></span>UPON SAINT PAUL’S

<span id="iv-p3"></span>EPISTLES TO THE CORINTHIANS

<span id="iv-p4"></span>WRITTEN BY *M* *JOHN CALVIN*;

<span id="iv-p5"></span>And translated out of Latin into English, by

<span id="iv-p6"></span>Thomas Timme, Minister.

<span id="iv-p7"></span>Imprinted at London, for

<span id="iv-p8"></span>*John Harifon and George Byfhop*.

<span id="iv-p9"></span>1573.

<span id="iv-p10"></span>**To the Most Reverend Father  
in God, and His Singuler Good Lord, Edmond,  
by the Grace of God, Archbishop of Canterburie**,  
<span id="iv-p10.4"></span>Primate and Metropolitiane of all England**,
Thomas Timme  
**<span id="iv-p10.6"></span>wisheth the plentifull riches of the
Spirite**,** <span id="iv-p10.7"></span>  
in Christ Iesu

<span id="iv-p11"></span>After long exercise in translating such Latine
Commentaries uppon the holy Scriptures, as I though most like to further
my country men, which understand not that tongue, to the soud knowledg
of true Religion: at last I tooke in hand M. Caluin’s exposition upon
Saint Paul’s Epistles to the Corinthias. And, as in my poor judgment,
the writer is a most excellent instrument of God, for the simple setting
foorth of his trueth, so in making my choyse (most reverend Father) I
could not devise with my selfe, a more fyt personage, to whom I might
dedicate his trauayle, by my willing paynes translated, than to your
Grace: So much the rather, for that as your selfe can skillfully iudge,
so they, for whom I have taken this labor upon me, by your allowance
(whereon they may and will rest) shalbe the more encouraged to lyke, and
with greater diligence to reade, and to take the profite ment them
thereby. And although my part herein by the least, and in respect
thereof, unwoorthye to be presented to your hands, your worthines in
eche condition considered: yet calling to mynde the benefites, which
long ago in Cambridge, and els where since, I haue receyued by your
Graces preferment: I thought it better nowe at the last, to aduenture
the offer of this simple gift, being such as I haue, than utterly to
shewe myself unthankeful for that I have receyued. Most humbly therefore
beseeching your Grace, that as heretofore it hath pleased you to
encourage me in this exercise, by licensing the first booke which I
translated to passe the Englishe presse, so now you will vouchsafe to
take in good part M. Caluin’s present, offered you by me. I ceasse to
trouble you further, recommending your Grace, and all your godly
affayres to almighty God, whom I heartely beseeche to direct in all
heauenly wisdome, grace, and knowledge, now and euer.

<span id="iv-p12"></span>Your Graces most humble at all tymes,  
to commaunde, Thomas Tymme.
