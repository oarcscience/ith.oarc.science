<span id="vi-p1"></span>THE AUTHOR’S  
SECOND EPISTLE DEDICATORY

<span id="vi-p2"></span>TO LORD GALLIAZUS CARACCIOLUS:

<span id="vi-p3"></span>*A Nobleman, Distinguished Still More By Eminent
Virtues Than By Illustrious Descent, Only Son And Rightful Heir Of The
Marquis Of Vico, Health:* —

<span id="vi-p4"></span>Would that when this Commentary first saw the
light, I had either not known at all, or else had known thoroughly the
individual whose name, hitherto inscribed upon this page, I am now under
the necessity of erasing! I have, it is true, no fear of his upbraiding
me with fickleness, or complaining that I have taken from him what I had
previously given, for having intentionally made it his object, not
merely to withdraw as much as possible from me personally, but also to
have no connection with our Church, he has left himself no just ground
of complaint. It is, however, with reluctance that I deviate from my
custom, so as to erase any one’s name from my writings, and it grieves
me that that individual should have quitted the lofty eminence that I
had assigned him,  <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) so as not to
hold out a light to others, as it was my desire that he should.  <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) As, however, it is not in my power to
remedy this evil, let him, so far as I am concerned, remain buried, as I
am desirous even now of sparing his credit by not mentioning his name.

<span id="vi-p7"></span>To you, however, most illustrious Sir, I should
have had to look out for some apology, for now putting you in his place,
did I not freely take this liberty, from the confidence that I have in
your incredible kindness of disposition, and your affection towards me
personally, which is well known to all our friends. To return again to
wishes, would that I had known you ten years sooner, for I should not
have had occasion at present for making any change. So far as an example
to the Church generally is concerned, it is a fortunate circumstance;
because there will not only be no loss incurred by burying in oblivion
the individual who has withdrawn from us, but in place of him we shall
have in you a compensation  <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) much
more abundant and every way superior. For although you do not court
public applause — satisfied to have God alone as your witness — and
though it is not my design to herald your praises, yet it were not
proper to conceal altogether from my readers what is useful and
profitable to be known: — that a man, sprung from a family of the first
rank,  <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) prosperous in honors and
wealth, blest with a spouse of the noblest descent and strictest virtue,
a numerous offspring, domestic quiet and harmony, and happy in his
entire condition in life, has, of his own accord, with the view of
joining the camp of Christ, quitted his native country, has left behind
him a fertile and lovely domain, a splendid patrimony, and a residence
not less commodious than delightful, has stript himself of domestic
splendor, has left father, wife, children, relatives, and connections,
and after bidding farewell to so many worldly allurements, satisfied
with our mean style, adopts our frugal and homely way of living, just as
if he were one of ourselves.  <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) I
make mention, however, of these things to others, in such a way as not
to overlook at the same time my own individual advantage; for if I hold
up here, as in a mirror, your virtues before the eyes of my readers, in
order that they may set themselves to imitate them, it were a shame if
I, who have a nearer view of them, were not more keenly affected by a
daily and distinct contemplation of them. As, however, I for my part
know by experience the tendency of your example to strengthen my faith
and piety, and all the children of God that live here acknowledge, as I
do, that they have derived from this source no ordinary advantage, I
have thought that it might be of importance, that, by my publishing it,
the like benefit were made to flow out to a still greater distance. But
for this,  <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) it were utter folly to
expatiate in the praises of a man, whose nature and disposition are at
the farthest distance possible from ostentation, and that, too, before
persons who are in foreign and far distant regions. Hence, if any
considerable number to whom, in consequence of distance, you have been
hitherto unknown, shall, on this admirable example being presented to
them, prepare to imitate it, by leaving the nests to which they too
fondly cling, I shall have obtained an ample reward for what I have
written.

<span id="vi-p12"></span>It ought, indeed, to have been more than simply
common and customary among Christians, not simply to leave contentedly
behind them estates, castles, and princely domains, where Christ cannot
be followed otherwise, but even cheerfully and willingly to despise, in
comparison with Him, everything that is most valued under heaven.  <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) Such, however, is the backwardness or
rather indifference that pervades all of us, that, while many give a
cold assent  <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) to the doctrine of the
gospel, scarcely one in a hundred will, for the sake of it, if he
possesses the most insignificant little farm, allow himself to be torn
from it. Scarcely one is induced, without the greatest difficulty, to
renounce the smallest conveniences: so very far are they from being
prepared to abandon, as were befitting, life itself.  <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) Above all things, I should wish that all
resembled you in that first of all excellences — self-denial. For you
are well prepared to bear witness to me, and I in like manner to you,
how little pleasure we feel in cultivating the society of those, who,
after leaving their native country, come at length to manifest, that
they have not left their old dispositions behind them.

<span id="vi-p16"></span>As, however, it were better that my readers
should revolve in their minds, more than I can express in words, I now
turn to entreat, that God, who has encouraged you hitherto by the
wonderful efficacy of His Spirit, may furnish you with an unconquerable
perseverance unto the end. For I am well aware with what arduous
conflicts God has exercised you, and from which, in accordance with your
singular prudence, you conclude, that a hard and laborious warfare is
still awaiting you. Well knowing, however, from ample experience, how
necessary it is for us to have a hand held out to us from heaven, you
will, of your own accord, unite with me in imploring from that source
the gift of perseverance. As for myself, I will entreat Christ our King,
to whom supreme power has been given by the Father, and in whose hands
all the treasures of spiritual blessings have been deposited, that He
may long preserve you safely to us for the spread of His kingdom; and
that He may in you accomplish farther triumphs over Satan and his bands.

<span id="vi-p17"></span>24th January 1556, ten years after this
Commentary was first published.

of self-denial which Calvin here recommends. — *Ed*.
