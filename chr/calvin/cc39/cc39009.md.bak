<span id="x-p1"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="x.i"></span>

<span id="x.i-p1"></span><span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001.md)<span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p2"></span>**1.** And I, brethren, could not speak unto
you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, *even* as unto babes in
Christ.

<span id="x.i-p3"></span>**1.** Et ego, fratres, non potui vobis loqui
tanquam spiritualibus, sed tanquam carnalibus, tanquam pueris in
Christo.  <span id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md)

<span id="x.i-p5"></span>**2.** I have fed you with milk, and not with
meat: for hitherto ye were not able *to bear it*, neither yet now are ye
able.

<span id="x.i-p6"></span>**2.** Lactis potu vos alui, non solido cibo.
Nondum enim eratis capaces, ac ne nunc quidem estis:

<span id="x.i-p7"></span>**3.** For ye are yet carnal: for whereas
*there is* among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not
carnal, and walk as men?

<span id="x.i-p8"></span>**3.** Siquidem estis adhuc carnales. Postquam
enim sunt inter vos aemulatio et contentio, et factioncs; nonne carnales
estis, et secundum hominem ambulatis?

<span id="x.i-p9"></span>**4.** For while one saith, I am of Paul; and
another, I *am* of Apollos; are ye not carnal?

<span id="x.i-p10"></span>**4.** Quum enim dicat unus, Ego sum Pauli:
alter vero, Ego Apollo: nonne carnales estis?

<span id="x.i-p11"></span> 

<span id="x.i-p12"></span><span id="x.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p13"></span>**1.** *And I, brethren* He begins to apply to
the Corinthians themselves, that he had said respecting carnal persons,
that they may understand that the fault was their own — that the
doctrine of the Cross had not more charms for them. It is probable, that
in mercantile minds like theirs there was too much confidence and
arrogance still lingering, so that it was not without much ado and great
difficulty that they could bring themselves to embrace the simplicity of
the gospel. Hence it was, that undervaluing the Apostle, and the divine
efficacy of his preaching, they were more prepared to listen to those
teachers that were subtle and showy, while destitute of the Spirit.
 <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) Hence, with the view of beating
down so much the better their insolence, he declares, that they belong
to the company of those who, stupefied by carnal sense, are not prepared
to receive the spiritual wisdom of God. He softens down, it is true, the
harshness of his reproach by calling them *brethren*, but at the same
time he brings it forward expressly as a matter of reproach against
them, that their minds were suffocated with the darkness of the flesh to
such a degree that it formed a hindrance to his preaching among them.
What sort of sound judgment then must they have, when they are not fit
and prepared as yet even for hearing! He does not mean, however, that
they were altogether *carnal*, so as to have not one spark of the Spirit
of God — but that they had still greatly too much of carnal sense, so
that the flesh prevailed over the Spirit, and did as it were drown out
his light. Hence, although they were not altogether destitute of grace,
yet, as they had more of the flesh than of the Spirit, they are on that
account termed *carnal* This sufficiently appears from what he
immediately adds — that they were *babes in Christ*; for they would not
have been *babes* had they not been begotten, and that begetting is from
the Spirit of God.

<span id="x.i-p15"></span>*Babes in Christ* This term is sometimes taken
in a good sense, as it is by Peter, who exhorts us to be like *new-born
babes*, (<span id="x.i-p15.1"></span>[1Pe
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002)<span id="x.i-p15.1"></span>,.md) and
in that saying of Christ,

<span id="x.i-p16"></span>Unless ye become as these little children,  
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of God, (<span
id="x.i-p16.2"></span>[Lu 18:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#017.md)<span
id="x.i-p16.2"></span>.)

<span id="x.i-p17"></span>Here, however, it is taken in a bad sense, as
referring to the understanding. For we must be *children in malice*,
*but not in understanding*, as he says afterwards in <span
id="x.i-p17.1"></span>[1Co 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020.md)<span
id="x.i-p17.1"></span>, — a distinction which removes all occasion of
doubt as to the meaning. To this also there is a corresponding passage
in <span id="x.i-p17.2"></span>[Eph
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#014.md)<span id="x.i-p17.2"></span>.

<span id="x.i-p18"></span>That we be no longer children tossed to and
fro with every wind of doctrine, and made the sport  <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) of human fallacies, but may day by day
grow up, *etc*

<span id="x.i-p20"></span><span id="x.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p21"></span>**2.** *I have fed you with milk* Here it is
asked, whether Paul transformed Christ to suit the diversity of his
hearers. I answer, that this refers to the manner and form of his
instructions, rather than to the substance of the doctrine. For Christ
is at once *milk to babes*, and *strong meat to those that are of full
age*, (<span id="x.i-p21.2"></span>[Heb.
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#014)<span id="x.i-p21.2"></span>,.md) the
same truth of the gospel is administered to both, but so as to suit
their capacity. Hence it is the part of a wise teacher to accommodate
himself to the capacity of those whom he has undertaken to instruct, so
that in dealing with the weak and ignorant, he begins with first
principles, and does not go higher than *they are able to follow*,
(<span id="x.i-p21.3"></span>[Mr
4:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#033)<span id="x.i-p21.3"></span>,.md) and
so that, in short, he drops in his instructions by little and little,
 <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) lest it should run over, if
poured in more abundantly. At the same time, those first principles will
contain everything necessary to be known, no less than the farther
advanced lessons that are communicated to those that are stronger. On
this point read Augustine’s 98th homily on John. This tends to refute
the specious pretext of some, who, while they do but mutter out, from
fear of danger, something of the gospel in an indistinct manner,  <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) pretend to have Paul’s example here.
Meanwhile, they present Christ at such a distance, and covered over,
besides, with so many disguises, that they constantly keep their
followers in destructive ignorance. I shall say nothing of their mixing
up many corruptions, their presenting Christ not simply in half, but
torn to fragments,  <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) their not
merely concealing such gross idolatry, but confirming it also by their
own example, and, if they have said anything that is good, straightway
polluting it with numerous falsehoods. How unlike they are to Paul is
sufficiently manifest; for *milk* is nourishment and not poison, and
nourishment that is suitable and useful for bringing up children until
they are farther advanced.

<span id="x.i-p25"></span>*For ye were not yet able to bear it* That
they may not flatter themselves too much on their own discernment, he
first of all tells them what he had found among them at the beginning,
and then adds, what is still more severe, that the same faults remain
among them to this day. For they ought at least, in putting on Christ,
to have put off the flesh; and thus we see that Paul complains that the
success which his doctrine ought to have had was impeded. For if the
hearer does not occasion delay by his slowness, it is the part of a good
teacher to be always going up higher,  <span
id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) till perfection has been attained.

<span id="x.i-p27"></span><span id="x.i-p27.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p28"></span>**3.** *For ye are as yet carnal* So long as
the flesh, that is to say, natural corruption, prevails in a man, it has
so completely possession of the man’s mind, that the wisdom of God finds
no admittance. Hence, if we would make proficiency in the Lord’s school,
we must first of all renounce our own judgment and our own will. Now,
although among the Corinthians some sparks of piety were emitted, they
were kept under by being choked.  <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md)

<span id="x.i-p30"></span>*For since there are among you.* The proof is
derived from the effects; for as *envying, and strifes, and divisions*,
are the fruits of the flesh, wherever they are seen, it is certain that
the root is there in its rigor. Those evils prevailed among the
Corinthians; and accordingly he proves from this that they are *carnal*
He makes use of the same argument, too, in <span
id="x.i-p30.1"></span>[Ga 5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025.md)<span
id="x.i-p30.1"></span> *If ye live in the Spirit*, *walk also in the
Spirit* For while they were desirous to be regarded as spiritual, he
calls them to look at their *works*, by which *they denied* what with
their mouth they *professed* (<span id="x.i-p30.2"></span>Titus 1:16.)
Observe, however, the elegant arrangement that Paul here pursues: for
from *envying* spring up *contentions*, and these, when they have once
been enkindled, break out into deadly sects: but the mother of all these
evils is ambition.

<span id="x.i-p31"></span>*Walk as men* From this it is manifest that
the term *flesh* is not restricted to the lower appetites merely, as the
Sophists pretend, the seat of which they call sensuality, but is
employed to describe man’s whole nature. For those that follow the
guidance of nature, are not governed by the Spirit of God. These,
according to the Apostle’s definition, are *carnal*, so that the flesh
and man’s natural disposition are quite synonymous, and hence it is not
without good reason that he elsewhere requires that we be *new creatures
in Christ* (<span id="x.i-p31.1"></span>[2Co
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017)<span id="x.i-p31.1"></span>..md)

<span id="x.i-p32"></span><span id="x.i-p32.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p33"></span>**4.** *For while one saith* He now specifies
the particular kind of contentions,  <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) and he does this by personating the
Corinthians, that his description may have more force — that each one
gloried in his particular master, as though *Christ* were not *the one
Master of all* (<span id="x.i-p34.2"></span>[Mt
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008)<span id="x.i-p34.2"></span>..md)
Now, where such ambition still prevails, the gospel has little or no
success. You are not, however, to understand that they declared this
openly in express words, but the Apostle reproves those depraved
dispositions to which they were given up. At the same time it is likely,
that, as a predilection arising from ambition is usually accompanied
with an empty talkativeness,  <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md)
they openly discovered by their words the absurd bias of their mind, by
extolling their teachers to the skies in magnificent terms, accompanying
this at the same time with contempt of Paul and those like him.

<span id="x.ii"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p1"></span><span id="x.ii-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
3:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#005.md)<span id="x.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p2"></span>**5.** Who then is Paul, and who *is* Apollos,
but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?

<span id="x.ii-p3"></span>**5.** Quis ergo est Paulus, aut quis Apollos,
nisi ministri, per quos credidistis, et sicut unicuique Dominus every
dedit?

<span id="x.ii-p4"></span>**6.** I have planted, Apollos watered; but
God gave the increase.

<span id="x.ii-p5"></span>**6.** Ego plantavi, Apollos rigavit; at Deus
incrementum dedit.

<span id="x.ii-p6"></span>**7.** So then neither is he that planteth any
thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.

<span id="x.ii-p7"></span>**7.** Ergo neque qui plantat aliquid est,
neque qui rigat; sed Deus qui dat incrementurn.

<span id="x.ii-p8"></span>**8.** Now he that planteth and he that
watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according
to his own labor.

<span id="x.ii-p9"></span>**8.** Qui autem plantat, et qui rigat, unum
 <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) sunt. Porro quisque propriam
mercedem secundum laborem suum recipiet.

<span id="x.ii-p11"></span>**9.** For we are laborers together with God:
ye are God’s husbandry, *ye are* God’s building.

<span id="x.ii-p12"></span>**9.** Dei enim cooperarii sumus,  <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) Dei agricultura, Dei aedificatio
estis.

<span id="x.ii-p14"></span> 

<span id="x.ii-p15"></span><span id="x.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p16"></span>**5.** *Who then is Paul*? Here he begins to
treat of the estimation in which ministers ought to be held, and the
purpose for which they have been set apart by the Lord. He names himself
and Apollos rather than others, that he may avoid any appearance of
envy.  <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) “What else,” says he,
“are all ministers appointed for, but to bring you to faith through
means of their preaching?” From this Paul infers, that no man ought to
be gloried in, for faith allows of no glorying except in Christ alone.
Hence those that extol men above measure, strip them of their true
dignity. For the grand distinction of them all is, that they are
ministers of faith, or, in other words, that they gain disciples to
Christ, not to themselves. Now, though he appears in this way to
depreciate the dignity of ministers, yet he does not assign it a lower
place than it ought to hold. For he says much when he says, that we
receive faith through their ministry. Nay farther, the efficacy of
external doctrine receives here extraordinary commendation, when it is
spoken of as the instrument of the Holy Spirit; and pastors are honored
with no common title of distinction, when God is said to make use of
them as his ministers, for dispensing the inestimable treasure of faith.

<span id="x.ii-p18"></span>*As the Lord hath given to every man.* In the
Greek words used by Paul the particle of comparison <span
id="x.ii-p18.1"></span>ὡς, *as*, is placed after <span
id="x.ii-p18.2"></span>ἑκαστῳ — to *every man*; but the order is
inverted.  <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) Hence to make the
meaning more apparent, I have rendered it “<span
id="x.ii-p19.4"></span>Sicut unicuique,” — “as to every man,” rather
than “<span id="x.ii-p19.5"></span>Unicuique sicut,” — “to every man
as.” In some manuscripts, however, the particle <span
id="x.ii-p19.6"></span>και, *and*, is wanting, and it is all in one
connection, thus: *Ministers by whom ye believed as the Lord gave to
every man* If we read it in this way, the latter clause will be added to
explain the former, — so that Paul explains what he meant by the term
*minister*: “Those are *ministers* whose services God makes use of, not
as though they could do anything by their own efforts, but in so far as
they are guided by his hand, as instruments.” The rendering that I have
given, however, is, in my opinion, the more correct one. If we adopt it,
the statement will be more complete, for it will consist of two clauses,
in this way. In the first place, those are *ministers* who have devoted
their services to Christ, that you might believe in him: farther, they
have nothing of their own to pride themselves upon, inasmuch as they do
nothing of themselves, and have no power to do anything otherwise than
by the gift of God, and every man according to his own measure — which
shows, that whatever each individual has, is derived from another. In
fine, he unites them all together as by a mutual bond, inasmuch as they
require each other’s assistance.

<span id="x.ii-p20"></span><span id="x.ii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p21"></span>**6.** *I have planted, Apollos watered* He
unfolds more clearly the nature of that ministry by a similitude, in
which the nature of the word and the use of preaching are most
appropriately depicted. That the earth may bring forth fruit, there is
need of ploughing and sowing, and other means of culture; but after all
this has been carefully done, the husbandman’s labor would be of no
avail, did not the Lord from heaven *give the increase*, by the breaking
forth of the sun, and still more by his wonderful and secret influence.
Hence, although the diligence of the husbandman is not in vain, nor the
seed that he throws in useless, yet it is only by the blessing of God
that they are made to prosper, for what is more wonderful than that the
seed, after it has rotted, springs up again! In like manner, the word of
the Lord is seed that is in its own nature fruitful: ministers are as it
were husbandmen, that plough and sow. Then follow other helps, as for
example, irrigation. Ministers, too, act a corresponding part when,
after casting the seed into the ground, they give help to the earth as
much as is in their power, until it bring forth what it has conceived:
but as for making their labor actually productive, *that* is a miracle
of divine grace — not a work of human industry.

<span id="x.ii-p22"></span>Observe, however, in this passage, how
necessary the preaching of the word is, and how necessary the
continuance of it.  <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) It were,
undoubtedly, as easy a thing for God to bless the earth without
diligence on the part of men, so as to make it bring forth fruit of its
own accord, as to draw out, or rather press out  <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) its increase, at the expense of much
assiduity on the part of men, and much sweat and sorrow; but as *the
Lord hath so ordained* (<span id="x.ii-p24.2"></span>[1Co
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#014)<span id="x.ii-p24.2"></span>.md)
that man should labor, and that the earth, on its part, yield a return
to his culture, let us take care to act accordingly. In like manner, it
were perfectly in the power of God, without the aid of men, if it so
pleased him, to produce faith in persons while asleep; but he has
appointed it otherwise, so that faith is produced *by hearing*. (<span
id="x.ii-p24.3"></span>[Ro 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017.md)<span
id="x.ii-p24.3"></span>.) That man, then, who, in the neglect of this
means, expects to attain faith, acts just as if the husbandman, throwing
aside the plough, taking no care to sow; and leaving off all the labor
of husbandry, were to open his mouth, expecting food to drop into it
from heaven.

<span id="x.ii-p25"></span>As to *continuance*  <span
id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) we see what Paul says here — that it
is not enough that the seed be sown, if it is not brought forward from
time to time by new helps. He, then, who has already received the seed,
has still need of *watering*, nor must endeavors be left off, until full
maturity has been attained, or in other words, till life is ended.
Apollos, then, who succeeded Paul in the ministry of the word at
Corinth, is said to have *watered* what he had sown.

<span id="x.ii-p27"></span><span id="x.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p28"></span>**7.** *Neither is he that planteth anything*
It appears, nevertheless, from what has been already said, that their
labor is of some importance. We must observe, therefore, why it is that
Paul thus depreciates it; and first of all, it is proper to notice that
he is accustomed to speak in two different ways of ministers,  <span
id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) as well as of sacraments. For in some
cases he views a minister as one that has been set apart by the Lord
for, in the first instance, regenerating souls, and, afterwards,
nourishing them up unto eternal life, for *remitting sins*, (<span
id="x.ii-p29.3"></span>[Joh 20:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#023.md)<span
id="x.ii-p29.3"></span>,) for renewing the minds of men, for raising up
the kingdom of Christ, and destroying that of Satan. Viewed in that
aspect he does not merely assign to him the duty of *planting* and
*watering*, but furnishes him, besides, with the efficacy of the Holy
Spirit, that his labor may not be in vain. Thus  <span
id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) in another passage he calls himself a
*minister of the Spirit*, and *not of the letter*, inasmuch as he writes
the word of the Lord on men’s hearts. (<span id="x.ii-p30.2"></span>[2Co
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#006)<span id="x.ii-p30.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.ii-p31"></span>In other cases he views a minister as one
that is a servant, not a master — an instrument, not the hand; and in
short as man, not God. Viewed in that aspect, he leaves him nothing but
his labor, and that, too, dead and powerless, if the Lord does not make
it efficacious by his Spirit. The reason is, that when it is simply the
ministry that is treated of, we must have an eye not merely to man, but
also to God, working in him by the grace of the Spirit — not as though
the grace of the Spirit were invariably tied to the word of man, but
because Christ puts forth his power in the ministry which he has
instituted, in such a manner that it is made evident, that it was not
instituted in vain. In this manner he does not take away or diminish
anything that belongs to Him, with the view of transferring it to man.
For He is not separated from the minister,  <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) but on the contrary His power is
*declared* to be efficacious in the minister. But as we sometimes, in so
far as our judgment is depraved, take occasion improperly from this to
extol men too highly, we require to distinguish for the purpose of
correcting this fault, and we must set the Lord on the one side, and the
minister on the other, and then it becomes manifest, how indigent man is
in himself, and how utterly devoid of efficacy.

<span id="x.ii-p33"></span>Let it be known by us, therefore, that in
this passage ministers are brought into comparison with the Lord, and
the reason of this comparison is — that mankind, while estimating
grudgingly the grace of God, are too lavish in their commendations of
ministers, and in this manner they snatch away what is God’s, with the
view of transferring it to themselves. At the same time he always
observes a most becoming medium, for when he says, that *God giveth the
increase,* he intimates by this, that the efforts of men themselves are
not without success. The case is the same as to the sacraments, as we
shall see elsewhere.  <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) Hence,
although our heavenly Father does not reject our labor in cultivating
his field, and does not allow it to be unproductive, yet he will have
its success depend exclusively upon his blessing, that he may have the
entire praise. Accordingly, if we are desirous to make any progress in
laboring, in striving, in pressing forward, let it be known by us, that
we will make no progress, unless he prospers our labors, our strivings,
and our assiduity, in order that we may commend ourselves, and
everything we do to his grace.

<span id="x.ii-p35"></span><span id="x.ii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p36"></span>**8.** *He that planteth, and he that
watereth are one* He shows farther, from another consideration, that the
Corinthians are greatly to blame in abusing, with a view to maintain
their own sects and parties, the names of their teachers, who in the
meantime are, with united efforts, aiming at one and the same thing, and
can by no means be separated, or torn asunder, without at the same time
leaving off the duties of their office. *They are one*, says he; in
other words, they are so linked together, that their connection does not
allow of any separation, because all ought to have one end in view, and
they serve one Lord, and are engaged in the same work. Hence, if they
employ themselves faithfully in cultivating the Lord’s field, they will
maintain unity; and, by mutual communication, will help each other — so
far from their names serving as standards to stir up contendings. Here
we have a beautiful passage for exhorting ministers to concord.
Meanwhile, however, he indirectly reproves those ambitious teachers,
who, by giving occasion for contentions, discovered thereby that they
were not the servants of Christ, but the slaves of vain-glory — that
they did not employ themselves in *planting* and *watering*, but in
rooting up and burning.

<span id="x.ii-p37"></span>*Every man will receive his own reward* Here
he shows what is the end that all ministers should have in view — not to
catch the applause of the multitude, but to please the Lord. This, too,
he does with the view of calling to the judgment-seat of God those
ambitious teachers, who were intoxicated with the glory of the world,
and thought of nothing else; and at the same time admonishing the
Corinthians, as to the worthlessness of that empty applause which is
drawn forth by elegance of expression and vain ostentation. He at the
same time discovers in these words the fearlessness of his conscience,
inasmuch as he ventures to look forward to the judgment of God without
dismay. For the reason why ambitious men recommend themselves to the
esteem of the world is, that they have not learned to devote themselves
to God, and that they do not set before their eyes Christ’s heavenly
kingdom. Accordingly, as soon as God comes to be seen, that foolish
desire of gaining man’s favor disappears.

<span id="x.ii-p38"></span><span id="x.ii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p39"></span>**9.** *For we are fellow-laborers with God.*
Here is the best argument. It is the Lord’s work that we are employed
in, and it is to him that we have devoted our labors: hence, as he is
faithful and just, he will not disappoint us of our reward. That man,
accordingly, is mistaken who looks to men, or depends merely on their
remuneration. Here we have an admirable commendation of the ministry —
that while God could accomplish the work entirely himself, he calls us,
puny mortals,  <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) to be as it were
his coadjutors, and makes use of us as instruments. As to the perversion
of this statement by the Papists, for supporting their system of
free-will, it is beyond measure silly, for Paul shows here, not what men
can effect by their natural powers, but what the Lord accomplishes
through means of them by his grace. As to the exposition given by some —
that Paul, being God’s workman, was a fellow-workman with his
colleagues, that is, with the other teachers — it appears to me harsh
and forced, and there is nothing whatever in the case that shuts us up
to have recourse to that refinement. For it corresponds admirably with
the Apostle’s design to understand him to mean, that, while it is
peculiarly the work of God to build his temple, or cultivate his
vineyard, he calls forth ministers to be *fellow-laborers*, by means of
whom He alone works; but, at the same time, in such a way, that they in
their turn labor in common with him. As to the reward of works, consult
my *Institutes*  <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md)

<span id="x.ii-p42"></span>God’s husbandry, God’s building. These
expressions may be explained in two ways. They may be taken actively in
this sense: “You have been planted in the Lord’s field by the labor of
men in such a way, that our heavenly Father himself is the true
Husbandman, and the Author of this plantation. You have been built up by
men in such a way, that he himself is the true Master-builder.  <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) Or, it may be taken in a passive
sense, thus: “In laboring to till you, and to sow the word of God among
you and water it, we have not done this on our own account, or with a
view to advantage to accrue to us, but have devoted our service to the
Lord. In our endeavors to build you up, we have not been influenced by a
view to our own advantage, but with a view to your being God’s planting
and building. This latter interpretation I rather prefer, for I am of
opinion, that Paul meant here to express the idea, that true ministers
labor not for themselves, but for the Lord. Hence it follows, that the
Corinthians were greatly to blame in devoting themselves to men,  <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md) while of right they belonged
exclusively to God. And, in the first place, he calls them his
husbandry, following out the metaphor previously taken up, and then
afterwards, with the view of introducing himself to a larger discussion,
he makes use of another metaphor, derived from architecture.  <span

<span id="x.iii-p16"></span><span id="x.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p17"></span>**10.** *As a wise master-builder* It is a
most apt similitude, and accordingly it is frequently met with in the
Scriptures, as we shall see ere long. Here, however, the Apostle
declares his fidelity with great confidence and fearlessness, as it
required to be asserted in opposition not merely to the calumnies of the
wicked, but also to the pride of the Corinthians, who had already begun
to despise his doctrine. The more, therefore, they lowered him, so much
the higher does he raise himself up, and speaking as it were from a
pulpit of vast height, he declares  <span
id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) that he had been the first
*master-builder* of God among them in laying the foundation, and that he
had with *wisdom* executed that department of duty, and that it remained
that others should go forward in the same manner, regulating the
superstructure in conformity with the rule of the foundation. Let us
observe that these things are said by Paul *first* of all for the
purpose of commending his doctrine, which he saw was despised by the
Corinthians; and, *secondly*, for the purpose of repressing the
insolence of others, who from a desire for distinction, affected a new
method of teaching. These he accordingly admonishes to attempt nothing
rashly in God’s building. Two things he prohibits them from doing: they
must not venture to lay another foundation, and they must not raise a
superstructure that will not be answerable to the foundation.

<span id="x.iii-p19"></span>*According to the grace* He always takes
diligent heed not to usurp to himself a single particle of the glory
that belongs to God, for he refers all thing’s to God, and leaves
nothing to himself, except his having been an instrument. While,
however, he thus submits himself humbly to God, he indirectly reproves
the arrogance of those who thought nothing of throwing *the grace of
God* into the shade,  <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) provided
only they were themselves held in estimation. He hints, too, that there
was nothing of the *grace* of the Spirit in that empty show, for which
they were held in esteem, while on the other hand he clears himself from
contempt, on the ground of his having been under divine influence.
 <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md)

<span id="x.iii-p22"></span><span id="x.iii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p23"></span>**11.** *For other foundation can no man
lay* This statement consists of two parts; *first*, that Christ is the
only foundation of the Church; and *secondly*, that the Corinthians had
been rightly founded upon Christ through Paul’s preaching. For it was
necessary that they should be brought back to Christ alone, inasmuch as
their ears were tickled with a fondness for novelty. It was, too, of no
small importance that Paul should be recognized as the principal, and,
so to speak, fundamental *master-builder*, from whose doctrine they
could not draw back, without forsaking Christ himself. The sum is this —
that the Church must by all means be founded upon Christ alone, and that
Paul had executed this department of duty so faithfully that nothing
could be found to be wanting in his ministry. Hence, whoever may come
after him, can in no other way serve the Lord with a good conscience, or
be listened to as ministers of Christ, than by studying to make their
doctrine correspond with his, and retain the *foundation* which he has
laid. Hence we infer, that those are not faithful workmen for building
up the Church, but on the contrary are *scatterers* of it, (<span
id="x.iii-p23.1"></span>[Mt 12:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#030.md)<span
id="x.iii-p23.1"></span>,) who succeed faithful ministers, but do not
make it their aim to conform themselves to their doctrine, and carry
forward what has been well commenced, so as to make it quite manifest
 <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) that they are attempting no new
work. For what can be more pernicious than by a new manner of teaching
to harass believers, who have been well instructed in pure doctrine, so
that they stagger in uncertainty as to the true foundation. Now the
fundamental doctrine, which it were unlawful to undermine, is, that we
learn Christ, for Christ is the only *foundation* of the Church; but
there are many who, while they make use of Christ’s name in pretense,
tear up the whole truth of God by the roots.  <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md)

<span id="x.iii-p26"></span>Let us observe, then, in what way the Church
is rightly built upon Christ. It is when he alone is set forth for
righteousness, redemption, sanctification, wisdom, satisfaction and
cleansing; in short, for life and glory; or if you would have it stated
more briefly, when he is proclaimed in such a manner that his office and
influence are understood in accordance with what we found stated in the
close of the first chapter. (<span id="x.iii-p26.1"></span>[1Co
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030)<span id="x.iii-p26.1"></span>..md)
If, on the other hand, Christ is only in some degree acknowledged, and
is called a Redeemer only in name, while in the meantime recourse is had
to some other quarter for righteousness, sanctification and salvation,
he is driven off from the *foundation*, and spurious  <span
id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) stones are substituted in his room. It
is in this manner that Papists act, who rob him of almost all his
ornaments, leaving him scarcely anything but the bare name. Such
persons, then, are far from being founded on Christ. For as Christ is
the *foundation* of the Church, because he is the only source of
salvation and eternal life — because in him we come to know God the
Father — because in him we have the source of every blessing; if he is
not acknowledged as such he is no longer regarded as the *foundation*

<span id="x.iii-p28"></span>But it is asked — “Is Christ only a part, or
simply the commencement of the doctrine of salvation, as the foundation
is merely a part of the building; for if it were so, believers would
have only their commencement in Christ, and would be perfected without
him. Now this Paul might seem to intimate.” I answer that this is not
the meaning of the words; otherwise he would contradict himself when he
says elsewhere, that “in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
*knowledge*.” (<span id="x.iii-p28.1"></span>[Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003)<span id="x.iii-p28.1"></span>..md)
He, then, who has learned Christ, (<span id="x.iii-p28.2"></span>[Eph
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#020)<span id="x.iii-p28.2"></span>,.md)
is already complete in the whole system of heavenly doctrine. But as
Paul’s ministry had contemplated rather the founding of the Corinthians
than the raising up among them of the top-stone of the building, he
merely shows here what he had done in respect of his having preached
Christ in purity. With *respect to* himself therefore, he calls him the
*foundation,* while at the same time he does not thereby exclude him
from the rest of the building. In fine, Paul does not put any kind of
doctrine in opposition to the knowledge of Christ, but on the contrary
there is a comparison between himself and the ministers.

<span id="x.iii-p29"></span><span id="x.iii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p30"></span>**12.** *Now if any man build upon this
foundation* He pursues still farther the metaphor. It would not have
been enough to have laid the foundation if the entire superstructure did
not correspond; for as it were an absurd thing to raise a structure of
vile materials on a foundation of gold, so it were greatly criminal to
bury Christ under a mass of strange doctrines.  <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) By *gold*, then, and *silver*, and
*precious stones*, he means doctrine worthy of Christ, and of such a
nature as to be a superstructure corresponding to such a foundation. Let
us not imagine, however, that this doctrine is apart from Christ, but on
the contrary let us understand that we must continue to preach Christ
until the very completion of the building. Only we must observe order,
so as to begin with general doctrine, and more essential articles, as
the foundations, and then go on to admonitions, exhortations, and
everything that is requisite for perseverance, confirmation, and
advancement.

<span id="x.iii-p32"></span>As there is an agreement thus far as to
Paul’s meaning, without any controversy, it follows on the other hand,
that by *wood, stubble* and *hay*, is meant doctrine not answering to
the foundation, such as is forged in men’s brain, and is thrust in upon
us as though it were the oracles of God.  <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) For God will have his Church trained
up by the pure preaching of his own word, not by the contrivances of
men, of which sort also is that which has no tendency to edification, as
for example curious *questions*, (<span id="x.iii-p33.2"></span>[1Ti
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#004)<span id="x.iii-p33.2"></span>,.md)
which commonly contribute more to ostentation, or some foolish appetite,
than to the salvation of men.

<span id="x.iii-p34"></span>He forewarns them that *every man’s work*
will one day *be made manifest of what sort it is*, however it may be
for a time concealed, as though he had said: “It may indeed happen, that
unprincipled workmen may for a time deceive, so that the world does not
perceive how far each one has labored faithfully or fraudulently, but
what is now as it were buried in darkness must of necessity come to
light, and what is now glorious in the eyes of men, must before the face
of God fall down, and be regarded as worthless.”

<span id="x.iii-p35"></span><span id="x.iii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p36"></span>**13.** *For the day will declare it* In the
old translation it is *the day of the Lord*,  <span
id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) but it is probable that the words *of
the Lord* were added by some one by way of explanation. The meaning
unquestionably is complete without that addition. For with propriety we
give the name of *day* to the time when darkness and obscurity are
dispelled, and the truth is brought to light. Hence the Apostle
forewarns us, that it cannot always remain a secret who have acted
fraudulently in the work of the Lord, or who have conducted themselves
with fidelity, as though he had said: “The darkness will not always
remain: the light will one day break forth; which will make all things
manifest.” That day, I own, is God’s — not man’s, but the metaphor is
more elegant if you read simply — *the* *day*, because Paul in this way
conveys the idea, that the Lord’s true servants cannot always be
accurately distinguished from false workmen, inasmuch as virtues and
vices are concealed by the darkness of the night. That night, however,
will not always continue. For ambition is blind — man’s favor is blind —
the world’s applause is blind, but this darkness God afterwards dispels
in his own time. Take notice, that he always discovers the assurance of
a good conscience, and with an unconquerable magnanimity despises
perverse judgments; *first*, in order that he may call back the
Corinthians from popular applause to a right rule of judgment; and
*secondly*, for the purpose of confirming the authority of his ministry.

<span id="x.iii-p38"></span>*Because it will be revealed by fire.* Paul
having spoken of doctrine metaphorically, now also applies
metaphorically the name of *fire* to the very touchstone of doctrine,
that the corresponding parts of the comparison may harmonize with each
other. The *fire*, then, here meant is the Spirit of the Lord, who tries
by his touchstone what doctrine resembles *gold* and what resembles
*stubble* The nearer the doctrine of God is brought to this fire, so
much the brighter will be its luster. On the other hand, what has had
its origin in man’s head will quickly vanish,  <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) as stubble is consumed in the fire.
There seems also to be an allusion to *the day* of which he makes
mention: “Not only will those things which vain ambition, like a dark
night, concealed among the Corinthians, be brought to light by the
brightness of the sun, but there will also be a strength of heat, not
merely for drying up and cleansing away the refuse, but also for burning
up everything wrong.” For however men may look upon themselves, as
forming acute judgments, their discernment, notwithstanding, reaches no
farther than appearance, which, for the most part, has no solidity.
There is nothing but that *day* to which the Apostle appeals, that tests
everything to the quick, not merely by its brightness, but also by its
fiery flame.

<span id="x.iii-p40"></span><span id="x.iii-p40.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p41"></span>**14.** *If any man’s work remains, he will
receive a reward.* His meaning is, that those are fools who depend on
man’s estimation, so as to reckon it enough to be approved by men, for
*then only* will the work have praise and recompense — when it has stood
the test of the *day of the Lord* Hence he exhorts His true ministers to
have an eye to *that day.* For by the word *remains*, he intimates that
doctrines fly about as it were in an unsettled state, nay more, like
empty bubbles, they glitter for the moment, until they have come to be
thoroughly tested. Hence it follows, that we must reckon as nothing all
the applauses of the world, the emptiness of which will in a very little
be exposed by heaven’s judgment.

<span id="x.iii-p42"></span><span id="x.iii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p43"></span>**15.** *If any man’s work shall be burned.*
It is as though he had said: Let no man flatter himself on the ground
that, in the opinion of men, he is reckoned among the most eminent
*master-builders*, for as soon as the day breaks in, his whole work must
go utterly to nothing, if it is not approved of by the Lord. This, then,
is the rule to which every one’s ministry requires to be conformed. Some
explain this of doctrine, so that <span
id="x.iii-p43.1"></span>ζημιουσθαι  <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) means simply *to perish*, and then
what immediately follows they view as referring to the foundation,
because in the Greek <span id="x.iii-p44.2"></span>θεμελιος (foundation)
is in the masculine gender. They do not, however, sufficiently attend to
the entire context. For Paul in this passage subjects to trial, not his
own doctrine, but that of others.  <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) Hence it were out of place to make
mention at present of the foundation. He has stated a little before,
that *every man’s work will be tried by fire.* He comes afterwards to
state an alternative, which ought not to be extended beyond that general
observation. Now it is certain that Paul spoke there simply of the
structure which had been *erected* upon the foundation. He has already
in the first clause promised a reward to good master-builders,  <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) whose labor shall have been approved
of. Hence the contrast in the second clause suits admirably well — that
those who have mixed *stubble*, or *wood*, or *straw*, will be
disappointed of the commendation which they had expected.

<span id="x.iii-p47"></span>He himself will be saved, etc. It is certain
that Paul speaks of those who, while always retaining the foundations,
mix hay with gold, stubble with silver, and wood with precious stones —
that is, those who build upon Christ, but in consequence of the weakness
of the flesh, admit something that is man’s, or through ignorance turn
aside to some extent from the strict purity of God’s word. Such were
many of the saints, Cyprian, Ambrose, Augustine, and the like. Add to
these, if you choose, from those of later times, Gregory and Bernard,
and others of that stamp, who, while they had it as their object to
build upon Christ, did nevertheless often deviate from the right system
of building. Such persons, Paul says, could be saved, but on this
condition — if the Lord wiped away their ignorance, and purged them from
all dross.

<span id="x.iii-p48"></span>This is the meaning of the clause so as by
fire. He means, therefore, to intimate, that he does not take away from
them the hope of salvation, provided they willingly submit to the loss
of their labor, and are purged by the mercy of God, as gold is refined
in the furnace. Farther, although God sometimes purges his own people by
afflictions, yet here by the name of fire, I understand the touchstone
of the Spirit, by which the Lord corrects and removes the ignorance of
his people, by which they were for a time held captive. I am aware,
indeed, that, many refer this to the cross,  <span
id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) but I am confident that my
interpretation will please all that are of sound judgment.

<span id="x.iii-p50"></span>It remains, that we give an answer in
passing to the Papists, who endeavor from this passage to prop up
Purgatory. “The sinners  <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) whom
God forgives, pass through the fire, that they may be saved.” Hence they
in this way suffer punishment in the presence of God, so as to afford
satisfaction to his justice I pass over their endless fictions in
reference to the measure of punishment, and the means of redemption from
them, but I ask, who they are that pass through the fire? Paul assuredly
speaks of ministers alone. “There is the same reason,” they say, “as to
all.” It is not for us  <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) but for
God to judge as to this matter. But even granting them this, how
childishly they stumble at the term fire. For to what purpose is this
fire,  <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) but for burning up the
hay and straw, and on the other hand, for proving the gold and silver.
Do they mean to say that doctrines are discerned by the fire of their
purgatory? Who has ever learned from that, what difference there is
between truth and falsehood? Farther, when will that day come that will
shine forth so as to discover every one’s work? Did it begin at the
beginning of the world, and will it continue without interruption to the
end? If the terms stubble, hay, gold, and silver are figurative, as they
must necessarily allow, what correspondence will there be between the
different clauses, if there is nothing figurative in the term fire?
Away, then, with such silly trifles, which carry their absurdity in
their forehead, for the Apostle’s true meaning is, I think, sufficiently
manifest.

id="x.iv-p23.3"></span>[1Co 6:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#019.md)<span
id="x.iv-p23.3"></span>) repeating the same sentiment, but for another
purpose. For in that passage he treats of chastity; but here, on the
other hand, he exhorts them to have their faith resting on the obedience
of Christ alone. The interrogation gives additional emphasis; for he
indirectly intimates, that he speaks to them of a thing that they knew,
while he appeals to them as witnesses.

<span id="x.iv-p24"></span>*And the Spirit of God.* Here we have the
reason why they are *the temple of God* Hence *and* must be understood
as meaning *because*  <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) This is
customary, as in the words of the poet — “Thou hadst heard it, *and* it
had been reported.” “For this reason,” says he, “are ye the *temples of
God*, because He dwells in you by his Spirit; for no unclean place can
be the habitation of God.” In this passage we have an explicit testimony
for maintaining the divinity of the Holy Spirit. For if he were a
creature, or merely a gift, he would not make us *temples of God*, by
dwelling in us. At the same time we learn, in what manner God
communicates himself to us, and by what tie we are bound to him — when
he pours down upon us the influence of his Spirit.

<span id="x.iv-p26"></span><span id="x.iv-p26.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p27"></span>**17.** *If any man corrupts the temple of
God.* He subjoins a dreadful threatening — that, as the *temple of God*
ought to be inviolably sacred, that man, whoever he may be, that
corrupts it, will not pass with impunity. The kind of profanation of
which he now speaks, is, when men intrude themselves, so as to bear rule
in the Church in the place of God. For as that faith, which is devoted
to the pure doctrine of Christ, is called elsewhere spiritual
*chastity*, (<span id="x.iv-p27.1"></span>[2Co
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)<span id="x.iv-p27.1"></span>,.md) so
it also sanctifies our souls for the right and pure worship of God. For
as soon as we are tinctured with the contrivances of men, the temple of
God is polluted, as it were, with filth, because the sacrifice of faith,
which he claims for himself alone, is in that case offered to creatures.

<span id="x.iv-p28"></span><span id="x.iv-p28.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p29"></span>**18.** *Let no man deceive himself* Here he
puts his finger upon the true sore, as the whole mischief originated in
this — that they were wise in their own conceit. Hence he exhorts them
not to deceive themselves with a false impression, by arrogating any
wisdom to themselves — by which he means, that all are under a mistake,
who depend upon their own judgment. Now, he addresses himself, in my
opinion, to hearers as well as teachers. For the former discovered a
partiality for those ambitious men, and lent an ear to them,  <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) because they had too fastidious a
taste, so that the simplicity of the gospel was insipid to their taste;
while the latter aimed at nothing but show, that they might be in some
estimation. He accordingly admonishes both to this effect — “Let no one
rest satisfied with his own wisdom, but let him *who thinketh himself to
be wise, become a fool in this world*,” or, “*Let* him who is
distinguished in this world by reputation for wisdom, of his own accord
empty himself,  <span id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) and *become a
fool* in his own estimation.”

<span id="x.iv-p32"></span>Farther, in these words the Apostle does not
require, that we should altogether renounce the wisdom that is implanted
in us by nature, or acquired by long practice; but simply, that we
subject it to the service of God, so as to have no wisdom but through
his word. For this is what is meant by *becoming a fool in this world*,
or in our own estimation — when we are prepared to give way to God, and
embrace with fear and reverence everything that he teaches us, rather
than follow what may appear to us plausible.  <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md)

<span id="x.iv-p34"></span>The meaning of the clause *in this world*, is
as though he had said — “According to the judgment or opinion of the
world.” For the wisdom of the world is this — if we reckon ourselves
sufficient of ourselves for *taking counsel* as to all matters (<span
id="x.iv-p34.1"></span>[Ps 13:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#002.md)<span
id="x.iv-p34.1"></span>) for governing ourselves, and for managing
whatever we have to do — if we have no dependence on any other  <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) — if we feel no need of the guidance
of another, but are *competent* to govern ourselves.  <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) He, therefore, on, the other hand, is
*a fool in this world*, who, renouncing his own understanding, allows
himself to be directed by the Lord, as if with his eyes shut — who,
distrusting himself, leans wholly upon the Lord, places his whole wisdom
in him, and yields himself up to God in docility and submission. It is
necessary that our wisdom should in this way vanish, in order that the
will of God may have authority over us, and that we be emptied of our
own understanding, that we may be filled with the wisdom of God. At the
same time, the clause  <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) may
either be taken in connection with the first part of the verse, or
joined with the last, but as the meaning is not much different, I leave
every one to choose for himself.

<span id="x.iv-p38"></span><span id="x.iv-p38.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p39"></span>**19.** *For the wisdom of this world* This
is an argument taken from things opposite. To maintain the one is to
overturn the other. As, therefore, *the wisdom of this world is
foolishness with God*, it follows that we cannot be wise in the sight of
God, unless we are fools in the view of the world. We have already
explained (<span id="x.iv-p39.1"></span>[1Co
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020)<span id="x.iv-p39.1"></span>.md)
what he means by *the wisdom of this world*; for natural perspicacity is
a gift of God, and the liberal arts, and all the sciences by which
wisdom is acquired, are gifts of God. They are confined, however, within
their own limits; for into God’s heavenly kingdom they cannot penetrate.
Hence they must occupy the place of handmaid, not of mistress: nay more,
they must be looked upon as empty and worthless, until they have become
entirely subject to the word and Spirit of God. If, on the other hand,
they set themselves in opposition to Christ, they must be looked upon as
dangerous pests, and, if they strive to accomplish anything of
themselves, as the worst of all hindrances.  <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) Hence *the wisdom of the world*, in
Paul’s acceptation, is that which assumes to itself authority, and does
not allow itself to be regulated by the word of God, or to be subdued,
so as to yield itself up in entire subjection to him. Until, therefore,
matters have come to this, that the individual acknowledges that he
knows nothing but what he has learned from God, and, giving up his own
understanding; resigns himself unreservedly to Christ’s guidance, he is
wise in the world’s account, but he is foolish in the estimation of God.

<span id="x.iv-p41"></span>*For it is written, He taketh the wise* He
confirms this from *two* Scripture proofs, the *first* of which is taken
from <span id="x.iv-p41.1"></span>[Job
5:13](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#013.md)<span id="x.iv-p41.1"></span>,
where the wisdom of God is extolled on this ground, that no wisdom of
the world can stand before it.

<span id="x.iv-p42"></span>Now it is certain, that the Prophet speaks
there of those that are cunning and crafty; but as the wisdom of man is
invariably such without God,  <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) it
is with good reason that Paul applies it in this sense, — that whatever
wisdom men have of themselves is reckoned of no account in the sight of
God. The *second* is from <span id="x.iv-p43.2"></span>[Ps
94:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa094.htm#011.md)<span id="x.iv-p43.2"></span>,
where David, after claiming for God alone the office and authority of
the Instructor of all, adds, that *He knows the thoughts of all to be
vain.* Hence, in whatever estimation they are held by us, they are, in
the judgment of God, *vain* Here we have an admirable passage for
bringing down the confidence of the flesh, while God from on high
declares that everything that the mind of man conceives and contrives is
mere *vanity*  <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md)

<span id="x.iv-p45"></span><span id="x.iv-p45.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p46"></span>**21.** *Therefore let no man glory in men*
As there is nothing that is more *vain* than man, how little security
there is in leaning upon an evanescent shadow! Hence he infers with
propriety from the preceding statement, that we must not *glory in men*,
inasmuch as the Lord thus takes away from mankind universally every
ground of glorying. At the same time this inference depends on the whole
of the foregoing doctrine, as will appear ere long. For as we belong to
Christ alone, it is with good reason that he teaches us, that any
supremacy of man, by which the glory of Christ is impaired, involves
sacrilege.

<span id="x.iv-p47"></span><span id="x.iv-p47.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p48"></span>**22.** *All things are yours.* He proceeds
to show what place and station teachers should occupy  <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) — such as not to detract in any degree
from the authority of Christ, the one Master. As therefore Christ is the
Church’s sole master, and as he alone without exception is worthy to be
listened to, it is necessary to distinguish between him and others, as
even Christ himself has testified respecting himself, (<span
id="x.iv-p49.2"></span>[Mt 23:8](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#008.md)<span
id="x.iv-p49.2"></span>,) and no other is recommended to us by the
Father with this honorable declaration,  <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) “Hear ye him.” (<span
id="x.iv-p50.2"></span>[Mt 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#005.md)<span
id="x.iv-p50.2"></span>.) As, therefore, he alone is endowed with
authority to rule us by his word, Paul says that others *are ours* —
meaning, that they are appointed to us by God with the view of our
making use of them — not that they should exercise dominion over our
consciences. Thus on the one hand, he shows that they are not useless,
and, on the other hand, he keeps them in their own place, that they may
not exalt themselves in opposition to Christ. What he adds, as to
*death*, *life*, and the rest, is hyperbolical, so far as concerns the
passage before us. He had it in view, however, to reason, as it were,
from the greater to the less, in this manner. “Christ having put in
subjection to us *life* and *death*, and everything, can we doubt,
whether he has not also made men subject to us, to help us by their
ministrations — not to oppress us by tyranny.”

<span id="x.iv-p51"></span>Now if any one takes occasion from this to
allege, that the writings both of Paul and of Peter are subject to our
scrutiny, inasmuch as they were men, and are not exempted from the
common lot of others, I answer, that Paul, while he does not by any
means spare himself or Peter, admonishes the Corinthians to distinguish
between the person of the individual, and the dignity or distinction of
office. “As for myself, viewed as a man, I wish to be judged of simply
as a man, that Christ alone may have distinction in our ministry.” This,
however, in a general way, we must hold,  <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) that all who discharge the office of
the ministry, are *ours*, from the highest to the lowest, so that we are
at liberty to withhold our assent to their doctrine, until they show
that it is from Christ. For they must all be *tried*, (<span
id="x.iv-p52.2"></span>[1Jo 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001.md)<span
id="x.iv-p52.2"></span>,)and we must yield obedience to them, only when
they have satisfactorily shown themselves to be faithful servants of
Christ. Now as to Peter and Paul, this point being beyond all
controversy, and the Lord having furnished us with amply sufficient
evidence, that their doctrine has come forth from Him, when we receive
as an oracle from heaven, and venerate everything that they have
delivered to us, we hear not so much *them*, as Christ speaking in them.

<span id="x.iv-p53"></span><span id="x.iv-p53.1"></span>

<span id="x.iv-p54"></span>**23.** *Christ is God’s* This subjection
relates to Christ’s humanity, for by taking upon him our flesh, he
assumed “the form” and condition “of a servant,” that he might make
himself obedient to his Father in all things. (<span
id="x.iv-p54.1"></span>[Phil. 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008)<span id="x.iv-p54.1"></span>..md) And
assuredly, that we may cleave to God through him, it is necessary that
he have God as his *head* (<span id="x.iv-p54.2"></span>[1Co
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#003)<span id="x.iv-p54.2"></span>..md) We
must observe, however, with what intention Paul has added this. For he
admonishes us, that the sum of our felicity consists in this,  <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) that we are united to God who is the
chief good, and this is accomplished when we are gathered together under
the *head* that our heavenly Father has set over us. In the same sense
Christ said to his disciples,

<span id="x.iv-p56"></span>“Ye ought to rejoice, because I go to the
Father,  
for the Father is greater than I,” (<span id="x.iv-p56.2"></span>[Joh
14:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#028)<span id="x.iv-p56.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="x.iv-p57"></span>for there he set himself forth as the medium,
through which believers come to the original source of every blessing.
It is certain, that those are left destitute of that signal blessing,
who depart from the unity of the Head.  <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) Hence this order of things suits the
connection of the passage — that those subject themselves to Christ
alone, who desire to remain under God’s jurisdiction.

id="x.ii-p34.2"></span>[Galatians
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#027.md)<span id="x.ii-p34.2"></span>, to
the following effect: “<span id="x.ii-p34.3"></span>Respondeo, Paulum de
Sacramentis bifariam solere loqui. Dum negotium est cum hypocritis, qui
nudis signis superbiunt, tum concionatur, quam inanis ac nihili res sit
externum signum: et in praeposteram fiduciam fortiter invehitur. Quare?
non respicit Dei institutionem, sed impiorum corruptelam. Quum autem
fideles alloquitur, qui rite utuntur signis, illa tunc conjungit cum sua
veritate, quam figurant. Quare? neque enim fallacem pompam ostentat in
Sacramentis, sed quae externa ceremonia figurat, exhibet simul re ipsa.
Hinc fit, ut veritas, secundum Dei institutum, conjuncta sit cum
signis;” — “I answer, it is customary with Paul to speak of the
Sacraments in two different ways. When he has to do with hypocrites, who
glory in mere symbols, he in that case proclaims aloud the emptiness and
worthlessness of the outward symbol, and denounces in strong terms their
absurd confidence. Why so? It is because he has in view, not the
ordinance of God, but the corruption of it by wicked men. When, on the
other hand, he addresses believers, who make a proper use of the
symbols, he in that case views them in connection with the reality which
they represent. Why so? It is because he does not make a show of any
false splendor as belonging to the Sacraments, but presents before our
view in reality what the outward ceremony represents. Hence it comes
that, agreeably to the divine appointment, the reality is associated
with the symbols.” The same subject is touched upon in the *Institutes*,
volume 3. — *Ed*.
