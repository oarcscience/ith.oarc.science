<span id="xviii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 11

<span id="xviii.i"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p1"></span><span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>[1
Corinthians 11:1-16](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#001.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Be ye followers of me, even as I
also *am* of Christ.

<span id="xviii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Imitatores mei estote, sicut et ego
Christi.

<span id="xviii.i-p4"></span>**2.** Now I praise you, brethren, that ye
remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered
*them* to you.

<span id="xviii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Laudo autem vos, fratres, quod omnia
mea meministis et traditiones  <span id="fr_608"></span>[609](#fn_608.md)
tenetis, quemadmodum vobis tradidi.

<span id="xviii.i-p7"></span>**3.** But I would have you know, that the
head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman *is* the man; and
the head of Christ *is* God.

<span id="xviii.i-p8"></span>**3.** Volo autem vos scire, quod omnis
viri caput est Christus, caput autem mulieris, vir: caput autem Christi,
Deus.

<span id="xviii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Every man praying or prophesying,
having *his* head covered, dishonoureth his head.

<span id="xviii.i-p10"></span>**4.** Omnis vir orans aut prophetans
velato capite, dedecore afficit caput suum.

<span id="xviii.i-p11"></span>**5.** But every woman that prayeth or
prophesieth with *her* head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is
even all one as if she were shaven.

<span id="xviii.i-p12"></span>**5.** Omnis mulier orans aut prophetans
aperto capite, dedecore afticit caput suum: perinde enim acsi radatur.

<span id="xviii.i-p13"></span>**6.** For if the woman be not covered,
let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or
shaven, let her be covered.

<span id="xviii.i-p14"></span>**6.** Si enim non velatur mulier, etiam
tondeatur: si autem mulieri turpe est tonderi aut radi, veletur.

<span id="xviii.i-p15"></span>**7.** For a man indeed ought not to cover
*his* head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman
is the glory of the man.

<span id="xviii.i-p16"></span>**7.** Vir quidem velato esse capite non
debet, quum sit imago et gloria Dei: mulier autem gloria viri est.

<span id="xviii.i-p17"></span>**8.** For the man is not of the woman;
but the woman of the man.

<span id="xviii.i-p18"></span>**8.** Non enim est virex muliere, sed
mulier ex viro.

<span id="xviii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Neither was the man created for the
woman; but the woman for the man.

<span id="xviii.i-p20"></span>**9.** Etenim non est creatus vir mulieris
causa, sed mulier causa viri.

<span id="xviii.i-p21"></span>**10.** For this cause ought the woman to
have power on *her* head because of the angels.

<span id="xviii.i-p22"></span>**10.** Propterea debet mulier potestatem
habere super caput suum, propter angelos.

<span id="xviii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Nevertheless neither is the man
without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.

<span id="xviii.i-p24"></span>**11.** Caeterum neque vir absque muliere,
neque mulier absque viro in Domino.

<span id="xviii.i-p25"></span>**12.** For as the woman *is* of the man,
even so *is* the man also by the woman; but all things of God.

<span id="xviii.i-p26"></span>**12.** Quemadmodum enim mulier ex viro,
sic et vir per mulierem: olnnia autem ex Deo.

<span id="xviii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Judge in yourselves: is it comely
that a woman pray unto God uncovered?

<span id="xviii.i-p28"></span>**13.** In vobis ipsis iudicate, deceatne
mulierem retecto capite Deum precari.

<span id="xviii.i-p29"></span>**14.** Doth not even nature itself teach
you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?

<span id="xviii.i-p30"></span>**14.** An ne ipsa quidem natura vos
docet, quod si vir comam alat, dedecus illi sit?

<span id="xviii.i-p31"></span>**15.** But if a woman have long hair, it
is a glory to her: for *her* hair is given her for a covering.

<span id="xviii.i-p32"></span>**15.** Si vero mulier comam alat, gloria
sit illi? quoniam illi coma instar velamenti data est.

<span id="xviii.i-p33"></span>**16.** But if any man seem to be
contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.

<span id="xviii.i-p34"></span>**16.** Quodsi quis videtur contentiosus
esse, nos talem consuetudinem non habemus, neque Ecclesiae Dei.

<span id="xviii.i-p35"></span> 

<span id="xviii.i-p36"></span><span id="xviii.i-p36.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p37"></span>**1.** *Imitators of me.* From this it
appears, how absurdly chapters are divided, inasmuch as this sentence is
disjoined from what goes before, with which it ought to have been
connected, and is joined to what follows, with which it has no
connection. Let us view this, then, as the close of the preceding
chapter. Paul had there brought forward his own example in confirmation
of his doctrine. Now, in order that the Corinthians may understand that
this would be becoming in them, he exhorts them to *imitate* what he had
done, *even as he had imitated Christ*

<span id="xviii.i-p38"></span>Here there are two things to be observed —
first, that he prescribes nothing to others that he had not first
practiced himself; and, secondly, that he directs himself and others to
Christ as the only pattern of right acting. For while it is the part of
a good teacher to enjoin nothing in words but what he is prepared to
practice in action, he must not, at the same time, be so austere, as
straightway to require from others everything that he does himself, as
is the manner of the superstitious. For everything that they contract a
liking for they impose also upon others, and would have their own
example to be held absolutely as a rule. The world is also, of its own
accord, inclined to a misdirected imitation, (<span
id="xviii.i-p38.1"></span>κακοζηλίαν)  <span
id="fr_609"></span>[610](#fn_609.md) and, after the manner of apes, strive
to copy whatever they see done by persons of great influence. We see,
however how many evils have been introduced into the Church by this
absurd desire of imitating all the actions of the saints, without
exception. Let us, therefore, maintain so much the more carefully this
doctrine of Paul — that we are to follow men, provided they take Christ
as their grand model, (<span id="xviii.i-p39.3"></span>πρωτότυπον,) that
the examples of the saints may not tend to lead us away from Christ, but
rather to direct us to him.

<span id="xviii.i-p40"></span><span id="xviii.i-p40.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p41"></span>**2.** *Now I praise you* *He* passes on
now to another subject-to instruct the Corinthians, what decorum ought
to be observed in the sacred assemblies. For as a man’s dress or gesture
has in some cases the effect of disfiguring, and in others of adorning
him, so all actions are set off to advantage by decorum, and are
vitiated by the want of it. Much, therefore, depends upon decorum (<span
id="xviii.i-p41.1"></span>τὸ πρεπον,)  <span
id="fr_610"></span>[611](#fn_610.md) and that not merely for securing for
our actions gracefulness and beauty, but also to accustom our minds to
propriety. While this is true in a general way as to everything, it
holds especially as to sacred things;  <span
id="fr_611"></span>[612](#fn_611.md) for what contempt, and, eventually,
what barbarism will be incurred, if we do not preserve dignity in the
Church, by conducting ourselves honorably and becomingly? Hence he
prescribes some things that are connected with public order, by which
sacred assemblies are rendered honorable. But in order to prepare them
the more for obedience, he commends, in the outset, their obedience in
the past, inasmuch as they observed his ordinances; for inasmuch as he
*had begotten* that Church to the Lord, (<span
id="xviii.i-p43.2"></span>[1Co
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015)<span id="xviii.i-p43.2"></span>,.md)
he had delivered to them a certain system, by which it was to be
governed. By retaining this, the Corinthians gave reason to hope, that
they would also in future be docile.

<span id="xviii.i-p44"></span>It is surprising, however, that, while he
now bestows upon them this commendation, he had previously blamed them
for many things. Nay more, if we consider the state of the Church, such
as has been previously described, they were far from deserving this
praise. I answer, that there were some that were infected with those
vices which he had previously reproved, and indeed, some with one,
others with another; but, in the meantime, the form which he had
prescribed to them had been retained by the entire body. For there is
nothing of inconsistency in saying, that very many sins, and of various
kinds, prevail among a particular people — some cheating, others
plundering — some envying, others quarrelling, and another class guilty
of fornication — while, at the same time, in respect of the public form
of the Church, the institutions of Christ and his Apostles are
maintained.

<span id="xviii.i-p45"></span>This will appear more clearly when we come
to see what Paul means by <span id="xviii.i-p45.1"></span>παραδόσεις;
(traditions;)  <span id="fr_612"></span>[613](#fn_612.md) and independently
of this, it is necessary to speak of this word, for the purpose of
replying to Papists, who arm themselves with this passage for the
purpose of defending their traditions. It is a common maxim among them,
that the doctrine of the Apostles consists partly of writings and partly
of traditions. Under this *second* department they include not merely
certain foolish superstitions, and puerile ceremonies, with which they
are stuffed, but also all kinds of gross abomination, directly contrary
to the plain word of God, and their tyrannical laws, which are mere
torments to men’s consciences. In this way there is nothing that is so
foolish, nothing so absurd — in fine, nothing so monstrous, as not to
have shelter under this pretext, and to be painted over with this
varnish. As Paul, therefore, makes mention here of *traditions*, they
seize, as they are accustomed to do, upon this little word, with the
view of making Paul the author of all those abominations, which we set
aside by plain declaration of Scripture.

<span id="xviii.i-p47"></span>I do not deny, that there were certain
traditions  <span id="fr_613"></span>[614](#fn_613.md) of the Apostles that
were not committed to writing, but I do not admit that they were parts
of doctrine, or related to things necessary for salvation. What then?
They were connected with order and government. For we know that every
Church has liberty to frame for itself a form of government that is
suitable and profitable for it, because the Lord has not prescribed
anything definite. Thus Paul, the first founder of the Corinthian
Church, had also framed for its regulation pious and seemly enactments —
that *all things might be done decently and in order*, as he afterwards
enjoins. (<span id="xviii.i-p48.2"></span>[1Co
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p48.2"></span>.) But what has this to do with those silly
trifles of ceremonies, which are to be seen in Popery?  <span
id="fr_614"></span>[615](#fn_614.md) What has it to do with a worse than
Jewish superstition? What has it to do with a tyranny worthy of
Phalaris,  <span id="fr_615"></span>[616](#fn_615.md) by which they torture
miserable consciences? What has it to do with so many monstrous rites of
idolatry? For the foundation of all right enactment was this: to observe
the moderation that Paul made use of — not to compel persons to follow
their enactments,  <span id="fr_616"></span>[617](#fn_616.md) while, in the
meantime, contriving everything that might strike their fancy, but to
require that they should be *imitated, in so far as they are imitators
of Christ* But now, after having had the audacity to criticize
everything agreeably to their own humor, to demand obedience from all is
exceedingly absurd. Farther, we must know that Paul commends their
obedience in the past, in order that he may render them docile also for
the time to come.

<span id="xviii.i-p52"></span><span id="xviii.i-p52.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p53"></span>**3.** *But I would have you know* It is
an old proverb: “Evil manners beget good laws.”  <span
id="fr_617"></span>[618](#fn_617.md) As the rite here treated of had not
been previously called in question, Paul had given no enactment
respecting it.  <span id="fr_618"></span>[619](#fn_618.md) The error of the
Corinthians was the occasion of his showing, what part it was becoming
to act in this matter. With the view of proving, that it is an unseemly
thing for women to appear in a public assembly with their heads
uncovered, and, on the other hand, for men to pray or prophesy with
their heads *covered*, he sets out with noticing the arrangements that
are divinely established.

<span id="xviii.i-p56"></span>He says, that *as Christ is subject to God
as his head, so is the man subject to Christ, and the woman to the man*
We shall afterwards see, how he comes to infer from this, that women
ought to have their heads covered. Let us, for the present, take notice
of those four gradations which he points out. God, then, occupies the
*first* place: Christ holds the *second* place. How so? Inasmuch as he
has in our flesh made himself subject to the Father, for, apart from
this, being of one essence with the Father, he is his equal. Let us,
therefore, bear it in mind, that this is spoken of Christ as mediator.
He is, I say, inferior to the Father, inasmuch as he assumed our nature,
*that he might be the first-born among many brethren.*

<span id="xviii.i-p57"></span>There is somewhat more of difficulty in
what follows. Here the man is placed in an intermediate position between
Christ and the woman, so that Christ is not the head of the woman. Yet
the same Apostle teaches us elsewhere, (<span
id="xviii.i-p57.1"></span>[Ga
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#028)<span id="xviii.i-p57.1"></span>,.md)
that *in Christ there is neither male nor female*. Why then does he make
a distinction here, which in that passage he does away with? I answer,
that the solution of this depends on the connection in which the
passages occur. When he says that there is no difference between the man
and the woman, he is treating of Christ’s spiritual kingdom, in which
individual distinctions  <span id="fr_619"></span>[620](#fn_619.md) are not
regarded, or made any account of; for it has nothing to do with the
body, and has nothing to do with the outward relationships of mankind,
but has to do solely with the mind — on which account he *declares* that
there is no difference, even between *bond* and *free*. In the meantime,
however, he does not disturb civil order or honorary distinctions, which
cannot be dispensed with in ordinary life. Here, on the other hand, he
reasons respecting outward propriety and decorum — which is a part of
ecclesiastical polity. Hence, as regards spiritual connection in the
sight of God, and inwardly in the conscience, Christ is the head of the
man and of the woman without any distinction, because, as to that, there
is no regard paid to male or female; but as regards external arrangement
and political decorum, the man follows Christ and the woman the man, so
that they are not upon the same footing, but, on the contrary, this
inequality exists. Should any one ask, what connection marriage has with
Christ, I answer, that Paul speaks here of that sacred union of pious
persons, of which Christ is the officiating priest,  <span
id="fr_620"></span>[621](#fn_620.md) and He in whose name it is
consecrated.

<span id="xviii.i-p60"></span><span id="xviii.i-p60.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p61"></span>**4.** *Every man praying* Here there are
two propositions. The first relates to the *man*, the other to the
*woman* He says that the *man* commits an offense against Christ his
head, if he *prays or prophesies with his head covered.* Why so? Because
he is subject to Christ, with this understanding, that he is to hold the
first place in the government of the house — for the father of the
family is like a king in his own house. Hence the glory of God shines
forth in him, in consequence of the authority with which he is invested.
If he covers his head, he lets himself down from that preeminence which
God had assigned to him, so as to be in subjection. Thus the honor of
Christ is infringed upon. For example,  <span
id="fr_621"></span>[622](#fn_621.md) If the person whom the prince has
appointed as his lieutenant, does not know how to maintain his proper
station,  <span id="fr_622"></span>[623](#fn_622.md) and instead of this,
exposes his dignity to contempt on the part of persons in the lowest
station, does he not bring dishonor upon his prince? In like manner, if
the *man* does not keep his own station — if he is not subject to Christ
in such a way as to preside over his own family with authority, he
obscures, to that extent, the glory of Christ, which shines forth in the
well regulated order of marriage. The *covering*, as we shall see ere
long, is an emblem of authority intermediate and interposed.

<span id="xviii.i-p64"></span>*Prophesying* I take here to mean —
declaring the mysteries of God for the edification of the hearers, (as
afterwards in <span id="xviii.i-p64.1"></span>[1 Cor.
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#003.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#012.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016.md),
[26](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#026)<span id="xviii.i-p64.1"></span>,.md)
as *praying* means preparing a form of prayer, and taking the lead, as
it were, of all the people — which is the part of the public teacher,
 <span id="fr_623"></span>[624](#fn_623.md) for Paul is not arguing here as
to every kind of prayer, but as to solemn prayer in public. Let us,
however, bear in mind, that in this matter the error is merely in so far
as decorum is violated, and the distinction of rank which God has
established, is broken in upon. For we must not be so scrupulous as to
look upon it as a criminal thing for a teacher to have a cap on his
head, when addressing the people from the pulpit. Paul means nothing
more than this — that it should appear that the man has authority, and
that the woman is under subjection, and this is secured when the man
uncovers his head in the view of the Church, though he should afterwards
put on his cap again from fear of catching cold. In fine, the *one* rule
to be observed here is <span id="xviii.i-p65.2"></span>το πρέπον —
*decorum* If *that* is secured, Paul requires nothing farther.

<span id="xviii.i-p66"></span><span id="xviii.i-p66.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p67"></span>**5.** *Every woman praying or
prophesying* Here we have the *second* proposition — that women ought
*to have their heads covered* when they *pray* or *prophesy*; otherwise
they *dishonor their head* For as the *man* honors his head by showing
his liberty, so the *woman*, by showing her subjection. Hence, on the
other hand, if the woman uncovers her head, she shakes off subjection —
involving contempt of her husband. It may seem, however, to be
superfluous for Paul to forbid the woman to prophesy with her head
uncovered, while elsewhere he wholly

<span id="xviii.i-p68"></span>prohibits women from speaking in the
Church.  
(<span id="xviii.i-p68.2"></span>[1Ti
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#012)<span id="xviii.i-p68.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xviii.i-p69"></span>It would not, therefore, be allowable for
them to prophesy even with a covering upon their head, and hence it
follows that it is to no purpose that he argues here as to a covering.
It may be replied, that the Apostle, by here condemning the one, does
not commend the other. For when he reproves them for prophesying with
their head uncovered, he at the same time does not give them permission
to prophesy in some other way, but rather delays his condemnation of
that vice to another passage, namely in <span
id="xviii.i-p69.1"></span>[1Co
14:34-36;](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#034.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p69.1"></span>. In this reply there is nothing amiss, though
at the same time it might suit sufficiently well to say, that the
Apostle requires women to show their modesty — not merely in a place in
which the whole Church is assembled, but also in any more dignified
assembly, either of matrons or of men, such as are sometimes convened in
private houses.

<span id="xviii.i-p70"></span>*For it is all one as if she were shaven.*
He now maintains from other considerations, that it is unseemly for
women to have their heads bare. *Nature itself*, says he, abhors it. To
see a woman shaven is a spectacle that is disgusting and monstrous.
Hence we infer that the woman *has her hair given her for a covering*
Should any one now object, that her hair is enough, as being a natural
covering, Paul says that it is *not*, for it is such a covering as
requires another thing to be made use of for covering *it* And hence a
conjecture is drawn, with some appearance of probability — that women
who had beautiful hair were accustomed to uncover their heads for the
purpose of showing off their beauty. It is not, therefore, without good
reason that Paul, as a remedy for this vice, sets before them the
opposite idea — that they be regarded as remarkable for unseemliness,
rather than for what is an incentive to lust.  <span
id="fr_624"></span>[625](#fn_624.md)

<span id="xviii.i-p72"></span><span id="xviii.i-p72.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p73"></span>**7.** *The man ought not to cover his
head, because he is the image* The same question may now be proposed
respecting the *image*, as formerly respecting the *head.* For both
sexes were created in the image of God, and Paul exhorts women no less
than men to be formed anew, according to that image. The *image*,
however, of which he is now speaking, relates to the order of marriage,
and hence it belongs to the present life, and is not connected with
conscience. The simple solution is this — that he does not treat here of
innocence and holiness, which are equally becoming in men and women, but
of the distinction, which God has conferred upon the man, so as to have
superiority over the woman. In this superior order of dignity the glory
of God is seen, as it shines forth in every kind of superiority.

<span id="xviii.i-p74"></span>*The woman is the glory of the man* There
is no doubt that the woman is a distinguished ornament of the man; for
it is a great honor that God has appointed her to the man as the partner
of his life, and a helper to him,  <span
id="fr_625"></span>[626](#fn_625.md) and has made her subject to him as the
body is to the head. For what Solomon affirms as to a careful wife —
that *she is a crown to her husband*, (<span
id="xviii.i-p75.2"></span>[Pr
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#004)<span id="xviii.i-p75.2"></span>,.md)
is true of the whole sex, if we look to the appointment of God, which
Paul here commends, showing that the woman was created for this purpose
— that she might be a distinguished ornament of the man.

<span id="xviii.i-p76"></span><span id="xviii.i-p76.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p77"></span>**8.** *For the man is not from the
woman.* He establishes by *two* arguments the pre-eminence, which he had
assigned to men above women. The *first* is, that as the woman derives
her origin from the man, she is therefore inferior in rank. The *second*
is, that as the woman was created for the sake of the man, she is
therefore subject to him, as the work ultimately produced is to its
cause.  <span id="fr_626"></span>[627](#fn_626.md) That the man is the
beginning of the woman and the end for which she was made, is evident
from the law. (<span id="xviii.i-p78.2"></span>[Ge
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#018)<span id="xviii.i-p78.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xviii.i-p79"></span>It is not good for a man to be alone. Let
us make for him, etc.

<span id="xviii.i-p80"></span>Farther,

<span id="xviii.i-p81"></span>God took one of Adam’s ribs and formed
Eve.  
(<span id="xviii.i-p81.2"></span>[Gen.
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#022)<span id="xviii.i-p81.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xviii.i-p82"></span><span id="xviii.i-p82.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p83"></span>**10.** *For this cause ought the woman to
have power*  <span id="fr_627"></span>[628](#fn_627.md) From that authority
he draws an argument  <span id="fr_628"></span>[629](#fn_628.md) in favor
of outward decorum. “She is subject,” says he, “let her then wear a
token of subjection.” In the term *power*, there is an instance of
metonymy,  <span id="fr_629"></span>[630](#fn_629.md) for he means a token
by which she declares herself to be under the power of her husband; and
it is a covering, whether it be a robe, or a veil,  <span
id="fr_630"></span>[631](#fn_630.md) or any other kind of covering.  <span
id="fr_631"></span>[632](#fn_631.md)

<span id="xviii.i-p89"></span>It is asked, whether he speaks of
*married* women exclusively, for there are some that restrict to *them*
what Paul here teaches, on the ground that it does not belong to virgins
to be under the authority of a husband. It is however a mistake, for
Paul looks beyond this — to God’s eternal law, which has made the female
sex subject to the authority of men. On this account all women are born,
that they may acknowledge themselves inferior in consequence of the
superiority of the male sex. Otherwise it were an inconclusive argument
that Paul has drawn from *nature*, in saying that it were not one whit
more seemly for a woman to *have her head uncovered* than to be *shaven*
— this being applicable to virgins also.

<span id="xviii.i-p90"></span>*Because of the angels* This passage is
explained in various ways. As the Prophet <span
id="xviii.i-p90.1"></span>[Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007.md)<span id="xviii.i-p90.1"></span>
calls priests *angels of God*, some are of opinion that Paul speaks of
*them*; but the ministers of the word have nowhere that term applied to
them by itself — that is, without something being added; and the meaning
would be too forced. I understand it, therefore, in its proper
signification. But it is asked, why it is that he would have women have
their heads covered *because of the angels* — for what has this to do
with them? Some answer: “Because they are present on occasion of the
prayers of believers, and on this account are spectators of
unseemliness, should there be any on such occasions.” But what need is
there for philosophizing with such refinement? We know that angels are
in attendance, also, upon Christ as their head, and minister to him.
 <span id="fr_632"></span>[633](#fn_632.md) When, therefore, women venture
upon such liberties, as to usurp for themselves the token of authority,
they make their baseness manifest to the angels. This, therefore, was
said by way of amplifying, as if he had said, “If women uncover their
heads, not only Christ, but all the angels too, will be witnesses of the
outrage.” And this interpretation suits well with the Apostle’s design.
He is treating here of different ranks. Now he says that, when women
assume a higher place than becomes them, they gain this by it — that
they discover their impudence in the view of the angels of heaven.

<span id="xviii.i-p92"></span><span id="xviii.i-p92.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p93"></span>**11.** *But neither is the man without
the woman* This is added partly as a check upon men, that they may not
insult over women;  <span id="fr_633"></span>[634](#fn_633.md) and partly
as a consolation to women, that they may not feel dissatisfied with
being under subjection. “The male sex (says he) has a distinction over
the female sex, with this understanding, that they ought to be connected
together by mutual benevolence, for the one cannot do without the other.
If they be separated, they are like the mutilated members of a mangled
body. Let them, therefore, be connected with each other by the bond of
mutual duty.”  <span id="fr_634"></span>[635](#fn_634.md)

<span id="xviii.i-p96"></span>When he says, *in the Lord*, he by this
expression calls the attention of believers to the appointment of the
Lord, while the wicked look to nothing beyond pressing necessity.  <span
id="fr_635"></span>[636](#fn_635.md) For profane men, if they can
conveniently live unmarried, despise the whole sex, and do not consider
that they are under obligations to it by the appointment and decree of
God. The pious, on the other hand, acknowledge that the male sex is but
the half of the human race. They ponder the meaning of that statement —
*God created man*: *male and female created he them* (<span
id="xviii.i-p97.2"></span>[Ge
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#027.md)<span id="xviii.i-p97.2"></span>,
and <span id="xviii.i-p97.3"></span>[Ge
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen005.htm#002)<span id="xviii.i-p97.3"></span>..md)
Thus they, of their own accord, acknowledge themselves to be debtors to
the weaker sex. Pious women, in like manner, reflect upon their
obligation.  <span id="fr_636"></span>[637](#fn_636.md) Thus the man has no
standing without the woman, for that would be the head severed from the
body; nor has the woman without the man, for that were a body without a
head. “Let, therefore, the man perform to the woman the office of the
head in respect of ruling her, and let the woman perform to the man the
office of the body in respect of assisting him, and that not merely in
the married state, but also in celibacy; for I do not speak of
cohabitation merely, but also of civil offices, for which there is
occasion even in the unmarried state.” If you are inclined rather to
refer this to the whole sex in general, I do not object to this, though,
as Paul directs his discourse to individuals, he appears to point out
the particular duty of each.

<span id="xviii.i-p99"></span><span id="xviii.i-p99.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p100"></span>**12.** *As the woman is of the man* If
this is one of the reasons, why the man has superiority — that the woman
was taken out of him, there will be, in like manner, this motive to
friendly connection — that the male sex cannot maintain and preserve
itself without the aid of women. For this remains a settled point — that
*it is not good for man to be alone* (<span
id="xviii.i-p100.1"></span>[Ge
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#018.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p100.1"></span>.) This statement of Paul may, it is true, be
viewed as referring to propagation, because human beings are propagated
not by men alone, but by men and women; but I understand it as meaning
this also — that the woman is a needful help to the man, inasmuch as a
solitary life is not expedient for man. This decree of God exhorts us to
cultivate mutual intercourse.

<span id="xviii.i-p101"></span>*But all things of God* God is the Source
of both sexes, and hence both of them ought with humility to accept and
maintain the condition which the Lord has assigned to them. Let the
*man* exercise his authority with moderation, and not insult over the
woman who has been given him as his partner. Let the *woman* be
satisfied with her state of subjection, and not take it amiss that she
is made inferior to the more distinguished sex. Otherwise they will both
of them throw off the yoke of God, who has not without good reason
appointed this distinction of ranks. Farther, when it is said that the
man and the woman, when they are wanting in their duty to each other,
are rebels against the authority of God, the statement is a more serious
one than if Paul had said, that they do injury to one another.

<span id="xviii.i-p102"></span>*Doth not even nature itself* He again
sets forth *nature* as the mistress of decorum, and what was at that
time in common use by universal consent and custom — even among the
Greeks — he speaks of as being *natural*, for it was not always reckoned
a disgrace for men to have long hair.  <span
id="fr_637"></span>[638](#fn_637.md) Historical records bear, that in all
countries in ancient times, that is, in the first ages, men wore long
hair. Hence also the poets, in speaking of the ancients, are accustomed
to apply to them the common epithet of *unshorn*  <span
id="fr_638"></span>[639](#fn_638.md) It was not until a late period that
barbers began to be employed at Rome — about the time of Africanus the
elder. And at the time when Paul wrote these things, the practice of
having the hair shorn had not yet come into use in the provinces of Gaul
or in Germany. Nay more, it would have been reckoned an unseemly thing
for men, no less than for women, to be shorn or shaven; but as in Greece
it was reckoned all unbecoming thing for a man to allow his hair to grow
long, so that those who did so were remarked as effeminate, he reckons
as *nature* a custom that had come to be confirmed.  <span
id="fr_639"></span>[640](#fn_639.md)

<span id="xviii.i-p106"></span><span id="xviii.i-p106.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p107"></span>**16.** *But if any man seem* A
*contentious* person is one whose humor inclines him to stir up
disputes, and does not care what becomes of the truth. Of this
description are all who, without any necessity, abolish good and useful
customs — raise disputes respecting matters that are not doubtful — who
do not yield to reasonings — who cannot endure that any one should be
above them. Of this description, also, are those (<span
id="xviii.i-p107.1"></span>ἀκοινώνητοι) would be singular persons  <span
id="fr_640"></span>[641](#fn_640.md) who, from a foolish affectation,
 <span id="fr_641"></span>[642](#fn_641.md) aim at some new and unusual way
of acting. Such persons Paul does not reckon worthy of being replied to,
inasmuch as contention is a pernicious thing, and ought, therefore, to
be banished from the Churches. By this he teaches us, that those that
are obstinate and fond of quarrelling, should rather be restrained by
authority than confuted by lengthened disputations. For you will never
have an end of contentions, if you are disposed to contend with a
combative person until you have vanquished him; for though vanquished a
hundred times, he would argue still. Let us therefore carefully mark
this passage, that we may not allow ourselves to be carried away with
needless disputations, provided at the same time we know how to
distinguish *contentious* persons. For we must not always reckon as
*contentious* the man who does not acquiesce in our decisions, or who
ventures to contradict us; but when temper and obstinacy show
themselves, let us then say with Paul, that *contentions are at variance
with the custom of the Church*  <span id="fr_642"></span>[643](#fn_642.md)

<span id="xviii.ii-p15"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p16"></span>His reproof of the fault previously
noticed was but a mild and gentle admonition, because the Corinthians
sinned in ignorance, so that it was proper that they should readily be
forgiven. Paul, too, had praised them in the outset, because they had
faithfully *kept his enactments*. (<span id="xviii.ii-p16.1"></span>[1Co
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#002.md)<span
id="xviii.ii-p16.1"></span>.) Now he begins to reprove them more
sharply, because they offended more grievously in some things, and not
through ignorance.

<span id="xviii.ii-p17"></span>17. *But, in warning you as to this, I do
not praise.*  <span id="fr_643"></span>[644](#fn_643.md) For I translate it
in this way, because Paul appears to have made the participle and the
verb change places.  <span id="fr_644"></span>[645](#fn_644.md) I am also
not satisfied with the interpretation of Erasmus, who takes <span
id="xviii.ii-p19.2"></span>παραγγέλλειν as meaning to *command* The verb
to *warn* would suit better, but as to this I do not contend. There is
an antithesis between this clause and the beginning of this chapter.
“While I have praised you, do not think that it is unqualified
commendation; for I have something to find fault with, as it is worthy
of severe reproof.” This, however, in my opinion, does not refer
exclusively to the Lord’s Supper, but also to other faults of which he
makes mention. Let this then be taken as a general statement, that the
Corinthians are reproved, because they *came together not for the better
but for the worse.* Particular effects of this evil will be brought
forward afterwards.

<span id="xviii.ii-p20"></span>He finds fault with them, then, in the
*first* place, because they *come not together for the better*, — and
*secondly*, that they *come together for the worse* The *second*, it is
true, is the more serious, but even the *first* is not to be endured,
for if we consider what is transacted in the Church, there ought never
to be a *coming together* without some fruit. *There* the doctrine of
God is listened to, prayers are offered up, the Sacraments are
administered. The fruit of the Word is, when confidence in God and fear
of him are increased in us — when progress is made in holiness of life —
when we put off more and more the *old man*, (<span
id="xviii.ii-p20.1"></span>[Col
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#009)<span id="xviii.ii-p20.1"></span>.md)
— when we advance in *newness of life*, etc. (<span
id="xviii.ii-p20.2"></span>[Ro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)<span id="xviii.ii-p20.2"></span>..md)
The Sacraments have a tendency to exercise us in piety and love. The
prayers, too, ought to be of use for promoting all these purposes. In
addition to this, the Lord works efficaciously by his Spirit, because he
wills not that his ordinances should be vain. Hence if the sacred
assemblies are of no benefit to us, and we are not made better by them,
it is our ingratitude that is to blame, and therefore we deserve to be
reproved. For the effect of our conduct is, that those things, which,
from their own nature, and from God’s appointment, ought to have been
salutary, become unprofitable.

<span id="xviii.ii-p21"></span>Then follows the *second* fault — that
they *come together for the worse.* This is much more criminal, and yet
it almost always follows the other, for if we derive no advantage from
God’s benefits, he employs this method of punishing our carelessness —
that we are *made worse* by them. It usually happens, too, that
negligence gives birth to many corruptions, especially on this account,
that those who do not observe the natural use of things usually fall
erelong into hurtful inventions.  <span
id="fr_645"></span>[646](#fn_645.md)

<span id="xviii.ii-p23"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p24"></span>**18.** *When ye come together in the
Church, I hear there are divisions* Some take the words *divisions* and
*heresies*, as referring to that disorder (<span
id="xviii.ii-p24.1"></span>ἀταξίαν) of which he speaks soon afterwards.
I consider them as having a more extensive signification, and certainly
it is not likely that he would employ terms so improper and unsuitable
for the purpose of exposing that abuse.  <span
id="fr_646"></span>[647](#fn_646.md) For as to their alleging that he has
expressed himself in more severe terms, with the view of exposing more
fully the heinousness of the offense, I would readily grant this, if the
meaning corresponded. It is, then, a reproof of a general kind — that
they were not of one accord as becomes Christians, but every one was so
much taken up with his own interests, that he was not prepared to
accommodate himself to others. Hence arose that abuse, as to which we
shall see in a little — hence sprung ambition and pride, so that every
one exalted himself and despised others — hence sprung carelessness as
to edification — hence sprung profanation of the gifts of God.

<span id="xviii.ii-p26"></span>He says that he *partly believes it*,
that they might not think that he charged them all with this heinous
crime, and might accordingly complain, that they were groundlessly
accused. In the meantime, however, he intimates that this had been
brought to him not by mere vague rumor, but by credible information,
such as he could not altogether discredit.

<span id="xviii.ii-p27"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p28"></span>**19.** *For there must be also heresies*
He had previously spoken of *divisions* (<span
id="xviii.ii-p28.1"></span>[1Co
11:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#018.md)<span
id="xviii.ii-p28.1"></span>.) Now he uses the term *heresies*, with the
view of amplifying the more, as we may infer, too, from the word *also*,
for it is added for the sake of amplification. (<span
id="xviii.ii-p28.2"></span>προς αὔξησιν.) It is well known in what sense
the ancients used those two terms,  <span
id="fr_647"></span>[648](#fn_647.md) and what distinction they made between
Heretics and Schismatics.  <span id="fr_648"></span>[649](#fn_648.md)
*Heresy* they made to consist in disagreement as to doctrine, and
*schism*, on the contrary, in alienation of affection, as when any one
withdrew from the Church from envy, or from dislike of the pastors, or
from ill nature. It is true, that the Church cannot but be torn asunder
by false doctrine, and thus heresy is the root and origin of schism, and
it is also true that envy or pride is the mother of almost all heresies,
but at the same time it is of advantage to distinguish in this way
between these two terms.

<span id="xviii.ii-p31"></span>But let us see in what sense Paul employs
them. I have already expressed my disapprobation of those who explain
heresy as meaning the setting up of a separate table, inasmuch as the
rich did not partake of their Supper along with the poor; for he had it
in view to point out something more hateful. But without mentioning the
opinions of others, I take *schism* and *heresy* here in the way of less
and greater. Schisms, then, are either secret grudges — when we do not
see that agreement which ought to subsist among the pious — when
inclinations at variance with each other are at work — when every one is
mightily pleased with his own way, and finds fault with everything that
is done by others. *Heresies* are when the evil proceeds to such a pitch
that open hostility is discovered, and persons deliberately divide
themselves into opposite parties. Hence, in order that believers might
not feel discouraged on seeing the Corinthians torn with *divisions*,
the Apostle turns round this occasion of offense in an opposite
direction, intimating that the Lord does rather by such trials make
proof of his people’s constancy. A lovely consolation! “So far, says he,
should we be from being troubled, or cast down, when we do not see
complete unity in the Church, but on the contrary some threatenings of
separation from want of proper agreement, that even if sects should
start up,  <span id="fr_649"></span>[650](#fn_649.md) we ought to remain
firm and constant. For in this way hypocrites are detected — in this
way, on the other hand, the sincerity of believers is tried. For as this
gives occasion for discovering the fickleness of those who were not
rooted in the Lord’s Word, and the wickedness of those who had assumed
the appearance of good men, so the good afford a more signal
manifestation of their constancy and sincerity.”

<span id="xviii.ii-p33"></span>But observe what Paul says — *there must
be,* for he intimates by this expression, that this state of matters
does not happen by chance, but by the sure providence of God, because he
has it in view to try his people, as gold in the furnace, and if it is
agreeable to the mind of God, it is, consequently, expedient. At the
same time, however, we must not enter into thorny disputes, or rather
into labyrinths as to a fatal necessity. We know that there never will
be a time when there will not be many reprobates. We know that they are
governed by the spirit of Satan, and are effectually drawn away to what
is evil. We know that Satan, in his activity, leaves no stone unturned
with the view of breaking up the unity of the Church. From this — not
from fate — comes that necessity of which Paul makes mention.  <span
id="fr_650"></span>[651](#fn_650.md) We know, also, that the Lord, by his
admirable wisdom, turns Satan’s deadly machinations so as to promote the
salvation of believers.  <span id="fr_651"></span>[652](#fn_651.md) Hence
comes that design of which he speaks — *that the good may shine forth
more conspicuously*; for we ought not to ascribe this advantage to
*heresies*, which, being evil, can produce nothing but what is evil, but
to God, who, by his infinite goodness, changes the nature of things, so
that those things are salutary to the elect, which Satan had contrived
for their ruin. As to Chrysostom’s contending that the particle *that*
(<span id="xviii.ii-p35.2"></span>ἴνα) denotes not the cause, but the
event, it is of no great moment. For the cause is the secret counsel of
God,  <span id="fr_652"></span>[653](#fn_652.md) by which things that are
evil are overruled in such a manner, as to have a good issue. We know,
in fine, that the wicked are impelled by Satan in such a manner, that
they both act and are acted upon with the consent of their wills.  <span
id="fr_653"></span>[654](#fn_653.md) Hence they are without excuse.

<span id="xviii.ii-p38"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p39"></span>**20.** *This is not to eat the Lord’s
supper* He now reproves the abuse that had crept in among the
Corinthians as to the Lord’s Supper, in respect of their mixing up
profane banquets with the sacred and spiritual feast, and that too with
contempt of the poor. Paul says, that in this way it is not *the Lord’s
supper* that is partaken of — not that a single abuse altogether set
aside the sacred institution of Christ, and reduced it to nothing, but
that they polluted the sacrament by observing it in a wrong way. For we
are accustomed to say, in common conversation, that a thing is not done
at all, if it is not done aright. Now this was no trivial abuse, as we
shall afterwards see. If you understand the words *is not* as meaning,
*is not allowable*,  <span id="fr_654"></span>[655](#fn_654.md) the meaning
will amount to the same thing — that the Corinthians were not in a state
of preparation for partaking of *the Lord’s* supper, as being in so
divided a state. What I stated a little ago, however, is more simple —
that he condemns that profane admixture, which had nothing in it akin to
the Lord’s Supper.

<span id="xviii.ii-p41"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p41.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p42"></span>**21.** *For every one of you taketh
before others his own supper.* It is truly wonderful, and next to a
miracle,  <span id="fr_655"></span>[656](#fn_655.md) that Satan could have
accomplished so much in so short a time. We are, however, admonished by
this instance, how much antiquity, without reason on its side, can
effect, or, in other words, how much influence a long continued custom
has, while not sanctioned by a single declaration of the word of God.
This, having become customary, was looked upon as lawful. Paul was then
at hand to interfere. What then must have been the state of matters
after the death of the Apostles? With what liberty Satan must have
sported himself.  <span id="fr_656"></span>[657](#fn_656.md) Yet here is
the great strength of Papists: “The thing is ancient — it was done long
ago — let it, therefore, have the weight of a revelation from heaven.”

<span id="xviii.ii-p45"></span>It is uncertain, however, what was the
origin of this abuse, or what was the occasion of its springing up so
soon. Chrysostom is of opinion, that it originated in the love-feasts,
 <span id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) (<span
id="xviii.ii-p46.2"></span>ἀπὸ τῶν ἀγαπῶν) and that, while the rich had
been accustomed  <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) to bring with
them from their houses the means of feasting with the poor
indiscriminately and in common, they afterwards began to exclude the
poor, and to guzzle over their delicacies by themselves. And, certainly,
it appears from Tertullian, that that custom was a very ancient one.
 <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) Now they gave the name of
*Agapae*  <span id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) to those common
entertainments, which they contrived among themselves, as being tokens
of fraternal affection, and consisted of alms. Nor have I any doubt,
that it took its rise from sacrificial rites commonly observed both by
Jews and Gentiles. For I observe that Christians, for the most part,
corrected the faults connected with those rites, in such a manner, as to
retain at the same time some resemblance. Hence it is probable, that, on
observing that both Jews and Gentiles added a feast to their sacrifice,
as an appendage to it, but that both of them sinned in respect of
ambition, luxury, and intemperance, they instituted  <span
id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md) a kind of banquet, which might
accustom them rather to sobriety and frugality,  <span
id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) and might, at the same time, be in
accordance with a spiritual entertainment in respect of mutual
fellowship. For in it the poor were entertained at the expense of the
rich, and the table was open to all. But, whether they had from the very
first fallen into this profane abuse, or whether an institution,
otherwise not so objectionable, had in this way degenerated in process
of time, Paul would have them in no way mix up this spiritual banquet
with common feasts. “This, indeed, looks well — that the poor along with
the rich partake in common of the provisions that have been brought, and
that the rich share of their abundance along with the needy, but nothing
ought to have such weight with us as to lead us to profane the holy
sacrament.”  <span id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md)

<span id="xviii.ii-p53"></span>*And one is hungry* This was one evil in
the case, that while the rich indulged themselves sumptuously, they
appeared, in a manner, to reproach the poor for their poverty. The
inequality he describes hyperbolically, when he says, that some are
*drunken* and others are *hungry*, for some had the means of stuffing
themselves well, while others had slender fare. Thus the poor were
exposed to the derision of the rich, or at least they were exposed to
shame. It was, therefore, an unseemly spectacle, and not in accordance
with the *Lord*’*s supper*

<span id="xviii.ii-p54"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p54.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p55"></span>**22.** *Have ye not houses*? From this
we see that the Apostle was utterly dissatisfied with this custom of
feasting, even though the abuse formerly mentioned had not existed. For,
though it seems allowable for the whole Church to partake at one common
table, yet this, on the other hand, is wrong — to convert a sacred
assembly to purposes foreign to its nature. We know for what exercises a
Church should assemble — to hear doctrine, to pour forth prayers, and
sing hymns to God, to observe the sacraments,  <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) to make confession of their faith, and
to engage in pious observances, and other exercises of piety. If
anything else is done there, it is out of place. Every one has his own
house appointed him for eating and drinking, and hence that is an
unseemly thing in a sacred assembly.

<span id="xviii.ii-p57"></span>*What shall I say to you?* Having fitly
stated the case, he now calls them to consider, whether they are *worthy
to be praised*, for they could not defend an abuse that was so manifest.
He presses them still further, by asking — “What else could I do? Will
you say that you are unjustly reproved?” Some manuscripts connect the
words *in* *this* with the verb that follows — in this way: *Shall I
praise you*? *In this I do not praise you*  <span
id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) The other reading, however, is the
more generally received among the Greeks, and it suits better.

<span id="xviii.iii-p2"></span>**23.** For I have received of the Lord
that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the *same*
night in which he was betrayed took bread:

<span id="xviii.iii-p3"></span>**23.** Ego enim accepi a Domino, quod
etiam tradidi vobis: quod Dominus Iesus nocte qua traditus est, accepit
panem:

<span id="xviii.iii-p4"></span>**24.** And when he had given thanks, he
brake *it*, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for
you: this do in remembrance of me.

<span id="xviii.iii-p5"></span>**24.** Et gratiis actis, fregit, et
dixit, Accipite, edite: hoc est corpus meum quod pro vobis frangitur:
hoc facite in mei memoriam.

<span id="xviii.iii-p6"></span>**25.** After the same manner also *he
took* the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament
in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink *it*, in remembrance of me.

<span id="xviii.iii-p7"></span>**25.** Similiter et calicem, postquam
vum testamentum est in sanguine meo: hoc facite, quotiescunque

<span id="xviii.iii-p8"></span>**26.** For as often as ye eat this
bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.

<span id="xviii.iii-p9"></span>**26.** Quotiescumque enim ederitis panem
hunc, et biberitis hunc calicem, mortem Domini annuntiabitis, donce

<span id="xviii.iii-p10"></span>**27.** Wherefore, whosoever shall eat
this bread, and drink *this* cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be
guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.

<span id="xviii.iii-p12"></span>**28.** But let a man examine himself,

<span id="xviii.iii-p13"></span>**28.** Probet autem homo se ipsum, et

<span id="xviii.iii-p14"></span>**29.** For he that eateth and drinketh

<span id="xviii.iii-p17"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p18"></span>Hitherto he has been exposing the abuse;
 <span id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md) now he proceeds to show what is
the proper method of rectifying it. For the institution of Christ is a
sure rule, so that if you turn aside from it but a very little, you are
out of the right course. Hence, as the Corinthians had deviated from
this rule, he calls them back to it. It is a passage that ought to be
carefully observed, as showing that there is no remedy for correcting
and purging out abuses, short of a return to God’s pure institution.
Thus the Lord himself — when he was discoursing respecting marriage,
(<span id="xviii.iii-p19.2"></span>[Mt
19:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#003.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p19.2"></span>,) and the Scribes brought forward custom,
and also the permission given by Moses — simply brings forward his
Father’s institution, as being an inviolable law. When we do this at the
present day, the Papists cry out, that we are leaving nothing untouched.
 <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) We openly demonstrate, that it
is not in one point merely that they have degenerated from our Lord’s
first institution, but that they have corrupted it in a thousand ways.
Nothing is more manifest than that their Mass is diametrically opposed
to the sacred Supper of our Lord. I go farther — we show in the plainest
manner, that it is full of wicked abominations: hence there is need of
reformation. We demand — what it appears Paul had recourse to — that our
Lord’s institution be the common rule, to which we agree on both sides
to make our appeal. This they oppose with all their might. Mark then the
nature of the controversy at this day in reference to the Lord’s Supper.

<span id="xviii.iii-p21"></span>**23** *I received from the Lord.* In
these words he intimates, that there is no authority that is of any
avail in the Church, but that of the Lord alone. “*I* have not delivered
to you an invention of my own: I had not, when I came to you, contrived
a new kind of *Supper*, according to my own humor, but have Christ as my
authority, *from whom I received what I have delivered unto you,* in the
way of handing it over.”  <span id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md)
Return, then, to the original source. Thus, bidding adieu to human laws,
the authority of Christ will be maintained in its stability.

<span id="xviii.iii-p23"></span>*That night in which he was betrayed.*
This circumstance as to time instructs us as to the design of the
sacrament — that the benefit of Christ’s death may be ratified in us.
For the Lord might have some time previously committed to the Apostles
this covenant-seal,  <span id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) but he
waited until the time of his oblation, that the Apostles might see soon
after accomplished in reality in his body, what he had represented to
them in the *bread* and the *wine* Should any one infer from this, that
the Supper ought, therefore, to be celebrated at night and after a
bodily repast, I answer, that, in what our Lord did, we must consider
what there is that he would have to be done by us. It is certain, that
he did not mean to institute a kind of nightly festival, like that in
honor of Ceres,  <span id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) and farther,
that it was not his design to invite his people to come to this
spiritual banquet with a well-filled stomach. Such actions of Christ as
are not intended for our imitation, should not be reckoned as belonging
to his institution.  <span id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md) In this
way, there is no difficulty in setting aside that subtilty of Papists,
by which they shift off  <span id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md) what I
have already stated as to the duty of maintaining and preserving
Christ’s institution in its simplicity. “We will, therefore,” say they,
“*not* receive the Lord’s Supper except at night, and we will therefore
take it — not when fasting, but after having dined.” All this, I say, is
mere trifling; for it is easy to distinguish what our Lord did, in order
that we might imitate it, or rather what he did with the view of
commanding us to do the like.

<span id="xviii.iii-p28"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p29"></span>**24.** *Having given thanks.* Paul
observes elsewhere, that every gift that we receive from the hand of God

<span id="xviii.iii-p30"></span>is sanctified to us by the word and
prayer. (<span id="xviii.iii-p30.1"></span>[1Ti
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#005.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p30.1"></span>.)

<span id="xviii.iii-p31"></span>Accordingly, we nowhere read that the
Lord tasted bread along with his disciples, but there is mention made of
his *giving thanks*, (<span id="xviii.iii-p31.1"></span>[Joh
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#023.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p31.1"></span>,) by which example he has assuredly
instructed us to do the like. This *giving of thanks*, however, has a
reference to something higher, for Christ *gives thanks* to the Father
for his mercy  <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) towards the human
race, and the inestimable benefit of redemption; and he invites us, by
his example, to raise up our minds as often as we approach the sacred
table, to an acknowledgment of the boundless love of God towards us, and
to have our minds kindled up to true gratitude.  <span
id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md)

<span id="xviii.iii-p34"></span>*Take, eat, this is my body* As Paul
designed here to instruct us in a few words as to the right use of the
sacrament, it is our duty to consider attentively  <span
id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md) what he sets before us, and allow
nothing to pass unobserved, inasmuch as he says nothing but what is
exceedingly necessary to be known, and worthy of the closest attention.
In the first place, we must take notice, that Christ here distributes
the bread among the Apostles, that all may partake of it in common, and
thus every one may *receive* his portion, that there may be an equal
participation among all. Accordingly, when there is not a table in
common prepared for all the pious — where they are not invited to the
*breaking of bread* in common, and where, in fine, believers do not
mutually participate, it is to no purpose that the name of the *Lord*’*s
Supper* is laid claim to.

<span id="xviii.iii-p36"></span>But for what purpose  <span
id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) are the people called to mass, unless
it be that they may *come* away empty from an unmeaning show?  <span
id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) It has, therefore, nothing in unison
with the supper. Hence, too, we infer that Christ’s promise is no more
applicable to the mass than to the feast of the Salii;  <span
id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) for when Christ promises that he will
give us *his body*, he at the same time commands us to *take and eat of
the bread* Hence, unless we obey this command, it is to no purpose that
we glory in his promise. To explain this more familiarly in other words
— the promise is annexed to the commandment in a conditional way, as it
were: hence it has its accomplishment only if the condition also is
accomplished. For example, it is written, *Call upon me*; *I will answer
thee* (<span id="xviii.iii-p39.3"></span>[Ps
91:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#015.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p39.3"></span>.) It is our part to obey the command of
God, that he may accomplish for us what he promises; otherwise we shut
ourselves out from the accomplishment of it.  <span
id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md)

<span id="xviii.iii-p41"></span>What do Papists do? They neglect
participation, and consecrate the bread for a totally different purpose,
and in the meantime they boast that they have the Lord’s body. While, by
a wicked divorce, they

<span id="xviii.iii-p42"></span>put asunder those things which Christ
has joined together,  
(<span id="xviii.iii-p42.2"></span>[Mt
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p42.2"></span>,)

<span id="xviii.iii-p43"></span>it is manifest that their boasting is
vain. Hence, whenever they bring forward the clause — *This is my body,*
we must retort upon them the one that immediately precedes it — *Take
and eat* For the meaning of the words is: “By participating in the
breaking of bread, according to the order and observance which I have
prescribed, you shall be participants also in my body.” Hence, when an
individual eats of it by himself, the promise in that case goes for
nothing. Besides, we are taught in these words what the Lord would have
us do. *Take*, says he. Hence those that offer a sacrifice to God have
some other than Christ as their authority, for we are not instructed in
these words to perform a sacrifice.

<span id="xviii.iii-p44"></span>But what do Papists say as to their
mass? At first they were so impudent as to maintain, that it was truly
and properly called a sacrifice. Now, however, they admit that it is
indeed a commemorative sacrifice, but in such a way, that the benefit of
redemption is, through means of their daily oblation,  <span
id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) applied to the living and the dead.
However that may *be*, they present the appearance of a sacrifice.
 <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) In the first place, there is
rashness in this, as being without any command from Christ; but there is
a still more serious error involved in it — that, while Christ appointed
the Supper for this purpose, that we might *take and eat*, they pervert
it to a totally different use.

<span id="xviii.iii-p47"></span>*This is my body* I shall not recount
the unhappy contests that have tried the Church in our times as to the
meaning of these words. Nay rather, would to God that we could bury the
remembrance of them in perpetual oblivion! I shall state, first of all,
*sincerely* and *without disguise*, and then farther, I shall state
*freely* (as I am wont to do) what my views are. Christ calls the bread
*his body*; for I set aside, without any disputation, that absurd
contrivance, that our Lord did not exhibit the bread to the Apostles,
but his body, which they beheld with their eyes, for it immediately
follows — *This cup is the New Testament in my blood* Let us regard it
then as beyond all controversy that Christ is here speaking of the
bread. Now the question *is* — “In what sense?” That we may elicit the
true meaning, we must hold that the expression is figurative; for,
assuredly, to deny this is exceedingly dishonest.  <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) Why then is the term *body* applied to
the bread? All, I think, will allow that it is for the same reason that
John calls the Holy Spirit a *dove* (<span
id="xviii.iii-p48.2"></span>[Joh
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p48.2"></span>.) Thus far we are agreed. Now the reason
why the Spirit was so called was this — that he had appeared in the form
of a dove. Hence the name of the Spirit is transferred to the visible
sign. Why should we not maintain that there is here a similar instance
of metonymy, and that the term *body* is applied to the bread, as being
the sign and symbol of it? If any are of a different opinion they will
forgive me; but it appears to me to be an evidence of a contentious
spirit, to dispute pertinaciously on this point. I lay it down, then, as
a settled point, that there is here a sacramental form of expression,
 <span id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) in which the Lord gives to the
sign the name of the thing signified.

<span id="xviii.iii-p50"></span>We must now proceed farther, and inquire
as to the reason of the metonymy. Here I reply, that the name of the
thing signified is not applied to the sign simply as being a
representation of it, but rather as being a symbol of it,  <span
id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) by which the reality is presented to
us. For I do not allow the force of those comparisons which some borrow
from profane or earthly things; for there is a material *difference*
between them and the sacraments of our Lord. The statue of Hercules is
called *Hercules*, but what have we there but a bare, empty
representation? On the other hand the Spirit is called a *dove*, as
being a sure pledge of the invisible presence of the Spirit. Hence the
*bread* is *Christ*’*s body*, because it assuredly testifies, that the
body which it represents is held forth to us, or because the Lord, by
holding out to us that symbol, gives us at the same time his own body;
for Christ is not a deceiver, to mock us with empty representations.
 <span id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md) Hence it is regarded by me as
beyond all controversy, that the reality is here conjoined with the
sign; or, in other words, that we do not less truly become participants
in Christ’s body in respect of spiritual efficacy, than we partake of
the bread.

<span id="xviii.iii-p53"></span>We must now discuss the manner. Papists
hold forth to us their system of transubstantiation: they allege that,
when the act of consecration has been gone through, the substance of the
bread no longer exists, and that nothing remains but the accidents.
 <span id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) To this contrivance we oppose —
not merely the plain words of Scripture, but the very nature of the
sacraments. For what is the meaning of the *supper*, if there is no
correspondence between the visible sign and the spiritual reality? They
would have the sign to be a false and delusive appearance of bread. What
then will the thing signified be, but a mere imagination? Hence, if
there must be a correspondence between the sign and its reality, it is
necessary that the bread be real — not imaginary — to represent Christ’s
real body. Besides, Christ’s body is here given us not simply, but *as
food*. Now it is not by any means the color of the bread that nourishes
us, but the substance. In fine, if we would have reality in the thing
itself, there must be no deception in the sign.

<span id="xviii.iii-p55"></span>Rejecting then the dream of Papists, let
us see in what manner Christ’s body is given to us. Some explain, that
it is given to us, when we are made partakers of all the blessings which
Christ has procured for us in his body — when, I say, we by faith
embrace Christ as crucified for us, and raised up from the dead, and in
this way are effectually made partakers of all his benefits. As for
those who are of this opinion, I have no objection to their holding such
a view. As for myself, I *acknowledge*, that it is only when we obtain
Christ himself, that we come to partake of Christ’s benefits. He is,
however, *obtained*, I affirm, not only when we believe that he was made
an offering for us, but when he dwells in us — when he is one with us —
when we are *members of his flesh*, (<span
id="xviii.iii-p55.1"></span>[Eph
5:30](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#030.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p55.1"></span>,) — when, in fine, we are incorporated with
him (so to speak) into one life and substance. Besides, I attend to the
import of the words, for Christ does not simply present to us the
benefit of his death and resurrection, but the very body in which he
suffered and rose again. I conclude, that Christ’s body is *really*, (as
the common expression is,) — that is, *truly* given to us in the Supper,
to be wholesome food for our souls. I use the common form of expression,
but my meaning is, that our souls are nourished by the substance of the
body, that we may truly be made one with him, or, what amounts to the
same thing, that a life-giving virtue from Christ’s flesh is poured into
us by the Spirit, though it is at a great distance from us, and is not
mixed with us.  <span id="fr_687"></span>[688](#fn_687.md)

<span id="xviii.iii-p57"></span>There now remains but one difficulty —
how is it possible that his body, which is in heaven, is given to us
here upon earth? Some imagine that Christ’s body is infinite, and is not
confined to any one space, but *fills heaven and earth*, (<span
id="xviii.iii-p57.1"></span>[Jer
23:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#024.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p57.1"></span>,) like his Divine essence. This fancy is
too absurd to require refutation. The Schoolmen dispute with more
refinement as to his glorious body. Their whole doctrine, however,
reduces itself to this — that Christ is to be sought after in the bread,
as if he were included in it. Hence it comes, that the minds of men
behold the bread with wonderment, and adore it in place of Christ.
Should any one ask them whether they adore the bread, or the appearance
of it, they will confidently agree that they do not, but, in the mean
time, when about to adore Christ, they turn to the bread. They turn, I
say, not merely with their eyes, and their whole body, but even with the
thoughts of the heart. Now what is this but unmixed idolatry? But that
participation in the body of Christ, which, I affirm, is presented to us
in the Supper, does not require a local presence, nor the descent of
Christ, nor infinite extension,  <span id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md)
nor anything of that nature, for the Supper being a heavenly action,
there is no absurdity in saying, that Christ, while remaining in heaven,
is received by us. For as to his communicating himself to us, *that* is
effected through the secret virtue of his Holy Spirit, which can not
merely bring together, but join in one, things that are separated by
distance of place, and far remote.

<span id="xviii.iii-p59"></span>But, in order that we may be capable of
this participation, we must rise heavenward. Here, therefore, faith must
be our resource, when all the bodily senses have failed. When I speak of
*faith*, I do not mean any sort of opinion, resting on human
contrivances, as many, boasting of faith on all occasions, run
grievously wild on this point. What then? You see bread — nothing more —
but you learn that it is a symbol  <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) of Christ’s body. Do not doubt that
the Lord accomplishes what his words intimate — that the body, which
thou dost not at all behold, is given to thee, as a spiritual repast. It
seems incredible, that we should be nourished by Christ’s flesh, which
is at so great a distance from us. Let us bear in mind, that it is a
secret and wonderful work of the Holy Spirit, which it were criminal to
measure by the standard of our understanding. “In the meantime, however,
drive away gross imaginations, which would keep thee from looking beyond
the bread. Leave to Christ the true nature of flesh, and do not, by a
mistaken apprehension, extend his body over heaven and earth: do not
divide him into different parts by thy fancies, and do not adore him in
this place and that, according to thy carnal apprehension. Allow him to
remain in his heavenly glory, and aspire thou thither,  <span
id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) that he may thence communicate himself
to thee.” These few things will satisfy those that are sound and modest.
As for the curious, I would have them look somewhere else for the means
of satisfying their appetite.

<span id="xviii.iii-p62"></span>*Which is broken for you* Some explain
this as referring to the distribution of the bread, because it was
necessary that Christ’s body should remain entire, as it had been
predicted, (<span id="xviii.iii-p62.1"></span>[Ex
12:46](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#046.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p62.1"></span>,) A *bone of him shall not be broken* As
for myself — while I acknowledge that Paul makes an allusion to the
breaking of bread, yet I understand the word *broken* as used here for
*sacrificed* — not, indeed, with strict propriety, but at the same time
without any absurdity. For although *no bone was broken*, yet the body
itself having been subjected, first of all, to so many tortures and
inflictions, and afterwards to the punishment of death in the most cruel
form, cannot be said to have been uninjured. This is what Paul means by
its being *broken* This, however, is the *second* clause of the promise,
which ought not to be passed over slightly. For the Lord does not
present his body to us simply, and without any additional consideration,
but as having been *sacrificed* for us. The *first* clause, then,
intimates, that the body is presented to us: this *second* clause
teaches us, what advantage we derive from it — that we are partakers of
redemption, and the benefit of his sacrifice is applied to us. Hence the
Supper is a mirror which represents to us Christ crucified, so that no
one can profitably and advantageously receive the supper, but the man
who *embraces* Christ crucified.

<span id="xviii.iii-p63"></span>*Do this in remembrance of me.* Hence
the Supper is a memorial, (<span id="xviii.iii-p63.1"></span>μνημόσυνον
 <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691) .md) appointed as a help to our
weakness; for if we were sufficiently mindful of the death of Christ,
this help would be unnecessary. This is common to all sacraments, for
they are helps to our weakness. What is the nature of that remembrance
which Christ would have us cherish with regard to him, we shall hear
presently. As to the inference, however, which some draw from this —
that Christ is not present in the Supper, because a *remembrance*
applies to something that is absent; the answer is easy — that Christ is
absent from it in the sense in which the Supper is a commemoration. For
Christ is not visibly present, and is not beheld with our eyes, as the
symbols are which excite our remembrance by representing him. In short,
in order that he may be present with us, he does not change his place,
but communicates to us from heaven the virtue of his flesh, as though it
were present.  <span id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md)

<span id="xviii.iii-p66"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p66.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p67"></span>**25.** *The cup, when he had supped*
The Apostle seems to intimate, that there was some interval of time
between the distribution of the *bread* and that of the *cup*, and it
does not quite appear from the Evangelists whether the whole of the
transaction was continuous.  <span id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md)
This, however, is of no great moment, for it may be that the Lord
delivered in the meantime some address, after distributing the bread,
and before giving the cup. As, however, he did or said nothing that was
not in harmony with the sacrament, we need not say that the
administration of it was disturbed or interrupted. I would not, however,
render it as Erasmus does — *supper*, *being ended*, for, in a matter of
so great importance, ambiguity ought to be avoided.

<span id="xviii.iii-p69"></span>*This cup is the New Testament* What is
affirmed as to the *cup*, is applicable also to the *bread*; and thus,
by this form of expression, he intimates what he had before stated more
briefly — that *the bread is the body.* For it is so to us, that it may
be a *testament in his body*, that is, a covenant, which has been once
confirmed by the offering up of his body, and is now confirmed by
eating, when believers feast upon that sacrifice. Accordingly, while
Paul and Luke use the *words* — *testament in the blood,* Matthew and
Mark employ the *expression* — *blood of the testament*, which amounts
to the same thing. For the blood was poured out to reconcile us to God,
and now we drink of it in a spiritual sense, that we may be partakers of
reconciliation. Hence, in the Supper, we have both a covenant, and a
confirmatory pledge of the covenant.

<span id="xviii.iii-p70"></span>I shall speak in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, if the Lord shall allow me opportunity, as to the word
*testament* It is well known, however, that sacraments receive that
name, from being *testimonies to* us of the divine will, to confirm
 <span id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) it in our minds. For as a
covenant is entered into among men with solemn rites, so it is in the
same manner that the Lord deals with us. Nor is it without strict
propriety that this term is employed; for in consequence of the
connection between the word and the sign, the covenant of the Lord is
really included in the sacraments, and the term *covenant* has a
reference or relation to us. This will be of no small importance for
understanding the nature of the sacraments; for if they are *covenants*,
then they contain promises, by which consciences may be roused up to an
assurance of salvation. Hence it follows, that they are not merely
outward signs of profession before men, but are inwardly, too, helps to
faith.

<span id="xviii.iii-p72"></span>*This do, as often as ye drink* Christ,
then, has appointed a two-fold sign in the Supper.

<span id="xviii.iii-p73"></span>What God hath joined together let not
man put asunder.  
(<span id="xviii.iii-p73.2"></span>[Mt
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#006.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p73.2"></span>.)

<span id="xviii.iii-p74"></span>To distribute, therefore, the *bread*
without the *cup*, is to man Christ’s institution.  <span
id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) For we hear Christ’s words. As he
commands us to eat of the *bread*, so he commands us to drink of the
*cup* To obey the one half of the command and neglect the other half —
what is this but to make sport of his commandment? And to keep back the
people from that *cup*, which Christ sets before all, after first
drinking of it, as is done under the tyranny of the Pope — who can deny
that this is diabolical presumption? As to the cavil that they bring
forward — that Christ spoke merely to the Apostles, and not to the
common people — it is exceedingly childish, and is easily refuted from
this passage — for Paul here addresses himself to men and women
indiscriminately, and to the whole body of the Church. He declares that
he

<span id="xviii.iii-p76"></span>had delivered this to them agreeably to
the commandment  
of the Lord. (<span id="xviii.iii-p76.2"></span>[1Co
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p76.2"></span>.)

<span id="xviii.iii-p77"></span>By what spirit will those pretend to be
actuated, who have dared to set aside this ordinance? Yet even at this
day this gross abuse is obstinately defended; and what occasion is there
for wonder, if they endeavor impudently to excuse, by words and
writings, what they so cruelly maintain by fire and sword?

<span id="xviii.iii-p78"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p78.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p79"></span>**26.** *For as often as ye shall eat.*
Paul now adds what kind of remembrance ought to be cherished — that is,
with thanksgiving; not that the remembrance consists wholly in
confession with the mouth; for the chief thing is, that the efficacy of
Christ’s death be sealed in our consciences; but this knowledge should
stir us up to a confession in respect of praise, so as to declare before
men what we feel inwardly before God. The Supper then is (so to speak) a
kind of memorial, which must always remain in the Church, until the last
coming of Christ; and it has been appointed for this purpose, that
Christ may put us in mind of the benefit of his death, and that we may
recognize it  <span id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) before men. Hence
it has the name of the Eucharist.  <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) If, therefore, you would celebrate the
Supper aright, you must bear in mind, that a profession of your faith is
required from you. Hence we see how shamelessly those mock God, who
boast that they have in the mass something of the nature of the Supper.
For what is the mass? They confess (for I am not speaking of Papists,
but of the pretended followers of Nicodemus) that it is full of
abominable superstitions. By outward gesture they give a pretended
approval of them. What kind of *showing forth of the death of Christ* is
this? Do they not rather renounce it?

<span id="xviii.iii-p82"></span>*Until he come* As we always need a help
of this kind, so long as we are in this world, Paul intimates that this
commemoration has been given us in charge, until Christ come to
judgment. For as he is not present with us in a visible form, it is
necessary for us to have some symbol of his presence, by which our minds
may exercise themselves.

<span id="xviii.iii-p83"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p83.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p84"></span>**27.** *Therefore he who shall eat this
bread unworthily.* If the Lord requires gratitude from us in the
receiving of this sacrament — if he would have us acknowledge his grace
with the heart, and publish it with the mouth — that man will not go
unpunished, who has put insult upon him rather than honor; for the Lord
will not allow his commandment to be despised. Now, if we would catch
the meaning of this declaration, we must know what it is to *eat
unworthily* Some restrict it to the Corinthians, and the abuse that had
crept in among them, but I am of opinion that Paul here, according to
his usual manner, passed on from the particular case to a general
statement, or from one instance to an entire class. There was one fault
that prevailed among the Corinthians. He takes occasion from this to
speak of every kind of faulty administration or reception of the Supper.
“*God*,” says he, “*will* not allow this sacrament to be profaned
without punishing it severely.”

<span id="xviii.iii-p85"></span>To *eat unworthily,* then, is to pervert
the pure and right *use* of it by our *abuse* of it. Hence there are
various degrees of this *unworthiness*, so to speak; and some offend
more grievously, others less so. *Some fornicator*, perhaps, or
*perjurer*, or *drunkard*, or *cheat*, (<span
id="xviii.iii-p85.1"></span>[1Co
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#011.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p85.1"></span>,) intrudes himself without repentance. As
such downright contempt is a token of wanton insult against Christ,
there can be no doubt that such a person, whoever he is, receives the
Supper to his own destruction. Another, perhaps, will come forward, who
is not addicted to any open or flagrant vice, but at the same time not
so prepared in heart as became him. As this carelessness or negligence
is a sign of irreverence, it is also deserving of punishment from God.
As, then, there are various degrees of *unworthy participation*, so the
Lord punishes some more slightly; on others he inflicts severer
punishment.

<span id="xviii.iii-p86"></span>Now this passage gave rise to a
question, which some afterwards agitated with too much keenness —
whether the *unworthy* really partake of the Lord’s body? For some were
led, by the heat of controversy, so far as to say, that it was received
indiscriminately by the good and the bad; and many at this day maintain
pertinaciously, and most clamorously, that in the first Supper Peter
received no more than Judas. It is, indeed, with reluctance, that I
dispute keenly with any one on this point, which is (in my opinion) not
an essential one; but as others allow themselves, without reason, to
pronounce, with a magisterial air, whatever may seem good to them, and
to launch out thunderbolts upon every one that mutters anything to the
contrary, we will be excused, if we calmly adduce reasons in support of
what we reckon to be true.

<span id="xviii.iii-p87"></span>I hold it, then, as a settled point, and
will not allow myself to be driven from it, that Christ cannot be
disjoined from his Spirit. Hence I maintain, that his body is not
received as dead, or even inactive, disjoined from the grace and power
of his Spirit. I shall not occupy much time in proving this statement.
Now in what way could the man who is altogether destitute of a living
faith and repentance, having nothing of the Spirit of Christ,  <span
id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) receive Christ himself? Nay more, as
he is entirely under the influence of Satan and sin, how will he be
capable of receiving Christ? While, therefore, I acknowledge that there
are some who receive Christ truly in the Supper, and yet at the same
time *unworthily*, as is the case with many weak persons, yet I do not
admit, that those who bring with them a mere historical faith,  <span
id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) without a lively feeling of repentance
and faith, receive anything but the sign. For I cannot endure to maim
Christ,  <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md) and I shudder at the
absurdity of affirming that he gives himself to be eaten by the wicked
in a lifeless state, as it were. Nor does Augustine mean anything else
when he says, that the wicked receive Christ merely in the sacrament,
which he expresses more clearly elsewhere, when he says that the other
Apostles ate *the bread* — *the Lord*; but Judas only the *bread of the
Lord*  <span id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md)

<span id="xviii.iii-p92"></span>But here it is objected, that the
efficacy of the sacraments does not depend upon the worthiness of men,
and that nothing is taken away from the promises of God, or falls to the
ground, through the wickedness of men. This I acknowledge, and
accordingly I add in express terms, that Christ’s body is presented to
the wicked no less than to the good, and this is enough so far as
concerns the efficacy of the sacrament and the faithfulness of God. For
God does not there represent in a delusive manner, to the wicked, the
body of his Son, but presents it in reality; nor is the bread a bare
sign to them, but a faithful pledge. As to their rejection of it, that
does not impair or alter anything as to the nature of the sacrament.

<span id="xviii.iii-p93"></span>It remains, that we give a reply to the
statement of Paul in this passage. “Paul represents the unworthy as
guilty, inasmuch as *they do not discern the Lord’s body*: it follows,
that they receive his body.” I deny the inference; for though they
reject it, yet as they profane it and treat it with dishonor when it is
presented to them, they are deservedly held guilty; for they do, as it
were, cast it upon the ground, and trample it under their feet. Is such
sacrilege trivial? Thus I see no difficulty in Paul’s words, provided
you keep in view what God presents and holds out to the wicked — not
what they receive.

<span id="xviii.iii-p94"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p94.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p95"></span>**28.** *But let a man examine himself*
An exhortation drawn from the foregoing threatening. “*If* those that
*eat unworthily* are *guilty of the body and blood of the Lord*, then
let no man approach who is not properly and duly prepared. Let every
one, therefore, take heed to himself, that he may not fall into this
sacrilege through idleness or carelessness.” But now it is asked, what
sort of *examination*, that ought to be to which Paul exhorts us.
Papists make it consist in auricular confession. They order all that are
to receive the Supper, to examine their life carefully and anxiously,
that they may unburden all their sins in the ear of the priest. Such is
*their* preparation!  <span id="fr_702"></span>[703](#fn_702.md) I
maintain, however, that this holy *examination* of which Paul speaks, is
widely different from torture. Those persons,  <span
id="fr_703"></span>[704](#fn_703.md) after having *tortured* themselves
with reflection for a few hours, and making the priest — such as he is —
privy to their vileness,  <span id="fr_704"></span>[705](#fn_704.md)
imagine that they have done their duty. It is an *examination* of
another sort that Paul here requires — one of such a kind as may accord
with the legitimate use of the sacred Supper.

<span id="xviii.iii-p99"></span>You see here a method that is most
easily apprehended. If you would wish to use aright the benefit afforded
by Christ, bring faith and repentance. As to these two things,
therefore, the trial must be made, if you would come duly prepared.
Under repentance I include love; for the man who has learned to renounce
himself, that he may give himself up wholly to Christ and his service,
will also, without doubt, carefully maintain that unity which Christ has
enjoined. At the same time, it is not a perfect faith or repentance that
is required, as some, by urging beyond due bounds, a perfection that can
nowhere be found, would shut out for ever from the Supper every
individual of mankind. If, however, thou aspirest after the
righteousness of God with the earnest desire of thy mind, and, trembled
under a view of thy misery, dost wholly lean upon Christ’s grace, and
rest upon it, know that thou art a worthy guest to approach the table —
*worthy* I mean in this respect, that the Lord does not exclude thee,
though in another point of view there is something in thee that is not
as it ought to be. For faith, when it is but begun, makes those *worthy*
who were *unworthy*.

<span id="xviii.iii-p100"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p100.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p101"></span>**29.** *He who shall eat unworthily,
eateth judgment to himself.* He had previously pointed out in express
terms the heinousness of the crime, when he said that those who should
*eat unworthily* would be *guilty of the body and blood of the Lord* Now
he alarms them, by denouncing punishment;  <span
id="fr_705"></span>[706](#fn_705.md) for there are many that are not
affected with the sin itself; unless they are struck down by the
judgment of God. This, then, he does, when he declares that this food,
otherwise health-giving, will turn out to their destruction, and will be
converted into poison to those that *eat unworthily*

<span id="xviii.iii-p103"></span>He adds the reasons because they
distinguish not the Lord’s body, that is, as a sacred thing from a
profane. “They handle the sacred body of Christ with unwashed hands,
(<span id="xviii.iii-p103.1"></span>[Mr
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#002.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p103.1"></span>,)  <span id="fr_706"></span>[707](#fn_706.md)
nay more, as if it were a thing of nought, they consider not how great
is the value of it.  <span id="fr_707"></span>[708](#fn_707.md) They will
therefore pay the penalty of so dreadful a profanation.” Let my readers
keep in mind what I stated a little ago, that the body  <span
id="fr_708"></span>[709](#fn_708.md) is presented to them, though their
unworthiness deprives them of a participation in it.

<span id="xviii.iv"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p1"></span><span id="xviii.iv-p1.1"></span>[1
Corinthians 11:30-34](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030.md)<span

<span id="xviii.iv-p2"></span>**30.** For this cause many *are* weak and

<span id="xviii.iv-p13"></span><span id="xviii.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p14"></span>**30.** *For this cause*, etc. After
having treated in a general way of *unworthy eating*, and of the kind of
punishment that awaits those who pollute this sacrament, he now
instructs the Corinthians as to the chastisement which they were at that
time enduring. It is not known whether a pestilence was raging there at
that time, or whether they were laboring under other kinds of disease.
However it may have been as to this, we infer from Paul’s words, that
the Lord had sent some scourge upon them for their correction. Nor does
Paul merely conjecture, that it is on that account that they are
punished, but he affirms it as a thing that was perfectly well known by
him. He says, then, that *many lay sick* — that many were kept long in a
languishing condition, and that many had died, in consequence of that
abuse of the Supper, because they had offended God. By this he
intimates, that by diseases and other chastisements from God, we are
admonished to think of our sins; for God does not afflict us without
good reason, for he takes no pleasure in our afflictions.

<span id="xviii.iv-p15"></span>The subject is a copious and ample one;
but let it suffice to advert to it here in a single word. If in Paul’s
times an ordinary abuse of the Supper  <span
id="fr_709"></span>[710](#fn_709.md) could kindle the wrath of God against
the Corinthians, so that he punished them thus severely, what ought we
to think as to the state of matters at the present day? We see,
throughout the whole extent of Popery, not merely horrid profanations of
the Supper, but even a sacrilegious abomination set up in its room. In
the *first* place, it is prostituted to *filthy lucre* (<span
id="xviii.iv-p16.2"></span>[1Ti
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#008)<span id="xviii.iv-p16.2"></span>.md)
and merchandise. *Secondly*, it is maimed, by taking away the use of the
cup. *Thirdly*, it is changed into another aspect,  <span
id="fr_710"></span>[711](#fn_710.md) by its having become customary for one
to partake of his own feast separately, participation being done away.
 <span id="fr_711"></span>[712](#fn_711.md) *Fourthly*, there is *there* no
explanation of the meaning of the sacrament, but a mumbling that would
accord better with a magical incantation, or the detestable *sacrifices*
of the Gentiles, than with our Lord’s institution. *Fifthly*, there is
an endless number of ceremonies, abounding partly with trifles, partly
with superstition, and consequently manifest pollutions. *Sixthly*,
there is the diabolical invention of sacrifice, which contains an
impious blasphemy against the death of Christ. *Seventhly*, it is fitted
to intoxicate miserable men with carnal *confidence*, while they present
it to God as if it were an expiation, and think that by this charm they
drive off everything hurtful, and that without faith and repentance. Nay
more, while they trust that they are armed against the devil and death,
and are fortified against God by a sure defense, they venture to sin
with much more freedom,  <span id="fr_712"></span>[713](#fn_712.md) and
become more obstinate. *Eighthly*, an idol is *there* adored in the room
of Christ. In short, it is filled with all kinds of abomination.  <span
id="fr_713"></span>[714](#fn_713.md)

<span id="xviii.iv-p21"></span>Nay even among ourselves, who have the
pure administration of the Supper restored to us,  <span
id="fr_714"></span>[715](#fn_714.md) in virtue of a return, as it were,
from captivity,  <span id="fr_715"></span>[716](#fn_715.md) how much
irreverence! How much hypocrisy on the part of many! What a disgraceful
mixture, while, without any discrimination, wicked and openly abandoned
persons intrude themselves, such as no man of character and decency
would admit to common intercourse!  <span
id="fr_716"></span>[717](#fn_716.md) And yet after all, we wonder how it
comes that there are so many wars, so many pestilences, so many failures
of the crop, so many disasters and calamities — as if the cause were not
manifest! And assuredly, we must not expect a termination to our
calamities, until we have removed the occasion of them, by correcting
our faults.

<span id="xviii.iv-p25"></span><span id="xviii.iv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p26"></span>**31.** *For if we would judge ourselves*
Here we have another remarkable statement — that God does not all of a
sudden become enraged against us, so as to inflict punishment
immediately upon our sinning, but that, for the most part, it is owing
to our carelessness, that he is in a manner constrained to punish us,
when he sees that we are in a careless and drowsy state, and are
flattering ourselves in our sins.  <span
id="fr_717"></span>[718](#fn_717.md) Hence we either avert, or mitigate
impending punishment, if we first call ourselves to account, and,
actuated by a spirit of repentance, deprecate the anger of God by
inflicting punishment voluntarily upon ourselves.  <span
id="fr_718"></span>[719](#fn_718.md) In short, believers anticipate, by
repentance, the judgment of God, and there is no other remedy, by which
they may obtain absolution in the sight of God, but by voluntarily
*condemning themselves*

<span id="xviii.iv-p29"></span>You must not, however, apprehend, as
Papists are accustomed to do, that there is here a kind of transaction
between us and God, as if, by inflicting punishment upon ourselves of
our own accord, we rendered satisfaction to him, and did, in a manner,
redeem ourselves from his hand. We do not, therefore, anticipate the
judgment of God, on the ground of our bringing any compensation to
appease him. The reason is this — because God, when he chastises us, has
it in view to shake us out of our drowsiness, and arouse us to
repentance. If we do this of our own accord, there is no longer any
reason, why he should proceed to inflict his judgment upon us. If,
however, any one, after having begun to feel displeased with himself,
and meditate repentance, is, nevertheless, still visited with God’s
chastisements, let us know that his repentance is not so valid or sure,
as not to require some chastisement to be sent upon him, by which it may
be helped forward to a fuller development. Mark how repentance wards off
the judgment of God by a suitable remedy — not, however, by way of
compensation.

<span id="xviii.iv-p30"></span><span id="xviii.iv-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p31"></span>**32.** *But when we are judged* Here we
have a consolation that is exceedingly necessary; for if any one in
affliction thinks that God is angry with him, he will rather be
discouraged than excited to repentance. Paul, accordingly, says, that
God is angry with believers in such a way as not in the meantime to be
forgetful of his mercy: nay more, that it is on this account
particularly that he punishes them — that he may consult their welfare.
It is an inestimable consolation  <span
id="fr_719"></span>[720](#fn_719.md) — that the punishments by which our
sins are chastened are evidences, not of God’s anger for our
destruction, but rather of his paternal love, and are at the same time
of assistance towards our salvation, for God is angry with us as his
sons, whom he will not leave to perish.

<span id="xviii.iv-p33"></span>When he *says* — *that we may not be
condemned with the world*, he intimates two things. The *first* is, that
the children of this world, while they sleep on quietly and securely in
their delights,  <span id="fr_720"></span>[721](#fn_720.md) are fattened
up, like hogs, for *the day of slaughter* (<span
id="xviii.iv-p34.2"></span>[Jer
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#003.md)<span
id="xviii.iv-p34.2"></span>.) For though the Lord sometimes invites the
wicked, also, to repentance by his chastisements, yet he often passes
them over as strangers,  <span id="fr_721"></span>[722](#fn_721.md) and
allows them to rush on with impunity, until they *have filled up the
measure* of their final condemnation. (<span
id="xviii.iv-p35.2"></span>[Ge
15:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#016.md)<span
id="xviii.iv-p35.2"></span>.) This privilege, therefore, belongs to
believers exclusively — that by punishments they are called back from
destruction. The *second* thing is this — that chastisements are
necessary remedies for believers, for otherwise they, too, would rush on
to everlasting destruction,  <span id="fr_722"></span>[723](#fn_722.md)
were they not restrained by temporal punishment.

<span id="xviii.iv-p37"></span>These considerations should lead us not
merely to patience, so as to endure with equanimity the troubles that
are assigned to us by God, but also to gratitude, that, giving thanks to
God our Father, we may resign ourselves  <span
id="fr_723"></span>[724](#fn_723.md) to his discipline by a willing
subjection. They are also useful to us in various ways; for they cause
our afflictions to be salutary to us, while they train us up for
mortification of the flesh, and a pious abasement — they accustom us to
obedience to God — they convince us of our own weakness, they kindle up
in our minds fervency in prayer — they exercise hope, so that at length
whatever there is of bitterness in them is all swallowed up in spiritual
joy.

<span id="xviii.iv-p39"></span><span id="xviii.iv-p39.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p40"></span>**33.** *Wherefore, my brethren* From the
discussion of a general doctrine, he returns to the particular subject
with which he had set out, and comes to this conclusion, that equality
must be observed in the Lord’s Supper, that there may be a real
participation, as there ought to be, and that they may not celebrate
every one his own supper; and farther, that this sacrament ought not to
be mixed up with common feasts.

<span id="xviii.iv-p41"></span><span id="xviii.iv-p41.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p42"></span>**34.** *The rest I will set in order
when I come* It is probable, that there were some things in addition,
which it would be of advantage to put into better order, but as they
were of less importance, the Apostle delays the correction of them until
his coming among them. It may be, at the same time, that there was
nothing of this nature; but as one knows better what is necessary when
he is present to see, Paul reserves to himself the liberty of arranging
matters when present, according as occasion may require. Papists arm
themselves against us with this buckler, too, for defending their *mass*
For they interpret *this* to be the *setting in order* which Paul here
promises — as if he would have taken the liberty  <span
id="fr_724"></span>[725](#fn_724.md) of overturning that eternal
appointment of Christ, which he here so distinctly approves of! For what
resemblance does the mass bear to Christ’s institution? But away with
such trifles, as it is certain that Paul speaks only of outward decorum.
As this is put in the power of the Church, so it ought to be arranged
according to the condition of times, places, and persons.

<span id="xviii.i-p103"></span> It is remarked by President Edwards,
that “the emphasis used, <span id="xviii.i-p103.1"></span>αὐτὴ ἡ φύσις,
*nature itself*, shows that the Apostle does not mean custom, but nature
in the proper sense. It is true it was long custom that made having the
head covered a token of subjection, and a feminine habit or appearance,
as it is custom that makes any outward action or word a sign or
signification of anything; but nature itself, nature in its proper
sense, teaches that it is a shame for a man to appear with the
established signs of the female sex. Nature itself shows it to be a
shame for a father to bow down or kneel to his own child or servant,
because bowing down is, by custom, an established token of subjection
and submission.” Edwards on Original Sin, part 2, chapter 3, section 3.

<span id="xviii.iii-p56"></span> In this passage, as, also, in some

Christ in the Lord’s Supper, in some mysterious manner, while he was, as
is well known, opposed to *consubstantiation*, as well as to
*transubstantiation*. The late venerable Dr. Dick of Glasgow, while
treating of the Lord’s Supper — while he makes mention of Calvin in
terms of the highest respect, as “one of the brightest ornaments of the
Reformation,” who, “in learning, genius, and zeal, had few equals, and
no superior,” — animadverts on some expressions made use of in the
*Institutes*, which seem not altogether in harmony with his general
