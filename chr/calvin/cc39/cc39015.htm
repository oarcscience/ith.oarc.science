<p><a name="xvi.i-p30"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Am I not free?</i> He confirms by facts what he had stated immediately before, &#8212; that he would rather never taste of flesh during his whole life, than give occasion of stumbling to a brother, and, at the same time, he shows that he requires nothing more from them than what he had himself 			 practiced. And, assuredly, natural equity requires that whatever law is imposed by any one upon others, should be submitted to by himself. More especially a Christian teacher should impose upon himself this necessity, that he may have it always in his power to confirm his doctrine by an exemplary life. We know by experience, that it is a very unpleasant thing that Paul required from the Corinthians &#8212; to refrain, for the sake of their brethren, from making use of the liberty that was allowed 			 them. He could scarcely have demanded this, if he had not taken the lead and shown them the way. And he had, it is true, promised that he would do this, but, as he might not be believed by all on his simply promising for the future, he makes mention of what he had already done. He brings forward a remarkable instance, in respect of his having denied himself the liberty which he might otherwise have used, purely in order that he might give the 			 false Apostles no occasion for calumniating. He had preferred to earn his food with his own hands, rather than be supported at the expense of the Corinthians, to whom he administered the Gospel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p31"></A>He treats, however, at great length of the right of the Apostles to receive food and clothing. This he does, partly for the purpose of stirring them up the more to forego many things for the sake of their brethren after his example, because they were unduly tenacious in the retaining of their own rights, and partly for the purpose of exposing more fully in view the unreasonableness of calumniators, who took occasion for 			 reviling from what was anything but blameworthy. He speaks, also, interrogatively, in order to press the matter home more closely. The question &#8212; <i>Am</i> <i>I not free?</i> is of a general nature. When he adds &#8212; <i>Am</i> 			 <i>I not an Apostle</i>? he specifies a particular kind of liberty. &#8220;If I am an Apostle of Christ, why should my condition be worse than that of others?&#8221; Hence he proves his liberty on the ground of his being an Apostle.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p32"></A><i>Have I not seen Jesus Christ</i>? He expressly adds this, in order that he may not be reckoned inferior in any respect, to the other Apostles, for this one thing the malevolent and envious bawled out on all occasions &#8212; that he had received from the hands of men whatever he had of the gospel, inasmuch as he had never 			 seen Christ. And, certainly, he had not had converse with Christ while he was in the world, but Christ had appeared to him after his resurrection. It was not a smaller privilege, however, to have seen Christ in his immortal glory, than to have seen him in the abasement of mortal flesh. He makes mention, also, afterwards of this vision, (<a name="xvi.i-p32.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008">1Co 15:8</a><a name="xvi.i-p32.1"></A>,) and mention is made of 			 it twice in the Acts, (<a name="xvi.i-p32.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#003">Ac 9:3</a><a name="xvi.i-p32.2"></A>, and <a name="xvi.i-p32.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#006">Ac 22:6</a><a name="xvi.i-p32.3"></A>.) Hence this passage tends to establish his call, because, although he had not been set apart as one of the twelve, there was no less authority in the appointment which Christ published from heaven.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p33"></A><i>Are not ye my work</i>? He now, in the <i>second </i>place, establishes his Apostleship from the effect of it, because he had gained over the Corinthians to the Lord by the gospel. Now this is a great thing that Paul claims for himself, when he calls their conversion 			 <i>his work</i>, for it is in a manner a new creation of the soul. But how will this correspond with what we had above &#8212; that</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xvi.i-p34"></A>he that planteth is nothing, and he that watereth is nothing? <br> 			 (<a name="xvi.i-p34.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007">1Co 3:7</a><a name="xvi.i-p34.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p35"></A>I answer, that as God is the efficient cause, while man, with his preaching, is an instrument that can do nothing of itself, we must always speak of the efficacy of the ministry in such a manner that the entire praise of the work may be reserved for God alone. But in some cases, when the ministry is spoken of, man is compared with God, and then that statement holds good &#8212; <i>He that planteth is nothing, and he that watereth is nothing</i>; for what can be left to a man if he is brought into competition with God? Hence Scripture represents ministers as nothing in comparison with God; but when the ministry is simply treated of without any comparison with God, then, as in this passage, its efficacy is honorably made mention of, with signal encomiums. 			 For, in that case, the question is not, what man can do of himself without God, but, on the contrary, God himself, who is the author, is conjoined with the instrument, and the Spirit&#8217;s influence with man&#8217;s labor. In other words, the question is not, what man himself accomplishes by his own power, but what God effects through his hands.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p36"></A><a name="xvi.i-p36.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p37"></A><b>2.</b> <i>If I am not an Apostle to others</i>  The sum of this tends to the establishing of his authority among the Corinthians, so as to place it beyond all dispute. &#8220;If there are those,&#8221; says he, &#8220;who have doubts as to my 			 Apostleship, to you, at least, it ought to be beyond all doubt, for, as I planted your Church by my ministry, you are either not believers, or you must necessarily recognize me as an Apostle. And that he may not seem to rest in mere words, he states that the reality itself was to be seen,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">479</FONT></A>
 			  because God had sealed his Apostleship by the faith of the Corinthians. Should any one, however, object, that this suits the false Apostles too, who gather disciples to themselves, I answer, that pure doctrine is above all things required, in order that any one may have a confirmation of his ministry in the sight of God from its effect. There is nothing, therefore, here to furnish impostors with matter of congratulation, if they have 			 deceived any of the populace, nay, even nations and kingdoms, by their falsehoods. Although in some cases persons are the occasion of spreading the kingdom of Christ, who, nevertheless, <i>do not preach the gospel sincerely</i>, as is said in <a name="xvi.i-p38.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#016">Php 1:16</a><a name="xvi.i-p38.2"></A>, it is not without good reason 			 that Paul infers from the fruit of his labor, that he is divinely commissioned: for the structure of the Corinthian Church was such, that the blessing of God could easily be seen shining forth in it, which ought to have served as a confirmation of Paul&#8217;s office.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p39"></A><a name="xvi.i-p39.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p40"></A><b>3.</b> <i>My defense. </i>Apart from the principal matter that he has at present in hand, it appears also to have been his intention to beat down, in passing, the calumnies of those who clamored against his call, as if he had been one of the ordinary class of ministers. &#8220;I am accustomed,&#8221; says he, &#8220;to put you forward as my shield, in the event of any one detracting from the honor of my Apostleship.&#8221; Hence it follows, that the Corinthians are injurious and inimical to themselves, if they do not acknowledge him as such, for if their faith was a solemn attestation of Paul&#8217;s Apostleship, and his <i>defense</i>, against slanderers, the one could not be invalidated without the other falling along with it.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p41"></A>Where others read &#8212; <i>those who interrogate me</i>, I have rendered it &#8212; <i>those that examine me</i> &#8212; for he refers to those who raised a dispute as to his Apostleship.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_479"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">480</FONT></A>
 			  Latin writers, I confess, speak of a criminal being <i>interrogated</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">481</FONT></A>
 			  according to the laws, but the meaning of the word <a name="xvi.i-p43.2"></A>&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#8055;&#957;&#949;&#953;&#957; which Paul makes use of, seemed to me to be brought out better in this way.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p44"></A><a name="xvi.i-p44.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p45"></A><b>4.</b> <i>Have we not power</i>? He concludes from what has been already said, that he had a right to receive food and clothing from them,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">482</FONT></A>
 			  for Paul ate and drank, but not at the expense of the Church. This, then, was one liberty that he dispensed with. The other was, that he had not a wife &#8212; to be maintained, also, at the public expense. Eusebius infers from these words that Paul was married, but had left his wife somewhere, that she might not be a burden to the Churches, but there is no foundation for this, for he might bring forward this, even though unmarried. In honoring a 			 Christian wife with the name of <i>sister</i>, he intimates, first of all, by this, how firm and lovely ought to be the connection between a pious pair, being held by a double tie. Farther he hints at the same time what modesty and honorable conduct ought to subsist between them. Hence, too, we may infer, how very far marriage is from being unsuitable to the ministers of the Church. I pass over the 			 fact, that the Apostles made use of it, as to whose example we shall have occasion to speak ere long, but Paul here teaches, in general terms, what is allowable for all.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p47"></A><a name="xvi.i-p47.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p48"></A><b>5.</b> <i>Even as the other Apostles.</i> In addition to the Lord&#8217;s permission, he mentions the common practice of others. And with the view of bringing out more fully the waiving of his right, he proceeds step by step. In the first place, he brings forward the <i>Apostles</i>  He then adds, &#8220;Nay, even <i>the brethren of the Lord</i> themselves also make use of it without hesitation &#8212; nay more, Peter himself, to whom the first place is assigned by consent of all, allows himself the 			 same liberty.&#8221; By <i>the brethren of the Lord</i>, he means John and James, who <i>were accounted pillars</i>, as he states elsewhere. (<a name="xvi.i-p48.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009">Ga 2:9</a><a name="xvi.i-p48.1"></A>.) And, 			 agreeably to what is customary in Scripture, he gives the name of <i>brethren</i> to those who were connected with Him by relationship.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p49"></A>Now, if any one should think to establish Popery from this, he would act a ridiculous part. We confess that Peter was acknowledged as first among the Apostles, as it is necessary that in every society there should always be some one to preside over the others, and they were of their own accord prepared to respect Peter for the eminent endowments by which he was distinguished, as it is proper to esteem and honor all that excel in 			 the gifts of God&#8217;s grace. That preeminence, however, was not lordship &#8212; nay more, it had nothing resembling lordship. For while he was eminent among the others, still he was subject to them as his colleagues. Farther, it is one thing to have pre-eminence in one Church, and quite another, to claim for one&#8217;s self a kingdom or dominion over the whole world. But indeed, even though we should concede everything as to Peter, what has this to do with the Pope? For as Matthias succeeded Judas, 			 (<a name="xvi.i-p49.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#026">Ac 1:26</a><a name="xvi.i-p49.1"></A>,) so some Judas might succeed Peter. Nay more, we see that during a period of more than nine hundred years among his successors, or at least among those who boast that they are his successors, there has not been one who was one whit better than Judas. This, however, is not the <i>place </i>to treat of these points. Consult my Institutes. (Volume 3.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p50"></A>One thing farther must here be noticed, that the Apostles had no horror of marriage, which the Papal clergy so much abominate, as unbecoming the sanctity of their order. But it was after their time that that admirable discovery was made, that the priests of the Lord are polluted if they have intercourse with their lawful wives; and, at length matters came to such a pitch, that Pope Syricius did not hesitate to call 			 marriage &#8220;<i>a pollution of the flesh</i>, in which no one can please God.&#8221; What then must become of the poor Apostles, who continued in that pollution until death? Here, however, they have contrived a refined subtilty to effect their escape; for they say that the Apostles gave up the use of the marriage bed, but <i>led about </i>their wives with them, that they might receive the fruits of the gospel, or, in other words, support at the public expense. As if they could not have been 			 maintained by the Churches, unless they wandered about from place to place; and farther, as if it were a likely thing that they would run hither and thither of their own accord, and without any necessity, in order that they might live in idleness at the public expense! For as to the explanation given by Ambrose, as referring to other persons&#8217; wives, who followed the Apostles for the purpose of hearing their doctrine, it is exceedingly forced.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p51"></A><a name="xvi.i-p51.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p52"></A><b>7.</b> <i>Who hath gone a warfare at his own charges?</i> It is the present tense that is used   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">483</FONT></A>
 			  as meaning &#8212; is <i>accustomed to go </i>a warfare. I have, however, with the view of taking off somewhat of the harshness, rendered it in the preterite. Now, by <i>three </i>comparisons, and these, too, taken from common life, he makes it out that it was allowable for him to live, if he chose, at the public expense of the Church, to show that he assumes 			 nothing to himself but what human nature itself teaches us is reasonable. The <i>first </i>is taken from military law, for soldiers are wont to have their provisions furnished to them at the public expense. The <i>second </i>is taken from vine-dressers, for the husbandman plants a vine &#8212; not to throw away his pains, but to gather the fruit. The <i>third </i>is taken 			 from keepers of cattle, for the shepherd does not lay out his labor for nothing, but <i>eats of the milk of the flock</i> &#8212; that is, he is supported from the produce. As natural equity points out this as reasonable, who will be so unjust as to refuse sustenance to the pastors of the Church? While it may happen, that some serve as soldiers at their own expense, as, 			 for example, the Romans in ancient times, when no tribute was as yet paid, and there were no taxes,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_483"><FONT SIZE="1">484</FONT></A>
 			  this does not militate against Paul&#8217;s statement, for he simply takes his argument from common and everywhere received practice.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p55"></A><a name="xvi.i-p55.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p56"></A><b>8.</b> <i>Say I these things as a man</i>? Lest any one should cavil, and say that in the things of the Lord the case is different, and therefore that he had to no purpose brought forward so many comparisons, he now adds, that the very same thing is commanded by the Lord. To 			 speak <i>as a man</i> sometimes means &#8212; speaking according to the perverse judgment of the flesh, (as in <a name="xvi.i-p56.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005">Ro 3:5</a><a name="xvi.i-p56.1"></A>.) Here, however, it means &#8212; bringing forward only those things that are in common use among men, and are merely current (as they speak) in a human court. Now, that God 			 himself designed that the labors of men should be remunerated by wages, he proves from this, that he prohibits the <i>muzzling of the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn;</i> and with the view of applying it to the subject in hand, he says, that God was not <i>concerned</i> as to oxen, but rather had regard to men.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p57"></A>In the first place, it may be asked, Why has he more particularly selected this proof, while he had in the law passages that were much clearer? as for example, <a name="xvi.i-p57.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#015">De 24:15</a><a name="xvi.i-p57.2"></A>,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xvi.i-p58"></A>The wages of the hireling shall not remain with thee over night.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p59"></A>If any one, however, will take a nearer view, he will acknowledge that there is more force in this quotation, in which the Lord requires cattle to be taken care of, for from this it is inferred, from the less to the greater, how much equity he requires among men, when he wishes that it should be shown to brute animals. When he says, that <i>God does not take care for 			 oxen</i>, you are not to understand him as meaning to exclude oxen from the care of God&#8217;s Providence, inasmuch as he does not overlook even the least sparrow. (<a name="xvi.i-p59.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#026">Mt 6:26</a><a name="xvi.i-p59.1"></A>, and <a name="xvi.i-p59.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029">Mt 10:29</a><a name="xvi.i-p59.2"></A>.) Nor 			 is it as if he meant to expound that precept allegorically, as some hair-brained spirits take occasion from this to turn everything into allegories. Thus they turn dogs into men, trees into angels, and turn all scripture into a laughing-stock.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p60"></A>Paul&#8217;s meaning is simple &#8212; that, when the Lord enjoins humanity to oxen, he does not do it for the sake of oxen, but rather from a regard to men, on whose account, too, the very oxen were created. That compassion, therefore, towards oxen should be a stimulus to us to stir up to the exercise of humanity among us, as Solomon says, (<a name="xvi.i-p60.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro012.htm#010">Pr 12:10</a><a name="xvi.i-p60.1"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xvi.i-p61"></A>The righteous man hath a care over his beast, <br> 			 but the bowels of the wicked are cruel.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p62"></A>Let it then be understood by you, that God is not <i>so </i>concerned for oxen, as to have had merely a regard to oxen in making that law, for he had mankind in view, and wished to accustom them to equity, that they might not defraud the workman of his hire. For it is not the ox that has the principal part in plowing or treading out the corn, but man, by whose industry the ox himself 			 is set to work. Hence, what he immediately adds &#8212; He <i>that ploweth, should plow in hope</i>, etc. is an exposition of the precept, as if he had said, that it extends generally to any kind of recompense for labor.</p>

<p><a name="xvi.i-p64"></A><b>10.</b> <i>Because he that ploweth ought to plow in hope.</i> There is a twofold reading in this passage, even in the Greek manuscripts, but the one that is more generally received is &#8212; <i>He that thrasheth</i>,<i> in hope of partaking 			 of his hope</i>  At the same time, the one that does not repeat the term <i>hope </i>twice in the second clause appears simpler, and more natural.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_484"></A><A HREF="#fn_484"><FONT SIZE="1">485</FONT></A>
 			  Hence, if I were at liberty to choose, I would prefer to read it thus: <i>He that ploweth should plow in hope</i>,<i> and he that thrasheth in hope of participating</i>  As, however, the most of the Greek manuscripts agree in the former reading, and as the meaning remains the same, I have not ventured to 			 make change upon it. Now he expounds the preceding injunction, and hence he says, that it is an unjust thing that the husbandman should lay out his pains to no purpose in plowing and thrashing, but that the end of his labor is the hope of receiving the fruits. As it is so, we may infer, that this belongs to oxen also, but Paul&#8217;s intention was to extend it farther, and apply it principally to men. Now, the husbandman is said to be <i>a partaker of his hope</i>, when he enjoys the produce which he has obtained when reaping, but hoped for when plowing.</p>

<p><a name="xvi.i-p67"></A><b>11.</b> <i>If we have sown unto you spiritual things</i>  There was one cavil remaining &#8212; for it might be objected, that labors connected with this life should without doubt have food and clothing as their reward; and that plowing and thrashing yield fruit, of which those 			 that labor in these things are partakers; but that it is otherwise with the gospel, because its fruit is spiritual; and hence the minister of the word, if he would receive fruit corresponding to his labor, ought to demand nothing that is carnal. Lest any one, therefore, should cavil in this manner, he argues from the greater to the less. &#8220;Though food and clothing are not of the same nature with a minister&#8217;s labors, what injury do you sustain, if 			 you recompense what is inestimable with a thing that is small and contemptible?

<p><a name="xvi.ii-p25"></A><b>13.</b> <i>Know ye not,</i> Apart from the question that he discusses, he appears to have dwelt the longer in taking notice of this point, with the view of reproaching the Corinthians indirectly for their malignity in allowing the ministers of Christ to be reviled in a matter that was so 			 justifiable. For if Paul had not of his own accord refrained from using his liberty, there was a risk of the progress of the gospel being obstructed. Never would the false Apostles have gained that point, had not ingratitude, to which the Corinthians were already prone, opened up the way for their calumnies. For they ought to have repelled them sharply; but instead of this they showed themselves excessively credulous, so that they would have been prepared to reject the gospel, if Paul had used 			 his right. Such contempt of the gospel, and such cruelty towards their Apostle, deserved to be more severely reproved; but Paul, having found another occasion, touches upon it indirectly and mildly, with his usual modesty, that he may admonish them without affronting them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p26"></A>Again he makes use of a new comparison, to prove that he had not used the power that he had from the Lord. Nor does he any longer borrow examples from any other source, but shows that this has been appointed by the Lord &#8212; that the Churches should provide for the support of their ministers. There are some that think that there are <i>two </i>comparisons in this passage, and they refer the<i> former </i>to the Lord&#8217;s priests, and the <i>latter 			 </i>to those that acted as priests to the heathen gods. I am, however, rather of opinion that Paul expresses, as he is accustomed, the same thing by different terms. And, truly, it would have been a weak argument that was derived from the practice of the heathens, among whom the revenues of the priesthood were not devoted to food and clothing, but to magnificent dresses, royal splendor, and profuse luxury. These would, therefore, have been things too remote. I do not call it in question, 			 however, that he has pointed out different kinds of ministerial offices; for there were priests of a higher order, and there were afterwards Levites, who were inferior to them, as is well known; but that is not much to the point.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p27"></A>The sum is this &#8212; &#8220;The Levitical priests were ministers of the Israelitish Church; the Lord appointed <i>them </i>sustenance from their ministry; hence in ministers of the Christian Church the same equity must be observed at the present day. Now the ministers of the Christian Church are those that preach the gospel.&#8221; This passage is quoted by Canonists, when they wish to prove that idle bellies must be fattened up, in order that they may 			 perform their masses;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_487"><FONT SIZE="1">488</FONT></A>
 			 but how absurdly, I leave it to children themselves to judge. Whatever is stated in the Scriptures as to the support to be given to ministers, or the honor that is to be put upon them, they immediately seize hold of it, and twist it to their own advantage. For my part, however, I simply admonish my readers to consider attentively Paul&#8217;s words. He argues that pastors, who labor in the preaching of the gospel, ought to be supported, because the Lord in ancient times appointed sustenance 			 for the priests, on the ground of their serving the Church. Hence a distinction must be made between the ancient priesthood and that of the present day. Priests under the law were set apart to preside over the sacrifices, to serve the altar, and to take care of the tabernacle and temple. Those at the present day are set apart to preach the word and to dispense the sacraments. The Lord has appointed no sacrifices for his sacred ministers to be engaged in;  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_488"></A><A HREF="#fn_488"><FONT SIZE="1">489</FONT></A>
 			 there are no altars for them to stand at to offer sacrifices.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p30"></A>Hence appears the absurdity of those who apply this comparison, taken from sacrifices, to anything else than to the preaching of the gospel. Nay farther, it may be readily inferred from this passage, that all Popish priests, from the head himself to the lowest member, are guilty of sacrilege, who devour the revenues appointed for true ministers, while they do not in any way discharge their duty. For what ministers does the 			 Apostle order to be maintained? Those that apply themselves to the preaching of the gospel. What right then have <i>they </i>to claim for themselves the revenues of the priesthood?   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_489"></A><A HREF="#fn_489"><FONT SIZE="1">490</FONT></A>
 			  &#8220;Because they hum a tune and perform mass.&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_490"></A><A HREF="#fn_490"><FONT SIZE="1">491</FONT></A>
 			  But God has enjoined upon them nothing of that sort. Hence it is evident that they seize upon the reward due to others. When, however, he says that the Levitical priests were <i>partakers with the altar</i>, and that they ate of the things of <i>the 			 Temple</i>, he marks out (<a name="xvi.ii-p32.2"></A>&#956;&#949;&#964;&#969;&#957;&#965;&#956;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#962;) by <i>metonymy</i>, the offerings that were presented to God. For they claimed to themselves the sacred victims entire, and of smaller 			 animals they took the right shoulder, and kidneys and tail, and, besides this, tithes, oblations, and first-fruits. The word <a name="xvi.ii-p32.3"></A>&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#8057;&#957;, therefore, in the <i>second </i>instance,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_491"></A><A HREF="#fn_491"><FONT SIZE="1">492</FONT></A>
 			  is taken to mean <i>the Temple.</i></p>

Nor is it to be wondered that he set so high a value upon this glorying, inasmuch as he saw that the authority of the gospel in some degree depended upon it. For he would in this way have given a handle to the false apostles to triumph over him. Hence<i> 			 </i>there was a danger, lest the Corinthians, despising him, should receive them with great applause. So much did he prefer, even before his own life, the power of advancing the gospel.</p>

<p><a name="xvi.ii-p37"></A><b>16.</b> <i>For if I preach the gospel.</i> To show how very important it was not to deprive himself of that ground of glorying, he intimates what would have happened, if he had simply discharged his ministry &#8212; that he would in this way have done nothing else than what the Lord had enjoined upon 			 him by a strict <i>necessity</i>  By doing <i>that</i>, he says, he would have had no occasion for glorying, as it was not in his power to avoid doing it.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_492"></A><A HREF="#fn_492"><FONT SIZE="1">493</FONT></A>
 			  It is asked, however, what <i>glorying </i>he here refers to, for he glories elsewhere in his <i>exercising </i>himself in the office of teaching <i>with a pure conscience</i>  (<a name="xvi.ii-p38.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003">2Ti 1:3</a><a name="xvi.ii-p38.2"></A>.) I answer, that he speaks of a glorying that he could bring forward in opposition to the false apostles, when they endeavored to find a pretext for reviling, as will appear more fully from what follows.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p39"></A>This is a remarkable statement, from which we learn, in the first place, what, as to ministers, is the nature, and what the closeness of the tie that is involved in their calling, and farther, what the pastoral office imports and includes. Let not the man, then, who has been once <i>called </i>to it, imagine that he is any longer at liberty to withdraw when he chooses, if, perhaps, 			 he is harassed with vexatious occurrences, or weighed down with misfortunes, for he is devoted to the Lord and to the Church, and bound by a sacred tie, which it were criminal to break asunder. As to the <i>second </i>point,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_493"><FONT SIZE="1">494</FONT></A>
 			  he says that a curse was ready to fall upon him, <i>if he did not preach the gospel</i>  Why? Because he has been called to it, and therefore is constrained by <i>necessity</i>  How, therefore, will any one who succeeds to his office avoid this <i>necessity</i>? What sort of successors, then, have the Apostles in the Pope and the other mitred bishops, who think that there is nothing that is more unbecoming their station, than the duty of teaching!</p>

 			  and what he had previously termed <i>glorying</i>  Others, however, interpret it otherwise &#8212; as meaning that a <i>reward</i> is set before all who discharge their duty faithfully and heartily. But, for 			 my part, I understand the man who <i>does this thing willingly,</i> to be the man who acts with such cheerfulness, that, being intent upon edifying, as his one object of desire, he declines nothing that he knows will be profitable to the Church; as, on the other hand, he terms those <i>unwilling</i>, who in their actings submit, indeed, to necessity, but act grudgingly, because it is not from inclination. For it always happens that the man who undertakes any business with zeal, is also prepared of his own accord to submit to everything, which, if left undone, would hinder the accomplishment of the work. Thus Paul, being one that acted <i>willingly</i>, did not teach in a mere perfunctory manner, but left nothing undone that he knew to be fitted to promote and further his doctrine. <i>This </i>then was his <i>recompense for labor</i>,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_495"></A><A HREF="#fn_495"><FONT SIZE="1">496</FONT></A>
 			  and <i>this </i>his ground of g<i>lorying</i> &#8212; that he did with readiness of mind forego his right in respect of his applying himself to the discharge of his office willingly and with fervent zeal.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p45"></A><i>But if unwillingly, a dispensation is committed to me.</i> In whatever way others explain these words, the natural meaning, in my opinion, is this &#8212; that God does not by any means approve of the service done by the man who performs it grudgingly, and, as it were, with a reluctant mind. Whenever, therefore, God has enjoined anything upon 			 us, we are mistaken, if we think that we have discharged it aright, when we perform it <i>grudgingly</i>; for the Lord requires that his servants be <i>cheerful</i>, (<a name="xvi.ii-p45.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#007">2Co 9:7</a><a name="xvi.ii-p45.1"></A>,) so as to 			 delight in obeying him, and manifest their cheerfulness by the promptitude with which they act. In short, Paul means, that he would act in accordance with his calling, only in the event of his performing his duty willingly and cheerfully.</p>

<p><a name="xvi.ii-p47"></A><b>18.</b> <i>What then is my reward? </i>He infers from what goes before, that he has a ground of glorying; in this, that he labored gratuitously in behalf of the Corinthians, because it appears from this, that he applied himself willingly to the office of teaching, inasmuch as he vigorously set himself to obviate all the 			 hindrances in the way of the gospel; and not satisfied with merely teaching, endeavored to further the doctrine of it by every method. This then is the sum. &#8220;I am under the necessity of preaching the gospel: if I do it not, wo is unto me, for I resist God&#8217;s calling. But it is not enough to preach, unless I do it willingly; for he who fulfils the commandment of God unwillingly, does not act, as becomes him, suitably to his office. But if I obey 			 God willingly, it will in that case be allowable for me to glory. Hence it was necessary for me to make the gospel <i>without charge</i>, that I might glory on good ground.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p48"></A>Papists endeavor from this passage to establish their contrivance as to works of <i>supererogation</i>.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_496"></A><A HREF="#fn_496"><FONT SIZE="1">497</FONT></A>
 			 &#8220;Paul,&#8221; they say, &#8220;would have fulfilled the duties of his office by preaching the gospel, but he adds something farther over and above. Hence he does something beyond what he is bound to do, for he distinguishes between what is done willingly and what is done from necessity.&#8221; I answer, that Paul, it is true, went a greater length than the ordinary calling of pastors required, because he refrained from taking pay, which the Lord allows pastors to take. But as it was a 			 part of his duty to provide against every occasion of offense that he foresaw, and as he saw, that the course of the gospel would be impeded, if he made use of his liberty, though that was out of the ordinary course, yet I maintain that even in that case he rendered to God nothing more than was due. For I ask: &#8220;Is it not the part of a good pastor to remove occasions of offense, so far as it is in his power to do so?&#8221; I ask again, &#8220;Did Paul do anything else than this?&#8221; There 			 is no ground, therefore, for imagining that he rendered to God anything that he did not owe to him, inasmuch as he did nothing but what the necessity of his office (though it was an extraordinary necessity) demanded. Away, then, with that wicked imagination,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_497"></A><A HREF="#fn_497"><FONT SIZE="1">498</FONT></A>
 			 that we compensate for our faults in the sight of God by works of <i>supererogation</i>.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_498"></A><A HREF="#fn_498"><FONT SIZE="1">499</FONT></A>
 			 Nay more, away with the very term, which is replete with diabolical pride.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_499"></A><A HREF="#fn_499"><FONT SIZE="1">500</FONT></A>
 			 This passage, assuredly, is mistakenly perverted to bear that meaning.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p53"></A>The error of Papists is refuted in a general way in this manner: Whatever works are comprehended under the law, are falsely termed works of <i>supererogation</i>, as is manifest from the words of Christ. (<a name="xvi.ii-p53.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk017.htm#010">Lu 17:10</a><a name="xvi.ii-p53.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xvi.ii-p54"></A>When ye have done all things that are commanded you, say, <br> 			 We are unprofitable servants: we have done what we were bound to do.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p55"></A>Now we acknowledge that no work is good and acceptable to God, that is not included in God&#8217;s law. This <i>second </i>statement I prove in this way: There are two classes of good works; for they are all reducible either to the service of God or to love. Now nothing belongs to <i>the service of God</i> 			 that is not included in this summary: <i>Thou shalt love the Lord with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy strength</i>  There is also no duty of <i>love </i>that is not required in that precept &#8212; <i>Love thy neighbor as thyself</i> <i> 			 </i>(<a name="xvi.ii-p55.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#030">Mark 12:30</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#031">31</a><a name="xvi.ii-p55.1"></A>.) But as to the objection that is brought forward by Papists, that it is possible for one to be acceptable, if he devotes the <i>tenth </i>part of his income, and infer from this, that if he goes so far as to devote the <i>fifth </i>part, he does a work of <i>supererogation</i>, it is easy to remove away this subtilty. For that the deeds of the pious are approved, is not by any means owing to their perfection, but it is because the imperfection and deficiency are not reckoned to their account. Hence even if they were doing an hundred-fold more than they do, they would not, even in that 			 case, exceed the limits of the duty that they owe.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p56"></A><i>That I may not abuse my power.</i> From this it appears, that such a use of our liberty as gives occasion of offense, is an uncontrolled liberty and abuse. We must keep, therefore, within bounds, that we may not give occasion of offense. This passage also confirms more fully what I just now touched upon, that Paul did nothing beyond what 			 the duty of his office required, because it was not proper that the liberty, that was allowed him by God, should be in any way abused.</p>

The <i>general </i>observation is this &#8212; that while he was not under the power of any one, he lived as if he had been subject to the inclination of all, and of his own accord subjected himself to <i>the weak</i>, to whom he was under no subjection. The <i>particular </i>instances are these &#8212; that among the Gentiles he lived as if he were a Gentile, and among the Jews he acted as a Jew: that is, while among Jews he carefully observed the ceremonies of the law, he was no less careful not to give occasion of offense to the Gentiles by the observance of them.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p59"></A>He adds the particle <i>as</i>, to intimate that his liberty was not at all impaired on that account, for, however he might accommodate himself to men, he nevertheless remained always like himself inwardly in the sight of God. To <i>become all things</i> is to assume all appearances, as the case <i>may </i>require, or to put on different characters, according to the diversity among individuals. As to what he says respecting his <i>being without law</i> and <i>under the law</i>, you must understand it simply in reference to the ceremonial department; for the department connected with morals was common to Jews and Gentiles alike, and it would not have been allowable for Paul to gratify men to that extent. For this doctrine holds good only as to things indifferent, as has been previously remarked.</p>

<p><a name="xvi.ii-p61"></A><b>21.</b> <i>Though not without law to God.</i> He wished by this parenthesis to soften the harshness of the expression, for it might. have seemed harsh at first view to have it said, that he <i>had come to be without law.</i> Hence in order that this might not be taken in a wrong sense, he had added, by way of correction, that he had always kept in view one law &#8212; that of subjection to Christ. By this too he hints that odium was excited against him groundlessly and unreasonably, as if he called men to an unbridled licentiousness, while he taught exemption from the bondage of the Mosaic law. Now he calls it expressly <i>the law of 			 Christ</i>, in order to wipe away the groundless reproach, with which the false apostles branded the gospel, for he means, that in the doctrine of Christ nothing is omitted, that might serve to give us a perfect rule of upright. living.</p>

<p><a name="xvi.ii-p63"></A><b>22.</b> <i>To the weak I became as weak</i>  Now again he employs a general statement, in which he shows to what sort of persons he accomodated himself, and with what design. He judaized in the presence of the Jews, but not before them all, for there were many headstrong 			 persons, who, under the influence of Pharisaical pride or malice, would have wished that Christian liberty were altogether taken away. To those persons he would never have been so accommodating, for Christ would not have us care for persons of that sort.</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xvi.ii-p64"></A>Let them alone, (says he,) they are blind, and leaders of the blind. (<a name="xvi.ii-p64.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#014">Mt 15:14</a><a name="xvi.ii-p64.1"></A>.)</p>

</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p67"></A>Now his <i>design </i>was, that he might bring them to Christ &#8212; not that he might promote his own advantage, or retain their good will. To these things a <i>third </i>must be added &#8212; that it was only in things indifferent, that are otherwise in our choice, that he accommodated himself to the weak. Now, if we consider how great a man Paul was, who stooped thus far, ought we not to feel ashamed &#8212; we who are next to nothing in comparison 			 with him &#8212; if, bound up in self, we look with disdain upon the weak, and do not deign to yield up a single point to them? But while it is proper that we should accommodate ourselves to the weak, according to the Apostle&#8217;s injunction, and that, in things indifferent, and with a view to their edification, those act an improper part, who, with the view of consulting their own ease, avoid those things that would offend men, and the wicked, too, rather than the weak. Those, however, commit a 			 two-fold error, who do not distinguish between things indifferent and things unlawful, and accordingly do not hesitate, for the sake of pleasing men, to engage in things that the Lord has prohibited. The crowning point, however, of the evil is this &#8212; that they abuse this statement of Paul to excuse their wicked dissimulation. But if any one will keep in view these three things that I have briefly pointed out, he will have it easily in his power to refute those persons.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p68"></A>We must observe, also, the word that he makes use of in the concluding clause;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_501"></A><A HREF="#fn_501"><FONT SIZE="1">502</FONT></A>
 			  for he shows for what purpose he endeavors to <i>gain </i>all &#8212; with a view to their salvation. At the same time, he here at length modifies the general statement, unless perhaps you prefer the rendering of the old translation, which is found even at this day in some Greek manuscripts.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_502"></A><A HREF="#fn_502"><FONT SIZE="1">503</FONT></A>
 			  For in this place, too, he repeats it &#8212; <i>that I may by all means save some</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_503"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">504</FONT></A>
 			  But as the indulgent temper, that Paul speaks of, has sometimes no good effect, this limitation is very suitable &#8212; that, although he might not do good to all, he, nevertheless, had never left off consulting the advantage of at least a few.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_504"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">505</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xvi.iii-p16"></A><b>23.</b> <i>That I may become a partaker of it.</i> As the Corinthians might think with themselves, that this was a peculiarity in Paul&#8217;s case on the ground of his office, he argues, from the very design of it, that this is common to all Christians. For when he declares, that his aim had been, 			 that he <i>might become a partaker of the gospel</i>, he indirectly intimates, that all who do not act the same part with him are unworthy of the fellowship of the gospel. To <i>become a partaker of the gospel</i> is to receive the fruit of 			 it.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.iii-p17"></A><a name="xvi.iii-p17.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.iii-p18"></A><b>24.</b> <i>Know ye not, that they who run in a race.</i> He has laid down the doctrine, and now, with the view of impressing it upon the minds of the Corinthians, he adds an exhortation. He states briefly, that what they had hitherto attained was nothing, unless they steadfastly persevered, 			 inasmuch as it is not enough to have once entered on the Lord&#8217;s way, if they do not strive until they reach the goal, agreeably to that declaration of Christ &#8212; <i>He</i> <i>that shall endure unto the end</i>, etc. (<a name="xvi.iii-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#022">Mt 10:22</a><a name="xvi.iii-p18.1"></A>.) Now he borrows a 			 similitude from the race-course.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">508</FONT></A>
 			  For as in that case many descend into the arena, but he alone is crowned who has first reached the goal, so there is no reason why any one should feel satisfied with himself on the ground of his having once entered upon the race prescribed in the gospel, unless he persevere in it until death. There is, however, this difference between our contest and theirs, that among them only <i>one</i> is victorious, and obtains the 			 palm &#8212; the man who has got before all the others;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">509</FONT></A>
 			  but our condition is superior in this respect, that there may be <i>many </i>at the same time.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">510</FONT></A>
 			  For God requires from us nothing more than that we press on vigorously until we reach the goal.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">511</FONT></A>
 			  Thus one does not hinder another: nay more, those who run in the Christian race are mutually helpful to each other. He expresses the same sentiment in another form in <a name="xvi.iii-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005">2Ti 2:5</a><a name="xvi.iii-p22.2"></A>,</p>  		  
<p class="Center"><a name="xvi.iii-p23"></A>If any one striveth, he is not crowned, unless he strives lawfully.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.iii-p24"></A><i>So run.</i> Here we have the application of the similitude &#8212; that it is not enough to have set out, if we do not continue to run during our whole life. For our life is like a race-course. We must not therefore become wearied after a short time, like one that stops short in the middle of the race-course, but instead of this, death alone 			 must put a period to our running. The particle <a name="xvi.iii-p24.1"></A>&#8005;&#965;&#964;&#969;, (<i>so</i>,) may be taken in two ways. Chrysostom connects it with what goes before, in this manner: as those who run do not stop running until they have reached the goal, so do ye also persevere, and do 			 not stop running so long as you live. It will, however, correspond not inaptly with what follows. &#8220;You must not run <i>so </i>as to stop short in the middle of the race-course, but <i>so </i>as to obtain the prize.&#8221; As to the term <i>stadium</i>, (<i>race-course</i>,) and the different kinds of races,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">512</FONT></A>

 			  but in so far as was required by the subject in hand, within which he confines himself &#8212; how far they ought to yield to the weakness of the brethren.

 			  and that sparingly and not to the full, voluntarily deny themselves every delicacy, in order that they may have more agility for the combat, and they do this, too, for the sake of <i>a corruptible crown</i>  But if they value so highly a crown of leaves that quickly fades, what value ought we to set upon a crown of immortality? Let 			 us not, therefore, think it hard to give up a little of our right. It is well known that wrestlers were contented with the most frugal diet, so that their simple fare has become proverbial.</p>
