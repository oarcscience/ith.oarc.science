<span id="xix-p1"></span>CHAPTER 12

<span id="xix.i"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p1"></span><span id="xix.i-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
12:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#001.md)<span id="xix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p2"></span>**1.** Now concerning spiritual *gifts*,
brethren, I would not have you ignorant.

<span id="xix.i-p3"></span>**1.** Porro de spiritualibus, fratres, nolo
vos ignorare.

<span id="xix.i-p4"></span>**2.** Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried
away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.

<span id="xix.i-p5"></span>**2.** Scitis, quum Gentes eratis, qualiter
simulacra muta, prout ducebamini, sequuti sitis.

<span id="xix.i-p6"></span>**3.** Wherefore I give you to understand,
that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed; and
*that* no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.

<span id="xix.i-p7"></span>**3.** Quamobrem notum vobis facio, quod nemo
in Spiritu Dei loquens, dicit anathema Iesum: et nemo potest dicere
Dominum Iesum, nisi per Spiritum sanctum.

<span id="xix.i-p8"></span>**4.** Now there are diversities of gifts,
but the same Spirit.

<span id="xix.i-p9"></span>**4.** Divisiones autem donorum sunt, sed
unus Spiritus.

<span id="xix.i-p10"></span>**5.** And there are differences of
administrations, but the same Lord.

<span id="xix.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et divisiones ministeriorum aunt, sed
unus Dominus.

<span id="xix.i-p12"></span>**6.** And there are diversities of
operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.

<span id="xix.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et divisiones facultatum sunt, sed
Deus unus, qui operatur omnia in omnibus.

<span id="xix.i-p14"></span>**7.** But the manifestation of the Spirit
is given to every man to profit withal.

<span id="xix.i-p15"></span>**7.** Unicuique autem datur manifestatio
Spiritus ad utilitatem.

<span id="xix.i-p16"></span> 

<span id="xix.i-p17"></span><span id="xix.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p18"></span>**1.** *Now concerning spiritual things.* He
goes on to correct another fault. As the Corinthians abused the gifts of
God for ostentation and show, and love was little, if at all, regarded,
he shows them for what purpose believers are adorned by God with
spiritual gifts — for the edification of their brethren. This
proposition, however, he divides into two parts; for, in the *first*
place, he teaches, that God is the author of those gifts, and,
*secondly,* having established this, he reasons as to their design. He
proves from their own experience, that those things in which they
gloried, are bestowed upon men through the exercise of God’s favor; for
he reminds them how ignorant they were, and stupid, and destitute of all
spiritual light, previously to God’s calling them. Hence it appears,
that they had been furnished with them — not by nature, but through
God’s unmerited benignity.

<span id="xix.i-p19"></span>As to the words; when he says — *I would not
that ye should be ignorant,* we must supply the expression — *as* *to
what is right,* or *as to what is your duty,* or some similar
expression; and by *spiritual things* he means *spiritual gifts,* as to
which we shall have occasion to see afterwards. In what follows there is
a twofold reading; for some manuscripts have simply <span
id="xix.i-p19.1"></span>ὅτι others add <span
id="xix.i-p19.2"></span>ὅτε. The former means *because* — assigning a
reason: the latter means *when;* and this latter reading suits much
better. But besides this diversity, the construction is in other
respects confused; but still, the meaning is evident. Literally, it is
this — *Ye know, that when ye were Gentiles, after dumb idols, according
as ye were led, following* I have, however, faithfully given Paul’s
meaning. By *dumb idols* he means — having neither feeling nor motion.

<span id="xix.i-p20"></span>Let us learn from this passage how great is
the blindness of the human mind: when it is without the illumination of
the Holy Spirit, inasmuch as it stands in amazement at *dumb idols,*
 <span id="fr_725"></span>[726](#fn_725.md) and cannot rise higher in
searching after God; nay more, it is *led* by Satan as if it were a
brute.  <span id="fr_726"></span>[727](#fn_726.md) He makes use of the term
*Gentiles* here, in the same sense as in <span
id="xix.i-p22.3"></span>[Eph 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012.md)<span
id="xix.i-p22.3"></span>.

<span id="xix.i-p23"></span>Ye were at one time Gentiles, says he,
without God,  
strangers to the hope of salvation, etc.

<span id="xix.i-p24"></span>Perhaps, too, he reasons by way of contrast.
What if  <span id="fr_727"></span>[728](#fn_727.md) they should now show
themselves to be less submissive to God, after his having taken them
under his care, to be governed by his word and Spirit, than they
formerly discovered themselves to be forward and compliant, in following
the suggestions of Satan!

<span id="xix.i-p26"></span><span id="xix.i-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p27"></span>**3.** *Wherefore I give you to know.*
Having admonished them from their own experience, he sets before them a
general doctrine, which he deduces from it; for what the Corinthians had
experienced in themselves is common to all mankind — to wander on in
error,  <span id="fr_728"></span>[729](#fn_728.md) previously to their
being brought back, through the kindness of God, into the way of truth.
Hence it is necessary that we should be directed by the Spirit of God,
or we shall wander on for ever. From this, too, it follows, that all
things that pertain to the true knowledge of God, are the gifts of the
Holy Spirit,. He at the same time derives an argument from opposite
causes to opposite effects. *No one, speaking by the Spirit of God, can
revile Christ;* so, on the other hand, *no one can speak well of Christ,
but by the Spirit of Christ.* To *say that Jesus is accursed* is utter
blasphemy against him. To *say that Jesus is the Lord,* is to speak of
him in honorable terms and with reverence, and to extol his majesty.

<span id="xix.i-p29"></span>Here it is asked — “As the wicked sometimes
speak of Christ in honorable and magnificent terms, is this an
indication that they have the Spirit of God?” I answer — “They
undoubtedly have, so far as that effect is concerned; but the gift of
regeneration is one thing, and the gift of bare intelligence, with which
Judas himself was endowed, when he preached the gospel, is quite
another.” Hence, too, we perceive how great our weakness is, as we
cannot so much as move our tongue for the celebration of God’s praise,
unless it be governed by his Spirit. Of this the Scripture, also,
frequently reminds us, and the saints everywhere acknowledge that unless
the Lord open their mouths, they are not fit to be the heralds of his
praise. Among others, Isaiah says — I am a man of unclean lips, etc.
(<span id="xix.i-p29.1"></span>[Isa
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#005)<span id="xix.i-p29.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.i-p30"></span><span id="xix.i-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p31"></span>**4.** *Now there are diversities of gifts*
The symmetry of the Church  <span id="fr_729"></span>[730](#fn_729.md)
consists, so to speak, of a manifold unity,  <span
id="fr_730"></span>[731](#fn_730.md) that is, when the variety of gifts is
directed to the same object, as in music there are different sounds, but
suited to each other with such an adaptation, as to produce concord.
Hence it is befitting that there should be a distinction of gifts as
well as of offices, and yet all harmonize in one. Paul, accordingly, in
<span id="xix.i-p33.2"></span>[Ro
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#006.md)<span id="xix.i-p33.2"></span>,
commends this variety, that no one may, by rashly intruding himself into
another’s place, confound the distinction which the Lord has
established. Hence he orders every one to be contented with his own
gifts, and cultivate the particular department that has been assigned to
him.  <span id="fr_731"></span>[732](#fn_731.md) He prohibits them from
going beyond their own limits by a foolish ambition. In fine, he exhorts
that every one should consider how much has been given him, what measure
has been allotted to him, and to what he has been called. Here, on the
other hand, he orders every one to bring what he has to the common heap,
and not keep back the gifts of God in the way of enjoying every one his
own, apart from the others,  <span id="fr_732"></span>[733](#fn_732.md) but
aim unitedly at the edification of all in common. In both passages, he
brings forward the similitude of the human body, but, as may be
observed, on different accounts. The sum of what he states amounts to
this — that gifts are not distributed thus variously among believers, in
order that they may be used apart, but that in the division there is a
unity, inasmuch as one Spirit is the source of all those gifts, one God
is the Lord of all administrations, and the author of all exercises of
power. Now God, who is the beginning, ought also to be the end.

<span id="xix.i-p36"></span>*One Spirit* This passage ought to be
carefully observed in opposition to fanatics,  <span
id="fr_733"></span>[734](#fn_733.md) who think that the name Spirit means
nothing essential, but merely the gifts or actions of divine power.
Here, however, Paul plainly testifies, that there is *one* essential
power of God, whence all his works proceed. The term Spirit, it is true,
is sometimes transferred by metonymy to the gifts themselves. Hence we
read of the Spirit of knowledge — of judgment — of fortitude — of
modesty.  <span id="fr_734"></span>[735](#fn_734.md) Paul, however, here
plainly testifies that judgment, and knowledge, and gentleness, and all
other gifts, proceed from *one* source. For it is the office of the Holy
Spirit to put forth and exercise the power of God by conferring these
gifts upon men, and distributing them among them.

<span id="xix.i-p39"></span>*One Lord.* The ancients made use of this
testimony in opposition to the Arians, for the purpose of maintaining a
Trinity of persons. For there is mention made here of *the Spirit,*
secondly of *the Lord,* and lastly of *God*, and to these Three, one and
the same operation is ascribed. Thus, by the name *Lord,* they
understood Christ. But for my part, though I have no objection to its
being understood in this way, I perceive, at the same time, that it is a
weak argument for stopping the mouths of Arians; for there is a
correspondence between the word *administrations* and the word *Lord.
The administrations,* says Paul, *are different,* but there is only one
God whom we must serve, whatever *administration* we discharge. This
antithesis, then, shows what is the simple meaning, so that to confine
it to Christ is rather forced.

<span id="xix.i-p40"></span><span id="xix.i-p40.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p41"></span>**6.** *One God that worketh.* Where we use
the word *powers* the Greek term is <span
id="xix.i-p41.1"></span>ἐνεργήματα*,* a term which contains an allusion
to the verb *worketh,* as in Latin <span
id="xix.i-p41.2"></span>*effectus* (an effect) corresponds with the verb
<span id="xix.i-p41.3"></span>*effectus* (to effect.) Paul’s meaning is,
that although believers may be endowed with different powers, they all
take their rise from one and the same power on the part of God. Hence
the expression employed here — *worketh all things in all* — does not
refer to the general providence of God, but to the liberality that he
exercises towards us, in bestowing upon every one some gift. The sum is
this — that there is nothing in mankind that is good or praiseworthy but
what comes from God alone. Hence it is out of place here to agitate the
question — in what manner God acts in Satan and in reprobates.

<span id="xix.i-p42"></span><span id="xix.i-p42.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p43"></span>**7.** *But the manifestation of the Spirit
is given to every man* He now points out the purpose for which God has
appointed his gifts, for he does not confer them upon us in vain, nor
does he intend that they shall serve the purpose of ostentation. Hence
we must inquire as to the purpose for which they are conferred. As to
this Paul answers — (*with a view to utility)* — <span
id="xix.i-p43.1"></span>πρὸς τὸ συμφερον; that is, that the Church may
receive advantage thereby. *The manifestation of the Spirit* may be
taken in a passive as well as in an active sense — in a *passive* sense,
because wherever there is prophecy, or knowledge, or any other gift, the
Spirit of God does there *manifest* himself — in an *active* sense,
because the Spirit of God, when he enriches us with any gift, unlocks
his treasures, for the purpose of *manifesting to* us those things that
would otherwise have been concealed and shut up. The second
interpretation suits better. The view taken by Chrysostom is rather
harsh and forced — that this term is used,  <span
id="fr_735"></span>[736](#fn_735.md) because unbelievers do not recognize
God, except by visible miracles.

<span id="xix.ii"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p1"></span><span id="xix.ii-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
12:8-13](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#008.md)<span id="xix.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p2"></span>**8.** For to one is given by the Spirit the
word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;

<span id="xix.ii-p3"></span>**8.** Huic quidem per Spiritum datur sermo
sapientiae, alteri datur sermo cognitionis, secundum eundem Spiritum.

<span id="xix.ii-p4"></span>**9.** To another faith by the same Spirit;
to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;

<span id="xix.ii-p5"></span>**9.** Alii fides in eodem Spiritu, alii
dona sanationum in codera Spritu.

<span id="xix.ii-p6"></span>**10.** To another the working of miracles;
to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another
*divers* kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:

<span id="xix.ii-p7"></span>**10.** Alii facultates potentiarum, alii
autem prophetia, alii autem discretiones spirituum, alii genera
linguarum, alii interpretatio linguarum.

<span id="xix.ii-p8"></span>**11.** But all these worketh that one and
the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.

<span id="xix.ii-p9"></span>**11.** Porroomnia haec efficit unus et idem
Spiritus, distribuens seorsum cuique prout vult.

<span id="xix.ii-p10"></span>**12.** For as the body is one, and hath
many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one
body: so also *is* Christ.

<span id="xix.ii-p11"></span>**12.** Quemadmodum enim corpus unum est,
et membra habet multa: onmia autem membra corporis unius quum multa
sint, corpus autem est unum: ita et Christus.

<span id="xix.ii-p12"></span>**13.** For by one Spirit are we all
baptized into one body, whether *we be* Jews or Gentiles, whether *we
be* bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.

<span id="xix.ii-p13"></span>**13.** Etenim per unum Spiritum nos omnes
in unum corpus baptizati sumus, sive Iudaei, sive Graeci: sive servi,
sive liberi: et omnes in uno Spiritu potum hausimus.

<span id="xix.ii-p14"></span> 

<span id="xix.ii-p15"></span><span id="xix.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p16"></span>**8.** *To one is given* He now subjoins an
enumeration, or, in other words, specifies particular kinds — not indeed
all of them, but such as are sufficient for his present purpose.
*“Believers,”* says he, *“are* endowed with different gifts, but let
every one *acknowledge,* that he is indebted for whatever he has to the
Spirit of God, for he pours forth his gifts as the sun scatters his rays
in every direction. As to the *difference* between these gifts,
*knowledge* (or understanding) and *wisdom* are taken in different
senses in the Scriptures, but here I take them in the way of less and
greater, as in <span id="xix.ii-p16.2"></span>[Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003.md)<span id="xix.ii-p16.2"></span>,
where they are also joined together, when Paul says, that *in Christ are
hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Knowledge,* therefore, in
my opinion, means *acquaintance with sacred things* — *Wisdom,* on the
other hand, means the perfection of it. Sometimes *prudence* is put, as
it were, in the middle place between these two, and in that case it
denotes skill  <span id="fr_736"></span>[737](#fn_736.md) in applying
knowledge to some useful purpose. They are, it is true, *very* nearly
allied; but still you observe a difference when they are put together.
Let us then take *knowledge* as meaning *ordinary information,* and
*wisdom,* as including revelations that are of a more secret and sublime
order.  <span id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md)

<span id="xix.ii-p19"></span>The term *faith* is employed here to mean a
special faith, as we shall afterwards see from the context. A special
faith is of such a kind as does not apprehend Christ wholly, for
redemption, righteousness, and sanctification, but only in so far as
miracles are performed in his name. Judas had a faith of this kind, and
he wrought miracles too by means of it. Chrysostom distinguishes it in a
somewhat different manner, calling it the faith of miracles, not of
doctrines.  <span id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md) This, however, does
not differ much from the interpretation previously mentioned. By the
*gift of healings*  <span id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md) every one
knows what is meant.

<span id="xix.ii-p22"></span>As to the *workings of powers,* or, as some
render it, the *operations of influences,* there is more occasion for
doubt. I am inclined, however, to think, that what is meant is the
influence which is exercised against devils, and also against
hypocrites. When, therefore, Christ and his Apostles by authority
restrained devils, or put them to flight, that was <span
id="xix.ii-p22.1"></span>ἐνέργημα*, (powerful working,)* and, in like
manner, when Paul smote the sorcerer with blindness, (<span
id="xix.ii-p22.2"></span>[Ac
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#011)<span id="xix.ii-p22.2"></span>,.md)
and when Peter struck Ananias and Sapphira dead upon the spot with a
single word. The gifts of *healing* and of miracles, therefore, serve to
manifest the goodness of God, but this last, his severity for the
destruction of Satan.  <span id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md)

<span id="xix.ii-p24"></span>*By prophecy,* I understand the singular
and choice endowment of unfolding the secret will of God, so that a
Prophet is a messenger, as it were, between God and man.  <span
id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md) My reason for taking this view will be
explained more fully afterwards.

<span id="xix.ii-p26"></span>The *discerning of spirits,* was a
clearness of perception in forming a judgment as to those who professed
to be *something*. (<span id="xix.ii-p26.1"></span>[Ac
5:36](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#036)<span id="xix.ii-p26.1"></span>..md)
I speak not of that natural wisdom, by which we are regulated in
judging. It was a special illumination, with which some were endowed by
the gift of God. The use of it was this: that they might not be imposed
upon by masks, of mere pretences,  <span
id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742.md) but might by that spiritual judgment
distinguish, as by a particular mark, the true ministers of Christ from
the false.

<span id="xix.ii-p28"></span>There was a difference between the
*knowledge of tongues,* and the *interpretation* of them, for those who
were endowed with the former were, in many cases, not acquainted with
the language of the nation with which they had to deal. The
*interpreters*  <span id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md) rendered foreign
tongues into the native language. These endowments they did not at that
time acquire by labor or study, but were put in possession of them by a
wonderful revelation of the Spirit.  <span
id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744.md)

<span id="xix.ii-p33"></span><span id="xix.ii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p34"></span>**11.** *One and the same spirit
distributing.* Hence it follows that those act amiss who, having no
concern as to participation, break asunder that holy harmony, that is
fitly adjusted in all its parts, only when under the guidance of the
same Spirit, all conspire toward one and the same object. He again calls
the Corinthians to unity, by reminding them that all have derived from
one fountain whatever they possess, while he instructs them, at the same
time, that no one has so much as to have enough within himself, so as
not to require help from others. For this is what he means by these
words — *distributing to every one severally as he willeth* The Spirit
of God, therefore, distributes them among us, in order that we may make
all contribute to the common advantage. To no one does he give all, lest
any one, satisfied with his particular portion, should separate himself
from others, and live solely for himself. The same idea is intended in
the adverb *severally,* as it is of great importance to understand
accurately that diversity by which God unites us mutually to one
another.  <span id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745.md) Now, when *will* is
ascribed to the Spirit, and that, too, in connection with power, we may
conclude from this, that the Spirit is truly and properly God.

<span id="xix.ii-p36"></span><span id="xix.ii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p37"></span>**12.** *For as the body is one* He now
derives a similitude from the human body, which he makes use of also in
<span id="xix.ii-p37.1"></span>[Ro
12:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#004.md)<span id="xix.ii-p37.1"></span>;
but it is for a different purpose, as I have already stated above. In
that passage, he exhorts every one to be satisfied with his own calling,
and not to invade another’s territory; as ambition, curiosity, or some
other disposition, induces many to take in hand more than is expedient.
Here, however, he exhorts believers to cleave to each other in a mutual
distribution of gifts, as they were not conferred upon them by God that
every one should enjoy his own separately, but that one should help
another. It is usual, however, for any society of men, or congregation,
to be called a *body,* as one city constitutes a *body,* and so, in like
manner, one senate, and one people. Monenius Agrippa,  <span
id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746.md) too, in ancient times, when desirous
to conciliate the Roman people, when at variance with the senate, made
use of an apologue, not very unlike the doctrine of Paul here.  <span
id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md) Among Christians, however, the case is
very different; for they do not constitute a mere political body, but
are the spiritual and mystical body of Christ, as Paul himself
afterwards adds. (<span id="xix.ii-p39.2"></span>[1Co
12:27](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#027)<span id="xix.ii-p39.2"></span>..md)
The meaning therefore *is* — “Though the members of the body are
various, and have different functions, they are, nevertheless, linked
together in such a manner that they coalesce in one.  <span
id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md) We, accordingly, who are members of
Christ, although we are endowed with various gifts, ought,
notwithstanding, to have an eye to that connection which we have in
Christ.”

<span id="xix.ii-p41"></span>*So also is Christ* The name of Christ is
used here instead of the Church, because the similitude was intended to
apply not to God’s only-begotten Son, but to us. It is a passage that is
full of choice consolation, inasmuch as he calls the Church *Christ;*
for Christ  <span id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749.md) confers upon us this
honor — that he is willing to be esteemed and recognised, not in himself
merely, but also in his members. Hence the same Apostle says elsewhere,
(<span id="xix.ii-p42.2"></span>[Eph
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#023)<span id="xix.ii-p42.2"></span>,.md)
that the Church is his *completion,*  <span
id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md) as though he would, if separated from
his members, be incomplete. And certainly, as Augustine elegantly
expresses himself in one part of his writings —

<span id="xix.ii-p44"></span>“Since we are *in* Christ a fruit-bearing
vine, what are we *out of* him but dry twigs?” (<span
id="xix.ii-p44.1"></span>[Joh
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#004)<span id="xix.ii-p44.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.ii-p45"></span>In this, then, our consolation lies — that,
as he and the Father are one, so we are one with him. Hence it is that
his name is applied to us.

<span id="xix.ii-p46"></span><span id="xix.ii-p46.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p47"></span>**13.** *For we are all baptized by one
Spirit.* Here there is a proof brought forward from the effect of
baptism. *“We* are,” says he, *“engrafted* by baptism into Christ’s
body, so that we are by a mutual link bound together as members, and
live one and the same life. Hence every one, that would remain in the
Church of Christ, must necessarily cultivate this fellowship.” He
speaks, however, of the baptism of believers, which is efficacious
through the grace of the Spirit, for, in the case of many, baptism is
merely in the letter — the symbol without the reality; but believers,
along with the sacrament, receive the reality. Hence, with respect to
God, this invariably holds good — that baptism is an engrafting into the
body of Christ, for God in that ordinance does not represent anything
but what he is prepared to accomplish, provided we are on our part
capable of it. The Apostle, also, observes here a most admirable medium,
in teaching that the nature of baptism is — to connect us with Christ’s
body. Lest any one, however, should imagine, that this is effected by
the outward symbol, he adds that it is the work of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="xix.ii-p48"></span>*Whether Jews or Greeks.* He specifies
these instances, to intimate, that no diversity of condition obstructs
that holy unity which he recommends. This clause, too, is added suitably
and appropriately, for envy might at that time arise from two sources —
because the *Jews* were not willing that the Gentiles should be put upon
a level with them; and, where one had some excellence above others, with
the view of maintaining his superiority, lie withdrew himself to a
distance from his brethren.

<span id="xix.ii-p49"></span>*We have all drunk in one Spirit.* It is
literally, “We have drunk *into* one Spirit,” but it would seem that, in
order that the two words <span id="xix.ii-p49.1"></span>ἐν (in) and
<span id="xix.ii-p49.2"></span>ἑν (one) might not immediately follow
each other, Paul intentionally changed <span id="xix.ii-p49.3"></span>ἐν
*(in)* into <span id="xix.ii-p49.4"></span>ἐις *(into,)* as he is
accustomed frequently to do. Hence his meaning seems rather to be, that
we are made to drink through the influence, as he had said before, of
the Spirit of Christ, than that we have drunk into the same Spirit. It
is uncertain, however, whether he speaks here of Baptism or of the
Supper. I am rather inclined, however, to understand him as referring to
the Supper, as he makes mention of *drinking,* for I have no doubt that
he intended to make an allusion to the similitude of the sign. There is,
however, no correspondence between *drinking* and baptism. Now, though
the cup forms but the half of the Supper, there is no difficulty arising
from that, for it is a common thing in Scripture to speak of the
sacraments by synecdoche.  <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md) Thus
he mentioned above in the tenth chapter (<span
id="xix.ii-p50.1"></span>[1Co
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#017)<span id="xix.ii-p50.1"></span>.md)
simply the *bread,* making no mention of the cup. The meaning,
therefore, will be this — that participation in the cup has an eye to
this — that we drink, all of us, of the same cup. For in that ordinance
we drink of the life-giving blood of Christ, that we may have life in
common with him — which we truly have, when he lives in us by his
Spirit. He teaches, therefore, that believers, so soon as they are
initiated by the baptism of Christ, are already imbued with a desire of
cultivating mutual unity,  <span id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752.md) and
then afterwards, when they receive the sacred Supper, they are again
conducted by degrees to the same unity, as they are all refreshed at the
same time with the same drink.

<span id="xix.iii-p18"></span>**22.** Nay, much more those members of
the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:

<span id="xix.iii-p19"></span>**22.** Quin potius, quae infirmiora

<span id="xix.iii-p20"></span>**23.** And those *members* of the body,
which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant
honour; and our uncomely *parts* have more abundant comeliness.

<span id="xix.iii-p21"></span>**23.** Et quae iudicamus viliora esse in
corpore, his abundantiorem honorem circumdamus: et quae minus honesta
sunt in nobis, plus decoris habent.

<span id="xix.iii-p22"></span>**24.** For our comely *parts* have no
need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more
abundant honour to that *part* which lacked:

<span id="xix.iii-p23"></span>**24.** Quae autem decora sunt in nobis,
non habent opus, sed Deus contemperavit corpus, tribuens henorem
abundantiorem opus habenti,

<span id="xix.iii-p24"></span>**25.** That there should be no schism in
the body; but *that* the members should have the same care one for
another.

<span id="xix.iii-p25"></span>**25.** Ut ne dissidium esset in corpore,
sed ut membra alia pro aliis invicem eandem sollicitudinem ha beant.

<span id="xix.iii-p26"></span>**26.** And whether one member suffer, all
the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members
rejoice with it.

<span id="xix.iii-p27"></span>**26.** Et sive patitur unum membrum,
compatiuntur omnia membra: sive glorificatur unum membrum, congaudent
omnia membra.

<span id="xix.iii-p28"></span>**27.** Now ye are the body of Christ, and
members in particular.

<span id="xix.iii-p29"></span>**27.** Vos autem estis corpus Christi, et
membra ex parte.

<span id="xix.iii-p30"></span> 

<span id="xix.iii-p31"></span><span id="xix.iii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p32"></span>**15.** This is a bringing out still
farther *(*<span id="xix.iii-p32.1"></span>ἐπεξεργασία*)* of the
preceding statement, or in other words, an exposition of it, with some
amplification, with the view of placing in a clearer light, what he had
previously stated in a few words. Now all this accords with the apologue
of Menenius Agrippa. “Should a dissension break out in the body, so that
the feet would refuse to discharge their office to the rest of the body,
and the belly in like manner, and the eyes, and the hands, what would be
the effect? Would not the result be — the destruction of the whole
body?” At the same time Paul here insists more particularly on this one
point — that each member ought to rest satisfied with its own place and
station, and not envy the others, for he institutes a comparison between
the more distinguished members, and those that have less dignity. For
the *eye* has a more honorable place in the body than the *hand,* and
the *hand* than the *foot* But if our hands were, from a feeling of
envy, to refuse to discharge their office, would nature endure this?
Would the hand be listened to, when wishing to be separated from the
body?

<span id="xix.iii-p33"></span>*To be not of the body,* means here — to
have no communication with the other members, but to live for itself,
and to seek only its own advantage. “Would it then,” says Paul, “be
allowable for the hand to refuse to do its office to the other members,
on the ground of its bearing envy to the eyes?” These things are said of
the natural body, but they must be applied to the members of the Church,
lest ambition or misdirected emulation and envy should be the occasion
of bad feeling among us,  <span id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753.md) so as
to lead one that occupies an inferior station to grudge to afford his
services to those above him.

<span id="xix.iii-p35"></span><span id="xix.iii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p36"></span>**17.** *If the whole body were an eye* He
sets aside a foolish aiming at equality, by showing the impossibility of
it. “If all the members,” says he, “desire the honor that belongs to the
*eye,* the consequence will be, that the whole body will perish; for it
is impossible that the body should remain safe and sound, if the members
have not different functions, and a mutual correspondence between them.
Hence equality interferes with the welfare of the body, because it
produces a confusion that entails present ruin. What madness, then,
would it be, should one member, instead of giving way to another,  <span
id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754.md) conspire for its own ruin and that of
the body!”

<span id="xix.iii-p38"></span><span id="xix.iii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p39"></span>**18.** *But now God hath placed.* Here we
have another argument, taken from the appointment of God. “It has
pleased God, that the body should consist of various members, and that
the members should be endowed with various offices and gifts. That
member, therefore, which will not rest satisfied with its own station,
will wage war with God after the manner of the giants.  <span
id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) Let us, therefore, be subject to the
arrangement which God has appointed, that we may not, to no purpose,
resist his will.”  <span id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md)

<span id="xix.iii-p42"></span><span id="xix.iii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p43"></span>**19.** *If all were one member* He means,
that God has not acted at random, or without good reason, in assigning
different gifts to the members of the body; but because it was necessary
that it should be so, for the preservation of the body; for if this
symmetry were taken away, there would be utter confusion and
derangement. Hence we ought to submit ourselves the more carefully to
the providence of God, which has so suitably arranged everything for our
common advantage. *One member* is taken here to mean a mass, that is all
of one shape, and not distinguished by any variety; for if God were to
fashion our body into a mass of this kind, it would be a useless heap.
 <span id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md)

<span id="xix.iii-p45"></span><span id="xix.iii-p45.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p46"></span>**20.** *Many members* — *one body* He
repeats this the oftener, because the stress of the whole question lies
here — that the unity of the body is of such a nature as cannot be
maintained but by a diversity of members; and that, while the members
differ from each other in offices and functions, it is in such a way as
to have a mutual connection with each other for the preservation of the
one body. Hence no body can retain its standing without a diversified
symmetry of the members, that we may know to consult public as well as
private advantage, by discharging, every one, the duty of his own
station.

<span id="xix.iii-p47"></span><span id="xix.iii-p47.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p48"></span>**21.** *And the eye cannot say to the
hand* Hitherto he has been showing, what is the office of the less
honorable members — to discharge their duty to the body, and not envy
the more distinguished members. *Now,* on the other hand, he enjoins it
upon the more honorable members, not to despise the inferior members,
which they cannot dispense with. The *eye* excels the *hand,* and yet
cannot despise it, or insult over it, as though it were useless; and he
draws an argument from utility, to show that it ought to be thus —
“Those members, that are less esteemed, are the more necessary: hence,
with a view to the safety of the body, they must not be despised.” He
makes use of the term *weaker* here, to mean *despised,* as in another
passage, when he says that he *glories in his infirmities,* (<span
id="xix.iii-p48.1"></span>[2Co
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)<span id="xix.iii-p48.1"></span>,.md)
he expresses, under this term, those things which rendered him
contemptible and abject.

<span id="xix.iii-p49"></span><span id="xix.iii-p49.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p50"></span>**23.** *Which are less honorable.* Here
we have a *second* argument — that the dishonor of one member turns out
to the common disgrace of the whole body, as appears from the care that
we take to cover the parts that are *less honorable. “Those* parts that
are *comely,”* says he, *“do* not require adventitious ornament; but the
parts that involve shame, or are less comely, are cared for by us with
greater concern. Why so? but because their shame would be the common
disgrace of the whole body.” *To invest with honor* is to put on a
covering for the sake of ornament, in order that those members may be
honorably concealed, which would involve shame if uncovered.  <span
id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md)

<span id="xix.iii-p52"></span><span id="xix.iii-p52.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p53"></span>**24.** *But God hath tempered the body
together* He again repeats, what he had stated once before, (<span
id="xix.iii-p53.1"></span>[1Co
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1012.htm#018.md)<span
id="xix.iii-p53.1"></span>,) but more explicitly, — that God has
appointed this symmetry, and that with a view to the advantage of the
whole body, because it cannot otherwise maintain its standing. “For
whence comes it, that all the members are of their own accord concerned
for the honor of a less comely member, and agree together to conceal its
shame? This inclination has been implanted in them by God, because
without this adjustment *a schism in the body* would quickly break out.
Hence it appears that the body is not merely shattered, and the order of
nature perverted, but the authority of God is openly set at naught,
whenever any one assumes more than belongs to him.”  <span
id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md)

<span id="xix.iii-p55"></span><span id="xix.iii-p55.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p56"></span>**26.** *Whether one member suffers* “Such
a measure of *fellow-feeling.” (*<span
id="xix.iii-p56.1"></span>συμπάθεια*,)*  <span
id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md) says he, “is to be seen in the human
body, that, if any inconvenience is felt by any member, all the others
grieve along with it, and, on the other hand, rejoice along with it, in
its prosperity. Hence there is no room there for envy or contempt.” To
be *honored,* here, is taken in a large sense, as meaning, to be *in
prosperity and happiness.* Nothing, however, is better fitted to promote
harmony than this community of interest, when every one feels that, by
the prosperity of others, he is proportionally enriched, and, by their
penury, impoverished.

<span id="xix.iii-p58"></span><span id="xix.iii-p58.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p59"></span>**27.** *But ye are the body of Christ*
Hence what has been said respecting the nature and condition of the
human body must be applied to us; for we are not a mere civil society,
but, being ingrafted into Christ’s body, are truly members one of
another. Whatever, therefore, any one of us has, let him know that it
has been given him for the edification of his brethren in common; and
let him, accordingly, bring it forward, and not keep it back — buried,
as it were, within himself, or make use of it as his own. Let not the
man, who is endowed with superior gifts, be puffed up with pride, and
despise others; but let him consider that there is nothing so diminutive
as to be of no use — as, in truth, even the least among the pious brings
forth fruit, according to his slender capacity, so that there is no
useless member in the Church. Let not those who are not endowed with so
much honor, envy those above them, or refuse to do their duty to them,
but let them maintain the station in which they have been placed. Let
there be mutual affection, mutual *fellow-feeling, (*<span
id="xix.iii-p59.1"></span>συμπάθεια*,)* mutual concern. Let us have a
regard to the common advantage, in order that we may not destroy the
Church by malignity, or envy, or pride, or any disagreement; but may, on
the contrary, every one of us, strive to the utmost of his power to
preserve it. Here is a large subject, and a magnificent one;  <span
id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md) but I content myself with having
pointed out the way in which the above similitude must be applied to the
Church.

<span id="xix.iii-p61"></span>*Members severally.* Chrysostom is of
opinion, that this clause is added, because the Corinthians were not the
universal Church; but this appears to me rather forced.  <span
id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) I have sometimes thought that it was
expressive of impropriety, as the Latins say <span
id="xix.iii-p62.1"></span>*Quodammodo,*  <span
id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763) *(in a manner..md)*  <span
id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) When, however, I view the whole matter
more narrowly, I am rather disposed to refer it to that division of
members of which he had made mention. They are then *members severally,*
according as *each* one has had his portion and definite work assigned
him. The context itself leads us to this meaning. In this way
*severally,* and *as a whole,* will be opposite terms.

<span id="xix.iv"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p1"></span><span id="xix.iv-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians

<span id="xix.iv-p11"></span> 

<span id="xix.iv-p12"></span><span id="xix.iv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p13"></span>He has in the beginning of the chapter
spoken of *gifts:* now he begins to treat of *offices,* and this order
it is proper that we should carefully observe. For the Lord did not
appoint ministers, without first endowing them with the requisite gifts,
and qualifying them for discharging their duty. Hence we must infer,
that those are fanatics, and actuated by an evil spirit, who intrude
themselves into the Church, while destitute of the necessary
qualifications, as many boast that they are under the influence of the
Spirit, and glory in a secret call from God, while in the meantime they
are unlearned and utterly ignorant. The natural order, on the other
hand, is this — that gifts come before the office to be discharged. As,
then, he has taught above, that everything that an individual has
received from God, should be made subservient to the common good, so now
he declares that offices are distributed in such a manner, that all may
together, by united efforts, edify the Church, and each individual
according to his measure.  <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md)

<span id="xix.iv-p15"></span>28. *First, Apostles* He does not enumerate
all the particular kinds, and there was no need of this, for he merely
intended to bring forward some examples. In the fourth Chapter of the
Epistle to the Ephesians, (<span id="xix.iv-p15.1"></span>[Eph
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#011)<span id="xix.iv-p15.1"></span>,.md)
there is a fuller enumeration of the offices, that are required for the
continued government of the Church. The reason of this I shall assign
there, if the Lord shall permit me to advance so far, though even there
he does not make mention of them all. As to the passage before us, we
must observe, that of the offices which Paul makes mention of, some are
perpetual, others temporary. Those that are perpetual, are such as are
necessary for the government of the Church; those that are temporary,
are such as were appointed at the beginning for the founding of the
Church, and the raising up of Christ’s kingdom; and these, in a short
time afterwards, ceased.

<span id="xix.iv-p16"></span>To the *first* class belongs the office of
*Teacher, to* the *second* the *office* of *Apostle;* for the Lord
created the Apostles, that they might spread the gospel throughout the
whole world, and he did not assign to each of them certain limits or
parishes, but would have them, wherever they went, to discharge the
office of ambassadors among all nations and languages. In this respect
there is a difference between them and *Pastors,* who are, in a manner,
tied to their particular churches. For the *Pastor* has not a commission
to preach the gospel over the whole world, but to take care of the
Church that has been committed to his charge. In his Epistle to the
Ephesians he places *Evangelists* after the *Apostles,* but here he
passes them over; for from the highest order, he passes immediately to
*Prophets*

<span id="xix.iv-p17"></span>By this term he means, (in my opinion,) not
those who were endowed with the gift of prophesying, but those who were
endowed with a peculiar gift, not merely for interpreting Scripture, but
also for applying it wisely for present use.  <span
id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) My reason for thinking so is this,
that he prefers prophecy to all other gifts, on the ground of its
yielding more edification — a commendation that would not be applicable
to the predicting of future events. Farther, when he describes the
office of *Prophet*, or at least treats of what he ought principally to
do, he says that he must devote himself to consolation, exhortation, and
doctrine. Now these are things that are distinct from prophesyings.
 <span id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) Let us, then, by *Prophets* in
this passage understand, first of all, eminent interpreters of
Scripture, and farther, persons who are endowed with no common wisdom
and dexterity in taking a right view of the present necessity of the
Church, that they may speak suitably to it, and in this way be, in a
manner, ambassadors to communicate the divine will.

<span id="xix.iv-p20"></span>Between them and *Teachers* this difference
may be pointed out, that the office of *Teacher* consists in taking care
that sound doctrines be maintained and propagated, in order that the
purity of religion may be kept up in the Church. At the same time, even
this term is taken in different senses, and here perhaps it is used
rather in the sense of Pastor, unless you prefer, it may be, to take it
in a general way for all that are endowed with the gift of teaching, as
in <span id="xix.iv-p20.1"></span>[Ac
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#001.md)<span id="xix.iv-p20.1"></span>,
where also Luke conjoins them with Prophets. My reason for not agreeing
with those who make the whole of the office of Prophet consist in the
interpretation of Scripture, is this — that Paul restricts the number of
those who ought to speak, to two or three; (<span
id="xix.iv-p20.2"></span>[1Co
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#029)<span id="xix.iv-p20.2"></span>,.md)
which would not accord with a bare interpretation of Scripture. In fine,
my opinion is this — that the Prophets here spoken of are those who make
known the will of God, by applying with dexterity and skill prophecies,
threatenings, promises, and the whole doctrine of Scripture, to the
present use of the Church. If any one is of a different opinion, I have
no objection to his being so, and will not raise any quarrel on that
account. For it is difficult to form a judgment as to gifts and offices
of which the Church has been so long deprived, excepting only that there
are some traces, or shadows of them still to be seen.

<span id="xix.iv-p21"></span>As to *powers* and *gift of healings*, I
have spoken when commenting on the 12th Chapter of the Romans. Only it
must be observed that here he makes mention, not so much of the gifts
themselves, as of the administration of them. As the Apostle is here
enumerating offices, I do not approve of what Chrysostom says, that
<span id="xix.iv-p21.2"></span>ἀντιλήψεις, that is, *helps* or *aids*,
consist in supporting the weak. What is it then? Undoubtedly, it is
either an office, as well as gift, that was exercised in ancient times,
but of which we have at this day no knowledge whatever; or it is
connected with the office of Deacon, or in other words, the care of the
poor; and this latter idea pleases me better.  <span
id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md) In <span id="xix.iv-p22.2"></span>[Ro
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#007.md)<span id="xix.iv-p22.2"></span>,
he makes mention of two kinds of deacons. Of these I have treated when
commenting upon that passage.

<span id="xix.iv-p23"></span>By *Governments* I understand Elders, who
had the charge of discipline. For the primitive Church had its Senate,
 <span id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) for the purpose of keeping the
people in propriety of deportment, as Paul shows elsewhere, when he
makes mention of two kinds of Presbyters.  <span
id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md) (<span id="xix.iv-p25.2"></span>[1Ti
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#017)<span id="xix.iv-p25.2"></span>..md)
Hence *government* consisted of those Presbyters who excelled others in
gravity, experience, and authority.

<span id="xix.iv-p26"></span>Under *different kinds of tongues* he
comprehends both the knowledge of languages, and the gift of
interpretation. They were, however, two distinct gifts; because in some
cases an individual spoke in different languages, and yet did not
understand the language of the Church with which he had to do. This
defect was supplied by interpreters.  <span
id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md)

<span id="xix.iv-p28"></span><span id="xix.iv-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p29"></span>**29.** *Are all Apostles*? It may indeed
have happened, that one individual was endowed with many gifts, and
sustained two of the offices which he has enumerated; nor was there in
this any inconsistency. Paul’s object, however, is to show in the first
place, that no one has such a fullness in everything as to have a
sufficiency within himself, and not require the aid of others; and
secondly, that offices as well as gifts are distributed in such a manner
that no one member constitutes the whole body, but each contributing his
portion to the common advantage, they then altogether constitute an
entire and perfect body. For Paul means here to take away every occasion
of proud boasting, base envyings, haughtiness, and contempt of the
brethren, malignity, ambition, and everything of that nature.

<span id="xix.iv-p30"></span><span id="xix.iv-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iv-p31"></span>**31.** *Seek after the more excellent
gifts.* It might also be rendered — *Value highly*; and it would not
suit in with the passage, though it makes little difference as to the
meaning; for Paul exhorts the Corinthians to esteem and desire those
gifts especially, which are most conducive to edification. For this
fault prevailed among them — that they aimed at show, rather than
usefulness. Hence prophecy was neglected, while languages sounded forth
among them, with great show, indeed, but with little profit. He does
not, however, address individuals, as though he wished that every one
should aspire at prophecy, or the office of teacher; but simply
recommends to them a desire to promote edification, that they may apply
themselves the more diligently to those things that are most conducive
to edification.

id="xix.ii-p17.2"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p18"></span> One of the most satisfactory views of this
subject is that of Dr. Henderson in his Lecture on “Divine Inspiration,”
(pp. 193,196,) who understands by <span id="xix.ii-p18.1"></span>σοφία,
(*wisdom*,) in this passage, “the sublime truths of the gospel, directly
revealed to the Apostles, of which the <span
id="xix.ii-p18.2"></span>λογος (*word*) was the supernatural ability
rightly to communicate them to others;” and by <span
id="xix.ii-p18.3"></span>λόγος γνώσεως (*word of knowledge*,) the
faculty of “infallibly explaining truths and doctrines which had been
previously divulged.” — *Ed*

<span id="fn_738"></span>[739](cc39018.htm#fr_738.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p20"></span> Chrysostom’s words are: <span
id="xix.ii-p20.1"></span>Πίστιν οὐ παύτην λέγει τὴν τῶν δογμάτων ἀλλὰ
τὴν τῶν σημείων. “By this faith he means not that of doctrines, but that
of miraeles.” — It was called by the schoolmen <span
id="xix.ii-p20.2"></span>*fides miractelorum* (*faith of miracles*.) —
*Ed*

<span id="fn_739"></span>[740](cc39018.htm#fr_739.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p20.3"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p21"></span> The plural is made use of, it is manifest,
to intimate the number and variety of the diseases that were healed —
the Apostles having been invested with power to *heal all manner of
sickness*, *and all manner of disease*. (<span
id="xix.ii-p21.1"></span>[Mt 10:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#001.md)<span
id="xix.ii-p21.1"></span>.) — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[741](cc39018.htm#fr_740.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p22.3"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p23"></span> There does not appear to be sufficient
ground for understanding the *miracles* here referred to as necessarily
*deeds of terror*, while the connection in which the expression occurs
seems to intimate, that the *miracles* here meant were more than
ordinarily stupendous manifestations of Divine power, such as would
powerfully constrain the beholder to exclaim, *This is the finger of
God*! Thus, “the resuscitation of the dead, the innocuous handlng of
serpents, or drinking of empoisoned liquor, the dispossession of demons,
and the infliction of blindness,” as in the case of Elymas, the
sorcerer, and of death itself, as in the case of Ananias and Sapphira,.
were *mighty deeds* — to which “no mere created power could possibly
pretend, under any circumstances, or by the application of any means
whatever.” See *Henderson on Inspiration*, pp. 203-206. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[742](cc39018.htm#fr_741.md) <span

and fair appearance which persons sometimes have.”

<span id="fn_743"></span>[744](cc39018.htm#fr_743.md) <span

<span id="xix.ii-p29"></span> “<span id="xix.ii-p29.1"></span>Et en tel

such a case, those who had the gift of interpreting languages.”

<span id="fn_744"></span>[745](cc39018.htm#fr_744.md) <span
id="xix.ii-p29.2"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p30"></span> The following classification of the,
*gifts*, (<span id="xix.ii-p30.1"></span>χαρίσματα) here enumerated by
the Apostle, is suggested by Dr. Henderson, as tending to show the
“beautiful symmetry” of the passage: —

<span id="xix.ii-p31"></span>I. ̔Ω μὲν — λόγος σοφίας  —  (I. *To one*,
*the word of wisdom*)  
2. ἄλλῳ δὲ λογος γνώσες  —  (2. *to another*, *the word of
knowledge*.)  
II. ̔ΕΤΕΡΩ δὲ πίστις —  (II. *To another*, *faith*,)  
1. ἄλλῳ δὲ χαρίσματα ἰαμάτων —  (1. *to another*, *gifts of healing*,)  
2. ἄλλῳ δὲ ἐνεργήματα δυμάμεων  —  (2. *to another*, *working of
miracles*,)  
3. ἄλλῳ δὲ προφητεια  —  (3. *to another*, *prophecy*,)  
4. ἄλλῳ δὲ διαχρίσεις πνευμάτων  —  (4. *to another*, *discerning of
spirits*.)  
III. ̔ΕΤΕΡΩ δὲ γένη γλωσσῶν —  (III. *To another*, *divers kinds of
tongues*,)  
2. ἄλλῳ δὲ ἑρμηνεία γλωσσῶν  —  (2. *to another*, *interpretation of
tongues*.)

<span id="xix.ii-p32"></span>Thus the *first* class includes “the word
of wisdom,” and “the word of knowledge. Under the head of *faith*, that
is, the faith of miracles, four kinds of gifts are enumerated — “gifts
of healing,” — “working of miracles,” — “prophecy,” and “discerning of
spirits;” while the *third* class includes “divers kinds of tongues,”
and “the interpretation of tongues.” See *Henderson on Inspiration*. —
*Ed*.

<span id="xix.ii-p38"></span> Menenius Agrippa, a Roman consul, on
occasion of a rebellion breaking out among the common people against the
nobles and senators, whom they represented as useless and cumbersome to
the state, was successful in quelling the insurrection, by a happy use
of the apologue referred to, founded on the intimate connection and
mutual dependence of the different parts of the body. The reader will
find this interesting incident related by *Livy*, Book 2. chapter 32. —

<span id="xix.ii-p43"></span> Calvin, along with some other
interpreters, understands the term, <span
id="xix.ii-p43.1"></span>πλήρωμα, (*fullness*,) in the passage referred
to, in an *active* sense. *Theophylact* observes that the Church is the
<span id="xix.ii-p43.2"></span>Πλήρωμα — *completion* of Christ, as the
body and limbs are of the head. The term may, however, be taken in a
*passive* sense, as meaning *a thing to be* *filled or completed*. —

reasonably supposed to be meant by *helps*, as *deacons*;” who “were
instituted for the express purpose of *helping* the Apostles, for the
purpose of relieving them from the care of the poor, that they might
devote themselves exclusively to the ministry of the word.” He observes
also, (p.389,) that “it does not follow, because *some* of the offices
and ministrations enumerated in this place were miraculous and
extraordinary, that they were *all* of that description.” — *Ed*
