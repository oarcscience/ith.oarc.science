<span id="v.vii-p2"></span><span id="v.vii-p2.1"></span>[Deuteronomy
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#018.md)<span id="v.vii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="v.vii-p3"></span>**18.** When thou shalt hearken to the voice
of the Lord thy God, to keep all his commandments which I command thee
this day, to do *that which is* right in the eyes of the Lord thy God.

<span id="v.vii-p4"></span>**18.** Quia audies vocem Jehovae Dei tui, ut
custodias omnia praecepta ejus, quae ego praecipio tibi hodie, ut facias
quod rectum est in oculis Jehovae Dei tui.

<span id="v.vii-p5"></span><span id="v.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.vii-p6"></span>**18.** *When thou shalt hearken.* Although
this sentence depends on something else, (as may be seen by referring to
it,) yet is it general, and extends to the commendation of the whole
Law. Moses teaches first, that the rule of a holy life must be sought
from the mouth of God; and then adds that He must be obeyed not
partially, but universally. He confirms also what I have said respecting
obedience, for men only please God when they listen to His voice.
Moreover, the expression is worth our notice, wherein Moses only assumes
for himself the character of a minister, and claims power for God alone;
for he says that he commands, but expressly explains that the
commandments which he sets before them are God’s.

<span id="v.vii-p7"></span>DEUTERONOMY 4

<span id="v.vii-p8"></span><span id="v.vii-p8.1"></span>[Deuteronomy
4:5-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#005.md)<span id="v.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.vii-p9"></span>**5.** Behold, I have taught you statutes and
judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do so in
the land whither ye go to possess it.

<span id="v.vii-p10"></span>**5.** Videte, docui vos statuta et judicia,
sicut praecepit mihi Jehova Deus mens, ut sic faciatis in medio terrae,
ad quam vos ingredimini ut possideatis eam.

<span id="v.vii-p11"></span>**6.** Keep therefore, and do *them:* for
this *is* your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the
nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, surely this great
nation *is* a wise and understanding people.

<span id="v.vii-p12"></span>**6.** Custodietis itaque, et facietis: quia
haec est sapientia vestra et intelligentia vestra coram populis: qui dum
audierint omnia statuta haec, dicent, Certe populus hic sapiens et
intelligens est gens haec magna.

<span id="v.vii-p13"></span>**7.** For what nation *is there so* great,
who *hath* God *so* nigh unto them, as the Lord our God *is* in all
*things that* we call upon him *for?*

<span id="v.vii-p14"></span>**7.** Quae enim gens tam magna est cui sic
appropinquent dii, sicut Jehova Deus noster in quibuscunque invocamus
eum?

<span id="v.vii-p15"></span>**8.** And what nation *is there so* great,
that hath statutes and judgments *so* righteous as all this law, which I
set before you this day?

<span id="v.vii-p16"></span>**8.** Et quae gens est tam magna cui sint
statuta et judicia justa, sicut est universa haec lex, quam ego proporno
hodie coram oculis vestris?

<span id="v.vii-p17"></span>**9.** Only take heed to thyself, and keep
thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have
seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but
teach them thy sons, and thy sons’ sons:

<span id="v.vii-p18"></span>**9.** Veruntamen cave tibi, et custodi
animam tuam sollicite, ne obliviscaris rerum quas viderunt oculi tui,
neve recedant e corde tuo cunctis diebus vitro tuae, et doceas ea filios
tuos et filios filiorum tuorum.

<span id="v.vii-p19"></span>**10.** *Specially* the day that thou
stoodest before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord said unto me,
Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that
they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the
earth, and *that* they may teach their children.

<span id="v.vii-p20"></span>**10.** Die quo stetisti coram Jehova Deo
tuo in Horeb, quum diceret Jehova mihi, Congrega mihi populum, ut
recenseam illis verba mea, quae discent, ut timeant me omnibus diebus
quibus vixerint super terram, et filios suos doceant.

<span id="v.vii-p21"></span>**11.** And ye came near, and stood under
the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of
heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.

<span id="v.vii-p22"></span>**11.** Itaque accessistis, et stetistis sub
monte: (mons autem ille ardebat igni usque ad medium coeli, tenebrae,
nubes, et caligo.)

<span id="v.vii-p23"></span>**12.** And the Lord spake unto you out of
the midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no
similitude; only *ye heard* a voice.

<span id="v.vii-p24"></span>**12.** Et loquutus est Jehova ad vose medio
ignis: vocem verborum vos audiebatis, at imaginem ullam non videbatis
praeter vocem.

<span id="v.vii-p25"></span>**13.** And he declared unto you his
covenant, which he commanded you to perform, *even* ten commandments;
and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.

<span id="v.vii-p26"></span>**13.** Et renuntiavit vobis pactum suum
quod praecepit vobis, ut faceretis, decem verba, et scripsit illa in
duabus tabulis lapideis.

<span id="v.vii-p27"></span>**14.** And the Lord commanded me at that
time to teach you statutes and judgments, that ye might do them in the
land whither ye go over to possess it.

<span id="v.vii-p28"></span>**14.** Mihi quoque praecepit Jehova eodem
tempore ut docerem vos statuta et indicia, ut faceretis ea in terra ad
quam transitis ut possideatis eam.

<span id="v.vii-p29"></span><span id="v.vii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="v.vii-p30"></span>**6.** *Keep therefore, and do them.* <span
id="v.vii-p30.1"></span>In order that they may set themselves more
cheerfully about the keeping of the Law, and may proceed more steadily
in this endeavor, he reminds them that nothing is better or more
desirable for themselves. For God is not duly honored, except with ready
minds and volutary obedience, to which we are rather attracted by
pleasure than forced by rigor and violence. Now, since all desire to
excel, he says, that this is the chief excellence of Israel, that they
have God for their Lawgiver and Master. If any object that what he says
may be refuted by two arguments, namely, because the Law of God was
unknown to heathen nations; and because the form of God’s worship
prescribed in it, and the whole Jewish religion, was not only despised
but hated by them; I reply, that other nations are not here absolutely
stated to be the judges or arbitrators, but that the words must be thus
understood, viz., that there will be no nation, if it should come to a
right understanding, which will dare to compare itself, much less to
prefer itself to you; for by the very comparison it will acknowledge to
what a height of dignity God has raised you. Wherefore, although the
doctrine of the Law should remain neglected, nay, detested, by almost
all the world, still Moses with truth declares, that since God has
deigned to deliver to the Jews a rule of life, a stage had been erected
before other nations, whereon the nobility of that one people would be
conspicuous. For it was unreasonable that the glory of God should be
tarnished or extinguished by the ignorance of the blind. But we gather
from this passage that we then are truly wise, when we depend on God’s
words, and submit our feeling to His revelations. Where I have rendered
the words, “Surely *(certo)* <span id="v.vii-p30.2"></span>this people,”
the Hebrew particle, <span id="v.vii-p30.3"></span>רק<span
id="v.vii-p30.4"></span>,  <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md)
*rak,* <span id="v.vii-p31.1"></span>is used, which is often applied in
an exclusive sense, so that it would appropriately bear this meaning:
*“Only* <span id="v.vii-p31.2"></span>this people,” etc. Unquestionably,
the eminent condition of the people, on account of their gracious
privileges, is referred to.

<span id="v.vii-p32"></span><span id="v.vii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="v.vii-p33"></span>**7.** *For what nation is there so great?*
Moses now repeats in his own name what he had stated in the person of
others, as if to shew by additional reasons, that not without cause
would the Jews be celebrated in the whole world, because it would
actually appear that none were equal to them. He mentions two points,
first, because God would be ready to afford them help, as often as they
call upon Him; secondly, because He had instructed them in perfect
righteousness, beyond which nothing could be desired; for, when he says
that God is “nigh unto them,” I refer it to the presence of His power,
which had been abundantly manifested by many miracles. Justly does he
deny that the Gentiles had ever experienced such aid from their gods,
since their prayers and cries were offered to deaf and dead idols.

<span id="v.vii-p34"></span><span id="v.vii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="v.vii-p35"></span>**9.** *Only take heed to thyself* <span
id="v.vii-p35.1"></span>The same particle, <span
id="v.vii-p35.2"></span>רק<span id="v.vii-p35.3"></span>, *rak,* <span
id="v.vii-p35.4"></span>of which I have just spoken, is used here, and
its meaning in this place is, as if Moses had said, that this *only*
<span id="v.vii-p35.5"></span>remained; unless it is preferred to
translate it *nevertheless.* <span id="v.vii-p35.6"></span>What follows
means literally “Guard *(custodi)* <span
id="v.vii-p35.7"></span>thyself, and guard thy soul;” <span
id="v.vii-p35.8"></span>wherein Moses advances by degrees, reminding
them that they needed no common heedfulness, but that they must beware
with extreme vigilance and diligence lest they should fail through the
want of them; for the slothfulness of the flesh must be spurred on by
such instigations as these, and at the same time our weakness must be
fortified, and we must take measures against our unsteadfastness; for
nothing is more easy than that all our zeal should suddenly be
forgotten, or should gradually grow cold. God had established the
certainty of His law, as far as was necessary, for the grateful and
attentive, yet not without reason does He desire the people to remember
how great is the carelessness of men. Nor does he command those only to
remember who were eye-witnesses, but also to hand down (what they had
seen) to their sons and grandsons, that the memory of such remarkable
things might be preserved.

<span id="v.vii-p36"></span><span id="v.vii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="v.vii-p37"></span>**10.** *The day*  <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) *that thou stoodest.* The word *day*
might be taken in the accusative, as if in apposition. It is, at any
rate, clear that he explains more fully what he had briefly alluded to
before, for he summons the people as eye-witnesses, lest, perchance,
they should object that they were not sure from whence Moses had derived
what he professes to be enjoined him by God. For they were all well
aware that he had undertaken nothing without the express command of God.
Finally, he proves, from the end and object itself of the doctrine, that
God was its author, since it tended to nothing else but that God should
be purely served, and that His people might be obedient, than which
nothing can be imagined more just and right.

<span id="v.vii-p39"></span><span id="v.vii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="v.vii-p40"></span>**11** *And ye came near, and stood.* This
explanatory narrative is intended to prove the same thing, viz., that
Moses was only the ambassador and minister of God, because the mountain
burned in the sight of all the people, that God might be manifested,
speaking from the midst of the fire. His statement that they only heard
the voice, but saw no similitude, may be understood as a kind of
admission, *(concessionis.)* Thus the two clauses would be read
adversatively, “Although no similitude appeared, yet a voice penetrated
even to your ears.” But I conceive that this was expressly stated more
clearly to shew that it was the voice of God, and not proceeding from a
human being; for no man could have so concealed himself by artifice as
to prevent himself from being seen to speak, whereas they beheld the
voice come out of the fire without any external instrumentality.
