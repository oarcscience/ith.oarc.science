come in unto the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee *for* an
inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein,

<span id="vi.vii.i-p4"></span>**1.** Quum autem ingressus fueris terram
quam Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi in haereditatem, et possederis eam, et
habitaveris in ca:

<span id="vi.vii.i-p5"></span>**2.** That thou shalt take of the first
of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that
the Lord thy God giveth thee, and shalt put *it* in a basket, and shalt
go unto the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his name
there.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p6"></span>**2.** Tunc accipies de primitiis omnium
fructuum terrae, quas afteres e terra tua quam Jehova Deus tuus dat
tibi, et pones in canistro: ibis. que ad locum quem elegerit Jehova Deus
tuus, ut illic habitare faciat nomen suum.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p7"></span>**3.** And thou shalt go unto the priest
that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto
the Lord thy God, that I am come unto the country which the Lord sware
unto our fathers for to give us.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p8"></span>**3.** Et venies ad sacerdotem qui erit in

ingressus sum terram quam juravit Jehova patribus nostris se daturum
nobis.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p9"></span>**4.** And the priest shall take the
basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the Lord
thy God.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p10"></span>**4.** Capietque sacerdos canistrum e

<span id="vi.vii.i-p11"></span>**5.** And thou shalt speak and say
before the Lord thy God, A Syrian ready to perish *was* my father; and
he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became
there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:

<span id="vi.vii.i-p12"></span>**5.** Et loqueris, ac dices coram Jehova
Deo tuo, Syrus *ille* inopia laborans pater meus descendit in Aegyptum,
et peregrinatus est illic cum viris paucis, et evasit illic ingentem
magnam, robustam et multam.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p13"></span>**6.** And the Egyptians evil entreated
us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage:

<span id="vi.vii.i-p14"></span>**6.** Molestia autem nos affecerunt
Aegyptii, et affiixerunt nos, imposueruntque nobis servitutem duram.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p15"></span>**7.** And when we cried unto the Lord
God of our fathers, the Lord heard our voice, and looked on our
affliction, and on our labor, and our oppression:

<span id="vi.vii.i-p16"></span>**7.** Clamavimus itaque ad Jehovam Deum
patrum nostrorum, et exaudivit Jehova vocem nostram, et aspexit
afflietionem nostram, et laborem nostrum, et oppressionem nostram.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p17"></span>**8.** And the Lord brought us forth out
of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with
great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders:

<span id="vi.vii.i-p18"></span>**8.** Et eduxit nos ex Aegypto cum manu
forti, ac brachio extento, et terrore magno, et signis, atque portentis.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p19"></span>**9.** And he hath brought us into this
place, and hath given us this land, *even* a land that floweth with milk
and honey.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p20"></span>**9.** Et introduxit nos ad locum istum,
deditque nobis terram istam, terram fiuentem lacte et melle.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p21"></span>**10.** And now, behold, I have brought
the first-fruits of the land which thou, O Lord, hast given me. And thou
shalt set it before the Lord thy God, and worship before the Lord thy
God.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p22"></span>**10.** Nunc igitur, ecce, attuli
primitias fructus terrae quam dedisti mihi, O Jehova; et relinques illud
coram Jehova Deo tuo, atque adorabis coram Jehova Deo tuo.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p23"></span>**11.** And thou shalt rejoice in every
good *thing* which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine
house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that *is* among you.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p24"></span>**11.** Et laetaberis in omni bono quod

qui est in medio tui.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p33"></span><span id="vi.vii.i-p33.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.i-p34"></span>**1.** *And it shall be when thou art
come.* The Israelites are commanded to offer their first-fruits, for the
same reason that they were to pay the tribute for every soul; viz., that
they might confess that they themselves, and all that they had, belonged
to God. This was the only distinction, that the tribute was a symbol of
their emancipation, that they might acknowledge themselves to be free,
as having been redeemed by the special mercy of God; but by the
firstfruits they testified that the land was tributary to God, and that
they were masters of it by no other title than as tenants at will, so
that the direct sovereignty and property of it remained with God alone.
This, then, was the object of the first-fruits, that they might renew
every year the recollection of their adoption; because the land of
Canaan was given to them as their peculiar inheritance, in which they
were to worship God in piety and holiness, and at the same time reflect
that they were not fed promiscuously, like the Gentiles, by God, but
like children; whence also their food was sacred. But we shall have to
speak again elsewhere of the first-fruits, in as much as they were a
part of the oblations; yet it was necessary to insert here their main
object, that we might know that they were appointed to be offered by the
people, in pious acknowledgment that their food was received from God,
and to shew that, being separated from other nations, they were
dependent upon the God of Israel alone.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p35"></span><span id="vi.vii.i-p35.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.i-p36"></span>**2.** *That thou shalt take of the
first.* We know that in the first-fruits the whole produce of the year
was consecrated to God. The people,  <span
id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337.md) therefore, bore in them a testimony of
their piety to Him, whom they daily experienced to be their preserver,
and the giver of their food. This typical rite has now, indeed, ceased,
but Paul tells us that the true observation of it still remains, where
he exhorts us, whether we eat or drink, to do all to the glory of God.
(<span id="vi.vii.i-p37.1"></span>[1Co
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#031.md)<span
id="vi.vii.i-p37.1"></span>.) As to the place where the first-fruits
were to be offered, and why God is said to have placed His name there,
we shall hereafter consider, when we come to the sacrifices; I now only
briefly touch upon what concerns the present subject.

<span id="vi.vii.i-p38"></span>*I profess this day.* In these words the
Israelites confess that they had not gained dominion of the land either
by their own strength or good fortune, but by the free gift of God, and
that according to His promise. There are, therefore, two clauses in this
sentence; *first,* that God had gratuitously promised to grant that land
to Abraham as the inheritance of his descendants; and, *secondly,* that
He had performed His promise, not only when He had brought the children
of Abraham into possession, but by adding’ to His grace by their
peaceful enjoyment of it. He pursues the same point more fully
immediately afterwards, where the Israelites are commanded to declare
how wretched was the condition of their fathers, before the Lord
embraced them with His favor, and vouchsafed unto them His mercy. The
original word in verse 5, meaning to *answer,* I translate simply,
according to the Hebrew idiom, to *speak* or *say;* unless to *testify*
be thought better, which would be very suitable; for the solemn
profession is here described, whereby they bound themselves every year
to God. They do not count their origin from Abraham, but from Jacob, in
whose person God’s grace shone forth more brightly; for being compelled
to fly from the land of Canaan, he had spent a good part of his life in
Syria, (for he did not return home, till he was old,) and then, being
again driven into Egypt by the famine, he had at length died there. The
land had not, therefore, fallen to them by hereditary right, nor by
their own efforts; their father Jacob not having been permitted even to
sojourn there. They call him a Syrian, because when he had married
Laban’s daughters, and had begotten children, and was stricken in years
before he had returned home, he might seem to have renounced the land of
Canaan. Since then he had been content for many years with the dwelling
which he chose for himself in Syria, his descendants justly confessed
that he was a pilgrim and stranger, because of his long exile; and for
the same reason that they also might be counted foreigners. They add
that their father Jacob again abandoned the land of Canaan when he was
forced by the famine to go down into Egypt; and whilst they recount that
he sojourned there with a few, and afterwards grew into a mighty nation,
they thus acknowledge that they were Egyptians, since they had sprung
from thence, where was the beginning of their name and race. In the rest
of the passage they further confirm the fact that they were led into the
land of Canaan by the hand of God; because when they were oppressed by
tyranny, they cried unto Him, and were heard. They are commanded also to
celebrate the signs and wonders whereby their redemption was more
clearly manifested, in order that they should unhesitatingly give thanks
to God, and contrast His pure worship with all the imaginations of the
heathen: otherwise, this would have been but a cold exercise of piety.
What follows in the last verse, “And thou shalt rejoice,” etc., seems
indeed to have been a promise, as if God, by setting before them the
assurance of His blessing, added a stimulus to arouse the people to more
cheerful affection; but the sense would appear more clear and natural if
the *copula* were changed into the temporal adverb *then;* for this is
the main thing in the use of our meat and drink, with a glad and joyful
conscience to accept it as a testimony of God’s paternal favor. Nothing
is more wretched than doubt; and therefore Paul especially requires of
us this confidence, bidding us eat not without faith. (<span
id="vi.vii.i-p38.1"></span>[Ro
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.vii.i-p38.1"></span>.) In order, then, to render the Israelites
more prompt in their duty, Moses reminds them that they would only be
able to rejoice freely in the use of God’s gifts, if they should have
expressed their gratitude as He commanded.

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p3"></span>**17.** And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p4"></span>**17.** Loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen,
dicendo,

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p5"></span>**18.** Speak unto the children of
Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring
you;

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p6"></span>**18.** Alloquere filios Israel, et dicas
els: Quum ingressi fueritis terram ad quam ego introduco Vos.

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p7"></span>**19.** Then it shall be, that, when ye
eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave-offering unto
the Lord.

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p8"></span>**19.** Tum fiet, quum incipietis
comedere de pane terrae, offeretis in oblationem Jehovae.

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p9"></span>**20.** Ye shall offer up a cake of the
first of your dough *for* an heave-offering: as ye *do* the
heave-offering of the thrashing-floor, so shall ye heave it.

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p10"></span>**20.** De primitiis conspersionum
vestrarum: placentam offeretis in oblationem: stout oblationem areae,
sic offeretis illam.

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p11"></span>**21.** Of the first of your dough ye
shall give unto the Lord an heave-offering in your generations.

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p12"></span>**21.** De primitiis conspersionum
vestrarum dabitis Jehovae, oblationem per generationes vestras.

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p13"></span><span id="vi.vii.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.ii-p14"></span>**20.** *Ye shall offer up a cake.* Here
another kind of first-fruits is required, to offer up sacred cakes of
the first of their dough. First-fruits were offered of their fruits and
ears of corn; but the representation was more lively in the bread
itself; and, consequently, God would have them present tokens of their
gratitude, not only from the barn, but from the mill, and the oven, so
that whilst they eat their bread also, they might have Him before their
eyes.

<span id="vi.vii.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.iii-p1"></span><span
id="vi.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
22](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.vii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.iii-p2"></span><span
id="vi.vii.iii-p2.1"></span>[Exodus
22:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.vii.iii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.iii-p3"></span>**29.** Thou shalt not delay *to offer*
the first of thy ripe-fruits, and of thy liquors.

<span id="vi.vii.iii-p4"></span>**29.** Plenitudinem tuam et lachrymam
tuam non differes.

<span id="vi.vii.iii-p5"></span><span id="vi.vii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.vii.iii-p6"></span>**29.** *Thou shalt not delay.* We may
gather from this passage that the first-fruits were offered, to the end
that the Israelites should devote themselves and their possessions to
God; for Moses enjoins these two things in conjunction, that they should
not delay to consecrate to God of the abundance of their fresh fruits,
and their first-born. But we know that, in offering the first-born, the
recollection of their deliverance was revived, by the acknowledgment of
the preservation of their race, and of their cattle. And there was,
moreover, added to the grace of their redemption, the continual supply
of food to them from day to day. I do not assent to their opinion who
restrict the word *fullness*  <span id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338.md) to
wine, because it flows more abundantly from the press, and take the word
*tear*  <span id="fr_339"></span>[340](#fn_339.md) to mean oil, because it
runs less freely; nor do I approve of their notion who apply *fullness*
only to dry fruits. It seems to me more proper to take *fullness* as the
generic term, whilst *tear* is taken to denote liquids, as if Moses
commanded them not only to offer grapes, and olive-berries, but the very
drops which were expressed from the fruit. The other passages confirm
this command, that they should not defraud God of the first-fruits, and
so bury the remembrance of their redemption, and profane themselves in
their very eating and drinking, but rather by this portion of the fruits
sanctify the food of the whole year. Nor is it causelessly that Moses so
often inculcates a point by no means obscure, since all these
admonitions were despised and neglected by the Jews, as soon as they had
returned from the Babylonish captivity, as Malachi complains in his
third chapter.
