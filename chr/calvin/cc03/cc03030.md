the statutes, and unto the judgments, which I teach you, for to do
*them,* that ye may live, and go in and possess the land which the Lord
God of your fathers giveth you.

<span id="v.v-p4"></span>**1.** Et nunc Israel audi statuta et judicia,
quae ego doceo vos, ut faciatis: ut vivatis, atque ingrediamini, et
possideatis terram quam Jehova Deus patrum vestrorum dat vobis.

<span id="v.v-p5"></span>**2.** Ye shall not add unto the word which I
command you, neither shall ye diminish *ought* from it, that ye may keep
the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.

<span id="v.v-p6"></span>**2.** Non addetis ad verbum quod ego praecipio
vobis, neque minuetis ex eo, ut custodiatis praecepta Jehovae Dei
vestri, quae ego praecipio vobis.

<span id="v.v-p8"></span>**1.** *Now, therefore, hearken, O Israel.* He
requires the people to be teachable, in order that they may learn to
serve God; for the beginning of a good and upright life is to know what
is pleasing to God. From hence, then, does Moses commence commanding
them to be attentive in seeking direction from the Law; and then
admonishing them to prove by their whole life that they have duly
profited in the Law. The promise which is here inserted, only invites
them to unreserved obedience through hope of the inheritance. The main
point is, that they should neither add to nor diminish from the pure
doctrine of the Law; and this cannot be the case, unless men first
renounce their own private feelings, and then shut their ears against
all the imaginations of others. For none are to be accounted (true)
disciples of the Law, but those who obtain their wisdom from it alone.
It is, then, as if God commanded them to be content with His precepts;
because in no other way would they keep His law, except by giving
themselves wholly to its teaching. Hence it follows, that they only obey
God who depend on His authority alone; and that they only pay the Law
its rightful honor, who receive nothing which is opposed to its natural
meaning. The passage is a remarkable one, openly condemning whatsoever
man’s ingenuity may invent for the service of God.
