10:14-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#014.md)<span id="v.x-p2.1"></span>

<span id="v.x-p3"></span>**14.** Behold, the heaven, and the heaven of
heavens, *is* the Lord’s thy God, the earth *also,* with all that
therein *is.*

<span id="v.x-p4"></span>**14.** Ecce, Jehovae Dei tui sunt coeli, et
coeli coelorum, terra et omnia quae in ea sunt.

<span id="v.x-p5"></span>**15.** Only the Lord had a delight in thy
fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, *even* you
above all people, as *it is* this day.

<span id="v.x-p6"></span>**15.** Tantummodo in patribus tuis
beneplacitum est Jehovae, ut diligeret eos: et elegit semen eorum post
eos, *nempe* vos, ex omnibus populis, sicut hodie.

<span id="v.x-p7"></span>**16.** Circumcise therefore the foreskin of
your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.

<span id="v.x-p8"></span>**16.** Circumcidite igitur praeputium cordis
vestri, et cervicem vestram ne induretis ultra.

<span id="v.x-p9"></span>**17.** For the Lord your God *is* God of gods,
and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which
regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.

<span id="v.x-p10"></span>**17.** Jehova enim Deus vester est, Deus
deorum, et Dominus dominorum, Deus magnus, potens et terribilis.-

<span id="v.x-p11"></span><span id="v.x-p11.1"></span>

<span id="v.x-p12"></span>**14.** *Behold the heaven.* <span
id="v.x-p12.1"></span>He again enforces upon them the grace, on account
of which we have seen that the people were under obligation to God;
because this was the most effectual observation for moving them to
submit themselves to their deliverer, to whom they were reminded that
they owed altogether themselves and all that they had. First, then, he
admonishes them that they differed from others, not by their personal
dignity, nor the excellency of their race, but because it pleased God to
prefer them, when He ruled equally over all. Literally it is, “Jehovah
coveted to love your fathers,” by which expression, as may be gathered
from many passages, the feeling of inclination to love them is
undoubtedly marked. Jerome, therefore, has not aptly used the word
“adhere.”  <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) <span
id="v.x-p13.1"></span>Now, this desire, whereby God was freely and
liberally induced, Moses opposes to all other causes, lest Israel should
arrogate anything to themselves or their fathers. We must also remark
the comparison <span id="v.x-p13.2"></span>between the less and the
greater; for this was inestimable condescension, that he should in a
manner pass by the heaven and earth with all their beauty and abundance,
and set His heart upon a few obscure men. To this the limitation refers,
that of all people He chose the seed of Abraham alone; for the word
<span id="v.x-p13.3"></span>רק<span id="v.x-p13.4"></span>, *rak,* <span
id="v.x-p13.5"></span>is here used *exclusively,* <span
id="v.x-p13.6"></span>therefore, I have translated it “tantummodo,”
only; unless it should be thought better to render it “But,” or “And
yet.” The meaning, however, is clear, that God, having disregarded all
the nations of the earth, had gratuitously adopted Abraham and his race.
For he says that not only were their fathers loved, but all their
descendants in their persons; since otherwise the exhortation which
follows would not be suitable.

<span id="v.x-p14"></span><span id="v.x-p14.1"></span>

<span id="v.x-p15"></span>**16.** *Circumcise, therefore.* From this
inference it appears wherefore mention was made of this adoption,. viz.,
that the *Jews* should more earnestly and solemnly serve God, whom they
had known from experience to be so gracious. He requires, then, a
reciprocal love; for nothing could be more base than not to testify
their gratitude by a pious and righteous life. But, because men are by
no means inclined or disposed to obey God, Moses exhorts them to
self-renunciation, and to subdue and correct their carnal affections;
for to circumcise the heart is equivalent to cleansing it from wicked
lusts. Meanwhile, he reproves their former perverseness, when he desires
them to be no more stiff-necked; as much as to say, that now at last
they should put off that depravity of mind, wherein they had too long
hardened themselves. We now perceive the design of Moses. He would have
his fellow-Israelites submissive and obedient to God, who, by His great
goodness, had furnished them with the motive. But, because hitherto they
had repaid His kindnesses with ingratitude, at the same time, he enjoins
them to amend their conduct. In the first clause, he alludes to the rite
appointed by the Law; for circumcision is, as it were, the solemn
consecration, whereby the children of Abraham were initiated unto the
worship of God and true piety, and at the same time were separated from
heathen nations, to be His holy and peculiar people; and they were to be
admitted to this elementary rite in their infancy, that by its visible
sign they might learn that the defilements of the flesh and the world
were to be renounced. There were also other objects in circumcision, but
here reference is only made to newness of life, or repentance
*(resipiscentia).* Wherefore, the conclusion is, that since God had
chosen them as His people, and by an external sign had devoted them to
the cultivation of holiness, they ought sincerely and really to prove
that they differed from heathen nations, and that they were circumcised
in spirit, no less than in the flesh. For Paul declares, that they alone
are truly Jews who are circumcised “inwardly,” as he says, and not those
who only have to boast of “the letter” of circumcision. (<span
id="v.x-p15.1"></span>[Rom. 2:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#028.md),
[29](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#029)<span id="v.x-p15.1"></span>..md)
Wherefore, the Prophets frequently taunt the transgressors of the Law by
calling them uncircumcised, although they bore the visible sign in their
flesh. In fine, when he desires to exhort them to sanctify themselves to
God, he reasons from the nature and use of the sign, whereby they
professed themselves to be His chosen people. In the second clause,
there is an elegant metaphor, of frequent occurrence, taken from oxen;
for, since the oxen which quietly offer their necks to the yoke are
easily subdued to obedience, those are said to be “stiff-necked” *(durae
cervicis)* which are fierce and obstinate in their nature.

<span id="v.x-p16"></span><span id="v.x-p16.1"></span>

<span id="v.x-p17"></span>**17.** *For the Lord your God.* Lest they
should despise this teaching, he reminds them of God’s awful power; for
the cause of contempt and negligence is, that the majesty of God does
not always obtain its due reverence. Wherefore he inspires them with
fear, to deter them from self-indulgence and indifference.
