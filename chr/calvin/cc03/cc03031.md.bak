the Lord your God hath commanded you, that ye may live, and *that it may
be* well with you, and *that* ye may prolong *your* days in the land
which ye shall possess.

Again, in this verse also, he does not merely exhort the people to
embrace the Law, but at the same time enjoins them to be content with
its unadulterated teaching; and, in fact, to receive as just and right
whatever God has commanded, is only to be half obedient, unless men also
put this restraint upon themselves, not to import anything else, (in
addition to His Law.) So, also, in another passage, which I have
subjoined, God no less severely forbids additions to it than taking away
from it; and this is a declaration deserving our especial observation,
because, in its preposterous wilfulness, the whole world almost is
carried away into false religions; which, nevertheless, God has briefly
condemned in a single word, when He commands His people so to acquiesce
in His appointed Law that they may not seek to be more righteous than
they are taught to be. There is a similar passage at the end of <span
id="v.vi-p8.1"></span>[De 12:32](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#032.md)<span
id="v.vi-p8.1"></span>,) but, because it is connected with a particular
circumstance, and depends on the preceding passage, it will be more
conveniently reserved for consideration in that place. He adds, in
conclusion, that they will not satisfy the Law unless they keep
themselves within its bounds; and in order that they may be more
disposed to obedience, he gently attracts them by subjoining the
promise.  <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md)
