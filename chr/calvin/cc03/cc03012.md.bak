<span id="iv.ix-p1"></span>EXODUS 9

<span id="iv.ix.i"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.ix.i-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
9:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.ix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.i-p2"></span>**1.** Then the Lord said unto Moses, Go in
unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let
my people go, that they may serve me.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p3"></span>**1.** Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Vade ad
Pharaonem, et loquere ad eum, Sic dicit Jehova Deus Hebraeorum, Dimitte
populum meum ut serviant mihi.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p4"></span>**2.** For if thou refuse to let them go,
and wilt hold them still,

<span id="iv.ix.i-p5"></span>**2.** Quod si tu renuis eum dimittere, et
adhuc tu retines eos:

<span id="iv.ix.i-p6"></span>**3.** Behold, the hand of the Lord is upon
thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon
the camels, upon the oxen, and up. on the sheep: *there shall be* a very
grievous murrain.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p7"></span>**3.** Ecce, manus Jehovae erit super
gregem tuum qui est in agro: in equis, in asinis, in camelis, in
armentis et in ovibus pestis gravissima.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p8"></span>**4.** And the Lord shall sever between the
cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of
all that is the children’s of Israel.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et distinguet Jehova inter pecora
Israel, et inter pecora AEgypti: ut non moriatur quicquam eorum quae
sunt apud filios Israel.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p10"></span>**5.** And the Lord appointed a set time,
saying, Tomorrow the Lord shall do this thing in the land.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et statuit Jehova tempus, dicendo,
Cras faciet Jehova rem hanc in terra.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p12"></span>**6.** And the Lord did that thing on the
morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the
children of Israel died not one.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p13"></span>**6.** Fecit itaque Jehova rem hanc
postero die: et mortuum est omne pecus AEgypti: de pecore vero filiorum
Israel ne unum quidem *animal* mortuum est.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p14"></span>**7.** And Pharaoh sent, and, behold,
there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of
Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p15"></span>**7.** Et misit Pharao: et ecce, ex pecore
Israel ne unum quidem *animal* mortuum erat. Et aggravatum fuit cor
Pharaonis, ut non dimitteret populum.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p16"></span><span id="iv.ix.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.i-p17"></span>**1.** *Then the Lord said.* No complaint
or expostulation of Moses is here recounted; and it is possible that he
was quiet and silent, whilst God foresaw what it was necessary to do,
and even commanded what He would have done. But since he only gives a
brief summary of occurrences, we may probably conjecture that, as the
evil grew worse, he had recourse from time to time to the remedy. In the
denunciation, “the Lord God of the Hebrews” is no unmeaning repetition,
that Pharaoh may learn that he, whom he thought to have repelled in the
abundance of his pride, was still in the field against him. For God
insults his ferocity, and by setting forth his name contemptuously
defies his wrath. We have already said that Pharaoh is convicted of
sacrilege, both in his oppression of God’s people and in defrauding God
Himself of His due honor; therefore those words, “Let my people go, that
they may serve me,” have the force of aggravating his sin.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p18"></span><span id="iv.ix.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.i-p19"></span>**2.** *But if thou refuse.* God again
urges him to obedience through fear of punishment, as He usually deals
with the froward. Yet he permits him a short space of time for
repentance, (as before,) if perchance he may lay aside his perverse
determination to refuse. And this Moses now relates more distinctly in
the fifth verse, both to show the extreme obstinacy of his malice,
because the tyrant mocks at God’s forbearance, and follows his own lust;
and also to manifest more clearly from the circumstance of time, that
the cattle of Egypt were smitten not by chance but by the hand of God.
There is also an implied reproof of his senseless obstinacy, as though
Moses said, that God was already enough, and more than enough, provoked;
and therefore, unless he should desist, that God had new and more
terrible plagues at hand, whereby He would overwhelm him. The murrain is
appositely called God’s “hand,” because it arose from His just judgment;
for this expression is opposed to natural causes, to the arts and
devices of men, and to accidental chances — as if Moses had said that
the hand of God would appear in “the very grievous murrain,” that
Pharaoh may perceive the Deity to be wroth with him. Moreover, though
this might seem a lighter plague than those preceding it, yet it was
doubtless more grievous and afflictive to the Egyptians, because it
involved much greater injury at a future period. The hand of God had
before been adverse to them for a short time, and the evil had been
removed together with the infliction; but now the destruction of the
cattle will affect them for many years. For this kind of gradation in
the judgments of God must be observed, as the Law also denounces against
transgressors punishments sevenfold greater, if they do not speedily
return into the way. (See <span id="iv.ix.i-p19.1"></span>[Lev.
26:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#018.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024.md),
[28](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#028)<span id="iv.ix.i-p19.1"></span>..md)
As to his saying that “all the cattle died,” it is a *comprehensive*
 <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) expression, for immediately it
will appear that a considerable number of animals still remained. But he
means that the herds were everywhere destroyed, and the flocks smitten
by the murrain; or, if you prefer it, that the murrain was general in
its attack, and that it reduced Egypt to a state of poverty by the
destruction of their cattle and other animals. Finally, the universal
term merely refers to this plague having been a remarkable proof of
God’s anger, because the pestilence did not only kill a few animals, as
it usually does, but made havoc far and wide of a vast number of herds
and flocks.

<span id="iv.ix.i-p21"></span><span id="iv.ix.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.i-p22"></span>**7.** *And Pharaoh sent.* I leave it
undecided, whether he then first sent these inspectors;  <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) it may be, that, in the blindness of
his obstinacy he neglected this, until he was reminded by Moses; for we
know how the reprobate shut their eyes against the manifest marks of
God’s wrath, and willfully indulge in their errors. Certainly there is
no doubt that Pharaoh, whilst he seeks to harden himself in every way,
deliberately passed over what it was very useful for him to know; but,
since he was informed by Moses of the distinction between the Egyptians
and the Israelites, he is compelled, whether he will or no, to ascertain
from actual inspection, what he would have gladly been in ignorance of.
But this was no obscure demonstration of God’s paternal favor towards
His chosen people; that the contagion should not have affected that part
of Egypt, which was fullest of cattle, though it ravaged the whole
surrounding neighborhood. Wherefore, the hardness of the king’s wicked
heart was all the more base and marvelous, since he was not moved even
by this extraordinary circumstance; for it was a token of horrible
folly, that, when the matter was examined and discovered by his
underlings, he still hardened his heart and would not obey God.

<span id="iv.ix.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.ix.ii-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
9:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.ix.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p2"></span>**8.** And the Lord said unto Moses and
unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses
sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p3"></span>**8.** Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen et ad
Aharon, Tollite vobis plenos pugillos vestros favillae fornacis, et
spargat illam Moses per coelum (vel, per aerem) coram Pharaone.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p4"></span>**9.** And it shall become small dust in
all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains
upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p5"></span>**9.** Et erit in pulverem super totam
terram AEgypti: et erit super hominem, et super jumentum ulcus producens
tumores in tota terra AEgypti.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p6"></span>**10.** And they took ashes of the
furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward
heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth *with* blains upon man and
upon beast.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p7"></span>**10.** Tulerunt ergo favillam fornacis,
et steterunt coram Pharaone: et sparsit illam Moses per coelum, (vel,
per aerem.) Et fuit ulcus tumorem producens in homine et in jumento.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p8"></span>**11.** And the magicians could not stand
before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians,
and upon all the Egyptians.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p9"></span>**11.** Et non poterant magi stare coram
Mose propter ulcus: quia fuit ulcus in magis ut in omnibus AEgyptiis.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p10"></span>**12.** And the Lord hardened the heart
of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the Lord had spoken unto
Moses.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p11"></span>**12.** Et induravit Jehova cor
Pharaonis: et non audivit eos: quemadmodum loquutus fuerat Jehova ad
Mosen.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p12"></span><span id="iv.ix.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p13"></span>**8.** *And the Lord said unto Moses.*
God does not now postpone the time of the punishment, but redoubles the
plagues in a continuous series; nor does he threaten Pharaoh, but,
leaving him, executes the judgment which He decreed; both because it was
now more than sufficiently manifested that admonitions were of no avail
with him, and also that his desperate wickedness might be reproved in
every way. For although I have lately said that all which happened is
not fully related, still the narrative of Moses rather leads us to
infer, that nothing about the boils was previously told to Pharaoh, but
that the ashes  <span id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) were sprinkled,
when he had no suspicion of anything of the kind. But it did not happen
naturally that the heaven was darkened by the dust, and that the disease
arose from thence; for how could a few ashes cover the whole air? But by
this visible sign the tyrant was taught that the calamity which ensued
was inflicted by Moses and Aaron. Moreover, God invested His servants
with high and power, when He gave them command over the air, so that
they should envelop it in darkness, and poison it with contagion. Hence
we gather, that the devil’s are called the princes of the air, not
because they govern it according to their will, but only so far as the
permission  <span id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) to wander in it is
accorded to them.

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p16"></span><span id="iv.ix.ii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.ii-p17"></span>**11.** *And the magicians could not.*
Since the magicians were now also at hand, doubtless they were possessed
by their former folly, so that they stood in readiness, as it were, in
case an opportunity of contention should be offered them. And, in fact,
since Satan, although ten times conquered, is still perpetually hurried
forward with indefatigable obstinacy, so neither do his ministers desist
from their madness, notwithstanding they have experienced how
unsuccessful are their battles. These enchanters had lately confessed
that their art availed no farther, and yet they embolden themselves to
try all extremities, until the disease of the boils drives them back in
disgrace. Wherefore, that we may not betray our madness by similar
audacity, let us learn to give God His full glory by voluntary
submission. But that Pharaoh, when not only deprived of their
assistance, but even when abandoned, and without their presence, is
neither changed nor softened, proves that he was not so much deceived by
the impostures of others, as stupefied by his own malice and perversity;
although Moses here repeats that “his heart was hardened by God;”
because He desired, as if by an opposing barrier, to have an opportunity
for manifesting His power. And here their ignorance is refuted, who
imagine that God is endued with mere prescience; for when “as the Lord
has spoken” is added, He attributes both in conjunction to Himself,
viz., the effect as well as the foreknowledge. On this point we shall
enlarge a little further on; yet let us remark that at the same time the
tyrant was not absolved from crime, for that his hardness of heart was
voluntary. The blains, which were epidemic on the cattle, are a proof
that they did not all die in the former catastrophe.

<span id="iv.ix.iii"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p1"></span><span id="iv.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
9:13-26](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.ix.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p2"></span>**13.** And the Lord said unto Moses,
Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto
him, Thus saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they
may serve me.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p3"></span>**13.** Et ait Jehova ad Mosen, Surge
mane et te siste in conspectu Pharaonis, et dic ei, Sic dicit Jehova
Deus Hebraeorum, Dimitte populum meum ut serviant mihi.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p4"></span>**14.** For I will at this time send all
my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people;
that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p5"></span>**14.** Quoniam hac vice ego mittam omnes
plagas meas in cor tuum, et in servos tuos, et in populum tuum: ut scias
quod nemo sit similis mei in tota terra.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p6"></span>**15.** For now I will stretch out my
hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou
shalt be cut off from the earth.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p7"></span>**15.** Nunc enim extendi manum meam, ut
percutiam te et populum tuum peste: et excideris e terra.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p8"></span>**16.** And in very deed for this cause
have I raised thee up, for to show in thee my power; and that my name
may be declared throughout all the earth.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p9"></span>**16.** Et certe ideo constitui te ut
ostenderem tibi potentiam meam, et ut enarrent nomen meum in universa
terra.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p10"></span>**17.** As yet exaltest thou thyself
against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p11"></span>**17.** Tu adhuc to extollis inpopulum
meum, ut non dimittas eos?

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p12"></span>**18.** Behold, tomorrow about this
time, I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not
been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p13"></span>**18.** Ecce, ego pluam hoc tempore cras
grandinem gravissimam, cui non fuit similis in AEgypto ab eo die quo
fundata fuit hucusque.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p14"></span>**19.** Send therefore now, and gather
thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field: for upon every man and
beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home,
the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p15"></span>**19.** Nunc igitur mitte, collige pecus
tuum, et quicquid tibi est in agro. Omnes homines et jumentum qui
inventi fuerint in agro, et non collecti fuerint intra domum, descendet
super eos grando, et morientur.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p16"></span>**20.** He that feared the word of the
Lord among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee
into the houses:

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p17"></span>**20.** Qui timuit ad sermonem Jehovae
ex servis Pharaonis, confugere jussit servos suos et pecora sua domum.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p18"></span>**21.** And he that regarded not the
word of the Lord left his servants and his cattle in the field.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p19"></span>**21.** Qui vero non adjecit cor suum ad
verbum Jehovae, reliquit servos suos et pecora sua in agro.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p20"></span>**22.** And the Lord said unto Moses,
Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all
the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the
field, throughout the land of Egypt.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p21"></span>**22.** Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen,
Extende manum tuam versus coelum, et erit grando in tota terra AEgypti,
super homines et super jumenta, et super cunctam herbam agri in terra
AEgypti.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p22"></span>**23.** And Moses stretched forth his
rod toward heaven; and the Lord sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran
along upon the ground: and the Lord rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p23"></span>**23.** Extendit ergo Moses virgam suam
versus coelum, et dedit Jehova tonitrua et grandinem: discurritque ignis
per terram, et pluit Jehova grandinem super terram AEgypti.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p24"></span>**24.** So there was hail, and fire
mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in
all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p25"></span>**24.** Et fuit grando atque ignis
grandine implicitus gravis valde: cui similis nulla fuit in tota terra
AEgypti, ex quo fuit in gentem.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p26"></span>**25.** And the hail smote throughout
all the land of Egypt all that *was* in the field, both man and beast;
and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the
field.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p27"></span>**25.** Et percussit grando in tota
terra AEgypti quicquid fuit in agro, ab homine usque ad jumentum. Et
percussit grando cunctam herbam agri, atque omnes arbores agri
confregit.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p28"></span>**26.** Only in the land of Goshen,
where the children of Israel *were*, was there no hail.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p29"></span>**26.** Tantum in terra Gosen, ubi erant
filii Israel, non fuit grando.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p30"></span><span id="iv.ix.iii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p31"></span>**13.** *And the Lord said unto Moses,
Rise up.* God returns again to threats, to try the mind of the wicked
king; not that there is any hope of a cure, but that his obstinacy may
be more and more discovered. For it was desirable as an example, that it
should be known openly how madly those, who are cast into a reprobate
state of feeling, and who are possessed by a spirit of willfulness, rush
upon their own destruction. Surely it would be incredible, that any
human being should have ever resisted God with such headstrong folly and
obstinacy, unless this picture had been presented to us. How often was
Pharaoh commanded to send the people away, and on every occasion a
ratification of the command  <span id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) was
added! So that God no less thundered from heaven than He spoke on earth
by the mouth of His servant and ambassador; yet still the mind of the
tyrant was not subdued into obedience, because Satan alienates the minds
of those, whom by God’s permission he holds in devotion, and bondage, to
himself. Meanwhile, they heap up more terrible vengeance against
themselves by their impious contempt of warnings.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p33"></span><span id="iv.ix.iii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p34"></span>**14.** *For I will at this time.* The
unexpressed condition is implied, “unless he should submit himself to
God.” The meaning is, that although he had already chastised his pride,
yet that this had been done gently and in moderation; but that He now
would use a heavier scourge, since the lighter rods had been unavailing.
Thus his ingratitude is reproved, because he had not acknowledged that
he had been spared, in order that, having suffered only some trifling
losses,  <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) he might return to his
right mind. Wherefore, because God had proceeded gradually with his
punishments, He now threatens that He will inflict many on him at once;
as he is wont to act with the rebellious. On which account also David
exhorts us not to be

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p36"></span>“as the horse and mule — whose mouth
must be held in with bit and bridle when they are restive,” (<span
id="iv.ix.iii-p36.1"></span>[Ps
32:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#009.md)<span
id="iv.ix.iii-p36.1"></span>;)

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p37"></span><span id="iv.ix.iii-p37.1"></span>whence
he concludes, that “many sorrows shall be to the wicked” and rebellious.
But Moses here denounces plagues, which shall not only affect the head
and arms, but which shall reach to the heart itself, and inflict a
deadly wound in his very bowels; for Pharaoh was so obstinate that it
was not enough to batter his sides. In flue, he is enjoined to make
haste and provide against the awful judgement which impended, unless he
chose rather to perish with all his (servants.) The expression, “all my
plagues,” embraces whatever chastisement we shall hereafter see
inflicted on him; and therefore the word, <span
id="iv.ix.iii-p37.2"></span>דבר<span id="iv.ix.iii-p37.3"></span>,
*deber*<span id="iv.ix.iii-p37.4"></span>, designates every kind of
death; as much as to say, that He would heap punishment upon punishment,
until He had destroyed the tyrant together with his whole nation. What
is afterwards added, “that thou mayest know that there is none like me
in all the earth,” implies that Pharaoh had hitherto struggled against
Him, because he had never really and seriously apprehended the extent of
the divine power; for wherever it is really felt, it is impossible but
that pride must be humbled before it. And, doubtless, the reprobate,
although in some measure they recognize the power of God, still rush on
with a kind of frenzied impulse, and their wickedness is combined with
blindness of heart, so that seeing, they do not see. Meantime we are
reminded, that the reprobate only gain this by their stupidity, that God
should proceed against them with all His forces, and drag and compel
them against their will to understand His power, from which they fly.
But that he may expect no longer truce, God affirms in the next verse
that He is advancing with an outstretched hand. For God is not here
commending His patience in the slowness of His procedure, as some prefer
to explain it; but He rather admonishes him that the execution was nigh
at hand, since He had armed Himself, and prepared His forces before He
had spoken a word.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p38"></span><span id="iv.ix.iii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p39"></span>**16.** *And in very deed for this cause
have I raised thee up.* <span id="iv.ix.iii-p39.1"></span>The word,
<span id="iv.ix.iii-p39.2"></span>העמדתי<span
id="iv.ix.iii-p39.3"></span>, *hagnemadthi,* <span
id="iv.ix.iii-p39.4"></span>is variously explained; it properly
signifies “to appoint;” some, therefore, refer it to his eminent
position, as if God had placed Pharaoh on the throne, for the purpose of
better manifesting His glory.  <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md)
<span id="iv.ix.iii-p41.3"></span> The Greek interpreter extends the
meaning, translating it <span id="iv.ix.iii-p41.4"></span>ἐξήγειρά
σε<span id="iv.ix.iii-p41.5"></span>, “I have stirred thee up, as much
as to say, that Pharaoh had been chosen by the secret counsel and
providence of God that His power might be exercised upon him; as He is
constantly said to stir up those whom He brings forward, to apply them
to those objects for which he has destined them. Others think that this
sentence depends on what has gone before, and interpret it “I have
preserved thee,” or “chosen that thou shouldest survive.” For the Hebrew
verb, which is transitive in *Hiphil,*<span id="iv.ix.iii-p41.6"></span>
is derived from <span id="iv.ix.iii-p41.7"></span>עמד<span
id="iv.ix.iii-p41.8"></span>, *gnamod,* <span
id="iv.ix.iii-p41.9"></span>which means “to stand up.” Since, therefore,
God had restrained Himself, He now assigns the cause of His moderation,
because if Pharaoh had fallen in one trifling engagement, the glory of
His victory would have been less illustrious. In fine, lest Pharaoh
should flatter himself, or harden himself by vain confidence, God
affirms that He does not want strength to destroy him immediately, but
that He had delayed his ultimate punishment for another purpose, viz.,
that Pharaoh might slowly learn that he strove in vain against His
incomparable power; and that thus this remarkable history should be
celebrated in all ages. But although Paul follows the Greek interpreter,
there is no reason why we should not embrace this latter sense; for we
know that the Apostles were not so particular in quoting the words, but
that they rather considered the substance. But, although we admit that
by God’s long-suffering Pharaoh continued to hold out, until he became a
clear and notorious proof of the madness and folly of all those who
resist God, yet this also has reference to the eternal prescience of
God; for therefore did God spare Pharaoh to stand for a time, because,
before he was born, he had been predestinated for this purpose.
Wherefore, also, Paul rightly concludes, that

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p42"></span>“it is not of him that willeth, nor of
him that runneth.”  
(<span id="iv.ix.iii-p42.2"></span>[Ro
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.ix.iii-p42.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p43"></span>For whether God raises up or upholds the
reprobate, He wonderfully manifests His glory by their perverseness.
Thus is their ignorance refuted, who, by this cavil, endeavor to
overturn the eternal predestination of God; because it is not said, that
He created Pharaoh with this intention, but that he suspended His
judgment for a. time. For this intermediate and progressive course of
proceeding arose from this source, that Pharaoh was the organ or
instrument of God’s wrath.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p44"></span><span id="iv.ix.iii-p44.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p45"></span>**17.** As yet exaltest thou thyself.
The expression which Moses uses  <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)
denotes the pride of Pharaoh; because he too insolently exalted himself
by trampling on the people. God therefore inquires, as if in
astonishment, what this blinded fury meant, that the tyrant should hope
that the injuries whereby he undeservedly afflicted God’s people, would
be permitted with impunity? For he was already taught, by many miracles,
that God had, as their protector, undertaken the cause of His people, so
that He would be the avenger of all their unjust treatment. At the same
time He ironically reproves the tyrant’s folly, in that he was not
humbled by so many chastisements; as if He had said, that although, when
intoxicated by prosperity, he might have raged against the wretched
people with tyrannical and persevering arbitrariness, yet, after
undergoing so many plagues, it was surely time to cease.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p47"></span><span id="iv.ix.iii-p47.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p48"></span>**18.** *Behold, tomorrow about this
time.* God now indicates the kind of punishment which He was prepared to
inflict, viz., that He would smite with hail both man and beast, and a
part of the crops. It sometimes, indeed, happens that the corn is
destroyed by hail, and occasionally that great injury is thus inflicted
even on men and beasts; nay, it is regarded as an unusual blessing if
ten or fifteen years pass by without such a calamity. But God makes it
apparent by certain signs in the judgment, which he has determined to
execute, that the hail did not arise from natural causes, but that the
atmosphere was manifestly armed by Him for the battle. First, the morrow
is fixed; nor is this enough, the hour also is added. But what
astronomer or philosopher could thus measure the moments for storms and
tempests? Then again, its unusual violence, such as had never been seen
before, is appointed. Fourthly, its extent, from the extreme boundaries
of Egypt, from the one side to the other, as well as its expansion over
its whole breadth. Scarcely once in twenty years will a storm so widely
prevail, flying, as this did, like an arrow; but, restrained within
narrow limits, it; will not thus diffuse itself far and wide. Lastly,
the distinction is added between Goshen and the rest of Egypt. Hence it
is plain, that this hail was not produced by an accidental impulse, but
made to fall by God’s hand; in a word, that it was not the drops of
moisture frozen in mid air, but a portent which transcended the bounds
of nature.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p49"></span><span id="iv.ix.iii-p49.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p50"></span>**19.** *Sealed therefore now.* He does
not give this counsel as if he would spare His professed enemy, but he
insults his mad confidence, because hitherto in his supine security he
had despised whatever punishments had been denounced against him. He
indirectly hints, therefore, that now is the time for fear. Secondly,
that when God contends, the event is not a doubtful one; because He not
only openly challenges him to the combat, but assures him that He shall
have no difficulty in putting him to the rout. Finally, he shows him,
that He has no need of deceit, or of any stratagems to overtake His
enemy, but that, although he grants him a way of escape, still He should
be victorious.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p51"></span><span id="iv.ix.iii-p51.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p52"></span>**20.** *He that feared the word of the
Lord.* In these words Moses shows that there were some who were so far
taught by experience as not altogether to despise what he had denounced;
for hence arose their fear from the denunciation of the punishment,
because they were persuaded that Moses was the servant of God, and a
Prophet, as well as the herald of the Divine judgment. Although it
likewise appears that they had not seriously repented so as to obey God,
but were impelled to take these precautions by immediate and momentary
terror. Thus, particular fear often makes the reprobate anxious either
to deprecate or fly from the vengeance of God. Still Moses says, that
their fear profited them, for they did not experience the same calamity
as others, who were more insensible. In this way God bore witness, that
in proportion as each one more obstinately despises His judgments, the
more grievously and heavily is he afflicted; but that some unbelievers
are in some degree spared from inconveniences, and more gently
chastised, because they at least do not proudly exalt themselves to
despise His power. Moreover, by this destruction the judgment of God
more clearly shone forth, when among the Egyptians themselves, whosoever
was most hardened received the sure reward of his contempt. Yet are we
taught by this example, that it does not greatly profit unbelievers,
though God may pardon them for a while when they are alarmed and
humbled; because they ever remain under condemnation to eternal death.

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p53"></span><span id="iv.ix.iii-p53.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iii-p54"></span>**22.** *And the Lord said.* <span
id="iv.ix.iii-p54.1"></span>The rod of Moses is again employed to bring
on the storm, not so much for Pharaoh’s sake, as that Moses may be the
more encouraged to the remaining contests, when he sees the proof of his
vocation renewed. In the meanwhile, we may observe the trial of his
faith, since before he had received the command to stretch forth his rod
toward heaven, he had not hesitated to predict to Pharaoh the grievous
and miraculous hall. But if any one thinks that this is an <span
id="iv.ix.iii-p54.2"></span>ὕστερον πρότερον<span
id="iv.ix.iii-p54.3"></span>, and that what was first in order of time
is related last, I will not debate it; but this seems more probable to
me, and also to be rightly gathered from the text, that when the day had
elapsed, Moses was commanded to execute that of which the means was
before unknown to him. Hence, also, both Moses himself learnt, and we
also ought now to learn, that all the elements, although without sense,
are still ready to render any kind of obedience to their Maker; since,
at the stretching forth of the rod the air was troubled in an incredible
manner, so that it hurled down an abundance of hail for the destruction
of beasts and men.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p2"></span>**27.** And Pharaoh sent, and called for

is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p3"></span>**27.** Tunc misit Pharao ad vocandum

let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p6"></span>**29.** And Moses said unto him, As soon
as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the
Lord; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail;
that thou mayest know how that the earth is the Lord’s.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p7"></span>**29.** Tunc dixit Moses, Ubi egresses

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p8"></span>**30.** But as for thee and thy servants,
I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p10"></span>**31.** And the flax and the barley was
smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was boiled.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p11"></span>**31.** Linum et hordeum percussa sunt:
nam hordeum maturescebat, et linum erat in calamo.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p12"></span>**32.** But the wheat and the rye were
not smitten; for they were not grown up.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p13"></span>**32.** Triticum vero et zea non sunt

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p14"></span>**33.** And Moses went out of the city
from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the Lord; and the
thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p15"></span>**33.** Et egressus Moses a congressu
Pharaonis extra urbem, expandit manus suas ad Jehovam: et cessarunt
tonitrua et grando, et pluvia non est eftusa super terram.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p16"></span>**34.** And when Pharaoh saw that the
rain, and the hail, and the thunders, were ceased, he sinned yet more,
and hardened his heart, he and his servants.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p17"></span>**34.** Videns autem Pharao quod
cessasset pluvia, et grando, et tonitrua, adjecit adhuc ad impie
agendum, et aggravavit cor suum ipse et servi ejus.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p18"></span>**35.** And the heart of Pharaoh was
hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the Lord
had spoken by Moses.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p19"></span>**35.** Et obduruit cor Pharaonis, nec
dimisit filios Israel, sicut loquutus fuerat Jehova per manum Mosis.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p20"></span><span id="iv.ix.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p21"></span>**27.** *And Pharaoh sent and called.* If
this confession had proceeded from the heart, it would have betokened
repentance; but Moses immediately perceived that fear in the heart of
the wicked is not a principle which governs them in lasting duty;  <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) and this was more manifest in the
result.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p23"></span>Although we must, at the same time,
recollect, what I have already touched upon, that Pharaoh did not lie
designedly; for when seized by terror, he caught at every means to
appease God, but soon after relapsed into his former state of mind. For
although with fox-like cunning the wicked pretend submission, when they
see themselves caught, in order to escape from the snare, still they do
not mean to mock God by their soft words; but rather under the pressure
of necessity they are ready to do anything, and therefore offer
propitiation’s and satisfactions; but when their fear has departed,
because whatever they promised was forcibly extorted from them, they
directly break out afresh. A very similar circumstance is related of
Saul. He confesses to his own disgrace the innocence of David, and yet,
as soon as he has escaped from the danger, and is freed from fear, he
does not cease to persecute him cruelly. (<span
id="iv.ix.iv-p23.1"></span>[1Sa
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#018.md)<span
id="iv.ix.iv-p23.1"></span>, and <span id="iv.ix.iv-p23.2"></span>[1Sa
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#021.md)<span
id="iv.ix.iv-p23.2"></span>.) But if we admit that this was mere
dissimulation, Pharaoh had greater cause for fear, because, being
experimentally convinced that God was his adversary, he was impelled by
his fear to make any conditions whatever. But, first of all, he
acknowledges that he had “sinned this time,” not to excuse the former
cases, but. because, in such gross contempt, the crime of obstinacy was
still more detestable. And this more fully appears in the following
words, wherein he acknowledges the justice of God, and confesses the
wickedness of himself and his people. It is just as if he had said, that
he is deservedly punished, because he had too long provoked God, who is
a just judge. Now since, as far as his words go, Pharaoh professes true
repentance, we may gather from them, that, sinners do not attribute to
God the honor due to His justice, unless they condemn themselves; and
this must be more carefully observed, because there are few who think
that, while they are endeavoring to rebut the accusations of guiltiness,
they are dishonoring God. Yet, whosoever does not judge himself, and who
does not frankly confess his sins, is assuredly murmuring against the
judgment of God. Pharaoh, at length, has recourse to deprecation, in
which he desires to have Moses and Aaron as his intercessors; not, I
admit, without deception, (because hypocrites are always
double-hearted;) yet it is certain, that because he was terrified by his
troubles, he sought for peace with God, lest his rebellion should draw
down upon him new and greater punishments; but as soon as, having
obtained his desire, he ceased to be afraid, the secret wickedness which
lay, as it were, stifled under the abundance of his miseries, burst
forth out of the sense of security. What immediately follows is
variously explained by the translators; some understand it negatively,
“that there be not,” or “if there be not — thunderings;” and even these
disagree among themselves; for some suppose that Pharaoh congratulates
himself, because the thunders have ceased; but it is plain from the
context that they are grossly mistaken. If, then, a negation is
intended, the passage must necessarily refer to the future; as if
Pharaoh had said, that he should be very graciously dealt with, if God
should please to allay the thunderings.  <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) But the various reading is equally
probable; “It is much, or a great thing, that there are, or have been
thunderings;” as though he said, that he had been punished enough, or
more than enough for his folly; or (as best pleases myself) that he is
now subdued by terror, whilst he is alarmed by the continual rollings of
the thunder and the beating of the hail; for he seems to desire to prove
the truth of his conversion, because he is conquered by the terrible
power of God.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p25"></span><span id="iv.ix.iv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p26"></span>**29.** *And Moses said.* In this answer
Moses indirectly hints, that he leaves the presence of Pharaoh, in order
duly and purely to supplicate God; since by his unbelief he would in a
manner pollute the sacrifices. For, as he had already shown, that
legitimate worship could not be offered by the people except away from
Egypt, so now he seeks to be alone for prayer; and thus, by this change
of place, he indicates that the place, in which Pharaoh dwells, is
unholy. We have already said, that Moses promises nothing out of mere
rash impulse, but that, taught either by the inspiration of the Spirit,
or by sure revelation, he pronounces, with the authority of a prophet,
what God is about to do. Moreover, it is not without reason that Moses
exhorts Pharaoh to learn from the remission of the punishment, that the
God of Israel is the Lord of Egypt also; for the word earth seems here
to be limited to Egypt; although I do not deny that it may be properly
understood of the whole world; but, whichever you may prefer, Moses
rightly concludes, that the glory and dominion of God is perfectly
manifested, not only when he appears as an avenger in the infliction of
punishment, but that He also shows it in an opposite way, when all the
elements are subservient to His mercy. Besides, His power is still more
clearly shown forth, when He himself heals the wounds which He has
inflicted; and, therefore, in <span id="iv.ix.iv-p26.1"></span>[Isa
41:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa041.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.ix.iv-p26.1"></span>, and <span id="iv.ix.iv-p26.2"></span>[Isa
45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.ix.iv-p26.2"></span>,
in order to prove His divinity, He joins the two together, viz., that it
is His prerogative and attribute both to “do good, or to do evil.”

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p27"></span><span id="iv.ix.iv-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p28"></span>**30.** *But as for thee and thy
servants, I know.* Such freedom of reproof plainly proves with what
magnanimity the holy Prophet was endued, who, without taking any account
of the wrath of the imperious and cruel tyrant, does not hesitate to
condemn the impiety of himself and his whole court. Nor can it indeed be
questioned, that God miraculously restrained so many wild beasts to keep
their hands off Moses; for it cannot be attributed either to their
moderation or humanity, that men, otherwise worse than bloody-minded,
did not kill him a hundred times over, when he so bitterly provoked
them. But, from his firmness, it also appears how much he had profited
by his novitiate;  <span id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) because he,
who had before fled far for refuge in fear of their darts, now has no
alarm in the hottest conflict. But he justly affirms that the Egyptians
do not “fear the Lord;” because alarm and terror do not always lead the
mind to reverence and due obedience. For Moses speaks of true fear,
which altogether attaches us to God, wherefore it is called “wisdom,”
and “the beginning of wisdom” (<span id="iv.ix.iv-p29.1"></span>[Pr
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.ix.iv-p29.1"></span>,
and <span id="iv.ix.iv-p29.2"></span>[Ps
111:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa111.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.ix.iv-p29.2"></span>.) But hypocrites, although they fear the
name of God, are very far from willingly desiring to serve Him.
Wherefore, lest we be deceived by empty imaginations, let us learn
honestly to sift all our feelings, and diligently to examine into all
those winding  <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) recesses,
wherewith human hearts are filled and incredibly entangled. A question
arises, why Moses undertook the part of an intercessor, when he sees no
repentance? my reply is, that he was not thus ready to spare, as if he
had been persuaded; but that he gave a short intermission, until the
king’s impiety should again betray itself, and thus God should fulfill
what he had predicted respecting all the plagues. It is, then, absurd to
gather, as some do, from this passage, that ministers of the word and
pastors should be satisfied with a mere verbal confession; for Moses did
not so much intend to pardon as to open a way for the remaining
judgments of God.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p31"></span><span id="iv.ix.iv-p31.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p32"></span>**31.** *And the flax and the barley.* He
relates the calamity which the hail inflicted; and shows that a part of
the fruits of the earth was destroyed, viz., that which had already
grown into stalk; but that the seeds which grow more slowly were spared.
For God desired to give a remnant of hope, which might invite the king
and his people to repentance, if only their wickedness were curable.

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p33"></span><span id="iv.ix.iv-p33.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ix.iv-p34"></span>**34.** *And when Pharaoh saw.* Again, as
usual, Pharaoh gathers audacity from the mitigation of his punishment,
as security arms the reprobate against God; for as soon as the scourges
of God rest for awhile, they cherish the presumption that they will be
unpunished, and construe the short truce into an abiding peace. Pharaoh,
then, hardens anew his heart, which he seemed to have somewhat changed,
as soon as he is delivered from this infliction; as though he had not
been warned that others remained behind, nay, that the hand of God was
already stretched out against him. Therefore, at the end of the chapter,
Moses amplifies the crime when he adds, that this had been foretold
 <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) “by the hand of Moses.” We have
sometimes seen already that the wicked king was hardened, as God had
said to Moses; now, more! is expressed, viz., that Moses had been the
proclaimer of his indomitable and desperate obstinacy.

striking, and has never yet been satisfactorily explained. It is,
