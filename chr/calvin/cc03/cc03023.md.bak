<span id="iv.xx.i-p1"></span>EXODUS 20

<span id="iv.xx.i-p2"></span><span id="iv.xx.i-p2.1"></span>[Exodus
20:18-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#018.md)<span

<span id="iv.xx.i-p3"></span>**18.** And all the people saw the
thunderings, and the lightning’s, and the noise of the trumpet, and the
mountain smoking: and, when the people saw it, they removed, and stood
afar off.

<span id="iv.xx.i-p4"></span>**18.** Omnis populus videbant tonitrua et
lampades, et clamorem buccinae, et montem fumantem, vidit *inquam*
populus, et commoti sunt, steteruntque procul.

<span id="iv.xx.i-p5"></span>**19.** And they said unto Moses, Speak
thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we
die.

<span id="iv.xx.i-p6"></span>**19.** Atque dixerunt Mosi, Loquere tu
nobiscum, et obsequemur: et ne loquatur nobiscum Deus, ne forte
moriamur.

<span id="iv.xx.i-p7"></span>**20.** And Moses said unto the people,
Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before
your faces, that ye sin not.

<span id="iv.xx.i-p8"></span>**20.** Respondit autem Moses populo, Ne
timeatis: quia ut tentaret vos venit Deus, et ut sit timor ejus ante
conspectum vestrum, ut non peccetis.

<span id="iv.xx.i-p9"></span>**21.** And the people stood afar off: and
Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.

<span id="iv.xx.i-p10"></span>**21.** Stetit igitur populus procul,
Moses autem appropinquavit ad caliginem, in qua erat Deus.

<span id="iv.xx.i-p11"></span><span id="iv.xx.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xx.i-p12"></span>**18.** *And all the people saw the
thunderings.* Because in the parallel passage  <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) Moses more largely pursues what he
here only touches upon briefly, I shall also defer my full exposition of
it. If he had been the only spectator of God’s glory, the credit of his
testimony would be lighter; after having, then, reported the ten
commandments, which God Himself spoke with His own sacred lips in the
hearing of the people, he adds, at the same time, that the lightning’s
shone openly, the mountain smoked, the trumpets sounded, and the thunder
rolled. It follows, therefore, that by these conspicuous and illustrious
signs, the law was ratified before all the people, from the greatest
even to the least. The confession of the whole people is added; when,
overwhelmed with alarm, they supplicate God to go on speaking no more.
For no longer could they now despise the voice of the man, whom they had
of their own accord desired to be given them as their mediator, lest
they should be consumed by the awful voice of God. He lays before them
the object, for which those signs had appeared to terrify them, viz.,
that God might subdue them to obedience. They were terrified, then, not
that they might be stupified with astonishment, but only that they might
be humbled and submit themselves to God. And this is a peculiar
privilege, that the majesty of God, before whom heaven and earth
tremble, does not  <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) destroy but
only proves and searches His children.
