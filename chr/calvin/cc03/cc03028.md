<span id="v.iii-p1"></span>LEVITICUS 19

<span id="v.iii-p2"></span><span id="v.iii-p2.1"></span>[Lev.
19:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#036),
[37](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#037)<span id="v.iii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii-p3"></span>**36.** I am the Lord your God, which brought
you out of the land of Egypt.

<span id="v.iii-p4"></span>**36.** Ego Jehova Deus vester, qui eduxi vos
e terra Aegypti.

<span id="v.iii-p5"></span>**37.** Therefore shall ye observe all my
statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the Lord.

<span id="v.iii-p6"></span>**37.** Custodite igitur omnia statuta mea,
et omnia judicia mea, et facite illa: ego Jehova.

<span id="v.iii-p7"></span>leviticus 20

<span id="v.iii-p8"></span><span id="v.iii-p8.1"></span>[Leviticus
20:8](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#008)<span id="v.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii-p9"></span>**8.** And ye shall keep my statutes, and do
them: I *am* the Lord which sanctify you.

<span id="v.iii-p10"></span>**8.** Custodite statuta men, et facite ea,
Ego Jehova sanctificans vos.

<span id="v.iii-p11"></span><span id="v.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii-p12"></span>**36.** *I am the Lord your God.* In these
first four passages he treats of the same points which we have observed
in the preface to the Law; for he reasons partly from God’s authority,
that the law should be reverently obeyed, because the Creator of heaven
and earth justly claims supreme dominion; and, partly, he sets before
them the blessing of redemption, that they may willingly submit
themselves to His law, from whom they have obtained their safety. For,
whenever God calls Himself Jehovah, it should suggest His majesty,
before which all ought to be humbled; whilst redemption should of itself
produce voluntary submission. At the beginning he repeats the same words
which he had lately used; and thence exhorts them to observe His
statutes and judgments, *i.e.,* treasure them diligently in their minds.
Afterwards he reminds them wherefore they ought attentively to observe
the Law, viz, that they may perform the works which God therein
requires. Nor is it without a reason that at the end of the second verse
He declares Himself to be Jehovah, because it is not easy either to
subdue rebellious minds or to retain fickle ones in the fear of God. In
the next verse, the qualification “which sanctify you” is added, to
arouse them earnestly to prove their gratitude to God, who has by
peculiar privilege separated them from the rest of mankind.
