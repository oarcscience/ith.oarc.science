<span id="v.xxxiii-p3"></span>**44.** And this *is* the law which Moses
set before the children of Israel:

<span id="v.xxxiii-p4"></span>**44.** Haec est Lex quam proposuit Moses
coram filiis Israel.

<span id="v.xxxiii-p5"></span>**45.** These *are* the testimonies, and
the statutes, and the judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of
Israel, after they came forth out of Egypt:

<span id="v.xxxiii-p6"></span>**45.** Haec testimonia et statuta et
judicia quae pronuntiavit Moses filiis Israel, quum egressi essent ex
Aegypto.

<span id="v.xxxiii-p7"></span>**46.** On this side Jordan, in the valley
over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who
dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after
they were come forth out of Egypt:

<span id="v.xxxiii-p8"></span>**46.** Trans Jordanem in valle e regione
Beth-peor in terra Sehon regis Emorrhaeorum, qui habitabat in Esbon:
quem percussit Moses et filii Israel, quum egressi essent ex Aegypto.

<span id="v.xxxiii-p9"></span>**47.** And they possessed his land, and
the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which *were*
on this side Jordan, toward the sun-rising;

<span id="v.xxxiii-p10"></span>**47.** Et possederunt terram ejus, et
terram Og regis Basan, duorum regum Emorrhaeorum, qui erant trans
Jordanem ad ortum solis.

<span id="v.xxxiii-p11"></span>**48.** From Aroer, which *is* by the
bank of the river Arnon, even unto mount Sion, which *is* Hermon,

<span id="v.xxxiii-p12"></span>**48.** Ab Aroer qui erat juxta ripam
torrentis Arnon, usque ad montem Sion qui est Hermon.

<span id="v.xxxiii-p13"></span>**49.** And all the plain on this side
Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of
Pisgah.

<span id="v.xxxiii-p14"></span>**49.** Et universam solitudinem trans
Jordanem ad orientem usque ad mare planitiei, sub effusionibus aquarum.

<span id="v.xxxiii-p15"></span><span id="v.xxxiii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="v.xxxiii-p16"></span>**44.** *And this is the Law.* This last
passage refers to the same thing, viz., that the Law was promulgated
anew when the people had now reached the threshold of the promised land,
in order that they might be more disposed to obedience, especially when
the two tribes and a half had now, by the conquest of the Amorites,
obtained a resting-place and a home; for this is the reason why their
habitation is mentioned, because the taste of the favor already received
ought to stir up their zeal to proceed more cheerfully. We shall
elsewhere remark on the country and names of places. It is sufficient
here to recollect, that the memory of the Law was renewed, after their
inheritance without the promised land had been obtained by the sons of
Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, and when their assured
possession was before the eyes of the rest. But Moses shews that,
although he might explain the Law at fuller length, still nothing had
been added to that summary which was originally promulgated; but he
rather indicates, that whatever he had taught them during the forty
years, had had no other object than that they might more faithfully and
exactly keep the Law of God.
