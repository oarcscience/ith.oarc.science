<span id="iv.iv-p1"></span>EXODUS 4

<span id="iv.iv.i"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.iv.i-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
4:1-9](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.iv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.i-p2"></span>**1.** And Moses answered and said, But,
behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they
will say, The Lord hath not appeared unto thee.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p3"></span>**1.** Tunc respondit Moses, et dixit, Sed
ecce non credent mihi, neque obedient voci meae quia dicent, Non
apparuit tibi Jehova.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p4"></span>**2.** And the Lord said unto him, What
*is* that in thine hand? and he said, A rod.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et dixit ad eum Jehova, Quid est hoc
in manu tua? Et dixit, Baculus.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p6"></span>**3.** And he said, Cast it on the ground.
And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled
from before it.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p7"></span>**3.** Tunc dixit, Projice eum in terram.
Et projecit in terram, et factus est serpens, et fugit Moses a conspectu
ejus.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p8"></span>**4.** And the Lord said unto Moses, Put
forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand,
and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:

<span id="iv.iv.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Extende
manum tuam, et apprehende caudam ejus. Et extendit manum suam, et
apprehendit eum: et factus est baculus in manu ejus;

<span id="iv.iv.i-p10"></span>**5.** That they may believe that the Lord
God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p11"></span>**5.** Ut credant quod apparuerit tibi
Jehova Deus patrum ipsorum, Deus Abraham, Deus Isaac, et Deus Jacob.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p12"></span>**6.** And the Lord said furthermore unto
him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his
bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand *was* leprous as snow.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et dixit Jehova illi rursum, Induc
nunc manum tuam in sinum tuum. Et induxit manum suam in sinum suum, et
ecce manus ejus leprosa quasi nix.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p14"></span>**7.** And he said, Put thine hand into
thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked
it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his *other*
flesh.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p15"></span>**7.** Et air, Reduc manum tuam ad sinum
tuum. Et reduxit manum suam ad sinum suum: et postquam extraxit e sinu
suo, ecce, reversa est sicut caro ejus.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p16"></span>**8.** And it shall come to pass, if they
will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign,
that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et erit, si non crediderint tibi,
neque obedierint voci signi prioris, credent voci signi posterioris.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p18"></span>**9.** And it shall come to pass, if they
will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice,
that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour *it* upon the
dry *land*: and the water, which thou takest out of the river, shall
become blood upon the dry *land*

<span id="iv.iv.i-p19"></span>**9.** Erit autem, si non crediderint
etiam duobus signis istis, neque obedierint voci tuae, tunc accipies ex
aquis fluvii, et effundes in aridam: et erunt aquae quas sumpseris e
fluvio, erunt *inquam* sanguis in arida.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p20"></span><span id="iv.iv.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.i-p21"></span>**1.** *And Moses answered.* Moses relates
in this chapter how hesitatingly he obeyed God, not from stubbornness,
but from timidity, for he does not shake off the yoke, as unruly beasts
do, but shrinks away from it, that it may not be placed upon him.  <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) And hence we may better perceive under
what infirmity he labored, so that his faith was almost stifled. On the
one side, he was willing and ready to obey; but when the arduous
difficulties of his task presented themselves, he could not escape from
this conflict until he had exhausted all efforts to escape. Nor indeed
can we greatly wonder that he resisted for a time, since he could see
scarcely any advantage in his undertaking. I admit that he ought to have
proceeded according to God’s command, even with his eyes shut, since on
His will alone all believers are bound to depend; he ought not to have
judged of a thing (in itself) incredible, from his own reasoning, but
from the voice of God. Nor, in point of fact, did he either refuse to
credit God’s words, or wish to reject the burden imposed upon him; but
when, on the other hand, he beheld dangers from which he could not
disentangle himself, his mind was thus a prey to distracting feelings.
Neither is there any believer who is not often drawn into such harassing
discussions, whenever his mind is darkened by the perception of
obstacles. There was, therefore, in the mind of Moses, willingness and
zeal, though alacrity and firmness were wanting; because through his
weakness he was compelled to hold back by the hinderances which
presented themselves. We must carefully distinguish between the timidity
which delays our progress and the bold refusal which is allied to
contempt. Many, in flying from trouble, are so withheld from duty, that
they grow hardened in their inactivity; while those who desire to act
rightly, although through anxiety and fear they apparently recoil, still
aspire to ulterior progress, and, in a word, do not so far alternate as
to withdraw themselves altogether from the command of God. Moses seems,
indeed, to murmur, and to enter into altercation with God; but whether
this were audacity or simplicity, there was more of modesty in it, than
as if he had hidden himself in silence, as we have said that many do,
who by their silence only strengthen themselves in the liberty to
disobey. This was clearly his object, that he might afterwards be more
fitted to proceed. The holy man was very anxious, because he knew from
experience that his countrymen were depraved, and almost intractable;
disburdening himself, then, of this anxiety into the bosom of God, he
desires to be confirmed by a fresh promise, so that he may be freed from
this impediment, and proceed with alacrity.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p23"></span><span id="iv.iv.i-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.i-p24"></span>**2.** *What is that in thine hand?* In
accordance with the idiom of the Hebrew language, Moses now explains
more fully, and more distinctly pursues, what he had before only
generally alluded to respecting the signs. In the three signs which he
refers to we must consider their respective *meanings* The pastoral
crook, which he carried in his hand, is flung on the ground, and becomes
a serpent; again it is taken back into his hand, and recovers its
original nature. I doubt not but that God wished to shew him, that
although his condition was abject and despicable, still he would be
formidable to the king of Egypt. For his rod was the symbol of a
shepherd; and what would be more contemptible than for a keeper of sheep
to come up from the desert, and to oppose to the scepter of a most
powerful king that crook, by which he could scarcely protect himself and
his flock from wild beasts? But God assures him, that although deprived
of earthly splendor, wealth, or power, he would still be terrible to
Pharaoh; as much as to say, that he need not fear lest Pharaoh should
despise him, or take no account of him as a mere rustic, because his
rod, turned into a serpent, would inspire more terror than a thousand
swords. As to what Moses says, that he himself fled from it in alarm,
unquestionably God intended to affright his servant, that he might the
better estimate from his own feelings what would be the power of God to
terrify that proud king. This, then, was the object of the miracle, that
there was no occasion for mighty armies, since Pharaoh would tremble at
the sight of the simple rod; and that the rod need not be wielded and
violently agitated, because it would inspire sufficient terror by its
own movement and agitation. The one part of the miracle, where the rod
returned to its former shape, was intended to shew Moses, that what was
to be hostile and injurious to his enemy, would be an assistance and
safeguard to himself. Therefore, the same rod which encouraged and
emboldened Moses, depressed and overwhelmed his foe. But that he dares,
in immediate obedience to the voice of God, to lay hold of the serpent,
is a proof of his remarkable faith; and this appears more manifestly
from his sudden change, that he fears not to provoke a poisonous and
noxious animal, by taking hold of its tail, when he had so lately fled
from its very sight in consternation. His timid mind, then, was capable
of great courage, and his timidity and piety brought forth their fruit
alternately. And this is especially worthy of remark, that Moses was
strengthened by the presence of God; but that he was weakened when he
turned his eyes to the untameable minds of his own race, and to the
proud tyranny of Egypt. The question now arises, whether the change of
the rod into a serpent was real, and actual, or whether the outward form
only was changed? Although I should be unwilling to contend
pertinaciously for a thing of little consequence, I embrace that opinion
which is more probable, that not merely an image or vision appeared, but
that God, who created all things out of nothing, gave a new nature to
the rod, and again made a rod out of the serpent, which was in no degree
more difficult than to change Lot’s wife into a pillar of salt. (<span
id="iv.iv.i-p24.1"></span>[Ge
19:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#026.md)<span
id="iv.iv.i-p24.1"></span>.) Since this was easy to God’s power, it does
not appear likely to me that He had recourse to the illusion of visions.
As to the imitation of the magicians, we will speak of their sorceries
in their proper place.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p25"></span><span id="iv.iv.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.i-p26"></span>**5.** *That they may believe.* This
spectacle, then, was not shewn to Moses once only, but the power was
imparted to him also of frequently repeating the miracle; both to
acquire credit from the Israelites, and to repress the audacity of
Pharaoh. For although the sentence is incomplete, there is no ambiguity
in the sense, viz., that Moses is armed with power from heaven to make
his vocation sure, and that none may doubt him to be a Prophet divinely
commissioned. It would be tedious here to dilate expressly on the use of
miracles, suffice it briefly to lay down, that they sometimes serve as
preparatives to faith, sometimes for its confirmation. We see an example
of both in the metamorphosis of the rod, by which Moses was the more
animated and encouraged to gather strength, although he already believed
God’s promise; but the Israelites, who were both incredulous and
unteachable, were prepared and compelled to believe. Besides, the
miracle opened a door of faith with the Israelites, that, being
persuaded of his prophetical office, they might submit to be taught;
whilst he was himself led on to greater assurance and perseverance. For
although the Almighty begins further back, and refers to the adoption of
the patriarchs, and this was calculated to lay the foundation of their
hope of redemption, it still does not follow that they were prepared to
receive Moses, until the authority of his ministry had been established.
Wherefore, I have said, that their faith was commenced by the miracle.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p27"></span><span id="iv.iv.i-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.i-p28"></span>**6.** *Put now thy hand into thy bosom.*
By this sign Moses was instructed that what is in the greatest vigour
withers away at once, at the command of God; and that what is dry is
thus restored to its original vigour; in a word, the statement of Paul
was confirmed by it, that God “calleth those things which be not, as
though they were.” (<span id="iv.iv.i-p28.1"></span>[Ro
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017)<span id="iv.iv.i-p28.1"></span>..md)
It was, so to say, a kind of leprosy, when Moses was banished from the
court into the land of Midian, where he led his flock through wild and
rough places, among thorns and brambles. After he had passed forty years
like one half-dead, having no dignity or name, he regained, as by a
restoration, (*postliminio*) what he had lost. Therefore God now
promises him that he would soon restore what He had taken away. This is
the simple connection of the sign with its effect, with which sober
readers will be content, without giving heed to the subtleties of
others. For this was particularly needful to be understood, that all men
stand or fall according to God’s will; that when they seem most strong,
their strength suddenly fails, and they waste away; and, again, as soon
as God pleases, they return from their deformed and failing state to
rigor and beauty. In this way the holy man learnt that, as he had lain
in obscurity for a time, because he had been withdrawn, by God’s hand,
from the society of men, and had been cast into solitude, so he need not
despair of becoming a different man by the same hand. This condition,
too, in some measure, pertained to the whole body of the people; but
because it better suits the person of Moses, it is preferable to retain
this exposition; lest, only considering his present position, as a mean
and humble shepherd, he should distrust his capacity for undertaking his
office, and that he should expect dignity and boldness to be given him
by God. Moreover, God did not mean to instruct Moses individually only,
(as we have said,) but to raise him above the contempt of the people,
that the exile by which his dignity had been marred, should not detract
from his influence and authority; but, because the calling of God shone
forth in him like a resurrection, that he should, at the same time, be
invested with weight and reputation.

<span id="iv.iv.i-p29"></span><span id="iv.iv.i-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.i-p30"></span>**8.** *And it shall come to pass, if they
will not believe thee.* <span id="iv.iv.i-p30.1"></span>In these words
God took away from Moses every handle for doubt; as much as to say, that
he was sufficiently provided and strengthened to overcome the
stubbornness of the people; and yet, heaping up the measure to
overflowing, he afterwards added a third sign, from whence Moses might
attain full confidence, and that no further hinderance should oppose his
pious desires. This, too, is a remarkable evidence of the kindness of
God, that he deigned so liberally to add sign to sign, and to contend
with the evil heart of the people, until with a strong hand he drew them
out of their torpor of incredulity. Surely, if they neglected the first
miracle, they were unworthy to have another proof of his power set
before them by God. It was, then, a wonderful exercise of longsuffering
still to persevere in arresting their dullness. With equal clemency does
He now overlook our sluggishness of heart; because, when with far less
reverence than we ought we receive the testimonies whereby He manifests
His grace, He avenges not our foul ingratitude, but rather adds new
remedies for the cure of our unbelief. As by the two former miracles God
shewed the power which he willed to exercise by the hand of Moses, so in
this third He taught them what would be His dealings with the Egyptians.
And then, both from within and from without, Moses was confirmed before
all the people. The conclusion is, then, that when God should lift up
His hand against the Egyptians, so far would they be from having
strength to resist, that the very strongholds in which they proudly
trusted should be felt to be adverse and injurious to them. We know how
many and various were the advantages they derived from the Nile. Their
land, on one side, was rendered, by its opposing barrier, safe and
invincible; its many ports enriched their nation by their convenience
for the importation and exportation of merchandise; the fertility of
their fields arose from its inundations; in a word, Egypt attributed the
chief part of its prosperity to the Nile. But now God gives warning not
only that it should not profit the Egyptians, but that it was in His
power to turn all its advantages into injuries; nay, that the very
stream which used to fertilize their land by its irrigation, should
cover and defile it with blood. With respect to the words, the “voice
<span id="iv.iv.i-p30.2"></span>of the sign” is figuratively applied to
mean a demonstration of the power of God, by which the Israelites might
be taught that Moses was sent them by God as their deliverer. For
although the rod turned into a serpent could not speak, yet very loudly,
indeed, did it announce, that what the Israelites deemed altogether
impossible, would not be difficult to God. Others thus resolve the
particle <span id="iv.iv.i-p30.3"></span>את<span
id="iv.iv.i-p30.4"></span>,  <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) <span
id="iv.iv.i-p31.7"></span> “If they will not believe your voice, because
of the sign;” <span id="iv.iv.i-p31.8"></span>but the former
interpretation is more correct. The meaning of the expression, however,
is added soon afterwards, in this distinction — “If they will not
believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice;” <span
id="iv.iv.i-p31.9"></span>as though God had said, that His power cried
out, <span id="iv.iv.i-p31.10"></span>or thundered in His miracles, to
obtain a hearing for the teaching of His servant.

<span id="iv.iv.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
4:10-17](../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p2"></span>**10.** And Moses said unto the Lord, O my
Lord, I *am* not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast
spoken unto thy servant; but I *am* slow of speech, and of a slow
tongue.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p3"></span>**10.** Tunc dixit Moses ad Jehovam,
Obsecro Domine, ego non sum vir disertus, neque a die hesterno, neque
nudius tertius, neque ex quo locutus es servo tuo: quoniam ore lento, et
lingua lenta ego sum.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p4"></span>**11.** And the Lord said unto him, Who
hath made man’s mouth? Or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing,
or the blind? have not I the Lord?

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p5"></span>**11.** Respondit autem illi Jehova, Quis
posuit os in homine? aut quis statuit mutum, vel surdum, aut videntem,
vel caecum? annon ego Jehova?

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p6"></span>**12.** Now therefore go, and I will be
with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p7"></span>**12.** Nunc igitur proficiscere, et ego
adero ori tuo, et te docebo quae loquaris.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p8"></span>**13.** And he said, O my Lord, send, I
pray thee, by the hand *of him whom* thou wilt send.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p9"></span>**13.** Et dixit, obsecro Domine, mitte
per manum per quam mittes.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p10"></span>**14.** And the anger of the Lord was
kindled against Moses, and he said, *Is* not Aaron the Levite thy
brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh
forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his
heart.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p11"></span>**14.** Et iratus est furor Jehovae
contra Mosen, et dixit, Annon Aharon fratrem tuum Levitam novi, quod
loquendo loquuturus sit ipse? Atque etiam ecce egredietur in occursum
tuum, et te aspiciens laetabitur in corde suo.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p12"></span>**15.** And thou shalt speak unto him,
and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his
mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p13"></span>**15.** Loqueris igitur ad cum, et pones
verba in os ejus, et ego ero cum ore tuo, et cum ore ejus, et ostendam
vobis quae sitis facturi.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p14"></span>**16.** And he shall be thy spokesman
unto the people: and he shall be, *even* he shall be to thee instead of
a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p15"></span>**16.** Et loquetur ipse pro te ad
populum, eritque tibi pro ore, et tu eris illi pro Deo.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p16"></span>**17.** And thou shalt take this rod in
thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p17"></span>**17.** Et baculum hunc accipies in manu
tua, ut facias per eum (*vel*,cum eo) signa.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p18"></span><span id="iv.iv.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p19"></span>**10.** *O my Lord.* Moses catches at
every word of escape, so as to force himself from the task imposed on
him, not that he desires to refuse the command, but because he trembles
at its importance. It is this distrust of his own powers which makes him
so hesitating and timid. The remedy was obvious, that he should assure
himself, since he well knew that he was undertaking nothing rashly, that
God, whose command he obeyed, would supply him with ample strength. In
this, then, lay the fault, that he did not cast all his cares on God,
and, setting aside his own weakness, hope against hope, like Abraham,
who

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p20"></span>“considered not his own body now dead;
neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb; being fully persuaded that
what God had promised, he was able also to perform.” (<span
id="iv.iv.ii-p20.1"></span>[Rom. 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#019.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021)<span id="iv.iv.ii-p20.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p21"></span><span id="iv.iv.ii-p21.1"></span>It was
an act of modesty in him to reflect on the defect which he mentioned, if
he had but asked for succor from God; but when he proceeds further, and
requests to be altogether discharged, he does an injustice to God, as if
He would lay a greater burden on His servants than they could bear, or
would give any inconsiderate command. This over-anxious caution is,
therefore, deservedly condemned, although it may have some admixture of
virtue; because whatever difficulty we encounter, this ought to be a
sufficient encouragement to us, that as often as God chooses men as His
ministers, although they are in themselves good for nothing, He forms
and prepares them for their work. It is, indeed, lawful to fear in
perplexities, provided that our anxiety overcomes <span
id="iv.iv.ii-p21.2"></span>not the desire to obey; but whatever God
enjoins it is never right to refuse on any pretext. Moreover, we see
that the instruments which seem but little suitable are especially
employed by Him, in order that His power may more fully appear. He
might, if He had chosen to use Moses as His ambassador, have made him
eloquent from the womb; or, at least, when He sends him to his work,
have corrected his stammering tongue. It seems a mockery, then, to give
a commission of speaking to a stammerer; but in this way, (as I have
said,) He causes His glory to shine forth more brightly, proving that He
can do all things without extrinsic aid. Interpreters vary as to the
meaning of the words. Some think that the clause “since thou hast spoken
to thy servant” is added in amplification, as if the tongue of Moses
began to be more slow than ever since the vision had appeared; but since
the particle <span id="iv.iv.ii-p21.3"></span>גם<span
id="iv.iv.ii-p21.4"></span>,  <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md)
*gam*<span id="iv.iv.ii-p22.6"></span>, is thrice repeated, I interpret
it simply, that Moses had never been eloquent from his infancy, and that
he was not now endued with any new eloquence.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p23"></span><span id="iv.iv.ii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p24"></span>**11.** *Who hath made man’s mouth?* Here
the cause is expressed, why the hesitation of Moses was worthy of
reprehension; viz., because arrested by his own infirmity, he did not
look up to God, who, being above the want of any human aid, easily
accomplishes whatsoever He has decreed, and subduing all the obstacles
which terrify men, obtains in any direction assistance according to his
will. Moses objects his stammering as a cause for holding back; God
replies, that it is He alone who governs the tongue which He has
created; therefore, that if some be tongueless or dumb, and some quick
and eloquent of speech, the difference is all of His good pleasure.
Whence it follows that all nature (as it is called) is subject to his
government, so that He easily finds means of the things that are not;
and, on the other hand, remove far out of the way whatever impediments
interpose, and even forces them into obedience. But He not only asserts
his right and power of government in the general course of nature, but
teaches that it is of His special grace alone that some exceed others in
eloquence; and not only so, but that it is in His hand to make wonderful
changes, so as to strike the most eloquent dumb, and to fit the tongue
of the dumb for speaking. And this experience also shews, that sometimes
those who excel in readiness of speech, want words; and, on the
contrary, that the stammering and slow of speech plead a single cause
with admirable dexterity, although the power may be wanting to them in
every other case. Since, then, it is in God’s power to bind or to loose
men’s tongues at any moment, it was wrong of Moses to hesitate, as if in
surprise, because he possessed not natural freedom of speech; as if it
were not possible for the author of nature to remedy this disadvantage.
But while it is good to magnify the immense power of God, in removing
all the hinderances which oppose us, so must we beware of resting upon
it indiscriminately, as though it were subject to our fancies. For we
see men, whilst they too boldly undertake whatever their own lusts
suggest, shielding themselves with this thought, that all means and
events are in God’s hands, so that nothing may stand in the way of their
impetuosity. But the power of God is basely profaned by this rashness;
and, therefore, this truth is not duly applied to its legitimate
purpose, unless a vocation and command clearly invites us on. We must,
then, mark the connection: Go, where I shall send thee. Am I not
Jehovah, who gives to men speech, and sight, and hearing? the tendency
of which is, that Moses, confidently trusting to the bounty of God,
should devote himself earnestly to his work.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p25"></span><span id="iv.iv.ii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p26"></span>**13.** *Send, I pray thee, by the hand.*
Those who interpret this passage as alluding to Christ,  <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) as though Moses said, that His power was
needed to accomplish so mighty a task, introduce a forced and
far-fetched sense, which is contradicted by the context, for God would
not have been so aroused to anger by such a prayer. I see not why others
should suppose it to be spoken of Aaron;  <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) for there is no weight in their
conjecture, that Moses preferred his brother to himself. The third sense
is more probable, viz., that God should stretch forth his hand to direct
whomsoever he destined for the work. In that case, the relative must be
in the masculine gender; but in order to avoid all ambiguity, I prefer
the feminine, as I have translated it. (*Mitte per manum per quam*.) For
there is no doubt but that Moses desires the task, too weighty and
difficult for himself, to be transferred to some one else; just as if he
had said — Since there are multitudes at hand whom thou mayest employ,
choose whomsoever thou wilt of them, provided only it be some other, and
that I be excused. There is an implied antithesis between Moses and
others, in which he hints at his own natural disqualification, and says
that others are endued with dexterity, industry, and activity; and
thence he argues that it will be absurd that God should reject the hands
which are adapted and ready for the work.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p29"></span><span id="iv.iv.ii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p30"></span>**14.** *And the anger of the Lord was
kindled.* This passage confirms, by opposition, that expression, that
there is no better sacrifice than to obey the voice of the Lord, (<span
id="iv.iv.ii-p30.1"></span>[1Sa
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.iv.ii-p30.1"></span>,) since God is so grievously offended with
the hesitation of Moses, in spite of his specious excuses. But nothing
is more pleasing to God than to maintain the authority of his word, and
that men should suffer themselves to be guided by this rein. God had
pardoned His servant’s slowness and unwillingness to the work; but
beholding that he obstinately refused, He spares him no longer. Hence we
are warned cautiously to beware, lest if God bear with us for a time, we
give way to self-indulgence, as if we were permitted to abuse His
patience with impunity. Still it is a mark of His fatherly kindness,
that in His anger He contents Himself with reproof. As to His saying
that he knew that Aaron would be his brother’s interpreter, it is
questionable whether He had intended from the beginning to employ him in
this way, or whether He conceded thus much at length to the diffidence
of Moses.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p31"></span>It is indeed true, that God does nothing
which He has not decreed by His secret providence before the creation of
the world; yet sometimes second causes intervene why this or that should
be done. Either view is probable, — either that God affirms Aaron to be
already chosen by Him to be an assistant to Moses, or that He says He
will grant this concession to the infirmity of Moses. The latter pleases
me best, that Aaron should be added in anger as his brother’s companion,
and that part of the honor should be transferred to him; when Moses, by
his own repugnance, had deprived himself of some of his dignity. But why
is he called “the Levite,” as if he were an unknown person? Some reply,
that there were many among the Israelites of that name; but this simple
solution satisfies me, that it was not any indifferent individual of the
children of Israel who was promised to Moses as his companion, but his
own brother; one who, by his close relationship, might exercise greater
familiarity with him. Unless, perhaps, God looked forward to the future
calling of the tribe of Levi; for he tells us, by the mouth of Malachi,
that His covenant was with Levi, that his descendants should be the
keepers of the law and of the truth, and the messengers of the Lord of
hosts. (<span id="iv.iv.ii-p31.1"></span>[Mal
2:4-8](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iv.ii-p31.1"></span>.) Thus the sense would be very satisfactory,
that God would restrain His wrath, and although aroused to anger by the
refusal of Moses, he would still take an ambassador out of that tribe
which he destined to the priesthood. Moreover, no slight confirmation is
added, in that Aaron would come forth to meet his brother in the Desert,
and would receive him with great joy. It was as much as to shew that
whilst God was pressing forward His servant from the land of Midian with
the one hand, He would stretch forth the other to draw him into Egypt.
Though the vision ought to have quickened him to perform God’s command,
yet because it was necessary to stimulate his inactivity, Aaron was
sent, as if God openly put forth His hand to excite him forward. For he
had neither come into the Desert for pleasure, nor by chance, nor from
vain curiosity; but Moses knew assuredly that a banner thus was set up
for him by God, to shew him the certainty of his way. So by the coming
of Ananias the vision seen by Paul was confirmed, and placed beyond the
reach of doubt. (<span id="iv.iv.ii-p31.2"></span>[Ac
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iv.ii-p31.2"></span>.) This was, indeed, extorted from God by the
importunity of Moses. According to His infinite goodness He willed to
elicit from the sin of His servant materials for His grace; just as He
is accustomed to bring light out of darkness. (<span
id="iv.iv.ii-p31.3"></span>[2Co
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#006)<span id="iv.iv.ii-p31.3"></span>..md)
God mentions his brother’s gladness to Moses, in order to reprove his
own indifference; as much as to say, Aaron will willingly come forth,
and will receive you with joy and gladness; whilst you, depressed with
sorrow and anxiety, or stupified by distrust, can scarcely be induced to
stir a foot.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p32"></span><span id="iv.iv.ii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p33"></span>**16.** *And he shall be thy spokesman.*
God destroys the pretext for his exemption, by assigning to his brother
the office of spokesman, and yet does He not put the other in his place;
nay, so merciful is the arrangement, that while He yields to His
servant’s prayer, He yet confers honor upon him in spite of himself. The
offices are thus divided — Moses is to have the authority, Aaron is to
be the interpreter. Thus Moses is set before his brother, from no
respect to his own dignity; because the grace of God was to shine forth
conspicuously in the head no less than in the members; as it is
expressed in these words, that “Aaron should be instead of a mouth, and
Moses instead of God;” *i* *e*., that he was to dictate what Aaron
should faithfully report, and to prescribe what he should obediently
follow. By this example did God bear witness that the gifts of the
Spirit, as well as our vocations, are distributed by Him at His own good
pleasure; and that none excels either in honor or in gifts, except
according to the measure of His free bounty. But that the first-born is
made subject to the younger, and is only appointed to be his spokesman,
whereas God might have accomplished by his hand and labor, what he
rather chose to perform by Moses; hence let us learn reverently to
regard His judgments, because they are incomprehensible to us, and like
a deep abyss. “To be instead of God” is the same as to lead or to
direct, or to have the chief command; as the Chaldee Paraphrast  <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) renders it, to be the chief or master. It
is a very weak calumny of the Arians to abuse this and similar passages,
in order to refute the proofs of Christ’s divinity, because there is a
great difference in speaking of one as God simply and absolutely, and
with circumstantial additions. For we know that the name of God is
attributed to every potentate, improperly indeed, yet not unreasonably;
as when the devil himself is called “the god of this world,” (<span
id="iv.iv.ii-p34.6"></span>[2Co
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004)<span id="iv.iv.ii-p34.6"></span>;.md)
but wherever mention is made of the true Deity, Scripture never profanes
that sacred name.

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p35"></span><span id="iv.iv.ii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.ii-p36"></span>**17.** *And thou shalt take this rod.*
There is no doubt that God chose this shepherd’s rod to be the
instrument of his power, in order the more to confound the pride of
Pharaoh. For what but shame and reproach could it bring to Moses, that
he should bear with him the crook with which he had heretofore guided
his sheep in their folds and hovels? This symbol, then, of a rustic and
contemptible occupation, was opposed to the scepter of Pharaoh, not
without humiliation. In this respect, therefore, the obedience of Moses
is worthy of praise, because he is not ashamed of a mean and humble
appearance, but willingly carries his rod, and thus makes himself as
nothing, and glorifies God. So is God usually wont to hide his treasures
in earthen vessels, and to choose “the weak things of the world to
confound the things that are mighty.” But from Moses being commanded to
work the miracles with the rod, we gather that outward signs are often
made use of by God, when He works by His own hand; not to derogate at
all from his power, or to obscure his praise, but to make it manifest
that the whole world is subject to him, and that he freely applies to
whatever use he pleases, things which are otherwise of no account.

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p14"></span><span id="iv.iv.iii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p15"></span>**18.** *And Moses went.* It is
surprising that Moses should have suppressed the vision whereby the mind
of his father-in-law might have been most inclined to let him go; for he
speaks merely of human feelings, that he desired to revisit his brethren
and relations. Yet it must have been disagreeable to his father-in-law
to lose his services, and that diligence and industry by which he had
largely profited; nor could it have been pleasant to send away his
daughter and grandchildren to a foreign country. Whether he was
forbidden to do so by God, or whether he was silent from fear and shame,
is uncertain; but I incline rather to this supposition, that he dared
not speak of his vocation, lest its incredibility should cause him to be
suspected of falsehood and vanity. Since, then, it would have been
difficult to obtain belief as to his vocation, he preferred making a
pretext of his natural affection. But Jethro being persuaded more by
divine inspiration than by that excuse, was easily prevailed on;
although I make no doubt that for forty years Moses had been giving such
proofs of his honesty, that he was exempted from every evil suspicion.
We know how much respect is gained by long experience; since, then,
Moses had so long manifested his integrity, his father-in-law could have
no fears of his levity, or fraud, or deceit. By this example believers
learn ever to seek to obtain a good reputation; for there is nothing
which so greatly facilitates the transaction of all affairs as the
constant course of an upright and innocent life. For, from whence arises
so much difficulty in obtaining what each may want from his neighbor?
Whence such hinderances, such reproaches on one side and the other, but
because, while every one would be believed, no one labors to obtain
credit by his integrity? But although Moses had conciliated his
father-in-law by his upright and holy life, still he was confirmed in
his vocation by the readiness with which his demand was complied with,
for the permission was full of courtesy and kindness without any sign of
unwillingness or regret.

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p16"></span><span id="iv.iv.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p17"></span>**19.** *And the Lord said*  <span
id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) *unto Moses* Some connect this sentence
with what follows, as if God had spoken to his servant after permission
to return had been given him by his father-in-law; but my opinion rather
is, that what had before been omitted is here inserted out of its place.
Such repetition is frequent in the Scriptures.  <span
id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) Moses, therefore, adds to what he had
already said, that the fear of danger was removed, since God had
testified that the recollection of his having slain the Egyptian had
ceased. For this would have been a stumblingblock at the very outset, if
Moses had supposed that this accusation would have met him; not because
his conscience smote him before God, but because he would have been
rejected by the perverse judgments of men. Therefore, on this point,
also, God provides against his fear, assuring him that the enemies were
dead who had plotted against his life. And, perhaps, he now particularly
notices this, because in asking for leave to depart, he could safely
speak of it; for it is probable that Jethro, before he had married his
daughter to an unknown foreigner, had demanded the cause of his exile;
since it was easy to conjecture by his wandering in the Desert, that he
had been expelled from his country. Having then confessed that he fled
from the wrath of the king, he now says that he is recalled by divine
revelation, and that a safe return is promised him. Nor is he guilty of
falsehood; for, amongst other things, God had promised him that no
danger awaited him from his former enemies.

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p20"></span><span id="iv.iv.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p21"></span>**20.** *And Moses took his wife.* By
taking his wife and children with him, Moses clearly and freely
professed, that he was returning to Egypt, to dwell there. The ass upon
which he set them, is a plain proof how humble was his condition, and
how slender his substance. For it is improbable that he left either
money or silver vessels or precious garments with his father-in-law, so
as to present himself to his people in poverty and nakedness. But as he
had been content in the land of Midian with his indigence and coarse
fare, he continues in the same simple estate; nor is he ashamed in his
contemptible and common habit to mount the stage on which his poverty
would be conspicuous, which in the Desert had been concealed. It is well
known as a matter of experience, that the poor are led to crime more by
the fear of shame than by hunger, cold, and other discomforts. Wherefore
Moses withstood a very heavy temptation, when he cared not for being
laughed at, and despised, and presented himself without any earthly
splendor. But there is here an implied antithesis between “the rod of
God” and the appearance of the humble and despised man, without any
other equipment whatever; it is as much as to say, that it did not
trouble him that he was without everything else, as long as he had the
rod, which abundantly compensated for all deficiencies. Therefore,
although he perceived that he would be exposed to the scorn of high and
low, in leading the ass, burdened, as we have been observing, still he
thought himself well, and more than well provided in his rod, the
instrument of divine power, by which he should magnificently triumph,
and could afford to dispense with the pomp of royalty. And surely the
marks by which God would have his servants distinguished, deserve this
honor, that we should require nothing to be added to their dignity. We
must observe the epithet applied to the rod; it is called no longer the
rod of Moses, but “the rod of God,” because it is not used, as of old,
to conduct his flock, but  <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) to
represent the power of God. For since it was by the sovereign power of
God that it worked miracles, whatever concerned their glory is truly and
properly ascribed to God. Elsewhere, indeed, it is called the rod of
Moses; inasmuch as God communicates his own titles to the ministers
chosen and created by himself, since he supplies them with the efficacy
of his Spirit.

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p23"></span><span id="iv.iv.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p24"></span>**21.** *When thou goest to return.*
Moses had not previously enumerated the wonders; but from this verse we
gather, that whatever we shall presently read to be done, was already
commanded by God. There is then, no doubt, but that God had already
advised him of his whole course of proceeding, lest he might yield to
the obstinacy of the proud tyrant, and when two or three miracles had
been wrought in vain, might cast away his rod, together with the charge
committed to him. Now, therefore, God exhorts him to perseverance; and
although he might perceive after three or four miracles that the
obstinacy of the king was indomitable, still that he should not turn
back, nor be discouraged, but should continue even unto the end. This,
then, is the sum, that he should not faint nor fail, when he saw the
inutility of his first efforts; nor cease to contend boldly till he had
fulfilled all the objects of his vocation. Moreover, lest he might think
it the effect of chance, that he did not immediately obtain the victory,
or might consider it strange that the miracles should be eluded with
impunity by a mere mortal, as if he stood before God unconquered in his
boldness, God himself foretells that he would be the moderator of all
this contest, nay, that whatsoever should seem to oppose the deliverance
of his people would arise from his own secret counsel. Thus he shews
Moses the reason why he should not stop until he had performed all the
miracles; because the tyrant must be gloriously conquered, and
overwhelmed in so many hard-fought engagements, that the victory might
be more splendid. In the meantime He declares that the king of Egypt
would not be thus obstinate contrary to His will; as if He could not
reduce him to order in a moment; but rather that He would harden his
heart in order that He might violently overwhelm his madness.  <span
id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) The word which Moses uses signifies
sometimes to apprehend, sometimes to restrain by force, sometimes to
strengthen; but it seemed to me that I should best render its sense by
the word “*constringo*,” to constrain; since undoubtedly God would make
it appear that he would be the President  <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59) (as it were.md) of all the contests in which
Moses was to engage, so as even to control the heart of his adversary,
and to harden it into obstinacy. Since the expression seems harsh to
delicate ears, many soften it away, by turning the act into mere
permission; as if there were no difference between doing and permitting
to be done; or as if God would commend his passivity, and not rather his
power. As to myself, I am certainly not ashamed of speaking as the Holy
Spirit speaks, nor do I hesitate to believe what so often occurs in
Scripture, that God gives the wicked over to a reprobate mind, gives
them up to vile affections, blinds their minds and hardens their hearts.
But they object, that in this way God would be made the author of sin;
which would be a detestable impiety. I reply, that God is very far from
the reach of blame, when he is said to exercise his judgments:
wherefore, if blindness be a judgment of God, it ought not to be brought
in accusation against him, that he inflicts punishment. But if the cause
be often concealed from us, we should remember that God’s judgments are
not without reason called a “great deep,” and, therefore, let us regard
them with admiration and not with railing. But those who substitute his
permission in the place of his act, not only deprive him of his
authority as a judge, but in their repining, subject him to a weighty
reproach, since they grant him no more of justice than their senses can
understand.

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p27"></span><span id="iv.iv.iii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p28"></span>**22.** *Israel is my son, even my
first-born.* God thus refutes, by anticipation, the only pretext by
which Pharaoh could justify his refusal to let the people go. For Jacob
had spontaneously submitted himself and all his family to his
government; he had then free power to retain the people, which, by the
common law of nations, was subject to the dominion of Egypt. But if it
be an act of impiety to violate the ordinance instituted by God, the
demand of Moses might appear improper, that the legitimate authority of
the king should be abolished against his own will. For what was the
object of proposing the departure of the people, except to compel the
king to renounce his own authority? In order, then, to shew that he took
nothing away unjustly or unreasonably from Pharaoh, God alleges the
privilege by which the Israelites were excepted from ordinary laws; for
by calling them His sons, He claims liberty for them; since it would be
absurd that God himself, the supreme Ruler of heaven and earth, should
be deprived of the sons whom He had deigned to adopt. He, therefore,
indirectly compares his own paternal power with Pharaoh’s earthly rule;
because nothing could be less reasonable than that a mortal should
refuse to yield to the Maker of himself and all the world. Still this is
not applicable to all believers in general; as if it were wrong for them
to be subject to kings, or as if their temporal subjection deprived them
of their inheritance of the world; but mention is here only made of the
special prerogative with which God had honored the posterity of Abraham,
when he gave them the dominion of the land of Canaan. Therefore, not
content with the simple appellation of son, He calls Israel his
first-born. By this honorable title He unquestionably prefers him to the
other nations; as though He had said, that he was raised to the degree
of the primogeniture, and was superior to all the world. This passage,
then, may be accommodated to the calling of the Gentiles, whom God had
already decreed to bring into fellowship with his elect people, so that,
although they were younger, they might be united with his first-born. I
allow, indeed, that all the race of Adam was then cast off; but, because
Adam was made in the image of God, his posterity were always reckoned,
in a certain sense, to be the children of God; for, whilst I readily
admit that the holy offspring of Abraham are here compared with the
nations who at that time were still heathen, and that in this respect
they are called his first-born, because they are pre-eminent in dignity;
still we must come to Christ, the only head, in order that the adoption
should be sure. For we must hold fast to that statement of St. Paul,
that the blessing of Abraham was not promised to his seeds, but to his
seed; because not all that sprang from his flesh are accounted to be
children, but those that were called; as Isaac, Ishmael being rejected,
and as Jacob, Esau being passed by. (<span

id="iv.iv.iii-p28.2"></span>.) But Christ is the root of our calling.
Therefore, what in Hosea is spoken, as here, of the whole people,
Matthew limits to Christ; and justly, since upon Him alone the grace of
adoption is founded. (<span id="iv.iv.iii-p28.3"></span>[Ho

<span id="iv.iv.iii-p30"></span>**23.** *And I say unto thee, Let my son
go.* This was not the beginning of the legation, but its final clause;
for Moses warned the desperate man of his son’s death, when everything
else had been tried in vain. The meaning is, then, that the obstinacy of
the tyrant must not prevent Moses from pressing him even to this final
act. Therefore this injunction was an exhortation to perseverance; as
appears from the context, when God declares that he will punish the
obstinacy of the tyrant, because he refused to obey the command to let
the people go. Moreover, since this denunciation was very severe, and
might very greatly awaken the tyrant’s wrath, therefore Moses is thus
early commanded to prepare himself lest he should fail in this
particular.

had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and
worshipped.

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p17"></span>**31.** Et credidit populus: quia
audierunt quod visitasset Jehova filios Israel, et quod respexisset
afflictionem eorum: et se incurvando adoraverunt.

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p18"></span><span id="iv.iv.iv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p19"></span>**24.** *And it came to pass by the way.*
The expression, “the Lord met him,” is here used in a bad sense, for an
adverse meeting, or hostile encounter; as though Moses should say that
the hand of the Lord was against him to interrupt his journey. In what
form He appeared we know not, except that the words pretty plainly imply
that Moses was assured of His anger, so as to be aware that his death
was near. For had he not been instructed by revelation or by an angel,
it would not have at all profited him to be shewn the impending danger.
Nevertheless the cause is not expressed for which he perceived that God
was so angry with him; except that we may gather it from what follows.
For why should Zipporah have taken a sharp stone or knife and
circumcised her son, had she not known that God was offended at his
uncircumcision? Certain Rabbins, then, are unwise in their conjecture,
that Moses had provoked God’s vengeance on this occasion against
himself, because he took his wife and children with him as being a
useless charge, which would be likely to encumber him. They pronounce
also, too boldly, on the nature of his scourge, viz., that he was
afflicted by a severe disease, which endangered his life. Be it
sufficient for us to know that he was terrified by the approach of
certain destruction, and that, at the same time, the cause of his
affliction was shewn him, so that he hastened to seek for a remedy. For,
as we have just said, it would never have otherwise occurred to himself
or his wife to circumcise the child to appease God’s wrath; and it will
appear a little further on, that God was, as it were, propitiated by
this offering, since he withdrew his hand, and took away the tokens of
his wrath. I therefore unhesitatingly conclude, that vengeance was
declared against Moses for his negligence, which was connected with
still heavier sins; for he had not omitted his son’s circumcision from
forgetfulness, or ignorance, or carelessness only, but because he was
aware that it was disagreeable either to his wife or to his
father-in-law. Therefore, lest. his wife should quarrel with him, or his
father-in-law trouble him, he preferred to gratify them than to give
occasion for divisions, or enmity, or disturbance. In the meantime,
however, for the sake of the favour of men he neglected to obey God.
This false dealing was no light offense, since nothing is more
intolerable than to defraud God of his due obedience, in order to please
men. There was a mixture too of distrust and ingratitude in it; for, if
the favour of God had had its due weight, he would have been withholden
by no fear from this pious duty. Let us then learn from hence to use
reverently the sacraments, which are the seals of God’s grace, lest he
should severely avenge our despisal of them; and at the same time we
should remember that the external profession of piety, and the worship
of God is a sacrifice so pleasant to God, that he will not allow us to
omit the care of diligently testifying it as if it were a matter of
small importance. Not that he cares for the ceremonies themselves, but
because he would have honor paid to the pledges of his grace, in
proportion to the benefit which is received from them. On this account
Paul bears witness, that a pestilence raged among the Corinthians when
the Lord’s supper was profaned, (<span id="iv.iv.iv-p19.1"></span>[1Co
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iv-p19.1"></span>;) because it was an act of impiety that so
precious a treasure should be lightly esteemed. But it is worthy of
observation, that whereas Moses had two sons with him, mention is here
only made of one; from whence is deduced the probable conjecture that
one of the two was circumcised.  <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md)
Some think that Eliezer, the eldest, was not so, because Moses had not
dared to confess his religion so soon, and to awaken hatred on account
of it. But I should rather imagine that when, in regard to one he had
experienced the hostility of his family, he omitted it in the case of
the second, to avoid the anger of his wife or his father-in-law; for if,
in the lapse of time, he had attained more courage, he would not have
hesitated to correct the former omission; but, worn out by domestic
quarrels, he at last departed from his duty. By this example we are
warned that we have daily need of God’s help to support our strength,
lest our courage should fail us, and our zeal should gradually grow cold
or luke-warm; for Satan is constantly devising many temptations, by
which he may either destroy or lessen our diligence. Therefore,
whosoever desires to approve himself to God in the whole course of his
life, must prepare the armor and the strength for enduring this contest;
for if Moses was deficient in perseverance, we shall be equally, or even
more liable to the same failure, unless the Lord uphold us by his
Spirit.

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p21"></span><span id="iv.iv.iv-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p22"></span>**25.** *Then Zipporah took a sharp
stone.* Because the wife here improperly assumed this office, some of
the Rabbins conjecture that this was done in the absence of her husband;
but the context contradicts them; and therefore I doubt not but that she
seized hold of a knife or a stone hastily, as is common in times of fear
and confusion. For fear had so affected her mind, that she did not act
with consideration. Moses, too, might have lain incapable in his
anxiety. Certainly the child was not duly circumcised; and still it is
plain from the event, that the ceremony thus rashly performed pleased
God; for it is immediately added, that “He let him go.” For thus I
interpret it, that the scourge of God ceased or was removed, because he
was pacified by the repentance both of Moses and of Zipporah, although
it was improper  <span id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) in itself; not
that imperfect obedience is pleasing to God absolutely, but relatively,
through indulgence, it is sometimes approved. Thus punishment was
remitted in the case of wicked Ahab, when for a season he was humbled,
on account of his hypocritical tears. (<span
id="iv.iv.iv-p23.1"></span>[1Ki
21:29](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iv.iv-p23.1"></span>.) When, therefore, Zipporah, who had opposed
her husband, circumcised her son with her own hands, although she had
not yet seriously repented, yet God was contented with the suppression
of her pride, so as to cease from afflicting Moses. Still we must not
take this as an example, as if, by manifesting the signs of repentance,
hypocrites would always find God merciful; but rather he sometimes
graciously pardons the unworthy, as far as the infliction of punishment
goes, that, by this kindness, he may invite us to true and sincere
repentance. Let us conclude, then, that the confusion of Zipporah, and
the stupor of Moses were pardoned; whilst she rashly hastened to
circumcise her son, not out of presumption, but yielding to the fears of
destruction threatened by God. Thus  <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) their folly is confuted who wish to
obtain a color for baptism by women from this passage; for they contend
that if infants be in danger of death, they may be properly baptized by
women, because Zipporah circumcised her son. But they will themselves
allow that, if a man be present, a woman could not lawfully administer
this sacrament. It is a perversion, then, to lay down a rule from a
confused and hasty act.

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p25"></span>**25.** *And cast it at his feet.* <span
id="iv.iv.iv-p25.1"></span>The word <span
id="iv.iv.iv-p25.2"></span>נגע<span id="iv.iv.iv-p25.3"></span>,
*negang*<span id="iv.iv.iv-p25.4"></span>, which some construe “she
held,” is more properly taken transitively. For although, in some
degree, as necessity compelled, Zipporah submitted herself to God, yet,
aroused to violent anger, she turns against her husband, and fiercely
reproaches him with being “a <span id="iv.iv.iv-p25.5"></span>bloody
husband.” Hence we perceive how far she was from a pious disposition to
obey; since she thus furiously attacks her husband, and vents her wrath
on him, on no other account but that God had extorted from her the
circumcision of her son. Some think that she spoke this to her son, from
an impulse of maternal grief or pity; but they wrest the words too
violently; and it is better to keep to the natural meaning, viz., that
she expostulated with her husband, because she had redeemed his life by
the loss of her child’s blood.

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p26"></span><span id="iv.iv.iv-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p27"></span>**27.** *And the Lord said to Aaron.*
When, from the long lapse of time, Aaron must have supposed that his
brother had died in exile, he now receives the joyful announcement, from
the mouth of God, that he is alive; and not only so, but he is excited
with the hope of His special favor; for, although God does not explain
in detail what he had decreed to do and prepared, yet, by his
revelation, he promises him something unusual and unexpected. But the
brevity of the command is remarkable, for God says not a word of the
deliverance, but desires him to be the disciple of his younger brother;
and although, by his promptitude, he manifested the greatest zeal and
anxiety to obey, still he is not put on an equality with Moses, who is
slow, and dubious, and vacillating, and almost supine; but he is
commanded to learn of him the design of God. Only, lest he should
question his own and his brother’s vocation, he is instructed by a
divine vision, that God is the author of the whole transaction, which
serves as a recommendation of the verbal information he is to receive.
For although Aaron was the messenger of God, and the organ of the Holy
Spirit, we still see that he was not exempt from the usual condition to
which we are subjected, of hearing God’s word at the mouth of man. If,
then, there are any who object to be taught by the medium of man’s
voice, they are not worthy of having God as their Teacher and Master;
for it is soon after added, that Moses related all that was commanded
him, as well as the great power which had been delegated to him of
working miracles. But Aaron himself, although the elder, not only paid
honor to his brother, whom he knew to be a Prophet of the Lord; but
willingly submitted himself to him as to an angel. The kiss is mentioned
as a sign of recognition, by which he testified the firmness of his
faith.

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p28"></span><span id="iv.iv.iv-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p29"></span>**29.** *And Moses and Aaron went.* We
are here briefly told how faithfully and religiously the two brothers
executed the commands of God. They gather together the elders of the
people, because the mighty multitude, as we are told they were, could
not be collected in one place. Besides, God wished not to contend by
means of the tumultuous and confused clamor of a mob, but with the
miracles, which calmly breathed forth his divine power. But it is again
worthy of observation, that Aaron is substituted to speak in the place
of Moses. For if slowness of speech prevented Moses from doing so, why
is not God’s discourse directed to Aaron? Wherefore is this circuitous
proceeding, that he promulgates to the people not what he himself heard
directly, but received indirectly through his brother, except that this
mode is agreeable to God for the purpose of proving their faith? For
while by this proof the humility and modesty of Aaron were exhibited,
since he objected not to depend on his brother’s mouth, so also the
tractableness of the elders appears in suffering the commands of God to
be thus passed to them from hand to hand, and in not scrupulously
inquiring why God did not directly address themselves, or thunder from
on high. They were,  <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) however, aided
by the miracles, because they were so stupified by their miseries that
otherwise simple preaching would have had no weight with them.

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p31"></span><span id="iv.iv.iv-p31.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iv.iv-p32"></span>**31.** *And the people believed.* Either
this is a *synecdoche*, a part of the people being put for the whole, or
else Moses signifies that after the announcement was published, all with
one consent embraced the message of their deliverance. I prefer the
former meaning; because their solemn adoration is immediately subjoined,
which could only have taken place in a public assembly. But we shall
presently see how fickle and infirm was their belief. It is plain, from
its levity and inconstancy, that it was without any living root. But it
is not unusual that the word belief should be improperly applied to a
mere assent and disposition to believe, which speedily passes away. Thus
Christ (<span id="iv.iv.iv-p32.1"></span>[Mr
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#015)<span id="iv.iv.iv-p32.1"></span>.md)
speaks of the faith of many as transient. “The people,” therefore,
“believed,” when they heard that their afflictions were regarded by God,
since that statement carried with it credibility and authority; but it
was such belief as might be dissipated by the first adverse wind; and
so, indeed, it happened. This passage, then, teaches, that theirs is no
great attainment, and that they are deserving of no great praise, who
eagerly and joyfully receive what is propounded to them in God’s name,
unless faith, being deeply rooted in their hearts, sustains itself
boldly against the assaults of temptation. Some connect the clauses
differently,  <span id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) “The people believed;
and when they heard that assistance in their calamities awaited them,
gave thanks to God.” But the *copula* is here rightly resolved into the
*expositive particle*, and the sense is — “When the people had heard
what Aaron reported, they believed.” God’s visiting them here expresses
the actual occurrence, viz., that God was willing to render them aid in
their sore distress. Their “worshipping” was in token of their
gratitude, because it was not enough for them privately and individually
to reflect on the favor of God, unless they also openly manifested their
religious feeling; not as if God greatly requires outward ceremonies,
but because they are useful supports to our infirmity, and it is right,
that not the mind only, but the body also, should be employed in the
service of God.
