<span id="iv.xviii.i"></span>

18:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.xviii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p2"></span>**1.** When Jethro, the priest of
Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses,
and for Israel his people, *and* that the Lord had brought Israel out of
Egypt;

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Audivit autem Jethro sacerdos
Midian, socer Mosis, omnia quae fecerat Jehova Mosi, et Israeli populo
suo: nempe quod eduxisset Jehova Israelem ex Aegypto.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p4"></span>**2.** Then Jethro, Moses’
father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back,

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Tulit ergo Jethro socer Mosis
uxorem Mosis, postquam miserat eam,

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p6"></span>**3.** And her two sons; of which the
name of the one *was* Getshorn; for he said, I have been an alien in a
strange land:

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Duos quoque filios ejus: quorum
nomen unius erat Gerson: quia dixerat, Peregrinus fui in terra aliena.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p8"></span>**4.** And the name of the other *was*
Eliezer; for the God of my father, *said he*, was mine help, and
delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Nomen vero secundi Eliezer: quia
Deus patris mei in auxilium meum, et eripuit me gladio Pharaonis.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p10"></span>**5.** And Jethro, Moses’
father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the
wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Venit itaque Jethro socer Mosis,
et filii ejus, et uxor ejus ad Mosen in desertum, ubi castra fixerat
prope montem Dei.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p12"></span>**6.** And he said unto Moses, I thy
father-in-law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons
with her.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et dixit ad Mosen, Ego socer
tuus Jethro venio ad te, et uxor tua, et duo filii ejus cum ea.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p14"></span>**7.** And Moses went out to meet his
father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each
other of their welfare: and they came into the tent.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Egressus autem Moses in occursum
soceri sui, incurvavit se atque osculatus est eum: et interrogavit alter
alterum de pace, veneruntque in tabernaculum.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p16"></span>**8.** And Moses told his father-in-law
all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians, for
Israel’s sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way,
and how the Lord delivered them.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et narravit Moses socero suo
quaecunque fecerat Jehova Pharaoni et AEgyptiis propter Israel, et omnem
molestiam quae invenerat eos in itinere, unde liberaverat eos Jehova.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p18"></span>**9.** And Jethro rejoiced for all the
goodness which the Lord had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of
the hand of the Egyptians.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Et laetatus est Jethro, super
omni beneficentia quam exercuerat Jehova erga Israelem qui liberaverat
eum e manu Pharaonis.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p20"></span>**10.** And Jethro said, Blessed be the
Lord, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out
of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the people from under the
hand of the Egyptians.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Et ait Jethro, Benedictus
Jehova, qui liberavit vos e manu Aegyptiorum, et e manu Pharaonis, qui
liberavit populum e subjectione manus Aegyptiorum.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p22"></span>**11.** Now I know that the Lord is
greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he
was above them.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Nunc cognosco quod magnus
Jehova prae omnibus diis: quia secundum rationem qua superbe egerunt
contra eos.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p24"></span>**12.** And Jethro, Moses’
father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron
came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’
father-in-law before God.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et accepit Jethro socer Mosis
holocaustum et sacrificia ad Deum. Venitque Aharon et omnes seniores
Israel ad coinedendum panem cum socero Mosis coram Deo.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p26"></span><span id="iv.xviii.i-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p27"></span>**1.** *When Jethro, the priest of
Midian.* This chapter consists of two parts. First of all, the arrival
of Jethro in the camp is related, and his congratulation of Moses on
account of the prosperity of his enterprise, together with the praise
and sacrifice rendered to God. Secondly, his proposed form of government
for the people is set forth, in consequence of which judges and rulers
were chosen, lest Moses should sink under his heavy task. The greater
number of commentators think that Zipporah, having been enraged on
account of her son’s circumcision, had turned back on their journey, and
gone to live with her father; but to me this does not seem probable. For
Moses would never have allowed his sons to be deprived of the redemption
of which he was the minister; nor would it have been consistent that
they should afterwards be appointed priests, of whom God was not the
Redeemer. Besides, if he had deposited his wife and children in safety,
and had advanced alone to the contest, he would have been deservedly
suspected of deceit, or of excessive cowardice. Wherefore I have no
doubt but that he underwent, together with his family, that miserable
yoke of bondage by which they were long oppressed, and by this proof
evidenced his faithfulness, so that greater authority might attend his
vocation. The statement, then, in the second verse, “after he had sent
her back,” I apply to Moses, because he had sent back his wife from the
wilderness to visit her father, either having yielded to the desire
which was natural to her as a woman, or, induced by his own feelings of
piety, he had wished to show respect in this way to an old man nearly
connected with him. There is something forced and cold in the words,
which some would supply, “after he had sent back gifts.” The text runs
very well thus, After Moses had sent back his wife, she was brought
again by his father-in-law, thus returning and repaying his kindness.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p28"></span><span id="iv.xviii.i-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p29"></span>**3.** *And her two sons.* It was
remarked in its proper place, how distinguished a proof not only of
faith, but of magnanimity and firmness Moses had manifested in giving
these names to his sons. For we cannot doubt, but that he brought on
himself the ill-will of his connections, as if he despised the country
of his wife, by calling the one (Gershom) “a strange land;” and the name
of his son continually cried out, that though he inhabited Midian, yet
was he an alien in his heart, and though sojourning for a time, would
afterwards seek another habitation. Whence also we may conjecture that
he took them with him into Egypt, rather than banish from him these two
pledges of his piety on account of the sudden anger and reproaches of
his wife; since by their names he was daily reminded that God’s covenant
was to be, preferred to all earthly advantages.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p30"></span><span id="iv.xviii.i-p30.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p31"></span>**5.** *And Jethro, Moses’
father-in-law.* It was not so much love for Moses as the fame of the
miracles which drew this old man,  <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) bowed down with age, from his home
into the wilderness; for it will hereafter appear from the context, that
he was not induced by ambition; because, after he had offered sacrifice
to God, and, in solemn thanksgiving, had testified that he ascribed all
the glory to God alone, he returned home again with the same simplicity
in which he had come. Moses, too, at the beginning of the chapter, has
stated the cause of his coming, for he does not say that he had heard of
the arrival of his son-in-law, but how wonderful had been God’s goodness
and power in delivering Moses and the people. He desired, therefore, to
be in some measure a spectator of the things whereof he had heard, and
not to neglect, by remaining at home, such illustrious instances of
God’s bounty. I have already explained why Mount Horeb is distinguished
by the name of “the Mount of God.” The vision, indeed, which had been
already vouchsafed to Moses there, rendered it worthy of this honorable
title; but here, as before, there is reference made rather to the
promulgation of the Law, whereby God consecrated the mountain to
Himself.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p33"></span><span id="iv.xviii.i-p33.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p34"></span>**7.** *And Moses went out.* In the
foregoing verse he had related what happened last, viz., that Jethro
said, I am come, and have brought to thee thy wife and children; but
this transposition is common in Hebrew. Now, then, he adds, that Moses
went to meet him, and to pay him honor; and that they met each other
with mutual kindness, and respectively performed the duties of
affection. “To ask each other of their peace,”  <span
id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) is tantamount to inquiring whether
things were well and prospering. But the main point is, that Moses told
him how gracious God had been to His people; for this was the drift of
the whole of his address, that, when he had left his father-in-law, he
had not yielded to the impulse of lightness, but had obeyed the call of
God, as had afterwards been proved by His extraordinary aids and by
heavenly prodigies.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p36"></span><span id="iv.xviii.i-p36.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p37"></span>**10.** *And Jethro said, Blessed.*
Hence it appears that although the worship of God was then everywhere
profaned by strange additions, yet Jethro was not so devoted to
superstition as not to acknowledge and honor the true God. Nevertheless,
the comparison which he subjoins, that “Jehovah is greater than all
gods,” implies that he was not pure and free from all error. For,
although the Prophets often so speak, it is with a different import; for
sometimes God is exalted above the angels, that His sole eminence may
appear, every heavenly dignity being reduced to its due order;
sometimes, too, He is improperly called “Greater,” not as if the false
gods had any rank, but that the greatness which is falsely and foolishly
attributed to them in the world may be brought to naught. But Jethro
here imagines, in accordance with the common notion, that a multitude of
inferior gods are in subordination to the Most High. Thus, where the
pure truth of God does not shine, religion is never uncorrupt and clear,
but always has some dregs mixed with it. At the same time, Jethro seems
to have made some advance; for in affirming that he now knows the power
of God, he implies that he was more rightly informed than before;
unless, perhaps, it might be preferred to understand this of the
experimental knowledge, which confirms even believers, so that they more
willingly submit themselves to God, whom they already knew before.
Meanwhile, there is no doubt that by the name of Jehovah he designates
the God of Israel; for, although they boasted everywhere that they
worshipped the eternal God, yet by asserting the true Deity of the One
God, he puts all others beneath Him. At any rate he confesses that, by
the history of their deliverance, he was assured of the immense power of
God, who had manifested himself in Israel; so as to despise, in
comparison with Him, whatever gods were honored elsewhere in the world.
The latter clause  <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196) of verse (11.md)
is unfinished; for it stands thus, “According to the word (or reason)
wherein they dealt proudly against them;” thus the principal verb is
wanting to express that God repaid the Egyptians the just wages of their
cruelty; just as He denounces “judgment without mercy,” upon all who
proudly and unmercifully mistreat their neighbors, (<span
id="iv.xviii.i-p38.1"></span>[Jas
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.xviii.i-p38.1"></span>,) according to the declaration of our Lord
Jesus Christ, “With what measure ye mete,” etc. (<span
id="iv.xviii.i-p38.2"></span>[Mt
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.xviii.i-p38.2"></span>.) The exposition which some give seems too
limited, viz., that the Egyptians, who had drowned the infants in the
river, were themselves drowned in the Red Sea. I prefer, then, to extend
it to every instance of punishment which they received.

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p39"></span><span id="iv.xviii.i-p39.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.i-p40"></span>**12.** *And Jethro.* Although I do not
think that Jethro had previously sacrificed to idols, yet, because he
worshipped an unknown God, with but a confused and clouded faith, it
appears that this was his first sincere and legitimate sacrifice since
the God of Israel had been more clearly known to him. We may gather from
hence that it was duly offered, because Moses, and Aaron, and the elders
openly professed them. selves his companions, and partook with him; for
it is not merely said that they came to eat bread with him, but “before
God;” which expression describes a sacred and solemn feast, a part and
adjunct of the offering and divine worship. But they never would have
willingly polluted themselves with the defilement’s of the Gentiles for
the sake of gratifying an unholy man. It follows, then, that this was a
token of his piety, since they did not hesitate to become partakers with
him. We ought, indeed, to have God before our eyes, as often as we
partake of his bounty; but we shall hereafter see, that this expression
is peculiarly applied to sacrifices, wherein the faithful put themselves
in the presence of God. Yet. do I not admit that Jethro slew the victims
in right of the priesthood which he exercised in the land of Midian; but
because there was more liberty, as will be explained in its place,
before the Law was prescribed by God. It is my decided opinion that by
the word “bread,” the manna is incontestably meant.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p1"></span><span
id="iv.xviii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
18:13-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#013.md)<span
id="iv.xviii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p2"></span>**13.** And it came to pass on the
morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by
Moses from the morning unto the evening.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p3"></span>**13.** Accidit autem postridie ut
sederet Moses ad judicandum populum: stabatque populus juxta Mosen a
mane usque ad vesperum.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p4"></span>**14.** And when Moses’ father-in-law
saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou
doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people
stand by thee from morning unto even?

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p5"></span>**14.** Et videns socer Mosis omnia
quae faciebat ipse erga populum, dixit, Quid est quod tu facis populo?
quare tu sedes solus, et universus populus stat juxta te a mane usque ad
vesperum.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p6"></span>**15.** And Moses said unto his
father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p7"></span>**15.** Et respondit Moses socero suo,
Quia venit populus ad me ad quaerendum Deum.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p8"></span>**16.** When they have a matter, they
come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them
know the statutes of God, and his laws.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p9"></span>**16.** Quum est illis negotium,
veniunt ad me, et ego judico inter quemque et proximum ejus, et ostendo
statuta Dei et leges ejus.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p10"></span>**17.** And Moses’ father-in-law said
unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p11"></span>**17.** Tunc dixit socer Mosis ad eum,
Non est bonum quod tu facis.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p12"></span>**18.** Thou wilt surely wear away,
both thou and this people that is with thee; for this thing is too heavy
for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p13"></span>**18.** Deficiendo deficies tam tu
quam populus iste qui tecum est: Nam haec res gravis est supra tuas
vires: non poteris ergo praestare solus.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p14"></span>**19.** Hearken now unto my voice, I
will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the
people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God;

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p15"></span>**19.** Nunc audi vocem meam:
consilium tibi dabo, et erit Deus tecum. Esto tu pro populo coram Deo,
ut referas causas ad Deum.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p16"></span>**20.** And thou shalt teach them
ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk,
and the work that they must do.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p17"></span>**20.** Docebisque eos statuta et
leges, et ostendes eis viam in qua ambulent, et opus quod faciant.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p18"></span>**21.** Moreover, thou shalt provide
out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating
covetousness, and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and
rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p19"></span>**21.** Tu autem deliges ex toto
populo viros fortes, timentes Deum, viros veraces, qui oderint
avaritiam: praeficiesque eis tribunos, centuriones, quinquagenarios, et
decanos.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p20"></span>**22.** And let them judge the people
at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall
bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be
easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p21"></span>**22.** Qui judicent populum omni
tempore: si autem acciderit negotium magnum, ad te referent, omnem vero
leviorem causam judicabunt ipsi: et tibi levius erit onus, quia
sufferent ipsi tecum.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p22"></span>**23.** If thou shalt do this thing,
and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this
people shall also go to their place in peace.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p23"></span>**23.** Si hoc feceris, et praeceperit
tibi Deus, poteris stare: atque etiam populus hic ad locum suum veniet
in pace.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p24"></span>**24.** So Moses hearkened to the
voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p25"></span>**24.** Obedivit Moses voci soceri
sui: et fecit omnia quae ille dixerat.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p26"></span>**25.** And Moses chose able men out
of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands,
rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p27"></span>**25.** Et elegit Moses viros fortes
ex toto Israel, et constituit eos capita super populum, principes super
mille centuriones, quinquagenarios, ac decanos.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p28"></span>**26.** And they judged the people at
all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small
matter they judged themselves.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p29"></span>**26.** Qui judicabant populum omni
tempore, ardua referebant ad Mosen: omnem vero rem parvam judicabant
ipsi.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p30"></span>**27.** And Moses let his
father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p31"></span>**27.** Dimisit autem Moses socerum
suum, et abiit ad terram suam.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p32"></span><span id="iv.xviii.ii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p33"></span>**13.** *And it came to pass.* <span
id="iv.xviii.ii-p33.1"></span>A memorable circumstance, and one well
worth knowing, is here introduced. In that form of government over which
God presided, and which He honored with extraordinary manifestations of
His glory, there was something deserving of reprehension, which Jethro
corrected; and again, Moses himself, the mighty Prophet, and with whom
alone God was thus familiar, was deservedly reproved for inconsiderately
wearing away both himself and the people by excessive labor. It was a
proof of his illustrious virtue and mental heroism to undergo so many
troubles, to endure so much fatigue, and not to be subdued by weariness
from daily exposing himself to new toils. It betrayed also a magnanimity
never sufficiently to be praised, that he should occupy himself
gratuitously for this perverse and wicked people, and never desist from
his purpose, although he experienced an unworthy return for his kind
efforts. For we have seen him to have been often assailed by reproaches
and contumelies, and assaulted by chidings and threats; so that it is
more than marvelous that his patience, so constantly abused, was not
altogether worn out. In this, assuredly, many virtues will be discovered
worthy of the highest praise; yet Jethro in these very praises finds
occasion of fault. Whence we are warned that in all the most excellent
acts of men some defect is ever lurking, and that scarcely any exists so
perfect in every respect as to be free from any stain. Let all those,
then, who are called on to be rulers of mankind know, that however
diligently they may exercise their office, something still may be
wanting, if the best plan that they adopt be brought to examination.
Therefore let all, whether kings or magistrates, or pastors of the
Church, know, that whilst they strain every nerve to fulfill their
duties, something will always remain which may admit of correction and
improvement. Here, too, it is worth while to remark, that no single
mortal can be sufficient to do everything, however many and various may
be the endowments wherein he excels. For who shall equal Moses, whom we
have still seen to be unequal to the burden, when he undertook the whole
care of governing the people? Let, then, God’s servants learn to measure
carefully their powers, lest they should wear out, by ambitiously
embracing too many occupations. For this propensity to engage in too
many things (<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p33.2"></span>πολυπραγμοσύνη<span
id="iv.xviii.ii-p33.3"></span>) is a very common malady, and numbers are
so carried away by it as not to be easily restrained. In order,
therefore, that every one should confine himself within his own bounds,
let us learn that in the human race God has so arranged our condition,
that individuals are only endued with a certain measure of gifts, on
which the distribution of offices depends. For as one ray of the sun
does not illuminate the world, but all combine their operations as it
were in one; so God, that He may retain men by a sacred and indissoluble
bond in mutual society and good-will, unites one to another by variously
dispensing His gifts, and not raising up any out of measure by his
entire perfection. Therefore Augustine  <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) <span
id="iv.xviii.ii-p34.1"></span>truly says that, God humbled His servant
by this act; just as Paul reports, that buffetings were inflicted on him
by the messenger of Satan, lest the grandeur of his revelations should
exalt him too highly. (<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p34.2"></span>[2Co
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.xviii.ii-p34.2"></span><span id="iv.xviii.ii-p34.3"></span>.)

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p35"></span><span id="iv.xviii.ii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p36"></span>**15.** *And Moses said unto his
father-in-law.* Moses replies ingenuously, as if on a very praiseworthy
matter, like one unconscious of any fault; for he declared himself to be
the minister of God, and the organ of His Spirit. Nor, indeed, could his
faithfulness and integrity be called in question. He only erred in
overwhelming himself with too much labor, and not considering himself
privately, nor all the rest publicly. Yet a useful lesson may be
gathered from his words. He says that disputants come “to inquire of
God,” and that he makes them to know the statutes of God and His laws.
Hence it follows that this is the object of political government, that
God’s tribunal should be erected on earth, wherein He may exercise the
judge’s office, to the end that judges and magistrates should not
arrogate to themselves a power uncontrolled by any laws, nor allow
themselves to decide anything arbitrarily or wantonly, nor, in a word,
assume to themselves what belongs to God. Then, and then only, will
magistrates acquit themselves properly:. when they remember that they
are the representatives (*vicarios*) of God. An obligation is here also
imposed upon all private individuals, that they should not rashly appeal
to the authority or assistance of judges, but should approach them with
pure hearts, as if inquiring of God; for whosoever desires anything else
except to learn from the mouth of the magistrate what is right and just,
boldly and sacrilegiously violates the place which is dedicated to God.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p37"></span><span id="iv.xviii.ii-p37.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p38"></span>**17.** *And Moses’ father-in-law
said.* He does not absolutely condemn the whole system which Moses had
before adopted, after the manner of morose, or froward, or ambitious men
who, by carping at some trifle, obscure the noble deeds of others; but
by seeking only to correct a part of it, he detracts not from the just
praise of Moses, and leaves the power which God had conferred upon him
untouched. Herein his moderation is worth observing, for he does not
abuse this pretext of a particular error, so as to upset the due order
of things; but only advises Moses how he may usefully execute the office
which God had conferred upon him.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p39"></span><span id="iv.xviii.ii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p40"></span>**19.** *I will give thee counsel.*
Jethro dares, indeed, to promise success, if Moses will obey his
counsel; yet does he not proudly boast that this will be the fruit of
his own prudence, but ascribes it to God’s blessing and grace, if he
prospers even when nothing is established but on the best system. For
this is the import of the expression, that a counsel occurs to him,
which if Moses follows, God shall bless him. Nor yet does he reprove
Moses, as if God had not been thus far with his pious zeal and industry,
but rather hints that God is the author of this counsel, which He will
follow up with His grace. In sum, he does not state it to be his Object
to diminish in the smallest degree the grace which Moses had already
experienced; but to point out a plan, of which God will, by its result,
show His approbation. Then follows the other point to which I have
alluded, viz., that he does not rob Moses of his authority, so as to
overturn his call from God, but rather by exhorting him to proceed,
desires that what God has once ordained should be firm and inviolable.
It is well also for us diligently to consider that counsel be taken
according to circumstances and expediency, so that there be no departure
from the ordinance of God; because it is sinful to entertain the
question whether we should obey God or not. Accursed, then, are the
deliberations wherein it is proposed to alter anything in God’s Word, or
to withdraw ourselves from the bounds of our calling. We have said that
the burden whereby Moses was weighed down was not of God’s imposing; but
only had he been set over the people as their leader, as far as his
ability permitted. Jethro leaves this unaffected, and thus confirms by
subscribing, as it were, to the decree of heaven. Because he was chosen
to be as an interpreter, and God familiarly admitted him as the mediator
between Him and His people, Jethro enjoins him to continue in the
discharge of these duties. But because the possession of the supreme
government did not interfere with the duty of a Prophet, he desired also
the greater matters to be referred to him; for I so interpret the
expressions, that Moses was to be “to God-ward,” for the delivery of the
rule of piety, and for the performance of the prophetical office, whilst
the weightier causes were to be referred by the rulers to him, that
every one might have justice done him.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p41"></span><span id="iv.xviii.ii-p41.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p42"></span>**21.** *Moreover, thou shalt*  <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) *provide out of all the people*
Literally so, “thou shalt provide;” meaning, thou shalt choose out, and
take the most worthy, so that such an office be not entrusted rashly to
any one that offers. But this was most reasonable, among a free people,
that the judges should not be chosen for their wealth or rank, but for
their superiority in virtue. Yet although it be right that regard should
be chiefly had to virtue, so that if any one of the lower orders be
found more suitable than others, he should be preferred to the noble or
the rich; still should any one choose to, lay this down as a perpetual
and necessary rule, he will be justly accounted contentious. Jethro
enumerates four qualifications which must be principally regarded in the
appointment of judges, viz., ability in business, the fear of God,
integrity, and the contempt, of riches, not to exclude others whereof,
as we shall soon see, mention is made in the first chapter of
Deuteronomy, but to signify that all are not qualified, nay, that
extraordinary virtues are required which, by synecdoche, he embraces in
these four. The words which we translate “brave men,”  <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199) (*viros fortes*,.md) are, in the Hebrew,
“men of bravery,” (*viros fortitudinis*;) by which title some think that
strong and laborious men are described. But in my opinion, Moses rather
designates strenuous and courageous persons, whom he opposes not only to
the inactive, but to the timid and cowardly also. But because vigor of
mind as well as of body is but frail without the fear of God, he adds
piety in the second place, in that they should exercise their office as
having an account to render to God. “Truth” is opposed not only to
deception and gross falsehoods, but to popularity-hunting, flattering
promises, and other crooked arts, which tend to corrupt justice. Lastly,
hatred of covetousness is demanded; because nothing is more antagonistic
to justice than eagerness for gain; and since snares are so constantly
set for judges by the offers of pecuniary advantage, they would not be
duly fortified against this mode of corruption, unless they earnestly
detested avarice.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p45"></span><span id="iv.xviii.ii-p45.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p46"></span>**23.** *If thou shalt do this thing.*
What immediately follows, “and God command thee so,” may be taken in
connection with the beginning of the verse, as if, in self-correction,
Jethro made the limitation, that he did not wish his counsel to be
obeyed, unless God should approve of it. Others extend it more widely,
that if Moses followed God’s commands in all things, this moderation of
his duties would be useful. However you take it, Jethro declares that he
would have nothing conceded to him, which should derogate from God’s
supreme authority; but that there was nothing to prevent Moses from
following, as he had done, God as his leader, and still adopting the
proposed plan. Yet he signifies that this was to be but temporary, when
he adds, that the people should go in peace or prosperously into the
land of Canaan. Jethro, then, had no wish to establish a law for
posterity; but points out a remedy for present inconveniences, and a
provisional arrangement,  <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) until
the people should obtain a peaceful resting-place.

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p48"></span><span id="iv.xviii.ii-p48.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.ii-p49"></span>**24.** *So Moses hearkened.* Here is
a. remarkable instance of modesty, that Moses is not indisposed to
submit himself to the counsel of his father-in-law. For although Jethro
was his superior in age and in degree of affinity, in other respects he
was far inferior to him. This yielding, then, of Moses to his authority,
lays down a rule for all the greatest and most excellent Doctors, that
they should not refuse lo receive the admonitions of those whom they
admit to teach rightly, although they are not of such high dignity. For
Cyprian  <span id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) truly declares that
none is a good doctor who is not also docile. It is probable that the
old man immediately returned home, not in contempt, or from his dislike
to labor or fatigue, but  <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md) on
account of his age; but we shall hereafter see in its proper place that
his son remained in the camp.

that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge
righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p19"></span>**16.** Atque praecepi judicibus

juste inter virum et fratrem suum, et inter peregrinum ejus.

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p20"></span>**17.** Ye shall not respect persons
in judgment, but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall
not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God’s: and the
cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p21"></span>**17.** Non agnoscetis faciem in ipso

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p22"></span>**18.** And I commanded you at that
time all the things which ye should do.

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p23"></span>**18.** Praecepique vobis tempore
illo onmia quae facere deberetis.

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p24"></span><span id="iv.xviii.iii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p25"></span>**9.** *And I spoke unto you at that
time.* He does not here say that the counsel was suggested to him from
another quarter, as to the appointment of the judges; but, perhaps, he
dared not mention any name to these proud and perverse people, lest they
should reject the thing which was otherwise good, from dislike of its
author, as a foreigner. No doubt he is here recounting what had before
happened; therefore he confesses himself, from his own personal
feelings, unequal to bearing the burden, if he alone is set over the
whole people. He adduces as the cause the immense multitude amongst whom
there must necessarily arise many strifes and controversies. As to what
he says of their increase, the commencement of its period must not be
taken from the Exodus, but he commemorates the extraordinary and
incredible favor of God, because they had so largely multiplied under
the cruel tyranny when they were doomed to total destruction; and he
adds a prayer, that for the future also the same blessing may attend
them. Yet in these words he reminds them that the burden of government
would become daily more arduous and weighty; whereby he may more readily
persuade them to provide at once for what could not be eventually
avoided.

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p26"></span><span id="iv.xviii.iii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p27"></span>**13.** *Take you wise men.* Hence it
more plainly appears that those who were to preside in judgment were not
appointed only by the will of Moses, but. elected by the votes of the
people. And this is the most desirable kind c f liberty, that we should
not be compelled to obey every’ person who may be tyrannically put over
our heads; but which allows of election, so that no one should rule
except he be approved of by us. And this is further confirmed in the
next verse, wherein Moses recounts that he awaited the consent of the
people, and that nothing was attempted which did not please them all.
Again, he does not here mention the same virtues as in <span
id="iv.xviii.iii-p27.1"></span>[Exodus
18](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.xviii.iii-p27.1"></span>; but only distinguishes the judges by
three qualifications, viz., that they should be wise, and understanding,
and experienced, all of which are comprised under one head, that they
should possess acuteness of intellect and prudence, confirmed by
experience and practice; for neither the greatest probity nor diligence
would be sufficient; for the office of ruler, apart from skill and
sagacity.  <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) But the first epithet
which the Hebrews often apply in a bad sense to the crafty and
deceitful, here means acute and perspicacious. The second I explain as
pointing out prudent persons, endued with sound judgment and discretion.
 <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) The third may be taken either
actively or passively; some therefore translate it known or tried; but
here the active sense is most suitable. Thus, then, experience and
acquaintance with business is required in judges; because none but the
practiced are competent for the management of business.

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p30"></span><span id="iv.xviii.iii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p31"></span>**16.** *And I charged your judges.*
This charge is not found in <span id="iv.xviii.iii-p31.1"></span>[Exodus
18](../../../bib/kjv/exo018.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.xviii.iii-p31.1"></span>, where the only object of Moses was to
point out the origin of the alteration; but now omitting the praise of
his father-in-law, he merely recalls to the recollection of the
Israelites what he did with them. The sum, however, of the exhortation
is, that they should adjudicate impartially between their brethren;
which is more fully expressed in the next verse, where they are
forbidden to “acknowledge faces.”  <span
id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) For there can be no greater corruption
than to judge from personal appearance, which always draws away men’s
minds from the merits of the ease. Wherefore Christ rightly opposes
these two things to one another, to “judge righteous judgment,” and
“according to the appearance.” (<span
id="iv.xviii.iii-p32.1"></span>[Joh
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#024.md)<span
id="iv.xviii.iii-p32.1"></span>.) This even philosophers have perceived,
when they have advised that, as far as possible, judges should be
restrained by fixed laws, lest;, being left free, they should be swayed
this way or that by favor or ill will. And, in point of fact, wherever
there is a sufficient capacity of intellect, equity and rectitude will
prevail, unless respect to persons influences the judge. It, is plain
from the context, where Moses forbids the making a distinction between
small and great, what is meant by “acknowledging persons.” But although
judges often inflict injury upon the poor and wretched out of contempt
of them, yet Moses adverts to the more common fault, when he charges
them “to be afraid of no man;” since it very often happens that those
who are otherwise just, and disposed to study what is equitable and
right, are made to swerve through fear of the threats of the powerful,
and dare not; manfully encounter their ill will. Moses, therefore,
requires magnanimity in judges, so that they may not hesitate to bring
upon themselves the hatred of any, in their defense of a good cause. But
we must specially observe the reason whereby he corrects their fear and
alarm; for he says that they are to be afraid of no mortal man, because
“the judgment is God’s.” He does not here merely remind them, as it;
appears to some, that an account must be rendered to God; but shows how
absurd it is to turn from the right course out of the fear of man,
because thus the majesty of God is prostituted and exposed to scorn; as
much as to say that this honor must be paid to God, whose
representatives they are, that they should look upon all men as beneath
them, and restrain the audacity of rite wicked with such inflexible
magnanimity, that God alone may have the preeminence. The same is the
object of Jehoshaphat’s words:

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p33"></span>“Take heed what ye do: for ye judge
not for man but for the Lord.” (<span
id="iv.xviii.iii-p33.1"></span>[2Ch
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2019.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.xviii.iii-p33.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.xviii.iii-p34"></span>If this were thoroughly impressed
upon the minds both of magistrates and pastors, they would not vacillate
so often; for relying on God’s aid, they would stand firmly against all
the terrors by which they are so pitifully agitated. Wherefore let all
those who are called to any public office, sustain themselves by this
doctrine, that they are doing God’s work, who is well able to keep them
safe from the violence as well as the craftiness of the whole world.
Yet, at the same time we are taught by these words that all posts of
command are sacred to God, so that whosoever are called to them should
reverently and diligently serve God, and ever reflect that His is the
dominion whereof they are the ministers.
