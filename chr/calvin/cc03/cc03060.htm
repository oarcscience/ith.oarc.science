For although it seems to be a simple prohibition, yet must we deduce 			 an affirmation from the negative, as will be more apparent from the following words. Therefore does He set Himself before them, in order that the Israelites may look to Him alone; and claims His own just right, in order that it may not be transferred elsewhere. All do not agree in the exposition of the words, for some construe the word <a name="vi.i-p2.3"></A>&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;<i>,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">278</FONT></A>
 			 <i> panim,</i><a name="vi.i-p3.3"></A> &#8220;anger,&#8221; <a name="vi.i-p3.4"></A>as if it were said, &#8220;Thou shalt not make to thyself other gods to provoke my anger;&#8221; <a name="vi.i-p3.5"></A>and I admit that the Hebrew word is often used in this sense. The other interpretation, however, seems to me the more correct, &#8220;Make not to thyself gods before my face.&#8221; Yet still there remains a difference of opinion, for people are not agreed 			 as to the particle <a name="vi.i-p3.6"></A>&#1506;&#1500;<a name="vi.i-p3.7"></A>, <i>gnel. </i><a name="vi.i-p3.8"></A>Some explain it, &#8220;Make <a name="vi.i-p3.9"></A>not to thyself gods <i>above </i><a name="vi.i-p3.10"></A>me, or whom thou mayest prefer to me;&#8221; <a name="vi.i-p3.11"></A>and they quote the passage in <a name="vi.i-p3.12"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015">De 21:15-17</a><a name="vi.i-p3.12"></A><a name="vi.i-p3.13"></A>, <a name="vi.i-p3.14"></A>wherein God forbids a man, if he have two wives, and children by both, to transfer the rights of primogeniture to the second <i>before the face </i><a name="vi.i-p3.15"></A>of the first-born. But though we admit that a comparison is there made between the elder and the younger, still it would be too frigid an interpretation here 			 to say that God demands nothing more than that other gods should not obtain the higher place; whereas He neither suffers them to be likened to Him, nor even to be joined with Him as companions;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">279</FONT></A>
 			 <a name="vi.i-p4.1"></A> for religion is defiled and corrupted as soon as God&#8217;s glory is diminished in the very least degree. And we know that when the Israelites worshipped their Baalim, they did not so substitute them in the place of God as to put Him altogether aside, and assign to them the supreme power; nevertheless, this was an intolerable profanation of God&#8217;s worship, and moreover an impious transgression of this precept, <a name="vi.i-p4.2"></A>to choose 			 for themselves patrons in whom some part of the Deity should be lodged; because if God <i>have not alone </i><a name="vi.i-p4.3"></A>the pre-eminence, His majesty is so far obscured. I consider,therefore, the genuine sense to be, that the Israelites should not make to themselves any gods, whom they might oppose to the true and only God. For in Hebrew the expression, <i>before the face, </i><a name="vi.i-p4.4"></A>generally means <i>over against; </i><a name="vi.i-p4.5"></A>therefore God would not have companions obtruded upon Him, and placed as it were in His sight. Meanwhile, it seems probable to me that He alludes to that manifestation of Himself which ought to have retained His people in sincere piety; for true and pure religion was so revealed in the Law, that God&#8217;s face in a manner shone forth therein. The case was different with the Gentiles, who, although they might rashly make to themselves false gods, 			 still would not do so before the face of God, which was unknown to them. Let us then understand, after all, that those alone are accounted the legitimate worshippers of God who bid adieu to all figments, and cleave to Him alone. Nor can it be doubted that these words comprehend the inward worship of God, since this commandment differs from the next, whereby external idolatry will be seen to be condemned. It is sufficiently notorious, that men may make to themselves gods in other ways besides in 			 statues, and pictures, and in visible forms. If any should adore the angels instead of God, or should foolishly imagine any other secret divinity, none will deny that he would offend against this Law. God, therefore, calls for the affections of the heart, that He alone may be spiritually worshipped; and the expression &#8220;before my face,&#8221; may be not inaptly referred to this; because, although their impiety, who secretly turn aside to false worship, and cherish their errors within their own bosoms, 			 may be able to evade the eyes of men, yet their hypocrisy and treachery will not escape the notice of God. Hence, again, it follows, that the one God is not rightly worshipped, unless He be separated from all figments. Wherefore it is not enough to make use of His name, unless all corruptions opposed to His word be laid aside; and thence we arrive at the distinction between true religion and false superstitions; for since God has prescribed to us how He would be worshipped by us, whenever we 			 turn away in the very smallest degree from this rule, we make <a name="vi.i-p4.6"></A>to ourselves other gods, and degrade Him from His right place.</p>
