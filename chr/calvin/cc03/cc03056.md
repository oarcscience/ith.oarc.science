id="v.xxxi-p10.1"></span>.** *These are the commandments.* This first
passage commends the Law, which was promulgated and written on the two
tables, together with the declarations which were annexed to it, to
explain more fully the mind of God. For God did not only propound the
Decalogue, but also interpreted what He briefly summed up therein.
Moreover, Moses endeavors to gain their belief of this doctrine, first,
from its authority, because it was delivered by God; and secondly,
because he had not assumed the office of lawgiver, but had been
appointed by God, and called to undertake it. He demands obedience from
the children of Israel, because he had been sent to them as their
teacher and master.
