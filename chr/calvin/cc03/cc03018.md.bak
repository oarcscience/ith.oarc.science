<span id="iv.xv-p1"></span>EXODUS 15

<span id="iv.xv.i"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.xv.i-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
15:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.xv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.i-p2"></span>**1.** Then sang Moses and the children of
Israel this song unto the Lord, and spoke, saying, I will sing unto the
Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he
thrown into the sea.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p3"></span>**1.** Tunc cecinit Moses et filii Israel
canticum hoc Jehovae, et dixerunt, Cantabo Jehovae, quoniam se
magninifice extulit (Heb., magnificando magnificatus est): equum et
ascensorem ejus projecit in mare.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p4"></span>**2.** The Lord is my strength and song,
and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an
habitation; my father’s God, and I will exalt him.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p5"></span>**2.** Fortitudo mea et canticum Deus, et
fuit mihi in solutem. Hic Deus meus et decorabo eum: Deus patris mei, et
extollam eum.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p6"></span>**3.** The Lord is a man of war: the Lord
is his name.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p7"></span>**3.** Jehova vir bellicosus: Jehova nomen
ejus.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p8"></span>**4.** Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath
he east into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red
sea.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p9"></span>**4.** Currus Pharaonis et exereitum ejus
projecit in mare: et electi duces ejus demersi sunt in mari Suph.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p10"></span>**5.** The depths have covered them: they
sank into the bottom as a stone.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p11"></span>**5.** Abyssi operuerunt eos: descenderunt
in profunda, quasi lapis.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p12"></span>**6.** Thy right hand, O Lord, is become
glorious in power: thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the
enemy.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p13"></span>**6.** Dextera tua Jehova excelluit
fortitudine, dextera tua Jehova fregit inimicum.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p14"></span>**7.** And in the greatness of thine
excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou
sentest forth thy wrath, *which* consumed them as stubble.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p15"></span>**7.** Et in magnitudine magnificentiae
tuae subvertisti insurgentes contra te. Misisti furorem, consumpsit eos
quasi stipulam.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p16"></span>**8.** And with the blast of thy nostrils
the waters were gathered together, the foods stood upright as an heap,
and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et per fiatum narium tuarum
coacervatae sunt aquae, steterunt fluenta sicuti acervus: coagulatae
sunt voragines in corde maris.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p18"></span>**9.** The enemy said, I will pursue, I
will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon
them: I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p19"></span>**9.** Dixerat hostis, Persequar,
apprehendam, dividam spolia, implebitur illis anima mea, exseram
gladium, perdet eos manus mea.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p20"></span>**10.** Thou didst blow with thy wind, the
sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p21"></span>**10.** Flavisti vento tuo, operuit cos
mare, demersi sunt quasi plumbum in aquis validis.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p22"></span><span id="iv.xv.i-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.i-p23"></span>**1.** *Then sang Moses.* Moses introduced
this song not only in testimony of his gratitude, but also in
confirmation of the history; for the song which he dictated to the
Israelites was not concerning an unknown event, but he brought them
forward as eye-witnesses, that all ages might know that nothing thus far
had been written which had not openly been declared by 600,000 men,
besides their wives and children. Moses, therefore, set the example in
accordance with his office, whilst the people, by singing with him,
testified their approbation in a manner which admits of no
contradiction. For’ to whom could they have lied, since they were each
other’s witnesses, and the song was listened to by no strangers? Moses
seems to mark their confidence by the repetition in the Hebrew, they
“spoke, saying.” On this account, too, their confession, pronounced by
all their mouths, deserves more credit, because the greater part of them
soon after yielded to ingratitude: from whence we gather that it was
only on compulsion that they gave God glory. But, although Moses was the
author of the song, yet he does not say “I will sing” in his own person,
but prescribes to all what each individual ought heartily to do.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p24"></span><span id="iv.xv.i-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.i-p25"></span>**2.** *The Lord is my strength.* In this
expression they acknowledge that they have a sufficient defense in God;
and afterwards they add, that His grace furnishes them with just ground
for praise. The sum is, that they were strong in God, and had not
conquered their enemies by their own bravery; and that, therefore, it is
not lawful to glory save in God alone. But we must observe that the help
of God is conjoined with His praise, because this is the end of all His
benefits, that we should hold our salvation as received from Him, which
is here mentioned in the third place, for to say that God had “become
their salvation,” was as much as to say that the people were saved by
His grace. In the second clause there is an antithesis between the true
God and all false ones; for there is much emphasis in the declaration,
“he is my God,” as by it Moses excludes all that multitude of gods which
then were everywhere worshipped in the world. To the same effect he
adds, “my father’s God,” thus distinguishing the faith of Abraham from
all the superstitions of the Gentiles. The faithful then declare that it
is safe for them to repose in this One God, and that His praises are
worthy of celebration. Isaiah imitates this figure. <span
id="iv.xv.i-p25.1"></span>[Isa
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#009.md)<span id="iv.xv.i-p25.1"></span>,

<span id="iv.xv.i-p26"></span>“Lo, this is our God; we have waited for
him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him.”

<span id="iv.xv.i-p27"></span>What follows in the next verse — “The Lord
is a man of war,” is to the same purpose, for although at first sight
the phrase may seem a harsh one, still it is not without beauty: that
God is armed in military attire, to contend with all the forces of His
foes. Therefore, says Moses, the name of the Lord belongs to Him alone,
because His hand awaits to destroy whatever lifts itself up against Him.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p28"></span><span id="iv.xv.i-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.i-p29"></span>**4.** *Pharaoh’s chariots.* Moses in
these words only meant to assert, that the drowning of Pharaoh was
manifestly God’s work. Therefore, he now illustrates in more glowing
terms the transaction which he had before simply narrated; as also when
he compares the Egyptians to stones and lead, as if he had said that
they were hurled by God’s mighty hand into the deep, so that they had no
power to swim out. On this score, he repeats twice the mention of God’s
“right hand;” as much as to say that such a miracle could not be
ascribed either to fortune or to the efforts of man. We must take notice
of what he soon after says, that the Egyptians “rose up against” God;
because they had treated His people with injustice and cruelty. Thence
we gather, that God’s majesty is violated by the wicked, whenever His
Church, whose safety He has undertaken to preserve by His faithful
patronage, is assailed by them. “Thou sentest forth thy wrath,” and
“with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together,” are
to be read in conjunction; for their meaning is that God, without any
instrumentality, but by His simple volition, and in manifestation of His
wrath, had brought the enemy to. destruction.

<span id="iv.xv.i-p30"></span><span id="iv.xv.i-p30.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.i-p31"></span>**9.** *The enemy said.* He relates the
boast of Pharaoh not merely in exultation over him, but to magnify the
miracle, whereby God gives over to destruction this wolf intent upon his
prey. But there is more force in the language when he introduces the
Egyptians as speakers, than as if he had described their plans; for thus
does the marvelous catastrophe more strikingly affect our minds, when
the Egyptians, brought as it were on the stage, not only trumpet forth
their victory, but insolently give vent to their arrogance and cruelty.
But, presently, the Lord is introduced on the other side, dissipating by
a single blast their terrible audacity. For whence came this great
confidence to the Egyptians, promising themselves that they should be
satisfied with the spoils, and that they should have nothing more to do
in order to put the people to death than to draw their swords, but from
the fact of their being very well armed against this unwarlike
multitude? Hence, then, God’s power shone forth more brightly, when He
put them out of the way by “blowing with His wind.”

<span id="iv.xv.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.xv.ii-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
15:11-21](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p2"></span>**11.** Who *is* like unto thee, O Lord,
among the gods? who is like thee, glorious *in* holiness, fearful in
praises, doing wonders?

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p3"></span>**11.** Quis sicut tu in diis, Jehova?
quis sicut tu, magnificus in sanctitate, terribilis laudibus, faciens
mirabilia?

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p4"></span>**12.** Thou stretchedst out thy right
hand, the earth swallowed them.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p5"></span>**12.** Extendisti dexteram tuam,
deglutivit eos terra.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p6"></span>**13.** Thou in thy mercy hast led forth
the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy
strength unto thy holy habitation.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p7"></span>**13.** Duces in tua misericordia populum
hunc quem redemisti, duces in fortitudine tua ad habitaculum sanctitatis
tuae.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p8"></span>**14.** The people shall hear, and be
afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p9"></span>**14.** Audient populi et contremiscent:
dolor apprehendet habitatores Philisthim.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p10"></span>**15.** Then the dukes of Edom shall be
amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them: all
the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p11"></span>**15.** Tunc terrebuntur duces Edom, et
robusti Moab: apprehendet eos tremor, dissolventur omnes habitatores
Chanann.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p12"></span>**16.** Fear and dread shall fall upon
them: by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone;
till thy people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over, which thou
hast purchased.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p13"></span>**16.** Cadet super eos tremor et pavor:
in magnitudine brachii tui conticescent quasi lapis, donec pertransierit
populus tuus, Jehovae: donec pertransierit populus iste quem
acquisiisti.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p14"></span>**17.** Thou shalt bring them in, and
plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord,
which thou hast made for thee to dwell in; in the Sanctuary, O Lord,
which thy hands have established.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p15"></span>**17.** Introduces eos et plantabis eos
in monte haereditatis tuae, in loco quem praeparasti, Jehova, ut sedeas.
Sanctuarium, Domine, stabilierunt manus tuae.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p16"></span>**18.** The Lord shall reign for ever and
ever.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p17"></span>**18.** Jehova regnabit in saeculum et in
perpetuum.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p18"></span>**19.** For the horse of Pharaoh went in
with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the Lord
brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of
Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p19"></span>**19.** Quoniam ingressus est equus
Pharaonis cum curribus ejus et equitibus ejus in mare, et reduxit Jehova
super eos aquas maris: filii autem Israel ambulaverunt in sicco per
medium maris.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p20"></span>**20.** And Miriam the prophetess, the
sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women out after
her with timbrels and with dances.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p21"></span>**20.** Sumpsit etiam Maria prophetissa
soror Aharon tympanum in manu sua: et egressae sunt omnes mulieres post
eam cum tympanis et choris.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p22"></span>**21.** And Miriam answered them, Sing ye
to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider
hath he thrown into the sea.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p23"></span>**21.** Et respondebat illis Maria,
Cantate Jehovae, quoniam se magnifice extulit, equum et ascensorem ejus
projecit in mare.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p24"></span><span id="iv.xv.ii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p25"></span>**11.** *Who is like unto thee?* Moses
concludes this song of praise with an ejaculation, because the grandeur
of the subject transcends the power of words. The interrogation
expresses more than as if he had simply asserted that none can be
compared with God; because it marks both admiration and assured
confidence in the truth of what he says; for he exclaims, as if
overwhelmed with astonishment, “Who is like unto thee, O Lord?” The
notion of some that by the word “gods” he means the angels, is more
suitable to other passages; for instance, (<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p25.1"></span>[Ps
89:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p25.1"></span>,) “Who in heaven can be compared unto the
Lord; who among the sons  <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) of the
mighty can be likened unto the Lord?” for it immediately follows, “God
is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in
reverence of all them that are round about him.” (<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p26.1"></span>[Ex
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.xv.ii-p26.1"></span>,
etc.) The meaning then is,  <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md)
that, although there be excellence in the angels, still God is exalted
far above them all; but here it may be more properly referred to idols,
for Moses (as has been said) is professedly contrasting’ the one true
God, whose religion and worship existed among the children of Abraham,
with the delusions of the Gentiles. The word “sanctitas,” holiness,
expresses that glory which separates God from all His creatures; and
therefore, in a manner, it degrades all the other deities which the
world has invented for itself; since the majesty of the one only God is
thus eminent and honorable. He adds, “fearful in praises;” because He
cannot be duly praised, without ravishing us with astonishment. Moses
afterwards explains himself, by saying that God’s works are wonderful.
In my opinion, their explanation is a poor one, who think that He is
said to be “fearful in praises,” because He is to be praised with fear;
and theirs is farfetched, who say that he is terrible, even when he is
praised.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p28"></span><span id="iv.xv.ii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p29"></span>**13.** *Thou in thy mercy hast led them
forth.*  <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) The verb in Hebrew is
indeed in the past tense; but, since it is plain from the context that
their hope for what was to come was founded on God’s former mercies, I
have preferred making the meaning clearer by translating it in the
future.  <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) Moses, therefore,
exhorts the people to proceed to their promised land boldly and
joyfully; because God will not forsake His work in the midst of it. And
on this account he expressly mentions their redemption; as though he had
said, that the people were not in vain delivered from impending death,
but that God, as He had begun, would be their constant guide. David uses
the same argument, (<span id="iv.xv.ii-p31.1"></span>[Ps
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p31.1"></span>,)

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p32"></span>“Into thine hand I commit my spirit; thou
hast redeemed me,  
O Lord God of truth.”

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p33"></span>For, as the beginning of their redemption
has proceeded from God’s mere mercy, so he says that for this same
reason He will lead them even to their promised inheritance. But, since
the many obstacles might impress them with alarm, he at the same time
sets before them the “strength” of God; for the whole praise is given to
God, who had both been freely gracious to His people, and, asking
assistance from no other source, but contented with His own power, had
supplied what would have been otherwise incredible.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p34"></span><span id="iv.xv.ii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p35"></span>**14.** *The people shall hear.* Again in
this place I have not scrupled to change the tenses; for it is plain
that Moses is speaking of things future; although I do not deny, that by
verbs of the past tense he confirms the certainty of the matter; which
is a common figure with the Prophets. This boast depends on the mention
of God’s “strength;” for it was impossible for the Israelites to make
their way through so many adverse nations into the land of Canaan,
unless God had, as it were, put forth His hand from heaven and fought
for them. Lest, then, their numerous difficulties should dishearten
them, Moses declares that, although many powerful enemies should
endeavor to oppose them, terror shall possess them all from heaven, so
that, in their confusion and astonishment, they shall have no power of
resistance.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p36"></span><span id="iv.xv.ii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p37"></span>**16.** *Fear and dread shall fall upon
them.* Some read this in the optative mood, but with little probability,
as it seems to me; for Moses is not so much expressing wishes or
prayers, as animating the Israelites to have a good hope, and to be
firmly convinced that God would not make an end until He had finished
the course of His grace. And this we may fairly apply to ourselves at
this time, viz., that God will continue His calling in the elect, until
they are brought on to the goal. For the heavenly inheritance, (to which
we are called,) answers to “the mountain” of His holiness.  <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) The same reason, which was just before
advanced, is again repeated, viz., that God would not fail His people
until the end, because He had “purchased” them to Himself. For the
translation “which thou hast possessed” is not so suitable; because
although Moses signifies that they are God’s peculiar people, yet is
their deliverance undoubtedly alleged as the cause of their full
redemption; as if he had said, that the people whom God had once
undertaken to protect would always be dear to Him.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p39"></span><span id="iv.xv.ii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p40"></span>**17.** *Thou shalt bring them in.* The
metaphor of planting denotes a firm habitation; as also in <span
id="iv.xv.ii-p40.1"></span>[Ps
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.xv.ii-p40.1"></span>,
“Thou didst drive out the heathen with thine hand, and plantedst” our
fathers, and causedst them to take root. Moreover, by his commendatory
allusion to the temple, Moses excites in the people’s hearts a desire
for the land, which was to be God’s “Sanctuary;” and by this secret
thought attracts them, indifferent as they were, to seek the enjoyment
of this great blessing. He also prophesies of Mount Sion many ages
before the temple was erected there; from whence we gather that it was
not chosen by man’s will, but consecrated by the eternal counsel and
predestination of God. For it behooved that the gratuitous favor of God
should manifest itself as to this place, as well as to men’s persons.
Thus, in <span id="iv.xv.ii-p40.2"></span>[Ps
78:67](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067.md)<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p40.2"></span>, it is said,

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p41"></span>“He refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and
chose not the tribe of Ephraim; but chose the of Judah,” etc.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p42"></span>Elsewhere also, (<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p42.1"></span>[Ps.
132:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014)<span id="iv.xv.ii-p42.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p43"></span>“For the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath
desired it for his habitation: this is my rest for ever; here will I
dwell, for I have desired it.”

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p44"></span>But the stability of the temple is also
foretold; as in another passage,  <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) “Thy hand hath founded Zion.” (<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p45.1"></span>[Ps
87:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#001.md)<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p45.1"></span>.) And God himself declares by Isaiah that He
will not suffer Jerusalem to be laid waste, (<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p45.2"></span>[Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026.md)<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p45.2"></span>,) because of ancient times He had formed it.
But although the whole land of Canaan is elsewhere called God’s rest,
and the people was never collected into one city, yet, because God
blessed the whole nation and land out c f His sanctuary, therefore is
special mention made of His holy mountain. But this prophecy was very
needful for the support of their minds, because Jerusalem only came into
their power at a late period; and doubtless their posterity would have
been still more slow to take possession of it had not their hearts been
stimulated by this promise. A short sentence follows concerning God’s
eternal reign, on which the perpetuity of the Church is founded. Thus
David, (<span id="iv.xv.ii-p45.3"></span>[Ps
102:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#027.md)<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p45.3"></span>,) after having said that God would always be
the, same, and His years would have no end, thus concludes, “The
children of thy servants shall continue, and their deed shall be
established before thee.” (<span id="iv.xv.ii-p45.4"></span>[Ps
102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028.md)<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p45.4"></span>.) Moses, then, would extend the hope of the
people to all ages, because of God’s kingdom there is no end.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p46"></span><span id="iv.xv.ii-p46.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p47"></span>**19.** *For the horse of Pharaoh went
in.* This verse does not; seem to be suited to the song, and therefore I
am rather of opinion that Moses returns here to the history, and assigns
the reason why the Israelites so magnificently celebrated the praises of
God. For the sake of avoiding ambiguity, it would perhaps be better thus
to render it, — “For the horse of Pharaoh had gone in, and the Lord had
brought again the waters of the sea upon them, but; the children of
Israel had gone on dry land.”  <span id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md)

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p49"></span><span id="iv.xv.ii-p49.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p50"></span>**20.** *And Miriam the prophetess.*
<span id="iv.xv.ii-p50.1"></span>Moses here introduces in his song the
<span id="iv.xv.ii-p50.2"></span>ἀντιστροφὴ<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p50.3"></span>, such as were constantly used by the lyric
poets. For God would have not only men to be the proclaimers of this
great miracle, but associated the women with them. When, therefore, the
men had finished their song, the women followed in order. Although it is
not certain whether the first verse was intercalary, (as the sacred
history testifies the following sentence to have been in a solemn hymn:
— “For his mercy endureth for ever,” <span
id="iv.xv.ii-p50.4"></span>[1Ch
16:34](../../../bib/kjv/ch1016.htm#034.md)<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p50.4"></span><span id="iv.xv.ii-p50.5"></span>, which is
also intercalated in <span id="iv.xv.ii-p50.6"></span>[Ps
136](../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p50.6"></span><span id="iv.xv.ii-p50.7"></span>), or
whether the women repeated alternately what the men had sung. It little
matters which opinion you prefer, except that the former is more
probable. But although Moses honors his sister by the title of
“prophetess,” he does not say that she assumed to herself the office of
public teaching, but only that she was the leader and directress of the
others in praising God. The beating of timbrels may indeed appear absurd
to some, but the custom of the nation excuses it, which David witnesses
to have existed also in his time, where he enumerates, together with the
singers, “the damsels playing with timbrels,” (<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p50.8"></span>[Ps
68:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p50.8"></span><span id="iv.xv.ii-p50.9"></span>,) evidently
in accordance with common and received custom. Yet must it be observed,
at the same time, that musical instruments were among the legal
ceremonies which Christ at His coming abolished; and therefore we, under
the Gospel, must maintain a greater simplicity.  <span

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p1"></span><span id="iv.xv.iii-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
15:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.xv.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p2"></span>**22.** So Moses brought Israel from the
Red sea; and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went
three days in the wilderness, and found no water.

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p3"></span>**22.** Et eduxit Moses Israelem e mari
Suph: et egressi sunt in desertum Sur: ac quum perrexissent tribus
diebus per desertum, non reperiebant aquas.

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p4"></span>**23.** And when they came to Marah, they
could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore
the name of it was called Marah.

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p5"></span>**23.** Post venerunt in Marah, nec
poterant bibere aquas e Marah: quia amarae erant: ideo vocatum est nomen
ejus Marah.

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p6"></span>**24.** And the people murmured against
Moses, saying, What shall we drink?

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p7"></span>**24.** Et populus murmurantes contra
Mosen, dixerunt, Quid bibemus?

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p8"></span>**25.** And he cried unto the Lord; and
the Lord showed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the
waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an
ordinance, and there he proved them,

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p9"></span>**25.** Tunc clamavit ad Jehovam: et
indicavit illi Jehova lignum, quod projecit in aquas: et dulces redditae
sunt aquae. Ibi posuit ei statutum et judicium, ibique tentavit eum.

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p10"></span>**26.** And said, If thou wilt
diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that
which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and
keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee,
which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth
thee.

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p11"></span>**26.** Et dixit, Si obediendo obedieris
voci Jehovae Dei tui, et quod rectum est in oculis ejus feceris et
auscultaveris praeceptis ejus, custodierisque omnia statuta ejus,
universum languorem quem posui in AEgypto non ponam super te: quia ego
Jehova sanans te.

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p12"></span>**27.** And they came to Elim, where
were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees: and they
encamped there by the waters.

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p13"></span>**27.** Venerunt autem in Elim, ubi
erant duodecim fontes aquarum, et; septuaginta palmae: et manserunt ibi
juxta aquas.

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p14"></span><span id="iv.xv.iii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p15"></span>**22.** *So Moses brought.* Moses now
relates that, from the time, of their passage through the sea, they had
been suffering for three days from the want of water, that the first
they discovered was bitter, and that thence the name was given to the
place. This was indeed no light temptation, to suffer thirst for three
days in a dry land, and nowhere to meet with relief or remedy. No
wonder, then, that they should have groaned with anxiety; but grief,
when it is full of contumacy, deserves no pardon. In such an emergency,
they should have directed their prayers to God; whereas they not only
neglected to pray, but violently assailed Moses, and demanded of him the
drink which they knew could only be given them by God. But because they
had not yet learnt to trust in Him, they fly not to Him for aid, except
by imperiously commanding Him, in the person of His servant, to obey
their wishes; for this interrogation, “What shall we drink?” is as much
as to say, “Arrange with God to supply us with drink.” But they do not
directly address God, of whose assistance they feel that they have need,
because unbelief is ever proud.

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p16"></span><span id="iv.xv.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p17"></span>**25.** *And he cried.* Hence we gather
that Moses alone duly prayed when the people tumultuously rose against
him, and that they who were not worthy of the common air itself were
abundantly supplied with sweet water. Herein shone forth the inestimable
mercy of God, who deigned to change the nature of the water for the
purpose of supplying such wicked, and rebellious, and ungrateful men. He
might have given them sweet water to drink at first, but He wished by
the bitter to make prominent the bitterness which lurked in their
hearts. He might, too, have corrected by His mere will the evil in the
waters, so that they should have grown sweet spontaneously. It is not
certain why He preferred to apply the tree, except to reprove their
foolish impiety by showing that He has many remedies in His power for
every evil. A question also arises as to the tree, whether it inherently
possessed the property which it there exercised. But although probable
arguments may be adduced on both sides, I rather incline to the opinion
that there was indeed a natural power concealed in the tree, and yet
that the taste of the water was miraculously corrected; because it would
have been difficult so speedily to collect a sufficient quantity of the
tree for purifying a river; for 600,000 men, together with their wives
and children and cattle, would not have been contented with a little
streamlet. But I am led by no trifling reason to think that this
property was previously existing in the tree; because it is plain that a
particular species was pointed out to Moses, yet does not that prevent
us from believing that a greater efficacy than usual was imparted to it,
so that the waters should be immediately sweetened by its being put into
them. What follows in the second part of the verse admits of a double
signification, viz., either that, whereas God had there ordained a
statute, yet that He was tempted by the people; or, because God was
tempted by the people, therefore He had ordained the statute. If the
first sense be preferred, their crime will be augmented by the
comparison; for the impiety of the people was all the worse because,
being taught by the voice of God, *yet* in the very same place they gave
the reins to their rebellious spirit. But I rather embrace the latter
sense, viz., that God chastised the sin of the people by whom He had
been tempted. It was in fact a kind of tempting of God, because they not
only doubtingly inquired who should give them water, but in these words
manifested their despair. But because in the same context it is said,
“there he made for them a statute, and there he tempted (or proved)
them,” the name of God appears to be the subject in both clauses, and it
is predicated of the people that they received the ordinance and were
proved. Thus the meaning will be, that after God had tried His people,
by the want of water, He at the same time admonished them by His word,
that hereafter they should submit themselves more teachably and
obediently to His commands.

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p18"></span><span id="iv.xv.iii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p19"></span>**26.** *If thou wilt diligently
hearken.* <span id="iv.xv.iii-p19.1"></span>Moses now unfolds what was
the statute or ordinance which God promulgated. For here the reference
is not to the whole law which was afterwards given on mount Sinai, but
to the special admonition which served to chastise the wickedness of the
people. The sum of it is, that if the Israelites were tractable and,
obedient to God, He on the other hand would be kind and. bountiful to
them. And it is an implied rebuke, that they might know whatever
troubles they experienced to be, brought upon them by their sins. He
proposes the Egyptians to them as an example, whose rebellion they had
seen punished by God with such severe and heavy calamities. “I am the
Lord that healeth thee,” is immediately added in confirmation, as if he
had said, that the Israelites were liable to the same plagues which had
been inflicted on the Egyptians, and were only exempt from them because
God performed the office of a healer. And truly whatsoever diseases
afflict the human race, we may see in them, as in so many mirrors, our
own, miseries, that, we may perceive that there is no health in us,
except in so far as God spares us. We are also taught in this verse that
this is the rule of a good life, when we obey God’s voice and study to
please Him. But because the will of God was soon after to be proclaimed
in the law, He expressly commands them to “give ear to His commandments,
and to keep His statutes.”  <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md)
<span id="iv.xv.iii-p20.1"></span> I know not whether there is any force
in the opinion of some who distinguish the word <span
id="iv.xv.iii-p20.2"></span>חקים<span id="iv.xv.iii-p20.3"></span>,
*chokim,* <span id="iv.xv.iii-p20.4"></span>(which it is usual to
translate “statutes,”) from precepts, as if they were mere declarations
of His pleasure to which no reason is attached. Let it suffice that
God’s law is commended under many names, to take away all pretext of
ignorance.

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p21"></span><span id="iv.xv.iii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xv.iii-p22"></span>**27.** *And they came to Elim.* Moses
here relates that a more pleasant station was granted to the people,
when they were led to a well-watered spot, even planted with palm-trees,
which do not usually grow in a dry soil. But we learn from what
precedes, that this was a concession to their infirmity, because they
had borne their thirst so impatiently.

<span id="iv.xv.ii-p51"></span> *C.’s* opinion on this subject will be
found at greater length in his *Commetary on the Psalms,* (Calvin
Society’s Translation,) vol. 1:539; 3:98, 312, 495; 4:72, 73; 5:312,
320. Perhaps the following note on <span
id="iv.xv.ii-p51.8"></span>[Psalm
81:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.xv.ii-p51.8"></span>,
may most conveniently embody his sentiments: — “With respect to the
tabret, harp, and psaltery, we have formerly observed, and shall find it
necessary afterwards to repeat the same remark, that the Levites, under
the law, were justified in making use of instrumental music in the
worship of God; it having been His will to train His people, while they
were as yet tender and like children, by such rudiments, until the
coming of Christ. But now, when the clear light of the Gospel has
dissipated the shadows of the law, and taught us that God is to be
served in a simpler form, it would be to act a foolish and mistaken part
to imitate that which the Prophet enjoined only upon those of his own
time. From this it is apparent that the Papists have shown themselves to
be very apes in transferring it to themselves.” — Vol 3, p. 312.
Elsewhere he says, “Paul allows us to bless God in the public assembly
of the saints only in a known tongue. (<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p51.10"></span>[1Co
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.xv.ii-p51.10"></span>.) The voice of man, although not understood
by the generality, assuredly excels all inanimate instruments of music;
and yet we see what St. Paul determines concerning speaking in an
unknown tongue.” — *Commentary on* <span
