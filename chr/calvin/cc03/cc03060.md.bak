<span id="vi.i-p2"></span>**<span id="vi.i-p2.1"></span>[Exodus
20:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#003.md)<span id="vi.i-p2.1"></span>**
*Thou shalt have no other gods before me.* <span
id="vi.i-p2.2"></span>In this commandment God enjoins that He alone
should be worshipped, and requires a worship free from all superstition.
For although it seems to be a simple prohibition, yet must we deduce an
affirmation from the negative, as will be more apparent from the
following words. Therefore does He set Himself before them, in order
that the Israelites may look to Him alone; and claims His own just
right, in order that it may not be transferred elsewhere. All do not
agree in the exposition of the words, for some construe the word <span
id="vi.i-p2.3"></span>פנים*,*  <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md)
*panim,*<span id="vi.i-p3.3"></span> “anger,” <span
id="vi.i-p3.4"></span>as if it were said, “Thou shalt not make to
thyself other gods to provoke my anger;” <span id="vi.i-p3.5"></span>and
I admit that the Hebrew word is often used in this sense. The other
interpretation, however, seems to me the more correct, “Make not to
thyself gods before my face.” Yet still there remains a difference of
opinion, for people are not agreed as to the particle <span
id="vi.i-p3.6"></span>על<span id="vi.i-p3.7"></span>, *gnel.* <span
id="vi.i-p3.8"></span>Some explain it, “Make <span
id="vi.i-p3.9"></span>not to thyself gods *above* <span
id="vi.i-p3.10"></span>me, or whom thou mayest prefer to me;” <span
id="vi.i-p3.11"></span>and they quote the passage in <span
id="vi.i-p3.12"></span>[De
21:15-17](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.i-p3.12"></span><span id="vi.i-p3.13"></span>, <span
id="vi.i-p3.14"></span>wherein God forbids a man, if he have two wives,
and children by both, to transfer the rights of primogeniture to the
second *before the face* <span id="vi.i-p3.15"></span>of the first-born.
But though we admit that a comparison is there made between the elder
and the younger, still it would be too frigid an interpretation here to
say that God demands nothing more than that other gods should not obtain
the higher place; whereas He neither suffers them to be likened to Him,
nor even to be joined with Him as companions;  <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) <span id="vi.i-p4.1"></span> for
religion is defiled and corrupted as soon as God’s glory is diminished
in the very least degree. And we know that when the Israelites
worshipped their Baalim, they did not so substitute them in the place of
God as to put Him altogether aside, and assign to them the supreme
power; nevertheless, this was an intolerable profanation of God’s
worship, and moreover an impious transgression of this precept, <span
id="vi.i-p4.2"></span>to choose for themselves patrons in whom some part
of the Deity should be lodged; because if God *have not alone* <span
id="vi.i-p4.3"></span>the pre-eminence, His majesty is so far obscured.
I consider,therefore, the genuine sense to be, that the Israelites
should not make to themselves any gods, whom they might oppose to the
true and only God. For in Hebrew the expression, *before the face,*
<span id="vi.i-p4.4"></span>generally means *over against;* <span
id="vi.i-p4.5"></span>therefore God would not have companions obtruded
upon Him, and placed as it were in His sight. Meanwhile, it seems
probable to me that He alludes to that manifestation of Himself which
ought to have retained His people in sincere piety; for true and pure
religion was so revealed in the Law, that God’s face in a manner shone
forth therein. The case was different with the Gentiles, who, although
they might rashly make to themselves false gods, still would not do so
before the face of God, which was unknown to them. Let us then
understand, after all, that those alone are accounted the legitimate
worshippers of God who bid adieu to all figments, and cleave to Him
alone. Nor can it be doubted that these words comprehend the inward
worship of God, since this commandment differs from the next, whereby
external idolatry will be seen to be condemned. It is sufficiently
notorious, that men may make to themselves gods in other ways besides in
statues, and pictures, and in visible forms. If any should adore the
angels instead of God, or should foolishly imagine any other secret
divinity, none will deny that he would offend against this Law. God,
therefore, calls for the affections of the heart, that He alone may be
spiritually worshipped; and the expression “before my face,” may be not
inaptly referred to this; because, although their impiety, who secretly
turn aside to false worship, and cherish their errors within their own
bosoms, may be able to evade the eyes of men, yet their hypocrisy and
treachery will not escape the notice of God. Hence, again, it follows,
that the one God is not rightly worshipped, unless He be separated from
all figments. Wherefore it is not enough to make use of His name, unless
all corruptions opposed to His word be laid aside; and thence we arrive
at the distinction between true religion and false superstitions; for
since God has prescribed to us how He would be worshipped by us,
whenever we turn away in the very smallest degree from this rule, we
make <span id="vi.i-p4.6"></span>to ourselves other gods, and degrade
Him from His right place.
