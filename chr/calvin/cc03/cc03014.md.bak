<span id="iv.xi-p1"></span>EXODUS 11

<span id="iv.xi.i"></span>

<span id="iv.xi.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.xi.i-p1.1"></span>[Exodus
11:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.xi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xi.i-p2"></span>**1.** And the Lord said unto Moses, Yet
will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he
will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust
you out hence altogether.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p3"></span>**1.** Dixerat autem Jehova ad Mosen, Adhuc
plagam unam adducam super Pharaonem, et super AEgyptum: postea dimittet
vos hinc, dimittendo vos perfecte: expellendo expellet vos hinc.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p4"></span>**2.** Speak now in the ears of the people,
and let every man borrow of his neighbor, and every woman of her
neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p5"></span>**2.** Loquere nunc in auribus populi, ut
petant quisque a proximo suo, et mulier a proxima sua vasa argentea et
vasa aurea.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p6"></span>**3.** And the Lord gave the people favor
in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in
the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight
of the people.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et dabit Jehova gratiam populo in
oculis AEgyptiorum. Etiam vir Moses magnus erat valde in terra AEgypti,
in oculis servorum Pharaonis, et in oculis populi.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p8"></span>**4.** And Moses said, Thus saith the Lord,
About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:

<span id="iv.xi.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et dixit Moses, Sic dicit Jehova,
Circiter dimidium noctis ego egrediar in medium AEgypti.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p10"></span>**5.** And all the first-born in the land
of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his
throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the
mill; and all the first-born of beasts.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p11"></span>**5.** Morieturque omne primogenitum in
terra AEgypti, a primogenito Pharaonis qui sedet super solium ejus,
usque ad primogenitum ancillae quae est post molam, et omne primogenitum
jumenti.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p12"></span>**6.** And there shall be a great cry
throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor
shall be like it any more.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et erit clamor magnus in tota terra
AEgypti, qualis nunquam fuit, nec futurus est.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p14"></span>**7.** But against any of the children of
Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast; that ye
may know how that the Lord doth put a difference between the Egyptians
and Israel.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p15"></span>**7.** Apud omnes autem filios Israel non
movebit canis linguam suam, ab homine usque ad animal, ut sciatis quod
distinctionem posuit Deus inter AEgyptios et inter Israel.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p16"></span>**8.** And all these thy servants shall
come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee
out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out.
And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p17"></span>**8.** Descendentque omnes hi servi tui ad
me, et adorabunt me, dicendo, Egredere tu et totus populus qui est sub
pedibus tuis: postea egrediar. Et egressus est a Pharaone in ira,
vehementi.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p18"></span>**9.** And the Lord said unto Moses,
Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in
the land of Egypt.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p19"></span>**9.** Dixerat autem Jehova ad Mosen, Non
audiet vos Pharao, ut multiplicem portenta mea in terra AEgypti.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p20"></span>**10.** And Moses and Aaron did all these
wonders before Pharaoh: and the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that
he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p21"></span>**10.** Itaque Moses et Aharon fecerunt
omnia haec portenta coram Pharaone. Et roboravit Jehova cor Pharaonis,
ut non dimitteret filios Israel e terra sua.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p22"></span><span id="iv.xi.i-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xi.i-p23"></span>**1.** *And the Lord said unto Moses.*
 <span id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) He now relates that it was not
with self-conceived confidence that he was lately so elated, as we have
seen him;  <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) but because he had
been forewarned by divine revelation that the end of the contests was
now near, and that nothing now remained but. that Pharaoh should fall by
his mortal wound. This verse, then, is connected with the preceding, and
explains its cause; because Moses would not have been at liberty to
interrupt the course of his vocation, unless he had now plainly known
that he was arriving at its conclusion. Nor would it otherwise agree
with what follows, via, that Moses spoke to Pharaoh after he had
declared that he would not appear any more in his sight, unless the
subject were continued without interruption. But this sentence is
introduced parenthetically, (meaning) that however obstinate Pharaoh
might be, the hour was now come in which he must succumb to God. But God
not only declares that the heart of Pharaoh should be changed, so that
he would not hinder the people’s departure, but that he would be himself
anxious for that, which he had so pertinaciously refused; for this is
the meaning of the words, he will not only send you away, but altogether
thrust you out. For in his alarm at their presence, he eagerly drove
them from his kingdom.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p26"></span><span id="iv.xi.i-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xi.i-p27"></span>**2.** *Speak now in the ears of the
people.* He repeats His command as to spoiling the Egyptians, of which
mention was made in the third chapter, for it was not enough for God to
rescue His people from that cruel tyranny under which their wretched
lives were scarcely protracted in great poverty and distress, unless He
also enriched them with large possessions, as if they were carrying away
the prizes of victory from conquered enemies. This, therefore, was the
consummation of His otherwise extraordinary bounty, that they departed
splendidly adorned,  <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) and laden
with precious furniture. We have already explained how it was lawful for
the Israelites to take away with them the golden and silver vessels
under pretext of borrowing them.  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) Surely the sole authority of God
absolves them from the accusation of theft and sinful deception. But it
cannot be permitted to any mortal man to censure or cavil at anything in
the commandment of God; not only because His decree is above all laws,
but because His most perfect will is the rule of all laws. For neither
therefore is God unanswerable to law, because: he delights in
uncontrollable power; but because in the perfection of His infinite
justice there is no need of law. But although the excuse which some
allege is not altogether without show of reason, viz., that the very
severe labors which the Egyptians had tyrannically exacted were worthy
of some reward, and therefore that God had justly permitted His people
to exact the compensation of which they would have been otherwise
unjustly defrauded, still there is no necessity for having recourse to
these subtleties; for that principle, which we have elsewhere laid down,
ought to be sufficient, that God, in whose hands are the ends of the
earth, to destroy and to overturn at His will its kingdoms, and to
change the government of its nations, much more (has the right) so to
distribute the wealth and possessions of individuals, as to enrich some
and to reduce others to want.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p30"></span>“The rich and poor meet together, (says
Solomon:) the Lord is maker of them all,” (<span
id="iv.xi.i-p30.1"></span>[Pr
22:2](../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#002)<span id="iv.xi.i-p30.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="iv.xi.i-p31"></span>by which words he means that the
providence of God rules in the various mixing together of poor and rich.
But if theft be the taking away of what is another’s, those things which
it has pleased God to transfer to His own people, must not be counted
the property of others. But if by the laws of war it be permitted to the
victors to gather up the spoil of the enemy, why should we consider it
less allowable for God to do so from the Egyptians, whom He had overcome
in ten illustrious battles, before He compelled them to surrender? As to
the pretense of borrowing, the reply is easy, for the Israelitish women
did not lie when they asked for the vessels for the purpose of
sacrifice: since God had thus commanded, in whose power it was
afterwards to devote them to other uses. Still part of them were
dedicated to the sanctuary, as we shall see elsewhere; for besides the
altar, the censer, and the candlestick, and other vessels of that kind,
each of the tribes offered vials and dishes of great value. Yet must we
recollect that a particular case is here related, imitation of which,
without God’s special command, would be wrong.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p32"></span><span id="iv.xi.i-p32.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xi.i-p33"></span>**3.** *And the Lord gave*  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) *the people favor.* Because the
Israelites never could have hoped that the Egyptians, who had before
rapaciously stripped them of everything, would become so kind and
liberal to them, Moses declares that men’s hearts are turned this way or
that by God. For, as the Psalm testifies, that the Egyptians were
impelled by Him “to hate His people,” (<span
id="iv.xi.i-p34.1"></span>[Ps
105:25](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.xi.i-p34.1"></span>,) that He might make way for their glorious
deliverance; so He was able also to incline them in the opposite
direction, that they should freely give what they had before harshly
refused, and not without threats and blows. This doctrine is exceedingly
useful to be known, because, when men are harsh and cruel to us, it:
teaches us patience, whilst we are assured that the passions of wicked
men only thus assail us, in so far as God would chastise our sins, and
exercise and humble us. It affords also no little consolation to
alleviate our pains, and seasonably arouses us to call upon God, that He
would turn the minds of our enemies from brutality and unkindness to
gentleness. It appears from many passages that this was ever the
persuasion of all the pious, and unquestionably the expression of Jacob
to his sons, “God Almighty give (*dabit*) you mercy before the man,” was
founded on this general feeling. (<span id="iv.xi.i-p34.2"></span>[Ge
43:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.xi.i-p34.2"></span>.) But, since Scripture is full of such
testimonies, let it suffice to have quoted this single one. Again, God
does not always incline men to mercy, by the Spirit of regeneration, so
that they should be changed from wolves to lambs; but sometimes by His
secret inspiration He for a short time softens them though they know it
not, as we read here of the Egyptians. In the second clause of the
verse, where it is said, “Moreover the man Moses,” etc., an inferior and
subordinate reason is given, which availed both to change the Egyptians
as well as to encourage the Israelites, so that both of them reverently
deferred to his words; for although this whole matter was governed by
the power of God alone, still He did not act simply by Himself, but
having chosen Moses as His minister, He assigned  <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) a certain charge to him. Hence the
veneration which made the Egyptians as well as the Israelites obedient
to him, that his labor might not be in vain. He only speaks, indeed, of
the Egyptian nation, (for after having spoken of “the land” first, he
adds two divisions, “Pharaoh’s servants,” i.e., the nobles and
courtiers, and then “the common people,” for so in this place I
understand the word “people;”) but we shall soon see that the miracles
had had a good effect upon the Israelites also, that they should more
readily believe and obey. But; this passage teaches us that God’s
servants are often prized and honored, where yet faith in their doctrine
is not possessed, for although the Egyptians reverence and highly esteem
Moses, they do not therefore incline to seek  <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) after piety. And thus the wicked often
fear God Himself, when influenced by particular circumstances, and yet
do not devote themselves to His service.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p37"></span><span id="iv.xi.i-p37.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xi.i-p38"></span>**4.** *And Moses said, Thus saith the
Lord.* I lately said that Moses did not go from Pharaoh’s presence until
he had delivered the message of his final destruction. This denunciation
is, therefore, connected with the foregoing passage. Whence it appears
how courageously Moses sustained the menaces of the tyrant, whilst he
willingly encounters him, and boasts that he shall be his conqueror,
though he be not in his presence, by the death of his first-born son in
the coming night. Nor is it to be doubted that Pharaoh was confounded
with terror, since, although so cruelly repulsed, he dismissed the
Prophet in safety. Assuredly, since so unreserved a threatening must;
have inflicted a very bitter pang, so it would have aroused the cruelty
of the raging tyrant, unless the same God who had endued His servant
with admirable firmness, had also controlled the impetuosity of the
savage beast. Why God, in inflicting punishment on the children,
postponed till another time that of the fathers, whose sin was greater;
why, in wreaking vengeance on the beasts, He spared men, it is not our
province curiously to inquire, because  <span
id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) it is sinful to prescribe to God,
whose incomprehensible wisdom surmounts all human understanding, what
should be the rule or measure of His judgments. By bringing the children
and beasts to punishment, He certainly represented clearly to the wicked
despisers of His power, what they had deserved. The first-born of
Pharaoh, who would have been heir of the kingdom, is placed in the first
rank of victims; afterwards the whole body of humbler people is
mentioned, for the maid-servants, who turned their revolving mills,
occupied a very low and despised condition, as appears not only from the
ancient poets, but from the testimony of Scripture itself. (<span
id="iv.xi.i-p39.1"></span>[1Sa
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/sa1008.htm#016)<span id="iv.xi.i-p39.1"></span>..md)
If any one chooses to observe the analogy between this plague and the
unjust tyranny by which the Egyptians had afflicted Israel, God’s
first-born son, I make no objection. God again puts a difference between
the Egyptians and his own people, when he declares that, in the midst of
the great cry, the latter shall be quiet and tranquil. For this is the
meaning of the figure, “A dog shall not move his tongue,” because dogs
are wont to bark at the very least noise in the night. Moreover,
although such a separation between the faithful and unbelievers does not
always appear, but rather do similar punishments generally involve them
both together, yet in the final issue God divides them very widely one
from the other. Wherefore we can never lose this felicity, that we know
that all afflictions conspire unto the salvation of us, whom he has once
embraced with His loving-kindness.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p40"></span><span id="iv.xi.i-p40.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xi.i-p41"></span>**8.** *And all these thy servants shall
come down.* Thus far Moses had reported the words of God; he now begins
to speak in his own person, and announces that, by Pharaoh’s command,
messengers would come from his court, who would voluntarily and humbly
crave for what he had refused respecting the dismissal of the
Israelites. The great asperity of these words inflicted no slight; wound
on the tyrant’s mind, for it was the same as if he had said — Thus far I
have entreated you to allow God’s people to depart; now, whether you
will or not, I will freely go, and not even without the request of
yourself and your followers. What he then relates, that he went out “in
the heat of anger,”  <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) or “in a
great anger,” shows us that the servants of God, even when they truly
and faithfully perform their duty, are so disturbed with indignation
against sin, that they are by no means restrained from being affected
with anger. Nor is there any question that Moses was thus excited to
wrath by the impulse of the Spirit. Yet, since we are naturally too
prone to impetuous passions, we must diligently beware lest our
indignation exceed due bounds. The Spirit awakened in the heart of Moses
this zeal, which here is mentioned, but he at the same time moderated
it, so that it should contain no admixture of unregulated passion. But
since it may, and often does happen that the faithful, when influenced
by pious zeal, still do not sufficiently restrain themselves, nor keep
themselves within due bounds, the spirit of gentleness and propriety
must be asked of God, which may prevent all excesses. Yet the anger of
Moses is a proof to us that God would not have us lazily and coldly
perform the duties which He entrusts to us; and, therefore, that nothing
is more preposterous than for certain cynics, whilst they jokingly and
ridiculously philosophize concerning the doctrines of religion, and
sting God’s servants with their laughing and wanton witticisms, to
deride their vehemence, which is rather worthy of the highest praise.

<span id="iv.xi.i-p43"></span><span id="iv.xi.i-p43.1"></span>

<span id="iv.xi.i-p44"></span>**9.** *And the Lord said unto Moses.*
This seems to be a representation of the reason why Moses was so angry;
viz., because he had been forewarned that he had to do with a lost and
desperate man. When, therefore, after so many contests, he sees the
dominion of God despised by the audacity and madness of the tyrant,
deeper indignation bursts from him in their last struggle; especially
because he sees before his eyes that detestable prodigy, viz., an
earthen vessel so bold as to provoke God with indomitable obstinacy. But
God had foretold to Moses (as we have already seen) the end of this his
exceeding stubbornness, lest, having so often suffered repulse, he
should faint at length. Otherwise, there might have crept in no trifling
temptation, as to how it could please God to contend in vain with a
mortal man. And it was absurd that the hardness of a human heart could
not be either subdued, or corrected, or broken by the divine power. God,
therefore, asserts that He was thus designing His own glory, which he
desired to manifest by various miracles; and on this account he adds
again in the next verse, that Pharaoh’s heart was again hardened by God
Himself; whereby he signifies, that the tyrant thus pertinaciously
resisted, not without the knowledge and will of God, in order that the
deliverance might be more wonderful.
