<span id="v.iv-p2"></span><span id="v.iv-p2.1"></span>[Leviticus
22:31-33](../../../bib/kjv/lev022.htm#031)<span id="v.iv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p3"></span>**31.** Therefore shall ye keep my
commandments, and do them: I am the Lord.

<span id="v.iv-p4"></span>**31.** Observate praecepta mea, et facite ea:
ego Jehova.

<span id="v.iv-p5"></span>**32.** Neither shall ye profane my holy name;
but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the Lord which
hallow you,

<span id="v.iv-p6"></span>**32.** Et ne polluatis nomen sanctum meum,
sed sanctificer in medio Israel. Ego Jehova sanctificans vos.

<span id="v.iv-p7"></span>**33.** That brought you out of the land of
Egypt, to be your God: I am the Lord.

<span id="v.iv-p8"></span>**33.** Qui eduxi vos e terra Aegypti, ut
essem vobis in Deum: ego Jehova.

<span id="v.iv-p9"></span><span id="v.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p10"></span>**32.** *Neither shall ye profane.* In
forbidding the profanation of His name, He confirms in other words the
foregoing sentiment; guarding by them His worship from all corruptions,
that it may be maintained in purity and integrity. The same, too, is the
object of the clause in apposition, which immediately follows; for they
hallow God’s name who turn not away from its rightful and sincere
worship. Let this be carefully observed, that whatever fancies men
devise, are so many profanations of God’s name; for although the
superstitious may please themselves by their imaginations, yet is all
their religion full of sacrilege, whereby God complains that His
holiness is profaned. Mark, also, the mutual relation, when God requires
Himself to be hallowed, even as he hallows the people; for nothing can
be more unseemly than for the Israelites to mix up with idols Him by
whose blessing they excel all other nations. It is as though He
commanded them to reflect from whence their superiority proceeded, that
they may pay their debt of gratitude to Him who is its author. In sum,
forasmuch as He had separated them from heathen nations, He condemns all
wicked blending with them, whereby the integrity of religion is
corrupted, so that He may alone have the pre-eminence, and all idols may
be repudiated.  <span id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223)
