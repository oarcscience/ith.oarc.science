<span id="ii-p1"></span>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE

<span id="ii-p2"></span>Coming into the field as a Translator of Calvin
so late as I do, and after the various able Preliminary Notices of my
predecessors in the task, it would ill become me to offer any lengthened
remarks, either generally on the personal character and theological
system of our illustrious author, or more particularly on his merits as
a Commentator upon Scripture. It may not, however, be deemed superfluous
that I should refer my readers to the brief but interesting Memoir of
Calvin, written by his associate and friend Theodore Beza, and
translated by Henry Beveridge, Esq., in Volume I. of Calvin’s Tracts in
this Series. It would, I presume, be scarcely possible to produce within
a similar compass any Biography of the great Reformer which could at all
be brought into competition with this. That the colouring of partiality
may be discerned in it, the circumstances of the case would lead us to
expect; but as to the main facts of his life, whilst there can be little
ground for supposing Beza to be ignorant of them, so is he above the
suspicion of having intentionally falsified them. “Every reasonable
person,” says Bayle “will agree with me, that, with respect to the
historical sequence of Calvin’s travels, no author is more credible than
Theodore Beza when the occurrences are of such a nature as neither to
injure nor enhance the glory of Calvin.”

<span id="ii-p3"></span>It would at any rate appear to be peculiarly
unseasonable, at the present moment, to attempt any new Life of Calvin,
when an announcement has recently been made of a large amount of
materials having been discovered, which, when published, will probably
throw much additional light on the subject. I allude to a statement of
the French correspondent of the “*Evangelical Christendom*” for December
1851, vol. 5, p. 494, to the following effect: — “A young man, equally
distinguished by his piety and learning, M. Jules Bonnet, had been
commissioned, in the reign of Louis Philippe, to collect the unpublished
Letters of Calvin in the Public Libraries of France, Geneva, etc. He has
found 497, of which 190 are written in the French language, and 307 in
Latin. This correspondence promises the greatest interest. It commences
in 1524, when Calvin was yet on the benches of the University, and
continues up to 1564, the period when the illustrious Reformer died. The
greater part of these letters are addressed to Farel, Melancthon,
Theodore Beza, and other distinguished theologians. The French letters
are written to the King of Navarre, the Duchess of Ferrara, the Prince
of Conde, etc. One is addressed to the Duke of Somerset, who exercised
then high authority in England, and contains twenty-three pages.”

<span id="ii-p4"></span>It may not be impossible that a more accurate
examination of these documents will prove that some of them are already
before the public; yet few, I think, into whose hands this work may fall
will abstain from uniting in the hope expressed by our informant, that
this correspondence should be published; or, if they are at all
acquainted with the writings of Calvin, will fail to agree in the
opinion that “it will present to literature some excellent models of
style; to the historian, some precious documents; to the theologian,
some interesting ideas; and to simple Christians, some edifying
sentiments.”

<span id="ii-p5"></span>I would even venture here to record my own
fervent aspiration, that it may please God to dispose men’s hearts to
afford such renewed encouragement to those who have undertaken the great
national work of which this volume forms a portion, that it may not be
abandoned until the whole Remains of Calvin, including the
above-mentioned letters, shall have appeared in an English dress, and
until every emanation from his almost miraculously fertile mind shall
have enriched the religious literature of our age and country. I
believe, however, I am correct in saying, that it will be impossible to
put the top-stone on this monument of his Christian sagacity and
industry, unless every exertion be made to obtain supporters by those
who are desirous of its completion.

<span id="ii-p6"></span>The Work, which it is now my privilege for the
first time to introduce to the English Reader, is confessedly by no
means the least worthy of its Author. One of the ablest and most
laborious of our own Theological critics, Mr. Hartwell Horne, has
especially singled it out for eulogy from amongst the whole series of
Calvin’s commentaries. “His Harmony of the four last books of the
Pentateuch (he says) has been much and deservedly admired for its
ingenuity. The *History* contained in them forms a distinct part. The
rest is comprised under the following divisions: —

<span id="ii-p7"></span>**1.** Those passages which assert the
excellency of the Law by way of *Preface*;

<span id="ii-p8"></span>**2.** The *Ten Commandments*, under each of
which are comprehended all those parts of the Law which relate to the
same subject; and this forms the great body of the Harmony;

<span id="ii-p9"></span>**3.** The *Sum of the Law*, containing those
passages which enjoin Love to God, and Love to our Neighbor;

<span id="ii-p10"></span>**4.** *The Use of the Law*; and lastly, its
*Sanctions* of Promises and Threats.”

<span id="ii-p11"></span>I have quoted Mr. Horne’s compendious account
of the Book, in order that its character may at once be understood; and
surely the very idea of thus combining and arranging this portion of
Scripture, so as to present its contents in one simple and consistent
whole, must strike us as indication of no ordinary grasp and originality
of mind. With this Harmony before him, it is somewhat strange that
Lightfoot should have thus expressed himself in the Epistle Dedicatory
to his “Chronicle of the Times, and the Order of the Texts of the Old
Testament;” “I do not remember that I ever heard or saw this kind of
task undertaken in any language, namely, ‘to harmonize the Old
Testament,’ and to lay the current of it in a proper series; and,
therefore, I acknowledge I have made a very bold venture in attempting
to break this ice, and to tread in these untrodden paths, for which
foolhardiness I have no other plea than my own ignorance and the
reader’s gentleness.” It was, one would suppose, hardly within the range
of possibility that his ignorance could have extended to unacquaintance
with this considerable work from the pen of Calvin; and yet, though his
own plan was far more comprehensive, and at the same time less
artificial in its management than that of Calvin, at least the boast of
such absolute originality as he claims, seems to be barred by the
existence of the Book I have translated. It is perhaps even still more
remarkable that it should be passed over altogether by Dr. Townsend, in
the account of previous Harmonies prefixed to his own valuable
“Connexion of the Old Testament!”

<span id="ii-p12"></span>The only solution I can give of this omission
on the part of these two eminent writers — neither of whom would have
been at all likely to do intentional injustice to the *clarum et
venerabile nomen* in question — is that at which I have above hinted,
viz., that whilst there are undoubtedly manifest points of similarity in
their undertaking, there was still a considerable difference in the mode
of its performance.

<span id="ii-p13"></span>The object which Calvin had in view, and which
he has so efficiently executed, was not so much to present the narrative
of each of the four last books of the Pentateuch in its regular order of
occurrence, though it necessarily happens that, with respect to a great
part of them, this must incidentally be the case. His aim was a far
higher one than that of a mere Chronologist. He sought not mainly to
arrange the facts of Scripture, but rather to systematize its doctrines,
and to bring out the mind of the Spirit of God in the revelation of His
just, and good, and holy Law in a complete and harmonious form. His work
was intended as an auxiliary in that important process of
generalization, which every diligent and devout reader of the Bible must
to a certain extent, though sometimes even unconsciously, carry on in
his own mind; not satisfying himself with the notions conveyed by
isolated texts, but “comparing spiritual things with spiritual,” until
he arrives at a nearer comprehension of that perfect order which reigns
in the midst of their apparent discrepancies.

<span id="ii-p14"></span>The ingenuity of his arrangement it is
impossible to gainsay. That it is open to objections, even of a graver
character than have sometimes been alleged against ordinary Harmonies,
he seems himself to have felt; but with his usual candor and ability, he
meets them in the Preface, to which the reader is referred as the best
apology for his motives, and the clearest exposition of his design.

<span id="ii-p15"></span>But whatever may be thought of its execution,
it is certain that we have here the opinions of a master-mind on various
topics of paramount interest and importance, when it had attained its
fullest maturity and development. We expressly learn from Beza, *vide*
Life of Calvin, p. 82, that both the Commentary itself, and its
Translation into French, which was made by himself, were amongst the
labors of 1563, the penultimate year of his mortal existence, and this
statement is confirmed both by Senebier, as quoted in the Translator’s
Preface to Genesis, vol. 1, p. 18, and by Calvin’s own Dedicatory
Epistle to the French Translation of the Commentaries on the whole
Pentateuch, which is given in the latter work, p. 27, and which bears
the date of Geneva, “le dernier jour le Juillet, M.D. LXIII.”

<span id="ii-p16"></span>One can scarcely here forbear from a passing
allusion to the gigantic, and almost incredible labor involved in these
publications. “Calvin’s diseases (says his friend and biographer) had so
much increased, and were so numerous, as to make it impossible to
believe that so strong and noble a mind could be any longer confined in
a body so fragile, so exhausted by labor, and, in fine, so broken down
by suffering. But even then he could not be persuaded to spare himself.
Nay, if at any time he abstained from public duty, (and he never did so
without the greatest reluctance,) he still at home gave answers to those
who consulted him, or wore out his amanuenses by dictating to them,
though fatigued himself.” Making every allowance for the assistance he
received in the mere mechanical portion of his Work; and viewing this
arrangement, and its Commentary purely as an intellectual effort, it is
surely a marvelous production under the circumstances here detailed,
and, in itself, a remarkable evidence of the vast resources, and highly
disciplined powers of the mind which gave it birth. Nay, more than this,
may it not be fairly questioned whether it must not have been made “a
labor of love” with him, and whether any less powerful impulse than love
towards Him, who hath first so freely and so abundantly loved us,
working in dependence upon strength from above, could have carried it
through?

<span id="ii-p17"></span>We may indeed well imagine, that it was an
undertaking after his own heart, conceived, it may be, in earlier years,
but reserved for execution as the appropriate solace of his declining
age. As life wore on, or rather, in his ease, we may say, as life wore
out; as daily experience increasingly taught him the imperfection of
human wisdom; as the difficulties of his position  <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) in the van of the Reformation thickened
around him, doubtless the Scriptures of God grew more and more precious
to his soul, and were still more highly valued as the counsellors of his
mind and the delight of his heart.

<span id="ii-p19"></span>There were certain subjects, too, necessarily
brought before him in his meditation upon these particular Books, which
must have been very congenial to him. It was not unnatural that he
should take pleasure in soberly and calmly reviewing those doctrines
which had so largely exercised his earlier thoughts, and that the
distinctive tenets, which are usually associated with his name, and
which, as the Article of the Church of England testifies, are “full of
sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and such as
feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ,” should once
more pass before him in his latter days, and demand his serious
consideration. Here, then, was the opportunity. The Election of Israel,
their Predestination, and Calling to be the Lord’s peculiar people, and
the judicial blindness of wicked Pharaoh’s heart, led him to reflect and
speak with more than ordinary fullness upon the divine decrees of our
heavenly Father; and, perhaps, some of his most prejudiced opponents
might be surprised to find the limitations which his system recognized,
and the moderate tone of his statements, if they could be induced to
examine them here in their particular application, rather than in the
cruder and harsher form of general deductions and logical definitions.
At any rate — if, according to Bishop Burnet, “the common fault on both
sides (in this controversy) is, to charge one another with the
consequences of their opinions, as if they were truly their tenets” — it
must be confessed by all, that our Author is by no means guilty of
denying the responsibility of the sinner, or the need of personal
holiness in the righteous. If, elsewhere, he may have seemed to
dogmatize too accurately, and too closely to confine the dealings of
Almighty wisdom within the narrow tracks of human apprehension, they
will perceive but little of such a spirit here. They will find him here,
as in all his other Commentaries, a faithful and honest Expounder of
God’s Word, seeking to build upon it no theories of his own, but to
elicit in all sincerity and godly simplicity the instruction it was
intended to impart. The error into which he may most justly be accused
of falling, is not the making it assert too much but too little. The
fancies of the Rabbins and of the Allegorists were his aversion; and it
may be that he sometimes ran into the opposite extreme, and cleaved too
rigidly to the literal interpretation.

<span id="ii-p20"></span>But there is yet another reason why so firm an
upholder of the truth and authenticity of the Bible should have been
greatly interested in an exposition of the Pentateuch. Even before the
days of Calvin these precious Books had been a favorite point for the
unbeliever’s assaults. They had not, indeed, been so systematically
impugned as in these latter times; but still their credit had even then
been assailed with no inconsiderable subtlety, and particular points in
them had been subjected to severe and unfavorable criticism. Calvin’s
remarks are not unfrequently leveled directly against these adversaries;
but, apart from this direct advocacy of the truth, his labors indirectly
furnish one of the best barriers possible against the acceptance of the
notion, that the books of the Pentateuch were but a collection of
fragments, and by no means the production of a single Author. Nothing
can more satisfactorily prove the unity of these Books than that
homogeneous body of Truth into which Calvin has here resolved them.

<span id="ii-p21"></span>I had intended to offer some observations upon
the writers who have preceded and followed Calvin in his illustration of
this part of the Bible. I find, however, that the necessity of the case
would prevent me from presenting anything more than a mere
Bibliographical Catalogue, which it would be easy enough to draw up, but
which would here be somewhat out of place. It will be seen, that in the
brief illustrative notes appended to the text, many of them have been
referred to.

<span id="ii-p22"></span>For the Notes on the Hebrew words, etc., signed
W., I am indebted to my dear and venerable friend and neighbor, the Rev.
Henry Walter, B.D. and F.R.S., Rector of Hasilbury Bryan, Dorset,
formerly Fellow of St. John’s College, Cambridge, and Professor of
Natural Philosophy in the Honourable East India Company’s College at
Haileybury. It is no slight personal gratification to me to have my name
thus publicly associated with his; and I feel that it will operate with
those, who are acquainted with his valuable Writings, as a high
recommendation of the work.

<span id="ii-p23"></span>In the Notes, *C*. will signify Calvin; *L*.,
Luther; *S*.*M*., Sebastian Munster; LXX, the Septuagint; *A*.*V*., our
own Authorized Version; and *V*., the Latin Vulgate.
