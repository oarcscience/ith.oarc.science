<p class="TableText17"><a name="v.xxxiii-p7"></A><b>46.</b> On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt:</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText17"><a name="v.xxxiii-p8"></A><b>46.</b> Trans Jordanem in valle e regione Beth-peor in terra Sehon regis Emorrhaeorum, qui habitabat in Esbon: quem percussit Moses et filii Israel, quum egressi essent ex Aegypto.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p class="TableText17"><a name="v.xxxiii-p9"></A><b>47.</b> And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which <i>were </i>on this side Jordan, toward the sun-rising;</p>

<p class="TableText17"><a name="v.xxxiii-p13"></A><b>49.</b> And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.</p> 				   				
<p class="TableText17"><a name="v.xxxiii-p14"></A><b>49.</b> Et universam solitudinem trans Jordanem ad orientem usque ad mare planitiei, sub effusionibus aquarum.</p>

<p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="v.xxxiii-p16"></A><b>44.</b> <i>And this is the Law.</i> This last passage refers to the same thing, viz., that the Law was promulgated anew when the people had now reached the threshold of the promised land, in order that they might be more disposed to obedience, especially when the two tribes and a half had now, 			 by the conquest of the Amorites, obtained a resting-place and a home; for this is the reason why their habitation is mentioned, because the taste of the favor already received ought to stir up their zeal to proceed more cheerfully. We shall elsewhere remark on the country and names of places. It is sufficient here to recollect, that the memory of the Law was renewed, after their inheritance without the promised land had been obtained by the sons 			 of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, and when their assured possession was before the eyes of the rest. But Moses shews that, although he might explain the Law at fuller length, still nothing had been added to that summary which was originally promulgated; but he rather indicates, that whatever he had taught them during the forty years, had had no other object than that they might more faithfully and exactly keep the Law of God.</p>
