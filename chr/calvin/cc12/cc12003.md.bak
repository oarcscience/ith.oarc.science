<span id="iv-p1"></span>PSALM 120.

<span id="iv-p2"></span>A Song of Degrees.

<span id="iv-p3"></span>If we suppose David to have been the author of
this Psalm, as is very probable, he declares how diligently he engaged
in prayer, when, to escape the cruelty of Saul, he wandered as an exile
from place to place. But he especially complains of wicked informers,
who unjustly and calumniously charged him with crimes of which he was
altogether innocent. If a different supposition is preferred, the
language will be a simple and general complaint against false reports.
This Psalm, and the immediately subsequent fourteen, are called *Psalms
of Degrees;* but for what reason is not agreed upon, even among the
Hebrew doctors. Some conceive that there were fifteen steps to that part
of the Temple which was allotted for the men, whereas the women remained
beneath  <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) but this is a silly
conjecture, for. which there is no foundation; and we know the liberties
which the Jews, in obscure and uncertain matters like this, take of
giving forth as an explanation whatever comes into their own fancy. Some
translate *Psalms of Ascents;* and by *ascent* they understand the
return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity  <span
id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) — an interpretation which is altogether
forced; for it is manifest that the greater part of these Psalms were
composed, either by David or Solomon; and it is easy to gather from
their contents, that such of them as were written by David, were, sung
in the Temple, while he was alive and on the throne. Others think that
the word *ascents* refers to the tones of music  <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) Some also affirm that it was the
beginning of a song. This being a matter of small moment, I am not
disposed to make it the subject of elaborate investigation; but the
probable conjecture is, that this title was given to these Psalms,
because they were sung on a higher key than others. The Hebrew word for
*degrees* being derived from the verb <span id="iv-p6.1"></span>צלה,
*tsalah, to ascend* or *go up,* I agree with those who are of opinion
that it denotes the different musical notes rising in succession.  <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md)

<span id="iv.i"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
120:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p2"></span>**1.** I cried  <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) to Jehovah in my distress, and he
answered me. **2.** O Jehovah! deliver my soul from the lips  <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) of falsehood, and from the tongue of
deceit.  <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) **3.** What shall the
tongue of deceit  <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) give thee, and
what shall avail thee? **4.** The arrows of a strong man sharpened, with
coals of junipers.

<span id="iv.i-p7"></span> 

<span id="iv.i-p8"></span><span id="iv.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p9"></span>**1.** *I cried to Jehovah in my distress.*
The name of the author of the Psalm is not expressed, but the style of
it throughout presents David to our view. Although, therefore, I cannot
positively affirm, yet I am rather inclined to think that it was
composed by him. Nor will it be improper, in my judgment, to explain it
as if his name had been mentioned in the inscription. This, then, being
granted, I would observe that although David, when in this verse he
affirms that the Lord had heard him, gives thanks to him, yet his chief
purpose was to set forth, in the form of complaint, how wickedly and
cruelly Saul’s flatterers employed all their ingenuity and power to
accomplish his destruction. He, however, sets out with an expression of
his gratitude to God, telling us that he had not called upon Him in
vain; and he does this, that by his own example he might encourage
others, especially when oppressed with adversity, to confidence in
prayer. Men, it is true, have need of God’s help every moment; but there
is not a more suitable season for seeking him than when some great
danger is immediately menacing us. It is therefore worthy of notice,
that he was heard when, constrained and shut up by tribulation, he
betook himself to the protection of God.

<span id="iv.i-p10"></span><span id="iv.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p11"></span>**2.** *O Jehovah! deliver my soul from the
lip of falsehood.* David now points out the kind of his affliction,
declaring that he was loaded with false accusations. In charging his
enemies with lying and falsehood, he asserts his own innocence of the
crimes which they slanderously imputed to him. His complaint therefore
amounts to this, that as he was conscious of having committed no fault,
he was assaulted *by* the wicked contrary to all law, human and divine,
and that they brought him into hatred without his having given them any
occasion for such injurious treatment. Deceitful tongues assault good
and simple people in two ways’ they either circumvent them by wiles and
snares, or wound their reputation by calumnies. It is of the second way
that the Prophet here complains. Now if David, who was endued with such
eminent virtue, and free from every mark of disgrace, and far removed
from every *wicked* action, was yet assailed with contumely, is it to be
wondered at if the children of God in the present day labor under false
accusations, and that when they have endeavored to conduct themselves
uprightly they are yet in reported of? As they have the devil for their
enemy, it is indeed impossible for them to escape being loaded with his
lies. Yea, we see that slanderous tongues did not spare even the Son of
God — a consideration which should induce us to bear the more patiently
our condition, when the wicked traduce us undeservedly; since it is
certain that we have here described the common lot of the whole Church.

<span id="iv.i-p12"></span><span id="iv.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p13"></span>**3.** *What shall the tongue of deceit give
thee?*  <span id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) The Prophet aggravates the
malice of his enemies by asserting that they were so wickedly inclined
as to be driven to evil speaking when they saw no prospect of deriving
any advantage from such a course of conduct. He however seems to express
more than this, — he seems farther to intimate, that after they have
poured forth all the venom of their calumnies, their attempts will
nevertheless be vain and ineffectual. As God is the maintainer of the
innocence of his servants, David, inspired with hope from this truth,
rises up against them with heroic courage, as if about to triumph over
the whole crowd of his calumniators,  <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) reproaching them for doing nothing else
than betraying an impotent passion for evil speaking, which God at
length would cause to recoil upon their own heads. It is a consideration
well fitted to assuage the grief of all the godly, when their good name
is unrighteously wounded by calumniators, that such malicious characters
will gain nothing thereby in the end, because God will disappoint their
expectation.

<span id="iv.i-p16"></span><span id="iv.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iv.i-p17"></span>**4.** *The arrows of a strong man sharpened,
with coals of juniper.* Here the Psalmist amplifies in another way the
malice of such as distress the simple and innocent by their calumnies,
affirming that they throw out their injurious reports just like a man
who should draw an arrow, and with it pierce through the body of his
neighbor; and that their calumnies were like *coals of juniper,*  <span
id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) which penetrate more effectually, and
burn more intensely the substances with which they come in contact than
the coals of any other kind of wood. The amount is, that the tongues of
these slanderers were inflamed with the burning heat of fire, and, as it
were, dipped in deadly poison; and that such persons were the less
excusable, from the fact that, without deriving any advantage from it,
they were impelled by an unbridled passion to inflict upon others deadly
mischief. As the Prophet records nothing here which he did not
experience in his own person, it may be inferred that if it behoved him
and men of a similar character to be assailed by their enemies with
lies, which were to them as arrows to pierce them, or coals to burn
them, we need not be surprised at seeing the most eminent servants of
God exercised with similar assaults.

<span id="iv.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
120:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa120.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p2"></span>**5.** Alas for me! that I have been a
sojourner  <span id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) in Mesech, and have
dwelt among the tents of Kedar. **6.** My soul hath long dwelt with him
who hateth peace. **7.** I am for peace; and when I speak they are for
war.  <span id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md)

<span id="iv.ii-p5"></span> 

<span id="iv.ii-p6"></span><span id="iv.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p7"></span>**5.** *Alas for me! that I have been a
sojourner in Mesech.* David complains that he was doomed to linger for a
long time among a perverse people; his condition resembling that of some
wretched individual who is compelled to live till he grows old in
sorrowful exile. The Mesechites and Kedarenes, as is well known, were
Eastern tribes; the former of which derived their original from Japhet,
as Moses informs us in <span id="iv.ii-p7.1"></span>[Ge
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#002.md)<span id="iv.ii-p7.1"></span>; and
the latter from a son of Ishmael. (<span id="iv.ii-p7.2"></span>[Ge
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#013)<span id="iv.ii-p7.2"></span>..md)
To take the latter for a people of Italy, who were anciently called
Hetrurians, is altogether absurd, and without the least color of
probability, Some ‘would have the word Mesech to be an appellative noun;
and because <span id="iv.ii-p7.3"></span>מש *mashak,* signifies *to
draw, to protract,* they think that the Prophet bewails his protracted
banishment, of the termination of which he saw no prospect.  <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) But as immediately after he adds *Kedar,*
by which term the Ishmaelites are unquestionably intended, I have no
doubt that *Mesech* is to be understood of the Arabians who were their
neighbors. If any one is of opinion that the Mesechites obtained this
name from their dexterity in shooting with the bow, I will make no
objections, provided it is admitted that the Prophet — as if he had been
confined within a country of robbers — expresses the irksomeness of an
uncomfortable and an annoying place of residence. Although he names the
Arabians, yet under the terms employed he speaks metaphorically of his
own countrymen, just as he elsewhere applies the appellation of Gentiles
to the corrupt and degenerate Jews.  <span
id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) But here, with the view of putting still
more dishonor upon his enemies, he has purposely selected the name by
which to designate them from some of the savage and barbarous nations
whose horrible cruelty was well known to the Jews. From these words we
are taught, that scarcely a more distressing evil can befall the people
of God, than for them to be placed in circumstances which,
notwithstanding their living a holy and an inoffensive life, they yet
cannot escape the calumnies of venomous tongues. It is to be observed,
that although David was living in his own country, he yet was a stranger
in it, nothing being more grievous to him than to be in the company of
wicked men. Hence we learn that no sin is more detestable to God, by
whose Spirit David spake, than the false accusations which shamefully
deface the beauty of God’s Church, and lay it waste, causing it to
differ little from the dens of robbers, or other places rendered
infamous from the barbarous cruelty of which they are the scene. Now if
the place where the uprightness of good men is overwhelmed by the
criminations of lying lips is to the children of God converted into a
region of miserable exile, how could they have pleasure, or rather, how
could they fail to feel the bitterest sorrow, in abiding in a part of
the world where the sacred name of God is shamefully profaned by
horrible blasphemies, and his truth obscured by detestable lies? David
exclaims, *Alas for me!* because, dwelling among false brethren and a
bastard race of Abraham, he was wrongfully molested and tormented by
them, although he had behaved himself towards them in good conscience.
 <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) Since, then, at the present day,
in the Church of Rome, religion is dishonored by all manner of
disgraceful imputations, faith torn in pieces, light turned into
darkness, and the majesty of God exposed to the grossest mockeries, it
will certainly be impossible for those who have any feeling of true
piety within them to lie in the midst of such pollutions without great
anguish of spirit.

<span id="iv.ii-p11"></span><span id="iv.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p12"></span>**6.** *My soul*  <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) *hath long dwelt with him who hateth
peace.* The Psalmist now shows, without figure, and, so to speak, points
with the finger to those  <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) whom he
had before indirectly marked out by the terms *Mesech* and *kedar,*
namely, the perfidious Israelites, who had degenerated from the holy
fathers, and who rather wore the mask of Israelites than were the true
seed of Israel.  <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) He calls them
*haters of peace,*  <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) because they
wilfully, and with deliberate malice, set themselves to make war upon
the good and unoffending. To the same purpose he adds immediately after,
that his heart was strongly inclined to seek after peace, or rather,
that he was wholly devoted to it, and had tried every means in order to
win their favor, but that the implacable cruelty of their disposition
invariably impelled them to do him mischief. When he says, *I peace,* it
is an abrupt, yet not an obscure expression, implying that he had not
done them any injury or wrong which could give occasion for their hatred
there having been always peace on his part. He even proceeds farther,
asserting, that when he saw them inflamed with resentment against him,
he endcavourcd to pacify them, and to bring them to a good
understanding; for *to speak,* is here equivalent to offering conditions
of peace in an amicable spirit, or to treating of reconciliation. From
this it is still more apparent, how savage and brutal was the pride of
David’s enemies, since they disdained even to speak with him — to speak
with a man who had deserved well at their hands, and who had never in
any respect injured them. We are taught by his example, that it is not
enough for the faithful to abstain from hurting others: they must,
moreover, study to allure them by gentleness, and to bend them to good
will. Should their moderation and kindness be rejected, let them wait in
patience, until God at length show himself from heaven as their
protector. Let us, however, remember, that if God does not immediately
stretch forth his hand in our behalf, it is our duty to bear the
wearisomeness occasioned by delay, like David, whom we find in this
Psalm giving, thanks to God for his deliverance, while, at the same
time, as if worn out with the weariness of waiting for it, he bewails
the long oppression to which he had been subjected by his enemies.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[42](cc12003.htm#fr_41.md) <span
id="iv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iv-p4"></span> This opinion was held by Rabbi David Kimchi;
and he asserts that the Psalms, entitled Songs of Ascents or Steps, were
so entitled because the Levites sang one of them upon each of the
fifteen steps, which, says *he,* separated the court of the women from
that of the men in Solomon’s Temple. This Calvin justly characterizes as
a “silly conjecture;” and such an explanation is now generally rejected.
Jebb, after stating several of the attempted solutions of the title of
these Psalms, observes — “On these notions it is unnecessary to dwell,
and still less upon that Jewish fable mentioned by Rabbi David, that
these Psalms were sung on ascending the fifteen steps, which were
imagined to lead from one of the outer courts of the Temple to that of
the Levites. No trace in history, or authentic tradition, can be found
of these steps, which owe their construction solely to the accommodating
fancy of the Rabbins, who, as usual, imagined facts, in order to support
their preconceived theories.” — *Jebb’s Literal Translation of the
Psalms, with Dissertations,* volume 2. It is an additional objection to
this Rabbinical conceit, that David, whose name several of these Psalms
bear — and others of which have evident reference to his time and
circumstances — lived in the time of the tabernacle, which had no steps.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[43](cc12003.htm#fr_42.md) <span
id="iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="iv-p5"></span> The Syriac version calls them “Songs of Ascent
out of Babylon;” and such is the interpretation of several modern
critics, among whom is Calmet, who has given an able analysis of what
has been written on this title in his <span
id="iv-p5.1"></span>*Dissertation sur les quinze Psaumes Gradue* After
stating numerous explanations, and characterizing many of them as “<span
id="iv-p5.2"></span>vaines et frivoles conjectures,” he adopts it as the
most probable supposition, that they were sung during the journey of the
returning captives from Babylon to Jerusalem.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[44](cc12003.htm#fr_43.md) <span
id="iv-p5.3"></span>

<span id="iv-p6"></span> This is the opinion of Aben Ezra.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[45](cc12003.htm#fr_44.md) <span
id="iv-p6.2"></span>

<span id="iv-p7"></span> While Calvin leans to this as the most probable
explanation, he has before admitted that it is only a conjecture; and
after all that has been said since his time on the subject, it is still
involved in obscurity, and perhaps it is now impossible to arrive at a
satisfactory conclusion. The Psalms, however, which bear this title,
have a striking resemblance to each other, and are different in style
from the other divine Poems in this book. They are all very short, and
in several of them there is a gradation of meaning, and a degree of
point towards the dose, which may be called epigrammatic. Hence Gesenius
suggests that the title may mark a peculiar species of Hebrew
composition. “The construction of the songs” \[of degrees,\] says Jebb,
“is such as to reduce the evidently to a class. They are all short
compositions, sententious, eminently fitted for lyrical use, in the
highest degree poetical, and, as Calmet justly remarks, epigramrustic;
using this term in its highest sense as concinnate, terse, and abounding
in turns expressed with the most exquisite brevity. Two remarkable
characteristics they possess, which, though found occasionally in other
Psalms, seem to enter into the very texture of these — I mean the
frequent recurrence of a characteristic word, and that figure which the
rhetoricians call *Epanaphora,* or the repetition of the same idea or
expression. As to the characteristic words: In <span
id="iv-p7.1"></span>[Psalm 121](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv-p7.1"></span> this is the word *keep* (<span
id="iv-p7.2"></span>שמר); in <span id="iv-p7.3"></span>[Psalm
122](../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#000.md)<span id="iv-p7.3"></span> the word
*Salem,* and others of a like sound; in <span id="iv-p7.4"></span>[Psalm
123](../../../bib/kjv/psa123.htm#000.md)<span id="iv-p7.4"></span> the word
*eyes,* <span id="iv-p7.5"></span>עיני, in <span
id="iv-p7.6"></span>[Psalm 126](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#000.md)<span
id="iv-p7.6"></span> the words *turn* and *captivity,* which in Hebrew
are almost the same, <span id="iv-p7.7"></span>םרב and <span
id="iv-p7.8"></span>שיבה in <span id="iv-p7.9"></span>[Psalm

same as that of <span id="iv.i-p5.2"></span>לשון רמיה, *tongue of

<span id="iv.i-p18"></span> The Hebrew word <span
id="iv.i-p18.1"></span>רתם, *rothem,* here rendered “*juniper,*” occurs
also in <span id="iv.i-p18.2"></span>[1 Kings
19:4](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#005.md)<span id="iv.i-p18.2"></span>, and
<span id="iv.i-p18.3"></span>[Job
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#004.md)<span id="iv.i-p18.3"></span>, in
both which places it is translated in our English Bible by
“juniper-tree.” It would appear that this shrub was remarkable for the
intense flame with which it burned, and for the length of time during
which its embers retained their heat. Several critics, however, think
that the Hebrew *rothem* means the genista or Spanish broom; and in
support of this opinion it is said that the genista is much used as fuel
by the Arabs, among whom the Psalmist describes himself as then living;
and that, as Geierus asserts, it” sparkles, burns, and crackles more
vehemently than any other wood.” (See Parkhurst on <span
id="iv.i-p18.4"></span>רתם.) It is somewhat difficult to decide in this
matter. As more than thirty different trees are mentioned in the Bible,
and as we are but imperfectly acquainted with the natural history of
these remote countries, it is no wonder though we find it impossible to
identify all these trees. It may be observed that Calvin in his
translation brings out that beautiful gradation of sense, terminating in
a point of severity, for which the Hebrew text is remarkable, but which
does not appear in our English version. Slanderous words are first
compared to “arrows,” secondly, to “arrows discharged from the bow by a
strong man,” and in proportion to the strength of a man will be the
force with which his weapon strikes; next to “sharp arrows;” and lastly,
to “coals of juniper,” or some wood used in those days celebrated for
burning fiercely and long, (for the particle <span
id="iv.i-p18.5"></span>עם*, im* translated *with,* is sometimes one of
similitude, as in <span id="iv.i-p18.6"></span>[Ps
106:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.i-p18.6"></span>,
“We have sinned *like as* our fathers,”) intimating not only that
malignant slanders deeply penetrate, but that they inflame and burn for
a long time. Hence the Apostle James (<span id="iv.i-p18.7"></span>[Jas.
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#006)<span id="iv.i-p18.7"></span>.md)
compares the tongue of slander to a fire enkindled from hell, and
inflaming the course of nature. Some interpreters think that this verse
is not to be understood as a description of calumny, but rather as the
punishment which God will inflict on the calumniator. They therefore
regard it as an answer to the question in the preceding verse, “What
shall be given unto thee,” etc.; observing that calumny and falsehood
being frequently represented by the images of arrows and fire, the same
images suitably express the requital which awaits them at the hand of
God — the swift and terrible retributive vengeance of the Almighty,
which will overtake all who practice falsehood and slander. See <span
id="iv.i-p18.8"></span>[Ps 57:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#004.md)<span

“Sharp arrows of the Mighty One, with coals of juniper,” await them.
This opinion is adopted by Street, Mant, Morison, Paxton, Fry, French
and Skinner. Calvin’s exposition is embraced by Walford and Phillips.
The former, to elicit this meaning the more clearly, uses a supplement:

<span id="iv.i-p19"></span>*“Sharp arrows of a warrior,  
And burning coals of juniper,* thou resemblest.*”*

<span id="iv.i-p20"></span>He, however, in a footnote requests the
reader “to observe, that this is given as what seems to be the most
probable interpretation of the passage, though it cannot be regarded as
absolutely certain.”

<span id="iv.ii-p3"></span> “<span id="iv.ii-p3.1"></span>C’est, en

<span id="iv.ii-p4"></span> Literally it is, “I peace; and when I speak,
they for war.”

<span id="fn_54"></span>[55](cc12003.htm#fr_54.md) <span
id="iv.ii-p7.4"></span>

<span id="iv.ii-p8"></span> This is the sense in which the word is
rendered in most of the ancient versions. Thus the Septuagint has <span
id="iv.ii-p8.1"></span>ἡ παροικία μρυ ἐμακρύνθη, “my sojourning is
protracted;” and it is followed by the Syriac, Vulgate, and Arabic
versions. Aquila has <span id="iv.ii-p8.2"></span>προσηλύτευσα ἐν
μακρυσμῷ I was a stranger for a long time;” and Symmachus, <span
id="iv.ii-p8.3"></span>παροικῶν παρίλκυσα “I have protracted
sojourning.” Bishop Patrick and Dr. Hammond, following these
authorities, render <span id="iv.ii-p8.4"></span>משך*, mesech,*
adverbially. But though this is a meaning which the word will bear, yet
as Calvin observes, there is little room for doubting that it is here a
proper name. The parallelism which enables us in many instances to
determine the accurate interpretation of a word in Hebrew poetry when
other helps entirely fail, decidedly favors this interpretation. The
term corresponding to <span id="iv.ii-p8.5"></span>משך *mesech,* in the
next hemistich, is <span id="iv.ii-p8.6"></span>קרר *kedar*; and as it
is universally admitted that this is the name of a place, it cannot be
justly questioned that such is also the case with respect to <span
id="iv.ii-p8.7"></span>משך *mesech.* To render it otherwise is
destructive of the poetical structure of the passage. “If,” says
Phillips, “the adverbial sense be intended, then the expression should
not have been <span id="iv.ii-p8.8"></span>גרתי משך, but something
analogous to <span id="iv.ii-p8.9"></span>רבת שכנה in the next verse.
Many localities have been mentioned for the geography of Mesech, as
Tuscany, Cappadocia, Armenia, etc., which proves that the particular
district called by this name is uncertain.” It is however obvious that
some barbarous and brutal tribes of Arabs are intended.

<span id="iv.ii-p9"></span> A similar mode of speaking is not uncommon
in our own day. Thus we are accustomed to call gross and ignorant people
Turks and Hottentots.

<span id="iv.ii-p16"></span> In describing those among whom he was now
living as *haters of peace,* and, in the next verse, as bent on war, the
inspired writer probably still alludes to the Arab tribes he had
specified in the 5th verse, who have, from their origin to the present
hour, been eminently characterized by their hatred of peace and
propensity to war. Dr. Shaw thus writes concerning these barbarous
tribes as they are to be found in our own day, and their character and
habits were the same at the time when this Psalm was written: “The Arabs
are naturally thievish and treacherous; and it sometimes happens, that
those very persons are overtaken and pillaged in the morning who were
entertained the night before with all the instances of friendship and
hospitality. Neither are they to be accused for plundering strangers
only, and attacking almost every person whom they find unarmed and
defenceless, but for those many implacable and hereditary animosities
which continually subsist among them: literally fulfilling the prophecy
to Hagar, that ‘Ishmael should be a wild man; his hand should be against
every man, and every man’s hand against him.’”
