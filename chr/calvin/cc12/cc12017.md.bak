<span id="xviii"></span>

<span id="xviii-p1"></span>PSALM 134

<span id="xviii-p2"></span>An exhortation to praise God, addressed to
the people of God generally, but more particularly to the Priests and
Levites.

<span id="xviii-p3"></span>A Song of Degrees.

<span id="xviii.i"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p1"></span><span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
134:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa134.htm#001.md)<span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Behold! bless ye Jehovah, all ye
servants of Jehovah, who stand nightly in the house of Jehovah. **2.**
Lift up your hands towards the sanctuary,  <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) and bless Jehovah. **3.** Jehovah
bless thee out of Zion, who made heaven and earth!

<span id="xviii.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="xviii.i-p5"></span><span id="xviii.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p6"></span>**1.** *Behold! bless ye Jehovah.* Some
interpreters think, that others besides the Levites are here intended,
and it must be granted, at least, that some of the more zealous of the
people remained over night in the Temple, as we read (<span
id="xviii.i-p6.1"></span>[Lu 2:37](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#037.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p6.1"></span>) of Anna, a widow, “who served God constantly
with prayers night and day.”  <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md)
But it is evident, from the close of the Psalm, that the inspired penman
addresses priests only, since he prescribes the form of benediction
which they were to offer up for the people, and this was a duty
belonging exclusively to the Priests. It would appear then, that the
Levites are here called servants of God, from the functions they
discharged, being specially appointed, and that by turns, to watch by
night in the Temple, as we read in the inspired history.  <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) (<span id="xviii.i-p8.6"></span>[Le
8:35](../../../bib/kjv/lev008.htm#035)<span id="xviii.i-p8.6"></span>..md)
The Psalm begins with the demonstrative adverb Behold! setting the
matter of their duty before their eyes, for they were to be stimulated
to devotion by looking constantly to the Temple. We are to notice the
Psalmist’s design in urging the duty of praise so earnestly upon them.
Many of the Levites, through the tendency which there is in all men to
abuse ceremonies, considered that nothing more was necessary than
standing idly in the Temple, and thus overlooked the principal part of
their duty. The Psalmist would show that merely to keep nightly watch
over the Temple, kindle the lamps, and superintend the sacrifices, was
of no importance, unless they served God spiritually, and referred all
outward ceremonies to that which must be considered the main sacrifice ­
the celebration of God’s praises. You may think it a very laborious
service, as if he had said, to stand at watch in the Temple, while
others sleep in their own houses; but the worship which God requires is
something more excellent than this, and demands of you to sing his
praises before all the people. In the second verse he reminds them in
addition, of the form observed in calling upon the name of the Lord. For
why do men *lift their hands* when they pray? Is it not that their
hearts may be raised at the same time to God?  <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) It is thus that the Psalmist takes
occasion to reprehend their carelessness in either standing idle in the
Temple, or trifling and indulging in vain conversation, and thus failing
to worship God in a proper manner.

<span id="xviii.i-p10"></span><span id="xviii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p11"></span>**3.** *Jehovah bless thee out of Zion!*
We have conclusive proof in my opinion from this verse that the Psalm is
to be considered as referring to the priests and Levites only, for to
them it properly belonged under the law to bless the people. (<span
id="xviii.i-p11.1"></span>[Nu
6:23](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023)<span id="xviii.i-p11.1"></span>..md)
The Psalmist had first told them to bless God; now he tells them to
bless the people in his name. Not that God meant by any such injunction
that the people might themselves indulge in a life of carnal security ­
an opinion prevalent among the Papists, who think that if the monks
chant in the temples, this is all the worship necessary on the part of
the whole body of the people. What God intended was, that the priests
should lead the way in divine service, and the people take example by
what was done in the temple, and practice it individually in their
private houses. The duty of blessing the people was enjoined upon the
priests, as representing Christ’s person. Express mention is
intentionally made of two things, which are in themselves distinct, when
the God who blessed them out of Zion is said to be also the Creator of
heaven and earth. Mention is made of his title as *Creator* to set forth
his power, and convince believers there is nothing that may not be hoped
from God. For what is the world but a mirror in which we see his
boundless power? And those must be senseless persons indeed, that are
not satisfied with the favor of Him who is recognized by them as having
all dominion and all riches in his hand. Since many, however, are apt,
when they hear God spoken of as Creator, to conceive of him as standing
at a distance from them, and doubt their access to him, the Psalmist
makes mention also of that which was a symbol of God’s nearness to his
people ­ and this that they might be encouraged to approach him with the
freedom and unrestrained confidence of persons who are invited to come
to the bosom of a Father. By looking to the heavens, then, they were to
discover the power of God ­ by looking to Zion, his dwelling­place, they
were to recognize his fatherly love.

<span id="xviii.i-p3"></span> “<span id="xviii.i-p3.1"></span>קדש. Some
persons render this word as if it were an adverb. So Tilingins has
‘<span id="xviii.i-p3.2"></span>Attollite manus vestras sanete.’ There
is no doubt, that lifting up the hands reverently, is the ordinary and
proper posture of suppliants at the throne of grace. Farther, St. Paul,
in <span id="xviii.i-p3.3"></span>[1Ti
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#008.md)<span id="xviii.i-p3.3"></span>,
apparently with reference to this passage, speaks of *lifting up holy
hands.* The Septuagint and Syriac, however, have taken the word as a
noun, signifying *the sanctuary;* the former have <span
id="xviii.i-p3.4"></span>ἅγια.” *­ Phillips.* Warner and Cress, well
with Calvin would read “towards the sanctuary;” *i.e.,* towards the holy
of holies, where the ark, the symbol of the Divine presence, was fixed.

<span id="xviii.i-p7"></span> “We know generally,” says Fry, “that there
was a nightly service in the Temple, (<span id="xviii.i-p7.1"></span>[2
Chronicles 21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#000.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p7.1"></span>:) and Kimchi, a Jewish writer, represents
those who by night stand in the house of the Lord, as holy men who rose
from their beds in the night and went to pray in the Temple.” After
referring to the case of “Anna, a Prophetess,” he adds, “And St. Paul,
before Agrippa, speaking ‘of the hope of the promise made unto the
fathers,’ gives us this remarkable description: ‘unto which our’ twelve
tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. There was
public service in the Temple at Jerusalem not only by day but by night;
which latter service many of the Jews, for whose special use this and
the next Psalm seem to have been composed, were in the habit of
attending.” *­ Cresswell.*

<span id="xviii.i-p8"></span> *Ye servants off the Lord,* etc., i.e., ye
Levites, whose duty it was, according to the Talmudists, to keep watch
by night, standing in the Temple: the High Priest was the only one who
sat in the Temple. Compare <span id="xviii.i-p8.1"></span>[Le
