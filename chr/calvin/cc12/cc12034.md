<span id="xxxv-p1"></span>A NEW TRANSLATION OF

<span id="xxxv-p2"></span>THE BOOK OF PSALMS.

<span id="xxxv.i"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i-p2"></span>PSALMS 1—35

<span id="xxxv.i-p3"></span>PART FIRST.  <span

<span id="xxxv.i.i"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.i-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.i-p2"></span>PSALM 1

<span id="xxxv.i.i-p3"></span>**1** Blessed *is* the man who walketh not
in the counsel of the ungodly; And in the way of sinners doth not stand;
And in the seat of scoffers doth not sit:

<span id="xxxv.i.i-p4"></span>**2** But in the law of the Lord *is* his
delight; And in his law doth he meditate day and night.

<span id="xxxv.i.i-p5"></span>**3** He shall be like a tree planted near
rivers of waters, Which shall yield its fruit in its season, And whose
leaf shall not fade; And all that he doeth shall prosper.

<span id="xxxv.i.i-p6"></span>**4** Not so the ungodly: But they are
like the chaff, which scatter doth the wind.

<span id="xxxv.i.i-p7"></span>**5** Therefore shall not stand the
ungodly in the judgment, Nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

<span id="xxxv.i.i-p8"></span>**6** For know doth Jehovah the way of the
righteous; But the way of the ungodly shall perish.

<span id="xxxv.i.ii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p2"></span>PSALM 2

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p3"></span>**1** Why tumultuously rise do the
Gentiles, And the peoples murmur in vain?

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p4"></span>**2** Confederated have the kings of the
earth, And the princes have assembled together, Against Jehovah and
against his Christ.

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p5"></span>**3** “Let us break asunder their bonds,
“And cast away from us their yoke.”

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p6"></span>**4** He who dwelleth in heaven shall
laugh; The Lord shall deride them.

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p7"></span>**5** Then shall he speak to them in his
wrath, And in his hot displeasure he shall vex them.

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p8"></span>**6** “I have anointed my king, “Upon
Zion, the mountain of my holiness.”

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p9"></span>**7** I will declare the decree: Jehovah
hath said to me, “My Son art thou; I, this day, have begotten thee.

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p10"></span>**8** “Ask of me, and I will give thee
the Gentiles for thy inheritance, “And for thy possession the uttermost
parts of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p11"></span>**9** “Thou shalt break them with a rod
of iron;” As the vessel of a potter thou shalt dash them in pieces.”

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p12"></span>**10** And now, O ye kings! understand;
Be instructed, O ye judges of the earth!

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p13"></span>**11** Serve Jehovah with fear, Rejoice
with trembling.

<span id="xxxv.i.ii-p14"></span>**12** Kiss the Son, lest he be angry,
And ye perish from the way, When shall be kindled in a short time his
wrath. Blessed are all who trust in him.

<span id="xxxv.i.iii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.iii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.iii-p2"></span>PSALM 3

<span id="xxxv.i.iii-p3"></span>A Psalm of David, when he fled from the
face of Absalom his son

<span id="xxxv.i.iii-p4"></span>**1** O Lord! how are my oppressors
multiplied! Many rise up against me,

<span id="xxxv.i.iii-p5"></span>**2** Many say to my soul, “There is no
help for him in God.” Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.iii-p6"></span>**3** And thou, O Jehovah! art a shield
for me; My glory, and he that exalteth my head.

<span id="xxxv.i.iii-p7"></span>**4** With my voice to the Lord have I
cried, And he heard me from the mountain of his holiness. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.iii-p8"></span>**5** I lay down and slept; I awaked,
because the Lord sustains me.

<span id="xxxv.i.iii-p9"></span>**6** I will not be afraid of ten
thousands of people, Who on all sides have set their camps against me.

<span id="xxxv.i.iii-p10"></span>**7** Arise, O Lord l Save me, O my
God! For thou hast smitten all my enemies upon the cheekbone; The teeth
of the ungodly thou hast broken.

<span id="xxxv.i.iii-p11"></span>**8** To the Lord belongeth salvation;
Upon thy people *is* thy blessing. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.iv"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.iv-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.iv-p2"></span>PSALM 4

<span id="xxxv.i.iv-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician on Neginoth. A
Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.i.iv-p4"></span>**1** When I cry, answer me, O God of my
righteousness! In distress thou hast enlarged me; Have pity upon me, and
hear my prayer.

<span id="xxxv.i.iv-p5"></span>**2** O ye sons of men! how long my glory
will ye try to put to shame? Will ye love vanity, will ye seek after
lying? Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.iv-p6"></span>**3** But know that chosen hath Jehovah
the merciful man for himself: Jehovah will hear when I cry unto him.

<span id="xxxv.i.iv-p7"></span>**4** Tremble and ye shall not sin;
Discourse in your heart upon your bed, and be silent. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.iv-p8"></span>**5** Sacrifice the sacrifices of
righteousness, And trust in the Lord.

<span id="xxxv.i.iv-p9"></span>**6** Many say, “Who will show us good?”
Lift thou up on us the light of thy countenance, O Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.i.iv-p10"></span>**7** Thou hast given joy to my heart
More than *theirs* in the time that their corn and their wine are
increased.

<span id="xxxv.i.iv-p11"></span>**8** In peace \[*as if*\] with a
multitude I will sleep and take rest,  <span
id="fr_312"></span>[313](#fn_312) For thou, O Jehovah! in safety hast
placed me, \[*though*\] alone.

<span id="xxxv.i.v"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p2"></span>PSALM 5

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p3"></span>To the Chief. Musician upon Nehiloth. A
Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p4"></span>**1** My words do thou give ear to, O
Jehovah! Attend to my speech.

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p5"></span>**2** Hearken to the voice of my cry, my
King and my God! For to thee will I pray.

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p6"></span>**3** O Jehovah! in the morning do thou
hear my voice; In the morning will I direct to thee and will watch.

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p7"></span>**4** For not a God taking pleasure in
wickedness art thou; There shall not dwell with thee evil.

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p8"></span>**5** There shall not stand the foolish
before thine eyes; Thou hatest all that commit iniquity.

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p9"></span>**6** Thou shalt destroy them that speak
falsehood: The man of bloods and the deceitful man abominate shall
Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p10"></span>**7** And I, in the multitude of thy
mercy, will enter into thy house; I will worship in thy holy temple in
thy fear.

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p11"></span>**8** O Jehovah! lead me in thy
righteousness, because of my adversaries; Make straight before my face
thy way.

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p12"></span>**9** For there is not in their mouth
uprightness; Their inward part is deep depravity; A sepulcher that is
open is their throat; With their tongues they deal deceitfully.

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p13"></span>**10** Cause them to err, O God! Let them
fall from their counsels; In the multitude of their transgressions
destroy them; For they have rebelled against thee.

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p14"></span>**11** And rejoice let all those who
trust in thee, For ever let them exult; and cover thou them, And let
those delight in thee that love thy name.

<span id="xxxv.i.v-p15"></span>**12** For thou shalt bless the
righteous, O Jehovah! With thy good will as with a shield thou shalt
encompass them.

<span id="xxxv.i.vi"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p2"></span>PSALM 6

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician on Neginoth, upon
the Eighth. A Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p4"></span>**1** O Jehovah! do not in thy anger
rebuke me, And do not in thy wrath chastise me.

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p5"></span>**2** Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah! for
I am weak; Heal me, O Jehovah! for affrighted are my bones.

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p6"></span>**3** And my soul is exceedingly afraid:
And thou, O Jehovah! — how long? —

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p7"></span>**4** Return, O Lord! deliver my soul;
Save me for the sake of thy mercy.

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p8"></span>**5** For there is not in death any
remembrance of thee; In the grave who shall acknowledge thee?

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p9"></span>**6** I have become wearied with my
groaning; I make to swim every night my bed; With my tears my couch I
water.

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p10"></span>**7** Waxed dim for vexation hath mine
eye; It hath become old among all my persecutors.

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p11"></span>**8** Depart from me, all ye workers of
iniquity; For heard hath the Lord the voice of my weeping.

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p12"></span>**9** Heard hath the Lord my
supplication; The Lord my prayer will receive.

<span id="xxxv.i.vi-p13"></span>**10** Put to shame and confounded
greatly be all my enemies; Let them turn back, and be ashamed suddenly.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p2"></span>PSALM 7

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p3"></span>Shiggaion of David, which he sung to
Jehovah, upon the words  
of Cush the Benjamite

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p4"></span>**1** O Jehovah, my God! in thee do I
trust: Save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p5"></span>**2** Lest He seize, as a lion, upon my
soul, And tear it in pieces while there is none to deliver it.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p6"></span>**3** O Jehovah, my God! if I have done
this, If there be iniquity in my hands,

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p7"></span>**4** If I have rewarded to him that was
at peace with me evil, And have not delivered him that afflicted me
without cause;

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p8"></span>**5** Pursue let the enemy my soul and
take it, And let him cast down to the earth my life, And my glory in the
dust let him hold down. Selah

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p9"></span>**6** Arise, O Jehovah! in thy anger;
Lift up thyself against the fury of my enemies; And awake thou for me to
the judgment which thou hast ordained.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p10"></span>**7** And the congregation of peoples
shall be round about thee: And on account of this, do thou on high
return.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p11"></span>**8** Jehovah shall judge the peoples:
Judge me, O Jehovah! according to my righteousness, And according to the
integrity which is in me.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p12"></span>**9** Let come to an end, I pray, the
malice of the wicked; And direct thou the righteous man: For he proves
the hearts and the reins, the righteous God.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p13"></span>**10** My shield is in God, Who saves
the upright in heart.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p14"></span>**11** God judgeth the righteous man,
And him who despiseth God, daily.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p15"></span>**12** If he turn not, his sword he
will whet; His bow he hath bent, he hath made it ready.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p16"></span>**13** And for it he hath prepared the
instruments of death; He shall make fit his arrows for the persecutors.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p17"></span>**14** Behold! he shall travail to
bring forth iniquity, And he hath conceived wickedness, And he shall
bring forth falsehood.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p18"></span>**15** A pit he hath digged, and
hollowed it out; And he hath fallen into the ditch which he hath made.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p19"></span>**16** Return shall his wickedness upon
his own head, And upon his own crown his violence shall descend.

<span id="xxxv.i.vii-p20"></span>**17** I will praise Jehovah, according
to his righteousness; And I will sing to the name of Jehovah, Most High.

<span id="xxxv.i.viii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.viii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.viii-p2"></span>PSALM 8

<span id="xxxv.i.viii-p3"></span>To the chief Musician upon Hagittith. A
Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.i.viii-p4"></span>**1** O Jehovah, our Lord! How
wonderful is thy name in all the earth, To set thy glory above the
heavens!

<span id="xxxv.i.viii-p5"></span>**2** Out of the mouths of babes and
sucklings Thou hast founded *thy* strength, because of thy adversaries,
To put to flight the enemy and the avenger.

<span id="xxxv.i.viii-p6"></span>**3** When! see thy heavens, the works
of thy fingers; The moon and the stars which thou hast arranged:

<span id="xxxv.i.viii-p7"></span>**4** What is man that thou art mindful
of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him?

<span id="xxxv.i.viii-p8"></span>**5** For thou hast made him lower a
little than God, And with glory and honor thou hast crowned him.

<span id="xxxv.i.viii-p9"></span>**6** Thou hast set him over the works
of thy hands: All things thou hast put under his feet.

<span id="xxxv.i.viii-p10"></span>**7** Sheep and oxen, all of them, And
also the beasts of the fields;

<span id="xxxv.i.viii-p11"></span>**8** The fowl of the heavens, and the
fish of the sea, And whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.

<span id="xxxv.i.viii-p12"></span>**9** O Jehovah, our Lord! How
wonderful is thy name in all the earth!

<span id="xxxv.i.ix"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p2"></span>PSALM 9

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p3"></span>To the chief Musician upon Hagittith.
Almuth Laben. A Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p4"></span>**1** I will praise Jehovah with my whole
heart; will recount all thy marvelous works.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p5"></span>**2** I will rejoice and exult in thee; I
will celebrate in Psalms thy name, O thou Most high!

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p6"></span>**3** When turned are my enemies
backward, They fall and are put to flight at thy presence.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p7"></span>**4** For thou hast maintained my
judgment and my cause; Thou hast sat upon the throne a righteous judge.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p8"></span>**5** Thou hast rebuked the heathen; Thou
hast destroyed the ungodly; Their name thou hast blotted out for ever
and ever.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p9"></span>**6** O thou enemy! come to an end are
desolations for ever; And cities thou hast destroyed; Perished has their
memory with them.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p10"></span>**7** And Jehovah for ever sitteth: His
throne for judgment lie hath prepared.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p11"></span>**8** And he shall judge the world in
righteousness; He shall judge the peoples in rectitude.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p12"></span>**9** And Jehovah will be a place of
defense to the poor, And a protection in seasonable times in trouble.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p13"></span>**10** And trust in thee shall those who
know thy name: For thou forsakest not those who seek thee, O Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p14"></span>**11** Sing psalms to Jehovah, who
dwelleth in Zion, Proclaim among the peoples his doings;

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p15"></span>**12** For in requiring blood, it lie
hath remembered: He hath not forgotten the cry of the poor.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p16"></span>**13** Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah!
See my affliction from those who persecute me, O thou that liftest me up
from the gates of death;

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p17"></span>**14** That I may recount all thy
praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion; That I may exult in thy
salvation.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p18"></span>**15** Sunk are the heathen into the pit
which they have made; In the net which they have hid taken are their own
feet.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p19"></span>**16** Known is Jehovah by executing
judgment: In the work of his own hands the wicked is snared. Higgaion
Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p20"></span>**17** Turned shall be the wicked into
hell: All the nations that forget God.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p21"></span>**18** For not for ever shall be
forgotten the poor; The hope of the humble shall not perish for ever.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p22"></span>**19** Arise, O Jehovah! let not man
prevail: Let the heathen be judged in thy sight.

<span id="xxxv.i.ix-p23"></span>**20** Put, O Jehovah! fear in them,
That the heathen may know that mortal men they are. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.x"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p2"></span>PSALM 10

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p3"></span>**1** Why, O Jehovah! standest thou afar
off? And winkest at seasonable times in trouble?

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p4"></span>**2** In his pride the ungodly doth
persecute the poor; Let them be caught in the devices which they
imagine.

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p5"></span>**3** For praise himself doth the ungodly
on account of the desire of his own soul; And the violent man blesseth
himself: He despiseth Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p6"></span>**4** The ungodly, in the pride of his
countenance doth not inquire; All his devices say, “There is not a God.”

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p7"></span>**5** Prosperous are his ways at all
times; High are thy judgments before him; At all his enemies he puffeth.

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p8"></span>**6** He saith in his heart, “I shall not
be moved from generation to generation,” Because he is not in adversity,

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p9"></span>**7** Of cursing his mouth is full, and of
deceit, and of malice: Under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p10"></span>**8** He will sit in the ensnaring places
of the villages; In his lurking places will he murder the innocent: His
eyes against the poor will take their aim.

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p11"></span>**9** He will lie in wait in secret, as a
lion in his den; He will lie in wait to catch the poor; He will catch
the poor by drawing him into his net.

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p12"></span>**10** He will crouch low, he will cast
himself down; Then shall fall by his strengths an army of the afflicted.

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p13"></span>**11** He hath said in his heart,
“Forgotten it hath God; “He hideth his face, that he may not see it for
ever.”

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p14"></span>**12** Arise, O Jehovah, God! lift up thy
hand: Do not forget the poor.

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p15"></span>**13** Why do the wicked despise God? He
saith in his heart, “Thou wilt not require it.”

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p16"></span>**14** Thou hast seen *it*; For mischief
and oppression thou considerest, That thou mayest take them into thy own
hand: Upon thee shall the poor leave; To the orphan thou wilt be an
helper.

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p17"></span>**15** Break thou the arm of the wicked
and the evil man; Thou shalt seek his wickedness, and shalt not find it.

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p18"></span>**16** Jehovah is King for ever and ever;
Perished are the heathen out of his land.

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p19"></span>**17** The desire of the needy thou hast
heard, O Jehovah! Thou wilt direct their heart; Hear shall thine car:

<span id="xxxv.i.x-p20"></span>**18** That thou mayest judge the
fatherless and the poor, That the man *who* is of earth may terrify no
more.

<span id="xxxv.i.xi"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xi-p2"></span>PSALM 11

<span id="xxxv.i.xi-p3"></span>To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xi-p4"></span>**1** In Jehovah do I put my trust: How
then say ye to my soul, “Flee ye into your mountain as a bird?”

<span id="xxxv.i.xi-p5"></span>**2** Surely behold! the ungodly shall
bend the bow, They have made ready their arrows upon the string, shoot
in secret at the upright in heart.

<span id="xxxv.i.xi-p6"></span>**3** Truly, the foundations are
destroyed: The righteous, what hath he done?

<span id="xxxv.i.xi-p7"></span>**4** Jehovah is in the palace of his
holiness; Jehovah in heaven *hath* his throne; His eyes behold, his
eyelids consider the children of men.

<span id="xxxv.i.xi-p8"></span>**5** Jehovah will approve the righteous
man; But the ungodly and him who loveth iniquity, hate doth his soul.

<span id="xxxv.i.xi-p9"></span>**6** He will rain upon the ungodly
snares, Fire and brimstone, and a storm of whirlwinds: This is the
portion of their cup.

<span id="xxxv.i.xi-p10"></span>**7** For the righteous Jehovah loveth
righteousness; His countenance approveth the upright.

<span id="xxxv.i.xii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xii-p2"></span>PSALM 12

<span id="xxxv.i.xii-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician upon the Eighth. A
Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xii-p4"></span>**1** Save me, O Jehovah! for failed
hath the merciful man, For wasted away are the faithful from among the
children of men.

<span id="xxxv.i.xii-p5"></span>**2** Deceit doth every one speak with
his neighbor; With lips of flatteries, with a double heart do they
speak.

<span id="xxxv.i.xii-p6"></span>**3** Let Jehovah cut off all lips of
flatteries, The tongue that great things doth speak:

<span id="xxxv.i.xii-p7"></span>**4** Those who have said, “By our
tongues we will be strengthened; “Our lips are our own; who is lord over
us?”

<span id="xxxv.i.xii-p8"></span>**5** “Because of the spoiling of the
needy, “Because of the groaning of the poor, “Now will I arise,” say
will Jehovah, “I will set in safety him for whom *the wicked man* layeth
snares.”

<span id="xxxv.i.xii-p9"></span>**6** The words of Jehovah are pure
words; Silver melted in an excellent crucible of earth, purified seven
times.

<span id="xxxv.i.xii-p10"></span>**7** Thou, O Jehovah! wilt keep them;
Thou wilt preserve him from this generation for ever.

<span id="xxxv.i.xii-p11"></span>**8** On every side the ungodly walk;
When they are exalted, reproach is to the children of men.

<span id="xxxv.i.xiii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xiii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xiii-p2"></span>PSALM 13

<span id="xxxv.i.xiii-p3"></span>To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xiii-p4"></span>**1** How long, O Jehovah! wilt thou
forget me for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?

<span id="xxxv.i.xiii-p5"></span>**2** How long shall I take counsel in
my soul? And have sorrow in my heart daily? How long exalted shall be my
enemy over me?

<span id="xxxv.i.xiii-p6"></span>**3** Look upon me, answer me, O
Jehovah, my God! Enlighten my eyes, lest I sleep in death;

<span id="xxxv.i.xiii-p7"></span>**4** Lest my enemy say, “I have
prevailed against him;” And those who afflict me rejoice if I should
fall.

<span id="xxxv.i.xiii-p8"></span>**5** But as for me, in thy goodness I
trust; Exult shall my heart in thy salvation. I will sing to the Lord
because he hath dealt bountifully with me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xiv"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xiv-p2"></span>PSALM 14

<span id="xxxv.i.xiv-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. A Psalm Of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xiv-p4"></span>**1** The fool hath said in his heart,
“There is no God;” They have corrupted \[*all good order*,\] they have
done abominable work. There is none that doeth good.

<span id="xxxv.i.xiv-p5"></span>**2** Jehovah from heaven looked down
Upon the children of men, To see whether there were any that did
understand, And seek after God.

<span id="xxxv.i.xiv-p6"></span>**3** Every one of them hath gone aside,
Together putrid have they become: There is none that doeth good, not
even one.

<span id="xxxv.i.xiv-p7"></span>**4** Have they no knowledge all these
workers of iniquity? Who eat up my people as they eat bread. Upon the
Lord they do not call.

<span id="xxxv.i.xiv-p8"></span>**5** There did they tremble with fear,
For God is in the generation of the righteous.

<span id="xxxv.i.xiv-p9"></span>**6** The counsel of the poor ye deride,
Because Jehovah is his hope.

<span id="xxxv.i.xiv-p10"></span>**7** Who shall give from Zion
salvation to Israel? When turn back shall Jehovah the captivity of his
people, Rejoice shall Jacob, and exult shall Israel.

<span id="xxxv.i.xv"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xv-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xv-p2"></span>PSALM 15

<span id="xxxv.i.xv-p3"></span>A Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xv-p4"></span>**1** O Jehovah! who shall dwell in thy
tabernacle? Who shall rest in the mountain of thy holiness?

<span id="xxxv.i.xv-p5"></span>**2** He who walketh in integrity and
doeth righteousness, And who speaketh truth in his heart,

<span id="xxxv.i.xv-p6"></span>**3** He who detracteth not with his
tongue, Who doeth not to his companion evil, And a calumnious report
doth not raise up against his neighbor.

<span id="xxxv.i.xv-p7"></span>**4** Despised in his eyes is the off
cast; But those who fear the Lord he honoreth; When he hath sworn to his
own hurt he doth not change.

<span id="xxxv.i.xv-p8"></span>**5** His money he doth not put out to
usury; And a present upon the innocent he doth not accept: He who doeth
these things shall not be moved for ever.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p2"></span>PSALM 16

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p3"></span>Michtam. A Psalm Of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p4"></span>**1** Keep me, O God! *For* in thee do I
trust.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p5"></span>**2** Thou shalt say to Jehovah, “My
Lord thou art; “My well doing *extendeth* not to thee.”

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p6"></span>**3** To the saints who are on the
earth, And to the excellent; all my delight is in them.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p7"></span>**4** Multiplied shall be their sorrows
who offer to a stranger; I will not taste their libations of blood, Nor
will I take their names in my lips.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p8"></span>**5** Jehovah is the portion of my
inheritance, and of my cup; Thou maintainest my lot.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p9"></span>**6** The lines have fallen to me in
pleasant *places*; Yea, an inheritance that is goodly hath fallen to me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p10"></span>**7** I will magnify Jehovah, who
giveth me counsel; Even in the nights instruct me do my reins.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p11"></span>**8** I have set Jehovah before me
continually; Since he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p12"></span>**9** Therefore glad is my heart,
rejoice doth my tongue; Also my flesh dwelleth in confidence.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p13"></span>**10** For thou wilt not leave my soul
in the grave; Nor wilt thou make thy Holy One to see the pit.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvi-p14"></span>**11** Thou wilt make known to me the
way of life; Fullness of joy *is* in thy countenance; Pleasures *are* at
thy right hand for evermore.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p2"></span>PSALM 17

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p3"></span>A Prayer of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p4"></span>**1** Hear, O Jehovah! my
righteousness; Attend to my cry; Hearken to my prayer, which is not in
lips of deceit.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p5"></span>**2** From the presence of thy
countenance let my judgment go forth Let thine eyes behold uprightness.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p6"></span>**3** Thou hast proved my heart; Thou
hast visited *it* by night; Thou hast examined *it*, thou shalt not find
*any thing in it*; My thought shall not pass beyond my mouth.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p7"></span>**4** As for the works of men, by the
word of thy lips I have taken heed of the ways of the destroyer.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p8"></span>**5** Uphold my steps in thy paths,
That my footsteps may not slide.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p9"></span>**6** I have called upon thee, surely
thou wilt hear me, O God! Incline thy ear to me, and hear my speech.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p10"></span>**7** Make marvelous thy mercies, O
thou Preserver of those who trust \[*in thee*,\] From those that exalt
themselves against thy right hand.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p11"></span>**8** Keep me as the apple, the
daughter of the eye; In the shadow of thy wings hide me,

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p12"></span>**9** From the face of the ungodly who
endeavor to destroy me — Of my enemies who in my soul besiege me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p13"></span>**10** In their own fat they have
enclosed themselves; With their mouth they have spoken haughtily.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p14"></span>**11** In our steps they have now
encompassed me; eyes they have set to east down to the ground.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p15"></span>**12** He is like a lion, he desireth
to seize his prey, And like a lion’s whelp which lurketh in secret
places.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p16"></span>**13** Arise, O Jehovah! confront him,
lay him prostrate; Deliver my soul from the ungodly man by thy sword

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p17"></span>**14** From men by thy hand, O
Jehovah! — From men who are of long duration, Whose portion is in life,
Whose belly thou fillets with thy secret, goods: Filled to the full are
their children with them, And their residue they leave to their babes.

<span id="xxxv.i.xvii-p18"></span>**15** As for me in righteousness I
shall behold thy face; I shall be satisfied when I shall awake with thy
likeness.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p2"></span>PSALM 18

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. Of the servant
of Jehovah, David, who spake to Jehovah the words of this song, in the
day that Jehovah delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and
from the hand of Saul. And he said,

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p4"></span>**1** I will love thee, O Jehovah! my
strength;

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p5"></span>**2** Jehovah my rock, my fortress,
and my deliverer; My God, my rock, I will hope in him: My shield and the
horn of my salvation, my refuge.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p6"></span>**3** Upon the praised Jehovah will I
call; And from my enemies I shall be saved.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p7"></span>**4** Encompassed me had the cords of
death. The torrents of ungodliness had affrighted me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p8"></span>**5** The cords of the grave had
encompassed me; Prevented me had the snares of death.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p9"></span>**6** In my distress I called upon
Jehovah, And to my God I cried: And he heard from his temple my voice,
And my cry before him came, \[*even*\] into his ears.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p10"></span>**7** Then shake and tremble did the
earth; And the foundations of the mountains were troubled and shaken,
Because he was wroth.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p11"></span>**8** There ascended smoke out of his
nostrils, And fire *proceeding* from his mouth consumed; Coals were
kindled by it.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p12"></span>**9** And he bowed the heavens and
descended; And thick darkness *was* under his feet.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p13"></span>**10** And he rode upon a cherub and
flew; And was carried upon the wings of the wind.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p14"></span>**11** He made darkness his hiding
place; Round about him his pavilion was dark waters, And the clouds of
the skies.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p15"></span>**12** At the brightness *which was*
before him his clouds passed away, \[*There were*\] hail-storm, and
coals of fire.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p16"></span>**13** And thunder in the heavens did
Jehovah, And the Most High sent forth his voice; \[*There were*\]
hailstorm and coals of fire.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p17"></span>**14** And he sent out his army and
scattered them; And lightnings he multiplied, and put them into
confusion.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p18"></span>**15** And seen were the abysses of
the waters, And disclosed were the foundations of the world, At thy
rebuke, O Jehovah! At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p19"></span>**16** He sent from on high, he took
me; He drew me from waters great.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p20"></span>**17** He delivered me from my enemy
\[*that was*\] strong, And from my adversary; Because they were stronger
than I.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p21"></span>**18** They had prevented me in the
day of my calamity; And Jehovah was a support for me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p22"></span>**19** And he brought me forth into a
wide place; He rescued me because he wished well to me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p23"></span>**20** Rewarded me hath Jehovah
according to my righteousness; According to the purity of my hands he
hath repaid me;

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p24"></span>**21** Because I have kept the ways
of Jehovah, And have not impiously departed from my God;

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p25"></span>**22** Because all his judgments *I
have had* before me, And his statutes I have not removed from me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p26"></span>**23** And I have been upright with
him, And have kept me from my iniquity.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p27"></span>**24** And repaid me hath Jehovah
according to my righteousness According to the purity of my hands before
his eyes.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p28"></span>**25** With the merciful thou wilt
deal mercifully, With a man of uprightness thou wilt show thyself
upright.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p29"></span>**26** With the pure thou wilt be
pure, And with the perverse thou wilt deal perversely.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p30"></span>**27** For thou the afflicted people
wilt save, And the haughty eyes thou wilt east down.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p31"></span>**28** For thou shalt light my lamp,
O Jehovah! My God shall enlighten my darkness.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p32"></span>**29** For by thee I shall break
through the wedge of a troop, And by my God I shall leap over a wall.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p33"></span>**30** As for God perfect is his way;
The word of Jehovah \[*is*\] refined; A shield is He to all who confide
in him.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p34"></span>**31** For who is God besides
Jehovah? And who is strong except our God?

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p35"></span>**32** It is God who hath girded me
with strength, And hath made perfect my way.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p36"></span>**33** He maketh my feet like *those*
of hinds, And upon my high places he hath set me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p37"></span>**34** He traineth my hands to the
battle, And broken will be a bow of steel by my arms.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p38"></span>**35** And thou hast given me the
shield of thy salvation, And thy right hand hath sustained me, And thy
clemency hath increased me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p39"></span>**36** Thou hast enlarged my steps
under me, And my ankles shall not totter.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p40"></span>**37** I will pursue my enemies and
will seize them; Nor will I return until I have consumed them.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p41"></span>**38** I have afflicted them, and
they were not able to rise; They have fallen under my feet.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p42"></span>**39** Thou hast girded me with might
for the battle; Thou hast bowed down my enemies under me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p43"></span>**40** And of my enemies thou hast
given me the neck, And \[*as for*\] my haters I will destroy them.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p44"></span>**41** They shall cry aloud, and
*there shall* *be* no Savior *for them*; To Jehovah, but he shall not
answer them.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p45"></span>**42** And I will bruise them to
powder as dust before the wind; As the mire of the streets I will tread
upon them.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p46"></span>**43** Thou shalt deliver me from the
contentions of the people; Thou shalt make me head of the nations; A
people whom I have not known shall serve me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p47"></span>**44** At the hearing of the ear they
shall obey me; The children of strangers shall lie to me;

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p48"></span>**45** The children of strangers
shall lose courage, And tremble from within their places of concealment.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p49"></span>**46** Let Jehovah live and blessed
*be* my strength, And let the God of my salvation be exalted:

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p50"></span>**47** The God who giveth vengeance
for me, And subdueth peoples under me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p51"></span>**48** My deliverer from my enemies:
Yea, from those who had risen up against me thou hast lifted me up: From
the man of violence thou hast rescued me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p52"></span>**49** Therefore will I praise thee,
O Jehovah! among the Gentiles, And to thy name will I sing.

<span id="xxxv.i.xviii-p53"></span>**50** Who worketh great deliverances
for his king, And showeth mercy to his anointed, \[even to\] David, And
to his seed for ever.

<span id="xxxv.i.xix"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p2"></span>PSALM 19

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p4"></span>**1** The heavens recount the glory of
God; And the works of his hands proclaim doth the expanse.

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p5"></span>**2** Day unto day poureth forth speech;
And night unto night publisheth knowledge.

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p6"></span>**3** There is no speech and no
language, Where is not heard their voice.

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p7"></span>**4** Through all the earth hath gone
forth their writing, And to the extremity of the world their words: For
the sun he hath set a tabernacle in them,

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p8"></span>**5** And he as a bridegroom goeth forth
from his chamber; He exulteth as a strong man to run *his* course.

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p9"></span>**6** From *one* extremity of the
heavens *is* his going forth, And his circuit to the utmost limits
thereof, And no *person* is hidden from his heat.

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p10"></span>**7** The law of the Lord is perfect,
restoring the soul; The testimony of Jehovah is faithful, instructing in
wisdom the babes;

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p11"></span>**8** The statutes of Jehovah *are*
right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the Lord *is* pure,
enlightening the eyes;

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p12"></span>**9** The fear of Jehovah is clean,
enduring for ever; The judgments of Jehovah are truth, they are
justified together.

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p13"></span>**10** More desirable \[*are they*\]
than gold, and much fine gold; And sweeter than honey, and the dropping
of honeycombs.

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p14"></span>**11** Moreover, thy servant is made
circumspect by them; And in their observance the reward *is* great.

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p15"></span>**12** His errors who can understand?
From my hidden *sins* cleanse thou me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p16"></span>**13** Likewise from presumptuous sins
restrain thou thy servant, That they may not have dominion over me; Then
upright shall I be and clean from much wickedness.

<span id="xxxv.i.xix-p17"></span>**14** Let the words of my mouth, and
the meditation of my heart be acceptable Before thee, O Jehovah! my
strength and my Redeemer.

<span id="xxxv.i.xx-p2"></span>PSALM 20

<span id="xxxv.i.xx-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. A Psalm Of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xx-p4"></span>**1** May Jehovah hear thee in the day of
trouble!

<span id="xxxv.i.xx-p5"></span>**2** May he send help to thee from the
sanctuary! And out of Zion sustain thee!

<span id="xxxv.i.xx-p6"></span>**3** May he be mindful of all thy
offerings! And thy holocaust may he make flit! Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.xx-p7"></span>**4** May he give to thee according to
thy heart! And all thy counsel may he fulfill!

<span id="xxxv.i.xx-p8"></span>**5** That we may exult in thy salvation,
And in the name of our God erect a banner, When Jehovah shall fulfill
all thy petitions.

<span id="xxxv.i.xx-p9"></span>**6** Now I have known that Jehovah hath
saved his anointed; He will hear him from the heavens of his sanctuary,
In the mightiness of the salvation of his right hand.

<span id="xxxv.i.xx-p10"></span>**7** Some *trust* in chariots, and some
in horses; But the name of Jehovah our God we will remember.

<span id="xxxv.i.xx-p11"></span>**8** They are bowed down and fallen;
But we are risen up and stand erect.

<span id="xxxv.i.xx-p12"></span>**9** O Jehovah! do thou save; Let the
King hear us in the day that we call upon him.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p2"></span>PSALM 21

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. A Psalm Of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p4"></span>**1** O Jehovah! in thy strength rejoice
shall the king, And in thy salvation how greatly shall he exult!

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p5"></span>**2** The desire of his heart thou hast
given him, And what he uttered with his lips, thou hast not denied
*him*. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p6"></span>**3** For thou shalt prevent him with
blessings of good; Thou shalt place upon his head a crown of gold.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p7"></span>**4** Life he asked from thee; Thou hast
given him length of days for ever and ever.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p8"></span>**5** Great *is* his glory in thy
salvation: Splendor and beauty thou hast put upon him.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p9"></span>**6** For thou hast set him \[*to be*\]
blessings for ever: Thou hast gladdened him with joy before thy
countenance.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p10"></span>**7** For the king trusteth in Jehovah;
And through the goodness of the Most High, he shall not be moved

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p11"></span>**8** Find out shall thy hand all thy
enemies; Thy right hand shall find out thy haters.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p12"></span>**9** Thou shalt put them as in a
furnace of fire in the time of thy wrath, O Jehova! In his wrath he
shall overwhelm them, And consume them shall the fire.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p13"></span>**10** Their fruit from the earth thou
wilt destroy, And their seed from among the sons of men.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p14"></span>**11** For they have spread out against
thee evil; They have devised against thee a stratagem which they could
not accomplish.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p15"></span>**12** For thou wilt set them as a
butt; On thy strings thou shalt make ready *thy arrows* against their
faces.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxi-p16"></span>**13** Be thou exalted, O Jehovah! in
thy strength, *Then* we will sing and celebrate in psalms thy power.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p2"></span>PSALM 22

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. Upon the hind of
the morning. A Psalm Of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p4"></span>**1** My God! my God! why hast thou
forsaken me? \[*Why art thou*\] far from my help, from the words of my
roaring?

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p5"></span>**2** O my God! I cry by day, and thou
dost not hear: And in the night, and am not silent.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p6"></span>**3** Yet thou art holy, Inhabiting the
praises of Israel.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p7"></span>**4** In thee trust did our fathers:
They trusted, and thou didst deliver them.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p8"></span>**5** To thee they cried, and were
saved: In thee they trusted, and were not put to shame.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p9"></span>**6** But I *am* a worm, and not a man;
The reproach of men, and despised of the people.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p10"></span>**7** All who see me scoff at me: They
thrust out the lip, they shake the head.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p11"></span>**8** “He hath devolved,” *say they*,
“upon Jehovah, *his* cause, let him rescue him, “Let him deliver him,
since he hath a favor for him.”

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p12"></span>**9** Surely it is thou who didst take
me out of the womb, Causing me to confide upon the breasts of my mother.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p13"></span>**10** Upon thee I was cast from the
womb: From the belly of my mother my God art thou.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p14"></span>**11** Depart not far from me, for
trouble is near, For there is no helper.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p15"></span>**12** Encompassed me have bulls
\[*that are*\] strong, The bulls of Bashan have beset me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p16"></span>**13** They have opened upon me their
mouth, As a lion ravening and roaring.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p17"></span>**14** Like water I have flowed,
 <span id="fr_313"></span>[314](#fn_313) And disjointed have been  <span
id="fr_314"></span>[315](#fn_314) all my bones: My heart hath been
 <span id="fr_315"></span>[316](#fn_315) like wax, It hath been  <span
id="fr_316"></span>[317](#fn_316) melted in the midst of my bowels.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p22"></span>**15** Dried up as a potsherd hath
been  <span id="fr_317"></span>[318](#fn_317) my strength, And my tongue
cleaveth to my jaws; And to the dust of death thou hast brought me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p24"></span>**16** For encompassed me have dogs;
The assembly of the wicked have surrounded me: They have pierced my
hands and my feet.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p25"></span>**17** I will count all my bones; As
for them they look and gaze upon me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p26"></span>**18** They divide my garments among
them; Upon my vesture they cast the lot.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p27"></span>**19** And thou, O Jehovah! be not far
from me; *Thou who art* my strength, to my aid hasten.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p28"></span>**20** Rescue from the sword my soul;
From the hand of the dog my only one.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p29"></span>**21** Save me from the mouth of the
lion, And from the horns of unicorns do thou hear me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p30"></span>**22** I will declare thy name to my
brethren; In the midst of the assembly will I praise thee.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p31"></span>**23** *Saying*, “Ye who fear Jehovah
praise him: “All ye the seed of Jacob glorify him: “And stand in awe of
him, all ye the seed of Israel.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p32"></span>**24** “For he hath not despised nor
disdained the poor; “Nor hath he hidden his face from him; “And when he
cried to him, he heard him.”

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p33"></span>**25** From thee shall proceed my
praise in the congregation great; My vows will I pay before them that
fear him.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p34"></span>**26** Eat shall the poor, and be
satisfied; They shall praise Jehovah who seek him; Your heart shall live
for ever.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p35"></span>**27** Remember and turn to Jehovah
shall all the ends of the earth; And prostrate themselves before his
face shall all the tribes of the Gentiles.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p36"></span>**28** For Jehovah’s is the kingdom,
That he may have dominion among the Gentiles.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p37"></span>**29** Eat and worship shall all the
fat ones of the earth: Before his face shall bow all who are going down
to the dust; And he who his own soul doth not quicken.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p38"></span>**30** *Their* seed shall serve him,
It shall be registered to the Lord for a generation.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxii-p39"></span>**31** They shall come and shall
declare his righteousness, To a people that shall be born, because he
hath done \[*this*.\],

therefore I shall not want any thing.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxiii-p5"></span>**2** In pastures of grass he maketh
me to lie down; To waters gently flowing he leadeth me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxiii-p6"></span>**3** My soul he restoreth: He leadeth
me by the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxiii-p7"></span>**4** Though I should walk in the
valley of the shadow of death, I will not fear evil, because thou art
with me; Thy staff and thy crook they comfort me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxiii-p8"></span>**5** Thou wilt prepare before me a
table in the presence of my persecutors; Thou wilt anoint with oil my
head; My cup overfloweth.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxiii-p9"></span>**6** Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life, And I shall dwell in the house of
Jehovah for a length of days.

it, And upon the floods he hath arranged it.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxiv-p6"></span>**3** Who shall ascend into the
mountain of Jehovah? Who shall stand in the place of his holiness?

<span id="xxxv.i.xxiv-p7"></span>**4** He who is clean in hands and pure
in heart, Who hath not lifted up to vanity his soul, And hath not sworn
deceitfully.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxiv-p8"></span>**5** He shall receive blessing from
Jehovah, And righteousness from the God of his salvation.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxiv-p9"></span>**6** This is the generation of those
who seek him, Of those who seek thy face, O Jacob! Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p4"></span>**1** To thee, O Jehovah! my soul have I
lifted up.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p5"></span>**2** O my God! in thee have I hoped:
Let me not be put to shame, Let not my enemies rejoice over me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p6"></span>**3** Yea none who wait on thee shall be
put to shame: They shall be ashamed who deal perfidiously without cause.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p7"></span>**4** Thy ways, O Jehovah! make me to
know, Thy paths teach thou me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p8"></span>**5** Direct me in thy truth, and teach
me; For thou art the God of my salvation; For thee I have waited all the
day.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p9"></span>**6** Remember thy compassions, O
Jehovah! And thy loving-kindnesses; for they have been from everlasting.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p10"></span>**7** The transgressions of my youth,
and my iniquities do not thou remember According to thy clemency
remember thou me, For the sake of thy goodness, O Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p11"></span>**8** Good and upright *is* Jehovah,
Therefore he will teach sinners in the way.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p12"></span>**9** He will guide the poor in
judgment, And will teach the poor his way.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p13"></span>**10** All the ways of Jehovah are
mercy and truth, To those who keep his covenant and his testimony.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p14"></span>**11** For the sake of thy name, O
Jehovah! Be merciful to my iniquity, for great is it.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p15"></span>**12** Who is the man that feareth
Jehovah? He will teach him in the way which he should choose.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p16"></span>**13** His soul in good shall dwell,
And his seed shall inherit the land.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p17"></span>**14** The counsel of Jehovah is to
those who fear him, That he may make known to them his covenant.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p18"></span>**15** My eyes are continually towards
Jehovah, For he will bring out of the net my feet.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p19"></span>**16** Have respect to me, take pity
upon me, For solitary and poor am I.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p20"></span>**17** The afflictions of my heart are
enlarged; Out of my distresses do thou bring me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p21"></span>**18** Behold my affliction and my
travail, And take away all my sins.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p22"></span>**19** Behold my enemies, for they are
multiplied; And with a violent hatred they hate me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p23"></span>**20** Guard my soul, and rescue me,
That I may not be ashamed; For I have trusted in thee.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p24"></span>**21** Let integrity and rectitude
preserve me; Because I have waited for thee.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxv-p25"></span>**22** Redeem O God! Israel from all
his troubles.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvi-p4"></span>**1** Judge me, O Jehovah: Because in
my integrity I have walked, And in Jehovah have trusted, I shall not
stumble.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvi-p5"></span>**2** Prove me, O Jehovah! and try me,
Examine my reins and my heart.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvi-p6"></span>**3** For thy goodness *is* before my
eyes; Therefore I have walked in thy truth.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvi-p7"></span>**4** I have not sat with men of
vanity, And with crafty men I will not go in.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvi-p8"></span>**5** I hate the assembly of
transgressors, And with the wicked I will not sit.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvi-p9"></span>**6** I will wash in purity my hands,
And will encompass thy altar, O Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvi-p10"></span>**7** To cause to be heard the voice
of praise, And to tell of all thy marvelous deeds.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvi-p11"></span>**8** O Jehovah! I have loved the
habitation of thy house, And the place of the dwelling of thy glory.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvi-p12"></span>**9** Gather not with ungodly men, my
soul, Nor with men of bloods my life.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvi-p13"></span>**10** For in their hands *is*
maliciousness, And their right hand is full of bribes.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvi-p14"></span>**11** But as for me in my integrity I
will walk: Redeem me, and have mercy upon me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvi-p15"></span>**12** My foot hath stood in
uprightness: In the congregations will I bless thee, O Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p3"></span>Of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p4"></span>**1** Jehovah is my light and my
salvation, Whom shall I fear? Jehovah *is* the strength of my life, Of
whom shall I be afraid?

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p5"></span>**2** When approach against me did the
wicked, To devour my flesh — My oppressors and my enemies against me —
They stumbled and fell.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p6"></span>**3** If there should encamp against
me a camp, My heart shall not fear: If there should rise against me war,
In this shall I have confidence.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p7"></span>**4** One thing have I requested from
Jehovah — This will I follow after — That I may dwell in the house of
Jehovah all the days of my life, To behold the beauty of Jehovah, To
survey his temple.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p8"></span>**5** For he shall hide me in his
pavilion in the day of evil; He shall conceal me in the secret
\[*recess*\] of his tent, Upon a rock he will set me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p9"></span>**6** And now he shall exalt my head
Above my enemies who surround me: And I will sacrifice in his tabernacle
sacrifices of triumph; I will sing and will celebrate in psalms Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p10"></span>**7** Hear, O Jehovah! my voice with
which I cry; Have mercy upon me and answer me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p11"></span>**8** To thee my heart hath said,
“Seek ye my face;” Therefore thy face, O Jehovah! will I seek.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p12"></span>**9** Hide not thy face from me; Cast
not away in wrath thy servant: My strength thou hast been, do not desert
me, And do not forsake me, O God of my salvation!

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p13"></span>**10** When my father and my mother
shall forsake me, Jehovah shall receive me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p14"></span>**11** Teach me, O Jehovah! thy way,
And lead me in the path of rectitude because of my enemies.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p15"></span>**12** Do not deliver me to the
desire of my oppressors, For risen up against me have false witnesses,
And he who uttereth violence.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p16"></span>**13** Unless I had believed to see
the goodness of Jehovah, in the land of the living —.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxvii-p17"></span>**14** Wait thou on Jehovah; Be
strong, and he will comfort thy heart, And wait thou on Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxviii-p3"></span>Of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xxviii-p4"></span>**1** Unto thee, O Jehovah! will I
cry; O my strength! hold not thy peace from me Lest if thou shouldst be
silent to me, I then become like those who descend into the grave.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxviii-p5"></span>**2** Hear the voice of my prayers
when I cry to thee, When I lift up my hands to the sanctuary of thy
holiness.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxviii-p6"></span>**3** Draw me not away with ungodly
men, And with the workers of iniquity, Who speak peace  <span
id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319) with their neighbors, When in their
hearts is malice.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxviii-p8"></span>**4** Give them according to their
works, And according to the wickedness of their doings: According to the
work of their hands give them, Render their reward to them.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxviii-p9"></span>**5** Because they do not consider
the doing of Jehovah, Nor the work of his hands, Let him destroy them
and not build them up.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxviii-p10"></span>**6** Blessed *be* Jehovah! For he
hath heard the voice of my supplications.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxviii-p11"></span>**7** Jehovah *is* my strength and
my shield; In him trusted hath my heart, and I have been helped:
Therefore exult shall my heart, And with my song will I celebrate him.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxviii-p12"></span>**8** Jehovah *is* strength to them,
And the strength of the salvations of his Anointed *is* He.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxviii-p13"></span>**9** Save thy people, and bless thy
inheritance; Feed them and exalt them for ever.

the mighty — Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxix-p5"></span>**2** Ascribe to Jehovah the glory of
his name; Worship before Jehovah in the brightness of his sanctuary.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxix-p6"></span>**3** The voice of Jehovah is upon the
waters; The God of glory thundereth; Jehovah is upon the waters great.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxix-p7"></span>**4** The voice of Jehovah is in
strength, The voice of Jehovah is in majesty.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxix-p8"></span>**5** The voice of Jehovah breaketh the
cedars; Break, I say, doth Jehovah the cedars of Lebanon.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxix-p9"></span>**6** And he maketh Lebanon to leap
like a calf, And Sirion like the son of the unicorns.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxix-p10"></span>**7** The voice of Jehovah striketh
out flames of fire.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxix-p11"></span>**8** The voice of Jehovah maketh the
desert to tremble. Jehovah maketh to tremble the desert of Kadesh.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxix-p12"></span>**9** The voice of Jehovah maketh the
hinds to bring forth, And discovereth the forests, And all *meanwhile*
in his temple speak his praise.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxix-p13"></span>**10** Jehovah over the flood
presideth, Preside, I say, doth Jehovah \[*as*\] King for ever.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxix-p14"></span>**11** Jehovah strength to his people
will give; Jehovah will bless his people with peace.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p3"></span>A Psalm of a Song at the dedication of
the house of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p4"></span>**1** I will exalt thee, O Jehovah! for
thou hast raised me up, And hast not made glad my enemies over me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p5"></span>**2** O Jehovah, my God! I have cried to
thee, And thou hast healed me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p6"></span>**3** O Jehovah! thou hast brought up
from the grove my soul; Thou hast quickened me from among those who
descend into the pit.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p7"></span>**4** Sing to Jehovah, O ye his meek
ones! And acknowledge the memorial of his holiness.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p8"></span>**5** For *there is only* a moment in
his anger, *But* life in his favor: In the evening will lodge weeping,
And in the morning shall come exultation.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p9"></span>**6** But as for me I had said in my
tranquillity, “I shall not be moved for ever.”

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p10"></span>**7** O Jehovah! in thy good pleasure
Thou hast established strength to my mountain; Thou didst hide thy face,
I was confounded.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p11"></span>**8** O Jehovah! to thee I cried, And
to my Lord I made supplication.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p12"></span>**9** What profit shall there be in my
blood, When I descend into the pit? Celebrate thee shall the dust? Shall
it proclaim thy truth?

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p13"></span>**10** Hear, O Jehovah! and have mercy
upon me; O Jehovah! be thou a helper to me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p14"></span>**11** Thou hast turned my mourning
into dancing for me; Thou hast loosed my sackcloth, And girded me with
gladness.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxx-p15"></span>**12** That celebrate thee in psalms
may my glory, and not be silent: O Jehovah, my God! for ever will I
celebrate thee.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician,. A Psalm of
David

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p4"></span>**1** In thee, O Jehovah! have I
trusted, Let me not be put to shame for ever: In thy righteousness
deliver me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p5"></span>**2** Incline to me thy ear, Speedily
do thou rescue me; Be to me for a rock of strength, For a house of
defense to save me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p6"></span>**3** For my rock, and my fortress
*art* thou: And for the sake of thy name thou wilt direct and guide me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p7"></span>**4** Extricate me from the net, which
they have hidden for me, For thou art my strength.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p8"></span>**5** Into thy hand I will commend my
spirit; For thou hast redeemed me, O Jehovah! God of truth.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p9"></span>**6** I hate all those who regard lying
vanities; But as for me in Jehovah I have trusted.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p10"></span>**7** I will exult and rejoice in thy
goodness; Because thou hast looked upon my affliction: Thou hast known
in distresses my soul:

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p11"></span>**8** And thou hast not shut me up in
the hand of the enemy: *But* thou hast set at large my feet.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p12"></span>**9** Have pity upon me, O Jehovah!
for trouble is to me: My eye hath consumed away for vexation; my soul
and my belly.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p13"></span>**10** My life hath riffled through
grid; And my years with groaning: My strength hath sunk through my
sorrow, And my bones have moldered away.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p14"></span>**11** On account of all my enemies I
was a reproach, Yea to my neighbors exceedingly, And a terror to my
acquaintances; And those who saw me abroad fled from me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p15"></span>**12** I was forgotten as a dead man
from the heart; I became like a vessel \[*that is*\] broken.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p16"></span>**13** For I have heard the slander of
many: Fear *hath seized* me on every side, While they consult together
against me, And to take away my life do devise.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p17"></span>**14** But as for me, in thee have I
trusted, O Jehovah! I have said, “My God art thou.”

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p18"></span>**15** In thy hand are my times;
Rescue me from the hand of my enemies, And from those who persecute me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p19"></span>**16** Cause to shine upon thy servant
thy face, Save me in thy goodness.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p20"></span>**17** O Jehovah! let me not be put to
shame, For I have called upon thee: Let the wicked be put to shame, Let
Gem be silent in the grave.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p21"></span>**18** Let the lips of lying be put to
shame, Which speak against the righteous a hard thing in pride and
scorn.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p22"></span>**19** How great is thy goodness,
Which thou hast hidden for those who fear thee! Which thou hast
performed for those who confide in thee, Before the sons of men!

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p23"></span>**20** Thou shalt hide them in the
hidden place of thy presence, From the prides of man; Thou shalt conceal
them *as* in a tent, From the strife of tongues.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p24"></span>**21** Blessed be Jehovah! For he hath
made wonderful his goodness towards me, As in a city fortified.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p25"></span>**22** But as for me, I had said in my
fear, “I am cast away from before thy eyes:” Yet truly thou hast heard
the voice of my supplications, When I cried unto thee.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p26"></span>**23** Love Jehovah, all ye meek ones
of his! The faithful preserve doth Jehovah, And he repayeth plentifully
him who behaveth proudly.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxi-p27"></span>**24** Be of good courage, and he
shall strengthen your heart, All ye who hope in Jehovah.

remitted iniquity, And whose transgression is covered.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxii-p5"></span>**2** Blessed is the man to whom
Jehovah doth not impute iniquity, And in whose spirit there is not
guile.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxii-p6"></span>**3** When I kept silence, waste away
did my bones, And when I wailed all the day.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxii-p7"></span>**4** For by day and night heavy upon
me was thy hand; Turned into the drought of summer was my greenness.
Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxii-p8"></span>**5** My sin I have acknowledged to
thee, And my iniquity I have not hid. I said, “I will confess against
myself my wickedness to Jehovah;” And thou didst remit the guilt of my
sin. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxii-p9"></span>**6** On this account, pray to thee
shall every *man*, that is meek, In the time of finding thee: So that in
a flood of many waters, To him they shall not come near.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxii-p10"></span>**7** Thou art a hiding-place to me;
From trouble thou shalt preserve me; With songs of deliverance thou
shalt encompass me. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxii-p11"></span>**8** I will instruct thee, And teach
thee the way wherein thou shouldest walk: I will counsel thee with mine
eye.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxii-p12"></span>**9** Be ye not like a horse, *or*
like a mule, Which have not understanding: With bit and bridle his jaws
thou shalt bind, Lest they kick against thee.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxii-p13"></span>**10** Many sorrows *shall* *be* to
the wicked: But the man who hopeth in Jehovah goodness shall encompass.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxii-p14"></span>**11** Rejoice in Jehovah, and exult,
ye righteous! Sing all ye *who are* upright in heart.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p10"></span>**7** He gathered together as an
heap the waters of the sea; He laid up as in treasure houses the deeps.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p11"></span>**8** Let all the earth fear
Jehovah; Of him let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p12"></span>**9** For he spake, and it was; He
commanded, and it stood.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p13"></span>**10** Jehovah scattereth the
counsel of the Gentiles, He rendereth fruitless the imaginations of the
peoples.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p14"></span>**11** The counsel of Jehovah for
ever shall stand, The thoughts of his heart from age to age.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p15"></span>**12** Blessed is the people to whom
Jehovah is their God, The people whom he hath chosen for: in inheritance
to himself.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p16"></span>**13** From heavens looked down hath
Jehovah, He hath beheld all the sons of Adam.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p17"></span>**14** From the dwelling place of
His throne, He hath looked on all the inhabitants of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p18"></span>**15** He who hath fashioned
together their hearts, Who understandeth all their works.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p19"></span>**16** There is not a king saved by
the multitude of an host, Nor a giant rescued by greatness of strength.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p20"></span>**17** Fallacious is a horse for
safety, And by the greatness of his strength he will not deliver.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p21"></span>**18** Behold! the eye of Jehovah is
upon those who fear him, \[*Upon those*\] who hope in his mercy;

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p22"></span>**19** To rescue from death their
souls, To keep them alive in famine.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p23"></span>**20** Our soul waiteth for Jehovah:
Our help and our shield is he.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p24"></span>**21** Surely in him rejoice shall
our heart, Because in his holy name we will trust.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiii-p25"></span>**22** Let thy mercy be upon us, O
Jehovah! According as we have trusted in thee.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p2"></span>PSALM 34

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p3"></span>Of David when he changed his
countenance before Abimelech, who expelled him, and he departed

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p4"></span>**1** I will bless Jehovah at all
times: Continually his praise *shall be* in my mouth.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p5"></span>**2** In Jehovah make her boast shall
my soul: Hear shall the humble and be glad.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p6"></span>**3** Magnify? Jehovah with me, And
let us exalt his name together.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p7"></span>**4** I sought. Jehovah, and he
answered me, And from all my fears he delivered me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p8"></span>**5** They shall look to him, and
shall flow to him, And their faces shall not he ashamed.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p9"></span>**6** This poor man cried,: and
Jehovah heard him, And from all his distresses saved him.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p10"></span>**7** Encamp doth the angel of
Jehovah about those who fear him, And will deliver them.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p11"></span>**8** Taste ye and see that good is
Jehovah: Blessed is the man who trusteth in him.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p12"></span>**9** Fear Jehovah, ye saints of his;
For nothing is lacking to those who fear him.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p13"></span>**10** The young lions suffer want
and are famished: But those who fear Jehovah shall not want any good
thing.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p14"></span>**11** Come ye children, hearken to
me, The fear of Jehovah I will teach you.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p15"></span>**12** Who is the man that desireth
life, Loving days in which he may see good?

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p16"></span>**13** Keep thy tongue from evil, And
thy lips from speaking deceit.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p17"></span>**14** Depart from evil, and do good;
Seek peace, and pursue it.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p18"></span>**15** The eyes of Jehovah *are* upon
the righteous, And his ears \[*are open*\] to their cry.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p19"></span>**16** The face of Jehovah is upon
those who do evil, To blot out from the earth their remembrance.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p20"></span>**17** They cried, and Jehovah heard
*them*, And from all their distresses he delivered them.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p21"></span>**18** Near is Jehovah to the broken
in heart; The contrite in spirit he will save.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p22"></span>**19** Many *are* the afflictions of
the righteous; But from them all deliver him will Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p23"></span>**20** He keepeth all his bones: One
of them is not broken.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p24"></span>**21** That malice shall slay the
wicked, And those who hate the righteous shall be destroyed.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxiv-p25"></span>**22** Redeem doth, Jehovah the soul
of his servants, And they shall not perish who confide in him.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p2"></span>PSALM 35

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p3"></span>Of David

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p4"></span>**1** Plead, O Jehovah! with those who
plead with me, Fight against those who fight against me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p5"></span>**2** Lay hold on shield and buckler,
And rise up to my aid.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p6"></span>**3** Draw out the spear, and stop my
ears against my persecutors: Say to my soul, “Thy salvation am I.”

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p7"></span>**4** Let those be confounded and put
to shame Who seek my soul, Let those be turned back and be abashed Who
devise my hurt.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p8"></span>**5** Let them be as chaff before the
wind? And let the angel of Jehovah drive them.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p9"></span>**6** Let their way be darkness and
slipperiness; And let the angel of Jehovah pursue them:

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p10"></span>**7** For without a cause they have
hid for me the pitfall of their net,  <span
id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321) Without a cause they have digged a pit
for my soul.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p12"></span>**8** Let there come upon him
confusion of which he is not aware; And let the net which he hath hidden
catch him; With confusion let him fall into it.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p13"></span>**9** And my soul hath exulted in
Jehovah, It shall rejoice in his salvation.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p14"></span>**10** All my bones shall say, “O
Jehovah! who is like to thee, “Rescuing the poor from him who is too
strong for him, “The poor and wretched from his spoiler?”

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p15"></span>**11** Rise up do witnesses \[*that
are*\] violent; Things which I have not known they ask me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p16"></span>**12** They repay me evil for good, To
the bereaving of my soul.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p17"></span>**13** But as for me, in their
sickness my clothing was sackcloth: I afflicted by fasting my soul; And
my prayer upon my own bosom was turned.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p18"></span>**14** As if he had been a friend, as
if a brother to me, I behaved myself *towards him*: As he who mourneth
heavily for his mother I humbled myself.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p19"></span>**15** But they at my halting
rejoiced, they were assembled together: Assembled together, I say,
against me, were the abjects whom I had not known: They have torn with
their lips and have not been silent.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p20"></span>**16** Among perfidious jesters at
feasts, They gnash upon me with their teeth.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p21"></span>**17** O Lord! how long wilt thou
behold it? Rescue my soul from their violence, From the lions my only
one.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p22"></span>**18** I will celebrate thee in the
congregation great: Among people many I will praise thee.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p23"></span>**19** Let not those rejoice over me,
who unjustly are my enemies; Nor let those who hate me without a cause
wink with the eye.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p24"></span>**20** For peace they speak not;

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p25"></span>**21** They have opened against me
their mouth; They have said, “Aha! aha! seen *it* hath our eye.”

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p26"></span>**22** Thou hast seen *it* *also*, O
Jehovah: Be not silent, O Lord! be not far from me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p27"></span>**23** Arouse thyself, and awake for
my judgment, My God! and my Lord! to my cause.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p28"></span>**24** Judge me according to thy
righteousness, O Jehovah, my God! And let them not rejoice over me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p29"></span>**25** Let them not say in their
heart, “Aha! our soul!” Let them not say “We have destroyed him.”

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p30"></span>**26** Let those be ashamed and
confounded together, Who rejoice at my calamity; Let those be clothed
with shame and ignominy, Who magnify themselves against me.

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p31"></span>**27** *But* let those shout and
rejoice, who favor my righteousness: And let them say continually,
“Magnified be Jehovah! “Who loveth the peace of his servant.”

<span id="xxxv.i.xxxv-p32"></span>**28** And my tongue shall speak of
thy righteousness; All the day of thy praise.

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p2"></span>PSALM 36

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. Of the servant of
Jehovah, \[even\] of David

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p4"></span>**1** Ungodliness saith to the wicked man
in the midst of my heart, There is no fear of God before his eyes.

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p5"></span>**2** For he flattereth himself in his
own eyes, Until his iniquity be found to be hateful.

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p6"></span>**3** The words of his mouth are iniquity
and deceit, He teaseth to understand that he may do good.

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p7"></span>**4** Iniquity he meditates upon his bed;
He setteth himself in a way not good; Evil he doth not abhor.

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p8"></span>**5** O Jehovah! unto the heavens is thy
mercy, Thy truth even unto the clouds.

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p9"></span>**6** Thy justice is like the great
mountains, Thy judgments are a great deep. Man and beast, thou
preservest, O Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p10"></span>**7** How precious is thy
loving-kindness, O God! Therefore the sons of men in the shadow of thy
wings shall trust.

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p11"></span>**8** They shall be fully satisfied with
the fatness of thy house; And of the river of thy pleasures thou shalt
cause them to drink.

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p12"></span>**9** For with thee is the fountain of
life, And in thy light shall we see light.

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p13"></span>**10** Extend thy mercy to those who
know thee, And thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p14"></span>**11** Let not the foot of pride come
upon me; And the hand of the ungodly let it not remove me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.i-p15"></span>**12** There fallen are the workers of
iniquity; They are thrust down and shall not be able to stand.  <span

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p2"></span>PSALM 37

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p3"></span>Of David

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p4"></span>**1** Vex not thyself because of the
wicked, Nor be envious on account of the workers of iniquity.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p5"></span>**2** For like the grass quickly shall
they be cut down; And as the green herb they shall wither.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p6"></span>**3** Trust thou in Jehovah, and do
good; Dwell in the land, and be fed in truth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p7"></span>**4** And delight in Jehovah, And he
will grant thee the request of thy heart.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p8"></span>**5** Devolve upon Jehovah thy ways, And
trust in him, and he will bring it to pass.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p9"></span>**6** And he will bring forth as the
light thy righteousness, And thy judgments as the noonday.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p10"></span>**7** Be silent to Jehovah, and wait
for him; Vex not thyself at him who prospereth in his way, At the man
who committeth wickedness.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p11"></span>**8** Cease from anger, forsake wrath,
Vex not thyself so as to commit sin.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p12"></span>**9** For the wicked shall be cut off;
But those who wait for Jehovah shall inherit the earth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p13"></span>**10** Yet a little while, and the
ungodly shall not be; And thou shalt give attention to his place, and
shalt not find *him*

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p14"></span>**11** But the meek ones shall inherit
the earth, And shall be delighted in the abundance of peace.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p15"></span>**12** Plot doth the ungodly against
the righteous, And gnasheth against him with his teeth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p16"></span>**13** The Lord shall laugh at him, For
he seeth that coming is his day.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p17"></span>**14** *Their* sword draw do the
ungodly, And their bow they bend, To lay prostrate the poor and needy,
To slay those who are upright in the way.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p18"></span>**15** *But* their sword shall enter
into their own heart, And their bow shall be broken.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p19"></span>**16** Better is a little to the
righteous man, Than the wealth of the ungodly who are great.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p20"></span>**17** For the arms of the ungodly
shall be broken; But Jehovah sustaineth the righteous.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p21"></span>**18** Know doth Jehovah the days of
the upright, And their inheritance for ever shall be.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p22"></span>**19** They shall not be put to shame
in the time of adversity; And in the days of famine they shall be
satisfied.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p23"></span>**20** For the ungodly shall perish,
And the enemies of Jehovah like the fattest of lambs shall be consumed;
Into smoke they shall be consumed.;

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p24"></span>**21** Borrow doth the ungodly man, and
doth not repay; But the righteous man is compassionate and giveth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p25"></span>**22** For those who are blessed of him
shall inherit the earth, And those who are cursed of him shall be cut
off.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p26"></span>**23** By Jehovah the steps of a man
are directed, And his way he will love.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p27"></span>**24** When he shall fall he shall not
be bruised, For Jehovah putteth under \[*him*\] his hand.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p28"></span>**25** Young I have been, I have also
grown old; And yet I have not seen the righteous man forsaken, Nor his
seed begging for bread.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p29"></span>**26** Daily he is compassionate and
lendeth, And his seed is for blessing.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p30"></span>**27** Depart from evil and do good,
And dwell for ever.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p31"></span>**28** For Jehovah loveth judgment, And
doth not forsake his meek ones; For ever shall they be preserved: And
the seed of the ungodly shall be cut off.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p32"></span>**29** The righteous shall inherit the
earth, And shall dwell for ever upon it.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p33"></span>**30** The mouth of the righteous shall
speak wisdom;

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p34"></span>**31** The law of his God is in his
heart; Slide not shall his steps.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p35"></span>**32** Watch doth the ungodly the
righteous man, And seeketh to put him to death.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p36"></span>**33** Jehovah will not leave him in
his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p37"></span>**34** Wait for Jehovah, and keep his
way, And he shall exalt thee to inherit the earth: When the ungodly
shall be cut off thou shalt see it.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p38"></span>**35** I have seen the ungodly man
robust,  <span id="fr_323"></span>[324](#fn_323) And spreading himself
like a green bay tree;

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p40"></span>**36** And he passed away, and to I he
was not; And I sought for his place, and he was not found.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p41"></span>**37** Mark the perfect man, and
consider the upright; For the end of such a man is peace.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p42"></span>**38** But transgressors shall be
destroyed together: The end of the ungodly shall be cut off.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p43"></span>**39** But the salvation of the
righteous is from Jehovah: *He will* be their strength in the time of
trouble.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ii-p44"></span>**40** And help them shall Jehovah, and
deliver them: He shall deliver them from the wicked: He shall save them,
because they trust in him.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p2"></span>PSALM 38

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p3"></span>A Psalm of David: to bring to
remembrance

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p4"></span>**1** O Jehovah! do not in thy fury
rebuke me, And in thy wrath do not chasten me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p5"></span>**2** For thy arrows go down in me, And
descend upon me doth thy hand.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p6"></span>**3** There is no soundness in my
flesh, because of thy wrath, Nor peace in my bones because of my sin.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p7"></span>**4** For my iniquities have passed
over my head, Like a burden that is weighty, they are too heavy for me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p8"></span>**5** Putrid \[*and*\] corrupt have my
wounds become, Because of my foolishness.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p9"></span>**6** I am bowed down, I am brought low
exceedingly; Day by day a mourner I do walk:

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p10"></span>**7** For my reins are filled with a
burning heat; Nor is there soundness in my flesh.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p11"></span>**8** I am enfeebled and broken
exceedingly: I have roared through the disquietude of my heart.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p12"></span>**9** O Lord! before thee is all my
desire, And my groaning from thee is not hidden,

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p13"></span>**10** My heart hath throbbed,
forsaken me hath my strength; And the light of my eyes, it also is gone
from me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p14"></span>**11** My friends and my companions
aloof from my stroke have stood, And my kinsmen afar off have stood.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p15"></span>**12** And they have laid snares who
sought for my soul; Arid those who sought my hurt have threatened
mischiefs; And deceits daily do they meditate.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p16"></span>**13** But as for me, like a deaf man
I hear not; And *I am* like a dumb man who openeth not his mouth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p17"></span>**14** And I was as a man who doth not
hear, And in whose mouth there are no reproofs.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p18"></span>**15** For on thee, O Jehovah! do I
wait: Thou wilt answer *me*, O Lord, my God!

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p19"></span>**16** For I said, “Lest they should
rejoice over me:” At the slipping of my foot against me they magnified
themselves,

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p20"></span>**17** Surely as for me I am ready to
halt; And my sorrow is before me continually.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p21"></span>**18** Surely my iniquity I declare; I
am in consternation because of my sin.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p22"></span>**19** But my enemies are living;
 <span id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324) they are strong; And those are
become mighty who hate me wrongfully.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p24"></span>**20** And they who requite me evil
for good are against me, Because I follow \[*what is*\] good.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p25"></span>**21** Forsake me not, O Jehovah, my
God! Be not far from me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iii-p26"></span>**22** Hasten to my help, O Lord, my
salvation!

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p2"></span>PSALM 39

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician, Jeduthun. A Psalm
of David

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p4"></span>**1** I said “I will take heed to my
ways, “That I sin not with my tongue: “I will keep my mouth with a
muzzle, “While the ungodly man standeth before me.”

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p5"></span>**2** I was dumb not uttering a word; I
held my peace \[*even*\] from good; And my sorrow was stirred.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p6"></span>**3** My heart became hot within me; In
my musing a fire did burn; I spake with my tongue.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p7"></span>**4** Cause me to know, O Jehovah! my
end, And the number of my days, That I may know of what duration I am.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p8"></span>**5** Behold! as an handbreadth thou
hast made my days, And my duration is as nothing before thee: Surely
altogether vanity is every mart while he standeth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p9"></span>**6** Surely in a shadow man walketh;
\[Selah. Surely in vain is he disquieted: They heap together, and know
not who shall gather.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p10"></span>**7** And now what do I wait for, O
Lord? My hope is towards thee.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p11"></span>**8** From all my sins deliver thou me:
The reproach of the foolish make me not.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p12"></span>**9** I was dumb; I will not open my
mouth, Because thou hast done it.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p13"></span>**10** Remove from me thy stroke: By
the blow of thy hand I have failed.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p14"></span>**11** With rebukes for iniquity thou
chastisest man; And causest to waste away as a moth his beauty: Surely
vanity *is* every man. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p15"></span>**12** Hear my prayer, O Jehovah! And
to my cry give ear; At my tears be not silent; For a stranger am I
before thee, A sojourner like all my fathers.

<span id="xxxv.ii.iv-p16"></span>**13** Let me alone, that I may recover
strength, Before I depart and be no more.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p4"></span>**1** I have patiently waited for
Jehovah, And he inclined to me, and heard my cry.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p5"></span>**2** And he drew me out of the roaring
pit, Out of the mire of clay, And set upon a rock my feet; He hath
established my steps.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p6"></span>**3** And he hath put in my mouth a song
\[that is\] new, *Even* praise to our God: See shall many and shall
fear, And shall trust in Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p7"></span>**4** Blessed is the man who maketh
Jehovah his confidence, And hath not respected the proud, Nor those who
turn aside to lying.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p8"></span>**5** Many, O Jehovah, my God! are thy
wonderful works which thou hast done; And thy thoughts towards us it is
impossible to reckon up in order to thee: I will declare and speak \[*of
them;*\] \[But\] they are more than can be told.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p9"></span>**6** Sacrifice and oblation thou hast
not taken pleasure in: *But* my ears hast thou made fit:  <span
id="fr_325"></span>[326](#fn_325) Burnt-offering and sin-offering thou
hast not required.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p11"></span>**7** Then I said, “Behold! I come; “In
the volume of the book it is written of me,

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p12"></span>**8** “That I may do thy pleasure, O my
God! “I have desired *to do it*, “And thy law is in the midst of my
bowels.”

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p13"></span>**9** I have proclaimed thy
righteousness in the assembly great: Behold my lips I will not restrain;
O Jehovah! thou knowest it.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p14"></span>**10** Thy righteousness I have not
hidden within my heart; Thy truth and thy salvation I have declared: I
have not concealed thy goodness and thy truth in the assembly great.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p15"></span>**11** O thou, Jehovah! withhold not thy
compassions from me; Let thy goodness and thy truth continually preserve
me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p16"></span>**12** For encompassed me have evils
innumerable; Laid hold upon me have my iniquities, *yea in so great
number* that I cannot see them: They are more in number than the hairs
of my head; *And* my heart hath failed me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p17"></span>**13** Let it please thee, O Jehovah! to
deliver me; O Jehovah! to my aid make haste.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p18"></span>**14** Let them be put to shame and
confounded together Who seek after my soul to destroy it; Let them be
turned backward and put to shame Who seek after my hurt.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p19"></span>**15** Let them be destroyed for a
reward of their shame, Who have said to me, “Aha! aha!”

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p20"></span>**16** Let all those exult and rejoice
in thee who seek thee; And let those say continually, “May Jehovah be
magnified” — “Those who love thy salvation.

<span id="xxxv.ii.v-p21"></span>**17** But as for me *I am* poor and
needy. Jehovah hath regarded me; My help and my deliverer *art thou*: O
thou, my God! delay not.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p4"></span>**1** Blessed is he who judgeth wisely
of the poor: In the day of evil Jehovah will deliver him.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p5"></span>**2** Jehovah will keep him, and
preserve him alive: He shall be blessed upon the earth: And thou will
not give him up to the desire of his enemies.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p6"></span>**3** Jehovah will support him upon the
bed of sorrow: All his bed thou hast turned in his sickness.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p7"></span>**4** I have said, “O Jehovah! have
mercy upon me; ” “Heal my soul, for I have sinned against thee.”

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p8"></span>**5** My enemies have spoken evil of me,
“When will he die, and perish shall his name?“

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p9"></span>**6** And if he come to see me falsely
doth he speak; His heart gathereth iniquity to itself’: When he goeth
abroad he speaketh \[*it*.\]

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p10"></span>**7** Together against me do all my
haters whisper; Against me do they devise evil for me, \[*saying*,\]

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p11"></span>**8** “An evil deed of Belial cleaveth
fast to him; “And he who lieth shall not rise again.”

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p12"></span>**9** Even the man of my peace in whom
I trusted, Who eateth of my bread, hath lifted up against me the heel.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p13"></span>**10** Do thou *then*, O Jehovah! have
mercy upon me; Raise me up, and I will recompense them.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p14"></span>**11** By this I have known that I have
been acceptable to thee, Because my enemy shall not triumph over me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p15"></span>**12** And as for me, in my integrity
thou wilt uphold me, And wilt establish me before thy face for ever.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vi-p16"></span>**13** Blessed *be* Jehovah, the God of
Israel, For ever and ever. Amen and Amen.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p4"></span>PSALM 42

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p5"></span>To the Chief Musician. A lesson of
instruction to the Sons of Korah

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p6"></span>**1** As the hart crieth for the
fountains of waters, So my soul crieth for thee, O God!

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p7"></span>**2** Thirsted hath my soul for God,
for the living God: When shall I come to appear before the face of God?

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p8"></span>**3** To me have my tears been *for*
bread, by day and night, While it is said to me daily, “Where is thy
God?“

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p9"></span>**4** When these things I remember, I
pour out within me my soul, Because I had gone with the procession,
Leading them even to the house of God, With the voice of exultation and
praise, — The multitude dancing for joy.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p10"></span>**5** ‘Why art thou cast down, O my
soul! And why art thou disquieted within me? Wait thou for God; for I
shall yet give him thanks, \[*For*\] the salvations of his countenance.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p11"></span>**6** O my God! my soul within me is
cast down, When I remember thee from the land of Jordan and of Hermonim,
From the mountain Mizar.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p12"></span>**7** Deep unto deep calleth at the
noise of thy waterspouts: All thy waves and all thy billows over me have
gone.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p13"></span>**8** By day command will Jehovah his
loving-kindness, And by night his song *shall be* with me, And prayer to
the God of my life.

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p14"></span>**9** I will say to God, my Rock, “Why
hast thou forgotten me? “Why mourning do I go because of the oppression
of *my* enemy?”

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p15"></span>**10** \[*It is as*\] a wound in my
bones when my enemies reproach me, Saying to me daily, “Where is thy
God?“

<span id="xxxv.ii.vii-p16"></span>**11** Why art thou cast down, O my
soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope in God; for I shall
yet give thanks to him, The salvations of my countenance, and my God.

<span id="xxxv.ii.viii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.ii.viii-p2"></span>PSALM 43

<span id="xxxv.ii.viii-p3"></span>**1** Judge me, O God! and plead my
cause: From a people without mercy, from a man deceitful and wicked
deliver me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.viii-p4"></span>**2** For thou *art* the God of my
strength; Why art thou estranged from me? Why mourning do I go because
of the oppression of the enemy?

<span id="xxxv.ii.viii-p5"></span>**3** Send forth thy light and thy
truth; Let them direct me, let them conduct me, To the mountain of thy
holiness, and to thy tabernacles.

<span id="xxxv.ii.viii-p6"></span>**4** And I will go to the altar of
God, To the God of the joy of my rejoicing; And I will celebrate thee
upon the harp, O God, my God!

<span id="xxxv.ii.viii-p7"></span>**5** Why art thou cast down, O my
soul! And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope in God, for I shall
yet celebrate him, *Who is* the salvation of my countenance and my God.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p2"></span>PSALM 44

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. Of the sons of
Korah. Giving instruction

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p4"></span>**1** O God! with our ears we have
heard, Our fathers have told us, The work which thou hast done in their
days, In the days of old.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p5"></span>**2** Thou with thy hand hast expelled
the heathen, and planted them: Thou hast wasted the peoples and
multiplied them:

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p6"></span>**3** For not by their own sword
acquired they the land, And their own arm did not save them; But thy
right hand and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance, Because thou
wast favorable to them.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p7"></span>**4** Thou, even thou, *art* my King; O
God! command salvations for Jacob.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p8"></span>**5** Through thee our adversaries with
the horn we have pushed; In thy name we have trampled under foot those
who rise up against us.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p9"></span>**6** For not in my bow will I trust,
And my sword will not save me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p10"></span>**7** Surely thou hast saved us from
our enemies, And our haters thou hast put to shame.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p11"></span>**8** In God we will boast all the day,
And thy name for ever shall we praise. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p12"></span>**9** Nevertheless thou hast abhorred
us and put us to shame, And thou goest not forth *any more* with our
armies.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p13"></span>**10** Thou hast made us to turn back
from him that afflicteth us, And our haters have spoiled *us* for
themselves.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p14"></span>**11** Thou hast given us as sheep for
food; And among the heathen thou hast scattered us.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p15"></span>**12** Thou hast sold thy people, and
not become rich, And thou hast not increased the price of them.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p16"></span>**13** Thou hast made us a reproach to
our neighbors, A scorn and derision to those who are round about us.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p17"></span>**14** Thou hast made us a byword among
the heathen, A shaking of the head among the peoples.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p18"></span>**15** Daily *is* my reproach before
me, And the shame of my face hath *quite* covered me,

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p19"></span>**16** Because of the voice of him who
reproacheth and revileth, Because of the face of the adversary and
avenger.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p20"></span>**17** All this is come upon us, and we
have not forgotten thee, Nor dealt perfidiously in thy covenant;

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p21"></span>**18** Not turned back hath our heart,
Nor declined have our steps from thy path.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p22"></span>**19** Although thou hast crushed us in
the place of dragons, And covered us with the shadow of death.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p23"></span>**20** If we have forgotten the name of
our God, And have spread forth our hands to a God that is strange;

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p24"></span>**21** Shall not God search out this?
For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p25"></span>**22** Surely for thy sake we are
killed daily; We are accounted as sheep \[*appointed*\] for slaughter.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p26"></span>**23** Arise, why sleepest thou, O
Lord? Awake, do not forget *us* for ever.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p27"></span>**24** Wherefore thy face dost thou
hide? Wilt thou forget our misery and our affliction?

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p28"></span>**25** For humbled to the dust is our
soul; Cleave to the earth doth our belly.

<span id="xxxv.ii.ix-p29"></span>**26** Arise for our help, And redeem
us for the sake of thy loving-kindness.

Of the sons of Korah. Giving instruction. A Song of loves

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p4"></span>**1** Boiling over is my heart to speak a
goodly theme, Speak shall I myself of my works concerning the King: My
tongue is as the pen of a swift writer.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p5"></span>**2** Thou art fair above the sons of
men; Diffused is grace on thy lips; Because God hath blessed thee for
ever.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p6"></span>**3** Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O
mighty one! With majesty and glory.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p7"></span>**4** And in thy majesty prosper thou;
Ride forth upon the word of truth, and meekness and righteousness; And
thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things:

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p8"></span>**5** Thy arrows *are* sharp (so that the
people fall under thee) In the hearts of the enemies of the king.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p9"></span>**6** Thy throne, O God! *is* for ever
and ever; The scepter of rectitude *is* the scepter of thy kingdom.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p10"></span>**7** Thou lovest righteousness and
hatest impiety; Because anointed thee hath God, thy God, With the oil of
gladness above thy fellows.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p11"></span>**8** Myrrh, and aloes and cassia
\[*are*\] *in* all thy garments, Out of the ivory palaces, whence they
have made thee glad.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p12"></span>**9** The daughters of kings \[*were*\]
among thy maids of honor; Stand did thy consort at thy right hand in
gold of Ophir.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p13"></span>**10** Hearken, O daughter! and consider
and incline thy ear; And forget thy people, and the house of thy father.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p14"></span>**11** And enamored shall be the King
with thy beauty; For he *is* thy Lord, and thou shalt worship him.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p15"></span>**12** And the daughter of Tyre \[*shall
come*\] with a present; Thy favor entreat shall the rich among the
people.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p16"></span>**13** All glorious is the daughter of
the King within; Of garments embroidered with gold *is* her clothing.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p17"></span>**14** In raiment of needle-work she
shall be brought to the King; Her virgins that follow her, her
companions shall be brought to thee.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p18"></span>**15** They shall be brought with joy
and exultation; They shall enter into the palace of the King.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p19"></span>**16** Instead of thy fathers shall be
thy children; Thou shalt make them princes in all the earth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.x-p20"></span>**17** I will make thy name to be
remembered throughout all generation; Therefore celebrate thee shall the
peoples for ever and ever.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xi-p4"></span>**1** God is to us a protection and
strength; A help in troubles he is found exceedingly.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xi-p5"></span>**2** Therefore we will not fear when
moved shall be the earth, And fall shall the mountains into the heart of
the sea.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xi-p6"></span>**3** \[*When*\] roar and rage
tempestuously shall the waters thereof; \[*When*\] shake shall the
mountains with the swelling thereof. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xi-p7"></span>**4** The streams of her river shall
make glad the city of God, The Sanctuary of the tabernacles of the Most
High.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xi-p8"></span>**5** God *is* in the midst of her; she
shall not be moved: Help her will God at the dawn of the morning.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xi-p9"></span>**6** Rage did the peoples, moved were
the kingdoms: He uttered his voice, melt did the earth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xi-p10"></span>**7** Jehovah of armies *is* with us; A
fortress for us *is* the God of Jacob. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xi-p11"></span>**8** Come ye, consider the works of
Jehovah, What desolations he hath wrought in the earth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xi-p12"></span>**9** He maketh to cease battles, even
to the ends of the earth; He breaketh the bow, he shattereth in pieces
the arms; The chariot he burneth with fire.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xi-p13"></span>**10** Be still and know that I am God:
I will be exalted among the heathen; I will be exalted in the earth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xi-p14"></span>**11** Jehovah of armies is with us; A
fortress for us *is* the God of Jacob. Selah.

Shout unto God with the voice of exultation;

<span id="xxxv.ii.xii-p5"></span>**2** For Jehovah *is* high, terrible,
A great king over all the earth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xii-p6"></span>**3** He hath put in order the people
under us, And the nations under our feet.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xii-p7"></span>**4** He hath chosen for us our
inheritance, The glory of Jacob, whom he hath loved. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xii-p8"></span>**5** Gone up is God with a shout,

belong the shields of the earth: He is greatly exalted.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiii-p5"></span>**2** Beautiful for situation, the joy
of the whole earth, The mountain of Zion, on the sides of the north, The
city of the great King.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiii-p6"></span>**3** God in her palaces is known for
a defense.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiii-p7"></span>**4** For behold! the kings assembled,
They passed away together.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiii-p8"></span>**5** They themselves saw, so they
marveled; They were frightened, they fled precipitately,

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiii-p9"></span>**6** Fear seized upon them there,
Pain as of one in travail.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiii-p10"></span>**7** By the east wind thou breakest

*is* thy praise unto the ends of the earth: Of righteousness full is thy
right hand.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiii-p14"></span>**11** Rejoice shall Mount Zion,
Exult shall the daughters of Judah, Because of thy judgments.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiii-p15"></span>**12** Encompass Zion, and walk round
about her. Number the towers thereof,

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiii-p16"></span>**13** Set your heart to her walls,
Exalt her towers, That ye may make report to the generations to come.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p5"></span>**2** Both ye sons of Adam, and ye sons

ear: I will open upon the harp my enigma.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p8"></span>**5** Wherefore should I fear in the
days of evil? The iniquity of my heel shall compass me about.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p9"></span>**6** They trust in their wealth, And
in the multitude of their riches do glory.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p10"></span>**7** The brother shall not be able to
redeem; None shall give to God the price of his redemption.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p11"></span>**8** And precious shall be the
redemption of their soul, And *their* continuance for ever:

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p12"></span>**9** That he should still live for
ever, And not see the grave.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p13"></span>**10** For he shall see that wise men
die, Together the fool and the brutish person shall perish, And leave to
strangers their wealth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p14"></span>**11** Their inward thought is \[*how
to make*\] their houses \[*to continue*\] for ever, Their
dwelling-places from generation to generation: They have called out
their names upon the earth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p15"></span>**12** And man in honor shall not
abide; He hath become like the beasts: they perish.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p16"></span>**13** This their way *is* foolishness
in them, And their posterity in their saying will acquiesce. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p17"></span>**14** Like sleep in the grave they
are laid; Death shall feed them; And have dominion over them shall the
upright in the morning, And their strength shall wax old; The grave
*shall receive* them from their dwelling.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p18"></span>**15** But God shall redeem my soul
from the hand of the grave; For he hath taken me up. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p19"></span>**16** Be not thou afraid when a man
shall become rich, When increased shall be the glory of his house;

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p20"></span>**17** For he shall not at his death
carry all away: Descend not after him shall his glory:

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p21"></span>**18** For his soul in his lifetime he
will bless, And they shall praise thee when thou doest well to thyself.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p22"></span>**19** He shall come to the age of his
fathers, Even for ever he shall not see the light.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xiv-p23"></span>**20** Man *is* in honor, and will not
understand: He hath become like the beasts: they shall perish.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p2"></span>PSALM 51

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of
David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to
Bathsheba

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p4"></span>**1** Have pity upon me, O God!
according to thy mercy; According to the multitude of thy compassions
blot out my iniquities.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p5"></span>**2** Multiply to wash me from my sin,
And from my wickedness do thou cleanse me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p6"></span>**3** For my sins I know, And my
wickedness is before me continually.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p7"></span>**4** Against thee, against thee only,
have I sinned, And that which was displeasing in thy sight have I done;
That thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, And be pure in giving
judgment.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p8"></span>**5** Behold in iniquity I was born,
And in sin conceive me did my mother.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p9"></span>**6** Behold, truth thou hast loved in
the inmost parts, And in secret, wisdom thou hast made me know.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p10"></span>**7** Thou shalt purge me with hyssop,
and I shall be clean; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than
snow.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p11"></span>**8** Make me to hear joy and
gladness; And exult shall the bones which thou hast broken.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p12"></span>**9** Hide thy face from my sins, And
all my iniquities blot out.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p13"></span>**10** A heart \[*that is*\] clean
create in me, O God! And a spirit \[*that is*\] right renew in my inward
parts.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p14"></span>**11** Cast me not away from thy face,
And the Spirit of thy holiness take not from me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p15"></span>**12** Restore to me the joy of thy
salvation, And with a free spirit uphold me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p16"></span>**13** I will teach transgressors thy
ways, the ungodly to time shall be converted.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p17"></span>**14** Deliver me from bloods, O God!
O God of my salvation! And sing aloud shall my tongue of thy
righteousness.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p18"></span>**15** O Lord! my lips do thou open,
And my mouth shall show forth thy praise.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p19"></span>**16** For thou wilt not accept a
sacrifice; Though I should give a burnt-offering, it would not please
thee.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p20"></span>**17** The sacrifices of God are an
afflicted spirit: A heart afflicted and contrite, O God! thou wilt not
despise.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p21"></span>**18** Do good in thy good pleasure to
Zion; Build thou the walls of Jerusalem.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p22"></span>**19** Then shalt thou accept the
sacrifices of righteousness, The burnt-offering and oblation;  <span
id="fr_327"></span>[328](#fn_327) Then shall come upon thy altar calves.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p2"></span>PSALM 52

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. A lesson of
instruction of David: when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said
to him, that David had come into the house of Abimelech

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p4"></span>**1** Why dost thou glory in thy
wickedness, O mighty man? The goodness of God *continueth* daily.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p5"></span>**2** Thy tongue reckoneth up
mischiefs, Like a razor \[*that is*\] sharp working deceitfully.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p6"></span>**3** Thou lovest wickedness more than
goodness; Falsehood more than to speak righteousness. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p7"></span>**4** Thou lovest all words of deceit,
O thou tongue of guilefulness!

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p8"></span>**5** Likewise God shall destroy thee
for ever: He shall lay hold on thee and pluck thee out of thy
tabernacle, And root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p9"></span>**6** See it also shall the righteous
ones, and shall fear, And at him they shall laugh.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p10"></span>**7** Behold! the man who made not
God his strength; And trusted in the abundance of his riches, And was
strong in his wickedness.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p11"></span>**8** But as for me *I shall be* like
an olive-tree \[*that is*\] green in the house of God: I have trusted in
the goodness of God for ever and ever.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p12"></span>**9** I will celebrate thee for ever,
because thou hast done \[*it*:\]  <span
id="fr_328"></span>[329](#fn_328) I will wait on thy name, For it is
good in the presence of thy meek ones.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xviii-p2"></span>PSALM 53

<span id="xxxv.ii.xviii-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician, upon Mahalath.
A lesson of instruction ofDavid

<span id="xxxv.ii.xviii-p4"></span>**1** The fool hath said in his
heart, “There is not a God:” They have corrupted \[*all good order*,\]
they have done abominable work: There is none who doeth good.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xviii-p5"></span>**2** God from heaven looked down
upon the sons of men, To see if there was any who did understand, Who
did seek after God.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xviii-p6"></span>**3** Every one of them hath gone
back; They have all together become corrupt: There is none that doeth
good, not even one.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xviii-p7"></span>**4** Have they no knowledge, all
*these* workers of iniquity? Eating my people \[*as*\] they eat bread:
Upon Jehovah they have not called.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xviii-p8"></span>**5** There were they afraid with
fear, where there was not fear; For scattered hath Jehovah the bones of
him that encampeth against thee: Thou hast put them to shame because God
hath despised them.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xviii-p9"></span>**6** Who shall give out of Zion
deliverance to Israel? When bring back shall God the captivity of his
people, Rejoice shall Jacob, exult shall Israel.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xix-p2"></span>PSALM 54

<span id="xxxv.ii.xix-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician, on Neginoth. A
lesson of instruction of David. When the Ziphims came and said to Saul,
“Doth not David hide himself with us?”

<span id="xxxv.ii.xix-p4"></span>**1** O God! by thy name save me, And
by thy strength judge me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xix-p5"></span>**2** O God! hear my prayer, Give ear
to the words of my mouth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xix-p6"></span>**3** For strangers have risen up
against me, And terrible ones have sought after my soul: They have not
set God before them. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xix-p7"></span>**4** Behold! God is a helper to me;
The Lord is with those who uphold my soul.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xix-p8"></span>**5** He shall repay evil to my
adversaries: In thy truth cut them off.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xix-p9"></span>**6** Willingly will I sacrifice to
thee; I will celebrate thy name, O Jehovah! for it is good.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xix-p10"></span>**7** For out of all trouble he hath
delivered me; And \[*punishment*\] upon my adversaries mine eye hath
seen.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician on Neginoth. A
lesson of instruction of David

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p4"></span>**1** Give ear, O God! to my prayer, And
hide not thyself from my supplication.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p5"></span>**2** Attend to me, and answer me: I
will wail in my address, and will become tumultuous.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p6"></span>**3** By reason of the voice of the
enemy — Under the oppression of the ungodly; For they cast upon me
iniquity, In wrath they set themselves against me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p7"></span>**4** My heart trembleth within me, And
the terrors of death have fallen upon me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p8"></span>**5** Fear and trembling are come upon
me, And horror hath overwhelmed me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p9"></span>**6** And I said, “Who will give me
wings like a dove? “I will fly away and be at rest.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p10"></span>**7** “Lo! I will flee far away, “I
will repose in the desert. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p11"></span>**8** “I will hasten my escape from the
tempestuous whirlwind.”

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p12"></span>**9** Destroy, O Lord! divide their
tongue: For I have seen oppression and strife in the city.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p13"></span>**10** By day and night they go round
it upon the walls thereof: And labor and sorrow are in the midst of it.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p14"></span>**11** Wickedness  <span
id="fr_329"></span>[330](#fn_329) is in the midst of it; And fraud and
deceit depart not from the streets thereof.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p16"></span>**12** Truly it was not an enemy who
reproached me, For \[*then*\] I could have borne \[*it*:\] *It was* not
an adversary who magnified himself against me, For \[*then*\] I would
have hid himself from him.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p17"></span>**13** But thou, a man according to my
own rank, My guide, and my familiar friend.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p18"></span>**14** We sweetly exchanged our secret
thoughts; Into the house of God we walked in company.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p19"></span>**15** Let death seize upon them, Let
them descend into the grave alive; For wickedness  <span
id="fr_330"></span>[331](#fn_330) *is* I, their dwelling, in the midst
of them.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p21"></span>**16** As for me, to God; will I cry,
And Jehovah shall save me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p22"></span>**17** In the evening, and the morning,
and at noonday Will I pray, and cry aloud; And he shall hear my voice.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p23"></span>**18** He hath redeemed into peace my
soul From the battle which was against me: For many were with me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p24"></span>**19** Hear shall God, and shall
afflict them, Even he who sitteth from ancient time. Selah. Because they
have no changes, And fear not God.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p25"></span>**20** He hath set his hands against
those who were at peace with him: He hath broken his covenant.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p26"></span>**21** Smoother than butter are the
words of his mouth, And *in* his heart *is* war; Softer are his words
than oil, And \[*yet*\] they *are* darts.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p27"></span>**22** Cast upon Jehovah whatever
blessings thou askest from him,  <span id="fr_331"></span>[332](#fn_331)
And he shall feed thee; He shall not suffer for ever the righteous man
to stagger.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p29"></span>**23** Thou, O God! shalt cast them
into the pit of corruption: The men of blood and deceit shall not live
out half their days: But as for me, I will hope in thee.

dove in distant places. Michtam of David, when the Philistines took him
in Gath

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p4"></span>**1** Have mercy upon me, O God, For
swallow me up doth man; He daily assaulting doth oppress me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p5"></span>**2** Swallow me up do *my* enemies
daily: Truly many *strive* to oppress me, *O Jehovah*, Most High!

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p6"></span>**3** In the day when I was afraid, I
in thee did trust.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p7"></span>**4** In God I will praise his word; In
God have I trusted; I will not fear what flesh can do to me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p8"></span>**5** Every day my words disquiet me;
Against me *are* all their thoughts for evil.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p9"></span>**6** They assemble together, they hide
themselves, My heels they watch, Because they desire my soul.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p10"></span>**7** In *their* iniquity *they think*
there is escape for them: In *thy* wrath the peoples thou wilt cast
down, O God!

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p11"></span>**8** My wanderings thou numbereth,
even thou: Put my tears into thy bottle; Are they not in thy register?

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p12"></span>**9** Then my enemies shall be turned
back in the day when I cry: This I know, because God is with me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p13"></span>**10** In God will I praise \[*his*\]
word; In Jehovah will I praise \[*his*\] word.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p14"></span>**11** In God have I trusted; I will
not fear what man can do to me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p15"></span>**12** Upon me, O God! are thy vows, I
will render praises to thee.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxi-p16"></span>**13** For thou hast delivered my soul
from death: Hast thou not *also delivered* my feet from falling? That I
may walk before God in the light of the living.

Michtam of David. When he fled from the face of Saul in the cave

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxii-p4"></span>**1** Have mercy upon me, O God! have
mercy upon me; For in thee my soul doth trust; And in the shadow of thy
wings will I hope, Until iniquity pass away.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxii-p5"></span>**2** I will cry to God Most High, Who
perfecteth \[*his work*\] towards me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxii-p6"></span>**3** He shall send from Heaven, And
shall save me from the reproach of him who swalloweth me up: Send forth
shall God his mercy and his truth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxii-p7"></span>**4** My soul is in the midst of
lions; I lie among those who are set on fire, — Among the sons of men,
whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sword \[*that
is*\] sharp.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxii-p8"></span>**5** Be thou exalted above the
heavens, O God! Above all the earth thy glory.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxii-p9"></span>**6** A net they have prepared for my
steps: Bowed down is my soul: They have digged before me a pit, *But*
they have fallen into it. Selah

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxii-p10"></span>**7** Prepared *is* my heart, O God!
prepared *is* my heart: I will sing, and chant psalms.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxii-p11"></span>**8** Awake my tongue, awake nablum
 <span id="fr_332"></span>[333](#fn_332) and harp: I will awake at dawn
of day.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxii-p13"></span>**9** I will celebrate thee, among
the peoples, O Lord! I will sing psalms to thee among the nation:

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxii-p14"></span>**10** For great unto the heavens is
thy goodness, And unto the clouds thy truth.

Michtam of David

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p4"></span>**1** Do ye indeed, O ye
congregation! speak righteousness? Uprightly do ye judge? O ye sons of
men!

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p5"></span>**2** Yea rather in *your* heart
wickedness ye plot, On the earth violence your hands weigh out.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p6"></span>**3** Estranged are the ungodly from
the womb, They have gone astray from their birth speaking falsehood.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p7"></span>**4** They have poison like the
poison of a serpent, \[*They are*\] like the deaf adder which stoppeth
her ear;

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p8"></span>**5** Which listeneth not to the
voice of the enchanter, — Of him who exerciseth enchantment skillfully.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p9"></span>**6** O God! break their teeth in
their mouth: The jawbones of the lions break, O Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p10"></span>**7** Let them melt away like water,
let them be gone: Let them bend their bow, and let their arrows be as if
broken.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p11"></span>**8** Like a snail which melteth
away let them vanish; Like the untimely birth of a woman which doth not
see the sun.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p12"></span>**9** Before your pots can feel the
fire of the bramble, *Like* flesh yet raw as a whirlwind he shall carry
him away.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p13"></span>**10** Rejoice shall the righteous
when he seeth the vengeance; His hands he shall wash in the blood of the
ungodly.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p14"></span>**11** And men  <span

God! from those who rise up against me set me on high.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p5"></span>**2** Deliver me from the workers of
iniquity, And from men of bloods save me:

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p6"></span>**3** For lo! they have laid snares
for my soul; Gathered together against me have the strong men; Not
\[*for*\] my sin, nor \[*for*\] my wickedness, O Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p7"></span>**4** Without *any* iniquity *of mine*
they have run and prepared themselves. Awake and come to meet me, and
behold.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p8"></span>**5** And thou, O Jehovah, God of
armies! the God of Israel! Awake to visit all the nations; Do not have
compassion upon any who transgress wickedly. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p9"></span>**6** They will return at evening;
They will make a noise like a dog, And go round about the city.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p10"></span>**7** Behold they will prate with
their mouth; Swords are in their lips; “For who,” *say they*, “will
hear?”

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p11"></span>**8** But thou, O Jehovah! shalt
laugh at them; Thou shalt hold in derision all the nations.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p12"></span>**9** His strength with thee I will
put in trust; For God is my fortress.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p13"></span>**10** The God of my mercy shall
prevent me; God will make me see my desire upon my enemies.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p14"></span>**11** Slay them not, lest my people
should forget; Make them to wander by thy power; And bring them down, O
Lord, our shield!

words of their lips: Let them be taken in their pride: of cursing and
lying let them speak.

for food; If they be not satisfied they will even stay all night.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p21"></span>**16** But as for me, I will sing of
thy strength, I will praise in the morning thy mercy; For thou hast been
a fortress to me, And a refuge in the day of my trouble.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p22"></span>**17** My strength is with thee, I
will sing psalms; For God *is* my fortress, the God of my mercy.

thou hast scattered us; Thou hast been angry, O return to us!

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxv-p5"></span>**2** To tremble thou hast made the
earth; Thou hast caused it to open wide; Heal the breaches thereof for

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxv-p6"></span>**3** Thou hast showed to thy people a
hard thing, Thou hast made us drunk with the wine of stupefaction.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxv-p7"></span>**4** Thou hast given to those who fear

Judah, my lawgiver.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxv-p11"></span>**8** Moab *shall be* the pot for my
washing; Over Edom will I cast my shoe; O Palestina! triumph thou over
me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxv-p12"></span>**9** Who will bring me into the city
fortified? Who will lead me into Edom?

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxv-p13"></span>**10** Wilt not thou, O God! who hadst
cast us off? \[*thou*\] O God! \[*who*\] didst not go forth with our
armies?

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxv-p14"></span>**11** Grant us relief from trouble,
For vain *is* the help of man.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxv-p15"></span>**12** Through God we shall do
valiantly: And he it is who shall tread down our adversaries.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvi-p4"></span>**1** Hear, O God! my cry, Attend to
my prayer.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvi-p5"></span>**2** From the end of the earth to
thee will I cry, when vexed is my heart: To the rock which is higher
than I thou shalt lead me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvi-p6"></span>**3** For thou hast been a hope to me,
A tower of strength from the face of the enemy.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvi-p7"></span>**4** I will dwell in thy tabernacle
for ever; I will be safe under the covert of thy wings. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvi-p8"></span>**5** For thou, O God! hast heard my
vows: Thou hast given an inheritance to those who fear thy name.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvi-p9"></span>**6** Days upon days to the king thou
shalt add, His years *shall be* as many generations.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvi-p10"></span>**7** He shall dwell for ever in the
presence of God: Mercy and truth do thou prepare: thou shalt preserve
him.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvi-p11"></span>**8** So will I sing unto thy name
for ever, That I may perform my vows every day.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician upon Jeduthun.
A Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p4"></span>**1** Nevertheless towards God silent
is my soul: From him is my salvation.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p5"></span>**2** Nevertheless he is my reek and
my salvation, My fortress: *therefore* I shall not be moved greatly.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p6"></span>**3** How long will ye continue to
lay snares against a man? Ye shall be slain all of you: As an inclining
wall shall ye be, and a fence that is shaken.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p7"></span>**4** Yet from his elevation they
consult to east him down: They delight in falsehood: With their mouth
they bless, And in their hearts they curse. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p8"></span>**5** Nevertheless towards God be
thou silent O my soul: For from him *is* my expectation.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p9"></span>**6** Nevertheless he *only is* my
rock, and my salvation: My fortress; I shall not fall.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p10"></span>**7** In God *is* my salvation and
my glory; The rock of my strength; my hope *is* in God.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p11"></span>**8** Hope in him at all times, O ye
people! Pour out before his face your hearts: God *is* our hope. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p12"></span>**9** Nevertheless vanity are the
sons of Adam; A lie the sons of men: When put all together in a balance
they are found lighter than vanity itself.  <span
id="fr_335"></span>[336](#fn_335)

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p14"></span>**10** Trust not in oppression and
robbery; be not vain: \[*Upon*\] riches if they abound set not your
heart.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p15"></span>**11** Once God hath spoken; Twice
this I have heard, “That power belongeth to God;” And to thee, O Lord!
*belongeth* mercy; Truly thou wilt render to every man according to his
work.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxviii-p3"></span>A Psalm of David, when he was in the
wilderness of Judea

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxviii-p4"></span>**1** O God! my God art thou; Early
will I seek thee: Thirsted for thee hath my soul, Longed for thee hath
my flesh, In this land \[*that is*\] inhospitable and dry, without
water.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxviii-p5"></span>**2** Thus in the sanctuary have I
beheld thee, To see thy power and thy glory.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxviii-p6"></span>**3** Because better *is* thy mercy
than life, My lips shall praise thee.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxviii-p7"></span>**4** Thus will I bless thee in my
life; In thy name I will lift up my hands.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxviii-p8"></span>**5** As with marrow and farness
satisfied shall be my soul, And with lips of rejoicing shall my mouth
praise *thee*

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxviii-p9"></span>**6** Surely I will remember thee
upon my bed; In the watches *of the night* I will meditate upon thee;

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxviii-p10"></span>**7** Because thou hast been a help
to me: And in the shadow of thy wings I will shout for joy.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxviii-p11"></span>**8** Cleaved hath my soul to
\[*literally after*\] thee; Sustain me shall thy right hand.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxviii-p12"></span>**9** And they whilst they seek to
destroy my soul, Shall go into the lowest parts of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxviii-p13"></span>**10** They shall east him down to
the edge of the sword: The portion of foxes they shall be.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxviii-p14"></span>**11** But the king shall rejoice
in God, And glory shall every one who sweareth by him: For stopped shall
be the mouth of those who speak falsehood.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxix-p4"></span>**1** Hear, O God! my voice in my
prayer: From fear of the enemy preserve my life.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxix-p5"></span>**2** Hide me from the counsel of
malignant men — From the assembly of tire workers of iniquity.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxix-p6"></span>**3** For they have sharpened as a
sword their tongue; They have directed for their arrow a bitter word.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxix-p7"></span>**4** To shoot in secret at the
innocent man: Suddenly they will shoot and not fear.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxix-p8"></span>**5** They encourage themselves in an
impious action; They talk together of secretly laying snares; They say,
“Who shall see them?”

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxix-p9"></span>**6** They have searched out
iniquities, They have accomplished a searching search: And the inward
part of each of them and the heart \[*is*\] deep.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxix-p10"></span>**7** But God shall shoot at them an
arrow; Suddenly shall they be wounded.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxix-p11"></span>**8** And they shall make their own
tongue fall upon themselves, And flee away shall all who see them.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxix-p12"></span>**9** And see shall all men, and
shall declare the work of God, And his doing they shall understand.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxix-p13"></span>**10** Rejoice shall the righteous in
Jehovah, and they shall hope in him; And glory shall all the upright in
heart.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p4"></span>**1** For thee waiteth praise, O God!
in Zion; And to thee performed shall be the vow.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p5"></span>**2** O thou who hearest prayer! To
thee shall all flesh come.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p6"></span>**3** Words of iniquity  <span

choose, and cause to approach to thee; He shall dwell in thy courts: We
shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house — Of the sanctuary of
thy palace.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p9"></span>**5** Terrible things in righteousness
wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation! The hope of all the ends of
the earth, And of the far off places of the sea.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p10"></span>**6** Establishing the mountains by
his power,  <span id="fr_337"></span>[338](#fn_337) Being girded with
might.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p12"></span>**7** Stilling the noise of the seas,
And the noise of their waves, the tumults of the nations.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p13"></span>**8** And afraid shall be the dwellers
in the ends *of the earth* at thy signs; The outgoings of the morning
and evening thou shalt make to shout for joy.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p14"></span>**9** Thou hast visited the earth, and
watered her; Thou hast abundantly enriched her: The river of God is full
of waters: Thou wilt prepare their corn, For so thou hast prepared her.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p15"></span>**10** Her furrows thou dost saturate,
Thou makest the rain to fall into her ridges, With showers thou dost
moisten her, Her buddings thou dost bless.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p16"></span>**11** Thou crownest the year with thy
beneficence, And thy paths will drop fatness.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p17"></span>**12** They drop upon the dwellings of
the wilderness; And with gladness the hills shall be girded.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p18"></span>**13** Clothed are the pastures with
flocks; And the valleys are covered with corn; They shout for joy, they
also sing.

thee, and shall sing to thee, “They shall hymn thy name.” Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p8"></span>**5** Come ye, and see the works of
God: He is terrible in his doing towards the sons of men.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p9"></span>**6** He turned the sea into dry
*land*; Through the river  <span id="fr_338"></span>[339](#fn_338) they
passed on foot; There we were glad in him.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p11"></span>**7** He ruleth by his might over the

nations are fixed: The rebels shall not exalt themselves. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p13"></span>**8** Bless, O ye people! our God,
And resound the voice of his praise.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p14"></span>**9** Who hath brought our souls into
life, And hath not suffered our feet to fall.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p15"></span>**10** For thou hast proved us, O
God! Thou hast tried us as silver is tried:

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p16"></span>**11** Thou hast brought us into the
net Thou hast laid restraint upon our loins;

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p17"></span>**12** Thou hast made man to ride
over our heads; We have come into fire and water; And thou hast brought
us into a place of abundance.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p18"></span>**13** I will come into thy house
with burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my vows,

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p19"></span>**14** Which my lips have uttered,
And my mouth hath spoken in my affliction.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p20"></span>**15** Burnt-offerings of fat *lambs*
I will offer to thee with incense of rams; I will bring bullocks with
goats. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p21"></span>**16** Come, hear, and I will tell
all you who fear God, What he hath done for my soul.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p22"></span>**17** To him with my mouth I cried,
And I have exalted him with my tongue.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p23"></span>**18** If I have regarded iniquity in
my heart, The Lord will not hear me.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p24"></span>**19** But truly heard me hath God;
He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p25"></span>**20** Blessed be God who hath not
turned away my prayer, Nor his mercy from me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ii-p4"></span>**1** Arise shall God: scattered shall
be his enemies; And flee from before his face shall those who hate him.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ii-p5"></span>**2** As smoke is driven away thou
shalt drive them away; As wax melteth before the fire, perish shall the
ungodly from before the face of God.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ii-p6"></span>**3** But the righteous shall rejoice,
They shell exult before God, And leap for joy.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ii-p7"></span>**4** Sing ye unto God, sing psalms to

exult before him.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ii-p8"></span>**5** The father of the orphans, and

<span id="xxxv.iii.ii-p9"></span>**6** God who causeth the solitary to
dwell in a family, Who bringeth forth those who are bound with chains:
But rebels shall dwell in a dry land.

before thy people, When thou marchedst through the wilderness; Selah:

<span id="xxxv.iii.ii-p11"></span>**8** The earth was moved, Also the
heavens dropped at the presence of this God: Sinai at the presence of
God, the God of Israel.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ii-p12"></span>**9** A liberal rain thou shalt make
to fall, O God! upon thy inheritance, And when it is weary thou
refreshest it.

*in it* will Jehovah for ever.

To thee shall kings bring presents.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ii-p33"></span>**30** Destroy the company of
spearmen, The assembly of bulls, with the calves of the peoples,
Treading with their feet upon pieces of silver: Scatter thou the peoples
that in wars delight.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ii-p34"></span>**31** Princes shall come out of
Egypt; Ethiopia shall speedily stretch forth her hands to God.

Israel; His majesty and his strength \[*are*\] in the clouds.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician upon Shoshannim.
Of David

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p4"></span>**1** Save me, O God! For entered have
the waters even to my soul.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p5"></span>**2** I am sunk into deep mire where
there is no standing place; I am come into the depths of waters, And the
floods of water have overflowed me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p6"></span>**3** I am weary with crying, Hoarse
is my throat become therewith; Failed have my eyes with waiting for my
God.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p7"></span>**4** More in number than the hairs of
my head are those who hate me without cause: Increased are those who
desire to destroy me, \[*even*\] my lying adversaries: That which I took
not by violence, then I restored it.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p8"></span>**5** O God! thou knowest my
foolishness, And my faults from thee are not hidden.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p9"></span>**6** Let not those be ashamed in me
that wait for thee, O Lord, Jehovah of armies! Let not those be put to
shame in me who seek thee, O God of Israel!

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p10"></span>**7** For on thy account I have
suffered reproach; Shame hath covered my face.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p11"></span>**8** A stranger I have been to my
brethren, And an alien I am become to the children of my mother.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p12"></span>**9** For the zeal of thy house hath
eaten me up; And the reproaches of those who reproached thee have fallen
upon me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p13"></span>**10** And I wept, my soul fasted;
And that was for a reproach to me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p14"></span>**11** And I made my garment
sackcloth; And I was to them for a jest.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p15"></span>**12** Defame me do those who sit in
the gate; And *I am* the songs of those who drink intoxicating liquor.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p16"></span>**13** But as for me my prayer
\[*is*\] to thee, O Jehovah! *In the* time of *thy* favor, O God! In the
multitude of thy mercy answer me, In the truth of thy salvation.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p17"></span>**14** Rescue me from the mire that I
may not sink; That I may be delivered from my adversaries, And from the
depths of waters.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p18"></span>**15** Let not the flood of waters
overflow me; And let not the deep swallow me up; And let not the pit
dose its mouth upon me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p19"></span>**16** Answer me, O Jehovah! for good
*is* thy mercy: In the multitude of thy compassions look upon me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p20"></span>**17** And hide not thy face from thy
servant, for I am afflicted: Hasten! answer me!

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p21"></span>**18** Draw near to my soul, redeem
it: On account of my adversaries deliver me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p22"></span>**19** Thou knowest my reproach, and
my confusion, and my ignominy: Before thee *are* all my adversaries.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p23"></span>**20** Reproach hath broken my heart,
and I am afflicted; And I looked for some one to show compassion, but
there was none; For comforters, but I found *them* not.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p24"></span>**21** And they put into my meat
gall, And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p25"></span>**22** Let their table be before them
for a snare; And their prosperity for a net;

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p26"></span>**23** Darkened let be their eyes,
that they may not see; And cause their loins continually to tremble.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p27"></span>**24** Pour out upon them thy wrath;
And let the fury of thy indignation take hold of them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p28"></span>**25** Let their palace be desolate;
In their tents let there not be a dweller.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p29"></span>**26** For him whom thou hast smitten
they have persecuted; And to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded
they have added.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p30"></span>**27** Add iniquity to their
iniquity; And let them not enter into thy righteousness.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p31"></span>**28** Let them be blotted out of the
book of the living; And with the righteous let them not be written.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p32"></span>**29** But as for me I am poor and
sorrowful: Thy salvation shall exalt me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p33"></span>**30** I will praise the name of God
in a song, And I will magnify him with thanksgiving.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p34"></span>**31** And this will please Jehovah
More than a young bullock that hath horns and hoofs.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p35"></span>**32** Seen it have the afflicted,
And they shall rejoice at it who seek God; And live shall your heart.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p36"></span>**33** For hearkened hath Jehovah to
the afflicted; And his prisoners he hath not despised.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p37"></span>**34** Praise him let heaven and
earth; The seas and whatever creepeth in them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p38"></span>**35** For God will save Zion, And
will build the cities of Judah; And they shall dwell there, And possess
it by inheritance.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iii-p39"></span>**36** And the seed of his servants
shall inherit it; And they who love his name shall dwell in it.

call to remembrance

<span id="xxxv.iii.iv-p4"></span>**1** O God! to deliver me, O Jehovah!
to my aid, hasten.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iv-p5"></span>**2** Let those be ashamed and
confounded who seek after my soul; Let those be turned backward and put
to confusion who desire my hurt.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iv-p6"></span>**3** Let those be destroyed for a
reward of their shame, Who say to me, “Aha! Aha!”

<span id="xxxv.iii.iv-p7"></span>**4** Exult and rejoice in thee let all
who seek thee; And let those say, “For ever may God be magnified” —
Those who love thy salvation.

<span id="xxxv.iii.iv-p8"></span>**5** But as for me I am poor and
needy: O God! hasten to me: My help and my deliverer art thou: O
Jehovah! delay not.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p2"></span>PSALM 71

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p3"></span>**1** In thee, O Jehovah! do I put my
trust, Let me not be put to shame for ever.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p4"></span>**2** In thy righteousness deliver me,
and rescue me; Incline to me thy ear, and save me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p5"></span>**3** Be thou to me for a rock of
strength, Into which I may enter at all times: Thou hast given
commandment to save me; For my tower and my fortress art thou.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p6"></span>**4** O my God! deliver me from the hand
of the ungodly man, — From the hand of the wicked and violent men.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p7"></span>**5** For thou art my expectation, O
Lord Jehovah! My trust from my youth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p8"></span>**6** Upon thee have I been sustained
from the womb; Out of my mother’s bowels thou art he who took me: Of
thee is my praise continually.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p9"></span>**7** As a prodigy I have been to the
great ones, And yet thou art my strong confidence.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p10"></span>**8** Filled shall be my mouth with thy
praise, Daily with thy glory.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p11"></span>**9** Cast me not off in the time of my
old age: In the declining of my strength forsake me not.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p12"></span>**10** For my enemies have spoken
concerning me, And those who watch for my soul have consulted together,

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p13"></span>**11** Saying, “God hath forsaken him;
“Follow after him, and ye shall take him; “For there is none to deliver
*him*.”

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p14"></span>**12** O God! be not far from me: O my
God! to my aid hasten.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p15"></span>**13** Let those be put to shame, let
those fail who are the adversaries of my soul: Let those be covered with
reproach mid shame who seek my hurt.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p16"></span>**14** But as for me continually will I
hope, And will add to all thy praise.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p17"></span>**15** My mouth shall tell of thy
righteousness, Daily of thy salvation; For I know not the number
*thereof*

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p18"></span>**16** I will go in the strength of the
Lord Jehovah! I will remember thy righteousness alone.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p19"></span>**17** O God! thou hast taught me from
my youth; And unto this time will I announce thy wonders.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p20"></span>**18** And therefore  <span
id="fr_340"></span>[341](#fn_340) in old age and gray hairs, O God!
forsake me not, Until I have declared thy strength to the generation, To
all who are to come thy might.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p22"></span>**19** And thy righteousness, O God! is
very high: For thou hast done great things: O God! who is like to thee?

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p23"></span>**20** Thou hast made me to see
troubles many and grievous, *But* being turned thou wilt quicken me, And
from the depths of the earth, being turned thou wilt raise me up.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p24"></span>**21** Thou wilt multiply my greatness;
And being turned thou wilt comfort me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p25"></span>**22** Moreover, I, even I, will sing
to thee on instruments of music;  <span
id="fr_341"></span>[342](#fn_341) For thy truth, O my God! I will sing
psalms to thee upon the harp, O Holy One of Israel!

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p27"></span>**23** Exult shall my lips, when I sing
psalms to thee; And my soul which thou hast redeemed.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p28"></span>**24** Also my tongue daily shall
declare thy righteousness; For they are put to shame, for they are
disgraced, who seek my hurt.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p3"></span>Of Solomon

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p4"></span>**1** O God! thy judgments give to the
King, And thy righteousness to the son of the King

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p5"></span>**2** He shall judge thy people in
righteousness, And thy poor ones in judgment.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p6"></span>**3** Bring forth shall the mountains
peace to the people, And the hills in righteousness.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p7"></span>**4** He shall judge the poor ones of
the people; He shall save the children of the afflicted; And shall break
in pieces the calumniator.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p8"></span>**5** They shall fear thee with the
sun; And before the moon the generation of generations shall fear thee.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p9"></span>**6** He shall descend as rain upon the
mown grass; As the showers which water the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p10"></span>**7** Flourish in his days shall the
righteous; And abundance of peace until there be no more moon.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p11"></span>**8** And he shall have dominion from
sea to sea, And from the river even to the ends of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p12"></span>**9** Before him shall bow the
inhabitants of the desert, And his enemies shall lick the dust.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p13"></span>**10** The kings of Tarshish and of
the isles a present shall bring: The kings of Sheba and Seba a gift
shall offer *to him*

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p14"></span>**11** And all kings shall prostrate
themselves before him; All nations shall serve him.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p15"></span>**12** For he shall deliver the poor
who crieth *to him*, And the needy who hath no helper.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p16"></span>**13** He will have compassion upon
the indigent and the poor one, And the souls of the poor ones he will
save.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p17"></span>**14** From fraud and violence he will
redeem their souls, And precious shall be their blood in his eyes.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p18"></span>**15** And he shall live, and there
shall be given to him of the gold of Sheba, And prayer shall be made for
him continually; Daily shall he be blessed.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p19"></span>**16** There shall be *sown* an
handful of corn in the earth on the top of the mountains; The fruit
thereof shall be shaken like \[*that*\] of Lebanon. And they shall go
forth from the city as a plant of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p20"></span>**17** His name shall be for ever; In
presence of the sun propagated shall be his name: And bless themselves
in him shall all nations, And blessed they shall call him.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p21"></span>**18** Blessed be Jehovah God! the God
of Israel!  <span id="fr_342"></span>[343](#fn_342) Who doeth wonderful
things alone.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p23"></span>**19** And blessed be his glorious

Amen.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p4"></span>PSALM 73

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p5"></span>A Psalm of Asaph

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p6"></span>**1** Yet God is good to Israel, To
those who are right in heart.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p7"></span>**2** As for me, wellnigh slipped had
my feet, My steps were almost gone:

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p8"></span>**3** For I was envious at the
foolish, On seeing the prosperity of the ungodly.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p9"></span>**4** For there are no bands to their
death, And vigorous is their strength.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p10"></span>**5** In the \[*common*\] trouble of
man they are not; And with other men they are not scourged.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p11"></span>**6** Therefore encompass them as a
chain doth pride; Covered them hath the raiment of violence.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p12"></span>**7** Their eye projecteth through
fatness; They have passed beyond the thoughts of their heart.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p13"></span>**8** They break forth, and talk
wickedly of extortion: From on high do they speak.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p14"></span>**9** They have set against the
heaven their mouth, And their tongue walketh through the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p15"></span>**10** On this account his people
will return hither, And waters of a full cup will be wrung out to them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p16"></span>**11** And they say, “How doth God
know? “ “And is there knowledge in the Most High?“

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p17"></span>**12** Behold these are the ungodly,
and \[*yet*\]. they are in quiet for ever: They heap up riches.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p18"></span>**13** Surely in vain I have purified
my heart, And washed every day my hands:

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p19"></span>**14** And I have been scourged every
day, And my chastisement \[*has been*\] every morning.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p20"></span>**15** If I have said, “I will speak
thus,” Behold! the generation of thy children: I have transgressed.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p21"></span>**16** And although I applied my mind
to know this, A pain fill thing it was in mine eyes,

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p22"></span>**17** Until I entered into the
sanctuaries of God, *And* understood their end.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p23"></span>**18** Surely in slippery places thou
hast set them; Thou shalt east them down into destructions.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p24"></span>**19** How have they been destroyed
as in a moment! They have perished, they have been consumed with
terrors.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p25"></span>**20** As it were a dream after a man
is awakened; O Lord! in awaking, their image thou wilt render
contemptible.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p26"></span>**21** For in a ferment was my heart,
And in my reins I was pierced.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p27"></span>**22** And I myself \[*was*\] foolish
and knew not *any thing*; As the beasts have I been before thee.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p28"></span>**23** Nevertheless *I have been*
continually with thee; Thou hast held my right hand.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p29"></span>**24** With thy counsel thou shalt
guide me; And at length to glory thou shalt take me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p30"></span>**25** Whom have I in heaven *but
thee*? And another with time I have not desired on the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p31"></span>**26** Failed have my flesh and my
heart; *But* the strength of my heart and my portion *is* God for ever.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p32"></span>**27** For lo! those who depart from
thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed every one who goeth a whoring
from thee.

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p33"></span>**28** As for me, to draw near to God
is good for me: I have put in the Lord Jehovah my trust, That I may tell
of all thy works.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p2"></span>PSALM 74

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p3"></span>An Instruction of Asaph

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p4"></span>**1** Wherefore, O God! hast thou
cast us off for ever? \[*Why*\] smoketh thy wrath against the flock of
thy pastures?

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p5"></span>**2** Remember thy congregation which
thou hast possessed of old;  <span id="fr_344"></span>[345](#fn_344)
*Which* thou hast redeemed, the rod of thy inheritance, This Mount Zion
in which thou hast dwelt.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p7"></span>**3** Lift up thy strokes to
desolations perpetual, Against every enemy who doeth mischief to the
sanctuary.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p8"></span>**4** Roared *like lions* have thy
adversaries in the midst of thy sanctuaries; They have set up their
signs *for* signs.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p9"></span>**5** He was renowned as doing an
excellent work Who lifted up the axes upon the thick trees.  <span
id="fr_345"></span>[346](#fn_345)

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p11"></span>**6** And now the carved works
thereof together, With the hatchet and with hammers they break in
pieces.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p12"></span>**7** They have set on fire thy
sanctuaries; Leveling it with the ground, they have polluted the
dwelling-place of thy name.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p13"></span>**8** They have said in their heart,
“Let us destroy them altogether.” They have burned all the tabernacles
of God in the land.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p14"></span>**9** Our signs we see not; There is
no longer a prophet, Nor is there with us one who knoweth how long! —

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p15"></span>**10** How long, O God! shall the
adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p16"></span>**11** How long wilt thou withdraw
thy hand, and thy right hand? In the midst, of thy bosom consume them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p17"></span>**12** But God *is* my king from the
beginning, Working salvations in the midst of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p18"></span>**13** Thou didst divide  <span
id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346) by thy power the sea; Thou didst break
the heads of dragons in the waters.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p20"></span>**14** Thou didst break the head of
the leviathan; Thou gavest him *for* food to *thy* people in the
wilderness.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p21"></span>**15** Thou didst cleave the
fountain and the torrent: Thou didst dry up mighty rivers.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p22"></span>**16** Thine is the day; thine also
is the night: Thou hast ordained the light and the sun.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p23"></span>**17** Thou hast fixed all the
boundaries of the earth: The summer and the winter thou hast made.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p24"></span>**18** Remember this: the enemy hath
reproached Jehovah; And a worthless people hath done despite to thy
name.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p25"></span>**19** Give not to the beast the
soul of thy turtle dove: The congregation of thy poor ones forget not
for ever.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p26"></span>**20** Have regard to *thy*
covenant; For filled are the dark places of the earth with the abodes of
violence.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p27"></span>**21** Let not the afflicted one
return ashamed; Let the poor and needy one praise thy name.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p28"></span>**22** Arise, O God! plead thy own
cause: Remember thy reproach, *which is done thee* by the foolish man
daily.

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p29"></span>**23** Forget not the voice of thy
adversaries: The tumult of those who rise up against thee ascendeth
continually.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ix-p4"></span>**1** We will celebrate thee, O God! we
will celebrate *thee*; And near is thy name: they will declare thy
wonders.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ix-p5"></span>**2** When I shall have taken the
congregation, I in uprightness will judge.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ix-p6"></span>**3** Dissolved is the earth, and all
the inhabitants thereof: will establish the pillars of it. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ix-p7"></span>**4** I said to the fools, “Act not
foolishly;” And to the ungodly, “Raise not up the horn.”

<span id="xxxv.iii.ix-p8"></span>**5** Raise not up on high your horn;
And speak not with a stiff neck.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ix-p9"></span>**6** For neither from the east, nor
from the west, Nor from the wilderness are exaltations.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ix-p10"></span>**7** For God is judge: tie bringeth
low, and he setteth up.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ix-p11"></span>**8** For a cup *is* in the hand of
Jehovah, and the wine is turbid; It is full of mixture, and he shall
pour forth of it. Surely the dregs thereof they shall wring out;. And
drink *of it* shall all the wicked of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ix-p12"></span>**9** But as for me I will publish for
ever, I will sing psalms to the God of Jacob.

<span id="xxxv.iii.ix-p13"></span>**10** And all the horns of the
ungodly I will break; But exalted shall be the horns of the righteous.

<span id="xxxv.iii.x-p4"></span>**1** Known in Judah is God; In Israel
great is his name.

<span id="xxxv.iii.x-p5"></span>**2** And in Salem was his tabernacle,
And his dwelling-place in Zion.

<span id="xxxv.iii.x-p6"></span>**3** There he broke the arrows of the
bow, The shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.x-p7"></span>**4** More glorious, more terrible *art*
thou Than the mountains of prey.

<span id="xxxv.iii.x-p8"></span>**5** Spoiled were the stout in heart,
They slept their sleep: And none of the men of might have found their
hands.

<span id="xxxv.iii.x-p9"></span>**6** At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob!
Cast into a deep sleep were the chariot and the horse.

<span id="xxxv.iii.x-p10"></span>**7** Thou *art* terrible \[*even*\]
thou; And who shall stand before thy face when thou art angry?

<span id="xxxv.iii.x-p11"></span>**8** From the heavens thou hast made
judgment to be heard: The earth was afraid and was still,

<span id="xxxv.iii.x-p12"></span>**9** When God arose to judgment, To
save all the meek of the earth. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.x-p13"></span>**10** Surely the wrath of men shall
praise thee, The remainder of wrath thou wilt restrain.

<span id="xxxv.iii.x-p14"></span>**11** Vow and pay to Jehovah your God:
Let all who are round about him bring a present to the terrible one.

<span id="xxxv.iii.x-p15"></span>**12** He will cut off the spirit of
princes: *He* *is* terrible to the kings of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician upon Jeduthun. A
Psalm of Asaph

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p4"></span>**1** My voice \[*I lifted up*\] to
God, and I cried; My voice \[*I lifted up*\] to God, and he heard me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p5"></span>**2** In the day of my affliction the
Lord I sought: My hand in the night was stretched out and relaxed not;
Refuse consolation did my soul.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p6"></span>**3** I will remember God, and will be
disquieted; I will meditate, and oppressed with sorrow shall be my
spirit. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p7"></span>**4** Thou hast held the watches of my
eyes: I am troubled, and will not speak.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p8"></span>**5** I have recounted the days of old,
The years of ages past.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p9"></span>**6** I will call to remembrance my
song in the night: With my heart I will meditate, And search diligently
shall my spirit.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p10"></span>**7** For ever will the Lord east off?
And will he be favorable no more?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p11"></span>**8** Gone for ever is his mercy? Fail
doth his oracle from generation to generation?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p12"></span>**9** Forgotten to be merciful hath
God? Hath he shut up in anger his compassions? Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p13"></span>**10** And I said my disease \[*is
only for a season*;\] The years of the right hand of the Most High \[*I
will wait for*.\]

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p14"></span>**11** I will remember the works of
God; Surely I will remember thy wonders from the beginning.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p15"></span>**12** And I will meditate on all thy
works, And on thy doings I will muse.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p16"></span>**13** O God! in the sanctuary *are*
thy ways: What god *is* so great as God?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p17"></span>**14** Thou art the God who doest
wonders; Thou hast made known among the peoples thy strength.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p18"></span>**15** Thou hast redeemed by \[*thy*\]
arm thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p19"></span>**16** See thee did the waters, O God!
see thee did the waters; They were afraid; also tremble did the deeps.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p20"></span>**17** The clouds poured out waters;
The heavens gave forth a voice: Also thine arrows went abroad.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p21"></span>**18** The voice of thy thunder was in
the circuit, The lightnings illumined the world; The earth trembled and
was shaken.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p22"></span>**19** In the sea are thy ways, And
thy paths in the great waters; And thy footsteps are not known.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xi-p23"></span>**20** Thou leadest like sheep thy
people By the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p4"></span>**1** Give ear, O my people! to my
law: Incline your ears to the words of my month.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p5"></span>**2** I will open in a parable my
mouth; I will utter enigmas from ancient Sae.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p6"></span>**3** What we have heard and known,
And our’ fathers have related to us,

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p7"></span>**4** We will not conceal from their
children to the generation to come, Recounting the praises of Jehovah
and his might, And the wonders which he hath done.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p8"></span>**5** And he established a testimony
in, Jacob, And a law he appointed in Israel; For lie commanded our
fathers To make them known to their children;

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p9"></span>**6** That the generations to come
might know them, *That* the children to be born might arise, And declare
*them* to their children.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p10"></span>**7** That they might set in God
their hope, And not forget the works of God; But that his commandments
they might observe,

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p11"></span>**8** And not be as their fathers, A
generation rebellious and provoking; A generation which set not their
heart might, And whose spirit was not faithful towards God.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p12"></span>**9** The children of Ephraim, armed
\[*and*\] shooting with the bow, Were turned back in the day of battle.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p13"></span>**10** They kept not the covenant of
God, And in his law they refused to walk.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p14"></span>**11** And they forget his works, And
the wonders which he had shown them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p15"></span>**12** In the sight of their fathers
he wrought marvelously; In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p16"></span>**13** He divided the sea, and caused
them to pass through, And made the waters to stand as an heap.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p17"></span>**14** And he led them by a cloud in
the day; And all the night by the light of fire.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p18"></span>**15** He clave the rocks in the
wilderness, And made them to drink in great deeps.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p19"></span>**16** And he brought forth streams
from the rock, And made the waters to descend like rivers.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p20"></span>**17** Yet they continued still to
sin against him, To provoke the Most High in the wilderness.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p21"></span>**18** And they tempted God in their
heart, By asking food for their soul.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p22"></span>**19** And they spake against God:
They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?”

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p23"></span>**20** Behold! he smote the reek, and
gush out did the waters; And rivers overflowed. “Can he give bread also?
“Will he prepare flesh for his people?”

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p24"></span>**21** Therefore Jehovah heard and
was wroth: And a fire was kindled in Jacob: And wrath also ascended
against Israel;

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p25"></span>**22** Because they believed not in
God, And trusted not in his salvation.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p26"></span>**23** But he had commanded the
clouds from above, And the doors of heaven he had opened,

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p27"></span>**24** And had rained down upon them
manna for food, And the corn of heaven he had given them:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p28"></span>**25** The bread of the mighty ones
man had eaten: Meat he had sent them to the full.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p29"></span>**26** He caused to blow an east wind
in the heavens; And he raised up by his power the south wind.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p30"></span>**27** And he rained upon them flesh
as dust, And as the sand of the sea leathered fowl;

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p31"></span>**28** And he caused *it* to fall in
the midst of his camp, Round about his tabernacles.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p32"></span>**29** And they did eat and were
filled exceedingly, And their desire he brought to them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p33"></span>**30** They were not estranged from
their desire: The meat was still in their mouth,

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p34"></span>**31** When the wrath of God ascended
against them, And slew their fat ones, And brought low the chosen of
Israel.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p35"></span>**32** In all these *things* they
sinned still, And believed not his wonders.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p36"></span>**33** And he consumed in vanity
their days, And their years in haste.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p37"></span>**34** When he slew them, they sought
him; They returned, and hastened early to God.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p38"></span>**35** And they remembered that God
was their Rock, And *that* the Most High God was their Redeemer.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p39"></span>**36** And they flattered \[*him*\]
with their mouth, And with their tongue they lied to him:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p40"></span>**37** But their heart was not right
before him, And they were not faithful in his covenant.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p41"></span>**38** Yet he *who* *is*
compassionate expiated their iniquity, And did not destroy them: And he
multiplied to turn away his anger, And did not stir up all his
indignation.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p42"></span>**39** And he remembered that they
were flesh; A breath that passeth, and returneth not.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p43"></span>**40** How often did they provoke him
in the desert, \[*And*\] grieve him in the wilderness!

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p44"></span>**41** And they returned and tempted
God, And the Holy One of Israel they limited.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p45"></span>**42** They remembered not his hand
In the day that he redeemed them from the oppressor,

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p46"></span>**43** When he set in Egypt his
signs, And his miracles in the field of Zoan.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p47"></span>**44** When he turned into blood
their rivers; And their streams, that they might not drink of them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p48"></span>**45** He sent among them a mixture
which devoured them; And the frog which destroyed them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p49"></span>**46** And he gave to the caterpillar
their fruit; And their labors to the locusts.  <span
id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347)

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p51"></span>**47** And he destroyed with hail
their vine, And their wild fig-trees with hailstones.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p52"></span>**48** And he gave lip to the hail
their cattle, And their flocks to thunderbolts.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p53"></span>**49** He sent upon them the
fierceness of his wrath, Fury, anger, and affliction, A mission of evil
angels.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p54"></span>**50** He made a path for his anger:
He kept not from death their soul, And their cattle to the pestilence he
shut up.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p55"></span>**51** And he smote all the firstborn
in Egypt: The beginning of \[*their*\] strength in the tents of Ham.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p56"></span>**52** And he made to go forth like
sheep his people, And led them like a flock in the wilderness.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p57"></span>**53** And he conducted *them* in
safety, and they were not afraid: And their enemies cover did the sea.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p58"></span>**54** And he brought them to the
border of his holiness, This mountain, *which* his right hand acquired.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p59"></span>**55** And he expelled from before
their face the heathen; And made them to fall into the lot of all
inheritance; And caused to dwell in their tents the children of Israel.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p60"></span>**56** But they tempted and provoked
God Most High, And his testimonies they kept not.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p61"></span>**57** And they turned back and dealt
perfidiously like their fathers: They started aside like a bow that is
deceitful.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p62"></span>**58** And they provoked him to anger
with their high places; And with their graven images they moved him to
anger.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p63"></span>**59** Hear it did God, and was
wroth, And he abhorred exceedingly Israel.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p64"></span>**60** And he forsook the habitation
of Shiloh, The tabernacle where he dwelt among men.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p65"></span>**61** And he gave into captivity his
strength, And his beauty into the hand of the enemy.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p66"></span>**62** And he shut up to the sword
his people, And with his own inheritance was wroth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p67"></span>**63** Their chosen devour did the
fire, And their virgins were not applauded.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p68"></span>**64** Their priests by the sword did
fall; And their widows made no lamentation.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p69"></span>**65** But the Lord awoke as one
asleep, As a mighty man who crieth out by reason of wine.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p70"></span>**66** And he smote his enemies
behind; Everlasting disgrace he put upon them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p71"></span>**67** And he rejected the tabernacle
of Joseph, And the tribe of Ephraim he chose not:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p72"></span>**68** But he chose the tribe of
Judah, The mountain of Zion, which lie loved:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p73"></span>**69** And built like high places his
sanctuary, Like the earth which he hath founded for ever.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p74"></span>**70** And he chose David his
servant, And took him from the folds of sheep:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p75"></span>**71** From following the suckling
ewes he took him, To feed Jacob his people, And Israel his inheritance:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p76"></span>**72** And he fed them in the
integrity of his heart, And by the prudence of his hands he guided
there.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p2"></span>PSALM 79

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p3"></span>A Psalm of Asaph

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p4"></span>**1** O God! come have the heathen
into thy inheritance; They have polluted the temple of thy holiness;
They have laid Jerusalem in heaps. \[fowls of the heavens;

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p5"></span>**2** They have given the dead bodies
of thy servants for food to the fowls of the heavens; The flesh of thy
meek ones to the beasts of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p6"></span>**3** They have shed their blood like
water around Jerusalem: And there was not *one* to bury *them*

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p7"></span>**4** We have been a reproach to our
neighbors; A scorn and a derision to those who are around us.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p8"></span>**5** How long, O Jehovah! wilt thou
be wroth for ever? Burn like fire shall thy jealousy?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p9"></span>**6** Pour out thy wrath upon the
heathen who have not known thee, And upon the kingdoms which upon thy
name do not call:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p10"></span>**7** For they have devoured Jacob,
And his dwelling they have laid waste.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p11"></span>**8** Remember not against us former
iniquities: Make haste, let thy compassions prevent us; For we are
afflicted exceedingly.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p12"></span>**9** Help us, O God of our
salvation! for the glory of thy name; And deliver us, and be merciful to
our sins, for the sake of thy name.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p13"></span>**10** Wherefore should the heathen
say, “Where is their God?” Let be made known among the heathen in our
sight The vengeance of the blood of thy servants which is shed.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p14"></span>**11** Let the sighing of the
prisoner come before thy face: According to the greatness of thy arm,
Reserve the children of death:  <span id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348)

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p16"></span>**12** And recompense our neighbors
sevenfold into their bosom, Their reproach with which they have
reproached thee, O Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p17"></span>**13** And we thy people, and the
sheep of thy pastures, Will confess to thee for ever; From generation to
generation declaring thy praise.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p2"></span>PSALM 80

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician upon Shoshannim
Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p4"></span>**1** O Shepherd of Israel, give ear!
Who leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou who sittest between the cherubim,
shine forth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p5"></span>**2** Before Ephraim, and Benjamin,
and Manasseh, Stir up thy strength, and come for our salvation.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p6"></span>**3** Turn us again, O God! and cause
to shine thy face, And we shall be safe.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p7"></span>**4** O Jehovah God of armies! How
long wilt thou be incensed against the prayer of thy people?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p8"></span>**5** Thou hast fed us with bread of
tears; And hast given us tears to drink in great measure.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p9"></span>**6** Thou hast made us a strife to
our neighbors: And our enemies laugh *at us* among themselves.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p10"></span>**7** O God of armies! turn us again,
And cause to shine thy face upon us, And we shall be safe.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p11"></span>**8** A vine out of Egypt thou hast
brought: Thou hast expelled the heathen, and planted it,.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p12"></span>**9** Thou hast cleansed *the ground*
before it: Thou hast rooted its roots, And it hath filled the land.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p13"></span>**10** Covered were the mountains
with its shadow, And its branches *were like* the cedars of God.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p14"></span>**11** It sent forth its branches to
the sea, And to the river its shoots.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p15"></span>**12** Why then hast thou broken down
its hedges, So that tear it in pieces do all who pass by the way?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p16"></span>**13** Wasted it hath the boar out of
the forest; And the wild beast of the field hath eaten it up.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p17"></span>**14** O God of armies! return, I
beseech *thee*, Look down from heaven, and behold, And visit this vine,

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p18"></span>**15** And the vineyard which planted
hath thy right hand, And \[*look*\] upon the shoot  <span
id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349) *which* thou hast strengthened for
thyself.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p20"></span>**16** It is burnt with fire; it is
cut down; At the rebuke of thy countenance they perish.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p21"></span>**17** Let thy hand be upon the Man
of thy right hand, Upon the son of man whom thou hast strengthened for
thyself,

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p22"></span>**18** And we will not go back from
thee: Thou shalt quicken us, and upon thy name we will call.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p23"></span>**19** O Jehovah, God of armies! turn
us again; Cause to shine thy face, And we shall be safe.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p2"></span>PSALM 81

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician upon Gittith. Of
Asaph

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p4"></span>**1** Exult to God our strength: Shout
for joy to the God of Jacob.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p5"></span>**2** Take a song, and bring forth the
timbrel, The harp of pleasantness with the nablum.  <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350)

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p7"></span>**3** Sound the trumpet  <span
id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351) at the new moon; At the time appointed
on the day of our sacrifice.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p9"></span>**4** For a statute to Israel *is*
this, A judgment to the God of Jacob.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p10"></span>**5** For a testimony in Joseph he set
it, When he went forth over the land of Egypt! A language which I
understood not I heard.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p11"></span>**6** “I removed from the burden his
shoulder: “His hands from the pots were removed.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p12"></span>**7** “In trouble thou didst cry, and
I rescued thee: “I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: “I
proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p13"></span>**8** “Hear, O my people! and I will
protest to thee: “O Israel! if thou wilt hearken to me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p14"></span>**9** “Let there not be in thee a
strange god: “Neither worship thou a foreign god.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p15"></span>**10** “I *am* Jehovah thy God, “Who
brought thee out of the land of Egypt: “Open wide thy mouth, and I will
fill it.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p16"></span>**11** “But my people hearkened not to
my voice, “And Israel would have none of me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p17"></span>**12** “And I gave them up to the
hardness of their heart: “They shall walk in their own counsels.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p18"></span>**13** “O if my people had hearkened
to me! “*If* Israel in my ways had walked!

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p19"></span>**14** “Soon their enemies I would
have brought low, “And against their adversaries I would have turned my
hand:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p20"></span>**15** “The haters of Jehovah would
have lied to him, “And their time should have been for ever:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p21"></span>**16** “And I would have fed them with
the fat of corn: “And from the rock with honey I would have satisfied
thee.”

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvi-p3"></span>A Psalm of Asaph

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvi-p4"></span>**1** God sitteth in the assembly of
God: In the midst of the gods he will judge.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvi-p5"></span>**2** How long will ye judge unjustly?
And the faces of the ungodly will ye lift up? Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvi-p6"></span>**3** Judge the poor and the orphan;
The helpless and the destitute justify ye.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvi-p7"></span>**4** Rescue the poor one and the
afflicted one: From the hand of the ungodly ones deliver *them*

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvi-p8"></span>**5** *But* they know not, neither do
they understand *any thing*: In darkness they walk, *Although* moved are
all the foundations of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvi-p9"></span>**6** As for me, I have said, “Ye are
gods, “And children of the Most High all of you:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvi-p10"></span>**7** “Surely as a man ye shall die;
“And as one \[*of the people*,\] O princes! ye shall fall.”

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvi-p11"></span>**8** Arise, O God! judge the earth:
For thou shalt inherit all nations.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p3"></span>A Song \[or\] Psalm, of Asaph

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p4"></span>**1** O God! keep not silence with
thyself; Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God!

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p5"></span>**2** For behold! thy enemies make a
tumult: And those who hate thee have lifted up the head.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p6"></span>**3** Against thy people they have
craftily formed a design, And have consulted against thy hidden ones.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p7"></span>**4** They have said, “Come and let
us cut them off from being a nation; “And let there be no remembrance of
the name of Israel any more.”

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p8"></span>**5** For they have consulted with
the heart together; Against thee a covenant they have made.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p9"></span>**6** The tents of Edom, and of the
Ishmaelites; Of Moab and of the Hagarenes.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p10"></span>**7** Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek;
The Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p11"></span>**8** Also Assur is associated with
them: They have been an arm to the sons of Lot. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p12"></span>**9** Do to them as to the
Midianites, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook Kishon.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p13"></span>**10** They perished at Endor; They
became manure for the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p14"></span>**11** Make them, \[*even*\] their
princes, like Oreb, and like Zeeb; And like Zebah, and like Zalmunna,
all their princes.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p15"></span>**12** Who have said, “Let us take
in possession for ourselves “The habitations of God.”

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p16"></span>**13** O my God! make them like a
whirling ball; Like stubble before the wind.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p17"></span>**14** As fire burneth a forest, And
as the flame kindleth the mountains,

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p18"></span>**15** So pursue them with thy
tempest, And with thy whirlwind terrify them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p19"></span>**16** Fill their faces with shame;
That they may seek thy name, O Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p20"></span>**17** Let them be ashamed, and
terrified for ever;  <span id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352) And let
them be confounded, and perish.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p22"></span>**18** And let them know that thou,
even thou, art, thy name Jehovah, Thou alone the Most High over all the
earth.

A Psalm of the sons of Korah

<span id="xxxv.iii.xviii-p4"></span>**1** How amiable are thy
tabernacles, O Jehovah of armies!

<span id="xxxv.iii.xviii-p5"></span>**2** Long, yea, even faint doth my
soul after the courts of Jehovah: My heart and my flesh leap for joy
towards the living God.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xviii-p6"></span>**3** Also the sparrow hath found a
house for herself, And the swallow a nest for herself, Where she may
place her young ones: O thine altars! thou Jehovah of armies! my King
and my God!

<span id="xxxv.iii.xviii-p7"></span>**4** Blessed *are* those who dwell
in thy house: Continually they will be praising thee. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xviii-p8"></span>**5** Blessed *is* the man whose
strength is in thee; The ways \[*are*\] in their heart.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xviii-p9"></span>**6** They passing through the
valley of weeping, will together make it a fountain; Also the cisterns
the rain will cover.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xviii-p10"></span>**7** They will journey from
strength to strength; Seen will be the God of gods in Zion.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xviii-p11"></span>**8** O Jehovah, God of armies!
hear my prayer: Hearken, O God of Jacob! Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xviii-p12"></span>**9** Our shield do thou behold, O
God! And look upon the face of thy Christ.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xviii-p13"></span>**10** For better is one day in thy
courts than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the
house of my God, Than dwell in the tents of ungodliness.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xviii-p14"></span>**11** For a sun and shield *is*
Jehovah God *to us*; Grace and glory give will Jehovah; He will not
withhold *any* good from those who walk uprightly.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xviii-p15"></span>**12** O Jehovah of armies! Blessed
*is* the man who confideth in thee.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the
sons of Korah

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p4"></span>**1** Thou hast been favorable, O
Jehovah! to thy land: Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p5"></span>**2** Thou hast taken away the
iniquity of thy people: Thou hast covered all their sins. Selah

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p6"></span>**3** Thou hast turned away all thy
anger: Thou hast drawn back the fury of thy indignation.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p7"></span>**4** Turn us, O God of our salvation!
And relax thy anger against us.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p8"></span>**5** Wilt thou for ever be angry with
us? Wilt thou prolong thy wrath from age to age?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p9"></span>**6** Wilt not thou being turned *to
us* quicken us? And thy people will rejoice in thee.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p10"></span>**7** Show us, O Jehovah! thy mercy;
and thy salvation grant unto us.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p11"></span>**8** I will hear what God Jehovah
will speak: Surely he will speak peace to his people and to his meek
ones, And they will not return to folly.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p12"></span>**9** Surely near to those who fear
him is his salvation, That dwell may glory in our land.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p13"></span>**10** Mercy and truth shall meet
together; Righteousness and peace shall kiss \[*each other*.\]

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p14"></span>**11** Truth out of the earth shall
spring up; And righteousness from heaven shall look down.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p15"></span>**12** Likewise Jehovah will give
that which is good: And our land shall yield her increase.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xix-p16"></span>**13** Righteousness before him shall
go; And shall set in the way her steps.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p2"></span>PSALM 86

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p3"></span>A Prayer of David

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p4"></span>**1** Incline, O Jehovah, thy ear,
answer me; For poor and needy *am* I.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p5"></span>**2** Keep my soul, for I am meek: O
thou, my God! save thy servant who trusteth in thee.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p6"></span>**3** Have compassion upon me, O
Jehovah! For to thee do I cry daily.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p7"></span>**4** Gladden the soul of thy servant;
For to thee, O Lord! my soul I lift up.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p8"></span>**5** For thou, O Lord! *art* good, and
gracious, Plenteous in mercy to all who call upon thee.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p9"></span>**6** Listen, O Jehovah! to my prayer,
Attend to the voice of my supplications.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p10"></span>**7** In the day of my trouble I will
cry to thee: For thou wilt answer me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p11"></span>**8** There is none like unto thee, O
Lord! among the gods; And *there* is none \[*who can work*\] according
to thy works.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p12"></span>**9** All the nations which thou hast
made shall come, And shall worship before thy face, O Lord! And glory
they shall give to thy name:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p13"></span>**10** For great art thou, And doing
wonders, thou God alone.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p14"></span>**11** Show me, O Jehovah! thy ways; I
will walk in thy truth: Unite my heart to fear thy name.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p15"></span>**12** I will celebrate thee, O Lord
my God! with my whole heart; And I will glorify thy name for ever;

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p16"></span>**13** For thy mercy hath been great
towards me; And thou hast delivered my soul from the lower grave.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p17"></span>**14** O God! the proud have risen up
against me, And a company of mighty men have sought after my soul; And
they have not set thee before them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p18"></span>**15** And thou, O Lord! \[*art*\] a
God compassionate and gracious; Slow to anger; and plenteous in mercy
and truth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p19"></span>**16** Look to me, and have pity upon
me: Give thy strength to thy servant, And save the son of thy handmaid.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xx-p20"></span>**17** Make with me a sign for good:
And see shall my adversaries and be ashamed; For thou, O Jehovah! hast
secured me and comforted me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxi-p5"></span>**2** Love doth Jehovah the gates of
Zion More than all the tabernacles of Jacob.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxi-p6"></span>**3** Glorious things are spoken of
thee, O city of God! Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxi-p7"></span>**4** I will make mention of Rahab,
and Babel among those who know me: Behold the Philistines, and Tyre,
with Ethiopia, He is born there! Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxi-p8"></span>**5** And of Zion it shall be said,
“Man and man is born in her; “And the Most High himself will establish
her.”

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxi-p9"></span>**6** The Lord will recount when he
writeth the peoples, “He is born there.” Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxi-p10"></span>**7** And the singers as the players
upon instruments: All my springs *are* in thee.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p3"></span>A Song of a Psalm of the sons of
Korah. To the Chief Musician, upon Machalath, to make humble. An
instruction of Heman the Ezrahite

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p4"></span>**1** O Jehovah! God of my salvation!
By day I cry, by night before thee.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p5"></span>**2** Come into thy presence let my
prayer; Incline thy ear to my cry;

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p6"></span>**3** For filled with troubles is my
soul; And my life to hell  <span id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353) hath
drawn near.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p8"></span>**4** I am counted with those who go
down to the sepulcher,  <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354) I have
been as a man who hath no strength:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p10"></span>**5** Free among the dead, As the
slain lying in the grave, Whom thou rememberest no more, And who from
thy hand are cut off.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p11"></span>**6** Thou hast laid me in the
lowest pit, In thick darkness, in the deeps.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p12"></span>**7** Upon me lieth heavy thy
indignation; And with all thy waves thou hast afflicted me. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p13"></span>**8** Thou hast removed my
acquaintances from me: Thou hast made me abominations to them: I am shut
up that I cannot go forth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p14"></span>**9** My eye mourneth because of my
affliction; I invoke thee, O Jehovah! daily: I stretch out to thee my
hands.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p15"></span>**10** Wilt thou for the dead do a
miracle? Shall the dead rising up praise thee? Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p16"></span>**11** Shall thy loving-kindness be
declared in the grave? Thy truth in destruction?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p17"></span>**12** Shall thy wonders be known in
darkness? And thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p18"></span>**13** But as for me to thee, O
Jehovah! have I cried, And in the morning my prayer shall prevent thee.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p19"></span>**14** Wherefore, O Jehovah! wilt
thou reject my soul? \[*Wherefore*\] wilt thou hide thy face from me?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p20"></span>**15** Afflicted am I, and ready to
die from my youth; I have suffered thy terrors by doubting.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p21"></span>**16** Passed over me hath thy
fierce wrath: Thy terrors have cut me off.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p22"></span>**17** They have encompassed me as
waters daily; They have surrounded me together.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxii-p23"></span>**18** Thou hast removed from me
lover and companion; And my acquaintances are darkness.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p3"></span>An Instruction of Ethan, the
Ezrahite

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p4"></span>**1** The mercies of Jehovah for
ever will I sing: From generation to generation will I celebrate thy
truth with my mouth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p5"></span>**2** For I have said, For ever
Mercy shall be built up: The heavens thou shalt establish; thy truth
\[*is*\] in them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p6"></span>**3** “I have made a covenant with
my chosen: “I have sworn to David my servant:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p7"></span>**4** “For ever will I establish thy
seed, “And I will build up from age to age thy throne.” Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p8"></span>**5** And celebrate shall the
heavens thy wondrous work, O Jehovah! Also thy truth in the congregation
of the saints.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p9"></span>**6** For who in the clouds can be
compared to Jehovah? Who is like unto Jehovah among the sons of the
gods?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p10"></span>**7** God is terrible exceedingly
in the assembly of the saints, And to be feared above all who are around
him.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p11"></span>**8** O Jehovah, God of armies! who
*is* a strong God like thee? And thy truth is round about thee.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p12"></span>**9** Thou governest the pride of
the sea: When rise up do the waves thereof, thou restrainest them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p13"></span>**10** Thou hast overthrown Egypt
as a wounded mail; With the arm of thy strength thou hast scattered thy
enemies.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p14"></span>**11** Thine are the heavens, thine
also is the earth: The world, and the fullness thereof thou hast formed.
 <span id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355)

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p16"></span>**12** The north and the south thou
hast created: Tabor and Hermon in thy name shall exult.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p17"></span>**13** Thou hast an arm of might:
Thou wilt strengthen thy hand, Thou wilt exalt thy right hand.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p18"></span>**14** Righteousness and judgment
*are* the seat of thy throne: Mercy and truth shall go before thy face.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p19"></span>**15** Blessed is the people that
know the joyful sound! O Jehovah! in the brightness of thy countenance
they shall walk.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p20"></span>**16** In thy name shall they exult
daily; And in thy righteousness shall they glory:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p21"></span>**17** For the glory of their
strength art thou; And in thy favor exalted shall be our horn.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p22"></span>**18** For to Jehovah *is* our
buckler; And to. the Holy One of Israel *is* our King.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p23"></span>**19** Then thou spakest in vision
to thy meek ones, And saidst, “I have laid help upon a Mighty One; “I
have exalted one chosen from among the people.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p24"></span>**20** “I have found David my
servant; “With the oil of my holiness have I anointed him.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p25"></span>**21** “Therefore, my hand shall be
established with him: “Yea, my arm shall strengthen him.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p26"></span>**22** “The enemy shall not exact
upon him, “Nor shall the son of iniquity afflict him.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p27"></span>**23** “And I will break in pieces
before his face his oppressors; “And those who hate him I will smite.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p28"></span>**24** “And my truth and my mercy
*shall be* with him: “And in my name exalted shall be his horn.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p29"></span>**25** “And I will set in the sea
his hand, “And in the rivers his right hand.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p30"></span>**26** “He shall cry to me, ‘My
Father art thou, “‘My God, the Rock of my salvation.’

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p31"></span>**27** “Also I myself my firstborn
will make him, “Higher than the kings of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p32"></span>**28** “And for ever will I keep
for him my mercy, “And my covenant shall stand firm with him.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p33"></span>**29** “And I will establish for
ever his seed, “And his throne as the days of heaven.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p34"></span>**30** “If forsake shall his
children my law, “And in my judgments shall not walk;

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p35"></span>**31** “If my ordinances they shall
profane, “And my statutes they shall not keep;

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p36"></span>**32** “Then will I visit with my
rod their transgressions, “And with stripes their iniquity.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p37"></span>**33** “But my mercy will I not
withdraw from him; “Nor will I be false in my truth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p38"></span>**34** “I will not profane my
covenant, “And that which is gone forth from my lips I will not alter.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p39"></span>**35** “Once have I sworn by my
holiness, “If to David I lie —

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p40"></span>**36** “His seed for ever shall
endure; “And his throne as the sun before me.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p41"></span>**37** “As the moon it shall be
established for ever, “And \[*as*\] a faithful witness in the heaven.”
Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p42"></span>**38** But thou, even thou, hast
abhorred and rejected *him*; Thou hast been wroth with thy anointed.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p43"></span>**39** Thou hast made to cease the
covenant of thy servant; Thou hast profaned to the earth his crown.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p44"></span>**40** Thou hast broken down all
his walls; Thou hast made his fortresses a ruin.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p45"></span>**41** Plundered him have all who
pass by the way: He hath been a reproach to his neighbors.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p46"></span>**42** Thou hast exalted the right
hand of his oppressors; Thou hast made glad all his adversaries.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p47"></span>**43** Also thou hast blunted the
edge of his sword, And hast not made him to stand in battle.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p48"></span>**44** Thou hast effaced his
splendor, And his throne to the ground thou hast east down.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p49"></span>**45** Thou hast shortened the days
of his youth; Thou hast covered him with disgrace. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p50"></span>**46** How long, O Jehovah! wilt
thou hide thyself for ever? Burn like fire shall thy indignation?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p51"></span>**47** Remember how short-lived I
am!  <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356) Wherefore in vain shouldst
thou have created all the sons of men?

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p53"></span>**48** What man shall live, and
shall not see death? *And* shall deliver his soul from the hand of the
grave? Selah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p54"></span>**49** Where *are* thy former
compassions, O Lord? Thou hast sworn to David in thy truth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p55"></span>**50** Remember, O Lord! the
reproach of thy servants: I have sustained in my bosom all *those*
\[*reproaches*\] of the mighty peoples,

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p56"></span>**51** With which thy enemies have
reproached thee, O Jehovah! With which they have reproached the
footsteps of thy Messiah.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p5"></span>A Psalm of Moses, the man of God

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p6"></span>**1** O Lord! a dwelling-place thou
hast been to us from generation to generation.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p7"></span>**2** Before the mountains were
brought forth, And \[*before*\] thou hadst formed the earth and the
world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p8"></span>**3** Thou shalt turn man to
destruction, And shalt say, “Return ye sons of Adam.”

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p9"></span>**4** For a thousand years in thy
sight *are* as yesterday when it is past, And *as* a watch in the night.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p10"></span>**5** Thou overflowest them;  <span
id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358) they will be a sleep: In the morning
as grass he shall grow.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p12"></span>**6** In the morning he (*or* it)
shall flourish and grow: At the evening he (*or* it) shall be cut down,
and shall wither.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p13"></span>**7** For we fail by thy anger, And
by thy indignation are we affrighted.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p14"></span>**8** Thou hast set our iniquities
before thee, Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p15"></span>**9** For all our days are passed
away in thy indignation: We have spent our years as if a thought.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p16"></span>**10** In the days of our years
*there are* seventy years; And if through strength, eighty years, Yet is
their pride \[*but*\] grief and labor; For it passeth by quickly, and we
fly away.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p17"></span>**11** Who knoweth the power of thy
anger? And according to thy fear is thy wrath.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p18"></span>**12** Teach us so to number our
days, And we shall apply our heart to wisdom.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p19"></span>**13** Return, O Jehovah! how long?
Be pacified towards thy servants.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p20"></span>**14** Satiate us early with thy
goodness, And we will exult and rejoice all our days.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p21"></span>**15** Make us joyful according to
the days of our affliction; *According* to the years in which we have
seen evil.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p22"></span>**16** Let thy work appear towards
thy servants, And thy glory upon their children.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p23"></span>**17** And let there be the beauty
of the Lord our God upon us; And the work of our hands direct thou upon
us; Yea, the work of our hands direct thou.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p3"></span>**1** He who dwelleth in the secret
place of the Most High, Under the shadow of the Almighty shall abide.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p4"></span>**2** I will say to Jehovah, “*Thou
art* my hope and my fortress:” *He is* my God; I will hope in him.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p5"></span>**3** Surely he shall deliver thee
from the snare of the fowler, From the noxious pestilence:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p6"></span>**4** With his wings he shall protect
thee; And under his feathers thou shalt be safe; *Thy* shield and *thy*
buckler *shall be* his truth.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p7"></span>**5** Thou shalt not be afraid at the
terror of the night; At the arrow which flieth by day;

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p8"></span>**6** At the destruction which in
darkness walketh: At the pestilence which wasteth at noon-day.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p9"></span>**7** There shall fall at thy side a
thousand, And ten thousand at thy right hand: To thee it shall not come
nigh.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p10"></span>**8** Only with thine eyes shalt thou
behold, And the reward of the ungodly thou shalt see.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p11"></span>**9** Because thou, O Jehovah! *art*
my protection; The Most High thou hast made thy refuge.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p12"></span>**10** There shall not befall thee
\[*any*\] evil, And the plague shall not come nigh thy tabernacle:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p13"></span>**11** For to his angels he hath
given charge concerning thee, To keep thee in all thy ways.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p14"></span>**12** Upon their hands they shall
bear thee, Lest thou dash against a stone thy foot.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p15"></span>**13** Over the lion and asp thou
shalt walk; Thou shalt tread upon the young lion and dragon.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p16"></span>**14** Because on me he hath reposed,
I will deliver him; I will exalt him because he hath known my name.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxv-p17"></span>**15** He will call upon me, and I
will answer him: With him will I be in trouble; I will deliver him, and
will glorify him.

satisfy him, And will show him my salvation.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p3"></span>**1** It is good to give thanks to
Jehovah, To sing psalms to thy name, O Most High!

goodness, And thy truth in the night.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p9"></span>**5** How magnificent are thy works,
O Jehovah! Exceeding deep are thy thoughts.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p10"></span>**6** The man that is foolish shall
not know them, Neither shall he who is void of wisdom understand them.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p11"></span>**7** When the wicked flourish as
the grass, And all the workers of iniquity spring up, \[*It is*\] that
they may perish for ever.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p12"></span>**8** But thou *art* exalted for
evermore, O Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p13"></span>**9** For lo! thine enemies, O
Jehovah! For lo! thine enemies shall perish; Scattered shall be all the
workers of iniquity:

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p14"></span>**10** But thou shalt exalt my horn
like *that* of the unicorn. I am anointed with fresh oil.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p15"></span>**11** And mine eye shall see
\[*ruin*\] on my oppressors: \[*Of destruction*,\] on those who rise up
against me — On those who trouble me hear shall my ears.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p16"></span>**12** The righteous as the palm
tree shall flourish, As the cedar in Lebanon he shall be multiplied.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p17"></span>**13** Planted in the house of
Jehovah, In the courts of our God, they shall flourish.

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p18"></span>**14** Still shall they bud forth in
old age; Fat and green shall they be;

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p19"></span>**15** That they may proclaim that
upright is Jehovah, my Rock, And *that* there is no iniquity in him.

<span id="xxxv.iv.i"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.i-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.i-p2"></span>PSALM 93

<span id="xxxv.iv.i-p3"></span>**1** Jehovah hath reigned, He hath put
on glory, Put on hath Jehovah strength; He hath girded himself: Also he
hath established the world, It shall not be moved.

<span id="xxxv.iv.i-p4"></span>**2** Fixed is thy throne; \[*Even as*\]
from that time  <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361) thou art, and
from eternity.  <span id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362)

<span id="xxxv.iv.i-p8"></span>**3** Raised have the floods, O Jehovah!
Raised have the floods their voice; Raise shall the floods their waves.

<span id="xxxv.iv.i-p9"></span>**4** By reason of the voices  <span
id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363) of the great waters Terrible are the
waves of the sea: Terrible on high is Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.iv.i-p11"></span>**5** Thy testimonies are verified
exceedingly; To thy house *is* glory; The holiness of Jehovah *is* for
length of days.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p2"></span>PSALM 94

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p3"></span>**1** O Jehovah! God of vengeances! O
God of vengeances! shine forth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p4"></span>**2** Lift up thyself; O judge of the
earth! Render a reward to the proud.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p5"></span>**3** How long shall the ungodly, O
Jehovah! How long shall the ungodly triumph?

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p6"></span>**4** They pour forth, they speak hard
things, Extol themselves do all the workers of iniquity.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p7"></span>**5** Thy people, O Jehovah! they break
in pieces; And thy inheritance they afflict:

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p8"></span>**6** The widow, and the stranger they
slay, And the orphans they put to death.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p9"></span>**7** And they have said, “God shall not
see, “The God of Jacob shall not know..”

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p10"></span>**8** Understand, ye stupid among the
people! And ye fools! when will ye be wise?

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p11"></span>**9** He who planted the ear shall not
He hear? He who formed the eye, shall not He see?

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p12"></span>**10** He who chastiseth the nations,
shall not He correct? He who teacheth man knowledge?

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p13"></span>**11** Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of
men that they are vain.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p14"></span>**12** Blessed *is* the man whom thou
hast instructed, O God! And out of thy law hast taught;

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p15"></span>**13** To give him rest from days of
evil, Whilst there is digged for the ungodly \[*man*\] a pit.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p16"></span>**14** Surely Jehovah will not cast off
his people, And his inheritance he will not forsake.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p17"></span>**15** For return shall judgment unto
righteousness, And \[*follow*\] after him shall all the upright in
heart.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p18"></span>**16** Who will rise up for me against
my adversaries? Who will stand up for me against the workers of
iniquity?

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p19"></span>**17** Unless Jehovah had been a help
to me, My soul had well-nigh dwelt in silence.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p20"></span>**18** If I said, “Slidden hath my
foot,” Thy goodness, O Jehovah! hath sustained me.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p21"></span>**19** In the multitude of my thoughts,
Within me thy comforts cheer my soul.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p22"></span>**20** Shall the throne of iniquities
have fellowship with thee, Framing molestation for law?

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p23"></span>**21** They will gather together
against the soul of the righteous, And the blood of the innocent they
will condemn.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p24"></span>**22** But Jehovah hath been to me for
a fortress; And my God for the rock of my confidence:

<span id="xxxv.iv.ii-p25"></span>**23** And he shall retribute upon them
their own iniquity, And in their wickedness he shall destroy them;
Destroy them shall Jehovah our God.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p2"></span>PSALM 95

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p3"></span>**1** Come let us exult to Jehovah; Let
us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p4"></span>**2** Let us come before his face with
praise, In psalms let us shout for joy unto him.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p5"></span>**3** For a great God *is* Jehovah, And
a great King, above all gods.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p6"></span>**4** For in his hand *are* the deep
places of the earth; And the heights of the mountains are his.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p7"></span>**5** For his is the sea, and he made
it; And the dry land his hands formed.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p8"></span>**6** Come ye, let us worship, and fall
down; Let us kneel before the face of Jehovah, our Maker.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p9"></span>**7** For he *is* our God, And we
\[*are*\] the people of his pastures, And the flock of his hand; To-day,
if his voice ye will hear,

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p10"></span>**8** Harden not your heart, as in
Meribah; As in the day of Massah in the desert,

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p11"></span>**9** When tempt me did your fathers;
They proved me, though they had seen my work.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p12"></span>**10** Forty years I strove with this
generation, And said, “They are a people erring in heart, “And they have
not known my ways.”

<span id="xxxv.iv.iii-p13"></span>**11** Wherefore I swear in my wrath,
“If they shall enter into my rest —”

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p2"></span>PSALM 96

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p3"></span>**1** Sing ye to Jehovah a song that is
new, Sing to Jehovah all the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p4"></span>**2** Sing to Jehovah, bless his name;
Publish from day to day his salvation.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p5"></span>**3** Tell among the heathen his glory;
Among all the peoples his wonders.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p6"></span>**4** For great *is* Jehovah, and to be
praised highly; Terrible \[*is*\] he above all gods.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p7"></span>**5** For all the gods of the nations
are vanities; But Jehovah made the heavens.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p8"></span>**6** Strength and majesty *go* before
him; Power and glory *are* in his sanctuary.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p9"></span>**7** Ascribe to Jehovah, O ye
congregations of peoples! Ascribe to Jehovah glory and strength.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p10"></span>**8** Ascribe to Jehovah the glory of
his name; Bring an offering, and enter into his courts.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p11"></span>**9** Worship before Jehovah in the
beauty of the sanctuary; Tremble before his face let the whole earth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p12"></span>**10** Say ye among the heathen,
“Jehovah reigneth; “Truly established shall be the world, it shall not
be moved: “He shall judge the peoples in righteousness.”

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p13"></span>**11** Rejoice let the heavens, and
exult let the earth; Thunder let the sea, and the fullness thereof.

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p14"></span>**12** Exult let the field, and all
that is in it; Shout for joy together let all the trees of the wood

<span id="xxxv.iv.iv-p15"></span>**13** Before Jehovah; for he cometh,
For he cometh to judge the earth: He shall judge the world in
righteousness, And the peoples in his truth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.v"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p2"></span>PSALM 97

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p3"></span>**1** Jehovah reigneth: Exult let the
earth, Rejoice let the great islands.

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p4"></span>**2** Clouds and darkness *are* round
about him; Righteousness and judgment *are* the seat of his throne.

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p5"></span>**3** A fire before his face shall go,
And shall burn up round about his enemies.

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p6"></span>**4** Enlighten did his lightnings the
world; See and tremble shall the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p7"></span>**5** The mountains like wax melted at
the presence of Jehovah, At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p8"></span>**6** Declared have the heavens his
righteousness, And seen have all the peoples his glory.

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p9"></span>**7** Confounded be all those who serve
graven images, Who glory in *their* inventions: Worship before him let
all the gods.

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p10"></span>**8** Heard and rejoiced hath Zion;
Exulted have the daughters of Judah, Because of thy judgments, O
Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p11"></span>**9** For thou, O Jehovah! *art* high
above all the earth: Exceedingly exalted art thou above all gods.

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p12"></span>**10** Ye who love Jehovah, hate evil:
He preserveth the souls of his meek ones; From the hand of the ungodly
he will deliver them.

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p13"></span>**11** Light is sown for the righteous,
And for the upright in heart joy.

<span id="xxxv.iv.v-p14"></span>**12** Rejoice, O ye righteous! in
Jehovah, And celebrate the memory of his holiness.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi-p2"></span>PSALM 98

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi-p3"></span>A Psalm

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi-p4"></span>**1** Sing ye to Jehovah a song that is
new, For marvels he hath done: Salvation wrought for him hath his own
right hand, And the arm of his holiness.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi-p5"></span>**2** Made known hath Jehovah his
salvation: In the sight of the heathen he hath revealed his
righteousness.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi-p6"></span>**3** He hath remembered his goodness
and *his* truth towards the house of Israel: Seen have all the ends of
the earth the salvation of our God.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi-p7"></span>**4** Exult to Jehovah all the earth;
Make a loud noise, and exult, and sing psalms.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi-p8"></span>**5** Sing psalms to Jehovah upon the
harp, Upon the harp, and with the voice of song:

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi-p9"></span>**6** With trumpets, and the voice of
the cornet, Sing psalms before the King, Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi-p10"></span>**7** Roar let the sea, and the
fullness thereof; The world, and those who dwell therein.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi-p11"></span>**8** Let the floods clap the hand:
Together let the mountains exult

<span id="xxxv.iv.vi-p12"></span>**9** Before Jehovah: for he cometh to
judge the earth; He shall judge the world in righteousness, And the
peoples with rectitude.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.vii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.vii-p2"></span>PSALM 99

<span id="xxxv.iv.vii-p3"></span>**1** Jehovah reigneth; tremble let the
people: He dwelleth *between* the cherubim; moved let be the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vii-p4"></span>**2** Jehovah in Zion is great; And
exalted is he above all nations.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vii-p5"></span>**3** They shall acknowledge thy great
and terrible name: It is holy.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vii-p6"></span>**4** And the strength of the king
loveth judgment; Thou hast established rectitude; Judgement and
righteousness in Jacob thou hast done.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vii-p7"></span>**5** Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And
worship at his footstool: He is holy.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vii-p8"></span>**6** Moses and Aaron among his
priests, And Samuel among those who call upon his name; They cried to
Jehovah and he answered them.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vii-p9"></span>**7** In the pillar of the cloud he
spake to them: They kept his testimonies And his statutes which he gave
them.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vii-p10"></span>**8** O Jehovah, our God! thou didst
answer them: A God propitious thou wast to them, And \[*yet*\] taking
vengeance upon their works.

<span id="xxxv.iv.vii-p11"></span>**9** Exalt ye Jehovah our God, And
worship at the mountain of his holiness; For holy *is* Jehovah our God.

<span id="xxxv.iv.viii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.viii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.viii-p2"></span>PSALM 100

<span id="xxxv.iv.viii-p3"></span>A Psalm for praising

<span id="xxxv.iv.viii-p4"></span>**1** Sing aloud to Jehovah,  <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364) all ye *inhabitants* of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.viii-p6"></span>**2** Serve Jehovah with gladness;
Come into his presence with exultation.

<span id="xxxv.iv.viii-p7"></span>**3** Know that Jehovah He is God; He
made us, and not we ourselves: *We are* his people, and the flock of his
pasture.

<span id="xxxv.iv.viii-p8"></span>**4** Enter his gates with praise, his
courts with exultation; Celebrate him,  <span
id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365) bless his name:

<span id="xxxv.iv.viii-p10"></span>**5** For good is Jehovah, For ever
*endureth* his mercy, And from generation to generation his truth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ix"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.ix-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.ix-p2"></span>PSALM 101

<span id="xxxv.iv.ix-p3"></span>A Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.iv.ix-p4"></span>**1** Of mercy and judgment I will sing;
To thee, O Jehovah, will I sing psalms.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ix-p5"></span>**2** I will act wisely in a perfect
way, Until thou comest to me; I will walk in the integrity of my heart
in the midst of my house.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ix-p6"></span>**3** I will not set before my eyes a
wicked thing; The work of those who turn aside I hate; It shall not
adhere to me.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ix-p7"></span>**4** A heart perverse shall depart from
me; Evil I will not know.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ix-p8"></span>**5** He who slandereth in secret his
neighbor, him will I destroy: The lofty in look and the wide in heart
him I will not suffer.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ix-p9"></span>**6** My eyes *shall be* upon the
faithful of the land, That they may dwell with me: He who walketh in an
upright way, \[*Even*\] he shall minister to me.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ix-p10"></span>**7** He shall not dwell in the midst
of my house, he who worketh deceit; He who speaketh lies shall not be
established before my eyes.

<span id="xxxv.iv.ix-p11"></span>**8** Early will I destroy all the
ungodly of the land; That I may cut off from the city of Jehovah all the
workers of iniquity.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p2"></span>PSALM 102

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p3"></span>A Prayer for the afflicted when he shall
be shut up, and shall pour out his meditation before Jehovah

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p4"></span>**1** O Jehovah! hear my prayer, And let
my cry to thee come.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p5"></span>**2** Hide not thy face from me in the
day of my afflictions; Incline to me thy ear; In the day when I cry,
make haste, answer me.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p6"></span>**3** For consumed like smoke are  <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366) my days, And my bones as a hearth are
burnt up.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p8"></span>**4** Smitten like grass, and withered is
my heart, Because I have forgotten to eat my bread.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p9"></span>**5** By reason of the voice of my
groaning, Cleave do my bones to my flesh.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p10"></span>**6** I am become like a pelican of the
desert, I am become as an owl of the solitudes;

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p11"></span>**7** I have watched and am as the
sparrow *Which is* solitary upon the roof of the house.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p12"></span>**8** Daily reproach me do my enemies;
And those who are mad against me, by me have sworn.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p13"></span>**9** For ashes as bread I have eaten,
And my drink with weeping  <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367) I
have mingled.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p15"></span>**10** Because of thy indignation and
thy wrath; For thou hast lifted me up and cast me down.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p16"></span>**11** My days *are* as a shadow which
declineth; And as grass I am dried up.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p17"></span>**12** And thou, O Jehovah! for ever
shalt dwell, And thy memorial from generation to generation.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p18"></span>**13** Thou thyself shalt arise, thou
shalt have mercy upon Zion; For it is time to compassionate her, For
come is the appointed time.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p19"></span>**14** For take pleasure do thy servants
in her stones, And upon her dust they will have compassion.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p20"></span>**15** And fear shall the Gentiles the
name of Jehovah, And all the kings of the earth thy glory.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p21"></span>**16** For Jehovah hath builded Zion, He
hath appeared in his glory.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p22"></span>**17** He hath regarded the prayer of
the solitary, And hath not despised their prayer.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p23"></span>**18** This shall be written for the
generation to come, And the people \[*to be*\] created shall praise him.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p24"></span>**19** For he hath looked from the high
*place* of his holiness, Jehovah from the heavens upon the earth hath
looked,

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p25"></span>**20** To hear the groaning of the
prisoners To release the sons of death;

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p26"></span>**21** That declared in Zion may be the
name of Jehovah, And his praise in Jerusalem;

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p27"></span>**22** When gathered shall be the
peoples together, And the kingdoms to serve Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p28"></span>**23** He hath afflicted in the way my
strength, He hath shortened my days.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p29"></span>**24** I said, O my God! take me not
away in the midst of my days; *For* throughout generations of
generations *are* thy years.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p30"></span>**25** Aforetime the earth thou hast
founded; And the work of thy hands serve the heavens.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p31"></span>**26** They shall perish but thou shalt
endure; And they all as a garment shall grow old; As a vesture thou
shalt change them, and they shall be changed.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p32"></span>**27** But thou *art always* the same,
And thy years shall not fail.

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p33"></span>**28** The children of thy servants
shall dwell, And their seed before thee shall be established.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p2"></span>PSALM 103

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p3"></span>Of David

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p4"></span>**1** Bless, O my soul! Jehovah, And all
my inward parts *bless* his holy name.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p5"></span>**2** Bless, O my soul! Jehovah, And
forget not all his bounties.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p6"></span>**3** Who forgiveth all thy iniquities;
Who healeth all thy infirmities;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p7"></span>**4** Who redeemeth from the grave thy
life; Who crowneth thee with mercy and compassions;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p8"></span>**5** Who satisfieth with good thy
mouth: Renewed as *that* of the eagle shall be thy youth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p9"></span>**6** Execute doth Jehovah righteousness
And judgments for all who are oppressed.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p10"></span>**7** He made known his ways to Moses,
To the children of Israel his doings.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p11"></span>**8** Compassionate and merciful *is*
Jehovah, Slow to anger and abundant in goodness.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p12"></span>**9** He will not always chide; Neither
for ever will he keep \[*his anger*.\]

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p13"></span>**10** Not according to our sins hath
he dealt with us, Nor according to our iniquities hath he recompensed
us.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p14"></span>**11** For in proportion to the height
of the heavens above the earth, Hath been the greatness of his goodness
upon those who fear him.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p15"></span>**12** As far distant as is the east
from the west, So far hath he removed from us our sills.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p16"></span>**13** As a father is compassionate
towards his children, So is Jehovah compassionate towards those who fear
him.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p17"></span>**14** For he knoweth of what we are
made; He hath remembered that dust are we.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p18"></span>**15** Man... as grass *are* his days:
As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p19"></span>**16** As soon as the wind passeth over
it, it is not; And know it no more shall the place thereof.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p20"></span>**17** But the goodness of Jehovah *is*
from everlasting to everlasting upon those who fear him, And his
righteousness upon the children’s children;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p21"></span>**18** To those who keep his covenant,
And are mindful of his statutes to do them.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p22"></span>**19** Jehovah in the heavens hath
established his throne; And his kingdom over all hath dominion.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p23"></span>**20** Bless Jehovah, *ye* his angels
mighty in strength! Who do his commandment, in hearing the voice of his
word.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p24"></span>**21** Bless Jehovah, all *ye* his
armies! Ye ministers of his, who do his pleasure.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xi-p25"></span>**22** Bless Jehovah, all ye his works!
In all places of his dominion: Bless, O my soul! Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p2"></span>PSALM 104

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p3"></span>**1** Bless, O my soul! Jehovah: O
Jehovah, my God! thou art great exceedingly; With praise and honor thou
hast clothed thyself.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p4"></span>**2** Being arrayed with light as with
a garment; Spreading out the heavens as a curtain;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p5"></span>**3** Flooring in the waters his upper
rooms; Making the clouds his chariot; Walking upon the wings of the
wind:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p6"></span>**4** Making the winds his messengers;
His ministers a fire that flameth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p7"></span>**5** He hath founded the earth upon
its foundations, So that it shall not be moved for ever.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p8"></span>**6** With the deep as with a garment
he hath covered it: Above the mountains stand shall the waters.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p9"></span>**7** At thy rebuke they shall flee; At
the voice of thy thunder they shall suddenly pass away.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p10"></span>**8** Ascend shall the mountains and
descend shall the valleys To the place which thou hast founded for them.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p11"></span>**9** A boundary thou hast set, they
shall not pass over *it*: They shall not return to cover the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p12"></span>**10** Sending out springs by the
valleys, *Which* between the hills shall run.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p13"></span>**11** Drink *thereof* shall all the
beasts of the field: Quench shall the wild asses their thirst.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p14"></span>**12** Nigh time the fowl of the
heaven shall dwell, From the midst of the branches they shall send out
their voice.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p15"></span>**13** Watering the mountains from his
chambers: From the fruit of thy works satisfied shall be the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p16"></span>**14** Making grass to grow for
cattle, And herb for the service of mm: That he may bring forth bread
out of the earth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p17"></span>**15** And wine cheereth the heart of
man, To make *his* face to shine with oil, And bread sustaineth the
heart of man.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p18"></span>**16** Satiated shall be the trees of
Jehovah; The cedars of Lebanon which he hath planted:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p19"></span>**17** For there the birds build their
nests: \[*As for*\] the stork, the fir trees are her dwelling.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p20"></span>**18** The high mountains *are* for
the deer; The rocks a place of shelter for the hedgehogs.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p21"></span>**19** He hath made the moon for set
times: The sun knoweth his going down.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p22"></span>**20** Thou makest darkness, and it is
night; Wherein do creep forth all the beasts of the forest.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p23"></span>**21** The lions roar after their
prey, And in seeking from God their food.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p24"></span>**22** Rise shall the sun, and they
shall gather themselves together, And in their dens shall lie down.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p25"></span>**23** Go forth shall man to his work,
And to his labor, until the evening.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p26"></span>**24** How magnificent are thy works!
O Jehovah! All things in wisdom thou hast made: Filled is the earth with
thy riches.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p27"></span>**25** This sea great, and wide in
extent; Therein are creeping things inntanerable, Beasts both small and
great.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p28"></span>**26** There the ships go, And the
leviathan, which thou hast formed to sport in it.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p29"></span>**27** All things on thee do wait,
That thou mayest give *them* their food in its season.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p30"></span>**28** Thou shalt give it them, they
shall gather \[*it*:\] Thou shalt open thy hand, they shall be satisfied
with good.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p31"></span>**29** Thou shalt hide thy face, they
shall be afraid: Thou shalt take away their spirit, they shall die, and
to their dust shall return.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p32"></span>**30** Thou shalt send forth thy
Spirit, they shall be created: And thou shalt renew the face of the
earth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p33"></span>**31** Glory be to Jehovah for ever:
Rejoice let Jehovah in his works.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p34"></span>**32** He looketh upon the earth, and
it trembleth: If he touch the mountains, they shall smoke.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p35"></span>**33** I will sing to Jehovah whilst I
live: I will sing psalms to my God as long as I have my being.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p36"></span>**34** Let my speech be acceptable to
him: I will rejoice in Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xii-p37"></span>**35** Perish let sinners from the
earth, And the ungodly till they cease to be any more. Bless, O my soul!
Jehovah. Hallelujah.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p3"></span>**1** Celebrate ye Jehovah; invoke his
name: Announce among the peoples his works.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p4"></span>**2** Sing ye to him: sing psalms to
him: Speak of all his wonders.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p5"></span>**3** Rejoice ye in his holy name:
Rejoice let the heart of those who seek Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p6"></span>**4** Seek ye Jehovah, and his
strength; Seek his face continually.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p7"></span>**5** Remember the marvelous works
which he hath done; His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p8"></span>**6** *Ye* seed of Abraham, his
servant, The sons of Jacob his chosen one:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p9"></span>**7** He *is* Jehovah our God; Through
all the earth are his judgments.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p10"></span>**8** He hath remembered for ever his
covenant, The word *which* he commanded to a thousand generations:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p11"></span>**9** Which he made with Abraham, And
his oath *which he swore* to Isaac;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p12"></span>**10** And established it to Jacob
for a law, To Israel for an everlasting covenant:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p13"></span>**11** Saying, “To thee will I give
the land of Canaan, “The cord of your inheritance.”

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p14"></span>**12** When they were very few in
number; And strangers in it;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p15"></span>**13** And walked about from nation
to nation, From *one* kingdom to another people,

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p16"></span>**14** He did not suffer men to hurt
them; And rebuked for their sake kings;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p17"></span>**15** *Saying*, “Touch not my
anointed ones, “And to my prophets do no harm.”

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p18"></span>**16** And he called a famine upon
the land; All the stall of bread he broke.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p19"></span>**17** He sent before them a man, For
a slave sold was Joseph.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p20"></span>**18** They afflicted in the fetters
his feet: The iron entered into his soul:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p21"></span>**19** Until the time that his word
came: The word of Jehovah tried him.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p22"></span>**20** Send did the king and loosed
him; Even the ruler of the peoples, and freed him.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p23"></span>**21** He made him lord over his
house; And ruler over all his substance:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p24"></span>**22** To bind his princes at his
pleasure; And to teach his elders wisdom.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p25"></span>**23** And come did Israel into
Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p26"></span>**24** And he increased his people
exceedingly, He multiplied them above their oppressors.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p27"></span>**25** He turned their heart so that
they hated his people, And dealt craftily with his servants.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p28"></span>**26** He sent Moses, his servant;
Aaron, whom he chose.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p29"></span>**27** They set among them the words
of his signs, And *his* miracles in the land of Ham.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p30"></span>**28** He sent darkness, and made it
dark; And they were not rebellious against his words.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p31"></span>**29** He turned their waters into
blood, And killed their fish.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p32"></span>**30** Their land brought forth
frogs, *Yea even* within the chambers of their kings.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p33"></span>**31** He spake and there came a
swarm of flies, Lice in all their borders.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p34"></span>**32** He gave them for rain, hail,
Flaming fire upon their land.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p35"></span>**33** And he smote their vines and
their fig-trees; And destroyed *every* tree of their border.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p36"></span>**34** He spake, and there came the
locust, And the caterpillar without number;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p37"></span>**35** And they devoured all the
herbage in their land, And consumed the fruit of their ground.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p38"></span>**36** And he smote all the firstborn
in their land, The beginning of all their strength.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p39"></span>**37** And he brought them forth with
silver and gold: And not one among their tribes was a feeble person.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p40"></span>**38** Glad was Egypt at their
departure; For fallen upon them had their terror.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p41"></span>**39** He spread out a cloud for a
covering; And fire to give light by the night.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p42"></span>**40** He  <span
id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368) asked, and brought quails, And with
the bread of heaven he filled them.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p44"></span>**41** He opened the rock, and there
gushed out waters; They ran in the dry *places like* a river.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p45"></span>**42** For he remembered the word of
his holiness, *Which he had spoken* to Abraham his servant.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p46"></span>**43** And he brought forth his
people with joy, With exultation his chosen ones.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p47"></span>**44** And he gave them the lands of
the nations: And the labor of the peoples they inherited.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p48"></span>**45** That they might keep his
ordinances, And that his law they might observe. Hallelujah.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p2"></span>PSALM 106

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p3"></span>Hallelujah

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p4"></span>**1** Celebrate Jehovah, for he is
good; For to everlasting *is* his mercy.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p5"></span>**2** Who shall express the mighty acts
of Jehovah? Who shall declare all his praise?

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p6"></span>**3** Blessed are they who keep
judgment, *Blessed* is he who doeth righteousness at all times.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p7"></span>**4** Remember me, O Jehovah! with the
good will \[*which thou* *bearest towards*\] thy people. Visit me with
thy salvation;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p8"></span>**5** That I may see the good of thy
chosen ones, That I may rejoice in the joy of thy nation, That I may
glory with thy heritage.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p9"></span>**6** We have sinned with our fathers,
We have acted iniquitously, we have done wickedly.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p10"></span>**7** Our fathers in Egypt understood
not thy wonders; They remembered not the multitude of thy kindnesses;
And they rebelled at the sea, at the Red Sea.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p11"></span>**8** Yet he saved them for the sake
of his own name, That. he might cause to be known his power.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p12"></span>**9** And he rebuked the Red Sea, and
it was dried up; And he made them walk in the deeps as in a desert.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p13"></span>**10** And he saved them from the hand
of the enemy, And redeemed them from the hand of the adversary.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p14"></span>**11** And cover did the waters their
oppressors: One of them was not left.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p15"></span>**12** Then they believed his words;
They sang his praise.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p16"></span>**13** They made haste, they forgat
his works; They did not wait for his counsel;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p17"></span>**14** And they lusted greatly in the
desert, And tempted God in the wilderness.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p18"></span>**15** And he gave them their request;
But sent leanness into their souls.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p19"></span>**16** And they envied Moses in the
camp, And Aaron, the saint of Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p20"></span>**17** Open did the earth and
swallowed up Dathan, And covered over the tent of Abiram.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p21"></span>**18** And kindled was a fire in their
company, The flame burned up the ungodly.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p22"></span>**19** They made a calf in Horeb, And
worshipped before the molten image.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p23"></span>**20** And they changed their glory
Into the likeness of an ox that eateth hay.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p24"></span>**21** They forgat God their Savior,
Who had done great things in Egypt;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p25"></span>**22** Miracles in the land of Ham,
Terrible things at the Red Sea.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p26"></span>**23** And he said that he would
destroy them, Unless Moses his chosen had stood in the breach before his
face, To turn away his wrath, that he might not destroy *them*

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p27"></span>**24** And they despised the land of
pleasantness; They believed not his word;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p28"></span>**25** And they mutinied in their
tents, They hearkened not to the voice of Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p29"></span>**26** And he lifted tip his hand
against them, To destroy them in the desert:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p30"></span>**27** And to scatter their seed among
the heathen, And to disperse them throughout the lands.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p31"></span>**28** And they joined themselves to
Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of *things* dead.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p32"></span>**29** And they provoked *God* to
anger by their works: And break in upon them did the plague.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p33"></span>**30** Then stood up Phinehas, and
executed judgment: And stayed was the plague.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p34"></span>**31** And *that* was imputed to him
for righteousness From generation to generation, even for ever.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p35"></span>**32** And they provoked *him* to
anger at the waters of strife, And it turned out in to Moses on their
account:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p36"></span>**33** For they embittered his spirit,
And he spake \[*rashly*\] with his lips.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p37"></span>**34** They did not destroy the
nations, As Jehovah had commanded them:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p38"></span>**35** And they were mingled with the
heathen, And learned their works:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p39"></span>**36** And they served their idols;
Which were to them for ruin.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p40"></span>**37** And they sacrificed their sons
and their daughters to demons;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p41"></span>**38** And they shed innocent blood,
The blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed to
the idols of Canaan; And polluted was the land with bloods.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p42"></span>**39** And they were defiled in their
own works, And were adulterous in their own inventions.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p43"></span>**40** Then  <span
id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369) burn did the wrath of Jehovah against
his people, And he abhorred his inheritance;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p45"></span>**41** And he delivered them into the
hands of the heathen; And those had dominion over them who hated them:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p46"></span>**42** And subdue them did their
enemies, And they were afflicted under their hand.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p47"></span>**43** Many times did he deliver them;
But they provoked *him* with their counsels, And were oppressed in their
iniquity.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p48"></span>**44** Yet he saw when they were in
distress, And heard their cry:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p49"></span>**45** And he remembered towards them
his covenant; And it repented him according to the greatness of his
mercies.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p50"></span>**46** And he made them to find pity
Before all who had led them captive.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p51"></span>**47** Save us, O Jehovah, our God!
And gather us from among the heathen, That we may celebrate thy holy
name, That we may glory in thy praise.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p52"></span>**48** Blessed *be* Jehovah, the God
of Israel, From everlasting to everlasting; And say let all the people,
Amen. Praise ye Jehovah.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p5"></span>**1** “Celebrate Jehovah, for he is
good, “For to everlasting is his mercy.”

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p6"></span>**2** Say *this* let the redeemed of
Jehovah, Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the afflicter.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p7"></span>**3** Whom he hath gathered from the
lands, From the east, and from the west, From the north, and from the
south.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p8"></span>**4** They wandered from the way in the
solitary desert; A city of habitation they found not:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p9"></span>**5** Hungry, also thirsty, *So that*
their soul within them fainted.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p10"></span>**6** Then they cried to Jehovah in
their distress, And from their troubles he delivered them.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p11"></span>**7** And he directed them by a right
way, That they might come to a city of habitation.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p12"></span>**8** Let them celebrate before Jehovah
his mercy, His marvelous works before the sons of men.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p13"></span>**9** For he hath satisfied the soul
that longeth, And the soul that is famished he hath filled with good.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p14"></span>**10** Those who dwell in darkness, and
in the shadow of death, Bound in affliction and iron;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p15"></span>**11** Because they rebelled against
the words of God, And the counsel of the Most High they despised:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p16"></span>**12** And he humbled with trouble
their heart; They were afflicted and *there was* none to help *them*

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p17"></span>**13** They cried to Jehovah in their
distress: From their troubles he delivered them.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p18"></span>**14** He rescued them from darkness
and the shadow of death, And their chains he broke asunder.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p19"></span>**15** Let them celebrate before
Jehovah his mercy, And his marvelous works before the sons of men.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p20"></span>**16** For he hath broken the gates of
brass, And the bars of iron he hath shivered.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p21"></span>**17** Fools on account of the way of
their transgression; And on account of their iniquities are afflicted.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p22"></span>**18** All food loathe doth their soul;
And they approach the gates of death.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p23"></span>**19** Then they cry to Jehovah in
their trouble: From their straits he sayeth them.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p24"></span>**20** He sendeth his word, and healeth
them, And rescueth them from all their corruptions.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p25"></span>**21** Let them celebrate before
Jehovah his mercy, And his marvelous works before the sons of men.

Jehovah, His wonders in the deep.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p29"></span>**25** He speaketh and raiseth the wind
of storm, And lifteth high the waves thereof.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p30"></span>**26** They mount up to the heavens,
They descend into the deeps; Their soul in  <span
id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371) *their* distress is melted away.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p32"></span>**27** They are tossed and stagger as a
drunken man, And all their skill is swallowed up.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p33"></span>**28** And they cry to Jehovah in their
distress, And from their troubles he bringeth them out.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p34"></span>**29** He maketh the storm a calm, So
that quiet are the waves thereof.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p35"></span>**30** And they rejoice because they
are stilled; And he leadeth them unto the haven of their desire.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p36"></span>**31** Let them celebrate before
Jehovah his mercy, And his wonders before the sons of men;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p37"></span>**32** And let them exalt him in the
congregation of the people, And in the assembly of the elders let them
praise him.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p38"></span>**33** He turneth rivers into a desert,
And springs of water into dryness;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p39"></span>**34** A land that is fruitful into
saltness, For the wickedness of those who dwell therein.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p40"></span>**35** He turneth the desert into a
pool of water, And the land of barrenness into springs of water.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p41"></span>**36** And there he causeth to dwell
the famished, That they may prepare a city of habitation;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p42"></span>**37** And sow fields, and plant
vineyards, And eat the fruit of increase.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p43"></span>**38** And he blesseth them, and they
multiply exceedingly; And their cattle he doth not diminish,.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p44"></span>**39** Afterwards they are diminished
and brought low, By reason of anguish, affliction, and sorrow.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p45"></span>**40** He poureth contempt upon
princes, And maketh them to wander in the waste where there is no path.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p46"></span>**41** And he raiseth the afflicted
from *his* misery, And maketh like a flock \[*his*\] families.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xv-p47"></span>**42** See shall the upright ones and
shall rejoice: And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

these things, And they shall understand the loving-kindness of Jehovah?

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p2"></span>PSALM 109

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p3"></span>To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of
David

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p4"></span>**1** O God of my praise! be not
silent;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p5"></span>**2** For the mouth of the ungodly
man, and the mouth of deceit upon me are opened; They have talked with
me with a tongue of guile:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p6"></span>**3** And with words of hatred they
have encompassed me, And have fought against me without a cause.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p7"></span>**4** \[*In return*\] for my love they
have been my adversaries; But I *set myself* to prayer.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p8"></span>**5** And they have requited me evil
for good, And hatred for my love.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p9"></span>**6** Set thou over him an ungodly
man; And let the adversary stand at his right hand.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p10"></span>**7** When he is judged let him go
forth condemned,  <span id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373) And let his
prayer be turned into sin.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p12"></span>**8** Let his days be few; His office
let another receive.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p13"></span>**9** Let his children be fatherless,
And his wife a widow.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p14"></span>**10** And in wandering let his
children wander and beg,  <span id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374) And
seek \[*for bread*\] out of their waste places.  <span
id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375)

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p17"></span>**11** Catch let the extortioner all
which he hath, And let strangers plunder his labor.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p18"></span>**12** Let there be none prolonging
mercy to him; And let there be none to have compassion upon his orphans.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p19"></span>**13** Let his posterity be
destroyed;  <span id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376) In the generation
following let their name be blotted out.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p21"></span>**14** Remembered let be the iniquity
of his fathers before Jehovah; And the wickedness  <span
id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377) of his mother let it not be blotted
out.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p23"></span>**15** Let them be before Jehovah
continually, And let him blot out from the earth their memorial;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p24"></span>**16** Because he remembered not to
do mercy, And persecuted the man \[*that was*\] wretched and poor, And
afflicted in heart, to put *him* to death.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p25"></span>**17** He loved cursing, and let it
come upon him: He delighted not in blessing, and let it be far from him.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p26"></span>**18** And let him be clothed with
cursing as with a garment; And let it come as water into his entrails,
And as oil into his bones.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p27"></span>**19** Let it be to him as a mantle
to cover him, And as a girdle with which continually he may gird himself

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p28"></span>**20** Let this be the recompense
 <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378) of my adversaries from Jehovah,
And of those who speak evil against my soul.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p30"></span>**21** But thou, O Jehovah, my Lord!
deal thou with me for the sake of thy name: Because good *is* thy mercy,
deliver me;

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p31"></span>**22** For poor and needy I am, And
my heart is wounded within me.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p32"></span>**23** As a shadow when it declineth,
I walk about; I am shaken off as the locust.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p33"></span>**24** My knees are become feeble
through fasting; And my flesh hath fallen away from *its* fatness.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p34"></span>**25** But I am become a reproach to
them; When they see me they shake their head.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p35"></span>**26** Help me, O Jehovah, my God!
Save me according to thy mercy.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p36"></span>**27** And they shall know that this
is thy hand, *That* thou, O Jehovah! hast done it.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p37"></span>**28** They shall curse, but thou
shalt bless; When they rise up they shall be put to shame; But thy
servant shall rejoice.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p38"></span>**29** Clothed shall be my
adversaries with disgrace, And they shall be covered as with a garment
with their own shame.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p39"></span>**30** I will praise Jehovah greatly
with my mouth; And in the midst of the great I will celebrate him:

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p40"></span>**31** Because he standeth at the
right hand of the poor one, To save from condemnations his soul.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xviii-p2"></span>PSALM 110

<span id="xxxv.iv.xviii-p3"></span>A Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.iv.xviii-p4"></span>**1** Jehovah said to my Lord, “Sit
thou at my right hand, “Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.”

<span id="xxxv.iv.xviii-p5"></span>**2** The scepter of thy power send
shall Jehovah out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thy enemies.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xviii-p6"></span>**3** Thy people *shall come* with
voluntary offerings, On the day *of the assembling* of thy army, In
beauty of holiness: From the womb as from the morning dawn To thee *has
been* the dew of thy youth.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xviii-p7"></span>**4** Sworn hath Jehovah, and he will
not repent: “Thou art a priest for ever “According to the manner of
Melchisedek.”

<span id="xxxv.iv.xviii-p8"></span>**5** The Lord at thy right hand Hath
crushed in the day of his wrath kings.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xviii-p9"></span>**6** He shall judge among the
heathen, He shall fill *all* with ruins; He shall crush the head over a
great country.

<span id="xxxv.iv.xviii-p10"></span>**7** Of the torrent in the way he
shall drink, Therefore shall he lift up the head.

<span id="xxxv.v.xi-p5"></span>**2** “Often have they afflicted me from
my youth; “Yet they have not prevailed against me.

filled his hand, Nor his bosom he who gathereth handfuls.

thee, O Jehovah!

<span id="xxxv.v.xii-p5"></span>**2** O Lord! hear my voice; Let thy
ears be attentive to the voice of my prayers.

<span id="xxxv.v.xii-p6"></span>**3** If iniquities thou shouldest mark,
O God! O Lord! who shall stand?

<span id="xxxv.v.xii-p7"></span>**4** For with thee is forgiveness that
thou mayest be feared.

<span id="xxxv.v.xii-p8"></span>**5** I have waited for Jehovah, waited
hath my soul; And in his word have I hoped.

<span id="xxxv.v.xii-p9"></span>**6** My soul \[*hath waited*\] for the
Lord Before the watchers of the morning, the watchers of the morning.

<span id="xxxv.v.xiii-p4"></span>**1** O Jehovah! my heart hath not been
elated, Nor lifted up have been my eyes, Nor have I exercised myself in
great matters, Or in things hidden from me.

<span id="xxxv.v.xiii-p5"></span>**2** If I have not framed \[*or set*\]
and quieted my soul, Like one that is weaned from his mother, —  <span

all his affliction:

<span id="xxxv.v.xiv-p5"></span>**2** Who sware to Jehovah, \[*Who*\]
vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

Thou and the ark of thy strength.

<span id="xxxv.v.xiv-p13"></span>**9** Let thy priests be clothed with
righteousness, And let thy meek ones exult.

<span id="xxxv.v.xiv-p14"></span>**10** For the sake of David thy
servant Turn not away the face of thy Christ.

<span id="xxxv.v.xiv-p15"></span>**11** Sworn hath Jehovah to David in
truth, Nor will he turn from it: “Of the fruit of thy belly will I set
upon thy throne.

<span id="xxxv.v.xiv-p16"></span>**12** “If thy children shall keep my
covenant, “And my testimonies, which I will teach them; “Also their
children for ever shall sit upon thy throne.”

will I dwell, because I have loved her.

And *that* our God is above all gods.

<span id="xxxv.v.xvii-p9"></span>**6** All things which Jehovah
pleaseth, lie doeth in the heavens and on the earth, In the sea and in

from the end of the earth: The lightnings for the rain he maketh,
Bringing forth the wind out of his secret places.

<span id="xxxv.v.xvii-p11"></span>**8** He smote the first born of
Egypt, From man even unto beast.

<span id="xxxv.v.xvii-p12"></span>**9** He sent signs and wonders in the

<span id="xxxv.v.xxi-p6"></span>**3** My path and my lying down thou

me up, And hast laid upon me thy hand.

from the And the night as the day shall shine, And the darkness as the

have been fearfully and wonderfully made:  <span

wickedly: Taken thy name falsely have thy adversaries.

them, As my enemies I have held them.

wickedness be in me, And lead me in the way of this life.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiii-p8"></span>**5** Smite me let the righteous man,
\[*it shall be*\] a kindness; And let him chastise me, \[*it shall be*\]
an oil that is precious, It shall not break my head: For yet also my
prayer *shall be* in their calamities.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiii-p9"></span>**6** Cast down on stony places have
been their judges: And they shall hear my words, for they are sweet.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiii-p10"></span>**7** As he who breaketh and cutteth
on the earth, Scattered have been our bones at the mouth of the grave.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiii-p11"></span>**8** Because to thee, O Jehovah! my
Lord! *are* my eyes, In thee I have hoped: do not leave destitute my
soul.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiii-p12"></span>**9** Keep me from the hands of the
snare which they have spread for me. From the nets of those who work
iniquity.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiii-p13"></span>**10** Fall into his nets let the
ungodly ones together, Until I escape.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiv-p2"></span>PSALM 142

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiv-p3"></span>Maschil of David, when he was in the
cave. A Prayer

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiv-p4"></span>**1** With my voice to, Jehovah I
cried; With my voice to. Jehovah I made supplication.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiv-p5"></span>**2** I poured out before his face my
meditation; My affliction before his face I declare.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiv-p6"></span>**3** When perplexed within me was my
spirit, And thou knewest my path: In the way wherein I walked, they laid
a snare for me.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiv-p7"></span>**4** On looking to the right hand, and
beholding, None there was who would know me, Perish did refuge from me,
\[*There was*\] no man seeking after my soul.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiv-p8"></span>**5** I cried to thee, O Jehovah! I
said, Thou *art* my hope, My portion in the land of the living.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiv-p9"></span>**6** Attend to my cry, For under
affliction I labor exceedingly: Deliver me from my persecutors, For they
are too strong for me.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxiv-p10"></span>**7** Rescue from prison my soul, That
I may celebrate thy name: Crown me shall the righteous ones, For thou
shalt recompense me.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p3"></span>A Psalm of David

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p4"></span>**1** O Jehovah! hear my prayer; Give
ear to my supplication; In thy truth answer me, in thy righteousness.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p5"></span>**2** And enter not into judgment with
thy servant, For there shall not be justified in thy sight any living
man.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p6"></span>**3** For persecuted hath the enemy my
soul; He hath prostrated on the earth my life; He hath set me in dark
*places*, as the dead of an age.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p7"></span>**4** And perplexed within me is my
spirit Within me astonished is my heart.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p8"></span>**5** I remembered the days of old, I
meditated on all thy doings; Upon the work of thy hands I meditated.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p9"></span>**6** I spread out my hearts to thee; My
soul, as the earth without water, *is* to thee. Selah.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p10"></span>**7** Hasten, answer me, O Jehovah!
Fail doth my spirit: Hide not thy face from me, Because I shall be like
to those who descend into the pit.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p11"></span>**8** Cause me to hear in the morning
thy mercy, For in thee have I hoped: Show me the way in which I may
walk, For to thee have I lifted up my soul.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p12"></span>**9** Deliver me from my enemies, O
Jehovah! With thee have I hidden \[*myself*.\]

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p13"></span>**10** Teach me to do thy will, For
thou *art* my God: Let thy good Spirit lead me into the right land.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p14"></span>**11** Because of thy name, O Jehovah I
thou wilt quicken me: In thy righteousness bring out of trouble my soul.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxv-p15"></span>**12** And in thy mercy thou wilt
scatter my enemies, And wilt destroy all those who afflict my soul;
Because I *am* thy servant.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p2"></span>PSALM 144

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p3"></span>Of David

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p4"></span>**1** Blessed *be* Jehovah, my
strength, Who teacheth my hands for the fight, My fingers for the
battle.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p5"></span>**2** My goodness, and my fortress, My
citadel, my deliverer for me, My shield, and in him I have hoped, Who
subdueth my people under me.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p6"></span>**3** O Jehovah! what is man that thou
acknowledgest him? The son of man that thou thinkest of him?

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p7"></span>**4** Man to vanity is like, His days
\[*are*\] as a shadow that is passing.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p8"></span>**5** O Jehovah! bow thy heavens and
descend: Touch the mountains and they shall smoke.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p9"></span>**6** Thunder forth thunderings and
scatter them; Shoot out thy arrows, and destroy them.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p10"></span>**7** Send thy hand from on high;
Rescue me and deliver me from waters great, From the hand of the sons of
the alien.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p11"></span>**8** For their mouth hath spoken
falsehood, And their right hand is a right hand of deceit.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p12"></span>**9** O God! a song that is new I will
sing to thee: Upon the nablum, upon the psaltery I will sing psalms to
thee

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p13"></span>**10** Who givest salvation to kings,
Who redeemest David his servant from the hurtful sword.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p14"></span>**11** Redeem me, and rescue me, From
the hand of the sons of the alien, Whose mouth hath spoken falsehood,
And their right hand *is* a right hand of deceit.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p15"></span>**12** Because our sons *are* as
plants Which have grown up in their youth; Our daughters as corners
polished After the similitude of a palace.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p16"></span>**13** Our recesses full, Supplying
all kinds of good things. Our sheep bringing forth thousands, \[*Yea*\]
ten thousands in our streets.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p17"></span>**14** Our oxen to the burden
accustomed; No breach, nor going out, Nor cry in our streets.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvi-p18"></span>**15** Happy the people to whom it is
so, To whom Jehovah is their God.

praise thy name for ever and ever.

praise thy works, And thy power they shall declare.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvii-p8"></span>**5** Upon the majesty of the glory of
thy excellence, And upon the words of thy wonders, I will meditate.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvii-p9"></span>**6** And the might of thy terrible
*works* shall they recount; And thy greatness I will declare.

thy goodness they shall speak forth; And of thy righteousness they shall

his compassions *are* over all his works.

they shall tell, And of thy power they shall speak:

men his mighty acts, And the glory of the beauty of his kingdom.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvii-p16"></span>**13** Thy kingdom *is* a kingdom of
all ages, And thy dominion is throughout generations of generations.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvii-p17"></span>**14** Uphold doth Jehovah all the
falling, He raiseth up all who are bowed down.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvii-p18"></span>**15** The eyes of all in thee do
hope, And thou givest them their food in its season.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvii-p19"></span>**16** Thou openest thy hand And
satisfiest every living *creature* by thy good pleasure.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvii-p20"></span>**17** Righteous *is* Jehovah in all
his ways, And merciful in all his works.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvii-p21"></span>**18** Near *is* Jehovah to all who
call upon him, To all who call upon him in truth.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvii-p22"></span>**19** The desire of those who fear
him he will perform, And their cry he will hear, told he will save
then,.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxvii-p23"></span>**20** Keep doth Jehovah all who love
him, And all the wicked he will destroy.

shall my mouth: And bless shall all flesh his holy name for ever and

shall return to his earth, In that day perish shall his thoughts.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxviii-p8"></span>**5** Blessed *is* he who hath for
his help the God of Jacob; Whose hope is in Jehovah, his God:

sea, and all that is in them: Who keepeth truth for ever:

horse will he take pleasure, Nor in the legs of man will he delight.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxix-p16"></span>**11** Delight doth Jehovah in those
who fear him, \[*In those*\] who hope in his mercy.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxix-p17"></span>**12** Celebrate, O Jerusalem!
Jehovah; Praise thy God, O Zion!

<span id="xxxv.v.xxix-p18"></span>**13** For he strengtheneth the bars
of thy gates; He blesseth thy children in the midst of thee.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxix-p19"></span>**14** Who maketh in thy borders
peace; With the fatness of wheat he satisfieth thee.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxix-p20"></span>**15** When he sendeth forth his word
upon the earth, Very swiftly run doth his word.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxix-p21"></span>**16** Who giveth snow *white* as
wool; The hoarfrost as ashes he scattereth.

<span id="xxxv.v.xxix-p22"></span>**17** He casteth forth his ice as
morsels: Before his cold who shall stand?

<span id="xxxv.v.xxix-p23"></span>**18** He shall send his word: red
shall melt them: Blow shall his breath, *and* flow shall the waters.

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvi-p23"></span> In the French Version it is “the
whole oblation.”

<span id="fn_328"></span>[329](cc12034.htm#fr_328) <span
id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.ii.xvii-p13"></span> In the French Version it is “because
thou shalt have executed *this vengeance.*”

<span id="fn_329"></span>[330](cc12034.htm#fr_329) <span
id="xxxv.ii.xx-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.ii.xx-p15"></span> Literally, “wickedness.”

the Commentary for the literal rendering.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[333](cc12034.htm#fr_332) <span
id="xxxv.ii.xxii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxii-p12"></span> “Psaltery” in the French version.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[334](cc12034.htm#fr_333) <span
id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiii-p15"></span> Literally “man.”

<span id="fn_334"></span>[335](cc12034.htm#fr_334) <span
id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p17"></span> In the French version the reading is
—

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxiv-p18"></span>“And let men know even unto the ends
of the earth,  
That God ruleth in Jacob. Selah.”

<span id="fn_335"></span>[336](cc12034.htm#fr_335) <span
id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxvii-p13"></span> The free translation of the French
version is here adopted. The literal rendering of the Hebrew text is,
“In the scales in going up they \[*are lighter\]* than vanity together.”
To this Calvin strictly adheres in his Latin version.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[337](cc12034.htm#fr_336) <span
id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p7"></span> Literally, “iniquities.”

<span id="fn_337"></span>[338](cc12034.htm#fr_337) <span

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxx-p11"></span> In the French version it is “by the
power.”

<span id="fn_338"></span>[339](cc12034.htm#fr_338) <span

<span id="xxxv.ii.xxxi-p10"></span> That is, the Jordan. See <span

<span id="fn_340"></span>[341](cc12034.htm#fr_340) <span
id="xxxv.iii.v-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p21"></span> Literally, “moreover.” But see the
Commentary.

<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p26"></span> “<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p26.1"></span>In
organo musico.” — *Lat.* “<span id="xxxv.iii.v-p26.2"></span>Avec irgyes

instrument of the nebel, *or* psaltery.”

<span id="fn_342"></span>[343](cc12034.htm#fr_342) <span
id="xxxv.iii.vi-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.vi-p22"></span> In the French versions this line
reads — “Blessed be the Lord *God* of Israel, the God of gods.”

<span id="fn_343"></span>[344](cc12034.htm#fr_343) <span
id="xxxv.iii.vii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p3"></span> According to the Hebrew division,
Part 3 extends from <span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p3.1"></span>[Psalm

to <span id="xxxv.iii.vii-p3.2"></span>[Psalm

inclusive

<span id="fn_344"></span>[345](cc12034.htm#fr_344) <span
id="xxxv.iii.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p6"></span> In French version it is, “which thou
hast acquired of old.”

<span id="fn_345"></span>[346](cc12034.htm#fr_345) <span
id="xxxv.iii.viii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p10"></span> From the obscurity of the literal
translation of the Latin version, the free reading of the French version
is adopted in these two lines.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[347](cc12034.htm#fr_346) <span
id="xxxv.iii.viii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.viii-p19"></span> Literally “break.”

<span id="fn_347"></span>[348](cc12034.htm#fr_347) <span
id="xxxv.iii.xii-p49.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.xii-p50"></span> In the French version it is “to the
grasshopper.”

<span id="fn_348"></span>[349](cc12034.htm#fr_348) <span
id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiii-p15"></span> “That is,” says Jebb, “let there be
some spared out of those who are marked out for death by their enemies.”

<span id="fn_349"></span>[350](cc12034.htm#fr_349) <span
id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p19"></span> “Shoot” is the rendering in the
French version, the word being “<span
id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p19.1"></span>provin.” In the Latin version it is
“<span id="xxxv.iii.xiv-p19.2"></span>filium,” “son,” the literal
translation of the Hebrew text.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[351](cc12034.htm#fr_350) <span

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p6"></span> Psaltery. — *Fr.*

<span id="fn_351"></span>[352](cc12034.htm#fr_351) <span
id="xxxv.iii.xv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.xv-p8"></span> We follow here the French version. In
the Latin version, instead of “trumpet” it is “harp,” which is evidently
incorrect.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[353](cc12034.htm#fr_352) <span
id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.xvii-p21"></span> In the French version it is
“greatly.”

<span id="fn_353"></span>[354](cc12034.htm#fr_353) <span

<span id="fn_355"></span>[356](cc12034.htm#fr_355) <span
id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p15"></span> In the French version it is “thou
hast founded.”

<span id="fn_356"></span>[357](cc12034.htm#fr_356) <span
id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p51.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiii-p52"></span> Literally, “of what age I am.”

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p3"></span> According to the Hebrew division,

<span id="fn_358"></span>[359](cc12034.htm#fr_358) <span
id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxiv-p11"></span> In the French version it is, “Thou
carriest them away as do floods of water.”

<span id="fn_359"></span>[360](cc12034.htm#fr_359) <span
id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p6"></span> In the French version it is “<span
id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p6.1"></span>le manichordion,” which Randle Cotgrave
translates “an (old fashioned) Clavicord.”

<span id="fn_360"></span>[361](cc12034.htm#fr_360) <span
id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p6.2"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iii.xxvi-p7"></span> In the French version this line
reads, — “With the song upon the harp.”

<span id="fn_361"></span>[362](cc12034.htm#fr_361) <span
id="xxxv.iv.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.i-p5"></span> “From that time,” that is, from the
creation of the world mentioned in the previous verse.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[363](cc12034.htm#fr_362) <span
id="xxxv.iv.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.i-p6"></span> In explaining this verse, Calvin
expresses his approbation of a translation somewhat different: —

<span id="xxxv.iv.i-p7"></span>“As from eternity thou art,  
Even so thy throne hath been erected (or prepared) from that time.”

<span id="fn_363"></span>[364](cc12034.htm#fr_363) <span
id="xxxv.iv.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.i-p10"></span> “<span id="xxxv.iv.i-p10.1"></span>A

<span id="fn_365"></span>[366](cc12034.htm#fr_365) <span
id="xxxv.iv.viii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.viii-p9"></span> In the French it is “give glory to
him.”

<span id="fn_366"></span>[367](cc12034.htm#fr_366) <span
id="xxxv.iv.x-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.x-p7"></span> From verse 3d to verse 11th inclusive,
the verbs we have rendered in the present tense are in the preterite in
the Latin version, but in this instance we follow the French version in
which they are in the present.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[368](cc12034.htm#fr_367) <span
id="xxxv.iv.x-p13.1"></span>

<span id="fn_368"></span>[369](cc12034.htm#fr_368) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiii-p43"></span> In the Commentary, (vol 4, p. 202)
we have translated “they asked,” by mistake. Calvin seems to understand
this as spoken of God.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[370](cc12034.htm#fr_369) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p43.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xiv-p44"></span> Literally, “And.”

<span id="fn_372"></span>[373](cc12034.htm#fr_372) <span

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvi-p16"></span> In the French version it is “in.”

<span id="fn_373"></span>[374](cc12034.htm#fr_373) <span

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p11"></span> Literally, “wicked” or “ungodly.”

<span id="fn_374"></span>[375](cc12034.htm#fr_374) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p15"></span> In the French version it is — “And
let his children be vagabonds and beg.”

<span id="fn_375"></span>[376](cc12034.htm#fr_375) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p16"></span> In the French version it is — “And
seek \[*for bread*\] going out of their waste *or* ruined dwellings.”

<span id="fn_376"></span>[377](cc12034.htm#fr_376) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p20"></span> Literally, “be to destruction.”

<span id="fn_377"></span>[378](cc12034.htm#fr_377) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p22"></span> In the French version it is “sin.”

<span id="fn_378"></span>[379](cc12034.htm#fr_378) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xvii-p29"></span> Literally, “work.”

<span id="fn_380"></span>[381](cc12034.htm#fr_380) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xx-p8.3"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xx-p9"></span> In the Latin version it is “<span
id="xxxv.iv.xx-p9.1"></span>verba,” “words,” but Calvin rejects this
translation in the commentary. In the French version it is “affairs.”

<span id="fn_381"></span>[382](cc12034.htm#fr_381) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xxi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xxi-p10"></span> Literally, “who exalteth himself to
dwell.”

<span id="fn_382"></span>[383](cc12034.htm#fr_382) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xxiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xxiii-p8"></span> In the French version it is “they
have mouths.”

<span id="fn_383"></span>[384](cc12034.htm#fr_383) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xxiv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xxiv-p5"></span> The translation of these two verses
is free, being modified by Calvin’s Commentary. For the literal
translation, see Vol. 4.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[385](cc12034.htm#fr_384) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xxiv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xxiv-p11"></span> Literally, it is “hath recompensed
upon thee.”

<span id="fn_385"></span>[386](cc12034.htm#fr_385) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xxvi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xxvi-p5"></span> In the French version, in this and
the two following verses, it is “that.”

<span id="fn_386"></span>[387](cc12034.htm#fr_386) <span
id="xxxv.iv.xxvi-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.iv.xxvi-p17"></span> Literally, “thrusting thou has
thrust.”

<span id="fn_387"></span>[388](cc12034.htm#fr_387) <span

<span id="xxxv.iv.xxvi-p23"></span> Literally, “chastising hath
chastised me.”

<span id="fn_388"></span>[389](cc12034.htm#fr_388) <span
id="xxxv.v.i-p67.2"></span>

<span id="xxxv.v.i-p68"></span> Here the reading in the Latin text is
ambiguous. The above is the reading in the French version; and as
determined by Calvin in the Commentary.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[390](cc12034.htm#fr_389) <span
id="xxxv.v.i-p81.2"></span>

<span id="xxxv.v.i-p82"></span> In the French version it is, “have
forged lies.”

<span id="fn_390"></span>[391](cc12034.htm#fr_390) <span
id="xxxv.v.i-p139.2"></span>

<span id="xxxv.v.i-p140"></span> “<span

id="xxxv.v.i-p171.2"></span>

<span id="xxxv.v.i-p172"></span> Literally, “I have prevented the
twilight.” — But see the Commentary.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[393](cc12034.htm#fr_392) <span
id="xxxv.v.iv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.v.iv-p9"></span> In the French version it is, “for there
are set.”

<span id="fn_393"></span>[394](cc12034.htm#fr_393) <span
id="xxxv.v.vi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="fn_394"></span>[395](cc12034.htm#fr_394) <span
id="xxxv.v.xii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.v.xii-p11"></span> This supplement is in the Latin
version but not in the French.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[396](cc12034.htm#fr_395) <span
id="xxxv.v.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.v.xiii-p6"></span> These two lines which are David’s oath
are in the abrupt form in which the Jews were accustomed to swear.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[397](cc12034.htm#fr_396) <span
id="xxxv.v.xiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.v.xiv-p9"></span> These two verses have also the abrupt
termination characteristic of the Jewish form of swearing.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[398](cc12034.htm#fr_397) <span
id="xxxv.v.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.v.xv-p6"></span> “<span

<span id="fn_398"></span>[399](cc12034.htm#fr_398) <span
id="xxxv.v.xvii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.v.xvii-p20"></span> In the French version the verb for
“speak” in this line; and the verbs for “see” and “hear” in the two next
lines, are in the present tense.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[400](cc12034.htm#fr_399) <span
id="xxxv.v.xix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxxv.v.xix-p9"></span> Literally, “above the head of my joy.”
