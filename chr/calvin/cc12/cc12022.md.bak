<span id="xxiii-p1"></span>PSALM 139

<span id="xxiii-p2"></span>In this Psalm David, that he may dismiss the
deceptive coverings under which most men take refuge, and divest himself
of hypocrisy, insists at large upon the truth that nothing can elude the
divine observation — a truth which he illustrates from the original
formation of man, since he who fashioned us in our mother’s womb, and
imparted to every member its particular office and function, cannot
possibly be ignorant of our actions. Quickened by this meditation to a
due reverential fear of God, he declares himself to have no sympathy
with the ungodly and profane, and beseeches God, in the confidence of
conscious integrity, not to forsake him in this life.  <span

<span id="xxiii-p5"></span>To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David.

<span id="xxiii.i-p1"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
139:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#001.md)<span id="xxiii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p2"></span>**1.** O Jehovah! thou hast searched me,
and knowest me. **2.** Thou hast known my downsitting and mine uprising,
thou understandest my thought afar off. **3.** Thou besiegest my path,
and my lying clown, and art acquainted with all my ways. **4.** For
there is not a word in my tongue, but lo! O Lord! Thou knowest it
altogether. **5.** Thou hast shut me up behind and before, and hast laid
thine hand upon me. **6.** Thy knowledge is wonderful above me:  <span
id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) it is high, I cannot attain to it.

<span id="xxiii.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxiii.i-p5"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p6"></span>**1.** *O Jehovah! thou hast searched me*
David declares, in the outset of this Psalm, that he does not come
before God with any idea of its being possible to succeed by
dissimulation, as hypocrites will take advantage of secret refuges to
prosecute sinful indulgences, but that he voluntarily lays bare his
innermost heart for inspection, as one convinced of the impossibility of
deceiving God. It is thine, he says, O God! to discover every secret
thought, nor is there anything which can escape thy notice, He then
insists upon particulars, to show that his whole life was known to God,
who watched him in all his motions — when he slept, when he arose, or
when he walked abroad. The word <span id="xxiii.i-p6.1"></span>רע*,
rea,* which we have rendered *thought,* signifies also a *friend* or
*companion,* on which account some read — *thou knowest what is nearest
me afar* off, a meaning more to the point than any other, if it could be
supported by example. The reference would then be very appropriately to
the fact that the most distant objects are contemplated as near by God.
Some for *afar off* read *beforehand,* in which signification the Hebrew
word is elsewhere taken, as if he had said — O Lord, every thought which
I conceive in my heart is already known to thee beforehand. But I prefer
the other meaning, That God is not confined to heaven, indulging in a
state of repose, and indifferent to human concerns, according to the
Epicurean idea, and that however far off we may be from him, he is never
far off from us.

<span id="xxiii.i-p7"></span>The verb <span
id="xxiii.i-p7.1"></span>זרה, *zarah,* means to *winnow* as well as to
*compass,* so that we may *very* properly read the third verse — *thou
winnowest my ways,*  <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) a
figurative expression to denote the bringing of anything which is
unknown to light. The reader is left to his own option, for the other
rendering which I have adopted is also.appropriate. There has been also
a difference of opinion amongst interpreters as to the last clause of
the verse. The verb <span id="xxiii.i-p8.3"></span>סכן, *sachan,* in the
Hiphil conjugation, as here, signifies to *render successful,* which has
led some to think that David here thanks God for crowning his actions
with success; but this is a sense which does not at all suit the scope
of the Psalmist in the context, for he is not speaking of thanksgiving.
Equally forced is the meaning given to the words by others — Thou hast
made me to get acquainted or accustomed with my ways;  <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) as if he praised God for being endued
with wisdom and counsel. Though the verb be in the Hiphil, I have
therefore felt no hesitation in assigning it a neuter signification —
Lord, thou art accustomed to my ways, so that they are familiar to thee.

<span id="xxiii.i-p10"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p11"></span>**4.** *For there is not a word, etc*. The
words admit a double meaning. Accordingly some understand them to imply
that God knows what, we are about to say before the words are formed on
our tongue; others, that though we speak not a word, and try by silence
to conceal our secret intentions, we cannot elude his notice. Either
rendering amounts to the same thing, and it is of no consequence which
we adopt. The idea meant to be conveyed is, that while the tongue is the
index of thought to man. being the great medium of communication, God,
who knows the heart, is independent of words. And use is made of the
demonstrative particle *lo!* to indicate emphatically that the innermost
recesses of our spirit stand present to his view.

<span id="xxiii.i-p12"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p13"></span>In verse fifth some read — *behind and
before thou hast fashioned me;*  <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md)
but <span id="xxiii.i-p14.5"></span>צור, *tsur,* often signifies *to
shut up,* and David, there can be no doubt, means that he was surrounded
on every side, and so kept in sight by God, that he could not escape in
any quarter. One who finds the way blocked up turns back; but David
found himself hedged in behind as well as before. The other clause of
the verse has the same meaning; for those put a very forced
interpretation upon it who think that it refers to God’s fashioning us,
and applying his hand in the sense of an artizan to his work; nor does
this suit with the context. And it is much better to understand it as
asserting that God by his hand, laid as it were upon men, holds them
strictly under his inspection, so that they cannot move a hair’s breadth
without his knowledge.  <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md)

<span id="xxiii.i-p16"></span><span id="xxiii.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.i-p17"></span>**6.** *Thy knowledge is wonderful above
me* Two meanings may be attached to <span
id="xxiii.i-p17.1"></span>ממני: *mimmenni.* We may read *upon me,* or,
*in* *relation to me,* and understand David to mean that God’s knowledge
is seen to be wonderful in forming such a creature as man, who, to use
an old saying’, may be called a little world in himself; nor can we
think without astonishment of the consummate artifice apparent in the
structure of the human body, and of the excellent endowments with which
the human soul is invested. But the context demands another
interpretation; and we are to suppose that David, prosecuting the same
idea upon which he had already insisted, exclaims against the folly of
measuring God’s knowledge by our own, when it rises prodigiously above
us. Many when they hear God spoken of conceive of him as like unto
themselves, and such presumption is most condemnable. Very commonly they
will not allow his knowledge to be greater than what comes up to their
own apprehensions of things. David, on the contrary, confesses it to be
beyond his comprehension, virtually declaring that words could not
express this truth of the absoluteness with which all things stand
patent to the eye of God, this being a knowledge having’ neither bound
nor measure, so that he could only contemplate the extent of it with
conscious imbecility.

<span id="xxiii.ii"></span>

<span id="xxiii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxiii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
139:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007.md)<span
id="xxiii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.ii-p2"></span>**7.** Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?
rind whither shall flee from thy face? **8.** If I ascend up into
heaters, thou art there; if I lie down in the sepulcher, lo! thou art
there. **9.** Shall I take the wings of the morning, that I may dwell in
the uttermost parts of the sea? **10.** Even there shall thy hand lead
me, and thy right hand shall hold me. **11.** If I shall say; at least
the darkness shall cover me, and the night shall be light for me;
**12.** Even the darkness shall not hide from thee, and the night shall
be lightened up as day, and darkness as the light.

<span id="xxiii.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxiii.ii-p4"></span><span id="xxiii.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.ii-p5"></span>**7.** *Whither shall I go from thy
Spirit?* I consider that David prosecutes the same idea of its being’
impossible that men by any subterfuge should elude the eye of God. By
the *Spirit of God* we are not here, as in several other parts of
Scripture, to conceive of his power merely, but his understanding and
knowledge.  <span id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) In man the spirit is
the seat of intelligence, and so it is here in reference to God, as is
plain from the second part of the sentence, where by *the face of God*
is meant his knowledge or inspection. David means in short that he could
not change from one place to another without God seeing him, and
following him with his eyes as he moved. They misapply the passage who
adduce it as a proof of the immensity of God’s essence; for though it be
an undoubted truth that the glory of the Lord fills heaven and earth,
this was not at present in the view of the Psalmist, but the truth that
God’s eye penetrates heaven and hell, so that, hide in what obscure
corner of the world he might, he must be discovered by him. Accordingly
he tells us that though he should fly to heaven, or lurk in the lowest
abysses, from above or from below all was naked and manifest before God.
*The wings of the morning,*  <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) or
of Lucifer, is a beautiful metaphor, for when the sun rises on the
earth, it transmits its radiance suddenly to all regions of the world,
as with the swiftness of flight. The same figure is employed in <span
id="xxiii.ii-p7.2"></span>[Mal
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#002.md)<span id="xxiii.ii-p7.2"></span>.
And the idea is, that though one should fly with the speed of light, he
could find no recess where he would be beyond the reach of divine power.
For by *hand* we are to understand power, and the assertion is to the
effect that should man attempt to withdraw from the observation of God,
it were easy for him to arrest and draw back the fugitive.  <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md)

<span id="xxiii.ii-p9"></span><span id="xxiii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.ii-p10"></span>**11.** *If I shall say,* etc. David
represents himself as a man using every possible method to make his
escape from a situation of embarrassment. So having acknowledged that it
was vain to dream of flight, he bethinks himself of another remedy, and
says, If no speed of mine can bear me out of the range of God’s vision,
yet, on the supposition of light being removed, the darkness might cover
me, that I might have a short breath of respite. But this also he
declares to be hopeless, as God sees equally well in the deepest
darkness as at noon-day. It is a mistake in my opinion to consider, as
some have done, that the two clauses of the verse are to be taken
separately, and read, *If I shall say the darkness will cover me, even
the night shall be as light before me* — meaning that darkness would be
converted into light, and so though he saw nothing himself, he would
stand manifest before the eye of God. David is rather to be considered
as in both clauses expressing what he might be supposed to feel desirous
of, and intimates that, could he only find any covert or subterfuge, he
would avail himself of the license;  <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) “if I shall say, at least the darkness
will cover me, and the night be as light for me,” that is, in the sense
in which it is so to the robbers or wild beasts of the forest, who then
range at greater liberty. That this is the proper construction of the
words we may infer from the particle <span
id="xxiii.ii-p11.2"></span>גם*, gam.* If any one should ‘think it a very
unnecessary observation to say that as respects God there is no
difference between light and darkness, it is enough to remind him that
all observation proves with what reluctance and extreme difficulty men
are brought to come forward openly and ‘unreservedly into God’s
presence. In words we all grant that God is omniscient; meanwhile what
none would ever think of controverting we secretly make no account of
whatsoever, in so far as we make no scruple of mocking God, and lack
even that reverence of him which we extend to one of our
fellow-creatures. We are ashamed to let men know and witness our
delinquencies; but we are as indifferent to what God may think of us, as
if our sins were covered and veiled from his inspection. This
infatuation if not sharply reproved will soon change light, so far as we
are concerned, into darkness, and therefore David insists upon the
subject at length in order to refute our false apprehensions. Be it our
concern to apply the reproofs given, and stir ourselves up by them, when
we feel disposed to become secure.

<span id="xxiii.iii"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xxiii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
139:13-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#013.md)<span
id="xxiii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iii-p2"></span>**13.** For thou hast possessed  <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) my reins; thou hast covered me  <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) in my mother’s womb, **14.** I will
praise thee; for I have been made wonderful terribly; marvellous are thy
works, and my soul shall know them well. **15.** My strength is not hid
from thee,  <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) which thou hast made
in secret: I was woven together in the lowest parts of the earth.
**16.** Thine eyes did see my shapelessness; all are written in thy
book, they were formed by days, and not one of them.

<span id="xxiii.iii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xxiii.iii-p7"></span><span id="xxiii.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iii-p8"></span>**13.** *For thou hast possessed my
reins* Apparently he prosecutes the same subject, though he carries it
out somewhat farther, declaring that we need not be surprised at God’s
knowledge of the most secret thoughts of men, since he formed their
hearts and their reins. He thus represents God as sitting king in the
very reins of man, as the center of his jurisdiction, and shows it ought
to be no ground of wonder that all the windings and recesses of our
hearts are known to him who, when we were inclosed in our mother’s womb,
saw us as clearly and perfectly as if we had stood before him in the
light of mid-day. This may let us know the design with which David
proceeds to speak of man’s original formation, tits scope is the same in
the verse which follows, where, with some ambiguity in the terms
employed, it is sufficiently clear and obvious that David means that he
had been fashioned in a manner wonderful, and calculated to excite both
fear and admiration,  <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) so that he
breaks forth into the praises of God. One great reason of the carnal
security into which we fall, is our not considering how singularly we
were fashioned at first by our Divine Maker. From this particular
instance David is led to refer in general to all the works of God, which
are just so many wonders fitted to draw our attention to him. The true
and proper view to take of the works of God, as I have observed
elsewhere, is that which ends in wonder. His declaration to the effect
that *his soul should well know* these wonders, which far transcend
human comprehension, means no more than that with humble and sober
application he would give his attention and talents to obtaining such an
apprehension of the wonderful works of God as might end in adoring the
immensity of his glory. The knowledge he means, therefore, is not that
which professes to comprehend what, under the name of wonders, he
confesses to be incomprehensible, nor of that kind which philosophers
presumptuously pretend to, as if they could solve every mystery of God,
but simply that religious attention to the works of God which excites to
the duty of thanksgiving.

<span id="xxiii.iii-p10"></span><span id="xxiii.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iii-p11"></span>**15.** *My strength was not hid from
thee* That nothing is hid from God David now begins to prove from the
way in which man is at first formed, and points out God’s superiority to
other artificers in this, that while they must have their work set
before their eyes before they can form it, he fashioned us in our
mother’s womb. It is of little importance whether we read *my strength*
or *my bone,* though I prefer the latter reading. He next likens the
womb of the mother to *the lowest caverns* or *recesses of the earth.*
Should an artizan intend commencing a work in some dark cave where there
was no light to assist him, how would he set his hand to it? in what way
would he proceed? and what kind of workmanship would it prove?  <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) But God makes the most perfect work of
all in the dark, for he fashions man in mother’s womb. The verb <span
id="xxiii.iii-p12.1"></span>רקם, *rakam,* which means *weave together,*
 <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) is employed to amplify and
enhance what the Psalmist had just said. David no doubt means
figuratively to express the inconceivable skill which appears in the
formation of the human body. When we examine it, even to the nails on
our fingers, there is nothing which could be altered, without felt
inconveniency, as at something disjointed or put out of place; and what,
then, if we should make the individual parts the subject of enumeration?
 <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) Where is the embroiderer who —
with all his industry and ingenuity — could execute the hundredth part
of this complicate and diversified structure? We need not then wonder if
God, who formed man so perfectly in the womb, should have an exact
knowledge of him after he is ushered into the world.

<span id="xxiii.iii-p19"></span><span id="xxiii.iii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iii-p20"></span>**16.** *Thine eyes beheld my
shapelessness, etc.* The embryo, when first conceived in the womb, has
no form; and David speaks of God’s having known him when he was yet a
shapeless mass, <span id="xxiii.iii-p20.1"></span>τὸ κύημα*,* as the
Greeks term it; for <span id="xxiii.iii-p20.2"></span>τὸ εμβρυον is the
name given to the foetus from the time of conception to birth inclusive.
The argument is from the greater’ to the less. If he was known to God
before he had grown to certain definite shape, much less could he now
elude his observation. He adds, that *all things were written in his
book;* that is, the whole method of his formation was well known to God.
The term *book* is a figure taken from the practice common amongst men
of helping their memory by means of books and commentaries. Whatever is
an object of God’s knowledge he is said to have registered in writing,
for he needs no helps to memory. Interpreters are not agreed as to the
second clause. Some read <span id="xxiii.iii-p20.3"></span>ימים,
*yamim,* in the nominative case, *when days were made;* the sense being,
according to them — All my bones were written in thy book, O God! from
the beginning of the world, when days were first formed by thee, and
when as *yet* none of them actually existed. The other is the more
natural meaning, That the different parts of the human body are formed
in a succession of time; for in the first germ there is no arrangement
of parts, or proportion of members, but it is developed, and takes its
peculiar form progressively.  <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md)
There is another point on which interpreters differ. As in the particle
<span id="xxiii.iii-p21.1"></span>לא, *lo,* the <span
id="xxiii.iii-p21.2"></span>א, *aleph,* is often interchangeable with
<span id="xxiii.iii-p21.3"></span>ו *vau;* some read <span
id="xxiii.iii-p21.4"></span>לו*, to him,* and others <span
id="xxiii.iii-p21.5"></span>לא *not.* According to the first reading,
the sense is, that though the body is formed progressively, it was
always one and the same in God’s book, who is not dependent upon time
for the execution of his work. A sufficiently good meaning, however, can
be got by adhering’ without change to the negative particle, namely,
that though the members were formed in the course of days, or gradually,
none of them had existed; no order or distinctness of parts having been
there at first, but a formless substance. And thus our admiration is
directed to the providence of God in gradually giving’ shape and beauty
to a confused mass.  <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md)

<span id="xxiii.iv-p2"></span>**17.** How precious also are thy thoughts

them, they shall be multiplied above the sand: I have awaked, and am
still with thee.

<span id="xxiii.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxiii.iv-p4"></span><span id="xxiii.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.iv-p5"></span>**17.** *How precious also are thy
thoughts unto me* It is the same Hebrew word, <span
id="xxiii.iv-p5.1"></span>רעה, *reah,* which is used here as in the
second verse, and means *thought,* not *companion* or *friend,* as many
have rendered it, after the Chaldee translator, under the idea that the
Psalmist is already condescending upon the distinction between the
righteous and the wicked. The context requires that he should still be
considered as speaking of the matchless excellence of divine providence.
He therefore repeats — and not without reason — what he had said before;
for we apparently neglect or underestimate the singular proofs of the
deep wisdom of God, exhibited in man’s creation, and the whole
superintendence and government of his life. Some read — *How rare are
thy thoughts;* but this only darkens the meaning. I grant we find that
word made use of in the Sacred History, (<span
id="xxiii.iv-p5.2"></span>[1Sa
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1003.htm#001)<span id="xxiii.iv-p5.2"></span>,.md)
where the oracles of the Lord are said to have been rare, in the time of
Eli. But it also means *precious,* and it is enough that we retain the
sense which is free from all ambiguity. He applies the term to God’s
thoughts, as not lying within the compass of man’s judgment. To the same
effect is what he adds that the *sums* or aggregates of them were great
and mighty; that is, sufficient to overwhelm the minds of men. The
exclamation made by the Psalmist suggests to us that were men not so
dull of apprehension, or rather so senseless, they would be struck by
the mysterious ways of God, and would humbly and tremblingly sist
themselves before his tribunal, instead of presumptuously thinking that
they could evade it. The same truth is set forth in the next verse, that
if any should attempt to number the hidden judgments or counsels of God,
their immensity is more than *the sands of the sea.* Our capacities
conseqently could not comprehend the most infinitesimal part of them. As
to what follows — *I have a waked, and am still with, thee,*
interpreters have rendered the words differently; but I have no doubt of
the meaning simply being that David found new occasion, every time he
awoke from sleep, for meditating upon the extraordinary wisdom of God.
When he speaks of rising, we are not to suppose he refers to one day,
but agreeably to what he had said already of his thoughts being absorbed
in the incomprehensible greatness of divine wisdom, he adds that every
time *he awoke* he discovered fresh matter for admiration. We are thus
put in possession of the true meaning of David, to the effect that God’s
providential government of the world is such that nothing can escape
him, not even the profoundest thoughts. And although many precipitate
themselves in an infatuated manner into all excess of crime, under the
idea that God will never discover them, it is in vain that they resort
to hiding-places, from which, however reluctantly, they must be dragged
to light. The truth is one which we would do well to consider more than
we do, for while we may cast a. glance at our hands and our feet, and
occasionally survey the elegance of our shape with complacency, there is
scarcely one in a hundred who thinks of his Maker. Or if any recognize
their life as coming from God, there is none at least who rises to the
great truth that he who formed the ear, and the eye, and the
understanding heart, himself hears, and sees, and knows everything.

<span id="xxiii.v-p6"></span><span id="xxiii.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.v-p7"></span>**19.** *If thou shalt slay,* etc. It is
unnatural to seek, as some have done, to connect this with the preceding
verse. Nor does it seem proper to view the words as expressing a wish —
“I wish,” or, “Oh! if thou God wouldst slay the wicked.” Neither can I
subscribe to the idea of those who think that David congratulates
himself upon the wicked being cut off. The sentiment seems to me to be
of another kind, that he would apply himself to the consideration of the
divine judgments, and advance in godliness and in the fear of his name,
so often as vengeance was taken upon the ungodly. There can be no
question that God designs to make an example of them, that his elect
ones may be taught by their punishment to withdraw themselves from their
society. David was of himself well disposed to the fear and worship of
God, and yet he needed a certain check, like other saints, as Isaiah
says, (<span id="xxiii.v-p7.1"></span>[Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009)<span id="xxiii.v-p7.1"></span>,.md)
“when God has sent abroad his judgments, the inhabitants of the earth
shall learn righteousness,” that is, to remain in the fear of the Lord.
At the same time, I have no doubt that the Psalmist presents himself
before God as witness of his integrity; as if he had said, that he came
freely and ingenuously to God’s bar, as not being one of the wicked
despisers of his name, nor having any connection with them.

<span id="xxiii.v-p8"></span><span id="xxiii.v-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.v-p9"></span>**20.** *Who have spoken of thee wickedly.*
He intimates the extent to which the wicked proceed when God spares
them, and forbears to visit them with vengeance. They not merely
conclude that they may perpetrate any crime with impunity, but openly
blaspheme their Judge. He takes notice of their *speaking wickedly,* in
the sense of their taking no pains to disguise their sin under plausible
pretences, as persons who have some shame remaining will exercise a
certain restraint upon their language, but they make no secret of the
contempt they entertain for God. The second clause, where he speaks of
their taking God’s name falsely, some have interpreted too restrictedly
with reference to their sin of perjury. Those,come nearer the truth who
consider that the wicked are spoken of as taking God’s name in vain,
when they conceive of him according to their own idle fancies. We see
from experience, that most men are ignorant of what God is, and judge of
him rather as one dead than alive. In words they all acknowledge him to
be judge of the world, but the acknowledgment comes to nothing, as they
straightway denude him of his office of judgment, which is to take God’s
name in vain, by tarnishing the glory of it, and, in a manner, deforming
it. But as *name* is not in the original, and <span
id="xxiii.v-p9.1"></span>נשא*, nasa,* means *to lift Up,* or *on high,*
I think we are warranted rather to interpret the passage as meaning’,
that they carried themselves with an arrogant and false pride. This
elation or haughtiness of spirit is almost always allied with that
petulance of which he. had previously taken notice. What other reason
can be given for their vending such poisonous rancour against God, but
pride, and forgetfulness, on the one hand, of their own insignificance
as men, and on the other, of the power which belongeth unto the Lord? On
this account he calls them God’s *adversaries,* for all who exalt
themselves above the place which they should occupy, act the part of the
giants who warred against heaven.

<span id="xxiii.v-p10"></span><span id="xxiii.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.v-p11"></span>**21.** *Shall I not hold in hatred those
that hate thee?* He proceeds to mention how greatly he had profited by
the meditation upon God into which he had been led, for, as the effect,
of his having realized his presence before God’s bar, and reflected upon
the impossibility of escaping the eye of him who searches all deep
places, he now lays down his resolution to lead a holy and pious life.
In declaring his hatred of those who despised God, he virtually asserts
thereby his own integrity, not as being free from all sin, but as being
devoted to godliness, so that he detested in his heart everything which
was contrary to it. Our attachment to godliness must be inwardly
defective, if it do not generate an abhorrence of sin, such as David
here speaks of. If that zeal for the house of the Lord, which he
mentions elsewhere, (<span id="xxiii.v-p11.1"></span>[Ps
69:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#009)<span id="xxiii.v-p11.1"></span>,.md)
burn in our hearts, it would be an unpardonable indifference silently to
look on when his righteous law was violated, nay, when his holy name was
trampled upon by the wicked. As to the last word in the verse, <span
id="xxiii.v-p11.2"></span>קוט, *kut*, means *to dispute with,* or
*contend,* and may be understood as here retaining’ the same sense in
the Hithpael conjugation, unless we consider David to have more
particularly meant, that he inflamed himself so as to stir up his mind
to contend with them. We thus see that he stood forward strenuously in
defense of the glory of God, regardless of the hatred of the whole
world, and waged war with all the workers of iniquity.

<span id="xxiii.v-p12"></span><span id="xxiii.v-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.v-p13"></span>**22.** *I hate them with perfect hatred.*
Literally it is, I hate them with perfection of hatred. He repeats the
same truth as formerly, that such was his esteem for God’s glory that he
would have nothing’ in common with those who despised him. He means in
general that he gave no countenance to the works of darkness, for
whoever connives at sin and encourages it through silence, wickedly
betrays God’s cause, who has committed the vindication of righteousness
into our hands. David’s example should teach us to rise with a lofty and
bold spirit above all regard to the enmity of the wicked, when the
question concerns the honor of God, and rather to renounce all earthly
friendships than falsely pander with flattery to the favor of those who
do everything to draw down upon themselves the divine displeasure. We
have the more need to attend to this, because the keen sense we have of
what concerns our private interest, honor, and convenience, makes us
never hesitate to engage in contest when any one injures ourselves,
while we are abundantly timid and cowardly in defending the glory of
God. Thus, as each of us studies his own interest and advantage, the
only thing which incites us to contention, strife, and war, is a desire
to avenge our private wrongs; none is affected when the majesty of God
is outraged. On the other hand, it is a proof of our having a fervent
zeal for God when we have the magnanimity to declare irreconcilable war
with the wicked and them who hate God, rather than court their favor at
the expense of alienating the divine layout. We are to observe, however,
that the hatred of which the Psalmist speaks is directed to the sins
rather than the persons of the wicked. We are, so far as lies in us, to
study peace with all men; we are to seek the good of all, and, if
possible, they are to be reclaimed by kindness and good offices: only so
far as they are enemies to God we must strenuously confront their
resentment.

<span id="xxiii.v-p14"></span><span id="xxiii.v-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.v-p15"></span>**23.** *Search me, O God!* He insists
upon this as being the only cause why he opposed the despisers of God,
that he himself was a genuine worshipper of God, and desired others to
possess the same character. It indicates no common confidence that he
should submit, himself so boldly to the judgment of God. But being fully
conscious of sincerity in his religion, it was not without due
consideration that he placed himself so confidently before God’s bar;
neither must we think that he claims to be free from all sin, for he
groaned under the felt burden of his transgressions. The saints in all
that they say of their integrity still depend only upon free grace. Yet
persuaded as they are that their godliness is approved before God,
notwithstanding their falls and infirmities, we need not wonder that
(hey feel themselves at freedom to draw a distinction between themselves
and the wicked. While he denies that his heart was double or insincere,
he does not profess exemption from all sin, but only that he was not
devoted to wickedness; for <span id="xxiii.v-p15.1"></span>עצב, *otseb,*
does not mean any sin whatever, but *grief, trouble,* or *pravity* — and
sometimes metaphorically *an idol.*  <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) But the last of these meanings will
not apply here, for David asserts his freedom not from superstition
merely, but unrighteousness, as elsewhere it is said, (<span
id="xxiii.v-p16.3"></span>[Isa
59:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#007)<span id="xxiii.v-p16.3"></span>,.md)
that in the ways of such men there is “trouble and destruction,” because
they carry everything by violence and wickedness. Others think the
allusion is to a bad conscience, which afflicts the wicked with inward
torments, but this is a forced interpretation. Whatever sense we attach
to the word, David’s meaning simply is, that though he was a man subject
to sin, he was not devotedly bent upon the practice of it.

<span id="xxiii.v-p17"></span><span id="xxiii.v-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii.v-p18"></span>**24.** *And lead me,* etc. I see no
foundation for the opinion of some that this is an imprecation, and that
David adjudges himself over to punishment. It is true, that “the way of
all the earth” is an expression used sometimes to denote death, which is
common to all, but the verb here translated to *lead* is more commonly
taken in a good than a bad sense, and I question if the phrase *way of
this life* ever means death.  <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) It
seems evidently to denote the full continuous term of human life, and
David prays God to guide him even to the end of his course. I am aware
some understand it to refer to eternal life, nor is it. denied that the
world to come is comprehended under the full term of life to which the
Psalm\~ ist alludes, but it seems enough to hold by the plain sense of
the words, That God would watch over his servant to whom he had already
shown kindness to the end, and not forsake him in the midst of his days.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[199](cc12022.htm#fr_198.md) <span
id="xxiii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xxiii-p3"></span> This Psalm has often been admired for the
grandeur of its sentiments, the elevation of its style, as well as the
variety and beauty of its imagery. Bishop Lowth, in his 29th Prelection,
classes it amongst the Hebrew idyls, as next to the 104th, in respect
both to the conduct of the poem, and the beauty of the style. “If it be
excelled,” says he, “(as perhaps it is) by the former in the plan,
disposition, and arrangement of the matter, it is not in the least
inferior in the dignity and elegance of its sentiments, images, and
figures.” “Amongst its other excellencies,” says Bishop Mant, “it is for
nothing more admirable than for the exquisite skill with which it
descants on the perfections of the Deity. The Psalmist’s faith in the
omnipresence and omniscience of Jehovah is in the commencement depicted
· with a singular and beautiful variety of the most lively expressions:
nor can anything be more sublime than that accummulation of the noblest
and loftiest images, in the 7th and following verses, commensurate with
the limits of created nature, whereby the Psalmist labors to impress
upon the mind some notion of the infinity of God.” If we compare this
sacred poem with any hymn of classical antiquity in honor of the heathen
deities, the immense superiority of the sentiments it contains must
convince any reasonable person that David and the Israelites, though
inferior in other respects to some other nations, surpassed them in
religious knowledge. No philosopher of ancient times ever attained to
such sublime views of the perfections and moral government of God as the
Hebrew Prophets. How are we to account for this difference but on the
supposition of the divine origin of the religion of the Hebrews? On any
other supposition these Psalms are a greater miracle than any of those
recorded by Moses.

<span id="xxiii-p4"></span>Bishop Horsley refers the composition of this
Psalm to a later age than that of David. “The frequent Chaldaisms,” says
he, “of the diction, argue no very high antiquity.” Dr. Adam Clarke, on
the same ground, argues that it was; not written by the sweet singer of
Israel, but during or after the time of the captivity. Other critics,
however, maintain that the several Chaldaisms to be found in it afford
no foundation for such an opinion. “How any critic,” says Jebb, “*can*
assign this Psalm to other than David, I cannot understand. Every line,
every thought, every turn of expression and transition is his, and his
only. As for the arguments drawn from the two Chaldaisms which occur,
(<span id="xxiii-p4.1"></span>רבעי for <span
id="xxiii-p4.2"></span>רבצי, and <span id="xxiii-p4.3"></span>עריך for
<span id="xxiii-p4.4"></span>צריך,) this is really nugatory. These
Chaldaisms consist merely in the substitution of one letter for another
very like it in shape, and easily to be mistaken by a transcriber,
particularly by one who had been used to the Chaldee idiom: but the
moral arguments for David’s author-ship are so strong as to
overwhelm.’my such verbal or rather *literal* criticism, were even the
objections more formidable than they actually are.” — *Jebb’s Literal
Translation of the Psalms,* etc., volume 2.

<span id="xxiii.i-p8"></span> Piscator, Campensis, Pagninus, Luther, and
our English Version, read “thou compassest.” This no doubt gives the
meaning, of the original, though not the precise idea, which is noticed
on the margin of our English Bible to be “winnowest.” *The* verb <span
id="xxiii.i-p8.1"></span>זרה*, zarah,* employed, signifies *to disperse,
to fan, to ventilate, to winnow;* and here it denotes that as men
separate the corn from the chaff, so God separates between, or
investigates, the good and the bad in the daily conduct of men. Hence
the Septuagint reads <span id="xxiii.i-p8.2"></span>ἐξιχνίασας, “thou
hast investigated.” Bishop Hare, who renders “thou dost compass,”
supposes it to be a metaphor taken from hunting. “Winnowing,” says
Archbishop Secker,” would sound uncouth But Mudge hath hit on the word
*siftest,* which, though an idea somewhat different, suits very well.”

<span id="xxiii.i-p14"></span> Thus the Septuagint have <span

the rendering of the Syriac. Those who embrace this view take the verb,
as if the root were <span id="xxiii.i-p14.2"></span>יצר, *yatsar.*
“But,” says Phillips, “it is certain that the root of <span
id="xxiii.i-p14.3"></span>צרתני must be <span
id="xxiii.i-p14.4"></span>צור, *to afflict, press, besiege.* Hence the
meaning of the verse is, ‘Thou hast so pressed upon, or besieged me,
both behind and before, that I find there is no escaping from thee;
*Thou hast placed thy hand* upon me, so that I am quite in thy power.’
The whole passage is a figure, representing God’s thorough knowledge of

<span id="xxiii.ii-p8"></span> Dathe understands *thy hand* of God’s
gracious presence to defend the Psalmist; and such may be the meaning of
the words. But whether we take them in this sense, or according to
Calvin, as expressing man’s being under the power of God, in whatever
part of the world he may be, they illustrate the divine omniscience,
which Calvin regards as the chief design of the inspired writer.

<span id="xxiii.iii-p3"></span> “The usual signification of <span
id="xxiii.iii-p3.1"></span>קנה is, *to possess, to acquire;* but here it
is thought to contain the notion of *forming,* or *creating.* The reason
of this difference in the sense may be accounted for from the
circumstance, that in Arabic there are two verbs to which <span
id="xxiii.iii-p3.2"></span>קנה may correspond, viz., one *to possess,*
and another *to form.* So in <span id="xxiii.iii-p3.3"></span>[Ge
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#019.md)<span
id="xxiii.iii-p3.3"></span>, God is said to be ‘the *possessor* (<span
id="xxiii.iii-p3.4"></span>קנה) of heaven and earth.’ The Septuagint for
<span id="xxiii.iii-p3.5"></span>קנה, reads <span
id="xxiii.iii-p3.6"></span>ὅς ἔκτισε, *who created,* and the Vulgate,
<span id="xxiii.iii-p3.7"></span>*qui creavit* Again in <span
id="xxiii.iii-p3.8"></span>[Pr

for <span id="xxiii.iii-p3.9"></span>קנני the Chaldee has <span
id="xxiii.iii-p3.10"></span>בראני*, hath begotten,* or *created me.*
From these and other passages it is evident that <span
id="xxiii.iii-p3.11"></span>קנה was supposed by the ancient interpreters
to have the sense of *to form,* or *create;* and this meaning seems to
be required in the verse before us, which comports with the next verb.”

where God is said to have “clothed us with skin and flesh, and fenced us
with bones and sinews.” “A work so astonishing,” observes Bishop Horne,
“that before the Psalmist proceeds in his description of it, he cannot
help breaking forth in rapture at the thought: ‘I will praise thee, for!
I am fearfully and wonderfully made.’”

was so terse and expressive a description of the physical conformation
of man given by any human being. So *fearfully* are we made, that there
is not an action or gesture of our bodies, which does not, apparently,
endanger some muscle, vein, or sinew, the rupture of which would destroy
either life or health. We are so *wonderfully* made, that our
organization infinitely surpasses, in skill, contrivance, design, and
adaptation of means to ends, the most curious and complicated piece of
mechanism, not only ever executed ‘by art and man’s device, but ever
conceived by the human imagination.” — *Warner*.

<span id="xxiii.iii-p13"></span> “<span id="xxiii.iii-p13.1"></span>רקם
is ‘to embroider.’” — *Phillips.* Mant translates the verse thus: —

<span id="xxiii.iii-p14"></span>“By all, but not by thee unknown,  
My substance grew, and, o’er it thrown,  
The fine-wrought web from nature’s loom,  
All wove in secret and in gloom.”

<span id="xxiii.iii-p15"></span>And after observing that the foetus is
gradually formed and matured for the birth, like plants and flowers
under ground, he adds — “The process is compared to that in a piece of
work wrought with a needle, or fashioned in the loom: which, with all
its beautiful variety of color, and proportion of figure, ariseth by
degrees to perfection, under the hand of the artist, framed according to
a pattern lying before him, from a rude mass of silk, or other
materials. Thus, by the power and wisdom of God, and after a plan
delineated in his book, is a shapeless mass wrought up into the most
curious texture of nerves, veins, arteries, bones, muscles, membranes,
and skin, most skilfully interwoven and connected with each other, until
it becometh a body harmoniously diversified with all the limbs and
lineaments of a man, not one of which at first appeared, any more than
the figures were to be seen in the ball of silk. But then, which is the
chief thing here insisted on by the Psalmist, whereas the human
artificer must have the clearest light whereby to accomplish his task,
the divine work-master seeth in secret, and effecteth all his wonders
within the dark and narrow confines of the womb.” Bishop Lowth supposes
that the full force and beauty of the metaphor in this passage will not
be understood, unless it is perceived that the Psalmist alludes to the
art of embroidery as consecrated by the Jews to sacred purposes, in
decorating the garments of the priests and the curtains at the entrance
of the tabernacle. “In that most perfect ode, <span
id="xxiii.iii-p15.1"></span>[Psalm
139](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#000.md)<span
id="xxiii.iii-p15.1"></span>,” says he, “which celebrates the immensity
of the omnipresent Deity, and the wisdom of the divine artificer in
forming the human body, the author uses a metaphor derived from the most
subtle art of Phrygian workmen:

<span id="xxiii.iii-p16"></span>*‘When I was formed in the secret
place,  
*W*h*en *I was wrought with a needle in the depths of the earth.*

<span id="xxiii.iii-p17"></span>Whoever observes this, (in truth he will
not be able to observe it in the common translations,)and at the same
time reflects upon the wonderful mechanism of the human body, the
various amplifications of the veins, arteries, fibres, and membranes;
the ‘indescribable texture’ of the whole fabric; may indeed feel the
beauty and gracefulness of this well-adapted metaphor, but will miss
much of its force and sublimity, unless he be apprised that the art of
designing in needle-work was wholly dedicated to the use of the
sanctuary, and by a direct precept of the divine law, chiefly employed
in furnishing’ a part of the sacerdotal habits, and the veils for the
entrance of the tabernacle. (<span id="xxiii.iii-p17.1"></span>[Ex

was dignified by being consecrated altogether to the use of religion;
and the workmanship of which was so exquisite, that even the sacred
writings seem to attribute it to a supernatural guidance. See <span
