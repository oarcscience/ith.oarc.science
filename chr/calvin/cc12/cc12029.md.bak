<span id="xxx-p1"></span><span id="xxx-p1.1"></span>PSALM 146  <span
id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md)

<span id="xxx-p3"></span>After stirring up himself, and others by his
example, to praise God, David animadverts upon the diseased disposition,
almost universally prevalent, to deceive ourselves by expectations
entertained from various quarters. He, at the same time, points out the
remedy — that our whole hope should be centered in God. To persuade us
to resort to him more readily, he touches shortly upon some proofs of
his power and mercy.

<span id="xxx-p4"></span>Hallelujah.

<span id="xxx.i"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p1"></span><span id="xxx.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
146:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#001.md)<span id="xxx.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p2"></span>**1.** Praise Jehovah, O my soul! **2.** I
will praise Jehovah in my life; I will sing psalms to my God so long as
I shall have being. **3.** Trust not in princes; in the son of man in
whom there is not safety. **4.** His breath shall go forth; he shall
return to his earth, in that day his thoughts  <span
id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) shall perish. **5.** Blessed is he
whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in Jehovah, his God.

<span id="xxx.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxx.i-p5"></span><span id="xxx.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p6"></span>**1.** *Praise Jehovah.* The five last Psalms
close with the same word with which they begin.  <span
id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md) But having in general called upon all
to praise God, he addresses himself, or, which is the same thing, his
soul, only that under the name of *soul* he addresses his inward self
more emphatically. We may infer from this, that the influence which
moved him was not volatile and superficial, (as many will blame
themselves with remissness on this point, and then immediately lapse
into it again,) but a staid and constant affection, followed up by
activity, and proved by its effects not to be feigned. As David felt,
that good endeavors are frustrated or hindered through the craft of
Satan, he thinks it proper to apply a stimulus for exciting his own
zeal, in the first place, before professing to be a leader or teacher to
others. Although his heart was truly and seriously in the work, he would
not rest in this, until he had acquired still greater ardor. And if it
was necessary for David to stir himself up to the praises of God, how
powerful a stimulant must we require for a more difficult matter when we
aim at the divine life with self-denial. As to the religious exercise
here mentioned, let us feel that we will never be sufficiently active in
it, unless we strenuously exact it from ourselves. As God supports and
maintains his people in the world with this view, that they may employ
their whole life in praising him, David very properly declares, that he
will do this to the end of his course.

<span id="xxx.i-p8"></span><span id="xxx.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p9"></span>**3.** *Trust not in princes* This admonition
is appropriately inserted, for one means by which men blind themselves
is that of involving their minds through a number of inventions, and
being thus prevented from engaging in the praises of God. That God may
have the whole praise due to him, David exposes and overthrows those
false stays on which we would otherwise be too much disposed to trust.
His meaning is, that we should withdraw ourselves from man in general,
but he names *princes*, from whom more is to be feared than common men.
For what promise could poor people hold out, or such as need the help of
others? The great and wealthy, again, have a dangerous attraction
through the splendor attaching to them, suggesting to us the step of
taking shelter under their patronage. As the simple are fascinated by
looking to their grandeur, he adds, that the most powerful of the
world’s princes is but a *son of man* This should be enough to rebuke
our folly in worshipping them as a kind of demigods, as Isaiah says,
(<span id="xxx.i-p9.1"></span>[Isa
31:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#003)<span id="xxx.i-p9.1"></span>,.md)
“The Egyptian is man, and not God; flesh, and not spirit.” Although
princes then are furnished with power, money, troops of men, and other
resources, David reminds us, that it is wrong to place our trust in
frail mortal man, and vain to seek safety where it cannot be found.

<span id="xxx.i-p10"></span>This he explains more fully in the verse,
which follows, where he tells us how short and fleeting the life of man
is. Though God throw loose the reins, and suffer princes even to invade
heaven in the wildest enterprises, the passing of the spirit, like a
breath, suddenly overthrows all their counsels and plans. The body being
the dwelling-place of the soul, what is here said may very well be so
understood; for at death God recalls the spirit. We may understand it
more simply, however, of the vital breath; and this will answer better
with the context — that as soon as man has ceased to breathe, his corpse
is subject to putrefaction. It follows, that those who put their trust
in men, depend upon a fleeting breath. When he says that *in that day
all his thoughts perish,* or *flow away*, perhaps under this expression
he censures the madness of princes in setting no bounds to their hopes
and desires, and scaling the very heavens in their ambition, like the
insane Alexander of Macedon, who, upon hearing that there were other
worlds, wept that he had not yet conquered one, although soon after the
funeral urn sufficed him. Observation itself proves that the schemes of
princes are deep and complicated. That we may not fall, therefore, into
the error of connecting our hopes with them, David says that the life of
princes also passes away swiftly and in a moment, and that with it all
their plans vanish.

<span id="xxx.i-p11"></span><span id="xxx.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p12"></span>**5.** *Blessed is he*, *etc*. As it would
not have been enough to reprove the sin, he submits the remedy upon
which the proper correction of it depends; and this is, that the hopes
of men are only stable and well-founded when they rest entirely upon
God. For even the wicked sometimes come the length of acknowledging the
folly of trust in man. Accordingly they are often angry with themselves
for being so inconsiderate as to expect deliverance from men; but by
neglecting the remedy, they are not extricated from their error. The
Psalmist having condemned the infatuation, which we have seen to be
natural to us all, wisely subjoins that they are blessed who trust in
God. Jeremiah observes the same order. (<span
id="xxx.i-p12.1"></span>[Jer. 17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#007)<span id="xxx.i-p12.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xxx.i-p13"></span>“Cursed is he that trusteth in man, and
maketh flesh his arm,” etc.;

<span id="xxx.i-p14"></span>and then — “Blessed is the man whose hope
the Lord is.” When David pronounces *those blessed whose help is the
Lord*, he does not restrict the happiness of believers to present sense,
as if they were only happy when God openly and in outward acts appeared
as their helper, but he places their happiness in this — that they are
truly persuaded of its being entirely by the grace of God they stand. He
calls him *the God of Jacob*, to distinguish him from the multitude of
false gods in which unbelievers gloried at that time; and there was good
reason for this; for while all propose to themselves to seek God, few
take the right way. In designating the true God by his proper mark, he
intimates that it is only by an assured faith of adoption that any of us
can rest upon him; for he must show himself favorable to us before we
can look for help from him.

<span id="xxx.ii"></span>

<span id="xxx.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxx.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
146:6-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#006.md)<span id="xxx.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.ii-p2"></span>**6.** Who made heaven and earth, the sea,
and all things which are in them: who keepeth truth for ever. **7.**
Rendering right to the unjustly oppressed, giving bread to the hungry,
Jehovah, loosening the bound. **8.** Jehovah enlightening the blind,
 <span id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) Jehovah raising up the bowed
down, Jehovah loving the righteous. **9.** Jehovah guarding the
strangers; he relieves the fatherless and widow, and will destroy the
way of the wicked. **10.** Jehovah shall reign for ever; thy God, O
Zion! from generation to generation. Hallelujah.

<span id="xxx.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxx.ii-p5"></span><span id="xxx.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.ii-p6"></span>**6.** *Who made heaven*, *etc*. By all
these epithets he confirms the truth previously stated. For though at
first sight it may seem inappropriate to speak of the Creation, the
power of God bears most pertinently upon his helping us whenever danger
is near. We know how easily Satan tempts to distrust, and we are thrown
into a state of trembling agitation by the slightest causes. Now, if we
reflect that God is the Maker of heaven and earth, we will reasonably
give him the honor of having the government of the world which he
created in his hands and power. There is in this first ascription, then,
a commendation of his power, which should swallow up all our fears. As
it is not enough that God is merely able to help us, but as a promise is
farther necessary, to the effect that he is willing and shall do it,
David next declares *that he is faithful and true,* that, on discovering
his willingness, no room may be left for hesitation.

<span id="xxx.ii-p7"></span><span id="xxx.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.ii-p8"></span>**7.** *Rendering right*, *etc*. He
instances other kinds both of the power and goodness of God, which are
just so many reasons why we should hope in him. All of them bear upon
the point, that the help of God will be ready and forthcoming to those
who are in the lowest circumstances, that accordingly our miseries will
be no barrier in the way of his helping us; nay, that such is his
nature, that he is disposed to assist all in proportion to their
necessity. He says first, that God *renders justice to the oppressed,*
to remind us that although in the judgment of sense God connives at the
injuries done to us, he will not neglect the duty which properly belongs
to him of forcing the wicked to give an account of their violence. As
God, in short, would have the patience of his people tried, he here
expressly calls upon the afflicted not to faint under their troubles,
but composedly wait for deliverance from one who is slow in interposing,
only that he may appear eventually as the righteous judge of the world.
It follows, that he *gives bread to the hungry*. We learn from this that
he is not always so indulgent to his own as to load them with abundance,
but occasionally withdraws his blessing, that he may succor them when
reduced to hunger. Had the Psalmist said that God fed his people with
abundance, and pampered them, would not any of those under want or in
famine have immediately desponded? The goodness of God is therefore
properly extended farther to the feeding of the hungry. What is added is
to the same purpose — that *he looses them that are bound, and
enlightens the blind.* As it is the fate of his people to be straitened
by anxiety, or pressed down by human tyranny, or reduced to extremity,
in a manner equivalent to being shut up in the worst of dungeons, it was
necessary to announce, by way of comfort, that God can easily find an
outgate for us when brought into such straits. *To enlighten the blind*
is the same with giving light in the midst of darkness. When at any time
we know not what to do — are in perplexity, and lie confounded and
dismayed, as if the darkness of death had fallen upon us — let us learn
to ascribe this title to God, that he may dissipate the gloom and open
our eyes. So when he is said *to raise up the bowed down,* we are taught
to take courage when weary and groaning under any burden. Nor is it
merely that God would here have his praises celebrated; he in a manner
stretches out his hand to the blind, the captives, and the afflicted,
that they may cast their grief’s and cares upon him. There is a reason
for repeating the name *Jehovah* three times. In this way he stimulates
and excites men to seek him who will often rather chafe and pine away in
their miseries, than betake themselves to this sure asylum.  <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) What is added in the close of the
verse — *that Jehovah loves the righteous*, would seem to be a
qualification of what was formerly said. There are evidently many who,
though they are grievously afflicted, and groan with anxiety, and lie in
darkness, experience no comfort from God; and this because in such
circumstances they provoke God more by their contumacy, and by failing
for the most part to seek his mercy, reap the just reward of their
unthankfulness. The Psalmist therefore very properly restricts what he
had said in general terms of God’s helping the afflicted, to the
righteous — that those who wish to experience his deliverance, may
address themselves to him in the sincere exercise of godliness.

<span id="xxx.ii-p10"></span><span id="xxx.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.ii-p11"></span>**9.** *Jehovah guarding*, *etc*. By
*strangers, orphans*, and *widows,* the Psalmist means all those in
general who are destitute of the help of man. While all show favor to
those who are known to them and near to them, we know that strangers
are, for the most part, exposed to injurious treatment. We find
comparatively few who come forward to protect and redress widows and
orphans; it seems lost labor, where there is no likelihood of
compensation. Under these cases the Psalmist shows that whatever the
grievance may be under which we suffer, the reason can only be with
ourselves if God, who so kindly invites all who are in distress to come
to him, does not stretch forth his arm for our help. On the other hand,
he declares that everything will have an adverse and unfortunate issue
to those who wickedly despise God. We have said upon the first Psalm,
that by *the way* is meant the course of life in general. God *will
destroy the way of the wicked,* inasmuch as he will curse all their
counsels, acts, attempts, and enterprises, so that none of them shall
have good success. However excellent they may be in planning, although
they may be crafty and sharp-sighted, and abound in strength of
resources of every kind, God will overturn all their expectations. While
he extends his hand to those who are his people, and brings them through
all obstacles, and even impassable ways, he on the contrary destroys the
path of the wicked, when apparently most open and plain before them.

<span id="xxx.ii-p12"></span><span id="xxx.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.ii-p13"></span>**10.** *Jehovah shall reign*, *etc*. He
directs his discourse to the Church, that he may more effectually
persuade all God’s people of their really finding him to be such as he
had just described. When he says that God is king for ever, we are to
remember at the same time the purpose for which he reigns — taking our
definition of it from the preceding ascription’s. It follows that,
whether living or dying, we shall be safe under the keeping of a king
who reigns expressly for our salvation. Had he said no more than that
Jehovah reigned for ever, we would have been ready to object the
distance between us and his inconceivable greatness. He states,
therefore, in express terms, his being bound by sacred covenant to his
chosen people.

id="xxx-p1.2"></span>

<span id="xxx-p2"></span> In the original Hebrew and in the Chaldee
paraphrase, no author’s name is prefixed to this Psalm: in the
Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate, AEthiopic, and Arabic versions it is
ascribed to Haggai and Zechariah. Upon the supposition that it was
written by these Prophets its composition would be after the captivity;
“and it may refer,” says Dr. Adam Clarke, “to the time when Cyrus,
prejudiced by the enemies of the Jews, withdrew his order for the
rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem, to which revocation of the royal
edict the <span id="xxx-p2.1"></span>[Ps
146:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#003.md)<span id="xxx-p2.1"></span> may
refer, ‘Put not your trust in princes,’ etc.” Horsley, proceeding on the
same view, entitles it, “A thanksgiving of the returning captives.”
There is, however, nothing in it which prohibits us from looking upon it
as a Psalm of David.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[285](cc12029.htm#fr_284.md) <span
id="xxx.i-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p3"></span> Horsley prefers translating “his false
deceitful show,” instead of “his thoughts.” He observes, that the
original word is literally “his glitterings.” Parkhurst would render the
original word “splendours, glories,” “which,” says he, “makes an
excellent sense.”

<span id="fn_285"></span>[286](cc12029.htm#fr_285.md) <span
id="xxx.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.i-p7"></span> That is, with the word “Hallelujah,” the
Hebrew for “Praise Jehovah.” Hence they have been called, “Hallelujah
Psalms.”

<span id="fn_286"></span>[287](cc12029.htm#fr_286.md) <span
id="xxx.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xxx.ii-p3"></span> In our English Bible it is “openeth *the
eyes of* the blind.” From this clause some of the ancients concluded
that the whole of the attributes here enumerated are intended to apply
to Christ. Bishop Horne, and other modern divines, entertain the same
opinion. But though all that is here said may with the strictest truth
be predicated of Christ, the propriety of restricting the interpretation
of the Psalm to him, upon the slender ground specified, may be doubted.
Walford translates this clause — “Jehovah delivereth them that are in
darkness.” “There is no word,” says he, “in Hebrew to correspond with
the ‘eyes’ of the English Bible; and it is more in agreement with the
parallelism of the verse, to understand this clause of persons who are
in distress and adversity, expressed by being in darkness.”

<span id="fn_287"></span>[288](cc12029.htm#fr_287.md) <span
