<span id="xxvi-p1"></span>PSALM 142

<span id="xxvi-p2"></span>When Saul came into the cave where David lay
concealed, this saint of God might upon such an occurrence have been
either thrown into consternation, or led by his alarm into some
unwarrantable step, it being common for persons in despair either to be
prostrated with dismay, or driven into frenzy. But it appears from this
Psalm that David retained his composure, relying with assured confidence
upon God, and resigning himself to vows and prayers instead of taking
any unauthorized steps.

<span id="xxvi-p3"></span>A Prayer of David, giving instruction when he
was in the cave.  <span id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md)

<span id="xxvi.i"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p1"></span><span id="xxvi.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
142:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#001.md)<span id="xxvi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p2"></span>**1.** I cried to Jehovah with my voice,
with my voice to Jehovah I made supplication. **2.** I pour out my
meditation before his face: I tell my affliction before his face. **3.**
When my spirit was perplexed within me, and thou knewest my path: in the
way wherein I walked they laid a snare for me. **4.** On looking to the
right hand, and perceiving, none would know me, refuge failed me, there
was none seeking after my soul.

<span id="xxvi.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxvi.i-p4"></span><span id="xxvi.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p5"></span>**1.** *I cried*  <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) *to Jehovah*, *etc*. It showed
singular presence of mind in David that he was not paralyzed with fear,
or that he did not in a paroxysm of fury take vengeance upon his enemy,
as he easily might have done; and that he was not actuated by despair to
take away his life, but composedly addressed himself to the exercise of
prayer. There was good reason why the title should have been affixed to
the Psalm to note this circumstance, and David had good grounds for
mentioning how he commended himself to God. Surrounded by the army of
Saul, and hemmed in by destruction on every side, how was it possible
for him to have spared so implacable an enemy, had he not been fortified
against the strongest temptations by prayer? The repetition he makes use
of indicates his having prayed with earnestness, so as to be impervious
to every assault of temptation.

<span id="xxvi.i-p7"></span>He tells us still more clearly in the next
verse that he disburdened his ears unto God. To pour out one’s thoughts
and tell over his afflictions implies the reverse of those perplexing
anxieties which men brood over inwardly to their own distress, and by
which they torture themselves, and are chafed by their afflictions
rather than led to God; or it implies the reverse of those frantic
exclamations to which others give utterance who find no comfort in the
superintending providence and care of God. In short, we are left to
infer that while he did not give way before men to loud and senseless
lamentations, neither did he suffer himself to be tormented with inward
and suppressed cares, but made known his grief’s with unsuspecting
confidence to the Lord.

<span id="xxvi.i-p8"></span><span id="xxvi.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p9"></span>**3.** *When, my spirit*, *etc*. Though he
owns here that he felt anxiety, yet he confirms what he had said as to
the constancy of his faith. The figure which he uses of his spirit being
*perplexed*,  <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) aptly represents
the state of the mind in alternating between various resolutions when
there was no apparent outgate from danger, and increasing its distress
by resorting to all kinds of devices. He adds, that though there was no
apparent way of safety, God knew from the beginning in what way his
deliverance should be effected. Others put a different meaning upon this
clause, *thou knowest my way,* as if David asserted God to have been
witness of his integrity, but the other is the more correct, that God
knew the way to deliver him, while his own mind was distracted by a
variety of thoughts, and yet could not conceive any mode of extrication.
The words teach us, when we have tried every remedy and know not what to
do, to rest satisfied with the conviction that God is acquainted with
our afflictions, and condescends to care for us, as Abraham said —

<span id="xxvi.i-p11"></span>“The Lord will provide.” (<span
id="xxvi.i-p11.1"></span>[Ge 22:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#008.md)<span
id="xxvi.i-p11.1"></span>.)

<span id="xxvi.i-p12"></span><span id="xxvi.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p13"></span>**4.** *On looking to the right hand*,
 <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) *etc*., He shows that there was
good cause for the dreadful sufferings he experienced, since no human
aid or comfort was to be expected, and destruction seemed inevitable.
When he speaks of having looked and yet not perceived a friend amongst
men, he does not mean that he had turned his thoughts to earthly helps
in forgetfulness of God, but that he had made such inquiry as was
warrantable after one on the earth who might assist him. Had any person
of the kind presented himself, he would no doubt have recognized him as
an instrument in the hand of God’s mercy, but it was God’s purpose that
he should be abandoned of all assistance from man, and that his
deliverance from destruction should thus appear more extraordinary. In
the expression, *none seeking after my soul*, the verb to *seek after*
is used in a good sense, for being solicitous about any man’s welfare or
safety.

<span id="xxvi.ii"></span>

<span id="xxvi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxvi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
142:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#005.md)<span id="xxvi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.ii-p2"></span>**5.** I cried unto thee, O Jehovah! I said
thou art my hope and my portion in the land of the living. **6.** Attend
unto my cry, for I labor very much under affliction: deliver me from my
persecutors, for they are stronger than I. **7.** Rescue my soul from
prison, that I may praise thy name; the righteous shall crown me, for
thou wilt recompense me.

<span id="xxvi.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxvi.ii-p4"></span><span id="xxvi.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.ii-p5"></span>**5.** *I cried unto thee, O Jehovah*! With
a view to hasten God’s interposition, David complains of the low estate
he was reduced to, and of his extremity; the term cry denoting
vehemence, as I have elsewhere noticed. He speaks of deliverance as
being plainly needed, since he was now held a prisoner. By *prison* some
suppose he alludes to the cave where he was lodged, but this is too
restricted a meaning. The subsequent clause, *the righteous shall
compass me*, is translated differently by some, *they shall wait me*. I
have retained the true and natural sense. I grant that it is taken
figuratively for surrounding, intimating that he would be a spectacle to
all, the eyes of men being attracted by such a singular case of
deliverance. If any consider the words not to be figurative, the sense
will be, That the righteous would not only congratulate him, but place a
crown upon his head in token of victory. Some explain the passage, They
will assemble to congratulate me, and will stand round me on every side
like a crown. As the words literally read, *they will crown* upon me,
some supply another pronoun, and give this sense, that the righteous
would construe the mercy bestowed upon David as a glory conferred upon
themselves; for when God delivers any of his children he holds out the
prospect of deliverance to the rest, and, as it were, gifts them with a
crown. The sense which I have adopted is the simplest, however, That the
mercy vouchsafed would be shown conspicuously to all as in a theater,
proving a signal example to the righteous for establishment of their
faith. The verb <span id="xxvi.ii-p5.1"></span>גמל, *gamal*, in the
Hebrew, is of a more general signification than to repay, and means *to
confer a benefit*, as I have shown elsewhere.

<span id="xxvi-p4"></span> In the history of David we read particularly
of the two caves in which he took shelter, that of Adullam, (<span
id="xxvi-p4.1"></span>[1Sa 22:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1022.htm#001.md)<span
id="xxvi-p4.1"></span>,) and that of En-gedi, (<span
id="xxvi-p4.2"></span>[1Sa 24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#003.md)<span
id="xxvi-p4.2"></span>.) The latter is generally supposed to be the cave
here

<span id="fn_244"></span>[245](cc12025.htm#fr_244.md) <span
id="xxvi.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p6"></span> In the Hebrew the verb is in the future —
“I will cry;” but as that language has no present tense, it frequently
uses for it the past and future promiscuously. Bishop Horne, therefore,
renders in the present all the verbs in this Psalm, which Calvin
translates in the past, except the verbs in the two first verses, which
he renders in the future. Translators, however, in general concur with
Calvin, and we think justly, the Psalm, as we conceive, being a
recollection of the substance of the prayers he addressed to God while
in the cave of En-gedi, but which it cannot be supposed he had then an
opportunity of committing to writing.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[246](cc12025.htm#fr_245.md) <span
id="xxvi.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p10"></span> “<span id="xxvi.i-p10.1"></span>Or c’est
une belle similitude quand il dit que son esprit a este en tortille et
enveloppe,” etc. — *Fr*.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[247](cc12025.htm#fr_246.md) <span
id="xxvi.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p14"></span> The allusion here, it is supposed, is to
the observances of the ancient Jewish courts of judicature, in which the
advocate, as well as the accuser, stood on the *right hand* of the
accused. (<span id="xxvi.i-p14.1"></span>[Ps
109:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa109.htm#005)<span id="xxvi.i-p14.1"></span>..md)
The Psalmist felt himself in the condition of one who had nobody to
plead his cause, and to protect him in the dangerous circumstances in
which he was placed.
