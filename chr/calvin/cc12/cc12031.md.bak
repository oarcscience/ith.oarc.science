<span id="xxxii-p1"></span>PSALM 148

<span id="xxxii-p2"></span>The more effectually to express how worthy
God is to be praised in his works, he calls upon all creatures from
above and below to sing his praises. He begins with angels, but
immediately proceeds to address the brute creation and dumb elements,
intimating, that there is no part of the world in which the praises of
God are not to be heard, inasmuch as he everywhere gives proof of his
power, goodness, and wisdom. He then comes to speak of men, whom God has
constituted the proper heralds of his praises in this world. But as the
unbelieving portion of them is both blind to the consideration of God’s
works, and dumb to his praises, the Psalmist at the close appeals to the
children of Israel, who were privileged with a special discovery of God,
as principal witnesses.  <span id="fr_295"></span>[296](#fn_295.md)

<span id="xxxii-p4"></span>Hallelujah.

<span id="xxxii.i"></span>

<span id="xxxii.i-p1"></span><span id="xxxii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
148:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#001.md)<span id="xxxii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxxii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens,
praise him in the heights. **2.** Praise him, all ye his angels; praise
him, all ye his armies. **3.** Praise him, ye sun and moon; praise him,
ye shining stars. **4.** Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye
waters above the heavens. **5.** Let them praise the name of Jehovah;
for he commanded, and they were created. **6.** And he established them
for ever; he hath set for them a decree for ever, and it shall not pass
beyond.

<span id="xxxii.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxxii.i-p4"></span><span id="xxxii.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxxii.i-p5"></span>**1.** *Praise Jehovah from the heavens* He
seems here to include the stars as well as the angels, and, therefore,
heaven itself, the air, and all that is gendered in it; for afterwards a
division is made when he first calls upon angels, then upon the stars,
and the waters of the firmament. With regard to the angels, created as
they were for this very end — that they might be instant in this
religious service, we need not wonder that they should be placed first
in order when the praises of God are spoken of. Accordingly, in that
remarkable vision which Isaiah describes, (<span
id="xxxii.i-p5.1"></span>[Isa 6:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#003.md)<span
id="xxxii.i-p5.1"></span>,) the cherubim cry out — “Holy, holy, holy,
Lord God of Hosts.” And in several other places of Scripture the angels
are represented as praising God by such ascription’s. How, then, can
zeal like theirs stand in need of exhortations? Or, if they require to
be incited, what can be more unseemly than that we, who are so sluggish
in the service, should assume the part of exhorting them to their duty?
David, then, who did not equal the angels in zeal, but came far behind
them, was not qualified to be an exhorter to them. But neither did this
enter into his purpose; he would simply testify that it was the height
of his happiness and desire to join in sacred concert with elect angels
in praising God. And there is nothing unreasonable that, in order to
stir himself up in the praises of God, he should call as companions upon
the angels, although these run spontaneously in the service, and are
fitter to lead the way. He calls them, in the second part of the verse —
*the armies of God;* for they stand always ready to receive his orders.
“Ten thousand times ten thousand surround his throne,” as Daniel says,
(<span id="xxxii.i-p5.2"></span>[Da
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010)<span id="xxxii.i-p5.2"></span>..md)
The same name is applied also to the stars, both because they are
remarkable for the order which maintains among them, and because they
execute with inconceivable quickness the orders of God. But the angels
are here called armies, upon the same account as elsewhere
principalities and powers, inasmuch as God exerts his power by their
hands.

<span id="xxxii.i-p6"></span><span id="xxxii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxxii.i-p7"></span>**3.** *Praise him, ye sun and moon* This
passage gives no countenance to the dream of Plato, that the stars excel
in sense and intelligence. Nor does the Psalmist give them the same
place as he had just assigned to angels, but merely intimates that the
glory of God is everywhere to be seen, as if they sang his praises with
an audible voice. And here he tacitly reproves the ingratitude of man;
for all would hear this symphony, were they at all attent upon
considering the works of God. For doth not the sun by his light, and
heat, and other marvelous effects, praise his Maker? The stars when they
run their course, and at once adorn the heavens and give light to the
earth, do they not sound the praises of God? but as we are deaf and
insensible, the Psalmist calls upon them as witnesses to reprove our
indolence. By the *heavens of heavens* he no doubt means the spheres.
Eclipses, and other things which we observe, plainly show both that the
fixed stars are above the planets, and that the planets themselves are
placed in different orbits.  <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) The
excellency of this contrivance the Psalmist justly commends, speaking
expressly of the heavens of heavens; not as if there were really more
heavens than one, but to extol the matchless wisdom which God has shown
in creating the heavens; for the sun, moon, and stars are not confusedly
mixed together, but each has its own position and station assigned to
it, and their manifold courses are all regulated. As under the name of
*the heavens* he comprehends the air, or at least all the space from the
middle region of the air upwards, he calls rains, *the waters above the
heavens* There is no foundation for the conjecture which some have made,
that there are waters deposited above the four elements; and when the
Psalmist speaks of these waters as being above, he clearly points at the
descent of the rain. It is adhering too strictly to the letter of the
words employed, to conceive as if there were some sea up in the heavens,
where the waters were permanently deposited; for we know that Moses and
the Prophets ordinarily speak in a popular style, suited to the lowest
apprehension. It would be absurd, then, to seek to reduce what they say
to the rules of philosophy; as, for example, in the passage before us,
the Psalmist notes the marvelous fact that God holds the waters
suspended in the air, because it seems contrary to nature that they
should mount aloft, and also, that though fluid they should hang in
vacant space. Accordingly it is said elsewhere, that they are held there
as enclosed in bottles. (<span id="xxxii.i-p8.2"></span>[Ps
33:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#007)<span id="xxxii.i-p8.2"></span>..md)
The Psalmist has borrowed the form of expression from Moses, who says —
“that the waters were divided from the waters.” (<span
id="xxxii.i-p8.3"></span>[Ge 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#006.md)<span
id="xxxii.i-p8.3"></span>.)

<span id="xxxii.i-p9"></span><span id="xxxii.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxxii.i-p10"></span>**5.** *Let them praise the name*, *etc*.
As he speaks of things wanting intelligence, he passes to the third
person, from which we infer that his reason for having spoken in the
second person hitherto, was to make a deeper impression upon men. And he
asks no other praise than that which may teach us that the stars did not
make themselves, nor the rains spring from chance; for notwithstanding
the signal proofs we constantly have before our eyes of the divine
power, we with shameful carelessness overlook the great author. He says
emphatically — *for He Himself created,* intimating that the world is
not eternal, as wicked men conjecture, nor made by a concourse of atoms,
but that this fair order of things which we see, suddenly sprang forth
upon the commandment of God. And, speaking of the creation, he adds what
is even more worthy of observation, that he gave that law to them which
remains inviolable. For many, while they grant that the world was made
by God, lapse from this into the senseless notion that now the order of
nature stands of itself, and that God sits idle in the heavens. The
Psalmist very properly insists, therefore, that the works of God above
us in the heavens were not only made by him, but even now move forward
at his disposal; and that not only was a secret power communicated to
them at first, but while they go through their assigned parts, their
operation and ministry to their various ends is dependent upon God.

<span id="xxxii.ii"></span>

<span id="xxxii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxxii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
148:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#007.md)<span
id="xxxii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxxii.ii-p2"></span>**7.** Praise Jehovah! ye creatures from
the earth,  <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) dragons,  <span
id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) and all deeps. **8.** Fire and hail,
snow and ice, breath of the storm doing his word. **9.** Mountains, and
all hills; fruitful tree, and all cedars. **10.** Wild beasts, and all
cattle; reptile, and winged fowl.

<span id="xxxii.ii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxxii.ii-p6"></span><span id="xxxii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxxii.ii-p7"></span>**7.** *Praise Jehovah*, *etc*. He now
comes to the lower parts of the world; although deviating at the same
time from the exact order, he mixes up such things as are produced in
the air — lightning’s, snow, ice, and storms. These should rather have
been placed among the former class, but he has respect to the common
apprehension of men. The scope of the whole is, that wherever we turn
our eyes we meet with evidences of the power of God. He speaks first of
*the whales*; for, as he mentions the *abysses* or *deeps* immediately
afterwards, I have no doubt that by <span
id="xxxii.ii-p7.1"></span>תנינים, *tanninim*, he means fishes of the
sea, such as whales. It is only reasonable to think that matter for
praising God should be taken from the sea, which is fraught with so many
wonders. He then ascends to *hail, snows*, and *storms*, which he says
*fulfill the word of God*; for it is not by an effect of chance that the
heavens are clouded, or that a single drop of rain falls from the
clouds, or that the thunders rage, but one and all of these changes
depend upon the secret will of God, whether he will show his goodness to
the children of men in irrigating the earth, or punish their sins by
tempest, hail, or other calamities. The passage contains instruction of
various kinds, as, for example, that when dearth impends, however
parched the earth may be by long continued heat, God can promptly send
rain which will remove the drought at his pleasure. If from incessant
rains, on the other hand, the seed rot in the ground, or the crops do
not come to maturity, we should pray for fair weather. If we are alarmed
by thunder, we are taught to pray to God, for as it is he who sends it
in his anger, so he can still all the troubled elements. And we are not
to take up the narrow view of this truth which irreligious men advocate,
that things in nature merely move according to the laws impressed upon
them from the beginning, while God stands by idle, but are to hold
firmly that God watches over his creatures, and that nothing can take
place without his present disposal, as we have seen, <span
id="xxxii.ii-p7.2"></span>[Ps
104:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004.md)<span id="xxxii.ii-p7.2"></span>
that

<span id="xxxii.ii-p8"></span>“he maketh the winds his messengers,  
and his ministers a flaming fire.”

<span id="xxxii.iii"></span>

<span id="xxxii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xxxii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
148:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/psa148.htm#011.md)<span
id="xxxii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxxii.iii-p2"></span>**11.** Kings of the earth, and all
peoples; princes, and all judges of the earth. **12.** Young men, and
also virgins; old men, with children. **13.** Let them praise the name
of Jehovah: for exalted is his name only, his praise is above the earth
and the heavens. **14.** And he hath exalted the horn of his people:
praise is to all his merciful ones, to the children of Israel, a people
which is near to him. Hallelujah.

<span id="xxxii.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxxii.iii-p4"></span><span id="xxxii.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxxii.iii-p5"></span>**11.** *Kings of the earth*, *etc*. He
now turns his address to men, with a respect to whom it was that he
called for a declaration of God’s praises from creatures, both above and
from beneath. As kings and princes are blinded by the dazzling influence
of their station, so as to think the world was made for them, and to
despise God in the pride of their hearts, he particularly calls them to
this duty; and, by mentioning them first, he reproves their ingratitude
in withholding their tribute of praise when they are under greater
obligations than others. As all men originally stand upon a level as to
condition, the higher persons have risen, and the nearer they have been
brought to God, the more sacredly are they bound to proclaim his
goodness. The more intolerable is the wickedness of kings and princes
who claim exemption from the common rule, when they ought rather to
inculcate it upon others and lead the way. He could have addressed his
exhortation at once summarily to all men, as indeed he mentions
*peoples* in general terms; but by thrice specifying *princes* he
suggests that they are slow to discharge the duty, and need to be urged
do it. Then follows a division according to age and sex, to show that
all without exception are created for this end, and should unitedly
devote their energies to it. As to *old men*, the more God has
lengthened out their lives the more should they be exercised in singing
his praises; but he joins *young men* with them, for though they have
less experience from continued habit, it will be inexcusable if they do
not acknowledge the great mercy of God in the vigor of their lives. In
speaking of *girls* or *virgins*, the particle <span
id="xxxii.iii-p5.1"></span>גם, *gam, also*, is not merely expletive, but
added to make the words more emphatical, conveying the truth that even
the young women who are not so liberally educated as the male sex, being
considered as born for domestic offices, will omit their duty if they do
not join with the rest of the Church in praising God. It follows that
all from the least to the greatest are bound by this common rule.

<span id="xxxii.iii-p6"></span><span id="xxxii.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxxii.iii-p7"></span>**14.** *And hath exalted the horn*,
*etc*. As we saw in the former Psalm, that the perfections of God are to
be seen more conspicuously in the Church than in the constitution of the
world at large, the Psalmist has added this sentence, as to the Church
being protected by the divine hand, and armed with a power against all
enemies which secures its safety in every danger. By *the horn*, as is
well known, is meant strength or dignity. Accordingly the Psalmist means
that God’s blessing is apparent in his Church and among his chosen
people, inasmuch as it only flourishes and is powerful through his
strength. There is a tacit comparison implied between the Church of God
and other hostile powers, for it needs divine guardianship as being
exposed on all sides to attack. Hence the Psalmist infers that *praise
is to all the merciful ones of God*, for they have ground given them in
the singular goodness of his condescension both for self-congratulation
and praise. In calling the children of Israel *a people near unto God,*
he reminds them of the gracious covenant which God made with Abraham.
For how came the nearness, except in the way of God’s preferring an
unknown despised stranger to all nations? Nor are we to seek the cause
of the distinction elsewhere than in the mere love of God. Though all
the world equally belongs to God, he graciously discovered himself to
the children of Israel, and brought them near to him, strangers as they
were from God, even as are the whole race of Adam. Hence the words of
Moses —

<span id="xxxii.iii-p8"></span>“When the Most High divided to the
nations their inheritance, and distributed the peoples, he stretched
forth his line to Jacob.” (<span id="xxxii.iii-p8.1"></span>[De
32:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#008.md)<span
id="xxxii.iii-p8.1"></span>.)

<span id="xxxii.iii-p9"></span>He is to be considered, therefore, as
pointing out the cause why God hath extended such signal blessings to a
single people, and a people poor and despised — his adoption of them to
himself.
