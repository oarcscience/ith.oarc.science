<span id="xxii-p1"></span>PSALM 138

<span id="xxii-p2"></span>In this Psalm David, in remembrance of the
singular help which had always been vouchsafed him by God — the
experience he had enjoyed of his faithfulness and goodness, takes
occasion to stir himself up to gratitude; and from what he had known of
the divine faithfulness, he anticipates a continuance of the same mercy.
If dangers must be met, he confidently looks for a happy issue.

<span id="xxii-p3"></span>A Psalm of David.

<span id="xxii.i"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p1"></span><span id="xxii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
138:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#001.md)<span id="xxii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p2"></span>**1.** I will praise thee  <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) with my whole heart, before the gods
 <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) will I sing psalms to thee.
**2.** I will worship thee towards the temple of thy holiness, and sing
unto thy name for thy mercy and for thy truth; for thou hast magnified
thy name above all things by thy word. **3.** In the day when I cried to
thee then thou answeredst me, and hast abundantly ministered strength to
me in my soul. **4.** Let all kings of the earth praise thee, O Jehovah!
because they have heard the words of thy mouth. **5.** And let theta
sing in  <span id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) the walls of Jehovah,
for great is the glory of Jehovah.

<span id="xxii.i-p6"></span> 

<span id="xxii.i-p7"></span><span id="xxii.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p8"></span>**1.** *I will praise thee with my whole
heart* As David had been honored to receive distinguishing marks of the
divine favor, he declares his resolution to show more than ordinary
gratitude. This is exercise which degenerates and is degraded in the
case of hypocrites to a mere sound of empty words, but he states that he
would return thanks to God not with the lips only, but with sincerity of
heart, for by the *whole heart,* as we have elsewhere seen, is meant a
heart which is sincere and not double. The noun <span
id="xxii.i-p8.1"></span>אלהים, *Elohim,* sometimes means *angels,* and
sometimes *kings,* and either meaning will suit with the passage before
us. The praise David speaks of is that which is of a public kind. The
solemn assembly is, so to speak, a heavenly theater, graced by the
presence of attending angels; and one reason why the cherubim
overshadowed the Ark of the Covenant was to let God’s people know that
the angels are present when they come to worship in the sanctuary. We
might very properly apply what is said here to *kings,* on account of
their eminence in rank, as in <span id="xxii.i-p8.2"></span>[Ps
107:32](../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#032.md)<span id="xxii.i-p8.2"></span>,
“Praise ye the Lord in the assembly of the elders” — that is, as we
should say, in an assembly of an honored and illustrious kind. But I
prefer the former sense, and this because believers in drawing near to
God are withdrawn from the world, and rise to heaven in the enjoyment of
fellowship with angels, so that we find Paul enforcing his address to
the Corinthians upon the necessity of decency and order, by requiring
them to show some respect at least in their public religious assemblies
to the angels. (<span id="xxii.i-p8.3"></span>[1Co
11:10](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#010)<span id="xxii.i-p8.3"></span>..md)
The same thing was represented by God long before, under the figure of
the cherubim, thus giving his people a visible pledge of his presence.

<span id="xxii.i-p9"></span><span id="xxii.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p10"></span>**2.** *I will worship towards the temple*
 <span id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) *of thy holiness. H*e intimates
that he would show more than private gratitude, and, in order to set an
example before others, come in compliance with the precept of the law
into the sanctuary. He worshipped God spiritually, and yet would lift
his eyes to those outward symbols which were the means then appointed
for drawing the minds of God’s people upwards. He singles out the divine
mercy and truth as the subject of his praise, for while the power and
greatness of God are equally worthy of commendation, nothing has a more
sensible influence in stimulating us to thanksgiving than his free
mercy; and in communicating to us of his goodness he opens our mouth to
sing his praises. As we cannot taste, or at least have any lively
apprehensions in our souls of the divine mercy otherwise than through
the word, mention is made of his faithfulness or truth. This coupling of
mercy with truth is to be particularly taken notice of, as I have
frequently observed, for however much the goodness of God may appear to
us in its effects, such is our insensibility that it will never
penetrate our minds, unless the word have come to us in the first place.
Goodness is first mentioned, because the only ground upon which God
shows himself to us as true is his having bound himself by his free
promise. And it is in this that his unspeakable mercy shows itself —
that he prevents those with it who were at a distance from him, and
invites them to draw near to him by condescending to address them in a
familiar manner. In the end of the verse some supply the copulative, and
read — *Thou hast magnified thy name and thy word above all things*
 <span id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) This learned interpreters have
rejected as a meagre rendering, and yet have themselves had recourse to
what I consider a forced interpretation*, Thou hast magnified thy name
above all thy word* I am satisfied David means to declare that God’s
name is exalted above all things, specifying the particular manner in
which he has exalted his name, by faithfully performing his free
promises. Nor can any doubt that owing to our blind insensibility to the
benefits which God bestows upon us, the best way in which he can awaken
us to the right notice of them is by first addressing his word to us.
and then certifying and sealing his goodness by accomplishing what he
has promised.

<span id="xxii.i-p13"></span><span id="xxii.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p14"></span>**3.** *In the day when I cried to thee,*
etc. Frequently God prevents our prayers, and surprises us, as it were,
sleeping: but commonly he stirs us up to prayer by the influence of his
Spirit, and this to illustrate his goodness the more by our finding that
he crowns our prayers with success. David well infers that his escape
front danger could not have been merely fortuitous, as it plainly
appeared that God had answered him. This then is one thing noticeable,
that our prayers more nearly discover his goodness to us. Some supply a
copulative in the second part of the verse — Thou *hast increased me,
and in my soul is strength.* But this is not called for, since the words
read well enough as they stand, whether we render the passage as I have
done above, or translate it, *Thou hast multiplied,* or *increased, me
with strength in my soul.* The sense, is, That from a weak and afflicted
state he had received fresh strength to his spirit Or some may, perhaps,
prefer resolving it thus: Thou hast multiplied — that is, blest me,
whence strength in my soul.

<span id="xxii.i-p15"></span><span id="xxii.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p16"></span>**4.** *Let all kings of the earth praise
thee* Here he declares that the goodness he had experienced would be
extensively known, and the report of it spread over all the world. In
saying that even kings had heard the words of God’s mouth, he does not
mean to aver that they had been taught in the true religion so as to be
prepared for becoming members of the Church, but only that it would be
well known everywhere that the reason of his having been preserved in
such a wonderful manner was God’s having anointed him king by his
commandment.  <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) Thus although the
neighboring kings reaped no advantage by that divine oracle, the
goodness of God was illustrated by its being universally known, by his
being called to the throne in an extraordinary manner. Having uniformly
during the whole period of Saul’s severe and bloody persecution declared
that he raised his standard in God’s name, there could be no doubt that
he came to the crown by divine will and commandment. And this was a
proof of divine goodness which might draw forth an acknowledgment even
from heathen kings.

<span id="xxii.ii"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
138:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#006.md)<span id="xxii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p2"></span>**6.** Because Jehovah the exalted will yet
have respect to the lowly, and being high will know afar off, \[or, will
know afar off him that is high.\] **7.** Should I will  <span
id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) in the midst of trouble thou wilt
revive me: thou wilt put forth thy hand against the wrath of mine
enemies, and thy right hand shall save me. **8.** Jehovah will
recompense upon me.  <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) thy mercy,
O Jehovah! is for ever; thou wilt not forsake the works of thine own
hand.

<span id="xxii.ii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxii.ii-p6"></span><span id="xxii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p7"></span>**6.** *Because Jehovah the exalted,* etc.
In this verse he passes commendation upon God’s general government of
the world. The thing of all others most necessary to be known is, that
he is not indifferent to our safety; for though in words we are all
ready to grant this, our disbelief of it is shown by the feat’ we betray
upon the slightest appearance of danger, and we would not give way to
such alarm if we had a solid persuasion of our being under his fatherly
protection. Some read, *Jehovah on high,* that is, he sits on his
heavenly throne governing the world; but I prefer considering, that
there is an opposition intended — that the greatness of God does not
prevent his having’ respect to the poor and humble ones of the earth.
This is confirmed by what is stated in the second clause, That being
highly exalted he recognises afar off, or from a distance. Some read
<span id="xxii.ii-p7.1"></span>גבה, *gabah,* in the accusative case, and
this gives a meaning to the words which answers well to the context,
That God does not honor the high and haughty by looking near to them —
that he despises them — while, with regard to the poor and humble, who
might seem to be at a great distance from him, he takes care of them, as
if they were near to him. By some the verb <span
id="xxii.ii-p7.2"></span>ידע, *yada,* is rendered, *to crush,* and they
take the meaning to be, that God, while he favors the lowly, treads down
the mighty who glory in their prosperity. There is reason to doubt,
however, whether any such refinement of meaning is to be attached to
David’s words, and it is enough to conclude, that he here repeats the
same sentiment formerly expressed, that God though highly exalted, takes
notice of what might be thought to escape his observation. Thus we have
seen, (<span id="xxii.ii-p7.3"></span>[Ps
113:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#006)<span id="xxii.ii-p7.3"></span>,.md)

<span id="xxii.ii-p8"></span>“The Lord dwelleth on high, yet he humbleth
himself to behold both the things that are in heaven and on earth.”

<span id="xxii.ii-p9"></span>The meaning is, that though God’s glory is
far above all heavens, the distance at which he is placed does not
prevent his governing the world by his providence. God is highly
exalted, but he sees after off, so that he needs not change place when
he would condescend to take care of us. We on our part are poor and
lowly, but our wretched condition is; no reason why God will not concern
himself about us. While we view with admiration the immensity of his
glory as raised above all heavens, we must not disbelieve his
willingness to foster us under his fatherly care. The two things are,
with great propriety, conjoined here by David, that, on the one hand,
when we think of God’s majesty we should not be terrified into a
forgetfulness of his goodness and benignity, nor, on the other, lose our
reverence for his majesty in contemplating the condescension of his
mercy.  <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md)

<span id="xxii.ii-p11"></span><span id="xxii.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p12"></span>**7.** *Should I walk in the midst of
trouble, etc.* Here David declares the sense in which he looked flint
God would act the part of his preserver — by giving him life from the
dead, were that necessary. The passage is well deserving our attention
for by nature we are so delicately averse to suffering as to wish that
we might all live safely beyond shot of its arrows, and shrink from
close contact with the fear of death, as something altogether
intolerable. On the slightest approach of danger we are immoderately
afraid, as if our emergencies precluded the hope of Divine deliverance.
This is faith’s true office, to see life in the midst of death, and to
trust the mercy of God — not as that which will procure us universal
exemption from evil, but as that which will quicken us in the midst of
death every moment of our lives; for God humbles his children under
various trials, that his defense of them may be the more remarkable, and
that he may show himself to be their deliverer, as well as their
preserver. In the world believers are constantly exposed to enemies, and
David asserts, that he will be safe under God’s protection from all
their machinations. He declares his hope of life to lie in this, that
the hand of God was stretched out for his help, that hand which he knew
to be invincible, and victorious over *every* foe. And from all this we
are taught, that it is God’s method to exercise his children with a
continual conflict, that, having one foot as it were in the grave, they
may flee with alarm to hide themselves under his wings, where they malt
abide in peace. Some translate the particle <span
id="xxii.ii-p12.1"></span>אף, *aph, also,* instead of *anger,* reading —
*thou wilt also extend over mine; enemies,* etc. But I have followed the
more commonly received sense, as both fuller and more natural.

<span id="xxii.ii-p13"></span><span id="xxii.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii-p14"></span>**8.** *Jehovah will recompense upon me,
etc*. The doubtfulness which attaches to the meaning of the verb <span
id="xxii.ii-p14.1"></span>גמר, *gamar,* throws an uncertainty over the
whole sentence. Sometimes it signifies *to repay,* and, in general, *to
bestow,* for it is often applied to free favors.  <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) Yet the context would seem to
require.another sense, since, when it is added as a reason, *that
Jehovah’s mercy is everlasting, and that he will not forsake the works
of his hands,* the better sense would seem to be — *Jehovah will perform
for me,* that is, will continue to show that he cares for my safety, and
will fully perfect what he has begun. Having once been delivered by an
act of Divine mercy, he concludes that what had been done would be
perfected, as God’s nature is unchangeable, and he cannot divest himself
of that goodness which belongs to him. There can be no doubt that the
way to maintain good hope in danger is to fix our eyes upon the Divine
goodness, on which our deliverance rests. God is under no obligation on
his part, but when, of his mere good pleasure, he promises to interest
himself in our behalf. David concludes with the best reason, from the
eternity of the Divine goodness, that the salvation granted him would be
of no limited and merely evanescent character. This he confirms still
farther by what he adds, that it is impossible God should leave his
work, as men may do, in an imperfect or unfinished state through
lassitude or disgust. This David is to be understood as asserting in the
same sense in which Paul declares, that “the gifts and calling of God
are without repentance.” (<span id="xxii.ii-p15.2"></span>[Ro
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md)<span
id="xxii.ii-p15.2"></span>.) Men may leave off a work for very slight
reasons which they foolishly undertook from the first, and from which
they may have been diverted through their inconstancy, or they may be
forced to give up through inability what they enterprised above their
strength; but nothing of this kind can happen with God, and, therefore,
we have no occasion to apprehend that our hopes will be disappointed in
their course towards fulfillment. Nothing but sin and ingratitude on our
part interrupts the continued and unvarying tenor of the Divine
goodness. What we firmly apprehend by our faith God will never take from
us, or allow to pass out of our hands. When he declares that God
perfects the salvation of his people, David would not encourage sloth,
but strengthen his faith and quicken himself to the exercise of prayer.
What is the cause of that anxiety and fear which are felt by the godly,
but the consciousness of their own weakness and entire dependence upon
God? At the same time they rely with full certainty upon the grace of
God, “being confident,” as Paul writes to the Philippians,

<span id="xxii.ii-p16"></span>“that he who has begun the good work will
perform it till the day of Christ Jesus.” (<span
id="xxii.ii-p16.1"></span>[Php
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006)<span id="xxii.ii-p16.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xxii.ii-p17"></span>The use to be made of the doctrine is, to
remember, when we fall or are disposed to waver in our minds, that since
God has wrought the beginning of our salvation in us, he will carry it
forward to its termination. Accordingly, we should betake ourselves to
prayer, that we may not, through our own indolence, bar our access to
that continuous stream of the divine goodness which flows from a
fountain that is inexhaustible.

id="xxii.i-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p3"></span> Here “O Jehovah” is to be understood.
Though it is not in the received Hebrew text, it was found in six copies
examined by Dr. Kennicott, and in eight examined by De Rossi. The
Septuagint, Arabic, Vulgate, and AEthiopic versions add” Jehovah” after
the verb for “praise.” “The omission of the Divine name,” says Jebb, in
his Translation of the Psalms, “in a passage like this, at the beginning
of the Psalm, is altogether unexampled.”

<span id="fn_189"></span>[190](cc12021.htm#fr_189.md) <span
id="xxii.i-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p4"></span> By the Hebrew word <span
id="xxii.i-p4.1"></span>אלהים, *Elohim,* translated *gods,* Calvin
understands “angels” or “kings,” but particularly the former. It is
however proper to observe that <span id="xxii.i-p4.2"></span>אלהים,
*Elohim,* is one of the names applied to the Supreme Being in the sacred
volume, and therefore some critics translate “before God,” which they
explain as meaning “before the ark,” where were the sacred symbols of
his presence. If after the Hebrew word for “before,” we should suppose
“thee” to be understood, the reading would be “before thee, *or* in thy
presence, O God! will I sing praise unto thee.”

<span id="fn_190"></span>[191](cc12021.htm#fr_190.md) <span
id="xxii.i-p4.3"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p5"></span> Phillips observes that the force of <span
id="xxii.i-p5.1"></span>ב, *beth,* seems to be that of *concerning:* —
“‘The kings of the earth shall sing concerning the ways of the Lord,’
how that they are good and merciful.”

<span id="fn_191"></span>[192](cc12021.htm#fr_191.md) <span
id="xxii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p11"></span> This Psalm is entitled “a Psalm of David,”
and Calvin considers him to be its author agreeably to the title; lint
the mention of “the temple” in the second verse seems to render such an
opinion doubtful. If, however, we translate this word by “mansion,”
which is the proper rendering of the original — “the mansion of thy
sanctity:” this objection to its composition by David falls to the
ground. In the Septuagint version the title of this Psalm is, “A Psalm
of David; of Haggai and Zechariah, when they were dispersed,” (comp.
<span id="xxii.i-p11.1"></span>[Ezr
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/ezr005.htm#001)<span id="xxii.i-p11.1"></span>.md);
meaning a Psalm of David, used by Haggai and Zechariah.

<span id="xxii.i-p12"></span> According to this mode of rendering the
passage <span id="xxii.i-p12.1"></span>כל, *cal,* the word for *all,* is
independent of <span id="xxii.i-p12.2"></span>שמך, *shimcha,* the word
for *thy name.* But “it has been properly observed by Aben Ezra, that
<span id="xxii.i-p12.3"></span>כל in this case should have a Cholem, and
not a Kametz Chateph, with which it is found in all copies. Besides,
this translation is not supported by any of the ancient versions.” —
