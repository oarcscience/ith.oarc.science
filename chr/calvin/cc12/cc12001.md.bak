<span id="ii-p1"></span>VOLUME FIFTH

<span id="ii-p2"></span>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.

<span id="ii-p3"></span>In bringing to a close his labors on Calvin’s
Commentary On The Psalms, the Editor begs leave to state, that in
addition to the General Index, and the Indices Of Texts Of Scripture,
and of Hebrew Words, originally contemplated, it has been deemed highly
desirable to give at the end of the Commentary a Translation; or
Calvin’s Version Of The, Psalms arranged in parallelisms, together with
a Table Of Those Passages In The Psalms Which Are Quoted In The New
Testament, and a Table Of The Particular Subjects Of Each Psalm,
according to Calvin’s interpretation. These additions, it is hoped, will
be considered as improvements. From the extent to which they have
increased the size of this Volume, it has been found necessary to omit
the Appendix of Additional Criticisms to which reference is made in some
of the footnotes throughout the work.

<span id="ii-p4"></span>To exhibit the Psalms arranged in the metrical
order, was an idea which appears never to have suggested itself to the
mind of Calvin. In his time, indeed, and long after it, the peculiar
character of Hebrew Poetry was not understood. It was not till a recent
period that any steady light was; thrown on the laws of its composition.
A vast amount of learning had indeed been expended on the subject, and a
variety of hypotheses had been suggested by successive writers to
unravel a question so intricate and mysterious; but no satisfactory
result was attained until it was investigated by the learned Bishop
Lowth, to whose genius and erudition we are indebted for the discovery
of this long lost secret. He has proved, with a clearness and force of
evidence which has now commanded universal assent, that Hebrew Poetry
bears no resemblance in its structure to the Poetry of Greece and Rome,
that it has no rhyming termination of lines as in the Poetry of our own
language, and that its peculiar, and perhaps its sole characteristic,
lies in a felicitous arrangement of words into what he denominates
Parallelism. In other words, its leading peculiarity is that. each
sentence consists generally of two parts, closely corresponding to each
other, not indeed in the number of syllables, but in the ideas which
they express, or in their grammatical constructive form, the second
being synonymous (or, as Bishop Jebb would denominate it, cognate) with
the first, — or antipathetic to it in its terms and sentiments, — or
similar to it in the form of grammatical construction, such as noun
answering to noun, verb to verb, member to member, negative to negative,
interrogative to interrogative.  <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) The
division of these sacred poems into hemistichs or lines is, therefore,
the form in which they ought naturally to be arranged; and such an
arrangement is attended with great advantages. It exhibits to the eve
the peculiar structure of Hebrew poetical composition, and is, besides,
an important aid in Scriptural Interpretation, as it often contributes
to the elucidation of obscure and difficult passages, and enables even
the mere English reader to discover a thousand beauties, which, without
such a help, would escape his notice.

<span id="ii-p6"></span>In translating this parallel version, two of
Calvin’s translations of the Hebrew text were at the service of the
Editor, — the Latin and the French. The former is strictly literal,
rarely changing the Hebrew idiom, or even inserting a supplementary
term, and uniformly giving the arrangement of the words as they stand in
the inspired original. The latter is also upon the whole literal, though
in some instances it changes the Hebrew idiom into the French, as well
as frequently inserts such supplementary terms as the sense seems to
require; and disregarding the arrangement of the words in the original,
it gives them in the order most suitable to the genius of the French
tongue. The Editor has followed Calvin’s Latin; Version, and has
rendered it literally, retaining the Hebrew modes of expression, and the
arrangement of the words in the sequence of the Hebrew text, except in a
very few instances where a deviation seemed necessary to render the
reading intelligible. Occasionally he has found it necessary to insert
some supplementary words. These, when taken from Calvin’s French
Version, as is generally the case, are printed simply in *italics,* and
when supplied by the Editor are printed in *italics* and enclosed within
brackets. By adhering to the Hebrew order of the words, the arrangements
may sometimes appear harsh and uncouth; but very often they give much
beauty and force to the expression. And in retaining the Hebrew idioms,
the Editor has felt little scruple, considering that as our English
Bible is a literal verbal translation of the Original Hebrew, many of
these are quite familiar to us, and from their peculiar grace have even
become naturalized in our language.

<span id="ii-p7"></span>“The Hebrew idioms,” says Addison, “run into the
English with a peculiar grace and beauty. Our language has received
innumerable elegance’s and improvements from that infusion of Hebraisms
which are derived to it out of the poetical passages in Holy Writ. They
give a force and energy to our expressions, warm and animate our
language, and convey our thoughts in more ardent and intense phrases
than any that are to be met with in our own tongue. There is something
so pathetic in this kind of diction, that it often sets the mind in a
flame, and makes our heart burn within Us.”

<span id="ii-p8"></span>The utility of the two Tables adverted to is too
obvious to require to be dwelt upon. From the former the reader will
perceive how completely the inspiration of the Psalms is established by
New Testament authority, and how highly they were appreciated by Christ
And His Apostles, there being no portion of Old Testament Scripture from
which they so frequently quoted. The other Table will readily serve as a
guide to the selection of such Psalms as may be adapted to the doctrines
of the Christian system, the duties of the Christian life, or the varied
circumstances, whether prosperous or adverse, in which the Christian or
the Church of God may be placed.

<span id="ii-p5"></span> This sentence expresses the three specific
heads into which Lowth discovered Hebrew parallelism, — which involves
in it much variety and many gradations, — may be generally And more
loosely *distributed, Parallels Synonymous,* (or, according to JEBB,
*Parallels Cognate,) Parallels Autithetic, and Parallels Synthetic* or
*Constructive.* For an example of the first, see <span
