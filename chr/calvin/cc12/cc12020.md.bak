<span id="xxi-p1"></span>PSALM 137

<span id="xxi-p2"></span>At the Babylonish captivity the established
order of God’s worship was overthrown, and the Psalmist complains, in
the name of the Church at large, of the taunts which the enemy east upon
the name of God, addressing at the same time a word of comfort to his
people under their captivity, to cheer them with the hope of
deliverance.

<span id="xxi.i"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p1"></span><span id="xxi.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
137:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#001.md)<span id="xxi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p2"></span>**1.** By the rivers of Babylon there we sat
down, we even wept when we remembered thee, O Zion! **2.** We hanged our
harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. **3.** Then they that
carried us away captive required of us the words of a song, and mirth
when we were in suspense, saying, Sing to us one of the songs of Zion.
**4.** How shall we sing Jehovah’s song in a foreign land?

<span id="xxi.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxi.i-p4"></span><span id="xxi.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p5"></span>**1.** *By the rivers of Babylon*  <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) *there we sat down* I have elsewhere
said, that it is a great mistake to suppose that it is David who here
prophetically apprises the people of God of the captivity which should
come upon them. The Prophets in speaking of future events employ very
different language. What is brought under notice is the event as now
historically come, and matter of experience. We shall briefly explain
the scope of the Psalmist. There was danger that the Jews when cast off
in such a melancholy manner should lose hold altogether of their faith
and of their religion. Considering how ready we are, when mixed up with
the wicked and ungodly, to fall into superstition or evil practices, it
was to be feared that they might wax profane amongst the population of
Babylon. The people of the Lord might be thrown into despondency,
besides, by their captivity, the cruel bondage they were subjected to,
and the other indignities which they had to endure. The writer of this
Psalm, whose name is unknown, drew up a form of lamentation, that by
giving expression to their sufferings in sighs and prayers, they might
keep alive the hope of that deliverance which they despaired of. Another
end he has in view, is to warn them against, the decline of godliness in
an irreligious land, and against; defilement with the contaminations of
the heathen. Accordingly he denounces merited judgment upon the children
of Edom, and declares that Babylon, whose prosperity, shortlived as it
was destined to be in itself, eclipsed at that time the rest of the
world, was an object of pity, and near to destruction. The length of
time during which the captivity lasted, may of itself convince us how
useful and even necessary it must have been to support the fainting
minds of God’s people. They must have been ready to acquiesce in the
corrupt practices of the heathen, unless endued with surprising mental
fortitude through a period of seventy years.

<span id="xxi.i-p7"></span>When they are said to have *sat,* this
denotes a continued period of captivity, that they were not only torn
from the sight of their native country, but in a manner buried and
entombed.  <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) The demonstrative
adverb of place, <span id="xxi.i-p10.1"></span>שם*, sham, there,* is
emphatical, setting the subject, as it were, before the eyes of the
reader. Though the pleasantness of the country, irrigated by streams,
might have had an effect in soothing their dejected minds, we are told
that the Lord’s people, so long as they dwelt there, were continually in
tears. The particle <span id="xxi.i-p10.2"></span>גם*, gam, even,* is
used as being intensative, to let us know that the true fearers of the
Lord could not be tempted by all the luxuries of Babylon to forget their
native inheritance. The language is such as to intimate at the same time
that they were not so entirely overwhelmed by their calamities as not to
recognize in them the deserved chatisement of God, and that they were
not chargeable with obstinately struggling against him; for tears are
the expression of humility and penitence, as well as of distress. This
appears still more plainly from its being *Zion* they remembered, which
proves that what had charms for them was not any advantage of a worldly
kind they might there enjoy:, but the worship of God. God had erected
his sanctuary like a flag upon mount Zion, that as often as they looked
to it, they might be assured of his salvation. Fair then and fertile as
was the region where they dwelt, with charms which could corrupt
effeminate minds, and long as they ‘were detained in it, tears, which
are proverbially soon dried up, never ceased to stream from their eyes,
because they were cut off from the worship of God, upon which they ‘were
wont to attend, and felt that they were torn from the inheritance of
promise.

<span id="xxi.i-p11"></span><span id="xxi.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p12"></span>**2.** *We hanged our harps upon the
willows*  <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) He deplores the
suspension of the songs of praise, which God had enjoined in his Temple.
The Levites were set over the department of singing, and led the way
among the people in this devotional exercise. Is it asked how they had
carried their harps with them so far from their native land, we have in
this another proof mentioned by the Psalmist of their faith and fervent
piety, for the Levites when stripped of all their fortunes had preserved
their harps at least as a piece of precious furniture, to be devoted to
a former use when opportunity presented itself. We may suppose that
those who truly feared God put a high value upon the relics of his
worship, and showed the greatest care in preserving them, till the
period of their restoration.  <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md)
When *willows* are mentioned, this denotes the pleasantness of the
banks, which were planted with willows for coolness. But the Psalmist
says that these shades, however delightful, could not dispel a grief
which was too deeply seated to admit of common consolations or
refreshment. As they sat upon the banks of the rivers covered with the
shadows of the trees, this was just the place where they might have been
tempted to take up their harps, and soothe their griefs with song; but
the Psalmist suggests that their minds were too heavily wounded with a
sense of the displeasure of the Lord to deceive themselves with such
idle sources of comfort. He would even go farther, and intimate that joy
of a good and holy kind was at this time suspended. For though it was
neither right nor well judged to encourage their grief, we cannot wonder
if the singing of praises in public was given up till their return from
the captivity, called as they were by the chastisements of God to
mourning and lamentation.

<span id="xxi.i-p15"></span><span id="xxi.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p16"></span>**3.** *Then they that carried us away
captive,* *etc.* We may be certain that the Israelites were treated with
cruel severity under this barbarous tyranny to which they were
subjected. And the worst affliction of all was, that their conquerors
reproachfully insulted them, and even mocked them, their design being
less to wound the hearts of these miserable exiles, than to cast
blasphemies upon their God. The Babylonians had no desire to hear their
sacred songs, and very likely would not have suffered them to engage in
the public praises of God, but they speak ironically, and insinuate it
as a reproach upon the Levites that they should be silent, when it was
their custom formerly to sing sacred songs. Is your God dead, as if they
had said, to whom your praises were formerly addressed? Or if lie
delights in your songs, why do you not sing them? The last clause of the
verse has been variously rendered by interpreters. Some derive <span
id="xxi.i-p16.1"></span>תוללינו, *tholalenu,* from the verb ללי*, yalal,
to howl,* reading — they required mirth *in our howlings.* Others
translate it *suspensions of mirth.*  <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) Some take it for a participle of the
verb <span id="xxi.i-p17.2"></span>הלל*, halal, to rage,* and read,
*raging against us.* But as <span id="xxi.i-p17.3"></span>תלינו*,
talinu,* the root of the noun here employed, is taken in the preceding
verse as meaning *to suspend,* I considered the reading which I have
adopted the simplest one.

<span id="xxi.i-p18"></span><span id="xxi.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p19"></span>**4.** *How shall we sing, etc*. The
Psalmist puts a lofty and magnanimous answer into the mouth of the
Lord’s people to their insolent reproach, which is this, that they
abstained from their songs, as from their legal sacrifices, because the
land where they now were was polluted. The Chaldeans thought the Jews
were bound down permanently to this place of their exile; the Psalmist,
when he calls it *a foreign land,* suggests that it was but the place of
their temporary stay. But the main idea is, that Chaldea was not worthy
of the honor of having God’s praises sung in it. No doubt the children
of God wherever they have lived have always been strangers and
foreigners in the world, but the land of Canaan was the sacred rest
provided for them, and the Psalmist well describes them as being
foreigners and sojourners when they were in other climes. He would in
this way have them to be always ready and prepared for their return,
tacitly enforcing what Jeremiah had prophesied, when, in order to
prevent them from forgetting their native country, he had definitely
foretold the time during which their exile should last, (<span
id="xxi.i-p19.1"></span>[Jer
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md)<span id="xxi.i-p19.1"></span>;
<span id="xxi.i-p19.2"></span>[Jer
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010)<span id="xxi.i-p19.2"></span>..md)
He would in the meantime animate them to constancy, and have them not to
coalesce with the Babylonians through motives of fear. In our own day
under the Papacy, great as the danger may be to which the faithful
expose themselves by not conforming to the example around them, the Holy
Spirit makes use of such a barrier as this to separate them from sinful
compliances.  <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) To those, whether
Frenchmen, Englishmen, or Italians, who love and practice the true
religion, even their native country is a foreign clime when they live
under that tyranny. And yet there is a distinction between us and God’s
ancient people, for at that time the worship of God was confined to one
place, but now he has his Temple wherever two or three are met together
in Christ’s name, if they separate themselves from all idolatrous
profession, and maintain purity of divine worship. The Psalmist by the
language which he employs would by no means put down every attempt on
their part to celebrate God’s praises. He rather exhorts them under
their affliction to wait with patience till the liberty of publicly
worshipping God was restored, saying’ upon the matter — We have been
bereft of our Temple and sacrifices, we wander as exiles in a polluted
land, and what remains but that in remembrance of our outcast state we
should sigh and groan for the promised deliverance.

<span id="xxi.ii"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
137:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#005.md)<span id="xxi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii-p2"></span>**5.** If I shall forget thee, O Jerusalem!
let my right had forget.  <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) **6.**
Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I remember thee not, if
I set not Jerusalem over the head of all my joy. **7.** Remember, O
Jehovah! the children or Edom, in the day of Jerusalem, saying, Lay it
bare, lay it bare even to the foundation thereof. **8.** O daughter of
Babylon laid waste.  <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) happy he
who shall pay thee back the retribution wherewith thou retributedst us!
**9.** Happy he who shall take and dash thy little ones upon the stones.
 <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md)

<span id="xxi.ii-p8"></span> 

<span id="xxi.ii-p9"></span><span id="xxi.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii-p10"></span>**5.** *If I shall forget thee, O
Jerusalem!* This confirms what was said in the former verse, and leaves
us in no difficulty to understand what the Psalmist meant by it. For
here God’s people declare, and with the solemnity of an oath, that the
remembrance of the holy city would be ever engra-yen upon their hearts,
and never, under any circumstances, effaced. Having spoken of song, and
of the instruments of music, the Psalmist’s appeal is made in terms
which corre-spond — that *his hand would forager* its cunning, and *his
tongue cleave to his palate,* or *the roof of his mouth* The meaning’
is, that the Lord’s people, while they mourn under personal trials,
should be still more deeply affected by public calamities which befall
the Church, it being’ reasonable that the zeal of God’s house should
have the highest place in our hearts, and rise above all mere private
considerations. The second part of the sixth verse some interpret — If
this be not my chief joy to see Jerusalem once more in a flourishing
condition. Others — Joy will never enter my heart more, till I be
gladdened by the Church’s restoration. Both meanings are in my opinion
comprehended in the words of the Psalmist. The one cannot be separated
from the other; for if we set Jerusalem above our chiefest joy, the
height of this joy must arise from the consideration of its prosperity,
and, if this be the case, the grief we feel under its calamities will be
such as effectually to shut out all worldly joys.

<span id="xxi.ii-p11"></span><span id="xxi.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii-p12"></span>**7.** *Remember, O Jehovah! the children
of Edom* Vengeance was to be executed upon the other neighboring nations
which had conspired to destroy Jerusalem, so that they are all doubtless
included here under the children of Edom, who are specified, a parr, for
the whole, either because they showed more hatred and cruelty than the
rest, or that theirs were not so easily borne, considering that they
were brethren, and of one blood, being the posterity of Esau, and that
the Israelites had, by God’s commandment, spared the Edomites, when they
devoted all beside them to destruction. (<span
id="xxi.ii-p12.1"></span>[De 2:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#004.md)<span
id="xxi.ii-p12.1"></span>.) It was, therefore, the height of cruelty in
them to invite the Babylonians to destroy their own brethren, or fan the
flames of their hostility. We are to notice, however, that the Psalmist
does not break forth into these awful denunciations unadvisedly, but as
God’s herald, to confirm former prophecies. God both by Ezekiel and
Jeremiah had predicted that he would punish the Edomites, (<span
id="xxi.ii-p12.2"></span>[Eze
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze025.htm#013.md)<span id="xxi.ii-p12.2"></span>;
<span id="xxi.ii-p12.3"></span>[Jer
49:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007.md)<span id="xxi.ii-p12.3"></span>;
and <span id="xxi.ii-p12.4"></span>[Lam.
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#022)<span id="xxi.ii-p12.4"></span>.md)
and Obadiah distinctly gives the reason, answerable to what is here
stated — that they had conspired with the Babylonians. (<span
id="xxi.ii-p12.5"></span>[Ob 1:11](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#011.md)<span
id="xxi.ii-p12.5"></span>.) We know that God intended in this way to
comfort and support the minds of the people under a calamity so very
distressing, as that Jacob’s election might have seemed to be rendered
frustrate, should his descendants be treated with impunity in such a
barbarous manner, by the posterity of Esau. The Psalmist prays, under
the inspiration of the Spirit, that God would practically demonstrate
the truth of this prediction. Anti when he says, *Remember, O Jehovah!*
he would remind God’s people of the promise to strengthen their belief
in his avenging justice, and make them wait for the event with patience
and submission. To pray for vengeance would have been unwarrantable, had
not God pro-raised it, and had the party against whom it was sought not
been reprobate and incurable; for as to others, even our greatest
enemies, we should wish their amendment and reformation. The *day of
Jerusalem,,* is a title given by him, and of frequent occurrence in
Scripture, to the time of visitation, which had a divinely appointed and
definite term.

<span id="xxi.ii-p13"></span><span id="xxi.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii-p14"></span>**8.** *O daughter of Babylon*  <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) *laid waste!* The Psalmist discerns
the coming judgment of God, though not yet apparent, by the eye of
faith, as the Apostle well calls faith “the beholding of things not
seen.” (<span id="xxi.ii-p15.4"></span>[Heb
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001)<span id="xxi.ii-p15.4"></span>..md)
Incredible as it might appear that any calamity should overtake so
mighty an empire as Babylon then was, and impregnable as it was
generally considered to be, he sees in the glass of the Word its
destruction and overthrow. He calls upon all God’s people to do the
same, and by faith from the elevation of heaven’s oracles, to despise
the pride of that abandoned city. If the divine promises inspire us with
hope and confidence, and God’s Spirit attemper our afflictions to the
rule of his own uprightness, we shall lift up our heads in the lowest
depths of affliction to which we may be east down, and glory in the fact
that it is well with us in our worst distresses, and that our enemies
are devoted to destruction. In declaring those to be happy who should
*pay back vengeance upon the Babylonians,* he does not mean that the
service done by the Medes and Persians, in itself met with the
approbation of God;  <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) for they
were actuated in the war by ambition, insatiable covetousness, and
unprincipled rivalry; but he declares that a war which was carried on in
a manner under God’s auspices, should be crowned with success. As God
had determined to punish Babylon, he pronounced a blessing upon Cyrus
and Darius, while on the other hand Jeremiah (<span
id="xxi.ii-p16.2"></span>[Jer
48:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#010)<span id="xxi.ii-p16.2"></span>.md)
declares those cursed who should do the work of the Lord negligently,
that is, fail in strenuously carrying out the work of desolation and
destruction, to which God had called them as his hired executioners. It
may seem to savor of cruelty, that he should wish the tender and
innocent infants to be dashed and mangled upon the stones, but he does
not speak under the impulse of personal feeling, and only employs words
which God had himself authorized, so that this is but the declaration of
a just judgment, as when our Lord says,

<span id="xxi.ii-p17"></span>“With what measure ye mete, it shall be
measured to you again.” (<span id="xxi.ii-p17.1"></span>[Mt
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002)<span id="xxi.ii-p17.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xxi.ii-p18"></span>Isaiah (<span id="xxi.ii-p18.1"></span>[Isa
13:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#016)<span id="xxi.ii-p18.1"></span>.md)
had issued a special prediction in reference to Babylon, which the
Psalmist has doubtless here in his eye — “Behold God has sharpened the
iron, and bent the bows; he sends forth the Medes and Persians, which
shall not regard silver and gold; they shall thirst for blood only,”
etc.

<span id="xxi.i-p6"></span> By “Babylon” is meant, not the city, but the
kingdom; and the mention of rivers, according to the suggestion of
Rosenmuller, is because the synagogues were usually built near rivers,
for the greater convenience of the Jews, who were obliged to wash their
hands before prayer. But as they had no synagogues in Babylon, they
might frequent such localities as would, be suitable sites for places of
worship, and there in the open air perform divine service. It is
conjectured by Chrysostom that the Jewish captives were not suffered at
first to dwell in any of their conquerors’ towns or cities, but were
dispersed all along several rivers of the country, where they built for
themselves tabernacles or cottages.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[179](cc12020.htm#fr_178.md) <span
id="xxi.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p8"></span> It may also be observed that sitting on the
ground is a posture which indicates mourning and deep distress. Thus it
is said in <span id="xxi.i-p8.1"></span>[Isa
3:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#026.md)<span id="xxi.i-p8.1"></span>,
where the captivity of the Jews in Babylon is foretold, “And she
\[Judea\] being desolate shall sit upon the ground.” And the Prophet
Jeremiah, in portraying the sorrow which afflicted his pious and
patriotic countrymen under the desolation of their country, says,

<span id="xxi.i-p9"></span>“The elders of the daughter of Zion  
sit upon the ground and keep silence.” (<span id="xxi.i-p9.2"></span>[La
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#010)<span id="xxi.i-p9.2"></span> .md)

<span id="xxi.i-p10"></span>“We find Judea,” says Mr. Addison, “on
several coins of Vespasian and Titus in a posture that denotes sorrow
and captivity. I need not mention her sitting on the ground, because we
have already spoken of the aptness of such a posture to represent an
extreme affliction. I fancy the Romans might have an eye on the customs
of the Jewish nation, as well as those of their own country, in the
several marks of sorrow they have set on this figure. The Psalmist
describes the Jews lamenting their captivity in the same pensive
posture: ‘By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept, when we
remembered thee, O Zion!’” — *Addison on Medals,* Dial. 2.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[180](cc12020.htm#fr_179.md) <span

<span id="xxi.i-p13"></span> “On the banks of the Babylonian rivers (say
the Euphrates and Tigris) there are no woods or forests, or any
considerable trees besides the cultivated date-palm. But these rivers
are in some parts rather extensively lined with a growth of tall shrubs
and bushes, interspersed with some small, and a few middling trees,
amongst which the willow is at this day the most frequet and
remarkable.” — *Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible*. Hence <span
id="xxi.i-p13.1"></span>[Isa 15:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#007.md)<span
id="xxi.i-p13.1"></span> calls the Euphrates “the brook *or* river of
willows.”

who were the singers and the musicians of the temple, had taken their
harps with them to Babylon, and that their captors, having heard of
their skill in music, demanded of them a specimen of *it.*” —

id="xxi.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.ii-p3"></span> *Let my right hand forget* The sentence
ends abruptly, and some supplementary word is necessary to render it
complete. The Chaldee version, by altering the person of the verb, has
avoided the ellipsis, *May I forget, my right hand.* The Syriac reads,
*May my right hand forget.me.* The Septuagint has a passive verb, viz.,
<span id="xxi.ii-p3.1"></span>ἐπιλησθείν*,* as if the original were
<span id="xxi.ii-p3.2"></span>תשכח. Calvin, in his Commentary, makes the
same supplement as the translators of our English Bible — *Let my right
hand forget its cunning;* and the correctness of this view is supported
by the following verse, where we have, *Let my tongue cleave to the roof
of my mouth,* etc. The object of both verses is to express a deep,
heart-felt interest in Jerusalem; and should he lose that interest, the
Psalmist wishes that the two members of the body, by which both
instrumental and vocal music are performed, may be rendered incapable of
doing their work — that the tongue may be unable to utter, and the right
hand may forget the art of playing, or *its cunning.* “There here is a
striking and appropriate point in this which has been overlooked. It is,
that as it is customary for people in the East to swear by their
possessions, so one who has no possessions — who is poor and destitute,
and has nothing of recognised value in the world — swears by his right
hand, which is his whole stake in society, trod by the ‘cunning’ of
which he earns his daily bread. Hence the common Arabic proverb, (given
by Burckhardt, No. 550,) reflecting on the change of demeanour produced
by improved circumstances: ‘He was wont to swear by *the cutting off of
his right hand!* He now swears by ‘the giving of money to the poor.’” —
