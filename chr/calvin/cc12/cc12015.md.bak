<span id="xvi-p1"></span>PSALM 132

<span id="xvi-p2"></span>The writer of this Psalm, whoever he may have
been  <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) here, in the name of all
the faithful, puts God in remembrance of his promise, that he would
never suffer his house or kingdom to fail, but support and defend both.

<span id="xvi.i-p2"></span>**1.** O Jehovah! Remember David, and all his

<span id="xvi.i-p7"></span><span id="xvi.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p8"></span>**1.** *O Jehovah! remember David.*
Interpreters are not agreed respecting the penman of this Psalm, though
there is little doubt that it was either David or Solomon. At the solemn
dedication of the Temple, when Solomon prayed, several verses are
mentioned in the sacred history as having been quoted by him, from which
we may infer that the Psalm was sufficiently well known to the people,
or that Solomon applied a few words of it for an occasion in reference
to which he had written the whole Psalm. The name of David is
prominently mentioned, because it was to him that the continuance of the
kingdom and Temple was promised, and though dead, this could not affect
the truthfulness of God’s word. The Church could very properly pray in
the manner which is here done, that God would perform what he had
promised to his servant David, not as a private individual, but in favor
of all his people. It was therefore a preposterous idea of the Papists
to argue from this passage that we may be benefitted by the intercession
of the dead. Just as if the faithful were here to be understood as
calling up an advocate from the tomb to plead their cause with God, when
it is abundantly evident from the context that they look entirely to the
covenant which God had made with David, knowing well that though given
to one man, it was with the understanding that it should be communicated
to all. There is a propriety why mention should be made of his
*affliction* or *humiliation.* Some render the word *meekness,* but
there is no reason for this whatsoever. In <span
id="xvi.i-p8.1"></span>[2Ch 6:42](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#042.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p8.1"></span>, it is true we read of <span
id="xvi.i-p8.2"></span>חסדים*;* that is, *mercies,* which I consider to
be there understood in the passive sense, as meaning the benefits which
had been conferred upon David; but I am clearly of opinion that here the
reference is to the anxious cares, the numerous difficulties and
struggles which David had to undergo, so long as he was kept by God in
suspense. Remember, as if it had been said, the great anxieties, the
heavy troubles, which David endured before he came to the kingdom, and
how fervently and earnestly he desired to build the Temple, though he
was not allowed to do it during his whole life. The dangers, labors, and
troubles which he underwent, must clearly have confirmed the faith of
God’s people in the truth of the divine oracle, inasmuch as they showed
how firmly and certainly he was himself convinced of the truth of what
God had spoken. Some insert the copulative reading, *remember David and
affliction;* but of this I do not approve. The particle <span
id="xvi.i-p8.3"></span>את *eth,* rather denotes that special respect in
which they would have David remembered, viz., as regarded his
afflictions, or that he might come forth before the view of God with his
afflictions, and obtain his desire according to them.

<span id="xvi.i-p9"></span><span id="xvi.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p10"></span>**2.** *Who sware to Jehovah.* One
affliction of David is particularly mentioned, That he was filled with
perplexity on account of the situation of the Ark. Moses had commanded
the people ages before to worship God in the place which he had chosen.
(<span id="xvi.i-p10.1"></span>[De
12:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu012.htm#005)<span id="xvi.i-p10.1"></span>..md)
David knew that the full time had now arrived when the particular place
should be made apparent, and yet was in some hesitation — a state of
things which was necessarily attended with much anxiety, especially to
one who was so ardently attached to the worship of God, and so
vehemently desirous to have the fixed presence of God with the nation,
for its defense and government. It is said that he swore to see to the
building of the Temple, and to postpone every other consideration to the
accomplishment of this object.  <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md)
The objurgation may seem to assume a somewhat too harsh and severe form,
when he declares his resolution to refuse sleep, his food, and the
common supports of life, until a place should have been set apart for
the Temple. To have acted in this way would have been to show an
inconsiderate zeal, for it did not become him to prescribe the time to
God, nor was it possible for him to endure any number of fasting days or
sleepless nights. Then when are we to consider that this vow was taken?
I am aware indeed that some Hebrew writers judge it to have been at that
period when he fell down trembling at the sight of the angel; but,
without denying that the plot of ground was pointed out to him
immediately after that circumstance, it is altogether a forced and
unsupported conjecture to say, that what had so long been in the
thoughts of David was conceived at that exact time. Nor is there
anything which should prevent us from supposing that his language is
here to be understood as hyperbolical, and that this was not a vow in
the strict form of it, but to be understood in a qualified sense ­ that
he would never enter his house, nor ascend his couch, without feeling a
concern upon this subject. He felt persuaded that the settlement of the
sanctuary was intimately connected with the state of the kingdom; and we
need not be surprised that so long as he was kept in uncertainty
regarding the place of the Temple, he should scarcely have felt assured
of his very crown, and have been incapable of sharing the ordinary
comforts of life with any satisfaction. Still, where Scripture has been
silent we can say nothing certain; and I may throw out these things as
what seems to me the most probable interpretation. And I think the sense
of the passage may very well bear to be that which I have mentioned,
That until informed of the place of the Ark’s destined residence, David
was full of concern and anxiety, dwelling in his house, or when he lay
upon his bed. As to the vow itself, this and other passages afford no
ground for supposing, with the Papists, that God approves of whatever
vows they may utter, without regard to the nature of them. To vow unto
God that which he has himself declared to be agreeable to him, is a
commendable practice; but it is too much presumption on our part to say
that we will rush upon such vows as suit our carnal inclination. The
great thing is that we consider what is agreeable to his will, otherwise
we may be found depriving him of that wherein indeed his principal right
lies, for with him “to obey is better than sacrifice.” (<span

<span id="xvi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
132:6-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#006.md)<span id="xvi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p2"></span>**6.** Lo! We heard of it at Ephratha; we
found it in the fields of the wood. **7.** We will go into his
habitations, we will worship at his footstool. **8.** Arise, O Jehova!
Into thy rest, thou, and the Ark of thy strength. **9.** Let thy priests
be clothed with righteousness, and let thy meek ones rejoice.

<span id="xvi.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xvi.ii-p4"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p5"></span>**6.** *Lo! we heard of it at Ephratha.*
This verse is obscure, and we need not wonder at the difficulty which
interpreters have felt in ascertaining its meaning. First, the relative
pronoun  <span id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) being of the feminine
gender has no antecedent, and we are forced to suppose that it must
refer to the word *habitation* in the foregoing sentence, although there
it reads *habitations,* in the plural number. But the principal
difficulty lies in the word *Ephratha,* because the Ark of the Covenant
was never placed there. If the reference be to past time, Shiloh should
have been the place mentioned; but as it is plain the Psalmist speaks of
its new *residence,* the question returns, why Ephratha and not Zion is
specified? Some would get rid of the difficulty by resorting to a
frivolous conceit, That the place had two names, and that the plat of
ground which was shown to David (<span id="xvi.ii-p6.7"></span>[2Sa
24:18](../../../bib/kjv/sa2024.htm#018.md)<span id="xvi.ii-p6.7"></span>;
<span id="xvi.ii-p6.8"></span>[1Ch
21:18](../../../bib/kjv/ch1021.htm#018)<span id="xvi.ii-p6.8"></span>.md)
was called Ephratha, because it was *fertile,* on which account Jerome
styles it <span id="xvi.ii-p6.9"></span>καρποφοριαν*,* and yet is not
very consistent with himself, for in another place, when he gets into
his allegories, he most absurdly interprets it to mean *frenzy.* I have
no doubt whatever that the word comes from <span
id="xvi.ii-p6.10"></span> פרה*parah,* which means to *bear fruit;* just
as Bethlehem, which is situated in the same quarter, was called for its
fruitfulness “the house of bread.” But any conjecture founded upon the
mere name of the place is necessarily unsatisfactory, and we must seek
some more probable explanation. I might begin by mentioning one which is
not without force. A rumor had spread that the Ark of the Covenant was
to be deposited in Ephratha, which was the place of David’s nativity
 <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) , and we may suppose at least
that his native soil would seem to many the most appropriate locality
for the Ark and Sanctuary. We can easily understand how such an opinion
should get abroad. In that case the hearing referred to by the Psalmist
alludes to the report which had been circulated. Should this be taken as
the meaning, the verb would be in the pluperfect tense, *we HAD heard
that it was in Ephratha,* but we found it in the woods, that is, in a
place by no means so attractive or well cultivated. Jerusalem might be
said to be woody, because we know that it was surrounded by mountains,
and that it was by no means in a part of the country which was noted for
fruitfulness. There is another meaning which I would submit to the
judgment of the reader. Let us suppose that the faithful here say that
they had *heard of its being in Ephratha,* because God had spoken still
greater things of Ephratha than of Zion. It is true that the memorable
prediction (<span id="xvi.ii-p7.2"></span>[Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002)<span id="xvi.ii-p7.2"></span>.md) had
not yet been given, yet it may have been that God had already issued
some very great and signal prophecy regarding Bethlehem. We have heard,
as if they had said, of Bethlehem, but it is only as yet a dim
expectation which we have in reference to that place, and in the
meantime we must worship God in this place of the woods, looking forward
to the fulfillment of the promise regarding Ephratha. This
interpretation, however, is far fetched, nor would I venture to adopt
it, or at least recommend it to others as the right one. The simpler way
seems to be to understand the word *Ephratha* as applying to David
personally, and not so much to the place of that name, the declaration
of the Psalmist being to this effect ­ that now when God had chosen a
king from Ephratha, the place would necessarily at the same time be
marked out for the Ark of the Covenant. It is said, *have heard,* for
the fixing of the place of the Sanctuary depended upon the will of God;
nor until this was declared could men determine it according to their
own fancy. The fact that now upon David’s mounting the throne this
illustrious oracle concerning the permanent settlement of the Temple was
to take effect, afforded good ground of thanksgiving. We have proof here
that the people of God did not deposit the Ark at random in any place,
but had express directions from God himself as to the place where he
would be worshipped ­ all proper worship proceeding from faith, while
faith cometh by hearing. (<span id="xvi.ii-p7.3"></span>[Ro
10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017)<span id="xvi.ii-p7.3"></span>..md)
Mount Zion had no peculiar excellencies almost to recommend it; but
having once heard that it was the object of God’s choice, they show that
they consider it wrong to call the matter in question.

<span id="xvi.ii-p8"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p9"></span>**7.** *We will go into his habitations.*
Here he dictates to all the Lord’s people a common form of mutual
exhortation to the duty of going up to the place which had been pointed
out by the Angel. The clearer the intimation God may have given of his
will, the more alacrity should we show in obeying it. Accordingly, the
Psalmist intimates that now when the people had ascertained beyond all
doubt the place of God’s choice, they should admit of no
procrastination, and show all the more alacrity as God was calling them
more closely, and with a more privileged familiarity, to himself, now
that he had selected a certain place of rest amongst them. He thus
passes a virtual condemnation upon the lukewarmness of those whose zeal
does not increase in proportion to the measure of revelation which they
enjoy. *Habitations* are spoken of in the plural number, and this it may
be (though we may doubt whether the Psalmist had such minute
distinctions in his eye) because there was in the temple an inner
sanctuary, a middle apartment, and then the court. It is of more
importance to attend to the epithet which follows, where the Psalmist
calls the Ark of the Covenant *God’s footstool,* to intimate that the
sanctuary could never contain the immensity of God’s essence, as men
were apt absurdly to imagine. The mere outward temple with all its
majesty being no more than his foot. stool, his people were called upon
to look upwards to the heavens and fix their contemplations with due
reverence upon God himself. We know that they were prohibited from
forming any low and carnal view of him. Elsewhere, it is true, we find
it called “God’s face,” (<span id="xvi.ii-p9.1"></span>[Ps
28:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa028.htm#008)<span id="xvi.ii-p9.1"></span>,.md)
to confirm the faith of the people in looking to this divine symbol
which was set before them. Both ideas are brought out very distinctly in
the passage before us, that, on the one hand, it is mere superstition to
suppose God confined to the temple, and that, on the other hand, the
external symbols are not without their use in the Church ­ that, in
short, we should improve these as helps to our faith, but not rest in
them. While God dwells in heaven, and is above all heavens, we must
avail ourselves of helps in rising to the knowledge of him; and in
giving us symbols of his presence, he sets, as it were, his feet upon
the earth, and suffers us to touch them. It is thus that the Holy Spirit
condescends for our profit, and in accommodation to our infirmity,
raising our thoughts to heavenly and divine things by these worldly
elements. In reference to this passage, we are called to notice the
amazing ignorance of the Second Council of Nice, in which these worthy
weak Fathers  <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) of ours wrested it
into a proof of idolatry, as if David or Solomon commanded the people to
erect statues to God and worship them. Now, that the Mosiac ceremonies
are abolished we worship at the footstool of God, when we yield a
reverential submission to. his word, and rise from the sacraments to a
true spiritual service of him. Knowing that God has not descended from
heaven directly or in his absolute character, but that. his feet, are
withdrawn from us, being placed on a footstool, we should be careful to
rise to him by the intermediate steps. Christ is he not only on whom the
feet of God rest, but in whom the whole fullness of God’s essence and
glory resides, and in him, therefore, we should seek the Father. With
this view he descended, that we might rise heavenward.

<span id="xvi.ii-p11"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p12"></span>**8.** *Arise, O Jehovah?*  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) Such language as this, inviting the
great God who fills heaven and earth to come into a new place of
residence, might seem strange and harsh, but the external symbols of
religion which God had appointed are spoken of in these exalted terms to
put honor upon them, and the better to ensure to them the regard of
God’s people. Should God institute no medium of intercourse, and call us
to a direct communication with heaven, the great distance at which we
stand from him would strike us with dismay, and paralyze invocation.
Although, therefore, he does not thereby change place himself, he is
felt by us to draw sensibly nearer. It was thus that he descended
amongst his ancient people by the Ark of the Covenant, which he designed
to be a visible emblem of his power and grace being present amongst
them. Accordingly, the second clause of the verse is of an exegetical
*character,* informing the Church that God was to be understood as
having come in the sense of making a conspicuous display of his power in
connection with the Ark. Hence it is called the *Ark of his strength,*
not a mere dead idle shadow to look upon, but what certainly declared
God’s nearness to his Church. By the *rest* spoken of we are to
understand Mount Zion, because, as we shall see afterwards, God was ever
afterwards to be worshiped only in that place.

<span id="xvi.ii-p14"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p15"></span>**9.** *Let thy priests,* etc. He now prays
in general for the prosperity of the Church, as what stood intimately
connected with the previous statement, the promotion of our best
interests being the great end for which God dwells amongst us. Some
construe the words into a wish that the worship of God might be
maintained in its purity, and think that the Psalmist prays that the
priests might be clothed with holiness in allusion to their sacred
garments. Upon a closer view of the words and the whole context, I am
rather inclined to be of another opinion, and to consider this a prayer
that the righteousness of God might be displayed amongst the people,
being as an ornament upon the priests, and communicating joy to all the
people. Thus I take *righteousness* to mean the fruit or effects of
righteousness, and this the righteousness of God, not of men. The
*priests* are of course mentioned first, as holding a higher place in
the appointed order of the Church; while they have their due place
assigned to them, it is still the Church collectively to which the
prayer refers as though the Psalmist requested that the glory of this
righteousness should be reflected from the priests upon the people
generally. God is said to clothe us with his righteousness when he
appears as our Savior and help, defends us by his power, and shows in
his government of us that we are the objects of his care. The
*rejoicing* which is spoken of must have reference to a life of
happiness. And these two things being joined together may convince us
that by *righteousness* nothing else is meant than God’s guardianship
and government. Consistently with this we find it said afterwards ­ “Thy
priests shall be clothed with salvation;” and I may add, that Solomon:.
in the solemn prayer already referred to, (<span
id="xvi.ii-p15.1"></span>[2Ch
6:41](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#041)<span id="xvi.ii-p15.1"></span>,.md)
makes no mention of righteousness, but of salvation. I have repeatedly
given the reason why the saints of God are called <span
id="xvi.ii-p15.2"></span> חסידים*chasidim,* or *merciful ones,* because
mercy or beneficence is that grace which assimilates us most to God.

<span id="xvi.iii"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
132:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#010.md)<span
id="xvi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p2"></span>**10.** For thy servant David’s sake turn
not away the face of thy Christ. **11.** Jehovah has sworn to David in
truth, nor will he turn from it; of the fruit of thy belly will I set
upon thy throne. **12.** If thy children will keep my covenant and my,
testimonies which I will teach them, their children shall also sit upon
thy throne for evermore.

<span id="xvi.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xvi.iii-p4"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p5"></span>**10.** *For thy servant David’s sake,
etc*. Some would connect the first part of the verse with the preceding.
without adducing reasons against this, it must at once strike the reader
that this verse must be taken together. Before entering upon an
explanation of the Psalmist’s meaning I may just say that it would be to
put a forced sense upon the words were we to understand by *turning away
the face of thy Christ ­* depriving us of a view of the Redeemer. We may
infer with certainty from Solomon’s prayer, that they are a request that
God would show favor to the king. The same expression is employed by
Bathsheba in the request which she made to her son Solomon, “Turn not
away thy face,” meaning that he would not cast her out of his sight.
(<span id="xvi.iii-p5.1"></span>[1Ki
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#020)<span id="xvi.iii-p5.1"></span>..md)
It is an expression tantamount to *shewing displeasure;* and we might
say a word or two in reference to it because the other idea of referring
the words to our Redeemer is plausible, and might mislead persons of
little discernment. Nothing more, then, is here asked than that God
would not despise and reject the prayers which David had preferred in
the name of all the people. The favor is asked for David’s sake, only
because God had made a covenant with him. So far as that privilege was
concerned, he did not stand exactly upon the footing of any other
ordinary man. The prayer, in short, is to the effect that God in
remembrance of his promise would show favor to the posterity of David,
for though this prayer for the Church must be considered as dictated to
each of the kings, the foundation was in the person of David. The Church
was thus taught figuratively that Christ, as Mediator, would make
intercession for all his people. As yet he had not appeared in the
flesh, nor entered by the sacrifice of himself into the Holiest of all,
and in the meantime the people had a figurative Mediator to embolden
them in their supplications.

<span id="xvi.iii-p6"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p7"></span>**11.** *Jehovah sware unto David.*  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) Here he brings out the idea still more
clearly, that the only thing he had respect to in David was the free
promise which God had made to him. He takes notice of the fact, as
confirmatory to his faith, that God had ratified the promise by oath. As
to the particular words used, he speaks of God having sworn in truth,
that is, not fallaciously, but in good faith, so that no doubt could be
entertained of his departing from his word. The thing promised was a
successor to David of his own seed; for though he did not want children,
he had already almost despaired of the regular succession, from the
fatal confusions which prevailed in his family, and the discord which
internally rent his household, and might eventually ruin it. Solomon was
particularly marked out, but the promise extended to a continuous line
of successors. This arrangement affected the welfare of the whole
Church, and not of David only, and the people of Godare encouraged by
the assurance, that the kingdom which he had established amongst them
was possessed of a sacred and enduring stability. Both king and people
needed to be reminded of this divine foundation upon which it rested. We
see how insolently the sovereigns of this world often deport themselves
­ filled with pride, though in words they may acknowledge that they
reign by the grace of God. How often, besides, do they violently usurp
the throne; how rarely do they come to it in a regular manner. A
distinction is therefore drawn between the kingdoms of this world and
that which David held by the sacred tenure of God’s own oracle.

<span id="xvi.iii-p9"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p10"></span>**12.** *If thy sons keep my covenant.*
More distinct. notice is now taken of the descending line, by which the
perpetuity of the succession, as I have already shown, is pointed out.
Sons of princes commonly succeed them in this world by right of
inheritance, but there was this undoubted peculiarity of privilege in
the case of David’s kingdom, that God expressly declared that he would
always have a descendant from his body upon the throne, not for one age
merely, but for ever. For though that kingdom was for a time destroyed,
it was restored again, and had its everlasting establishment in Christ.
Here the question occurs ­ Did the continuance of the kingdom rest upon
good conduct, or human merit? for the terms of this agreement would seem
to suggest that God’s covenant would not be made good, unless men
faithfully performed their part, and that thus the effect of the grace
promised was suspended upon obedience. We must remember, in the first
place, that the covenant was perfectly gratuitous, so far as related to
God’s promise of sending a Savior and Redeemer, because this stood
connected with the original adoption of those to whom the promise was
made, which was itself free. Indeed the treachery and rebellion of the
nation did not prevent God from sending forth his Son, and this was a
public proof that he was not influenced by the consideration of their
good conduct. Hence Paul says, (<span id="xvi.iii-p10.1"></span>[Ro
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#003)<span id="xvi.iii-p10.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="xvi.iii-p11"></span>“What if some did not believe  
is therefore the truth of God of none effect?”

<span id="xvi.iii-p12"></span>intimating that God had not withdrawn his
favor from the Jews, having chosen them freely of his grace. We know,
too, that notwithstanding their efforts, as if it had been of set
purpose, to destroy the promises, God met their malicious opposition
with displays of his marvellous love, made his truth and faithfulness to
emerge in a most triumphant manner, and showed that he stood firm to his
own purpose, independently of any merit of theirs. This may serve to
show in what sense the covenant was not conditional; but as there were
other things which were accessories to the covenant,  <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) a condition was appended, to the
effect that God would bless them if they obeyed his commandments. The
Jews, for declining from this obedience, were removed into exile. God
seemed at that time “to make void or profane his covenant,” as we have
seen elsewhere. The dispersion was a kind of breaking of the covenant,
but only in part and to appearance. This will be brought out more
clearly by reference to what we learn, from sacred history, to have
occurred shortly after David’s death. By the defection of the ten tribes
the kingdom suffered a severe blow, only a small portion of it being
left. Afterwards it was reduced by fresh disasters, till at length it
was torn up by the root. And although their return from the captivity
gave some hope of restoration, there was no one bearing the name of
king, and any dignity that attached to Zerubbabel was but obscure, till
kings sprung up who were spurious, and not of the right line. In this
case would we not have said that the covenant of God was abolished? and
yet, as the Redeemer came forth from the very source predicted, it is
plain that it stood firm and stable. In this sense it is said by Ezekiel
of the crown, (<span id="xvi.iii-p13.2"></span>[Eze
21:26](../../../bib/kjv/eze021.htm#026.md)<span
id="xvi.iii-p13.2"></span>,)

<span id="xvi.iii-p14"></span>“Remove the diadem; reversed, reversed,

<span id="xvi.iii-p15"></span>where the Prophet might seem to cancel
what God had written with his own hand, and nullify his promise, for the
safety of the people stood intimately connected with the throne,
according to the expression we find in the Lamentations,

<span id="xvi.iii-p16"></span>“The breath of our nostrils, the anointed
of the Lord,  
was taken in their pits.” (<span id="xvi.iii-p16.2"></span>[La
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020)<span id="xvi.iii-p16.2"></span>.md)

<span id="xvi.iii-p17"></span>The Prophet, we say, might seem to strike
directly against the covenant made by God, when he speaks of the crown
being taken away, and yet what he adds in the subsequent part of the
sentence, proves that covenant, in so far as it was gratuitous, to have
been everlasting and inviolable, since he holds out the promise of the
Redeemer, notwithstanding the conduct of the Jews, which was such as to
exclude them temporarily from the divine, favor. God, on the one hand,
took vengeance upon the people for their ingratitude, so as to show that
the terms of the covenant did not run conditionally to no purpose; while
on the other, at the coming of Christ there was a free performance of
what had been freely promised, the crown being set upon Christ’s head.
The obedience which God demands is particularly stated to be the
obedience of his covenant, to teach us that we must not serve him by
human inventions, but confine ourselves within the prescription of his
word.

<span id="xvi.iv-p6"></span><span id="xvi.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p7"></span>**13.** *Seeing that Jehovah has chosen
Zion.* By coupling the kingdom with the priesthood and sanctuary
service, he declares it still more emphatically to have been of divine
and not human appointment. The connection is not to be overlooked, on
another account. The true strength and stability of that kingdom were in
Christ, and Christ’s kingdom is inseparable from his priesthood. This
may explain why mention is made of Zion being chosen. God decreed
nothing in relation to the kingdom, but what had a certain connection
with the sanctuary, the more perfectly to prefigure the Mediator who was
to come, and who was both priest and king, after the order of
Melchizedek. The kingdom and tabernacle were, therefore, closely allied.
Notice is taken of the reason upon which the choice proceeded ­ that
mount Zion was not chosen for any excellency belonging to it, as we have
seen, (<span id="xvi.iv-p7.1"></span>[Ps
68:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#016)<span id="xvi.iv-p7.1"></span>,.md)
but because such was the will of God. His good pleasure is specified in
contrast with any merit in the place itself. This is another proof of
what we have already stated ­ that the covenant made by God with David
proceeded from his mere goodness.

<span id="xvi.iv-p8"></span><span id="xvi.iv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p9"></span>**14.** *This is my rest for ever.* The same
truth is here put into the mouth of God, to give it additional weight;
and it is declared not to have been in vain that the Temple had been
erected, since God would show effectually and by practical testimonies
the delight which he had in the worship of his own appointment. God’s
resting, or talking up his habitation, are expressions which denote his
being present with men in the manifestation of his power. Thus *he dwelt
in Zion,* in the sense that there his people worshipped him according to
the prescription of his law, and found besides the benefit of the
service in his favorable answer to their requests. It was eventually
seen, in a very striking manner, that this was the promise of an
infallible God, whet, after the Temple had been overthrown, the altar
cast down, and the whole frame of legal service interrupted, the glory
of the Lord afterwards returned to it once more, and remained there up
to the advent of Christ. We all know in what a wicked and shameful
manner the Jews abused the divine promise which is here made, under the
impression that it necessarily laid God under an obligation to favor
them, taking occasion from if, in the pride of their hearts, to despise,
and even cruelly persecute the Prophets. Luther on this account calls it
“the bloody promise;” for, like all hypocrites who make God’s holy name
a covert for iniquity, they did not hesitate, when charged with the,
worst, crimes, to insist that it was beyond the power of the Prophets to
take from them privileges which God had bestowed. With them to assert
that the Temple could be stripped of its glory, was equivalent to
charging God with falsehood, and impeaching his faithfulness. Under the
influence of this spirit of vain confidence they proceeded such
inconceivable lengths in shedding innocent blood. Were the Devil of Rome
armed with pretensions as splendid, what bounds would be set to its
audacity? As it is, we see how fiercely, and with what bloody pride it
arrogates the name of the Church, while outraging all religion, in open
contempt of God and flagrant violation of humanity. But what of that?
the hierarchy would otherwise fall, and this must stand, if Christ would
not desert his spouse the Church! The refutation of such a plea is not
far to seek. The Church is limited to no one place: now that the glory
of the Lord shines through all the earth, his rest is where Christ and
his members are. It is necessary that we rightly understand what the
Psalmist says of the everlasting continuance of the Temple. The advent
of Christ was “the time of reformation,” and the figures of the former
Testament, instead of being then proved or rendered vain, were
substantiated, and received their fulfillment in him. If it be still
objected that mount Zion is here spoken of as the everlasting residence
of God, it is sufficient to answer that the whole world became an
enlarged mount Zion upon the advent of Christ.

<span id="xvi.iv-p10"></span><span id="xvi.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iv-p11"></span>**15.** *Blessing I will bless, etc*. God’s
dwelling in the midst of the people was what constituted the great
source of their blessedness; and now some of the proofs are mentioned
which he would give of his fatherly regard, such as preparing and
administering their ordinary food, relieving their wants, clothing their
priests with salvation, and filling all his people with joy and
gladness. This it was necessary should be added, for unless we have
ocular demonstration of the divine goodness, we are not spiritual enough
to rise upwards to the apprehension of it. We have a twofold
demonstration of it in the matter of our daily food; first in the
earth’s being enriched so as to furnish us with corn, and wine, and oil;
and again in the earth’s produce being multiplied, through a secret
power, so as to provide us with sufficient nourishment. There is here a
promise that God would exert a special care over his own people to
supply them with food, and that though they might not have a great
abundance, yet the poor would be satisfied. We must not omit mentioning
the remarkable and ludicrous mistake which the Papists have made upon
this passage, and which shows the judicial stupidity they lie under to
be such, that there is nothing so absurd they will not swallow. By
confounding two letters into one, for *victus* they read *vidus,* and
then conjectured that this must be a mutilation for *viduas ­ blessing I
will bless her widows!* Thus they made “*widows*” out of “food” *­* an
extraordinary blunder, which we would scarcely credit, were it not a
fact that they sing the word out in their temples to this present day.
 <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) But God, who blesses the food
of his own people, has infatuated their minds, and left them to confound
everything in their absurd reveries and triflings. The inspired penman
goes on to repeat what he had already said of other blessings, only the
term *salvation* is used instead of *righteousness,* but in the same
sense I already mentioned. Some understand it to have reference to
purity of doctrine and holiness of life; but this seems a forced
interpretation, and he means simply that they would be safe and happy
under the divine protection.

<span id="xvi.v-p6"></span><span id="xvi.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p7"></span>**17.** *There will I make,* etc. He reverts
to the state of the kingdom, which God had promised to take under his
care and protection. It is necessary that we should attend to the
peculiar force of the words employed ­ *I will make the horn of David to
bud* Now there can be no doubt as to the meaning of the term *horn,*
which in Hebrew is very commonly used to signify *force* or *power;* but
we are to mark that by the *horn budding* there is an allusion to the
humble original of the kingdom, and the singular restorations which it
underwent. David was taken from the menial drudgery of the sheepfold,
and from the lowly cottage where he dwelt, the youngest son of his
father, who was no more than an ordinary shepherd, and was advanced to
the throne, and rose by a series of unlooked for successes. Under
Jeroboam the kingdom was at an early period so effectually cut down
again, that it was only by budding forth from time to time that it
maintained itself in a moderate degree of advancement. Afterwards it
underwent various shocks, which must have issued in its destruction, had
it not still budded anew. And when the people were dispersed in the
captivity, what must have become of them, had not God made the broken
and trampled horn of David. again to bud? Isaiah accordingly seems to
have had this in his eye when he compared Christ to a rod which should
spring not from tree in full growth, but from a trunk or stem. (<span
id="xvi.v-p7.1"></span>[Isa 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md)<span
id="xvi.v-p7.1"></span>.) To the prophecy now before us Zechariah
perhaps refers when he says, “Behold the man whose name is the Branch,”
(<span id="xvi.v-p7.2"></span>[Zec
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/zac006.htm#012)<span id="xvi.v-p7.2"></span>,.md)
intimating that in this way only could the power and dignity of the
kingdom be restored after the dismemberment and ravages to which it had
been exposed. In <span id="xvi.v-p7.3"></span>[2Sa
23:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa2023.htm#005.md)<span id="xvi.v-p7.3"></span>,
David makes use of the word employed in the verse before us, but in
somewhat a different sense, referring to the continual advancement of
the kingdom unto further measures of prosperity. Here the inspired
penman rather refers to the singular manner in which God would cause the
horn of David to revive again, when at any time it might. seem broken
and withered. The figure of *the lamp* is much to the same *effect,* and
occurs in many other places of Scripture, being a prophecy very
generally in the mouths of the people. The meaning is, that the kingdom,
though it underwent occasional obscurations, would never be wholly
extinguished under the calamities which overtook it, being as the lamp
of God constantly burning, and pointing out safety to the Lord’s people,
though not shining to a great distance. At that time all the
illumination enjoyed was but the feeble lamp which shone in Jerusalem;
now Christ, the sun of righteousness, sheds a full radiance all over the
world.

<span id="xvi.v-p8"></span><span id="xvi.v-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.v-p9"></span>**18.** *His enemies will I clothe with
shame.* The priests were said above “to be clothed with righteousness
and salvation,” now the enemies of David are represented as “clothed
with shame.” It is not enough that all go well within. God must keep us
from the various harms and evils which come upon us from without, and
hence we have this second promise added, which is one wherein we
recognize often the goodness of God even more than in the blessings
which he may shower upon us in the day of prosperity. The greater that
fear which seizes upon us when exposed to aggression from enemies, the
more are we sensibly awakened to take hold of divine help. The passage
teaches us that the Church and people of God will never enjoy such peace
on earth as altogether to escape being assaulted by the variety of
enemies which Satan stirs up for their destruction. It is enough to have
it declared, upon divine authority, that their attempts shall be
unsuccessful, and that they will retire eventually with ignominy and
disgrace. The, clause which follows has been variously interpreted. The
verb which we have translated *to flourish,* in the Hiphil conjugation
means sometimes *to see,* so that some have explained the words ­ In
that place shall the crown of David be seen, when the horn shall have
been made to bud. Some derive the word from <span
id="xvi.v-p9.1"></span>ציף*, tsits, a plate,* as if it had been said
that the crown of the king would be resplendent with plates of gold. But
I consider that the crown is here said to *flourish,* just as formerly
the allusion was to budding or germinating. Isaiah, on the other hand,
speaks (<span id="xvi.v-p9.2"></span>[Isa
28:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#005)<span id="xvi.v-p9.2"></span>.md) of
the crown of drunkenness of Ephraim as being a fading flower. Thus we
have it here declared that however frail to appearance the crown of
David might be in his posterity, it would be invigorated by some secret
virtue, and flourish for ever.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[126](cc12015.htm#fr_125.md) <span

<span id="xvi-p3"></span> Lightfoot ascribes this Psalm to David, and
supposes it to have been composed on the second removal of the Ark from
the house of Obededom. (<span id="xvi-p3.1"></span>[1Ch
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/ch1015.htm#004)<span id="xvi-p3.1"></span>, etc..md)
But the mention of David’s name in the tenth verse in the third person,
and the terms there employed, militate against his being the Author.
Others ascribe it to Solomon, who, they think, wrote it about the time
of the removing of the Ark into the Temple, which he had built for it.
(<span id="xvi-p3.2"></span>[2Ch
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2005.htm#002)<span id="xvi-p3.2"></span>, etc..md)
Others are of opinion, that it was composed by Solomon for the solemn
services that were celebrated at the dedication of the Temple. “The
whole tenor of this Psalm,” says Jebb, “is an exact epitome of the
Dedication Prayer of Solomon. (<span id="xvi-p3.3"></span>[2Ch
6](../../../bib/kjv/ch2006.htm#000)<span id="xvi-p3.3"></span>.md) The
topics are the same ­ the building the house of the Lord ­ the promise
to David ­ the inhabitation of the Almighty; ­ and the concluding
sentences of the Dedication, are identical with those expressions of the
Psalm in verses 8, 9, 10. There can, therefore, be little question that
this Psalm was composed by Solomon.” ­ *Jebb’s Literal Translation of
the Book of Psalms*, etc., volume 2. As this forms one of the “Songs of
Degrees,” those who conceive that these Psalms were so called beta. use
sung by the Jews about the time of their return from Babylon, conclude
that Ezra selected this ancient song to be sung at the dedication of the
second Temple.

<span id="xvi.i-p3"></span> The expression of going up to one’s bed may
be illustrated by what Dr. Shaw says of the Moorish houses in Barbary.
Having observed that their chambers are spacious, of the same length
with the square court, in the sides of which they are built, he adds,
“At one end of each chamber there is a little gallery raised three,
four, or five feet above the floor, with a balustrade in the front of
it, with a few steps likewise leading up to it. Here they place their
beds; a situation frequently alluded to in the Holy Scriptures.” The
language of the text is no doubt hyperbolical, as Calvin observes, being
intended to express David’s great anxiety to have a house built for the
worship of God.

From this Hebrew name <span id="xvi.i-p5.4"></span>אביר, *abir,* and
<span id="xvi.i-p5.5"></span>כביר, *cabir,* which is synonymous,
probably came the *Cabiri,* or the great gods of the Grecians, and the

<span id="xvi.ii-p6"></span> That is, the objective affix <span
id="xvi.ii-p6.1"></span>ה, which appears at each of the verbs in this
verse, and which is translated *it.* By some it is thought that the
antecedent is <span id="xvi.ii-p6.2"></span>ארון, *aron, ark,* which,
although it is generally masculine, is yet sometimes feminine, as in
<span id="xvi.ii-p6.3"></span>[1Sa
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/sa1004.htm#017.md)<span id="xvi.ii-p6.3"></span>;
<span id="xvi.ii-p6.4"></span>[2Ch
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ch2008.htm#011.md)<span id="xvi.ii-p6.4"></span>.
Such is the opinion of Dr. Lightfoot, who explains the verse thus: “We
heard of it (the ark) in Ephratah, (that is, Shiloh,) a city of Ephraim;
we found it in the fields of the wood, that is in Kirjath-jearim. <span
id="xvi.ii-p6.5"></span>[1Sa 7:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#001.md)<span
id="xvi.ii-p6.5"></span>*,*” etc. (Lightfoot’s Chorogr. Cent., c. 45.)
Others consider the <span id="xvi.ii-p6.6"></span> הto refer to
*habitations,* in the preceding verse; and though that noun is in the
plural, it is, as noticed in a preceding note, put by enallage for the
singular. Rosenmuller thinks this opinion ­ which is the one adopted by
Calvin ­ the more probable and no doubt at first sight the most obvious
meaning is, that the pronoun *it* refers to the spot which David had
discovered as a suitable place on which to erect the house of God.
Walford, indeed, objects that “this cannot be intended, because the site
of the Temple was neither at Ephratah, nor in the fields of the wood, or
of Jaar;” and he gives at some length an ingenious explanation of this
difficult passage, extracted chiefly from the German writer Tilingius.
This objection, it will be perceived, is removed by one of the
expositions suggested by Calvin, which supposes that the allusion is
first to a report of Ephratha being the place where the Temple was to be
built; and next to the certain information which the people of Israel
afterwards obtained that Jerusalem was the spot which God himself had
selected. Whether this however is the correct explanation of the verse,
it is not so easy to determine.
