<span id="xxix-p1"></span>PSALM 145

<span id="xxix-p2"></span>The Psalmist is led to celebrate the praises
of God by reflecting upon his excellent wisdom, goodness, and
righteousness, both in the government of the world generally, and
particularly in managing, superintending, and defending the children of
men. After recounting in general the praises of his providence, he comes
to speak of the special favor shown by him to his own people.

<span id="xxix-p3"></span>The Praise of David  <span
id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md)

<span id="xxix.i"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p1"></span><span id="xxix.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
145:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#001.md)<span id="xxix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p2"></span>**1.** I will extol thee, my God and my
king!  <span id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) and I will bless thy name
for ever and ever. **2.** Daily I will bless thee, and will praise thy
name for ever and ever.  <span id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md) **3.**
Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised, and there is no searching
out, his greatness. **4.** Generation to generation, will praise thy
works, and will show forth thy power. **5.** I will meditate upon  <span
id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) the beauty of the glory of thy
excellency, and the words of thy wonderful things. **6.** And they shall
speak of the might of thy terrible works, and I will declare thy
greatness.

<span id="xxix.i-p6"></span> 

<span id="xxix.i-p7"></span><span id="xxix.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p8"></span>**1.** *I will extol thee, my God and my
king*. David does not so much tell what he would do himself, as stir up
and urge all others to this religious service of offering to God the
praises due to his name. The design with which he declares God to be
beneficent to the children of men is, to induce them to cultivate a
pious gratitude, he insists upon the necessity of persevering in the
exercise; for since God is constant in extending mercies, it would be
highly improper in us to faint in his praises. As he thus gives his
people new ground for praising him, so he stimulates them to gratitude,
and to exercise it throughout the whole course of their life. In using
the term *daily*, he denotes perseverance in the exercise. Afterwards he
adds, that should he live through a succession of ages he would never
cease to act in this manner. The repetitions used tend very considerably
to give emphasis to his language. As it is probable that the Psalm was
written at a time when the kingdom of David was in a flourishing
condition, the circumstances deserves notice, that in calling God *his
king* he gives both himself and other earthly princes their proper
place, and does not allow any earthly distinctions to interfere with the
glory due to God.

<span id="xxix.i-p9"></span>This is made still more manifest in the
verse which follows, where, in speaking of the greatness of God as
unmeasurable, he intimates that we only praise God aright when we are
filled and overwhelmed with an ecstatic admiration of the immensity of
his power. This admiration will form the fountain from which our just
praises of him will proceed, according the measure of our capacity.

<span id="xxix.i-p10"></span><span id="xxix.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.i-p11"></span>**4.** *Generation to generation*, etc.
Here he insists upon the general truth, that all men were made and are
preserved in life for this end, that they may devote themselves to the
praise of God. And there is an implied contrast between the eternal name
of God, and that immortality of renown which great men seem to acquire
by their exploits. Human excellencies are eulogized in histories; with
God it stands differently, for there is not a day in which he does not.
renew remembrance of his works, and cherish it by some present effect,
so as indelibly to preserve it alive upon our minds. For the same reason
he speaks of the *glorious brightness*, or beauty of his excellence, the
better to raise in others a due admiration of it. *By the words of his
wonderful works,* I consider that there is an allusion to the
incomprehensible method of God’s works, for so many are the wonders that
they overwhelm our senses. And we may infer from this, that the
greatness of God is not that which lies concealed in his mysterious
essence, and in subtle disputation upon which, to the neglect of his
works, many have been chargeable with mere trifling, for true religion
demands practical not speculative knowledge. Having said that he would
*speak of*, or *meditate upon God’s works*, (for the Hebrew word, <span
id="xxix.i-p11.1"></span>אשיחה, *asichah*, as we have elsewhere seen,
may be rendered either way,) he transfers his discourse to others,
intimating, that there will always be some in the world to declare the
righteousness, goodness, and wisdom of God, and that his divine
excellencies are worthy of being sounded, with universal consent, by
every tongue. And, should others desist and defraud God of the honor due
to him, he declares that he would himself at least discharge his part,
and, while they were silent, energetically set forth the praises of God.
Some think, that *the might of his terrible works* is an expression to
the same effect with what had been already stated. But it seems rather
to denote the judgments of God against profane scoffers.

<span id="xxix.ii"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p1"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
145:7-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#007.md)<span
id="xxix.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p2"></span>**7.** They shall steak forth \[or, utter
copiously\] the memory of the greatness of thy goodness, and shall sing
of thy righteousness. **8.** Jehovah is gracious and compassionate, slow
to anger, and great in mercy. **9.** Jehovah is good to all, and his
mercies above all his works. **10.** All thy works shall praise thee, O
Jehovah! and thy merciful ones shall bless thee. **11.** They shall
speak the glory of thy kingdom, and shall talk of thy power. **12.**
That they may make known his powers to the sons of men, and the glory of
the beauty of his kingdom. **13.** Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages,
and thy dominion unto all successive generations.  <span
id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md)

<span id="xxix.ii-p7"></span> 

<span id="xxix.ii-p8"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p9"></span>**7.** *They shall speak forth*, *etc*. As
the verb <span id="xxix.ii-p9.1"></span>נבע, *nabang*, means properly to
*gush out*, some suppose, that, as applied to speech, it means not
simply speaking, but an overflowing utterance, like water rushing from a
fountain, and the verb <span id="xxix.ii-p9.2"></span>ירננו,
*yerannenu*, in the close of the verse, answers to this, meaning *to
shout*, or *sing aloud*. To celebrate the memory of the Lord’s goodness,
is the same with recalling to memory what we have personally experienced
of his goodness. We cannot deny God’s claim to praise in all his
excellencies, but we are most sensibly affected by such proofs of his
fatherly mercy as we have ourselves experienced. David makes use,
therefore, of this alluring consideration to induce us the more readily
and cheerfully to engage in the praises of God, or rather, (according to
the figurative word already used,) to burst forth in celebration of
them.

<span id="xxix.ii-p10"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p11"></span>**8.** *Jehovah is gracious*, *etc*. He
opens up the goodness of which he spoke by using several expressions, as
that God is inclined to mercy, (for such is the proper meaning of the
word <span id="xxix.ii-p11.1"></span>חנון, *channun*,) and that he helps
us willingly, as one sympathizing with our miseries. It is to be noticed
that David has borrowed the terms which he here applies to God from that
celebrated passage in <span id="xxix.ii-p11.2"></span>[Ex
34:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006.md)<span id="xxix.ii-p11.2"></span>;
and as the inspired writers drew their doctrine from the fountain of the
law, we need not wonder that they set a high value upon the vision which
is there recorded, and in which as clear and satisfactory a description
of the nature of God is given us as can anywhere be found. David,
therefore, in giving us a brief statement of what it was most important
we should know in reference to God, makes use of the same terms employed
there. Indeed no small part of the grace of God is to be seen in his
alluring us to himself by such attractive titles. Were he to bring his
power prominently into view before us, we would be cast down by the
terror of it rather than encouraged, as the Papists represent him a
dreadful God, from whose presence all must fly, whereas the proper view
of him is that which invites us to seek after him. Accordingly, the more
nearly that a person feels himself drawn to God, the more has he
advanced in the knowledge of him. If it be true that God is not only
willing to befriend us, but is spoken of as touched with sympathy for
our miseries, so as to be all the kinder to us the more that we are
miserable, what folly were it not to fly to him without delay? But as we
drive God’s goodness away from us by our sins, and block up the way of
access, unless his goodness overcome this obstacle, it would be in vain
that the Prophets spoke of his grace and mercy.  <span
id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) It was necessary, therefore, to add
what follows, that great is his mercy, that he pardons sins, and bears
with the wickedness of men, so as to show favor to the unworthy. As
regards the ungodly, although God shows them his long-suffering
patience, they are incapable of perceiving pardon, so that the doctrine
on which we insist has a special application to believers only, who
apprehend God’s goodness by a living faith. To the wicked it is said —

<span id="xxix.ii-p13"></span>“To what end is the day of the Lord for
you? the day of the Lord is darkness and not light, affliction and not
joy.”  
(<span id="xxix.ii-p13.2"></span>[Am
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018)<span id="xxix.ii-p13.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xxix.ii-p14"></span>We see in what severe terms Nahum
threatens them at the very beginning of his prophecy. Having referred to
the language used in the passage from Moses, he adds immediately, on the
other hand, to prevent them being emboldened by it, that God is a rigid
and severe, a terrible and an inexorable judge. (<span
id="xxix.ii-p14.1"></span>[Na 1:3](../../../bib/kjv/nah001.htm#003.md)<span
id="xxix.ii-p14.1"></span>.) They therefore who have provoked God to
anger by their sins, must see to secure his favor by believing.

<span id="xxix.ii-p15"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p16"></span>**9.** *Jehovah is good to all*, *etc*.
The truth here stated is of wider application than the former, for the
declaration of David is to the effect, that not only does God, with
fatherly indulgence and clemency, forgive sin, but is good to all
without discrimination, as he makes his sun to rise upon the good and
upon the wicked. (<span id="xxix.ii-p16.1"></span>[Mt
5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045)<span id="xxix.ii-p16.1"></span>..md)
Forgiveness of sin is a treasure from which the wicked are excluded, but
their sin and depravity does not prevent God from showering down his
goodness upon them, which they appropriate without being at all sensible
of it. Meanwhile believers, and they only, know what it is to enjoy a
reconciled God, as elsewhere it is said —

<span id="xxix.ii-p17"></span>“Come ye to him, and be ye enlightened,
and your faces shall not be ashamed; taste and see that the Lord is
good.”  
(<span id="xxix.ii-p17.2"></span>[Ps.
34:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#005.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008)<span id="xxix.ii-p17.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xxix.ii-p18"></span>When it is added that *the mercy of God
extends to all his works*, this ought not to be considered as contrary
to reason, or obscure. Our sins having involved the whole world in the
curse of God, there is everywhere an opportunity for the exercise of
God’s mercy, even in helping the brute creation.

<span id="xxix.ii-p19"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.ii-p20"></span>**10.** *All thy works*, *etc*. Though
many would suppress God’s praises, observing a wicked silence regarding
them, David declares that they shine forth everywhere, appear of
themselves, and are sounded, as it were, by the very dumb creatures. He
then assigns the special work of declaring them to believers, who have
eyes to perceive God’s works, and know that they cannot be employed
better than in celebrating his mercies. What is added — *they shall
speak the glory of thy kingdom* — I consider to have reference only to
believers. If any incline to think that these words rather apply to
God’s creatures universally, I would not object to that view. But the
particular kind of speaking or teaching which David here refers to,
applies only to saints. Accordingly I have retained the future tense of
the verbs, rather than the optative mood, as others have done. In using
the term kingdom, David intimates that this is the tendency of the
manifestation of God’s works, to reduce the whole world to a state of
order, and subject it to his government. He insists upon the excellency
of this kingdom, that men may know that things are to be considered as
in disorder and confusion, unless God alone be acknowledged supreme. He
denies it to be transitory, like all earthly kingdoms, asserting that it
will stand fast for ever. And to call our attention more particularly to
its everlasting nature, he breaks out into an admiring exclamation, and
addresses his discourse to God.

<span id="xxix.iii"></span>

<span id="xxix.iii-p1"></span><span id="xxix.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
145:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014.md)<span
id="xxix.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.iii-p2"></span>**14.** Jehovah upholding all the falling,
 <span id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) and raising up all who are
bowed down. **15.** The eyes of all hope in thee, and thou givest them
their food in its season. **16.** Thou openest thine hand, and
satisfiest every living thing by thy good pleasure.

<span id="xxix.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxix.iii-p5"></span><span id="xxix.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.iii-p6"></span>**14.** *Jehovah upholding all the
falling*. He gives instances of the goodness and mercy of God, such as
make it evident that God reigns only for the promotion of the general
welfare of mankind. By *the falling*, and *those who are bowed down*, he
means figuratively those who are overwhelmed by adversity, and would
sink at once, were not God to extend his hand for their support. God, in
short, has respect to the troubles of men, and helps such as are in
distress, so that all ought not only to look upon his divine government
with reverence, but willingly and cordially submit themselves to it.
Another lesson taught us is, that none will be disappointed who seeks
comfort from God in his affliction.

<span id="xxix.iii-p7"></span><span id="xxix.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.iii-p8"></span>**15.** *The eyes of all hope in thee*.
David adduces an additional proof of God’s goodness, in giving food to
all living creatures, and thus showing himself in the character of the
father of a family. Some interpreters, led by the term hope, which is
employed, restrict the application to men, as being endued with reason
and intelligence, to seek their food from their heavenly father, while
the beasts seek it only in a gross manner, by sight or smell. But
although not endued with the exercise of reason, leading them to depend
upon God’s providence, necessity itself forces even them, by a certain
hidden instinct, to seek their food, so that they may very properly be
said to hope in God, as elsewhere the young ravens are said to cry unto
him. (<span id="xxix.iii-p8.1"></span>[Ps
147:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#009.md)<span
id="xxix.iii-p8.1"></span>.) Besides, those who would restrict the words
to man, still leave them open to the charge of impropriety; for the
wicked have no regard to the fatherly care of God, more than the ox or
the ass. Since such is the order established in nature that all animals
are brought to a dependence upon their Maker, there is no impropriety in
supposing the affection of desire or expectation to be here put for the
fact of dependence itself.  <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md) All
ambiguity is taken away by the next verse, where every living thing is
said to be satisfied. It is said that he gives them their food, and in
its season, for the very variety of it serves more to illustrate the
providence of God. Each has its own way of feeding, and the different
kinds of aliment are designed and adapted for different uses. David
therefore speaks of that food which is particular to them. The pronoun
is not in the plural, and we are not to read *in their season*, as if it
applied to the animals. The food he notices as given in its season; for
here also we are to notice the admirable arrangements of divine
providence, that there is a certain time appointed for harvest, vintage,
and hay crop, and that the year is so divided into intervals, that the
cattle are fed at one time upon grass, at another on hay, or straw, or
acorns, or other products of the earth. Were the whole supply poured
forth at one and the same moment, it could not be gathered together so
conveniently; and we have no small reason to admire the seasonableness
with which the different kinds of fruit and aliment are yearly produced.

<span id="xxix.iii-p10"></span><span id="xxix.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.iii-p11"></span>**16.** *Thou openest thine hand*, *etc*.
The figure is a beautiful one. Most men pass over without observation
the singular goodness of God apparent in this admirable ordering of
things in nature, and David therefore represents him as stretching out
his hand to distribute to the animals their food. We sinfully confine
our attention to the earth which yields us our food, or to natural
causes. To correct this error David describes God as opening his hands
to put the food into our mouths. The word <span
id="xxix.iii-p11.1"></span>רצון, *ratson*, some render *desire*, as
though he meant that God supplied each kind of animal with food
according to its wish. And a little afterwards we do indeed find it used
in that sense. Others, however, refer it rather to God’s feeding them of
his mere good pleasure and kindness; it not being enough to say that our
food is given us by God, unless we add, as in the second clause of the
verse, that his kindness is gratuitous, and that there is no extrinsic
cause whatever moving him to provide so liberally for every living
creature. In that case the cause is put for the effect; the various
kinds of provision being effects of his good pleasure — <span
id="xxix.iii-p11.2"></span>χαρισματα της χάριτος. If it be found that
men and others of his creatures often suffer and die from want, this is
to be traced to the change which has come upon nature by sin. The fair
order which subsisted in it by God’s original appointment often fails
since the fall through our sins, and yet in what remains of it, though
marred, we may see the kindness of God referred to by David, for in the
severest failures of crop, there is no year so barren and unproductive,
that God may not be said to open his hand in it.

<span id="xxix.iv"></span>

<span id="xxix.iv-p1"></span><span id="xxix.iv-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
145:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#017.md)<span
id="xxix.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.iv-p2"></span>**17.** Jehovah is righteous in all his
ways, and merciful in all his works. **18.** Jehovah is near to all who
call upon him, to all who call upon him in truth. **19.** He will
perform the desire of them that fear him, and will hear their cry, and
will save them. **20.** Jehovah preserves all them that love him, and
will destroy all the wicked. **21.** My mouth shall speak the praise of
Jehovah, and all, flesh shall bless his holy name for ever and ever.

<span id="xxix.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="xxix.iv-p4"></span><span id="xxix.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.iv-p5"></span>**17.** *Jehovah is righteous in all his
ways*. He does not now speak of God’s goodness merely in providing all
his creatures with their daily food, but comprehends other parts of his
providence, as in correcting men for their sins, restraining the wicked,
trying the patience of his people under the cross, and governing the
world by judgments which are often inscrutable to us. The ground upon
which praise is here ascribed to God may seem a common one, being in
every one’s mouth; but in nothing is wisdom shown more than in holding
fast the truth, that God is just in all his ways, so as to retain in our
hearts an unabated sense of it amidst all troubles and confusions.
Though all acknowledge God to be just, most men are no sooner overtaken
by affliction than they quarrel with his severity: unless their wishes
are immediately complied with, they are impatient, and nothing is more
common than to hear his justice impeached. As it is everywhere abused by
the wicked imputations men cast upon it, here it is very properly
vindicated from such ungrateful treatment, and asserted to be constant
and unfailing, however loudly the word may disparage it. It is expressly
added, *in all his ways and works,* for we fail to give God due honor
unless we recognize a consistent tenor of righteousness in the whole
progress of his operation. Nothing is more difficult in the time of
trouble, when God has apparently forsaken us, or afflicts us without
cause, than to restrain our corrupt feelings from breaking out against
his judgments; as we are told of the emperor Mauricius in a memorable
passage of history, that seeing his sons murdered by the wicked and
perfidious traitor Phocas, and being about to be carried out himself to
death, he cried out — “Thou art righteous, O God, and just are thy
judgments!” As this man of no bad character opposed such a shield to the
cruel trials he met with, we must learn to put a check upon our spirits,
and always give God’s righteousness the honor due to it. David, however,
goes farther still, intimating that God, even when he seems to be most
severe, is so far from being cruel as to temper his heaviest judgments
with equity and clemency.

<span id="xxix.iv-p6"></span><span id="xxix.iv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.iv-p7"></span>**18.** *Jehovah is near to all that call
upon him*. This truth is principally applicable to believers, whom God
in the way of singular privilege invites to draw near him, promising
that he will be favorable to their prayers. Faith, there is no doubt,
lies idle and even dead without prayer, in which the spirit of adoption
shows and exercises itself, and by which we evidence that all his
promises are considered by us as stable and sure. The inestimable grace
of God, in short, towards believers, appears in this, that he exhibits
himself to them as a Father. As many doubts steal upon us when we pray
to God, and we either approach him with trembling, or fail by becoming
discouraged and lifeless, David declares it to be true without
exception, that God hears all who call upon him. At the same time, as
most men pervert and profane the method of calling upon God through
inventions of their own, the right manner of praying is laid down in the
next part of the verse, which is, that we should pray in truth. Although
men resort to God in a cold manner, or even in their prayers expostulate
with him, while their hearts are swelling with pride or with anger, they
yet complain that they are not heard; just as if there were no
difference between praying and quarreling, or the exercise of faith and
hypocrisy. The greater part of men, involved in infidelity, scarcely
believe that there is a God in heaven at all; others would banish him
from it if they could; others would tie him down to their views and,
wishes, while some seek slight and insufficient ways of reconciling him,
so that the common way of praying is but an idle and empty ceremony.
 <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) And although nearly all men
without exception have recourse to God in the time of their need, they
are few indeed who bring the smallest measure of faith or repentance. It
were better that the name of God should be buried in oblivion than
exposed to such insults. There is good reason, therefore, why truth
should be said to be necessary in our prayers — that they come from a
sincere heart. The falsehood, which is the opposite of this sincerity,
is of various kinds; indeed it were difficult to enumerate them —
infidelity, wavering, impatience, murmuring, pretended humility, in
short there are as many sorts of it as there are sinful dispositions.
The truth being one of no small importance, David again confirms and
enlarges upon it in the next verse. The repetition is worthy of our
particular notice, for such is our tendency to unbelief, that there are
few who in calling upon God do not look upon their prayers as fruitless.
Hence the perverse manner in which the wandering minds of men are tossed
hither and thither, as in the Papacy they invented patrons without
number, holding it of no importance almost to embrace with an unwavering
faith the promises by which God invites us to himself.

<span id="xxix.iv-p9"></span><span id="xxix.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.iv-p10"></span>To throw the door still more open, the
Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, tells us, that *God will accommodate
himself to the desires of all who fear him.* This is a mode of
expression of which it is difficult to say how much it ought to impress
our minds. Who is man, that God should show complaisance to his will,
when rather it is ours to look up to his exalted greatness, and humbly
submit to his authority? Yet he voluntarily condescends to these terms,
to obtemper our desires. At the same time, there is a check to be put
upon this liberty, and we have not a license of universal appetency, as
if his people might forwardly clamor for whatever their corrupt desires
listed, but before God says that he will hear their prayers, he enjoins
the law of moderation and submission upon their affections, as we learn
from John, —

<span id="xxix.iv-p11"></span>“We know that he will deny us nothing,  
if we seek it according to his will.” (<span
id="xxix.iv-p11.2"></span>[1Jo
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#014)<span id="xxix.iv-p11.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xxix.iv-p12"></span>For the same reason, Christ dictated that
form of prayer, “Thy will be done,” setting limits round us, that we
should not preposterously prefer our desires to those of God, nor ask
without deliberation what first comes into our mouth. David, in making
express mention of *them that fear God,* enjoins fear, reverence, and
obedience upon them before holding out the favorable indulgence of God,
that they might not think themselves warranted to ask more than his word
grants and approves. When he speaks of their cry, this is a kind of
qualification of what he had said. For God’s willingness to grant our
prayers is not always so apparent that he answers them at the very
moment they are made. We have, therefore, need of perseverance in this
trial of our faith, and our desires must be confirmed by crying. The
last clause — *he will save them* — is also added by way of correction,
to make us aware how far, and for what end God answers the prayers of
his people, namely, to evidence in a practical manner that he is the
faithful guardian of their welfare.

<span id="xxix.iv-p13"></span><span id="xxix.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxix.iv-p14"></span>**20.** *Jehovah preserves*, etc. He
insists upon the same truth, — that God is near to his people to help
them in the time of need; this being a sure proof of his presence, that
by his mercy they come safe and unhurt out of every danger which befalls
them. It is worthy of our notice, that, instead of fear, he now speaks
of love; for, in distinguishing believers by this title, *that they love
God*, he intimates it to be the root of true godliness, that they submit
themselves to him voluntarily, which again is the effect of faith. Till
God draw us by the attractions of his grace, this placid submission will
never follow. The love spoken of by David, however, is perhaps more
extensive, as God’s people not only attach themselves to him in the way
of obedience to his authority, but knowing that union to him is of all
other things most desirable, aspire with their whole soul after this
happiness. Still there can be no doubt, that the reference is to it here
as the chief part of holiness and righteousness, as was said by Moses,

<span id="xxix.iv-p15"></span>“And now, O Israel, what does the Lord thy
God require of thee,” etc. (<span id="xxix.iv-p15.1"></span>[De
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012.md)<span
id="xxix.iv-p15.1"></span>.)

<span id="xxix.iv-p16"></span>This effect of godliness in securing our
safety and preservation under the divine guardianship, David exemplifies
by an opposition clause, declaring, that all the wicked shall, in the
just judgment of God, miserably perish. That he might close as he had
begun, he again affirms, *that he will publish the praises of God*, and
urges all to the same duty by his example. Some would read, *every
living thing shall bless*, but this does not seem to me a proper
reading. When Moses, speaking of the flood, says, that “all *flesh* in
which was the breath of life perished,” I grant that the term
comprehends the brute creation, but wherever “flesh” is mentioned
without any addition, the reference is only to men. Nor is David here
stating what they would, but what they should do, declaring all men
bound by the great and inexhaustible goodness of God constantly and for
ever to praise him.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[275](cc12028.htm#fr_274.md) <span
id="xxix-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xxix-p4"></span> This Psalm is with much propriety entitled
“Praise of David;” for it is throughout a continued celebration of the
perfections and doings of God. It is certainly one of the most
interesting and beautiful of the compositions of the sweet singer of
Israel; and so high an opinion did the ancient Hebrews form of it that
they were wont to say — “Whoever utters this Psalm thrice each day with
the heart and tongue is a happy man, and shall infallibly enjoy the
blessings of the world to come.” The time and occasion of its
composition can only be conjectured. Dr. Morison thinks it probable that
it was composed by David when he and the nation of Israel obtained the
blessings which he implored in the preceding Psalm; and that it is that
new song which he purposed to sing (<span id="xxix-p4.1"></span>[Ps
144:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#009)<span id="xxix-p4.1"></span>.md)
when God appeared in glory for his chosen people. This is the last of
the alphabetical Psalms. The first verse commences with the first letter
of the Hebrew alphabet, the second verse with the second letter, and so
on to the close, with the exception that the hemistich of which <span
id="xxix-p4.2"></span>נ, *nun*, was the commencing letter is wanting.
The other alphabetical Psalms are <span id="xxix-p4.3"></span>[Psalm

Clarke had translated “*for ever and onward* in this and the coming
world.” “These sorts of expressions,” he adds, “are very difficult to be
translated.”

<span id="xxix.ii-p3"></span> After this verse two lines appear to have
been lost in the Hebrew text. The Psalm, as we have said before, is
alphabetical; and each stanza begins with a letter of the Hebrew
alphabet in regular order, till we come to <span
id="xxix.ii-p3.1"></span>[Ps
145:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014.md)<span id="xxix.ii-p3.1"></span>,
when a break — the only one in the Psalm — takes place. <span
id="xxix.ii-p3.2"></span>[Ps
145:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#013.md)<span id="xxix.ii-p3.2"></span>
begins with the letter <span id="xxix.ii-p3.3"></span>מ, *mem*, and
<span id="xxix.ii-p3.4"></span>[Ps
145:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#014.md)<span id="xxix.ii-p3.4"></span>
with the letter <span id="xxix.ii-p3.5"></span>ס, *samech*. Thus the
stanza beginning with the letter, <span id="xxix.ii-p3.6"></span>נ,
*nun*, is wanting. It is thus supplied in the Septuagint: <span
id="xxix.ii-p3.7"></span>Πιστὸς Κύριος ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς λόγοις αὐτοῦ καὶ
ὅσιος ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἔργοις αὐτοῦ. “Faithful is Jehovah in all his words,
and holy in all his works.” Dr. Adam Clarke, after observing that there
is not a verse answering to <span id="xxix.ii-p3.8"></span>נ, *nun*, in
any of the printed copies of the Hebrew Bible, states, that there is one
MS., now in Trinity College, Dublin, which has it thus (he supposes by
correction) at the bottom of the page:

<span id="xxix.ii-p4"></span><span id="xxix.ii-p4.1"></span>נאמּנ יהוה
בכל דבריו וצׂיד בכל מֵסיו

<span id="xxix.ii-p5"></span>Neeman Yehovah be-cal debaraiv; ve-chasid
be-cal maasaiv.

<span id="xxix.ii-p6"></span>This exactly corresponds with the reading
in the Septuagint. “Nothing,” says Dr. Lowth in Merrick’s Annotations on
the Psalms, “can be more certain than the genuineness of the verse <span
id="xxix.ii-p6.1"></span>נ which the Septuagint has preserved, varying
only in two words from <span id="xxix.ii-p6.2"></span>[Ps
145:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#017.md)<span
id="xxix.ii-p6.2"></span>.”

bonte de Dieu ne surmonte cest empeschement, c’est en vain que les
Prophetes traitteroyent de sa grace et misericorde.” — *Fr*.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[281](cc12028.htm#fr_280.md) <span

<span id="xxix.iii-p3"></span> “<span id="xxix.iii-p3.1"></span>נפלים
*nophelim*, *the falling*, or those who are not able to keep their feet
— the weak. He shores them up — he is their *prop*. No man falls through
his own weakness *merely*; if he rely on God, the strongest foe cannot
shake him.” — *Dr. Adam Clarke*
