<span id="iii-p1"></span>The Song of Moses

<span id="iii-p2"></span>It was the perverse nature of the people which
extorted from Moses that unmixed bitterness with which he again
addresses them. Doubtless he would have desired to leave a pleasing and
joyful recollection of himself, and therefore would willingly have
exhorted them to the performance of their duties, either with blandness,
or at any rate with placidity, but their stubbornness compelled him to
testify his indignation in the severity of his address. Besides, he does
not judge from conjecture what they would do, but expressly declares
that he knew it for certain, unquestionably because the Spirit, in
dictating the Song, had also informed him of it. He indicates their
revolt by two words, *corrupting,* and *turning aside from the way;*
but, inasmuch as in the first there is an ellipsis, for the active verb
is used without any word for it to govern, some supply “the way of the
Lord.” I have, however, followed a different reading,  <span
id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) which seems more correct, for the
signification of the word is rather passive than transitive. He points
out the manner of their corruption, declaring that they will depart from
the way which they had learned; for this was their perfect soundness, to
obey God, and to follow the way which he showed them. By forsaking the
Law, then, they were corrupted. Moreover, Moses indirectly reproves
their ingratitude, inasmuch as he had thrown away his labor upon such
despisers of pious instruction. Thus he desires that this song should be
recited by them, in order that, when afflicted and half-consumed by
miseries, they might at last learn that God is a just avenger. And the
advantage of this assurance was, that those, whose state was not
altogether desperate, should at length return to their senses; whilst
the reprobate should be more and more condemned.

<span id="iii-p4"></span>We have elsewhere seen what it is to call
heaven and earth to witness.  <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md)

<span id="iii-p3"></span> It is S.M. who has thought fit to fill out the
Hebrews idiom, by adding the words, “the way of the Lord.” *A. V*.
supplies *yourselves,* in its italics, as *C*. has done; but modern
critics would not call this “following a different reading.” — *W*.
