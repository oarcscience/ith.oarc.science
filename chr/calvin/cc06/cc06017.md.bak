<span id="ii.xvi-p3"></span>**1.** Titan we turned, and took our journey
into the wilderness, by the way of the Red sea, as the Lord spoke unto
me; and we compassed mount Stir many days.

<span id="ii.xvi-p4"></span>**1.** Postea reversi profecti sumus in
desertum per viam maris Suph, quemadmodum loquutus fuerat Jehova ad me,
et circumivimus montem Seir diebus multis.

<span id="ii.xvi-p6"></span>**1.** *Then we turned and took our
journey.* The time in which they struck their camp is not stated in the
book of Numbers. This verse, therefore, will aptly connect the history,
since otherwise there would be an abruptness in what immediately
follows, he then briefly indicates what was the nature of their
journeying until the time appointed; viz., that, by wearying themselves
in vain in circuitous wanderings, they might, at length, learn to follow
God directly, and not to decline from the way which He points out.
