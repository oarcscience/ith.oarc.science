<span id="ii.xxxix-p4"></span>**3.** Your eyes have scen what the Lord
did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the
Lord thy God hath destroyed them from among you.

<span id="ii.xxxix-p5"></span>**3.** Oculi vestri viderunt qum fecit
Jehova propter Baal-Peor, omnem enim hominem qui perrexerat post
Baal-Peor perdidit Jehova Deus tuus e medio tui.

<span id="ii.xxxix-p6"></span>**4.** But ye that did cleave unto the
Lord your God ave alive every one of you this day.

<span id="ii.xxxix-p7"></span>**4.** Vos autem qui adhaesistis Jehova
Deo vestro vivitis universi hodie.

<span id="ii.xxxix-p10"></span>**3.** *Your eyes have seen what the Lord
did.* This enlargement more clearly shews that so conspicuous was the
example given in the punishment, that it could not be hidden from even
the most ignorant; for Moses does not here address those of refined
judgment, but the common people generally, who had only been spectators.
Assuredly, if God’s vengeance had been less manifest, he would not have
so confidently appealed to them as witnesses; hence was their stolidity
the less excusable, if they were blind to so plain and notorious a fact.

<span id="ii.xxxix-p11"></span>His praise of their constancy I refer to
the present case alone; for it is abundantly clear that they did not
persevere in cleaving to God. The meaning is, that there was a manifest
discrimination in this Divine chastisement, so that the death of the
ungodly multitude should preserve the pure worship of God among the
survivors.
