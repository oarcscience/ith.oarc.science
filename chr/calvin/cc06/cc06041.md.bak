one shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered
of him.

<span id="ii.xl-p110"></span>**54.** Numerosiori dabis possessionem
majorem: et pauciori diminues possessionem suam: unicuique secundum
numeratos suos dabitur haereditas sua.

<span id="ii.xl-p115"></span>**57.** And these are they that were
numbered of the Levites, after their families: of Gershon, the family of

<span id="ii.xl-p119"></span>**59.** And the name of Amram’s wife was

<span id="ii.xl-p121"></span>**60.** And unto Aaron was born Nadab and

offered strange fire before the Lord.

<span id="ii.xl-p124"></span>**61.** Porro mortui sunt Nadab et Abihu
dum offerrent ignem alienum coram Jehova.

<span id="ii.xl-p125"></span>**62.** And those that were numbered of
them were twenty and three thousand, all males, from a month old and
upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because
there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.

<span id="ii.xl-p126"></span>**62.** Et fuerunt numerati eorum, viginti
tria millia: omnes mares filio mensis et supra: non enim numerati
ruerant inter filios Israel, quod data non sit illis haereditas inter
filios Israel.

<span id="ii.xl-p127"></span>**63.** These are they that were numbered
by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in
the plains of Moab, by Jordan, near Jericho.

<span id="ii.xl-p128"></span>**63.** Isti sunt numerati Mosis et Eleazar
sacerdotis, qui numeraverunt filios Israel in campestribus Moab juxta
Jordanem Jericho.

<span id="ii.xl-p129"></span>**64.** But among these there was not a man
of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the
children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai:

<span id="ii.xl-p130"></span>**64.** Inter istos autem non fuit quisquam
de numeratis Mosis et Aharon sacerdotis qui numeraverant filios Israel
in deserto Sinai.

<span id="ii.xl-p131"></span>**65.** For the Lord had said of them, They
shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of
them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

<span id="ii.xl-p132"></span>**65.** Dixerat enim Jehova de illis,
Moriendo morientur in deserto, et non fuit superstes ex eis quisquam,
nisi Caleb filius Jephuneh, et Josue filius Nun.

<span id="ii.xl-p133"></span> 

<span id="ii.xl-p134"></span><span id="ii.xl-p134.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p135"></span>**1.** *And it came to pass after the
plague.* This is the second *census* which we read of having been made
by Moses; nevertheless it is easy to perceive, from <span
id="ii.xl-p135.1"></span>[Exodus
38](../../../bib/kjv/exo038.htm#000.md)<span id="ii.xl-p135.1"></span>,
that it was at least the third; although it is more probable that either
yearly, or at stated times, those who had arrived at the age of twenty
gave in their names. Still the number of the people could not be thus
obtained, unless there were also a comparison of the deaths. This, at
any rate, is incontrovertible, that those who had grown up to manhood
were three times numbered in the desert, for we gather thus much from
the passage before us, since it is said in the fourth verse that this
enrolment was made “as the Lord had commanded Moses, and the children of
Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt;” from whence it is
plain not only that they followed as their rule the custom established
from the beginning, but that the *census* of the people was again taken,
as it had been in the wilderness of Sinai. From hence again a probable
conjecture may be made, that, from the time in which they came out from
thence, nothing similar had taken place in the interval. For Moses there
records how many talents were collected from the tribute of the people,
and mentions their number, viz., 603,550  <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) and he adds afterwards, when they
moved their camp from Mount Sinai, how the *census* was taken according
to God’s command; but I pass over this subject the more cursorily, as
having been already spoken of elsewhere.  <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md)

<span id="ii.xl-p138"></span>Now let us see with what object God desired
to have His people numbered before He led them into the possession of
the promised land. In less than forty years the whole generation of an
age for military service had perished: many had been carried off by
premature deaths; nay, a single scourge had lately destroyed 24,000; who
would not have thought that the people must have been diminished by a
fourth? We must then account it a remarkable miracle, that their numbers
should be found as great as they were before. It was a memorable proof
of God’s anger that only two of the 603,000 still survived; but that by
continued generation the people were so renewed, as that, at the
conclusion of the period, their posterity equalled their former number,
was the work of God’s inestimable grace. Thus, in that awful judgment
wherewith God punished His sinful people, the truth of His promise still
shone forth. It had been said to Abraham,

<span id="ii.xl-p139"></span>“I will multiply thy seed as the stars of
the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore,” (<span
id="ii.xl-p139.1"></span>[Ge
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017)<span id="ii.xl-p139.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="ii.xl-p140"></span>and it was by no means fitting that this
blessing should be obscured at the time, when the other part of the
promise was about to be fulfilled: “Unto thy seed will I give this
land.” (<span id="ii.xl-p140.1"></span>[Ge
12:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#007)<span id="ii.xl-p140.1"></span>;.md)
For, whilst the people had been instructed by punishments to fear God,
still they were not to lose the savor of His paternal favor. And thus
does God always temper His judgments towards His Church, so as in the
midst of His indignation to remember mercy, as Habakkuk says, (<span
id="ii.xl-p140.2"></span>[Hab 3:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.xl-p140.2"></span>.) This was the reason why the people was
numbered immediately after the plague, in order that it might be more
conspicuous that God had marvellously provided lest any diminution
should appear after the recent loss of so many men.

<span id="ii.xl-p141"></span><span id="ii.xl-p141.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p142"></span>**8** *And the sons of Pallu; Eliab.* The
curtailment which had occurred in the superior line is here introduced,
either in exaltation of God’s grace, because, notwithstanding so great a
loss, the tribe of Reuben was still numerous; or else to mark the cause
of its diminution, for it might otherwise have seemed strange that other
tribes exceeded in numbers that one whose founder and parent was Jacob’s
first-born. But when he has narrated how the two sons of Eliab had been
destroyed with their company, he briefly adverts to the clemency of God
towards the sons of Korah, in that He spared them. And surely this was
no common exercise of mercy not only to preserve them uninjured from the
calamity, but afterwards to raise up shoots from the accursed root, in
whom His spiritual riches might shine forth for the general advantage of
the Church: for we know what honorable mention is often made of this
family; and it is probable that certain of them were the authors of some
of the Psalms, and thus were endued with the Spirit of prophecy, when
possibly at that time none of the priests was possessed of this gift.
This is that profound abyss in the various and unequal judgments of God,
which it becomes us to adore with sober humility. Meanwhile, in a single
word, Moses hints at the reason why he repeats this same history,
whereby the formidable mode of their death might be held up as a
perpetual example: for the Hebrew word <span
id="ii.xl-p142.1"></span>נס, *nes,* which is primarily a standard  <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) or banner, is often used for some
portentous thing, which strikes men’s senses with astonishment, and at
the same time fills their minds with fear.

<span id="ii.xl-p144"></span><span id="ii.xl-p144.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p145"></span>**19.** *The sons of Judah were Er and
Onan.* Since the tribe of Judah was so numerous, Moses magnifies the
greatness of God’s grace by this circumstance, that of the three sons
which he begat, two perished in the land of Canaan, by whose loss he
might have appeared to be condemned to perpetual sterility. But the
climax of God’s unparalleled mercy was this, that although two of his
children were born of an incestuous connection, they grew up into so
great a people.

<span id="ii.xl-p146"></span><span id="ii.xl-p146.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p147"></span>**28.** *The sons of Joseph after their
families.* The comparison of the two tribes, which sprang from the same
head, is worthy of notice. By the fact that Manasseh was the father of
only one son,  <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) the prophecy of
Jacob, when he declared that the first-born should be inferior to his
younger brother Ephraim, began already to receive its accomplishment.
Nevertheless, God’s blessing extended far and wide for the increase of
his family, so that they exceeded the tribe of Reuben in number. But
further, though the larger number of children (<span
id="ii.xl-p148.2"></span>πολυτεκνία) in which the descendants of Ephraim
were superior, was a kind of type of his promised fecundity, still the
excellency and dignity, of which Jacob prophesied, was deferred to a
distant period; since in this respect the tribe of Ephraim was inferior
by about a third, whereas a more numerous issue had been promised him.
Although, therefore, God had not spoken in vain, yet the fulfillment of
His promise did not immediately appear.

<span id="ii.xl-p149"></span>In the tribe of Dan, however, the
incredible power of God was put forth. He was contemptible among his
brethren; and thence it was an extraordinary blessing accorded to him in
the shape of an honorable degree and name, when Jacob declares that “Dan
shall judge his people.” (<span id="ii.xl-p149.1"></span>[Ge
49:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#016)<span id="ii.xl-p149.1"></span>..md)
He is said to have begotten only one son; yet his posterity exceeds
64,000.

<span id="ii.xl-p150"></span><span id="ii.xl-p150.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p151"></span>**51.** *These are the numbered of the
children of Israel.* By this sum total, what I have above adverted to is
more clearly shewn, that amidst so many losses, and especially after the
terrible vengeance which God had recently executed, the race of Abraham
was preserved in an incredible manner, so that the fulfillment of the
promise might not be brought about only towards a small body of persons.
Nature itself and reason would have suggested that a few only should
enjoy the promised land; but if the inheritance had been restricted to a
small number of men, God’s promise would have lain, as it were, in
obscurity and concealment. Yet within thirty-eight years, during which
more than 603,000 men had fallen, God marvellously brought it to pass
that the same number of persons should still remain, some 2500 only
excepted. Assuredly they must be blind four times over, as it were, who
do not behold in this bright mirror God’s wonderful providence, and the
faithfulness of His gratuitous adoption, and His steadfastness in
keeping His promises. At the same time, that which I have already
referred to in Deuteronomy clearly appears, that those who survived,
were strikingly admonished by this great loss, that they should not fall
away at any time into superstition.

<span id="ii.xl-p152"></span><span id="ii.xl-p152.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p153"></span>**53.** *Unto these the land shall be
divided.* This must have had great influence towards encouraging
believers, when they gave in their names before God, and professed that
they were heirs of the land; since it was exactly the same as if they
actually had it in their grasp, when God called them to its certain
possession; for the demonstrative pronoun is used emphatically, lest
they should suppose that they were to be put off any longer, and that
what was promised them was still to be kept in store for their
posterity. The actual fulfillment, therefore, and immediate presence of
the thing is indicated, when God prescribes that the land was to be
divided to those who were just numbered, and whose names appeared in the
public registers. A proportionable mode of division is then enjoined, so
that their share should be distributed to every tribe according to the
number of their names. We now perceive that they were registered, and,
so to speak,  <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) *lustrated,* in
order that they might more earnestly bestir themselves to take
possession of the promised land.

<span id="ii.xl-p155"></span><span id="ii.xl-p155.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p156"></span>**57.** *And these are they that were
numbered of the Levites.* He treats separately of the tribe of Levi,
which God had dissevered from the rest of the people; and of the sons of
Levi, the last mentioned is Kohath, the founder of the sacerdotal
family. Hence we may probably conjecture that the law of primogeniture
was not regarded when God deigned to take the priests from thence. But
why Moses should expressly state the name of his mother, contrary to the
usual custom of Scripture, does not dearly appear; for it is not likely
that he did this as a distinction to his own family, because he at the
same time shews how he himself, as well as his children, was deprived of
the honor (of the priesthood,)  <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md)
in which certainly there is no appearance of ambition. It is more
probable, if the word *daughter* is literally taken, that he did not
conceal a disgraceful circumstance, in order to extol more highly the
indulgence of God; for, in this case, Moses and Aaron sprang of an
incestuous marriage, since Amram, their father, must have married his
aunt, which natural modesty forbade. It will, then, be rather an
ingenuous confession of family dishonor, than an ambitious boast. If we
inquire how this could have been tolerated, the answer will readily
suggest itself, that this license had so largely prevailed among the
oriental nations, that no one deemed that to be illicit which was in
such universal use. And this we shall presently see  <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) to be expressly referred to, when God,
by forbidding incestuous marriages, distinguishes His people from other
nations. It will be no matter of surprise, then, that those who were not
yet prohibited from doing so by the law of God, had followed the general
custom.

<span id="ii.xl-p159"></span><span id="ii.xl-p159.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p160"></span>**60.** *And unto Aaron was born Nadab.*
Since two of Aaron’s four sons were cut off by a sudden death, the
dignity of the high-priesthood, which depended on the life of two
persons, appeared to be endangered. And with this view Moses repeats the
history already given, in order that God’s wonderful providence might be
more clearly perceived in the preservation of this order, with which the
safety of the whole Church was connected. Unquestionably, unless other
families had been much more prolific, the whole tribe of Levi would have
consisted of very few persons; yet, if we come to compare them, their
fecundity will be incredible, inasmuch as 23,000 are numbered, whereas
the sacerdotal race issued from only two heads. But God exalts His
Church to pre-eminence by ways and means unknown to men, in order that
His power may be magnified in this weakness. Moreover, the cause of
their death is again recorded, that the priests, being admonished by
this warning, may not only more diligently beware of wilful sacrilege,
but also of error and negligence.

<span id="ii.xl-p161"></span><span id="ii.xl-p161.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p162"></span>**63.** *These are they that were
numbered.* The former registration was made by Aaron. The difference
between the two *census* is therefore specified, in order that Moses may
take occasion to commemorate God’s judgment, which can never be
sufficiently considered, that of 600,000, only two were found who had
survived to the term prescribed by God. If any should object that the
greater part would have died naturally, since they had arrived at their
thirtieth: fortieth, and even fiftieth year,  <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) and thus would have been some eighty
years old before the completion of the forty years, I admit that such is
the case; but many had not yet reached their twenty-fourth year. Nor can
we doubt but that not a few of them were younger than Caleb and Joshua,
whom we know to have been not only alive and well, but even strong and
vigorous for many years afterwards. At any rate, therefore, not old age,
but God’s vengeance, cut off half of them by an untimely death, as if he
had openly put forth his hand from heaven and smitten them. It is not
without reason, then, that Moses states that they were dead, as God had
pronounced; not merely that by the punishment inflicted upon them he may
inculcate upon us the fear of God, but also that we may learn to be
aroused in earnest by his threats.
