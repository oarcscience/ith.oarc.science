<span id="ii.xvii-p3"></span>**10.** And the son of an Israelitish
woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of
Israel; and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove
together in the camp:

<span id="ii.xvii-p4"></span>**10.** Egressus est autem filius mulieris
Israelitidis, qui erat filius viri AEgyptii, in medio filiorum Israel,
et jurgati sunt in castris ipsis filius Israelitidis et vir Israelita.

<span id="ii.xvii-p5"></span>**11.** And the Israelitish woman’s son
blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto
Moses: (and his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of
the tribe of Dan:)

<span id="ii.xvii-p6"></span>**11.** Et transfixit filius mulieris
Israelitidis nomen, et maledixit: ad duxeruntque eum ad Mosen: nomen
autem matris ejus erat Selomith filia Dibri, de tribu Dan.

<span id="ii.xvii-p7"></span>**12.** And they put him in ward, that the
mind of the Lord might be showed them.

<span id="ii.xvii-p8"></span>**12.** Et posuerunt eum in custodiam, ut
exponeret eis juxta sermonem Jehovse.

<span id="ii.xvii-p9"></span>**13.** And the Lord spoke unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="ii.xvii-p10"></span>**13.** Loquutus est autem Jehova ad
Mosen, dicendo:

<span id="ii.xvii-p11"></span>**14.** Bring forth him that hath cursed
without the camp, and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his
head, and let all the congregation stone him.

<span id="ii.xvii-p12"></span>**14.** Educ blasphemum extra castra, et
ponant omnes qui audierunt manus suas super caput ejus, et lapidet eum
universus coetus.

<span id="ii.xvii-p13"></span><span id="ii.xvii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xvii-p14"></span>**10.** *And the son of an Israelitish
woman.* In what year, and in what station in the desert this occurred,
is uncertain. I have, therefore, thought it advisable to couple together
two cases, which are not dissimilar. It is probable that between this
instance of punishment, and that which will immediately follow, there
was an interval of some time: but the connection of two similar
occurrences seemed best to preserve the order of the history; one of the
persons referred to having been stoned for profaning God’s sacred name
by wicked blasphemy, and the other for despising and violating the
Sabbath. It is to be observed that the crime of the former of these gave
occasion to the promulgation of a law, which we have expounded
elsewhere:  <span id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) in accordance with the
common proverb, Good laws spring from bad habits: for, after punishment
had been inflicted on this blasphemer, Moses ordained that none should
insult the name of God with impunity.

<span id="ii.xvii-p16"></span>It was providentially ordered by God that
the earliest manifestation of this severity should affect the son of an
Egyptian: for, inasmuch as God thus harshly avenged the insult of His
name upon the offspring of a foreigner and a heathen, far less excusable
was impiety in Israelites, whom God had, as it were, taken up from their
mothers’ womb, and had brought them up in His own bosom. It is true,
indeed, that on his mother’s side he had sprung from the chosen people,
but, being begotten by an Egyptian father, he could not be properly
accounted an Israelite. If, then, there had been any room for the
exercise of pardon, a specious reason might have been alleged why
forgiveness should be more readily extended to a man of an alien and
impure origin. The majesty of God’s name, however, was ratified by his
death. Hence it follows that it is by no means to be permitted that
God’s name should be exposed with impunity to blasphemies among the sons
of the Church.

<span id="ii.xvii-p17"></span>We may learn from this passage that during
their tyrannical oppression many young women married into the Egyptian
nation, in order that their affinity might protect their relatives from
injuries. It might, however, have been the case that love for his wife
attracted the father of this blasphemer into voluntary exile, unless,
perhaps, his mother might have been a widow before the departure of the
people, so as to be at liberty to take her son with her.

<span id="ii.xvii-p18"></span>To *proceed,* he is said to have “gone
out,” not outside the camp, but in public, so that he might be convicted
by witnesses; for he would not have been brought to trial if his crime
had been secretly committed within the walls of his own house. This
circumstance is also worthy of remark, that, although the blasphemy had
escaped him in a quarrel, punishment was still inflicted upon him; and
assuredly it is a frivolous subterfuge to require that blasphemies
should be pardoned on the ground that they have been uttered in anger;
for nothing is more intolerable than that our wrath should vent itself
upon God, when we are angry with one of our fellow-creatures. Still it
is usual, when a person is accused of blasphemy, to lay the blame on the
ebullition of passion, as if God were to endure the penalty whenever we
are provoked.

<span id="ii.xvii-p19"></span>The verb <span
id="ii.xvii-p19.1"></span>נקב, *nakab,* which some render to *express,*
is here rather used for to curse, or to transfix; and the metaphor is an
appropriate one, that God’s name should be said to be transfixed, when
it is insultingly abused.  <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md)

<span id="ii.xvii-p21"></span><span id="ii.xvii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xvii-p22"></span>**13.** *And the Lord spoke unto Moses.*
It must be remembered, then, that this punishment was not inflicted upon
the blasphemer by man’s caprice, or the headstrong zeal of the people,
but that Moses was instructed by Divine revelation what sentence was to
be pronounced. It has been elsewhere stated  <span
id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) why God would have malefactors slain by
the hands of the witnesses. Another ceremony is here added, viz., that
they should lay their hands upon his head, as if to throw the whole
blame upon him.
