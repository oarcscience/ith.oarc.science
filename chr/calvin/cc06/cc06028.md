<span id="ii.xxvii-p3"></span>**6.** And the children of Israel took
their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there
Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in
the priest's office in his stead.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p4"></span>**6.** Filii autem Israel profecti sunt de
Beeroth filiorem Jaacan in Moserah: illic mortus est Aharon, et illic
sepultus est, functusque est sacerdotio Eleazar filius ejus pro eo.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p5"></span>**7.** From thence they journeyed unto
Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p6"></span>**7.** Inde profecti sunt in Gudgodah, et
de Gudgodah in Jobath terram torrentium aquarum.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p7"></span><span id="ii.xxvii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxvii-p8"></span>**6.** *And the children of Israel.* Since
it is not the design of Moses to specify the stations here, as he does
in <span id="ii.xxvii-p8.1"></span>[Nu
33](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#000.md)<span id="ii.xxvii-p8.1"></span>,
but only to mark the place in which Aaron died, I have therefore thought
fit to connect what we read here with the preceding narrative. In the
death of Aaron, they might recognize the punishment of their own
rebellion. But that Eleazar should be substituted in his place, was a
sign of the paternal grace of God, who did not suffer them to be
deprived of this blessing. This succession, too, was to be a perpetual
rule for the future, so that the sacerdotal dignity, according to God’s
prescription, should remain in that family.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p9"></span>He here specifies the names of certain
places, which he omits in the passage above cited; for he there states
that the Israelites went straight from Kadesh-barnea to Mount Hor; and
then makes them pass on to Zalmonah and Punon, perhaps because the
places had different names, or because they did not pitch their camp in
Gudgodah, or Jotbath; although the advantages of the spot might have
invited them to stop in a well-watered valley, for it is called “the
land of torrents,” through which an abundance of water flowed.

<span id="ii.xxvii-p10"></span>I do not advert to what every reader will
readily observe for himself, that in the discourse of Moses the order of
the history is inverted; for he says that the Levites were separated
from the rest of the people, after the death of Aaron.
