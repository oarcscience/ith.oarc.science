<span id="ii.xv-p3"></span>**22.** And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at
Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the Lord to wrath.

<span id="ii.xv-p4"></span>**22.** Et in Taberah et in Massah, et in
Cibroth Hatthaavah ad iram provocastis Jehovam.

<span id="ii.xv-p5"></span>**23.** Likewise, when the Lord sent you from
Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given
you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God, and
ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.

<span id="ii.xv-p6"></span>**23.** Et quum misisset vos Jehova de Cades
Barnea, dicendo: Ascendite, et possidete terram quam dedi vobis,
rebellastis verbo Jehovae Dei vestri, neque credidistis ei, neque
obedivistis voci ejus.

<span id="ii.xv-p7"></span>**24.** Ye have been rebellious against the
Lord from the day that I knew you.

<span id="ii.xv-p8"></span>**24.** Rebelles fuistis Jehovae a die qua
cognovi vos.

<span id="ii.xv-p9"></span><span id="ii.xv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xv-p10"></span>**22.** *And at Taberah.* He briefly adverts
to several cases whereby he may convince the people of ingratitude and
persevering obstinacy, and thus of a corrupt nature: for it is just as
if he had said, that they had been rebellious against God not once only,
nor in one particular way, but that they had heaped together many
offences, so that it was wonderful that God had so often pardoned them.
He also recounts the names given to the places as memorials of their
sins, in order that they may at length cease to transgress, since,
although so often provoked, God had borne with them already too long.
