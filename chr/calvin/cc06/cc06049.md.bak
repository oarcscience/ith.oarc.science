<span id="ii.xlviii-p3"></span>**1.** And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="ii.xlviii-p4"></span>**1.** Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen,
dicendo:

<span id="ii.xlviii-p5"></span>**2.** Command the children of Israel,
and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan, (this is the
land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of
Canaan, with the coasts thereof,)

<span id="ii.xlviii-p6"></span>**2.** Praecipe filiis Israel, et dices
eis, Quum intraveritis terram Chenaan (ista est terra quae cadet vobis
in haereditatem, terra Chenaan per terminos suos.)

<span id="ii.xlviii-p7"></span>**3.** Then your south quarter shall be
from the wilderness of Zin, along by the coast of Edom, and your south
border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p8"></span>**3.** Erit vobis plaga meridiei a
deserto Sin usque ad terminos Edom: erit inquam vobis terminus meridiei
ab extremo maris salis ad orientem.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p9"></span>**4.** And your border shall turn from
the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going
forth thereof shall be from the south to Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on
to Hazar-addar and pass on to Azmon.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p10"></span>**4.** Et circuibit vobis iste terminus
a Maale Acrabim, et transibit usque ad Sin: et erunt egressus ejus a
meridie in Cades-Barnea, atque illinc egredietur ad villam Addar, et
transibit usque ad Asmon.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p11"></span>**5.** And the border shall fetch a
compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it
shall be at the sea.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p12"></span>**5.** Praeterea circuibit terminus iste
ab Asmon usque ad flumen Aegypti: et erunt illinc egressus ejus ad
occidentum.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p13"></span>**6.** And as for the western border, ye
shall even have the great sea for a border: this shall be your west
border.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p14"></span>**6.** Terminum autem occidentalis erit
vobis mare magnum, terminus, inquam, iste erit vobis terminus
occidentalis.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p15"></span>**7.** And this shall be your north
border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you mount Hor.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p16"></span>**7.** Iste vero erit vobis terminus
aquilonaris, a mari magno describetis vobis Hor montem.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p17"></span>**8.** From mount Hor ye shall point out
your border unto the entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the
border shall be to Zedad.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p18"></span>**8.** Ab hoc monte describetis usque ad
introitum Hamach: et erunt eggressus termini illius ad Sedad.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p19"></span>**9.** And the border shall go on to
Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be
your north border.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p20"></span>**9.** Et illinc egredietur terminus
iste ad Ziphon, eruntque egressus ejus ad villam Enan: iste erit vobis
terminus aquilonaris.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p21"></span>**10.** And ye shall point out your east
border from Hazar-enan to Shepham.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p22"></span>**10.** Describetis praeterea vobis
terminum ad orientem, a villa Enan usque ad Sepham.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p23"></span>**11.** And the coast shall go down from
Shepham to Riblah, on the east of Ain; and the border shall descend, and
shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p24"></span>**11.** Et destendet iste terminus a
Sepham usque ad Riblah ab oriente Ain: et descendet terminus iste,
provenietque ad latus maris Cinnereth ad orientem.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p25"></span>**12.** And the border shall go down to
Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be
your land, with the coasts thereof round about.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p26"></span>**12.** Et descendet iste terminus ad
Jordanem, erunt que egressus ejus ad mare salis: ista erit vobis terra
per terminos suos, per circuitum.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p27"></span>**13.** And Moses commanded the children
of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which
the Lord commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p28"></span>**13.** Praecepit autem Moses filiis
Israel, dicendo: Haec est terra quam possidebitis sorte, et quam
princepit Jehova dare novem tribubus, et dimidiae tribui.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p29"></span>**14.** For the tribe of the children of
Reuben, according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the
children of Gad, according to the house of their fathers, have received
their inheritance, and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their
inheritance:

<span id="ii.xlviii-p30"></span>**14.** Acceperunt enim tribus filiorum
Rubenitarum per domos patrum suorum, et tribus filiorum Gaditarum per
domos patrum suorum, et dimidia tribus Manasse: acceperunt inquam
haereditatem suam:

<span id="ii.xlviii-p31"></span>**15.** The two tribes and the
half-tribe have received their inheritance on this side Jordan near
Jericho eastward, toward the sun-rising.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p32"></span>**15.** Duae tribus et dimidia
acceperunt possessionem suam citra Jordanera Jericho ad orientem ad
exortum solis.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p33"></span>**16.** And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="ii.xlviii-p34"></span>**16.** Loquutus est praeterea Jehova ad
Mosen, dicendo:

<span id="ii.xlviii-p35"></span>**17.** These are the names of the men
which shall divide the land unto you; Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the
son of Nun.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p36"></span>**17.** Ista sunt nomina virorum qui
possidendam vobis distribuent terram, Eleazar sacerdos, et Josue filius
Nun.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p37"></span>**18.** And ye shall take one prince of
every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p38"></span>**18.** Et principes singulos de
qualibet tribu capietis ad possidendam terram.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p39"></span>**19.** And the names of the men are
these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb, the son of Jephunneh.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p40"></span>**19.** Ista sunt nomina virorun: de
tribu Jehudah, Caleb filius Jephune.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p61"></span> 

<span id="ii.xlviii-p62"></span><span id="ii.xlviii-p62.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlviii-p63"></span>**1.** *And the Lord spake unto Moses.*
God here undertakes the office of a prudent and careful father of a
family, in fixing the boundaries of the land on every side, lest their
right to posses it should ever be called in question. He begins on the
southern side, where it must be observed that the district of Bashan is
included in it, and all that the Israelites had acquired before their
passage of the Jordan, so that this addition was approved of by God. He
extends this part as far as the wilderness of Sin, and the borders of
Edom, and brings it round from Kadesh-barnea to Addar, and the passage
of Azmon, and, finally, to the stream which washes  <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md) the city of Rhinocorura, in the
immediate vicinity of Egypt; for by “the river of Egypt” the Nile is by
no means to be understood, the course of which was not at all in that
direction. The southern boundary, therefore, was from the Mediterranean
Sea towards Arabia. On the western side the land was washed by the
Mediterranean Sea, which is here called “the Great Sea,” in comparison
with the Lake of Gennesareth, and the Salt Sea, by which name the *Lacus
Asphaltires* is here meant. The beginning of the northern boundary was
the promontory of Hor, for it would not accord to suppose that the
mountain is here referred to in which Aaron died, and which was far
away, and situated on the opposite side of the land. It extended from
hence to Epiphania in Syria, which is called Hamath; for I agree with
Jerome in thinking that there were two cities of this name, and it is
undoubtedly probable that Antioch is called “Hamath the great” by the
Prophet Amos (<span id="ii.xlviii-p64.1"></span>[Am
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/amo006.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.xlviii-p64.1"></span>,) in comparison with the lesser city here
mentioned, the name of which was given it by that wicked and cruel
tyrant (Antiochus) Epiphanes; whether, however, the greater Antioch was
formerly called Hamath and Riblab, as Jerome states, I leave undecided.
It then passed on to Zedad and Ziphron, and its extremity was the
village of Enan. The eastern boundary passed from thence through
Shephan, Riblah, and Ain, until it reached the Lake of Gennesareth, a
lake sufficiently well known, and here called the Sea of Chinnereth.
Thus the eastern boundary pointed from Arabia in the direction of
Persia, and Babylon was situated to the north-east of it.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p65"></span><span id="ii.xlviii-p65.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlviii-p66"></span>**13.** *And Moses commanded the
children of Israel.* Though this is a repetition, yet it is not a
superfluous one; for he contrasts the new allotment of the nine tribes
and a half with the former grant;  <span
id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) for the exception, which is
immediately added, as to the lands beyond Jordan, given to the
Reubenites, and Gadites, and half tribe of Manasseh, does not exclude
them from their part of the promised inheritance was if they were
disinherited, and therefore banished beyond the boundaries prescribed by
God — but only from being subject to the casting of lots, because they
had by special privilege obtained from their brethren what would else
have been included in the common inheritance. Not that this had been
revealed from the beginning, but because God in His indulgence had
complied with their request, whereby they enlarged the boundaries of the
land. And assuredly it would have been absurd that no place should be
given them among their brethren in the promised land, as if they were
cast off from the family of Abraham. We have lately seen that this part,
which seemed to be separated from the others, was included in the limits
laid down by God. Moses, therefore, merely wished to declare that what
remained was to be divided by lot.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p68"></span><span id="ii.xlviii-p68.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlviii-p69"></span>**16** *And the Lord spake unto Moses.*
The question here arises, if the Israelites were to divide the land
among themselves by lot, wherefore was the authority of the judges
required, as if there was anything for them to decide? But if we
consider what has been lately shown, that reference was to be had, in
the distribution of the land, to the numbers in every tribe, it was
requisite for two purposes, — first, that God might show by His decree
the districts respectively assigned to them; and, secondly, that their
dimensions might be proportionate to the number of their occupants. For
the casting of lots was still necessary, because many would have been
averse to the sea-coast, or would have preferred the center of the land
to its extremities, or would have been unwilling to be banished to the
mountains; in short, they would have contended with each other beyond
measure in murmurings and strife. On this account the lots were cast, by
the decision of which God placed the several tribes in whatever position
He pleased, although the judges, together with the High Priest and
Joshua, had before divided the land into ten portions. But after it was
declared in what district the several tribes were to dwell, as if God
had there designated their abodes, the determination of men was again
necessarily had recourse to, as to how far, and in what direction, the
boundaries of the greater tribes were to extend; otherwise the lesser
tribes would have refused to be cooped up in a less convenient position.
And although the supreme authority was justly vested in Eleazar and
Joshua, lest God should expose them to calumny and ill-will, He
associated with them a council, in which also there was a prudent
precaution against rivalry, for each of the twelve tribes contributed
its judge to preside over the distribution, so that none might complain
of being aggrieved. Moreover, inasmuch as it was of great importance
that the possession, once established, should be secured to posterity,
first of all the names of the princes are recorded, in order to give
certainty to the history; and, secondly, as had been stated at the
beginning of the chapter, so also it is repeated at the end that they
were chosen by God, from whence the Israelites learnt that the
boundaries then fixed could not be altered without overthrowing the
authority of God Himself.

<span id="ii.xlviii-p64"></span> There has been much discussion amongst
the commentators on this point. The conclusion to which Dr. Kitto comes,
after due examination of the opposite theory, is, that “the river of
Egypt,” when mentioned as a boundary, cannot mean the Nile. “The present
‘river of Egypt’ (he adds) probably denotes a stream which formed the
extreme boundary of the country eastward of the Nile, which Egypt, even
in these early times, professed to claim, and which derived its name
from that circumstance. It was probably not far from El-Arish, to which,
under the name of Rhinocorura, it is expressly referred by the
Septuagint. That it was a stream somewhere between the southern frontier
of Palestine and the Nile we are deeply convinced.” — Illustr. Com.,
