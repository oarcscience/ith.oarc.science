<span id="ii.xxv-p3"></span>**23.** And the Lord spoke unto Moses and
Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying,

<span id="ii.xxv-p4"></span>**23.** Dixit autem Jehova ad Mosen et
Aharon in monte Hor, in finibus terrae Edom, dicendo:

<span id="ii.xxv-p5"></span>**24.** Aaron shall be gathered unto his
people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the
children of’ Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of
Meribah.

<span id="ii.xxv-p6"></span>**24.** Congregabitur Aharon ad populos
suos.: Non enim ingredietur terram quam dedi filiis Israel: eo quod
rebelles fueritis ori meo in aquis jurgii.

<span id="ii.xxv-p7"></span>**25.** Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and
bring them up unto mount Hor;

<span id="ii.xxv-p8"></span>**25.** Accipe Aharon et Eleazar filium
ejus, et ascendere fac eos in Hor montem.

<span id="ii.xxv-p9"></span>**26.** And strip Aaron of his garments, and
put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his
people, and shall die there.

<span id="ii.xxv-p10"></span>**26.** Tunc exues Aharon vestibus suis,
quibus indues Eleazar filium ejus: quia Aharon colligetar, et morietur
ibi.

<span id="ii.xxv-p11"></span>**27.** And Moses did as the Lord
commanded: and they went up into mount Hor, in the sight of all the
congregation.

<span id="ii.xxv-p12"></span>**27.** Fecitque Moses quemadmodum
praeperat Jehova. Et ascenderunt in Hor montem in oculis totius
congregationis.

<span id="ii.xxv-p13"></span>**28.** And Moses stripped Aaron of his
garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; mid Aaron died there in the
top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

<span id="ii.xxv-p14"></span>**28.** Et exuit Moses Aharon vestibus
suis, et induit illis Eleazar filium ejus, mortuusque est Aharon ibi in
vertice montis. Tunc descendit Moses et Eleazar de monte.

<span id="ii.xxv-p15"></span>**29.** And when all the congregation saw
that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the
house of Israel.

<span id="ii.xxv-p16"></span>**29.** Videns autem tota congregatio quod
obiisset Aharon, fleverunt eum triginta diebus tota domus Israel.

<span id="ii.xxv-p17"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxv-p18"></span><span id="ii.xxv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxv-p19"></span>**23.** *And the Lord spoke unto Moses.*
First of all, in the death of Aaron, we must consider the execution of
the sentence, whereby he had been condemned; for God wished to show that
He had not threatened either him or Moses in vain, with what then
occurred, as children are wont to be threatened. If Aaron had died
without any such prediction, since he might have seemed from his extreme
age to have but discharged the debt of nature, as it is called, the
people might have been so overcome by their grief, as to have no
inclination to proceed. But now, when, in the death of one man, the
condemnation of their public and common guilt is clearly manifested,
such great severity on God’s part against the high-priest, who had
before propitiated God towards them all by his intercession, must have
been a very sharp spur to them all. For it must needs have suggested
itself to them, that God was no longer to be trifled with, before whom
not even this sacred dignity could escape punishment. This was the
reason why Aaron was called forth to die in the sight of all, that the
survivors might learn to live to God, inasmuch as He instructed them to
obey by this notable example. For the rebuke is added not so much for
the sake of Moses and Aaron, viz., that they should not enter the land,
because they had been rebellious against God’s word, as that the people
might perceive that they deserved to perish ten times over; since, by
their contumacy, they had exasperated the holy men, so that in the
excess of their zeal they had almost fallen away from the faith.

<span id="ii.xxv-p20"></span><span id="ii.xxv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxv-p21"></span>**25.** *Take Aaron and Eleazar his son.*
Aaron’s successor was to be designated whilst he was himself still
living; first of all, that the perpetuity of the priesthood might be
secured; and, secondly, lest the people, with their usual temerity,
should take upon themselves the election in a matter depending on the
will of God, alone. For, unless Eleazar had been appointed priest whilst
his father was yet alive, the office itself might fall into disesteem,
since the high dignity of any individua! is often odious. Lest,
therefore, their perverse envy might impel them to repudiate the
priesthood, God anticipates them, and provides that religion, which
ought to be perpetual, should not perish together with the men. Again,
we know how great was the audacity of this people in innovation; lest,
then, they should, at their own caprice, take to themselves a priest
from another tribe, it was well that he of whom God approved, should be
firmly established, so as to be received without controversy as the true
and lawful one. In this matter an external symbol was made use of, in
that Eleazar was invested with the sacred garments; nor does this refer
to the shirt, or the slippers, but to the sacerdotal ornaments. The
effect, therefore, of this ceremony was as if Aaron should resign the
office, which he had discharged till that day, to his son. Moreover, it
is worthy of observation that Aaron not only voluntarily cedes his
dignity, but his life also. By this proof his faith was confirmed, for
had he not been persuaded that an inheritance was laid up for him in
heaven, he would not have so calmly migrated from the world. Since,
however, he composes himself to die, just as if he were but lying down
on his bed, it is altogether beyond a doubt that his mind was lifted up
to the hope of a blessed resurrection, from whence arises a cheerful
readiness to die. And it is probable that his faith was elevated and
strengthened when he saw that the testimony of God’s grace, on which the
safety of the people depended, was made to rest upon the person of his
son. For it was exactly as if the image of the Mediator were set visibly
before his eyes. This consolation, then, being of no ordinary character,
rendered him superior to the terrors of death. Meanwhile, Eleazar
succeeded, in the presence of the people, so that his authority might
not hereafter be exposed to their murmurs.

<span id="ii.xxv-p22"></span><span id="ii.xxv-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxv-p23"></span>**29.** *And when all the congregation
saw.* This has been an error common to almost all nations and ages, but
which reigned peculiarly amongst the people of Israel — to pay due honor
to God’s holy servants, rather after their deaths than in their lives.
They had frequently wished to stone Aaron; they had raised great
tumults, in order to cast him down from the dignity in which God had
placed him; now, forgetting their malignity and envy, they lament for
him when dead.

<span id="ii.xxv-p24"></span>The question, however, occurs, whether the
mourning for a month, which is here recorded, was praiseworthy or not?
But it could not be otherwise than improper, inasmuch as it was a means
of aggravating their grief; for men are naturally only too much inclined
to excessive grief, even although they do not indulge it; and besides,
the hope of a better life avails to mitigate sorrow. Hence we infer,
that those are endued with scarcely any taste of eternal salvation, who
give way to immoderate grief. But, since believers have another cause
for mourning, i.e., to exercise themselves both in the fear of God, and
in the hope and desire of the future resurrection, this solemn mourning
has not been unreasonably received as a general custom. Since death is a
mirror of God’s curse upon the whole human race, it is profitable for
us, whenever any of our belongings dies, to mourn our common lot, so as
to humble ourselves beneath God’s hand. Besides, if mourning is directed
to its proper end, it in a manner unites the living with the dead; so
that in death itself the communion of the new and immortal life shines
forth. And further, the weakness of the ancient people had need of being
propped and supported by such aids as this; for, amidst their dark
shadows, it would not have been easy to rise above the world, unless
they had been taught that the dead still belonged to them, and that
there remained some bond of connection between them. But if the utility
(of this custom) be corrupted by its abuse, it is not just that what is
right in itself should be blamed for the fault of men.
