<span id="ii.xxxviii-p3"></span>**1.** And Israel abode in Shittim, and
the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p4"></span>**1.** Postquam autem mansit Israel in
Sittim, coepit populus scortari eum filiabus Moab.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p5"></span>**2.** And they called the people unto
the sacrifices of their gods: and the people did eat, and bowed down to
their gods.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p6"></span>**2.** Et vocaverunt populum ad
sacrificia deorum suorum, comeditque populus, et adoraverunt deos earum.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p7"></span>**3.** And Israel joined himself unto
Baal-peor: and the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p8"></span>**3.** Et adjunxit sese Israel ipsi
Baal-peor, accensusque est furor Jehovae contra Israelem.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p9"></span>**4.** And the Lord said unto Moses,
Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord
against the sun, that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away
from Israel.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p10"></span>**4.** Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Assume
omnes principes populi, tunc suspende eos Jehowe, coram sole: et
avertetur ira excandescentiae Jehovae ab Israele.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p11"></span>**5.** And Moses said unto the judges
of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baal-peor.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p12"></span>**5.** Dixit ergo Moses ad judices
Israel, Occidite quisque viros suos qui adjunxerunt se ipsi Baal-peor.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p13"></span>**6.** And, behold, one of the children
of Israel came, and brought unto his brethren a Midianitish woman, in
the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the
children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p14"></span>**6.** Et ecce, quidam de filiis Israel
venit, et adduxit fratribus suis Madianitidem in oculis Mosis atque in
oculis tedus congregationis filiorum Israel: ipsi autem flebant ad
ostium tabernaculi conventionis.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p15"></span>**7.** And when Phinehas, the son of
Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the
congregation, and took a javelin in his hand;

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p16"></span>**7.** Quod quum vidisset Phinees
filius Eleazar filii Aharon sacerdotis, surrexit de medio
congregationis, et accepit lanceam in manu sua.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p17"></span>**8.** And he went after the man of
Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them through, the man of
Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the plague was stayed from
the children of Israel.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p18"></span>**8.** Ingressusque est post virum
Israel in tabernaculum, et transfixit ambos ipsos, virum Israel et
mulierem illam in ventre ejus: et repressa fuit plaga a filiis Israel.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p19"></span>**9.** And those that died in the
plague were twenty and four thousand.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p20"></span>**9.** Et mortui sunt plaga ilia
quatuor et viginti millia.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p21"></span>**10.** And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p22"></span>**10.** Tunc loquutus est Jehova ad
Mosen, dicendo:

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p23"></span>**11.** Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children
of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed
not the children of Israel in my jealousy.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p24"></span>**11.** Phinees filias Eleazar filii
Aharon sacerdotis avertit excandescentiam meam a filiis Israel, quum
zelatus est ipse zelum meum in medio eorum, et non consumpsi filios
Israel in zelo meo.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p25"></span>**12.** Wherefore say, Behold, I give
unto him my covenant of peace:

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p26"></span>**12.** Idcirco dic, Ecce, ego do ei
pactum meum, pacis.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p27"></span>**13.** And he shall have it, and his
seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because
he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of
Israel.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p28"></span>**13.** Et erit ei et semini ejus post
eum, pactum sacerdotii perpetui, eo quod zelatus est pro Deo suo, et
expiavit filios Israel.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p29"></span>**14.** Now the name of the Israelite
that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was
Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p30"></span>**14.** Porro nomen viri Israel
percussi, qui percussus est cum Madianitide, erat Zimri filius Salu,
princeps familiae tribus Simeon.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p31"></span>**15.** And the name of the Midianitish
woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur: he was head over a
people, and of a chief house in Midian.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p32"></span>**15.** Nomen vero mulieris occisae
Madianitidis Chozbi filia Sur, principis populorum; princeps domus
paternae in Madian erat.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p33"></span>**16.** And the Lord spake unto Moses,
saying,

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p34"></span>**16.** Loquutus est autem Jehova ad
Mosen, dicendo:

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p35"></span>**17.** Vex the Midianites, and smite
them:

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p36"></span>**17.** Angustiis affice Madianitas, et
percutias eos:

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p37"></span>**18.** For they vex you with their
wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in
the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister,
which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor’s sake.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p38"></span>**18.** Quia ipsi affiixerunt vos
fraudibus suis, quibus fraudulenter egerunt contra vos in negotio Peor,
et in negotio Chozbi filiae principis Madian sororis suae, quae percussa
est in die plagae propter Peor.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p39"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p40"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p40.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p41"></span>**1** *And Israel abode in Shittim.*
From this narrative we learn assuredly that the people were no more able
to bear prosperity than adversity. Heretofore, either worn out by
fatigue, or rendered impatient by abstinence and famine, they had often
rebelled against God; now, when they have entered a habitable land, and
are resting in the midst of fruitful fields, they are incited by their
more comfortable dwelling-places, and more pleasant mode of life, to
lasciviousness, and the indulgence of filthy lusts. Moses relates how,
when they had given way to their lust, they fell at the same time into
whoredom and idolatry. We shall presently see that this arose from the
counsel of Balaam, that the Moabites should prostitute their women to
the Israelites, in order to entice them by their blandishments to unholy
worship. Balaam had learnt by experience that God’s favor was an
invincible safeguard to protect the people from all injury. He,
therefore, invents a plan whereby they may destroy themselves, by not
only depriving themselves of God’s protection, but also by provoking His
wrath against them. By this fan, then, Balaam stirred up the fire, which
impelled these poor wretches, inflamed by blind lechery, to another
crime, by which they might arouse against themselves the enmity of God.
Consequently Paul, referring to this history, informs us that the
punishment, which will be mentioned immediately, was inflicted upon them
for fornication. (<span id="ii.xxxviii-p41.1"></span>[1Co
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.xxxviii-p41.1"></span>.) For, although it was God’s design to
avenge the violation of His worship, still it is fitting to examine into
the origin and source of the evil. Just as, if a drunken man has killed
a person, the murder will be imputed to his drunkenness, so Paul, seeing
the Israelites impelled by fornication to idolatry, sets before us the
punishment as a warning to deter us from fornication, which was the
primary cause of their chastisement, and the means of their corruption.
Since, then, the fall from one sin to another is so easy, let us hence
learn to be more watchful, lest Satan should entangle us in his snares.
Let us also observe that he creeps upon us by degrees in order to entrap
us. The Moabitish damsels did not straightway solicit the Israelites to
worship their idols, but first invite them to their banquets, and thus
tempt them to idolatry; for, if mention had been made at first of
idol-worship, perhaps they might have shuddered at the atrocity of the
crime, to which they allowed themselves to be beguiled by degrees. Now,
to be present at a feast which was celebrated in honor of false gods,
was a kind of indirect renunciation of the true God; and when they had
been attracted thus far, they threw aside all shame, and abandoned
themselves to that extreme act whereby they transfer the honor due only
to the one true God, to false and imaginary deities.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p42"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p43"></span>**3.** *AndIsrael joined himself to
Baal-peor.* Moses amplifies their crime by this expression, that they
bound themselves to the idol in an impious alliance; and thus he alludes
to that holy union whereby God had connected Himself with the people,
and accuses them of broken faith and wicked rebellion. Nevertheless, it
is probable that the people were not impelled by superstition, but
enticed by the wiles of the women to offer worship to idols which they
despised. Yet we are told how God declared that they were “joined” to
the idol, which they merely pretended to worship, in order to comply
with the ungodly wishes of the women. Hence, therefore, this general
instruction may be gathered, that when we turn aside from pure religion,
we in a manner connect ourselves with idols, so as to coalesce in one
body with them, and conspire to renounce the true God.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p44"></span>Baal was then the general name of
almost all idols; but all epithet is added to the idol of the Moabites,
taken from Mount Peor; nor does it appear that we need go in quest of
any other etymology, since the name of this mountain has recently been
mentioned. It was on the same principle as in Popery, when they name
their Marys after particular places,  <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) where the most famous statues are
worshipped.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p46"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p46.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p47"></span>**4.** *And the Lord said unto Moses.*
We have often seen before how God executed His judgments by His own
hand, as if He put it forth from heaven; He now imposes this office on
Moses, although it is evident from the context that he was not appointed
to execute it alone, but that the other judges were associated with him;
for it immediately follows that Moses intrusted the same charge to them,
and thus, what was obscure, on account of the brevity with which it is
recorded, is more clearly expressed. At any rate, it was a notable
judgment of God Himself, though He employed men as its ministers. Nor
does Paul in vain exhort  <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) us by
this example to beware of fornication.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p49"></span>The mode of the punishment, however,
was diverse, for the lower orders were slain (by pestilence,) but the
leaders were hanged upon the gallows, that the sight might awaken more
terror; for by “the heads of the people” he means those of the highest
repute, whose ignominy must have been most notable, because the eyes of
all men are generally upon the great and noble. Hence, also, they
deservedly incur the heavier punishment, because obscure persons do less
harm by their example, nor are their acts so generally the objects of
imitation. Let, therefore, those who are held in esteem beware lest they
provoke others to sin by their evil deeds, for, in proportion to each
man’s pre-eminence, the less excuse he deserves. Others interpret it
differently, as if Moses were commanded to fetch the princes to give
their sentence against the criminals; thus by the pronoun “them” they
understood whosoever should be convictcd; but it is hardly probable that
so great a multitude were hanged, and therefore I do not doubt but that
reference is made to their peculiar punishment:.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p50"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p50.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p51"></span>**6.** *And, behold, one of the
children of Israel came.* Moses here relates a case which was foul and
detestable beyond others. There is no doubt but that many, in the midst
of such gross licentiousness as had now for some time generally
prevailed, had filled the camp with various scandalous offenses; but
there was something peculiarly enormous in the atrocity of this act, in
that this impious despiser of God wantonly insulted both God and men
amidst the tears and lamentations of all, as if he were triumphing over
all shame and modesty. The multitude were weeping before the tabernacle,
that is to say, all the pious who trembled at the thought of approaching
calamity, since they were fully persuaded that this licentiousness,
accompanied by idolatry and sacrilege, would not be unpunished;
meanwhile, this abandoned man rushes forward, and, in mockery of their
tears, leads his harlot in procession as it were. No wonder, therefore,
that God should have exercised such severity, when things had come to
this extremity. But it must be observed that the order of the history is
inverted, since it is not credible that, after the Judges had begun to
perform their office, such an iniquity should be committed. But this
narrative is thus inserted, in order that it may be more apparent how
necessary it was to proceed speedily to severe chastisement, since
otherwise it would have been impossible to apply a remedy in time to so
desperate an evil.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p52"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p52.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p53"></span>**7.** *And when Phinehas, the son of
Eleazar.* The courage of Phinehas is celebrated, who, whilst the rest
were hesitating, inflamed with holy zeal, hastens forward to inflict
punishment. The backwardness of others is therefore condemned by
implication, though their tears were praiseworthy; but, since they were
almost stupified by grief, their virtue was not dear from all defect.
And certainly, whilst the yet unbridled licentiousness of the people was
foaming like a tempestuous sea, we cannot wonder that the minds of the
good were altogether or partially disabled. Hence was the zeal of
Phinehas the more distinguished, when he did not hesitate to provoke so
many worthless and wicked persons infuriated by their lechery. If any
object that he transgressed the limits of his calling, when he laid hold
of the sword with which God had not armed him, to inflict capital
punishment, the reply is obvious, that our calling is not always
confined to its ordinary office, inasmuch as God sometimes requires new
and unusual acts of His servants. As a priest, it was not the office of
Phinehas to punish crime, but he was called by the special inspiration
of God, so that, in his private capacity, he had the Holy Spirit as his
guide. These circumstances, indeed, ought not to be regarded as an
example, so that a general rule may be laid down from them; though, at
the same time, God preserves His free right to appoint His servants by
privilege to act in His behalf as He shall see fit. God’s judgment of
this case may be certainly inferred from its approval, so that we may
correctly argue that Phinehas was under His own guidance, since He
immediately afterwards declared that He was pleased with the act, as is
also stated in <span id="ii.xxxviii-p53.1"></span>[Ps.
106:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#030.md),
[31](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#031.md)<span id="ii.xxxviii-p53.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p54"></span>Now, if any private person should in
his preposterous zeal take upon himself to punish a similar crime, in
vain will he boast that he is an imitator of Phinehas, unless he shall
be thoroughly assured of the command of God. Let the answer of Christ,
therefore, always be borne in mind by us, whereby he restrained His
disciples, when they desired, like Elijah, to pray that those who had
not received them should be destroyed by fire from heaven, “Ye know not
what manner of spirit ye are of.” (<span
id="ii.xxxviii-p54.1"></span>[Luke
9:54](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#054.md),
[55](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055.md)<span
id="ii.xxxviii-p54.1"></span>.) In order, therefore, that our zeal may
be approved by God, it must be tempered by spiritual prudence, and
directed by His authority; in a word, the Holy Spirit must go before and
dictate what is right.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p55"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p55.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p56"></span>**9.** *And those that died in the
plague.* Paul, when he says that only twenty-three thousand died,
appears to differ from Moses; but we know that the exact account of
numbers is not always observed, and it is probable that *about*
twenty-four thousand were slain. Paul, therefore, subtracted one
thousand, and was content with the lesser number;  <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) from which, however, we may perceive
how severe and terrible was the punishment, teaching us to beware of
provoking God by fornication. For, as it is a monstrous thing that so
great a multitude should have been infected by this foul and shameful
sin, so God’s fearful judgment against adulterers and fornicators is set
before us. We have already seen that, although they were guilty of a
wicked rebellion, still the punishment is justly ascribed to their lust,
which impelled them to idolatry.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p58"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p58.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p59"></span>**10.** *And the Lord spake unto
Moses.* In these words God makes it appear that He was the author of the
death (of Zimri and Cozbi;)  <span id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) not
only because He was thus propitiated towards the people, but because He
calls the zeal of Phinehas His own.  <span
id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) It will, however, accord equally well
whether we take it actively or passively, viz., either that Phinehas was
inflamed with zeal to vindicate God’s glory, or that he took upon him
the zeal of God Himself. Whichever be preferred, God refers to Himself
what was done by Phinehas. When He declares that He was appeased by the
punishment inflicted, let us not imagine that there was a meritorious
satisfaction, whereby the Papists feign that their punishments are
redeemed before God. For although the just chastisements of sin are
sacrifices of sweet savor, they are by no means expiations to reconcile
God. Besides, there is no question here of compensation, but what is
meant is, that it was a means of appeasing God, when the ungodliness of
the people which had, as it were, fanned up His wrath into a flame, was
repressed by this severe correction. Thus, in <span
id="ii.xxxviii-p61.1"></span>[Psalm
106](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#000.md)<span
id="ii.xxxviii-p61.1"></span>, the atonement is ascribed not to the act
of Phinehas, but only to his prayer,  <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) because, in right of his priesthood,
he had humbly interceded for the people. At the same time, the statement
of Paul is true, that those are not judged by God who voluntarily judge
themselves, (<span id="ii.xxxviii-p62.4"></span>[1Co
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.xxxviii-p62.4"></span>,) since, by their penitence, they in a
manner prevent this judgment.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p63"></span>A perpetual priesthood is promised to
Phinehas as his reward. If any object, that he thus obtained nothing
new, since, in accordance with the rule of the law, he was the undoubted
successor of his father, I reply, that it is not un-common that what God
had already freely promised, He declares that He will give by way of
reward. Thus, what had been promised to Abraham before the birth of
Isaac, is again repeated after he was prepared to sacrifice him, (<span
id="ii.xxxviii-p63.1"></span>[Ge
22:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.xxxviii-p63.1"></span>:) “Because thou hast done this thing, and
hast not withheld thy son,” therefore, “in blessing I will bless thee,
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.” Besides,
the privilege of a single individual is not simply in question here, but
it refers to a perpetual succession, as if God had promised that his
posterity should never fail. And assuredly, the change which took place
at the commencement of Solomon’s reign, is not repugnant to this
promise, for it may be probably inferred that Zadoc, no less than
Abiathar, was of the race of Phinehas. This covenant is called a
“covenant of peace,” because it was to be surely established;
consequently, it may be properly rendered, “My covenant in peace.” At
any rate, it indicates prosperity, as if He had said that Phinehas,
together with his posterity, should prosperously execute the sacerdotal
office.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p64"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p64.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p65"></span>**14.** *Now the name of the
Israelite.* Even as the memory of the just is blessed, so also it was
equitable that the author of this foul sin should be condemned to
perpetual infamy. It appears, however, from the fact of a part of the
disgrace being thrown upon the whole tribe, how greatly displeasing to
God was this gross enormity. For although the tribe of Simeon is not
here actually involved in the charge of participating in the sin, yet
are they all branded with the common mark of ignominy for their
humiliation, in order that each one of them may learn severely to
correct whomsoever amongst his relatives he may see offending, and by no
means to encourage their vices, if he desires to do credit to the
founder of his race.  <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) It is
recorded that both Zimri and the Midianitish woman were of noble and
principal families, not only that we may be taught that God’s judgment
is no respecter of persons (<span
id="ii.xxxviii-p66.1"></span>ἀπροσωπόληπτον,) in that it does not spare
rank, but also that the higher a person may be in position, the greater
is the disgrace he is exposed to if he conduct himself dishonorably,
since their very dignity renders men’s actions more conspicuous.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p67"></span>Because the paternal house of the
harlot is said to have been in Midian, some conjecture that she was born
in the land of Moab, or, at any rate, brought up there among her
maternal relatives; but, as the matter is unimportant, I leave it
undecided.

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p68"></span><span id="ii.xxxviii-p68.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxviii-p69"></span>**17.** *Vex the Midianites, and smite
them.* Inasnmch as God constantly forbids His people to take vengeance,
it is surprising that the people of Israel should now be instigated to
do so; as if they were not already more than enough disposed to it. We
must bear in mind, however, that since God, who is the just avenger of
all wickedness, often makes use of men’s instrumentality, and
constitutes them the lawful ministers for the exercise of his vengeance,
it must not be altogether condemned without exception, but only such
vengeance as men themselves are impelled to by carnal passions. If any
one is injured, straightway he is carried away to the desire of
vengeance by the stimulus of his own private injury; and this is
manifestly wrong: but if a person is led to inflict punishment by a just
and well-regulated zeal towards God, it is not his own cause, but that
of God which he undertakes. God did not, therefore, desire to give reins
to His people’s anger, so as to repay the Midianites as they had
deserved in the violence of its impulse; but He armed them with His own
sword for their punishment; as if He had declared that there was a just
cause for their war, and that they need not fear the charge of cruelty,
if they exterminated such obnoxious enemies. For, although Balaam alone
had imagined this snare, still the guilt is laid upon the whole people.
In the meantime, the punishment of the Moabites is delayed, although
they had apparently inflicted the grosser injury. Because no good reason
here appears why God should mercifully bear with the one nation, whilst
He hastens speedily to the punishment of the others, let us learn to
regard His judgments with reverence, and not to presume to discuss them
further than is lawful. Let it be sufficient for us to know that war was
justly declared against the Midianites, because it was not their fault
that Israel was not ruined by their iniquitous impiety.  <span

reconcile them, as it is no unusual thing, when it is not intended to
number exactly and minutely each head, to put down a number that comes
near it, as among the Romans there were those that received the name of
*ceatumviri,* (the *hundred,)* while in reality there were two above the
hundred. As there were, therefore, about twenty-four thousand that were
overthrown by the Lord’s hand — that is, above twenty-three thousand,
Moses has set down the number *above* the mark, and Paul the number
*below* it, and in this way there is in reality no difference.” — Cal.
