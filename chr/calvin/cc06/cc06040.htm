<p><a name="ii.xxxix-p10"></A><b>3.</b> <i>Your eyes have seen what the Lord did.</i> This enlargement more clearly shews that so conspicuous was the example given in the punishment, that it could not be hidden from even the most ignorant; for Moses does not here address those of refined judgment, but the common people 			 generally, who had only been spectators. Assuredly, if God&#8217;s vengeance had been less manifest, he would not have so confidently appealed to them as witnesses; hence was their stolidity the less excusable, if they were blind to so plain and notorious a fact.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xxxix-p11"></A>His praise of their constancy I refer to the present case alone; for it is abundantly clear that they did not persevere in cleaving to God. The meaning is, that there was a manifest discrimination in this Divine chastisement, so that the death of the ungodly multitude should preserve the pure worship of God among the survivors.</p>
