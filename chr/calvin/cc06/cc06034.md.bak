<span id="ii.xxxiii-p3"></span>**33.** And they turned, and went up by
the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he,
and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p4"></span>**33.** Conversi autem ascenderunt per
viam Basan, et egressus est Og rex Basan in occursum ipsis, ipse et
universus populus ejus ad praelium in Edrei.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p5"></span>**34.** And the Lord said unto Moses,
Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his
people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon
king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p6"></span>**34.** Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Ne
timeas eum: quia in manu tua dedi cumcet universum populum ejus, ae
terram ejus: faciesque ei quemadmodum fecisti Sihon regi AEmorrhaeorum
qui habitabat in Hesbon.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p7"></span>**35.** So they smote him and his sons,
and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they
possessed his land.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p8"></span>**35.** Et percusserunt eum et fillios
ejus, universumque populum ejus: ut non remanserit ei superstes: et
possederunt terram ejus.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p11"></span>**33.** *And they turned and went up.*
Here there is another victory of the people described, wherein they
again experienced the continued favor of God, in order that they may be
aroused to greater alacrity, and courageously prepare themselves for
farther progress; for they might confidently expect that, with God for
their leader, all things would succeed prosperously with them. The
region of Bashan, as Scripture informs us in many places, was fertile,
and famous for its rich pastures; but Moses here also testifies to its
great extent. It was, then, no ordinary proof of God’s favor and aid,
that they should take it in a moment, as it were. It is not, therefore,
without cause, that, in the Psalm, God’s power and goodness is magnified
in reference to these victories; because He

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p12"></span>“slew mighty kings, Sihon king of the
Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and gave their land for a heritage, a
heritage unto his people.” (<span id="ii.xxxiii-p12.1"></span>[Ps
135:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa135.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.xxxiii-p12.1"></span>.):

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p13"></span>For, although the Israelites were
superior in numbers, yet there is no doubt but that, when this king
dared to go forth to battle, he trusted in his forces, and deemed
himself equal to resistance. Hence did God’s grace shine forth the more
conspicuously; and, indeed, in order that he may extol its greatness the
more, Moses afterwards also relates that sixty cities were taken.  <span

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p15"></span><span id="ii.xxxiii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p16"></span>**35.** *And the Lord said, unto Moses.*
God first of all exhorts His people to confidence. He then commands that
the men as well as the cities and villages should be destroyed, so that
nothing should be preserved except the booty. he indeed addresses Moses
only, but his injunctions are directed to all, because Moses, who was
already sufficiently energetic, had not so much need of being spurred on
as the others. God, however, had regard to the future also, lest the
recollection of the blessing should be lost through the ingratitude of
the people. In promising them victory, therefore, he desired to have the
praise of it bestowed upon Himself.

<span id="ii.xxxiii-p17"></span>I have already shewn why He commanded
the cities to be overthrown, and all the houses utterly destroyed,
namely, lest convenient habitations should tempt the people to torpor,
when they were required to hasten onwards to the promised rest; for
those who had been ready in the wilderness to retire, and to go back
into Egypt, would have eagerly taken possession of this fertile land,
and reposed themselves as in a delightful nest. By its desolation,
therefore, they were compelled to abandon it. Its possession, indeed,
was afterwards granted to the tribes of Reuben, and Gad, and half of
Manasseh; but on condition that they should leave their herds there, and
accompany their brethren through the whole expedition, not deserting
them till the Canaanitish nations were destroyed.
