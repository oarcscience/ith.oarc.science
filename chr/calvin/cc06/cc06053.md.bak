<span id="ii.lii-p3"></span>**21.** Furthermore, the Lord was angry with
me for your sakes, and sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that
I should go in unto that good land which the Lord thy God giveth thee
for an inheritance;

<span id="ii.lii-p4"></span>**21.** Jehova iratus fuit contra me propter
verba vestra, juravitque quod non transirem Jordanem, neque ingrederer
terram bonam, quam Jehova Deus tuus dat tibi in haereditatcm.

<span id="ii.lii-p5"></span>**22.** But I must die in this land, I must
not go over Jordan: but ye shall go over, and possess that good land.

<span id="ii.lii-p6"></span>**22.** Ego enim morior in hac terra, neque
transeo Jordanem: vos antem transitis, ut possideatis terram istam
bonam.

<span id="ii.lii-p8"></span><span id="ii.lii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lii-p9"></span>**21.** *Furthermore, the Lord was angry
with me.* He again records that it arose from the transgression of the
people that he was not permitted to enter the land, not by way of
expostulation, and much less in order to accuse God of cruelty, as if he
had been improperly and unjustly substituted as a criminal in the place
of others, but rather to magnify the goodness of God towards those whom
He had treated with so much indulgence. For we must observe the
comparison, that, whilst they were to enjoy the land, he was to be
prevented from entering it. “I must die (he says) in this land” of Moab,
whilst to you it is given to enjoy the promised inheritance. We
perceive, therefore, that they are upbraided with their guilt in such a
way that all the bitterness of the reproof is sweetened by the sense of
God’s mercy; nay, that by this sweetness they may be ravished into
admiration, when they understand how mercifully that pardon is extended
to them, which was denied to Moses.

<span id="ii.lii-p10"></span>The sense of the expression which I have
rendered “for your words,”  <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md)
might be “for your things,” inasmuch as the Hebrews call men’s affairs
(*negotia*), <span id="ii.lii-p11.2"></span>דברים*, debarim.* Assuredly,
although he had been impelled to sin by their rebellious clamors, he
simply states that he was now punished on their account. If any should
inquire why he lays the blame on them, whereas the actual offenders were
most of them dead, the reply is obvious, that many of them were still
surviving, and that it is no novelty that the children should be
included with the fathers, when the whole body of a people has sinned.
