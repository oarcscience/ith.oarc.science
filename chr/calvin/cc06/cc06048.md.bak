<span id="ii.xlvii-p3"></span>**1.** These are the journeys of the
children of Israel, which went forth out of the land of Egypt with their
armies, under the hand of Moses and Aaron.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p4"></span>**1.** Istae sunt profectiones filiorum
Israel, qui egressi sunt e terra Egypti, per exercitus suos, per manum
Mosis et Aharon.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p5"></span>**2.** And Moses wrote their goings out
according to their journeys by the commandment of the Lord: and these
are their journeys according to their goings out.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p6"></span>**2.** Scripsit autem Moses egressus eorum
per profectiones eorum juxta sermonem Jehovae: istae, inquam, sunt
profectiones eorum per egressus eorum.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p7"></span>**3.** And they departed from Rameses in
the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow
after the passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in
the sight of all the Egyptians.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p8"></span>**3.** Profecti sunt igitur Ramesse mense
primo, decimaquinta dic mensis primi, postera dic Phase egressi sunt
filii Israel in manu excelsa in oculis omnium Egyptiorum.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p9"></span>**4.** (For the Egyptians buried all their
first-born, which the Lord had smitten among them: upon their gods also
the Lord executed judgments.)

<span id="ii.xlvii-p10"></span>**4.** (Egyptii autem interim sepeliebant
quos percusserat Jehova ex eis, omnem primogenitum et in diis eorum
fecerat Jehova judicia.)

<span id="ii.xlvii-p11"></span>**5.** And the children of Israel removed
from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p12"></span>**5.** Profecti sunt, inquam, filii
Israel e Ramesse, ct castrametati sunt in Suchoth.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p13"></span>**6.** And they departed from Succoth,
and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p14"></span>**6.** Profecti autem de Suchoth,
castrametati sunt in Etham, qum est in extremo deserti.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p15"></span>**7.** And they removed from Etham, and
turned again unto Pihahiroth, which is before Baal-zephon: and they
pitched before Migdol.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p16"></span>**7.** Et profecti de Etham, reversi sunt
in Phihahiroth, qui est ante Baal-sephon, et castrametati sunt ante
Migdol.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p17"></span>**8.** And they departed from before
Pihahiroth, and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness,
and went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in
Marah.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p18"></span>**8.** Profecti vero de Phi-hahiroth,
transierunt per medium maris in desertum: et ambulaverunt viam trium
dictum per desertum Etham, et castrametati sunt in Marah.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p19"></span>**9.** And they removed from Marah, and
came unto Elim: and in Elim were twelve fountains of water, and
threescore and ten palm-trees; and they pitched there.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p20"></span>**9.** Profecti vero de Marah venerunt in
Elim: in Elim vero erant duodecim fontes aquarum, et septuaginta palmae,
et castrametati sunt illic.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p21"></span>**10.** And they removed from Elim, and
encamped by the Red Sea.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p22"></span>**10.** Et profecti ex Elim, castrametati
sunt juxta mare Suph.

Sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.

castrametati sunt in deserto Sin.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p25"></span>**12.** And they took their journey out
of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p26"></span>**12.** Et profecti e deserto Sin,
castrametati sunt in Dopheah.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p27"></span>**13.** And they departed from Dophkah,
and encamped in Alush.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p28"></span>**13.** Profecti autem e Dopheal:,
castrametati sunt in Alus.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p29"></span>**14.** And theyremoved from Alush, and
encamped at Rephidim, where was no water for the people to drink.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p30"></span>**14.** Et profecti ex Alus, castrametati
sunt in Rephidim, ubi non erant aqum populo ad bibendum.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p31"></span>**15.** And they departed from Rephidim,

<span id="ii.xlvii-p77"></span>**38.** And Aaron the priest went up into
mount Hor, at the commandment of the Lord, and died there, in the
fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of
Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p78"></span>**38.** Ascendit autem Aharon sacerdos in

pitched in Oboth.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p88"></span>**43.** Profecti e Punon, castramentati
sunt in Oboth.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p89"></span>**44.** And they departed from Oboth, and

<span id="ii.xlvii-p90"></span>**44.** Profecti item ex Oboth,
castrametati sunt in Ije-haabarim in termino Moab.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p91"></span>**45.** And they departed from Iim, and

and encamped in Almon-diblathaim.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p94"></span>**46.** Profecti item ex

<span id="ii.xlvii-p95"></span>**47.** And they removed from
Almon-diblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p96"></span>**47.** Profecti praeterea ex
Almon-diblathaim, castrametati sunt in montibus Abarim ante Nebo.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p97"></span>**48.** And they departed from the
mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the plains of Moab, by Jordan near
Jericho.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p98"></span>**48.** Et profecti e montibus Abarim,
castrametati sunt in campestribus Moab, juxta Jordanem Jericho.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p99"></span>**49.** And they pitched by Jordan, from
Beth-jesimoth even unto Abel-shittim, in the plains of Moab.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p100"></span>**49.** Tandem castrametati sunt juxta
Jordanem a Beth-jesimoth usque ad Abel-sittim in campestribus Moab.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p101"></span>**50.** And the Lord spake unto Moses in
the plains of Moab, by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

<span id="ii.xlvii-p102"></span>**50.** Loquutus est autem Jehova ad
Mosen in campestribus Moab, juxta Jordanem Jericho, dicendo:

<span id="ii.xlvii-p103"></span>**51.** Speak unto the children of
Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land
of Canaan;

<span id="ii.xlvii-p104"></span>**51.** Alloquere filios Israel, et
dicas eis, Quum transieritis Jordanem ad terram Chenaan.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p105"></span>**52.** Then ye shall drive out all the
inhabitants of the land from before you,

<span id="ii.xlvii-p106"></span>**52.** Expellite omnes habitatores
terrte a facie vestra,

<span id="ii.xlvii-p107"></span>**53.** And ye shall dispossess the
inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the
land to possess it.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p108"></span>**53.** Expelletis, inquam, habitatores
terrae, et habitabitis in ca, vobis enim dedi terram, ut cant
possideatis.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p109"></span>**54.** And ye shall divide the land by
lot for an inheritance among your families; and to the more ye shall
give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less
inheritance: every man’s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot
falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p110"></span>**54.** Possidebitis autem terram illam
per sortem, per familias vestras: pluribus multiplicabitis haereditMem
eorum, et paucioribus diminuatis haereditatem eorum: in loco in quo
egredietur illi sors, erit illis: per tribus patrum vesttorum
haereditatem capietis.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p111"></span>**55.** But if ye will not drive out the
inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass,
that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and
thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p112"></span>**55.** Quod si non expuleritis
habitatores terrae a facie vestra, tum erit ut quos reliqueritis ex eis,
sunt in cultros in oculis vestris, et in spinas lateribus vestris, et
affligent vos super terram in qua vos habitabiris.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p113"></span>**56.** Moreover, it shall come to pass,
that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p114"></span>**56.** Evenietque ut quemadmodum
cogitavi facere illis, faciam vobis.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p115"></span> 

<span id="ii.xlvii-p116"></span><span id="ii.xlvii-p116.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlvii-p117"></span>**1.** *These are the journeys of the
children of Israel.* Moses had not previously enumerated all the
stations in which the people had encamped, but scarcely more than those
in which something memorable had occurred, especially after the passage
of the Red Sea; because it was of great importance that the actual
localities should be set, as it were, before their eyes, until they were
not only rescued from impending death by God’s amazing power, but a way
unto life was opened to them through death and the lowest deep. In fact,
in one passage he has as good as told us that he omitted certain
stations, where he records that the people “journeyed from the
wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of
the Lord,” to Rephidim, (<span id="ii.xlvii-p117.1"></span>[Ex
17:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.xlvii-p117.1"></span>) here, however, he more accurately states
every place at which they stopped, as if he were painting a picture of
their journey of forty years. His object in this is, first, that the
remembrance of their deliverance, and so many accompanying blessings,
might be more deeply impressed upon them, since local descriptions have
no little effect in giving certainty to history; and, secondly, that
they might be reminded by the names of the places, how often and in how
many ways they had provoked God’s anger against them; but especially
that, now they were on the very threshold of the promised land, they
might acknowledge that they had been kept back from it, and had been
wandering by various tortuous routes, in consequence of their own
depravity and stubbornness, until they had received the reward of their
vile ingratitude. Whilst, at the same time, they might reflect that God
had so tempered the severity of their punishment, that He still
preserved and sustained the despisers of his grace, notwithstanding
their iniquity and unworthiness; and also that He carried on to the
children (of the transgressors) the covenant which He had made with
Abraham.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p118"></span>It is not without reason that Moses
premises that “these were the journeys of the children of Israel;” for,
at the period when they came out of the land of Goshen, they were
affected with no ordinary fear and anxiety, when they saw themselves
buried, as it were, in the grave; for they were shut in on every side
either by the sea or the defiles of two mountains, or by the army of
Pharaoh. Having entered the desert, they had seven stations before they
arrived at Mount Sinai, in which they must have perished a hundred times
over by hunger and thirst, and a dearth of everything, unless God had
marvellously succoured them. And although they might have completed
their whole journey in so many days, even then their obstinate
perversity began to subject them to delay. If the lack of bread and
water beset them, they ought to have been more effectually stirred up by
it to have recourse humbly to God. So little disposed, however, were
they to that humility, which might have taught them to ask of God by
prayer and supplication a remedy for their need, that they rather
rebelled against Moses: and not only so, but they petulantly assailed
God Himself with their impious taunts, as if He were a cruel executioner
instead of their Redeemer. Hence, therefore, it came to pass that it was
not before the fortieth day that they were at length brought to Mount
Sinai. Scarcely had the Law been promulgated, and whilst the awful voice
of God was still ringing in their ears, whereby He had bound them to
Himself as His people, when, behold, suddenly a base, nay, a monstrous
falling away into idolatry, whence it was not their own fault that,
having rejected God’s grace, and as far as depended upon themselves
having annulled the promise, they did not perisist miserably as they
deserved. By this impediment they were again withheld from further
progress. With the same obstinacy they constantly raged against God,
and, though warned by many instances of punishment, never returned to a
sound mind. The climax of their insane contumacy was, that when arrived
at the borders of the promised land, they repudiated God’s kindness, and
exhorted each other to return, as if God were adverse to them, and His
inestimable deliverance, which ought to have been a perpetual obligation
to obedience, were utterly distasteful to them. The stations, which then
follow, express in a more, lively manner how, — like a ship which is
driven away from its port by a tempest, and whirled round by various
currents, — they were carried away from approaching the land, and
wandered by circuitous courses: as if they deserved that God should thus
lead them about in mockery. It will be well for us to keep our eyes on
this design of Moses, in order that we may read the chapter with profit.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p119"></span>He calls the order of their marches
journeys *(profectiones,)* in contradistinction to their stations: for
they did not strike their camp unless the signal were given, *i.e.,*
when the cloud left the sanctuary, and moved to another spot, as if God
stretched forth His hand from heaven to direct their way: and hence it
was more clearly apparent, that they were retained in the desert by this
power.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p120"></span><span id="ii.xlvii-p120.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlvii-p121"></span>**3** *And they departed from Rameses.*
I do not approve of their opinion, who think that the name of this city
is used for the whole land of Goshen: since it is not reasonable that
they should have set forth at the same time from various distant and
remote places. And this would still less accord with what presently
follows,  <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) that they went forth
in orderly array; though it might not be the case that they all mustered
together in the city, because it is hardly credible that so great a
multitude could be received within its walls, but that by the order of
Moses and Aaron, they were all assembled in the neighborhood of the
city, so that they might be organized, lest in the confusion of their
hurried march they should impede each other.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p123"></span>After having stated that they went out
by “the high hand” of God, for the purpose of extolling still more His
wonderful power, he adds that the Egyptians were witnesses and
spectators of it: whence we conclude that they had at last yielded to
God,  <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) or were so thoroughly
subdued, as not to dare to lift up a finger. Another circumstance is
also added, viz., that the Egyptians were then burying all their
first-born; by which words Moses does not mean to indicate that they
forbore from hindering the departure of the Israelites,  <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) because they were occupied with
another matter; but rather signifies that, although they were
exasperated by grief at the loss of their sons, still they lay
stupified, as it were, since the power of God had enfeebled them, so
that they had lost the ability to offer resistance.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p126"></span>When Moses says, that God “executed
judgments” upon the gods of the Egyptians, it is with the object of
recommending the true faith, lest the children of Israel should ever
turn aside to the superstitions of the Gentiles, which, at the time of
the deliverance, they had found to be mere delusions. For not only were
Pharaoh and his troops overthrown, but their gods also put to shame,
when they pretended to be the protectors of their land: and thus were
all their superstitions refuted and convicted of error and folly. It is
a silly imagination, that all the idols of Egypt fell down of
themselves,  <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) in order that the
God of Israel might claim the glory of Deity for Himself alone. It is
enough that God triumphed over the idols, when He effectively shewed
that they had no power to aid their worshippers, and, at the same time,
discovered the trickeries of the magicians. To this Isaiah appears to
allude, when he says,

<span id="ii.xlvii-p128"></span>“Behold, the Lord shall come into Egypt,
and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at His presence,” (<span
id="ii.xlvii-p128.1"></span>[Isa
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa019.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.xlvii-p128.1"></span>)

<span id="ii.xlvii-p129"></span>for he signifies that God will give such
proofs of His power in Egypt, as shall demonstrate the vanity of all
their errors, and overthrow all the superstitious fictions whereby the
Israelites had been deceived.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p130"></span><span id="ii.xlvii-p130.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlvii-p131"></span>**8.** *And they departed from before
Pi-hahiroth.* He relates how the people marched forwards for three days;
not so much in praise of their endurance, as in celebration of God’s
wonderful power, who sustained so great a multitude without water. For
we must bear in mind, what I have elsewhere shewn, that from the passage
of the Red Sea to Marah there was no water found; whence the impiety of
the people was the more detestable, since they there burst forth into
rebellion on account of the bitter taste of the water. On the other
side, the incomparable mercy of God shone forth, in that He condescended
to refresh these churlish and provoking men in a pleasant and delightful
station; for from their first encampment they were led on to Elim, where
they found twelve fountains and seventy palm-trees. Moses passes briefly
over the wilderness of Sin, as if nothing worthy of being recorded had
occurred there; whereas the vile impiety of the people there betrayed
itself, and the place was ennobled by a signal miracle, since the manna
rained from heaven for the nourishment of the people, so that, the
windows of heaven being opened, mortal man “did eat angels’ food.” He
also briefly adverts to the want of water to drink at Rephidim: but he
deemed it sufficient here to enumerate the stations, which might recall
the various occurrences to the memory of the people. On the Graves of
Concupiscence a memorial of God’s punishment was inscribed; but since he
simply gives a list of other places, without any record of events, we
may gather, as I have above stated, that he had no other design than to
set before the eyes of the people the peregrination in which they had
been engaged for forty years. He, however, cursorily mentions the death
of Aaron; because his life had been prolonged, by God’s special
blessing, for the good of the people, until the time approached when
they were about to enter the promised land; since his authority was a
useful and necessary restraint upon the ungovernable character of this
headstrong people. At the same time the punishment inflicted upon the
holy man should have reminded posterity that it was not without reason
that their fathers had been so severely chastised, since they had not
ceased to add sin to sin, when God had not spared even His own servant
on account of a single transgression.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p132"></span>When he adds just afterwards, that the
Canaanite then first heard of the coming the children of Israel, he
indicates that God had put a veil over the eyes of their enemies, lest
they should oppose them at an earlier period. For God so mitigated the
severity of His judgment, that the exile of the Israelites was, at any
rate, undisturbed, and free from outward molestation, as long as they
had to wander in the desert.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p133"></span><span id="ii.xlvii-p133.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlvii-p134"></span>**50.** *And the Lord spake unto Moses.*
The end and design of God in willing that these nations should be
expelled, I have elsewhere explained,  <span
id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) viz, lest they should adulterate the
pure worship of God by their admixtures, should corrupt the people by
their bad examples, and thus be pollutions to the Holy Land. But Moses
now refers to another point, for, when about to speak of the division of
the land, he begins by saying that it must be emptied of its
inhabitants, that its free and full enjoyment may remain for the
children of Israel. We must remark the connection here, for else this
passage would have been a supplement of the First Commandment, to which
I have indeed appended the latter part of the verse: but, since God
declares connectedly, “Ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land,
and dwell therein, for I have given you the land to possess it,” it
would have been absurd that one clause should be disjoined from the
other.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p136"></span><span id="ii.xlvii-p136.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlvii-p137"></span>**54** *And ye shall divide the land by
lot.* The mode of division is also stated, that each should possess what
fell to him by lot; and this was the best plan, for the several tribes
would never have allowed themselves to be sent here or there at the
option of men: and even if the arrangement had been left to the voices
of the judges, they would rather have quarreled with each other than
determined what was right. But we must here take into consideration
something deeper; viz., that by this method God gave certain proof that
the children of Israel were the inheritors and masters of that land by
His liberality and special blessing. And, in the first place, we must
remember that, although men consider nothing more fortuitous than
casting lots, still they are governed by God, as Solomon says. (<span
id="ii.xlvii-p137.1"></span>[Pr
16:33](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033.md)<span
id="ii.xlvii-p137.1"></span>.) God, therefore, commanded the people to
cast lots, reserving to Himself the judgment as to those to whom they
should fall. For how came it to pass that Zebulun obtained his portion
on the sea-shore, except because it had been thus predicted by the
Patriarch Jacob? Why did a district productive of the best corn fall to
the tribe of Asher, unless because it had been pronounced by the same
lips, that

<span id="ii.xlvii-p138"></span>“Out of Asher his bread should be fat;  
and he should yield royal dainties”? (<span
id="ii.xlvii-p138.2"></span>[Ge
49:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.xlvii-p138.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xlvii-p139"></span>By the same prophecy the tribe of Judah
obtained an inheritance rich in vines, and abounding in the best of
pastures. Thus the division of the land, by lot, clearly showed that God
had not formerly promised that land to Abraham in vain; because the
proclamation of the gift by the mouth of Jacob was actually confirmed.
The pious old man had been expelled from hence by famine; he was but a
sojourner in Egypt, and twice an exile, and yet he assigns their
portions to his descendants in the most authoritative manner, just as
the father of a family might divide his few acres of land among his
heirs. Yet God finally sealed what then might have seemed ridiculous.
Hence it appears that things which, in the feebleness of our senses, we
imagine to move at the blind impulse of chance, are directed by God’s
secret providence; and that His counsel always proceeds in such a
regular course, that the end corresponds with the beginning. Again he
recommends to them the law of proportion, so that, according to their
numbers, a greater or a less allotment should be given to the several
tribes. The allegory which some conceive to be indicated here, viz.,
that we obtain our heavenly inheritance by God’s gratuitous good
pleasure, as if by lot, although at first sight plausible, is easily
refuted. Hebron was a part of the inheritance, but Caleb obtained it
without casting lots: and a still more decided exception appears in the
case of the tribe of Reuben, Gad, and half Manasseh, who, by the consent
of the rest, and not by lot, acquired by privilege, as it were, all the
territory that had been won on the other side of Jordan. Let my readers,
therefore, learn to abstain from such conceits, lest they should often
be obliged to confess with shame, that they have caught at an empty
shadow.

<span id="ii.xlvii-p140"></span><span id="ii.xlvii-p140.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlvii-p141"></span>**55** *But if ye will not drive out.*
We have elsewhere seen why God’s wrath was so greatly aroused against
those nations, that He desired them to be exterminated. Even in
Abraham’s time gross indulgence of sin had begun to prevail there, as we
gather from God’s word, when He said that “their iniquity was not yet
full.” After they had abused the forbearance of God Himself for 400
years, who will deny that their destruction was the just and reasonable
reward of their long obstinacy? Still, in cutting them off, God had
regard to His elect people, in order that they might be separated from
the heathen, and never turn aside to foreign superstitions. But the
punishment which is here threatened the Israelites deserved twice over
by their remissness, for they neither performed their duty in executing
God’s vengeance, and, as far as in them lay, they detracted from His
grace. He had conferred upon them no common honor, when He appointed
them to be His ministers for executing His judgments. It was therefore
base supineness in them to be remiss on this point. But again, He had
given them the whole land; when, then, they contented themselves with
part of it, and neglected the rest, their perverse ingratitude betrayed
itself by their indifference. Besides, they had willfully entangled
themselves in deadly nerds, by mixing with heathen nations, from whom
they had been separated by God, lest they should imitate their habits,
and corrupt religious ceremonies. God, therefore, threatens that these
nations shall be as prickles to pierce their eyes, and thorns in their
sides. That this was fulfilled, the Book of Judges affords the clearest
and most ample testimony, although, even to the days of David, this
punishment was constantly in course of infliction upon their eyes and
sides. Thus, also, is their untamable headstrongness proved, since such
a solemn admonition had no effect in causing  <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md) them to go forwards, no less in the
open punishment of iniquity, than in a course of victory and success.
