<span id="ii.xlix-p3"></span>**1.** And Moses went and spake these words
unto all Israel.

<span id="ii.xlix-p4"></span>**1.** Abiit itaque Moses, et loquutus est
verba ista ad universum Israelem.

<span id="ii.xlix-p5"></span>**2.** And he said unto them, I am an
hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in:
also the Lord hath said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

<span id="ii.xlix-p6"></span>**2.** Dixitque eis, Centurn et viginti
annerum suae hodie, non possum ultra egredi et ingredi: praeterea Jehova
dixit ad me, Non transibis Jordanera istum.

<span id="ii.xlix-p7"></span>**3.** The Lord thy God, he will go over
before thee, and he will destroy these nations from before thee, and
thou shalt possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as
the Lord hath said.

<span id="ii.xlix-p8"></span>**3.** Jehova Deus tuus ipse transiturus
est ante te, ipse disperdet gentes istas a facie tua, possidebisque eas:
Josua ipse transiturus est ante te, quemadmodum dixit Jehova.

<span id="ii.xlix-p9"></span>**4.** And the Lord shall do unto them as
he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of
them, whom he destroyed.

<span id="ii.xlix-p10"></span>**4.** Facietque Jehova illis quemadmodum
fecit Sihon et Og, regibus Emorrhaei, et terrae eorum quos disperdidit.

<span id="ii.xlix-p11"></span>**5.** And the Lord shall give them up
before your face, that ye may do unto them according unto all the
commandments which I have commanded you.

<span id="ii.xlix-p12"></span>**5.** Quum ergo dederit eos Jehova ante
faciem vestram, tunc facietis eis omnino juxta praeceptum quod praecepi
vobis.

<span id="ii.xlix-p13"></span>**6.** Be strong and of a good courage,
fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that
doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

<span id="ii.xlix-p14"></span>**6.** Estote fortes, et roborate vos, ne
timeatis, neque paveatis a facie eorum: Jehova enim Deus tuus est qui
pergit tecum, non deseret te, neque te derelinquet.

<span id="ii.xlix-p15"></span>**7.** And Moses called unto Joshua, and
said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong, and of a good
courage: for thou must go with this people unto the land which the Lord
hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to
inherit it.

<span id="ii.xlix-p16"></span>**7.** Vocavit ergo Moses Josua, et dixit
illi in oculis totius Israelis, Esto fortis, et robera te: tu enim
ingredieris cum populo isto terram quam juravit Jehova patribus eorum se
daturum illis, et ipse sorte divides eam illis.

<span id="ii.xlix-p17"></span>**8.** And the Lord, he it is that doth go
before thee; he will be with thee, he will not fail thee, neither
forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed.

<span id="ii.xlix-p18"></span>**8.** Jehova autem est qui praecessurus
est te, ipse erit tecum: non te deseret, neque derelinquet te, ne
timeas, neque paveas.

<span id="ii.xlix-p19"></span> 

<span id="ii.xlix-p20"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p21"></span>**1** *And Moses went and spake these
words.* By the word *went* he signifies that, having received the
commands from God, he came to the people to report them. Hence we gather
that they were warned in good time to beware, if they had been sensibly
disposed. And it was necessary that the people should hear from his own
mouth these addresses, which were by no means gratifying, as being full
both of cruel threats and severe reproofs; for, if they had been
delivered after his death, they would have straightway all exclaimed
that they had been deceitfully devised by some one else, and thus that
his name was falsely attached to them.

<span id="ii.xlix-p22"></span>Moreover, the peculiar time of their
delivery did not a little avail to enhance their weight, so that the
people should not only submit themselves with meekness and teachableness
to his instruction at the moment, but also that it might remain
hereafter deeply impressed upon their hearts. We know with what
attention the last words of the dying are usually received; and Moses,
 <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md) now ready to meet death at
God’s command, addressed the people as if bidding them finally farewell.
To the credit and dignity belonging to his office as a Prophet, there
was consequently added all the force and authority of a testamentary
disposition.

<span id="ii.xlix-p24"></span>As throughout his life he had been
incredibly anxious for the people’s welfare, so he now carries his more
than paternal care still further. And assuredly it becomes all pious
teachers to provide, as far as in them lies, that the fruit of their
labors should survive them. Of this solicitude Peter sets himself before
us as an example:

<span id="ii.xlix-p25"></span>“I think it meet (he says), as long as I
am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
moreover, I will endeavor that ye may be able after my decease to have
these things always in remembrance.” (<span id="ii.xlix-p25.1"></span>[2
Pet. 1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#015)<span id="ii.xlix-p25.1"></span>.md)

<span id="ii.xlix-p26"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p27"></span>**2** *And he said unto them, I am an
hundred and twenty years old.* Although Moses had been often proudly and
disdainfully rejected, it could not but be the case, nevertheless, that
his departure would both awaken the deepest sorrow, and inspire them
with much alarm. By setting before them his age, therefore, he consoles
their anxiety, and mitigates their grief; and also, by another reason,
he represses their lamentations, i.e., that God had fixed his term of
life. He adduces it, then, as an alleviation, because both his death was
more than mature, and he was no longer fitted in his extreme old age for
enduring fatigue. Here, however, the question arises, why he should say
that he was failing, and broken in strength, when we shall see a little
further on that he retained his senses in their rigor even until his
death? But the reply is obvious, that he would not have been useless in
his old age, because his eyes were dim or his members tremulous, but
because his age no longer allowed him to perform his usual duties. For
he had been marvelously and preternaturally preserved up to that time;
but, since he had now arrived at the end of his course, it was necessary
that he should suddenly sink, and be deprived of his faculties.

<span id="ii.xlix-p28"></span>“To go out, and come in,” is equivalent to
performing the functions of life: thus it is said in the Psalm, “Thou
has known my going out and coming in.”  <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md) (<span id="ii.xlix-p29.1"></span>[Ps
121:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa121.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.xlix-p29.1"></span>.) And in this sense David is said to have
gone out and come in, when he performed the duty intrusted to him by
Saul. (<span id="ii.xlix-p29.2"></span>[1Sa
18:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1018.htm#005)<span id="ii.xlix-p29.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xlix-p30"></span>In the latter clause, where he refers to
his exclusion from the land of Canaan, and his being prevented from
entering it, he indirectly rebukes the people, for whose offense God had
been wroth with himself and Aaron. Thus by this tacit reproof the
Israelites were admonished to bear patiently the penalty of their
ingratitude. At the same time., as he shows himself to be submissive to
the divine decree, he bids them also acquiesce in it.

<span id="ii.xlix-p31"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p31.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p32"></span>**3** *The Lord thy God, he will go over.*
By no ordinary consolation does he encourage their minds to renewed
alacrity, because they should experience, even when he was dead, the
unceasing favor of God. Hence we gather a lesson of especial usefulness,
that whenever God raises up to us men endowed with excellent gifts, He
is wont so to make use of their labors for a time, as still to retain
others in His hand, and constantly to substitute others, unless our sins
stand in the way. Hence it follows that the power of God is not to be
tied to the illustrious qualities of men, as if their death was His
destruction. It is true, indeed, that eminent men are rarely succeeded
by their equals,  <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) because our
wickedness stifles the light of spiritual gifts, and, as far as it can,
extinguishes them; still let this be deemed certain that, when God
promotes our welfare by ministers of special eminence, He gives us a
taste of His goodness, in order that we may expect its continuance;
“because he forsakes not the work of his own hands.” (<span
id="ii.xlix-p33.1"></span>[Ps
138:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa138.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.xlix-p33.1"></span>.) Moses says, therefore, that although he may
be taken away by death, still God will undertake the office of their
leader, or rather that He will continue to be their leader, as the
Israelites had before experienced Him to be.

<span id="ii.xlix-p34"></span>But h sustains their infirmity by another
consolation also, pointing out Joshua as his successor; otherwise the
people might have been ready to object that, if God was willing to go
before them, why did he not manifest it by the election of a
representative, by whose hand He might continue what He had begun by
Moses. In this respect, therefore, he also shows that God’s favor was by
no means obscure, since Joshua was already chosen to sustain the care
and burden of governing the people: for it is not by his own authority
that he obtrudes Joshua and sets him over them, but he declares him to
be called by God. Still, it is not a matter hitherto unknown which he
puts before them, but only bids them remember what God had long ago
revealed, as we have elsewhere seen.

<span id="ii.xlix-p35"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p35.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p36"></span>**4** *And the Lord shall do unto them.*
He promises that, when they shall come into the land of Canaan, they
shall be conquerors of all its nations: and this he confirms by
experience; for, as God had delivered Sihon king of the Arnorites, and
Og king of Bashan, into their hands, so also He would give them the same
success in subduing their other enemies. The world is indeed subject to
many revolutions, but God still remains like Himself, not only because
His counsel is never changed, but because His power is never diminished.
By a *real* proof, therefore, as it is called, he encourages the
expectations of the people, and at the same time exhorts them resolutely
to execute God’s command, viz., that they should purge the land of
Canaan by the destruction of all its inhabitants. In appearance, indeed,
this was fierce and cruel, to leave not even one alive; but, since God
had justly devoted them to extinction, it was not lawful for the
Israelites to inquire what was to be done, but to abandon all
discussion, and to obey God’s command. In that they spared many, so much
the worse was their remissness, since God had often prepared them to
execute the vengeance which He had decreed.

<span id="ii.xlix-p37"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p37.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p38"></span>**6** *Be strong and of good courage.*
After he had shown that God would be with them, for their help, he
exhorts the people to firmness and magnanimity. And surely this is one
means of confirming our courage, to be assured that the assistance which
God promises will suffice for us: so far is it from being the case, that
our zeal and energy in acting aright is impaired, by our ascribing to
the grace of God what foolish men attribute to their own free will. For
those who are aroused to strenuous action in reliance on their own
strength, do no more than cast themselves headlong in their senseless
temerity and pride. Let us understand, then, that all exhortations are
fleeting and ineffective, which are founded on anything else but simple
confidence in the grace of God. Thus Moses assumes, as his ground of
exhortation, that God will fight for the Israelites. It must, however,
be observed that the people were animated to the perseverance of hope,
when God declares that He will be their helper even to the end, by which
lesson that impious hallucination is refuted, whereby the Popish
theologians have fascinated the world. They deny that believers  <span
id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md) can be certain of God’s grace, except
as to their present state. Thus do they hold faith in suspense, so that
we may only believe for a day, and even from moment to moment, whilst we
are in uncertainty as to what God will do with us on the morrow.
Whereas, if faith corresponds with God’s promises, and is, as it were,
in harmony with them, it must needs extend itself to our whole life,
nay, even beyond death itself; for God removes all doubt as to the
future by these words, “I will not leave thee nor forsake thee.”

<span id="ii.xlix-p40"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p40.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p41"></span>**7** *And Moses called unto Joshua.* It
hence appears that those, upon whom a public charge is conferred, have
need of a twofold confirmation: for, after having addressed a general
instruction to the whole people, he directs his discourse peculiarly to
Joshua himself, as to one whose business it was to set an example of
bravery to others, and whom severe contests awaited. Since, then, it is
more difficult to lead all the rest than to follow a leader, it is
necessary that he, who is set over many, should far excel them. But,
inasmuch as no one call do anything of himself, we must seek of God
whatever we want. Wherefore that, which Moses had enjoined upon the
whole people, he now repeats to a single individual, because upon him
the burden of ruling them was thrown. And this must be more carefully
observed, because, in proportion to the degree of honor, in which a man
is placed, so does he disdainfully look down upon all admonitions;
whence it is the case that those, who are eminent in the world,
carelessly reject the exhortations of God’s servants. But Moses
thoroughly overthrows all such fastidiousness, when he shows that all,
who are in authority, should not only be instructed together with
others, but even more urgently dealt with.

<span id="ii.xlix-p42"></span>When Moses, in this place as well as
above, forbids believers to give way to fear or dread, it must be
observed that. he would not have them so deprived of all feeling, as to
be hardened into indifference to every danger, or to suppose, as some
madmen do, that there is no such thing as bravery without stupidity, but
only possessed of such confidence as may overcome all fears, which
impede the course of their calling. Appropriately does the Apostle
extend this lesson further, where he wishes to correct avarice, which
arises from over-anxiety, whilst wretched men do not sufficiently
reflect what it is to have God for their perpetual helper.
(Hebrews13:5.)
