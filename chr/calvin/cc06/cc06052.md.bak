<span id="ii.li-p3"></span><span id="ii.li-p3.1"></span>[Deuteronomy
3:21-29](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#021.md)<span id="ii.li-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.li-p4"></span>**21.** And I commanded Joshua at that time,
saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto
these two kings: so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou
passest.

<span id="ii.li-p5"></span>**21.** Ipsi quoque Josua praecepi eo
tempore, dicendo, Oculi tui viderunt quaecunque fecit Jehova Deus vester
duobus regibus: sic facturus est Jehova omnibus regnis ad quae tu
pergis.

<span id="ii.li-p6"></span>**22.** Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord
your God he shall fight for you.

<span id="ii.li-p7"></span>**22.** Ne timeatis eos, quia Jehova Deus
vester ipse est qui pugnat pro vobis.

<span id="ii.li-p8"></span>**23.** And I besought the Lord at that time,
saying,

<span id="ii.li-p9"></span>**23.** Rogaveram autem Jehovam tempore illo,
dicendo:

<span id="ii.li-p10"></span>**24.** O Lord God, thou hast begun to show
thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in
heaven or in earth that can do according to thy works, and according to
thy might?

<span id="ii.li-p11"></span>**24.** Domine Jehova, tu coepisti ostendere
servo tuo magnitudinem tuam, et manum tuam validam. Quis enim Deus in
coelo, aut in terra, qui faciat secundum opera tua, et secundum
fortitudines tuas?

<span id="ii.li-p12"></span>**25.** I pray thee, let me go over and see
the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

<span id="ii.li-p13"></span>**25.** Transeam quaeso, et videam terram
illam bonam, quae est trans Jordanem, montem istum bonum et Libanum.

<span id="ii.li-p14"></span>**26.** But the Lord was wroth with me for
your sakes, and would not hear me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it
suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.

<span id="ii.li-p15"></span>**26.** Iratus autem Jehova contra me
propter vos, propterea non exaudivit me, sed dixit mihi, Sufficiat tibi,
ne posthac addas verbum ad me super hac re.

<span id="ii.li-p16"></span>**27.** Get thee up into the top of Pisgah,
and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and
eastward, and behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this
Jordan.

<span id="ii.li-p17"></span>**27.** Ascende verticem Pisgah, et leva
oculos tuos ad occidentem, ad aquilonem, ad meridiem, et ad orientem, ac
vide oculis tuis, non enim transibis Jordanem istum.

<span id="ii.li-p18"></span>**28.** But charge Joshua, and encourage
him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he
shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.

<span id="ii.li-p19"></span>**28.** Praecipe autem Josuae, et confirma
eum, et robora eum, ipse enim transiturus est ante populum istum, et
idem tradet illis terram possidendam, quam videbis.

<span id="ii.li-p20"></span>**29.** So we abode in the valley over
against Beth-peor.

<span id="ii.li-p21"></span>**29.** Mansimus vero in valle e regione
Beth-peor.

<span id="ii.li-p22"></span> 

<span id="ii.li-p23"></span><span id="ii.li-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ii.li-p24"></span>**21.** *And I commanded Joshua at that
time.* He repeats what we have already seen, that he exhorted Joshua
together with the whole people to prepare themselves to occupy the land
with alacrity, relying as well upon God’s promise, as upon the numerous
proofs of His assistance, which were so many pledges of the future
continuance of His grace.

<span id="ii.li-p25"></span><span id="ii.li-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ii.li-p26"></span>**23** *And I besought the Lord.*  <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) Others have, “I besought;” but I have
preferred using the pluperfect tense, because, in my opinion, Moses
interrupts himself to show why he had resigned his office to another,
and did not rather declare that he would be their leader, as heretofore,
and at the same time an example to the people of courage. He says,
therefore, that when he had prayed that he might be permitted to enter
the land, he received a refusal. For it is not probable that, after he
had substituted Joshua for himself, he straightway conceived a desire,
which was in direct opposition to it.

<span id="ii.li-p28"></span>The drift of the prayer is that God, by
granting him permission to enter the land, should thus fill up to the
full the measure of His grace towards him: for he enumerates the
blessings already vouchsafed to him, as the ground of his confidence in
asking, and that God, who is not wont to forsake the work of His own
hands, might carry on to the end the mercies He had begun. For this
reason he says that the might of God had been shown him; modestly
hinting that it was natural to expect that he should be a partaker of
the crowning blessing, in order that the end might correspond with the
beginning. He also magnifies the power of God as proclaimed by the
miracles; that so magnificent a work might not be interrupted. On the
other hand, he speaks in commendation of the goodness of the land, and
expressly shows that his desire to see it springs from earnest piety;
for I willingly subscribe to the opinion of those who understand Sion by
the “goodly mountain;” for, with the exception of Lebanon, there was no
other mountain so delectable in the land; whereas Lebanon, as if next to
it in rank, is mentioned in the second place.

<span id="ii.li-p29"></span><span id="ii.li-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ii.li-p30"></span>**26.** *But the Lord was wroth with me.*
Some imagine that God was offended by such a longing as this; but Moses
is rather giving the reason why he did not obtain what he sought, viz.,
because he had been already excluded from it. For, although he by no
means enters into debate with God, as if he had been unjustly condemned
for the faults of others, still he indirectly reflects upon the people,
since it was well that they should be all reminded that the punishment
which had been inflicted upon God’s distinguished servant was incurred
by the guilt of them all. We have elsewhere seen  <span
id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) how it was that the penalty of their
common transgression was with justice imposed upon Moses.

<span id="ii.li-p32"></span>Its mitigation then follows, when God
commands him to get up into the top of Mount Abarim, which is here
called Pisgah, and elsewhere Nebo, that he might nevertheless enjoy a
sight of the promised land.

<span id="ii.li-p33"></span>In conclusion, he more clearly explains why
he exhorted Joshua, viz., because he was about to go over before the
people; and in the last verse he assigns the reason of their delay, and
why they remained so long in the valley near Mount Abarim; for it is
precisely as if he had said that they were retained by the extension of
God’s hand, in order that they should not proceed any further until
Joshua had been installed as his successor.
