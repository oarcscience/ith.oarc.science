<p><a name="ii.xix-p3"></A><b>1.</b> Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi: and Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab; and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, tool: men:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p4"></A><b>1.</b> Tulit autem Corah filius Ishar, filii Cehath, filii Levi, et Dathan et Abiram filii Eliab, et On filius Peleth filii Reuben.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p5"></A><b>2.</b> And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p6"></A><b>2.</b> Et surrexerunt coram Mose, et viri e filiis Israel ducenti quinquaginta, principes congregationis, vocati ad tempus statutum, viri nominis.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p7"></A><b>3.</b> And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord?</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p8"></A><b>3.</b> Congregatique sunt adversum Mosen et Aharon, ac dixerunt eis, Sat sit vobis: nam tota congregatio, universi ipsi sancti sunt, et in medio, eorum est Jehova: quare ergo effertis vos supra congregationem Jehovae?</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p9"></A><b>4.</b> And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his bee:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p10"></A><b>4.</b> Quod quum audisset Moses, projecit se in faciem suam.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p11"></A><b>5.</b> And he spoke unto Korah, and unto all his company, saying, Even tomorrow the Lord will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p12"></A><b>5.</b> Et loquutus est ad Corah et ad omnem congregationem ejus, dicendo: Mane ostendet Jehova qui sint ejus, et quis sanctus, et ut accedat ad se: et quem elegerit, accedere faciet ad se.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p13"></A><b>6.</b> This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p14"></A><b>6.</b> Hoc facite, capite vobis acerras, Corah et tota congregatio ejus,</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p15"></A><b>7.</b> And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the Lord tomorrow: and it shall be, that the man whom the Lord doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p16"></A><b>7.</b> Et ponite in illis ignem, imponite quoque in eis incensum coram Jehova cras, et erit, vir quem elegerit Jehova, erit ille sanctus: satis sit vobis filii Levi.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p17"></A><b>8.</b> And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi;</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p18"></A><b>8.</b> Et dixit Moses ad Corah: Audite, quaeso, filii Levi.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p19"></A><b>9.</b> Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them?</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p20"></A><b>9.</b> An parurn hoe vobis est quod separaverit Deus Israelis vos de congregatione Israel, ut accedere faceret vos sibi ut ministretis in ministerio tabernaculi Jehovae, et ut staretis coram congregatione, ut ministraretis ei.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p21"></A><b>10.</b> And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p22"></A><b>10.</b> Et accedere fecit te, et omnes fratres tuos, filios Levi tecum: nisi quaeratis etiam sacerdotium?</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p23"></A><b>11.</b> For which cause, both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the Lord: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p24"></A><b>11.</b> Idcirco tu et universa congregatio tua estis qui conveniunt contra Jehovam: at vero Aharon quid est, quod murmurastis adversus eum?</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p25"></A><b>12.</b> And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; which said, We will not come up:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p26"></A><b>12.</b> Misit etiam Moses ad vocandum Dathan et Abiram filios Eliab: qui responderunt, Non ascendemus.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p27"></A><b>13.</b> Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p28"></A><b>13.</b> An parum es quod ascendere feceris nos e terra quae fluit lacte et melle, ut mori nos faceres in deserto, nisi etiam dominando domineris nobis?</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p29"></A><b>14.</b> Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p30"></A><b>14.</b> Atqui certe ad terram quae fluit lacte et melle non introduxistis nos, neque dedisti nobis haereditatem agrorum et vinearum: an oculos virorum istorum effodies? Non ascendemus.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p31"></A><b>15.</b> And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the Lord, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p32"></A><b>15.</b> Iratus est ergo Moses valde, et dixit ad Jehovam, Ne respicias ad oblationem eorum: ne asellum quidem unum ab eis accepi, neque afflixi quenquam ex ipsis.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p33"></A><b>16.</b> And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the Lord, thou, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p34"></A><b>16.</b> Postea dixit Moses ad Corah, Tu et universa congregatio tua estote coram Jehova, tu et illi et Aharon cras.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p35"></A><b>17.</b> And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the Lord every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p36"></A><b>17.</b> Et capite quisque acerram suam, et ponite in illis suffitum, et admovete coram Jehova quisque acerram suam, ducentas quinquaginta acerras, tu quoque et Aharon, quisque acerram suam.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p37"></A><b>18.</b> And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p38"></A><b>18.</b> Tulerunt igitur quisque acerram suam, et posuerunt in ipsis ignem, posueruntque suffitum, et steterunt ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis, et Moses et Aharon.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p39"></A><b>19.</b> And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto all the congregation.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p40"></A><b>19.</b> Congregaverat autem contra ipsos Corah, universam congregationem ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis: et visa est gloria Jehovae a tota multitudine.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p41"></A><b>20.</b> And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p42"></A><b>20.</b> Tunc loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen et Aharon, dicendo:</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p43"></A><b>21.</b> Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p44"></A><b>21.</b> Separate vos e medio turbae, ejus, et consumam eos momento.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p45"></A><b>22.</b> And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p46"></A><b>22.</b> Tunc ceciderunt super facies suas, ac dixerunt, Deus (vel, fortis) Deus spirituum in universa carne, num quum vir unus peccaverit, contra totum coetum excandesces?</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p47"></A><b>23.</b> And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p48"></A><b>23.</b> Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen dicendo:</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p49"></A><b>24.</b> Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p50"></A><b>24.</b> Alloquere congregationem, dicendo, Discedite e circuitu tabernaculi Corae, Dathan, et Abiram.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p51"></A><b>25.</b> And Moses rose up, and went unto Dathan and Abiram: and the elders of Israel followed him.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p52"></A><b>25.</b> Surrexit ergo Moses, et venit ad Dathan et Abiram: et sequuti sunt eum seniores Israel.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p53"></A><b>26.</b> And he spoke unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p54"></A><b>26.</b> Tune loquutus est ad congregationera, dicens, Recedite nunc a tabernaculis virorum istorum impiorum, neque attingatis quicquam eorum quae ad illos pertinent, ne forte pereatis in omnibus peccatis illorum.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p55"></A><b>27.</b> So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p56"></A><b>27.</b> Et recesserunt a tabernaculo Corae, Dathan et Abiram, e circuitu. Dathan vero et Abiram egressi sunt, ac steterunt ad ostium tabernaculorum suorum, et uxores eorum, et filii eorum, et parvuli eorum.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p57"></A><b>28.</b> And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to do all these works; (for I have not done them of mine own mind:)</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p58"></A><b>28.</b> Tunc dixit Moses, In hoc scietis quod Jehova miserit me, ut facerem omnia opera haec, et quod non de corde meo:</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p59"></A><b>29.</b> If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then the Lord hath not sent me:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p60"></A><b>29.</b> Si ut moriuntur omnes homines, morientur isti, et visitatione omnium hominum visitabitur super eos, non misit me Jehova:</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p61"></A><b>30.</b> But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p62"></A><b>30.</b> Sin autem creationem creaverit Jehova, et aperuit terra os suum, et deglutiverit eos, atque omnia quae ad illos pertinent, et descenderint viventes in infernum: tum cognoscetis quod irritaverunt viri isti Jehovam.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p63"></A><b>31.</b> And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p64"></A><b>31.</b> Fuit igitur quum consummasset loqui omnia verba ista, rupit sese terra quae erat sub illis:</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p65"></A><b>32.</b> And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p66"></A><b>32.</b> Aperuitque terra os suum, et deglutivit eos, et domos eorum, atque omnes homines qui erant ipsi Corah, et omnem substantiam:</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p67"></A><b>33.</b> They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p68"></A><b>33.</b> Descenderuntque ipsi et quotquot ad eos pertinebant viventes, in infernum: ac operuit eos terra, et perierunt e medio congregationis.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p69"></A><b>34.</b> And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p70"></A><b>34.</b> Omnis autem Israel qui erant in circuitu eorum, fugerunt ad clamorem eorum: dicebant enim, Ne forte deglutiat nos terra.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p71"></A><b>35.</b> And there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p72"></A><b>35.</b> Porro ignis egressus est a Jehova, et consumpsit ducentos illos, et quinquaginta viros offerentes suffitum.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p73"></A><b>36.</b> And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p74"></A><b>36.</b> Tunc loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p75"></A><b>37.</b> Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p76"></A><b>37.</b> Dic ad Eleazar filium Aharon sacerdotis, ut tollat acerras e medio incendii, et ignem dispergat longius, quid sanctificatae sunt.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p77"></A><b>38.</b> The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar; for they offered them before the Lord, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p78"></A><b>38.</b> Quod ad acerras istorum qui scelerati fuerunt in animas suas, ut faciant ex illis extensiones laminarum, opertorium altaris: quia obtulerunt in ipsis coram Jehova, et sanctificatae sunt: et erunt in signum filiis Israel.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p79"></A><b>39.</b> And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered, and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar;</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p80"></A><b>39.</b> Tulit itaque Eleazar sacerdos acerras aereas quibus obtulerant combusti, et extenderunt eas operimentum altaris.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p81"></A><b>40.</b> To be a memorial unto the children of Israel that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the Lord, that he be not as Korah, and as his company; as the Lord said to him by the hand of Moses.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p82"></A><b>40.</b> Memoriale filiis Israel, ut non accedat quisquam alienus qui non sit e semine Aharon, ut offerat suffitum coram Jehova, ne sit sicut Corah et coetus ejus: quemadmodum ei praeceperat Jehova per manum Mosis.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p83"></A><b>41.</b> But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the Lord.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p84"></A><b>41.</b> Et murmuraverunt universus coetus filiorum Israel postridie contra Mosen et Aharon, dicendo, Vos interfecistis populum Jehovae.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p85"></A><b>42.</b> And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation; and. behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the Lord appeared.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p86"></A><b>42.</b> Fuit autem quum se congregaret universus coetus contra Mosen et Aharon, verterunt faciem ad tabernaculum conventionis, et ecce operuit illud nubes et conspecta est gloria Jehovae.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p87"></A><b>43.</b> And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p88"></A><b>43.</b> Venit ergo Moses et Aharon coram tabernaculo conventionis.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p89"></A><b>44.</b> And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,</p>

<p><a name="ii.xix-p91"></A><b>45.</b> Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their hoes.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p92"></A><b>45.</b> Recedite e medio congregationis hujus, et consumam eos momento. Tunc projecerunt se super faciem suam.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p93"></A><b>46.</b> And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wroth gone out from the Lord; the plague is begun.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p94"></A><b>46.</b> Dixitque Moses ad Aharon, Cape acerram, et pone in ea ignem ex altari, et injice suffitum et perge cito ad congregationem, et expia eos: egressus est enim furor a facie Jehovae, coepitque percussio.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p95"></A><b>47.</b> And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p96"></A><b>47.</b> Tulit ergo Aharon quenmadmodum dixerat Moses, et cucurrit in medium congregationis: et ecce incoeperat percussio in populo, posuitque suffitum et expiavit populum.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p97"></A><b>48.</b> And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p98"></A><b>48.</b> Et quum staret inter mortuos et viventes, cessavit percussio.</p> 				  			  				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p99"></A><b>49.</b> Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.</p>

<p><a name="ii.xix-p101"></A><b>50.</b> And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.</p> 				   				
<p><a name="ii.xix-p102"></A><b>50.</b> Postea reversus est Aharon ad Mosen ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis, quum percussio esset cohibita.</p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="ii.xix-p104"></A><a name="ii.xix-p104.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p105"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Now Korah, the son of Izhar.</i> The impious conspiracy is here related of a few men, but these of the highest rank, whose object was to subvert and destroy the divinely-appointed priesthood. They make their attack, indeed, upon Moses, and accuse him of ruling unjustly; for thus it is 			 that turbulent persons are carried away without reason or discrimination; but, the only cause why they are set against him is because they suppose him to be the originator of the priesthood, as we easily collect from his reply. For he does not command them to stand forth, in order that they may decide respecting the political government or chieftainship, but that it may be made plain whether God acknowledges them as priests; nor does he reproach the Levites with anything but that, not content 			 with their own lot, they have an unreasonable ambition to obtain the honor of the high-priesthood. It was jealousy, then, that instigated Korah and his companions to set on foot first a quarrel, and then a tumult; respecting the priesthood, because they were indignant that the hope of attaining that honor was taken away from themselves and their posterity for ever. Thus there never was any more deadly or abominable plague in the Church of God, than ambition; inasmuch as it cannot be that those 			 who seek for pre-eminence should range themselves beneath God&#8217;s yoke. Hence arises the dissolution of legitimate authority, when each one neglects the duties of his position, and aims at his own private advancement.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p106"></A>Now, this conspiracy was the more formidable, because the sedition did not arise from the dregs of the people, but amongst the princes themselves, who were of high dignity, and held in the greatest estimation. For although there were only four leaders of the faction, there is but little room to doubt but that the purpose of the two hundred and fifty was the same; for they would never have eagerly embarked in a grave and invidious contest for 			 the sake of four men; but the fact was, that all unholy covetousness misled them all, for there was none of them who did not expect some prize as a reward of victory. They not only, then, dissemble their mental disease, but conceal it under an honorable pretext; for they pretend that they are instigated by zeal for the public good, and that their object is the defense of liberty. For, inasmuch as ambition is crafty, it is never destitute of some specious excuse: thus, whilst schismatics are 			 influenced by nothing but pride to disturb the peace of the Church, they always invent plausible motives, whereby they may conciliate in some degree the favor of the ignorant, or even of the unstable and worthless. We must, therefore, cautiously weigh the designs of those who seek to make innovations, and to overthrow a state of things which might be endured; for thorough investigation will make it plain that; they aim at something besides what they pretend. By the, fact of their so speedily 			 engaging such a multitude of persons in their party, we perceive how disposed man&#8217;s nature is to the most unpromising and unreasonable revolts in the world. Four worthless men wickedly endeavor to overthrow Moses and Aaron; and straightway two hundred and fifty persons are ready to follow them, not of the populace, but chiefs of the tribes, whose reputation might dazzle the eyes of the simple. Hence we must be the more cautious, lest any bugbears <i>(larvae) </i>should deceive us into making 			 rash innovations.</p>

 			  Some explain, &#8220;Let it suffice,&#8221; as if they desired to put an end to the tyranny of Moses; but I am rather of opinion that they would thus make a charge of presumptuous and sacrilegious supremacy, as if Moses and Aaron had not only usurped more than their right, but had also robbed God of His supreme authority. They, therefore, reproach the holy men with having impiously subjected to themselves the inheritance of God. Thus we see that God&#8217;s 			 faithful servants, whatever may be their moderation, are still not exempted from false accusations. Moses was an extraordinary example, not only of integrity, but also of humility and gentleness; yet he is called proud and violent, as if he unworthily oppressed the people of God. Observe further, that God permits His servants to be loaded with such unjust calumnies, in order to teach them that they must expect their reward elsewhere than from the world; and that the may humble them and make 			 trial of their endurance. Let us learn, then, to harden ourselves, so as to be prepared, though we do well, to be evil spoken of. These ungodly and seditious men betray their senselessness as well as their impudence. For by what right do they seek to degrade Moses and Aaron? Because, forsooth, God dwells amongst the people, and all in the congregation are holy! But holiness is neither destructive of subordination, nor does it introduce confusion, nor release believers from the obligation to 			 obey the laws. It is madness in them, then, to infer that those, whom God has sane-titled, are not subject to the yoke; yet they maliciously stigmatize as tyranny that care of the people which God has intrusted to His servants, as if they would purposely turn light into darkness.</p>

It is in this respect that the magnanimity of the ungodly differs from the 			 firmness of believers; for it often happens that unbelievers also labor in the defense of a good cause, voluntarily expose themselves to the hatred of many, undergo severe contests, and encounter of their own accord great perils; but with them obstinacy stands in the place of virtue. But those who look to God, since they know that the prosperous or unhappy events of all things are in His power, thus rely upon His providence; and when any adversity occurs, implore His faithfulness and 			 assistance.

He did not, therefore, at this time make this proposal hastily and at random, but by the inspiration of the Spirit had recourse to the sure judgment of God.

<p><a name="ii.xix-p119"></A>He bids them take their censers, that by their incense-offering it might be manifested whether their oblation was acceptable to God. By deferring it to the morrow he con-suited their own safety, if any of them might still be not incurable; for he saw that they were carried away headlong by blind fury, and that they could not be recalled to their senses in a moment. He, therefore, grants them some space of time for repentance, that they might 			 be led to consideration during the night; or perhaps his object was that, the tumult being appeased, he might render them all attentive to the decision of God.</p>

He was able to expostulate with the Levites at once, because their residence was close to the sanctuary.</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p122"></A>He accuses them of ingratitude, because they were not satisfied with the honor with which God had already dignified them, but also sought the high-priesthood. In this they betrayed their despisal of His grace; for, if they had rightly valued the gifts of God, each of them would have quietly contented himself with his lot; especially since, in proportion as a person has been liberally dealt with, his ingratitude is more intolerable, if he 			 aspires to anything higher. We are taught, therefore, that the higher the degree may be to which we have been elevated by God&#8217;s goodness, the greater is the punishment which our crime deserves, if our ambition still incites us to overleap the bounds of our calling. Nevertheless, such is the perversity of almost all men, that as soon as a person has attained some intermediate position, he uplifts, as it were, the standard of pride  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">91</FONT></A>
 			 and prescribes to himself no limit, until he shall have reached above the clouds. In a word, few are found who do not grow insolent in places of honor.

<p><a name="ii.xix-p125"></A><b>11.</b> <i>For which cause both thou, and all thy company.</i> He here lays open their sin, which they had endeavored to disguise. For they had neither scruple nor shame, as we have seen, in pretending pious zeal. But in one word Moses scatters these mists, telling them that they were instigated 			 by nothing but pride and envy to disturb the condition of the people. We must observe the expression which he uses, that they are in &#8220;arms against God;&#8221; for, although they might have never confessed to themselves that they had to do with Him, but only that they were contending for the pre-eminence with men; still, because it was their aim to overthrow the order established by God, Moses casts aside all false pretences, and sets before them the 			 simple fact that they are waging war with God, when they are fighting with His servants. If, therefore, we are afraid of contending with Him, let us learn to remain in our right place. For, however they may prevaricate, who disturb the Church through their ambition, in fighting against the servants of God, they attack Himself: and therefore it is needful that He should resist them, to avenge Himself. For war is not waged against God, as the poets feign the giants to have done, when they heaped 			 up mountains, and endeavored to surmount heaven; but when He is assailed in the person of His servants, and when what He has decreed is in any wise undermined. The vocation of the priests was sacred, so that they who conspired to overthrow it, were the open enemies of God, as much as if they had directed their arms, their strength, and their assaults against Him. We must, therefore, bear in mind the reason which is subjoined, &#8220;And what is Aaron?&#8221; for, if Aaron had usurped anything for himself, 			 his temerity and audacity would not have been supported by the countenance of God. Moses, therefore, declares that this is God&#8217;s cause, because there was nothing human in the ordinance of the priesthood. It was, indeed, an honorable office, so that Aaron justly deserved to be thought something of; but Moses indicates that he had nothing of his own, nor arrogated anything to himself; in a word, that he is nothing in himself, and moreover, that he is not elevated for his own private advantage, 			 and that his dignity is no idle one; but rather a laborious burden placed upon his shoulders for the common welfare of the Church. How utterly ridiculous, then, is the folly of the Pope in comparing all the enemies of his tyranny to Koran, Dathan, and Abiram; for, in order to prove that his cause is connected with that of God, let him show us the credentials of his calling, and at the same time thoroughly fulfil his office. But what frivolous and vapid trifling it is, when some mimic Aaron sets 			 himself up &#8212; produces no divine command or vocation &#8212; domineers in obedience to his own lusts, and is rather an actor on the stage than a priest in the temple; that all who reject this spurious dominion should be condemned as schismatics! Wherefore let us hold fast this principle, that war is waged against God when His servants are molested, who are both lawfully called and faithfully exercise their office.</p>

Herein he presented a likeness of the loving-kindness of God, by whose Spirit he was directed; not only because he was unwilling to pass sentence without hearing the cause, but also because he endeavored to bring them to repentance, that they might not willfully destroy themselves. Nevertheless it came to pass at this time, as also often afterwards, that not only was the earnestness of the Prophet, with respect to these unbelievers, throw away, but that it 			 hardened them more and more.

The crime they allege against him must be 			 observed. They reproach him for having led them up out of the land of Egypt: though they cunningly suppress its name, whilst they magniloquently extol its fruitfulness, in order to throw into the shade all that God had promised with respect to the land of Canaan. Nay, they seem to transfer slyly to Egypt the very phrase which Moses had often used, so that thus God&#8217;s blessing may be, as it were buried. But what gross ingratitude it showed, to allege as a crime against Moses, God&#8217;s minister, that 			 deliverance, which was so extraordinary an act of His kindness! In the next place, they reproach him with having brought them into the desert, to die: and this they enlarge upon in the next verse, and maliciously inquire, Where is the truth of the promises? At length they conclude that Moses is impudent in his deceptions, inasmuch as it plainly appears that the people had been imposed upon by him: as if it were his fault that they had deprived themselves of the possession of the promised land. 			 Moses had exhorted them, by God&#8217;s command, to enter upon the inheritance promised to them: what dishonesty and petulance, therefore, was it, when they had shut the door against themselves, to complain of Moses, upon whom it had not depended that they were not in the enjoyment of fields and vineyards! In the third place, they taunt Moses with seeking to domineer over a free people. He did indeed preside over them; but how far short of dominion was that moderate control, which was as onerous to 			 Moses, as it was advantageous to the whole people! But this is the condition of God&#8217;s servants, that their course is through reproaches,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">92</FONT></A>

Assuredly, it appears probable, from the context, that he was 			 inflamed with holy ardor; since he executes the vengeance of God, as His lawful minister, so that it is plain he neither spoke nor did anything but at the dictation of the Spirit. Nay, we shall soon see that, although he was anxious with regard to the public safety, he required that but a few offenders should be punished, and not that the multitude should perish. Nor does his anger burst forth into revilings: as those, who are carried away by excess, usually assail the enemies by whom they are 			 injured, with their tongue as well as their hands: but he betakes himself to God; nor does he ask more than flint they may be brought to shame in their pride. This is, indeed, expounded generally, by many, as if Moses desired that God should have no mercy upon them; but inasmuch as the decision of the quarrel depended on the approbation or rejection by God of rite offering they were about to make, he does not seem to me to pray for more than that God, by refusing their polluted gift, should 			 thus chastise their ambition. At the same time also he shows that his prayer springs from the confidence of a good conscience, when he dares to testify before God that he had injured no man. Now this was the extreme of integrity and disinterestedness, that, when the people owed everything to him, he had not taken even the value of a single ass as the reward of all his labors.</p>

Nor does he inveigle him so as to destroy him unawares, but rather still endeavors to cure his madness, if it were possible to do so. For the sacred incense-offering was calculated to inspire him with alarm, lest, by rashly attempting more than was lawful, he should effect his own destruction, especially after so memorable an example had been made in the case of Nadab and Abihu. Moses, however, in reliance on God&#8217;s command, does not hesitate to engage in an open contest, in order that 			 the judgment of God might be the more conspicuous.</p>

Surely if any spark of the fear of God had remained in them, 			 their censers would straightway have fallen from their hands; but Korah seems to have sought, as it were, deliberately how he might cast aside all fear, and totally bereave himself of his senses. For in the next verse, Moses narrates how ostentatiously he hardened himself in his rebellion, before he should offer the incense; for he gathered the people together to his party, in order that the magnificence of his array might overwhelm the grace of God, which opposed[ him. Herein also his 			 senselessness is clearly seen, when he seeks to fortify himself against God by the favor of the, mob, as if he had desired to extinguish the light of the sun by interposing a little smoke. Now, let us learn so to condemn his folly, as that nothing similar may happen in ourselves; for all ambitious persons are affected by the same disease. They collect their forces by endeavoring to ingratiate themselves with men; and, if the world approves of&#8217; them, they are inebriated with such fatal 			 confidence, as to spit at the very clouds.

<p><a name="ii.xix-p139"></A>On the other side, the levity of the people is set before our eyes. For some time they had been all accustomed to the duly-appointed priesthood, which they knew to be instituted by God; yet only a single night is required to make them revolt to Korah.

<p><a name="ii.xix-p141"></A><b>21.</b> <i>Separate yourselves from among this congregation.</i> Again does God declare that He will bear the people&#8217;s great impiety no longer, but will destroy them all to a man. Just, therefore, as he had commanded Lot to depart from Sodom, nay, had drawn him out by the hand of the angel, when 			 He desired to destroy that city, so He now commands Moses and Aaron to give Him room to exercise His wrath. In this He declares His extraordinary favor towards them; as if He were not free to execute vengeance, until they had gone out of the way, lest the destruction should reach themselves. In speaking thus, however, He does not absolutely affirm what He had determined in His secret counsel, but only pronounces what the authors of this wickedness had deserved. It is, therefore, just as if He 			 were ascending His judgment-seat. Thus Moses by his intercession by no means changed His eternal decree; but, by appeasing Him, delivered the people from the punishment they had merited. In the same sense God is said to be influenced by our prayers; not that after the manner of men He assumes new feelings, but, in order to show the more than paternal love with which he honors us, He, as it were, indulges us, when He listens to our desires. Hence we gather that even by this express denunciation 			 Moses was not prohibited from praying; because his faith in the adoption of the people was not destroyed. For we have already said that this principle, that the covenant which God had made with Abraham could not be made void, was so thoroughly an-graven upon his mind, that it surmounted whatever obstacles might present themselves. Resting, therefore, on the gratuitous promise, which depended not on men, his prayer was the offspring of faith. For the saints do not always reason accurately and 			 subtlety as to the form of their prayers; but, after they have once embraced that which suffices to awaken in them confidence in prayer, viz., God&#8217;s word, their whole attention is so directed to it, that they pass over the things which seem apparently to contradict it. Nor can we doubt but that it was God&#8217;s design, when He delivered his terrible sentence as to the destruction of the people, to quicken the earnestness of Moses in prayer, since necessity more and more inflames the zeal of the 			 pious. In short, Moses was always consistent in his care for the well-being of the people.</p>

 			  but, in my opinion, the name of God is rather repeated by way of adding force to the sentence.

 			  There is no question but that Moses applies this epithet to God in connection with the present matter; as if he desired to induce God to preserve His own work, just as a potter spares the vessels formed by himself. To the same effect is the prayer of Isaiah:</p>  		  
<p><a name="ii.xix-p146"></A>&#8220;But now, O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.

<p><a name="ii.xix-p147"></A>for hence he alleges a reason why God should relent, and be inclined to mercy. There is this difference, that Isaiah refers to that special grace wherewith God had embraced His people, whereas Moses carries his address further, viz., to the general grace of creation. It is of little importance whether we choose to expound this  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">95</FONT></A>
 			 with reference to all animals, or only to the human race, since Moses merely prays that, since God is the Creator and Maker of the world, He should not destroy the men whom He has formed, but rather have pity upon them, as being His work. In passing, however, we may infer from this passage,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">96</FONT></A>
 			 that all (men) have their separate souls, for God is not said to have inspired all flesh with life, but to have created their spirits. Hence the monstrous delusion of the Manicheans is refuted, that our souls are so infused by the transmission of the Spirit of God, as that there should still be only one spirit.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">97</FONT></A>
 			 But if it be preferred to include the animals, we must mark the grades of distinction between the spirit of man and the spirit of a dog or an ass. It is, however, more fitting to restrict it to men.</p>

<p><a name="ii.xix-p156"></A><b>24.</b> <i>Speak unto the congregation, saying.</i> It is evident, from this answer, that Moses was heard as regarded the general preservation of the people, on condition, however, that they should give proof of their repentance, by deserting the authors of the wicked rebellion; for, when God 			 commands them to retire from amongst them, He indirectly implies, that, if they remain mixed up with them, they shall share in the same destruction. Yet it is probable that the elders who &#8220;followed&#8221; Moses, held to his side, and continued firm in the performance of their duty. And, indeed, it is not at all consistent that Caleb and Joshua, and such like, were ever drawn away into so great a sin. We must not, therefore, take what is said of the whole congregation without exception. When Moses, in 			 his delivery of God&#8217;s command, does not address Korah, Dathan, and Abiram by their names, but calls them &#8220;these wicked men,&#8221; it is not the reviling of anger, but an urgent mode of exhortation; for, had he not thus vehemently marked his detestation of them, there was danger lest his words should have been but coldly received by many, and lest they should have been of little avail. To the same effect also is what he immediately adds: &#8220;Lest ye be consumed in all their sins;&#8221; as if tie had said, Lest the contagion of so many and such great crimes should infect yourselves. Since they obeyed Moses, it is plain that many of the multitude had been carried away before by folly and levity, for deliberate iniquity would not have been so quickly or so easily corrected. But on the other hand, the marvelous stolidity of Dathan and Abiram is described, in that they came forth unawed, with their wives and children. Still it is not to be 			 doubted but that they were terrified, after they saw themselves to be stripped of all aid and favor; but although the withdrawal of the people disturbed them, they nevertheless stood like maniacs; nor did fear subdue them or prevent them from proceeding in their fatal audacity to their doom.

<p><a name="ii.xix-p159"></A><b>28.</b> <i>And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know.</i> Moses now begins more clearly to show wherefore he has brought the rebels to this open contest, viz., that God may sanction before the whole people, by a terrible exertion of His power, the system established by Himself. For it was no ordinary 			 effort of confidence to concede the victory to His enemies, unless the earth should swallow them up alive. But, inasmuch as this was to be a most conspicuous judgment of God, he arouses their attention by the striking words he uses. If they should be cut off by a sudden death, he would have justly boasted that his cause was approved by God; but not content with this, he desires to be accounted a mere impostor, if they should die the common death of men. In order to express the strangeness of 			 the miracle, whereby men&#8217;s senses should be ravished, he employs the word <i>create</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">99</FONT></A>
 			  emphatically; as much as to say, that the mode of their death would be no less unusual than as if God should add something to His creation, and change the face of the world. Thus David, when he prays that his enemies should go down alive into hell <i>(infernos) </i>or the grave, seems to allude to this history, (<a name="ii.xix-p160.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023">Ps 55:23</a><a name="ii.xix-p160.1"></A>;) for although that descent be understood to mean sudden death overtaking the wicked in a moment in the midst of their happiness and security, still, he at the same time indicates by it this horrible retribution, which had occurred in times past, inasmuch as memorable punishments pass into proverbial instances of God&#8217;s wrath.</p>

 			  That they should now fly in confusion, lest the same destruction should overwhelm themselves, is a sign of their bad conscience, which is always troubled in itself, and agitates the wicked with sore inquietude.

 			  in his holy fear, and therefore they never reflect without dread on the punishments which God has inflicted upon the crimes of men. But, since hypocrites carry in their hearts a hot iron, as it were, they fall down like dead men, as if the lightning fell from God upon their own heads.

He says that a fire went forth from Jehovah, because it was not kindled naturally, nor accidentally, but was accompanied by conspicuous marks, which showed that it was sent by Him.

He commands, therefore, that a covering for the altar should be made of the censers, in order that none should rashly intrude himself to make the sacred offerings. When He calls them <i>&#8220;hallowed,&#8221; </i>some understand that it was sinful to transfer them to profane purposes, because they had once been devoted to the service of God. I am, however, rather of opinion that they were set apart <i>(sacratas) 			 </i>as things accursed <i>(anathemata.) </i>Thus the fire which had been upon them is scattered afar, in order that the altar should be cleansed from its pollution. Although, however, there was the same pollution in the censers, yet God would have them preserved as accursed, so that all posterity might understand that none but the priests were to be admitted to the sacrifices.

<p><a name="ii.xix-p172"></A><b>41.</b> <i>But on the morrow all the congregation.</i> There is something more than monstrous in this madness of theirs. The conflagration was yet smoking, wherein God had appeared as the awful avenger of pride: the chasm in which the leaders of the rebellion had been swallowed up, must still 			 have been almost before their eyes. God had commanded the plates to be molten, which might record that severe judgment through many succeeding ages. All had confessed by their alarm and hasty flight that there was danger lest they should themselves also be exposed to similar punishments. Yet, on the next day, am if they desired deliberately to provoke God, who was still, as it were, armed, they accuse God&#8217;s holy servants of having been the authors of the destruction, though they had never 			 lifted a finger against their enemies. Was it in the power of Moses to command the earth to open? Could he draw down the fire from heaven at his will? Since, then, both the chasm and the fire were manifest tokens of God&#8217;s wonderful power, why do not these madmen reflect that they are engaging in fatal warfare against Him? For to what purpose was this extraordinary mode of punishment, except that in their terror they might learn to humble themselves beneath God&#8217;s hand? Yet hence did they only 			 derive greater wildness in their audacity, as if they desired to perish voluntarily with these sinners, whose punishment they had just been shuddering at. In two ways they betray their senselessness; first, by substituting Moses and Aaron as guilty of the murder, in place of God; and, secondly, by sanctifying these putrid corpses, as if in despite of God. They accuse Moses and Aaron of the slaughter, of which God had plainly shown Himself to be the author, as they themselves had been compelled 			 to feel. But such is the blindness of the reprobate with respect to God&#8217;s works, that His glory rather stupifies them than excites their admiration. The foulest ingratitude was also added; for they do not consider that only a very few hours had elapsed since they had been preserved by the intercession of Moses from impending destruction. Thus, in their desire to avenge the death of a few, they call those the killers of the people of the Lord, to whom they ought to have been grateful for the 			 safety of all. Again, what arrogance it is to count among the people of God, as if against His will, those reprobates, when He had not only cut them off from His Church, but had also exterminated them from the world, and from the human race! But thus do the wicked wax wanton against God under the very cover of His gifts, and especially they do not hesitate to mock Him with empty titles and outward signs, as the masks of their iniquity.</p>

<p><a name="ii.xix-p174"></A><b>42.</b> <i>And it came to pass when the congregation.</i> From the fact that Moses and Aaron were protected by the covering of the cloud, we gather how uncontrollable was the rage of the people. For, although the glory of God only stood over the tabernacle, so that Moses and Aaron were still 			 exposed to stoning, and any other acts of violence, yet it so dazzled the eyes of these wicked men, that they could not touch the holy persons. Nor can we doubt but that they betook themselves to the sanctuary, because, in the extremity of their danger, the only hope that remained to them was in the help of God. When, therefore, they had fled to this sacred asylum, God received them under the shadow of His wings. Thus did He testify, that the prayers and hopes of His people are never in vain, 			 but that He succors them whenever they call upon Him. For although, now-a-days, He does not appear in a visible abode, still He is nigh unto all those who cast their cares upon Him. It might, indeed, have been the case that the sign of God&#8217;s glory was seen by none but Moses and Aaron, in order that they might be fully assured that God was near to help them; but, since the expression is indefinite, it is probable that God threatened also the frantic multitude, lest they should proceed to any 			 further acts of violence, although the light was presented in vain to them in their blindness.</p>

For tie declares that, as soon as Moses and Aaron have secured themselves, all the rest shall perish in a moment. But incredible was the kindness of both of them, thus humbly to intercede for so ungrateful a people, who deserved to die a hundred times over; for, forgetful of their own lives, which they saw to be imperiled, they were ready to make atonement for the guilt, so as to rescue from death those abandoned wretches who were plotting their destruction. I do not, however, understand this, 			 <i>&#8220;Get </i>you up,&#8221; merely with reference to place, for they were already separated, having taken refuge in the tabernacle; but it is just as if God had commanded them to sever themselves from the people, and, quitting them altogether, and casting away all care for the public welfare, to provide for their own private safety.</p>

For who would not view his impiety with horror, when he is made conscious of having despised and violated that sanctity wherein the Divine power displays itself for life or death? The sight of the censer might have justly availed to subdue their hardness of heart, so that at last they might 			 begin to condemn and detest their unrighteous act. The second warning which it gave them was no less profitable, <i>i.e., </i>that they might perceive that God was only propitiated towards them by virtue of a mediator; but., in so far as the actual state of things allowed, the visible type directed them to the absent Savior. Since, however, men corrupt and obscure the truth by their fond inventions, His majesty is asserted by the Divine institution of 			 sacrifice.

But it is probable that Aaron proceeded so far as to leave behind those who still remained uninjured, and, in the very place where the destruction had occurred, encountered the wrath of God, and arrested its course. Hence it was that both the fervor of his zeal might be the better perceived, and his office of appeasing God was more fully confirmed by its actual 			 success. For what more evident miracle could be required, than when the slaughter, which had both begun to rage suddenly, and then to proceed in a course no less rapid than continuous, was stopped by the arrival of Aaron, exactly as if a hedge had been set up against it? The efficacy of the priesthood in propitiating God, is therefore both clearly and briefly set before us; and hence we are taught, that though we are so dose to the reprobate when they perish, as that their destruction should 			 reach to ourselves, still that we shall be safe from all evil, if only Christ intercede for us.</p>
