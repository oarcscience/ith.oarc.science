32:1-42](../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001.md)<span id="ii.xliv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliv-p3"></span>**1.** Now the children of Reuben and the
children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle; and when they saw
the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a
place for cattle;

<span id="ii.xliv-p4"></span>**1.** Peculium vero multum erat filiis
Ruben, et filiis Gad multum admodum: qui viderunt terram Jaazer et
terram Galaad, et ecce, locus ille erat locus peculii.

<span id="ii.xliv-p5"></span>**2.** The children of Gad and the children
of Reuben, came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and
unto the princes of the congregation, saying,

<span id="ii.xliv-p6"></span>**2.** Venerunt igitur filii Gad et filii
Ruben, et dixerunt ad Mosen et Eleazar sacerdotem, et ad principes
congregationis, dicendo:

<span id="ii.xliv-p7"></span>**3.** Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and
Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

<span id="ii.xliv-p8"></span>**3.** Ataroth, et Dibon, et Jaazer, et
Nimrah, et Heshbon, et Elalech, et Sebam, et Nebo, et Bebon:

<span id="ii.xliv-p9"></span>**4.** Even the country which the Lord
smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy
servants have cattle:

<span id="ii.xliv-p10"></span>**4.** Terra quam percussit Jehova ad
congregationem Israel, terra peculii est, et servis tuis est peculium.

<span id="ii.xliv-p11"></span>**5.** Wherefore, said they, if we have
found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a
possession, and bring us not over Jordan.

<span id="ii.xliv-p12"></span>**5.** Dixerunt, inquam, si invenimus
gratiam in oculis tuis, detur terra haec servis tuis in possessionem: ne
transire nos facias Jordanem.

<span id="ii.xliv-p13"></span>**6.** And Moses said unto the children of
Gad, and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and
shall ye sit here?

<span id="ii.xliv-p14"></span>**6.** Respondit autem Moses filiis Gad,
et Ruben, Num fratres vestri ingredientur pugnam, et vos manebitis hic?

<span id="ii.xliv-p15"></span>**7.** And wherefore discourage ye the
heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the
Lord hath given them?

<span id="ii.xliv-p16"></span>**7.** Et quare frangetis cot filiorum
Israel, ne transeant ad terram quam dedit eis Jehova?

<span id="ii.xliv-p17"></span>**8.** Thus did your fathers, when I sent
them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.

<span id="ii.xliv-p18"></span>**8.** Sic fecerunt patres vestri quando
misi eos de Cades-barnea ut viderent terram istam.

<span id="ii.xliv-p19"></span>**9.** For when they went up unto the
valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the
children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the Lord
had given them.

<span id="ii.xliv-p20"></span>**9.** Ascenderunt namque usque ad vallem
Eschol, videruntque terram, postea fregerunt cor filiorum Israel, ne
ingrederentur terram quam dederat eis Jehova.

<span id="ii.xliv-p21"></span>**10.** And the Lord’s anger was kindled
the same time, and he sware, saying,

<span id="ii.xliv-p22"></span>**10.** Unde irata excandescentia Jehovae
in die illa, juravit dicendo:

<span id="ii.xliv-p23"></span>**11.** Surely none of the men that came
up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land
which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, because they
have not wholly followed me:

<span id="ii.xliv-p24"></span>**11.** Si videbunt homines qui
ascenderunt ex AEgypto, a filio viginti armorum et supra, terram de qua
juravi Abraham, Isaac et Jacob: quia non compleverunt ire post me:

<span id="ii.xliv-p25"></span>**12.** Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh
the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed
the Lord.

<span id="ii.xliv-p26"></span>**12.** Praeter Caleb filium Jephune
Cenezaeum, et Josue filium Nun, quia compleverunt ire post Jehovam.

<span id="ii.xliv-p27"></span>**13.** And the Lord’s anger was kindled
against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years,
until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the Lord was
consumed.

<span id="ii.xliv-p28"></span>**13.** Et irata est excandescentia
Jehovae in Israelem, vagarique fecit eos in deserto quadraginta annis,
donec consumeretur tota ilia generatio quae fecerat malum in oculis
Jehovah.

<span id="ii.xliv-p29"></span>**14.** And, behold, ye are risen up in
your fathers’ stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the
fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel.

<span id="ii.xliv-p30"></span>**14.** Ecce autem surrexistis pro
patribus vestris, accessio hominum sceleratorum, ut adderetis adhuc ad
iram excandescentiae Jehovae contra Israelem.

<span id="ii.xliv-p31"></span>**15.** For if ye turn away from after
him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall
destroy all this people.

<span id="ii.xliv-p32"></span>**15.** Si aversi fueritis ut non eatis
post eum, tum addet adhuc deserere illum ipsum in deserto, et perdetis
universum populum hunc.

<span id="ii.xliv-p33"></span>**16.** And they came near unto him, and
said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our
little ones;

<span id="ii.xliv-p34"></span>**16.** Et accesserunt ad eum, ac
dixerunt, Caulas pecudum aedificabimus peculio nostro hic, et urbes
parvulis nostris:

<span id="ii.xliv-p35"></span>**17.** But we ourselves will go ready
armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto
their place: and our litttle ones shall dwell in the fenced cities,
because of the inhabitants of the land.

<span id="ii.xliv-p36"></span>**17.** Nos vero accincti erimus armis,
festinantes ante filios Israel, donec introduxerimus eos ad locum suum:
et manebunt parvuli nostri in urbibus munitis propier habitatores
terrae.

<span id="ii.xliv-p37"></span>**18.** We will not return unto our
houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his
inheritance:

<span id="ii.xliv-p38"></span>**18.**: Non reverietour ad domos nostras,
donec possideant filii Israel quisque haereditatem suam.

<span id="ii.xliv-p39"></span>**19.** For we will not inherit with them
on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to
us on this side Jordan eastward.

<span id="ii.xliv-p40"></span>**19.** Non enim haereditatem accipiemus
cum eis trans Jordanem et ultra: quod evenerit haereditas nostra nobis
citra Jordanem ad Orientem.

<span id="ii.xliv-p41"></span>**20.** And Moses said unto them, If ye
will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the Lord to war,

<span id="ii.xliv-p42"></span>**20.** Et dixit illis Moses, Si feceritis
hoc, si accinxeritis vos armis coram Jehova ad bellum:

<span id="ii.xliv-p43"></span>**21.** And will go all of you armed over
Jordan before the Lord, until he hath driven out his enemies from before
him,

<span id="ii.xliv-p44"></span>**21.** Et transierint ex vobis omnes
accincti armis ipsum Jordanem ante, Jehovam, donec expulerit inimicos
suos a facie sua,

<span id="ii.xliv-p45"></span>**22.** And the land be subdued before the
Lord; then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the Lord,
and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the
Lord.

<span id="ii.xliv-p46"></span>**22.** Et subjiciatur terra ilia coram
Jehova: postea reveriemini, et eritis absoluti a Jehova, et Israele:
eritque terra ista vobis in possessionem coram Jehova.

<span id="ii.xliv-p47"></span>**23.** But if ye will not do so, behold,
ye have sinned against the Lord: and be sure your sin will find you out.

<span id="ii.xliv-p48"></span>**23.** Quod si non feceritis ita, ecce,
peccastis Jehovae, et perpendite peccatum vestrum quod invenient vos.

<span id="ii.xliv-p49"></span>**24.** Build you cities for your little
ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of
your mouth.

<span id="ii.xliv-p50"></span>**24.** AEdificate vobis ergo civitates
pro parvulis vestris, et caulas ovibus vestris, et quod egressum est ex
ore vestro, facietis.

<span id="ii.xliv-p51"></span>**25.** And the children of Gad, and the
children of Reuben, spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my
lord commandeth.

<span id="ii.xliv-p52"></span>**25.** Et dixerunt filii Gad, et filii
Reuben ad Mosen, dicendo: Servi tui facient quemadmodum dominus meus
praecepit.

<span id="ii.xliv-p53"></span>**26.** Our little ones, our wives, our
flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;

<span id="ii.xliv-p54"></span>**26.** Parvuli nostri, uxores nostrae,
pecora nostra, et omnia jumenta erunt ibi in urbibus Galaad.

<span id="ii.xliv-p55"></span>**27.** But thy servants will pass over,
every man armed for war, before the Lord to battle, as my lord saith.

<span id="ii.xliv-p56"></span>**27.** Servi autem tui transibunt omnes
accincti armis ad militiam coram Jehova ad bellum, quemadmodum dominus
meus loquitur.

<span id="ii.xliv-p57"></span>**28.** So concerning them Moses commanded
Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of
the tribes of the children of Israel:

<span id="ii.xliv-p58"></span>**28.** Et praecepit de eis Moses ipsi
Eleazar sacerdoti, et Josue filio Nun, et principibus patrum tribuum
filiorum Israel:

<span id="ii.xliv-p59"></span>**29.** And Moses said unto them, If the
children of Gad, and the children of Reuben, will pass with you over
Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the Lord, and the land shall
be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a
possession:

<span id="ii.xliv-p60"></span>**29.** Et dixit illis, Si transierint
filii Gad et filii Ruben vobiscum Jordanem, omnes accincti armis ad
bellum coram Jehova, et subjecta fuerit terra coram vobis, dabiris eis
terram Galaad in possessionem:

<span id="ii.xliv-p61"></span>**30.** But if they will not pass over
with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of
Canaan.

<span id="ii.xliv-p62"></span>**30.** Quod si non transierint accincti
armis vobiscum, tum possessionem habebunt in medic vestri in terra
Chenaan.

<span id="ii.xliv-p63"></span>**31.** And the children of Gad, and the
children of Reuben, answered, saying, As the Lord hath said unto thy
servants, so will we do.

<span id="ii.xliv-p64"></span>**31.** Et responderunt filii Gad et
Ruben, dicendo: Quod dixit Jehova servis tuis, sic faciemus.

<span id="ii.xliv-p65"></span>**32.** We will pass over armed before the
Lord into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on
this side Jordan may be ours.

<span id="ii.xliv-p66"></span>**32.** Nos transibimus accincti armis
coram Jehova in terram Chenaan, ut vobiscum sit possessic haereditatis
nostra citra Jordanem.

<span id="ii.xliv-p67"></span>**33.** And Moses gave unto them, even to
the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and unto half the
tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the
Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the
cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round
about.

<span id="ii.xliv-p68"></span>**33.** Dedit itaque illis Moses, filiis
Gad, et filiis Ruben, et dimidiae tribui Manasse filii Joseph, regnum
Sihon regis Amorrhaei, et regnum Og regis Basan, terram cum urbibus
suis, cum terminis, urbes terra per circuitum.

<span id="ii.xliv-p69"></span>**34.** And the children of Gad built
Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

<span id="ii.xliv-p70"></span>**34.** Et redificaverunt filii Gad Dibon,
et Ataroth, et Aroer,

<span id="ii.xliv-p71"></span>**35.** And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer,
and Jogbehah,

<span id="ii.xliv-p72"></span>**35.** Et Atroth, Sopham, et Jaazer, et
Jogbehal,

<span id="ii.xliv-p73"></span>**36.** And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran,
fenced cities; and folds for sheep.

<span id="ii.xliv-p74"></span>**36.** Et Beth-nimrah, et Beth-haran,
urbes munitas et caulas ovium.

<span id="ii.xliv-p75"></span>**37.** And the children of Reuben built
Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,

<span id="ii.xliv-p76"></span>**37.** Filii vero Ruben aedificaverunt
Hesbon, et Eleale, et Ciriathaim,

<span id="ii.xliv-p77"></span>**38.** And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their
names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities
which they builded.

<span id="ii.xliv-p78"></span>**38.** Et Nebo, et Baal-meon versis
nominibus, et Sibmah: et vocaverunt nominibus nomina urbium quas
aedificaverant.

<span id="ii.xliv-p79"></span>**39.** And the children of Machir the son
of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite
which was in it.

<span id="ii.xliv-p80"></span>**39.** Perrexerunt autem filii Machir,
filii Manasse in Galaad, acceperuntque eam, et expulerunt Amorrhaeum qui
erat in ca.

<span id="ii.xliv-p81"></span>**40.** And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir
the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.

<span id="ii.xliv-p82"></span>**40.** Itaque dedit Moses Galaad ipsi
Machir filio Manasse, et habitavit in ea.

<span id="ii.xliv-p83"></span>**41.** And Jair the son of Manasseh went
and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havoth-jair.

<span id="ii.xliv-p84"></span>**41.** Jair praeterea filius Manasse
prorectus erat, et acceperat vicos eorum, et vocavit eos Havoth-Jair.

<span id="ii.xliv-p85"></span>**42.** And Nobah went and took Kenath,
and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.

<span id="ii.xliv-p86"></span>**42.** Nobah similiter profectus erat, et
ceperat Cenah et villas ejus: vocavitque eam Nobah secundum nomen suum.

<span id="ii.xliv-p87"></span> 

<span id="ii.xliv-p88"></span><span id="ii.xliv-p88.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliv-p89"></span>**1.** *Now the children of Reuben and the
children of Gad.* In this narrative we behold, as in a glass, that
whilst each individual is but too attentive to his own private
interests, he forgets what is just and right. Those, indeed, who seek
their own advantage, do not reflect that they are doing injury to
others; but it is impossible for them to avoid seeking more than is
their due, and preferring themselves to others; and thus they sin
against that rule of charity, that we should not seek our own. The sons
of Gad and Reuben, who had a great quantity of cattle, see a tract of
rich and fertile land; self-interest takes possession of them, so that
it does not occur to them that they were under an obligation to their
brethren not to covet for themselves anything peculiar, or separate from
them. Nevertheless, there was a specious pretext for this, whereby their
eyes were blinded, viz., that nothing was taken away from the others,
but rather that so much addition was made; for by these means the whole
country on the other side of Jordan continued to be theirs; and,
besides, they were rather relieved of an inconvenience than exposed to a
loss; since the progress of their expedition would be less difficult, if
the body of persons, who were charged with the cattle, should stay
there, and thus should cease to be an incumbrance to the army, which
would be in lighter condition for advancing. Their association, however,
for the war had been established by God, and bound them by an
indissoluble tie not to desert the rest of the people: whilst it was
also a solemn duty *(religio)* imposed upon them not to alter the bounds
of the inheritance promised by God. The land of Canaan was assigned to
the whole race of Abraham, in which they were to be enclosed, and to
inhabit it as a peculiar world, the tribes of Gad and Reuben now
transgress those limits, and, at the same time disunite themselves from
the body of the Church, as if they desired to be emancipated from God.
Hence ought we to be the more on our guard, lest we should go astray
after our own lusts. And when Moses says, that they *saw,* or
considered, the land, let us learn to beware lest our eyes, by unlawful
looks, should lead us into snares, and blind our minds; and thus that
our senses should be so deceived by the envenomed sweetness, as that
reason and equity should be utterly overthrown.

<span id="ii.xliv-p90"></span>The Hebrew word,  <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md) which we have rendered *peculium,*
signifies not only cattle and herds, but also flocks of sheep. Almost
all the Israelites were indeed possessors of cattle; but we gather from
the words of Moses, that these two tribes were especially rich in them;
perhaps, because the district which they inhabited in Egypt, being more
suited for pasture, had invited them to apply themselves more earnestly
to that mode of life, which was common to all, and had been handed down
to them by their fathers; for it is not probable that they had thus
surpassed the rest in this respect, during the course of their march.

<span id="ii.xliv-p92"></span><span id="ii.xliv-p92.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliv-p93"></span>**2.** *The children of Gad and the
children of Reuben came.* Their request was apparently a reasonable one,
that, since God had driven out the inhabitants of the land, and its
fertility invited them to dwell there, the possession of these empty and
deserted fields should not be denied them. Their modesty also was
praiseworthy, in that they neither detach themselves from the people,
nor seditiously and violently seize upon the places which were so
suitable for them; but seek to obtain them by the permission of Moses
and the elders, as if they submitted their cause to their decision. But
as I have just said, their private interest had so laid hold of their
minds, that the main point did not occur to them, viz., that the land of
Canaan was set before them all, in order that they might dwell together
there separate from heathen nations; and, again, that it was unjust for
them not only to enjoy repose, whilst the others were fighting, but also
to be settled in an assured and peaceable habitation, while the ten
tribes were still advancing to the conquest of the promised land.

<span id="ii.xliv-p94"></span><span id="ii.xliv-p94.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliv-p95"></span>**6.** *And Moses said unto the children
of Gad.* So sharp and severe a reproof shews us the greatness of the
wrong: for neither did inconsiderate warmth carry away Moses into such
violent anger, nor did he fall into error, so as to deliver his opinion
on a point which he did not well understand. He knew, therefore, what
the sons of Gad and Reuben asked; and hence he inveighed against them
thus vehemently, because they desired to lacerate the body of the Church
by this wicked severance. He begins by expostulating with them with
regard to their sinful and unreasonable covetousness, in that they
sought to indulge in idleness, when their brethren were about to march
through a hostile land; for they were possessed of no rightful
superiority, so as to throw upon the others all the labors, perils, and
burdens of the war. Since, therefore, God had imposed the same condition
upon all,  <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) it was not right that
part of them should be exempted from it, as if by privilege. More
severely, however, is their ingratitude and perverseness towards God
chastised, than their injustice towards their brethren, whilst he
alleges to their reproach, that thus the hearts of the children of
Israel would be broken,  <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) so that
they wouht refuse to obey the call of God.

<span id="ii.xliv-p98"></span><span id="ii.xliv-p98.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliv-p99"></span>**8.** *Thus did your fathers.* He
amplifies their crime by reference to their continued perverseness: for
so far is the imitation of ungodly parents from being an excuse for
their children, that it rather doubles their guilt. Thus also does
Stephen allege against the Jews of his days, their persevering in the
sins of their fathers; as if he had cried out against them, that they
were “the bad eggs of bad birds.”

<span id="ii.xliv-p100"></span>“Ye stiff-necked (he says) and
uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as
your fathers did, so do ye.” (<span id="ii.xliv-p100.1"></span>[Ac
7:51](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#051.md)<span
id="ii.xliv-p100.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xliv-p101"></span>So also the Prophet, when he is exhorting
their posterity to obedience, recalls these same circumstances to their
memory:

<span id="ii.xliv-p102"></span>“Harden not your hearts, as in the
provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness, when
your fathers tempted me. Forty years long was I grieved with this
generation,” etc.  
(<span id="ii.xliv-p102.2"></span>[Ps
95:8-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa095.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.xliv-p102.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xliv-p103"></span>It is not without cause that Moses now
complains that there was no end or limit to their impiety, whilst the
sons inherited their fathers’ iniquity, and ceased not to resist God:
and, in order that the similarity and affinity of their crime may be
more apparent, he reviews their history at some length. He does not,
however compare the Reubenites and Gadites to the whole people, but to
the ten spies, from whom the sedition arose, because, as far as in them
lay, they turned aside the people from the right way. Secondly, he
connects with this the punishment which ensued, that, at least, he might
inspire them with terror, since it was hardly to be expected that they
would amend of their own accord. He reminds them, therefore, that, when
God so severely dealt with their fathers, He had given them a signal
proof that their descendants would not be unpunished, unless they were
teachable and submissive. The expression is remarkable, “Because they
fulfilled not after me;”  <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md)
whereby he signifies that there is nothing praiseworthy in the most
vigorous course, unless men persevere even to the goal. And, although
this had happened forty years ago, still, inasmuch as the vengeance
which God had threatened had been before their eyes even to that day, it
behoved them to be just as much affected by it, as if they saw the hand
of God still stretched forth. For, whenever any died in the desert, so
often did God set His seal to His vengeance, lest it should be at any
time buried in oblivion.  <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) If,
then, God had been so wroth with the multitude in general, how much less
should the instigators themselves escape?

<span id="ii.xliv-p106"></span><span id="ii.xliv-p106.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliv-p107"></span>**14.** *And, behold, ye are risen up in
your fathers’ stead.* He signifies that, by their evil doings, they were
“filling up the measure” of their fathers, as Jesus spoke of the Jews of
His own time. In this sense he calls them an addition *(accessio,)*
which word I take to mean a climax *(cumulus.)* For their translation is
a poor one, who render it education, or offspring, or foster-children.
With the Hebrews, <span id="ii.xliv-p107.1"></span>תרבות,  <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) *tarbuth,* is literally an increase,
or multiplication; and thus is applied to usury. This passage, however,
requires that it should be explained as a heap, as much as to say that a
new body of persons were springing up afresh, who carried impiety to its
very height. In a word, he intimates that fuel was added to the fire
which was now smouldering, whereby a new flame was excited: for he says
that they were furnishing materials for God’s wrath, so that it should
burst forth more and more against the whole people.

<span id="ii.xliv-p109"></span><span id="ii.xliv-p109.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliv-p110"></span>**16.** *And they came near tinto him,
and said.* It is probable that they returned after having held a
consultation: and now, — when they had considered what they ought to do,
before promising what they had not previously thought of, — they assent
to the decision of Moses, in accordance with their general opinion. From
their reply itself we gather how usefully the severity of Moses had
influenced their minds. If he had dealt with them with greater mildness
and gentleness, his kindness would perhaps have been received with
contempt. It was more profitable, therefore, that their stubborn hearts
should be smitten with shame and fear, in order that they might lay
aside their rebelliousness. Still, they do not altogether abandon their
request, but devise a middle course, whereby, whilst they do not forsake
their brethren, they may still occupy the land. They promise, then, to
accompany them throughout the whole expedition, and to unite with them
in the war; nay, to be the first to undergo danger, and expose
themselves to the attacks of the enemy, provided a settled abode should
be granted them for their families and their herds. Thus they would be
exempt from guilt, since the rest would not be held back by their bad
example, nor the strength of the people for carrying on the war be
diminished; in one respect only they would have the advantage, that, by
depositing their wives and children in a peaceful spot, they would have
the opportunity of improving their domestic finances.

<span id="ii.xliv-p111"></span><span id="ii.xliv-p111.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliv-p112"></span>**20.** *And Moses said unto them.* Moses
might seem to err on the side of excessive good-nature, in that he
extends the boundaries prescribed by God, in complying with their wish.
For, since their inheritance had been promised them in the land of
Canaan, they ought to have been contented with that as their abode; nor
was it allowable for Moses to make any alteration in the Divine decree.
There is also another thing no less inconsistent, that in a point of so
much perplexity, Moses does not, as usual, consult God, but gives an
immediate answer, which indirectly overthrows the previous ordinance of
God. And, in truth, their desire was by no means excusable, since it
would have never entered their minds, if they had borne in memory the
covenant of God, and had been satisfied with this goodness: since it
cannot be but that the flesh should be constantly running riot, unless
kept under restraint by the calling of God. But God, who knows how to
bring light out of darkness, not only pardoned their error, but takes
occasion also to extend His liberality. Thus the land of Bashan, and its
neighborhood, were added to the former boundaries. At the same time,
however, He shewed on the other hand how much better it would have been
for them to have been kept together, so that they might have mutually
protected each other, and dwelt securely in their appointed habitation.
And, after the lapse of a long period, the Reubenites and Gadites learnt
from experience that they had been too hasty in wishing for the land
which they obtained; nevertheless, through God’s indulgence, that which
might justly have been injurious to them, turned out for their
advantage.

<span id="ii.xliv-p113"></span>We may gather, however, from the result,
that Moses was guilty of no rashness in his interference with the
ordinance, of God, both because he commands that which he now determines
to be ratified and maintained after his death; and when, in the book of
Joshua, it is recorded that the several tribes had their inheritance
assigned to them, this country beyond Jordan is excepted, as having been
granted by Moses to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of Manasseh.
Hence it is evident that his decision was approved by God. Moreover,
since he is there often honored with the title of “servant of God,” we
are taught that nothing was done by him in this matter without the
authority of God, and the guidance of His Spirit. Neither is it at
random that he here so often makes use of God’s name, but rather does he
thus imply that whatever he does is suggested by Him.

<span id="ii.xliv-p114"></span><span id="ii.xliv-p114.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliv-p115"></span>**23.** *But if ye will not do so.* He
makes a solemn protestation that they will deal wickedly, if they break
their promise: and at the same time denounces punishment against them,
as if he were summoning them before the tribunal of God. But, although
he speaks conditionally of that particular engagement, whereby the two
tribes had voluntarily bound themselves, still we may derive from his
words the general doctrine, that, unless we abide by our promises, God
will always be the avenger of fraud and treachery. The expression, “Sin
will find you out,” is more emphatic than as if he had simply said, You
shall not escape God’s hand; for the meaning of it is that vengeance is
so connected with sin, that it cannot be severed from it. Thus, in <span
id="ii.xliv-p115.1"></span>[Ge
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#007.md)<span id="ii.xliv-p115.1"></span>,
it is said, “Sin lieth at the door,” to lay hold at length of the
guilty. For, such is our propensity to sin, that we too often find from
experience that we are encouraged to audacity by God’s forbearance,
whilst we think that we have escaped, if He makes as though He saw us
not for a time.

<span id="ii.xliv-p116"></span><span id="ii.xliv-p116.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliv-p117"></span>**28.** *So concerning them Moses
commanded.* Moses annexes these conditions to his decision, lest, when
the Reubenites and their companions had performed their military tasks:,
they should be falsely alleged to have passed over Jordan for the
purpose of seeking a new home; whilst at the same time, if they should
deceive the other tribes, he provided that their cowardice and deceit
should not profit them. In short, if they assisted their brethren in
pursuance of their agreement, he commands that the territory, which he
now grants them, should always remain theirs; but, if they departed from
their promise, he would have them forced against their will to
participate in the common allotment. For he does not assign them this
portion in the midst of Canaan as a reward for their inertness, in case
they should stay behind; but signifies that they should be forcibly and
authoritatively carried onwards, so as to be subject to their brethren
under all circumstances; since it, was not lawful for them to consult
their own separate interests.

<span id="ii.xliv-p118"></span>In laying down rules for the division of
the land, as if it were soon to happen, he encourages the minds of all
to confidence, so that they should more cheerfully hasten to pass over;
as if the victory were not only already in their hands, but that the
fruits of it were soon to be enjoyed.

<span id="ii.xliv-p119"></span><span id="ii.xliv-p119.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliv-p120"></span>**33.** *And Moses gave unto them.* We
must understand that Moses *gave* it in such sort, as that, relying on
God’s command, he laid down an inviolable law. For, although it is not
expressly stated that God interposed His authority, still His subsequent
approbation fully assures us of it. So also, although no mention is made
of Eleazar and the elders, still it is certain that they were not passed
over, but that they were united with him in the decision; especially
since the case had been brought before them by the sons of Gad and
Reuben, (ver. 2.) There is only an implied contrast between the old
covenant which God had made with Abraham, and this new and special
privilege, wherewith He condescended to enrich His people.

<span id="ii.xliv-p121"></span>At first only the two tribes had been
named; half the tribe of Manasseh is now added, inasmuch as the
descendants of Machir, and Jair, and Noball, who were all of the family
of Manasseh, had seized upon certain cities, and men. The rendering
which some give, as if they  <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) had
obtained these victories after Moses had permitted the Reubenites and
Gadites to inhabit this side of Jordan, does not appear to me suitable;
but rather the reason is given why that portion is excepted, which came
to the sons of Manasseh, viz., because they were not to be defrauded of
the lands which they had separately acquired. Nor is it probable, that,
when the country beyond Jordan had been given to others, they afterwards
made their incursion so as to appropriate what did not belong to them.
The order of the narrative does not make this necessary; for it is
common with the Hebrews to transpose the order of occurrences,
especially when something before omitted is incidentally added to give a
reason for what is done. If, however, any should prefer to believe that
they were attracted by the advantage that presented itself, I will not
pertinaciously contend the point.

<span id="ii.xliv-p123"></span>But how does it accord that cities are
said to be *built* which were still standing undestroyed? for we have
already seen that the people who had taken them, were dwelling in them.
I reply that, inasmuch as it seldom happens that cities are taken
without the walls being destroyed, it is not unreasonable that the
restoration of these should be called *building.* It was necessary that
the cities should be fortified lest the unarmed multitude  <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) should be exposed to the assaults of
every enemy. To this end they repaired what had been thrown down, and
thus in a manner renewed the cities which were a mass of ruins.
