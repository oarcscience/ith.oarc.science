dwelt in the south in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the
children of Israel.

(is vero habitabat in meridie in terra Chanaan) quum ingrederentur filii
Israel.

Although Moses gives no account of a battle, yet he briefly revives the
recollection of the previous history; as much as to say, that in this
part of their journey the Israelites at length met with their enemy,
since they then began to fight with one of the nations of Canaan. In a
word, the meaning is, that this was the beginning of their warfare, when
the land which God had promised them as an inheritance was about to be
occupied.
