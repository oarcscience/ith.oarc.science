<span id="ii.xii-p3"></span>**34.** And the Lord heard the voice of your
words, and was wroth, and aware, saying,

<span id="ii.xii-p4"></span>**34.** Audivit autem Jehova vocem verborum
vestrorum, iratusque est, ac juravit, dicendo:

<span id="ii.xii-p5"></span>**35.** Surely there shall not one of these
men of this evil generation see that good land, which I aware to give
unto your fathers,

<span id="ii.xii-p6"></span>**35.** Non videbit quisquam ex hominibus
illis de generatione mala hac terram bonam quam juravi me daturum
patribus vestris;

<span id="ii.xii-p7"></span>**36.** Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he
shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon,
and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the Lord.

<span id="ii.xii-p8"></span>**36.** Praeter Caleb filium Jephuneh: ipse
enim videbit eam, eique dabo terram quam calcavit, et filiis ejus, eo
quod adimplevit ire post Jehovam.

<span id="ii.xii-p9"></span>**39.** Moreover, your little ones, which ye
said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no
knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them
will I give it, and they shall possess it.

<span id="ii.xii-p10"></span>**39.** Etiam parvuli vestri, de quibus
dixistis, In praedam erunt, ac filii vestri, qui non norunt hodie bonum
nec malum, ipsi intrabunt illuc, illisque dabo eam, et ipsi possidebunt
eam.

<span id="ii.xii-p11"></span>**40.** But as for you, turn you, and take
your journey into the wilderness, by the way of the Red sea.

<span id="ii.xii-p12"></span>**40.** Vos autem conversi proficiscimini
in desertum per viam maris Suph.

<span id="ii.xii-p13"></span><span id="ii.xii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p14"></span>**34.** *And the Lord heard the voice of
your words.* I have shown elsewhere what is meant by God’s hearing,
*i.e.,* that nothing can be concealed from Him, but that tie will take
account of and judge all our words and deeds And this is worthy of our
observation; for men would never dare to murmur against Him, unless they
promised themselves impunity  <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) from
His not being present. Secondly, we learn from hence, that God, who is a
just Judge, does not proceed hastily and without cause to inflict
punishment on men, and that He does not manifest severity without a full
examination of the case. He, therefore, means that they deprived
themselves of their assured inheritance, when they were close upon
receiving it, through their own rebellion and depravity.

<span id="ii.xii-p16"></span><span id="ii.xii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p17"></span>**39.** *Moreover, your little ones.* I
have already shown that God so tempered His judgment that, whilst none
of the guilty should escape with impunity, still His faithfulness should
remain sure and inviolable, and that the wickedness of men should not
make void the covenant which He had made with Abraham. He, therefore,
pronounces sentence upon them, that they should never enjoy the
inheritance which they had despised: yet declares that He will
nevertheless be true in the fulfillment of what He had promised, and
will display His mercy towards their children, whom in their despair
they had condemned to be a prey to their enemies.

<span id="ii.xii-p18"></span>When He limits this grace to their little
ones, whose age did not yet allow them to discern between good and evil,
He signifies that all who had already arrived at the years of reason,
were, from the least to the greatest, accomplices in the crime, since
the contagion had spread through the whole body. Surely it was an
incredible prodigy, that so great a multitude should be so carried away
by diabolical fury, as that nothing should remain unaffected by it,
unless perhaps a timely death removed some of the old men rather on
account of the vice of others than their own. But, if even a hundredth
part of them had been guiltless of the crime, God would have left some
survivors.

<span id="ii.xii-p19"></span>“To have no knowledge of good and evil,” is
equivalent to being unable “to discern between their right hand and
their left hand;” by which expression in Jonah, (<span
id="ii.xii-p19.1"></span>[Jon
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jon004.htm#011)<span id="ii.xii-p19.1"></span>,.md)
God exempts from condemnation those little ones, who have as yet no
power of forming a judgment. From hence, however, some have foolishly
attempted to prove that infant-children are not defiled by original sin;
and that men are involved in no guilt, except such as they have
severally contracted by their own voluntary act *(arbitrio.)* For the
question here is not as to the nature of the human race; a distinction
is simply made between children and those who have consciously and
willfully provoked God’s wrath; whereas the corruption, which is the
root (of all evils,  <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75) .md) although it
may not immediately produce its fruit in actual sins, is not  <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) therefore non-existent.
