<span id="ii.i-p3"></span>**6.** The Lord our God spoke unto us in
Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:

<span id="ii.i-p4"></span>**6.** Jehova Deus noster loquutus est nobis
in Horeb, dicendo: Sat vobis est habitasse in monte isto.

<span id="ii.i-p5"></span>**7.** Turn you, and take your journey, and go
to the mount of the Arnorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto,
in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by
the sea-side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the
great river, the river Euphrates.

<span id="ii.i-p6"></span>**7.** Vertite vos, et proficiscimini, et ite
ad montem Amorrhmorum, et ad omnes vicinos ejus, in solitudine, in
monte, et planitie, et rueridle, et in littore marls, terrain Chenanaei
a Lebanon usque ad flumen magnum flumen Euphraten.

<span id="ii.i-p7"></span>**8.** Behold, I have set the land before you:
go in and possess the land which the Lord. swore unto your fathers,
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them, and to their seed after
them.

<span id="ii.i-p8"></span>**8.** Vide, dedi coram vobis terram,
ingredimini, et possidete terram illam quam juravit Jehova patribus
vestris, Abraham, Isaac et Jacob, se daturum eis, et semini eorum post
ipsos.

<span id="ii.i-p9"></span><span id="ii.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p10"></span>**6.** *The Lord our God spoke to us in
Horeb.* In this Second Narration, Moses expressly declares that God not
only gave them a visible sign, by uplifting the cloud, but that He also
verbally commanded the people to leave Mount Sinai, and to set about the
performance of the rest of their journey. God says, then, that enough
time had been spent in one place;  <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0)
for, before they left it, an entire year had passed away there. Although
there were eleven days’ journey before them before they would arrive at
Kadesh-barnea, nevertheless, lest anything should delay the people, who
were naturally but too indolent, tie stimulates them by setting before
them the ease with which it might be accomplished, telling them that
they had but to lift up their feet and advance, in order to attain the
promised rest.
