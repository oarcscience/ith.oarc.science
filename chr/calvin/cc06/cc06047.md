<span id="ii.xlvi-p3"></span>**41.** Then Moses severed three cities on
this side Jordan, toward the sun-rising;

<span id="ii.xlvi-p4"></span>**41.** Tunc separavit Moses tres urbes
trans Jordanem ad exortum solis:

<span id="ii.xlvi-p5"></span>**42.** That the slayer might flee thither,
which should kill his neighbor unawares, and hated him not in times
past; and that, fleeing unto one of these cities, he might live:

<span id="ii.xlvi-p6"></span>**42.** Ut fugeret illuc homicida qui
occidisset proximum suum nesciens, (vel, per errorem, vel, per
incogitantiam,) quem non odisset ab heri et nudiustertius: ut fugeret ad
unam ex urbibus istis, et viveret.

<span id="ii.xlvi-p7"></span>**43.** Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in
the plain country of the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the
Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.

<span id="ii.xlvi-p8"></span>**43.** Bezer in deserto, in terra
planitiei a Rubenitis: Ramoth Galaad a Gaditis, et Golan in Basan a
Manasse.

<span id="ii.xlvi-p10"></span><span id="ii.xlvi-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlvi-p11"></span>God had destined, as we have before seen,
 <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220) six cities for refuge, in case
any one had killed a man, provided he could prove his innocence before
the judges. As to the three which He had appointed on the other side of
Jordan, Moses records that he had faithfully performed what God had
commanded. Hence it appears that, although he could not immediately
comply with God’s command to its full extent, still he did not wait
until the three other cities could be added; but that, as far as
circumstances permitted, he discharged his duty. Hence let us learn
that, even when we cannot at once entirely carry out what God commands
us to do, we are still to be by no means idle. For nothing but sheer
laziness stands in our way, unless we speedily commence at God’s command
what it is His will to finish and accomplish by the hands of others.
