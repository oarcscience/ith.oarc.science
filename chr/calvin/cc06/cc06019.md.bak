<span id="ii.xviii-p3"></span>**32.** And while the children of Israel
were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the
Sabbath-day.

<span id="ii.xviii-p4"></span>**32.** Quum autem essent filii Israel in
deserto, invenerunt virum colligentem ligna die Sabbathi:

<span id="ii.xviii-p5"></span>**33.** And they that found him gathering
sticks brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

<span id="ii.xviii-p6"></span>**33.** Et adduxerunt illum qui invenerunt
colligentem ligna, ad Mosen et Aharon, et universam congregationem.

<span id="ii.xviii-p7"></span>**34.** And they put him in ward, because
it was not declared what should be done to him.

<span id="ii.xviii-p8"></span>**34.** Qui posuerunt eum in custodiam:
quia nondum patefactum erat quid faciendum esset ei.

<span id="ii.xviii-p9"></span>**35.** And the Lord said unto Moses, The
man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him
with stones without the camp.

<span id="ii.xviii-p10"></span>**35.** Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen,
Moriendo moriatur vir ille: lapidet eum lapidibus universa congregatio
extra castra.

<span id="ii.xviii-p11"></span>**36.** And all the congregation brought
him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the
Lord commanded Moses.

<span id="ii.xviii-p12"></span>**36.** Eduxerunt ergo eum congregatio
extra castra, et lapidaverunt eum lapidibus, et mortuus est, quemadmodum
praeceperat Jehova Mosi.

<span id="ii.xviii-p13"></span> 

<span id="ii.xviii-p14"></span><span id="ii.xviii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xviii-p15"></span>**32.** *And while the children of
Israel.* Since we know not in what year, or in what month this happened,
it appeared that nothing would be better than to follow the context of
Moses. This history shows that the Israelites were not always affected
by the same degree of madness, so as to be rebellious against God; since
in this instance their moderation is no less manifested than the
fervency of their pious zeal. But as one swallow does not make spring,
so we shall form an incorrect judgment of men’s whole lives from one
noble action. The transgressor of the law is brought to Moses and Aaron,
whose authority retains the whole people in the path of duty. Their
humility is also worthy of praise, in that they quietly wait for the
decision of God; and finally, must be added, their energy in executing
the punishment as soon as God has declared the sentence. You would say
that in every point they were rightly conformed to the rules of piety;
but, since the most trifling occasion immediately led them astray, their
hypocrisy was discovered by this great levity of conduct.

<span id="ii.xviii-p16"></span>This, however, is the sum of the history,
that by the death of one man the obligation of the Sabbath was
sanctioned, so that it might *henceforth* be held in greater reverence.
It might indeed be the case that these men, who brought the transgressor
of the Sabbath, were careless in other matters, and, as is usual with
hypocrites, were excessively rigid in their assertion of the claims of
an outward ceremony. From the punishment, however, we may infer that the
criminal himself had not erred through inadvertence, but in gross
contempt of the Law, so as to think nothing of subverting and corrupting
all things sacred. Sometimes, indeed, God has severely avenged
inconsideration in the pollution of holy things; but it is probable that
He would not have commanded this man to be stoned, unless he had been
convicted of willful crime. Moreover, by this severity God testified how
much stress He laid upon the observance of the Sabbath. The reason of
this has been elsewhere set forth,  <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md)
viz., that by this mark and symbol He had separated His chosen people
from heathen nations. Whence also arose the main reproach against the
Jews, when they were called Sabbatarians.  <span
id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md)

<span id="ii.xviii-p19"></span>But it must be borne in mind that the
worship of God was not to consist in mere idleness and festivity; and
therefore that what God enjoined respecting the seventh day had another
object: not only that they should then employ themselves in meditating
upon His works, but that, renouncing themselves and their own works,
they should live unto God.

<span id="ii.xviii-p20"></span>Furthermore, this case shows us in
general that the magistracy is appointed no less for the maintenance of
the First Table, than the Second; so that, if they inflict punishment
upon murder, adultery, and theft, they should also vindicate the worship
of God: for it is to be observed that the man was not stoned by a mere
unreflecting impulse, but by the direct command of God. They knew,
indeed, what he had deserved before God’s tribunal; but, since no
political law had been given on this head, Moses was unwilling to come
to any decision except by the authority of God.

<span id="ii.xviii-p18"></span> Martial, *lib.* 4, *epigr.* 4, speaks of
“jejunia Sabbatariorum,” in a connection which makes it highly probable
that it was a kind of nickname for the Jews.
