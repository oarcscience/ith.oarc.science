<span id="ii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 33

<span id="ii.i"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p1"></span><span id="ii.i-p1.1"></span>[Isaiah
33:1-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md)<span id="ii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou
*wast* not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not
treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be
spoiled; *and* when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they
shall deal treacherously with thee.

<span id="ii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Vae qui spolias, nec fuisti spoliatus;
qui inique agis, nec inique actum in to fuit! Ubi desieris spoilare,
spoliaberis; ubi tinem inique agendi feceris, inique in to agetur.

<span id="ii.i-p4"></span>**2.** O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have
waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in
the time of trouble.

<span id="ii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Iehova, miserere nostri; in to
speravimus; esto, qui fuisti brachium eorum in matutinis, etiam salus
nostra in tempore tribulationis.

<span id="ii.i-p6"></span>**3.** At the noise of the tumult the people
fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.

<span id="ii.i-p7"></span>**3.** A voce tumultus fugerunt pcpuli; ab
exaltatione tua dissipatae sunt gentes.

<span id="ii.i-p8"></span>**4.** And your spoil shall be gathered *like*
the gathering of the caterpillar: as the running to and fro of locusts
shall he run upon them.

<span id="ii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et colligetur praeda vestra collectione
bruchorum; secundum discursum locustarum pergens illuc.

<span id="ii.i-p10"></span>**5.** The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth
on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.

<span id="ii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Exaltatus est Iehova, qui habitat in
excelsis. Implevit Sion judicio et justitia.

<span id="ii.i-p12"></span>**6.** And wisdom and knowledge shall be the
stability of thy times, *and* strength of salvation: the fear of the
LORD *is* his treasure.

<span id="ii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et erit stabilitas temporum tuorum
fortitudo, salutes, sapientia, et scientia; timor Jehovae ipse thesaurus
ejus.

<span id="ii.i-p14"></span>**7.** Behold, their valiant ones shall cry
without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.

<span id="ii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Ecce nuncii eorum vociferabuntur
foris; legati pacis amare flebunt.

<span id="ii.i-p16"></span>**8.** The highways lie waste, the wayfaring
man ceaseth; he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities,
he regardeth no man.

<span id="ii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Desolatae sunt viae, cessavit viator;
irritum fecit foedus, sprevit civitates, nihil reputavit hominem.

<span id="ii.i-p18"></span>**9.** The earth mourneth *and* languisheth:
Lebanon is ashamed *and* hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and
Bashan and Carmel shake off *their fruits.*

<span id="ii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Luxit, emarcuit terra; pudefactus est
Libanus et succisus; facta est Saron instar deserti; excussus est Basan
et Carmelus.

<span id="ii.i-p20"></span>**10.** Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now
will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.

<span id="ii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Nunc surgam, dicit Jehova; nunc
exaltabor, nunc extollar.

<span id="ii.i-p22"></span>**11.** Ye shall conceive chaff; ye shall
bring forth stubble: your breath, *as* fire, shall devour you.

<span id="ii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Concipietis quisquilias, parietis
stipulas; spiritus vestri ignis devorabit vos.

<span id="ii.i-p24"></span>**12.** And the people shall be *as* the
burnings of lime: *as* thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.

<span id="ii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et erunt populi combustiones calcis,
*(vel, calx combusta,)* tanquam spinae abscissae igni exurentur.

<span id="ii.i-p26"></span>**13.** Hear, ye *that are* far off, what I
have done; and, ye *that are* near, acknowledge my might.

<span id="ii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Andite, qui longe abestis, quid
fecerim; cognoscite, vicini, potentiam meam.

<span id="ii.i-p28"></span>**14.** The sinners in Zion are afraid;
fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with
the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

<span id="ii.i-p29"></span>**14.** Expaverunt in Sion impii; terror
apprehendit hypocritas *(vel, sceleratos.)* Quis ex nobis *(vel, pro
nobis)* habitabit cam igne devorante? Quis ex nobis habitabit cum
ardoribus aeternis?

<span id="ii.i-p30"></span>**15.** He that walketh righteously, and
speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that
shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from
hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;

<span id="ii.i-p31"></span>**15.** Ambulans injustitiis, loquens recta,
aspernars lucrum ex vi et calumnia, excutiens manus suas a susceptione
muneris; obturans aurem suam, ne audiat sanguines; comprimens oculos
suos, ne videat malum.

<span id="ii.i-p32"></span>**16.** He shall dwell on high: his place of
defence *shall be* the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his
waters *shall be* sure.

<span id="ii.i-p33"></span>**16.** Hic in excelsis habitabit;
propugnacula petrarum asylum ejus; huic panis dabitur, et aquae ejus
certae (erunt.)

<span id="ii.i-p34"></span>**17.** Thine eyes shall see the king in his
beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.

<span id="ii.i-p35"></span>**17.** Regem in decore suo videbunt oculi
tui; videbunt terram procul remotam.

<span id="ii.i-p36"></span>**18.** Thine heart shall meditate terror.
Where *is* the scribe? where *is* the receiver? where *is* he that
counted the towers?

<span id="ii.i-p37"></span>**18.** Cor tuum meditabitur terrorem. Ubi
scriba? Ubi appensor? Ubi qui annotat domos insigniores?

<span id="ii.i-p38"></span>**19.** Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a
people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering
tongue, *that thou canst* not understand.

<span id="ii.i-p39"></span>**19.** Popalum trucem non videbis, populum
abstrusi labii, ut non intelligas; linguae balbae, ut non capins.

<span id="ii.i-p40"></span>**20.** Look upon Zion, the city of our
solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a
tabernacle *that* shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof
shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.

<span id="ii.i-p41"></span>**20.** Aspice Sionem civitatem solennitatum
*(vel, conventuum)* nostrarum; oculi tui videbunt Ierusalem, habitaculum
tranquillum, tentorium quod non transferetur; cujus paxilli non
amovebuntur in seculum, et cujus funes cuncti non rumpentur.

<span id="ii.i-p42"></span>**21.** But there the glorious LORD *will be*
unto us a place of broad rivers *and* streams; wherein shall go no
galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.

<span id="ii.i-p43"></span>**21.** Adeo *(vel, quia si)* illic fortis
nobis Iehova locus fluminum, rivorum spatiis amplorum, per quem non
transibit navis remigum, et per quem navis magnifica non pertransibit.

<span id="ii.i-p44"></span>**22.** For the LORD *is* our judge, the LORD
*is* our lawgiver, the LORD *is* our king; he will save us.

<span id="ii.i-p45"></span>**22.** Quia Iehova judex noster, Iehova
legislator noster, Iehova rex noster; idem servabit nos.

<span id="ii.i-p46"></span>**23.** Thy tacklings are loosed; they could
not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is
the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.

<span id="ii.i-p47"></span>**23.** Laxati sunt funes tui, ut non
solidaverint malum suum, neque expanderint velum; tunc divisa est praeda
spolii multi, claudi quoque dirlpuerunt praedam.

<span id="ii.i-p48"></span>**24.** And the inhabitant shall not say, I
am sick: the people that dwell therein *shall be* forgiven *their*
iniquity.

<span id="ii.i-p49"></span>**24.** Nec dicet habitator, *A*Egrotus sum;
populus habitans in ea solutus est ab iniquitate.

<span id="ii.i-p50"></span> 

<span id="ii.i-p51"></span><span id="ii.i-p51.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p52"></span>**1.** *Wo to thee that spoilest.* If these
words shall be expounded as relating to the Babylonians, the strain will
flow easily enough; for, after having promised freedom to the prisoners,
(<span id="ii.i-p52.1"></span>[Isa
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015)<span id="ii.i-p52.1"></span>,.md)
he now appropriately taunts the conquerors. Besides, they needed to be
peculiarly confirmed, that they might give credit to a prediction which
appeared to be incredible; for they could not think it probable that
such vast power would be destroyed and overthrown, and that, the
wretched prisoners who were now in a state of despair would speedily be
permitted to return to their native country. Amidst such distresses,
therefore, they might have fainted and given up all hope of safety, if
the Prophet had not met them with these exhortations. Accordingly, he
anticipates those doubts which might have tormented their minds and
tempted them to despair, after having been carried away by the
Babylonians, and reduced to slavery; for they saw none of those things
which are here promised, but everything entirely opposite.

<span id="ii.i-p53"></span>Yet, as it is almost universally agreed that
this is the beginning of a new discourse, and that it is addressed to
Sennacherib and his army, I am not unwilling to believe that the Prophet
pronounces against the Assyrians, who unjustly oppressed all their
neighbors, a threatening which was intended to alleviate the distresses
and anxieties of the people. He therefore means that there will be a
wonderful revolution of affairs, which will overthrow the flourishing
condition of Nineveh, though it appears to be invincible; for the
Babylonians will come in a hostile manner to punish them for that
cruelty which they exercised on other nations.

<span id="ii.i-p54"></span>In order to impart greater energy to this
discourse, he addresses the Assyrians themselves, *“Wo to thee that
plunderest;* you may now ravage with impunity; no one has power to
resist you; but there will one day be those who in their turn shall
plunder you, as you have plundered others.” He speaks to them in the
singular number, but in a collective sense, which is very customary.
Others read it as a question, “Shalt thou not be spoiled? Dost thou
think that thou wilt never be punished for that violence? There will one
day be those who will render to thee the like.” But we may follow the
ordinary exposition, according to which the Prophet exhibits in a
striking light the injustice of enemies, who were so eager for plunder
that they spared nobody, not even the innocent who had never injured
them; for that is a demonstration of the utmost cruelty. I am therefore
the more disposed to adopt this exposition, according to which he
describes in this first clause what the Assyrians are, shews them to be
base and cruel robbers, and gives a strong exhibition of their cruelty
in harassing and pillaging harmless and inoffensive persons; so that,
when the Jews beheld such unrestrained injustice, they might consider
that God is just, and that such proceedings will not always pass
unpunished.

<span id="ii.i-p55"></span>*When thou shalt have ceased to plunder.*
This is the second clause of the sentence, by which the Prophet declares
that the Assyrians now plunder, because God has given loose reins to
them, but that he will one day check them, so that they will have no
power to do injury. If we were to understand him to mean, “when they
would no longer wish to plunder,” that would be a feeble interpretation;
but the Prophet advances higher, and declares that the time will come
“when they shall make an end of plundering,” because the Lord will
restrain and subdue them. The meaning is therefore the same as if he had
said, “When thou shalt have reached the height;” for we see that tyrants
have boundaries assigned to them which they cannot pass. Their career is
rapid, so long as they keep their course; but as soon as the goal, their
utmost limit, has been reached, they must stop.

<span id="ii.i-p56"></span>Let us cheer our hearts with this
consolation, when we see tyrants insolently and fiercely attack the
Church of God; for the Lord will at length compel them to stop, and the
more cruel they have been, the more severely will they be punished. The
Lord will destroy them in a moment; for he will raise up against them
enemies who will instantly ruin and punish them for their iniquities.

<span id="ii.i-p57"></span>Here we ought also to acknowledge the
providence of God in the overthrow of kingdoms; for wicked men imagine
that everything moves at random and by the blind violence of fortune;
but we ought to take quite another view, for the Lord will repay their
deserts, so that they shall be made to know that the cruelty which they
exercised against inoffensive persons does not remain unrevenged. And
the event shewed the truth of this prediction; for not long afterwards
Nineveh was conquered by the Babylonians, and lost the monarchy, and was
even so completely destroyed that it lost its name. But as Babylon, who
succeeded in her room, was not. less a “spoiler,” the Prophet justly
foretells that there will be other robbers to rob her, and that the
Babylonians, when their monarchy shall be overthrown, will themselves be
plundered of those things which they seized and pillaged from others.

<span id="ii.i-p58"></span><span id="ii.i-p58.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p59"></span>**2.** *O Jehovah, have pity upon us.* This
sentiment was added by the Prophet, in order to remind the godly where
they ought to go amidst such distresses, even when they shall appear to
be deprived of all hope of safety; that they ought to betake themselves
to prayer, to supplicate from God the fulfillment of these promises,
even when they shall be most wretched, and when the power of the enemy
to oppress them cruelly shall be very formidable. And here we ought
carefully to observe the order which the Prophet has followed, in first
exhibiting the promise of God and immediately exhorting to prayer. Not
only so, but he breaks off the stream of his discourse, and suddenly
bursts out into prayer; for although the Lord hastens to perform what he
has promised, yet he delays for a time, in order to exercise our
patience. But when we ought to wait, there is found in us no
steadfastness or perseverance; our hearts immediately faint and.
languish. We ought, therefore, to have recourse to prayer, which alone
can support and gladden our hearts, while we look earnestly towards God,
by whose guidance alone we shall be delivered from our distresses. Yet
let us patiently, with unshaken hope and confidence, expect what he has
promised to us; for at length he will shew that he is faithful, and will
not disappoint us.

<span id="ii.i-p60"></span>At the same time the Prophet bids us not only
consider in general the judgment of God against the Assyrians, but God’s
fatherly kindness towards his chosen people; as if he had said that the
Assyrians will be destroyed, not only that they may receive the just
reward of their avarice and cruelty, but because in this manner God will
be pleased to provide for the safety of his Church. But while he exhorts
us to pray for mercy, he likewise declares that we shall be miserable.

<span id="ii.i-p61"></span>*In thee have we hoped.* In order to cherish
the hope of obtaining favor, believers next declare that they “have
hoped in God,” on whom they now call; and indeed our prayers must be
idle and useless, if they are not founded on this principle.

<span id="ii.i-p62"></span>“Let thy mercy be upon us,” saith David,  
“according as we have hoped in thee.” (<span id="ii.i-p62.2"></span>[Ps
33:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#022)<span id="ii.i-p62.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.i-p63"></span>For to go into the presence of God, if he did
not open up the way by his word, would be excessively rash; and,
therefore, as he kindly and gently invites us, so we ought to embrace
his word, whenever we approach to him. Besides, patience must be added
to faith; and, therefore, when faith is taken away, we do not deserve
that the Lord should hear us, for it is by faith that we call upon him.
Now faith alone is the mother of calling on God, as is frequently
declared in many passages of Scripture; and if faith be wanting, there
can be nothing left in us but hypocrisy, than which nothing is more
abhorred by God. (<span id="ii.i-p63.1"></span>[Ro
10:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#014)<span id="ii.i-p63.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.i-p64"></span>And hence it is evident that there is no
Christianity in the whole of Popery; for if the chief part of the
worship of God consists of prayer, and if they know not what it is to
pray, (for they bid us continually doubt, and even accuse of rashness
the faith of the godly,) what kind of worshippers of God are they? Can
that prayer be lawful which is perplexed by uncertainty, and which does
not rely with firm confidence on the promises of God? Do not those
Rabbins, who wish to be reckoned theologians, shew that they are mere
babes? Certainly our children excel them in knowledge and in the true
light of godliness.  <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

<span id="ii.i-p66"></span>Let us also learn from these words that our
faith is proved by adversity; for the actual trial of faith is when,
with unshaken patience in opposition to all dangers and assaults, we
continue to rely on the word and the promises. Thus we shall give
practical evidence that we have sincerely believed.

<span id="ii.i-p67"></span>*Be what thou hast been, their arm in the
morning.* Others render it as if it were a continued prayer, “Be our arm
in the morning, and our salvation in tribulation.” As to believers
speaking in the third person, they consider it to be a change which is
frequently employed by the Hebrews. But I think that the Prophet’s
meaning is different; for he intended to express that desire which is
rendered more intense by benefits formerly received; and, therefore, in
my opinion, that clause is appropriately inserted, “their arm in the
morning,” in which I supply the words “who hast been,” in order to bring
forward the ancient benefits bestowed by God on the fathers. “Thou,
Lord, didst hearken to the prayers of our fathers; when they fled to
thee, thou gavest them assistance i now also be thou our salvation, and
relieve us from our afflictions.”

<span id="ii.i-p68"></span>“Arm” and “salvation” differ in this respect,
that “arm” denotes the power which the Lord exerted in defense of his
Church, and that before she was afflicted; while “salvation” denotes the
deliverance by which the Lord rescues the Church, even when she appears
to be ruined. He therefore places on record ancient benefits which the
Lord formerly bestowed on the fathers, that he may be moved to exercise
the same compassion towards the children. As if he had said, “O Lord,
thou didst formerly turn away the dangers which threatened thy Church;
relying on thy favor she flourished and prospered. Thou didst also
deliver her when oppressed. In like manner wilt thou act on our own
account, especially since it belongs to thy character to render
assistance when matters are desperate and at the worst.”  <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)

<span id="ii.i-p70"></span>The particle <span id="ii.i-p70.1"></span>אף,
*(aph,) even,* is very emphatic for confirming our faith, that we may
not doubt that God, who always continues to be like himself, and never
degenerates from his nature or swerves from his purpose, will also be
our deliverer; for, such have believers found him to be. We ought,
therefore, to place continually before our eyes the manner in which the
Lord formerly assisted and delivered the fathers, that we may be fully
convinced that we also shall not fail to obtain from him assistance and
deliverance.

<span id="ii.i-p71"></span><span id="ii.i-p71.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p72"></span>**3.** *At the voice of the tumult the
peoples fled.* He now returns to the former doctrine, or rather he
continues it, after having inserted a short exclamation. He had already
shewn that the Assyrians would be defeated, though they appeared to be
out of the reach of all danger; and now he bids the Jews look upon it as
having actually taken place; for their power was vast, and all men
dreaded them and reckoned them invincible. Isaiah therefore places
before the eyes of the Jews the dreadful ruin of the Assyrians, as if it
had been already accomplished. He makes use of the plural number, saying
that they were *peoples;* for the kingdom of the Assyrians consisted of
various “peoples,” and their army had been collected out of various
nations; and therefore he affirms that, although their number was
prodigious and boundless, yet they would miserably perish.

<span id="ii.i-p73"></span>*At thy exaltation.* The word “exaltation” is
explained by some to mean the “manifestation” by which the Lord
illustriously displayed what he was able to do. But I explain it in a
more simple manner, that the Lord, who formerly seemed as it were to
remain at rest, when he permitted the Babylonians to ravage with
impunity, now suddenly came forth to public view; for his delay was
undoubtedly treated with proud scorn by the enemies, as if the God of
Israel had been humbled and vanquished; but at length he arose and sat
down on his judgmentseat, and took vengeance on the crimes of the
ungodly. There is therefore an implied contrast between the “exaltation”
and that kind of weakness which the Lord appeared to exhibit, when he
permitted his people to be afflicted and scattered.  <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md)

<span id="ii.i-p75"></span>By “the voice of the tumult” some suppose to
be meant that the Lord will put the enemies to flight by merely making a
noise; but that interpretation, I fear, is more ingenious than solid. I
therefore willingly interpret the word “voice” to mean the loud noise
which would be raised by the Medes and Persians.

<span id="ii.i-p76"></span><span id="ii.i-p76.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p77"></span>**4.** *And your prey shall be gathered.*
Here he addresses the Assyrians, if it be not thought preferable to
refer it to the Jews, and to take the word “prey” in an active sense.
But the former opinion is more *appropriate;* and this sudden turn of
direct address imparts great vehemence to the prediction, when he openly
and expressly taunts the proud adversaries. Yet it is doubtful whether
it denotes the final ruin of the nation, or the defeat of King
Sennacherib, when his army was destroyed by the hand of an angel before
the walls of Jerusalem. (<span id="ii.i-p77.1"></span>[2Ki
19:35](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#035)<span id="ii.i-p77.1"></span>..md)
The latter opinion has been adopted by almost all commentators, but it
appears to me to be too limited; for I think that the Prophet, from the
beginning of the chapter, intended to express something more, when he
spoke of the destruction of that nation, The prophecy might even be
still farther extended, as I suggested a little ago, so as to include
likewise the Babylonians, who were the latest enemies of the Church;
but, passing this, it is sufficiently evident that his pen is directed
against the monarchy of Nineveh.

<span id="ii.i-p78"></span>*By your gathering of caterpillars.* He
compares that warlike nation to “caterpillars,” because they will have
no power to resist, but will all tremble and faint, so that they shall
be gathered into large heaps to be destroyed. The comparison is highly
appropriate, and is employed also by the Prophet Nahum, (<span
id="ii.i-p78.1"></span>[Na 3:15](../../../bib/kjv/nah003.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.i-p78.1"></span>,) though in a somewhat different sense; for that
insect, we know, is exceedingly destructive to trees, and exceedingly
hurtful, so that it may justly be called The calamity of the earth. But
as their vast number gives no power to defend themselves, even children
can easily shake off, and gather, and slay them in heaps wherever they
meet with them. This also, the Prophet declares, will befall those
insatiable robbers; for, although they did much injury by plundering for
a long period, they will at length be slain and destroyed without the
smallest effort; because, deprived of manly vigor, and almost of life,
they will fall into the power of their enemies; and the wealth of
Nineveh, amassed by robbery, shall be carried to Babylon.

<span id="ii.i-p79"></span>*According to the running of locusts.* He now
adds another comparison, that the Babylonians will “run like locusts,”
to devour the whole country; for those creatures, being exceedingly
voracious, and moving forward without interruption, and leaping with
astonishing rapidity, consume all the fruits of the earth. Some refer it
to the same Assyrians, as if the Prophet compared them to “locusts,”
because they will be easily dispersed; but that interpretation does not
apply, for the Prophet draws up an army of “locusts,” so as completely
to cover in its march the whole land; and he beautifully draws a
comparison between the “caterpillars” and the “locusts,” on account of
their insatiable avarice and vast numbers.

<span id="ii.i-p80"></span><span id="ii.i-p80.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p81"></span>**5** *Jehovah is exalted.* He explains more
fully what we briefly noticed a little before, about the exaltation of
God, and follows out the subject which we formerly mentioned, that the
destruction of a monarchy so powerful will make it evident how highly
God values the salvation of his Church, for whose sake he will utterly
ruin Nineveh, the queen of cities, and her inhabitants. This lesson is
highly useful, that God does not spare reprobate and irreligious men;
for, by opposing their unlawful desires, his object is to testify how
much he loves his elect; and it is no ordinary consolation that the
glory of God shines most brightly in the salvation of the Church.

<span id="ii.i-p82"></span>*Who dwelleth on high.* First, he declares
that God is raised “on high,” whereas wicked men imagine that he was
east down and humbled by the destruction of the people. Again, lest any
one should think that God has only recovered what he lost, as it
frequently happens in the world that they who have been vanquished, as
soon as a favorable change takes place, again put forth fresh vigor, he
expressly declares that God is “exalted” before the eyes of men, because
this is due to him on account of his greatness, for he inhabiteth the
heavens. Hence it follows, that although he frequently conceals his
power, yet he never loses his right, but, whenever he thinks proper,
openly displays his exalted rank; for to dwell “in the heavens” denotes,
as we know, supreme authority, to which the whole world is subject.
(<span id="ii.i-p82.1"></span>[Ps
115:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003)<span id="ii.i-p82.1"></span>..md)
In this manner he not only shews that God can easily and readily cast
down all that is lofty in the world, but argues from God’s eternal
nature, that when God is despised by wicked men, he cannot, at length,
do otherwise than manifest his glory; for otherwise he would “deny
himself.” (<span id="ii.i-p82.2"></span>[2Ti
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#013)<span id="ii.i-p82.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.i-p83"></span>*He hath filled Zion with judgment and
righteousness.* Thus he again confirms the statement, that it will be a
proof of God’s wonderful kindness, when the Jews shall be delivered from
the tyranny of the Babylonians. It was proper to place before their eyes
the Author of so great a blessing; for we see how basely his glory is
obscured by our ingratitude. Now, “the fullness of righteousness and
judgment” means, that God will largely and copiously pour forth his
kindness in restoring the Church. Yet it will not be unsuitable to view
these words as referring to lawful order, when everything is justly and
properly administered; for without this the Church will never enjoy
prosperity, though everything else may succeed according to the wish.
Holy and welladjusted order, therefore, and not corruptible riches, is
the standard by which our prosperity should be judged.

<span id="ii.i-p84"></span><span id="ii.i-p84.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p85"></span>**6.** *And the stability of thy times shall
be.* He promises that the state of the kingdom under the reign of
Hezekiah will yet be happy and prosperous, especially when he contrasts
it with the wretched, destructive, and ruinous aspect which it exhibited
under the reign of Ahaz; for, although the enemy had been driven out,
hardly any one would have expected that the Jews, who had been so
heavily oppressed, would be restored to their former order. As to the
words, some translate them, “Truth, and strength, and salvation shall be
in thy times;” as if the Prophet described the prosperity which the
nation should enjoy under a pious king; and they think that each of
those terms denotes so many of God’s benefits. Others think that <span
id="ii.i-p85.1"></span>אמונת *(emunath)* denotes “fidelity,” as if the
Prophet said that it would be “salvation and strength.” Others draw from
it a somewhat different sense, that “strength, salvation, and knowledge”
will be “stable” under the reign of Hezekiah. But when I examine closely
the words of the Prophet, I choose rather to make a different
distinction, that “stability, strength, and salvation will be
established by wisdom, and knowledge,” during the reign of Hezekiah.

<span id="ii.i-p86"></span>*The fear of Jehovah is his treasure.* When
he says that “the fear of God is the treasure” of a pious king, this
accords with the explanation which we have now given; for during peace
all men wish to lead a safe and easy life; but few care how they shall
enjoy such distinguished benefits. Indeed the greater part of men would
desire to fatten like a herd of swine; and thus while all are eagerly
directed by blind lust to seek outward benefits, the light of heavenly
doctrine, which is an invaluable blessing, is almost set at nought. He
therefore means that the prosperity of the Church will be “stable,”
 <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) when “wisdom and knowledge” shall
reign in it; that its “strength” will be lasting, when the “knowledge”
of God shall prevail; and that its salvation will be eternal, when men
shall be well instructed in the knowledge of God.

<span id="ii.i-p88"></span>This is a very remarkable passage; and it
teaches us that our ingratitude shuts the door against God’s blessings,
when we disregard the Author of them, and sink into gross and earfifty
desires; and that all the benefits which we can desire or imagine, even
though we actually obtained them, would be of no avail for our
salvation, if they were not seasoned with the salt of faith and
knowledge. Hence it follows that the Church is not in a healthy
condition unless when all its privileges have been preceded by the light
of the knowledge of God, and that it flourishes only when all the gifts
which God has bestowed upon it are ascribed to Him as their author. But
when the knowledge of God has been taken away, and when just views of
God have been extinguished or buried, any kind of prosperity is worse
than all calamities.

<span id="ii.i-p89"></span>For these reasons I consider *stability,
strength,* and *salvations,* to denote the same thing, that the
condition of the Church will be secure, when men shall have been cured
of blindness and ignorance, and shall begin to know God. And hence we
see what kind of Church the Papists have, distinguished, indeed, by pomp
and splendor, but they want this “knowledge,” and, therefore, it cannot
be stable or secure, and is not a Church of God. If, therefore, the Lord
shall grant to us this blessing, that the brightness of faith shall
actually shine in the midst of us, other blessings will follow of their
own accord, and if we are shaken and tossed about by various tempests,
we shall always be supported by the arm of God.

<span id="ii.i-p90"></span>*Of thy times.* He addresses Hezekiah, not as
a private individual, but as the head of the whole people; and he
includes the whole people in this description. But since the kingdom of
Hezekiah was but a slender shadow of the kingdom of Christ, as we
formerly remarked, these words must be referred to Christ, in whom is
found true wisdom and knowledge. (<span id="ii.i-p90.1"></span>[Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003)<span id="ii.i-p90.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.i-p91"></span>It is proper to observe the designations
which are here employed in order to commend the word of God and the
gospel. They are likewise employed by Paul, when he speaks of “teaching
in all wisdom and knowledge;” for by this commendation he extols the
dignity of the gospel. (<span id="ii.i-p91.1"></span>[Col.
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#009.md),
[28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028)<span id="ii.i-p91.1"></span>..md)
Hence also it ought to be inferred that, where Christ is not known, men
are destitute of true wisdom, even though they have received the highest
education in every branch of learning; for all their knowledge is
useless till they truly “know God.” (<span id="ii.i-p91.2"></span>[Joh
17:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#003)<span id="ii.i-p91.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.i-p92"></span>*The fear of Jehovah is his treasure.*  <span
id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) I think that the expression, “the fear of
Jehovah,” was added by the Prophet for the sake of explanation, in order
to state more fully that the knowledge of which he spoke is the teacher
of piety, and is not cold or lifeless, but penetrates powerfully into
our heart, to form us to “the fear of God.” Hence also, in other
passages of Scripture, this “fear” is called “wisdom,” or rather “the
beginning of wisdom,” that is, the substance and chief part of it.
(<span id="ii.i-p93.1"></span>[Pr
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro001.htm#007.md)<span id="ii.i-p93.1"></span>, and
9:10.) It is a mistake to suppose that the word “beginning” denotes
rudiments or elements, for Solomoil means by it the chief part and
design; and the reason is, that, as men are fools till they submit to
the word of God, so the perfection of wisdom springs from the docility
or obedience of faith. “The fear of God” is therefore called a
“treasure,” without which all prosperity is miserable; and this shews
more fully the scope of the passage, that the full perfection of a happy
life consists in the knowledge of God, which we obtain by faith.

<span id="ii.i-p94"></span>Thus, in the person of the king he shews that
it is an invaluable blessing to worship God with due piety and
reverence. They who are destitute of “the fear of God” are pronounced by
him to be miserable and ruined; and, on the other hand, they who “fear
the Lord” are declared to be very happy, even though in other respects
they be reckoned in the judgment of men to be very miserable. He speaks
of that “fear” which contains within itself true obedience, and renews
our hearts; for it is a different kind of fear which influences even
wicked men, and leads them to dread God as criminals dread a judge. That
“fear” does not deserve to be so highly applauded; for it springs
neither from a true knowledge of God, nor from a cheerful desire to
worship him, and therefore differs widely from that wisdom which Isaiah
describes. These statements were made by him in reference to Hezekiah,
but, as we have already said, they related to the whole body of the
people; and hence we infer that they apply both to men of ordinary rank
and to the king, but more especially to Christ, who was filled with “the
Spirit of the fear of the Lord,” as we formerly saw,  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) (<span id="ii.i-p95.2"></span>[Isa
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#002)<span id="ii.i-p95.2"></span>,.md)
that he might make us partakers of it.

<span id="ii.i-p96"></span><span id="ii.i-p96.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p97"></span>**7.** *Behold, their messengers*  <span
id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) *shall cry without.* It is difficult to
determine whether Isaiah relates historically the fearful perplexity and
imminent danger to which the Jews were reduced, in order to exhibit more
strikingly the favor of deliverance, or predicted *a* future calamity,
that the hearts of the godly might not soon afterwards faint under it.
For my own part, I think it probable that this is not the history of, a
past transaction, but that, as a heavy and sore temptation was at hand,
it was intended to fortify the hearts of believers to wait patiently for
the assistance of God when their affairs were at the worst. However that
may be, the sad and lamentable desolation of the Church is here
described, that believers may not cease to entertain good hope even in
the midst of their perplexity, and that, when they have been rescued
from danger; they may know that it was accomplished by the wonderful
power of God.

<span id="ii.i-p99"></span>*The ambassadors of peace wept bitterly.* It
is given as a token of despair, that the ambassadors who had been sent
to appease the tyrant were unsuccessful; for every way and method of
obtaining peace was attempted by Hezekiah, but without any success.
Accordingly, “the ambassadors” returned sad and disconsolate, and even
on the road could not dissemble their grief, which it was difficult to
conceal in their hearts, when matters were in so wretched a condition.
He undoubtedly means that Sennacherib has haughtily and disdainfully
refused to make peace, so that “the ambassadors,” as; if they had
forgotten their rank, are constrained to pour out in public their grief
and lamentations, and, ere they have returned to their king and given
account of their embassy, openly to proclaim what kind of answer they
have obtained from the cruel tyrant,  <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md)
Others think, that by “the ambassadors of peace” are meant those who
were wont to announce peace; but that interpretation appears to me to be
feeble and farfetched. By “the ambassadors of peace,” therefore, I
understand to be meant those who had been sent to pacify the king, that
they might purchase peace on some condition.

<span id="ii.i-p101"></span><span id="ii.i-p101.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p102"></span>**8.** *The roads are deserted.* He now
adds, that “the roads” will be shut up, so that no one shall go in or
out; which commonly happens when war has been declared. The Prophet
appears to represent the ambassadors as declaring that henceforth there
will be no opportunity of carrying on merchandise, and even that the
highways will not be safe.  <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) It is
immediately added, —

<span id="ii.i-p104"></span>*They have violated the treaty.* These words
are viewed by some commentators as a complaint made by hypocrites that
God does not fulfill his promises. If it were thought proper to view
them as referring to God, still it would not be necessary to say that
such a complaint proceeds from none but wicked men; for sometimes
believers also quarrel with God in this manner. But I cannot approve of
that interpretation; and, therefore, consider this to be a part of the
description which the Prophet gives of the cruelty and insatiable rage
of Sennacherib, in treacherously breaking the treaty which he had
formerly made with Hezekiah; for, although he had promised that he would
maintain peace, yet as soon as an opportunity presented itself for
invading Judea, he violated his promise and made preparations for war.
Such is also the import of the conclusion of the verse, that *he hath
despised the cities, he hath regarded no man,* which means that his
cruelty will be so great that he will not be restrained by shame or
fear.

<span id="ii.i-p105"></span><span id="ii.i-p105.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p106"></span>**9.** *The earth hath mourned and
languished.* Here he describes more fully how wretched and desperate the
Jews would perceive their condition to be, that their confidence might
nevertheless come forth out of a deep gulf. The places are also
specified by him, *Lebanon, Bashan,* and *Carmel,* which are widely
distant from each other, and which form almost the farthest boundaries
of the holy land, in order to shew that no part of it; will remain safe
or uninjured. He describes this calamity in such a manner as to assign
to each place what peculiarly belongs to it. To “Lebanon” he assigns
confusion, because it is elsewhere mentioned as beautiful and glorious,
in consequence of having been covered with lofty and valuable trees. He
declares that “Sharon,” which was a level and fertile district, will be
“like a wilderness,” and that “Bashan and Carmel,” which abounded in
“fruits,” will be “shaken.” Thus he alludes to the natural character of
each place, and describes the misery and distress in such a manner as to
magnify and illustrate the kindness of God, by whom they would be
delivered, even though they appeared to be utterly ruined; for here we
may see the hand of God openly displayed, if it be not thought
preferable to view the Prophet as relating a past transaction in order
to excite them to thankfulness.

<span id="ii.i-p107"></span><span id="ii.i-p107.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p108"></span>**10.** *Now will I rise.* There is great
force in the particle *now,* and likewise in the repetition which is
added, “I shall be exalted, I shall be lifted up on high.” We ought to
observe the time to which these statements relate, that is, when the
Church appeared to be utterly ruined; for God declares that he will
judge that to be the most suitable time for rendering assistance. This
is, therefore, a comparison of things which are contrary to each other;
for he exhibits to believers the heavy and grievous calamities by which
they should be oppressed, and under which they would easily sink, if
they were not upheld by some consolation. As if he had said, “The Lord
will suffer you to be brought very low, but when your affairs shall be
at the worst, and when you shall have in vain tried every remedy, the
Lord will arise and succor you.” Thus even when we are afflicted and
brought very low, we ought to acknowledge that our safety cometh from
God alone.

<span id="ii.i-p109"></span>Accordingly, the word *now* denotes a period
of the deepest distress. Men might think it exceedingly strange, but we
plainly see the best reason why God thus delays to render assistance. It
is, because it is useful to exercise the patience of the godly, to try
their faith, to subdue the desires of the flesh, to excite to
earnestness in prayer, and to strengthen the hope of a future life; and,
therefore, he lays a restraint, that they may not with headlong
eagerness anticipate that period which God has already marked out for
them. The repetition is very emphatic, and is added for the purpose of
confirming the statement; for when our affairs are desperate, we think
that we are ruined, but at that very time we ought especially to hope,
because the Lord generally selects it for giving a display of his power.
For this reason, by extolling his loftiness, he arouses believers to the
exercise of courage, that they may boldly defy the insolence of their
enemies.  <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md)

<span id="ii.i-p111"></span><span id="ii.i-p111.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p112"></span>**11.** Ye *shall conceive chaff.* He now
addresses his discourse to the enemies of the Church, whose insolence,
he says, is foolish and to no purpose; for when God shall have
brilliantly displayed his power, they shall know that their efforts will
be fruitless, and that they will accomplish nothing, even though they be
leagued together in vast crowds. The Lord laughs at their madness, in
thinking that everything is in their power, when he can instantly, by
the slightest expression of his will, restrain and destroy them, though
they may be defended by a very powerful army.

<span id="ii.i-p113"></span>It is customary in the Scriptures to employ
the word *conceptions* for denoting the designs and efforts of men.
(<span id="ii.i-p113.2"></span>[Job
15:35](../../../bib/kjv/job015.htm#035.md), [Ps.
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#014.md), [Isa.
26:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#017.md), [Isa.
59:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#004)<span id="ii.i-p113.2"></span>..md)
The metaphor is taken from pregnant women. Men are said to “conceive”
and to “bring forth,” when they attempt anything; but he declares that
their “conception” shall be fruitless, and that they shall also “bring
forth” to no purpose, for whatever they undertake shall be unsuccessful.
There is nothing, therefore, in the brilliant military forces of our
adversaries that ought to alarm us; for, although God may permit them
for a time to bustle, and toil, and rage, yet God will at length turn
into *“chaff”* all their rash and daring attempts. Let us learn that
what Isaiah foretold about Sennacherib relates to all the adversaries of
believers and of the Church.

<span id="ii.i-p114"></span>*The fire of your breath shall devour you.*
That they “shall be devoured by the fire of their breath” is usually
explained to mean, “Your breath, like fire, shall devour you.” But that
is an unsuitable and even absurd comparison, and the true meaning
readily suggests itself, “The fire kindled by your breath shall devour
you.” We commonly kindle a fire by blowing, and therefore he declares,
that the fire which wicked men have blown by their wicked contrivances
shall be destructive to them, because it shall consume them. It is the
same statement which is often conveyed by a variety of metaphors in
Scripture.

<span id="ii.i-p115"></span>“They shall fall into the pit which they
have digged. They are entangled in a net which they had prepared for
others. The sword which they had drawn hath entered into their own
bowels. Their arrow hath been turned back to pierce their own hearts.”
(<span id="ii.i-p115.1"></span>[Ps.
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#015.md), [Ps.
37:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#015.md), [Ps.
57:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa057.htm#006)<span id="ii.i-p115.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.i-p116"></span>Thus the Prophet shews that the wicked
tyrant who laid waste Judea and besieged Jerusalem with a numerous army,
and all others who in like manner are adversaries of the Church, bring
down destruction on themselves, and will at length be destroyed; and, in
short, that they will be consumed by that “fire” which they have
kindled.

<span id="ii.i-p117"></span><span id="ii.i-p117.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p118"></span>**12.** *And the peoples shall be the
burnings of lime.* He compares them to “the burning of lime,” because
their hardness shall be bruised, as fire softens the stones, so that
they shall easily be reduced to powder; and, undoubtedly, the more
powerfully wicked men are inflamed with a desire to commit injury, the
more do they bruise themselves by their own insolence.

<span id="ii.i-p119"></span>*As thorns cut up.*  <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) This metaphor is not less appropriate;
for although they hinder men from touching them by the painful wounds
which they inflict on the hands, yet there is no kind of wood that burns
more violently or is more quickly consumed. Something of the same kind,
we have said, may be observed in “lime,” which at first is hard, but is
softened by the fire. The Prophet declares that the same thing will
happen to the Babylonians, whom the Lord will easily destroy, though at
first they appear to be formidable, and though it may be supposed to be
unlikely that they shall be consumed by any conflagration. Whenever,
therefore, we behold the enemies of the Church collecting all sorts of
wealth and forces, and military preparations, in order to destroy us and
set on fire the whole world, let us know that they are kindling a fire
which shall miserably destroy them.

<span id="ii.i-p121"></span>We know that this was fulfilled in
Sennacherib, for the event proved the truth of these predictions, though
they appeared to be altogether incredible. Let us hope that the same
thing shall happen to all others who shall imitate the actions of this
tyrant, and let us comfort ourselves by that example, and innumerable
others, amidst our distresses and afflictions, which shall be followed
by certain deliverance and dreadful vengeance on our enemies.

<span id="ii.i-p122"></span><span id="ii.i-p122.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p123"></span>**13.** *Near, ye that are far off.* Isaiah
here makes a preface, as if he were about to speak on a very weighty
subject; for he bids his hearers be attentive, which is commonly done
when any important and remarkable subject is handled. He addresses both
*those who are near,* who would be eyewitnesses of this event, and the
most distant nations to whom the report would be communicated; as if he
had said that the power of God will be such as to be perceived not only
by a few persons, or by those who are at hand, but also by those who
shall be at a very great distance. Thus he means that it will be a
striking and extraordinary demonstration of the power of God, because
wicked men, who formerly were careless and unconcerned, as if they had
been free from all danger of distress or annoyance, shall be shaken with
terror.

<span id="ii.i-p124"></span><span id="ii.i-p124.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p125"></span>**14.** *The sinners in Zion are afraid.*
But some one might object that the subject here treated is not so
important as to need that lofty preface intended to arouse the whole
world. Was it a matter of so great importance that wicked men were
struck with fear? But by an attentive examination it will be found that
it is no ordinary exhibition of divine power, when wicked men are
aroused from their indolence, so that, whether they will or not, they
perceive that God is their judge, especially when contempt of God is
accompanied by hypocrisy, For although it is difficult to arouse
irreligious men, when a veil is spread over their hearts,  <span
id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) yet still greater is the obstinacy of
hypocrites, who imagine that God is under obligations to them. Thus we
see that men are so bewitched by madness, that they despise all
threatenings and terrors, and mock at the judgments of God, and, in
short, by witty jesting, set aside all prophecies, so that it ought to
be regarded as a miracle that men who make such resistance are
overthrown. Hence Isaiah, with good reason, kindles into rage against
them;for, when he employs the word *Zion,* he undoubtedly reproves the
degenerate Jews, because, when they were covered with the shadow of the
sanctuary, they thought that they were in possession of a fortress which
could not be stormed; and undoubtedly, as I remarked a little before,
the haughtiest and proudest of all men are they who shelter themselves
under the name of God, and glory in the title of the Church.

<span id="ii.i-p127"></span>*Terror hath seized the wicked,* <span
id="ii.i-p127.1"></span>הנפים *(chanephim)* is translated *hypocrites,*
but still more frequently it may be viewed as denoting *“treacherous*
revolters and men utterly worthless.” Since, therefore, they were so
wicked, and mocked at God and the prophets, he three, tens that God will
be a judge so sharp and severe, that they shall no longer find pleasure
in their impostures. Next is added a conression which wears the aspect
of humility, in order to shew more clearly that hypocrites, who do not
willingly obey God, at length find that experience is their instructor
how dreadful is the judgment of God. As soon, therefore, as their
“laughing” is turned into “gnashing of teeth,” they begin to acknowledge
that their whole strength is chaff or stubble. (<span
id="ii.i-p127.2"></span>[Lu 6:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.i-p127.2"></span>; <span id="ii.i-p127.3"></span>[Mt
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#012)<span id="ii.i-p127.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.i-p128"></span>*Which of us shall dwell with the devouring
fire?* As to the meaning of the words, some translate them, “Who shall
dwell *instead of us?”* Others, “Which *of us* shall dwell?” If we view
them simply as meaning “to us,” or “for us,” the meaning may be thus
explained, “Who shall encounter the fire, or place himself between, so
that the flame may not reach us?” There are also other interpretations
which amount to the same thing; but commentators differ in this respect,
that some view the words as relating to the king of Assyria, and others
as relating to God. I prefer the latter opinion, as has been already
shewn; for although the king of Assyria might be regarded as a “fire”
that would burn up the earth with his heat, yet the Prophet intended to
express something far more dreadful, namely, the inward anguish by which
ungodly men are tormented*,* the stings of conscience which cannot be
allayed, the unquenchable burning of crimes which exceeds every kind of
torments; for whatever is the course pursued by ungodly men, such will
they find the dispensations of God to be towards them.

<span id="ii.i-p129"></span>On their account, therefore, God is called
*a devouring fire,* as we may learn from Moses, (<span
id="ii.i-p129.1"></span>[Deut. 4:24](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#024.md),
[Deut. 9:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu009.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.i-p129.1"></span>,) from whom the prophets, as we have frequently
remarked, borrow their doctrines, and who is also followed by the
Apostle. (<span id="ii.i-p129.2"></span>[Heb
12:29](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#029)<span id="ii.i-p129.2"></span>..md)
This exposition is confirmed by the Prophet himself, who shews what was
the cause of that terror. It might be objected that God was excessively
severe, and that he terrified them beyond measure; but he is usually
kind and gentle to the godly, while wicked men feel that he is severe
and terrible. Some think that the Prophet intended to convince all men
of their guilt, in order that they might abandon all confidence, in
their works, and in a lowly and humble manner betake themselves to the
grace of God, as if he had said, “None but he who is perfectly righteous
can stand before the judgmentseat of God, and therefore all are
accursed.”

<span id="ii.i-p130"></span>But he rather speaks in the name, and
agreeably to the feelings, of those who formerly scorned all
threatenings; and he now represents those very persons as inquiring with
trembling dismay, “Who shall dare to go into the presence of God?*”*
This mournful complaint is a manifestation of that terror which hath
lately seized them, when, being convinced of their frailty, they cry out
in sorrow, “Who shall endure the presence of God?” But since they still
murmur against God, though he compels them reluctantly to utter these
words, the Prophet, on the other hand, in order to restrain their wicked
barkings, replies that God is not naturally the object of terror or
alarm to men, but that it arises through their own fault, because
conscience, which God does not suffer to lie idle, terrifies them with
their crimes.

<span id="ii.i-p131"></span><span id="ii.i-p131.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p132"></span>**15.** *He that walketh in righeousness.*
Now, therefore, he explains more fully what we briefly remarked a little
before, that they who provoke his anger, and thus drive away from them
his forbearance, have no right to complain that God is excessively
severe. Thus he convinces them of their guilt and exhorts them to
repentance, for he shews that there is a state of friendship between God
and men, if they wish to follow and practice “righteousness,” if they
maintain truth and integrity, if they are free from all corruptions and
act inoffensively towards their neighbors; but because they abound in
every kind of wickedness, and have abandoned themselves to malice,
calumny, covetousness, robbery, and other crimes, it is impossible that
the Lord should not strike them down with fear, by shewing that he is
terrible to them. In short, the design of the Prophet is to shut the
mouths of wicked babblers, that they may not accuse God of cruelty in
their destruction; for the whole blame rests on themselves. By evasions
they endeavor to escape condemnation. But the Prophet declares that God
is always gracious to his worshippers, and that in this sense Moses
calls him “a fire,” (<span id="ii.i-p132.1"></span>[Deut.

that men may not despise his majesty and power; but that every one who
shall approach to him with sincere piety will know by actual experience
that nothing is more pleasant or delightful than his presence. Since,
therefore, God shines on believers with a bright countenance, they enjoy
settled peace with him through a good conscience; and hence it follows
that God is not naturally terrible, but that he is forced to it by our
wickedness.

<span id="ii.i-p133"></span>This discourse is directed chiefly against
hypocrites, who throw a false veil of piety over their hidden pollutions
and crimes, and make an improper use of the name of God, that they may
indulge more freely in wickedness. By the examples which he adduces in
illustration of “righteousness,” the Prophet more openly reproves their
crimes. He enumerates the principal actions of life by means of which we
shew what sort of persons we are. Here, as in many other passages, he
treats of the second table of the Law, by which the sincerity of
godliness is put to the test; for, as gold is tried in the fire, so the
dispositions which we cherish towards God are ascertained from the
habitual course of our life, when our sincerity comes to be seen by the
duties which we owe to each other.

<span id="ii.i-p134"></span>The word *walketh* is the wellknown metaphor
of a road, which is frequently employed in Scripture for describing the
manner of life or habitual conduct. By righteousness he means not the
entire keeping of the Law, but that equity which is included in the
second table; for we must not; imagine that subtle disquisitions about
“righteousness” are here intended.

<span id="ii.i-p135"></span>*Who speaketh what is right.* He now
enumerates the chief parts of that uprightness which ought to be
maintained; and as the tongue is the chief instrument by which a man
regulates his actions, he places it in the second rank after
“righteousness.” He who restrains it from slander and evilspeaking, from
deceit, perjury, and falsehood, so as not to injure his brother in any
matter, is said to “speak what is right.” Next is added another
department,

<span id="ii.i-p136"></span>*Who despiseth the gain arising from
violence and calumny.* He might have said in a single word, “who
despiseth money;*”* but he employed more homely language, and
accommodated himself to the ignorance of men. He who is desirous of
riches, and does not refrain from robbery or from base and unlawful
means of making gain, harasses and oppresses the poor and feeble, and
cares for nothing else than to lay hold on money in every direction, and
by every method either right or wrong. He next proceeds farther, and
describes corruptions of every sort.

<span id="ii.i-p137"></span>*Who shaketh his hands from accepting a
bribe.* Under the name of *bribes,* by which judges are corrupted, he
likewise includes everything else. There is nothing by which the
dispositions of men and righteous judgment are so much perverted; and
therefore he bids them “shake their hands,” so as to intimate in what
abhorrence they should be held, and with what care they should be
avoided by all, lest, if they only handled or were tainted by barely
touching them, they should be drawn aside kern what is just and right;
for “bribes” have wonderful powers of fascination, so that it is very
difficult for judges to keep their hands altogether clean and
uncorrupted by them. What, then, can we think of those who always have
their hands stretched out and ready to receive, and crooked nails ready
to catch; and not only so, but, like harlots, openly hire themselves out
for gain? Need we wonder if God thunders against them with unrelenting
vengeance?

<span id="ii.i-p138"></span>*Who stoppeth his ear that it way not hear
blood.* At length he demands that the manifestation of uprightness shall
be made in the *ears.* By *blood* he means murder and manslaughter, but
he likewise includes wicked conspiracies of every kind, that the “ears”
may not be open to hear them, so.as to give our consent.. He does not
mean that our “ears” should be shut against the cries of the poor, when
they suffer injuries and oppression; but he means that we should detest
wicked devices by which unprincipled men contrive the ruin of the
innocent, that we may not even lend our “ears” to their discourses, or
allow ourselves to be solicited in any way to do what is evil.

<span id="ii.i-p139"></span>*Who shutteth his eyes.* At length he
demands the same holiness in the “eyes.” In short, he teaches that we
ought to restrain all our senses, that we may not give to wicked men any
token of our approbation, if we wish to escape the wrath of God and that
terrible burning of which he formerly spake.

<span id="ii.i-p140"></span><span id="ii.i-p140.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p141"></span>**16.** *He shall dwell in high places.*
That the Jews may know that the chastisements which God had inflicted on
them were righteous, and may endeavor to be restored to his favor, he
says that his blessing is ready to be bestowed on good and upright men,
such as he described in the former verse, and that they are not subject
to any danger, and have no reason to dread that burning which he
mentioned, because they shall be made to dwell in a place of the
greatest safety. As to wicked men, slanderers, robbers, and deceitful
persons, on the other hand, who cannot restrain their tongue, and hands,
and ears, and eyes from base and wicked actions, the Prophet shews that
we need not wonder if God treat them with severity, and that, while God
is their judge, their own conscience is at the same time their
executioner; and consequently, that the only means of hindering them
from dreading the presence of God, is to keep themselves voluntarily in
the fear of God. By “high places,” he means a very safe place, and free
from all danger, which ns attack of the enemy can reach, as he declares
plainly enough immediately afterwards by assigning to them a habitation
among “fortified rocks.”

<span id="ii.i-p142"></span>*Bread shall be given to him.* To a safe
dwelling he adds an abundance of good things; as if he had said that the
holy and upright worshippers of God shall lack nothing, because God will
not only protect them so as to *keep* them safe from all danger, but
will also supply them abundantly with all that is necessary for the
support of life. By the words “bread” and “water” he means all the daily
necessaries of life.

<span id="ii.i-p143"></span>*And his waters shall be sure.* Though
wicked men have abundance for a time, they shall afterwards be hungry;
as God threatens in the Law, that they shall have famine and hunger.
(<span id="ii.i-p143.1"></span>[Le
26:19](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#019.md)<span id="ii.i-p143.1"></span>;
<span id="ii.i-p143.2"></span>[Deut.
28:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023.md),
[48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#048)<span id="ii.i-p143.2"></span>..md)
The same remark may be made with regard to “bread,” for the word “sure”
relates to both; as if he had said, that all believers shall have their
food made “sure.” “Lions are hungry, and wander about; but they that
fear God shall not want any good thing,” (<span
id="ii.i-p143.3"></span>[Ps 34:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.i-p143.3"></span>;) because God, who is by nature bountiful, is
not wearied by bestowing liberally, and does not exhaust his wealth by
acts of kindness.

<span id="ii.i-p144"></span>Besides, as the life of men is exposed to
various dangers, and as abundance of meat and drink is not all that is
necessary for our support, unless the Lord defend us by his power, we
ought, therefore, to observe carefully what he formerly mentioned, that
believers are placed in a safe abode. The Lord performs the office of a
shepherd, and not only supplies them with food, but also defends them
from the attacks of robbers, enemies, and wolves; and, in short, keeps
them under his protection and guardianship, so as not to allow any evil
to befall them. Whenever, therefore, it happens, that enemies annoy us,
let us consider that we are justly punished for our sins, and that we
are deprived of God’s assistance because we do not deserve it; for we
must reckon our sins to be the cause of all the evils which we endure.

<span id="ii.i-p145"></span>Yet let not those who are conscious of their
integrity imagine that God has forsaken them, but let them to the latest
day of their life rely on those promises in which the Lord assures his
people that he will be a very safe refuge to them. No man, indeed, can
be so holy or upright as to be capable of enduring the eye of God; for
“if the Lord mark our iniquities,” as David says, “who shall endure?”
(<span id="ii.i-p145.1"></span>[Ps
130:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa130.htm#003)<span id="ii.i-p145.1"></span>..md)
We therefore need a mediator, through whose intercession our sins may be
forgiven; and the Prophet did not intend to set aside the ordinary
doctrine of Scripture on this subject, but to strike with terror wicked
men, who are continually stung and pursued by an evil conscience,  <span
id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) This ought to be carefully observed in
opposition to the Popish doctors, by whom passages of this kind, which
recommend works, are abused in order to destroy the righteousness of
faith; as if the atonement for our sins, which we obtain through the
sacrifice of Christ, ought to be set aside.

<span id="ii.i-p147"></span><span id="ii.i-p147.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p148"></span>**17.** *The king in his beauty.* Although
the Prophet changes the person, yet this verse must be connected with
the preceding verse; for he addresses the sincere worshippers of God, to
whom he promises this additional blessing, *Thou shalt see the king in
his beauty* This promise was highly necessary for supporting the hearts
of believers, when the state of affairs in Judea was so lamentable and
so desperate. When Jerusalem was besieged, the king shut up within the
city and surrounded by treacherous counsellors, the people unsteady and
seditious, and everything hastening to ruin, there appeared to be no
hope left. Still the royal authority in the family of David was a
remarkable pledge of the love of God. Isaiah, therefore, meets this
danger by saying, that though they behold their king covered with filthy
garments, yet he shall be restored to his former rank and splendor.

<span id="ii.i-p149"></span>First, it ought to be observed how
invaluable is the kindness of God, when the commonwealth is at peace,
and enjoys good princes, by whom everthing is administered justly and
faithfully; for by their agency God rules over us. Since, therefore,
this happiness is not inconsiderable, the Prophet was unwilling to leave
out this part, in promising prosperity to the worshippers of God. Yet
it, ought also to be observed, that that kingdom was a type of the
kingdom of Christ, whose image Hezekiah bore; for there would be a
slight fulfillment of this promise, if we did not trace it to Christ, to
whom all these things must be understood to refer. Let no man imagine
that I am here pursuing allegories, to which I am averse, and that this
is the reason why I do not interpret the passage as relating directly to
Christ; but, because in Christ alone is found the stability of that
frail kingdom, the likeness which Hezekiah bore leads us to Christ, as
it were, by the hand. I am, therefore, disposed to view Hezekiah as a
figure of Christ, that we may learn how great will be his beauty. In a
word, Isaiah here promises the restoration of the Church.

<span id="ii.i-p150"></span>*The land very far off.* The restoration of
the Church consists of two parts; first, that “the king shall be seen in
his beauty;” and secondly, that the boundaries of the kingdom shall be
extended. We know that the appearance of Christ is so disfigured as to
be contemptible in the eyes of the world, because “no beauty or
loveliness” (<span id="ii.i-p150.1"></span>[Isa
53:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#002)<span id="ii.i-p150.1"></span>.md) is
seen in him; but at length, his majesty and splendor and beauty shall be
openly displayed, his kingdom shall flourish and be extended far and.
wide. Although at present wicked men have everything in their power, and
oppress the true servants of God, so that they scarcely have a spot on
which they can plant their foot in safety, yet. with firm hope we ought
to look for our King, who will at length sit down on his bright and
magnificent throne, and will gloriously enrich his people.

<span id="ii.i-p151"></span><span id="ii.i-p151.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p152"></span>**18.** *Thy heart shall meditate terror.*
Believers are again informed what calamities are at hand, lest, by being
suddenly overtaken with such heavy afflictions, they should sink under
them. <span id="ii.i-p152.1"></span>יהגה *(yehgeh)* is translated by
some in the preterite, “meditated,” and by others in the future, “shall
meditate;” because such an exchange of tenses is customary in the Hebrew
language. For my own part, believing that he warns the people of
approaching distresses, instead of relating those which had been
formerly endured, I willingly retain the future tense, which is also the
tense employed by the Prophet, “shall meditate.”

<span id="ii.i-p153"></span>*Where is the scribe?* He relates in a
dramatic and lively manner (<span id="ii.i-p153.1"></span>μιμητικῶς) the
speeches of those who, overcome by terror, break out into these
exclamations: *Where is the scribe? Where is the weigher?* thus
expressing the powerful impression made on their minds. If any one
suppose that the line of thought is suddenly broken off, because the
Prophet, having in the former verse spoken of “the kings beauty,” now
brings forward terrors, I have no doubt that he magnifies the kindness
of God by means of comparison, in order that believers, when they have
been delivered, may set a higher value on the condition to which they
have attained. Men are forgetful and niggardly in judging of God’s
favors, and, after having been once set free, do not consider what was
the depth of their misery. Such persons need to be reminded of those
wretched and disastrous times, during which they endured great
sufferings, in order that they may more fully appreciate the greatness
of the favor which God has bestowed on them. We ought also to observe
another reason why it was advantageous that the people should be
forewarned of that terror. It was that, after having heard of the kings
magnificence, they might not promise themselves exemption from all
uneasiness, but might be prepared to undergo any kind of troubles and
distresses, and that, even while they were subject to tribute and placed
under siege, they might, know that the kingdom of Judah was the object
of God’s care, and would be rescued from the hands of tyrants.

<span id="ii.i-p154"></span>It is a very wretched condition which the
Prophet describes, that a free people should be oppressed by such cruel
tyranny as to have all their property valued, and an inventory taken of
their houses, possessions, families, and servants. How grievous this
slavery is, many persons formerly unaccustomed to it actually know by
experience in our times, when their property is valued to the very last
farthing, and a valuation is made not only of their undoubted incomes
but also of their expected gains, and not only their money and
possessions, but even their names are placed on record, while new
methods of taxation are contrived, not only on food but on the smallest
articles, so that tyrants seize on a large portion of those things which
are indispensably necessary to the wretched populace; and yet those
calamities do not restrain men from insolence, licentiousness, and
rebellion. What then will happen when they shall be free and at full
liberty? Will they not, forgetful of all their distresses, and unmindful
of God’s kindness, abandon themselves more freely than before to every
kind of indulgence and licentiousness? It is not without good reason,
therefore, that the Prophet places before the eyes of the people that
wretched condition, that they may not, when delivered from it, giveway
to their unlawful passions, but may acknowledge their deliverer and may
love him with all their heart.

<span id="ii.i-p155"></span>Some have falsely imagined that Paul (<span
id="ii.i-p155.1"></span>[1Co 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.i-p155.1"></span>) quotes this passage; for that would spoil the
Prophet’s meaning and torture his words to a different purpose. They
have been led into a mistake by the mere use of the word “scribe,” which
there denotes a Teacher. Isaiah gives the name of “the scribe” to the
person who took account of persons, families, lands, and houses, and, in
short, who kept the registers of the taxes. By “the weigher,” he means
the person who received the taxes, for he “weighed” the money which was
paid. That office is discharged in the present day by those who are
called treasurers.

<span id="ii.i-p156"></span>*Where is he who singles out the principal
houses?* He now.adds a very troublesome and exceedingly disliked class
of men, “the describers of the towers,” that is, of the more remarkable
buildings; for they visit and examine each person’s house, in order to
know who are more wealthy than others, that they may demand a larger sum
of money. Such men,like huntinghounds, are commonly employed by tyrants
to scent the track of money, for the sake of laying on some unusual
impost in addition to the ordinary taxes. The arrival of such persons
must have been exceedingly annoying to the people, for they never cease
till they have sucked all the blood and marrow. If any one prefer to
view this term as denoting the servants of the king himself, whose
business it was to destroy the houses adjoining to the walls of the
city, let him enjoy his opinion. For my own part, I think it probable
that the Prophet speaks of the receivers of taxes, whom conquerors
appoint over vanquished nations for the sake of maintaining their
authority.

<span id="ii.i-p157"></span><span id="ii.i-p157.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p158"></span>**19.** *Thou shaft not see a fierce
people.* The word <span id="ii.i-p158.1"></span>נועז *(nognaz)* is
translated by some “strong,” and by others “impudent;” but, undoubtedly,
he intends to express the fierceness of the Assyrians, which he
afterwards affirms by saying that they would have no intercourse with
them, because they spoke a different language. Nothing is more fitted to
excite men to compassion than the intercourse of speech, by which men
explain their distresses to each other. When this is wanting, there can
be no means of gaining their hearts; each party is a barbarian to the
other; and nothing more can be obtained from them than if one were
dealing with wild and savage beasts. The Prophet, therefore, dwells
largely on the wretched condition of the people, in order to shew, on
the other hand, how great was the kindness of God in delivering them
from so great terror. In like manner, the Holy Spirit magnifies the
grace of God, in preserving his people in Egypt, though

<span id="ii.i-p159"></span>“they did not understand the language of
that nation.”  
(<span id="ii.i-p159.2"></span>[Psalm
131:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa131.htm#005)<span id="ii.i-p159.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.i-p160"></span><span id="ii.i-p160.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p161"></span>**20.** *Behold Zion.* Some read it in the
vocative case, “Behold, O Zion;” but it is preferable to read it in the
accusative case. He brings forward a promise of the restoration of the
Church, which ought to have great weight with all godly persons; for
when the Church shakes or falls, there can be no hope of prosperity.
That the Church will be restored he shews in such a manner that he
places it before our eyes as having actually taken place, though he
speaks of what is future; and his object is to give greater energy to
his style, as if he had said, “Again you will see Zion restored and
Jerusalem flourishing.” Although believers see everything destroyed and
scattered, and although they despair of her safety, yet in Jerusalem
there shall be a quiet and safe habitation.

<span id="ii.i-p162"></span>*The city of our solemnities,* or *of our
assemblies.* By this designation he shews that we ought to judge of the
restoration of Zion chiefly on this ground, that the people “assembled”
there to hear the Law, to confirm the covenant of the Lord, to call upon
his name, and to offer sacrifices. When the people were deprived of
these things, they were scattered and nearly lost, and appeared to be
separated from their head and utterly abandoned. Accordingly, nothing
was so deeply lamented by godly persons, when they were held in
captivity at Babylon, as to be banished from their native country and at
the same time deprived of those advantages; and that this was the chief
complaint of all believers is very manifest from many passages. (<span
id="ii.i-p162.1"></span>[Ps 137:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.i-p162.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.i-p163"></span>“Zion” is called by him “a city,” because it
formed the middle of the city, and was also called “the city of David.”
(<span id="ii.i-p163.1"></span>[Isa
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#009)<span id="ii.i-p163.1"></span>..md)
The extent of Jerusalem was different and larger; for, as we mentioned
in the explanation of another passage,  <span
id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) there was a double wall, which is
customary in many cities. Here it ought to be observed that the
restoration of the Church is the most valuable of all blessings, and
ought above all things to be desired; that everything else, even though
it should be most abundant, is of no avail, if this single blessing be,
wanting; and, on the other hand, that we cannot be unhappy, so long as
Jerusalem, that is, the Church, shall flourish. Now, it is restored and
flourishes, when God presides in our assemblies, and when we are
assembled in his name and thus cleave to him. Wicked men indeed shelter
themselves under the name of God, as if they were assembled at his
command; but it is an empty mask, for in their heart they are very far
from him, and attempt nothing in obedience to his authority.

<span id="ii.i-p165"></span>*Jerusalem a peaceful habitation.* He says
that believers, who had long been agitated amidst numerous alarms, will
have a safe and “peaceful habitation” in the Church of God. Although God
gave to his people some taste of that peace under the reign of Hezekiah,
yet it was only in Christ that the fulfillment of it was manifested. Not
that since that time the children of God have had a quiet habitation in
the world; even in the present day this peacefulness is concealed; for
we lead an exceedingly wandering and uncertain life, are tossed about by
various storms and tempests, are attacked by innumerable enemies, and
must engage in various battles, so that there is scarcely a single
moment that we are at rest. The peace which is promised, therefore, is
not that which can be perceived by our bodily senses, but we must come
to the inward feelings of the heart, which have been renewed by the
Spirit of God, so that we enjoy that peace which no human understanding
is able to comprehend; for, as Paul says, “it goes beyond all our
senses.” (<span id="ii.i-p165.1"></span>[Php
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#007)<span id="ii.i-p165.1"></span>..md)
The Lord will undoubtedly bestow it upon us, if we dwell in the Church.

<span id="ii.i-p166"></span>*A tent which shall not be carried away, the
stakes of which shall never be removed.* By these metaphors of “a
tabernacle” and of “stakes,” he describes accurately the condition of
the Church. He might have called it a well-founded city, but he says
that it is “a tabernacle,” which, by its very nature, is such that it
can be speedily removed to a different place, in order that, though we
may consider the condition of the Church to be uncertain and liable to
many changes, yet we may know that it cannot be moved or shaken; for it
will remain in spite of storms and tempests, in spite of all the attacks
of enemies, and in opposition to what appears to be its nature, and to
the views of our understanding. These two statements appear to be
inconsistent with each other, and faith alone reconciles them, by
maintaining that it is safer to dwell in this “tabernacle” than in the
best defended fortresses.

<span id="ii.i-p167"></span>We ought to employ this as a shield against
temptations,which otherwise would speedily destroy our faith, whenever
we perceive the Church to be not only shaken, but violently driven about
in all possible directions. Who would say that amidst that violent storm
the “tabernacle” was safe? But since God does not wish his people to be
wholly fixed on the earth, that they may depend more on himself alone,
the protection which he promises to us ought to be reckoned better than
a hundred, better than a thousand supports.

<span id="ii.i-p168"></span><span id="ii.i-p168.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p169"></span>**21.** *Because there the mighty Jehovah
will be to us.* The two particles <span id="ii.i-p169.1"></span>כי ים
(ki im) often serve the place of a double affirmative, but here a reason
is assigned, and they might even be appropriately rendered, *For if;*
but I willingly retain what is more clear. The Prophet assigns the
reason why the Church, which appears to resemble a movable “tent,”
exceeds in stability the best founded cities. It is because “the Lord is
in the midst of her,” as it is also said, (<span
id="ii.i-p169.2"></span>[Ps 46:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.i-p169.2"></span>,) and “therefore she shall not be moved.” If we
separate the Church from God;. it will immediately fall without any
attack; for it will consist of men only, than whom nothing can be more
weak or frail.

<span id="ii.i-p170"></span>*Will be to us a place of rivers.* When God
dwells with us, he confirms and supports what was naturally feeble, and
supplies to us the place of a very strong fortress, a very broad ditch,
and walls and “rivers” surrounding the city on every side. He alludes to
the situation of the city Jerusalem, which had only a small rivulet, and
not large and rapid rivers, like those of Babylon and other cities; for
in another passage (<span id="ii.i-p170.1"></span>[Isa
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#006)<span id="ii.i-p170.1"></span>.md) he
enjoined them to rest satisfied with the power of God alone, and not to
covet those broad rivers. As if he had said, “Our strength shall be
invincible, if God rule over us; for under his guidance and direction we
shall be abundantly fortified.”

<span id="ii.i-p171"></span>*There shall not pass a ship with oars.*
Large rivers are attended by this inconvenience, that they may give
access to enemies, so as to enable them to approach with their ships
nearer than is desirable; and thus, very frequently, what appeared to be
of service is found to be injurious. But while the Lord says that he
will be “a river,” he says also that there will be no reason to dread
such an inconvenience, and that enemies will not be allowed to approach,
he mentions two kinds of ships, long ships, and ships of burden, in
order to shew that enemies will be shut out in every possible way. Hence
we ought to draw a very useful doctrine, that the hope of safety should
not be sought from any other than from God alone, and that it is in vain
to collect various means of defense, which will be useless, and even
hurtful, if He be not on our side.

<span id="ii.i-p172"></span><span id="ii.i-p172.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p173"></span>**22.** *For Jehovah is our judge.* The
Prophet now explains the manner in which God dwells in the Church. It
is, that he is there worshipped and acknowledged as *Judge, Lawgiver,*
and *King;* for they who obey God and yield subjection to him as their
King, shall know by experience that he is the guardian of their
salvation; but they who falsely glory in his name, vainly hope that he
will assist them. Let us only yield to his authority, hear his voice,
and obey him; and, on the other hand, he will shew that he is our
protector and most faithful guardian. But when we despise his voice and
disobey his word, we undoubtedly have no reason to wonder that he
abandons and forsakes us in dangers.

<span id="ii.i-p174"></span>Hence, also, we ought to observe what is the
true Church of God. It is that which acknowledges God to be a “Lawgiver”
and “King.” With what effrontery, therefore, do the Papists dare to
boast that they are the Church of God, seeing that they reject that
lawful government of it which was enjoined by Moses, and the Prophets,
and Christ, and substitute in the room of it inventions and base
traffic? They exert a cruel tyranny over consciences, and, by taking
away all the liberty which Christ has bestowed on us, they wretchedly
harass souls and lead them to perdition; but God alone has the right to
rule the conscience, because he alone is “Lawgiver” and “Judge,” and he
alone ought to rule and guide us by his word. He combines here the three
words, “Judge,” “Lawgiver” and King,” because the subject is of very
great importance, and ought not to be lightly set aside. If, therefore,
we permit ourselves to be guided by his word, he will never fail us; and
this is the only way of obtaining salvation.

<span id="ii.i-p176"></span>**23.** *Thy cords were loosed.* He directs
his discourse to the Assyrians, in whose person he likewise addresses
all the enemies of the Church. After having promised to the Church such
stability as shall never be disturbed, he rebukes the foolish confidence
with which ungodly men are puffed up; as if they had been so deeply
rooted as to reach the center of the earth. Although, during the
intoxicating influence of prosperity, they imagine that their wealth is
exceedingly secure, he foretells that ruin will quickly overtake them,
because they are not supported by the hand of God.

<span id="ii.i-p177"></span>He follows out the comparison which he had
employed at the commencement. Having said that the Church resembles a
place that is fortified and surrounded by very broad rivers which do not
admit the approach of enemies, he now compares the condition of wicked
men to ships; by which he means that they have no solid foundation,
though they appear to be formidable, and though they are madly eager and
fiercely cruel, and imagine that none can resist their rage. Although,
therefore, they have long ships and ships of burden, by which they may
be said to form a union between countries placed at great distances from
each other, and to make themselves masters of sea and land, still they
shall have no permanency or stability. The Lord will sink their ships,
will take away their ropes and masts, and will involve them in a
universal shipwreck. Let us not therefore be terrified by their fury and
insolence, but let us look for the day of the Lord, when he shall make
their rage and violence to fall on their own heads.

<span id="ii.i-p178"></span><span id="ii.i-p178.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p179"></span>**24.** *And the inhabitant shall not say, I
am sick.* The Prophet again returns to the Church; for the destruction
which he threatened against the Assyrians tended also to the consolation
of the godly, since the safety of the Church could not be maintained
unless the Lord granted his protection against so many adversaries who
attack and molest her on every hand. Accordingly, having briefly
remarked that all the reprobate who annoy the children of God shall be
defeated, he appropriately follows out his subject by affirming that God
will leave nothing undone that could promote the salvation of the godly.
He says, therefore, that the citizens of the Church shall be freed from
every inconvenience, because through the favor of God they shall enjoy
prosperity.

<span id="ii.i-p180"></span>*The people that dwell in it have been freed
from iniquity.* This latter clause of the verse explains the former; for
it shews that there is nothing to prevent the blessings of God from
being largely enjoyed by us, when our sins have been pardoned. Hence,
also, we conclude, that all the miseries which press upon us spring from
no other source than from our sins. On any other ground the reason which
he assigns might appear to be, farfetched and inappropriate; but we must
hold this principle, that all the evils which God inflicts upon us are
so many tokens of his anger. Hence it follows that, when guilt has been
removed, nothing remains but that God will regard us with the affection
of a father, and will graciously bestow upon us all that we need. If,
therefore, we desire to be delivered from afflictions, we ought to
observe this order, to seek first to be reconciled to God; for the
removal of the cause would be speedily followed by the removal of the
effect.

<span id="ii.i-p181"></span>But seeing that our desires, are
illregulated, and that, in consequence of being anxious merely to avoid
punishments, we shut our eyes against the root of our distresses, we
need not wonder that we obtain no alleviation of them. Those persons,
therefore, are mistaken who indulge in their vices, and yet wish to be
exempted from every kind of afflictions. If they do not suffer and
adversity, still they will not cease to be miserable, and cannot enjoy
peace of mind so long as they are pursued by the consciousness of their
crimes. Consequently, true happiness consists in this, that we have
obtained pardon from God, and sincerely believe that all the blessings
which we receive from his hand are the results of his fatherly kindness.

<span id="ii.i-p182"></span>Let us also learn that there is no other way
in which we can please God, or obtain the honor of being accounted his
children, than when he ceases to impute to us our sins; and therefore it
is only the reconciliation which we obtain by free grace that pacifies
God toward us, and opens up the way to the enjoyment of his goodness.
That there is no visible evidence of that exemption from afflictions
does not lessen the truth of the promise, because believers are
abundantly satisfied with this comfort in their afflictions, that even
when they are chastened by the hand of God, still they are his beloved
children. So far as they have been renewed by his Spirit, they begin to
taste the blessing which was in full perfection before the fall of Adam;
but because they are burdened with many sins, they constantly need to be
cleansed. Still, however, through compassion on their weakness, God
mitigates their punishment, and, if not by removing altogether, yet by
abating and soothing their grief, shews that he promotes their
happiness; and therefore it is not without good reason that the Prophet
declares the Church to be exempted from ordinary calamities, so far as
they proceed from the curse of God.

<span id="ii.i-p183"></span>Hence, also, we see clearly how childish is
the distinction of the Papists, that the removal of guilt is of no
avail; as if we had to satisfy the judgment of God. But far otherwise do
the prophets teach, as may be easily learned from various passages; and
if there had been nothing more than this single passage, can anything be
plainer than that sicknesses come to an end, because iniquity has been
pardoned? The meaning is undoubtedly the same as if he had said, that
punishment ceases because sin has been pardoned. True, indeed, though
God has been pacified towards them,  <span
id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) he sometimes inflicts punishment on
believers; and the object is, that by fatherly chastisement he may
instruct them more fully for the future, and not that he may take
vengeance on them, as if he had been. but half reconciled. But Papists
think that their punishments are of the nature of satisfactions, and
that by paying them the sinner in some measure redeems himself, and puts
away his guilt; which is absolutely inconsistent with a free pardon.
Thus their abominable inventions, both about satisfactions, and about
the fire of purgatory, fall to the ground.

<span id="ii.i-p185"></span>It is also worthy of observation, that none
but the citizens of the Church enjoy this privilege; for, apart from the
body of Christ and the fellowship of the godly, there can be no hope of
reconciliation with God. Hence, in the Creed we profess to believe in
“The Catholic Church and the forgiveness of sins;” for God does not
include among the objects of his love any but those whom he reckons
among \[he members of his onlybegotten Son, and, in like manuel’, does
not extend to any who do not belong to his body the free imputation of
righteousness. Hence it follows, that strangers who separate themselves
from the Church have nothing left for them but to rot amidst their
curse. Hence, also, a departure from the Church is an open renouncement
of eternal salvation.
