<span id="ix-p1"></span>CHAPTER 40

<span id="ix.i"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p1"></span><span id="ix.i-p1.1"></span>[Isaiah
40:1-31](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p2"></span>**1.** Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith
your God.

<span id="ix.i-p3"></span>**1.** Consolamini, consolamini populum meum,
dicit Deus rester.

<span id="ix.i-p4"></span>**2.** Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and
cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is
pardoned: for she hath received of the LORD’S hand double for all her
sins.

<span id="ix.i-p5"></span>**2.** Loquimini secundum cor Ierusalem, et
clamate ad eam, quod impleta sit militia ejus, quod remissa sit
iniquitas *(vel, miseria)* ejus, quoniam accepit e manu Iehovae duplicia
in onmibus peccatis suis.

<span id="ix.i-p6"></span>**3.** The voice of him that crieth in the
wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert
a highway for our God.

<span id="ix.i-p7"></span>**3.** Vox clamans in deserto: Parate viam
Iehovae; Dirigite in solitudine semitam Deo nostro.

<span id="ix.i-p8"></span>**4.** Every valley shall be exalted, and
every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made
straight, and the rough places plain:

<span id="ix.i-p9"></span>**4.** Omnis vailis exaltabitur, et onmis mons
et collis humiliabitur; et erit praeruptum in rectitudinem, et loca
confragosa in planiciem.

<span id="ix.i-p10"></span>**5.** And the glory of the LORD shall be
revealed, and all flesh shall see *it* together: for the mouth of the
LORD hath spoken *it.*

<span id="ix.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et revelabitur gloria Iehovae,
videbitque omnis caro pariter, quod os Iehovae loquutum sit.

<span id="ix.i-p12"></span>**6.** The voice said, Cry. And he said, What
shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof *is* as
the flower of the field:

<span id="ix.i-p13"></span>**6.** Vox dixit *(vel, dicebat):* Clama. Et
dixi, Quid clamabo? Omnis caro herba, et omnis gratia ejus quasi flos
eampi.

<span id="ix.i-p14"></span>**7.** The grass withereth, the flower
fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the
people *is* grass.

<span id="ix.i-p15"></span>**7.** Exaruit herba, emarcuit flos, quia
spiritus Iehovae sufflavit in co. Sane herba est populus.

<span id="ix.i-p16"></span>**8.** The grass withereth, the flower
fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever.

<span id="ix.i-p17"></span>**8.** Arescit herba, emarcet flos. At sermo
Dei nostri stabit in aeternum.

<span id="ix.i-p18"></span>**9.** O Zion, that bringest good tidings,
get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good
tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift *it* up, be not afraid;
say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!

<span id="ix.i-p19"></span>**9.** Ascende in montem excelsum,
annuntiatrix Sion; attolle fortiter vocem tuam, annuntiatrix Ierusalem.
Attolle, ne timeas. Die civitatibus Iuda: Ecce Deus rester.

<span id="ix.i-p20"></span>**10.** Behold, the Lord GOD will come with
strong *hand,* and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward *is*
with him, and his work before him.

<span id="ix.i-p21"></span>**10.** Ecce Dominus Iehova in robore veniet;
et brachium ejus sibi potens. Ecce merces ejus cure co, et opus ejus
coram ipsius facie.

<span id="ix.i-p22"></span>**11.** He shall feed his flock like a
shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry *them* in
his bosom, *and* shall gently lead those that are with young.

<span id="ix.i-p23"></span>**11.** Sicuti pastor gregem suam pascet,
brachio suo colliget agnos, sinu suo portabit, foetus suaviter ducet.

<span id="ix.i-p24"></span>**12.** Who hath measured the waters in the
hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended
the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
and the hills in a balance?

<span id="ix.i-p25"></span>**12.** Quis mensus est pugillo suo aquas, et
coelos palma mensus est, et comprehendit tribus digitis pulverem terrae,
et appendit montes in statera, et colles in trutina?

<span id="ix.i-p26"></span>**13.** Who hath directed the Spirit of the
LORD, or, *being* his counsellor, hath taught him?

<span id="ix.i-p27"></span>**13.** Quis erudivit Spiritum Iehovae, aut
consilio eum instruxit, et eum docuit?

<span id="ix.i-p28"></span>**14.** With whom took he counsel, and *who*
instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him
knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?

<span id="ix.i-p29"></span>**14.** A quo petlit consilium, ut eum
moneret? et docuit eum semitam judicii, erudivit scientia, et viam
prudentiae ostendit ei?

<span id="ix.i-p30"></span>**15.** Behold, the nations *are* as a drop
of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold,
he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.

<span id="ix.i-p31"></span>**15.** En gentes quasi gutta situlae, et
quasi pulvisculus trutinae reputantur; en insulas quasi rein minimam
tollit.

<span id="ix.i-p32"></span>**16.** And Lebanon *is* not sufficient to
burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.

<span id="ix.i-p33"></span>**16.** Nec Libanus sufficeret ad incendium,
nec bestiae ejus ad holocaustum.

<span id="ix.i-p34"></span>**17.** All nations before him *are* as
nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.

<span id="ix.i-p35"></span>**17.** Omnes gentes quasi nihilum sunt
corameo, et praeipso reputantur minus quam nihil, et quod non est.

<span id="ix.i-p36"></span>**18.** To whom then will ye liken God? or
what likeness will ye compare unto him?

<span id="ix.i-p37"></span>**18.** Cui igitur similem fecistis Deum, aut
quam similitudinem ordinabitis ei?

<span id="ix.i-p38"></span>**19.** The workman melteth a graven image,
and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver
chains.

<span id="ix.i-p39"></span>**19.** Artifex parat sculptlie, aurifaber
aurum aptat illi, et catenas argenteas (conflat) aurifaber.

<span id="ix.i-p40"></span>**20.** He that *is* so impoverished that he
hath no oblation chooseth a tree *that* will not rot; he seeketh unto
him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, *that* shall not be
moved.

<span id="ix.i-p41"></span>**20.** Pauper oblationi eligit lignum quod
non putrescat; artificem peritum quaerit sibi qui sculptlie praeparet,
ne moveatur.

<span id="ix.i-p42"></span>**21.** Have ye not known? have ye not heard?
hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood
from the foundations of the earth?

<span id="ix.i-p43"></span>**21.** An nescitis? An non audistis? An non
vobis annuntiatum est ab initio? An non edocti estis a fundamentis
terrae?

<span id="ix.i-p44"></span>**22.** *It is* he that sitteth upon the
circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof *are* as grasshoppers;
that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as
a tent to dwell in:

<span id="ix.i-p45"></span>**22.** Is sedet super gyrum terrae, cujus
habitatores sunt vehti locustae, extendit coelum ut cortinam; expandit,
inquam, quasi tentorium, ut inhabitetur.

<span id="ix.i-p46"></span>**23.** That bringeth the princes to nothing;
he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.

<span id="ix.i-p47"></span>**23.** Redigit potentes in nihilum,
gubernatores terrae quasi non slut.

<span id="ix.i-p48"></span>**24.** Yea, they shall not be planted; yea,
they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the
earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the
whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.

<span id="ix.i-p49"></span>**24.** Perinde ut non plantati, perinde ut
non sati, perinde acsi non radix in terra stirps eorum. Etiam dum
sufflat in eos arescunt, et turbo quasi stipulam aufert eos.

<span id="ix.i-p50"></span>**25.** To whom then will ye liken me, or
shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.

<span id="ix.i-p51"></span>**25.** Et cut assimilabitis me, ut similis
sim? dicit Sanctus.

<span id="ix.i-p52"></span>**26.** Lift up your eyes on high, and behold
who hath created these *things,* that bringeth out their host by number:
he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that *he
is* strong in power; not one faileth.

<span id="ix.i-p53"></span>**26.** Tollite in sublime oculos vestros, et
aspicite quis creaverit ea producens ad numerum exercitum eorum; omnibus
nominatim acclamabit; a magnitudine virium et robore fortitudinis nullum
deficiet *(vel, deerit).*

<span id="ix.i-p54"></span>**27.** Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and
speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is
passed over from my God?

<span id="ix.i-p55"></span>**27.** Quare dices, Iacob, et loqueris
Israel? Abscondita est via mea ab Iehova, eta Deo meo judicium meum
transit.

<span id="ix.i-p56"></span>**28.** Hast thou not known, hast thou not
heard, *that* the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of
the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? *there is* no searching of
his understanding.

<span id="ix.i-p57"></span>**28.** An non scivisti? An non audiisti
(quod) Deus seculi sit Iehova, qui fines terrae creavit? Non laborat,
nec lassitudine fatigatur; et non est investigatio intelligentiae ejus.

<span id="ix.i-p58"></span>**29.** He giveth power to the faint; and to
*them that have* no might he increaseth strength.

<span id="ix.i-p59"></span>**29.** Dot lasso virtutem, et cui nihil est
virium robur suppeditat.

<span id="ix.i-p60"></span>**30.** Even the youths shall faint and be
weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:

<span id="ix.i-p61"></span>**30.** Fatigantur adolescentes et lassantur;
juvenes cadendo cadunt.

<span id="ix.i-p62"></span>**31.** But they that wait upon the LORD
shall renew *their* strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles;
they shall run, and not be weary; *and* they shall walk, and not faint.

<span id="ix.i-p63"></span>**31.** At expectantes Iehovam vires novas
colligent; sustollent alas ut aquibe; current, nec fatigabuntur;
ambulabunt, nec deficient.

<span id="ix.i-p64"></span> 

<span id="ix.i-p65"></span><span id="ix.i-p65.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p66"></span>**1.** *Comfort ye.* The Prophet introduces a
new subject; for, leaving the people on whom no favorable impression was
made either by threatenings or by admonitions, on account of their
desperate wickedness, he turns to posterity, in order to declare that
the people who shall be humbled under the cross will experience no want
of consolation even amidst the severest distresses. And it is probable
that he wrote this prophecy when the time of the captivity was at hand,
that he might not at his departure from life leave the Church of God
overwhehned by very grievous calamities, without the hope of
restoration. Though he formerly mingled his predictions with
threatenings and terrors for this purpose, yet he appears to have
contemplated chiefly the benefit of those who lived at that time. What
will afterwards follow will relate to the future Church, the revival of
which was effected long after his death; for he will next lay down a
perpetual doctrine, which must not be limited to a single period, and
especially when he treats of the commencement and progress of the reign
of Christ. And this prophecy must be of so much the greater importance
to us, because it addresses us in direct terms; for, although it may be
a spiritual application of what goes before, so as to be doctrine that
is common both to the Jews and to us, yet, as he leaves the Jews of that
age, and addresses posterity down to the end of the world, it appears to
belong more especially to us.

<span id="ix.i-p67"></span>By this exhortation, therefore, the Lord
intended to stir up the hearts of the godly, that they might not faint,
amidst heavy calamities. First, he addresses the Jews, who were soon
after to be carried into that hard captivity in which they should have
neither sacrifices nor prophets, and would have been destitute of all
consolation, had not the Lord relieved their miseries by these
predictions. Next, he addresses all the godly that should live
afterwards, or that shall yet live, to encourage their heart, even when
they shall appear to be reduced very low and to be utterly ruined.

<span id="ix.i-p68"></span>That this discourse might have greater
weight, and might mere powerfully affect their minds, he represents God
as raising up new prophets, whom he enjoins to soothe the sorrows of the
people by friendly consolation. The general meaning is, that, when he
shall have appeared to have forsaken for a time the wretched captives,
the testimony of his grace will again burst forth from the darkness, and
that, when gladdening prophecies shall have ceased, their proper time
will come round. In order to exhibit more strongly the ground of joy, he
makes use of the plural number, *Comfort ye;* by which he intimates that
he will send not one or another, but a vast multitude of prophets; and
this he actually accomplished, by which we see more clearly his infinite
goodness and mercy.

<span id="ix.i-p69"></span>*Will say.* First, it ought to be observed
that the verb is in the future tense; and those commentators who render
it in the present or past tense both change the words and spoil the
meaning. Indircetly he points out an intermediate period, during which
the people would be heavily afflicted, as if God had been silent.  <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) Though even at that time God did not
cease to hold out the hope of salvation by some prophets, yet, having
for a long period cast them off, when they were wretchedly distressed
and almost ruined, the consolation was less abundant, till it was
pointed out, as it were with the finger, that they were at liberty to
return. On this account the word *comfort* must be viewed as relating to
a present favor; and the repetition of the word not only confirms the
certainty of the prediction, but applauds its power and success, as if
he had said, that in this message there will be abundant, full, and
unceasing cause of joy.

<span id="ix.i-p71"></span>Above all, we must hold by the future tense
of this verb, because there is an implied contrast between that
melancholy silence of which I have spoken, and the doctrine of
consolation which afterwards followed. And with this prediction agrees
the complaint of the Church,

<span id="ix.i-p72"></span>“We do not see our signs; there is no longer
among us a prophet or any one that knows how long.” (<span
id="ix.i-p72.1"></span>[Ps 74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009.md)<span
id="ix.i-p72.1"></span>.)

<span id="ix.i-p73"></span>We see how she laments that she has been
deprived of the best kind of comfort, because no promise is brought
forward for soothing her distresses. It is as if the Prophet bad said,
“The Lord will not suffer you to be deprived of prophets, to comfort you
amidst your severest distresses. At that time he will raise up men by
whom he will send to you the message that had been long desired, and at
that time also he will show that he takes care of you.”

<span id="ix.i-p74"></span>I consider the future tense, *will say,* as
relating not only to the captivity in Babylon, but to the whole period
of deliverance, which includes the reign of Christ.  <span
id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) To the verb *will say,* we must supply
“to the prophets,” whom he will appoint for that purpose; for in vain
would they have spoken, if the Lord had not told them, and even put into
their mouth what they should make known to others. Thus there is a
mutual relation between God and the prophets,” whom he will appoint for
that purpose; for in vain would they have spoken, if the Lord had not
told them and even put into their mouth what they should make known to
others. Thus there is a mutual relation between God and the prophets. In
a word, the Lord promises that the hope of salvation will be left,
although the ingratitude of men deserves that this voice shall be
perpetually silenced and altogether extinguished.

<span id="ix.i-p76"></span>These words, I have said, ought not to be
limited to the captivity in Babylon; for they have a very extensive
meaning, and include the doctrine of the gospel, in which chiefly lies
the power of “comforting.” To the gospel it belongs to comfort those who
are distressed and cast down, to quicken those who are slain and
actually dead, to cheer the mourners, and, in short, to bring all joy
and gladness; and this is also the reason why it is called “the Gospel,”
that is, good news,  <span id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) Nor did it
begin at the time when Christ appeared in the world, but long before,
since the time when God’s favor was clearly revealed, and Daniel might
be said to have first raised his banner, that believers might hold
themselves in readiness for returning. (<span id="ix.i-p77.2"></span>[Da
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002)<span id="ix.i-p77.2"></span>..md)
Afterwards, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, Nehemiah, Ezra, and others, down
to the coming of Christ, exhorted believers to cherish better and better
hopes. Malachi, the last of them that wrote, knowing that there would be
few prophets, sends the people to the law of Moses, to learn from it the
will of God and its threatenings and promises. (<span
id="ix.i-p77.3"></span>[Mal 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/mal004.htm#004.md)<span
id="ix.i-p77.3"></span>.)

<span id="ix.i-p78"></span>*Your God.* From this passage we learn what
we ought chiefly to seek in the prophets, namely, to encourage the hopes
of godly persons by exhibiting the sweetness of divine grace, that they
may not faint under the weight of afflictions, but may boldly persevere
in calling on God. But since it was difficult to be believed, he reminds
them of the covenant; as if he had said that it was impossible for God
ever to forget what he formerly promised to Abraham. (<span
id="ix.i-p78.1"></span>[Ge 17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007.md)<span
id="ix.i-p78.1"></span>.) Although, therefore, the Jews by their sins
had fallen from grace, yet he affirms that he is *their God,* and that
they are his peculiar people, both of which depended on election; but,
as even in that nation there were many reprobates, the statement implies
that to believers only is this discourse strictly directed; because he
silently permits unbelievers, through constant languishment, to be
utterly wasted and destroyed. But to believers there is held out an
invaluable comfort, that, although for a time they are oppressed by
grief and mourning, yet because they hope in God, who is the Father of
consolation, they shall know by experience that the promises of grace,
like a hidden treasure, are laid up for them, to cheer their hearts at
the proper time. This is also a very high commendation of the prophetic
office, that it supports believers in adversity, that they may not faint
or be discouraged; and, on the other hand, this passage shews that it is
a very terrible display of God’s vengeance when there are no faithful
teachers, from whose mouth may be heard in the Church of God the
consolation that is fitted to raise up those who are cast down, and to
strengthen the feeble.

<span id="ix.i-p79"></span><span id="ix.i-p79.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p80"></span>**2.** *Speak ye according to the heart of
Jerusalem.* Here God commands his servants the prophets, and lays down
the message which he wishes them to deliver publicly, when believers
shall be called to change their strain from mourning to joy. And yet he
does not exhort and encourage them to the cheerful and courageous
discharge of their office, so much as he conveys to the minds of
believers an assured hope that they may patiently endure the irksomeness
of delay, till the prophets appear with this glad and delightful
message. To *speak to the heart*  <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) is nothing else than “to speak
according to the wish or sentiment of the mind;” for our heart abhors or
recoils if any sad intelligence is communicated, but eagerly receives,
or rather runs to meet, whatever is agreeable. Now, in consequence of
the people having been apparently rejected, nothing could be more
agreeable than a reconciliation  <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md)
which should blot out all offenses. By a figure of speech in which a
part is taken for the whole, *Jerusalem,* as is well known, denotes the
Church.

<span id="ix.i-p83"></span>*And cry to her.* The word *cry* means that
the promise of this grace will be open and manifest, so as to resound in
the ears of all and be understood; for if prophets only muttered or
spoke indistinctly, the belief of this consolation would be doubtful or
weak, but now that they publish it boldly and with open mouth, all
doubts are removed.

<span id="ix.i-p84"></span>*That her warfare is accomplished.* This is
the desirable message, that the Lord determines to put an end to the
warfare of his people. I consider <span id="ix.i-p84.1"></span>כי *(ki)*
to be used for introducing an explanation. Some think that <span
id="ix.i-p84.2"></span>צבאה, *(tzebaahh,)* which we have translated “her
warfare,” simply denotes “time,” as if it had been said, “her time is
accomplished.”  <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) Others think
that it expresses the time of visitation, but this is incorrect; for
among the Hebrews it literally denotes a time previously appointed and
set apart for lawful work or labor. (<span id="ix.i-p85.2"></span>[Nu
4:23](../../../bib/kjv/num004.htm#023)<span id="ix.i-p85.2"></span>..md)
But here unquestionably the metaphor is taken from the discharge of
soldiers; for it means that the end and issue of their vexations is at
hand, and that God does not wish to harass his people continually, but
to set a limit to their afflictions. He therefore compares the time of
the captivity in Babylon to a righteous warfare, at the end of which the
soldiers, having obtained an honorable discharge, will return home to
enjoy peace and quietness.

<span id="ix.i-p86"></span>*That her iniquity is pardoned.* This means
that God is so gracious to them that he is unwilling to treat them with
the utmost severity. These words, therefore, assign a reason; for, as
physicians, in curing diseases, first remove the causes from which
diseases arise, so does the Lord deal with us. The scourges by which he
chastises us proceed from our sins; and therefore, that he may cease to
strike, he must first pardon us; and consequently, he says that there
will be an end of punishments, because he no longer imputes sin. Others
think that <span id="ix.i-p86.2"></span>עונה *(gnavonahh)* means “her
misery,” and that it denotes that her misery is ended. This meaning also
is highly appropriate, and thus the Prophet will make the same
announcement in two ways; for to finish her warfare, and to put an end
to her miseries, mean the same thing. Yet we must hold this principle,
that God ceases from inflicting punishment when he is appeased, so that
pardon and the forgiveness of sins always come first in order, as the
cause. But the word <span id="ix.i-p86.3"></span>נרצה *(nirtzah)*
demands, in my opinion, the former meaning; as if he had said, that God
has been appeased in such a manner that, having pardoned and forgiven
their sins, he is ready to enter again into a state of favor with his
people.

<span id="ix.i-p87"></span>*Double for all her sins.* This passage is
explained in two ways. Some say that the people, having deserved a
double punishment, have obtained a double favor; and others, that they
have received enough of punishment, because God is unwilling to exact
more. The former interpretation, though it contains an excellent and
profitable doctrine, does not agree with the text, and must therefore be
set aside; and it is evident that the Prophet means nothing else than
that God is abundantly satisfied with the miseries which have befallen
his Church. I could have wished, therefore, that they who have attacked
Jerome and other supporters of this interpretation, had been more
moderate; for the natural meaning belongs to this interpretation, and
not to the more ingenious one, that the Lord repays double favor for
their sins. The general meaning is, that God is unwilling to inflict
more severe or more lengthened punishment on his people, because,
through his fatherly kindness, he is in some sense displeased with the
severity.

<span id="ix.i-p88"></span>Here the word *double* denotes “large and
abundant.” It must not be imagined that the punishments were greater
than the offenses, or equal to them; for we ought to abhor the blasphemy
of those who accuse God of cruelty, as if he inflicted on men
excessively severe punishment; for what punishment could be inflicted
that was sufficiently severe even for the smallest offense? This must
therefore relate to the mercy of God, who, by setting a limit to the
chastisements, testifies that he is unwilling to punish them any more or
longer, as if he were abundantly satisfied with what had gone before,
though that nation deserved far severer chastisements. God sustains the
character of a Father who, while he compassionates his children, is led,
not without reluctance, to exercise severity, and thus willingly bends
his mind to grant forgiveness.

<span id="ix.i-p89"></span><span id="ix.i-p89.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p90"></span>**3.** *A voice crying in the wilderness.* He
follows out the subject which he had begun, and declares more explicitly
that he will send to the people, though apparently ruined, ministers of
consolation. At the same time he anticipates an objection which might
have been brought forward. “You do indeed promise consolation, but where
are the prophets? For we shall be ‘in a wilderness,’ and whence shall
this consolation come to us?” He therefore testifies that “the
wilderness” shall not hinder them from enjoying that consolation.

<span id="ix.i-p91"></span>*The wilderness* is employed to denote
metaphorically that desolation which then existed; though I do not deny
that the Prophet alludes to the intermediate journey;  <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) for the roughness of the wilderness
seemed to forbid their return. He promises, therefore, that although
every road were shut up, and not a chink were open, the Lord will easily
cleave a path through the most impassable tracts for himself and his
people.

<span id="ix.i-p93"></span>*Prepare the way of Jehovah.* Some connect
the words “in the wilderness” with this clause, and explain it thus,
“Prepare the way of Jehovah in the wilderness.” But the Prophet appears
rather to represent a voice which shall gather together those who had
wandered and had, as it were, been banished from the habitable globe.
“Though you behold nothing but a frightful desert, yet this voice of
consolation shall be heard from the mouth of the prophets.” These words
relate to the hard bondage which they should undergo in Babylon.

<span id="ix.i-p94"></span>But to whom is that voice addressed? Is it to
believers? No, but to Cyrus, to the Persians, and to the Medes, who held
that people in captivity. Having been alienated from obedience to God,
they are constrained to deliver the people; and therefore they are
enjoined to “prepare and pave the way,” that the people of God may be
brought back to Judea; as if he had said:, “Make passable what was
impassable.” The power and efficacy of this prediction is thus held up
for our applause; for when God invests his servants with authority to
command men who were cruel and addicted to plunder, and who at that time
were the conquerors of Babylon, to “prepare the way” for the return of
his people, he means that nothing shall hinder the fulfillment of his
promise, because he will employ them all as hired servants. Hence we
obtain an excellent consolation, when we see that God makes use of
irreligious men for our salvation, and employs all the creatures, when
the case demands it, for that end.

<span id="ix.i-p95"></span>*A highway for our God.* When it, is said
that the way shall be prepared not for the Jews, but for God himself, we
have here a remarkable proof of his love towards us; for he applies to
himself what related to the salvation of his chosen people. The Lord had
nothing to do with walking, and had no need of a road; but he shews that
we are so closely united to him that what is done on our account he
reckons to be done to himself. This mode of expression is frequently
employed elsewhere, as when it is said that God “went forth into battle
with his anointed,” (<span id="ix.i-p95.1"></span>[Hab
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/hab003.htm#013)<span id="ix.i-p95.1"></span>,.md)
and that “he rode through the midst of Egypt,” (<span
id="ix.i-p95.2"></span>[Ex 11:4](../../../bib/kjv/exo011.htm#004.md)<span
id="ix.i-p95.2"></span>,) and that he lifted up his standard and led his
people through the wilderness. (<span id="ix.i-p95.3"></span>[Isa
63:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#013)<span id="ix.i-p95.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.i-p96"></span>This passage is quoted by the Evangelists,
(<span id="ix.i-p96.1"></span>[Mt
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#003.md)<span id="ix.i-p96.1"></span>;
<span id="ix.i-p96.2"></span>[Mr
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#003.md)<span id="ix.i-p96.2"></span>;
<span id="ix.i-p96.3"></span>[Lu
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#004)<span id="ix.i-p96.3"></span>,.md) and
applied to John the Baptist, as if these things had been foretold
concerning him, and not unjustly; for he held the highest rank among the
messengers and heralds of our redemption, of which the deliverance from
Babylon was only a type. And, indeed, at the time when the Church arose
out of her wretched and miserable condition, her mean appearance bore a
stronger resemblance than the Babylonish captivity to a “wilderness;”
but God wished that they should see plainly, in the wilderness in which
John taught, the image and likeness of that miserably ruinous condition
by which the whole beauty of the Church was injured and almost
destroyed. What is here described metaphorically by the Prophet was at
that time actually fulfilled; for at an exceedingly disordered and
ruinous crisis John lifted up the banner of joy. True, indeed, the same
voice had been previously uttered by Daniel, Zechariah, and others; but
the nearer the redemption approached, the more impressively could it be
proclaimed by John, who also pointed out Christ with the finger. (<span
id="ix.i-p96.4"></span>[Joh 1:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#029.md)<span
id="ix.i-p96.4"></span>.) But because, in the midst of a nation which
was ignorant and almost sunk in stupidity, there were few that sincerely
grieved for their ruinous condition, John sought a wilderness, that the
very sight of the place might arouse careless persons to hope and desire
the promised deliverance. As to his denying that he was a Prophet,
(<span id="ix.i-p96.5"></span>[Joh
1:21](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#021)<span id="ix.i-p96.5"></span>,.md)
this depends on the end of his calling and the substance of his
doctrine; for he was not sent to discharge apart any continued office,
but, as a herald, to gain an audience for Christ his Master and Lord.
What is here said about removing obstructions, he applies skilfully to
individuals, on this ground, that the depravity of our nature, the
windings of a crooked mind, and obstinacy of heart, shut up the way of
the Lord, and hinder them from preparing, by true self-denial, to yield
obedience.

<span id="ix.i-p97"></span><span id="ix.i-p97.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p98"></span>**4.** *Every valley shall be exalted.* He
confirms and asserts the preceding statement; for he shews that no
difficulties can prevent the Lord from delivering and restoring his
Church whenever he shall think fit. These words might with propriety be
rendered in the imperative mood, “Let every valley be exalted,”  <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) so as to be placed in immediate
connection with the command which God gives by his prophets to prepare
and level the way for himself; but it makes hardly any difference in the
meaning. Let us be satisfied with understanding the Prophet’s design,
“that, although many and formidable difficulties are started to hinder
the salvation of the Church, still the hand of God will be victorious
and will prevail.”

<span id="ix.i-p100"></span>*And every mountain and hill shall be laid
low.* It ought to be observed that many obstructions always arise
whenever God makes provision for our deliverance, or wishes to aid the
afflicted; and although his glory is more fully displayed by these
obstructions, yet we suffer no loss; for we behold more clearly his
wonderful power when no strength, or efforts, or contrivances of men can
prevent him from gaining his object. He conducts his people through
“mountains” and steep places in such a manner as if the road were
perfectly level; and by the words *mountains and hills,* the Prophet
undoubtedly intends to denote metaphorically obstructions of every kind;
for Satan attempts in every way to hinder our salvation. When we come,
therefore, to spiritual redemption, these words undoubtedly include both
internal and external obstacles, — lusts and wicked desires, ambition,
foolish confidence, and impatience, which retard us wonderfully, but the
Lord will break them all down; for when he stretches out his hand,
nothing can restrain or drive him back.

<span id="ix.i-p101"></span><span id="ix.i-p101.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p102"></span>**5.** *And the glory of Jehovah shall be
revealed.* He means that this work of redemption will be splendid, so
that the Lord will shew that he is the Author of it, and will
illustriously display his majesty and power. This, indeed, is very
openly manifested in all places and in all events, but he promises that
he will do this especially in protecting and delivering his Church, and
not without good reason; for the deliverance of the Church, from its
commencement down to the coming of Christ, might be called a renewal of
the world.  <span id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) And because the
power of God, which he had formerly been accustomed to display, was
almost extinguished, so that scarcely the slightest traces were
discernible, as it is said in the Psalm, “We do not see our signs,”
(<span id="ix.i-p103.2"></span>[Ps
74:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa074.htm#009)<span id="ix.i-p103.2"></span>;.md)
this was a very seasonable warning, that a new and striking
demonstration is promised, by which they may perceive that God has in
his power various methods of giving relief, even when he conceals them
for a time.

<span id="ix.i-p104"></span>*And all flesh shall see.* He now heightens
the miracle by an additional circumstance, that it will be known not
only in Judea, but in foreign and distant countries; for by these words
“All flesh shall see,” he means that there will be no nations that do
not see clearly that the return of the people is a heavenly work, and
that God did not speak in vain by the Prophet. Thus he censures the
unbelief of men, who never rely on the promises of God, and who treat as
fables whatever is said by the prophets, till by beholding the actual
fact they are constrained to yield.

<span id="ix.i-p105"></span>*That the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken.*
Here we are taught what is the true method of correcting our unbelief;
that is, to be employed in meditating on the promises of God, and to
have our faith strengthened by all the proofs of them which he exhibits.
Thus it is proper to join doctrine with experience; for since the sight
of God’s works would produce little impression on us, he first
enlightens us by the torch of his word, and next seals the truth of it
by the actual accomplishment.

<span id="ix.i-p106"></span><span id="ix.i-p106.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p107"></span>**6.** *The voice said, Cry.* He now
describes a different “voice” from that of which he formerly spoke; for
hitherto he had spoken about the “voice” of the prophets, but now he
means the “voice” of God himself commanding the prophets to *cry.*
Although the voice of the prophets is also the voice of God, whose
instruments they are, (for they do not speak of themselves,) (<span
id="ix.i-p107.1"></span>[2 Pet. 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021)<span id="ix.i-p107.1"></span>,.md)
yet this distinction is necessary, that we may know when the Lord
commands, and when the prophets and ministers execute his commandments.
There is also a beautiful comparison between the two “voices,” that we
may receive with as much reverence what the prophets utter as if God
himself thundered from heaven; for they speak only by his mouth, and
repeat as ambassadors what he has commissioned them to declare. Besides,
this preface gives notice that the Prophet is about to speak of
something highly important; for, although he everywhere testifies that
he faithfully delivers from hand to hand what he has received from God,
yet, in order to obtain closer attention, he states that the voice of
God has expressly enjoined the mode of speaking which he shall employ.
Such is also the import of the word *Cry,* as if he had said that he
must proclaim this commandment in a clear and loud voice, that it may
make the deeper impression.

<span id="ix.i-p108"></span>*And I said, What shall I cry?* The addition
of this question has great weight; for the Prophet means that he does
not break forth at random, and boast of what he appeared to have heard
in a confused manner; but that he received clear and undoubted
instruction, after having waited for it with composure. Besides, from
the fact itself we may learn that there is nothing here that is
superfluous, because two chief points of heavenly doctrine were to be
briefly handled; that, although man is smoke and vanity, and all his
excellence is deceitful and fading, yet believers have the best reason
for glorying, because they seek salvation not from themselves; and that,
although they are strangers on the earth, (<span
id="ix.i-p108.1"></span>[Heb
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013)<span id="ix.i-p108.1"></span>,.md)
yet they possess heavenly happiness, because God unites himself to them
by his word; for by renouncing ourselves we are led to desire the grace
of God. The Prophet knew, indeed, what he ought to say; but by this
question he intended to make a stronger impression on their minds, in
order to shew that he and all the other servants of God are constrained
by necessity to utter this sentiment, and that they cannot begin to
teach in any other manner, though they should put a hundred questions
and inquiries; as indeed they will gain nothing by choosing to adopt any
other method.

<span id="ix.i-p109"></span>As to the word *Cry,* I have no objection to
view it as denoting both boldness and clearness; because prophets ought
not to mutter in an obscure manner, but to pronounce their message with
a distinct voice, and to utter boldly and with open mouth whatever they
have been commanded to declare. Let every one, therefore, who is called
to this office constantly remember and believe, that he ought to meet
difficulties of every sort with unshaken boldness, such as was always
manifested both by prophets and by apostles.

<span id="ix.i-p110"></span>“Wo to me,” says Paul, “if I do not preach
the gospel; for necessity is laid on me.”*  
*(<span id="ix.i-p110.2"></span>[1Co
9:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#016)<span id="ix.i-p110.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.i-p111"></span>*All flesh is grass.* First, it ought to be
observed, that he does not speak merely of the frailty of human life,
but extends the discourse farther, so as to reduce to nothing all the
excellence which men think that they possess. David indeed compares this
life to grass, (<span id="ix.i-p111.1"></span>[Ps
103:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#015)<span id="ix.i-p111.1"></span>,.md)
because it is fading and transitory; but the context shews that the
Prophet does not speak only of the outward man, but includes the gifts
of the mind, of which men are exceedingly proud, such as prudence,
courage, acuteness, judgment, skill in the transactions of business, in
which they think that they excel other animals; and this is more fully
expressed by that which immediately follows —

<span id="ix.i-p112"></span>*All the grace of it.* Some translate <span
id="ix.i-p112.1"></span>חסדו *(chasdo)* “his glory;” others, “his
kindness;” but I have preferred the word “grace,” by which I mean
everything that procures honor and esteem to men. Yet a passive
signification may also be admitted; as if the Prophet had said, that all
that is excellent and worthy of applause among men is the absolute
kindness of God. Thus David calls God “the God of his kindness,” (<span
id="ix.i-p112.2"></span>[Ps. 59:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#010.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/psa059.htm#017)<span id="ix.i-p112.2"></span>,.md)
because he acknowledges him to be the author of all blessings, and
ascribes it to his grace that he has obtained them so largely and
abundantly. It is indeed certain that <span id="ix.i-p112.3"></span>חסד
*(chesed)* here denotes all that is naturally most highly valued among
men, and that the Prophet condemns it for vanity, because there is an
implied contrast between the ordinary nature of mankind and the grace of
regeneration.

<span id="ix.i-p113"></span>Some commentators refer this to the
Assyrians, as if the Prophet, by extenuating their power and wealth, and
industry and exertions, or rather by treating these as they had no
existence, freed the minds of the Jews from terror. They bring out the
meaning in this manner, “If you are terrified at the strength of men,
remember that they are flesh, which quickly gives way through its own
weakness. But their error is soon afterwards refuted by the context, in
which the Prophet expressly applies it to the Jews themselves. We ought
carefully to observe that man, with his faculties, on account of which
he is accustomed to value himself so highly, is wholly compared to *a
flower.* All men are fully convinced of the frailty of human life, and
on this subject heathen writers have argued at great length; but it is
far more difficult to root out the confidence which men entertain
through a false opinion of their wisdom; for, if they imagine that they
have either knowledge or industry beyond others, they think that they
have a right to glory in them. But he shews that in man there is nothing
so excellent as not to fade quickly and perish.

<span id="ix.i-p114"></span>*As the flower of the field.* The Prophet
seems, as if in mockery, to add a sort of correction; for *a flower* is
something more than *grass.* It is, therefore, an acknowledgment, that,
although men have some shining qualities, like flowers in the fields,
yet the beauty and lustre quickly vanish and pass away, so that it is
useless for them to flatter or applaud themselves on account of this
idle and deceitful splendor.

<span id="ix.i-p115"></span><span id="ix.i-p115.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p116"></span>**7.** *The grass is withered.* This might
be understood to relate to the beauty of the fields, which is spoiled by
a single gust of wind, as it is said, (<span id="ix.i-p116.2"></span>[Ps
103:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#016)<span id="ix.i-p116.2"></span>,.md)
“As soon as the wind passeth over it, it is gone;” for we know that the
wind is called “the Spirit of God” in other passages. But I am more
inclined to think that the metaphor is adapted to the present subject;
for otherwise the application of it would be somewhat obscure. The
Prophet therefore explains what object he has in view, by saying that
men, with all their glory, are nothing else than grass; theft is,
because *the Spirit of God* will quickly carry them away by a single
breath.

<span id="ix.i-p117"></span>*Because the Spirit of Jehovah hath blown
upon it.* The meaning may be thus explained, “However illustrious are
the gifts with which men are endowed, yet as soon as the Spirit of God
shall blow upon them, they shall fed that they are nothing.” For the
false confidence with which they intoxicate themselves springs from this
source, that they do not appear before God, but, in order to indulge
freely in flattering themselves, creep into places of concealment. That
they may no longer deceive themselves by a foolish delight in falsehood,
the Prophet drags them into the presence of God, and admits that
apparently they flourish, when they have been withdrawn from God; but as
soon as the Lord has breathed upon them, all their strength and beauty
perish and decay.

<span id="ix.i-p118"></span>But it may be thought that he assigns to
“the Spirit of God” an office which is greatly at variance with his
nature; for it belongs to him “to renew by his power the face of the
earth.” (<span id="ix.i-p118.1"></span>[Ps
104:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#030)<span id="ix.i-p118.1"></span>..md)
On the other hand, if the Lord withdraw his Spirit, all is reduced to
nothing. Here Isaiah asserts what is exceedingly different, and appears
to contradict David. But there is no absurdity in saying that all things
are renewed by the power of the Spirit, and again, that what formerly
appeared to be something is reduced to nothing; for we are nothing but
in God, and, in order that we may begin to be something in him, we must
first be convinced, and made thoroughly to know, that we are vanity.
Therefore does the Lord breathe upon us, that we may know that of
ourselves we are nothing.

<span id="ix.i-p119"></span>*Surely the people is grass.* The Prophet
added this, that all might know that he was not speaking of foreigners,
but of that people which gloried in the name of God; for the Jews might
have thought that they were more excellent, and held a higher rank than
other men, and that on this account they ought to be exempted from the
common lot. He therefore addresses theta expressly and by name, that
they may not claim anything for themselves above others; as if he had
said, that they would act wisely if, through a conviction of their
poverty, they should cast away all confidence in themselves. In a word,
the Prophet, after having mentioned consolation, shews in what way men
must be prepared to receive it; for they are not capable of it till they
have formerly been reduced to nothing. Our hardness must therefore be
softened, our haughtiness must be east down and laid low, our boasting
must be put to shame, and our hearts must be subdued and humbled, if we
wish to receive with any advantage the consolations which the prophets
bring to us by the command of God.

<span id="ix.i-p120"></span><span id="ix.i-p120.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p121"></span>**8.** *The grass withereth.* This
repetition is again added for the purpose of bringing to nought the
glory of the flesh, but at the same time contains within itself a highly
valuable consolation, that God, when he has cast down his people,
immediately raises up and restores them. The context therefore runs
thus: “The grass indeed withereth and perisheth, but the word of the
Lord endureth for ever.” After having learned how empty and destitute we
are of all blessings, how transitory and fading is the glory of the
flesh, the only consolation left for us, that we may be raised up by the
word of the Lord, as by an outstretched hand, is, that we are frail and
fading, but that the word of the Lord is durable and eternal, and, in a
word, that the life which we need is offered to us from another quarter.

<span id="ix.i-p122"></span>*But the word of our God shall stand for
ever.* This passage comprehends the whole Gospel in few words; for it
consists of an acknowledgment of our misery, poverty, and emptiness,
that, being sincerely humbled, we may fly to God, by whom alone we shall
be perfectly restored. Let not men therefore faint or be discouraged by
the knowledge of their nakedness and emptiness; for the eternal word is
exhibited to them by which they may be abundantly supported and upheld.
We are likewise taught that we ought not to seek consolation from any
other source than from eternity, which ought not to be sought anywhere
else than in God; since nothing that is firm or durable will be found on
the earth. Nothing is more foolish than to rest satisfied with the
present state, which we see to be fleeting; and every man is mistaken
who hopes to be able to obtain perfect happiness till he has ascended to
God, whom the Scripture calls eternal, in order that we may know that
life flows to us from him; and indeed he adopts us to be his children on
this condition, to make us partakers of his immortality.

<span id="ix.i-p123"></span>But this would be of no avail, if the manner
of seeking him were not pointed out; and therefore he exhibits *the
word,* from which we must not in any respect turn aside; for if we make
the smallest departure from it, we shall be involved in strange
labyrinths, and shall find no way of extricating ourselves. Now, the
word is called eternal, not merely in itself, but in us; and this ought
to be particularly observed, because otherwise we could obtain no
consolation. And thus Peter, a faithful expounder of this passage,
applies it to us, when he says that “we are regenerated by this
incorruptible seed, that is,” says he, “by the word which is preached.”
(<span id="ix.i-p123.1"></span>[1 Pet.
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023.md),
[25](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#025)<span id="ix.i-p123.1"></span>..md)
Hence we infer, what I mentioned a little before, that life is prepared
for the dead who shall come thirsting to the fountain that is exhibited
to them; for the power which is hid in God is revealed to us by the
word.

<span id="ix.i-p124"></span><span id="ix.i-p124.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p125"></span>**9.** *Ascend on the high mountain.* He
proceeds with the same subject; for the Lord, having formerly promised
that he would give prophets who should soothe the grief and fear of the
people by promises, now commands that this consolation shall be more
widely spread; because it is his pleasure to diffuse his grace
throughout the whole of Judea.

<span id="ix.i-p126"></span>*Lift up thy voice aloud, O Jerusalem.*
Formerly he had given to *Jerusalem,* and *Zion* the hope of this joyful
message; now he commands that the same voice shall be spread and shall
be heard through other cities, and, for this reason, gives orders that
the loud voice shall be lifted up, and proclaimed from a lofty place.
Although by the words “Zion” and “Jerusalem” he means the same thing,
yet the repetition is emphatic; for he shews that one city excels all
other cities, for no other reason than because God hath chosen it to be
his sanctuary.

<span id="ix.i-p127"></span>*That bringest tidings.* He gives to the
city this appellation, because there the priests and Levites were
instructed according to the injunctions of the Law, that they might be
the teachers of the whole people, and by their labors might spread the
doctrine of salvation. (<span id="ix.i-p127.1"></span>[Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007)<span id="ix.i-p127.1"></span>..md)
Yet we ought carefully to observe this commendation which God bestows on
his Church, that it may not be without a clear mark of distinction; for
an assembly in which the preaching of heavenly doctrine is not heard
does not deserve to be reckoned a Church. In this sense also, Paul calls
it (<span id="ix.i-p127.2"></span>[1Ti
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#015)<span id="ix.i-p127.2"></span>.md)
“the pillar and foundation of the truth;” for although God might have
governed us by himself, and without the agency of men, yet he has
assigned this office to his Church, and has committed to it the
invaluable treasure of his Word. For the same reason it will be called
in another passage, “the mother of all believers.” (<span
id="ix.i-p127.3"></span>[Isa 54:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa054.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.i-p127.3"></span>; <span id="ix.i-p127.4"></span>[Ga
4:26](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026)<span id="ix.i-p127.4"></span>..md)
Hence it follows that nothing is more absurd and wicked than for dumb
idols to boast of the name of the Church, as is done in Popery.

<span id="ix.i-p128"></span>We are likewise taught, that the Church has
not been instructed by God, in order that she may keep her knowledge
hidden within herself, but that she may publish what she has learned.
Besides, he commands that grace shall be freely and boldly proclaimed,
that prophets and teachers may not speak with timidity, as if it were a
doubtful matter, but may shew that they are fully convinced of the
certainty of those things which they promise, because they know well
that “God, who cannot lie,” (<span id="ix.i-p128.1"></span>Titus 1:2,)
is the Author of them. He enjoins the witnesses of his grace to proceed
from Zion, that they may fill with joy the whole of Judea.

<span id="ix.i-p129"></span>*Behold* your *God!* This expression
includes the sum of our happiness, which consists solely in the presence
of God. It brings along with it an abundance of all blessings; and if we
are destitute of it, we must be utterly miserable and wretched; and
although blessings of every kind are richly enjoyed by us, yet if we are
estranged from God, everything must tend to our destruction. From this
circumstance it ought also to be remarked, that nothing is more opposite
to faith than to estimate by the present appearances of things what God
declares by his prophets, who at that time must have been struck dumb,
had they not raised their views above the world, and thus, through the
power of unshaken boldness and perseverance, dared to draw others along
with them, that they might cherish good hopes when matters were at the
worst. And indeed when wicked men and wickedness prevail, the greater
the terror that is spread all around, and the greater the seeming
wretchedness of the Church, the more ought we to extol the grace of God,
and to point out his presence to believers.  <span

<span id="ix.i-p131"></span><span id="ix.i-p131.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p132"></span>**10.** *Behold, the Lord Jehovah.* He
adorns this short sentence by many words, because some explanation was
needed; and he again uses the word *Behold* for the sake of certainty,
in order to impart greater confidence to the hearts of good men. Thus he
shews more clearly how great advantage they derive from the presence of
God. And first, he says, *that he will come with strength,* and that
strength not unemployed, but accompanied by such an effect as we shall
perceive.

<span id="ix.i-p133"></span>*And his* arm *shall be powerful to him*
 <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) <span
id="ix.i-p134.1"></span>לו *(lo),* which we have translated to *him,* is
translated by others *of himself;* or, perhaps, it will be thought
preferable to translate it, “He is powerful, or reigns *for* *himself.”*
The meaning is, that God is sufficient for himself, and does not need
the assistance of any one.

<span id="ix.i-p135"></span>*Behold, his reward is with him, and his
work before his face.* By the repetition of the words “reward” and
“work,” he states more clearly what has been already expressed; for it
is very customary with Hebrew writers to express the same thing in two
different ways. “Reward” does not here denote what is due to merits, but
the justice of God, by which he testifies that he is a rewarder to all
who truly and sincerely call upon him. (<span
id="ix.i-p135.1"></span>[Heb 11:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#006.md)<span
id="ix.i-p135.1"></span>.) That this is the signification of the word
<span id="ix.i-p135.2"></span>שכר *(sachar)* is known to all who are
moderately acquainted with the Hebrew language. The meaning may be thus
summed up: “God will not come to be beheld by us as unemployed, but to
display his power, and to make us feel it;” and thus, instead of the
word “work,” the word “effect” would not be inapplicable. Many persons
attempt an ingenious exposition of these words, and enter into childish
discussion about the words “work” and “reward,” as if the “work” were a
merit on which a “reward” is bestowed. But nothing was farther from the
view of the Prophet; for he repeats the same thing, as we have already
said, and declares the result of the coming of the Lord, from which
believers will derive the highest advantage.

<span id="ix.i-p136"></span><span id="ix.i-p136.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p137"></span>**11.** *As a shepherd.* In this verse he
declares what is the nature of that work of the Lord; for since he works
in various and, indeed, in innumerable ways, the hearer might have been
kept in suspense as to the work which God intended to accomplish; and
thus the general doctrine would have been less efficacious in exciting
hope. Though he does not describe every part, yet he states in a few
words that God has determined to protect and guard his Church. On this
account he compares him to “a shepherd;” and under this designation he
expresses his infinite love towards us, when he does not refuse to stoop
so low as to perform towards us the office of “a shepherd.” In other
passages, and even a little before, (<span id="ix.i-p137.1"></span>[Isa
34:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#002.md)<span id="ix.i-p137.1"></span>,
etc.,) he described himself as armed with terrible power for the defense
of his people, and a little after this he repeats the same statement;
but here he ascribes to him a more amiable character, that believers may
sweetly repose under his protection.

<span id="ix.i-p138"></span>*He will feed his flock.* Now, although by
the word “flock” he describes an elect people, whom he had undertaken to
govern, yet we are reminded that God will be a shepherd to none but to
those who, in modesty and gentleness, shall imitate the sheep and lambs.
For this reason we ought to observe the character of the flock; for he
does not choose to feed savage beasts, but lambs. We must therefore lay
aside our fierceness, and permit ourselves to be tamed, if we wish to be
gathered into the fold of which God promises that he will be the
guardian.

<span id="ix.i-p139"></span>*He will carry them in his bosom.* These
words describe God’s wonderful condescension; for not only is he
actuated by a general feeling of regard to his whole flock, but, in
proportion to the weakness of any one sheep, he shews his carefulness in
watching, his gentleness in handling, and his patience in leading it.
Here he leaves out nothing that belongs to the office of a good
shepherd; for the shepherd ought to observe every sheep, so as to treat
it according to its capacity; and especially they ought to be supported,
if they are exceedingly weak. In a word, God will be mild, kind, gentle,
and compassionate, so that he will not drive the weak harder than they
are able to bear.

<span id="ix.i-p140"></span><span id="ix.i-p140.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p141"></span>**12.** *Who hath measured?* After having
spoken of God’s friendly care in defending his people, he now proclaims
his power, and bestows upon it all possible commendations, which,
however, would produce less impression upon us, if we did not attend to
the Prophet’s design. At first sight, ignorant readers would think that
the Prophet crowds together unfinished sentences, which would be absurd.
But if we look at his object, he adorns the power of God by a seasonable
and elegant discourse, which is a true support of our faith, that we may
not hesitate to believe that he will do what he has promised. Not
without reason does Paul say that Abraham did not hesitate, because he
believed that God who had promised was able to perform what he had said.
(<span id="ix.i-p141.1"></span>[Rom.
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021)<span id="ix.i-p141.1"></span>..md) In
the same sense also he testifies of himself in another passage,

<span id="ix.i-p142"></span>“I know whom I have believed; God is able to
keep what I have committed to him.”  
(<span id="ix.i-p142.2"></span>[2Ti
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012)<span id="ix.i-p142.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.i-p143"></span>Such is also the import of those words of
Christ,

<span id="ix.i-p144"></span>“My Father who gave you to me is greater
than all.”  
(<span id="ix.i-p144.2"></span>[Joh
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#029)<span id="ix.i-p144.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.i-p145"></span>Since, therefore, we ought continually to
strive against distrust, and since Satan attacks us by various
contrivances, it is of great importance that the promises of God should
be believed by us, to give to his power the praise which it deserves.
Now, because the restoration of the people was beyond belief, it was
necessary that godly minds should he raised above the world, that they
might not view the grace of God as limited to human means.

<span id="ix.i-p146"></span>We see that the Prophet does not merely
teach that God is the Creator of heaven and earth, but applies to the
present subject all that he relates concerning God’s infinite power; and
in like manner it is fitted for our guidance. When any adversity befalls
us, our salvation is hidden, and, as if a cloud had come between, the
power of God is concealed; we are held in astonishment, as if the Lord
had forsaken and overlooked us. Let us not, therefore, think that the
Prophet speaks of some ordinary matter; for if this conviction of the
power of God were deeply seated in our hearts, we would not be so much
alarmed, and would not be disturbed by any calamity whatever. On this
power, as we have said, Abraham leaned, that he might cordially embrace
what was otherwise incredible; and, accordingly, Paul affirms (<span
id="ix.i-p146.1"></span>[Ro 4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018.md)<span
id="ix.i-p146.1"></span>) that “he hoped against hope;” for he believed
that God was able to do what he had said, and did not waver or stagger
in his mind. We are thus taught to raise our eyes above this world, that
we may not judge by outward appearances, but may believe that what God
hath spoken will come to pass; because all things are at his disposal.

<span id="ix.i-p147"></span>While this conviction is necessary for all,
I have said that the Jews had very great need of it; for they were
pressed hard by very powerful enemies, they had no means of escape and
no hope of freedom, and nothing was to be seen on every hand but a large
and frightful wilderness. In vain, therefore, would consolation have
been offered to them, had they not, at the suggestion of the Prophet,
raised their minds to heaven, and, disregarding the appearances of
things, fixed their whole heart on the power of God.

<span id="ix.i-p148"></span>When he names “measures,” which are used by
men in very small matters, he accommodates himself to our ignorance; for
thus does the Lord often prattle with us, and borrow comparisons from
matters that are familiar to us, when he speaks of his majesty; that our
ignorant and limited minds may better understand his greatness and
excellence. Away, then, with all gross conceptions of God; for his
greatness far exceeds all creatures, so that heaven, and earth, and sea,
and all that they contain, however vast may be their extent, yet in
comparison of him are nothing.

<span id="ix.i-p149"></span><span id="ix.i-p149.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p150"></span>**13.** *Who instructed the Spirit of
Jehovah?* What the Prophet had formerly taught concerning the Lord’s
goodness and power he now adds concerning his wisdom. And we ought to
observe the connection; for, us carnal sense wickedly limits the power
of God to human means, so it improperly subjects his inscrutable counsel
to human reasonings. Till God be exalted above all creatures, many
difficulties present themselves to interrupt the course of his works;
and, therefore, if we form a judgment according to our own opinion,
various scruples will immediately arise. Thus, whenever we do not see
how God will do this or that, we doubt if it will take place; because
what surpasses our reason appears to be impossible. Consequently, as we
ought to contrast, the power of God with our weakness, so our insolence
ought to be repressed by his incomparable, wisdom.

<span id="ix.i-p151"></span>By inquiring, who guided or directed the
Spirit of God, he means that God had no need of a teacher, to go before
and inform him about things unknown. *Spirit* here denotes reason,
judgment, or understanding; for he borrows a comparison from the nature
of men, that he may more fully accommodate himself to them; and I do not
think that this ought to be understood as denoting the essential Spirit
of God.

<span id="ix.i-p152"></span><span id="ix.i-p152.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p153"></span>**14.** *From whom took he counsel?* The
Prophet expresses the same thing in many ways; that we may know that
nothing is more foolish than man,  <span
id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) when he ventures to lift himself up
into heaven, to examine or judge by his own ability the works of God. In
these words, therefore, Isaiah intended to repress more and more the
insolence and rashness of men. Paul quotes this proof for the same
purpose, to deter us from judging of the unsearchable counsel of God;
for God does not wish us to inquire concerning his wisdom but in a sober
and becoming manner. (<span id="ix.i-p154.2"></span>[Ro
11:34](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#034)<span id="ix.i-p154.2"></span>..md)
There is one difference, that Paul affirms that the spiritual mystery of
the gospel cannot be fathomed by the human understanding, while the
Prophet pronounces a commendation, in general terms, on the providence
of God. But on both points we ought to learn humility, and to bring all
our senses captive to obedience. All the reason or understanding that we
have is mere darkness, till we have been enlightened by Christ.

<span id="ix.i-p155"></span><span id="ix.i-p155.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p156"></span>**15.** *Behold, the nations are as a drop
of a bucket.* If we wish to understand the Prophet’s meaning, and to
read these words with advantage, we must (as I remarked a little before)
understand his design. He does not celebrate the greatness of God in a
detached manner, but extols it with the utmost. possible adaptation to
the present subject, that Israelites may know that this shield alone is
sufficient to protect them, and that they will have no reason to dread
the efforts, or rage, or violence of the world, if God be reconciled to
them, and that they may thus learn to betake themselves to God’s
protection; for if they were not fully convinced of this, there would
arise at every moment various causes of despair. Isaiah thus continues
the subject, when he says that all nations and peoples are nothing when
compared with God; for, by simply breathing on them, he will scatter
like *small dust* all the inhabitants of the earth. In consequence of
our being excessively prone and foolishly ingenious in devising reasons
of distrust, we imagine that everything that Satan does for the purpose
of hindering our salvation blocks up the path of God. For the purpose of
correcting this error, the Prophet declares that all the creatures are
nothing before God, and that all the nations resemble small and
inconsiderable drops of water. Hence we infer that nothing can be more
contrary to reason than to exalt creatures for the sake of diminishing
the power of God, which is high above all, and ought to be so
acknowledged.

<span id="ix.i-p157"></span><span id="ix.i-p157.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p158"></span>**16.** *And Lebanon would not be
sufficient.* That is, “If we must sacrifice to God according to what he
deserves, neither the whole of Lebanon, nor the beasts that graze upon
it, would be sufficient for a sacrifice.” By various forms of expression
he dwells largely on this power of God, that men, being’ convinced of
it, may care nothing about creatures and all their might. Yet the
Prophet appears to speak expressly of the worship of God, in order to
lead readers to cherish deeper reverence for him; as if he had said,
“Will you dare to measure by your own judgment the power of God, whom
you will not be prepared, for worshipping aright, even though you should
amass all the beasts and all the wood that are on Lebanon?” Hence some
infer that no man can entitle himself to the favor of God by sacrifices.
This, indeed, is true; but we ought, as has been already said, to
consider the design of the Prophet, who, for the purpose of encouraging
the Jews to cherish stronger confidence, shews that in comparison of God
all things are nothing.

<span id="ix.i-p159"></span><span id="ix.i-p159.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p160"></span>**17.** *All nations.* He repeats what he
had said, that it is in the power and at the disposal of God to destroy
“all nations,” whenever he shall think proper; and that, even while they
remain in their present condition, they are reckoned as nothing before
him. But it may be thought absurd for him to say, that “the nations are
nothing,” since God created them, that they might be something. I reply,
this is said by comparison; for the depravity of the human mind is such
that it obscures the divine majesty, and places above it those things
which ought to have been subject to God; and, therefore, when we come to
that contest, we may boldly declare that everything that is compared
with God is worthless. Nor does Isaiah speak merely about the nature of
men, such as it was created by God; but his aim is to abase and restrain
their pride, when they venture to exalt themselves against God. We know
that we cannot subsist but in God, in whom alone, as Paul declares, “we
live, and move, and are.” (<span id="ix.i-p160.1"></span>[Ac
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028)<span id="ix.i-p160.1"></span>..md)
Nothing is more vain than man; and, as David says,

<span id="ix.i-p161"></span>“If he be laid in the balance with vanity,
he will be found to be even lighter than vanity.” (<span
id="ix.i-p161.1"></span>[Ps 62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009.md)<span
id="ix.i-p161.1"></span>.)

<span id="ix.i-p162"></span>In the same manner does Isaiah affirm that
“the nations” are not only “nothing,” but “less than nothing.” in order
to exhibit more fully their feebleness and vanity.  <span
id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md)

<span id="ix.i-p164"></span><span id="ix.i-p164.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p165"></span>**18.** *To whom then have ye likened God?*
The Jews were in great danger from another temptation; for there was
reason to believe that the Assyrians and Babylonians would not have
obtained so many victories without their assistance; and hence they
might naturally conclude, “Of what avail is it to us to have a peculiar
manner of worshipping God which differs from other nations; for our
enemies fight under the favor and protection of heaven, while we are not
cheered by any assistance from the God whom we worship?” Neither can
there be any doubt, that the captives were taunted by unbelievers, as is
evident from other passages. (<span id="ix.i-p165.1"></span>[Ps
137:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#003.md)<span id="ix.i-p165.1"></span>;
<span id="ix.i-p165.2"></span>[La
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#015)<span id="ix.i-p165.2"></span>..md)
That true religion may not be ruined among the Jews on account of the
calamity which they had sustained, God rises up, and proclaims that a
grievous injury is done to him, if believers, discouraged by adversity,
turn aside to the idols and superstitions of the Gentiles. Thus he
confirms them in the faith of the promises, that they may not sink under
the weight of the punishments which they endure.

<span id="ix.i-p166"></span>The Prophet, as we formerly suggested, does
not address merely the men of his own age, but posterity, who would have
a still severer contest with the mockeries of the nations whose captives
they were, and likewise with bad examples and customs; for when, in
consequence of being mingled with heathen nations, they daily beheld
many corruptions of piety, it was more difficult for them steadily to
persevere. That they might not entertain any foolish notion that high
prosperity attended the worshippers of false gods, the Prophet meets
this error, and reminds them that God, whom they and their fathers
worshipped, ought not to be compared with the gods of the Gentiles; for
these were made by men, and were composed of gold or silver, wood or
stone; but God created all things; and therefore that the highest injury
is done to God, not only by comparing his majesty with things of no
value, but even by not, placing him far above all the angels and
everything that is reckoned divine.

<span id="ix.i-p167"></span>When Paul employs this passage (<span
id="ix.i-p167.1"></span>[Ac 17:29](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#029.md)<span
id="ix.i-p167.1"></span>) as a proof against idolaters, or at least
quotes the words of the Prophet, he does not wrest them from their true
meaning. He infers, indeed, from them that to frame any image of God is
exceedingly wicked, while the Prophet, in guarding the Jews against
distrust, at the same time condemns the superstitions of the Gentiles,
and declares that it is inconsistent with the nature of God to be
represented by painting or by any kind of likeness. This shews clearly
that Paul’s doctrine fully agrees with it; for the Prophet, after having
shewn that the power of God is infinite, since he holds all things in
his fist, at length concludes, *“To whom then will ye liken me?* for no
image that is formed will have any likeness or resemblance to me.”

<span id="ix.i-p168"></span>*Or, what resemblance will you appoint to
him?* This is a useful doctrine, and worthy of observation; for were
there nothing more than this single passage, it would be perfectly
sufficient for refuting the inventions by which Papists deceive
themselves, when they think that they have a right to represent God by
outward figures. The Prophet declares that it is impossible to frame out
of dead matter an image which shall have any resemblance to the glory of
God. He openly rejects idols, and does not even speak of the worship of
them, but affirms that to manufacture and set them up before God is
wicked and abominable. The Scripture is full of such proofs. Moses
warned a people prone to this vice,

<span id="ix.i-p169"></span>“Thou sawest no image or shape in the
mountain, thou only heardest a voice. See then and beware that thou be
not led astray so as to frame for thyself any image.”  
(<span id="ix.i-p169.2"></span>[Deut.
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#012.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#015)<span id="ix.i-p169.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.i-p170"></span>In order to know God, therefore, we must not
frame a likeness of him according to our own fancy, but we must betake
ourselves to the Word, in which his lively image is exhibited to us.
Satisfied with that communication, let us not attempt anything else of
our own. Other ways and methods, such as idols and images, teach us
vanity and falsehood, and not truth, as Jeremiah beautifully says, “The
wood is the instruction of vanities,” (<span
id="ix.i-p170.1"></span>[Jer 10:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#008.md)<span
id="ix.i-p170.1"></span>,) and Habakkuk, “His graven image is
falsehood.” (<span id="ix.i-p170.2"></span>[Hab
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#018)<span id="ix.i-p170.2"></span>..md)
When the Lord sometimes compares himself to a lion, a bear, a man, or
other objects, this has nothing to do with images, as the Papists
imagine, but by those metaphors either the kindness and mercy of God, or
his wroth and displeasure, and other things of the same nature, are
expressed; for God cannot reveal himself to us in any other way than by
a comparison with things which we know. In short, if it were lawful to
frame or set up an image of God, that would be a point of resemblance to
the gods of the Gentiles, and this declaration of the Prophet could not
be maintained.

<span id="ix.i-p171"></span><span id="ix.i-p171.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p172"></span>**19.** *The carver prepares a graven
image.* As public opinion has great force, and everything that pleases
the multitude passes for a law, the Prophet fortifies believers against
this error. These words therefore convey an anticipation, that the Jews
may not be terrified when they see the Gentiles laboring with all their
might to make idols, for in this way they deceive and ensnare each
other. But he attacks the madness of the whole world,  <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) on this ground, that all are impelled
by such outrageous zeal to the practice of superstition, and every man
is his own instructor in the formation of idols.

<span id="ix.i-p174"></span><span id="ix.i-p174.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p175"></span>**20.** *The poor chooseth for his offering
wood that will not rot.* He concludes that no class of men is free from
that crime, that the rich and poor alike are guilty and condemned; for
the rich make their gods of gold or silver, and the poor of wood which
they had selected. Hence he shews that all men are carried away by
strange madness, and that even though they have not the means, still
they desire to have something excellent for the worship of their gods.
Men wish to enjoy the presence of God, and this is the beginning and
source of idolatry; for God is not present with us by an idol, but by
his word and by the power of his Spirit; and although he holds out to us
in the sacraments an image both of his grace and of spiritual blessings,
yet this is done with no other intention than to lead us upwards to
himself. Yet the Prophet censures the folly of men, who are so blind as
to labor with excessive industry and ingenuity in highly adorning their
idols.

<span id="ix.i-p176"></span><span id="ix.i-p176.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p177"></span>**21.** *Do ye not know?* After having
ridiculed the stupidity and madness of the Gentiles, the Prophet turns
to the Jews; for we are all prone to superstition, and thus we easily
fall into it when any example is placed before our eyes. In consequence
of mixing with the Babylonians during their captivity, the Jews were
constrained to behold daily the basest examples of idolatry, and might
be led away to wicked imitation. Isaiah therefore anticipates this at an
early period, and warns them not to be carried away by the sight of such
things.

<span id="ix.i-p178"></span>He asks, “Have they not been taught, and
have they not learned who is God?” The greater part of commentators
think that all the questions here put are a repetition of the same
truth, namely, that the creation of the world shews clearly that nothing
can be more inconsistent than to seek God in wood and stone, silver and
gold. But we may infer from the context that there are two clauses. Had
he proceeded in his expostulation with the Gentiles, he would have
brought forward no other witnesses than heaven and earth. But because he
addresses the Jews who had been plainly taught by the Law, he brings
forward direct arguments to refute them, drawn both from the order of
nature and from the voice of God. And, first, he puts the question in
general terms, “Do ye not know?” Next, he adds two methods by which they
ought to have distinguished between the true God and the false gods. The
former is drawn from the hearing of the Word, and therefore he expressly
says, “Hath it not been told you? Have ye not heard?”

<span id="ix.i-p179"></span>The latter method is borrowed from that
magnificent theatre  <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) in which
the glory of God shines above and below. If the discourse had been
addressed to foreigners and heathens, he would have been satisfied with
this second demonstration, as we see that Paul also was; for, having to
do with the inhabitants of Lystra, to whom no knowledge of heavenly
doctrine had been conveyed, he employs none but natural arguments, that
“God, by giving rain and sunshine, did not leave himself (<span
id="ix.i-p180.2"></span>ἀμάρτυρον) without witness.” (<span
id="ix.i-p180.3"></span>[Ac 14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017.md)<span
id="ix.i-p180.3"></span>.) But when the Prophet spoke to the Jews about
true godliness, it would have been improper for him to pass by the Law,
which rendered them doubly inexcusable if, by neglecting it, they
profaned themselves with unbelievers; for they had been convinced not
only by the sight of their eyes, but also by the hearing of their cars,
which God beat incessantly by the preaching of his Law. Since,
therefore, from their mother’s womb they had sucked along with the milk
the true knowledge of God, and had been taught by their fathers through
a long succession of generations, the Prophet justly argues that they
will be exceedingly ungrateful and wicked, if such assistance produce no
good effect upon them.

<span id="ix.i-p181"></span>*Hath it not been told you from the
beginning?* The phrase, *from the beginning,* or “long ago,” conveys the
idea that not only had they been educated from childhood in the pure
worship of God, but during a succession of ages there had been largely
enjoyed by that nation a doctrine which would not suffer them to go
astray, provided that they were attentive; as if he had said, “Ye have
not any new God, but the same God who revealed himself from the
beginning to Abraham, Moses, and the rest of the fathers.” And indeed it
yields no small confirmation, that the doctrine which had been continued
among believers during so many ages must have been ancient. Not that
antiquity alone is sufficient for establishing the certainty of faith,
(for, on the contrary, the Gentiles might easily have objected, that
their superstitions were not less ancient,) but since “from the
beginning” the authority of the Law had been abundantly ratified, and
God had testified that it came from him, long experience added no small
confirmation, when they knew that their ancestors had delivered to
posterity a form of religion which they could not throw away without
receiving the stamp of base apostasy. Such a commencement, therefore,
and such progress quickly remove all doubt. It is one and the same faith
that has been held by us and by our fathers, for they and we have
acknowledged the same God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. The same
word, the same promises, and the same end, have been exhibited to all
believers.

<span id="ix.i-p182"></span>*From the foundations of the earth.* This is
figurative language, in which a part is taken for the whole; for a part
of the world is put; for the whole world. God has exhibited this world
as a mirror to men, that by beholding it they may acknowledge his
majesty, so that it is a lively image of invisible things, as Paul
explains at great length in the first chapter of the Epistle to the
Romans. Their ignorance is therefore “without excuse;” for they cannot
allege that they do not know God who has revealed himself in so many
ways. (<span id="ix.i-p182.1"></span>[Ro
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#020)<span id="ix.i-p182.1"></span>..md)
And indeed men sin more through insolence and pride than through
ignorance; for they despise God who manifests himself openly and speaks
plainly, and their attention is occupied with creatures, and with the
most trifling matters. Has such contempt any title to be excused? Do
they not deserve to be blinded, and to adore their own inventions
instead of God, which we see has happened to almost all? Such punishment
is unquestionably just and due to so great pride. And if to that
knowledge which we obtain through the creatures there be likewise added
the doctrine of the word, we are much less excusable. Isaiah has
therefore joined both kinds of knowledge, in order to shew that the Jews
ought to be doubly condemned, if they did not place confidence in God,
after having received instruction concerning his power and goodness.

<span id="ix.i-p183"></span><span id="ix.i-p183.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p184"></span>**22.** *It is he that sitteth.* He pursues
the same subject, though in a different manner, and extols the glory and
power of God. Why he does so we have already in some measure explained.
It is because we are so prone to distrust, that the very smallest
occasion makes us waver; and therefore the Prophet is constrained to
repeat the same thing in many ways, that he may keep our weak and
inconstant hearts in the exercise of confidence in God. Formerly he
spoke of the creation of the world, but now he comes to the continual
government of it; for God did not only for a single moment exert his
power for creating the world, but he manifests his power not less
efficaciously in preserving it. And this is worthy of observation; for
our minds would be little impressed by knowing that God is the creator
of the world, if his hand were not continually stretched out for
upholding it in existence. By the word *sitteth* the Prophet means, that
the earth does not remain firmly and permanently in its place any
further than as it is upheld by the power of God; for “sitting” is a
metaphorical term which denotes “government.”

<span id="ix.i-p185"></span>*The inhabitants of which are as locusts.*
By comparing the inhabitants of the earth to *locusts,* he reminds us
that God cannot be confined within such narrow boundaries, because “even
the heavens (<span id="ix.i-p185.1"></span>[1Ki
8:27](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#027)<span id="ix.i-p185.1"></span>.md) do
not contain him;” that we may learn, whenever we mention God, to
conceive nothing earthly or human as belonging to his incomprehensible
glory. Besides, this metaphor shews how ridiculous is the blindness of
men when they claim anything for themselves; for they gain by their
boastings just as much as if some small creatures, such as locusts,
would elevate themselves by leaping; but they must immediately fall back
on the earth.

<span id="ix.i-p186"></span>*Spreadeth it out as a tent.* David also
employs the same form of expression, (<span id="ix.i-p186.1"></span>[Ps
104:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#002)<span id="ix.i-p186.1"></span>,.md)
and both speak of the aspect and spreading out of the heavens with
respect to us; for they do not mean that God spreads out the heavens,
that he may dwell in them, but rather that there may be given to us a
place of habitation under them; for while the earth sustains, the
heavens cover us, so that we have a dwelling close and covered on all
sides.

<span id="ix.i-p187"></span>But it may be thought that these metaphors
detract greatly from the dignity of the subject of which the Prophet
discourses, while his object is to commend and exalt it to the utmost of
his power. What is a *curtain?* What is a *tent?* I reply, these
metaphors tend nevertheless to exalt the *subject;* for it is as if he
had said, “that it is as easy for God to spread out heaven, as for a man
to spread out a curtain.” And he leaves to every person to consider how
great is the difference between heaven and a curtain, and what is their
size, which any person may easily understand. Lastly, there is an
implied contrast between tabernacles or houses  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) which men are long, and laboriously,
and at great expense employed in building, and yet which hardly rise to
a hundred feet, and the immeasurable height of the heavens spread out by
an instantaneous act of the will of God, which makes abundantly manifest
how great and how excellent a workman he is.

<span id="ix.i-p189"></span><span id="ix.i-p189.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p190"></span>**23.** *He bringeth the mighty to nothing.*
He proceeds in extolling the providence of God, by which he governs the
whole world, but more especially mankind. Already and but a little ago
he had begun to remark that God did not create the world, so as
afterwards to allow it to be governed by chance, but that he undertakes
the preservation of it, and keeps it under his power and authority; but
as he deigns to look more closely at mankind, so the Prophet selects
this department, that by means of it he may extol God’s providence. The
sum of what he says is, that God’s government extends far and wide, so
that he directs and governs everything according to his pleasure; but he
shews, (what was also highly advantageous to be known,) that even in the
life of men striking proofs of the immediate exercise of the power of
God are visible, and, not even satisfied with the general doctrine, he
brings forward one class which ought still more to arouse our attention.

<span id="ix.i-p191"></span>*The governors of the earth as if they were
not.*  <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) Anything that happens to
the undistinguished mass of common people is despised and passed by as
unworthy of being observed; but when kingdoms and monarchies, or men of
high rank, fall from their elevation, it seems as if the earth had been
shaken; and the Prophet skilfully avails himself of such proofs to
arouse us. It might, indeed, be supposed that princes and magistrates
are exempted from the common lot, and are not subject to the ordinary
miseries of men; for by their splendor they dazzle the eyes and
understandings of all men. But their lustre is entirely dimmed; and
therefore the Prophet especially mentions them, and declares that the
Lord “bringeth them to nothing.” And if the hand of God is so powerful
against nobles and princes, what must we think of the common people?
Will he not also treat the ordinary crowd according to his pleasure, and
drive them wherever he thinks fit? Will he not either give or take away
from them, whenever he pleases, both strength and courage?

<span id="ix.i-p193"></span><span id="ix.i-p193.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p194"></span>**24.** *It is as if they had not been
planted.* Though the particle <span id="ix.i-p194.1"></span>אף (*aph*)
signifies *also,* yet in this passage it may be more appropriately
rendered “so that;” and thus the plain meaning will be, “So that you may
say that they were not planted or sown.” It is an amplification of what
he had formerly said, for he shews that the princes are totally
destroyed and rooted out, so that no trace of them is left, any more
than if they had never existed. So long as they remain in prosperity,
they appear to be so strong as to be beyond the possibility of being
thrown down by any adverse event.  <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) but such changes happen as blot out
their name and remembrance, so that you would say that they had never
existed; and we see that this has happened not only to men but even to
very flourishing kingdoms.

<span id="ix.i-p196"></span>Since, therefore, great downfalls are so
many tokens of God’s dreadful power, let us learn not to lean on earthly
and deceitful supports, but, whatever may be the amount of our riches or
strength, let us depend on him. God does not, as heathen men babble,
turn about this world like a ball, as if he took pleasure in this game;
but whenever any person is highly elevated, he never ceases from
insolent boasting till he is thrown down headlong, so that the judgments
of God are always manifest. We are also reminded by it, that it is wrong
to ascribe to fortune or to any other cause the various events that
happen; for God was not an instantaneous Creator, that would immediately
abandon the charge of his work, but incessantly applies his hand, so
that nothing is done but by his will and pleasure. Seeing that various
changes thus happen in the world, seeing that those things which were
thought to be firm and stable are transitory and fading, let us turn our
minds to that supreme providence of God.

<span id="ix.i-p197"></span>*Even while he bloweth on them.* Hence he
shows how light and trivial before God are those things which commonly
dazzle our eyes and fill us with amazement; for we cannot think of any
great king without being perfectly alarmed and stupified. But he shows
that kings and princes are like stubble before God, by whose breath they
are driven, as by a whirlwind, at any instant that he pleases. We are
therefore taught that we ought never to be overwhelmed by the sight of
any creature, so as not to render to God the honor and glory that are
due to him. This ought to have been carefully considered by the Jews,
who would have thought that that monarchy of the Babylonians, whose
captives they were, would never be destroyed, and that they could not be
rescued out of their hands, if they had not called to remembrance this
doctrine, that nothing in this world is so durable that it may not be
dissolved by the breath of God. That they may not despair of their
salvation, the Prophet reminds them that God, as soon as he shall be
pleased to thunder from heaven, will crush all that strength in their
enemies that terrifies them, so that it shall vanish away.

<span id="ix.i-p198"></span><span id="ix.i-p198.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p199"></span>**25.** *And to whom will ye liken me?* He
repeats the former statement, (<span id="ix.i-p199.1"></span>[Isa
40:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#018)<span id="ix.i-p199.1"></span>,.md)
by which he said that the Lord would not suffer himself to be likened to
idols; that the Jews might not in any degree detract, from his power, on
account of their having been so long held captive in the hand of
unbelievers, or think that idols are anything on account of the
prosperity of their worshippers, whom they were compelled to serve; for,
by reasoning in this manner about the power of the true God and of
idols, they would have compared him with idols. On this account he
repeats, as it were in indignation, “To whom will ye liken me?” as if he
had said, “Will you rob me of my majesty by your comparisons?” For
although men have various thoughts of God, and transform him according
to their fancy, yet he continues to be like himself, for he does not
change his nature on account of the inventions of men.

<span id="ix.i-p200"></span>*Saith the Holy One.* He appropriately
applies to God the term *Holy,* by which title he indirectly blames or
accuses the Jews of base ingratitude, if, as they have been set apart by
him, they do not sanctify him in return. No holiness will be found in
the gods of the Gentiles; they are the mere inventions of men. A
grievous injury therefore is done to God, and he is basely degraded from
his rank, when idols are brought into collision with him, and when it
becomes a subject of debate if they can do more than God himself.

<span id="ix.i-p201"></span><span id="ix.i-p201.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p202"></span>**26.** *Lift up your eyes on high.* The
Prophet appears to linger too long on this subject, more especially
because it presents no obscurity; for he repeats by many statements what
is acknowledged by all, that God’s wonderful power and wisdom may be
known from the beautiful order of the world. But we ought to observe
what I have already said, that we are so wicked and ungrateful judges of
the divine power, that we often imagine God to be inferior to some
feeble man. We are more terrified frequently by the empty mask of a
single man  <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) than we are
strengthened by all the promises of God. Not in vain, therefore, does
the Prophet repeat that God is defrauded of his honor, if his power do
not lead us to warm admiration of him; nor does he spend his labor in
what is superfluous, for we are so dull and sluggish that we need to be
continually aroused and excited.

<span id="ix.i-p204"></span>Men see every day the heavens and the stars;
but who is there that thinks about their Author? By nature men are
formed in such a manner as to make it evident that they were born to
contemplate the heavens, and thus to learn their Author; for while God
formed other animals to look downwards for pasture, he made man alone
erect, and bade him look at what may be regarded as his own habitation.

<span id="ix.i-p205"></span>This is also described beautifully by a
poet:  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) “While other animals look
downwards towards the earth, he gave to man a lofty face, and bade him
look at heaven, and lift up his countenance erect towards the stars.”
 <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) The Prophet therefore points
out the wickedness of men who do not acknowledge what is openly placed
before their eyes concerning God, but, like cattle, fix their snout in
the earth; for, whenever we raise our eyes upwards, with any degree of
attention, it is impossible for our senses not to be struck with the
majesty of God.

<span id="ix.i-p211"></span>*And see who hath created them.* By
mentioning the stars, he states more clearly that the wonderful order
which shines brightly in the face of the heavens preaches loudly that
there is one God and Creator of the world; and all who shall observe,
that amidst the vast number and variety of the stars, so regular an
order and course is so well maintained, will be constrained to make this
acknowledgment. For it is not by chance that each of the stars has had
its place assigned to it, nor is it at random that they advance
uniformly with so great rapidity, and amidst numerous windings move
straight forwards, so that they do not deviate a hairbreadth from the
path which God has marked out for them. Thus does their wonderful
arrangement shew that God is the Author and worker, so that men cannot
open their eyes without being constrained to behold the majesty of God
in his works.

<span id="ix.i-p212"></span>*Bringing out by number their army.* Under
the word *army* he, includes two things; their almost infinite number,
and their admirable arrangement; for a small number of persons do not
constitute an army, and not even a considerable number, if there be not
also numerous companies. Besides, it is not called an “army,” when men
are collected together at random, and without any selection, and in a
confused manner, or when they wander about in a disorderly state, but
where there are various classes of officers, who have the charge of ten,
or a hundred, or a thousand men,  <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) and where the ranks are drawn up and
arranged on a fixed plan. Thus the wonderful arrangement of the stars,
and their certain courses, may justly be called an “army.”

<span id="ix.i-p214"></span>By the word *number* he means that God
always has this “army” at his command. In an army the soldiers may
wander, and may not be immediately collected or brought back to their
ranks by the general, though the trumpet sound. But it is otherwise with
God. He always has his soldiers in readiness, and that “by number;” that
is, he keeps a reckoning of them, so that not one of them is absent.

<span id="ix.i-p215"></span>*He will call to all of them by name.* The
same expression occurs, (<span id="ix.i-p215.1"></span>[Ps
147:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#004)<span id="ix.i-p215.1"></span>,.md)
and in the same sense. Some explain it to mean that God knows the number
of the stars, which is unknown to us. But David and Isaiah meant a
different thing, that is, that God makes use of the stars according to
his pleasure; as if one should command a servant, calling him to him by
name; and the same thing will afterwards be said of Cyrus, whose labors
and service the Lord employed in delivering his people. (<span
id="ix.i-p215.2"></span>[Isa 45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md)<span
id="ix.i-p215.2"></span>.) In a word, it denotes the utmost submission
and obedience, when he who is called instantly answers to his name.

<span id="ix.i-p216"></span>*By the greatness of his strength.* Those
who explain the preceding clause to mean that the Lord knows the number
of the stars, are also mistaken in supposing that by giving them their
names is meant their power and office. Others explain it, that there is
not a star that has not its own power and energy, because the Lord gave
to them those qualities they would always possess. But others connect
these words with <span id="ix.i-p216.1"></span>יקרא, *(yikra,)* “he
shall call;” as if he had said, “The Lord is so powerful that all the
stars listen to his commands.” But a meaning which appears to me to be
more appropriate is, that God is so powerful, that, as soon as he has
issued an order, all the armies of the stars are ready to yield
obedience. In this we have an extraordinary proof of his power, when
those highly excellent, creatures unhesitatingly submit to him, and by
executing his orders testify that they acknowledge him to be their
Author.

<span id="ix.i-p217"></span>*Not one shall be wanting.* The word <span
id="ix.i-p217.1"></span>איש *(ish)* is applied by Hebrew writers not
only to men and women, but also to other animals, and even to inanimate
objects, as in a former passage, (<span id="ix.i-p217.2"></span>[Isa
34:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#016)<span id="ix.i-p217.2"></span>,.md)
when, speaking of the birds that should occupy those splendid abodes, he
said that “*not* *one* should be wanting,” he used the word <span
id="ix.i-p217.3"></span>איש*(ish).*  <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) These words commend to us the power of
God, that we may know that there is nothing in heaven or in earth that
does not depend on his will and pleasure. Nothing, therefore, can be
more shameful or unreasonable than to compare him to idols, which are as
worthless as anything can possibly be.  <span
id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md)

<span id="ix.i-p220"></span><span id="ix.i-p220.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p221"></span>**27.** *Why wilt thou say?* The Prophet now
expostulates either with the Jews, because they were almost overcome by
despair, and did not look to the promises of God, by which they ought,
to have supported their minds; or he makes provision for posterity, that
they may not sink under any distresses however long continued. The verbs
are in the future sense, which might also be explained by the
subjunctive mood, *Why wouldst thou say?* For Isaiah justly infers front
the preceding statement, that the chosen people, whatever may happen,
ought to wait patiently for God, till he give assistance in due time. He
argues from the less to the greater: “Since God keeps every part of the
world under his authority, it is impossible that he shall forsake his
Church.” Yet it is probable that at that time there were heard among the
people complaints, by which they murmured against God, as if he did not
care about their salvation, or were slow in rendering assistance, or
even shut his eyes and did not see their distresses. The fault which is
now corrected is, that they thought that God did not care about them; as
usually happens in afflictions, in which we think that God has forsaken
us, and exposed us for a prey, and that he takes no concern about the
affairs of this world.  <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md)

<span id="ix.i-p223"></span>*O Jacob and Israel!* By these names he
calls to their remembrance the Lord’s covenant, which had been ratified
by promises so numerous and so diversified; as if he had said, “Dost
thou not think that thou art that people which God hath chosen
peculiarly for himself? Why dost thou imagine that he who cannot deceive
does not attend to thy cause?”

<span id="ix.i-p224"></span>*My way is hidden from Jehovah.* He employs
the word *way* for “condition” and ‘cause,” and *hidden,* for
“disregarded” or “unknown;” for if God delay his assistance for a short
time, we think that his care does not extend to us. Some explain it
differently, that is, that the people are here reproved for thinking
that they would not be punished for sinning, and they think that this
sentiment resembles such as, “The wicked man hath said in his heart,
There is no God.” (<span id="ix.i-p224.1"></span>[Ps
14:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001)<span id="ix.i-p224.1"></span>..md)
But the Prophets meaning unquestionably was, “Thinkest thou, O Israel,
that the Lord taketh no concern about thine affairs?” For he exclaims
against the distrust of the people, and chides them sharply, that he may
afterwards comfort them, and may show that the Lord will continually
assist his people whom he hath undertaken to defend.

<span id="ix.i-p225"></span>*And my judgment passeth away from my God.*
The word *judgment* confirms our interpretation of the preceding clause;
for “judgment” is implored in affliction, when we are unjustly
oppressed, or when any one does us wrong; and God is said to favor and
undertake “judgment,” or “our right,” when, after having known our
cause, he defends and guards us; and he is said to *pass by it,* when he
overlooks us, and permits us to be devoured by our enemies. It is as if
he had said, that the Jews act unjustly in complaining that God has
disregarded their cause and forsaken them; and by that reproof he
prepares them for receiving consolation, for they could not receive it
while their minds were occupied with wicked or foolish thoughts. It was
therefore necessary first to remove obstructions, and to open up the way
for consolation.

<span id="ix.i-p226"></span><span id="ix.i-p226.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p227"></span>**28.** *Hast thou not known?* He repeats
the same statement which he had formerly made, that the people who had
been carefully taught in the school of God were inexcusable for their
slothfulness, and chides them sharply for not having profited more by
the doctrine of the Law, and by the other means which God had bestowed
in addition to that knowledge which they possessed in common with the
Gentiles. The word *know,* which is more general, is put first; because
by many miracles and other proofs God had manifested his glory. Next, he
asks, *Hast thou not heard?* As if he had said, “If thou hast profited
nothing by being taught by actions and by word that God is never
unemployed, it is evident that thou are excessively unteachable.”

<span id="ix.i-p228"></span>*That Jehovah is the God of eternity.* The
Prophet calls him “eternal,” and thus distinguishes him from all idols,
which endure but for a time, and were made by men; and truly, if this
were deeply seated in our hearts, there would no longer be any room for
distrust; for if God is eternal, he never changes or decays, eternity
being uniformly attended by this quality, that it is never liable to
change, but always remains the same. Since the Jews did not sufficiently
believe these things, though they had often “heard” them, the Prophet
intended to arouse them by this reproof, in order to shew that they will
be doubly guilty before God, if, after having been taught both by his
numerous benefits, and by the word, they do not render the honor and
glory which are due to him.

<span id="ix.i-p229"></span>*And is not wearied by weariness, and there
is no searching of his understanding.* Here the Prophet makes two
statements; first, that God is not wearied in doing good; and, secondly,
that no man can explore his wisdom. In the former clause he shews that,
nothing will hinder God from continuing to exercise his kindness; for he
is not like men whose resources are exhausted by giving frequently, or
who are wearied by continually bestowing new favors, or who repent of
their generosity. His kindness is never exhausted; if he was kind to the
fathers, he will be not less kind and bountiful to posterity. As to the
allegation, that God very often acts differently from what we think to
be best for us, the Prophet meets it by saying that his purpose is
incomprehensible, and warns us that we ought not to murmur, though he
does not all at once comply with our wishes; because nothing is better
adapted to cherish our hope than this sobriety, which leads us to
consider how marvellously God works in preserving us, and thus to submit
to his secret counsel.

<span id="ix.i-p230"></span><span id="ix.i-p230.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p231"></span>**29.** *He giveth power to the faint.* The
Prophet now applies to the present subject the general statements which
he made; for we have said that his intention was to give warmer
encouragement to the people, and to lead them to cherish better hope.
Because the Jews were at that time weakened and destitute of all
strength, he shews that on this account it belongs to God to give
assistance to those who were thus exhausted and weakened. He therefore
magnifies the power of God on this ground, that they may conclude and
believe that they ought not to doubt of their salvation so long as they
enjoy his favor. It was indeed to the people who were held captive in
Babylon that the Prophet looked; but we ought also to apply this
doctrine to ourselves, that whenever our strength shall fail, and we
shall be almost laid low, we may call to remembrance that the Lord
stretches out his hand ‘to the faint,” who are sinking through the want
of all help. But first, we must feel our faintness and poverty, that the
saying of Paul, “The power of God is made perfect in our weakness,”
(<span id="ix.i-p231.1"></span>[2Co
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)<span id="ix.i-p231.1"></span>,.md)
may be fulfilled; for if our hearts are not deeply moved by a conviction
of our weakness, we cannot receive seasonable assistance from God.

<span id="ix.i-p232"></span><span id="ix.i-p232.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p233"></span>**30.** *The youths are wearied and faint.*
By this comparison the Prophet illustrates more powerfully what he had
formerly said, that the strength which God imparts to his elect is
invincible and unwearied; for men’s strength easily fails, but God’s
strength never fails. It is indeed certain that all the vigor which
naturally dwells in us proceeds from God; but since men claim as their
own what God has bestowed generally on all, the Prophet thus
distinguishes between the strength of men which appears to be born with
them, and that strength by which God peculiarly supports his elect; for
God’s kindness, which is diffused throughout all nature, is not
sufficiently perceived. And thus by “men’s strength” he means that which
is generally possessed by mankind, and by “God’s assistance,” he means
that by which he peculiarly assists us after our strength has failed;
for the Prophet speaks of the grace of God which is cormmonly called
supernatural, and says that it is perpetual, while men can have nothing
in themselves but what is fading and transitory; that by this mark he
may distinguish between the Church of God and the rest of the world, and
between spiritual grace and earthly prosperity.

<span id="ix.i-p234"></span>*And the young men by falling fall.* In the
former clause he made use of the word <span
id="ix.i-p234.1"></span>נערים, *(negnarim,) youths,* but now he adds
<span id="ix.i-p234.2"></span>בחרים, *(bachurim,)* which means not only
that they were “young men,” but also that they had been selected.  <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) The repetition of the same statement
may be supposed to refer particularly to age, though he means that they
were persons of the choicest vigor and in the prime of life. With this
design he recommends that excellent privilege which God bestows on his
children in preference to other men; that they may be satisfied with
their lot, and may bear no envy to earthly men,  <span
id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) for that strength of which they boast.
In a word, he shews that men are greatly deceived if they are puffed up
by confidence in their own strength, for they immediately sink and
faint.

<span id="ix.i-p237"></span>He appears to allude to what happens every
day, that the stronger any person is, the more boldly does he attempt
what is exceedingly difficult, and the consequence is, that they who are
naturally more robust seldom live to be old men. They think nothing too
hard or difficult, they attempt everything, and rashly encounter all
dangers; but they give way in the middle of their course, and suffer the
punishment of their rashness. The same thing befalls those who are proud
of any gift which God has bestowed on them, and are full of confidence
in themselves; for all that they have received from God is reduced to
nothing, or rather turns to their ruin and destruction; and thus they
are justly punished for their insolence.

<span id="ix.i-p238"></span><span id="ix.i-p238.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p239"></span>**31.** *But they that wait for Jehovah.*
Hebrew writers employ the phrase, “exchanging strength,”  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) to denote “gathering new strength,”
and thus “being restored.” The Prophet therefore shews, that godly
persons, who shall hope in God, will not be deficient in strength; and
he confirms what he formerly said,

<span id="ix.i-p241"></span>“In rest and silence shall be your
strength.” (<span id="ix.i-p241.1"></span>[Isa
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015)<span id="ix.i-p241.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.i-p242"></span>We must not become agitated, or throw
ourselves forward rashly, but “wait” patiently. In this passage,
therefore, *waiting* means nothing else than patience. Violent men dash
themselves to pieces by their own eagerness, but the vigor of godly men,
though it has less display, and often appears to lie buried while they
calmly “wait for” God’s assistance, is refreshed and renewed. We must
therefore return to the saying of Paul, that

<span id="ix.i-p243"></span>“the power of God is made perfect in our
weakness.”  
(<span id="ix.i-p243.2"></span>[2Co
12:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#009)<span id="ix.i-p243.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.i-p244"></span>We must, therefore be fully convinced of our
weakness, that we may yield to the power of God. The Jews, who were
oppressed by that cruel captivity, had great need of this doctrine; but
for us also, during this wretchedly ruinous condition of the Church, it
is exceedingly needful.

<span id="ix.i-p245"></span>*They shall raise their wings as eagles.* It
is generally believed that the Prophet uses this phrase in the same
sense that the Psalmist says,

<span id="ix.i-p246"></span>“Thy youth shall be renewed like that of the
eagle.”  
(<span id="ix.i-p246.2"></span>[Ps
103:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#005)<span id="ix.i-p246.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.i-p247"></span>It is certain that the “eagle” is very
long-lived as compared with other birds.

<span id="ix.i-p248"></span>Aristotle and Pliny affirm that it never
dies of old age, but of hunger; that is, that when the upper part of the
beak becomes too large, it cannot take food into its mouth, and for a
long time subsists entirely on what it drinks. One Zaadias, as all Jews
are audacious in constructing fables, pretends that the eagle flies
upward into the region that is near the sun, and approaches the sun so
closely, that its old wings are burned, and other new ones grow in their
place; but this is utterly absurd and fabulous. The Prophet means that
they who trust in the Lord will be vigorous, like eagles, till the most
advanced old age. But seeing that eagles fly higher than other birds, by
which they shew remarkable swiftness, which has also given rise to the
proverb, “An eagle among the clouds,” this passage may be understood to
denote not only long life, but also strength and agility; so that
Isaiah, after having shewn that their strength is recruited, adds that
they are more vigorous, and ascend to a great height. Such is also the
import of what follows, —

<span id="ix.i-p249"></span>*They shall run and shall not be weary.* It
is as if he had said, that the Lord will assist them, so that they shall
pursue their course without any molestation. It is a figurative
expression, by which he intimates that believers  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) will always be ready to perform their
duty with cheerfulness. But it will be said, “There are so many troubles
which we must endure in this life; how then does he say that we shall be
exempt from weariness?” I reply, believers are indeed distressed and
wearied, but they are at length delivered from their distresses, and
feel that they have been restored by the power of God; for it happens to
them according to the saying of Paul,

<span id="ix.i-p251"></span>“While we are troubled on every side, we are
not overwhelmed; we are perplexed, but are not in despair; we suffer
persecution, but are not forsaken; we are cast down, but are not
destroyed.”  
(<span id="ix.i-p251.2"></span>[2 Cor.
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#009)<span id="ix.i-p251.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.i-p252"></span>Let us therefore learn to flee to the Lord,
who, after we have encountered many storms, will at length conduct us to
the harbor; for he who hath opened up a path, and hath commanded us to
advance in that course in which he hath placed us, does not intend to
assist us only for a single day, and to forsake us in the middle of our
course, (<span id="ix.i-p252.1"></span>[Php
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006)<span id="ix.i-p252.1"></span>,.md)
but will conduct us to the goal.
