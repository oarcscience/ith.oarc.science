<span id="xix-p2"></span>THE SUN-DIAL OF AHAZ.

<span id="xix-p3"></span>This is believed to be the earliest account of
a Sun-Dial that is anywhere to be found in history, and, on that
account, has arrested the attention of scholars little addicted to the
study of the Holy Scriptures. The form of it, which can now be nothing
else than a matter of ingenious conjecture, has been investigated with
uncommon industry, and illustrated with great profusion of learning.
Little aid can be obtained from the incidental notice of the sacred
historian, which our author has expounded with more than his usual
conciseness.

<span id="xix-p4"></span>A preliminary question relates to the Hebrew
word <span id="xix-p4.1"></span>מעלות, *(magnaloth,)* which, like the
Latin word *gradus,* literally means *steps,* but might naturally enough
mean *degrees.* It has been contended that βαθμοὺς the term used by
Josephus, is liable to a similar ambiguity, and may have been used by
him in its literal signification. Michaelis differed so widely from this
view, that he considered, <span id="xix-p4.2"></span>מעלה *(magnalah)*
to signify a *degree,* in the sense used by modern mathematicians, who
divide a circle into 360 degrees, so that 10 degrees (10°) would denote
the ninth part of a right angle; and he supports his opinion by shewing
that this use of the word *degree* did not take its rise among European
philosophers, but traveled from the East, and, like our ordinary
numerals, had an Arabic origin.

<span id="xix-p5"></span>Assuming that the word denotes *steps,* there
is still abundant room for diversity of interpretation. Some have
thought that there was a flight of steps leading to the royal palace of
Ahaz, on the top of which was placed a *gnomon,* (or obelisk,) and that
the *steps* served to measure the shadow of the sun which was thrown
upon them. Others refer it to an earlier period, when the sun-dial
consisted of a massive structure, towering into the sky like other
monuments of Oriental architecture, and built with scientific precision,
but unfitted by its cumbrous form to vie with the accuracy and elegance
of lighter instruments which belong to a more advanced age of science
The type of such buildings is naturally sought, not in Judea, where such
studies were never cultivated, but among the Egyptians, and especially
among the Babylonians, to whom the Greeks and other nations were
indebted for their knowledge of astronomy. Πόλον μὲν γὰρ γνώμονα καὶ τὰ
δυώδεκα μέρεα τὢς ἡμέρης, παρὰ Βαβυλωνίων ἔμαθον οἱ Ελληνες “For the
Greeks learned from the Babylonians the dial, and the gnomon, and the
division of the day into twelve (parts) hours.” (Herodotus Eut., 109.)
Nothing is more natural than to suppose that Ahaz directed some
architect to copy a celebrated building in Babylon, the general form of
which may be gathered from the description given by Bishop Stock,\*
whose version of the passage, and note, accompanied by a drawing, we
shall lay before our readers: —

<span id="xix-p6"></span>Behold, I turn the shadow of the degrees,  
By which the sun is gone down on the dial of Ahaz,\*\*  
Backward ten degrees.  
So the sun turned back ten degrees,  
On the dial, by which it had gone down.

<span id="xix-p7"></span>In what manner *the shadow was made to go
backward ten degrees* is a question totally distinct from the form of
the dial. That it was effected by a motion of the sun itself, or by a
change of the relative position of the earth to that luminary, though
this has been boldly stated and argued, is a notion too extravagant to
need refutation. There is plausibility in the view suggested by
Doederlein, that “the change of the shadow depended entirely on a cloud,
which intercepted, and in a manner altogether extraordinary refracted,
the rays of the sun, and thus made the shadow or the light to go back
ten degrees.” Rosenmuller relates, on the authority of another
commentator, an alteration of the shadow of a sun-dial, to the extent of
an hour and half, which was effected by the shadow of a cloud at Metz,
in the beginning of the eighteenth century. Without inquiring into the
historical evidence of such an occurrence, or entering into long and
intricate reasonings on the principles of optics, which would be
unsuitable to this place, we shall only remark, that the transaction was
undoubtedly miraculous; for it is declared to have been “a sign from
Jehovah.” In this respect, it is but one of innumerable miracles which
were performed by an Almighty hand in the sight of the Jewish people,
and which have been recorded in order to strengthen the faith, and aid
the devotion, of the worshippers of God in all ages, who delight to
“praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the
children of men.” — *Ed.*
