<span id="xi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 42.

<span id="xi.i"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p1"></span><span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>[Isaiah
42:1-25](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#001.md)<span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p2"></span>**1.** Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine
elect, *in* *whom* my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he
shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.

<span id="xi.i-p3"></span>**1.** Ecce servus meus, innitar illi, *(vel,
suffulciam ipsum)* electus meus, in quo sibi placuit anima mea. Posui
Spiritum meum super eum; judicium Gentibus proferet.

<span id="xi.i-p4"></span>**2.** He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor
cause his voice to be heard in the street.

<span id="xi.i-p5"></span>**2.** Non clamabit, neque attollet, neque
audire faciet in plateis vocem suam.

<span id="xi.i-p6"></span>**3.** A bruised reed shall he not break, and
the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto
truth.

<span id="xi.i-p7"></span>**3.** Arundinem quassatam non perfringet, nec
linum fumans extinguet; in veritate proferet judicium.

<span id="xi.i-p8"></span>**4.** He shall not fail nor be discouraged,
till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his
law.

<span id="xi.i-p9"></span>**4.** Non deficiet, neque frangetur, donec
ponat in terra judicium; et legem ejus insulae expectabunt.

<span id="xi.i-p10"></span>**5.** Thus saith God the LORD, he that
created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the
earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the
people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:

<span id="xi.i-p11"></span>**5.** Sic dicit Deus *(vel, potens)* Iehova,
creator coelorum, et expandens cos, dilatans terram, et germina ejus;
dans flatum populo in ea habitanti, et spiritum ambulantibus in ea.

<span id="xi.i-p12"></span>**6.** I the LORD have called thee in
righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give
thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;

<span id="xi.i-p13"></span>**6.** Ego Iehova vocavi to in justitia, et
tenebo to manu tua; custodiam to, et ponam in foedus populi, in lucem
Gentium;

<span id="xi.i-p14"></span>**7.** To open the blind eyes, to bring out
the prisoners from the prison, *and* them that sit in darkness out of
the prison house.

<span id="xi.i-p15"></span>**7.** Ut aperias oculos caecorum, ut educas
ex ergastulo vinctos, et e domo carceris sedentes in tenebris.

<span id="xi.i-p16"></span>**8.** I *am* the LORD; that *is my* name:
and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven
images.

<span id="xi.i-p17"></span>**8.** Ego Iehova; hoc nomen meum; et gloriam
meam alteri non dabo, nec laudem meam sculptilibus.

<span id="xi.i-p18"></span>**9.** Behold, the former things are come to
pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you
of them.

<span id="xi.i-p19"></span>**9.** Priora ecce venerunt, et nova ego
annuntio; antequam oriantur nota faciam vobis.

<span id="xi.i-p20"></span>**10.** Sing unto the LORD a new song, *and*
his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and
all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.

<span id="xi.i-p21"></span>**10.** Cantate Iehovae canticum novum,
laudem ejus ab extremo terrae; qui descenditis in mare, et plenitudo
ejus, insulae et incolae earurn.

<span id="xi.i-p22"></span>**11.** Let the wilderness and the cities
thereof lift up *their voice,* the villages *that* Kedar doth inhabit:
let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the
mountains.

<span id="xi.i-p23"></span>**11.** Exclament desertum et urbes ejus,
villae ubi habitat Kedar; cantent incolae petrae, et e vertice montium
jubilent.

<span id="xi.i-p24"></span>**12.** Let them give glory unto the LORD,
and declare his praise in the islands.

<span id="xi.i-p25"></span>**12.** Dent Iehovae gloriam, et laudem ejus
in insulis annuntient.

<span id="xi.i-p26"></span>**13.** The LORD shall go forth as a mighty
man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea,
roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.

<span id="xi.i-p27"></span>**13.** Iehova tanquam gigas egredietur, et
sicut praeliator zelum excitabit. Vociferabitur, jubilabit; super
inimicos suos roborabitur.

<span id="xi.i-p28"></span>**14.** I have long time holden my peace; I
have been still, *and* refrained myself: *now* will I cry like a
travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.

<span id="xi.i-p29"></span>**14.** Tacui a multo tempore, silui et
continui me; tanquam parturiens clamabo; vastabo, et deglutiam simul.

<span id="xi.i-p30"></span>**15.** I will make waste mountains and
hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands,
and I will dry up the pools.

<span id="xi.i-p31"></span>**15.** In solitudinem redigam montes et
coiles; omnem herbam eorum exsiccabo; ponam flumina in insulas, et
stagna exsiccabo.

<span id="xi.i-p32"></span>**16.** And I will bring the blind by a way
*that* they knew not; I will lead them in paths *that* they have not
known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things
straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.

<span id="xi.i-p33"></span>**16.** Et ducam caecos per viam quam
nesciebant; per semitas quas non noverant faciam cos ingredi; ponamque
tenebras eoram els in lucca, et obliqua in planum, Haec *(vel, Hoec
verba, vel, Has res)* faciam els, et non derelinquam eos.

<span id="xi.i-p34"></span>**17.** They shall be turned back, they shall
be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten
images, Ye *are* our gods.

<span id="xi.i-p35"></span>**17.** Agentur retrorsum, pudefient pudore
qui confidunt sculptill, et fusili dicunt, Vos dii nostri.

<span id="xi.i-p36"></span>**18.** Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind,
that ye may see.

<span id="xi.i-p37"></span>**18.** O surdi, audite, et caeci, intenti
estote ad videndum.

<span id="xi.i-p38"></span>**19.** Who *is* blind, but my servant? or
deaf, as my messenger *that* I sent? who *is* blind as *he that is*
perfect, and blind as the LORD’S servant?

<span id="xi.i-p39"></span>**19.** Quis caecus nisi servus meus? Quis
surdus sicut nuntius meus quem mitto? Quis caecus sicut perfectus, et
caecus nt servus Iehovae?

<span id="xi.i-p40"></span>**20.** Seeing many things, but thou
observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.

<span id="xi.i-p41"></span>**20.** Videndo multa quae non observas;
aperiendo aures, at non audiat.

<span id="xi.i-p42"></span>**21.** The LORD is well pleased for his
righteousness’ sake; he will magnify the law, and make *it* honourable.

<span id="xi.i-p43"></span>**21.** Iehova voluntarius propter justitiam
snare, ut magnificet legem ac extollat.

<span id="xi.i-p44"></span>**22.** But this *is* a people robbed and
spoiled; *they are* all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in
prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil,
and none saith, Restore.

<span id="xi.i-p45"></span>**22.** At hic populus direptus est ac
conculcatus; illaqueandi in carceribus omnes, et in speluncis
abscondentur. Erunt in direptionem, nec erit qui liberet; in praedam,
nee quisquam dicet, Redde.

<span id="xi.i-p46"></span>**23.** Who among you will give ear to this?
*who* will hearken and hear for the time to come?

<span id="xi.i-p47"></span>**23.** Quis in vobis auribus percipiet hoc?
Quis advertet? Quis attendet in postcrum?

<span id="xi.i-p48"></span>**24.** Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and
Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned?
for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his
law.

<span id="xi.i-p49"></span>**24.** Quis in praedam dedit Iacob, et
Israel exposuit direptoribus? Nonne Iehova? Eo quod peccaverimus in eum,
nec voluerunt ambulare in viis ejus, nec audierunt legem ejus.

<span id="xi.i-p50"></span>**25.** Therefore he hath poured upon him the
fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on
fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid *it*
not to heart.

<span id="xi.i-p51"></span>**25.** Itaque effudit super eum furorem irae
suae, et robur belli, Inflammavit eum undique, neque advertit; exarsit
in eum, neque posuit super cor.

<span id="xi.i-p52"></span> 

<span id="xi.i-p53"></span><span id="xi.i-p53.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p54"></span>**1.** *Behold my servant.* The Prophet
appears to break off abruptly to speak of Christ, but we ought to
remember what we mentioned formerly  <span
id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) in expounding another passage, (<span
id="xi.i-p55.2"></span>[Isa 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#014.md)<span
id="xi.i-p55.2"></span>,) that the prophets, when they promise anything
hard to be believed, are wont immediately afterwards to mention Christ;
for in him are ratified all the promises which would otherwise have been
doubtful and uncertain. “In Christ,” says Paul, “is Yea and Amen.”
(<span id="xi.i-p55.3"></span>[2Co
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020)<span id="xi.i-p55.3"></span>..md)
For what intercourse can we have with God, unless the Mediator come
between us? We undoubtedly are too far alienated from his majesty, and
therefore could not be partakers either of salvation or of any other
blessing, but through the kindness of Christ.

<span id="xi.i-p56"></span>Besides, when the Lord promised deliverance
to the Jews, he wished to raise their minds higher, that they might look
for greater and more valuable gifts than bodily freedom and a return to
Judea; for those blessings were only the foretaste of that redemption
which they at length obtained through Christ, and which we now enjoy.
The grace of God in the return of his people would indeed have been
imperfect, if he had not, at that time revealed himself as the perpetual
Redeemer of his Church. But, as we have already said, the end of the
captivity in Babylon included the full restoration of the Church; and
consequently we need not wonder if the prophets interweave that
commencement of grace with the reign of Christ, for that succession of
events is mentioned in ninny passages. We must therefore come to Christ,
without whom God cannot be reconciled to us; that is, unless we be
received into the number of God’s children by being ingrafted, into his
body. It will be evident from what follows, that the Prophet now speaks
of Christ as the First-born and the Head, for to no other person could
the following statements be applied, and the Evangelists place the
matter beyond all controversy. (<span id="xi.i-p56.1"></span>[Mt
12:17-21](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#017.md)<span
id="xi.i-p56.1"></span>.)

<span id="xi.i-p57"></span>He calls Christ his *Servant,* (<span
id="xi.i-p57.1"></span>κατ ἐξοχήν,) by way of eminence; for this name
belongs to all the godly, because God has adopted them on the condition
of directing themselves and their whole life to obedience to him; and
godly teachers, and those who hold a public office in the Church, are in
a peculiar manner denominated the servants of God. But there is
something still more extraordinary, on account of which this name
belongs especially to Christ, for he is called a “Servant,” because God
the Father not only enjoined him to teach or to do some particular
thing, but called him to a singular and incomparable work which has
nothing in common with other works.

<span id="xi.i-p58"></span>Though this name is ascribed to the person,
yet it belongs to human nature; for since his divine nature is eternal,
and since he has always possessed in it a glory equal and perfectly
similar to that of the Father, it was necessary that he should assume
flesh in order that he might submit to obedience. Hence also Paul says,

<span id="xi.i-p59"></span>“Though he was in the form of God, he
accounted it not robbery to make himself equal to God, but emptied
himself, taking the form of a servant,” etc. (<span
id="xi.i-p59.1"></span>[Php 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md)<span
id="xi.i-p59.1"></span>.)

<span id="xi.i-p60"></span>That he was a servant was a voluntary act, so
that we must not think that it detracted anything from his rank. The
ancient writers of the Church expressed this by the word “Dispensation,”
by which it was brought about, they tell us, that he was subject to all
our infirmities. It was by a voluntary determination that he subjected
himself to God, and subjected himself in such a manner as to become also
of service to us; and yet that exceedingly low condition does not hinder
him from still continuing to possess supreme majesty. Hence also the
Apostle says that he was “exalted above every name.” (<span
id="xi.i-p60.1"></span>[Php 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md)<span
id="xi.i-p60.1"></span>.) he employs the demonstrative particle
*Behold,* in order to lead the Jews to regard the event as having
actually taken place; for the objects which were before their eyes might
have led them to despair, and therefore he bids them turn away their
eyes from the actual condition of things and look to Christ.

<span id="xi.i-p61"></span>*I will lean upon, him,* or, *I* *will uphold
him.*  <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) <span
id="xi.i-p62.1"></span>אתמך *(ethmoch)* is interpreted by some in an
active, and by others in a passive sense. If it be taken in a passive
sense, the meaning will be, that God will “lean on” his Anointed in such
a manner as to lay the whole charge upon him, as masters commonly do to
their faithful servants; and it is a proof of extraordinary fidelity,
that God the Father will deliver all things to him, and will put into
his hand his own power and authority. (<span
id="xi.i-p62.2"></span>[John 13:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh013.htm#003.md),
[John 17:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#010.md)<span
id="xi.i-p62.2"></span>.) Yet I do not object to the active
signification, “I will raise him up,” or, “I will exalt him,” or, “I
will support him in his rank;” for what immediately follows, *I will put
my Spirit in him,* is a repetition of the same sentiment. In the former
clause, therefore, he says, *I will uphold him,* and afterwards
describes the manner of “upholding,” that he will direct him by his
Spirit, meaning by this phrase that he will assist Christ in all things,
and will not permit him to be overcome by any difficulties. Now, it was
necessary that Christ should he endued with the Spirit of God, in order
to execute that divine office, and be the Mediator between God and men;
for so great a work could not be performed by human power.

<span id="xi.i-p63"></span>*My elect.* In this passage the word *Elect*
denotes “excellent,” as in many other passages; for they who are in the
very flower of their age are called chosen youths. (<span
id="xi.i-p63.1"></span>[1Sa 26:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa1026.htm#002.md)<span
id="xi.i-p63.1"></span>, and <span id="xi.i-p63.2"></span>[2Sa
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#001)<span id="xi.i-p63.2"></span>..md)
Jehovah therefore calls him “an excellent servant,” because he bears the
message of reconciliation, and because all his actions are directed by
God. At the same time he demonstrates his undeserved love, by which he
embraced us all in his only-begotten Son, that in his person we may
behold an illustrious display of that election by which we have been
adopted into the hope of eternal life. Now, since heavenly power dwells
in the human nature of Christ, when we hear him speak, let us not look
at flesh and blood, but raise our minds higher, so as to know that all
that he does is divine.

<span id="xi.i-p64"></span>*In whom my soul is well pleased.* From this
passage we learn that Christ is not only beloved by the Father, (<span
id="xi.i-p64.1"></span>[Mt 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md)<span
id="xi.i-p64.1"></span>,) but is alone beloved and accepted by him, so
that there is no way of obtaining favor from God but through the
intercession of Christ. In this sense the Evangelists quote this
passage, (<span id="xi.i-p64.2"></span>[Mt
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#018)<span id="xi.i-p64.2"></span>,.md)
as Paul also declares that we are reconciled “in the beloved” in such a
manner as to be beloved on his account. (<span
id="xi.i-p64.3"></span>[Eph 1:6](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#006.md)<span
id="xi.i-p64.3"></span>.) The Prophet afterwards shews that Christ will
be endued with the power of the Spirit, not solely on his own account,
but in order to spread it far and wide.

<span id="xi.i-p65"></span>*He will exhibit judgment to the Gentiles.*
By the word *judgment* the Prophet means a well-regulated government,
and not a sentence which is pronounced by a judge on the bench; for to
*judge* means, among the Hebrew writers, “to command, to rule, to
govern,” and he adds that this judgment will be not only in Judea, but
throughout the whole world. This promise was exceedingly new and
strange; for it was only in Judea that God was known, (<span
id="xi.i-p65.1"></span>[Ps 76:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002.md)<span
id="xi.i-p65.1"></span>,) and the Gentiles were shut out from all
confidence in his favor. (<span id="xi.i-p65.2"></span>[Eph
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#012)<span id="xi.i-p65.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.i-p66"></span>These clear proofs were therefore exceedingly
needful for us, that we might be certain of our calling; for otherwise
we might think that these promises did not at all belong to us. Christ
was sent in order to bring the whole world under the authority of God
and obedience to him; and this shows that without him everything is
confused and disordered. Before he comes to us, there can be no proper
government amongst us; and therefore we must learn to submit to him, if
we desire to be well and justly governed. Now, we ought to judge of this
government from the nature of his kingdom, which is not external, but
belongs to the inner man; for it consists of a good conscience and
uprightness of life, not what is so reckoned before men, but what is so
reckoned before God. The doctrine may be thus summed up: “Because the
whole life of men has been perverted since we were corrupted in every
respect by the fall of Adam, Christ came with the heavenly power of his
Spirit, that he might change our disposition, and thus form us again to
‘newness of life.’” (<span id="xi.i-p66.1"></span>[Ro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)<span id="xi.i-p66.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.i-p67"></span><span id="xi.i-p67.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p68"></span>**2.** *He shall not cry aloud.* The Prophet
shews of what nature the coming of Christ will be; that is, without pomp
or splendor, such as commonly attends earthly kings, at whose arrival
there are uttered various noises and loud cries, as if heaven and earth
were about to mingle. But Isaiah says that Christ will come without any
noise or cry; and that not only for the sake of applauding his modesty,
but, first, that we may not form any earthly conception of him;
secondly, that, having known his kindness by which he draws us to him,
we may cheerfully hasten to meet him; and, lastly, that our faith may
not languish, though his condition be mean and despicable.

<span id="xi.i-p69"></span>*He shall not lift up his voice;* that is, he
shall create no disturbance; as we commonly say of a quiet and peaceable
man, “He makes no great noise.”  <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md)
And indeed he did not boast of himself to the people, but frequently
forbade them to publish his miracles, that all might learn that his
power and authority was widely different from that which kings or
princes obtain, by causing themselves to be loudly spoken of in order to
gain the applause of the multitude. (<span id="xi.i-p70.2"></span>[Matt.
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#004.md), [Matt.
9:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#030.md), [Matt.
12:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#016.md)<span id="xi.i-p70.2"></span>;
<span id="xi.i-p70.3"></span>[Mr
5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#043.md)<span id="xi.i-p70.3"></span>;
<span id="xi.i-p70.4"></span>[Lu
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#056)<span id="xi.i-p70.4"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.i-p71"></span><span id="xi.i-p71.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p72"></span>**3.** *A bruised reed he shall not break.*
After having declared in general that Christ will be unlike earthly
princes, he next mentions his mildness in this respect, that he will
support the weak and feeble. This is what he means by the metaphor of
“the bruised reed,” that he does not wish to break off and altogether
crush those who are half-broken, but, on the contrary, to lift up and
support them, so as to maintain and strengthen all that is good in them.

<span id="xi.i-p73"></span>*Nor will he quench the smoking flax.* This
metaphor is of the same import with the former, and is borrowed from the
wicks of lamps, which may displease us by not burning clearly or by
giving out smoke, and yet we do not extinguish but trim and brighten
them. Isaiah ascribes to Christ that forbearance by which he bears with
our weakness, which we find to be actually fulfilled by him; for
wherever any spark of piety is seen, he strengthens and kindles it, and
if he were to act towards us with the utmost rigor, we should be reduced
to nothing. Although men therefore totter and stumble, although they are
even shaken or out of joint, yet he does not at once cast them off as
utterly useless, but bears long, till he makes them stronger and more
steadfast.

<span id="xi.i-p74"></span>God gave a manifestation of this meekness
when he appointed Christ to begin the discharge of his office as
ambassador; for the Holy Spirit was sent from heaven in the shape of a
dove, which was a token of nothing but mildness and gentleness. (<span
id="xi.i-p74.1"></span>[Mt 3:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#016.md)<span
id="xi.i-p74.1"></span>; <span id="xi.i-p74.2"></span>[Mr
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#010.md)<span id="xi.i-p74.2"></span>;
<span id="xi.i-p74.3"></span>[Lu
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#022.md)<span id="xi.i-p74.3"></span>;
<span id="xi.i-p74.4"></span>[Joh
1:32](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#032)<span id="xi.i-p74.4"></span>..md)
And indeed the sign perfectly agrees with the reality; for he makes no
great noise, and does not render himself an object of terror, as earthly
kings commonly do, and does not wish to harass or oppress his people
beyond measure, but, on the contrary, to soothe and comfort them. Not
only did he act in this manner when he was manifested to the world, but
this is what he daily shows himself to be by the gospel. Following this
example, the ministers of the gospel, who are his deputies, ought to
shew themselves to be meek, and to support the weak, and gently to lead
them in the way, so as not to extinguish in them the feeblest sparks of
piety, but, on the contrary, to kindle them with all their might. But
that we may not suppose that this meekness holds out encouragement to
vices and corruptions, he adds —

<span id="xi.i-p75"></span>*He shall bring forth judgment in truth.*
Although Christ soothes and upholds the weak, yet he is very far from
using the flatteries which encourage vices; and therefore we ought to
correct vices without flattery, which is in the highest degree
inconsistent with that meekness. We ought therefore to guard diligently
against extremes; that is, we must neither crush the minds of the weak
by excessive severity, nor encourage by our smooth language anything
that is evil.

<span id="xi.i-p76"></span>That we may better understand who those
persons are towards whom, following the example of Christ, we ought to
exercise this mildness, we ought to weigh carefully the Prophet’s words.
He calls them “a bruised reed” and “smoking wick.” These words do not
apply to those who boldly and obstinately resist, nor to those who are
fierce and headstrong; for such persons do not deserve this forbearance,
but rather must be broken and crushed, as by the strokes of a hammer, by
the severity of the word. While he praises meekness, he at the same time
shews to whom it is adapted, and at what time and in what manner it
ought to be employed; for it is not suitable to hardened and rebellious
persons, or to those whose rage sends forth flames, but to those who are
submissive, and who cheerfully yield to the yoke of Christ.

<span id="xi.i-p77"></span>The word *smoking* shews that he maintains
and cherishes not darkness, but sparks, though feeble and hardly
perceptible. Wherever then there is impiety and stubbornness, there we
must act with the utmost severity, and exercise no forbearance; but, on
the other hand, where there are vices that have not gone beyond
endurance, yet by gentleness of this nature, instead of encouraging, we
must correct and reform them; for we must always pay regard chiefly *to
truth,* of which he speaks, that vices may not be concealed, and thus
acquire a secret corruption, but that the weak may be gradually trained
to sincerity and uprightness. These words, therefore, relate to those
persons who, amidst many deficiencies, have integrity of mind, and
earnestly desire to follow true religion, or, at least, in whom we see
some good beginning. It is clearly shewn by many passages (<span
id="xi.i-p77.1"></span>[Matt. 12:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#039.md),
[Matt. 22:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#018.md), [Matt.
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013)<span id="xi.i-p77.1"></span>.md)
how severely Christ deals with despisers; for he is constrained to
employ “a rod of iron” to crush those who do not submit to be governed
by his shepherd’s crook. As he justly declares that “his yoke is easy,
and his burden is light,” (<span id="xi.i-p77.2"></span>[Mt
11:30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030)<span id="xi.i-p77.2"></span>,.md)
to willing disciples, so with good reason does David arm him with “a
scepter of iron” (<span id="xi.i-p77.3"></span>[Ps
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009)<span id="xi.i-p77.3"></span>.md) to
break his enemies in pieces, and declare that he will be wet with their
blood. (<span id="xi.i-p77.4"></span>[Ps.
110:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#007)<span id="xi.i-p77.4"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.i-p78"></span><span id="xi.i-p78.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p79"></span>**4.** *He shall not faint, nor be
discouraged.* The Prophet alludes to the preceding verse, and confirms
what he formerly said, that Christ will indeed be mild and gentle
towards the weak, but that he will have no softness or effeminacy; for
he will manfully execute the commission which he has received from the
Father. This is what he means when he says that “he shall not faint;”
and in this verb <span id="xi.i-p79.1"></span>יכהה *(yichheh)* there is
an allusion to a former verse, in which he spoke of “smoking flax.” Now,
he shews what is the true moderation of meekness, not to turn aside to
excessive indulgence; for we ought to use it in such a manner as not to
swerve from our duty. Many persons wish to profit by the name of
gentleness, so as to gain the applause and esteem of the world, but at
the same time betray truth in a base and shameful manner.

<span id="xi.i-p80"></span>I remember that there were in a populous city
two preachers, one of whom boldly and loudly reproved vices, while the
other endeavored to gain the favor of the people by flatteries. This
fawning preacher, who was expounding the Prophet Jeremiah, lighted on a
passage full of the mildest consolation, and having found, as he
imagined, a fit opportunity, began to declaim against those harsh and
severe reprovers who are wont to terrify men by thunderbolts of words.
But on the following day, when the Prophet changed his subject and
sharply rebuked wicked men with his peculiar vehemence of style, the
wretched flatterer was constrained to encounter bitter scorn by
retracting the words which were fresh in the recollection of all his
hearers. Thus the temporary favor which he had gained speedily vanished,
when he revealed his own disposition, and made himself abhorred by the
good and the bad.

<span id="xi.i-p81"></span>We must therefore distinguish between the
submissive and the obstinate, that we may not abuse that mildness by
using it on every occasion. Yet Isaiah declares that Christ’s fortitude
will be unshaken, so that it shall surmount every obstacle; for by these
words, *Till he put judgment,* he means that the ministry of Christ will
be so efficacious that the fruit of his doctrine shall be manifested. He
does not merely say, “Till he shall have made known the will of his
Father,” but “Till he establish *judgment,”* that is, as we formerly
said, the proper exercise of government. Christ’s ministry, therefore,
he testifies, will not be unfruitful, but will have such efficacy that
men shall be reformed by it.

<span id="xi.i-p82"></span>This must not be limited to the person of
Christ, but extends to the whole course of the gospel; for he not only
discharged the embassy committed to him for three years, but continues
to discharge the same embassy every day by means of his servants. Yet we
are reminded that it is impossible for us to discharge that office
without being laid under the necessity of suffering many annoyances, and
sustaining contests so severe and dangerous, that we shall be almost
overwhelmed and ready to abandon everything. Still we must not desist,
but persevere constantly in our duty, and run to the very end; and
therefore the Prophet testifies that Christ will be so steadfast that he
will pursue his calling to the end; and, following his example, we ought
boldly to persevere.

<span id="xi.i-p83"></span>*And the isles shall wait for his law.* Here
he employs the word *Law* to mean “doctrine,” as the Hebrew word for
“law” is derived from a verb which signifies to teach;  <span
id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) and thus the prophets are accustomed
to speak of the gospel, in order to shew that it will not be new or
contrary to what was taught by Moses.

<span id="xi.i-p85"></span>*The isles.* We have formerly shewn that the
Hebrew writers give the name of *isles* to countries beyond the sea.

<span id="xi.i-p86"></span>The Prophet confirms the former statement, by
which it was declared that Christ had been appointed not only for the
Jews, but also for the Gentiles, though they had nothing in common with
the Jewish commonwealth. In short, that promise relates to all nations,
that the advantages of this restoration and reformation may be shared by
every part of the world.

<span id="xi.i-p87"></span>By the word *wait,* he means that the elect
will eagerly embrace the gospel offered to them; for the Lord displays
in it the power of his election, when “they who wandered in darkness,”
(<span id="xi.i-p87.1"></span>[Mt
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016)<span id="xi.i-p87.1"></span>,.md) as
soon as they hear the voice of the gospel, embrace it with the utmost
eagerness, and although they formerly wandered, like scattered and lost
sheep, yet hear immediately the voice of the shepherd, and cheerfully
submit to him, as Christ himself has also spoken. (<span
id="xi.i-p87.2"></span>[Joh 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#016.md)<span
id="xi.i-p87.2"></span>.) Hence we learn that the saying of Augustine is
exceedingly true, “that many sheep wander out of the folds, while wolves
frequently dwell within the folds.” This attention is the work of God,
when men who thought that they were wise give up their own judgment, and
have to learn the gospel of Christ, so as to depend entirely on this
teacher.

<span id="xi.i-p88"></span><span id="xi.i-p88.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p89"></span>**5.** *Thus saith Jehovah.* He confirms what
he said in the beginning of the chapter about the reign of Christ, that
he will renew and restore all things; and as this might be thought to be
incredible, he has here added a magnificent description of the power of
God, by which our faith ought to be confirmed, especially when the
outward aspect of things is directly contrary. On this account he brings
forward clear proofs of the power of God, that all may be aroused by the
mention of them, and may be convinced that he who created all things out
of nothing, who spread out the heavens, who produced vegetation, who
gave life to animals, and who upholds and defends all things by his
power, will easily perform what he promises concerning the reign of
Christ. These forms of expression remind us that we ought always to
consider the power of God, that we may be fully convinced of the
authority and undoubted certainty of his word; for it is not without
reason that Isaiah makes this preface, but in order to remove every
doubt, because nothing is too hard for God, who keeps the whole world in
subjection to his authority; and in the following chapters he will
employ similar modes of expression.

<span id="xi.i-p90"></span><span id="xi.i-p90.1"></span>האל (*hael*) is
rendered by some “powerful,” and by others “God;” but it is of little
consequence, for the meaning is the same; because he exhibits his power
and majesty, and adorns him with this variety of titles, that we may
know that he will easily restore all that is fallen and laid low.

<span id="xi.i-p91"></span><span id="xi.i-p91.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p92"></span>**6.** *I Jehovah have called thee in
righteousness.* He again repeats the name of God, in which we ought to
supply what he stated in the former verse about his power. It is
generally thought that this points out the end of Christ’s calling, that
he was sent by the Father to establish “justice” among men, who are
destitute of it so long as they have not Christ, and, being given up to
all the corruptions of crimes and vices, are held captive under the
tyranny of Satan. But because the word “righteousness” has a more
extensive signification, I pass by that ingenious distinction; for it is
not even said that he shall be called “to righteousness,” but this
phraseology ought to be viewed as equivalent to the adverbial
expression, “righteously,” or “in a holy manner.” I rather suppose the
meaning to be, that Christ was “called in righteousness,” because his
calling is lawful, and therefore shall be firm and secure. We know that
what is not done in a proper and regular manner cannot be of long
duration. Or perhaps it will be thought preferable to view it thus, that
God, in appointing Christ to restore the Church, seeks no reason but
from himself and his own righteousness; but it is certain that this word
denotes stability, as if he had said, “faithfully.”

<span id="xi.i-p93"></span>*And will hold thee by thy hand.* By “the
holding of the hand” he means the immediate assistance of God; as if he
had said, “I will direct and establish thee in the calling to which I
have appointed thee. In a word, as thy calling is righteous, so I will
defend and uphold thee, as if by taking hold of thy hand I were thy
leader.”

<span id="xi.i-p94"></span>*I will keep thee.* This word “keep” plainly
shews what is the meaning of holding by the hand, namely, that Christ
will be directed by the Father in such a manner that he shall have him
as his protector and guardian, shall enjoy his assistance, and, in
short, shall feel his presence in all things.

<span id="xi.i-p95"></span>*And will place thee for a covenant.* He now
states the reason why God promises that he will be a guardian to Christ.
Besides, the Prophet spoke of the Jews and the Gentiles separately; not
that they differ by nature, or that the one is more excellent than the
other, (for all need the grace of God, (<span id="xi.i-p95.1"></span>[Ro
3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023)<span id="xi.i-p95.1"></span>,.md)
and Christ has brought salvation to all indiscriminately,) but because
the Lord assigned the first rank to the Jews, (<span
id="xi.i-p95.2"></span>[Mt 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#006.md)<span
id="xi.i-p95.2"></span>,) it was therefore proper that they should be
distinguished from the others. Accordingly, before “the partition-wall”
(<span id="xi.i-p95.3"></span>[Eph
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014)<span id="xi.i-p95.3"></span>.md) was
thrown down, they excelled, not by their merit, but by the favor of God,
because with them in the first instance the covenant of grace was made.

<span id="xi.i-p96"></span>It may be objected, “Why is Christ appointed
to a covenant which was ratified long before? for, more than two
thousand years before, God had adopted Abraham, and thus the origin of
the distinction was long previous to the coming of Christ.” I reply, the
covenant which was made with Abraham and his posterity had its
foundation in Christ; for the words of the covenant are these, “In thy
seed shall all nations be blessed.” (<span id="xi.i-p96.1"></span>[Ge
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#018)<span id="xi.i-p96.1"></span>..md)
And the covenant was ratified in no other manner than in the seed of
Abraham, that is, in Christ, by whose coming, though it had been
previously made, it was confirmed and actually sanctioned. Hence also
Paul says, “that the promises of God are yea and amen in Christ,” (<span
id="xi.i-p96.2"></span>[2Co 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020.md)<span
id="xi.i-p96.2"></span>,) and in another passage calls Christ “the
minister of circumcision, to fulfill the promises which were given to
the fathers.” (<span id="xi.i-p96.3"></span>[Ro
15:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#008)<span id="xi.i-p96.3"></span>..md)
Still more clearly does he declare that Christ is “the peace” of all, so
that they who were formerly separated are united in him, and both they
who were far off and they who were near are thus reconciled to God.
(<span id="xi.i-p96.4"></span>[Eph
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#017)<span id="xi.i-p96.4"></span>..md)
Hence also it is evident that Christ was promised, not only to the Jews,
but to the whole world.

<span id="xi.i-p97"></span>*For a light of the Gentiles.* We have here
another clear proof of the calling of the Gentiles, since he expressly
states that Christ was appointed to be “a light” to them. He calls him
*a light,* because the Gentiles were plunged in the deepest and thickest
darkness, at the time when the Lord illuminated none but the Jews. Now,
then, the blame lies solely with ourselves, if we do not become
partakers of this salvation; for he calls all men to himself, without a
single exception, and gives Christ to all, that we may be illuminated by
him. Let us only open our eyes, he alone will dispel the darkness, and
illuminate our minds by the “light” of truth.

<span id="xi.i-p98"></span><span id="xi.i-p98.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p99"></span>**7.** *That thou mayest open the eyes of the
blind.* Here he explains more fully for what end Christ shall be sent by
the Father, that we may see more clearly what advantage he yields us,
and how much we need his assistance. He reminds all men of their
“blindness,” that they may acknowledge it, if they wish to be
illuminated by Christ. In short, under these metaphors he declares what
is the condition of men, till Christ shine upon them as their Redeemer;
that is, that they are most wretched, empty, and destitute of all
blessings, and surrounded and overwhelmed by innumerable distresses,
till they are delivered by Christ.

<span id="xi.i-p100"></span>Now, though the Prophet addresses Christ
himself, yet he has in his eye believers, that they may know that in him
they ought to trust, and may not doubt that a remedy will be provided
for all their distresses, if they implore his aid. God does not here
enjoin Christ what he shall do, as if he needed to be taught or to
receive commandments; but he addresses him for our sake, that we may
know why the Father sent him; as he says also, (<span
id="xi.i-p100.1"></span>[Ps. 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#008)<span id="xi.i-p100.1"></span>,.md) “I
will make known the decree; ask of me, I will give thee the Gentiles;”
for in that passage the rank and authority of Christ are declared, that
we may know that the Father has bestowed on him the highest authority,
in order that we may more securely place all our hope and confidence in
him.

<span id="xi.i-p101"></span><span id="xi.i-p101.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p102"></span>**8.** *I am Jehovah.* Hence infer what is
the nature and extent of the disease of unbelief, since the Lord can
hardly satisfy himself with any words to express the cure of it. By
nature we are prone to distrust, and do not believe God when he speaks,
till he entirely subdue our stubbornness. Besides, we continually fall
back into the same fault through our levity, unless he employ many
bridles to restrain us. Again, therefore, he returns to that
confirmation of which we have spoken formerly, that his promises may
remain unshaken.

<span id="xi.i-p103"></span>*This is my name.* <span
id="xi.i-p103.1"></span>הוא (*hu*) is sometimes taken for a substantive,
so as to be a proper name of God;  <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) but I explain it in a more simple
manner, *“It* is my name,” that is, *“Jehovah* is my own name, and
cannot lawfully be given to any other.” In a word, by this expression he
seals all that was said about the office of Christ, and adds as it were
a seal to the promise: “He who declareth these things testifieth that he
alone is God, and that this name dwelleth in him alone.”

<span id="xi.i-p105"></span>*And I will not give my glory to another;*
that is, “I will not suffer my glory to be diminished, which it would
be, if I were found to be false or fickle in my promises.” He therefore
declares that he will abide by his promises, because he wishes to
vindicate his glory and preserve it entire, that it may not be in any
respect diminished.

<span id="xi.i-p106"></span>This is a remarkable passage, by which we
are taught that the glory of God is chiefly visible in his fulfillment
of what he has promised. And hence we obtain a singular confirmation of
our faith, that the Lord never deceives, never swerves from his
promises, and nothing can hinder what he has once determined. But since
Satan, by amazing arts, endeavors to obscure this glory of God, and to
bestow it on men and on false gods, he therefore testifies that he will
not permit himself to be regarded as fickle or deceitful in his
promises.

<span id="xi.i-p107"></span>*Nor my praise to graven images.* A contrast
is drawn between the only God and idols with reference to time; for, had
not God been the Redeemer of his people, unbelievers would have boasted
as if true religion had been false and useless. God therefore declares
that he will not permit wicked men to triumph by oppressing the Church;
and, beyond all doubt, God has hitherto spared us, and still deals so
gently with us, in order that he may not expose his Gospel to the
blasphemous reproaches of the Papists. We ought to draw from this a
universal doctrine, namely, that the Lord wishes that his glory may
remain unimpaired; for he defends and maintains it everywhere with the
utmost zeal, in order to shew that he is exceedingly jealous of it,
(<span id="xi.i-p107.1"></span>[Ex
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005)<span id="xi.i-p107.1"></span>,.md)
and does not permit the smallest part of it to be given to another.

<span id="xi.i-p108"></span><span id="xi.i-p108.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p109"></span>**9.** *The former things.* He now recalls
to remembrance the former predictions, by the fulfillment of which he
shews that confidence ought to be placed in him for the future; for what
we have known by actual experience ought to tend greatly to confirm our
belief. It is as if he had said, “I have spoken so frequently to your
fathers, and you have found me to be true in all things; and yet you
cannot place confidence in me about future events: the experience of
past transactions produces no effect upon you, and does not excite you
to do better.” God’s favors, therefore, ought to be mentioned by us in
such a manner that, whenever our salvation lies concealed in hope, we
may rest on the word of God, and be confirmed by it during the whole
course of our life.

<span id="xi.i-p110"></span>*Behold! they came.*  <span
id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) By the adverb *behold,* he points out,
as with the finger, that they had learned by experience, that God is not
false, and did not; speak in vain by the prophets; because clear proofs
openly testified and proclaimed the truth of God.

<span id="xi.i-p112"></span>*Before they spring forth.*  <span
id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) He distinguishes God from idols by
this mark, that he alone knows and predicts future events, but idols do
not; know them. As to the greater part of the responses which were given
by the gods of the Gentiles, we have formerly seen that they were either
false or ambiguous; for they who relied on them were often shamefully
deceived, and this is the reward which they richly deserved. And if at
first sight the event corresponded, this plunged them deeper in eternal
perdition; and by the righteous judgment of God it was brought about
that Satan imposed upon them by such delusions. Far otherwise was it
with the sacred oracles, by which the Church, for her own advantage and
salvation, was at one time brought to repentance, and at another time
encouraged to entertain favorable hope, that she might not sink under
the burden of punishments. It remains a settled principle, that all that
God has foretold is verified by the event; for he rules and directs all
things by his providence.

<span id="xi.i-p114"></span><span id="xi.i-p114.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p115"></span>**10.** *Sing to Jehovah.* He now exhorts
the people to gratitude; for God’s favors ought always to excite us, by
the remembrance of them, to give thanks and to celebrate his praises.
Besides, by that exhortation he calls believers to behold the prophecy
as actually accomplished, and confirms those promises of which he spoke.
We ought to observe this as the design of the Prophet, that there is no
reason why believers, though they are severely oppressed, should give
way to sorrow, but that good hope ought to encourage them to gladness,
that they may now prepare to render thanksgiving.

<span id="xi.i-p116"></span>The subject of this song is, that Christ has
been revealed to the world, and sent by the Father, in order to relieve
the miseries of his Church, and to restore her to perfect order, and
indeed, as it were, to renew the whole world. As it was difficult to
believe this, the Prophet wished to remove every doubt, in order to fix
these predictions more deeply in their hearts. Nor ought we to wonder
that the Prophet labors so hard to arouse them when they were reduced to
the greatest straits, and had no longer any hope of safety. The mere
aspect of things might shake their faith, and even produce suspicion
that all that the prophets had foretold was unfounded and absurd. The
object, of this exhortation therefore is, that when affairs are utterly
desperate, they should be cheerful and rely on these promises.

<span id="xi.i-p117"></span>*A new song.* By *new* he means an
excellent, beautiful, and elegant song, not one that is ordinary or
common, but a song which may arouse men to admiration, as relating to
the extraordinary grace of God, of which there had never been so
remarkable an example. In this sense it is also used in <span
id="xi.i-p117.1"></span>[Ps 33:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#003.md)<span
id="xi.i-p117.1"></span>, and <span id="xi.i-p117.2"></span>[Ps
96:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#001.md)<span id="xi.i-p117.2"></span>
*New* is here contrasted with what is Ordinary, and thus he extols the
infinite mercy of God, which was to be revealed in Christ, and which
ought therefore to be celebrated and sung with the highest praises.
Hence we infer that each of us ought to be the more zealous in
proclaiming the praises of God, in proportion to the greater number of
favors which we have received. It is indeed the duty of all men to sing
praise to God, for there is no person who is not bound to it by the
strongest obligations; but more lofty praises ought to proceed from
those on whom more valuable gifts have been bestowed. Now, since God has
laid open the fountain of all blessings in Christ, and has displayed all
spiritual riches, we need not wonder if he demand that we offer to him
an unwonted and excellent sacrifice of praise.

<span id="xi.i-p118"></span>It ought to be observed that this *song*
cannot be sung but by renewed men; for it ought to proceed from the
deepest feeling of the heart, and therefore we need the direction and
influence of the Spirit, that we may sing those praises in a proper
manner. Besides, he does not exhort one or a few nations to do this, but
all the nations in the world; for to all of them Christ was sent.

<span id="xi.i-p119"></span><span id="xi.i-p119.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p120"></span>**11.** *Let the desert and it’s cities cry
aloud.* While the Prophet includes all the parts of the world, he
mentions particularly those which were better known to the Jews; for on
the west Judea had the sea, and on the east the desert and Arabia. When
he speaks of the tents of *Kedar,* the *desert,* and the *rocks,* he
means Arabia; but it is a figure of speech by which a part is taken for
the whole, for it includes the whole of the east. It is as if he had
said, that from the rising to the setting of the sun these praises shall
be heard; for God shall be worshipped everywhere, though formerly he was
worshipped in Judea alone; and thus the state of affairs shall be
changed, and that praise shall be beard in the most distant parts of the
earth.  <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md)

<span id="xi.i-p122"></span>*The towns where Kedar dwells.* He mentions
*Kedar,* because the Scenite  <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md)
Arabians, as is well known, dwelt in tents. But he employs the word
*towns,* while he is speaking of a desert; and therefore it ought to be
remarked, that *desert* denotes not only the vast wilderness which lay
between Judea and Arabia, but the more distant countries which were
commonly designated from that part which was adjoining to them, as some
people give the name of “mountainous” to those plains which lie beyond
the mountains; for the common people have their attention so much
directed to what they see close at hand, that they suppose them to
resemble other places that are more distant. Yet the Prophet here exalts
and magnifies the greatness of the grace of God, in reaching even rude
and barbarous nations, whose savage cruelty was well known.

<span id="xi.i-p124"></span><span id="xi.i-p124.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p125"></span>**12.** *Let them give glory to Jehovah.* He
explains what the nature of that shouting will be, that is, to celebrate
the praises of God; for his goodness and mercy shall be everywhere seen;
and therefore he enjoins them to celebrate this redemption with a
cheerful voice, because the blessed consequences of it shall be shared
by all the nations. And thus we are reminded to cry aloud in the present
day with the greatest earnestness when we proclaim the praises of God,
that we ourselves may be inflamed, and may excite others by our example
to act in the same manner; for to be lukewarm, or to mutter, or to sing,
as the saying is, to themselves and to the muses, is impossible for
those who have actually tasted the grace of God.

<span id="xi.i-p126"></span><span id="xi.i-p126.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p127"></span>**13.** *Jehovah like a giant.* What Isaiah
now adds is intended to surmount the temptations of believers. He
ascribes to God strength and power, that they may know that they shall
find in him a sure defense; for in adversity we are perplexed, because
we doubt whether or not God will be able to render us assistance,
especially when by delaying he appears in some measure to reject our
prayers; and therefore the Prophet loudly extols the power of God, that
all may learn to rely and place their confidence in him.

<span id="xi.i-p128"></span>*Will go forth.* The *going forth* that is
here mentioned must be taken metaphorically; for God seemed to be
concealed at the time when he permitted his people to be affiicted and
oppressed without any appearance of aid; and therefore the word means
“to come forth publicly for the sake of giving assistance.” This is
confirmed by what follows.

<span id="xi.i-p129"></span>*And as a warrior.* When he attributes to
God burning indignation, with which he rushes forth “like a warrior”
against his enemies, the comparisons are drawn from human feelings, and
declare to us the powerful assistance of God, which would not otherwise
make a sufficiently powerful impression on our minds. He therefore
accommodates himself to our capacity, as we have often said, that we may
know how ardently he desires to preserve us, and how much he is
distressed by the affliction and oppression of believers, and likewise
how terrible is his anger, whenever he girds himself for battle.

<span id="xi.i-p130"></span>We ought always to observe that peculiar
season which the Prophet had in his eye, to which these predictions must
be applied; for while the enemies were becoming more and more fierce,
and were taunting a wretched people, it was the duty of believers to
look at something quite different from what they beheld with their eyes,
and to believe that God is sufficiently powerful to subdue their
enemies, and rescue them out of their hands. Nor was it only during the
captivity that it was of importance for them to have their sorrow
alleviated by this promise, but almost till the coming of Christ; for
they were continually and painfully constrained to encounter severe
distresses, as is evident from history.

<span id="xi.i-p131"></span><span id="xi.i-p131.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p132"></span>**14.** *I have kept silence.* The Prophet
meets the temptations which commonly give us great uneasiness, when God
delays his aid. We are tempted by impatience, and dread that his
promises are false. We reckon it unreasonable that God should be silent,
and fall asleep, so to speak, while the wicked carry themselves high;
that he should be cool, while they burn with eagerness to do mischief;
and that he should wink at their crimes, while they keenly pursue every
kind of cruelty. When their minds were distressed and almost
overwhelmed, the Prophet wished to comfort them, that they might not
think that God had forsaken them, though everything appeared to be
desperate.

<span id="xi.i-p133"></span>*For a long time.* He expressly mentions
“the great length of time,” that their hearts might not languish through
the tedious delay; for when they had been broken down by almost
incessant calamities since the death of Jehoshaphat, it was very hard
and distressing to spend seventy years in captivity. Nor was even this
the end of their afflictions, and therefore they needed to be carefully
admonished, that although God do not immediately send relief, still
believers will suffer nothing by the delay, provided that they wait with
patience. By these words he also rebukes unbelievers, who, trusting to
his forbearance, freely indulged in every kind of wickedness; and
therefore God declares that, although he has refrained and been a silent
spectator, he is not on that account deprived of his power.

<span id="xi.i-p134"></span>*Like a woman in labor.* By this metaphor he
expresses astonishing warmth of love and tenderness of affection; for he
compares himself to a mother who singularly loves her child, though she
brought him forth with extreme pain. It may be thought that these things
are not applicable to God; but in no other way than by such figures of
speech can his ardent love towards us be expressed. He must therefore
borrow comparisons from known objects, in order to enable us to
understand those which are unknown to us; for God loves very differently
from men, that is, more fully and perfectly, and, although he surpasses
all human affections, yet nothing that is disorderly belongs to him.

<span id="xi.i-p135"></span>Besides, he intended also to intimate that
the redemption of his people would be a kind of birth, that the Jews
might know that the grave would serve them for a womb, and that thus, in
the midst of corruption, they might entertain the hope of salvation.
Although he produced a new Church for himself without pain or effort,
yet, in order to exhibit more fully the excellence of his grace in this
new birth, he not inappropriately attributes to himself the cry of “a
woman in labor.”

<span id="xi.i-p136"></span>*I will destroy and swallow at once.*
Because that comparison of a travailing woman might somewhat degrade the
majesty and power of God, the Prophet determined to add here a different
feeling. So far then as relates to love, he says that God resembles a
mother; so far as relates to power, he says that he resembles a lion or
a giant.

<span id="xi.i-p137"></span><span id="xi.i-p137.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p138"></span>**15.** *I* *will reduce mountains and hills
to a wilderness.* The Prophet means that all the defences and military
forces on which the wicked plume themselves shall not prevent God from
setting his people at liberty. It was necessary that this should be
added to the former statements; for when we see enemies exceedingly
powerful, and almost invincible, we tremble, and do not look for God’s
assistance, which would be necessary to keep our faith strong. On this
point, therefore, the Prophet dwells, in order to shew that no power or
army whatsoever can resist the Lord when he wishes to deliver his
people. In short, he shews that there shall be such a revolution, that
they who formerly were most powerful shall be crushed, and shall gain
nothing by all their attempts against him.

<span id="xi.i-p139"></span>Such appears to me to be the plain meaning
of this passage, and there is no necessity for entering into ingenious
speculations, as some have done, who, in an allegorical interpretation
of these words, pronounce that by “mountains and hills” are meant
cities, and by *herbage* the men who inhabit them. But there is no
necessity for pursuing such refinements; for he simply declares that God
is sufficiently powerful to fulfill his promises and deliver his Church,
because he will easily surmount all the difficulties which present
themselves to our eyes. This statement corresponds also to other
predictions which we have formerly seen, in which the Prophet taught
that as soon as God has determined to assist his people, his power is
not limited to natural means, but miraculously breaks through every
obstruction that appears to hinder his passage.

<span id="xi.i-p140"></span><span id="xi.i-p140.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p141"></span>**16.** *And I will lead the blind.* After
having shewn that the strength of the enemies cannot prevent God from
delivering his people, he proceeds with that consolation to which he had
formerly adverted. He describes by the word *blind* those whose affairs
are so difficult, and intricate, and disordered, that they know not to
what hand to turn, or in what direction to flee, and, in short, who see
no means of escape, but deep gulfs on every hand. When our affairs
proceed smoothly enough, a plain and easy path is placed before our
eyes; and, in like manner, when our affairs are painful and distressing,
and especially when they hold out no hope of relief, but threaten
destruction to us, and are covered with deep and melancholy darkness, we
are blinded. When we have thus no means of escape, the Prophet tells us
that at that very time we ought, especially to hope and to look for
assistance from the Lord.

<span id="xi.i-p142"></span>It is often advantageous to us also to have
no way open to us, to be straitened and hemmed in on every hand, and
even to be blinded, that we may learn to depend solely on God’s
assistance and to rely on him; for, so long as a plank is left on which
we think that we can seize, we turn to it with our whole heart. While we
are driven about in all directions, the consequence is, that the
remembrance of heavenly grace fades from our memory. If, therefore, we
desire that God should assist us and relieve our adversity, we must be
*blind,* we must turn away our eyes from the present condition of
things, and restrain our judgment, that we may entirely rely on his
promises. Although this blindness is far from being pleasant, and shews
the weakness of our mind, yet, if we judge from the good effects which
it produces, we ought not greatly to shun it; for it is better to be
“blind” persons guided by the hand of God, than, by excessive sagacity,
to form labyrinths for ourselves.

<span id="xi.i-p143"></span>*And will turn darkness before them into
light.* When he promises that he will give “light” instead of
“darkness,” he confirms what has been already said; and therefore,
although we see not even a ray of light in adversity, yet we ought not
to despair of God’s assistance, but at that very time we ought
especially to embrace his promises; for the Lord will easily change
darkness into light, make straight the crooked windings, and lead us
into the path, that we may walk with safety. Yet let us perceive that
these things are promised to believers alone, who intrust themselves to
God, and allow themselves to be governed by him; and, in short, who have
known their blindness, and willingly follow him as their leader, and
amidst the darkness of afflictions patiently wait for the dawn of grace.
To those only who abide by his promises does he stretch out his hand,
and not to the wise men  <span id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) who
wish to see in spite of him, or who are carried headlong by unlawful
schemes.

<span id="xi.i-p145"></span><span id="xi.i-p145.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p146"></span>**17.** *They shall be driven back.* This
enables us to see more clearly to whom the former doctrine relates, for
it distinguishes between the worshippers of God and the worshippers of
idols. The Lord will be a leader to his own people, but, on the other
hand, *they who worship idols shall be ashamed* As if he had said, that
here the Lord gives us a choice, either to be saved by his grace, or to
perish miserably; for all that place their hope of salvation in idols
shall perish, but they who trust in the word of God are certain of
salvation; because, though they often are heavily afflicted, yet he will
not allow their hope to be put to shame in the end, but by the result
will prove that he did not in vain lay down this distinction.

<span id="xi.i-p147"></span>*And say to a molten image, Ye are our
gods.* It is certain that by these two marks are described all idolaters
who place their hope in any one else than in God alone; for, although
idolaters do not bow down before their idols, yet, by attaching divinity
to them, they offer blasphemy to the only and true God; for the chief
part of the worship of God consists in faith and calling upon him, both
of which the Prophet here describes. It may be asked, Were they so
stupid as to say to an image, “Thou art my god?” for all superstitious
persons confessed that God is in heaven, and did not openly ascribe
divinity to wood or stone. I reply, all idolaters ascribe to images the
power of God, though they acknowledge that he is in heaven; for, when
they flee to statues and images, when they make and perform vows to
them, they undoubtedly ascribe to them what belongs to God. It is in
vain for them, therefore, to cloak their ignorance under plausible
excuses, for they reckon wood and stone to be gods, and offer the
highest insult to God; and consequently, the Prophet did not employ
exaggerated language, or falsely accuse them of being idolaters; for it
is plainly testified by their words and speeches, when they call their
idols and images gods. Even though they did not utter a word, their
madness is openly manifested by their imagining that they cannot reach
the hand or the ear of God without bowing down before images to utter
their prayers. The object of these statements is, that all may
understand that no man will be saved but, he who trusts in God alone.

<span id="xi.i-p148"></span><span id="xi.i-p148.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p149"></span>**18.** *O ye deaf, hear, and ye blind.* He
now employs these words, “blind” and “deaf,” in a sense different from
that in which he formerly employed them, (verse 16,) when he
metaphorically described those who had no understanding, and who were
overwhelmed by such a mass of afflictions that they were blinded by
their sorrow; for here he gives the name of *blind* to those who shut
their eyes in the midst of light, and do not behold the works of God;
and the name of *deaf to* those who refuse to hear him, and sink down
into stupidity and slothfulness amidst the dregs of their ignorance. He
therefore condemns the Jews for “blindness,” or rather, in my own
opinion, he condemns all men; for, while he directly reproaches the Jews
because “in hearing they do not hear, and in seeing they do not see,”
(<span id="xi.i-p149.1"></span>[Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009.md)<span id="xi.i-p149.1"></span>;
<span id="xi.i-p149.2"></span>[Mt
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#013)<span id="xi.i-p149.2"></span>,.md)
yet this applies in some measure to the Gentiles, to whom God revealed
himself by his creatures, on whose hearts and consciences also he
impressed the knowledge of him, and to whom he had made and would still
make known his wonderful works. By demanding attention, he pronounces
that there is nothing that hinders them from comprehending the truth and
power of God, except that they are “deaf and blind.” Nor is this
unaccompanied by malice and ingratitude; for he openly instructs them
concerning his power, and gives them very striking proofs of it; but no
one gives attention to his doctrine or to his wonderful actions, and the
consequence is, that they are willingly “blind.” Thus the Prophet shews
that the fault lies wholly with men in not perceiving the power of God.

<span id="xi.i-p150"></span><span id="xi.i-p150.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p151"></span>**19.** *Who is blind but my servant?* There
are some who interpret this verse as if the Prophet were describing the
reproaches which wicked men are accustomed to throw out against the
prophets; for they retort on the Lord’s servants those reproofs and
accusations which they cannot endure. “Whom dost thou accuse of
blindness? Whom dost thou call deaf? Take that to thyself. Who is blind
but thou?” They think, therefore, that it is as if the Lord expostulated
with the Jews in this manner; “I see that you reckon my prophets to be
blind and deaf.” But we shall immediately see that this interpretation
does not agree with the context, for the Prophet afterwards explains
(verse 20) why he calls them “blind.” It is because, while they see many
things, they pay no attention to them. Indeed, this does not at all
apply to the prophets, and therefore let us follow the plain and natural
meaning.

<span id="xi.i-p152"></span>Isaiah had accused all men of blindness, but
especially the Jews, because they ought to have seen more clearly than
all the rest; for they had not only some ordinary light and
understanding, but enjoyed the word, by which the Lord abundantly
revealed himself to them. Although, therefore, all the rest were blind,
yet the Jews ought to have seen and known God, seeing that they were
illuminated by his Law and doctrine, as by a very bright lamp. Besides,
Isaiah afterwards addresses the Jews in this manner,

<span id="xi.i-p153"></span>“Arise, O Jerusalem, and be illuminated; for
darkness shall be on all the earth, but the Lord shall shine on thee.”
(<span id="xi.i-p153.1"></span>[Isa.
60:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002)<span id="xi.i-p153.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.i-p154"></span>Because the Jews shut their eyes amidst such
clear light, that is the reason why he addresses to them this special
reproof. As if he had said, “In vain do I debate with those who are
alienated from me, and it is not so wonderful that they are blind; but
it is monstrous that this should have happened to my servants (before
whose eyes light has been placed) to be deaf to the doctrine which
sounds continually in their ears. For these things are so clear that the
blind might see them, and so loud that the deaf might hear them; but in
vain do I speak to them, for nothing can be more dull or stupid; and,
instead of seeing and hearing better than all others, as they ought to
have done, none can be found either more deaf or more blind.”

<span id="xi.i-p155"></span>*My messenger whom I send.* From the human
race universally the Prophet gradually descends to the Jews, and next to
the priests, who were leading persons, and might be regarded as
occupying the highest rank. It belonged to their once to interpret the
Law, and to set a good example before others, and, in short, to point
out the way of salvation. It was from “the priest’s mouth” that they
were commanded to “seek the Law.” (<span id="xi.i-p155.1"></span>[Mal
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/mal002.htm#007)<span id="xi.i-p155.1"></span>..md)
The Prophet complains, therefore, that they who ought to have led the
way to others were themselves blind.

<span id="xi.i-p156"></span>Some view the word *servant* as relating to
Isaiah, and others to Christ, and think that he, as well as Isaiah, is
accused of blindness; but this has nothing to do with the Prophet’s
meaning. Thus, he magnifies by comparison the complaint which he lately
made about the slothfulness of the Jews; for they were more deeply in
fault than others, but the heaviest blame lay on the priests who were
their leaders. Let us therefore learn, that the nearer we approach to
God, and the higher the rank to which we are elevated, we shall be the
less excusable. For the same reason he applies the term *perfect* to
those who ought to have been perfect; for he mentions reproachfully that
perfection from which they had fallen by wicked revolt, and thus had
basely profaned a most excellent gift of God. Having possessed a
“perfect” rule of righteousness, it lay with themselves alone to follow
it.

<span id="xi.i-p157"></span><span id="xi.i-p157.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p158"></span>**20.** *Seeing many things.* The Prophet
himself explains what is the nature of this blindness of which he spoke,
and shews that it is double; and this shews clearly that he spoke of the
Jews, who by wicked contempt had quenched God’s light. Our guilt will be
double when we shall come to the judgment-seat of God, if we shut our
eyes when he exhibits the light, and shut our ears when he teaches by
his word. The heathen nations will indeed be without excuse; but the
Jews and others to whom the Lord revealed himself in so many ways, will
deserve double condemnation for having refused to see or hear God. We,
therefore, who have so many and so illustrious examples set before us at
the present day, ought to dread this judgment; for in many persons there
will now be found not less blindness or obduracy than formerly existed
among the Jews, and not more excusable.

<span id="xi.i-p159"></span><span id="xi.i-p159.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p160"></span>**21.** *The Lord is well pleased.* In order
to aggravate still more the guilt of the Jews, he now shews that it was
not God who prevented them from leading a prosperous and happy life. He
had already said that the distresses and afflictions which they endure
are the punishment of their blindness, which they have voluntarily
brought upon themselves; and now he brings forward as an addition and
crowning point of the accusation, that by their obstinacy they reject
all relief.

<span id="xi.i-p161"></span>This passage is interpreted in various ways.
Some render it, “The Lord hath so willed it;” others, “He is merciful;”
but, for my own part, I have translated it, “The Lord is willing,” that
is, disposed and inclined to deliver his people, and that for the
purpose of magnifying his Law and extolling his righteousness. Thus God
assigns the reason why he is ready to aid those who are unworthy, that
he wishes to spread his glory in their salvation, that in this manner
his righteousness may be illustriously displayed, and that his Law may
prevail and flourish. As to the heavy calamities that have come on the
Jews, the reason is, that of their own accord they have resolved to be
blind, and to bring afflictions on themselves, instead of obeying God;
for otherwise the Lord would have wished to enrich and exalt them.
Others view it thus, “The Lord wishes to magnify his Law, because he
wishes to appear to be faithful in punishing the Jews, as he had
threatened them by his Law;” and thus they consider “righteousness” to
denote the punishment and vengeance which God inflicts on a wicked
people.

<span id="xi.i-p162"></span>Others render it, “For his righteous one,”
and refer it to Christ; but they mistake the meaning of the word <span
id="xi.i-p162.1"></span>צדקו, *(tzidko,)* and unquestionably he speaks
of righteousness, and means that the Lord would willingly have displayed
the magnificence of his promises:, and would have given proofs of his
righteousness in preserving his people, if they had not shewn themselves
to be ungrateful and unworthy. Some think that the Lord here offers an
excuse for himself, because, when the people whom he had adopted were
exposed to so many evils, it appeared as if his truth were shaken, and
that the Prophet intended to meet this calumny, for they were seized and
became a prey, not because the Lord delights in their miseries, but
because he prefers his righteousness to everything else.

<span id="xi.i-p163"></span>For my own part, I explain it simply to
mean, “The Lord, for the sake of doing honor to his Law, was inclined to
do good to his people, in order that his glory and righteousness might
shine forth in it; but his people shewed themselves to be unworthy of so
great a favor; and, therefore, by their own obduracy they made their
wounds incurable.” Besides, we ought to learn from this passage the
reason why the Lord bestows so many favors on his Church. It is, that he
may promote his Law, that is, that he may bring men to honor his
majesty, and that his truth may shine more and more. When he says that
the Lord is willing and inclined; he shews plainly that he is not
induced to it by any one else than by himself; but he expresses it more
fully, when he adds, *on account of his righteousness;* for he excludes
everything that men could bring. Nor is the Lord prompted by any other
consideration to do good, than because he is righteous; for no merit or
worth will be found among men. But this reason applied especially to the
Jews, whom alone he deigned to adopt.

<span id="xi.i-p164"></span><span id="xi.i-p164.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p165"></span>**22.** *But this people.* Isaiah now
declares that it is through their own fault that the people are
miserable and appointed to destruction, because they reject God, who
would otherwise have been inclined to do good to them, and because they
deliberately set aside all remedies, and wish for death, as is commonly
the case with men who are past hope. Thus he excuses God in such a
manner as to bring a heavy accusation against the people, because they
have rejected him by their ingratitude, and have abused his fatherly
kindness. Yet, as I remarked a little before, he mentions these things,
not so much for the sake of excusing God, as of bringing a bitter
complaint, that his countrymen have leagued to their destruction;
because, as if on set purpose, they have precipitated themselves into
many calamities. If, then, we see the Church, at the present day, in a
ruinous and revolting condition, we ought to ascribe it to our
iniquities and transgressions, by which we do not suffer God to do good
to us.

<span id="xi.i-p166"></span>The copulative <span
id="xi.i-p166.1"></span>ו *(vau)* is rendered by some *therefore;* but I
have preferred to translate it *but;* for it states a contrast to that
desire by which the Lord declared that he was prompted to defend his
people, if they had permitted it. I choose to interpret <span
id="xi.i-p166.2"></span>הפח *(hapheach)* as a gerundial participle,
*about to be snared;* for he speaks of a nation which was about to be
led into captivity. As to <span id="xi.i-p166.3"></span>בהורים,
(*bahurim,)* I think that two words, instead of one, are here used to
signify *in dens;* for to translate the word *young men,* appears to me
to be at variance with the context.

<span id="xi.i-p167"></span>*They shall be made a spoil.* They who
interpret this as relating to the whole human race, who have no Savior
but Christ, (<span id="xi.i-p167.1"></span>[Joh
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#036)<span id="xi.i-p167.1"></span>,.md)
adduce nothing that corresponds to the Prophet’s meaning; for he simply
declares that the people shall perish without hope of deliverance,
because they rejected the grace of God. Let us infer from this what must
befall us, if we do not in due time embrace the grace of God offered to
us. We shall certainly deserve to be deprived of all aid, to be exposed
as a prey and a spoil, and utterly to perish.

<span id="xi.i-p168"></span><span id="xi.i-p168.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p169"></span>**23.** *Who is there among you?* Isaiah
continues the same subject; for he means that the Jews are and will be
so stupid, that they will not see, even when they are warned; and he
expressly addresses them, because, while they ought to have been better
educated and taught than others, yet they understood nothing, and did
not observe the judgments of God, even though they were exceedingly
manifest.

<span id="xi.i-p170"></span>*Who shall hearken for the time to come?*
That is, who, being at length subdued by afflictions, repents, though it
be late. We see, then, how this astonishment aggravates the criminality
of their madness, because they will always refuse to be taught. Yet let
us learn what is the use of threatenings and punishments; for God does
not reprove our crimes, or punish us for them, as if he delighted in
taking vengeance, or demanded some recompense, but that we may be on our
guard “for the time to come.”

<span id="xi.i-p171"></span><span id="xi.i-p171.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p172"></span>**24.** *Who gave Jacob for a prey?* These
are the matters which Isaiah complains that the Jews did not observe;
for they thought either that the sufferings which they endured happened
by chance, or that they had not the same strength to resist as their
fathers had, and that this was the reason why they were conquered by
their enemies. In short, having their minds fully occupied with external
causes, they did not at the same time observe the threatenings which had
been so frequently denounced by the prophets, nor attend to the
judgments of God; and therefore the Prophet drags them before the
heavenly throne, by declaring that God is the author of these judgments.

<span id="xi.i-p173"></span>*Hath not Jehovah?* They could not believe
that the calamities which they suffered proceeded from God, as the just
punishment of their sins; and we know that there is nothing which men
can now be with more difficulty persuaded to believe. Everybody
acknowledges that God is the author of all things, but if you ask
whether or not all adverse events are God’s chastisements, they will be
ashamed to confess it; for men are distracted by a variety of thoughts,
and, being prejudiced by their opinion of fortune, turn their minds and
hearts to this or that cause rather than to God.

<span id="xi.i-p174"></span>*Because we have sinned against him.* Isaiah
next points out the cause of so grievous destruction, the sins of the
people, which the Lord justly punished. In like manner, Moses had also
shewn,

<span id="xi.i-p175"></span>“How would a thousand flee from the face of
one? Doth not the Lord pursue you, and shut you up in the hands of the
enemy?” (<span id="xi.i-p175.1"></span>[De
32:30](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#030)<span id="xi.i-p175.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.i-p176"></span>We wonder every day at many things which
happen contrary to our expectation, and yet we do not acknowledge that
the cause lies with ourselves. It is therefore necessary that we be hard
pressed and constrained by violence to confess our fault, and
consequently this doctrine must be often stated and repeated.

<span id="xi.i-p177"></span>That men may not accuse God of cruelty, the
Prophet adds, that he does it for a just cause; for he does not rush
forward  <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) to inflict punishment,
if he be not constrained by necessity, and he takes no pleasure in our
afflictions; and, therefore, we must here observe two separate things.
First, no evil happens to us, but from the Lord, so that we must not
think that anything happens either by chance or by any external cause.
Secondly, we suffer no evil whatever, but for a just cause, because we
have sinned against God. In vain, therefore, do men accuse God of
cruelty; for we ought to acknowledge his righteous judgments in the
chastisements which he deservedly inflicts.

<span id="xi.i-p179"></span>*And they would not walk in his ways.* Here
the Prophet aggravates the guilt of the Jews, but changes the person,
because he formerly included himself along with others, as being a
member of that body, and confessed his guilt. Not that he resembled the
great body of the people, or approved of their crimes; but because,
amidst such a huge mass of vices, he could not be free from being in
some degree infected by the contagion, like other parts of the body.
Because he was widely different from the great body of the people, he
changes the person, and adds, *“They* would not;” by which he declares
that such deep-rooted obduracy is offensive to him, so that he cannot in
any way either conceal it or express his approbation of it; for the
subject now in hand is not ordinary vices, but contempt and rejection of
God, manifested by fiercely and haughtily shaking off his yoke. This is
the reason why Isaiah excludes himself from their number.

<span id="xi.i-p180"></span>If these things justly befell the Jews, let
us know that the same punishment hangs over us and the whole world, if
we do not take warning and repent. We see how kindly the Lord invites us
to himself, in how many ways he expresses his good-will towards us, how
graciously he testifies that he will be reconciled, though he has been
offended. Having now been so often and so kindly invited by God, and
having experienced his mercy, if we refuse to listen to him, we shall
undoubtedly feel that the ruin which they experienced belongs equally to
all rebels.

<span id="xi.i-p181"></span><span id="xi.i-p181.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p182"></span>**25.** *Therefore he hath poured upon him.*
Because the chastisements by which the Lord had begun, and would
afterwards continue, to punish the Jews, were very severe, the Prophet
employs metaphorical language to express their vehemence. He says that
the Lord *poureth out his fury,* as if a thunderbolt were discharged
with violence, or as if waters burst forth, to spread devastation far
and wide on the surrounding country; just as, at the deluge, when

<span id="xi.i-p183"></span>“the flood-gates of the deep were broken up,
and the windows of heaven were opened,” (<span
id="xi.i-p183.1"></span>[Ge 7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011.md)<span
id="xi.i-p183.1"></span>,)

<span id="xi.i-p184"></span>the waters burst forth with prodigious force
and violence.

<span id="xi.i-p185"></span>*And the strength of war.* He next employs a
different figure, that God assembles his forces to make war, that he may
attack the people with unrelenting hostility. If this be supposed to
mean the enemies whom the Lord raised up against the Jews, I do not
greatly object to the interpretation; for it is certain that they were
raised up by the judgment of God. What else was Nebuchadnezzar than
God’s scourge? (<span id="xi.i-p185.1"></span>[Jer
51:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#020)<span id="xi.i-p185.1"></span>..md)
But, for my own part, I think that this also ought to be viewed as
metaphorical language, meaning that “God rushes forth violently, like an
armed enemy, and pours out his fury on the people.” He has various ways
of making war; for he chastises his people sometimes by famine,
sometimes by war, and sometimes by pestilence; and therefore I think
that he includes here scourges of every kind by which the Lord strikes
his people. If we sometimes think that they are too harsh and severe,
let us consider how heinous our sins are; for we shall not find that he
is immoderate or excessively severe in inflicting punishment.

<span id="xi.i-p186"></span>*And he gave no heed to it.* Again the
Prophet exclaims against that gross stupidity with which the Jews were
struck, so that they did not perceive their affliction, nor raise their
eyes to heaven, so as to acknowledge that the Lord was the avenger and
author of it.  <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md)

<span id="xi.i-p188"></span>*And he laid it not to heart.* To “lay a
thing to heart” is to consider attentively and diligently; for if this
thought came into our minds, and were deeply engraven on our hearts,
“God is judge, and hath justly punished us,” we should immediately
repent. At present the whole world is oppressed by so many calamities,
that there is scarcely a spot that is free from the wrath of God; yet no
person gives heed to it, but all fiercely and rebelliously contend with
him; and therefore we need not wonder that he inflicts on men such
dreadful punishment, and pours out his wrath on all sides, when the
world opposes him with inveterate rebellion.
