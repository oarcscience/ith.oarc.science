<span id="xiii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 44

<span id="xiii.i"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p1"></span><span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>[Isaiah
44:1-28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#001.md)<span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and
Israel, whom I have chosen:

<span id="xiii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Nunc tamen audi, Iacob, serve meus,
et Israel quem elegi.

<span id="xiii.i-p4"></span>**2.** Thus saith the LORD that made thee,
and formed thee from the womb, *which* will help thee; Fear not, O
Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.

<span id="xiii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Sic dicit Iehova factor tuus, et
formator tuus ab utero; tibi auxiliabitur. Ne timeas, serve meus, Iacob,
dilecte quem elegi.

<span id="xiii.i-p6"></span>**3.** For I will pour water upon him that
is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon
thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:

<span id="xiii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Quia effundam aquas super sitientem,
et flumina super aridam. Effundam spiritum meum super semen tuum, et
benedictionem meam super germina tua.

<span id="xiii.i-p8"></span>**4.** And they shall spring up *as* among
the grass, as willows by the water courses.

<span id="xiii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et germinabunt quasi inter herbam,
quasi salices juxta rivos aquarum.

<span id="xiii.i-p10"></span>**5.** One shall say, I *am* the LORD’S;
and another shall call *himself* by the name of Jacob; and another shall
subscribe *with* his hand unto the LORD, and surname *himself* by the
name of Israel.

<span id="xiii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Hic dicet, Ego sum Iehovae; et ille
vocabitur nomine Iacob; altus scribet manu sua, Iehovae (sum), et nomine
Israel cognominabitur.

<span id="xiii.i-p12"></span>**6.** Thus saith the LORD the King of
Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I *am* the first, and I *am*
the last; and besides me *there is* no God.

<span id="xiii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Sic dicit Iehova, rex Israel, et
redemptor ejus, Iehova exercituum: Ego primus, et idem novissimus, et
praeter me non est Deus.

<span id="xiii.i-p14"></span>**7.** And who, as I, shall call, and shall
declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient
people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew
unto them.

<span id="xiii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Et quis sicut ego vocabit,
annunciabit hoc, et ordinabit hoc mihi, ex quo constitui populum seculi?
Et quae pendent, et quae ventura sunt, illis annuncient.

<span id="xiii.i-p16"></span>**8.** Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have
not I told thee from that time, and have declared *it?* ye *are* even my
witnesses. Is there a God besides me? yea, *there is* no God; I know not
*any.*

<span id="xiii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Ne timeatis et ne terreamini. An non
ex tune audire to feci, et annuntiavi? Itaque vos testes mei, quod non
sit Deus praeter me, et non sit fortis quem ignorem.

<span id="xiii.i-p18"></span>**9.** They that make a graven image *are*
all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and
they *are* their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be
ashamed.

<span id="xiii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Fictores sculptilis omnes vanitas;
et desiderabilia eorum nihil prosunt; et testes eorum ipsi, quod non
vident, nec cognoscunt; ideoque confundentur.

<span id="xiii.i-p20"></span>**10.** Who hath formed a god, or molten a
graven image *that* is profitable for nothing?

<span id="xiii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Quis formator Dei? et quis
sculptilis confiator, quod nullam ad rem usui est?

<span id="xiii.i-p22"></span>**11.** Behold, all his fellows shall be
ashamed: and the workmen, they *are* of men: let them all be gathered
together, let them stand up; *yet* they shall fear, *and* they shall be
ashamed together.

<span id="xiii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Ecce omnes socii ejus pudefient, et
artifices ipsi sunt ex hominibus. Ut conveniant omnes, ac stent,
pavebunt, et pudefient simul.

<span id="xiii.i-p24"></span>**12.** The smith with the tongs both
worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it
with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength
faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.

<span id="xiii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Faber ferrarius limam *(aut
forcipem)* sumet; operabitur in prunis, malleis formabit illud;
operabitur in eo, brachio virtutis suae; etiam famelicus, ut deficiant
rites; non bibat aquam, ut fatiscat.

<span id="xiii.i-p26"></span>**13.** The carpenter stretcheth out *his*
rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he
marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a
man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.

<span id="xiii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Faber lignarius extendit regulam,
illud delineat filo tincto, aptat planulis, circino figurat; facit illud
secundum formam viri, secundum effigiem hominis, ut sedeat in domo.

<span id="xiii.i-p28"></span>**14.** He heweth him down cedars, and
taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among
the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish
*it.*

<span id="xiii.i-p29"></span>**14.** Succidet sibi cedros, tollet ilicem
et quercum; roborabitur ad ligna silvae; plantabit pinum, quam pluvia
enutriet.

<span id="xiii.i-p30"></span>**15.** Then shall it be for a man to burn:
for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth *it,* and
baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth *it:* he maketh it a
graven image, and falleth down thereto.

<span id="xiii.i-p31"></span>**15.** Tum erit homini in incendium; nam
accipiet ex illis, et calefaciet se; praeterea furnum accendet, et
coquet panes; Deum quoque efficiet, atque adorabit; finget idolum, et
prosternet se coram co.

<span id="xiii.i-p32"></span>**16.** He burneth part thereof in the
fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is
satisfied: yea, he warmeth *himself,* and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have
seen the fire:

<span id="xiii.i-p33"></span>**16.** Partem ejus comburet igni; ex parte
carnem comedet; assabit assaturam, et saturabitur. Deinde calefaciet se,
ac dicet, Ohe calefactus sum, et vidi ignem.

<span id="xiii.i-p34"></span>**17.** And the residue thereof he maketh a
god, *even* his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth
*it,* and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou *art* my god.

<span id="xiii.i-p35"></span>**17.** Reliquias ejus in Deum vertit in
sculptile suum; incurvat se coram eo; adorat et precatur illud, dicens,
Libera me, quia Deus meus es.

<span id="xiii.i-p36"></span>**18.** They have not known nor understood:
for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; *and* their hearts,
that they cannot understand.

<span id="xiii.i-p37"></span>**18.** Nescierunt, nec intellexerunt; quia
oblevit oculos eorum, ne videant, et cor eorum, ne intelligant.

<span id="xiii.i-p38"></span>**19.** And none considereth in his heart,
neither *is there* knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned
part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals
thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten *it:* and shall I make the
residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a
tree?

<span id="xiii.i-p39"></span>**19.** Non redit ad cor suum, non est
sensus, nec intelligentia, ut dicat, Partem ejus combussi igni; etiam
super prunas ejus coxi panem; assavi carnem, et comedi; residuum ejus in
abominationem vertam: coram trunco ligni incurvabo me?

<span id="xiii.i-p40"></span>**20.** He feedeth on ashes: a deceived
heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say,
*Is there* not a lie in my right hand?

<span id="xiii.i-p41"></span>**20.** Pascit cinerem, cor seductum
inclinat eum, ut non liberet animam suam, neque dicat, Annon mendacium
in dextera mea?

<span id="xiii.i-p42"></span>**21.** Remember these, O Jacob and Israel;
for thou *art* my servant: I have formed thee; thou *art* my servant: O
Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.

<span id="xiii.i-p43"></span>**21.** Memor esto horum, Iacob, et Israel,
quia servus meus es; formavi to; servus meus es; Israel, ne obliviscaris
mei.

<span id="xiii.i-p44"></span>**22.** I have blotted out, as a thick
cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me;
for I have redeemed thee.

<span id="xiii.i-p45"></span>**22.** Delevi, ut nubem, iniquitates tuas;
ut nebulam, peccata tua. Revertere ad me, quia redemi to.

<span id="xiii.i-p46"></span>**23.** Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD
hath done *it:* shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into
singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD
hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.

<span id="xiii.i-p47"></span>**23.** Laudate, coeli, quia fecit Iehova;
jubilate, inferiora terrae; erumpite, montes, in laudem; silva et omnis
arbor quae in ea st; quoniam redemit Iehova Iacob, et in Israel
glorificabitur.

<span id="xiii.i-p48"></span>**24.** Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer,
and he that formed thee from the womb, I *am* the LORD that maketh all
*things;* that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad
the earth by myself;

<span id="xiii.i-p49"></span>**24.** Sic dicit Iehova redemptor tuns, et
factor tuus ex utero. Ego Iehova faciens omnia, extendens coelos solus,
expandens terrain inca virtute (*vel, a meipso.)*

<span id="xiii.i-p50"></span>**25.** That frustrateth the tokens of the
liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise *men* backward, and
maketh their knowledge foolish;

<span id="xiii.i-p51"></span>**25.** Dissipans signa divinatorum,
ariolos dementans, convertens sapientes retrorsum, et scientiam corum
infatuans.

<span id="xiii.i-p52"></span>**26.** That confirmeth the word of his
servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to
Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall
be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:

<span id="xiii.i-p53"></span>**26.** Suscitans verbum servi sui, et
consilium nuntiorum suorum perficiens; dicens Ierosolymae, Habitaberis;
et civitatibus Iuda, Extruemini; et ruinas ejus erigam.

<span id="xiii.i-p54"></span>**27.** That saith to the deep, Be dry, and
I will dry up thy rivers:

<span id="xiii.i-p55"></span>**27.** Dicens profundo, Exsiccare, et
flumina tua arefaeiam.

<span id="xiii.i-p56"></span>**28.** That saith of Cyrus, *He is* my
shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem,
Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

<span id="xiii.i-p57"></span>**28.** Dicens Cyro, Pastor meus; et omnem
voluntatem meam perficiet; dicendo etiam Ierosolymae, Aedificaberis; et
templo, Fundaberis.

<span id="xiii.i-p58"></span> 

<span id="xiii.i-p59"></span><span id="xiii.i-p59.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p60"></span>**1.** *Yet now hear.* Having a little
before rebuked the transgressions of the people, and declared that all
deserved eternal perdition, because both the princes and the people had
polluted everything by their crimes, he now mitigates that severity of
punishment, and comforts the people. In this passage I consider the
particle <span id="xiii.i-p60.1"></span>ו *(vau)* to mean *But* or
*Yet,* as in many other passages. As if he had said, “Though grievous
afflictions are about to overtake thee, *yet now* hear what I will do
for thy sake.” The verse must be viewed in connection with the former
argument, because the Lord declares that he will never permit his people
to perish altogether, though they be grievously afflicted. Hence infer,
that God is never so angry with his Church as not to leave some room for
mercy, as we have already seen on many occasions. The consequence is,
that the prophets, whenever they threaten, always add some consolation
as an abatement.

<span id="xiii.i-p61"></span>But lest we should imagine that men have
deserved it by their good conduct, he therefore adds, *whom I have
chosen;* for we do not serve God, because we are entitled to it, or
deserve it, but because he renders us fit by a free election. In this
passage, therefore, the words *Servant* and *Elect* are synonymous, yet
so that election comes first in order, and therefore David says that he
was God’s “servant” before he was born, because even from his mother’s
womb he had been received into God’s family. (<span
id="xiii.i-p61.1"></span>[Ps. 22:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010.md),
[Ps. 71:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa071.htm#006.md), [Ps.
116:16](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#016.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p61.1"></span>.)

<span id="xiii.i-p62"></span><span id="xiii.i-p62.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p63"></span>**2.** *Thus saith Jehovah thy Maker.*
Though he treated the Jews harshly, that they might be stripped of all
false confidence, and might humbly betake themselves to the grace of
God, he now caresses them pleasantly by a mild and gentle discourse,
that they may know that by self-denial they shall sustain no loss. We
must therefore supply here the following contrasts. “Thou, Jacob, art
indeed nothing in thyself, but God thy Maker will not despise his work;
no nobleness of birth would secure thee against perdition, but the
adoption which the Heavenly Father has been pleased to bestow upon thee
will be abundantly sufficient for redeeming thee.” Besides, we should
keep in mind what I have often said already, that the Prophet does not
speak of the first creation by which we are born to be human beings, but
of the regeneration which belongs and is peculiar to the elect, that
they may obtain a place in the Church of God.

<span id="xiii.i-p64"></span>*He that formed thee from the womb.* This
is added, that men may not claim anything for themselves, as if they had
moved him to shew kindness to them. By these words he also exhibits to
them a hereditary covenant, by which God separated them to be his
inheritance “before they were born.” (<span id="xiii.i-p64.1"></span>[Ro
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#011)<span id="xiii.i-p64.1"></span>..md)
Some think that this refers to the person of Jacob, because, by taking
hold of his brother’s foot, (<span id="xiii.i-p64.2"></span>[Ge
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#026)<span id="xiii.i-p64.2"></span>,.md)
he gave a remarkable proof of his election; but this is a forced
interpretation, and therefore I give a wider signification to these
words, namely, that the Lord was kind and bountiful to his people from
the commencement, and cut off all merits; because by free grace he
“formed him,” and then freely bestowed on him all blessings.

<span id="xiii.i-p65"></span>*He will help thee.* Some supply the
relative, *“Who* will help thee;” as if he had said, “Thy Helper;” but
it is better to read the clause separately.  <span
id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) It would be still more clear in the
first person, “I will help thee;” but as to the substance of the meaning
it makes no difference. The statemen t amounts to this, that he who is
the Creator of the people will be ready to give his assistance when the
proper time shall arrive. Let every person therefore adopt that reading
which he thinks proper; but I have preferred to follow the simple and
natural meaning, without supplying any word.

<span id="xiii.i-p67"></span>*O beloved!* The word <span
id="xiii.i-p67.2"></span>ישרון *(yeshurun)* is explained in various
ways. Some think that it is derived from <span
id="xiii.i-p67.3"></span>ישר, *(yashar,)* which means “to be upright,”
or “to please;” others from <span id="xiii.i-p67.4"></span>שור,
*(shur,)* and others from <span id="xiii.i-p67.5"></span>אשר, *(ashar.)*
But I rather agree with those who translate it *Beloved,* and derive it
from the root <span id="xiii.i-p67.6"></span>ישר, *(yashar.)* This
designation is also bestowed on that nation by Moses in his song; for,
although some render it in that passage *Upright,* and in this passage
also, the old rendering is more suitable, “My beloved is grown fat.”
(<span id="xiii.i-p67.7"></span>[De
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#015)<span id="xiii.i-p67.7"></span>..md)
The Prophet adorns his nation with these titles, that the Jews may be
led by past benefits to entertain hope for the future. This rule ought
to be held by all believers as perpetually binding, that, after having
experienced the kindness of God toward them, they should likewise expect
it for the future; for otherwise they will be excessively ungrateful,
and will shew that they do not rely on the promises of God, which, when
they are impressed on our hearts, undoubtedly bring peace and safety;
not that we should be utterly devoid of fear, but that we should strive
against all dread and distrust; and therefore he again repeats, —

<span id="xiii.i-p68"></span>*Fear thou not, Jacob.* Such is also the
import of the consolation given by Christ,

<span id="xiii.i-p69"></span>“Fear not, little flock, for my Father hath
good will towards thee.” (<span id="xiii.i-p69.1"></span>[Lu
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#032)<span id="xiii.i-p69.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xiii.i-p70"></span>And, indeed, among the dangers which
threaten death on all sides, no remedy is better adapted to allay
terrors than that God has been pleased to bestow his favor upon us, so
that he will save us for ever. By the word “Beloved,” therefore, he
again repeats that this depends on the favor and protection of God, who
ascribes to himself, and entirely claims, all the good that existed
among the people.

<span id="xiii.i-p71"></span><span id="xiii.i-p71.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p72"></span>**3.** *For I will pour waters.* He
continues the same subject, and at the same time explains what will be
the nature of that assistance which he has promised. But we ought always
to keep in remembrance that these prophecies relate to that sorrowful
and afflicted period of which he formerly spoke, that is, when the
people, in the extremity to which they were reduced, might think that
they were altogether forsaken, and that all the promises of God were
vain. Isaiah meets this doubt, and compares the people to a dry and
thirsty land, which has no moisture at all. By this metaphor David also
describes his wretchedness. (<span id="xiii.i-p72.1"></span>[Ps
143:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa143.htm#006)<span id="xiii.i-p72.1"></span>..md)
Although therefore they were worn out by afflictions, and the vital
moisture was decayed, yet, that they might not throw away courage in
their deepest distresses, they ought to have set before their minds this
declaration of the Prophet. We, too, when we are brought into the
greatest dangers, and see nothing before us but immediate death, ought
in the same manner to betake ourselves to these promises, that we may be
supported by them against all temptations. Yet we must feel our drought
and poverty, that our thirsty souls may partake of this refreshing
influence of the waters.

<span id="xiii.i-p73"></span>*I will pour my Spirit.* Jehovah himself
explains what he means by *waters* and *rivers,* that is, *his Spirit.*
In another passage the Spirit of God is called “water,” but in a
different sense. When Ezekiel gives the name “water” to the Holy Spirit,
he at the same time calls it “clean water,” with a view to cleansing.
(<span id="xiii.i-p73.1"></span>[Eze
36:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025)<span id="xiii.i-p73.1"></span>..md)
Isaiah will afterwards call the Spirit “waters,” but for a different
reason, that is, because by the secret moisture of his power he quickens
souls. But these words of the Prophet have a wider signification,
because he does not speak merely of the Spirit of regeneration, but
alludes to the universal grace which is spread over all the creatures,
and which is mentioned in <span id="xiii.i-p73.2"></span>[Ps
105:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa105.htm#030.md)<span id="xiii.i-p73.2"></span>,
“Send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be created, and he will renew the
face of the earth.” As David declares in that passage that every part of
the world is enlivened, so far as God imparts to it secret vigor, and
next ascribes to God might and power, by which, whenever he thinks fit,
he suddenly revives the ruinous condition of heaven and earth, so now
for the same reason Isaiah gives the appellation “water” to the sudden
renewal of the Church; as if he had said that the restoration of the
Church is at God’s disposal, as much as when he fertilizes by dew or
rain the barren and almost parched lands.

<span id="xiii.i-p74"></span>Thus the Spirit is compared to “water,”
because without Him all things decay and perish through drought, and
because by the secret watering of his power he quickens the whole world,
and because the barrenness occasioned by drought and heat is cured in
such a manner, that the earth puts on a new face. This is still more
fully explained by the word which he afterwards employs, *Blessing.*

<span id="xiii.i-p75"></span><span id="xiii.i-p75.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p76"></span>**4.** *And they shall spring up.* These
words contain nothing more than what I quoted from <span
id="xiii.i-p76.1"></span>[Ps
104:30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#030.md)<span id="xiii.i-p76.1"></span>,
that, when the Spirit of God has been sent forth, the whole face of the
earth is renewed, and those fields which formerly were burnt up with
thirst are green and flourish, just as the herbs grow, after having been
watered by the rains. By these metaphors he extends the view of this
subject, and more fully shews that it is quite as easy for God to
enlarge by additional offspring the Church, which was desolate, and
which had been reduced to ruinous and frightful solitude, as to impart
to the earth the power of bringing forth. Yet, though he does not speak
of regeneration, still we may apply to it this statement; because he
speaks of the restoration of the Church, the chief part of which is the
new creature by which the Lord restores his image in the elect. This
doctrine may indeed be drawn from it and more copiously explained, but
we must first explain the Prophet’s design, and lay open the plain and
natural meaning of his words.

<span id="xiii.i-p77"></span><span id="xiii.i-p77.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p78"></span>**5.** *One shall say.* Hitherto the
Prophet has spoken metaphorically, but now expresses his meaning plainly
without any figure of speech. He shews what is the nature of that
vegetation and herbage of which he spoke. It means that out of all
nations the Lord will gather his people, and will bring into his Church
those who were formerly strangers, and will raise up and enlarge his
Church, which formerly appeared to be reduced to nothing; for all shall
flock to her from every quarter, and shall wish to be enrolled in the
number of believers, as it is also said,

<span id="xiii.i-p79"></span>“Behold Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia; that
man was born there.” (<span id="xiii.i-p79.1"></span>[Ps
87:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#004)<span id="xiii.i-p79.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xiii.i-p80"></span>That passage, though hitherto it seemed to
be obscure, through the mistakes of interpreters, is exceedingly well
adapted to the illustration of this prophecy, that believers, who might
have been terrified and ashamed on account of their diminished numbers,
(for we know that but a small number returned from captivity,) might
cherish hope of that illustrious and magnificent grace of Redemption
which had been celebrated by the prophets. To meet these views, that
Prophet, whoever he was, that was the author of the psalm, declares that
the Babylonians and Egyptians shall be citizens of the Church, and that
the Ethiopians and Tyrians, and those who formerly were strangers, shall
come for the purpose of being enrolled among the people of God. “Now,”
says he, “Jerusalem lies waste; but one day God will not only gather
those who are scattered, but will also call others from every quarter,
and will unite in one body those who are now at the greatest variance,
so that they shall boast of being citizens of Jerusalem, and shall
belong to the body of the chosen people as much as if they had been
natives.” The same thing is taught in this passage by the Prophet
Isaiah, from whom the author of the psalm undoubtedly borrowed that
sentiment.

<span id="xiii.i-p81"></span>*And another shall be called by the name of
Jacob.* The general meaning is, that there will be a vast assembly of
men, who shall be united in faith and in obedience to the one true God.
But as, in a registration, every person either pronounces or writes his
own name, the Prophet, keeping his eye on this custom, employs the
following modes of expression, — “One shall write with his hand, I am
God’s, and shall take the surname of Israel; another shall acknowledge
that he is God’s, and shall be called by the name of Jacob.” He
describes something new and uncommon, for he who formerly had nothing to
do with God shall boast that God hath adopted him. “To be called” is in
this place equivalent to the French phrase, *Se reclamer,* that is, “to
declare one’s self to belong to a person;” just as formerly, when he
spoke of women to whom the name of their husbands served for a
protection, he introduces them as saying, “Let thy name be called on
us,” that is, “Let us be named by thy name.” (<span
id="xiii.i-p81.1"></span>[Isa 4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p81.1"></span>.)

<span id="xiii.i-p82"></span>Although Isaiah appears, in this passage,
to distinguish between those who in express terms shall declare that
they belong to the people of God, and shall wish to be named by the name
of Jacob, yet both clauses refer to the same persons, because to be a
child of God, and to be an Israelite, are two things closely connected,
for God determines that the Church shall be the mother of all his
children. Yet it ought to be remarked, that none are the lawful citizens
of the Church but those who submit to the government of God. If the
Prophet had passed by the name of God and mentioned “Jacob” and
“Israel,” still we must have begun with the Head, from whom proceeds all
relationship both in heaven and in earth; but, that there may be no
remaining ambiguity, he has twice described this order, that none are
reckoned to belong to the seed of Jacob but they who obey God.

<span id="xiii.i-p83"></span>Hence we easily see what is the Prophet’s
meaning; for he shews that the Church, so long as she is destitute of
the blessing of God, withers and gradually falls into decay; but that,
when the Spirit of God has been poured out, she is quickened, and at
length gathers strength, not only for recovering her former condition:,
but so as to grow by wonderful increase beyond expectation. Let us
remember, however, that the Prophet does not speak of the order of
nature, as if the new children of the Church were born such from the
womb, because no person gains such high rank by his own industry; but
when they who formerly were aliens have been regenerated by faith, he
says that they will eagerly enrol their names, in order to testify that
they are the children of God. Thus he describes a change which surpasses
nature and all the conceptions of men, when out of the accursed race of
Adam is formed a spiritual Israel.

<span id="xiii.i-p84"></span>Some think that the Prophet here expresses
the small number of believers, when he says, “One shall be called,
another shall write;” but that argument has little weight, and even the
context furnishes an easy refutation of their error. In my opinion, we
should rather understand him to mean that the Church shall be collected
in crowds out of various and distant nations; because God will assemble
strangers under his authority, and will stir them up to boast sincerely,
and not in empty words, that they belong to his people. It ought also to
be observed, that true faith cannot stand without breaking forth
immediately into confession; for such is the import of these four words,
“To be called by the name of Israel, To write, To be known, To say, I am
the Lord’s;” for they who sincerely worship God ought not to be dumb,
but to testify both by actions and by words what they carry inwardly in
their hearts. They profess to be the servants of God, and glory in his
name during the whole course of his life.

<span id="xiii.i-p85"></span><span id="xiii.i-p85.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p86"></span>**6.** *Thus saith Jehovah.* The Prophet
now does nothing else than confirm the preceding doctrine, which was
highly necessary; for the hearts of men, being prone to distrust, are
easily dismayed by adversity, and may be encouraged by one or more
exhortations. It was not superfluous, therefore, to employ many words in
confirming them; because we never ascribe as much as we ought to ascribe
to the power of God, but are distracted by a variety of thoughts, and
are too strongly attached to the present state of things.

<span id="xiii.i-p87"></span>*The King of Israel, and his Redeemer.*
After having made use of the unutterable name of God, the Prophet calls
him also “King” and “Redeemer;” because it is not enough that we
perceive the power of God, if we are not convinced of his good-will
towards us. In order, therefore, that his promises may produce their
proper effect upon us, he mentions not only his glory, but also his
goodness, that we may know that it extends to us. It might be thought
absurd that he called him “King,” while there was scarcely any people;
but believers ought to rely on this promise, that they might behold the
kingdom by faith, and contemplate it as future, though they did not
behold it with their eyes. And indeed this doctrine would never have
penetrated their hearts, when they were reduced to the greatest
extremity, and were almost overwhelmed with despair, if the way had not
been opened by’ this preface. But when God familiarly addresses us, and
declares that he is united to us, fairly, allured by so gentle an
invitation, rises up out of hell itself.

<span id="xiii.i-p88"></span>*I am the first.* By these words he does
not assert God’s eternity, but shews that He is always like himself,
that they may hope that He will be to them in future what they have
found him to be in the past. But why, it may be asked, does he speak in
this manner to believers, who knew it well? I reply, though men believe
God, yet they do not acknowledge him to be what he is, and sometimes
ascribe less to him than to the creature. The Prophet, therefore, wishes
that our minds should be pure and free from every false imagination, and
that we should raise them to heaven, that they may be altogether fixed
on God alone. Besides, it was necessary that the people, who had been so
terribly distressed, should be fortified against such violent attacks,
that they might firmly keep their ground.

<span id="xiii.i-p89"></span><span id="xiii.i-p89.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p90"></span>**7.** *And who as I?* Here the Lord
compares himself with idols, as we have already seen in another passage.
In the present instance the object is, that, when they were fiercely
insulted by the Babylonian conquerors, they might not be discouraged, or
think that their hopes were disappointed; for the taunts which were
hurled at them by wicked men were exceedingly harsh and insolent. “Where
is their God?” (<span id="xiii.i-p90.1"></span>[Ps
79:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa079.htm#010)<span id="xiii.i-p90.1"></span>..md)
“Why does he not assist you?” Such blasphemies might shake the minds of
believers, and disturb them in such a manner that they would throw away
hope and confidence; and therefore the Prophet dwells more earnestly on
this matter, in order to confirm believers more and more. That mournful
calamity of the nation was like a dark cloud, which prevented believers
from seeing the face of God; and in the meantime unbelievers danced for
joy, as if the power of their gods had shone forth in full brightness.
In order to dispel that darkness of error, the Prophet shows that still
undoubted marks and proofs of the glory of God are distinctly visible,
so as to distinguish him from idols; that is, because in due time he
publicly made known what was future, that the Jews might recognize him
to be a righteous Judge in chastisements, and yet might hope that he
would be reconciled and gracious.

<span id="xiii.i-p91"></span>*Shall call.* The word *call* may be taken
in two senses, so as to refer either to foreknowledge or to action; for,
as God governs all things by his providence, so he knows everything that
is future, and gives evidence of his foreknowledge. It is unnecessary to
give ourselves much trouble about the meaning of this word, for it is
very evident that the Prophet ascribes to God both the foreknowledge and
the government of all things. But for my own part, I rather think that
it refers to action. “Shall there be found among the gods of the nations
any one that can *call,* that is, raise up, announce, and appoint
deliverers? Does not this plainly shew that I alone am God?” Thus he
defies idols, to whom groundlessly men ascribe any power. By the word
which he immediately adds, *shall tell it,* he magnifies the special
grace of God, in deigning to reveal his purpose to the elect people by
the prophets.

<span id="xiii.i-p92"></span>*Since I appointed the people of the age.*
By “the people of the age” some understand all nations, the singular
number being used instead of the plural, because, as soon as the Lord
multiplied the nations, he separated them from each other, and
established that order which should last through future ages. Others
extend it to all the creatures, viewing the stars as one people, the
vegetable tribes as another, and in like manner animals as another, and
so forth. But when I examine the matter closely, I am constrained to
adopt an opposite opinion, namely, that the Lord speaks of his own
people, and calls them: ‘the people of the age,” because they are
preferred to all others. Other nations, indeed, were unquestionably more
ancient. The Egyptians boasted of their antiquity, and so did the
Arcadians and others. But Abraham was brought out of Mesopotamia, (<span
id="xiii.i-p92.1"></span>[Ge
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031.md)<span id="xiii.i-p92.1"></span>;
<span id="xiii.i-p92.2"></span>[Ac
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#002)<span id="xiii.i-p92.2"></span>,.md)
when the Chaldees were in a highly flourishing condition, and lived at
home a solitary individual, as if at his death the remembrance of him
should quickly perish, while the neighboring countries were highly
populous, and were eminent in other respects.

<span id="xiii.i-p93"></span>The antiquity of Israel, therefore, ought
not to be estimated from the number of years, or from the outward
condition of things, but from the election of God; and hence also the
foundations of Jerusalem are called eternal. (<span
id="xiii.i-p93.1"></span>[Ps
78:69](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#069)<span id="xiii.i-p93.1"></span>..md)
It is therefore as if he had said, “Before idols were framed by men, I
determined that I should have a Church, which should last for ever.”
This “people,” therefore, is the most ancient and most excellent of all,
though others may come before it either in time or in rank; for, as all
things were created for the sake of man, so all men were appointed to be
of service to the Church; so that there are none, though occupying a
higher eminence, that do not sink to a lower rank; for the Church is the
body of Christ, which nothing can exceed in antiquity or excellence. To
adopt the fables of the Jews, that Jerusalem was founded from the very
beginning, would be absurd, because in this passage there is no
reference to dates; but yet we ought to hold by this principle, that the
elect people holds a higher rank than the heathen nations, in
consequence of approaching more nearly to God, who is the fountain of
eternity.

<span id="xiii.i-p94"></span>*Let them tell.* This permission shews that
it is vain for men to expect a revelation from idols, which, if they
tell anything, delude by tricks, and by words of doubtful meaning, those
who consult them, as we have already mentioned.

<span id="xiii.i-p95"></span><span id="xiii.i-p95.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p96"></span>**8.** *Fear not.* Isaiah now explains the
reason why he formerly spoke of the power of God, that is, in order to
confirm the faith of the people. From the preceding statements he draws
this conclusion, — “Since the Lord is so powerful, and governs all
things at his pleasure, the people whom he hath taken under his
protection ought not to fear.”

<span id="xiii.i-p97"></span>*Have I not since then made thee hear?* He
next repeats what he had already said, that God not only brought
assistance secretly to the Jews, and suddenly, as if by legerdemain,
made his appearance when he was least expected, but kept their faith
alive by many predictions, and, in short, gave manifest proofs of his
fatherly kindness, so that his divinity was clearly perceived. It would
be of no advantage to us that God knows and can do all things, if it
were not also revealed how great concern he takes in our salvation.
Although, therefore, he wishes that many things should be unknown to us,
yet he communicates everything that is useful or advantageous for us to
know. <span id="xiii.i-p97.1"></span>מאז, (meaz,) *from then,* means a
long period; or, if it be thought better, it denotes an opportunity; for
the Lord reveals his secrets to the elect, when he sees a fit season;
but the former interpretation appears to me to be more simple.

<span id="xiii.i-p98"></span>*Therefore ye are my witnesses.* He means
what I have already remarked, that the people cannot plead the excuse of
ignorance for not being satisfied with one God; for he has abundantly
revealed himself to them, so as to give a testimony concerning himself.
The object intended to be gained by our knowledge of the glory of God
is, that we should profess his truth before men, as has been already
said, if we do not wish to extinguish the light which he hath brought to
us by his Spirit. Again, we cannot be “witnesses to God” if we are not
confirmed by his truth; for a testimony proceeding from a doubtful
opinion would be of no avail, and therefore we must be taught by the
Word of God, so as to have a fixed and unhesitating hope of salvation.

<span id="xiii.i-p99"></span>*And there is no strong God.*  <span
id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) In this passage, as in many others, he
applies to God the epithet *strong;* for it is not enough to acknowledge
God’s eternal essence, if we do not also ascribe strength to him. But
for this, we shall leave him nothing but a bare and empty name, as is
done by wicked men, who with the mouth confess God, and afterwards
ascribe his power to this and to that.

<span id="xiii.i-p101"></span><span id="xiii.i-p101.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p102"></span>**9.** *The formers of a graven image.*
The Lord now shews, on the contrary, how wretched idolaters are who
wander amidst their contrivances, and are not founded on the eternal
truth of God; for they have no knowledge or sound understanding. As he
justly pronounced the people, a little before, to be guilty of
ingratitude, if the proofs of the grace of God did not encourage them to
the exercise of faith, so he now arms and fortifies them against all the
superstitions of the Gentiles. Unbelievers being both very numerous and
very wealthy, he says that all are nothing,  <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) and, next, that amidst all their
magnificence there is nothing but imposture.

<span id="xiii.i-p104"></span>*And their desirable thinqs do not
profit.* Under the term *desirable things,* he includes not only idols,
but all their worship, and the ornaments, honor, and obedience which
foolish men render to them, and denotes those things by a highly
appropriate name; for since the chief object of life is to acknowledge
and worship God, (which alone is our principal distinction from the
brutes,) we ought to prefer it to all things, even to the most valuable,
so as to direct to him all our prayers, and, in a word, all the thoughts
of our heart. With good reason, therefore, does Scripture employ this
word in speaking of the worship of God; but here the Prophet speaks of
corrupt worship and the mad *desire* of idols, by which men are hurried
along; and therefore he says, that all that they desire or eagerly
perform is vain and useless. Frequently, too, this “desire” is compared
to the love of a harlot, by which men are bewitched and almost blinded,
so as not to perceive their baseness or yield to any reason. But we have
explained this under a former passage. (<span
id="xiii.i-p104.1"></span>[Isa
1:29](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#029)<span id="xiii.i-p104.1"></span>..md)
 <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md)

<span id="xiii.i-p106"></span>*And they are their witnesses.* Some
explain this to mean that the idols bear testimony against themselves,
and plainly shew how vain they are, so that they who do not perceive it
must be exceedingly stupid. But I do not at all approve of that
exposition, and prefer to follow those who refer it to the worshippers
of idols, who themselves are aware of their being so utterly vain; for
they know that they neither see nor understand anything. And in this
passage there is a contrast between the testimony of the people of God
and that of idolaters. The former will give an illustrious testimony of
the glory of God from his works and promises and predictions; the latter
will be constrained to be dumb, if they do not choose to bring forward
contrivances which have no certainty whatever, and therefore are false
and vain. Wicked men boast, indeed, of their worship with great
haughtiness, and loudly applaud themselves; but their conscience  <span
id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) is “a witness” how uncertain and vain
is all that they do, for they always tremble, and never find rest,
though their obduracy leads them to violent exertions.

<span id="xiii.i-p108"></span>They will themselves, therefore, bear
testimony against their idols; just as, if a man were to employ an
ignorant teacher, he may be a witness of his ignorance. In like manner
they will bear witness that their gods neither know nor can do anything;
for they see that they are composed of stone or wood or some other
material, and that they neither can see nor understand anything. Thus
believers alone will render a true testimony to their God, because he
knows, directs, and governs all things. The rest must at length be
*ashamed,* though now they defend their errors with mad eagerness; for
their conscience is a witness that nothing but opinion and a vain
imagination holds their minds captive.  <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md)

<span id="xiii.i-p110"></span><span id="xiii.i-p110.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p111"></span>**10.** *Who is the maker of God?* He
pours ridicule on the madness of men who dare to frame gods; for it is a
shocking and detestable thing that men should take so much upon them as
to create God. Every person certainly will greatly abhor such madness;
and yet men are blindly impelled by foolish passion to manufacture gods,
and no warning restrains them. On the other hand, they will say that
this never entered into any man’s mind, and that injustice is done to
them when they are accused of so great madness; just as the Papists in
the present day say that we slander them, when we employ these arguments
of the Prophet against them. But in vain do they rely on their
sophistical reasonings for avoiding this charge. What the Prophet says
is most true, that they are so mad as to think that they “make God;” for
as soon as the stone or wood has been carved or polished, they ascribe
to it divinity, run to it, make prayers, call upon it, and prostrate
themselves before it, and in short, ascribe to it those things which
they know to belong to God alone.

<span id="xiii.i-p112"></span>*Which is profitable for nothing. We*
ought carefully to observe this clause, which condemns as vain and
useless all the images by which God is represented. Hence it follows not
only that God is insulted, whenever his glory is changed into dead
images, but that all who procure idols for themselves lose their pains
and suffer damage. Papists allege that they are the books of the
unlearned; but this is a paltry evasion, for the Prophet testifies that
they are of no use whatever. Let them, therefore, either erase this
proof from the Book of Isaiah, or acknowledge that images are vain and
useless. Formerly he expressed something more, when he affirmed that
nothing can be learned from them but falsehood. But on this subject we
have said enough in the exposition of these passages. (<span
id="xiii.i-p112.1"></span>[Isaiah
40](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#000.md)<span id="xiii.i-p112.1"></span> and
41.)

<span id="xiii.i-p113"></span><span id="xiii.i-p113.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p114"></span>**11.** *Lo, all his companions shall be
ashamed.* Not only does he attack the workers and makers of idols, but
he likewise attacks generally all their worshippers, because they are so
dull and stupid, that as soon as the trunk of a tree has received some
new shape, they look upon it as containing the power of God. He means
that not only shall the framers of idols be punished for their
effrontery, but likewise all who have entangled themselves in the same
superstitions; for it is right that they who share the same guilt should
be subjected to the same punishment. Nor can they, on the other hand,
plead any excuse; for they see that their idols, which proceeded from
the hand of men, are dumb and vain, so far is it from being possible
that they are gods.

<span id="xiii.i-p115"></span>*Though they all assemble.* Whatever
conspiracy may *be* entered into by wicked men, yet, when they shall
come to the judgment-seat of God, they must be ashamed. Nor is it
without cause that the Prophet threatens against them *trembling* and
*shame,* because wicked men usually are haughty and insolent, and look
on all other men with scorn. They boast of their vast numbers, as the
Papists in the present day despise our small numbers, and swell with
insolence, and with amazing presumption attack God and his doctrine. In
this passage, therefore, Isaiah appeals to the consciences of wicked
men; because, although they are actuated by the most inveterate
obstinacy and rebellion, yet sometimes they are constrained to tremble,
when they ask themselves, “What are we doing?” and inquire into the
reason of their actions; for they have nothing that is firm or solid, on
which they can safely rest. They are bold so long as they are hurried on
by their rage, but when they come to themselves, and take some leisure
for reflection, they are terrified and dismayed; so that we need not be
alarmed at their rage and pride and vast numbers, for they shall quickly
pass away. Let us not therefore be moved by the conspiracies and
displays and pride and rage and schemes of the Papists, since we know
that all those things tend to their shame and destruction; for the more
haughtily they swell and exalt themselves against God, the heavier shall
be their fall, and the deeper their disgrace.

<span id="xiii.i-p116"></span><span id="xiii.i-p116.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p117"></span>**12.** *The worker in iron.* With good
reason does the Apostle here draw up a long description, in order to
shake off the stupidity and madness of superstitious people, if they can
at all be awakened, or, at least, to prevent the Jews from indulging in
similar folly who were surrounded on all sides by innumerable
worshippers of false gods; for he gives a minute and homely enumeration,
which makes it exceedingly evident that they are frantic and outrageous,
he might otherwise have condemned this wickedness in a single word or in
a few words; but this catalogue points out the fact, as it were, with
the finger, and places it before our eyes, he details the tools and
labors and industry and care of workmen, so as almost to bring it
actually before us. Men who have their errors deeply rooted by nature in
their hearts are more deeply affected in this manner than by simple
doctrine; for they cannot be roused from their lethargy but by loud and
continual cries. Every part must be delivered to them, and broken into
small fragments, and even chewed and put into the mouth, as they do with
infants, that they may receive the doctrine, which would otherwise
appear to them strange and uncommon.

<span id="xiii.i-p118"></span>*Even hungry.* He describes the eagerness
by which superstitious persons are impelled to fashion gods; for they
burn with such ardor that they cannot observe any limit or measure.
Their lust, like a gad-fly, drives them on, and causes them to rush
forward with such fury that we may justly compare that zeal to the love
of a harlot, as we have formerly said. They apply to it their whole
force both of body and of mind. This is what he means by *the arm of his
strength;*  <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) as if he had said,
“All the strength of their arms is applied to it; they work against
their natural inclinations, and scarcely take as much as is necessary
for the support of life; in a word, they spare no labor or expense to
make the gods whom they have desired.

<span id="xiii.i-p120"></span>Although he describes the constancy of
toil, by saying that they do not slacken their labor when they are
hungry, but endure hunger and thirst rather than relinquish their work,
 <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) yet we may appropriately extend
the observation to all the efforts of inconsiderate zeal. We see how the
fervent devotion, as they call it, of unbelievers, is their own
executioner; but the more laboriously they toil for their own
destruction, the more base and shameful is our slothfulness, by which we
defraud God of his lawful worship.

<span id="xiii.i-p122"></span><span id="xiii.i-p122.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p123"></span>**13.** *That it may abide in the house.*
Thus he shews the folly of such intense application; for their toil
brings no other reward than to see their idols resting indolently
without motion in the position which has been assigned to them, just, as
if a sluggard were crouching over a fire or reclining on a couch.

<span id="xiii.i-p124"></span><span id="xiii.i-p124.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p125"></span>**14.** *He shall cut down for himself:*
The Prophet expresses not only the zeal and furious eagerness of
idolaters, but also their rebellion and obstinacy; for when he says that
they *cut down cedars* and *plant pine-trees,* he shews that they
persevere very long in their madness, and are not prompted by any sudden
impulse to manufacture gods. “Not only,” says he, “do they choose trees
that are already grown, but they even plant and water and cultivate
them, and wait till they have come to their full size, so as to be fit
material for making an idol.”

<span id="xiii.i-p126"></span>When we read these things, and are
instructed concerning this shocking madness, let us know that God lays
his hand upon us, so to speak, in order to draw us back from it, and to
keep us in true godliness;. It is necessary, indeed, to meet it early,
lest longer delay should make the wound incurable; for as soon as we
have been led away by foolish desire to the practice of false worship,
there is always reason to fear that we shall be plunged into that
whirlpool. We all carry some seed of this madness, which cannot in any
way be rooted out, but continually buds and blossoms, if we are not
cleansed anew by the Spirit of the Lord.

<span id="xiii.i-p127"></span>It ought also to be remarked that, since
idolaters are impelled by so great eagerness to worship idols, we ought
to be ashamed of our coldness in the true worship of God. Let us be
ashamed, I say, that we are so negligent and cold and even freezing,
when the worshippers of idols are so ardent; and let us consider that we
must render an account. With what rage are the Turks seized, when the
question relates to the defense of the reveries of their prophet
Mahomet, for whom they gladly both shed their blood and part with their
life! By what rage are the Papists impelled to follow their
superstitions! Yet we scarcely become warm, and sometimes extinguish the
sparks of that zeal which the Lord has kindled in us. To this also
applies that expostulation of Jeremiah,

<span id="xiii.i-p128"></span>“Is there any nation that hath forsaken
its gods? But my people have forsaken me, the fountain of living water,
and have digged for themselves cisterns which cannot hold water.”  
(<span id="xiii.i-p128.2"></span>[Jer
2:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#010.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p128.2"></span>.)

<span id="xiii.i-p129"></span>This comparison, therefore, ought to be
carefully observed, that we may not be less steadfast in defending truth
than they are obstinate in falsehood.

<span id="xiii.i-p130"></span><span id="xiii.i-p130.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p131"></span>**15., 16.,** and **17.** *Then shall a
man use it for burning.* He censures their ignorance in not being taught
by manifest experience that a trunk of wood is not God, and even
reproves their ingratitude in defrauding of the honor due to him the
true God, whose power is illustriously displayed in the trees
themselves; for the wood cannot be applied to various uses without
bringing before our *eyes* the bounty of God. Whenever bread is baked in
the oven, or flesh is seethed in the pot, or meat is roasted on the
coals; whenever we warm ourselves, or obtain any advantage whatever from
wood, our stupidity is inexcusable, if we do not consider how
bountifully God hath provided for us, that we should not want anything
necessary for us. Such is the meaning of these words —

<span id="xiii.i-p132"></span>*Aha! I am warm.* These words express the
gladness of those who, freed from all uneasiness and annoyance, utter
what may be called the language of triumph. What can be more base or
foolish than that men, while they are pleasantly enjoying God’s
benefits, should flatter and applaud themselves, and at the same time
should not thank the author, and should even abuse his abundant wealth
for the purpose of dishonoring him? In cooking their victuals, and in
other conveniences, men perceive that the wood is subject to their
control and devoted to their use; how comes it then that they bow down
before a piece of wood that has the shape of a man? Is not God in this
maimer robbed of his right? And when men call upon images, do they not
defraud God of that sacrifice which he chiefly demands? Even heathen
writers long ago laughed at this folly, that men ventured to form gods
according to their own fancy out of corruptible matter which they
formerly despised. Hence came that jest of Horace, “Once I was a trunk
of a fig-tree, a useless piece of wood, when a carpenter, uncertain
whether to make a bench or a Priapus, preferred that I should be a god;
and so I became a god.”  <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) But
they did not actually know the fountain of impiety, because they did not
apply their minds to consider the goodness and power of One God, which
is displayed in all the creatures.

<span id="xiii.i-p135"></span>When the Prophet thus attacked the
worshippers of idols, and laid open their stupidity and madness, they
undoubtedly complained that they were unjustly defamed, and endeavored
to cloak their errors under plausible pretexts, that they acknowledged
that their gods were in heaven, as even their writings shewed, and did
not mean that wood or stone is God, in the same manner as the Papists,
in arguing against us, defend the same cause with them, and absolutely
refuse to be condemned for such gross blindness. But we have already
said that the Prophet does not confine his attention to the mere essence
of God; and indeed if this be all that is left to God, it will be an
idle phantom. He means that all the attributes which belong to him, his
foreknowledge, power, government, righteousness, salvation, and
everything else, remains unimpaired. Now, when wicked men set up statues
or images, and fly to them for the purpose of imploring assistance, and
whenever they place them before their eyes and address them, and think
that God hears them, do they not wickedly connect their salvation with
them? But this stupidity arises from their ignorance of the nature of
God, which is simple and spiritual, but which they imagine to be gross
and carnal. Thus their thoughts concerning him are excessively wicked,
and they east aside and stain his glory, by making it like earthly and
fading things. Nothing is so inconsistent with the majesty of God as
images; and he who worships them endeavors to shut up God in them, and
to treat him according to his own fancy. Justly, therefore, does the
Prophet attack such corruptions, and sharply censure the mad zeal of
superstitious persons, since nothing more detestable can be uttered or
imagined.

<span id="xiii.i-p136"></span><span id="xiii.i-p136.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p137"></span>**18.** *They have not known or
understood.* He concludes that it is impossible that men endued with
reason should have fallen into this mistake, if they had not been
altogether blind and mad; for if any spark of reason had remained in
them, they would have seen how absurd and ridiculous it is to adore a
part of that wood which they had burned, and which they had seen with
their own eyes consumed and reduced to ashes. But when they perceive
nothing, and listen to no arguments, they shew that they have actually
degenerated into beasts; for the expression which Isaiah uses in
reproaching them, “They have not known,” amounts to a declaration that
they are bereft of reason, and have lost all understanding; and although
many of them undoubtedly were very acute and sagacious, yet in this
respect there was abundant evidence of their brutish folly.

<span id="xiii.i-p138"></span>*For he hath smeared their eyes.* The
reason now assigned is not intended to lessen their guilt, but to shew
how monstrous and detestable it is; for men would never be so foolish,
if the vengeance of heaven did not drive them to “a reprobate mind.”
(<span id="xiii.i-p138.1"></span>[Ro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028)<span id="xiii.i-p138.1"></span>..md)
Here some interpreters supply the word “God,” and others supply the
words “false prophets,” and say that the people were blind, because the
false prophets led them astray; for their would never have plunged into
such disgraceful errors if they had not been deceived by the impostures
of those men, their eyes being dazzled by wicked doctrines. Others do
not approve of either of these significations, and it might also refer
to the devil. But as a different exposition is more customary in
Scripture, I rather adopt it, namely, that God hath blinded them by a
righteous judgment; if it be not thought preferable to view it as
referring to themselves,  <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md)
because they voluntarily shut both their minds and their eyes; in which
case there would be a change of number, which frequently occurs among
Hebrew writers. I have stated, however, what I prefer; and it is
exceedingly customary among Hebrew writers, when they speak of God, not
to mention his name.

<span id="xiii.i-p140"></span>In what sense God is said to blind men,
and to “give them up to a reprobate mind,” (<span
id="xiii.i-p140.1"></span>[Ro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028)<span id="xiii.i-p140.1"></span>,.md)
is evident from various passages of Scripture; that is, when he takes
away the light of his Spirit, and gives a loose rein to the lust of men,
so that no reasoning can restrain them. He likewise arms Satan with the
efficiency of error, so that they who have refused to obey the truth do
not guard against his snares, and are liable to be deceived by his
impostures. What then can be left in us but the thickest darkness and
gross ignorance, so that this tyrant, the father of lies and of
darkness, ravages at his pleasure both within and without? for there
will not be found in us any spark of light to dispel the clouds of
error, but, impelled by a spirit of giddiness with which God strikes the
reprobate, (<span id="xiii.i-p140.2"></span>[2Th
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011)<span id="xiii.i-p140.2"></span>,.md)
we shall be driven about in a strange manner at the will of Satan.

<span id="xiii.i-p141"></span>And yet we must not throw on God the blame
of this blindness, for he has always just cause, though it is not always
visible to our eyes; and we ought not to make anxious inquiries
respecting it, or search into his secret decree, if we do not choose to
be punished for our rashness. But frequently the causes are well known,
namely, the ingratitude of men and their rebellion against God, as Paul
plainly shews. (<span id="xiii.i-p141.1"></span>[Ro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028)<span id="xiii.i-p141.1"></span>..md)
The blinding is their just punishment, and therefore men have no excuse,
though they pretend ignorance; for they would never have been entangled
in such gross errors, if the Lord had not blinded them on account of
their sins. A very convincing argument may be drawn from the judgments
of God to the sins of men; for God is just, and never punishes any one
without a just cause, and does not blind a man, unless he deserves it,
and voluntarily shuts his eyes. The blame therefore lies with men alone,
who have of their own accord brought blindness on themselves; and the
design of the Prophet undoubtedly is to shew, that men who ought to have
been governed by God, being naturally endued with some judgment, have
been forsaken by “the Father of lights,” (<span
id="xiii.i-p141.2"></span>[Jas
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#017)<span id="xiii.i-p141.2"></span>,.md)
so that they become the slaves of Satan.

<span id="xiii.i-p142"></span><span id="xiii.i-p142.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p143"></span>**19.** *It doth not return into their
heart.* He confirms the preceding statement, and takes away every ground
of excuse, because unbelievers of their own accord cherish their
ignorance. That men are naturally careful and provident in worldly
matters, but altogether blind in the worship of God, proceeds from no
other cause than that they are abundantly attentive to their individual
interests, but are not moved by any anxiety about the heavenly kingdom.
Hence the Prophet reproves them for disregarding godliness, because,
after long windings, unbelievers do not reflect whether they are keeping
the right way, or, on the other hand, are uselessly fatiguing themselves
with wicked errors,  <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) He shews
that their slothfulness is without excuse, because they are so much
devoted to their superstitions; for if they applied their mind for a
short time to consider the matter, nothing would be more easy than to
perceive that stupidity; and, since they do not see it, it follows that
they wish to be deceived, and that they flatter themselves in their
error. They cannot, therefore, bring forward any palliation or excuse
for their guilt, and cannot plead ignorance; for they do not design to
apply their mind to the labor of investigating truth. To “return into
the heart”  <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) means “to consider
and reflect;” for no child is so ignorant as not to be a competent judge
of such extraordinary madness. Superstitious persons therefore give
themselves too unlimited indulgence, and do not err merely through
ignorance; and this vice ought not to be ascribed solely to the first
corruption of men, but to rebellion.

<span id="xiii.i-p146"></span><span id="xiii.i-p146.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p147"></span>**20.** *He* *feedeth on ashes.* This
verse also confirms the preceding statement. To “feed on ashes” is the
same thing as “to be fed with ashes,” just as “to feed on wind” is the
same thing as “to be fed with wind.” (<span
id="xiii.i-p147.1"></span>[Ho
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001)<span id="xiii.i-p147.1"></span>..md)
Both expressions are used, as on the other hand, “Thou shalt feed on
truth,” is put for “Thou shalt be fed with truth,” that is, “Thou shalt
be satisfied.” (<span id="xiii.i-p147.2"></span>[Ps
37:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#003)<span id="xiii.i-p147.2"></span>..md)
Others interpret that passage, “Thou shalt administer spiritual
provision,” and others, “Thou shalt feed faithfully;” but I choose
rather to adopt the former interpretation.  <span
id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) But here he means that men are haughty
and puffed up, but yet that they are empty and worthless, because they
are merely full of deceptions, which have nothing solid or lasting. With
such pride men will rather burst than be satisfied.

<span id="xiii.i-p149"></span>*A deceived heart disposes him.* Next, he
again includes both statements, that they are blinded by deceitful
lusts, so as to see nothing, and yet that they voluntarily and willingly
surrender themselves to vain delusions. The Prophet dwells largely on
this, in order to shew that nothing drives men to false and wicked
worship but this, that they are led to it of their own accord; and
therefore there is no ground for imputing this vice to others, since
they find in themselves the fountain which they earnestly nourish and
defend. With strange presumption they rise up against God, are puffed up
with a false opinion of their superstitions, and, in a word, are swollen
and ready to burst with pride But let us feed on the solid food of
truth, and not allow ourselves to be led astray by any delusions.

<span id="xiii.i-p150"></span>*Not to deliver his soul.* He heightens
the picture by saying that they flatter themselves in a matter so
important; for who would forgive negligence in that which relates to
salvation? We see how eagerly every person labors for this transitory
life; and when the eternal salvation of the soul is in danger, what is
more intolerable than that men should indolently slumber, when they
might save it by making exertion? A man is said. to deliver his own
soul, who by repentance rescues himself from the snares of the devil, in
the same manner as some men are said to save others, when by holy
warnings they bring back wanderers into the right way. (<span
id="xiii.i-p150.1"></span>[Jas
5:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#020)<span id="xiii.i-p150.1"></span>..md)
How comes it then that idolaters rush headlong to their own destruction?
It is because they hasten to it at full gallop, harden their hearts, and
do not permit themselves to be drawn back.

<span id="xiii.i-p151"></span>*Is there not a lie*  <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) *in my right hand?* Thus he briefly
points out the method by which men may deliver themselves from
destruction. It is by examining their actions and not flattering
themselves; for whoever is delighted with his error, and does not
inquire if his manner of life be right, will never “deliver his soul.”
In like manner the Papists refuse to inquire into the reasons for their
worship, and disguise that stupidity under the name of simplicity; as if
God wished us to be beasts, and did not enjoin us to distinguish between
the worship which he approves and that which he rejects, and to inquire
diligently what is his will, so as not to approve of everything without
distinction. Everything ought to be tried by the standard which he has
laid down for us. If that be done, we shall easily avoid danger; but if
not, let us lay the blame of our destruction on ourselves, because of
our own accord we wish to perish, and do not allow ourselves to receive
any warning, or to be brought back into the right path.

<span id="xiii.i-p153"></span><span id="xiii.i-p153.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p154"></span>**21.** *Remember these things, O Jacob.*
He now applies to the use of the people what he had so often said about
the superstitions and falsehoods of the Gentiles, by which men who are
not well instructed are deceived in the worship of God. Nor does he
write these things solely for the men of his own age, but chiefly for
their posterity, who were to be carried away into Babylon, and might
have been corrupted by long intercourse with the Babylonians, and drawn
aside from the true worship of God, if the Lord had not laid upon them
those restraints. The Prophet therefore exhorts them, while they were
held captive, to bring those exhortations to remembrance, and by means
of them to strengthen their hearts amidst those grievous calamities.

<span id="xiii.i-p155"></span>*For thou art my servant. I have formed
thee.* He adds this reason why they ought to remember these promises,
and to beware of the general contagion of other men; for it would have
been intolerable that the elect people, whom God had surrounded by the
barriers of his Law, that they might be separated from others, should
freely and indiscriminately mingle with the pollutions of the Gentiles.
As if he had said, “It is not wonderful that the Babylonians should
wander in their errors, but thou oughtest to be unlike them; for ‘I have
formed thee,’ that thou mightest ‘serve me;’ I have regenerated and
sanctified thee, that thou mightest be an heir of eternal life.”

<span id="xiii.i-p156"></span>Of this creation we have stated largely,
on former occasions, that it relates to the renewal of the soul.
Scripture frequently employs this argument, “Ye have been called to
sanctification and not to uncleanness,” (<span
id="xiii.i-p156.1"></span>[1Th
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#007)<span id="xiii.i-p156.1"></span>,.md)
“Walk as the children of light” (<span id="xiii.i-p156.2"></span>[Eph
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#008)<span id="xiii.i-p156.2"></span>.md)
“in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation,” (<span
id="xiii.i-p156.3"></span>[Php
2:15](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#015)<span id="xiii.i-p156.3"></span>,.md)
and in other passages of the same kind. Here we ought to infer that we
shall be doubly punished, if it shall be found that we have quenched by
neglect or indifference the light by which the Lord hath enlightened us;
for our criminality will be far greater than that of others on whom he
has not bestowed a similar favor. Heathens shall indeed be punished, and
no excuse of ignorance shall be of any avail to them; but far heavier
shall be the punishment of those who shall abuse the grace of God.

<span id="xiii.i-p157"></span>*Do not thou forget me.* He means that it
is impossible for any who have once entered into the right path to be
led aside from it, if they are not chargeable with forgetfulness of God;
for error and delusions can never prevail, so long as the remembrance of
God is rooted in our hearts. Let every one, therefore, who turns aside
from God, and falls into superstition and impiety, lay the blame on his
own wickedness. We ought thus to observe carefully the cause of
apostasy, that is, forgetfulness of God, which gradually withdraws us
from the right path, till we leave it altogether. Besides, he reminds
them that by this remedy they will be secure against revolt, if they be
employed in constant meditation; for our minds, through their
sluggishness, easily contract rust, so to speak, which infects and
corrupts all knowledge of God till it be entirely destroyed.

<span id="xiii.i-p158"></span><span id="xiii.i-p158.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p159"></span>**22.** *I have blotted out, as a cloud,
thy iniquities.* The Lord promises to his people future deliverance; for
our hearts cannot be actually raised towards God, if we do not perceive
that he is reconciled to us. In order, therefore, that he may keep the
people whom he hath once bound to himself, he adds a promise by which he
comforts them, that they may be fully convinced that the banishment
shall not be perpetual; for God, being a most indulgent Father,
moderates his chastisements in such a manner, that he always forgives
his children.

<span id="xiii.i-p160"></span>When he says that “he has blotted out
their iniquities,” this relates literally to the captives who were
punished for their transgressions; and the consequence was, that, when
God was appeased, they would be delivered. It is a demonstration from
the cause to the effect. The guilt has been remitted, and therefore in
like manner the punishment has been remitted; for the Jews, as soon as
they have been reconciled to God, are freed from the punishment which
was inflicted on account of guilt. Yet there is an implied exhortation
to repentance, that they may not only groan under the heavy load of
chastisement, but may consider that they are justly punished, because
they have provoked God’s anger; and indeed, whenever God deals severely
with us, we ought not merely to wish relief from uneasiness and pain,
but we ought to begin with pardon, that God may no longer impute sins to
us. Yet this passage overthrows the distinction of the Sophists, who
acknowledge that guilt is remitted, but deny that punishment is
remitted, as we have already explained fully in other passages.

<span id="xiii.i-p161"></span>The metaphor of “a cloud” has the same
meaning as if the Lord had said that he will no longer pursue them in
his displeasure,  <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) or punish
them, because, when guilt has been remitted, they are reconciled; in the
same manner as when the sky has become calm, the clouds which
intercepted from the earth the light of the sun, are “blotted out” and
disappear. We must therefore reject the diabolical inventions of men,
which overthrow the whole doctrine of the forgiveness of sins, while
they openly contradict the doctrine of the prophets.

<span id="xiii.i-p163"></span>*Return thou to me.* This may be taken in
two senses, either that the Lord exhorts the people to repentance, or
that he encourages them to hope for deliverance; but both senses may
agree well. We have said that it is the ordinary practice of Scripture,
whenever redemption is mentioned, to exhort to repentance; for the Lord
wishes to bring us back to himself in this manner, that he may render us
fit for receiving his layouts. Besides, as the people, through their
unbelief, were very far from cherishing the hope of salvation, it may
likewise be taken for a confirmation, that the people may believe that
they will undoubtedly return; as if he had said, “Though thou thinkest
that I am estranged from thee, yet know that I will take care of thee.”
And I approve more this latter sense, and think that it agrees better
with the context; for the Prophet labors above all things to confirm the
promises of God, and to fix them deeply on their hearts.

<span id="xiii.i-p164"></span>*For I have redeemed thee.* He commands
the Jews to “return to him,” though their banishment stood in the way of
their expecting that he would be a deliverer; as if he had said, “Though
I appear to be estranged from you, yet trust; for I have determined to
*redeem you.”*

<span id="xiii.i-p165"></span><span id="xiii.i-p165.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p166"></span>**23.** *Praise, O ye heavens.* He now
exhorts the Jews to render thanksgiving, not only that they may testify
their gratitude, but that their own expectation of deliverance may be
strengthened; and, therefore, he enjoins believers to look upon it as an
event already accomplished, as if the Lord had already delivered them.
Such modes of address make a deeper impression on our hearts than if the
promises had been presented in a naked form. Since, therefore, believers
might doubt of their salvation, because they still languished amidst
their miseries and were almost dead, the Prophet arouses them, and not
only dictates to them a song, that they may fulfill their vows, but
shews that the word of God will be so great and uncommon that it shall
move heaven and earth and the dumb creatures.

<span id="xiii.i-p167"></span>*Burst into praise, ye mountains.* We
might simply have interpreted it, “Heaven above and earth below;” but as
he mentions the “mountains,” he gives the appellation of the *lower
parts of the earth to* places which are level, such as plains and
valleys, that all countries, wherever they are situated, may be excited
to praise and celebrate the name of God.

<span id="xiii.i-p168"></span>*For Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob.* He now
adds, that that work which he had aroused all to admire is the
redemption of the Church, and declares that the glory of God shall shine
forth in it illustriously. Besides, it is proper to remember what I
formerly remarked, that here not only does he celebrate the return of
the people to their native country, but the end is also included; for
they would be “redeemed” from the captivity in Babylon on this
condition, that God should at length collect under one head a Church
taken out of the whole world.  <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md)

<span id="xiii.i-p170"></span><span id="xiii.i-p170.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p171"></span>**24.** *Thus saith Jehovah.* The Prophet
will immediately describe in his own manner the strength and power of
God; because the bare promises would have little authority and weight,
if the power of God were not brought forward, in order to remove all
doubt from our hearts. By our distrust and obstinacy we are wont to
lessen the power and goodness of God, that is, to ascribe to it less
than we ought; and, therefore, the Prophet, by remarkable commendations,
which we shall soon afterwards see, will encourage believers to learn to
hope beyond hope.

<span id="xiii.i-p172"></span>*Thy Redeemer.* He begins by praising the
goodness and fatherly kindness with which God has embraced his Church,
and which he intends to exercise till the end; for the declaration of
his power and strength would have little influence on us, if he did not
approach to us and assure us of his kindness. We ought not therefore to
begin with his majesty, nor to ascend so high, lest we be thrown down;
but we ought to embrace his goodness, by which he gently invites us to
himself. The name *Redeemer* in this passage refers to past time,
because the Jews, who had once been brought out of Egypt, as from a
gulf, by an incredible miracle, ought to have been strengthened by the
remembrance of that “redemption” to expect continual advancement. (<span
id="xiii.i-p172.1"></span>[Ex
12:51](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#051.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p172.1"></span>.)

<span id="xiii.i-p173"></span>*And thy Maker.* He calls himself the
“Maker,” in the same sense which we formerly explained; that is, because
he regenerates by his Spirit those whom he adopts, and thus makes them
new creatures; and therefore he mentions, in passing, the former
benefits which they had received, that they may conclude from them, for
the future, that God will abide by his promises. When he added *from the
womb,* it was in order that the people might acknowledge that all the
benefits which they had received from God were undeserved; for he
anticipated them by his compassion, before they could even call upon
him. By this consolation David comforted his heart in very severe
distresses,

<span id="xiii.i-p174"></span>“Thou art he who brought me out of the
womb; I trusted in thee while I was hanging on my mother’s breast; I was
thrown on thee from my birth; thou art my God from my mother’s womb.”
(<span id="xiii.i-p174.1"></span>[Ps.
22:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#010)<span id="xiii.i-p174.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xiii.i-p175"></span>Yet here he does not speak of the favor
generally bestowed, by which God brings any human beings into the world,
but praises his covenant, by which he adopted the seed of Abraham to a
thousand generations; for they were not at liberty to doubt that he
would wish to preserve his work even to the end.

<span id="xiii.i-p176"></span>*Who alone stretcheth out the heavens.*
Now follow the commendations of his power, because he has measured out
at his pleasure the dimensions of heaven, and earth. By the word
“stretcheth out” he means that he has in his hands the government of the
whole world, and that there is nothing that is not subject to him; for
the power of God ought to be united to his word in such a manner as
never to be separated.

<span id="xiii.i-p177"></span><span id="xiii.i-p177.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p178"></span>**25.** *Frustrating the signs.* The
Prophet expressly added this, because Babylon surpassed other nations
not only in the force of arms, and in troops and resources, but likewise
in some remarkable sagacity, by which she appeared to penetrate even to
heaven. What injury could befall those who foresaw at a distance future
events, and could easily, as was commonly supposed, ward off imminent
dangers? The astrologers, who were celebrated among them, foretold all
events; and from them sprung that bastard Astrology which is called
Judicial, by which even now many persons of great abilities are led
astray. They assumed the name of Mathematicians, in order to recommend
themselves more to the approbation of the people. The Egyptians boasted
of being the authors of that science, and of being the first who taught
it; but let us leave them to settle their dispute. It is certain that
the Babylonians practiced that art from the very commencement, and
esteemed it highly, so that both the Greeks and the Romans gave to those
astrologers the name of Chaldees. Since, therefore, they placed much
confidence in that science, the Lord threatens that he will overthrow
all that belongs to it.

<span id="xiii.i-p179"></span>By the word *signs* he means the
positions, conjunctions, and various aspects of the stars, about which
Astrologers speculate; and he afterwards says that he *maketh them mad*
Some take the word <span id="xiii.i-p179.1"></span>בדים *(baddim)* to
mean *lies,* as if he had said that the divinations to which the
Astrologers pretend are nothing but absolute delusions; but I choose
rather to interpret it *diviners,* as we frequently find it used in that
sense.

<span id="xiii.i-p180"></span>It is asked, “Does he condemn the
astrology of the Chaldeans universally, or only the abuse and corruption
of it?” I reply, in this passage he merely condemns those *signs* by
means of which the Chaldeans prophesied, and imagined that they knew
future events; for the Lord declares that they are absolutely worthless.
It was not without good reason that he forbade the people to consult
Chaldeans, astrologers, diviners, soothsayers, or any other kind of
fortune-tellers, and commanded that no one who practiced that art should
be permitted to dwell among the people. (<span
id="xiii.i-p180.1"></span>[De
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#010.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p180.1"></span>.) Now, if any certain information could have
been obtained from the position and aspect of the stars, the Lord
undoubtedly would not thus have condemned that science. Since,
therefore, he forbade it without exception, he shewed that it contains
nothing but absolute delusion, which all believers ought to detest.

<span id="xiii.i-p181"></span>But the defenders of that absurdity argue
that the Lord gave the planets and stars “for signs.” (<span
id="xiii.i-p181.1"></span>[Ge
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#014)<span id="xiii.i-p181.1"></span>..md)
Granting this principle, I reply, that we ought to inquire of what,
things they are the “signs;” for we do not condemn that Astronomy  <span
id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) which surveys the courses of the
planets, in which we ought to acknowledge the wonderful majesty of God.
But we condemn men addicted to curiosity, who wish to learn from them
how long any government shall last, and what shall befall this city or
that people, or even this or that man; for they go beyond limits, and
abuse “signs,” which were not given for the purpose of being omens of
future events. I do acknowledge that we are sometimes warned by heavenly
signs, to see that we have provoked the Lord’s anger, or that
chastisements are hanging over our heads, but not to venture to give
minute explanations or conclusions, or to determine those hidden and
secret events which we have no right to search and explore. But above
all, we ought to observe the cause and origin of impiety; for, as soon
as that error prevails, that the life of man is governed by the
influence of the stars;, the judgment-seat of God is overthrown, so that
he is not the judge of the world in inflicting punishments, or in
restoring to life by his mercy those who were perishing. They who think
that the stars, by their irresistible influence, control the life of
men, immediately become hardened to the imagination of destiny, so that
they now leave nothing to God. Thus the tribunals of God are buried, and
consequently piety is extinguished, and calling on God is altogether at
an end.

<span id="xiii.i-p183"></span>He calls them *wise men,* and speaks of
their *knowledge,* by way of admission, because they boasted greatly of
the title of “wisdom,” when they uttered those things which they had
learned from the stars, as if they had been admitted into the counsel of
God; and therefore he means that those empty masks of “wisdom” will not
hinder the Lord from overturning their whole estate; for all their
contrivances and tricks shall be brought to nothing.

<span id="xiii.i-p184"></span><span id="xiii.i-p184.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p185"></span>**26.** *Confirming the word.* The Prophet
now applies to his purpose what he had formerly said; for, although he
spoke in general terms, still he had a specific object in view, to adapt
to the circumstances of the present occasion all that he said, that the
people might not be alarmed at that pretended wisdom of the Chaldeans,
or doubt that God would one day deliver them. With their unfounded
predictions, therefore, he contrasts the promises of God, that they
might not imagine that that monarchy was free from all danger.

<span id="xiii.i-p186"></span>The promise was this,

<span id="xiii.i-p187"></span>“Babylon shall fall, but my people shall
be restored to liberty.” (<span id="xiii.i-p187.1"></span>[Isa
21:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa021.htm#009)<span id="xiii.i-p187.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xiii.i-p188"></span>The Babylonians laughed at these promises,
“As if we could not foresee by means of the stars what shall happen to
us!” On this account the Lord says that he will *confirm,* that is, he
will actually fulfill what he has promised, and will accomplish those
things which could neither be foreseen nor imagined by those wise men.
What the prophets foretold, wicked men treated as an empty sound which
would quickly pass away. With this opinion he contrasts the word
“confirm” or “raise up,” by which he means that God will establish the
truth of his words.

<span id="xiii.i-p189"></span>*Of his servant.* By the word “servant” he
means all the prophets, if it be not thought better to view it as
chiefly denoting Isaiah, who announced and testified this deliverance
more clearly than all others. But it is unnecessary to limit it to a
single individual, for it related to them all, and he likewise calls
them by the ordinary name, “ambassadors” or “messengers” of God, because
he had sent many, in order to support by their common and universal
consent the faith of his people.

<span id="xiii.i-p190"></span>*The counsel of his messengers.* By the
word “counsel” he means the decrees of God, but not every kind of
decrees; for we have no right to inquire about his secret purposes which
he does not manifest by his servants, but, when he reveals to us what he
will do, we ought to receive the threatenings of the prophets with as
much reverence as if God admitted us into the most secret recesses of
the heavens. Let not men therefore dispute according to their fancy,
after God hath spoken by the mouth of the prophets. In a word, he
intended to recommend the authority of his word, which is declared to us
by the ministry of men, as if it revealed to us the eternal purpose of
God.

<span id="xiii.i-p191"></span>*Saying to Jerusalem.* After having spoken
in general terms, the Prophet applies more closely to the present
subject that certainty of the promises of God; for otherwise the people
could not have obtained any advantage from it; and, therefore, he
expressly adds the mention of “Jerusalem,” that they may know that it
shall be restored. Thus, we ought chiefly to behold in this matter the
power of God in determining to defend his Church in a wonderful manner,
and to raise her from death to life as often as is necessary. If,
therefore, we think that God is true and powerful, let us not doubt that
there will always be a Church; and when it appears to be in a lamentably
ruinous condition, let us entertain good hope of its restoration. What
is here said of “Jerusalem” relates to the whole Church; and, therefore,
if we see that she is in a ruinous condition, and that her cities are
demolished, and if nothing be visible but frightful and hideous
desolation, let us rely on this promise, that she shall at length be
raised up and perfectly restored.

<span id="xiii.i-p192"></span><span id="xiii.i-p192.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p193"></span>**27.** *Saying to the deep.* This is
generally considered to be an allegorical description of Babylon, and I
certainly do not deny that it is included; but yet I cannot think of
limiting it to Babylon, for I prefer to view it simply as denoting any
unexpected change. He shews that some great revolution will be
necessary, as if the people must be drawn out of the depths of the sea,
but declares that God will easily surmount every obstacle, for he can
easily “make the deep dry, and dry up the rivers.” In my opinion he
rather appears to allude to that former redemption, (<span
id="xiii.i-p193.1"></span>[Ex
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#029.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p193.1"></span>,) when the Lord brought the people out of
Egypt through the Red Sea; as if he had said, “I did this for your
fathers, and therefore you ought to hope for the same thing from me, and
not to imagine that a return to your native land shall be closed against
you.”

<span id="xiii.i-p194"></span><span id="xiii.i-p194.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p195"></span>**28.** *Saying to Cyrus.* This is a
remarkable passage, in which we not only may see the wonderful
providence of God, but which likewise contains a striking proof of the
truth and certainty of the prophecies. Here “Cyrus” was named long
before he was born; for between the death of Manasseh, by whom Isaiah
was slain, and the birth of “Cyrus,” more than a century intervened.
Besides, even though he had been born, who would have conjectured that
he should come from the most distant mountains of Persia to Babylon?
These things ought therefore to be carefully observed, for they shew
clearly that it was not by a human spirit that Isaiah spoke. No one
would ever have thought that there would be a person named “Cyrus,” who
should fly from the most distant and barbarous countries to deliver the
people of God.  <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md)

<span id="xiii.i-p197"></span>As to the objection made by infidels, that
those things might have been forged by the Jews after they were
fulfilled, it is so foolish and absurd that there is no necessity for
refuting it. The Jews perused those prophecies, while they were held in
captivity, in order that they might cherish in their hearts the hope of
deliverance, and would have been entirely discouraged, if the Lord had
not comforted them by such promises. These records, therefore, supported
the hearts of believers in hope and confidence; and I have no doubt that
Cyrus, when he learned that God had appointed him to be the leader and
*shepherd* for bringing back Israel, was astonished at those promises,
and that they induced him to cherish kind feelings towards the people,
so as to supply them with food and with everything that was necessary
for their journey. Thus the Lord points out the person by whose hand he
has determined to bring back his people, that they may not look around
on all sides in perplexity.

<span id="xiii.i-p198"></span>*Even by saying to Jerusalem.* This is the
conclusion, by which the former statements are confirmed, that they may
rest assured that “Jerusalem” shall infallibly *be built,* and may learn
from it how dear and precious they are to God, when they shall see the
monarchy of all the east transferred to the Persians. At the same time
he points out the end for which Jerusalem was to be rebuilt, namely,
that the pure worship of God might be restored; for he does not promise
this restoration, that men may seek their own ease or the conveniencies
of life, but that the Lord’s people may purely and sincerely call upon
him without any disturbance. This ought to be carefully observed, for
there are many who value more highly their own convenience and external
comforts than the honor and worship of God. Hence also Haggai complained
bitterly, that all were eager to build their own houses, but almost all
gave themselves no concern about the Temple. (<span
id="xiii.i-p198.1"></span>[Hag
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/hag001.htm#004)<span id="xiii.i-p198.1"></span>..md)
But it was the will of the Lord that men should care most about his
house, and that is the import of what the Prophet says, —

<span id="xiii.i-p199"></span>*And to the temple, Thou shalt be
founded.* But in the present day he does not thus recommend to us a
temple of wood or stone, but living temples of God, which we are; for
the Lord hath chosen his habitation in us. (<span
id="xiii.i-p199.1"></span>[2Co
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#016)<span id="xiii.i-p199.1"></span>..md)
Such, therefore, are the temples which must be diligently built by the
doctrine of the word, that we may lead a holy and righteous life, and
may render to God the worship which is due to him; for this is the
reason why the Lord wishes that there should be a Church in the world,
that the remembrance of his name may not perish.

discovered in the Islands of the Pacific a superstitious practice,

manfacture of an idol, the workmen scrupulously abstain from food, and
do not even drink water; which accounts for the painful exhaustion and
