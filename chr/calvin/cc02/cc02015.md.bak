<span id="xvi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 38.

<span id="xvi.i"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p1"></span><span id="xvi.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
38:1-30](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#001.md)<span id="xvi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p2"></span>**1.** And it came to pass at that time, that
Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain
Adullamite, whose name *was* Hirah.

<span id="xvi.i-p3"></span>**1.** Fuit autem tempore illo descendit
Jehudah a fratribus suis, et declinavit ad virum Hadullamitem, et nomen
ejus Hirah.

<span id="xvi.i-p4"></span>**2.** And Judah saw there a daughter of a
certain Canaanite, whose name *was* Shuah; and he took her, and went in
unto her.

<span id="xvi.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et vidit ibi Jehudah filiam viri
Chenaanaei: et nomen ejus Suah: qui accepit eam, et ingressus est ad
eam.

<span id="xvi.i-p6"></span>**3.** And she conceived, and bare a son; and
he called his name Er.

<span id="xvi.i-p7"></span>**3.** Quae concepit, et peperit filium, et
vocavit nomen ejus Her.

<span id="xvi.i-p8"></span>**4.** And she conceived again, and bare a
son; and she called his name Onan.

<span id="xvi.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et concepit adhuc, et peperit filium,
et vocavit nomen ejus Onan.

<span id="xvi.i-p10"></span>**5.** And she yet again conceived, and bare
a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare
him.

<span id="xvi.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et addidit adhuc, et peperit filium,
et vocavit nomen ejus Salah: erat autem in Chezib, quando hunc ipsa
peperit.

<span id="xvi.i-p12"></span>**6.** And Judah took a wife for Er his
firstborn, whose name *was* Tamar.

<span id="xvi.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et accepit Jehudah uxorem ipsi Her
primogenito suo, et nomen ejus Thamar.

<span id="xvi.i-p14"></span>**7.** And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked
in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.

<span id="xvi.i-p15"></span>**7.** Verum erat Her primogenitus Jehudah
malus in oculis Jehovae, ideo interemit eum Jehova.

<span id="xvi.i-p16"></span>**8.** And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto
thy brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

<span id="xvi.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et dixit Jehudah ad Onan, Ingredere
ad uxorem fratris tui, et affinitatem contrahe cum ea, et suscita semen
fratri tuo.

<span id="xvi.i-p18"></span>**9.** And Onan knew that the seed should
not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother’s
wife, that he spilled *it* on the ground, lest that he should give seed
to his brother.

<span id="xvi.i-p19"></span>**9.** Et cognovit Onan, quod non sibi
futurum esset semen: et erat quando ingrediebatur ad uxorem fratris sui,
corrumpebat semen super terram, ne poneret semen fratri suo.

<span id="xvi.i-p20"></span>**10.** And the thing which he did
displeased the LORD: wherefore he slew him also.

<span id="xvi.i-p21"></span>**10.** Displicuit autem in oculis Jehovae
quod fecit, ideoque mori fecit etiam eum.

<span id="xvi.i-p22"></span>**11.** Then said Judah to Tamar his
daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house, till Shelah my
son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his
brethren *did*. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.

<span id="xvi.i-p23"></span>**11.** Et dixit Jehudah ad Thamar nurum
suam, Mane vidua in domo patris tui, donec crescat Selah filius meus:
dicebat enim, Ne forte moriatur etiam ipse, sicut et fratres ejus, et
abiit Thamar, et mansit in domo patris sui.

<span id="xvi.i-p24"></span>**12.** And in process of time the daughter
of Shuah Judah’s wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto
his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.

<span id="xvi.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et multiplicati sunt dies, et mortua
est filia Suah uxor Jehudah: et consolatus est se Jehudah, et ascendit
ad tonsores ovium suarum, ipse, et Hirah amicus ejus, Hadullamita in
Thimnath.

<span id="xvi.i-p26"></span>**13.** And it was told Tamar, saying,
Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

<span id="xvi.i-p27"></span>**13.** Et nuntiatum fuit ipsi Thamar,
dicendo, Ecce, socer tuus ascendit in Thimnath ad tondendum oves suas.

<span id="xvi.i-p28"></span>**14.** And she put her widow’s garments off
from her, and covered her with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in
an open place, which *is* by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah
was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

<span id="xvi.i-p29"></span>**14.** Tunc removit vestes viduitatis suae
a se, et operuit se velamine, et celavit se, mansitque in ostio Henaim,
quod erat juxta viam Thimnath: viderat enim quod creverat Selah, ipsa
vero non fuerat data ei in uxorem.

<span id="xvi.i-p30"></span>**15.** When Judah saw her, he thought her
*to be* an harlot; because she had covered her face.

<span id="xvi.i-p31"></span>**15.** Et vidit eam Jehudah, et putavit eam
esse meretricem: operuerat enim faciem suam.

<span id="xvi.i-p32"></span>**16.** And he turned unto her by the way,
and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not
that she *was* his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give
me, that thou mayest come in unto me?

<span id="xvi.i-p33"></span>**16.** Et declinavit ad eam e via: et
dixit, Age quaeso, ingrediar ad to (non enim noverat quod nurus sua
esset). Illa dixit, Quid dabis mihi, si ingrediaris ad me?

<span id="xvi.i-p34"></span>**17.** And he said, I will send *thee* a
kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give *me* a pledge, till
thou send *it*?

<span id="xvi.i-p35"></span>**17.** Et ait, Ego mittam hoedum caprarum
de pecudibus. Et dixit, Num dabis pignus donec miseris?

<span id="xvi.i-p36"></span>**18.** And he said, What pledge shall I
give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff
that *is* in thine hand. And he gave *it* her, and came in unto her, and
she conceived by him.

<span id="xvi.i-p37"></span>**18.** Et dixit, Quod pignus vis ut dem
tibi? Et dixit, Sigillum tuum, et pallium tuum, et virgam tuam, quae est
in manu tua. Et dedit ei: et ingressus est ad eam, et concepit ex eo.

<span id="xvi.i-p38"></span>**19.** And she arose, and went away, and
laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.

<span id="xvi.i-p39"></span>**19.** Illa surrexit, et abiit, et removit
velamen suum a se, et induit se vestibus viduitatis suae.

<span id="xvi.i-p40"></span>**20.** And Judah sent the kid by the hand
of his friend the Adullamite, to receive *his* pledge from the woman’s
hand: but he found her not.

<span id="xvi.i-p41"></span>**20.** Et misit Jehudah hoedum caprarum per
manum amici sui Hadullamitae, ut caperet pignus e manu mulieris; qui non
invenit eam.

<span id="xvi.i-p42"></span>**21.** Then he asked the men of that place,
saying, Where *is* the harlot, that *was* openly by the way side? And
they said, There was no harlot in this *place*

<span id="xvi.i-p43"></span>**21.** Et interrogavit viros loci illius,
dicendo, Ubi est meretrix illa in Henaim juxta viam? Et dixerunt, Non
fuit hic meretrix. Illa in Henaim juxta viam? Et dixerunt, Non huit hic
meretrix.

<span id="xvi.i-p44"></span>**22.** And he returned to Judah, and said,
I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said, *that* there was
no harlot in this *place*

<span id="xvi.i-p45"></span>**22.** Reversus est ergo ad Jehudah, et
dixit, Non inveni eam: et etiam viri illius loci dixerunt, Non fuit hic
meretrix.

<span id="xvi.i-p46"></span>**23.** And Judah said, Let her take *it* to
her, lest we be shamed: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found
her.

<span id="xvi.i-p47"></span>**23.** Et dixit Jehudah, Capiat sibi, ne
forte simus in probrum: ecce, misi hoedum hune, et to non invenisti eam.

<span id="xvi.i-p48"></span>**24.** And it came to pass about three
months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law
hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she *is* with child by
whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

<span id="xvi.i-p49"></span>**24.** Et fuit, circiter post tres menses,
nuntiatum fuit ipsi Jehudah, discendo, Fornicata est Thamar nurus tua,
et etiam ecce, est gravida ex fornicationibus. Et dixit Jehudah, Educite
eam, et comburatur.

<span id="xvi.i-p50"></span>**25.** When she *was* brought forth, she
sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these *are*, *am* I
with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose *are* these, the
signet, and bracelets, and staff.

<span id="xvi.i-p51"></span>**25.** Ipsa, quum educeretur, misit ad
socerum suum dicendo, De viro cujus haec sunt, sum gravida. Et dixit,
Agnosce quaeso, cujus sint sigillum, et pallium, et virga isthaec.

<span id="xvi.i-p52"></span>**26.** And Judah acknowledged *them*, and
said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not
to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.

<span id="xvi.i-p53"></span>**26.** Et agnovit Jehudah, et dixit,
Justior me est: ideireo enim hoec fecit, quod non dedi eam Selah filio
meo. Verum non addidit adhuc cognoscere eam.

<span id="xvi.i-p54"></span>**27.** And it came to pass in the time of
her travail, that, behold, twins *were* in her womb.

<span id="xvi.i-p55"></span>**27.** Et fuit, in tempore quo parturiebat
ipsa, ecce, gemini erant in utero ejus.

<span id="xvi.i-p56"></span>**28.** And it came to pass, when she
travailed, that *the one* put out *his* hand: and the midwife took and
bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

<span id="xvi.i-p57"></span>**28.** Fuit autem, ea pariente, unus dedit
manum, et accepit obstetrix, et ligavit ad manum ejus coccinum, dicendo,
Iste egressus est prior.

<span id="xvi.i-p58"></span>**29.** And it came to pass, as he drew back
his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast
thou broken forth? *this* breach *be* upon thee: therefore his name was
called Pharez.

<span id="xvi.i-p59"></span>**29.** Et fuit, quum retraheret manum suam,
ecce, egressus est frater ejus, et dixit, Cur rupisti super to
interstitium? Et vocavit nomen ejus Peres.

<span id="xvi.i-p60"></span>**30.** And afterward came out his brother,
that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called
Zarah.

<span id="xvi.i-p61"></span>**30.** Et postea egressus est frater ejus,
ad cujus manum erat coccinum: et vocavit nomen ejus Zerah.

<span id="xvi.i-p62"></span> 

<span id="xvi.i-p63"></span><span id="xvi.i-p63.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p64"></span>**1.** *And it came to pass at that time,
that Judah*. Before Moses proceeds in relating the history of Joseph, he
inserts the genealogy of Judah, to which he devotes more labor, because
the Redeemer was thence to derive his origin; for the continuous history
of that tribe, from which salvation was to be bought, could not remain
unknown, without loss. And yet its glorious nobility is not here
celebrated, but the greatest disgrace of the family is exposed. What is
here related, so far from inflating the minds of the sons of Judah,
ought rather to cover them with shame. Now although, at first sight, the
dignity of Christ seems to be somewhat tarnished by such dishonor: yet
since here also is seen that “emptying” of which St. Paul speaks,  <span
id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) it rather redounds to his glory, than,
in the least degree, detracts from it. First, we wrong Christ, unless we
deem him alone sufficient to blot out any ignominy arising from the
misconduct of his progenitors, which offer to unbelievers occasion of
offense. Secondly, we know that the riches of God’s grace shines chiefly
in this, that Christ clothed himself in our flesh, with the design of
making himself of no reputation. Lastly, it was fitting that the race
from which he sprang should be dishonored by reproaches, that we, being
content with him alone, might seek nothing besides him; yea, that we
might not seek earthly splendor in him, seeing that carnal ambition is
always too much inclined to such a course. These two things, then, we
may notice; first, that peculiar honor was given to the tribe of Judah,
which had been divinely elected as the source whence the salvation of
the world should flow; and secondly, that the narration of Moses is by
no means honorable to the persons of whom he speaks; so that the Jews
have no right to arrogate anything to themselves or to their fathers.
Meanwhile, let us remember that Christ derives no glory from his
ancestors; and even, that he himself has no glory in the flesh, but that
his chief and most illustrious triumph was on the cross. Moreover, that
we may not be offended at the stains with which his ancestry was
defiled, let us know that, by his infinite purity, they were all
cleansed; just as the sun, by absorbing whatever impurities are in the
earth and air, purges the world.

<span id="xvi.i-p66"></span><span id="xvi.i-p66.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p67"></span>**2.** *And Judah saw there a daughter of a
certain Canaanite*. I am not satisfied with the interpretation which
some give of “merchant” to the word Canaanite. For Moses charges Judah
with perverse lust, because he took a wife out of that nation with which
the children of Abraham were divinely commanded to be at perpetual
strife. For neither he nor his other brethren were ignorant that they
sojourned in the land of Canaan, under the stipulation, that afterwards
their enemies were to be cut off and destroyed, in order that they might
possess the promised dominion over it. Moses, therefore, justly regards
it as a fault, that Judah should entangle himself in a forbidden
alliance; and the Lord, at length, cursed the offspring thus accruing to
Judah, that the prince and head of the tribe of Judah might not be born,
nor Christ himself descend, from this connection. This also ought to be
numbered among the exercises of Jacob’s patience, that a wicked grandson
was born to him through Judah, of whose sin he was not ignorant. Moses
says, that the youth was cut off by the vengeance of God. The same thing
is not said of others whom a sudden death has swept away in the flower
of their age. I doubt not, therefore, that the wickedness, of which
death was the immediate punishment, was extraordinary, and known to all
men. And although this trial was in itself severe to the holy patriarch;
yet nothing tormented his mind more than the thought, that he could
scarcely hope for the promise of God to be so ratified that the
inheritance of grace should remain in the possession of wicked and
abandoned men. It is true that a large family of children is regarded as
a source of human happiness. But this was the peculiar condition of the
holy patriarch, that, though God had promised him an elect and blessed
seed, he now sees an accursed progeny increase and shoot forth together
with his offspring, which might destroy the expected grace. It is said,
*that Er was wicked in the sight of the Lord*, (<span
id="xvi.i-p67.1"></span>[Ge 38:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen038.htm#007.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p67.1"></span>.) Notwithstanding, his iniquity was not hidden
from men. Moses, however, means that he was not merely infected with
common vices, but rather was so addicted to crimes, that he was
intolerable in the sight of God.

<span id="xvi.i-p68"></span><span id="xvi.i-p68.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p69"></span>**7.** *And the Lord slew him*. We know that
long life is reckoned among the gifts of God; and justly: for since it
is by no means a despicable honor that we are created after the image of
God, the longer any one lives in the world, and daily experiences God’s
care over him, it is certain that he is the more bountifully dealt with
by the Lord. Even amidst the many miseries with which life is filled,
this divine goodness still shines forth, that God invites us to himself,
and exercises us in the knowledge of himself; while at the same time he
adorns us with such dignity, that he subjects to our authority whatever
is in the world. Wherefore it is no wonder that God, as an act of
kindness, prolongs the life of man. Whence it follows, that when the
wicked are taken away by a premature death, a punishment for their
wickedness is inflicted upon them: for it is as if the Lord should
pronounce judgment from heaven, that they are unworthy to be sustained
by the earth, unworthy to enjoy the common light of heaven. Let us
therefore learn, as long as God keeps us in the world, to meditate on
his benefits, to the end that every one may the more cheerfully endeavor
to give praise to God for the life received from him. And although, at
the present day also, sudden death is to be reckoned among the scourges
of God; since that doctrine is always true,

<span id="xvi.i-p70"></span>“Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out
half their days,”  
(<span id="xvi.i-p70.2"></span>[Ps
55:23](../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#023)<span id="xvi.i-p70.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="xvi.i-p71"></span>yet God executed this judgment more fully
under the law, when the knowledge of a future life was comparatively
obscure; for now, since the resurrection is clearly manifested to us in
Christ, it is not right that death should be so greatly dreaded. And
this difference between us and the ancient people of God is elsewhere
noted. Nevertheless, it can never be laid down as a general rule, that
they who had a long life were thereby proved to be pleasing and
acceptable to the Lord, whereas God has sometimes lengthened the life of
reprobates, in aggravation of their punishment. We know that Cain
survived his brother Abel many centuries. But as God does not always,
and to all persons, cause his temporal benefits manifestly to flow in a
perpetual and equable course; so neither, on the other hand, does he
always execute temporal punishments by the same rule. It is enough that,
as far as the present life is concerned, certain examples of punishments
and rewards are set before us. Moreover, as the miseries of the present
life, which spring from the corruption of nature, do not extinguish the
first and special grace of God; so, on the other hand, death, which is
in itself the curse of God, is so far from doing any injury, that it
tends, by a supernatural remedy, to the salvation of the elect.
Especially now, from the time that the first-fruits of the resurrection
in Christ have been offered, the condition of those who are quickly
taken out of life is in no way deteriorated; because Christ himself is
gain both for life and death. But the vengeance of God was so clear and
remarkable in the death of Er, that the earth might plainly appear to
have been purged as from its filthiness.

<span id="xvi.i-p72"></span><span id="xvi.i-p72.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p73"></span>**8.** *Go in unto thy brother’s wife*.
Although no law had hitherto been prescribed concerning brother’s
marriages, that the surviving brother should raise up seed to one who
was dead; it is, nevertheless, not wonderful that, by the mere instinct
of nature, men should have been inclined to this course. For since each
man is born for the preservation of the whole race, if any one dies
without children, there seems to be here some defect of nature. It was
deemed therefore an act of humanity to acquire some name for the dead,
from which it might appear that they had lived. Now, the only reason why
the children born to the surviving brother, should be reckoned to him
who had died, was, that there might be no dry branch in the family; and
in this manner they took away the reproach of barrenness. Besides, since
the woman is given as a help to the man, when any woman married into a
family, she was, in a certain sense, given up to the name of that
family. According to this reasoning, Tamar was not altogether free, but
was held under an obligation to the house of Judah, to procreate some
seed. Now, though this does not proceed from any rule of piety, yet the
Lord had impressed it upon the hearts of man as a duty of humanity; as
he afterwards commanded it to the Jews in their polity. Hence we infer
the malignity of Onan, who envied his brother this honor, and would not
allow him, when dead, to obtain the title of father; and this redounds
to the dishonor of the whole family. We see that many grant their own
sons to their friends for adoption: it was, therefore, an outrageous act
of barbarity to deny to his own brother what is given even to strangers.
 <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) Moreover he has not only
shortened his brother concerning the right due to him, but he rather
spilled seed on the ground than to raise a son in his brother’s name.

<span id="xvi.i-p75"></span><span id="xvi.i-p75.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p76"></span>**10.** *And the thing which he did
displeased the LORD*. Less neatly the Jews speak about this matter. I
will contend myself with briefly mentioning this, as far as the sense of
shame allows to discuss it. It is a horrible thing to pour out seed
besides the intercourse of man and woman. Deliberately avoiding the
intercourse, so that the seed drops on the ground, is double horrible.
For this means that one quenches the hope of his family, and kills the
son, which could be expected, before he is born. This wickedness is now
as severely as is possible condemned by the Spirit, through Moses, that
Onan, as it were, through a violent and untimely birth, tore away the
seed of his brother out the womb, and as cruel as shamefully has thrown
on the earth. Moreover he thus has, as much as was in his power, tried
to destroy a part of the human race. When a woman in some way drives
away the seed out the womb, through aids, then this is rightly seen as
an unforgivable crime. Onan was guilty of a similar crime, by defiling
the earth with his seed, so that Tamar would not receive a future
inheritor.

<span id="xvi.i-p77"></span><span id="xvi.i-p77.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p78"></span>**11.** *Then said Judah to Tamar*. Moses
intimates that Tamar was not at liberty to marry into another family, so
long as Judah wished to retain her under his own authority. It is
possible that she voluntarily submitted herself to the will of her
father-in-law, when she might have refused: but the language seems to
mean, that it was according to a received practice, that Tamar should
not pass over to another family, except at the will of her
father-in-law, as long as there was a successor who might raise up seed
by her. However this may be, Judah acted very unjustly in keeping one
bound, whom he intended to defraud. For truly there was no cause why he
should be unwilling to allow her to depart free from his house, unless
he dreaded the charge of inconstancy. But he should not have allowed
this ambitious sense of shame to render him perfidious and cruel to his
daughter-in-law. Besides, this injury sprung from a wrong judgment:
because, without considering the causes of the death of his sons, he
falsely and unjustly transfers the blame to an innocent woman. He
believes the marriage with Tamar to have been an unhappy one; why
therefore does he not, for his own sake, permit her to seek a husband
elsewhere? But in this also he does wrong, that whereas the cause of his
sons’ destruction was their own wickedness, he judges unfavorably of
Tamar herself, to whom no evil could be imputed. Let us then learn from
this example, whenever anything adverse happens to us, not to transfer
the blame to another, nor to gather from all quarters doubtful
suspicions, but to shake off our own sins. We must also beware lest a
foolish shame should so prevail over us, that while we endeavor to
preserve our reputation uninjured among men, we should not be equally
careful to maintain a good conscience before God.

<span id="xvi.i-p79"></span><span id="xvi.i-p79.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p80"></span>**13.** *And it was told Tamar*. Moses
relates how Tamer avenged herself for the injury done her. She did not
at first perceive the fraud, but discovered it after a long course of
time. When Shelah had grown up, finding herself deceived, she turned her
thoughts to revenge. And it is not to be doubted that she had long
meditated, and, as it were, hatched this design. For the message
respecting Judah’s departure was not brought to her accidentally; but,
because she was intent upon her purpose, she had set spies who should
bring her an account of all his doings. Now, although she formed a plan
which was base, and unworthy of a modest woman, yet this circumstance is
some alleviation of her crime, that she did not desire a connection with
Judah, except while in a state of celibacy. In the meantime, she is
hurried, by a blind error of mind, into another crime, not less
detestable than adultery. For, by adultery, conjugal fidelity would have
been violated; but, by this incestuous intercourse, the whole dignity of
nature is subverted. This ought carefully to be observed, that they who
are injured should not hastily rush to unlawful remedies. It was not
lust which impelled Tamar to prostitute herself. She grieved, indeed,
that she had been forbidden to marry, that she might remain barren at
home: but she had no other purpose than to reproach her father-in-law
with the fraud by which he had deceived her: at the same time, we see
that she committed an atrocious crime. This is wont to happen, even in
good causes, when any one indulges his carnal affections more than is
right. What Moses alludes to respecting garments of widowhood, pertains
to the law of modesty. For elegant clothing which may attract the eyes
of men, does not become widows. And therefore, Paul concedes more to
wives than to them; as having husbands whom they should wish to please.

<span id="xvi.i-p81"></span><span id="xvi.i-p81.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p82"></span>**14.** *And sat in an open place*  <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) Interpreters expound this passage
variously. Literally, it is “in the door of fountains, or of eyes.” Some
suppose there was a fountain which branched into two streams; others
think that a broad place is indicated, in which the eyes may look around
in all directions. But a third exposition is more worthy of reception;
namely, that by this expression is meant a way which is forked and
divided into two; because then, as it were, a door is opened before the
eyes, that they which are really in one way may diverge in two
directions. Probably it was a place whence Tamer might be seen, to which
some by-way was near, where Judah might turn, so that he should not be
guilty of fornication, in a public way, under the eyes of all. When it
is said she veiled her face, we hence infer that the license of
fornication was not so unbridled as that which, at this day, prevails in
many places. For she dressed herself after the manner of harlots, that
Judah might suspect nothing. And the Lord has caused this sense of shame
to remain engraved on the hearts of those who live wickedly, that they
may be witnesses to themselves of their own vileness. For if men could
wash out the stains from their sins, we know that they would do so most
willingly. Whence it follows, that while they flee from the light, they
are affected with horror against their will, that their conscience may
anticipate the judgment of God. By degrees, indeed, the greater part
have so far exceeded all measure in stupor and impudence, that they are
less careful to hide their faults; yet God has never suffered the sense
of nature to be so entirely extinguished, by the brutal intemperance of
those who desire to sin with impunity, but that their own obscenity
shall compel even the most wicked to be ashamed.  <span
id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) Base was therefore the impudence of
that cynic philosopher, who, being catched in vice, boasted of planting
a person. In short, the veil of Tamer shows that fornication was not
only a base and filthy thing in the sight of God and the angels; but
that it has always been condemned, even by those who have practiced it.

<span id="xvi.i-p85"></span><span id="xvi.i-p85.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p86"></span>**15.** *When Judah saw her*. It was a great
disgrace to Judah that he hastily desired intercourse with an unknown
woman. He was now old; and therefore age alone, even in a lascivious
man, ought to have restrained the fervor of intemperance. He sees the
woman at a distance, and it is not possible that he should have been
captivated by her beauty.  <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) The
lust kindles him as a stallion neighs when it smells a mare. Hence we
gather, that the fear of God, or a regard to justice and prosperity,
cannot have flourished greatly in the heart of one who thus eagerly
breaks forth to the indulgence of his passions. He is therefore set
before us as an example, that we may learn how easily the lust of the
flesh would break forth, unless the Lord should restrain it; and thus,
conscious of our infirmity, let us desire from the Lord, a spirit of
continence and moderation. But lest the same security should steal over
us, which caused Judah to precipitate himself into fornication; let us
mark, that the dishonor which Judah sustained in consequence of his
incest, was a punishment divinely inflicted upon him. Who then will
indulge in a crime which he sees, by this dreadful kind of vengeance, to
be so very hateful to God?

<span id="xvi.i-p88"></span><span id="xvi.i-p88.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p89"></span>**16.** *What wilt thou give me, etc*. Tamar
did not wish to make a gain by the prostitution of her person, but to
have a certain pledge, in order that she might boast of the revenge
taken for the injury she had received: and indeed there is no doubt that
God blinded Judah, as he deserved; for how did it happen that he did not
know the voice of his daughter-in-law, with which he had been long
familiar? Besides, if a pledge must be given for the promised kid, what
folly to deliver up his ring to a harlot? I pass over the absurdity of
his giving a double pledge. It appears, therefore, that he was then
bereft of all judgment; and for no other cause are these things written
by Moses, than to teach us that his miserable mind was darkened by the
just judgment of God, because, by heaping sin upon sin, he had quenched
the light of the Spirit.

<span id="xvi.i-p90"></span><span id="xvi.i-p90.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p91"></span>**20.** *And Judah sent the kid*. He sends
by the hand of a friend, that he may not reveal his ignominy to a
stranger. This is also the reason why he does not dare to complain of
the lost pledges, lest he should expose himself to ridicule. For I do
not approve the sense given, by some, to the words, *Let her take it to
her, lest we be shamed*, as if Judah would excuse himself, as having
fulfilled the promise he had given. Another meaning is far more
suitable; namely, that Judah would rather lose the ring, than, by
spreading the matter further, give occasion to the speeches of the
vulgar; because lighter is the loss of money than of character. He might
also fear being exposed to ridicule for having been so credulous. But he
was chiefly afraid of the disgrace arising from his fornication. Here we
see that men who are not governed by the Spirit of God are always more
solicitous about the opinion of the world than about the judgment of
God. For why, when the lust of the flesh excited him, did it not come
into his mind, “Behold now I shall become vile in the sight of God and
of angels?” Why, at least, after his lust has cooled, does he not blush
at the secret knowledge of his sin? But he is secure, if only he can
protect himself from public infamy. This passage, however, teaches, what
I have said before, that fornication is condemned by the common sense of
men, lest any one should seek to excuse himself on the ground of
ignorance.

<span id="xvi.i-p92"></span><span id="xvi.i-p92.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p93"></span>**24.** *And it came to pass about three
months after*. Tamar might sooner have exposed the crime; but she waited
till she should be demanded for capital punishment; for then she would
have stronger ground for expostulation. The reason why Judah subjects
his daughter-in-law to a punishment so severe, was, that he deemed her
guilty of adultery: for what the Lord afterwards confirmed by his law,
appears then to have prevailed by custom among men, that a maid, from
the time of her espousals, should be strictly faithful to her husband.
Tamar had married into the family of Judah; she was then espoused to his
third son. It was not therefore simple and common fornication which was
the question for judgment; but the crime of adultery, which Judah
prosecuted in his own right, because he had been injured in the person
of his son. Now this kind of punishment is a proof that adultery has
been greatly abhorred in all ages. The law of God commands adulterers to
be stoned. Before punishment was sanctioned by a written law, the
adulterous woman was, by the consent of all, committed to the flames.
This seems to have been done by a divine instinct, that, under the
direction and authority of nature, the sanctity of marriage might be
fortified, as by a firm guard: and although man is not the lord of his
own body, but there is a mutual obligation between himself and his wife,
yet husbands who have had illicit intercourse with unmarried women have
not been subject to capital punishment; because that punishment was
awarded to women, not only on account of their immodesty, but also, of
the disgrace which the woman brings upon her husband, and of the
confusion caused by the clandestine admixture of seeds. For what else
will remain safe in human society, if license be given to bring in by
stealth the offspring of a stranger? To steal a name which may be given
to spurious offspring? And to transfer to them property taken away from
the lawful heirs? It is no wonder, then, that formerly the fidelity of
marriage was so sternly asserted on this point. How much more vile, and
how much less excusable, is our negligence at this day, which cherishes
adulteries, by allowing them to pass with impunity. Capital punishment,
indeed, is deemed too severe for the measure of the offense. Why then do
we punish lighter faults with greater rigor? Truly, the world was
beguiled by the wiles of Satan, when it suffered the law, engraven on
all by nature, to become obsolete. meanwhile, a pretext has been found
for this gross madness, in that Christ dismissed the adulteress in
safety, (<span id="xvi.i-p93.1"></span>[Joh
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#011)<span id="xvi.i-p93.1"></span>,.md)
as if, truly, he had undertaken to indict punishment upon thieves,
homicides, liars, and sorcerers. In vain, therefore, is a rule sought to
be established by an act of Christ, who purposely abstained from the
office of an earthly judge. It may however be asked, since Judah, who
thus boldly usurps the right of the sword, was a private person, and
even a stranger in the land; whence had he this great liberty to be the
arbiter of life and death? I answer, that the words ought not to be
taken as if he would command, on his own authority, his daughter-in-law
to be put to death, or as if executioners were ready at his nod; but
because the offense was verified and made known, he, as her accuser,
freely pronounces concerning the punishment, as if the sentence had
already been passed by the judges. Indeed I do not doubt that assemblies
were then wont to be held, in which judgments were passed; and therefore
I simply explain, that Judah commanded Tamar to be brought forward in
public; in order that, the cause being tried, she might be punished
according to custom. But the specification of the punishment is to this
effect, that the case is one which does not admit of dispute; because
Tamar is convicted of the crime before she is cited to judgment.

<span id="xvi.i-p94"></span><span id="xvi.i-p94.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p95"></span>**26.** *And Judah acknowledged them*. The
open reproach of Tamar proceeded from the desire of revenge. She does
not seek an interview with her father-in-law, for the purpose of
appeasing his mind; but, with a deliberate contempt of death, she
demands him as the companion of her doom. That Judah immediately
acknowledges his fault, is a proof of his honesty; for we see with how
many fallacies nearly all are wont to cover their sins, until they are
dragged to the light, and all means of denying their guilt have failed.
Here, though no one is present who could extort a confession, by force
or threats, Judah voluntarily stoops to make one, and takes the greater
share of the blame to himself. Yet, seeing that, in confessing his
fault, he is now silent respecting punishment; we hence infer, that they
who are rigid in censuring others, are much more pliant in forgiving
themselves. In this, therefore, we ought to imitate him; that, without
rack or torture, truth should so far prevail with us, that we should not
be ashamed to confess, before the whole world, those sins with which God
charges us. But we must avoid his partiality; lest, while we are harsh
towards others, we should spare ourselves. This narrative also teaches
us the importance of not condemning any one unheard; not only because it
is better that the innocent should be absolved than that a guilty person
should perish, but also, because a defense brings many things to light,
which sometimes render a change in the form of judgment necessary.

<span id="xvi.i-p96"></span>*She hath been more righteous than I*. The
expression is not strictly proper; for he does not simply approve of
Tamar’s conduct; but speaks comparatively, as if he would say, that he
had been, unjustly and without cause, angry against a woman, by whom he
himself might rather have been accused. Moreover, by the result, it
appears how tardily the world proceeds in exacting punishment for
crimes, where no private person stands forward to avenge his own injury.
An atrocious and horrible crime had been committed; as long as Judah
thought himself aggrieved, he pressed on with vehemence, and the door of
judgment was opened. But now, when the accusation is withdrawn, both
escape; though certainly it was the duty of all to rise up against them.
Moses however intimates that Judah was sincerely penitent; because “he
knew” his daughter-in-law “again no more.” He also confirms what I have
said before, that by nature men are imbued with a great horror of such a
crime. For whence did it arise, that he abstained from intercourse with
Tamar, unless he judged naturally, that it was infamous for a
father-in-law to be connected with his daughter-in-law? Whoever attempts
to destroy the distinction which nature dictates, between what is base
and what is honorable, engages, like the giants, in open war with God.

<span id="xvi.i-p97"></span><span id="xvi.i-p97.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p98"></span>**27.** *Behold twins were in her womb*.
Although both Judah obtained pardon for his error, and Tamar for her
wicked contrivance; yet the Lord, in order to humble them, caused a
prodigy to take place in the birth. Something similar had before
happened in the case of Jacob and Esau, but for a different reason: as
we know that prodigies sometimes portend good, sometimes evil. Here,
however, there is no doubt that the twins, in their very birth, bring
with them marks of their parents’ infamy. For it was both profitable to
themselves that the memory of their shame should be renewed, and it
served as a public example, that such a crime should be branded with
eternal disgrace. There is an ambiguity in the meaning of the midwife’s
words. Some suppose the “breaking forth” to apply to the membrane of the
womb,  <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) which is broken when the
foetus comes forth. Others more correctly suppose, that the midwife
wondered how Pharez, having broken through the barrier interposed,
should have come out first; for his brother, who had preceded him, was,
as an intervening wall, opposed to him. To some the expression appears
to be an imprecation; as if it had been said, “Let the blame of the
rupture be upon thee.” But Moses, so far as I can judge, intends to
point out nothing more, than that a prodigy took place at the birth.
