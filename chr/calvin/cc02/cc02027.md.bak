<span id="xxviii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 50.

<span id="xxviii.i"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p1"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
50:1-26](../../../bib/kjv/gen050.htm#001.md)<span
id="xxviii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p2"></span>**1** And Joseph fell upon his father’s
face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.

<span id="xxviii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Et jactavit se Joseph super faciem
patris sui, et flevit super cum, et osculatus est eum.

<span id="xxviii.i-p4"></span>**2** And Joseph commanded his servants
the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

<span id="xxviii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et praecepti Joseph servis suis
medicis, ut aromatibus condrientpatrem suum, et aromatibus condiverunt
medici ipsum Israel.

<span id="xxviii.i-p6"></span>**3** And forty days were fulfilled for
him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the
Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.

<span id="xxviii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Completi autem sunt ei quadraginta
dies: sic enim complentur dies eorum qui condiuntur aromatibus: et
fleverunt eum Aegyptii septuginta diebus.

<span id="xxviii.i-p8"></span>**4** And when the days of his mourning
were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have
found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh,
saying,

<span id="xxviii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Transierunt itaque dies luctus
ejus: et loquutus est Joseph ad domum Pharaonis dicendo, Si quaeso
inveni gratiam in oculis vestris, loquimini quaeso in auribus Pharaonis,
dicendo,

<span id="xxviii.i-p10"></span>**5** My father made me swear, saying,
Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan,
there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and
bury my father, and I will come again.

<span id="xxviii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Pater meus adjuravit me, dicendo
Ecce ego morior: in sepulcro meo, quod fodi mihi in terra Chenann,
sepelies me: nunc igitur ascendam, obscero, et sepeliam patrem meum, et
revertat.

<span id="xxviii.i-p12"></span>**6** And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury
thy father, according as he made thee swear.

<span id="xxviii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et dixit Pharao, Ascende, et
sepeli patrem tuum, quemadodum adjuravit to.

<span id="xxviii.i-p14"></span>**7** And Joseph went up to bury his
father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of
his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,

<span id="xxviii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Ascendit ergo Joseph ut sepeliret
patrem suum: ascenderuntque cum eo omnes servi Pharoanis seniores domus
ejus, et omnes seniores terrae Aegypti,

<span id="xxviii.i-p16"></span>**8** And all the house of Joseph, and
his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their
flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.

<span id="xxviii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et omnis domus Joseph, et fratres
ejus, et domus patris ejus: tantummodo parvulos suos, et pecudes suas et
boves suos reliquerent in terra Gosen.

<span id="xxviii.i-p18"></span>**9** And there went up with him both
chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.

<span id="xxviii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Et ascenderunt cum eo etiam
currus, etiam equites: et fuit turma gravis valde.

<span id="xxviii.i-p20"></span>**10** And they came to the
threshingfloor of Atad, which *is* beyond Jordan, and there they mourned
with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his
father seven days.

<span id="xxviii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Porro venerunt usque ad aream
Atad, quae est trand Jordanem: et planxerunt ibi planctu magno et gravi
valde: et fecit patrisuo luctum septem diebus.

<span id="xxviii.i-p22"></span>**11** And when the inhabitants of the
land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said,
This *is* a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it
was called Abelmizraim, which *is* beyond Jordan.

<span id="xxviii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Et viderunt habitatores terrae
Chenaaneaei luctum in area Atad, et dixerunt, Luctus gravis est iste
Aegyptiis: idcirco vocatum fuit nomen ejus Abel — Misraim, (id est
luctus Aegyptorum,) qui est trand Jordanem.

<span id="xxviii.i-p24"></span>**12** And his sons did unto him
according as he commanded them:

<span id="xxviii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Fecerunt ergo filii ejus ei sic,
quemadmodum praeceperat eis.

<span id="xxviii.i-p26"></span>**13** For his sons carried him into the
land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah,
which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace
of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

<span id="xxviii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Quia tulerunt eum filii ejus in
terra Chenaan sepelieruntque eum in spelunca agri duplici, quam emit
Abraham, cum agro in possessionem sepulcri, ab Hephron Hittaeo ante
Mamre.

<span id="xxviii.i-p28"></span>**14** And Joseph returned into Egypt,
he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father,
after he had buried his father.

<span id="xxviii.i-p29"></span>**14.** Et reversus est Joseph in
Aegyptum, ipse et frateres ejus, et omnes qui ascenderant cum eo ad
sepleindum patrem ejus, postquam sepelivit patrem suum.

<span id="xxviii.i-p30"></span>**15** And when Joseph’s brethren saw
that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us,
and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.

<span id="xxviii.i-p31"></span>**15.** Videntes autem fratres Joseph,
quod mortuus esset pater ecorum, dixerunt Fortasse odio habebit nos
Joseph, et reddendo reddet nobis omne malum, qui affecimus eum.

<span id="xxviii.i-p32"></span>**16** And they sent a messenger unto
Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,

<span id="xxviii.i-p33"></span>**16.** Propterea mandarunt at Joseph,
dicendo, Pater tuus praecepit, antequam moreretur, dicendo,

<span id="xxviii.i-p34"></span>**17** So shall ye say unto Joseph,
Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin;
for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass
of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they
spake unto him.

<span id="xxviii.i-p35"></span>**17.** Sic dicetis Joseph, Obsecro,
parce nunc sceleri fratrum tuorum, et peccato eorum: quia malum
inturlerunt tibi, nunc igitur parce quaeso sceleri servorum Dei patris
tui. Flevit autem Joseph, dum illi loquerentur cum eo.

<span id="xxviii.i-p36"></span>**18** And his brethren also went and
fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we *be* thy servants.

<span id="xxviii.i-p37"></span>**18.** Nam profecto sunt etiam fratres
ejus, et prostraverunt se coram eo, et dixerunt Ecce, summus tibi servi.

<span id="xxviii.i-p38"></span>**19** And Joseph said unto them, Fear
not: for *am* I in the place of God?

<span id="xxviii.i-p39"></span>**19.** Et dixit ad eos Joseph, Ne
timeatis: numquid enim loco Dei sum?

<span id="xxviii.i-p40"></span>**20** But as for you, ye thought evil
against me; *but* God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as *it is*
this day, to save much people alive.

<span id="xxviii.i-p41"></span>**20.** Vos quidem cogitasis adversum me
malum: Deus autem cogitavit illud in bonum, ut faceret se secundum diem
hanc, ut vivificaret populum multum.

<span id="xxviii.i-p42"></span>**21** Now therefore fear ye not: I will
nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake
kindly unto them.

<span id="xxviii.i-p43"></span>**21.** Nunc itaque ne timeatis, ego alam
vos, et parvulos vestros. Et consolatue est eos, et loquutus est ad cor
eorum.

<span id="xxviii.i-p44"></span>**22** And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and
his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.

<span id="xxviii.i-p45"></span>**22.** Et habitavie Joseph in Aegypto,
ipse et domus patris ejus: et vixit Joseph centum et decem annos.

<span id="xxviii.i-p46"></span>**23** And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children
of the third *generation*: the children also of Machir the son of
Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph’s knees.

<span id="xxviii.i-p47"></span>**23.** Et vidit Joseph ipsi Ephraim
filios tertiae generationis: eitam filii Machir filii Menasseh aducati
sunt super genua Joseph.

<span id="xxviii.i-p48"></span>**24** And Joseph said unto his brethren,
I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land
unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

<span id="xxviii.i-p49"></span>**24.** Et dixit Joseph fratribus suis,
Ego morior, et Deus Visitando visitabit vos, et ascendere faciet vos e
terra hac ad terram, quam juravit Abraham, Ishac, Jahacob.

<span id="xxviii.i-p50"></span>**25** And Joseph took an oath of the
children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall
carry up my bones from hence.

<span id="xxviii.i-p51"></span>**25.** Et adjuravit Joseph filios
Israel, dicendo, visitando visitabit Deus vos, et tolletis ossa mea
hinc.

<span id="xxviii.i-p52"></span>**26** So Joseph died, *being* an hundred
and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in
Egypt.

<span id="xxviii.i-p53"></span>**26.** Itaque mortuus est Joseph filius
centum et decem annorum: et aromatibus condierunt eum, et positus est in
are in Aegypto.

<span id="xxviii.i-p54"></span> 

<span id="xxviii.i-p55"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p55.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p56"></span>**1.** *And Joseph fell upon his father’s
face*. In this chapter, what happened after the death of Jacob, is
briefly related. Moses, however, states that Jacob’s death was honored
with a double mourning — natural (so to speak) and ceremonial. That
Joseph falls upon his father’s face and sheds tears, flows from true and
pure affection; that the Egyptians mourn for him seventy days, since it
is done for the sake of honor, and in compliance with custom, is more
from ostentation and vain pomp, than from true grief: and yet the dead
are generally mourned over in this manner, that the last debt due to
them may be discharged. Whence also the proverb has originated, that the
mourning of the heir is laughter under a mask. And although sometimes
minds are penetrated with real grief; yet something is added to it, by
the affectation of making a show of pious sorrow, so that they indulge
largely in tears in the presence of others, who would weep more
sparingly if there were no witnesses of their grief Hence those friends
who meet together, under the pretext of administering consolation, often
pursue a course so different, that they call forth more abundant
weeping. And although the ceremony of mourning over the dead arose from
a good principle; namely, that the living should meditate on the curse
entailed by sin upon the human race, yet it has always been tarnished by
many evils; because it has been neither directed to its true end, nor
regulated by due moderation. With respect to the genuine grief which is
not unnaturally elicited, but which breaks forth from the depth of our
hearts, it is not, in itself, to be censured, if it be kept within due
bounds. For Joseph is not here reproved because he manifests his grief
by weeping; but his filial piety is rather commended. We have, however,
need of the rein, and of self-government, lest, through intemperate
grief, we are hurried, by a blind impulse, to murmur against God: for
excessive grief always precipitates us into rebellion. Moreover, the
mitigation of sorrow is chiefly to be sought for, in the hope of a
future life, according to the doctrine of Paul.

<span id="xxviii.i-p57"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p57.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p58"></span>**2.** *And Joseph commanded his
servants*. Although formerly more labor was expended on funerals, and
that even without superstition, than has been deemed right subsequently
to the proof given of the resurrection exhibited by Christ:  <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) yet we know that among the Egyptians
there was greater expense and pomp than among the Jews. Even the ancient
historians record this among the most memorable customs of that nation.
Indeed it is not to be doubted (as we have said elsewhere) that the
sacred rite of burial descended from the holy fathers, to be a kind of
mirror of the future resurrection: but as hypocrites are always more
diligent in the performance of ceremonies, than they are, who possess
the solid substance of things; it happens that they who have declined
from the true faith, assume a far more ostentatious appearance than the
faithful, to whom pertain the truth and the right use of the symbol. If
we compare the Jews with ourselves, these shadowy ceremonies, in which
God required them to be occupied, would, at this time, appear
intolerable; though compared with those of other nations, they were
moderate and easily to be borne. But the heathen scarcely knew why they
incurred so muck labor and expense. Hence we infer how empty and trivial
a matter it is, to attend only to external signs, when the pure doctrine
which exhibits their true origin and their legitimate end, does not
flourish. It is an act of piety to bury the dead. To embalm corpses with
aromatic spices, was, in former times, no fault; inasmuch as it was done
as a public symbol of future incorruption. For it is not possible but
that the sight of a dead man should grievously affect us; as if one
common end, without distinction, awaited both us and the beasts that
perish. At this day the resurrection of Christ is a sufficient support
for us against yielding to this temptation. But the ancients, on whom
the full light of day had not yet shone, were aided by figures: they,
however, whose minds were not raised to the hope of a better life, did
nothing else than trifle, and foolishly imitate the holy fathers.
Finally, where faith has not so breathed its odour, as to make men know
that something remains for them after death, all embalming will be
vapid. Yea, if death is to them the eternal destruction of the body, it
would be an impious profanation of a sacred and useful ceremony, to
attempt to place what had perished under such costly custody. It is
probable that Joseph, in conforming himself to the Egyptians, whose
superfluous care was not free from absurdity; acted rather from fear
than from judgment, or from approval of their method. Perhaps he
improperly imitated the Egyptians, lest the condition of his father
might be worse than that of other men. But it would have been better,
had he confined himself to the frugal practice of his fathers.
Nevertheless though he might be excusable, the same practice is not now
lawful for us. For unless we wish to subvert the glory of Christ, we
must cultivate greater sobriety.

<span id="xxviii.i-p60"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p60.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p61"></span>**3.** *And forty days were fulfilled for
him*. We have shown already that Moses is speaking of a ceremonial
mourning; and therefore he does not prescribe it as a law, or produce it
as an example which it is right for us to follow. For, by the laws,
certain days were appointed, in order that time might be given for the
moderating of grief in some degree; yet something also was conceded to
ambition. Another rule, however, for restraining grief is given to us by
the Lord. And Joseph stooped, more than he ought, to the perverted
manners of the Egyptians; for the world affects to believe that whatever
is customary is lawful; so that what generally prevails, carries along
everything it meets, like a violent inundation. The seventy days which
Moses sets apart to solemn mourning, Herodotus, in his second book,
assigns to the embalming. But Diodorus writes that the seasoning of the
body was completed in thirty days. Both authors diligently describe the
method of embalming. And though I will not deny that, in the course of
time, the skill and industry in practicing this art increased, yet it
appears to me probable that this method of proceeding was handed down
from the fathers.  <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md)

<span id="xxviii.i-p63"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p63.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p64"></span>**4.** *Joseph spake unto the house of
Pharaoh*. A brief narration is here inserted of the permission obtained
for Joseph, that, with the goodwill and leave of the king, he might
convey his father’s remains to the sepulcher of the double cave. Now,
though he himself enjoyed no common decree of favor, he yet makes use of
the courtiers as his intercessors. Why did he act thus, unless on the
ground that the affair was in itself odious to the people? For nothing
(as we have said before) was less tolerable to the Egyptians, than that
their land, of the sanctity of which they made their especial boast,
should be despised. Therefore Joseph, in order to transfer the offense
from himself to another, pleads necessity: as if he would say, that the
burying of his father was not left to his own choice, because Jacob had
laid him under obligation as to the mode of doing it, by the imposition
of an oath. Wherefore, we see that he was oppressed by servile fear, so
that he did not dare frankly and boldly to profess his own faith; since
he is compelled to act a part, in order to transfer to the deceased
whatever odium might attend the transaction. Now, whereas a more simple
and upright confession of faith is required of the sons of God, let none
of us seek refuge under such pretexts: but rather let us learn to ask of
the Lord the spirit of fortitude and constancy which shall direct us to
bear our testimony to true religion. Yet if men allow us the free
profession of religion, let us give thanks for it. Now, seeing that
Joseph did not dare to move his foot, except by permission of the king,
we infer hence, that he was bound by his splendid fortune, as by golden
fetters. And truly, such is the condition of all who are advanced to
honor and favor in royal courts; so that there is nothing better for men
of sane mind, than to be content with a private condition. Joseph also
mitigates the offense which he feared he was giving, by another
circumstance, when he says, that the desire to be buried in the land of
Canaan was not one which had recently entered into his father’s mind,
because he had dug his grave there long before; whence it follows that
he had not been induced to do so by any disgust taken against the land
of Egypt.

<span id="xxviii.i-p65"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p65.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p66"></span>**6.** *And Pharaoh said*. We have seen
that Joseph adopts a middle course. For he was not willing utterly to
fail in his duty; yet, by catching at a pretext founded on the command
of his father, he did not conduct himself with sufficient firmness. It
is possible that Pharaoh was inclined, by the modesty of his manner,
more easily to assent to his requests. Yet this cowardice is not, on
this account, so sanctioned that the sons of God are at liberty to
indulge themselves in it: for if they intrepidly follow where duty
calls, the Lord will give the issue which is desired, beyond all
expectation. For, although, humanly speaking, Joseph’s bland submission
succeeded prosperously, it is nevertheless certain that the proud mind
of the king was influenced by God to concede thus benignantly what had
been desired. It is also to be observed, what great respect for an oath
prevailed among blind unbelievers. For, though Pharaoh himself had not
sworn, he still deemed it unlawful for him to violate, by his own
authority, the pledge given by another. But at this day, reverence for
God has become so far extinct, that men commonly regard it as a mere
trifle to deceive, on one side or another, under the name of God. But
such unbridled license, which even Pharaoh himself denounces, shall not
escape the judgment of God with impunity.

<span id="xxviii.i-p67"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p67.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p68"></span>**7.** *And Joseph went up*. Moses gives
a full account of the burial. What he relates concerning the renewed
mourning of Joseph and his brethren, as well as of the Egyptians, ought
by no means to be established as a rule among ourselves. For we know,
that since our flesh has no self government, men commonly exceed bounds
both in sorrowing and in rejoicing. The tumultuous glamour, which the
inhabitants of the place admired, cannot be excused. And although Joseph
had a right end in view, when he fixed the mourning to last through
seven successive days, yet this excess was not free from blame.
Nevertheless, it was not without reason that the Lord caused this
funeral to be thus honorably celebrated: for it was of great consequence
that a kind of sublime trophy should be raised, which might transmit to
posterity the memory of Jacob’s faith. If he had been buried privately,
and in a common manner, his fame would soon have been extinguished; but
now, unless men willfully blind themselves, they have continually before
their eyes a noble example, which may cherish the hope of the promised
inheritance: they perceive, as it were, the standard of that deliverance
erected, Which shall take place in the fullness of time. Wherefore, we
are not here to consider the honor of the deceased so much as the
benefit of the living. Even the Egyptians, not knowing what they do,
bear a torch before the Israelites, to teach them to keep the course of
their divine calling: the Canaanites do the same, when they distinguish
the place by a new name; for hence it came to pass that the knowledge of
the covenant of the Lord flourished afresh.  <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md)

<span id="xxviii.i-p70"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p70.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p71"></span>**14.** *And Joseph returned*. Although
Joseph and the rest had left so many pledges in Egypt, that it would be
necessary for them to return; it is yet probable that they were rather
drawn back thither by the oracle of God. For God never permitted them to
choose an abode at their own will; but as he had before led Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob in their journeying, so he held their sons shut up in
the land of Goshen, as within barriers. And there is no doubt that the
holy fathers left that oracle which we have in the fifteenth chapter and
the thirteenth verse, <span id="xxviii.i-p71.1"></span>[Ge
15:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#013.md)<span id="xxviii.i-p71.1"></span>
to their sons, to be kept in faithful custody as a precious treasure.
 <span id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) They return, therefore, into
Egypt, not only because they were compelled by present necessity, but
because it was not lawful for them to shake off with the hand, the yoke
which God had put upon their necks. But if the Lord does not hold all
men bound by voluntary obedience to himself, he nevertheless holds their
minds by his secret rein, that they may not withdraw themselves from his
government; nor can we form any other conjecture than that they were
restrained by his fear, so that even when admonished of the tyrannical
oppression which was coming upon them, they did not attempt to make
their escape. We know that their disposition was not so mild as to
prevent them from rebelling against lighter burdens. Wherefore, on this
point, a special sense of religious obligation subdued them, so that
they prepared themselves quietly and silently to endure the hardest
servitude.

<span id="xxviii.i-p74"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p74.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p75"></span>**15.** *And when, Joseph’s brethren saw
that their father was dead*. Moses here relates, that the sons of Jacob,
after the death of their father, were apprehensive lest Joseph should
take vengeance for the injury they had done him. And whence this fear,
but because they form their judgment of him according to their own
disposition? That they had found him so placable they do not attribute
to true piety towards God, nor do they account it a special gift of the
Spirit: but rather, they imagine that, out of respect to his father
alone, he had hitherto been so far restrained, as barely to postpone his
revenge. But, by such perverse judgment, they do a great injury to one
who, by the liberality of his treatment, had borne them witness that his
mind was free from all hatred and malevolence. Part of the injurious
surmise reflected even upon God, whose special grace had shone forth in
the moderation of Joseph. Hence, however, we gather, that guilty
consciences are so disturbed by blind and unreasonable fears, that they
stumble in broad day-light. Joseph had absolved his brethren from the
crime they had committed against him; but they are so agitated by guilty
compunctions, that they voluntarily become their own tormentors. And
they have not themselves to thank, that they did not bring down upon
themselves the very punishment which had been remitted; because the mind
of Joseph might well have been wounded by their distrust. For, what
could they mean by still malignantly suspecting him to whose compassion
they had again and again owed their lives? Yet I do not doubt, that long
ago they had repented of their wickedness, but, perhaps, because they
had not yet been sufficiently purified, the Lord suffered them to be
tortured with anxiety and trouble: first, to make them a proof to
others, that an evil conscience is its own tormentor, and, then, to
humble them under a renewed sense of their own guilt; for, when they
regard themselves as obnoxious to their brother’s judgment, they cannot
forget, unless they are worse than senseless, the celestial tribunal of
God. What Solomon says, we see daily fulfilled, that the wicked flee
when no man pursueth; (<span id="xxviii.i-p75.1"></span>[Pr
28:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro028.htm#001.md)<span
id="xxviii.i-p75.1"></span>;) but, in this way, God compels the
fugitives to give up their account. They would desire, in their supine
torpor, to deceive both God and men; and they bring upon their minds, as
far as they are able, the callousness of obstinacy: in the mean time,
whether they will or no, they are made to tremble at the sound of a
falling leaf, lest their carnal security should obliterate their sense
of the judgment of God. (<span id="xxviii.i-p75.2"></span>[Le
26:36](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#036.md)<span
id="xxviii.i-p75.2"></span>.) Nothing is more desirable than a tranquil
mind. While God deprives the wicked of this singular benefit, which is
desired by all, he invites us to cultivate integrity. But especially,
seeing that the patriarchs, who were already affected with penitence for
their wickedness, are yet thus severely awakened, a long time
afterwards, let none of us yield to self-indulgence; but let each
diligently examine himself, lest hypocrisy should inwardly cherish the
secret stings of the wrath of God; and may that happy peace, which can
find no place in a double heart, shine within our thoroughly purified
breasts. For this due reward of their neglect remains for all those who
do not draw nigh to God sincerely and with all their heart, that they
are compelled to stand before the judgment-seat of mortal man.
Wherefore, there is no other method which can free us from disquietude,
but that of returning into favor with God. Whosoever shall despise this
remedy, shall be afraid not only of man, but also of a shadow, or a
breath of wind.

<span id="xxviii.i-p76"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p76.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p77"></span>**16.** *And they sent a messenger*.
Because they are ashamed themselves to speak, they engage messengers of
peace, in whom Joseph might have greater confidence. But here also we
perceive that they who have an accusing conscience are destitute of
counsel and of reason. For if Jacob had been solicitous on this point,
why did he not effect reconciliation between the son who was so obedient
unto himself, and his brethren? Besides, for what reason should they
attempt to do that through mediators, which they could do so much better
in their own persons? The Lord, therefore, suffers them to act like
children; that we, being instructed by their example, may look for no
advantage from the use of frivolous inventions. But it may be asked,
where the sons of Jacob found men to whom they could venture to commit
such a message; for it was no light thing to make known their execrable
crime to strangers? And it would have been folly to subject themselves
to this infamy among the Egyptians. The most probable conjecture is,
that some domestic witnesses were chosen from the number of their own
servants; for though Moses makes no mention of such, when he relates
that Jacob departed into Egypt; yet that some were brought with him, may
easily be gathered from certain considerations.

<span id="xxviii.i-p78"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p78.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p79"></span>**17.** *Forgive, I pray thee now*. They
do not dissemble the fact that they had grievously sinned; and they are
so far from extenuating their fault, that they freely heap up words in
charging themselves with guilt. They do not, therefore, ask that pardon
should be granted them as if the offense were light: but they place in
opposition to the atrocity of their crime, first, the authority of their
father, and then the sacred name of God. Their confession would have
been worthy of commendation, had they proceeded directly, and without
tortuous contrivances, to appease their brother. Now, since they have
drawn from the fountain of piety the instruction that it is right for
sin to be remitted to the servants of God; we may receive it as a common
exhortation, that if we have been injured by the members of the Church,
we must not be too rigid and immovable in pardoning the offense. This
humanity indeed is generally enjoined upon us towards all men: but when
the bond of religion is superadded, we are harder than iron, if we are
not inclined to the exercise of compassion. And we must observe, that
they expressly mention the God of Jacob: because the peculiar faith and
worship by which they were distinguished from the rest of the nations,
ought to unite them with each other in a closer bond: as if God, who had
adopted that family, stood forth in the midst of them as engaged to
produce reconciliation.

<span id="xxviii.i-p80"></span>*And Joseph wept when they spake unto
him*. It cannot be ascertained with certainty from the words of Moses,
whether the brethren of Joseph were present, and were speaking, at the
time he wept. Some interpreters imagine that a part was here acted
designedly; so that when the mind of Joseph had been sounded by others,
the brethren, soon afterwards, came in, during the discourse. I rather
incline to a different opinion; namely, that, when he knew, from the
messengers, that their minds were tormented, and they were troubling
themselves in vain, he was moved with sympathy towards them. Then,
having sent for them, he set them free from all care and fear; and their
speech, when they themselves were deprecating his anger, drew forth his
tears. Moreover, by thus affectionately weeping over the sorrow and
anxiety of his brethren, he affords us a remarkable example of
compassion. But if we have an arduous conflict with the impetuosity of
an angry temper, or the obstinacy of a disposition to hatred, we must
pray to the Lord for a spirit of meekness, the force of which manifests
itself not less effectually, at this day, in the members of Christ, than
formerly in Joseph.

<span id="xxviii.i-p81"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p81.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p82"></span>**19.** *Am I in the place of God?* Some
think that, in these words, he was rejecting the honor paid him: as if
he would say, that it was unjustly offered to him, because it was due to
God alone. But this interpretation is destitute of probability, since he
often permitted himself to be addressed in this manner, and knew that
the minds of his brethren were utterly averse to transfer the worship of
God to mortal man. And I equally disapprove another meaning given to the
passage, which makes Joseph refuse to exact punishment, because he is
not God: for he does not restrain himself from retaliating the injury,
in the hope that God will prove his avenger. Others adduce a third
signification; namely, that the whole affair was conducted by the
counsel of God, and not by his own: which though I do not entirely
reject, because it approaches the truth, yet I do not embrace the
interpretation as true. For the word <span
id="xxviii.i-p82.1"></span>תחת (*tachat*) sometimes signifies *instead
of*, sometimes it means *subjection*. Therefore if the note of
interrogation were not in the way, it might well be rendered, “Because I
am *under* God;” and then the sense would be, “Fear not, for I am under
God;” so that Joseph would teach them, that because he is subject to the
authority of God, it is not his business to lead the way, but to follow.
But, whereas <span id="xxviii.i-p82.2"></span>ה (*he*,) the note of
interrogation, is prefixed to the word, it cannot be otherwise expounded
than to mean that it would be wrong for him, a mortal man, to presume to
thwart the counsel of God. But as to the sum of the matter, there is no
ambiguity. For seeing that Joseph considers the design of divine
providence, he restrains his feelings as with a bridle, lest they should
carry him to excess. He was indeed of a mild and humane disposition; but
nothing is better or more suitable to assuage his anger, than to submit
himself to be governed by God. When, therefore, the desire of revenge
urges us, let all our feelings be subjected to the same authority.
Moreover, since he desires his brethren to be tranquil and secure, from
the consideration, that he, ascribing due honor to God, willingly
submits to obey the Divine command; let us learn, hence, that it is most
to our advantage to deal with men of moderation, who set God before them
as their leader, and who not only submit to his will, but also
cheerfully obey him. For if any one is impotently carried away by the
lust of the flesh, we must fear a thousand deaths from him, unless God
should forcibly break his fury. Now as it is the one remedy for
assuaging our anger, to acknowledge what we ourselves are, and what
right God has over us; so, on the other hand, when this thought has
taken full possession of our minds, there is no ardor, however furious,
which it will not suffice to mitigate.

<span id="xxviii.i-p83"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p83.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p84"></span>**20.** *Ye thought evil against me*.
Joseph well considers (as we have said) the providence of God; so that
he imposes it on himself as a compulsory law, not only to grant pardon,
but also to exercise beneficence. And although we have treated at large
on this subject, in <span id="xxviii.i-p84.1"></span>[Ge
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#001.md)<span id="xxviii.i-p84.1"></span>,
yet it will be useful also to repeat something on it now. In the first
place, we must notice this difference in his language: for whereas, in
the former passage, Joseph, desiring to soothe the grief, and to
alleviate the fear of his brethren, would cover their wickedness by
every means which ingenuity could suggest; he now corrects them a little
more openly and freely; perhaps because he is offended with their
disingenousness. Yet he holds to the same principle as before. Seeing
that, by the secret counsel of God, he was led into Egypt, for the
purpose of preserving the life of his brethren, he must devote himself
to this object, lest he should resist God. He says, in fact, by his
action, “Since God has deposited your life with me, I should be engaged
in war against him, if I were not to be the faithful dispenser of the
grace which he had committed to my hands.” Meanwhile, he skillfully
distinguishes between the wicked counsels of men, and the admirable
justice of God, by so ascribing the government of all things to God, as
to preserve the divine administration free from contracting any stain
from the vices of men. The selling of Joseph was a crime detestable for
its cruelty and perfidy; yet he was not sold except by the decree of
heaven. For neither did God merely remain at rest, and by conniving for
a time, let loose the reins of human malice, in order that afterwards he
might make use of this occasion; but, at his own will, he appointed the
order of acting which he intended to be fixed and certain. Thus we may
say with truth and propriety, that Joseph was sold by the wicked consent
of his brethren, and by the secret providence of God. Yet it was not a
work common to both, in such a sense that God sanctioned anything
connected with or relating to their wicked cupidity: because while they
are contriving the destruction of their brother, God is effecting their
deliverance from on high. Whence also we conclude, that there are
various methods of governing the world. This truly must be generally
agreed, that nothing is done without his will; because he both governs
the counsels of men, and sways their wills and turns their efforts at
his pleasure, and regulates all events: but if men undertake anything
right and just, he so actuates and moves them inwardly by his Spirit,
that whatever is good in them, may justly be said to be received from
him: but if Satan and ungodly men rage, he acts by their hands in such
an inexpressible manner, that the wickedness of the deed belongs to
them, and the blame of it is imputed to them. For they are not induced
to sin, as the faithful are to act aright, by the impulse of the Spirit,
but they are the authors of their own evil, and follow Satan as their
leader. Thus we see that the justice of God shines brightly in the midst
of the darkness of our iniquity. For as God is never without a just
cause for his actions, so men are held in the chains of guilt by their
own perverse will. When we hear that God frustrates the wicked
expectations, and the injurious desires of men, we derive hence no
common consolation. Let the impious busy themselves as they please, let
them rage, let them mingle heaven and earth; yet they shall gain nothing
by their ardor; and not only shall their impetuosity prove ineffectual,
but shall be turned to an issue the reverse of that which they intended,
so that they shall promote our salvation, though they do it reluctantly.
So that whatever poison Satan produces, God turns it into medicine for
his elect. And although in this place God is said to have “meant it unto
good,” because contrary to expectation, he had educed a joyful issue out
of beginnings fraught with death: yet, with perfect rectitude and
justice, he turns the food of reprobates into poison, their light into
darkness, their table into a snare, and, in short, their life into
death. If human minds cannot reach these depths, let them rather
suppliantly adore the mysteries they do not comprehend, than, as vessels
of clay, proudly exalt themselves against their Maker.

<span id="xxviii.i-p85"></span>*To save much people alive*. Joseph
renders his office subservient to the design of God’s providence; and
this sobriety is always to be cultivated, that every one may behold, by
faith, God from on high holding the helm of the government of the world,
and may keep himself within the bounds of his vocation; and even, being
admonished by the secret judgments of God, may descend into himself, and
exhort himself to the discharge of his duty: and if the reason of this
does not immediately appear, we must still take care that we do not fly
in confused and erratic circuits, as fanatical men are wont to do. What
Joseph says respecting his being divinely chosen “to save much people
alive,” some extend to the Egyptians. Without condemning such an
extension, I would rather restrict the application of the words to the
family of Jacob; for Joseph amplifies the goodness of God by this
circumstance, that the seed of the Church would be rescued from
destruction by his labor. And truly, from these few men, whose seed
would otherwise have been extinct before their descendants had been
multiplied, that vast multitude sprang into being, which God soon
afterwards raised up.

<span id="xxviii.i-p86"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p86.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p87"></span>**21.** *I will nourish you*. It was a
token of a solid and not a feigned reconciliation, not only to abstain
from malice and injury, but also to “overcome evil with good,” as Paul
teaches, (<span id="xxviii.i-p87.1"></span>[Ro
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#021.md)<span
id="xxviii.i-p87.1"></span>:) and truly, he who fails in his duty, when
he possesses the power of giving help, and when the occasion demands his
assistance, shows, by this very course, that he is not forgetful of
injury. This requires to be the more diligently observed, because,
commonly, the greater part weakly conclude that they forgive offenses if
they do not retaliate them; as if indeed we were not taking revenge when
we withdraw our hands from giving help. You would assist your brother if
you thought him worthy: he implores your aid in necessity; you desert
him because he has done you some unkindness; what hinders you from
helping him but hatred? Therefore, we shall then only prove our minds to
be free from malevolence, when we follow with kindness those enemies by
whom we have been ill treated. Joseph is said to have spoken “to the
heart of his brethren,” because, by addressing them with suavity and
kindness, he removed all their scruples; as we have before seen, that
Shechem spoke to the heart of Dinah, when he attempted to console her
with allurements, in order that, forgetting the dishonor he had done
her, she might consent to marry him.

<span id="xxviii.i-p88"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p88.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p89"></span>**22.** *And Joseph dwelt in Egypt*. It
is not without reason that Moses relates how long Joseph lived, because
the length of the time shows the more clearly his unfailing constancy:
for although he is raised to great honor and power among she Egyptians,
he still is closely united with his father’s house. Hence it is easy to
conjecture, that he gradually took his leave of the treasures of the
court, because he thought there was nothing better for him to do than to
hold them in contempt, lest earthly dignity should separate him from the
kingdom of God. He had before spurned all the allurements which might
have occupied his mind in Egypt: he now counts it necessary to proceed
further, that, laying aside his honor, he may descend to an ignoble
condition, and wean his own sons from the hope of succeeding to his
worldly rank. We know how anxiously others labor, both that they
themselves may not be reduced in circumstances, and that they may leave
their fortune entire to their posterity: but Joseph, during sixty years,
employed all his efforts to bring himself and his children into a state
of submission, lest his earthly greatness should alienate them from the
little flock of the Lord. In short, he imitated the serpents, who cast
off their *exuviae*, that, being stripped of their old age, they may
gather new strength. He sees the children of his own grandchildren; why
does not his solicitude to provide for them increase, as his children
increase? Yet he has so little regard for worldly rank or opulence, that
he would rather see them devoted to a pastoral life, and be despised by
the Egyptians, if only they might be reckoned in the family of Israel.
Besides, in a numerous offspring during his own life, the Lord afforded
him some taste of his benediction, from which he might conceive the hope
of future deliverance: for, among so many temptations, it was necessary
for him to be encouraged and sustained, lest he should sink under them.

<span id="xxviii.i-p90"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p90.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p91"></span>**24.** *And Joseph said unto his
brethren*. It is uncertain whether Joseph died the first or the last of
the brethren, or whether a part of them survived him. Here indeed Moses
includes, under the name of brethren, not only those who were really so,
but other relations. I think, however, that certain of the chiefs of
each family were called at his command, from whom the whole of the
people might receive information: and although it is probable that the
other patriarchs also gave the same command respecting themselves, since
the bones of them all were, in like manner, conveyed into the land of
Canaan; yet special mention is made of Joseph alone, for two reasons.
First, since the eyes of them all were fixed upon him, on account of his
high authority, it was his duty to lead their way, and cautiously to
beware lest the splendor of his dignity should cast a stumbling block
before any of them. Secondly, it was of great consequence, as an
example, that it should be known to all the people, that he who held the
second place in the kingdom of Egypt, regardless of so great an honor,
was contented with his own coalition, which was only that of the heir of
a bare promise.

<span id="xxviii.i-p92"></span>*I die*. This expression has the force of
a command to his brethren to be of good courage after his death, because
the truth of God is immortal; for he does not wish them to depend upon
his life or that of another man, so as to cause them to prescribe a
limit to the power of God; but he would have them patiently to rest till
the suitable time should arrive. But whence had he this great certainty,
that he should be a witness and a surety of future redemption, except
from his having been so taught by his father? For we do not read that
God had appeared unto him, or that an oracle had been brought to him by
an angel from heaven; but because he was certainly persuaded that Jacob
was a divinely appointed teacher and prophet, who should transmit to his
sons the covenant of salvation deposited with him; Joseph relies upon
his testimony not less securely than if some vision had been presented
to him, or he had seen angels descending to him from heaven: for unless
the hearing of the word is sufficient for our faith, we deserve not that
God, whom we then defraud of his honor, should condescend to deal with
us: not that faith relies on human authority, but because it hears God
speaking through the mouth of men, and by their external voice is drawn
upwards; for what God pronounces through men, he seals on our hearts by
his Spirit. Thus faith is built on no other foundation than God himself;
and yet the preaching of men is not wanting in its claim of authority
and reverence. This restraint is put upon the rash curiosity of those
men, who, eagerly desiring visions, despise the ordinary ministry of the
Church; as if it were absurd that God, who formerly showed himself to
the fathers out of heaven, should send forth his voice out of the earth.
But if they would reflect how gloriously he once descended to us in the
person of his only-begotten Son, they would not so importunately desire
that heaven should daily be opened unto them. But, not to insist upon
these things; when the brethren saw that Joseph, — who in this respect
was inferior to his fathers, as having been partaker of no oracle, — had
been imbued by them with the doctrine of piety, so that he contended
with a faith similar to theirs; they would at once be most ungrateful
and malignant, if they rejected the participation of his grace.

<span id="xxviii.i-p93"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p93.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p94"></span>**25.** *God will surely visit you*. By
these words he intimates that they would be buried as in oblivion, so
long as they remained in Egypt: and truly that exile was as if God had
turned his back on them for a season. Nevertheless, Joseph does not
cease to fix the eyes of his mind on God; as it is written in the
Prophet,

<span id="xxviii.i-p95"></span>“I will wait upon the Lord that hideth
his face  
from the house of Jacob.” (<span id="xxviii.i-p95.2"></span>[Isa
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#017.md)<span
id="xxviii.i-p95.2"></span>.)

<span id="xxviii.i-p96"></span>This passage also clearly teaches what
was the design of this anxious choice of his sepulcher, namely, that it
might be a seal of redemption: for after he has asserted that God was
faithful, and would, in his own time, grant what he had promised, he
immediately adjures his brethren to carry away his bones. These were
useful relics, the sight of which plainly signified that, by the death
of men, the eternal covenant in which Joseph commands his posterity
safely to rest, had by no means become extinct; for he deems it
sufficient to adduce the oath of God, to remove all their doubts
respecting their deliverance.
