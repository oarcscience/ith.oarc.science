<span id="xiv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 36.

<span id="xiv.i"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p1"></span><span id="xiv.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
36:1-43](../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001.md)<span id="xiv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p2"></span>**1** Now these *are* the generations of
Esau, who *is* Edom.

<span id="xiv.i-p3"></span>**1.** Istae vero sunt generationes Esau, hic
est Edom.

<span id="xiv.i-p4"></span>**2.** Esau took his wives of the daughters
of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the
daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

<span id="xiv.i-p5"></span>**2.** Esau accepit uxores suas e filiabus
Chenaan, Hadah filiam Elon Hittaei, et Aholibamah filiam Anah, filiam
Sibhon Hivvaei,

<span id="xiv.i-p6"></span>**3.** And Bashemath Ishmael’s daughter,
sister of Nebajoth.

<span id="xiv.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et Bosmath filiam Ismael sororem
Nebajoth.

<span id="xiv.i-p8"></span>**4.** And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and
Bashemath bare Reuel;

<span id="xiv.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et peperit Adah ipsi Esau Eliphaz: et
Bosmath peperit Rehuel.

<span id="xiv.i-p10"></span>**5.** And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and
Jaalam, and Korah: these *are* the sons of Esau, which were born unto
him in the land of Canaan.

<span id="xiv.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et Aholibamah peperit Jehus, et
Jahalam, et Corah: isti filii Esau, qui nati sunt ei in terra Chenaan.

<span id="xiv.i-p12"></span>**6.** And Esau took his wives, and his
sons, and his daughters, and all the persons of his house, and his
cattle, and all his beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in
the land of Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his
brother Jacob.

<span id="xiv.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et accepit Esau uxores suas, et
filios suos, et filias suas, et omnes animas domus suae, et pecudes
suas, et omnia jumenta sua, et omnem acquisitionem suam, quam
acquisierat in terra Chenaan: et profectus est ad aaliam terram a facie
Iahacob fratris sui.

<span id="xiv.i-p14"></span>**7.** For their riches were more than that
they might dwell together; and the land wherein they were strangers
could not bear them because of their cattle.

<span id="xiv.i-p15"></span>**7.** Erat enim substantia eorum multa, ita
ut nequirent habitare pariter: nec poterat terra peregrinationum eorum
ferre eos propter substantiam eorum.

<span id="xiv.i-p16"></span>**8.** Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau
*is* Edom.

<span id="xiv.i-p17"></span>**8.** Habitavit itaque Esau in monte Sehir:
Esau est Edom.

<span id="xiv.i-p18"></span>**9.** And these *are* the generations of
Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:

<span id="xiv.i-p19"></span>**9.** Ac istae sunt generationes Esau
patris Edom in monte Sehir.

<span id="xiv.i-p20"></span>**10.** These *are* the names of Esau’s
sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of
Bashemath the wife of Esau.

<span id="xiv.i-p21"></span>**10.** Ista sunt nomina filiorum Esau:
Eliphaz filius Hadah uxoris Esau, Rehuel filius Bosmath uxoris Esau.

<span id="xiv.i-p22"></span>**11.** And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman,
Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.

<span id="xiv.i-p23"></span>**11.** Et fuerunt filii Eliphaz, Theman,
Omar, Sepho, et Gahatham, et Cenaz.

<span id="xiv.i-p24"></span>**12.** And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz
Esau’s son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these *were* the sons of
Adah Esau’s wife.

<span id="xiv.i-p25"></span>**12.** Timnah autem fuit concubina Eliphaz
filii Esau, et peperit ipsi Eliphaz Hamalec. Isti sunt filii Hadah
uxoris Esau.

<span id="xiv.i-p26"></span>**13.** And these *are* the sons of Reuel;
Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath
Esau’s wife.

<span id="xiv.i-p27"></span>**13.** Isti vero sunt filii Rehuel: Nahath,
et Zerach, Sammah, et Mizza: isti sunt filii Bosmath uxoris Esau.

<span id="xiv.i-p28"></span>**14.** And these were the sons of
Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife:
and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.

<span id="xiv.i-p29"></span>**14.** Et isti fuerunt filii Aholibamah
filiae Hanah filiae Sibhon uxoris Esau, quos peperit ipsi Esau: Jehu, et
Jahalam, et Corah.

<span id="xiv.i-p30"></span>**15.** These *were* dukes of the sons of
Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn *son* of Esau; duke Teman, duke
Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,

<span id="xiv.i-p31"></span>**15.** Isti duces filiorum Esau. Filii
Eliphaz primogeniti Esau, dux Theman, dux Omar, dux Sepho, dux Chenaz,

<span id="xiv.i-p32"></span>**16.** Duke Korah, duke Gatam, *and* duke

Edom; these *were* the sons of Adah.

<span id="xiv.i-p33"></span>**16.** Dux Corah, dux Gahatham, dux

Aholibamah Esau’s wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these
*were* the dukes *that came* of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s
wife.

<span id="xiv.i-p37"></span>**18.** Isti autem sunt filii Aholibamah
uxoris Esau, dux Jehus, dux Jahalam, dux Corah: isti sunt duces
Aholibamah filiae Hanah uxoris Esau.

<span id="xiv.i-p38"></span>**19.** These *are* the sons of Esau, who
*is* Edom, and these *are* their dukes.

<span id="xiv.i-p39"></span>**19.** Isti sunt filii Esau, et isti duces
eorum: ipse est Edom.

<span id="xiv.i-p40"></span>**20.** These *are* the sons of Seir the

<span id="xiv.i-p48"></span>**24.** And these *are* the children of
Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this *was that* Anah that found the mules
in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.

<span id="xiv.i-p49"></span>**24.** Et isti sunt filii Sibhon: Ajah et

possession: he *is* Esau the father of the Edomites.

<span id="xiv.i-p87"></span>**43.** Dux Magdiel, dux Hiram: isti sunt
duces Edom per habitationes suas, in terra haereditatis ipsorum: ipse
est Esau pater Edom.

<span id="xiv.i-p88"></span> 

<span id="xiv.i-p89"></span><span id="xiv.i-p89.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p90"></span>**1.** *Now these are the generations of
Esau*. Though Esau was an alien from the Church in the sight of God; yet
since he also, as a son of Isaac, was favored with a temporal blessing,
Moses celebrates his race, and inscribes a sufficiently lengthened
catalogue of the people born from him. This commemoration, however,
resembles an honorable sepulture. For although Esau, with his posterity,
took the precedence; yet this dignity was like a bubble, which is
comprised under the figure of the world, and which quickly perishes. As,
therefore, it has been before said of other profane nations, so now Esau
is exalted as on a lofty theater. But since there is no permanent
condition out of the kingdom of God, the splendor attributed to him is
evanescent, and the whole of his pomp departs like the passing scene of
the stage. The Holy Spirit designed, indeed, to testify that the
prophecy which Isaac uttered concerning Esau was not vain; but he has no
sooner shown its effect, than he turns away our eyes, as if he had cast
a veil over it, that we may confine our attention to the race of Jacob.
Now, though Esau had children by three wives, in whom afterwards the
blessing of God shone forth, yet polygamy is not, on that account,
approved, nor the impure lust of man excused: but in this the goodness
of God is rather to be admired, which, contrary to the order of nature,
gave a good issue to evil beginnings.

<span id="xiv.i-p91"></span><span id="xiv.i-p91.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p92"></span>**6.** *And went into the country from the
face of his brother Jacob*. Moses does not mean that Esau departed
purposely to give place to his brother; for he was so proud and
ferocious, that he never would have allowed himself to seem his
brother’s inferior. But Moses, without regard to Esau’s design, commends
the secret providence of God, by which he was driven into exile, that
the possession of the land might remain free for Jacob alone. Esau
removed to Mount Seir, through the desire of present advantage, as is
elsewhere stated. Nothing was less in his mind than to provide for his
brother’s welfare; but God directed the blind man by his own hand, that
he might not occupy that place in the land which he had appointed for
his own servant. Thus it often happens that the wicked do good to the
elect children of God, contrary to their own intention; and while their
hasty cupidity pants for present advantages, they promote the eternal
salvation of those whose destruction they have sometimes desired. Let
us, then, learn from the passage before us, to see, by the eyes of
faith, both in accidental circumstances (as they are called) and in the
evil desires of men, that secret providence of God, which directs all
events to a result predetermined by himself. For when Esau went forth,
that he might live more commodiously apart from his father’s family, he
is said to have departed from the face of his brother, because the Lord
had so determined it. It is stated indefinitely, that he departed “into
the country;” because, being in uncertainty respecting his plan, he
sought a home in various places, until Mount Seir presented itself; and
as we say, he went out at a venture.  <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md)

<span id="xiv.i-p94"></span><span id="xiv.i-p94.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p95"></span>**9.** *And these are the generations of
Esau, the father of the Edomites*  <span
id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) Though Esau had two names, yet in this
place the second name refers to his posterity, who are called Idumeans.
For, to make it appear what God had bestowed upon him for the sake of
his father Isaac, Moses expressly calls him the father of a celebrated
and famous people. And certainly, it served this purpose not a little,
to trace the effect and fulfillment of the prophecy in the progeny of
Esau. For if the promise of God so mightily flourished towards a
stranger, how much more powerfully would it put itself forth towards the
children, to whom pertaineth the adoption, and consequently the
inheritance of grace? Esau was an obscure man, and a sojourner in that
country: whence therefore is it, that suddenly rulers should spring from
him, and a great body of people should flourish, unless because the
benediction which proceeded from the mouth of Isaac, was confirmed by
the result? For Esau did not reign in this desert without opposition;
since a people of no ignoble name previously inhabited Mount Seir. On
this account Moses relates that the men who had before inhabited that
land were mighty: so that it would not have been easy for a stranger to
acquire such power as Esau possessed, if he had not been divinely
assisted.

<span id="xiv.i-p97"></span><span id="xiv.i-p97.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p98"></span>**24.** *This was that Anah that found the
mules*. Mules are the adulterous offspring of the horse and the ass.
Moses says that Anal was the author of this connection.  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) But I do not consider this as said in
praise of his industry; for the Lord has not in vain distinguished the
different kinds of animals from the beginning. But since the vanity of
the flesh often solicits the children of this world, so that they apply
their minds to superfluous matters, Moses marks this unnatural pursuit
in Anah, who did not think it sufficient to have a great number of
animals; but he must add to them a degenerate race produced by unnatural
intercourse. Moreover, we learn hence, that there is more moderation
among brute animals in following the law of nature, than in men, who
invent vicious admixtures.

<span id="xiv.i-p100"></span><span id="xiv.i-p100.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p101"></span>**31.** *These are the kings that reigned,
etc* We must keep in memory what we have said a little before, that
reprobates are suddenly exalted, that they may immediately fall, like
the herb upon the roofs, which is destitute of root, and has a hasty
growth, but withers the more quickly. To the two sons of Isaac had been
promised the honor that kings should spring from them. The Idumeans
first began to reign, and thus the condition of Israel seemed to be
inferior. But at length, lapse of time taught how much better it is, by
creeping on the ground, to strike the roots deep, than to acquire an
extravagant pre-eminence for a moment, which speedily vanishes away.
There is, therefore, no reason why the faithful, who slowly pursue their
way, should envy the quick children of this world, their rapid
succession of delights; since the felicity which the Lord promises them
is far more stable, as it is expressed in the psalm,

<span id="xiv.i-p102"></span>“The children’s children shall dwell there,
and their inheritance shall be perpetual.” (<span
id="xiv.i-p102.1"></span>[Ps
102:28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#028.md)<span
id="xiv.i-p102.1"></span>.)
