<span id="viii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 30.

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
30:1-43](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And when Rachel saw that she bare
Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give
me children, or else I die.

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Porro vidit Rachel, quod non pareret
ipsi Iahacob: et invidit Rachel sorori suae, et dixit ad Iahacob, Da
mihi filios: sin minus, mortua sum.

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span>**2.** And Jacob’s anger was kindled against
Rachel: and he said, *Am* I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee
the fruit of the womb?

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et iratus est furor Iahacob in
Rachel, et dixit, Numquid pro Deo sum, qui prohibuit a to fructum
ventris?

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span>**3.** And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah,
go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have
children by her

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et dixit, Ecce ancilla mea Bilhah,
ingredere ad cam, et pariet super genua mea: et erit etiam mihi filius
ex ea.

<span id="viii.i-p8"></span>**4.** And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid
to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.

<span id="viii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Dedit ergo ei Bilhah ancillam suam in
uxorem, et ingressus est ad eam Iahacob.

<span id="viii.i-p10"></span>**5.** And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob
a son.

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et concepit Bilhah, et peperit ipsi
Iahacob filium.

<span id="viii.i-p12"></span>**6.** And Rachel said, God hath judged me,
and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called
she his name Dan.

<span id="viii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et dixit Rachel, Iudicavit me Deus,
et etiam audivit vocem meam, et dedit mihi filium. Idcirco vocavit nomen
ejus Daniel

<span id="viii.i-p14"></span>**7.** And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived
again, and bare Jacob a second son.

<span id="viii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Et concepit adhuc, et peperit Bilhah
ancilla Rachel filium secundum ipsi Iahacob

<span id="viii.i-p16"></span>**8.** And Rachel said, With great
wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she
called his name Naphtali.

<span id="viii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Tunc dixit Rachel, Luctationibus
divinis luctata sum cum sorore mea, etiam praevalui. It vocavit nomen
ejus Nephthali.

<span id="viii.i-p18"></span>**9.** When Leah saw that she had left
bearing, she took Zilpah her maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.

<span id="viii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Vidit autem Leah, quod cessasset
parere, et accepit Zilpah ancillam suam, et dedit eam Iahacob in uxorem.

<span id="viii.i-p20"></span>**10.** And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a
son.

<span id="viii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Et peperit Zilpah ancilla Leah ipsi
Iahacob filium.

<span id="viii.i-p22"></span>**11.** And Leah said, A troop cometh: and
she called his name Gad.

<span id="viii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Et dixit Leah, Venit turba: et
vocavit nomen ejus Gad.

<span id="viii.i-p24"></span>**12.** And Zilpah Leah’s maid bare Jacob a
second son.

<span id="viii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et peperit Zilpah ancilla Leah
filium secundum ipsi Iahacob.

<span id="viii.i-p26"></span>**13.** And Leah said, Happy am I, for the
daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.

<span id="viii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Et dixit Leah, Ut beata dicar, quia
beatam me dicent filiae. Et vocavit nomen illius Aser.

<span id="viii.i-p28"></span>**14.** And Reuben went in the days of
wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto
his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy
son’s mandrakes.

<span id="viii.i-p29"></span>**14.** Ivit autem Reuben in diebus messis
triticeac, et reperit mandrgoras in agro, et attulit eas Leah matri
suae. Et dixit Rachel ad Leah, Da quaeso mihi de mandragoris filii tui.

<span id="viii.i-p30"></span>**15.** And she said unto her, *Is it* a
small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take
away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie
with thee to night for thy son’s mandrakes.

<span id="viii.i-p31"></span>**15.** Et dixit ei, Numquid parum est quod
abstuleris virum meum, ut auferas etiam mandragoras filii mei? Et dixit
Rachel, Idcirco dormiat tecum hac nocte pro mandragoris filii tui.

<span id="viii.i-p32"></span>**16.** And Jacob came out of the field in
the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in
unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he
lay with her that night.

<span id="viii.i-p33"></span>**16.** Venit autem Iahacob ex agro
vesperi, et egressa est Leah in occursum ejus, et dixit, Ad me
ingredieris: quia mercando mercata sum to mandragoris filii mei. Et
dormivit cum ea nocte illa.

<span id="viii.i-p34"></span>**17.** And God hearkened unto Leah, and
she conceived, and bare Jacob the fifth son.

<span id="viii.i-p35"></span>**17.** Exaudivit Deus Leah, et concepit,
et peperit ipsi Iahacob filium quintum.

<span id="viii.i-p36"></span>**18.** And Leah said, God hath given me my
hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his
name Issachar.

<span id="viii.i-p37"></span>**18.** Tunc dixit Leah, Dedit Deus
mercedem meam: quia dedi ancillam meum viro meo. Et vocavit nomen ejus
Issachar.

<span id="viii.i-p38"></span>**19.** And Leah conceived again, and bare
Jacob the sixth son.

<span id="viii.i-p39"></span>**19.** Et concepit adhuc Leah, et peperit
filium sextum ipsi Iahacob.

<span id="viii.i-p40"></span>**20.** And Leah said, God hath endued me
*with* a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have
born him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.

<span id="viii.i-p41"></span>**20.** Dixit ergo Leah, Dotavit me Deus
dote bona: vice hac habitavit mecum vir meus: quia peperi ei sex filios.
Et vocavit nomen ejus Zebulon.

<span id="viii.i-p42"></span>**21.** And afterwards she bare a daughter,
and called her name Dinah.

<span id="viii.i-p43"></span>**21.** Et postea peperit filiam: et
vocavit nomen ejus Dinah.

<span id="viii.i-p44"></span>**22.** And God remembered Rachel, and God
hearkened to her, and opened her womb.

<span id="viii.i-p45"></span>**22.** Porro recordatus est Deus Rachel,
et exaudivit eam Deus, et aperuit vulvam illius.

<span id="viii.i-p46"></span>**23.** And she conceived, and bare a son;
and said, God hath taken away my reproach:

<span id="viii.i-p47"></span>**23.** Et concepit, et peperit filium, et
dixit, Amovit Deus probrum meum.

<span id="viii.i-p48"></span>**24.** And she called his name Joseph; and
said, The LORD shall add to me another son.

<span id="viii.i-p49"></span>**24.** Et vocavit nomen ejus Ioseph,
dicendo, Addat Iehova mihi filium alium.

<span id="viii.i-p50"></span>**25.** And it came to pass, when Rachel
had born Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go
unto mine own place, and to my country.

<span id="viii.i-p51"></span>**25.** Fuit autem quum peperisset Rachel
Ioseph, dixit Iahacob ab Laban, Dimitte me, et ibo ad locum meum, et ad
terram meam.

<span id="viii.i-p52"></span>**26.** Give *me* my wives and my children,
for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service
which I have done thee.

<span id="viii.i-p53"></span>**26.** Da uxores meas, et liberos meos,
propter quas servivi tibi, et ibo: tu enim nosti servitium meum, quo
servivi tibi.

<span id="viii.i-p54"></span>**27.** And Laban said unto him, I pray
thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, *tarry: for* I have learned
by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.

<span id="viii.i-p55"></span>**27.** Et dixit ad cum Laban, Si, quaeso,
inveni gratiam in oculis tui, (expertus sum quod benedixit mihi Iehova
propter to.)

<span id="viii.i-p56"></span>**28.** And he said, Appoint me thy wages,
and I will give *it*

<span id="viii.i-p57"></span>**28.** Dixit ergo, Indica mercedem tuam
mihi, et dabo.

<span id="viii.i-p58"></span>**29.** And he said unto him, Thou knowest
how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me.

<span id="viii.i-p59"></span>**29.** Et dixit ad eum, Tu nosti qualiter
servierim tibi, et quale fuit pecus tuum mecum:

<span id="viii.i-p60"></span>**30.** For *it was* little which thou
hadst before I *came*, and it is *now* increased unto a multitude; and
the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide
for mine own house also?

<span id="viii.i-p61"></span>**30.** Quia pusillum, quod fuit tibi ante
me, crevit in multitudinem, et benedixit Dominus tibi ad ingressum pedis
mei: et nunc quando faciam etiam ego domui meae?

<span id="viii.i-p62"></span>**31.** And he said, What shall I give
thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do
this thing for me, I will again feed *and* keep thy flock:

<span id="viii.i-p63"></span>**31.** Et dixit, Quid dabo tibi? Respondit
Iahacob, Non dabis mihi quicquam, si feceris mihi hoc, revertar, pascam,
pecudes tuas custodiam.

<span id="viii.i-p64"></span>**32.** I will pass through all thy flock
to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and
all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among
the goats: and *of such* shall be my hire.

<span id="viii.i-p65"></span>**32.** Transibo per omnes pecudes tuas
hodie, removendo inde omne pecus parvum punctis parvis respersum, et
respersum maculis latis: et omnem agnum rufum in ovibus et respersum
maculis latis, et respersum punctis parvis in capris: et erit merces
mea.

<span id="viii.i-p66"></span>**33.** So shall my righteousness answer
for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face:
every one that *is* not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown
among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

<span id="viii.i-p67"></span>**33.** Et testificabitur mihi justitia mea
die crastino, quum venerit ad mercedem meam coram to: quicquid non erit
punctis parvis respersum, et maculis latis respersum in capris, et rufum
in ovibus, furto ablatum erat a me.

<span id="viii.i-p68"></span>**34.** And Laban said, Behold, I would it
might be according to thy word.

<span id="viii.i-p69"></span>**34.** Tunc dixit Laban, Ecce utinam sit
secundum verbum tuum.

<span id="viii.i-p70"></span>**35.** And he removed that day the he
goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were
speckled and spotted, *and* every one that had *some* white in it, and
all the brown among the sheep, and gave *them* into the hand of his
sons.

<span id="viii.i-p71"></span>**35.** Removit itaque in die illa hircos
minores variegatos, et maculis latis respersos, et omnes capras punctis
parvis respersas, et maculis latis respersas, omne in quo erat candor,
et omne rufum in ovibus, et dedit in manus filiorum suorum.

<span id="viii.i-p72"></span>**36.** And he set three days’ journey
betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.

<span id="viii.i-p73"></span>**36.** Et posuit viam trium dierum inter
se et inter Iahacob: et Iahacob pascebat pecudes Laban residuas.

<span id="viii.i-p74"></span>**37.** And Jacob took him rods of green
poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in
them, and made the white appear which *was* in the rods.

<span id="viii.i-p75"></span>**37.** Tulit autem sibi Iahacob virgam
populeam viridem, et amygdalinam, et castaneam, et decorticavit in eis
cortices albos, denudationem candoris, qui erat in virgis.

<span id="viii.i-p76"></span>**38.** And he set the rods which he had
pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the
flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.

<span id="viii.i-p77"></span>**38.** Et statuit virgas, quas
decorticavit, in fluentis, in canalibus aquarum (ad quos veniebant
pecudes ad bibendum) e regione pecudum, ut coirent dum venirent ad
bibendum.

<span id="viii.i-p78"></span>**39.** And the flocks conceived before the
rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

<span id="viii.i-p79"></span>**39.** Et coibant pecudes prope virgas, et
pariebant pecudes foetus lineis distinctos, et punctis parvis respersos,
et maculis latis respersos.

<span id="viii.i-p80"></span>**40.** And Jacob did separate the lambs,
and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the
brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves,
and put them not unto Laban’s cattle.

<span id="viii.i-p81"></span>**40.** Et oves separavit Iahacob, et
posuit facies pecudum ad foetus lineis distinctos,: et omne rufum in
pecudibus erat Laban: et posuit sibi greges seorsum, et non posuit eos
juxta pecudes Laban.

<span id="viii.i-p82"></span>**41.** And it came to pass, whensoever the
stronger cattle did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes
of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.

<span id="viii.i-p83"></span>**41.** Fuit autem, in omni coitu pecudum
primitivarum, ponebat Iahacob virgas in oculis pecudum in canalibus, ut
coirent ad virgas.

<span id="viii.i-p84"></span>**42.** But when the cattle were feeble, he
put *them* not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger
Jacob’s.

<span id="viii.i-p85"></span>**42.** Ad serotinos vero coitus pecudum
non ponebat: et erant serotina ipsius Laban: primitiva autem ipsius
Iahacob.

<span id="viii.i-p86"></span>**43.** And the man increased exceedingly,
and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and
asses.

<span id="viii.i-p87"></span>**43.** Crevit vir ergo supra modum:
fueruntque ei pecudes multae, et ancillae, et servi, et cameli, et
asini.

<span id="viii.i-p88"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p89"></span><span id="viii.i-p89.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p90"></span>**1.** *And when Rachel saw*. Here Moses
begins to relate that Jacob was distracted with domestic strifes. But
although the Lord was punishing him, because he had been guilty of no
light sin in marrying two wives, and especially sisters; yet the
chastisement was paternal; and God himself, seeing that he is wont
mercifully to pardon his own people, restrained in some degree his hand.
Whence also it happened, that Jacob did not immediately repent, but
added new offenses to the former. But first we must speak of Rachel.
Whereas she rejoiced to see her sister subjected to contempt and grief,
the Lord represses this sinful joy, by giving his blessing to Leah, in
order to make the condition of both of them equal. She hears the
grateful acknowledgment of her sister, and learns from the names given
to the four sons, that God had pitied, and had sustained by his favor,
her who had been unjustly despised by man. Nevertheless envy inflames
her, and will not suffer anything of the dignity becoming a wife to
appear in her. We see what ambition can do. For Rachel, in seeking
preeminence, does not spare even her own sister; and scarcely refrains
from venting her anger against God, for having honored that sister with
the gift of fruitfulness. Her emulation did not proceed from any
injuries that she had received, but because she could not bear to have a
partner and an equal, though she herself was really the younger. What
would she have done had she been provoked, seeing that she envies her
sister who was contented with her lot? Now Moses, by exhibiting this
evil in Rachel, would teach us that it is inherent in all; in order that
each of us, tearing it up by the roots, may vigilantly purify himself
from it. That we may be cured of envy, it behaves us to put away pride
and selflove; as Paul prescribes this single remedy against contentions

<span id="viii.i-p91"></span>“Let nothing be done through vainglory.”
(<span id="viii.i-p91.1"></span>[Php
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#003)<span id="viii.i-p91.1"></span>..md)

<span id="viii.i-p92"></span><span id="viii.i-p92.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p93"></span>**2.** *And Jacob’s anger was kindled*. The
tenderness of Jacob’s affection rendered him unwilling to offend his
wife; yet her unworthy conduct compelled him to do so, when he saw her
petulantly exalt herself, not only against her sister, who piously,
homily, and thankfully was enjoying the gifts of God; but even against
God himself, of whom it is said that the fruit of the womb is his
reward. (<span id="viii.i-p93.1"></span>[Ps
127:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa127.htm#003)<span id="viii.i-p93.1"></span>..md)
On this account, therefore, Jacob is angry, because his wife ascribes
nothing to the providence of God, and, by imagining that children are
the offspring of chance, would deprive God of the care and government of
mankind. It is probable that Jacob had been already sorrowful on account
of his wife’s barrenness. He now, therefore, fears lest her folly should
still farther provoke God’s anger to inflict more severe strokes. This
was a holy indignation, by which Jacob maintained the honor due to God,
while he corrected his wife, and taught her that it was not without
sufficient cause that she had been hitherto barren. For when he affirms
that the Lord had shut her womb, he obliquely intimates that she ought
the more deeply to humble herself.

<span id="viii.i-p94"></span><span id="viii.i-p94.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p95"></span>**3.** *Behold my maid Bilhah*. Here the
vanity of the female disposition appears. For Rachel is not induced to
flee unto the Lord, but strives to gain a triumph by illicit arts.
Therefore she hurries Jacob into a third marriage. Whence we infer, that
there is no end of sinning, when once the Divine institution is treated
with neglect. And this is what I have said, that Jacob was not
immediately brought back to a right state of mind by Divine
chastisements. He acts, indeed, in this instance, at the instigation of
his wife: but is his wife in the place of God, from whom alone the law
of marriage proceeds? But to please his wife, or to yield to her
importunity, he does not scruple to depart from the command of God. *To
bear upon the knees*, is nothing more than to commit the child when born
to another to be brought up. Bilhah was a maidservant; and therefore did
not bear for herself but for her mistress, who, claiming the child as
her own, thus procured the honor of a mother. Therefore it is added, in
the way of explanation, *I shall have children,* or *I shall be built up
by her.* For the word which Moses here uses, is derived from <span
id="viii.i-p95.1"></span>ןב (*ben*,) *a son*: because children are as
the support and stay of a house. But Rachel acted sinfully, because she
attempted, by an unlawful method, and in opposition to the will of God,
to become a mother.

<span id="viii.i-p96"></span><span id="viii.i-p96.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p97"></span>**5.** *And Bilhah conceived*. It is
wonderful that God should have deigned to honor an adulterous connection
with offspring: but he does sometimes thus strive to overcome by
kindness the wickedness of men, and pursues the unworthy with his favor.
Moreover, he does not always make the punishment equal to the offenses
of his people, nor does he always rouse them, alike quickly, from their
torpor, but waits for the matured season of correction. Therefore it was
his will that they who were born from this faulty connection, should yet
be reckoned among the legitimate children; just as Moses shortly before
called Bilhah a wife, who yet might more properly have been called a
harlot. And the common rule does not hold, that what had no force from
the beginning can never acquire validity by succession of time; for
although the compact, into which the husband and wife sinfully entered
against the Divine command and the sacred order of nature, was void; it
came to pass nevertheless, by special privilege, that the conjunction,
which in itself was adulterous, obtained the honor of wedlock. At length
Rachel begins to ascribe to God what is his own; but this confession of
hers is so mixed up with ambition, that it breathes nothing of sincerity
or rectitude. She pompously announces, that her cause has been
undertaken by the Lord. As if truly, she had been so injured by her
sister, that she deserved to be raised by the favor of God; and as if
she had not attempted to deprive herself of his help. We see, then, that
under the pretext of praising God, she rather does him wrong, by
rendering him subservient to her desires. Add to this, that she imitates
hypocrites, who, while in adversity, rush against God with closed eyes;
vet when more prosperous fortune favors them, indulge in vain boastings,
as if God smiled upon all their deeds and sayings. Rachel, therefore,
does not so much celebrate the goodness of God, as she applauds herself
Wherefore let the faithful, instructed by her example, abstain from
polluting the sacred name of God by hypocrisy.

<span id="viii.i-p98"></span><span id="viii.i-p98.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p99"></span>**8.** *With great wrestlings*  <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) Others translate it, “I am joined with
the joinings of God;”  <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) as if she
exulted in having recovered what she had lost; or, certainly, in having
obtained an equal degree of honor with her sister. Others render it, I
am doubled with the duplications of God. But both derive the noun and
the verb from the root <span id="viii.i-p101.2"></span>לתפ (*patal*,)
which signifies a twisted thread. The former of these senses comes to
this; that since Rachel has attained a condition equal to that of her
sister, there is no reason why her sister should claim any superiority
over her. But the latter sense expresses more confident boasting, since
she proclaims herself a conqueror, and doubly superior. But a more
simple meaning is (in my opinion) adduced by others, namely, that she
“wrestled with divine or excellent wrestlings.” For the Hebrews indicate
all excellence by adding the name of God; because the more excellent
anything is, the more does the glory of God shine in it. But perverse is
that boasting with which she glories over her sister, when she ought
rather suppliantly to have implored forgiveness. In Rachel the pride of
the human mind is depicted; because they whom God has endowed with his
benefits, for the most part are so elated, that they rage contumeliously
against their neighbors. Besides, she foolishly prefers herself to her
sister in fruitfulness, in which she is still manifestly inferior. But
they who are puffed up with pride have also the habit of malignantly
depreciating those gifts which the Lord has bestowed on others, in
comparison with their own smaller gifts. Perhaps, also, she expected a
numerous progeny, as if God were under obligation to her. She did not,
as pious persons are wont to do, conceive hope from benefits received;
but, by a confident presumption of the flesh, made herself sure of
everything she wished. Hitherto, then, she gave no sign of pious
modesty. Whence is this, but because her temporary barrenness had not
yet thoroughly subdued her? Therefore we ought the more to beware, lest
if God relaxes our punishments, we, being inflated by his kindness,
should perish.

<span id="viii.i-p102"></span><span id="viii.i-p102.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p103"></span>**9.** *When Leah saw that she had left
bearing.* Moses returns to Leah, who, not content with four sons,
devised a method whereby she might always retain her superior rank: and
therefore she also, in turn, substitutes her maid in her place. And
truly Rachel deserved such a reward of her perverse design; since she,
desiring to snatch the palm from her sister, does not consider that the
same contrivance to which she had resorted, might speedily be employed
against herself. Yet Leah sins still more grievously, by using wicked
and unjust arts in the contest. Within a short period, she had
experienced the wonderful blessing of God; and now, because she ceased
from bearing, for a little while, she despairs concerning the future, as
if she had never participated in the Divine favor. What, if her desire
was strong; why did she not resort to the fountain of blessing? In
obtruding, therefore, her maid, she gave proof not only of impatience,
but also of distrust; because with the remembrance of Divine mercy,
faith also is extinguished in her heart. And we know that all who rely
upon the Lord are so tranquil and sedate in their mind, that they
patiently wait for what he is about to give. And it is the just
punishment of unbelief when any one stumbles through excessive haste. So
much the more ought we to beware of the assaults of the flesh, if we
desire to maintain a right course.

<span id="viii.i-p104"></span>As to the name *Gad*, this passage is
variously expounded by commentators. In this point they agree, that
<span id="viii.i-p104.1"></span>דגב (*bagad*) means the same as if Leah
had said “the time of bearing is come.”  <span
id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) But some suppose <span
id="viii.i-p105.6"></span>דג (*Gad*,) to be the prosperous star of
Jupiter; others, Mercury; others, *good fortune*. They adduce <span
id="viii.i-p105.7"></span>[Isa
65:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#011.md)<span id="viii.i-p105.7"></span>,
where it is written, “they offer a libation to Gad.”  <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) But the context of the Prophet shows that
this ought rather to be understood of the host of heaven, or of the
number of false gods; because it immediately follows that they offer
sacrifices to the stars, and furnish tables for a multitude of gods: the
punishment is then added, that as they had fabricated an immense number
of deities, so God will “number” them “to the sword.” As it respects the
present passage, nothing is less probable than that Leah should extol
the planet Jupiter instead of God, seeing that she, at least, maintained
the principle that the propagation of the human race flows from God
alone. I wonder also that interpreters understand this of prosperous
fortune, when Moses afterwards, <span id="viii.i-p106.1"></span>[Ge
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#019.md)<span id="viii.i-p106.1"></span>,
leads us to an opposite meaning. For the allusion he there makes would
be inappropriate, “Gad, a troop shall overcome him,” etc., unless it had
been the design of Leah to congratulate herself on the *troop* of her
children. For since she had so far surpassed her sister,  <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) she declares that she has children in
great abundance. When she proclaims herself *happy*  <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) in her sixth son, it again appears in
what great esteem fecundity was then held. And certainly it is a great
honor, when God confers on mortals the sacred title of parents, and
through them propagates the human race formed after his own image.

<span id="viii.i-p109"></span><span id="viii.i-p109.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p110"></span>**14.** *And Reuben went in the days of
wheat harvest*. This narration of the fact that a boy brought home I
know not what kind of fruit out of the fields, and presented it to his
mother, by which she purchased of her sister one nigh with her husband,
has the appearance of being light and puerile. Yet it contains a useful
instruction. For we know how foolishly the Jews glory in extolling the
origin of their own nation: for they scarcely deign to acknowledge that
they leave sprung from Adam and Noah, with the rest of mankind. And
certainly they do excel in the dignity of their ancestors, as Paul
testifies, (<span id="viii.i-p110.1"></span>[Ro
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005)<span id="viii.i-p110.1"></span>,.md)
but they do not acknowledge this as coming from God. Wherefore the
Spirit purposely aimed at beating down this arrogance, when he described
their race as sprung from a beginning, so mean and abject. For he does
not here erect a splendid stage on which they may exhibit themselves;
but he humbles them and exalts the grace of God, seeing that he had
brought forth his Church out of nothing. Respecting the kind of fruit
mentioned, I leave nothing certain to adduce.  <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) That it was fragrant is gathered from

<span id="viii.i-p114"></span>**15.** *Is it a small matter that thou
hast taken my husband?* Moses leaves more for his readers to reflect
upon than he expresses in words; namely, that Jacob’s house had been
filled with contentions and strifes. For Leah speaks haughtily, because
her mind had been long so exasperated that she could not address herself
mildly and courteously to her sister: Perhaps the sisters were not thus
contentious by nature; but God suffered them to contend with each other,
that the punishment of polygamy might be exhibited to posterity. And it
is not to be doubted that this domestic private quarrel, yea, hostile
dissension, brought great grief and torment to the holy man. But the
reason why he found himself thus distracted by opposite parties was,
that against all right, he had broken the unity of the conjugal bond.

<span id="viii.i-p115"></span><span id="viii.i-p115.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p116"></span>**17.** *And God hearkened unto Leah*.
Moses expressly declares this, in order that we may know how indulgently
God dealt with that family. For who would have thought, that, while Leah
was hatefully denying to her sister the fruits gathered by her boy, and
was purchasing, by the price of those fruits, a night with her husband,
there would be any place for prayers? Moses, therefore, teaches us, that
pardon was granted for these faults, to prove that the Lord would not
fail to complete his work notwithstanding such great infirmity. But Leah
ignorantly boasts that her son was given to her as a reward of her sin;
for she had violatedthe fidelity of holy wedlock, when she introduced a
fresh concubine to oppose her sister. Truly, she is so far from the
confession of her fault, that she proclaims her own merit. I grant there
was some excuse for her conduct; for she intimates that she was not so
much excited by lust, as by modest love, because she desired to increase
her family and to fulfill the duty of an honorable mother of a family.
But though this pretext is specious in the eyes of men, yet the
profanation of holy marriage cannot be pleasing to God. She errs,
therefore, in taking what was *no cause* for *the cause*. And this is
the more to be observed; because it is a fault which too much prevails
in the world, for men to reckon the free gifts of God as their own
reward; yea, even to boast of their deserts, when they are condemned by
the word of God. In her sixth son, she more purely and rightly estimates
the divine goodness, when she gives thanks to God, that, by his
kindness, her husband would hereafter be more closely united to her,
(verse 20). For although he had lived with her before, yet, being too
much attached to Rachel, he was almost entirely alienated from Leah. It
has before been said, that children born in lawful wedlock are bonds to
unite the minds of their parents.

<span id="viii.i-p117"></span><span id="viii.i-p117.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p118"></span>**21.** *And afterward she bare a
daughter*. It is not known whether Jacob had any other daughter; for it
is not uncommon in Scripture, when genealogies are recorded, to omit the
women, since they do not bear their own name, but lie concealed under
the shadow of their husbands. Meanwhile, if anything worthy of
commemoration occurs to any women, especial mention is then made of
them. This was the case with Dinah, on account of the violence done to
her; of which more will be said hereafter. But whereas the sons of Jacob
subsequently regarded it as an indignity that their sister should marry
one of another nation; and as Moses records nothing of any other
daughters, either as being settled in the land of Canaan, or married in
Egypt, it is probable that Dinah was the only one born to him.

<span id="viii.i-p119"></span><span id="viii.i-p119.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p120"></span>**22.** *And God remembered Rachel*. Since
with God nothing is either *before* or *after*, but all things are
present, he is subject to no forgetfulness, so that, in the lapse of
time, he should need to be reminded of what is past. But the Scripture
describes the presence and memory of God from the effect produced upon
ourselves, because we conceive him to be such as he appears to be by his
acts. Moreover, whether Rachel’s child was born the last of all, cannot
with certainty be gathered from the words of Moses. They who, in this
place, affirm that the figure *hysteron* *proteron*, which puts the last
first, is used, are moved by the consideration, that if Joseph had been
born after the last of his brethren, the age which Moses records in
<span id="viii.i-p120.1"></span>[Ge
41:46](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#046.md)<span id="viii.i-p120.1"></span>,
would not accord with the fact. But they are deceived in this, that they
reckon the nuptials of Rachel from the end of the second seven years;
whereas it is certainly proved from the context, that although Jacob
agreed to give his service for Rachel, yet he obtained her immediately;
because from the beginning, the strife between the two sisters broke
forth. Moses clearly intimates, in this place, that the blessing of God
was bestowed late, when Rachel had despaired of issue, and had long been
subject to reproach because of her barrenness. On account of this
prosperous omen she gave the name Joseph  <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) to her son, deriving the hope of two sons
from the prospect of *one*  <span id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md)

<span id="viii.i-p123"></span><span id="viii.i-p123.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p124"></span>**25.** *Send me away, that I may go*.
Seeing that Jacob had been retained by a proposed reward for his
services, it might appear that he was acting craftily in desiring his
dismissal from his father-in-law. I cannot, however, doubt that the
desire to return had already entered his mind, and that he ingenuously
avowed his intention. First; having experienced, in many ways, how
unjust, how perfidious, and even cruel, Laban had been, there is no
wonder that he should wish to depart from him, as soon as ever the
opportunity was afforded. Secondly; since, from the long space of time
which had elapsed, he hoped that his brother’s mind would be appeased,
he could not but earnestly wish to return to his parents; especially as
he had been oppressed by so many troubles, that he could scarcely fear a
worse condition in any other place. But the promise of God was the most
powerful stimulant of all to excite his desire to return. For he had not
rejected the benediction which was dearer to him than his own life. To
this point his declaration refers, “I will go to my own place and to my
country;” for he does not use this language concerning Canaan, only
because he was born there, but because he knew that it had been divinely
granted to him. For if he had said that he desired to return, merely
because it was his native soil, he might have been exposed to ridicule;
since his father had passed a wandering and unsettled life, continually
changing his abode. I therefore conclude, that although he might have
dwelt commodiously elsewhere, the oracle of God, by which the land of
Canaan had been destined for him, was ever fresh in his memory. And
although, for a time, he submits to detention, this does not alter his
purpose to depart: for necessity, in part, extorted it from him, since
he was unable to extricate himself from the snares of his uncle; in part
also, he voluntarily gave way, in order that he might acquire something
for himself and his family, lest he should return poor and naked to his
own country. But here the insane wickedness of Laban is discovered.
After he had almost worn out his nephew and son-in-law, by hard and
constant toil for fourteen years, he yet offers him no wages for the
future. The equity, of which at first he had made such pretensions, had
already vanished. For the greater had been the forbearance of Jacob, the
more tyrannical license did he usurp over him. So the world abuses the
gentleness of the pious; and the more meekly they conduct themselves,
the more ferociously does the world assail them. But though, like sheep,
we are exposed, in this world, to the violence and injuries of wolves;
we must not fear lest they should hurt or devour us, since the Heavenly
Shepherd keeps us under his protection.

<span id="viii.i-p125"></span><span id="viii.i-p125.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p126"></span>**27.** *I pray thee, if I have found
favor in thine eyes*. We perceive hence, that Jacob had not been a
burdensome guest, seeing that Laban soothes him with bland address, in
order to procure from him a longer continuance in his service. For,
sordid and grasping as he was, he would not have suffered Jacob to
remain a moment in his house, unless he had found his presence to be a
certain source of gain. Inasmuch therefore, as he not only did not
thrust him out, but anxiously sought to retain him, we hence infer that
the holy man had undergone incredible labors, which had not only
sufficed for the sustenance of a large family, but had also brought
great profit to his father-in-law. Wherefore, he complains afterwards,
not unjustly, that he had endured the heat of the day, and the cold of
the night. Nevertheless, there is no doubt, that the blessing of God
availed more than any labors whatever, so that Laban perceived Jacob to
be a kind of horn of plenty, as he himself confesses. For he not only
commends his fidelity and diligence, but expressly declares that he
himself had I been blessed by the Lord, for Jacob’s sake. It appears,
then, that the wealth of Laban had so increased, from the time of
Jacob’s coming, that it was as if his gains had visibly distilled from
heaven. Moreover, as the word <span id="viii.i-p126.1"></span>שחנ
(*nachash*,) among the Hebrews, means to know by auguries or by
divination, some interpreters imagine that Laban, having been instructed
in magic arts, found that the presence of Jacob was useful and
profitable to him. Others, however, expound the words more simply, as
meaning that he had proved it to be so by experiment. To me the true
interpretation seems to be, as if he had said, that the blessing of God
was as perceptible to him, as if it had been attested by prophecy, or
found out by augury.

<span id="viii.i-p127"></span><span id="viii.i-p127.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p128"></span>**29.** *Thou knowest how I have served
thee*. This answer of Jacob is not intended to increase the amount of
his wages; but he would expostulate with Laban, and would charge him
with acting unjustly and unkindly in requiring a prolongation of the
time of service. There is also no doubt that he is carried forth, with
every desire of his mind, towards the land of Canaan. Therefore a return
thither was, in his view, preferable to any kind of riches whatever.
Yet, in the mealtime, he indirectly accuses his father-in-law, both of
cunning and of inhumanity, in order that he may extort something from
him, if be must remain longer. For he could not hope that the perfidious
old fox would, of himself, perform an act of justice; neither does Jacob
simply commend his own industry, but shows that he had to deal with an
unjust and cruel man. Meanwhile, it is to be observed, that although he
had labored strenuously, he yet ascribes nothing to his own labor, but
imputes it entirely to the blessing of God that Laban had been enriched.
For though when men faithfully devote themselves to their duty, they do
not lose their labor; yet their success depends entirely upon the favor
of God. What Paul asserts concerning the efficacy of teaching, extends
still further, that he who plants and he who waters is nothing, (<span
id="viii.i-p128.1"></span>[1Co
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007)<span id="viii.i-p128.1"></span>,.md)
for the similitude is taken from general experience. The use of this
doctrine is twofold. First, whatever I attempt, or to whatever work I
apply my hands, it is my duty to desire God to bless my labor, that it
may not be vain and fruitless. Then, if I have obtained anything, my
second duty is to ascribe the praise to God; without whose blessing, men
in vain rise up early, fatigue themselves the whole day, late take rest,
eat the bread of carefulness, and taste even a little water with sorrow.
With respect to the meaning of the *words*, when Jacob says, “It was
little that thou hadst *in my sight*,”  <span
id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md) Jerome has well and skilfully translated
them “before I came.” For Moses puts the *face* of Jacob for his actual
*coming* and dwelling with Laban.

<span id="viii.i-p130"></span><span id="viii.i-p130.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p131"></span>**30.** *And now, when shall I provide for
mine own house also?* He reasons, that when he had so long expended his
labors for another, it would be unjust that his own family should be
neglected. For nature prescribes this order, that every one should take
care of the family committed to him. To which point the saying of
Solomon is applicable, Drink water from thy own fountains, and let
rivers flow to thy neighbors.  <span id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) Had
Jacob been alone, he might have devoted himself more freely to the
interests of another; but now, since he is the husband of four wives,
and the father of a numerous offspring, he ought not to be forgetful of
those whom he has received at the hand of God to bring up.

<span id="viii.i-p133"></span><span id="viii.i-p133.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p134"></span>**31.** *Thou shalt not give me anything*.
The antithesis between this and the preceding clause is to be noticed.
For Jacob does not demand for himself certain and definite wages; but he
treats with Laban, on this condition, that he shall receive whatever
offspring may be brought forth by the sheep and goats of a pure and
uniform color, which shall prove to be party-coloured and spotted. There
is indeed some obscurity in the words. For, at first, Jacob seems to
require for himself the spotted sheep as a present reward. But from the
thirty-third verse (<span id="viii.i-p134.1"></span>[Ge
30:33](../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#033)<span id="viii.i-p134.1"></span>.md)
another sense may be gathered: namely, that Jacob would suffer whatever
was variegated in the flock to be separated and delivered to the sons of
Laban to be fed; but that he himself would retain the unspotted sheep
and goats. And certainly it would be absurd that Jacob should now claim
part of the flock for himself, when he had just confessed, that hitherto
he had made no gain. Moreover, the gain thus acquired would have been
more than was just; and there was no hope that this could be obtained
from Laban. A question however arises, by what hope, or by what counsel
bad Jacob been induced to propose this condition? A little afterwards,
Moses will relate that he had used cunning, in order that party-coloured
and spotted lambs might be brought forth by the pure flock; but in the
following chapter he more fully declares that Jacob had been divinely
instructed thus to act (<span id="viii.i-p134.2"></span>[Ge
31:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#001)<span id="viii.i-p134.2"></span>..md)
Therefore, although it was improbable in itself that this agreement
should prove useful to the holy man, he yet obeys the celestial oracle,
and wishes to be enriched in no other manner than according to the will
of God. But Laban was dealt with according to his own disposition; for
he eagerly caught at what seemed advantageous to himself, but God
disappointed his shameful cupidity.

<span id="viii.i-p135"></span><span id="viii.i-p135.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p136"></span>**33.** *So shall my righteousness answer
for me*. Literally it is, “My righteousness shall answer in me.” But the
particle <span id="viii.i-p136.1"></span>יב (*bi*) signifies *to me* or
*for me*  <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) The sense, however, is
clear, that Jacob does not expect success, except through his faith and
integrity.  <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) Respecting the next
clause, interpreters differ. For some read, “When thou shalt come to my
reward.”  <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) But others, translating
in the third person, explain it of righteousness, which shall come to
the reward, or to the remunerating of Jacob. Although either sense will
suit the passage, I rather refer it to righteousness; because it is
immediately added, “before thee.”  <span id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md)
For it would be an improper form of expression, “Thou wilt come before
thine own eyes to my reward.” It now sufficiently appears what Jacob
meant. For he declares that he hoped for a testimony of his faith and
uprightness from the Lord, in the happy result of his labors, as if he
had said, “The Lord who is the best judge and vindicator of my
righteousness, will indeed show with what sincerity and faithfulness I
have hitherto conducted myself.” And though the Lord often permits
sinners to be enriched by wicked arts, and suffers them to acquire
abundant gain by seizing the goods of others as their own: this proves
no exception to the rule, that his blessing is the ordinary attendant on
good faith and equity. Wherefore, Jacob justly gave this token of his
fidelity, that he committed the success of his labors to the Lord, in
order that his integrity might hence be made manifest. The sense of the
words is now clear, “My righteousness shall openly testify for me,
because it will voluntarily come to remunerate me; and that so
obviously, that it shall not he hidden even from thee.” A tacit reproof
is couched in this language, intimating that Laban should feel how
unjustly he had withheld the wages of the holy man, and that God would
shortly show, by the result, how wickedly he had dissembled respecting
his own obligation to him. For there is an antithesis to be understood
between the future and the past time, when he says, “*Tomorrow* (or in
time to come) it will answer for me,” since indeed, *yesterday* and the
*day before*, he could extort no justice from Laban.

<span id="viii.i-p141"></span>*Every one that is not speckled and
spotted*. Jacob binds himself to the crime and punishment of theft, if
he should take away any unspotted sheep from the flock: as if he would
say, “Shouldst thou find with me anything unspotted, I am willing to be
charged as a thief; because I require nothing to be given to me but the
spotted lambs.” Some expound the words otherwise, “Whatsoever thou shalt
find deficient in thy flock, require of me, as if I had stolen it;” but
this appears to me a forced interpretation.

<span id="viii.i-p142"></span><span id="viii.i-p142.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p143"></span>**35.** *And he removed that day*. From
this verse the form of the compact is more certainly known. Laban
separates the sheep and goats marked with spots from the pure flock,
that is, from the white or black, and commits these to his sons to be
fed; interposing a three-days’ journey between them and the rest; lest,
by promiscuous intercourse, a particoloured offspring should be
produced. It follows, therefore, that, in the flock which Jacob fed,
nothing remained but cattle of one color: thus but faint hope of gain
remained to the holy man, while every provision was made for Laban’s
advantage. It also appears, from the distance of the places, in which
Laban kept his flocks apart, that he was not less suspicious than
covetous; for dishonest men are wont to measure others by their own
standard; whence it happens that they are always distrustful and
alarmed.

<span id="viii.i-p144"></span><span id="viii.i-p144.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p145"></span>**37.** *And Jacob took him rods of green
poplar*. The narration of Moses, at first sight, may seem absurd: for he
either intends to censure holy Jacob as guilty of fraud, or to praise
his industry. But from the context it will appear that this adroitness
was not culpable. Let us then see how it is to be excused. Should any
one contend that he was impelled to act as he did, by the numerous
injuries of his father-in-law, and that he sought nothing but the
reparation of former losses; the defense would perhaps be plausible: yet
in the sight of God it is neither firm nor probable; for although we may
be unjustly treated, we must not enter the contest with equal injustice.
And were it permitted to avenge our own injuries, or to repair our own
wrongs, there would be no place for legal judgments, and thence would
arise horrible confusion. Therefore Jacob ought not to have resorted to
this stratagem, for the purpose of producing degenerate cattle, but
rather to have followed the rule which the Lord delivers by the mouth of
Paul, that the faithful should study to overcome evil with good, (<span
id="viii.i-p145.1"></span>[Ro
12:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#021.md)<span
id="viii.i-p145.1"></span>.) This simplicity, I confess, ought to have
been cultivated by Jacob, unless the Lord from heaven had commanded
otherwise. But in this narrative there is a *hysteron proteron*, (a
putting of the last first,) for Moses first relates the fact, and then
subjoins that Jacob had attempted nothing but by the command of God.
Wherefore, it is not for those persons to claim him as their advocate,
who oppose malignant and fraudulent men with fallacies like their own;
because Jacob did not, of his own will, take license craftily to
circumvent his father-in-law, by whom he had been unworthily deceived;
but, pursuing the course prescribed to him by the Lord, kept himself
within due bounds. In vain, also, according to my judgment, do some
dispute whence Jacob learnt this; whether by long practice or by the
teaching of his fathers; for it is possible, that he had been suddenly
instructed respecting a matter previously unknown. If any one object,
the absurdity of supposing, that this act of deceit was suggested by
God; the answer is easy, that God is the author of no fraud, when he
stretches out his hand to protect his servant. Nothing is more
appropriate to him, and more in accordance with his justice, than that
he should interpose as an avenger, when any injury is inflicted. But it
is not our part to prescribe to him his method of acting. He suffered
Laban to retain what he unjustly possessed; but in six years he withdrew
his blessing from Laban, and transferred it to his servant Jacob. If an
earthly judge condemns a thief to restore twofold or fourfold, no one
complains: and why should we concede less to God, than to a mortal and
perishing man? He had other methods in his power; but he purposed to
connect his grace with the labor and diligence of Jacob, that he might
openly repay to him those wages of which he had been long defrauded. For
Laban was constrained to open his eyes, which being before shut, he had
been accustomed to consume the sweat and even the blood of another.
Moreover, as it respects physical causes, it is well known, that the
sight of objects by the female has great effect on the form of the
foetus.  <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md) When this happens with
women, takes it at least place with animals, where is no reason, but
where reigns an enormous rush of carnal lusts. Now Jacob did three
things. For first, he stripped the bark from twigs that he might make
bare some white places by the incisions in the bark, and thus a varying
and manifold color was produced. Secondly, he chose the times when the
males and females were assembled. Thirdly, he put the twigs in the
waters,  <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) for like the drinking
feeds the animal parts, it also urges on the sexual drive. By the
*stronger* cattle Moses may be understood to speak of those who bore in
spring — by the feeble, those who bore in autumn.

<span id="viii.i-p148"></span><span id="viii.i-p148.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p149"></span>**43.** *And the man increased
exceedingly*. Moses added this for the purpose of showing that he was
not made thus suddenly rich without a miracle. We shall see hereafter
how great his wealth was. For being entirely destitute, he yet gathered
out of nothing, greater riches than any man of moderate wealth could do
in twenty or thirty years. And that no one may deem this fabulous, as
not being in accordance with the usual method, Moses meets the objection
by saying, that the holy man was enriched in an extraordinary manner.

forget my holy mountain, that prepare a table for that troop (margin,
Meni). — *English* *Translation*. Calvin has quoted from memory, and not
accurately, having put libation instead of table. — *Ed*.

<span id="viii.i-p108"></span> “And Leah said, Happy am I, for the
daughters shall call me blessed; and she called his name Asher.” —
*English* *Translation*. It may be observed that the names given to
these children of the hand-maidens were far less indicative of a pious
state of mind, than those which Leah had previously given to her own
sons. A fact which confirms the remarks of Calvin on the impiety of the
course pursued by the rival wives. Rachel seems to make no reference to
God in the names of the children of her handmaid; Leah, in imitating the
example of her sister, seems to lose her own previous devotional
feeling; and both sink in our esteem, as they proceed in their unseemly
contentions. — *Ed*.

<span id="viii.i-p111"></span> Mandrakes — Heb. <span
id="viii.i-p111.1"></span>םיאדוד, (*dudaim*,) from <span
id="viii.i-p111.2"></span>דוד, (*dud*,) beloved; supposed to be a
species of melon with purple flowers. It grows abundantly in Palestine,
and is held in high respect for its prolific virtues. *Gesenius*
describes mandrakes as “Love apples (<span
id="viii.i-p111.3"></span>Liebes apfel), the apples of the Mandragora,
an herb resembling the belladonna, with a root like a carrot, having
white and reddish blossoms of a sweet smell, and with yellow odoriferous
apples.” — *Ed*

<span id="fn_80"></span>[81](cc02007.htm#fr_80.md) <span
id="viii.i-p111.5"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p112"></span> “The mandrakes give a smell, and at our
gates are all manner of pleasant fruits.”

<span id="viii.i-p122"></span> “The Lord shall add to me another son.”
This may be regarded either as a prophecy respecting Benjamin, or as a
prayer which was fulfilled when Benjamin was born. — *Ed*.

<span id="viii.i-p132"></span> <span id="viii.i-p132.1"></span>Et

waters out of thine own cistern; and running waters out of thine own
well.”

id="viii.i-p136.2"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p137"></span> In the Amsterdam edition the particle is
<span id="viii.i-p137.1"></span>יכ, evidently the printer’s mistake. In
Hengstenberg’s edition, it is <span id="viii.i-p137.2"></span>יל, which
looks as if the editor, instead of turning to the original, had, at a
venture, translated Calvin’s Latin words <span
id="viii.i-p137.3"></span>mihi, or <span id="viii.i-p137.4"></span>pro
me, into Hebrew. — *Ed*

<span id="viii.i-p139"></span> That is, to see that I receive my reward
or wages, at the time when the flock is divided according to our
compact. — *Ed*.

id="viii.i-p139.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p140"></span> This seems to be the sense in which the
English translators understood the passage. “So shall my righteousness
answer for me in time to come, when it (my righteousness) shall come for
my hire (or reward) before thy face.” *Coramto*. — *Ed*.

<span id="viii.i-p146"></span> The whole passage is this: — <span
id="viii.i-p146.1"></span>Porro quantum ad physicam rationem spectat,
satis notum est, aspectum in coitu ad formam foetus multum valere. Id
quum mulieribus accidat, praecipue in brutis pecudibus locum habet, ubi
nulla viget ratio, sed violentus libidinis impetus grassatur.

<span id="viii.i-p147"></span> <span id="viii.i-p147.1"></span>Tertio,
posuit in aquis virgas: quia sicut potus animalia vegetat, sic incitat
etiam ad coitum. Hoc modo accidit ut virgae in conspectu essent, quum
incalescebant. Quod de robustis ac debilibus dicit Moses, sic intellige,
in priore admissura, quae sit sub initium veris, Jacob posuisse virgas
in canalibus, ut sibi vernos foetus acquireret, qui meliores erant: in
serotina vero admissura circa autumnum, tali artificio usum non esse.
