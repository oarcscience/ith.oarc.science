<span id="ix-p1"></span>CHAPTER 31.

<span id="ix.i"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p1"></span><span id="ix.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
31:1-55](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p2"></span>**1.** And he heard the words of Laban’s sons,
saying, Jacob hath taken away all that *was* our father’s; and of *that*
which *was* our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.

<span id="ix.i-p3"></span>**1.** Postea audivit verba filiorum Laban
dicentium, Tulit Iahacob omnia quae erant patris nostri: et de his quae
erant patris nostri, acquisivit omnem gloriam hanc.

<span id="ix.i-p4"></span>**2.** And Jacob beheld the countenance of
Laban, and, behold, it *was* not toward him as before.

<span id="ix.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et vidit Iahacob faciem Laban, et ecce
non erat cum eo sicut heri et nudiustertius.

<span id="ix.i-p6"></span>**3.** And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return
unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with
thee.

<span id="ix.i-p7"></span>**3.** Dixit autem Iehova ad Iahacob,
Revertere ad terram patrum tuorum, et ad cognationem tuam, et ero tecum.

<span id="ix.i-p8"></span>**4.** And Jacob sent and called Rachel and
Leah to the field unto his flock,

<span id="ix.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et Misit Iahacob, et vocavit Rachel et
Leah in agrum ad pecudes

<span id="ix.i-p10"></span>**5.** And said unto them, I see your
father’s countenance, that it *is* not toward me as before; but the God
of my father hath been with me.

<span id="ix.i-p11"></span>**5.** Qui dixit ad eas, Video faciem patris
vestri, quod non sit erga me sicut heri et nudiustertius: Deus autem
patris mei fuit mecum.

<span id="ix.i-p12"></span>**6.** And ye know that with all my power I
have served your father.

<span id="ix.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et vos nostis, quod omnibus viribus
meis servierim patri vestro:

<span id="ix.i-p14"></span>**7.** And your father hath deceived me, and
changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.

<span id="ix.i-p15"></span>**7.** At pater vester mentitus est mihi, et
mutavit mercedem meam decem vicibus: sed non permisit ei Deus, ut
malefaceret mihi.

<span id="ix.i-p16"></span>**8.** If he said thus, The speckled shall be
thy wages; then all the cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The
ringstraked shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

<span id="ix.i-p17"></span>**8.** Si ita dicebat, Punctis parvis
respersa erunt merces tua: pariebant omnes pecudes punctis parvis
respersa: et si ita dicebat, Lineis distincta erunt merces tua: tunc
pariebant omnes pecudes lineis distincta.

<span id="ix.i-p18"></span>**9.** Thus God hath taken away the cattle of
your father, and given *them* to me.

<span id="ix.i-p19"></span>**9.** Et abstulit Deus pecus patris vestri,
et dedit mihi.

<span id="ix.i-p20"></span>**10.** And it came to pass at the time that
the cattle conceived, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream,
and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the cattle *were* ringstraked,
speckled, and grisled.

<span id="ix.i-p21"></span>**10.** Et fuit, in tempore quo coibant
pecudes, levavi oculos meos, et vidi in somnio, et ecce hirci majores
ascendebant super capras variegatas, punctis parvis respersas, et
maculis latis respersas.

<span id="ix.i-p22"></span>**11.** And the angel of God spake unto me in
a dream, *saying*, Jacob: And I said, Here *am* I.

<span id="ix.i-p23"></span>**11.** Et dixit ad me Angelus Dei in somnio,
Iahacob. Et dixi, Ecce adsum.

<span id="ix.i-p24"></span>**12.** And he said, Lift up now thine eyes,
and see, all the rams which leap upon the cattle *are* ringstraked,
speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

<span id="ix.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et dixit, Leva nunc oculos tuos, et
vide omnes hircos majores ascendentes super capras lineis distinctas,
punctis parvis respersas, et maculis latis respersas: vidi enim omnia,
quae Laban facit tibi.

<span id="ix.i-p26"></span>**13.** I *am* the God of Bethel, where thou
anointedst the pillar, *and* where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now
arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy
kindred.

<span id="ix.i-p27"></span>**13.** Ego Deus Bethel, ubi unxisti statuam,
ubi vovisti mihi votum: nunc surge, egredere de terra hac, et revertere
ad terram cognationis tuae.

<span id="ix.i-p28"></span>**14.** And Rachel and Leah answered and said
unto him, *Is there* yet any portion or inheritance for us in our
father’s house?

<span id="ix.i-p29"></span>**14.** Et respondit Rachel at Leah, et
dixerunt ei, Numquid adhuc est nobis pars et haereditas in domo patris
nostri?

<span id="ix.i-p30"></span>**15.** Are we not counted of him strangers?
for he hath sold us, and hath quite devoured also our money.

<span id="ix.i-p31"></span>**15.** Nonne extraneae reputatae sumus ab
eo, quod vendidit nos, et consumpsit etiam consumendo argentum nostrum?

<span id="ix.i-p32"></span>**16.** For all the riches which God hath
taken from our father, that *is* ours, and our children’s: now then,
whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.

<span id="ix.i-p33"></span>**16.** Quia omnes divitiae, quas abstulit
Deus a patre nostro, nostrae sunt, ac filiorum nostrorum: nunc igitur
omnia, quae dixit Deus ad to, fac.

<span id="ix.i-p34"></span>**17** Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons
and his wives upon camels;

<span id="ix.i-p35"></span>**17.** Et surrexit Iahacob, et sustulit
filios suos et uxores suassuper camelos.

<span id="ix.i-p36"></span>**18.** And he carried away all his cattle,
and all his goods which he had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which
he had gotten in Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of
Canaan.

<span id="ix.i-p37"></span>**18.** Et abduxit omnes pecudes suas, et
omnem substantiam suam, quam acquisierat, pecudes acquisitionis suae,
quas acquisierat in Padan Aram, ut veniret ad Ishac patrem suum in
terram Chenaan.

<span id="ix.i-p38"></span>**19.** And Laban went to shear his sheep:
and Rachel had stolen the images that *were* her father’s.

<span id="ix.i-p39"></span>**19.** Laban autem profectus erat ad
tondendum oves suas, et furata est Rachel idola, quae erant patri suo.

<span id="ix.i-p40"></span>**20.** And Jacob stole away unawares to
Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.

<span id="ix.i-p41"></span>**20.** Furatus itaque est Iahacob cor Laban
Aramaei, quia non indicavit ei quod fugeret.

<span id="ix.i-p42"></span>**21.** So he fled with all that he had; and
he rose up, and passed over the river, and set his face *toward* the
mount Gilead.

<span id="ix.i-p43"></span>**21.** Et fugit ipse, et omnia quae erant
ei: et surrexit, et transivit flumen, posuitque faciem suam ad montem
Gilhad.

<span id="ix.i-p44"></span>**22.** And it was told Laban on the third
day that Jacob was fled.

<span id="ix.i-p45"></span>**22.** Et nuntiatum fuit ipsi Laban die
tertia, quod fugeret Iahacob.

<span id="ix.i-p46"></span>**23.** And he took his brethren with him,
and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him in the
mount Gilead.

<span id="ix.i-p47"></span>**23.** Tunc sumpsit fratres suos secum,
secutusque est eum itinere septem dierum, et assecutus est eum in monte
Gilhad.

<span id="ix.i-p48"></span>**24.** And God came to Laban the Syrian in a
dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to
Jacob either good or bad.

<span id="ix.i-p49"></span>**24.** Porro venit Deus ad Laban Aramaeum in
somnio noctis, et dixit ei, Cave tibi ne forte loquaris cum Iahacob a
bono usque ad malum.

<span id="ix.i-p50"></span>**25.** Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob
had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched
in the mount of Gilead.

<span id="ix.i-p51"></span>**25.** Assecutus autem est Laban ipsum
Iahacob: et Iahacob fixerat tabernaculum suum in monte, et Laban fixit
cum fratribus suis in monte Gilhad.

<span id="ix.i-p52"></span>**26.** And Laban said to Jacob, What hast
thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away
my daughters, as captives *taken* with the sword?

<span id="ix.i-p53"></span>**26.** Et dixit Laban ad Iahacob, Quid
fecisti, et furatus es cor meum, et abduxisti filias meas sicut captivas
gladio?

<span id="ix.i-p54"></span>**27.** Wherefore didst thou flee away
secretly, and steal away from me; and didst not tell me, that I might
have sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with
harp?

<span id="ix.i-p55"></span>**27.** Utquid abscondisti to ut fugeres? et
furatus es me, et non indicasti mihi, et dimisissem to cum laetitia et
canticis, cum tympano et cithara.

<span id="ix.i-p56"></span>**28.** And hast not suffered me to kiss my
sons and my daughters? thou hast now done foolishly in *so* doing.

<span id="ix.i-p57"></span>**28.** Et non permisisti mihi, ut oscularer
filios meos et filias meas: nunc stulte egisti sic faciendo.

<span id="ix.i-p58"></span>**29.** It is in the power of my hand to do
you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying,
Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

<span id="ix.i-p59"></span>**29.** Est fortitudo in manu mea ad
inferendum vobis malum: sed Deus patris vestri nocte praeterita dixit ad
me, dicendo, Cave tibi ne loquaris cum Iahacob a bono usque ad malum.

<span id="ix.i-p60"></span>**30.** And now, *though* thou wouldest needs
be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house, *yet*
wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?

<span id="ix.i-p61"></span>**30.** Et nunc eundo ivisti: si desiderando
desirabas ire ad domum patris tui, utquid furatus es deos meos?

<span id="ix.i-p62"></span>**31.** And Jacob answered and said to Laban,
Because I was afraid: for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by
force thy daughters from me.

<span id="ix.i-p63"></span>**31.** Et respondit Iahacob, et dixit ad
Laban, Quia timui, si dixissem, ne forte raperes filias tuas a me.

<span id="ix.i-p64"></span>**32.** With whomsoever thou findest thy
gods, let him not live: before our brethren discern thou what *is* thine
with me, and take *it* to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had
stolen them.

<span id="ix.i-p65"></span>**32.** Is, cum quo inveneris deos tuos non
vivat coram fratribus nostris, agnosce si quid est apud me de tuo, et
cape tibi: nesciebat autem Iahacob, quod Rachel furata esset eos.

<span id="ix.i-p66"></span>**33.** And Laban went into Jacob’s tent, and
into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents; but he found
*them* not. Then went he out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s
tent.

<span id="ix.i-p67"></span>**33.** Et venit Laban in tabernaculum
Iahacob, et in tabernaculum Leah, et in tabernaculum ambarum ancillarum,
et non invenit: et egressus de tabernaculo Lea, venit in tabernaculum
Rachel.

<span id="ix.i-p68"></span>**34.** Now Rachel had taken the images, and
put them in the camel’s furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched
all the tent, but found *them* not.

<span id="ix.i-p69"></span>**34.** Rachel autem acceperat idola, et
posuerat ea in clitellis cameli, et sedebat super ea: et contrectavit
Laban totum tabernaculum, et non invenit.

<span id="ix.i-p70"></span>**35.** And she said to her father, Let it
not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom
of women *is* upon me. And he searched, but found not the images.

<span id="ix.i-p71"></span>**35.** Et dixit ad patrem suum, Ne sit ira
in oculis domini mei, quod non possim surgere a facie tua: quia
consuetudo mulierum est mihi: et scrutatus est, et non invenit idola.

<span id="ix.i-p72"></span>**36.** And Jacob was wroth, and chode with
Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What *is* my trespass? what
*is* my sin, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

<span id="ix.i-p73"></span>**36.** Tunc iratus est Iahacob, et jurgatus
est cum Laban: et respondit Iahacob, et dixit ad Laban, Quae est
praevaricatio mea, quod peccatum meum, quod persecutus es me?

<span id="ix.i-p74"></span>**37.** Whereas thou hast searched all my
stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? set *it* here
before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us
both.

<span id="ix.i-p75"></span>**37.** Quando contrectasti omnem
supellectilem meam, quid invenistiex omni supellectili domus tuae? pone
hic coram fratribus meis et fratribus tuis, et declarent inter nos
ambos.

<span id="ix.i-p76"></span>**38.** This twenty years *have* I *been*
with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young, and the
rams of thy flock have I not eaten.

<span id="ix.i-p77"></span>**38.** Iam viginti annos fui tecum; oves
tuae et caprae non abortiverunt: et arietes pecudum tuarum non comedi.

<span id="ix.i-p78"></span>**39.** That which was torn *of beasts* I
brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou
require it, *whether* stolen by day, or stolen by night.

<span id="ix.i-p79"></span>**39.** Raptum non attuli tibi, ego poenas
luebam pro eo: de manu mea requirebas illud, quod furto ablatum erat tam
die quam nocte.

<span id="ix.i-p80"></span>**40.** *Thus* I was; in the day the drought
consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep departed from mine
eyes.

<span id="ix.i-p81"></span>**40.** Ita fui ut interdiu consumeret me
aestus, et gelu in nocte, et recedebat somnus meus ab oculis meis.

<span id="ix.i-p82"></span>**41.** Thus have I been twenty years in thy
house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years
for thy cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

<span id="ix.i-p83"></span>**41.** Iam mihi sunt viginti anni in domo
tua: servivi tibi quatuordecim annos pro duabus filiabus tuis, et sex
annos pro pecudibus tuis, et mutasti mercedem meam decem vicibus.

<span id="ix.i-p84"></span>**42.** Except the God of my father, the God
of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst
sent me away now empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of
my hands, and rebuked *thee* yesternight.

<span id="ix.i-p85"></span>**42.** Nisi Deus patris mei, Deus Abraham,
et pavor Ishac fuisset pro me, certe nunc vacuum dimisisses me:
afflictionem meam et laborem manuum mearum vidit Deus, et increpavit to
nocte praeterita.

<span id="ix.i-p86"></span>**43.** And Laban answered and said unto
Jacob, *These* daughters *are* my daughters, and *these* children *are*
my children, and *these* cattle *are* my cattle, and all that thou seest
*is* mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto
their children which they have born?

<span id="ix.i-p87"></span>**43.** Tunc respondit Laban, et dixit ad
Iahacob, Filiae, filiae meae sunt: et filii, filii mei sunt: et pecudes
meae sunt: et quicquid vides, meum est: et filiabus meis quid faciam
istis hodie, vel filiis earum quos pepererunt?

<span id="ix.i-p88"></span>**44.** Now therefore come thou, let us make
a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

<span id="ix.i-p89"></span>**44.** Et nunc, veni, percutiamus foedus ego
et tu, et erit in testimonium inter me et inter to.

<span id="ix.i-p90"></span>**45.** And Jacob took a stone, and set it up
*for* a pillar.

<span id="ix.i-p91"></span>**45.** Tulit itaque Iahacob lapidem, et
erexit illum in statuam.

<span id="ix.i-p92"></span>**46.** And Jacob said unto his brethren,
Gather stones; and they took stones, and made an heap: and they did eat
there upon the heap.

<span id="ix.i-p93"></span>**46.** Et dixit Iahacob fratribus suis,
Colligite lapides: et tulerunt lapides, et fecerunt cumulum, et
comederunt ibi super cumulum.

<span id="ix.i-p94"></span>**47.** And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha:
but Jacob called it Galeed.

<span id="ix.i-p95"></span>**47.** Et vocavit eum Laban Jegar Sahadutha:
Iahacob autem vocavit eum Galhed.

<span id="ix.i-p96"></span>**48.** And Laban said, This heap *is* a
witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it
called Galeed;

<span id="ix.i-p97"></span>**48.** Et dixit Laban, Cumulus iste sit
testis inter me et to hodie. Idcirco vocavit nomen ejus Galhed,

<span id="ix.i-p98"></span>**49.** And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD
watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.

<span id="ix.i-p99"></span>**49.** Et Mispah: quia dixit, Speculetur
Iehova inter me et to, quando latebimus alter alterum.

<span id="ix.i-p100"></span>**50.** If thou shalt afflict my daughters,
or if thou shalt take *other* wives beside my daughters, no man *is*
with us; see, God *is* witness betwixt me and thee.

<span id="ix.i-p101"></span>**50.** Si afflixeris filias meas, et si
acceperis uxores super filias meas, non est quisquam nobiscum, vide,
Deus est testis inter me et to.

<span id="ix.i-p102"></span>**51.** And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this
heap, and behold *this* pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee;

<span id="ix.i-p103"></span>**51.** Dixit ergo Laban ad Iahacob, Ecce,
cumulus iste, et ecce statua, quam jeci inter me et to.

<span id="ix.i-p104"></span>**52.** This heap *be* witness, and *this*
pillar *be* witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and
that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for
harm.

<span id="ix.i-p105"></span>**52.** Testis cumulus iste, et testis
statua, quod ego non transibo veniens ad to cumulum istum, et statuam
istam, ad malum.

<span id="ix.i-p106"></span>**53.** The God of Abraham, and the God of
Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the
fear of his father Isaac.

<span id="ix.i-p107"></span>**53.** Deus Abraham et Deus Nachor judicet
inter nos, Deus patris eorum: et juravit Iahacob per pavorem patris sui
Ishac.

<span id="ix.i-p108"></span>**54.** Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon
the mount, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread,
and tarried all night in the mount.

<span id="ix.i-p109"></span>**54.** Et mactavit Iahacob victimam in
monte, et vocavit fratres suos, ut comederent panem: et comederunt
panem, et pernoctaverunt in monte.

<span id="ix.i-p110"></span>**55.** And early in the morning Laban rose
up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban
departed, and returned unto his place.

<span id="ix.i-p111"></span>**55.** Et surrexit Laban mane, et osculatus
est filios suos ac filias suas, benedixitque eis, et abiit: et reversus
est Laban ad locum suum.

<span id="ix.i-p112"></span> 

<span id="ix.i-p113"></span><span id="ix.i-p113.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p114"></span>**1.** *And he heard the words*. Although
Jacob ardently desired his own country, and was continually thinking of
his return to it; yet his admirable patience appears in this, that he
suspends his purpose till a new occasion presents itself. I do not,
however, deny, that some imperfection was mixed with this virtue, in
that he did not make more haste to return; but that the promise of God
was always retained its his mind will shortly appear. In this respect,
however, he showed something of human nature, that for the sake of
obtaining wealth he postponed his return for six years: for when Laban
was perpetually changing his terms, he might justly have bidden him
farewell. But that he was detained by force and fear together, we infer
from his clandestine flight. Now, at least, he has a sufficient cause
for asking his dismissal; because his riches had become grievous and
hateful to the sons of Laban: nevertheless he does not dare openly to
withdraw himself from their enmity, but is compelled to flee secretly.
Yet though his tardiness is in some degree excusable, it was probably
connected with indolence; even as the faithful, when they direct their
course towards God, often do not pursue it with becoming fervor.
Wherefore, whenever the indolence of the flesh retards us, let us learn
to fan the ardor of our spirits into a flame. There is no doubt that the
Lord corrected the infirmity of his servant, and gently spurred him on
as he proceeded in his course. For if Laban had treated him kindly and
pleasantly, his mind would have been lulled to sleep; but now he is
driven away by adverse looks. So the Lord often better secures the
salvation of his people, by subjecting them to the hatred, the envy, and
the malevolence of the wicked, than by suffering them to be soothed with
bland address. It was far more useful to holy Jacob to have his
father-in-law and his sons opposed, than to have them courteously
obsequious to his wishes; because their favor might have deprived him of
the blessing of God. We also have more than sufficient experience of the
power of earthly attractions, and of the ease with which, when they
abound, the oblivion of celestial blessings steals over us. Wherefore
let us not think it hard to be awakened by the Lord, when we fall into
adversity, or receive but little favor from the world; for hatred,
threats, disgrace, and slanders, are often more advantageous to us than
the applause of all men on every side. Moreover, we must notice the
inhumanity of Laban’s sons, who complain throughout as if they had been
plundered by Jacob. But sordid and avaricious men labor under the
disease of thinking that they are robbed of everything with which they
do not gorge themselves. For since their avarice is insatiable, it
follows of necessity that the prosperity of others torments them, as if
they themselves would be thereby reduced to want. They do not consider
whether Jacob acquired this great wealth justly or unjustly; but they
are enraged and envious, because they conceive that so much has been
abstracted from them. Laban had before confessed, that he had been
enriched by the coming of Jacob, and even that he had been blessed by
the Lord for Jacob’s sake; but now his sons murmur, and he himself is
tortured with grief, to find that Jacob also is made a partaker of the
same blessing. Hence we perceive the blindness of avarice which can
never be satisfied. Whence also it is called by Paul the root of all
evil; because they who desire to swallow up everything must be
perfidious, and cruel, and ungrateful, and in every way unjust. Besides,
it is to be observed that the sons of Laban, in the impetuosity of their
younger years, give vent to their vexation; but the father, like a
cunning old fox, is silent, yet betrays his wickedness by his
countenance.

<span id="ix.i-p115"></span><span id="ix.i-p115.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p116"></span>**3.** *And the Lord said unto Jacob*. The
timidity of the holy man is here more plainly seen; for he, perceiving
that evil was designed against him by his father-in-law, still dared not
to move a foot, unless encouraged by a new oracle. But the Lord, who, by
facts, had shown him already that no longer delay was to be made, now
also urges him by words. Let us learn from this example, that although
the Lord may incite us to duty by adversity, yet we shall thereby profit
little, unless the stimulus of the word be added. And we see what will
happen to the reprobate; for either they become stupefied in their
wickedness, or they break out into fury. Wherefore, that the instruction
conveyed by outward things may profit us, we must ask the Lord to shine
upon us in his own word. The design, however, of Moses chiefly refers to
this point, that we may know that Jacob returned to his own country,
under the special guidance of God. Now the land of Canaan is called the
land of Abraham and Isaac, not because they had sprung from it; but
because it had been divinely promised to them as their inheritance.
Wherefore, by this voice the holy man was admonished, that although
Isaac had been a stranger, yet, in the sight of God, he was the heir and
lord of that land, in which he possessed nothing but a sepulcher.

<span id="ix.i-p118"></span>**4.** *And Jacob sent*. He sends for his
wives, in order to explain to them his intention, and to exhort them to
accompany him in his flight; for it was his duty as a good husband to
take them away with him; and therefore it was necessary to inform them
of his design. And he was not so blind as to be unmindful of the many
dangers of his plan. It was difficult to convey women, who had never
left their father’s house, to a remote region, by an unknown journey.
Moreover, there was ground to fear lest they, in seeking protection for
themselves, might betray their husband to his enemies. The coverage of
many would so far have failed them, in such a state of perturbation,
that they would have disregarded conjugal fidelity, to provide for their
own safety. Jacob, therefore, acted with great constancy in choosing
rather to expose himself to danger than to fail in the duty of a good
husband and master of a family. If his wives had refused to accompany
him, the call of God would have compelled him to depart. But God granted
him what was far more desirable, that his whole family, with one
consent, were prepared to follow him: moreover, his wives, with whose
mutual strifes his house before had rung, now freely consent to go with
him into exile. So the Lord, when in good faith we discharge our duty,
and shun nothing which he commands, enables us to succeed, even in the
most doubtful affairs. Further, from the fact that Jacob calls his wives
to him into the field, we infer what an anxious life he led. Certainly
it would have been a primary convenience of his life, to dwell at home
with his wives. He was already advanced in age, and worn down with many
toils; and therefore he had the greater need of their service. Yet
satisfied with a cottage in which he might watch over his flock, he
lived apart from them. If, then, there had been a particle of equity in
Laban and his sons, they would have found no cause for envy.

<span id="ix.i-p119"></span><span id="ix.i-p119.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p120"></span>**5.** *I see your father’s countenance*.
This address consists of two parts. For first, he speaks of his own
integrity, and expostulates concerning the perfidy of his father-in-law.
He next testifies that God is the author of his prosperity, in order
that Rachel and Leah may the more willingly accompany him. And whereas
he had become very rich in a short space of time, he purges himself from
all suspicion; and even appeals to them as witnesses of his diligence.
And though Moses does not minutely relate everything; yet there is no
doubt that the honesty of their husband had been made clear to them by
many proofs, and that, on the other hand, the injuries, frauds, and
rapacity of their father, were well known. When he complains that his
wages had been changed ten times, it is probable that the number ten is
simply put for *many* times. Nevertheless it may be, that within six
years Laban might thus frequently have broken his agreements; since
there would be twice as many seasons of breeding lambs, namely, at
spring and autumn, as we have said. But this narration of the dream,
although it follows in a subsequent part of the history, shows that holy
Jacob had undertaken nothing but by the Divine command. Moses had before
related the transaction simply, saying nothing respecting the counsel
from which it had proceeded; but now, in the person of Jacob himself, he
removes all doubt respecting it; for he does not intimate that Jacob was
lying, in order, by this artifice, to deceive his wives; but he
introduces the holy servant of God, avowing truly, and without pretense,
the case as it really was. For otherwise he would have abused the name
of God, not without abominable impiety, by connecting this vision with
that former one, in which we see that the gate of heaven was opened unto
him.

<span id="ix.i-p121"></span><span id="ix.i-p121.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p122"></span>**13.** *I am the God of Beth-el*. It is not
wonderful that the angel should assume the person of God: either because
God the Father appeared to the holy patriarchs in his own Word, as in a
lively mirror, and that under the form of an angel; or because angels,
speaking by the command of God, rightly utter their words, as from his
mouth. For the prophets are accustomed to this form of speaking; not
that they may exalt themselves into the place of God; but only that the
majesty of God, whose ministers they are, may shine forth in his
message. Now, it is proper that we should more carefully consider the
force of this form of expression. He does not call himself the God of
Bethel, because he is confined within the limits of a given place, but
for the purpose of renewing to his servant the remembrance of his own
promise; for holy Jacob had not yet attained to that degree of
perfection which rendered the more simple rudiments unnecessary for him.
But little light of true doctrine at that time prevailed; and even that
was wrapped in many shadows. Nearly the whole world had apostatized to
false gods; and that region, nay, even the house of his father-in-law,
was filled with unholy superstitions. Therefore, amid so many
hindrances, nothing was more difficult for him than to hold his faith in
the one true God firm and invincible. Wherefore, in the first place,
pure religion is commended to him, in order that, among the various
errors of the world, he may adhere to the obedience and worship of that
God whom he had once known. Secondly; the promise which he had before
received is anew confirmed to him, in order that he may always keep his
mind fixed on the special covenant which God had made with Abraham and
his posterity. Thus he is directed to the land of Canaan, which was his
own inheritance; lest the temporal blessing of God, which he was soon to
enjoy, should detain his heart in Mesopotamia. For since this oracle was
only an appendix of the previous one, whatever benefits God afterwards
bestowed ought to be referred to that first design. We may also
conjecture from this passage, that Jacob had before preached to his
household concerning the true God and the true religion, as became a
pious father of his family. For he would have acted absurdly in uttering
this discourse, unless his wives had been previously instructed
respecting that wonderful vision. To the same point belongs what he had
said before, that the God of his father had brought him assistance. For
it is just as if he would openly distinguish the God whom he worshipped
from the god of Laban. And now, because he holds familiar discourse with
his wives, as on subjects which they know, the conjecture is probable,
that it was not Jacob’s fault if they were not imbued with the knowledge
of the one God, and with sincere piety. Further, by this oracle the Lord
declared that he is always mindful of the godly, even when they seem to
be cast down and deserted. For who would not have said that the outcast
Jacob was now deprived of all celestial help? And truly the Lord appears
to him late; but beyond all expectation shows, that he had never been
forgetful of him. Let the faithful, also, at this day, feel that he is
the same towards them; and if, in any way, the wicked tyrannically
oppress them by unjust violence, let them bear it patiently, until at
length, in due time, he shall avenge them.

<span id="ix.i-p123"></span><span id="ix.i-p123.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p124"></span>**14.** *And Rachel and Leah answered*. Here
we perceive that to be fulfilled which Paul teaches, that all things
work together for good to the children of God. (<span
id="ix.i-p124.1"></span>[Ro 8:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#028.md)<span
id="ix.i-p124.1"></span>.) For since the wives of Jacob had been
unjustly treated by their father, they so far act in opposition to the
natural tenderness of their sex, that at the desire of their husband,
they become willing to follow him into a distant and unknown region.
Therefore, if Jacob is compelled to take many and very bitter draughts
of grief, he is now cheered by the most satisfying compensation, that
his wives are not separated from him by their attachment to their
father’s house: but rather, being overcome by the irksome nature of
their sufferings, they earnestly undertake to join him in his flight.
“There is nothing,” they say, “which should cause us to remain with our
father; for daughters adhere to their fathers, because they are esteemed
members of his family; but what a cruel rejection is this, not only that
he has passed us off without dowry,  <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) but that he has set us to sale, and has
devoured the price for which he sold us?” By the word *money* (<span
id="ix.i-p125.2"></span>[Ge 31:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#015.md)<span
id="ix.i-p125.2"></span>), I understand the price of sale. For they
complain that, at least, they had not received, instead of dowry, the
profit which had been unjustly extorted from their husband, but this
gain also had been unjustly suppressed by their covetous father.
Therefore the particle <span id="ix.i-p125.3"></span>םג (*gam*) is
inserted, which is used for the purpose of amplification among the
Hebrews. For this increased not a little the meanness of Laban, that, as
an insatiable whirlpool, he had absorbed the gain acquired by this most
dishonorable traffic. And it is to be noted, that they were then devoted
to their husband, and were therefore free to depart from their father;
especially since they knew that the hand of God was stretched out to
them. There is also no doubt, seeing they were persuaded that Jacob was
a faithful prophet of God, but that they freely embraced the heavenly
oracle from his mouth; for at the close of their reply, they show that
they did not so much yield to his wish as to the command of God.

<span id="ix.i-p126"></span><span id="ix.i-p126.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p127"></span>**16.** *For all the riches which God has
taken from our father*. Rachel and Leah confirm the speech of Jacob; but
yet in a profane and common manner, not with a lively and pure sense of
religion. For they only make a passing allusion to the fact, that God,
in pity to his servant, had deigned to honor him with peculiar favor;
and in the meantime, insist upon a reason of little solidity, that what
they were carrying away was justly their due, because a part of the
inheritance pertained to them. They do not argue that the riches they
possessed were theirs, because they had been justly acquired by the
labor of their husband; but because they themselves ought not to have
been defrauded of their dowry, and now deprived of their lawful
inheritance. For this reason they mention also their children with
themselves, as having sprung from the blood of Laban. By this method
they not only obscure the blessing of God, but indulge themselves in
greater license than is right. They also form a mean estimate of their
husband’s labors, in boasting that the fruit of those labors proceeded
from themselves. Wherefore we are, by no means, to seek hence a
precedent for the way in which each is to defend his own right, or to
attempt the recovery of it, when it has been unjustly wrested from him.

<span id="ix.i-p128"></span><span id="ix.i-p128.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p129"></span>**17.** *Then Jacob rose up*. The departure
of Jacob Moses afterwards more fully relates, he now only briefly says
that “he rose up;” by which he means, that as soon as he could obtain
the consent of his wives to go with him, he yielded to no other
obstacles. Herein appears the manly strength and constancy of his mind.
For Moses leaves many things to be reflected upon by his readers; and
especially that intermediate period, during which the holy man was
doubtless agitated with a multiplicity of cares. He had believed that
his exile from home would be only for a short time: but, deprived of the
sight of his parents and of his native soil during twenty years, he
suffered many things so severe and bitter, that the endurance of them
might have rendered him callous, or, at least, might have so oppressed
him as to have consumed the remnant of his life. He was now verging
towards old age, and the coldness of old age produces tardiness. Yet the
flight for which he was preparing was not free from danger. Therefore it
was necessary that he should be armed with the spirit of fortitude, in
order that the vigor and alacrity of which Moses speaks, might cause him
to hasten his steps. And since we read that the departure of the holy
man was effected by stealth, and was attended with discredit; let us
learn, whenever God abases us, to turn our minds to such examples as
this.

<span id="ix.i-p130"></span><span id="ix.i-p130.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p131"></span>**19.** *And Rachel had stolen*. Although
the Hebrews sometimes call those images <span
id="ix.i-p131.1"></span>םיפרת (*teraphim*,) which are not set forth as
objects of worship: yet since this term is commonly used in an ill
sense, I do not doubt that they were the household gods of Laban.  <span
id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md) Even he himself, shortly afterwards,
expressly calls them his gods. It appears hence how great is the
propensity of the human mind to idolatry: since in all ages this evil
has prevailed; namely, that men seek out for themselves visible
representations of God. From the death of Noah not yet two hundred years
had elapsed; Shem had departed but a little while before; his teaching,
handed down by tradition, ought most of all to have flourished among the
posterity of Terah; because the Lord had chosen this family to himself,
as the only sanctuary on earth in which he was to be worshipped in
purity. The voice of Shem himself was sounding in their ears until the
death of Abraham.; yet now, from Terah himself, the common filth of
superstition inundated this place, while the patriarch Shem was still
living and speaking. And though there is no doubt that he endeavored,
with all his power, to bring back his descendants to a right mind, we
see what was his success. It is not indeed to be believed, that Bethuel
had been entirely ignorant of the call of Abraham; yet neither he, with
his family, was, on that account, withdrawn from this vanity. Holy Jacob
also had not been silent during twenty years, but had endeavored, by
counsel and admonition, to correct these gross vices, but in vain;
because superstition, in its violent course, prevailed. Therefore, that
idolatry is almost innate in the human mind, the very antiquity of its
origin bears witness. And that it is so firmly fixed there as scarcely
to be capable of being uprooted, shows its obstinacy. But it is still
more absurd, that not even Rachel could be healed of this contagion, in
so great a length of time. She had often heard her husband speaking of
the true and genuine worship of God: yet she is so addicted to the
corruptions which she had imbibed from her childhood, that she is ready
to infect the land chosen by God with them. She imagines that, with her
husband, she is following God as her leader, and at the same time takes
with her the idols by which she would subvert his worship. It is even
possible that by the excessive indulgence of his beloved wife, Jacob
might give too much encouragement to such superstitions. Wherefore, let
pious fathers of families learn to use their utmost diligence that no
stain of evil may remain in their wives or children. Some
inconsiderately excuse Rachel, on the ground that, by a pious theft, she
wished to purge her father’s house from idols. But if this had been her
design, why, in crossing the Euphrates, did she not cast away these
abominations? Why did she not, after her departure, explain to her
husband what she had done? But there is no need of conjecture, since,
from the sequel of the history, it is manifest that the house of Jacob
was polluted with idols, even to the time of the violation of Dinah. It
was not, then, the piety of Rachel, but her insane hankering after
superstition which impelled her to the theft: because she thought that
God could not be worshipped but through idols; for this is the source of
the disease, that since men are carnal, they imagine God to be carnal
too.

<span id="ix.i-p133"></span><span id="ix.i-p133.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p134"></span>**20.** *And Jacob stole away unawares to
Laban*  <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md) By the Hebrew form of
expression, “stole away the heart of Laban,” Moses shows that Jacob
departed privately, or by stealth, unknown to his father-in-law.
Meanwhile, he wishes to point out to what straits Jacob was reduced, so
that he had no hope of deliverance but in flight. For Laban had
determined to hold him all his life as a captive, as if he had been a
slave bound to the soil, or sentenced to the mines. Therefore let us
also learn, by his example, when the Lord calls us, courageously to
strive against every kind of obstacle, and not to be surprised if many
arduous difficulties oppose themselves against us.

<span id="ix.i-p136"></span><span id="ix.i-p136.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p137"></span>**22.** *And it was told Laban*. The Lord
gave to his servant the interval of a three-days’ journey, so that
having passed the Euphrates, he might enter the boundaries of the
promised land. And perhaps, in the mean time, he cooled the rage of
Laban, the assault of which, in its first heat, might have been
intolerable severe.  <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) By afterward
permitting Jacob to be intercepted in the midst of his journey, God
intended to tender his own interposition the more illustrious. It seemed
desirable that Jacob’s course should not be interrupted, and that he
should not be filled with alarm by the hostile approach of his
father-in-law; but when Laban, like a savage wild beast, breathing
nothing but slaughter, is suddenly restrained by the Lord, this was far
more likely to confirm the faith of the holy man, and therefore far more
useful to him. For, as in the very act of giving assistance, the power
of God shone forth more clearly; so, relying on divine help, he passed
more courageously through remaining trials. Whence we learn, that those
perturbations which, at the time, are troublesome to us, yet tend to our
salvation, if only we obediently submit to the will of God; who
purposely thus tries us, that he may indeed show more fully the care
which he takes of us. It was a sad and miserable sight, that Jacob,
taking so large a family with him, should flee as if his conscience had
accused him of evil: but it was far more bitter and more formidable,
that Laban, intent on his destruction, should threaten his life. Yet the
method of his deliverance, which is described by Moses, was more
illustrious than any victory. For God, descending from heaven to bring
assistance to his servant, places himself between the parties, and in a
moment assuages the indomitable fury with which Laban was inflamed.

<span id="ix.i-p139"></span><span id="ix.i-p139.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p140"></span>**23.** *And pursued him seven days’
journey*. Since the cruelty of Laban was now appeased, or at least
bridled, he did not dare severely to threaten; but laying aside his
ferocity, he descended to feigned and hypocritical blandishments. He
complains that injury had been done him, because he had been kept in
ignorance of Jacob’s departure, whom he would rather leave sent forth
with customary tokens of joy, in token of his paternal affection. Thus
hypocrites, when the power of inflicting injury is taken away from them,
heap false complaints upon the good and simple, as if the blame rested
with them. Wherefore, if at any time wicked and perfidious men, when
they have unjustly harassed us, put forward some pretext of equity on
their own part, we must bear with the iniquity; not because a just
defense is to be entirely omitted; but because we find it inevitable
that perverse men, ever ready to speak evil, will shamelessly cast upon
us the blame of crimes of which we are innocent. Meanwhile, we must
prudently guard against giving them the occasion against us which they
seek.

<span id="ix.i-p141"></span><span id="ix.i-p141.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p142"></span>**29.** *It is in the power of my hand*. The
Hebrew phrase is different, “my hand is to power;” yet the meaning is
clear, that Laban declares he is ready to take vengeance. Some expound
the words thus: “my hand is to God;” but from other places it appears
that the word <span id="ix.i-p142.1"></span>לא (*el*) is taken for
*power*. But Laban, inflated with foolish boasting, contradicts himself;
for whereas he had been forbidden by God to attempt anything against
Jacob, where was the *power* of which he boasted? We see, therefore, he
precipitates himself by a blind impulse, as if, at his own pleasure, he
could do anything against the purpose of God. For when he perceives that
God is opposed to him, he yet does not hesitate to glory in his own
strength; and why is this, unless he aimed at being superior to God?
Finally; pride is always the companion of unbelief; so that unbelievers,
although vanquished, yet cease not impetuously to rise up against God.
To this they add another sin, that they complain of being unjustly
oppressed by God.

<span id="ix.i-p143"></span>*But the God of your father*. Why does he
not also acknowledge God as his own God, unless because Satan had so
fascinated his mind already, that he chose rather to wander in darkness
than to turn to the light presented before him? Willingly or
unwillingly, he is compelled to yield to the God of Abraham; and yet he
defrauds him of the glory which is due, by retaining those fictitious
deities by which he had been deceived. We see then that the ungodly,
even when they have had proof of the power of God, yet do not entirely
submit themselves to his authority. Wherefore, when God manifests
himself to us, we must also seek from heaven the spirit of meekness,
which shall bend and subdue us to obedience unto himself.

<span id="ix.i-p144"></span><span id="ix.i-p144.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p145"></span>**30.** *Wherefore hast thou stolen my
gods?*  <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) The second head of
accusation which is alleged against Jacob is, that he had not departed
through love to his country, nor for any just and probable cause; but
that, in fact, he was implicated in an act of robbery. Heavy and
disgraceful charge, of which Jacob was far from being guilty! But we
learn hence, that no one can live so innocently in the world, but he
must sometimes bear undeserved reproach and marks of infamy. Whenever
this may happen to us, let that precious promise sustain us, that the
Lord, in his own time, will bring forth our innocence as the morning
light. (<span id="ix.i-p146.1"></span>[Ps
37:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#006)<span id="ix.i-p146.1"></span>..md)
For by this artifice Satan attempts to seduce us from the practice of
well-doing, when, without any fault of ours, we are traduced by false
calumnies. And since the world is ungrateful, it often makes the very
worst return for acts of kindness. Some, indeed, are found, who, with
heroic magnanimity, despise unfavourable reports, because they esteem
the testimony of a good conscience more highly than depraved popular
opinion. But it behoves the faithful to look to God, that their
conscience may never fail them. We see that Laban calls his gods <span
id="ix.i-p146.2"></span>םיפרת (*teraphim*,) not because he thought the
Deity was enclosed within them; but because he worshipped these images
in honor of the gods. Or rather, because, when he was about to pay
homage to God, he turned himself to those images. At this day, by the
sole difference of a word, the Papists think they skilfully effect their
escape, because they do not attribute to idols the name of gods. But the
subterfuge is frivolous, since in reality they are altogether alike; for
they pour forth before pictures or statues whatever honor they
acknowledge to be due to the one God. To the ancient idolaters the
pretext was not wanting, that by a metonymy they styled those images
gods, which were formed for the sake of representing God.

<span id="ix.i-p147"></span><span id="ix.i-p147.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p148"></span>**31.** *And Jacob answered*. He briefly
refutes each head of the accusation: with respect to his secret
departure, he modestly excuses himself, as having been afraid that he
might be deprived of his wives. And in this way he takes part of the
blame to himself, deeming it sufficient to exonerate himself from the
malice of which he was thought to be guilty. He does not dispute, as a
casuist, whether it was lawful to depart by stealth; but leaves it
undetermined whether or not his fear was culpable. Let all the children
of God learn to imitate this modesty, lest through an immoderate desire
to vindicate their own reputation, they should rush into contentions:
just as we have seen many raise tragic scenes out of nothing, because
they will not endure that any censure, however trifling, should be cast
upon them. Jacob, therefore, was content with this excuse, that he had
done nothing wickedly. His defense on the other charge follows, in which
Jacob shows his confidence, by adjudicating the person to death, with
whom the things stolen should be found.  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) He speaks, indeed, from his heart; but if
the truth had then been discovered, he must, of necessity, have been
ashamed of his rashness. Therefore, though he was not conscious of
guilt, he yet singled through excessive haste, in not having diligently
inquired before he pronounced concerning a doubtful matter. He ought to
have called both his wives and his children, and to have inquired of
each how the affair stood. He was, indeed, persuaded, that his family
was so well conducted, that no suspicion of the theft had ever entered
into his mind; but he ought not so to have relied upon his own
discipline, as to be free from fear when a crime is alleged against his
family. Wherefore, let us learn to suspend our judgment in matters of
which we are ignorant, lest we should repent too late of our temerity.
We may add, that hence it happened, that the pollution which he might
have exterminated immediately, continued still longer in the family of
Jacob.

<span id="ix.i-p150"></span><span id="ix.i-p150.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p151"></span>**32.** *That Rachel had stolen them*. Moses
relates the manner in which Rachel had concealed her theft; namely, by
sitting on the idols, and pretending the custom of women as her excuse.
It is a question, whether she did this through shame or pertinacity. It
was disgraceful to be caught in the act of theft; she also dreaded the
severe sentence of her husband. Yet to me it appears probable that fear
did not so much influence her as the obstinate love of idolatry. For we
know how greatly superstition infatuates the mind. Therefore, as if she
had obtained an incomparable treasure, she thinks that she must attempt
anything rather than allow herself to be deprived of it. Moreover, she
chooses rather to incur the displeasure of her father and her husband,
than to relinquish the object of her superstition. To her stratagem she
also adds lying words, so that she deserves manifold censure.

<span id="ix.i-p152"></span><span id="ix.i-p152.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p153"></span>**36.** *And Jacob was wroth, and chode with
Laban*. Jacob again acts amiss, in contending with Laban about a matter
not sufficiently known, and in wrongfully fastening on him the charge of
calumny. For although he supposed all his family to be free from blame,
yet he was deceived by his own negligence. He acts, indeed, with
moderation, because in expostulating with Laban he does not use
reproaches; but in this he is not to be excused, that he undertakes the
cause of his whole family, when they were not exempt from blame. If any
one should make the objection to this statement, that Jacob was
constrained by fear, because Laban had brought with him a great band of
companions: the circumstances themselves show, that his mind was thus
influenced by moderation rather than by fear. For he boldly resists, and
shows no sign of fear; only he abstains from the insolence of evil
speaking. He then adds that he had just cause of accusation against
Laban; not because he wished to rise in a spirit of recrimination
against his father-in-law; but because it was right that the kindred and
associates of Laban should be made witnesses of all that had passed, in
order that, by the protracted patient endurance of Jacob, his integrity
might be the more manifest. Jacob also calls to mind, not only that he
had been a faithful keeper of the flock, but also that his labor had
been rendered prosperous by the blessing of God; he adds, besides, that
he had been held accountable for all losses. In this he insinuates
against Laban the charge of great injustice: for it was not the duty of
Jacob voluntarily to inflame the avarice and rapacity of his
father-in-law, by attempting to soothe him; but he yielded, by
constraint, to his injuries. When he says that sleep departed from his
eyes, he not only intimates that he passed sleepless nights, but that he
had so contended against nature itself, as to defraud himself of
necessary repose.

<span id="ix.i-p154"></span><span id="ix.i-p154.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p155"></span>**42.** *Except the God of my father*. Jacob
here ascribes it to the favor of God, that he was not about to return
home entirely empty; whereby he not only aggravates the sin of Laban,
but meets an objection which might seem at variance with his complaints.
He therefore denies that he has been made rich by the kindness of his
father-in-law; but testifies that he has been favourably regarded by the
Lord: as if he had said, I owe it not to thee, that thou hast not
further injured me; but God, who is propitious to me, has withstood
thee. Now, since God is not the defender of unfaithfulness, nor is wont
to help the wicked, the integrity of Jacob may be ascertained from the
fact that God interposed as his vindicator. It is also to be observed,
that by expressly distinguishing the God of Abraham from all fictitious
gods, he declares that there is no other true God: by which he, at the
same time, proves himself to be a truly pious worshipper. The expression
“the fear of Isaac,” is to be taken passively for the God whom Isaac
revered; just as, on account of the reverence due to him, he is called
the “fear and the dread” of his people.  <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) A similar expression occurs immediately
after, in the same chapter. Now the pious, while they fear God, are by
no means horror — struck at his presence, like the reprobates; but
trembling at his judgment, they walk circumspectly before him.

<span id="ix.i-p157"></span>*God has seen my affliction, and the labor
of my hands*. This was spoken from a pious feeling that God would bring
help to him when afflicted, if he should conduct himself with fidelity
and honesty. Therefore, in order that the Lord may sustain us with his
favor, let us learn to discharge our duty rightly; let us not flee from
our proper work; and let us not refuse to purchase peace by submitting
to many inconveniences. Further, if they from whom we have deserved well
treat us severely and unjustly, let us bear our cross in hope and in
silence, until the Lord shall succor us: for he will never forsake us,
as the whole Scripture testifies. But Jacob distinctly presses his
father-in-law with his own confession. For why had God rebuked him,
unless because he was persecuting an innocent man in defiance of justice
and equity; for as I have lately intimated, it is abhorrent to the
nature of God to favor evil and unjust causes.

<span id="ix.i-p158"></span><span id="ix.i-p158.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p159"></span>**43.** *These daughters are my daughters*.
Laban begins now to speak in a manner very different from before: he
sees that he has no farther ground of contention. Therefore, being
convinced, he buries all strife, and glides into placid and amicable
discourse. “Why,” he asks, “should I be hostile to thee, when all things
between us are common? Shall I rage against my own bowels? For both thy
wives and thy children are my own blood; wherefore I ought to be
affected towards you, as if you all were part of myself.”  <span
id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) He now answers like an honorable man.
Whence, then, has this humanity so suddenly sprung up in the breast of
him who lately had been hurried onward, without any respect to right or
wrong, to ruin Jacob; unless it were, that he knew Jacob to have acted
towards him with fidelity, and to have been at length compelled by
necessity to adopt the design of departing by stealth? And this was an
indication that he was not absolutely desperate: for we may find many
persons of such abandoned impudence, that though overcome and silenced
by arguments, they yet do not cease to rush headlong in insane
rebellion. From this passage we infer, that although avarice and other
sinful affections take away judgment and soundness of mind; there yet
remains a knowledge of truth engraven on the souls of men, which being
stirred up emits scintillations, to prevent the universal triumph of
depravity. If any one before had said, What does thou, Laban? What
brutality is this to rage against thine own bowels? the remonstrance
would not have been heard, for he burned with headstrong fury. But now
he voluntarily suggests this to himself, and proclaims what he would
have been unwilling to hear from another. It appears, then, that the
light of justice which now breaks forth, had been smothered in his mind.
In short, it is self-love alone which blinds us; because we all judge
aright where personal interests are not concerned. If, however, it
should so happen that we are for a time in perplexity, we must still
seek to obey the dictates of reason and justice. But if any one hardens
himself in wickedness, the interior and hidden knowledge, of which I
have spoken, will yet remain engraven in his mind, and will suffice for
his condemnation.

<span id="ix.i-p161"></span><span id="ix.i-p161.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p162"></span>**44.** *Let us make a covenant, I and
thou*. Laban here acts as men conscious of guilt are wont to do, when
they wish to guard themselves against revenge: and this kind of
trepidation and anxiety is the just reward of evil deeds. Besides,
wicked men always judge of others from their own disposition: whence it
happens that they have fears on all sides. Moses before relates a
somewhat similar example, when Abimelech made a covenant with Isaac.
Wherefore we must take the greater care, if we desire to possess
tranquil minds, that we act sincerely and without injury towards our
neighbors. Meanwhile Moses shows how placable Jacob was, and how easily
he permitted himself to be conciliated. He had endured very many and
grievous wrongs; but now, forgetting all, he freely stretches out the
hand of kindness: and so far is he from being pertinacious in defending
his own right, that he, in a manner, anticipates Laban himself, being
the first to take a stone, and set it up for a pillar. And truly it
becomes the children of God, not only with alacrity to embrace peace,
but even ardently to search for it, as we are commanded in <span
id="ix.i-p162.1"></span>[Ps 34:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#014.md)<span
id="ix.i-p162.1"></span>  <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) As to
the heap of stones, it was always the practice to use some ceremony
which might confirm the compact on both sides; on this occasion a heap
of stones is raised, in order that the memory of the covenant might be
transmitted to posterity. That Jacob took part in this was a proof, as
we have said, of a mind disposed to peace. He freely complained, indeed,
when it was right to do so; but when the season of pacification arrived,
he showed that he cherished no rancour. Moses, in relating afterwards
that they did eat there, upon the heap, does not observe the order of
the history. For, on both sides, the conditions of the covenant were
agreed upon and declared, before the feast was celebrated: but this
figure of speech (as we have before seen) was sufficiently in use.

<span id="ix.i-p164"></span><span id="ix.i-p164.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p165"></span>**47.** *And Laban called it*. Each, in his
own language, gives a name, of the same signification, to the heap.
Whence it appears, that Laban used the Syrian tongue, though born of the
race of Heber. But it is not wonderful that he, dwelling among Syrians,
should have accustomed himself to the language as well as to the manners
of the Syrians. And a little before, he is twice called a Syrian; as if
Moses would describe him as degenerate, and alienated from the Hebrews.
But this seems by no means accordant with the previous history, where we
read that the daughters of Laban gave Hebrew names to their sons. Yet
the solution is not difficult; for since the affinity between these
languages was great, the inflection of one word into another was easy:
besides, if the wives of Jacob were tractable, it is not surprising that
they should have learned his language. And beyond doubt, he would
himself make a point of this matter: seeing he knew that his family was
separated from the rest of the nations. Moses, in using the name of
Galeed, does it proleptically; for since he was writing for his own
times, he does not scruple to give it the generally received name.
Moreover we hence infer, that ceremonies and rites ought to refer to
that which those who use them mutually agree upon. Which rule also ought
to be applied to the sacraments; because if the word by which God enters
into covenant with us be taken away, useless and dead figures will alone
remain.

<span id="ix.i-p166"></span><span id="ix.i-p166.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p167"></span>**49.** *The Lord watch between me and
thee*. Laban commits to the judgment of God, for vengeance, whatever
offense either of them should be guilty of against the other in his
absence; as if he would say, “Though the knowledge of the injury should
not reach me, because I shall be far distant, yet the Lord, who is
everywhere present, will behold it.” Which sentiment he more clearly
expresses afterwards, when he says, “No one is with us; God will be
witness between me and thee.” By which words he means, that God will be
a severe avenger of every wickedness, though there should be no judge
upon earth to decide the cause. And certainly if there were any religion
flourishing within us, the presence of God would influence us far more
than the observation of men. But it arises from the brutal stupidity of
our flesh, that we reverence men only; as if we might mock God with
impunity, when we are not convicted by the testimony of men. If, then,
this common feeling of nature dictated to Laban, that the frauds which
were hidden from men would come into judgment before God; we who enjoy
the light of the gospel should indeed be ashamed to seek a covert for
our fallacies. Hence also, we gather the legitimate use of an oath,
which the Apostle declares in his epistle to the Hebrews; namely, that
men, in order to put an end to their controversies, resort to the
judgment of God.

<span id="ix.i-p168"></span><span id="ix.i-p168.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p169"></span>**50.** *If thou shalt take other wives
besides my daughters*. Laban declares that it would be a species of
perfidy, if Jacob should take to himself any other wives. But he had
himself compelled Jacob to the act of polygamy: for whence was it that
the holy man had more wives than one, except that Leah had been craftily
substituted in the place of Rachel? But he now, from a pure sentiment of
nature, condemns the fault, of which, blinded by avarice, he had
wickedly been the author. And certainly, when the bond of marriage is
broken, than which none among men is more sacred, the whole of human
society sinks into decay. Wherefore, those fanatical men, who, at this
day, delight to defend polygamy, have no need of any other judge than
Laban.

<span id="ix.i-p170"></span><span id="ix.i-p170.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p171"></span>**53.** *The God of Abraham*. It is indeed
rightly and properly done, that Laban should adjure Jacob by the name of
God. For this is the confirmation of covenants; to appeal to God on both
sides, that he may not suffer perfidy to pass unpunished. But he
sinfully blends idols with the true God, between whom there is nothing
in common. Thus, truly, men involved in superstitions, are accustomed to
confound promiscuously sacred things with profane, and the figments of
men with the true God. He is compelled to give some honor to the God of
Abraham, yet he lies plunged in his own idolatrous pollution; and, that
his religion may not appear the worse, he gives it the color of
antiquity. For in calling him the God of his father, he boasts that this
God was handed down to him from his ancestors. Meanwhile Jacob does not
swear superstitiously. For Moses expressly declares, that he sware only
by “the fear of Isaac;” whence we learn that he did not assent to the
preposterous form of oath dictated by his father-in-law; no too many do,
who, in order to gain the favor of the wicked, pretend to be of the same
religion with them. But when once the only God is made known to us, we
wickedly suppress his truth, unless by its light all the clouds of error
are dispersed.

<span id="ix.i-p172"></span><span id="ix.i-p172.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p173"></span>**54.** *And called his brethren to eat
bread*. In courteously receiving his kindred, by whom he had been
ill-treated, as his guests, Jacob showed his kindness. Moses also
intimates that it was by the special favor of God that, after the most
dreadful storm which threatened the holy man with destruction, a placid
serenity suddenly shone forth. To the same cause is to be assigned what
immediately follows, that Laban departed in a friendly manner: for by
this method the Lord openly manifested himself as the guardian of his
servant, seeing that he wonderfully delivered him as a lost sheep out of
the jaws of the wolf. And truly, not only was the fury of Laban
appeased; but he put on paternal affection, as if he had been changed
into a new man.

<span id="ix.i-p174"></span><span id="ix.i-p174.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p175"></span>**55.** *And blessed them*. The character of
the person is here to be noticed, because Laban, who had lapsed from
true piety, and was a man of unholy and wicked manners, yet retained the
habit of giving his blessing. For we are hereby taught, that certain
principles of divine knowledge remain in the hearts of the wicked, so
that no excuse may be left to them on the ground of ignorance; for the
custom of pronouncing a blessing arises hence, that men are certainly
persuaded that God alone is the author of all good things. For although
they may proudly arrogate what they please to themselves; yet when they
return to their right mind, they are compelled, whether they will or no,
to acknowledge that all good proceeds from God alone.
