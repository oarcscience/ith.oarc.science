<span id="v-p1"></span>CHAPTER 27.

<span id="v.i"></span>

<span id="v.i-p1"></span><span id="v.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
27:1-46](../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#001.md)<span id="v.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p2"></span>**1.** And it came to pass, that when Isaac was
old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his
eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,
*here am* I.

<span id="v.i-p3"></span>**1.** Fuit autem quum senuisset Ishac, et
caligassent oculi ejus ita ut non videret, vocavit Esau filium suum
majorem, et dixit ad eum, Fili mi. Et dixit ad eum, Ecce adsum.

<span id="v.i-p4"></span>**2.** And he said, Behold now, I am old, I
know not the day of my death:

<span id="v.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et dixit, Ecce nunc senui: non novi diem
quo moriar.

<span id="v.i-p6"></span>**3.** Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy
weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me
*some* venison;

<span id="v.i-p7"></span>**3.** Nunc igitur cape quaeso instrumenta tua,
pharetram tuam, et arcum tuum, et egredere in agrum, et venare mihi
venationem.

<span id="v.i-p8"></span>**4.** And make me savoury meat, such as I
love, and bring *it* to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee
before I die.

<span id="v.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et fac mihi cibos sapidos, quemadmodum
diligo, et affer mihi, et comedam: ut benedicat tibi anima mea antequam
moriar.

<span id="v.i-p10"></span>**5.** And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to
Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt *for* venison, *and* to
bring *it*

<span id="v.i-p11"></span>**5.** Ribca autem audiebat, dum loqueretur
Ishac ad Esau filium suum: et perrexit Esau in agrum, ut venaretur
venationem, ut afferret.

<span id="v.i-p12"></span>**6.** And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son,
saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

<span id="v.i-p13"></span>**6.** Tunc Ribca dixit ad Iahacob filium
suum, dicendo, Ecce, audivi patrem tuum loquentem ad Esau fratrem tuum,
dicendo, Ecce, audivi patrem tuum loquentem ad Esau fratrem tuum,
dicendo,

<span id="v.i-p14"></span>**7.** Bring me venison, and make me savoury
meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death.

<span id="v.i-p15"></span>**7.** Affer mihi venationem, et fac mihi
cibos, et comedam, et benedicam tibi coram Domino antequam moriar.

<span id="v.i-p16"></span>**8.** Now therefore, my son, obey my voice
according to that which I command thee.

<span id="v.i-p17"></span>**8.** Nunc igitur, fili mi, obedi voci neae
in eo quod praecipio tibi.

<span id="v.i-p18"></span>**9.** Go now to the flock, and fetch me from
thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for
thy father, such as he loveth:

<span id="v.i-p19"></span>**9.** Vade nunc ad pecudes, et cape mihi inde
duos hoedos caprarum bonos, et faciam ex eis escas sapidas patri tuo,
quemadmodum diligit.

<span id="v.i-p20"></span>**10.** And thou shalt bring *it* to thy
father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.

<span id="v.i-p21"></span>**10.** Et afferes patri tuo, et comedet, ut
benedicat tibi antequam moriatur.

<span id="v.i-p22"></span>**11.** And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother,
Behold, Esau my brother *is* a hairy man, and I *am* a smooth man:

<span id="v.i-p23"></span>**11.** Et dixit Iahacob ad Ribcam matrem
suam, Ecce Esau frater meus est vir pilosus, et ego vir laevis:

<span id="v.i-p24"></span>**12.** My father peradventure will feel me,
and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon
me, and not a blessing.

<span id="v.i-p25"></span>**12.** Si forte palpaverit me pater meus, ero
im oculis ejus tanquam illusor: et venire faciam super me maledictionem
et non benedictionem.

<span id="v.i-p26"></span>**13.** And his mother said unto him, Upon me
*be* thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me *them*

<span id="v.i-p27"></span>**13.** Tunc dixit ei mater ejus, Super me sit
maledictio tua, fili mi: veruntamen obedi voci meae et vade, cape mihi.

<span id="v.i-p28"></span>**14.** And he went, and fetched, and brought
*them* to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his
father loved.

<span id="v.i-p29"></span>**14.** Profectus est itaque, et accepit, et
attulit matri suae, et fecit mater ejus cibos sapidos, quemadmodum
diligebat pater ejus.

<span id="v.i-p30"></span>**15.** And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her
eldest son Esau, which *were* with her in the house, and put them upon
Jacob her younger son:

<span id="v.i-p31"></span>**15.** Et accepit Ribca vestes Esau filii sui
majoris delectabiles, quae erant apud se in domo, et induit Iahacob
filium suum minorem.

<span id="v.i-p32"></span>**16.** And she put the skins of the kids of
the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck:

<span id="v.i-p33"></span>**16.** Et pelles hoedorum caprarum
circumdedit manibus ejus, et laevitati colli ejus.

<span id="v.i-p34"></span>**17.** And she gave the savoury meat and the
bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

<span id="v.i-p35"></span>**17.** Deditque cibos sapidos et panem, quos
paraverat, in manu Iahacob filii sui.

<span id="v.i-p36"></span>**18.** And he came unto his father, and said,
My father: and he said, Here *am* I; who *art* thou, my son?

<span id="v.i-p37"></span>**18.** Venit ergo ad patrem suum, et dixit,
Pater mi. Ille autem respondit, Ecce adsum: qui es, fili mi?

<span id="v.i-p38"></span>**19.** And Jacob said unto his father, I *am*
Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I
pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

<span id="v.i-p39"></span>**19.** Et dixit Iahacob ad patrem suum, Ego
sum Esau primogenitus tuus, feci quemadmodum loquutus es ad me: surge
nunc, sede, et comede de venatione mea, ut benedicat mihi anima tua.

<span id="v.i-p40"></span>**20.** And Isaac said unto his son, How *is
it* that thou hast found *it* so quickly, my son? And he said, Because
the LORD thy God brought *it* to me.

<span id="v.i-p41"></span>**20.** Et dixit Ishac ad filium suum, Quid
hoc quod festinasti ad inveniendum, fili mi? Cui respondit, Quia
occurrere fecit Iehova Deus tuus coram me.

<span id="v.i-p42"></span>**21.** And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near,
I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou *be* my very son
Esau or not.

<span id="v.i-p43"></span>**21.** Tunc dixit Ishac ad Iacob, Appropinqua
nunc, et palpabo to, fili mi, utrum sis ipse filius meus Esau, an non.

<span id="v.i-p44"></span>**22.** And Jacob went near unto Isaac his
father; and he felt him, and said, The voice *is* Jacob’s voice, but the
hands *are* the hands of Esau.

<span id="v.i-p45"></span>**22.** Et appropinquavit Iahacob Ishac patri
suo: qui palpavit eum, et dixit, Vox vox Iahacob est: at manus, manus
Esau.

<span id="v.i-p46"></span>**23.** And he discerned him not, because his
hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.

<span id="v.i-p47"></span>**23.** Et non agnovit eum: quia erant manus
ejus sicut manus Esau fratris sui pilosae: et benedixit ei:

<span id="v.i-p48"></span>**24.** And he said, *Art* thou my very son
Esau? And he said, I *am*

<span id="v.i-p49"></span>**24.** Et dixit, Tu es ipse filius meus Esau?
Respondit, Sum.

<span id="v.i-p50"></span>**25.** And he said, Bring *it* near to me,
and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he
brought *it* near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and
he drank.

<span id="v.i-p51"></span>**25.** Tunc dixit, Admove mihi, et comedam de
venatione filii mei, ut benedicat tibi anima mea. Et admovit ei, et
comedit: attulitque ei vinum, et babit.

<span id="v.i-p52"></span>**26.** And his father Isaac said unto him,
Come near now, and kiss me, my son.

<span id="v.i-p53"></span>**26.** Et dixit ad eum Ishac pater ejus,
Apppropinqua nunc, et osculare me, fili mi.

<span id="v.i-p54"></span>**27.** And he came near, and kissed him: and
he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the
smell of my son *is* as the smell of a field which the LORD hath
blessed:

<span id="v.i-p55"></span>**27.** Et appropinquavit, et osculatus est
eum: et odoratus est odorem vestimentorum ejus: et benedixit ei, et
dixit, Vide, odorem filii mei sicut odorem agri, cui benedixit Iehova.

<span id="v.i-p56"></span>**28.** Therefore God give thee of the dew of
heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

<span id="v.i-p57"></span>**28.** Et det tibi Deus de rore coeli, et de
pinguedinibus terrae, et multitudinem frumenti et musti novi.

<span id="v.i-p58"></span>**29.** Let people serve thee, and nations bow
down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow
down to thee: cursed *be* every one that curseth thee, and blessed *be*
he that blesseth thee.

<span id="v.i-p59"></span>**29.** Serviant tibi populi, et incurvent se
tibi populi: esto dominus fratribus tuis, et incurvent se tibi filii
matris tuae: maledicentes tibi, maledicti erunt, et benedicentes tibi,
benedicti.

<span id="v.i-p60"></span>**30.** And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac
had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out
from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in
from his hunting.

<span id="v.i-p61"></span>**30.** Et fuit, quando complevit Ishac
benedicere Iahacob: fuit, inquam, tantum egrediendo egressus erat
Iahacob a facie Ishac patris sui, tunc Esau frater ejus venit a
venatione sua.

<span id="v.i-p62"></span>**31.** And he also had made savoury meat, and
brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father
arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.

<span id="v.i-p63"></span>**31.** Et fecit etiam ipse cibos sapidos, et
attulit patri suo: dixitque patri suo, Surgat pater meus, et comedat de
venatione filii sui, ut benedicat mihi anima tua.

<span id="v.i-p64"></span>**32.** And Isaac his father said unto him,
Who *art* thou? And he said, I *am* thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

<span id="v.i-p65"></span>**32.** Et dixit ei Ishac Pater ejus, Quis es?
Ille respondit, Ego sum filius tuus, primogenitus tuus Esau.

<span id="v.i-p66"></span>**33.** And Isaac trembled very exceedingly,
and said, Who? where *is* he that hath taken venison, and brought *it*
me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him?
yea, *and* he shall be blessed.

<span id="v.i-p67"></span>**33.** Et expavit Ishac pavore magno
vehementissime, et dixit, Quis est, et ubi est qui venatus est
venationem, et attulit mihi, et comedi ex omnibus antequam venires? et
benedixi ei, etiam benedictus erit.

<span id="v.i-p68"></span>**34.** And when Esau heard the words of his
father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto
his father, Bless me, *even* me also, O my father.

<span id="v.i-p69"></span>**34.** Quum audisset Esau verba patris sui,
clamavit clamore magno, et amaro valde valde, dixitque patri suo,
Benedic mihi: etiam ego filius tuus sum, pater mi.

<span id="v.i-p70"></span>**35.** And he said, Thy brother came with
subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.

<span id="v.i-p71"></span>**35.** Et dixit, Venit frater tuus dolose et
accepit benedictionem tuam.

<span id="v.i-p72"></span>**36.** And he said, Is not he rightly named
Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my
birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he
said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

<span id="v.i-p73"></span>**36.** Dixit ergo, Vere vocatum est nomen
ejus Iahacob, quia supplantavit me jam duabus vicibus: primogenituram
meam accepit, et ecce nunc accepit benedictionem mean. Et dixit, Annon
reservasti mihi apud to benedictionem?

<span id="v.i-p74"></span>**37.** And Isaac answered and said unto Esau,
Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to
him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what
shall I do now unto thee, my son?

<span id="v.i-p75"></span>**37.** Et respondit Ishac, et dixit ad Esau,
Ecce, dominum posui eum tibi, et omnes fratres ejus dedi ei in servos,
frumentumque et vinum addixi ei: et tibi nunc quid faciam, fili mi?

<span id="v.i-p76"></span>**38.** And Esau said unto his father, Hast
thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, *even* me also, O my father.
And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.

<span id="v.i-p77"></span>**38.** Tunc dixit Esau ad patrem suum,
Numquid benedictio una est tibi, pater mi? benedic mihi, et etiam ego
filius tuus, pater mi: et elevavit Esau vocem suam et flevit.

<span id="v.i-p78"></span>**39.** And Isaac his father answered and said
unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of
the dew of heaven from above;

<span id="v.i-p79"></span>**39.** Tunc respondit Ishac pater ejus, et
dixit ad eum, Ecce, de pinguedinibus terrae erit habitatio tua et de
rore coeli desuper.

<span id="v.i-p80"></span>**40.** And by thy sword shalt thou live, and
shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have
the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

<span id="v.i-p81"></span>**40.** Et in gladio tuo vives, et fratri tuo
servies: et erit, quando dominaberis, franges jugum ejus a collo tuo.

<span id="v.i-p82"></span>**41.** And Esau hated Jacob because of the
blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart,
The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my
brother Jacob.

<span id="v.i-p83"></span>**41.** Itaque odio habuit Esau Iahacob
propter benedictionem, qua benedixerat ei pater ejus: et cogitavit Esau
in corde suo, Appropinquabunt dies luctus patris mei, et occidam Iahacob
fratrem meum.

<span id="v.i-p84"></span>**42.** And these words of Esau her elder son
were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and
said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort
himself, *purposing* to kill thee.

<span id="v.i-p85"></span>**42.** Et nuntiata sunt Ribcae verba Esau
filii sui majoris: et misit, et vocavit Iahacob filium suum minorem, et
dixit ad eum, Ecce, Esau frater tuus consolatur se super to, ut occidat
to.

<span id="v.i-p86"></span>**43.** Now therefore, my son, obey my voice;
and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;

<span id="v.i-p87"></span>**43.** Et nunc fili mi, obedi voci meae, et
surge, et fuge ad Laban fratrem meum in Charan.

<span id="v.i-p88"></span>**44.** And tarry with him a few days, until
thy brother’s fury turn away;

<span id="v.i-p89"></span>**44.** Et habita cum eo dies aliquot, donec
avertatur furor fratris tui a to.

<span id="v.i-p90"></span>**45.** Until thy brother’s anger turn away
from thee, and he forget *that* which thou hast done to him: then I will
send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you
both in one day?

<span id="v.i-p91"></span>**45.** Donec avertatur ira fratris tui a to,
et obliviscatur eorum quae fecisti ei: et mittam, et accipiam to inde:
utquid orbabor etiam ambobus vobis die una?

<span id="v.i-p92"></span>**46.** And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary
of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the
daughters of Heth, such as these *which are* of the daughters of the
land, what good shall my life do me?

<span id="v.i-p93"></span>**46.** Et dixit Ribca ad Ishac, Angustiis
affecta sum in vita mea propter filias Heth: si acceperit Iahacob uxorem
de filiabus Heth, sicut istas de filiabus terrae, utquid est mihi vita?

<span id="v.i-p94"></span> 

<span id="v.i-p95"></span><span id="v.i-p95.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p96"></span>**1.** *And it came to pass that when Isaac
was old*. In this chapter Moses prosecutes, in many words, a history
which does not appear to be of great utility. It amounts to this; Esau
having gone out, at his father’s command, to hunt; Jacob, in his
brother’s clothing, was, by the artifice of his mother, induced to
obtain by stealth the blessing due by the right of nature to the
firstborn. It seems even like child’s play to present to his father a
kid instead of venison, to feign himself to be hairy by putting on
skins, and, under the name of his brother, to get the blessing by a lie.
But in order to learn that Moses does not in vain pause over this
narrative as a most serious matter, we must first observe, that when
Jacob received the blessing from his father, this token confirmed to him
the oracle by which the Lord had preferred him to his brother. For the
benediction here spoken of was not a mere prayer but a legitimate
sanction, divinely interposed, to make manifest the grace of election.
God had promised to the holy fathers that he would be a God to their
seed for ever. They, when at the point of death, in order that the
succession might be secured to their posterity, put them in possession,
as if they would deliver, from hand to hand, the favor which they had
received from God. So Abraham, in blessing his son Isaac, constituted
him the heir of spiritual life with a solemn rite. With the same design,
Isaac now, being worn down with age, imagines himself to be shortly
about to depart this life, and wishes to bless his firstborn son, in
order that the everlasting covenant of God may remain in his own family.
The Patriarchs did not take this upon themselves rashly, or on their own
private account, but were public and divinely ordained witnesses. To
this point belongs the declaration of the Apostle, “the less is blessed
of the better.” (<span id="v.i-p96.1"></span>[Heb
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#007)<span id="v.i-p96.1"></span>..md) For
even the faithful were accustomed to bless each other by mutual offices
of charity; but the Lord enjoined this peculiar service upon the
patriarchs, that they should transmit, as a deposit to posterity, the
covenant which he had struck with them, and which they kept during the
whole course of their life. The same command was afterwards given to the
priests, as appears in <span id="v.i-p96.2"></span>[Nu
6:24](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#024.md)<span id="v.i-p96.2"></span>, and
other similar places. Therefore Isaac, in blessing his son, sustained
another character than that of a father or of a private person, for he
was a prophet and an interpreter of God, who constituted his son an heir
of the same grace which he had received. Hence appears what I have
already said, that Moses, in treating of this matter, is not without
reason thus prolix. But let us weigh each of the circumstances of the
case in its proper order; of which this is the first, that God
transferred the blessing of Esau to Jacob, by a mistake on the part of
the father; whose eyes, Moses tells us, were dim. The vision also of
Jacob was dull when he blessed his grandchildren Ephraim and Manasseh;
yet his want of sight did not prevent him from cautiously placing his
hands in a transverse direction. But God suffered Isaac to be deceived,
in order to show that it was not by the will of man that Jacob was
raised, contrary to the course of nature, to the right and honor of
primogeniture.

<span id="v.i-p97"></span><span id="v.i-p97.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p98"></span>**2.** *Behold, now I am old, I know not the
day of my death*. There is not the least doubt that Isaac implored daily
blessings on his sons all his life: this, therefore, appears to have
been an extraordinary kind of benediction. Moreover, the declaration
that he knew not the day of his death, is as much as if he had said,
that death was every moment pressing so closely upon him, a decrepit and
failing man, that he dared not promise himself any longer life. Just as
a woman with child when the time of parturition draws near, might say,
that she had now no day certain. Every one, even in the full vigor of
age, carries with him a thousand deaths. Death claims as its own the
foetus in the mother’s womb, and accompanies it through every stage of
life. But as it urges the old more closely, so they ought to place it
more constantly before their eyes, and should pass as pilgrims through
the world, or as those who have already one foot in the grave. In short,
Isaac, as one near death, wishes to leave the Church surviving him in
the person of his son.

<span id="v.i-p99"></span><span id="v.i-p99.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p100"></span>**4.** *That my soul may bless thee*.
Wonderfully was the faith of the holy man blended with a foolish and
inconsiderate carnal affection. The general principle of faith
flourishes in his mind, when, in blessing his son, he consigns to him,
under the direction of the Holy Spirit, the right of the inheritance
which had been divinely promised to himself. Meanwhile, he is blindly
carried away by the love of his firstborn son, to prefer him to the
other; and in this way he contends against the oracle of God. For he
could not be ignorant of that which God had pronounced before the
children were born. If any one would excuse him, inasmuch as he had
received no command from God to change the accustomed order of nature by
preferring the younger to the elder; this is easily refuted: because
when he knew that the firstborn was rejected, he still persisted in his
excessive attachment. Again, in neglecting to inquire respecting his
duty, when he had been informed of the heavenly oracle by his wife, his
indolence was by no means excusable. For he was not altogether ignorant
of his calling; therefore, his obstinate attachment to his son was a
kind of blindness, which proved a greater obstacle to him than the
external dimness of his eyes. Yet this fault, although deserving of
reprehension, did not deprive the holy man of the right of pronouncing a
blessing; but plenary authority remained with him, and the force and
efficacy of his testimony stood entire, just as if God himself had
spoken from heaven; to which subject I shall soon again allude.

<span id="v.i-p101"></span><span id="v.i-p101.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p102"></span>**5.** *And Rebekah heard*. Moses now
explains more fully the artifice by which Jacob attained the blessing.
It truly appears ridiculous, that an old man, deceived by the cunning of
his wife, should, through ignorance and error, have given utterance to
what was contrary to his wish. And surely the stratagem of Rebekah was
not without fault; for although she could not guide her husband by
salutary counsel, yet it was not a legitimate method of acting, to
circumvent him by such deceit. For, as a lie is in itself culpable, she
sinned more grievously still in this, that she desired to sport in a
sacred matter with such wiles. She knew that the decree by which Jacob
had been elected and adopted was immutable; why then does she not
patiently wait till God shall confirm it in fact, and shall show that
what he had once pronounced from heaven is certain? Therefore, she
darkens the celestial oracle by her lie, and abolishes, as far as she
was able, the grace promised to her son. Now, if we consider farther,
whence arose this great desire to bestir herself; her extraordinary
faith will on the other hand appear. For, as she did not hesitate to
provoke her husband against herself, to light up implacable enmity
between the brothers, to expose her beloved son Jacob to the danger of
immediate death, and to disturb the whole family; this certainly flowed
from no other source than her faith.  <span
id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) The inheritance promised by God was
firmly fixed in her mind; she knew that it was decreed to her son Jacob.
And therefore, relying upon the covenant of God, and keeping in mind the
oracle received, she forgets the world. Thus, we see, that her faith was
mixed with an unjust and immoderate zeal. This is to be carefully
observed, in order that we may understand that a pure and distinct
knowledge does not always so illuminate the minds of the pious as to
cause them to be governed, in all their actions, by the Holy Spirit, but
that the little light which shows them their path is enveloped in
various clouds of ignorance and error; so that while they hold a right
course, and are tending towards the goal, they yet occasionally slide.
Finally, both in Isaac and in his wife the principle of faith was
preeminent. But each, by ignorance in certain particulars, and by other
faults, either diverged a little from the way, or, at least, stumbled in
the way. But seeing that, nevertheless, the election of God stood firm;
nay, that he even executed his design through the deceit of a woman, he
vindicates, in this manner, the whole praise of his benediction to his
own gratuitous goodness.

<span id="v.i-p105"></span>**11.** *And Jacob said to Rebekah*. That
Jacob does not voluntarily present himself to his father, but rather
fears lest, his imposture being detected, he should bring a curse upon
himself, is very contrary to faith.  <span
id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) For when the Apostle teaches, that
“whatsoever is not of faith is sin,” (<span id="v.i-p106.1"></span>[Ro
14:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#023)<span id="v.i-p106.1"></span>,.md)
he trains the sons of God to this sobriety, that they may not permit
themselves to undertake anything with a doubtful and perplexed
conscience. This firm persuasion is the only rule of right conduct, when
we, relying on the command of God, go intrepidly wheresoever he calls
us. Jacob, therefore, by debating with himself, shows that he was
deficient in faith; and certainly, although he was not entirely without
it, yet, in this point, he is convicted of failure. But by this example
we are again taught, that faith is not always extinguished by a given
fault; yet, if God sometimes bears with his servants thus far, that he
turns, what they have done perversely, to their salvation, we must not
hence take a license to sin. It happened by the wonderful mercy of God,
that Jacob was not cut off from the grace of adoption. Who would not
rather fear than become presumptuous? And whereas we see that his faith
was obscured by doubting, let us learn to ask of the Lord the spirit of
prudence to govern all our steps. There was added another error of no
light kind: for why does he not rather reverence God than dread his
father’s anger? Why does it not rather occur to his mind, that a foul
blot would stain the hallowed adoption of God, when it seemed to owe its
accomplishment to a lie? For although it tended to a right end, it was
not lawful to attain that end, through this oblique course. Meanwhile,
there is no doubt that faith prevailed over these impediments. For what
was the cause why he preferred the bare and apparently empty benediction
of his father,  <span id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) to the quiet which
he then enjoyed, to the conveniences of home, and finally to life
itself? According to the flesh, the father’s benediction, of which he
was so desirous, that he knowingly and willingly plunged himself into
great difficulties, was but an imaginary thing. Why did he act thus, but
because in the exercise of simple faith in the word of God, he more
highly valued the hope which was hidden from him, shall the desirable
condition which he actually enjoyed? Besides, his fear of his father’s
anger had its origin in the true fear of God. He says that he feared
lest he should bring upon himself a curse. But he would not so greatly
have dreaded a verbal censure, if he had not deemed the grace deposited
in the hands of his father worth more than a thousand lives. It was
therefore under an impulse of God that he feared his father, who was
really God’s minister. For when the Lord sees us creeping on the earth,
he draws us to himself by the hand of man.  <span

<span id="v.i-p110"></span>**13.** *Upon me be thy curse, my son*. Here
Rebekah sins again, because she burns with such hasty zeal that she does
not consider how highly God disapproves of her evil course. She
presumptuously subjects herself to the curse. But whence this unheeding
confidence? Being unfurnished with any divine command, she took her own
counsel. Yet no one will deny that this zeal, although preposterous,
proceeds from special reverence for the word of God. For since she was
informed by the oracle of God, that Jacob was preferred in the sight of
God, she disregarded whatever was visible in the world, and whatever the
sense of nature dictated, in comparison with God’s secret election.
Therefore we are taught by this example, that every one should walk
modestly and cautiously according to the rule of his vocation; and
should not dare to proceed beyond what the Lord allows in his word.

<span id="v.i-p111"></span><span id="v.i-p111.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p112"></span>**14.** *And he went and fetched*. Although
it is probable that Jacob was not only influenced by a desire to yield
obedience to the authority of his mother, but was also persuaded by her
seasonings, he yet sinned by overstepping the bounds of his vocation.
When Rebekah had taken the blame upon herself, she told him, doubtless,
that injury was done to no one: because Jacob was not stealing away
another’s right, but only seeking the blessing which was decreed to him
by the celestial oracle. It seemed a fair and probable excuse for the
fraud, that Isaac, unless he should be imposed upon, was prepared to
invalidate the election of God. Therefore Jacob, instead of simply
declining from what was right in submission to his mother, was rather
obeying the word of God. In the meantime (as I have said) this
particular error was not free from blame: because the truth of God was
not to be aided by such falsehoods. The paternal benediction was a seal
of God’s grace, I confess it; but she ought rather to have waited till
God should bring relief from heaven, by changing the mind and guiding
the tongue of Isaac, than have attempted what was unlawful. For if
Balaam, who prostituted his venal tongue, was constrained by the Spirit,
contrary to his own wish, to bless the elect people, whom he would
rather have devoted to destruction, (<span id="v.i-p112.1"></span>[Nu
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#012)<span id="v.i-p112.1"></span>,.md)
how much more powerfully would the same spirit have influenced the
tongue of holy Isaac, who was not a mercenary man, but one who desired
faithfully to obey God, and was only hurried by an error in a contrary
direction? Therefore, although in the main, faith shone preeminently in
holy Jacob, yet in this respect he bears the blame of rashness, in that
he was distrustful of the providence of God, and fraudulently gained
possession of his father’s blessing.

<span id="v.i-p113"></span><span id="v.i-p113.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p114"></span>**19.** *And Jacob said unto his father, I am
Esau*  <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md) At first Jacob was timid and
anxious; now, having dismissed his fear, he confidently and audaciously
lies. By which example we are taught, that when any one has transgressed
the proper bounds of duty, he soon allows himself unmeasured license.
Wherefore there is nothing better than for each to keep himself within
the limits divinely prescribed to him, lest by attempting more than is
lawful, he should open the door to Satan. I have before shown how far
his seeking the blessing by fraud, and insinuating himself into the
possession of it by falsehood, was contrary to faith. Yet this
particular fault and divergence from the right path, did not prevent the
faith which had been produced by the oracle from holding on, in some
way, its course. In excusing the quickness of his return by saying that
the venison was brought to him by God, he speaks in accordance with the
rule of piety: he sins, however, in mixing the sacred name of God with
his own falsehoods. Thus, when there is a departure from truth, the
reverence which is apparently shown to God is nothing else than a
profanation of his glory. It was right that the prosperous issue of his
hunting should be ascribed to the providence of God, lest we should
imagine that any good thing was the result of chance; but when Jacob
pretended that God was the author of a benefit which had not been
granted to himself, and that, too, as a cloak for his deception, his
fault was not free from perjury.

<span id="v.i-p116"></span><span id="v.i-p116.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p117"></span>**21.** *Come near, I pray thee, that I may
feel thee*. It hence appears that the holy man was suspicious of fraud,
and therefore hesitated. Whence it may seem that the benediction was
vain, seeing it had no support of faith. But it thus pleased God so to
perform his work by the hand of Isaac, as not to make him, who was the
instrument, a willing furtherer of his design. Nor is it absurd that
Isaac, like a blind man, should ignorantly transfer the blessing to a
different person from him whom he intended. The ordinary function of
pastors has something of a similar kind; for since by the command of
God, they reconcile men to him, yet they do not discern to whom this
reconciliation comes; thus they cast abroad the seed, but are uncertain
respecting the fruit. Wherefore God does not place the office and power
with which he has invested them, under the control of their own
judgment. In this way the ignorance of Isaac does not nullify the
heavenly oracles; and God himself, although the senses of his servant
fail, does not desist from the accomplishment of his purpose. Here we
have a clear refutation of the figment of the Papists, that the whole
force of the sacrament depends upon the intention of the man who
consecrates; as if, truly, it were left to the will of man to frustrate
the design of God. Nevertheless, what I have already so often said must
be remembered, that however Isaac might be deceived in the person of his
son, he yet did not pronounce the blessing in vain: because a general
faith remained in his mind and in part governed his conduct. In forming
his judgment from the touch, disregarding the voice, he did not act
according to the nature of faith. And, therefore, with respect to the
person, he was plainly in error. This, however, did not happen in
consequence of negligence; since he diligently and even anxiously turned
every way, that he might not deprive the firstborn of his right. But it
pleased the Lord thus to render his senses dull, partly for the purpose
of showing, how vain it is for men to strive to change what he has once
decreed, (because it is impossible hut that his counsel should remain
firm and stable though the whole world should oppose it,) and partly,
for the purpose of correcting, by this kind of chastisement, the absurd
attachment by which Isaac was too closely bound to his firstborn. For
whence arose this minute investigation, except from the fact that an
inordinate love of Esau, which had taken entire possession of his mind,
turned him aside from the divine oracle? Therefore, since he yielded an
excessive indulgence to natural feeling, he deserved in every way to be
blinded. So much the greater care ought we to take that, in carrying on
God’s work, we should not give the reins to our human affections.

<span id="v.i-p118"></span><span id="v.i-p118.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p119"></span>**26.** *Come near now, and kiss me*. We know
that the practice of kissing was then in use, which many nations retain
to this day. Profane men, however, may say, that it is ludicrous for an
old man, whose mind was already obtuse, and who moreover had eaten and
drunk heartily, should pour forth his benedictions upon a person who was
only acting a part.  <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md) But whereas
Moses has previously recorded the oracle of God, by which the adoption
was destined for the younger son, it behoves us reverently to
contemplate the secret providence of God, towards which profane men pay
no respect. Truly Isaac was not so in bondage to the attractions of meat
and drink as to be unable, with sobriety of mind, to reflect upon the
divine command given unto him, and to undertake in seriousness, and with
a certain faith in his own vocation, the very work in which, on account
of the infirmity of his flesh, he vacillated and halted. Therefore, we
must not form our estimate of this blessing from the external
appearance, but from the celestial decree; even as it appeared at
length, by the issue, that God neither vainly sported, nor that man
rashly proceeded in this affair: and, truly, if the same religion dwells
in us which flourished in the patriarch’s heart, nothing will hinder the
divine power from shining forth the more clearly in the weakness of man.

<span id="v.i-p121"></span><span id="v.i-p121.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p122"></span>**27.** *See, the smell of my son is as the
smell of a field*. The allegory of Ambrose on this passage is not
displeasing to me. Jacob, the younger brother, is blessed under the
person of the elder; the garments which were borrowed from his brother
breathe an odour grateful and pleasant to his father. In the same manner
we are blessed, as Ambrose teaches, when, in the name of Christ, we
enter the presence of our Heavenly Father: we receive from him the robe
of righteousness, which, by its odour, procures his favor; in short, we
are thus blessed when we are put in his place. But Isaac seems here to
desire and implore nothing for his son but what is earthly; for this is
the substance of his words, that it might be well with his son in the
world, that he might gather together the abundant produce of the earth,
that he might enjoy great peace, and shine in honor above others. There
is no mention of the heavenly kingdom; and hence it has arisen, that men
without learning, and but little exercised in true piety, have imagined
that these holy fathers were blessed by the Lord only in respect to this
frail and transitory life. But it appears from many passages to have
been far otherwise: and as to the fact that Isaac here confines himself
to the earthly favors of God, the explanation is easy; for the Lord did
not formerly set the hope of the future inheritance plainly before the
eyes of the fathers, (as he now calls and raises us directly towards
heaven,) but he led them as by a circuitous course. Thus he appointed
the land of Canaan as a mirror and pledge to them of the celestial
inheritance. In all his acts of kindness he gave them tokens of his
paternal favor, not indeed for the purpose of making them content with
present good, so that they should neglect heaven, or should follow a
merely empty shadow, as some foolishly suppose; but that, being aided by
such helps, according to the time in which they lived, they might by
degrees rise towards heaven; for since Christ, the first-fruits of those
who rise again, and the author of the eternal and incorruptible life,
had not yet been manifested, his spiritual kingdom was, in this way,
shadowed forth under figures only, until the fullness of the time should
come; and as all the promises of God were involved, and in a sense
clothed in these symbols, so the faith of the holy fathers observed the
same measure, and made its advances heavenwards by means of these
earthly rudiments. Therefore, although Isaac makes the temporal favors
of God prominent, nothing is further from his mind than to confine the
hope of his son to this world; he would raise him to the same elevation
to which he himself aspired. Some proof of this may be drawn from his
own words; for this is the principal point, that he assigns him the
dominion over the nations. But whence the hope of such a dignity, unless
he had been persuaded that his race had been elected by the Lord, and,
indeed, with this stipulation, that the right of the kingdom should
remain with one son only? Meanwhile, let it suffice to adhere to this
principle, that the holy man, when he implores a prosperous course of
life for his son, wishes that God, in whose paternal favor stands our
solid and eternal happiness, may be propitious to him.

<span id="v.i-p123"></span><span id="v.i-p123.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p124"></span>**29.** *Cursed be every one that curseth
thee*. What I have before said must be remembered, namely, that these
are not bare wishes, such as fathers are wont to utter on behalf of
their children, but that promises of God are included in them; for Isaac
is the authorized interpreter of God, and the instrument employed by the
Holy Spirit; and therefore, as in the person of God, he efficaciously
pronounces those accursed who shall oppose the welfare of his son. This
then is the confirmation of the promise, by which God, when he receives
the faithful under his protection, declares that he will be an enemy to
their enemies. The whole force of the benediction turns to this point,
that God will prove himself to be a kind father to his servant Jacob in
all things, so that he will constitute him the chief and the head of a
holy and elect people, will preserve and defend him by his power, and
will secure his salvation in the face of enemies of every kind.

<span id="v.i-p125"></span><span id="v.i-p125.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p126"></span>**30.** *Jacob was yet scarce gone out*. Here
is added the manner in which Esau was repulsed, which circumstance
availed not a little to confirm the benediction to Jacob: for if Esau
had not been rejected, it might seem that he was not deprived of that
honor which nature had given him: but now Isaac declares, that what he
had done, in virtue of his patriarchal office, could not but be
ratified. Here, truly, it again appears, that the primogeniture which
Jacob obtained, at the expense of his brother, was made his by a free
gift; for if we compare the works of both together, Esau obeys his
father, brings him the produce of his hunting, prepares for his father
the food obtained by his own labor, and speaks nothing but the truth: in
short, we find nothing in him which is not worthy of praise. Jacob never
leaves his home, substitutes a kid for venison, insinuates himself by
many lies, brings nothing which would properly commend him, but in many
things deserves reprehension. Hence it must be acknowledged, that the
cause of this event is not to be traced to works, but that it lies hid
in the eternal counsel of God. Yet Esau is not unjustly reprobated,
because they who are not governed by the Spirit of God can receive
nothing with a right mind; only let it be firmly maintained, that since
the condition of all is equal, if any one is preferred to another, it is
not because of his own merit, but because the Lord has gratuitously
elected him.

<span id="v.i-p127"></span><span id="v.i-p127.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p128"></span>**33.** *And Isaac trembled very exceedingly*
 <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) Here now again the faith which had
been smothered in the breast of the holy man shines forth and emits
fresh sparks; for there is no doubt that his fear springs from faith.
Besides, it is no common fear which Moses describes, but that which
utterly confounds the holy man: for, whereas he was perfectly conscious
of his own vocation, and therefore was persuaded that the duty of naming
the heir with whom he should deposit the covenant of eternal life was
divinely enjoined upon him, he no sooner discovered his error than he
was filled with fear, that in an affair so great and so serious God had
suffered him to err; for unless he had thought that God was the director
of this act, what should have hindered him from alleging his ignorance
as an excuse, and from becoming enraged against Jacob, who had stolen in
upon him by fraud and by unjustifiable arts? But although covered with
shame on account of the error he had committed, he nevertheless, with a
collected mind, ratifies the benediction which he had pronounced; and I
do not doubt that he then, as one awaking, began to recall to memory the
oracle to which he had not been sufficiently attentive. Wherefore, the
holy man was not impelled by ambition to be thus tenacious of his
purpose, as obstinate men are wont to be, who prosecute to the last what
they have once, though foolishly, begun; but the declaration, I have
blessed him, yea, and he shall be blessed, was the effect of a rare and
precious faith; for he, renouncing the affections of the flesh, now
yields himself entirely to God, and, acknowledging God as the Author of
the benediction which he had uttered, ascribes due glory to him in not
daring to retract it. The benefit of this doctrine pertains to the whole
Church, in order that we may certainly know, that whatever the heralds
of the gospel promise to us by the command of God, will be efficacious
and stable, because they do not speak as private men, but as by the
command of God himself; and the infirmity of the minister does not
destroy the faithfulness, power, and efficacy of God’s word. He who
presents himself to us charged with the offer of eternal happiness and
life, is subject to our common miseries and to death; yet,
notwithstanding, the promise is efficacious. He who absolves us from
sins is himself a sinner; but because his office is divinely assigned
him, the stability of this grace, having its foundation in God, shall
never fail.

<span id="v.i-p130"></span><span id="v.i-p130.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p131"></span>**34.** *He cried with a great and exceeding
bitter cry*. Though Esau persists in imploring the blessing, he yet
gives a sign of desperation, which is the reason why he obtains no
benefit, because he enters not by the gate of faith. True piety, indeed,
draws forth tears and great cries from the children of God; but Esau,
trembling and full of fears, breaks out in wailings; afterwards he
casts, at a venture, his wish into the air, that he also may receive a
blessing. But his blind incredulity is reproved by his own words; for
whereas one blessing only had been deposited with his father, he asks
that another should be given to him, as if it were in his father’s power
indiscriminately to breathe out blessings, independently of the command
of God. Here the admonition of the Apostle may suggest itself to our
minds,

<span id="v.i-p132"></span>“that Esau, when he sought again the
forfeited blessing with tears and loud lamentations,  
found no place for repentance,”  
(<span id="v.i-p132.3"></span>[Heb
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#017)<span id="v.i-p132.3"></span>;.md)

<span id="v.i-p133"></span>for they who neglect to follow God when he
calls on them, afterwards call upon him in vain, when he has turned his
back. So long as God addresses and invites us, the gate of the kingdom
of heaven is in a certain sense open: this opportunity we must use, if
we desire to enter, according to the instruction of the Prophet,

<span id="v.i-p134"></span>“Seek ye the Lord while he may be found;  
call ye upon him while he is near.” (<span id="v.i-p134.2"></span>[Isa
55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006)<span id="v.i-p134.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.i-p135"></span>Of which passage Paul is the interpreter, in
defining that to be the acceptable time of the day of salvation in which
grace is brought unto us by the gospel. (<span
id="v.i-p135.1"></span>[2Co 6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002.md)<span
id="v.i-p135.1"></span>.) They who suffer that time to pass by, may, at
length, knock too late, and without profit, because God avenges himself
of their idleness. We must therefore fear lest if, with deafened ears,
we suffer the voice of God now to pass unheeded by, he should, in turn,
become deaf to our cry. But it may be asked, how is this repulse
consistent with the promise,

<span id="v.i-p136"></span>“If the wicked will turn from all his sins
that he has committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is
lawful and right, he shall surely live?” (<span
id="v.i-p136.1"></span>[Eze 18:21](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#021.md)<span
id="v.i-p136.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.i-p137"></span>Moreover, it may seem at variance with the
clemency of God to reject the sighings of those who, being crushed by
misery, fly for refuge to his mercy. I answer, that repentance, if it be
true and sincere, will never be too late; and the sinner who, from his
soul, is displeased with himself, will obtain pardon: but God in this
manner punishes the contempt of his grace, because they who obstinately
reject it, do not seriously purpose in their mind to return to him. Thus
it is that they who are given up to a reprobate mind are never touched
with genuine penitence. Hypocrites truly break out into tears, like
Esau, but their heart within them will remain closed as with iron bars.
Therefore, since Esau rushes forward, destitute of faith and repentance,
to ask a blessing, there is no wonder that he should be rejected.

<span id="v.i-p138"></span><span id="v.i-p138.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p139"></span>**36.** *Is he not rightly named Jacob?* That
the mind of Esau was affected with no sense of penitence appears hence;
he accused his brother and took no blame to himself. But the very
beginning of repentance is grief felt on account of sin, together with
self-condemnation. Esau ought to have descended into himself, and to
have become his own judge. Having sold his birthright, he had darted,
like a famished dog, upon the meat and the pottage; and now, as if he
had done no wrong, he vents all his anger on his brother. Further, if
the blessing is deemed of any value, why does he not consider that he
had been repelled from it, not simply by the fraud of man, but by the
providence of God? We see, therefore, that like a blind man feeling in
the dark, he cannot find his way.

<span id="v.i-p140"></span><span id="v.i-p140.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p141"></span>**37.** *Behold, I have made him thy Lord*.
Isaac now more openly confirms what I have before said, that since God
was the author of the blessing, it could neither be vain nor evanescent.
For he does not here magnificently boast of his dignity, but keeps
himself within the bounds and measure of a servant, and denies that he
is at liberty to alter anything. For he always considers, (which is the
truth,) that when he sustains the character of God’s representative, it
is not lawful for him to proceed further than the command will bear him.
Hence, indeed, Esau ought to have learned from whence he had fallen by
his own fault, in order that he might have humbled himself, and might
rather have joined himself with his brother, in order to become a
partaker of his blessing, as his inferior, than have desired anything
separately for himself. But a depraved cupidity carries him away, so
that he, forgetful of the kingdom of God, pursues and cares for nothing
except his own private advantage. Again, we must notice Isaac’s manner
of speaking, by which he claims a certain force and efficacy for his
benediction, as if his word carried with it dominion, abundance of corn
and wine, and whatever else God had promised to Abraham. For God, in
requiring the faithful to depend on himself alone, would nevertheless
have them to rest securely upon the word, which, at his command, is
declared to them by the tongue of men. In this way *they* are said to
remit sins, who are only the messengers and interpreters of free
forgiveness.

<span id="v.i-p142"></span><span id="v.i-p142.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p143"></span>**38.** *Hast thou but one blessing*? Esau
seems to take courage; but he neglects the care of his soul, and turns,
like a swine, to the pampering of his flesh. He had heard that his
father had nothing left to grant; because, truly, the full and entire
grace of God so rested upon Jacob, that out of his family there was no
happiness. Wherefore, if Esau sought his own welfare, he ought to have
drawn from that fountain, and rather to have subjected himself to his
brother, than to have cut himself off from a happy connection with him.
He chose, however, rather to be deprived of spiritual grace, provided he
might but possess something of his own, and apart from his brother, than
to be his inferior at home. He could not be ignorant, that there was one
sole benediction by which his brother Jacob had been constituted the
heir of the divine covenant: for Isaac would be daily discoursing with
them concerning the singular privilege which God had vouchsafed to
Abraham and his seed. Esau would not previously have complained so
bitterly, unless he had felt that he had been deprived of an
incomparable benefit. Therefore, by departing from this one source of
blessing, he indirectly renounces God, and cuts himself off from the
body of the Church, caring for nothing but this transitory life. But it
would have been better for him, miserably to perish through the want of
all things in this world, and with difficulty to draw his languishing
breath, than to slumber amidst temporal delights. What afterwards
follows, — namely, that he wept with loud lamentations, — is a sign of
fierce and proud indignation, rather than of penitence; for he remitted
nothing of his ferocity, but raged like a cruel beast of prey. So the
wicked, when punishment overtakes them, bewail the salvation they have
lost; but, meanwhile, do not cease to delight themselves in their vices;
and instead of heartily seeking after the righteousness of God, they
rather desire that his deity should be extinct. Of a similar character
is that gnashing of teeth and weeping in hell which, instead of
stimulating the reprobate to seek after God, only consumes them with
unknown torments

<span id="v.i-p144"></span><span id="v.i-p144.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p145"></span>**39.** *Behold, thy dwelling shall be the
fatness of the earth*. At length Esau obtains what he had asked. For,
perceiving himself to be cast down from the rank and honor of
primogeniture, he chooses rather to have prosperity in the world,
separated from the holy people, than to submit to the yoke of his
younger brother. But it may be thought that Isaac contradicts himself,
in offering a new benediction, when he had before declared, that he had
given to his son Jacob all that was placed at his disposal. I answer,
that what has been before said concerning Ishmael must be noted in this
place. For God, though he hearkened to Abraham’s prayer for Ishmael, so
far as concerned the present life, yet immediately restricts his
promise, by adding the exception implied in the declaration, that in
Isaac only should the seed be called. I do not, however, doubt, that the
holy man, when he perceived that his younger son Jacob was the divinely
ordained heir of a happy life, would endeavor to retain his firstborn,
Esau, in the bond of fraternal connection, in order that he might not
depart from the holy and elect flock of the Church. But now, when he
sees him obstinately tending in another direction, he declares what will
be his future condition. Meanwhile the spiritual blessing remains in its
integrity with Jacob alone, to whom Esau refusing to attach himself,
voluntarily becomes an exile from the kingdom of God. The prophecy
uttered by Malachi, (<span id="v.i-p145.1"></span>[Mal
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003)<span id="v.i-p145.1"></span>,.md) may
seem to be contradictory to this statement. For, comparing the two
brothers, Esau and Jacob, with each other, he teaches that Esau was
hated, inasmuch as a possession was given to him in the deserts; and yet
Isaac promises him a fertile land. There is a twofold solution: either
that the Prophet, speaking comparatively, may with truth call Idumea a
desert in comparison with the land of Canaan, which was far more
fruitful; or else that he was referring to his own times. For although
the devastations of both lands had been terrible, yet the land of Canaan
in a short time flourished again, while the territory of Edom was
condemned to perpetual sterility, and given up to dragons. Therefore,
although God, with respect to his own people, banished Esau to desert
mountains, he yet gave to him a land sufficiently fertile in itself to
render the promise by no means nugatory. For that mountainous region
both had its own natural fruitfulness, and was so watered by the dew of
heaven, that it would yield sustenance to its inhabitants.

<span id="v.i-p146"></span><span id="v.i-p146.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p147"></span>**40.** *By thy sword shalt thou live, and
shalt serve thy brother*. It is to be observed that events are here
predicted which were never fulfilled in the person of Esau; and
therefore, that the prophecy is concerning things at that time far
distant. For Jacob was so far from having obtained dominion over his
brother, that on his return from Padan-aram, he suppliantly tendered him
his obedience; and the breaking off of the yoke which Isaac here
mentions, is referred to a very remote period. He is therefore relating
the future condition of Esau’s posterity. And he says first, that they
shall live by their sword: which words admit a twofold sense, either
that, being surrounded by enemies, they shall pass a warlike and unquiet
life; or that they shall be free, and their own masters. For there is no
power to use the sword where there is no liberty. The former meaning
seems the more suitable; namely, that God would limit his promise, lest
Esau should be too much exalted: for nothing is more desirable than
peace. The holy people also are warned that there will always be some
enemies to infest them. This, however, is a very different thing from
living by his own sword; which is as if he had said, that the sons of
Esau, like robbers, should maintain their security by arms and violence,
rather than by legitimate authority. A second limitation of the promise
is, that though armed with the sword, he should still not escape
subjection to his brother. For the Idumeans were, at length, made
tributary to the chosen people;  <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md)
but the servitude was not long continued; because when the kingdoms were
divided, the power by which they had held all their neighbors in
subjection and fear, was cut off; yet the Lord would have the Idumeans
brought into subjection for a short time, that he might furnish a
visible demonstration of this prophecy. As to the rest of the time, the
restless and unbridled liberty of Esau was more wretched than any state
of subjection.

<span id="v.i-p149"></span><span id="v.i-p149.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p150"></span>**41.** *And Esau hated Jacob*. It hence
appears more clearly, that the tears of Esau were so far from being the
effect of true repentance, that they were rather evidences of furious
anger. For he is not content with secretly cherishing enmity against his
brother, but openly breaks out in wicked threats. And it is evident how
deeply malice had struck its roots, when he could indulge himself in the
desperate purpose of murdering his brother. Even a profane and
sacrilegious contumacy betrays itself in him, seeing that he prepares
himself to abolish the decree of God by the sword. I will take care, he
says, that Jacob shall not enjoy the inheritance promised to him. What
is this but to annihilate the force of the benediction, of which he knew
that his father was the herald and the minister? Moreover, a lively
picture of a hypocrite is here set before us. He pretends that the death
of his father would be to him a mournful event: and doubtless it is a
religious duty to mourn over a deceased father. But it was a mere
pretense on his part, to speak of the day of mourning, when in his haste
to execute the impious murder of his brother, the death of his father
seemed to come too slowly, and he rejoiced at the prospect of its
approach.  <span id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) With what face could he
ever pretend to any human affection, when he gasps for his brother’s
death, and at the same time attempts to subvert all the laws of nature?
It is even possible, that an impulse of nature itself, extorted from him
the avowal, by which he would the more grievously condemn himself; as
God often censures the wicked out of their own mouth, and renders them
more inexcusable. But if a sense of shame alone restrains a cruel mind,
this is not to be deemed worthy of great praise; nay, it even betrays a
stupid and brutal contempt of God. Sometimes, indeed, the fear of man
influences even the pious, as we have seen, in the preceding chapter,
<span id="v.i-p151.1"></span>[Ge
26:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#001.md)<span id="v.i-p151.1"></span>,
respecting Jacob: but they soon rise above it, so that with them the
fear of God predominates; while forgetfulness of God so pervades the
hearts of the wicked, that they rest their hopes in men alone.
Therefore, he who abstains from wickedness merely through the fear of
man, and from a sense of shame, has hitherto made but little progress.
Yet the confession of the Papists is chiefly honored by them with this
praise, that it deters many from sin, through the fear lest they should
be compelled to proclaim their own disgrace. But the rule of piety is
altogether different, since it teaches our conscience to set God before
us as our witness and our judge.

<span id="v.i-p152"></span><span id="v.i-p152.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p153"></span>**42.** *And these words of Esau... were told
to Rebekah*. Moses now makes a transition to a new subject of history,
showing how Jacob, as a wanderer from his father’s house, went into
Mesopotamia. Without doubt, it was an exceedingly troublesome and severe
temptation to the holy matron, to see that, by her own deed, her son was
placed in imminent danger of death. But by faith she wrestled to retain
the possession of the grace once received. For, if she had been impelled
by a merely womanly attachment to her younger son, it certainly would
have been her best and shortest method, to cause the birthright to be
restored to Esau: for thus the cause of emulation would have been
removed; and he who was burning with grief at the loss of his right,
would have had his fury appeased. It is therefore an evidence of
extraordinary faith, that Rebekah does not come to any agreement, but
persuades her son to become a voluntary exile, and chooses rather to be
deprived of his presence, than that he should give up the blessing he
had once received. The benediction of the father might now seem
illusory; so as to make it appear wonderful that so much should be made
of it by Rebekah and Jacob: nevertheless, they were so far from
repenting of what they had done, that they do not refuse the bitter
punishment of exile, if only Jacob may carry with him the benediction
uttered by his father. Moreover, we are taught by this example, that we
must bear it patiently, if the cross attends the hope of a better life,
as its companion; or even if the Lord adopts us into his family, with
this condition, that we should wander as pilgrims without any certain
dwelling-place in the world. For, on this account, Jacob is thrust out
from his paternal home, where he might quietly have passed his life, and
is compelled to migrate to a strange land; because the blessing of God
is promised unto him. And as he did not attempt to purchase temporal
peace with his brother by the loss of the grace received; so must we
beware lest any carnal advantage or any allurements of the world should
draw us aside from the course of our vocation: let us rather bear with
magnanimity losses of all kinds, so that the anchor of our hope nay
remain fixed in heaven. When Rebekah says that Esau consoled himself
with the thought, that he would slay his brother; the meaning is, that
he could not be pacified by any other means, than by this wicked murder

<span id="v.i-p154"></span><span id="v.i-p154.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p155"></span>**44.** *And tarry with him a few days*. This
circumstance mitigates the severity of banishment. For the shortness of
the time of suffering avails not a little to support us in adversity.
And it was probable that the enmity of Esau would not prove so obstinate
as to be unassuaged by his brother’s absence. In the Hebrew expression
which is translated “a few days,” the word few is literally “one” put in
the plural number.  <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) Rebekah means,
that as soon as Jacob should have gone away of his own accord, the
memory of the offense would be obliterated from the mind of Esau; as if
she had said, Only depart hence for a little while, and we shall soon
assuage his anger.

<span id="v.i-p157"></span><span id="v.i-p157.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p158"></span>**45.** *Why should I be deprived of you both
in one day*? Why does Rebekah fear a double privation? for there was no
danger that Jacob, endued with a disposition so mild and placid, should
rise up against his brother. We see, therefore, that Rebekah concluded
that God would be the avenger of the iniquitous murder. Moreover,
although God, for a time, might seem to overlook the deed, and to
suspend his judgment, it would yet be necessary for him to withdraw from
the parricide. Therefore, by this law of nature, Rebekah declares that
she should be entirely bereaved; because she would be compelled to dread
and to detest him who survived. But if Rebekah anticipated in her mind
what the judgment of God would be, and devoted the murderer to
destruction, because she was persuaded that wickedness so great would
not be unpunished; much less ought we to close our eyes against the
manifest chastisements of God.  <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md)

<span id="v.i-p160"></span><span id="v.i-p160.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p161"></span>**46.** *And Rebekah said to Isaac*. When
Jacob might have fled secretly, his mother, nevertheless, obtains leave
for his departure from his father; for so a well-ordered domestic
government and discipline required. In giving another cause than the
true one to her husband, she may be excused from the charge of
falsehood; inasmuch as she neither said the whole truth nor left the
whole unsaid. No doubt, she truly affirms that she was tormented, even
to weariness of life, on account of her Hittite daughters-in-law: but
she prudently conceals the more inward evil, lest she should inflict a
mortal wound on her husband: and also, lest she should the more
influence the rage of Esau; for the wicked, often, when their crime is
detected, are the more carried away with desperation. Now, although in
consequence of the evil manners of her daughters-in-law, affinity with
the whole race became hateful to Rebekah, yet in this again the
wonderful providence of God is conspicuous, that Jacob neither blended,
nor entangled himself, with the future enemies of the Church.

<span id="v.i-p103"></span> This is a dangerous position, however it may
be modified or explained. True faith never leads to sin. It was the
mixture, not to say the predominance of unbelief, which caused Rebekah,
instead of waiting for the fulfillment of God’s promises in his own way,
to plot and to execute a scheme of imposture, which involved herself and
her family in perpetual disquietude. What Calvin calls zeal, he ought to
have called rashness and something worse. — *Ed*.

<span id="v.i-p106"></span> There is a great want of Calvin’s accustomed
caution and soundness in all this reasoning. It certainly was right that
Jacob should feel and express the fear, lest the deception which his
mother required him to practice should be detected, and should bring a
curse upon him and not a blessing. It would indeed have been a still
higher proof of integrity, and a still stronger exercise of faith, had
he repelled the importunities of his mother, saying, “How shall I do
this wickedness, and sin against God?” — *Ed*.

the sake of making sense of the passage, or because the edition from

<span id="v.i-p107.4"></span>matris, the translation above given seems
to be required. It agrees substantially with the French version, which

<span id="v.i-p108"></span> It is much more probable that Jacob was
influenced by a precipitate and ambitious desire to snatch the blessing
from the hand of his brother; and though he paused for a moment at the
apprehension of consequences, should his mother’s scheme fail, yet he
too readily acquiesced, and exposed himself to subsequent dangers, not
from a supreme regard to the will of God, but from that self-love which
so often overshoots its mark. — *Ed*.
