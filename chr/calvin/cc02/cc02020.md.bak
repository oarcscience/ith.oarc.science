<span id="xxi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 43.

<span id="xxi.i"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p1"></span><span id="xxi.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
43:1-34](../../../bib/kjv/gen043.htm#001.md)<span id="xxi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p2"></span>**1.** And the famine *was* sore in the land.

<span id="xxi.i-p3"></span>**1.** Porro fames gravis erat in terra.

<span id="xxi.i-p4"></span>**2.** And it came to pass, when they had
eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said
unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.

<span id="xxi.i-p5"></span>**2.** Itaque quum finissent edere alimentum,
quod attulerant ex Aegypto, dixit ad eos pater eorum, Revertimini, Emite
nobis pusillum cibi.

<span id="xxi.i-p6"></span>**3.** And Judah spake unto him, saying, The
man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face,
except your brother *be* with you.

<span id="xxi.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et dixit ad eum Jehudah, dicendo,
Contestando contestatus est nos vir, dicendo, Non videbitis faciem meam,
nisi fuerit frater vester vobiscum.

<span id="xxi.i-p8"></span>**4.** If thou wilt send our brother with us,
we will go down and buy thee food:

<span id="xxi.i-p9"></span>**4.** Si miseris fratrem nostrum nobiscum,
descendemus, et ememus tibi cibum.

<span id="xxi.i-p10"></span>**5.** But if thou wilt not send *him*, we
will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face,
except your brother *be* with you.

<span id="xxi.i-p11"></span>**5.** Quod si non miseris, non descendemus:
vir enim ille dixit nobis, Non videbitis faciem meam, nisi fuerit frater
vester vobiscum.

<span id="xxi.i-p12"></span>**6.** And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye
*so* ill with me, *as* to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?

<span id="xxi.i-p13"></span>**6.** At dixit Israel, Utquid malefecistis
mihi, ut nuntiaretis viro, quod adhuc frater esset vobis.

<span id="xxi.i-p14"></span>**7.** And they said, The man asked us
straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, *Is* your father yet
alive? have ye *another* brother? and we told him according to the tenor
of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your
brother down?

<span id="xxi.i-p15"></span>**7.** Et dixerunt, Interrogando
interrogavit vir ille de nobis et cognatione nostra, discendo, Num adhuc
pater vester vivit? Num est vobis frater? Et nuntiavimus ei secundum
verba ista: numquid sciendo sciebamus, quod dicturus esset, Descendere
faciatis fratrem vestrum?

<span id="xxi.i-p16"></span>**8.** And Judah said unto Israel his
father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may
live, and not die, both we, and thou, *and* also our little ones.

<span id="xxi.i-p17"></span>**8.** Et dixit Jehudah ad Israel patrem
suum, Mitte puerum mecum, et surgemus, et proficiscemur, et vivemus, et
non moriemur etiam nos etiam tu, etiam parvuli nostri.

<span id="xxi.i-p18"></span>**9.** I will be surety for him; of my hand
shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before
thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:

<span id="xxi.i-p19"></span>**9.** Ergo fidejubeo pro illo, de manu mea
requiras eum:; nisi reduxero eum ad to, et statuero eum ante to, poenae
obnoxius ero tibi omnibus diebus.

<span id="xxi.i-p20"></span>**10.** For except we had lingered, surely
now we had returned this second time.

<span id="xxi.i-p21"></span>**10.** Quia nisi tardavissemus, certe nunc
reversi fuissemus jam bis.

<span id="xxi.i-p22"></span>**11.** And their father Israel said unto
them, If *it must be* so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the
land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm,
and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:

<span id="xxi.i-p23"></span>**11.** Et dixit illis Israel pater eorum,
Si ita nunc oportet, hoc facite: tollite de optimis fructibus terrae in
vasis vestris, et deferte ad virum munus, pusillum resinae et pusillum
mellis, aromata, et stacten, pineas, et amygdalas.

<span id="xxi.i-p24"></span>**12.** And take double money in your hand;
and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry
*it* again in your hand; peradventure it *was* an oversight:

<span id="xxi.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et peduniam duplicem capite in
manibus vestris: et peduniam repositam in ore saccorum vestrorum
reponetis in manu vestra, si forte error esset.

<span id="xxi.i-p26"></span>**13.** Take also your brother, and arise,
go again unto the man:

<span id="xxi.i-p27"></span>**13.** Et fratrem vestrum capite, et
surgite, revertemini ad virum.

<span id="xxi.i-p28"></span>**14.** And God Almighty give you mercy
before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin.
If I be bereaved *of my children*, I am bereaved.

<span id="xxi.i-p29"></span>**14.** Deus autem omnipotens det vobis
misericordias ante virum, et dimittat vobis fratrem vestrum alium, et
Benjamin: et ego quemadmodum orbatus sum, orbatus sum.

<span id="xxi.i-p30"></span>**15.** And the men took that present, and
they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and
went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.

<span id="xxi.i-p31"></span>**15.** Et ceperunt viri minus hoc, et
duplicm peduniam ceperunt in manu sua, et Benjamin: et surrexerunt, et
descenderunt in Aegyptum, et steterunt coram Joseph.

<span id="xxi.i-p32"></span>**16.** And when Joseph saw Benjamin with
them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring *these* men home, and
slay, and make ready; for *these* men shall dine with me at noon.

<span id="xxi.i-p33"></span>**16.** Et vidit Joseph cum eis Benjamin, et
dixit praefecto domus suae, Addue viros in domum, et macta, et praepara:
quia mecum comedent viri in meridie.

<span id="xxi.i-p34"></span>**17.** And the man did as Joseph bade; and
the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.

<span id="xxi.i-p35"></span>**17.** Et fecit vir, quemadmodum dixit
Joseph: et venire fecit vir homines in domum Joseph.

<span id="xxi.i-p36"></span>**18.** And the men were afraid, because
they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the
money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought
in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us
for bondmen, and our asses.

<span id="xxi.i-p37"></span>**18.** Et timuerunt viri, quod adducti
essent in donrum Joseph, et dixerunt, Propter pecuniam, quae reddita est
in saccis nostris in principio, sumus adducti, ut volvat se contra nos,
et jactet se super nos, et capiat nos in servos, et asinos nostros.

<span id="xxi.i-p38"></span>**19.** And they came near to the steward of
Joseph’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,

<span id="xxi.i-p39"></span>**19.** Et accesserunt ad virum, qui erat
super domum Joseph, et loquuti sunt ad eum in ostio domus:

<span id="xxi.i-p40"></span>**20.** And said, O sir, we came indeed down
at the first time to buy food:

<span id="xxi.i-p41"></span>**20.** Et dixerunt, Quaesumus, domine mi:
descendendo descendimus in principio ad emendum escam.

<span id="xxi.i-p42"></span>**21.** And it came to pass, when we came to
the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, *every* man’s money
*was* in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have
brought it again in our hand.

<span id="xxi.i-p43"></span>**21.** Et fuit quum venissemus ad
hospitium, et aperuissemus saccos nostros, ecce, pecunia uniuseujusque
erat in ore sacci sui: pecunia nostra secundum pondus suum: et retulimus
eam in manu nostra.

<span id="xxi.i-p44"></span>**22.** And other money have we brought down
in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

<span id="xxi.i-p45"></span>**22.** Et pecuniam aliam detulimus in manu
nostra ad emendum escam: nescimus, quis posuerit pecuniam nostram in
saccis nostris.

<span id="xxi.i-p46"></span>**23.** And he said, Peace *be* to you, fear
not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in
your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.

<span id="xxi.i-p47"></span>**23.** Et dixit, Pax vobis, ne timeatis,
Deus vester, et Deus patris vestri dedit vobis thesaurum in saccis
vestris, pecunia vestra venit ad me: et adduxit ad eos Simhon.

<span id="xxi.i-p48"></span>**24.** And the man brought the men into
Joseph’s house, and gave *them* water, and they washed their feet; and
he gave their asses provender.

<span id="xxi.i-p49"></span>**24.** Et venire fecit vir ille homines in
domum Joseph: et dedit aquam, et laverunt pedes suos, et dedit pabulum
asinis eorum.

<span id="xxi.i-p50"></span>**25.** And they made ready the present
against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread
there.

<span id="xxi.i-p51"></span>**25.** Paraverunt autem munus, dum veniret
Joseph in meridie: audierunt enim, quod ibi comesturi essent panem.

<span id="xxi.i-p52"></span>**26.** And when Joseph came home, they
brought him the present which *was* in their hand into the house, and
bowed themselves to him to the earth.

<span id="xxi.i-p53"></span>**26.** Et venit Joseph ad domum, et
attulerunt ei munus, quod erat in manu eorum, in domum: et incurvaverunt
se ei super terram.

<span id="xxi.i-p54"></span>**27.** And he asked them of *their*
welfare, and said, *Is* your father well, the old man of whom ye spake?
*Is* he yet alive?

<span id="xxi.i-p55"></span>**27.** Et interrogavit eos de prosperitate,
et dixit, Num sanus est pater vester senex, quem dixeratis? Num adhuc
vivit?

<span id="xxi.i-p56"></span>**28.** And they answered, Thy servant our
father *is* in good health, he *is* yet alive. And they bowed down their
heads, and made obeisance.

<span id="xxi.i-p57"></span>**28.** Et dixerunt, Prospere est servo tuo
patri nostro, adhuc vivit: et prociderunt, et incurvaverunt se.

<span id="xxi.i-p58"></span>**29.** And he lifted up his eyes, and saw
his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, *Is* this your younger
brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto
thee, my son.

<span id="xxi.i-p59"></span>**29.** Et levavit oculos suos, et vidit
Benjamin fratrem suum, filium matris suae, et dixit, Num iste est frater
vester minimus, quem dixeratis mihi? Et dixit, Deus misereatur tui, fili
mi.

<span id="xxi.i-p60"></span>**30.** And Joseph made haste; for his
bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought *where* to weep; and he
entered into *his* chamber, and wept there.

<span id="xxi.i-p61"></span>**30.** Et festinavit Joseph, quia
incaluerant miserationes ejus super fratrem suum, et quaesivit ut
fleret: ingressus est itaque cubiculum, et flevit ibi.

<span id="xxi.i-p62"></span>**31.** And he washed his face, and went
out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.

<span id="xxi.i-p63"></span>**31.** Et lavit faciem suam, et egressus
est, et vim fecit sibi, et dixit, Appointe panem.

<span id="xxi.i-p64"></span>**32.** And they set on for him by himself,
and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with
him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the
Hebrews; for that *is* an abomination unto the Egyptians.

<span id="xxi.i-p65"></span>**32.** Et apposuerunt ei seorsum, illisque
seorsum: et Aegyptiis, qui comedebant cum eo, seorsum: non enim poterant
Aegyptii comedere cum Hebraeis panem: quia abominatio erat Aegyptiis.

<span id="xxi.i-p66"></span>**33.** And they sat before him, the
firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his
youth: and the men marvelled one at another.

<span id="xxi.i-p67"></span>**33.** Et sederunt coram eo primogenitus
secundum primogenituram suam, et parvus juxta parvitatem suam: et
admirati sunt viri unusquisque ad proximum suum.

<span id="xxi.i-p68"></span>**34.** And he took *and sent* messes unto
them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any
of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.

<span id="xxi.i-p69"></span>**34.** Et accepit partes a facie sua ad
illos, et multiplicavit partem Benjamin plus quam partes omnium illorum,
quinque partibus: et biberunt, et inebriaverunt se cum eo.

<span id="xxi.i-p70"></span> 

<span id="xxi.i-p71"></span><span id="xxi.i-p71.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p72"></span>**1.** *And the famine was sore in the
land*. In this chapter is recorded the second journey of the sons of
Jacob into Egypt, when the former supply of provision had been
exhausted. It may, however, here be asked, how Jacob could have
supported his family, even for a few days, with so small a quantity of
corn: for, suppose it to be granted that several asses were conducted by
each of the brethren, what was this to sustain three hundred persons?
 <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) For, since Abraham had a much
larger number of servants, and mention has been made above of the
servants of Isaac; it is incredible that Jacob was so entirely
destitute, as to have no servants left. If we say, that he, being a
stranger, had been compelled to sell them all, it is but an uncertain
guess. It seems to me more probable that they lived on acorns, herbs,
and roots. For we know that the orientals, especially when any necessity
urges, are content with slender and dry food, and we shall see
presently, that, in this scarcity of wheat, there was a supply of other
food. I suppose, therefore, that no more corn had been bought than would
suffice to furnish a frugal and restricted measure of food for Jacob
himself, and for his children and grandchildren: and that the food of
the servants was otherwise provided for. There is, indeed, no doubt that
the whole region had been compelled to resort to acorns, and fruits of
this kind, for food for the servants, and that wheaten bread was a
luxury belonging to the rich. This was, indeed, a severe trial, that
holy Jacob, of whom God had engaged to take care, should almost perish,
with his family, through hunger, and that the land of which he was
constituted the lord, in order that he might there happily enjoy the
abundance of all things, should even deny him bread as a stranger. For
he might seriously doubt what was the meaning of that remarkable
promise, I am God Almighty, grow and multiply: I will bless thee. It is
profitable for us to know these conflicts of the holy fathers, that,
fighting with the same arms with which they conquered, we also may stand
invincible, although God should withhold present help.

<span id="xxi.i-p74"></span><span id="xxi.i-p74.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p75"></span>**3.** *And Judah spake unto him, saying*.
Judah seems to feign something, for the purpose of extorting from his
father what he knew he would not freely grant; but it is probable that
many discourses had been held on both sides, which Moses, according to
his custom, has not related. And since Joseph so ardently desired the
sight of his brother Benjamin, it is not surprising that he should have
labored, in every possible way, to obtain it. It may also have happened
that he had caused some notification or legal summons to be served, by
which his brother was cited to make his appearance, as in judicial
causes. This however deserves to be noticed, that Moses relates the long
disputation which Jacob had with his sons, in order that we may know
with what difficulty he allowed his son Benjamin to be torn away from
him. For, though hunger was pressing, he nevertheless contended for
retaining him, just as if he were striving for the salvation of his
whole family. Whence, again, we may conjecture, that he suspected his
sons of a wicked conspiracy; and on this account Judah offers himself as
a surety. For he does not promise anything respecting the event, but
only, for the sake of clearing himself and his brethren, he takes
Benjamin under his care, with this condition, that if any injury should
be done to Benjamin, he would bear the punishment and the blame. From
the example of Jacob let us learn patient endurance, should the Lord
often compel us, by pressure of circumstances, to do many things
contrary to the inclination of our own minds; for Jacob sends away his
son, as if he were delivering him over unto death.

<span id="xxi.i-p76"></span><span id="xxi.i-p76.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p77"></span>**11.** *Take of the best fruits*  <span
id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) Though the fruits which Moses
enumerates were, for the most part, not very precious, because the
condition of holy Jacob was not such that he could send any royal
present; yet, according to his slender ability, he wished to appease
Joseph. Besides we know that fruits are not always estimated according
to their cost. And now, having commanded his sons to do what he thought
necessary, he has recourse to prayer, that God would give them favor
with the governor of Egypt. We must attend to both these points whenever
we are perplexed in any business; for we must not omit any of those
things which are expedient, or which may seem to be of use; and yet we
must place our reliance upon God. For the tranquillity of faith has no
affinity with indolence: but he who expects a prosperous issue of his
affairs from the Lord, will, at the same time, look closely to the means
which are in his power, and will apply them to present use. Meanwhile,
let the faithful observe this moderation, that when they have tried all
means, they still ascribe nothing to their own industry. At the same
time, let them be certainly convinced that all their endeavors will be
in vain, unless the Lord bless them. It is to be observed, also, in the
form of his supplication, that Jacob regards the hearts of men as
subject to the will of God. When we have to deal with men, we too often
neglect to look unto the Lord, because we do not sufficiently
acknowledge him as the secret governor of their hearts. But to whatever
extent unruly men may be carried away by violence, it is yet certain
that their passions are turned by God in whatever direction he pleases,
so that he can mitigate their ferocity as often as he sees good; or can
permit those to become cruel, who before were disposed to mildness. So
Jacob, although his sons had found an austere severity in Joseph, yet
trusts that his heart will be so in the hand of God, that it shall be
suddenly mounded to humanity. Therefore, as we must hope in the Lord,
when men deal unjustly with us, and must pray that they may be changed
for the better; so, on the other hand, we must remember that, when they
act with severity towards us, it is not done without the counsel of God.

<span id="xxi.i-p79"></span><span id="xxi.i-p79.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p80"></span>**14.** *If I be bereaved*. Jacob may seem
here to be hardly consistent with himself; for, if the prayer which
Moses has just related, was the effect of faith, he ought to have been
more calm; and, at least, to have given occasion to the manifestation of
the grace of God. But he appears to cut himself off from every ground of
confidence, when he supposes that nothing is left for him but
bereavement. It is like the speech of a man in despair, “I shall remain
bereaved as I am.” As if truly he had prayed in vain; or had feignedly
professed that the remedy was in the hand of God. If, however, we
observe to whom his speech was directed, the solution is easy. It is by
no means doubtful that he stood firmly on the promise which had been
given to him, and therefore he would hope for some fruit of his prayers;
yet he wished deeply to affect his sons, in order that they might take
greater care of their brother. For, it was in no common manner that
Benjamin was intrusted to their protection, when they saw their father
altogether overcome and almost lifeless with grief, until he should
receive his son again in safety. Interpreters, however, expound these
words variously. Some think that he complained, because now he was about
to be entirely bereaved. To others, the meaning seems to be, that
nothing worse could happen; since he had lost Joseph, whom he had
preferred to all the rest. Others are disposed to mark a double
bereavement, as if he had said, “I have lost two sons, and now a third
follows them.” But what, if we should thus interpret the words, “I see
what is my condition; I am a most wretched old man; my house, which
lately was filled with people, I find almost deserted.” So that, in
general terms, he is deploring the loss of all his sons, and is not
speaking of a part only. Moreover, it was his design to inspire his sons
with a degree of solicitude which should cause them to attend to their
duty with greater fidelity and diligence.  <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md)

<span id="xxi.i-p82"></span><span id="xxi.i-p82.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p83"></span>**16.** *And he said to the ruler of his
house*. Here we perceive the fraternal disposition of Joseph; though it
is uncertain whether he was perfectly reconciled, as I will shortly
show, in its proper place. If, however, remembering the injury, he loved
his brethren less than before, he was still far from having vindictive
feelings towards them. But because it was something suspicious that
foreigners and men of ignoble rank should be received in a friendly
manner, like known guests, to a banquet, by the chief governor of the
kingdom, the sons of Jacob would conceive a new fear; namely, that he
wished to cast them all into chains; and that their money had been
craftily concealed in their sacks, in order that it might prove the
occasion of accusation against them. It is however probable, that the
crime which they had committed against Joseph, occurred to their minds,
and that this fear had proceeded from a guilty conscience. For, unless
the judgment of God had tormented them, there was no cause why they
should apprehend such an act of perfidy. It may seem absurd, that
unknown men should be received to a feast by a prince of the highest
dignity. But why not rather incline to a different conjecture; namely,
that the governor of Egypt has done this for the purpose of exhibiting
to his friends the new and unwonted spectacle of eleven brethren sitting
at one table? It will, indeed, sometimes happen that similar anxiety to
that felt by Joseph’s brethren, may invade even the best of men; but I
would rather ascribe it to the judgment of God, that the sons of Jacob,
whose conscience accused them of having inhumanely treated their
brother, suspected that they would be dealt with in the same manner.
However, they take an early opportunity of vindicating themselves,
before inquiry is made respecting the theft. Now, freely to declare that
the money had been found in their sacks, and that they had brought it
from home to repay it immediately was a strong mark of their innocence.
Moreover, they do this in the very porch of the house, because they
suspected that, as soon as they entered, the question would be put to
them.

<span id="xxi.i-p84"></span><span id="xxi.i-p84.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p85"></span>**23.** *Peace be to you*. Because <span
id="xxi.i-p85.1"></span>םולש (*shalom*,) among the Hebrews, signifies
not only peace, but any prosperous and desirable condition, as well as
any joyful event, this passage may be expounded in two ways: either that
the ruler of Joseph’s house commands them to be of a peaceful and secure
mind; or that he pronounces it to be well and happy with them. The sum
of his answer, however, amounts to this, that there was no reason for
fear, because their affairs were in a prosperous state. And since, after
the manner of men, it was not possible that they should have paid the
money for the corn which was found in their sacks, he ascribes this to
the favor of God. For though true religion was then almost extinct in
the world, God nevertheless caused some knowledge of his goodness always
to remain in the hearts of men, which should render them responsible.
Hence it has happened that, following nature as their guide, unbelievers
have called every peculiarly excellent gift *Divine*. Moreover, because
corruption was so prevalent, that each nation deemed it lawful to
worship different gods, the ruler of Joseph’s house distinguishes the
God worshipped by the sons of Jacob from Egyptian idols. The conjecture,
however, is probable, that this man had been imbued with some sense of
religion. We know how great was the arrogance of that nation, and that
it supposed the whole world besides, to be deceived in the worship of
gods. Therefore, unless he had learned something better, he never would
have assigned so great an honor to any other gods than those of his own
country. Moreover, he does not ascribe the miracle to the God of the
land of Canaan, but to the peculiar God of their father. I, therefore,
do not doubt that Joseph, though not permitted openly to correct
anything in the received superstitions, endeavored, at least in his own
house, to establish the true worship of the one God, and always held
fast the covenant, concerning which, as a boy, he had heard his father
speak. This is the more to be observed, because the holy man could not
swerve, even in the least degree, from the common practice, without
incurring the odium of a nation so proud. Therefore, the excellency of
Joseph is commended in the person of his steward; because without fear
of public envy, he gives honor, within his own walls, to the true God.
If any one should ask, whence he knew that Jacob was a worshipped of the
true God; the answer is ready; that Joseph, notwithstanding his assumed
severity, had commanded that Simon should be gently treated in prison.
Though he had been left as a hostage, yet, if he had been regarded as a
spy, the keeper of the prison would have dealt more harshly with him.
There must, therefore, have been some command given respecting the
humane or moderate treatment of him. Whence the probable conjecture is
elicited, that Joseph had explained the affair to his steward, who was
admitted to his secret counsels.

<span id="xxi.i-p86"></span><span id="xxi.i-p86.1"></span>

<span id="xxi.i-p87"></span>**25.** *Against Joseph came at noon-day*.
It is doubtful whether this was the ordinary hour of dining among the
Egyptians, or whether Joseph, on that day, sat down earlier than he was
accustomed to do, on account of his guests. It is, however, most likely
that the usual custom of dining was observed. Although, among the people
of the East, there might be a different manner of living, dinners were
in use, not only among the Egyptians, but also in Judea, and in other
neighboring regions. Yet it is probable that this was to them, also, in
the place of a supper, both because they would sit long at table, and
our quick method of eating would not have been tolerable to people in
those heated climes; especially when they received guests with greater
luxury than usual, as it will presently appear, was done at this time.
The washing of the feet, (as we have seen before,) was a part of
hospitality, and intended to relieve weariness; because, in those parts,
the feet might easily become inflamed whenever they journeyed on foot.
It was also more honorable, according to ancient custom, that a portion
of food should be sent to each from Joseph, rather than that it should
be distributed by the cook. But because these things are trivial, and
are not conducive to piety, I only slightly touch upon them; and would
even omit them entirely, except that, to remove a scruple from the minds
of the unskillful, is sometimes useful, if it be but done sparingly and
with brevity.

<span id="xxi.i-p89"></span>**32.** *Because the Egyptians might not
eat, etc*  <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md) shows the reason of
this in the remark, ‘Because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the
Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.’ *Herodotus* also
remarks, that the Egyptians abstained from all familiar intercourse with
foreigners, since these were unclean to them, especially because they
slew and ate the animals which were sacred among the Egyptians. The
circumstance that Joseph eats separately from the other Egyptians is
strictly in accordance with the great difference of rank, and the spirit
of caste, which prevailed among the Egyptians.” — Egypt and the Books of
Moses, p. 39. — *Ed*.

} Moses says they might not eat with the Hebrews, because they abhorred
it, as being unlawful. For seeing that their religion forbade it, they
were so bound, that they could not do what they did not dare to do. This
passage teaches us how great was the pride of that nation; for, whence
did it arise that they so utterly detested the Hebrews, unless because
they thought themselves alone to be pure and holy in the world, and
acceptable to God? God, indeed, commands his worshipers to abstain from
all the pollutions of the Gentiles. But it behaves any one who separates
himself from others, to be himself pure and upright. Therefore
superstitious persons vainly attempt to claim this privilege for
themselves, seeing they carry their impurity within, and are destitute
of sincerity. Superstition, also, is affected with another disease;
namely, that it is full of pride, so that it despises all men, under the
pretext that they are vicious. It is asked, however, whether the
Egyptians were separated from Joseph, because they regarded him as
polluted: for this the words of Moses seem to intimate. If this
interpretation is received, then they esteemed their false religion so
highly, that they did not scruple to load their governor with
reproaches. I rather conjecture, that Joseph sat apart from them, for
the sake of honor; since it would be absurd that they, who disdained to
sit at the same table with him, should be invited as his guests.
Therefore it is probable that this distinct order was made by Joseph
himself, that he might maintain his own dignity; and yet that the sons
of Jacob were not mixed with the Egyptians, because the former were an
abomination to the latter. For though the origin of Joseph was known,
yet he had so passed over to the Egyptians, that he had become as one of
their body. For which reason, also, the king had given him a name, when
he adorned him with the insignia of his office as chief governor. Now,
when we see that the church of God was, at that time, so proudly
despised by profane men, we need not wonder that we also, at the present
day, are subjected to similar reproach. Meanwhile, we must endeavor to
keep ourselves pure from the filth of the world, for the Lord’s sake;
and yet this desire must be so at tempered, that we may be alienated
from the vices, rather than from the persons of men. For on this account
does God sanctify his children, that they may beware of the vices of the
unbelievers among whom they are conversant; and nevertheless may allure,
as many as are curable, to a participation of their piety. Two things
are here to be attended to; first, that we may be fully persuaded of the
genuineness of our faith; secondly, that our excessive and fruitless
fastidiousness may not entirely alienate many from the Lord, who
otherwise might have been won. For we are not expressly commanded so to
abhor the wicked, as not eat with them; but to avoid such association as
may subject us to the same yoke. Besides, this passage confirms what I
have before said, that the Hebrews had derived their name, not from
their passing over the river; (as some falsely imagine,) but from their
ancestor Heber. Nor was the fame of a single small and distantly
situated family, sufficiently celebrated in Egypt, to become the cause
of public dissension.

<span id="xxi.i-p92"></span>**33.** *The first-born according to his
birthright*  <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) Although of the
sons of Jacob four were born of bond-women; yet, since they were the
elder, they had precedence of their younger brethren, who had descended
from free-born mothers; whence it appears that they had been accustomed
by their father to keep this order. What, then, some one may say,
becomes of the declaration, “the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir
with the son of the free-woman?” Truly, I think, since Ishmael was
rejected, by the divine oracle proceeding from the mouth of Sarah, as
Esau was afterwards, Jacob was fully taught that he had as many heirs as
he had sons. Hence arose that equality which caused each to keep his
place, first, middle, or last, according to his age. But the design of
Moses was to show, that although Benjamin was the youngest, yet he was
preferred to all the rest in honor; because Joseph could not refrain
from giving him the principal token of his love. It was, indeed, his
intention to remain unknown; but affection so far prevails, that, beyond
the purpose of his mind, he suddenly breaks out into a declaration of
his affection. From the concluding portion of the chapter we gather,
what I recently intimated, that the feast was unusually luxurious, and
that they were received to it, in a liberal and joyful manner, beyond
the daily custom. For the word <span id="xxi.i-p93.1"></span>רכש
(*shakar*,) they “were merry,” signifies, either that they were not
always accustomed to drink wine, or that there was more than ordinary
indulgence at the sumptuous tables spread for them. Here, however, no
intemperance is implied, (so that drunkards may not plead the example of
the holy fathers as a pretext for their crime,) but an honorable and
moderate liberality. I acknowledge, indeed, that the word has a double
meaning, and is often taken in an ill sense; as in <span
id="xxi.i-p93.2"></span>[Ge 9:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen009.htm#021.md)<span
id="xxi.i-p93.2"></span>, and in similar places: but in the present
instance the design of Moses is clear. Should any one object, that a
frugal use of food and drink is simply that which suffices for the
nourishing of the body: I answer, although food is properly for the
supply of our necessities, yet the legitimate use of it may proceed
further. For it is not in vain, that our food has savor as well as vital
nutriment; but thus our heavenly Father sweetly delights us with his
delicacies. And his benignity is not in vain commended in <span
id="xxi.i-p93.3"></span>[Ps
104:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#015.md)<span id="xxi.i-p93.3"></span>,
where he is said to create “wine that maketh glad the heart of man.”
Nevertheless, the more kindly he indulges us, the more solicitously
ought we to restrict ourselves to a frugal use of his gifts. For we know
how unbridled are the appetites of the flesh. Whence it happens that, in
abundance, it is almost always lascivious, and in penury, impatient. We
must, however, adhere to St. Paul’s method, that we know how to abound
and to suffer need; that is, we must take great care if we have unusual
plenty, that it does not hurry us into luxury; and, on the other hand,
we must see to it, that we bear poverty with an equal mind. Some one,
perhaps, will say, that the flesh is more than sufficiently ingenious in
giving a specious color to its excesses; and, therefore, nothing more
should be allowed to it than necessity demands. And, truly, I confess,
we must diligently attend to what Paul prescribes, (<span
id="xxi.i-p93.4"></span>[Ro 13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014.md)<span
id="xxi.i-p93.4"></span>,)

<span id="xxi.i-p94"></span>“Make not provision for the flesh to fulfill
the lusts thereof.”

<span id="xxi.i-p95"></span>But because it greatly concerns all pious
people to receive their food from the hand of God, with quiet
consciences, it is necessary for them to know to what extent the use of
food and wine is lawful.

<span id="xxi.i-p81"></span> There is, however, another interpretation
of the passage which is worthy of attention. In our version, the words
are, “If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved;” but the
expression, of my children, is not in the original. The close
translation is simply, “If I be bereaved, I am bereaved.” And this may
be the language of entire resignation to the will of God. Jacob had had
a severe struggle in his mind, before he could give up his beloved
Benjamin: But having at length succeeded, he seems now freely to
surrender himself and his family to the divine will. “If I am bereaved,
I am bereaved.” I know the worst, and I am prepared to meet it.

themselves, and of the event of their actions, unto God in faith; which,
if it fell out otherwise than they wished, they would patiently bear.” —
