<span id="x-p1"></span>CHAPTER 32.

<span id="x.i"></span>

<span id="x.i-p1"></span><span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
32:1-32](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#001.md)<span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p2"></span>**1.** And Jacob went on his way, and the
angels of God met him.

<span id="x.i-p3"></span>**1.** Postea Iahacob abiit in viam suam, et
occurrerunt ei Angeli Dei.

<span id="x.i-p4"></span>**2.** And when Jacob saw them, he said, This
*is* God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.

<span id="x.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et dixit Iahacob, quando vidit eos,
Castra Dei sunt haec: et vocavit nomen loci illius Mahanaim.

<span id="x.i-p6"></span>**3.** And Jacob sent messengers before him to
Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

<span id="x.i-p7"></span>**3.** Misit autem Iahacob nuntios ante se ad
Esau fratrem suum ad terram Sehir in regionem Edom.

<span id="x.i-p8"></span>**4.** And he commanded them, saying, Thus
shall ye speak unto my lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have
sojourned with Laban, and stayed there until now:

<span id="x.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et praecepit eis dicendo, Sic dicentis
domino meo Esau, Sic dixit servus tuus Iahacob, Cum Laban havitavi et
moratus sum huc usque.

<span id="x.i-p10"></span>**5.** And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and
menservants, and womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I
may find grace in thy sight.

<span id="x.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et sunt mihi boves et asini, pecudes et
servi, et ancillae, et misi ut nuntiarem domino meo, ut invenirem
gratiam in oculis tuis.

<span id="x.i-p12"></span>**6.** And the messengers returned to Jacob,
saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee,
and four hundred men with him.

<span id="x.i-p13"></span>**6.** Reversi autem sunt nuntii ad Iahacob,
dicendo, Venimus ad fratrem tuum, ad Essau, et etiam pergit in occursum
tuum, et quadringenti viri cum eo.

<span id="x.i-p14"></span>**7.** Then Jacob was greatly afraid and
distressed: and he divided the people that *was* with him, and the
flocks, and herds, and the camels, into two bands;

<span id="x.i-p15"></span>**7.** Et timuit Iahacob valde, et angustiis
affectus est; et divisit populum, qui erat secum, et pecudes, et boves,
et camelos in duas turmas.

<span id="x.i-p16"></span>**8.** And said, If Esau come to the one
company, and smite it, then the other company which is left shall
escape.

<span id="x.i-p17"></span>**8.** Dixit enim, Si veniret Essau ad turmam
unam, et percusserit eam, turma, quae remanserit, evadet.

<span id="x.i-p18"></span>**9.** And Jacob said, O God of my father
Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me,
Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with
thee:

<span id="x.i-p19"></span>**9.** Et dixit Iahacob, Deus patris mei
Abraham, et Deus patris mei Ishac, Domine, qui dixisti ad me, Revertere
ad terram tuam et cognationem tuam, et benefaciam tibi.

<span id="x.i-p20"></span>**10.** I am not worthy of the least of all
the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy
servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am
become two bands.

<span id="x.i-p21"></span>**10.** Minor sum cunctis misericordiis, et
omni veritate, quam fecisti cum servo tuo: quai in baculo meo transivi
Iordanem hunc, et nunc factus sum in duas turmas.

<span id="x.i-p22"></span>**11.** Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand
of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come
and smite me, *and* the mother with the children.

<span id="x.i-p23"></span>**11.** Erue me nunc de manu fratris mei, de
manu Esau: timeo enim eum, ne ferte veniat, et percutiat me, matremque
cum filiis.

<span id="x.i-p24"></span>**12.** And thou saidst, I will surely do thee
good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered
for multitude.

<span id="x.i-p25"></span>**12.** Et tu dixisti, Benefaciendo benefaciam
tibi, et ponam semen tuum sicut arenam maris, quae non numeratur prae
multitudine.

<span id="x.i-p26"></span>**13.** And he lodged there that same night;
and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;

<span id="x.i-p27"></span>**13.** Et pernoctavit ibi nocte ipsa, et
accepit ex iis, quae occurrebant ad manum suam, manus mittendum ad Esau
fratrem suum.

<span id="x.i-p28"></span>**14.** Two hundred she goats, and twenty he
goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,

<span id="x.i-p29"></span>**14.** Capras ducentas et hircos viginti,
oves ducentas et arietes viginti:

<span id="x.i-p30"></span>**15.** Thirty milch camels with their colts,
forty kine, and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.

<span id="x.i-p31"></span>**15.** Camelos lactantes, et pullos earum
triginta: vaccas quadraginta, et juvencos decem: asinas viginti, et
pullos decem.

<span id="x.i-p32"></span>**16.** And he delivered *them* into the hand
of his servants, every drove by themselves; and said unto his servants,
Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.

<span id="x.i-p33"></span>**16.** Et dedit in manum servorum suorum,
singulos greges seorsum: dixitque ad servos suos, Transite ante me, et
interstitium ponetis inter gregem et gregem.

<span id="x.i-p34"></span>**17.** And he commanded the foremost, saying,
When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose *art*
thou? and whither goest thou? and whose *are* these before thee?

<span id="x.i-p35"></span>**17.** Et praecepit primo, dicendo, Si
occurrerrit tibi Esau frater meus, et interrogaverit to, dicendo, Cujus
es, et quo pergis, et cujus sunt ista ante to?

<span id="x.i-p36"></span>**18.** Then thou shalt say, *They be* thy
servant Jacob’s; it *is* a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold,
also he *is* behind us.

<span id="x.i-p37"></span>**18.** Dices, Servi tui Iahacob munus est,
missum ad dominum meum Esau: et ecce etiam ipse est post nos.

<span id="x.i-p38"></span>**19.** And so commanded he the second, and
the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner
shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him.

<span id="x.i-p39"></span>**19.** Praecepit etiam secundo, etiam tertio,
etiam cunctis pergentibus post greges, dicendo, Secundum verbum hoc
loquemini ad Esau, quando invenietis eum.

<span id="x.i-p40"></span>**20.** And say ye moreover, Behold, thy
servant Jacob *is* behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the
present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face;
peradventure he will accept of me.

<span id="x.i-p41"></span>**20.** Et dicetis etiam, Ecce servus tuus
Iahacob est post nos: dixit enim, Placabo faciem ejus munere, quod vadit
ante me, et postea videbo faciem ejus, si forte suscipiat faciem meam.

<span id="x.i-p42"></span>**21.** So went the present over before him:
and himself lodged that night in the company.

<span id="x.i-p43"></span>**21.** Transivit itaque munus ante eum: et
ipse pernoctavit nocte ipsa cum turma.

<span id="x.i-p44"></span>**22.** And he rose up that night, and took
his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and
passed over the ford Jabbok.

<span id="x.i-p45"></span>**22.** Et surrexit nocte ipsa, et accepit
duas uxores suas, et duas ancillas suas, et undecim liberos suos, et
transivit vadum Jaboc.

<span id="x.i-p46"></span>**23.** And he took them, and sent them over
the brook, and sent over that he had.

<span id="x.i-p47"></span>**23.** Et accepit eos, et transire fecit eos
torrentem, transire, inquam, fecit omnia quae erant sibi.

<span id="x.i-p48"></span>**24.** And Jacob was left alone; and there
wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.

<span id="x.i-p49"></span>**24.** Porro remansit Iahacob solus ipse: et
luctatus est vir cum eo, donec ascendit aurora.

<span id="x.i-p50"></span>**25.** And when he saw that he prevailed not
against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of
Jacob’s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

<span id="x.i-p51"></span>**25.** Et vidit quod non praevaleret ei, et
tetigit palam femoris ejus, et movit se pala femoris Iahacob, luctante
illo cum eo.

<span id="x.i-p52"></span>**26.** And he said, Let me go, for the day
breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

<span id="x.i-p53"></span>**26.** Tunc dixit, Dimitte me, quia ascendit
aurora. Cui respondit, Non dimittam to, nisi benedixeris mihi.

<span id="x.i-p54"></span>**27.** And he said unto him, What *is* thy
name? And he said, Jacob.

<span id="x.i-p55"></span>**27.** Et dixit ad eum, Quod est nomen tuum?
Et ait, Iahacob.

<span id="x.i-p56"></span>**28.** And he said, Thy name shall be called
no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and
with men, and hast prevailed.

<span id="x.i-p57"></span>**28.** Tunc dixit, Non Iahacob dicetur ultra
nomen tuum, sed Israel: quia princeps fuisti cum Deo, et hominibus
praevalebis.

<span id="x.i-p58"></span>**29.** And Jacob asked *him*, and said, Tell
*me*, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore *is* it *that* thou
dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.

<span id="x.i-p59"></span>**29.** Et interrogavit Iahacob, et dixit,
Indica, quaeso, nomen tuum. Et dixit, Utquid interrogas de nomine meo?
et benedixit ei illic.

<span id="x.i-p60"></span>**30.** And Jacob called the name of the place
Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.

<span id="x.i-p61"></span>**30.** Vocavit ergo Iahacob nomen loci,
Peniel: quia vidi Deum facie ad faciem, et evasit anima mea.

<span id="x.i-p62"></span>**31.** And as he passed over Penuel the sun
rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh.

<span id="x.i-p63"></span>**31.** Et ortus est ei sol, quando transivit
Penuel, et claudicabat in femore suo.

<span id="x.i-p64"></span>**32.** Therefore the children of Israel eat
not *of* the sinew which shrank, which *is* upon the hollow of the
thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in
the sinew that shrank.

<span id="x.i-p65"></span>**32.** Idciro non comedunt filii Israel
nervum contractionis, qui est in pala femoris, usque ad diem hanc: quia
tetigit palam femoris Iahacob in nervo contractionis.

<span id="x.i-p66"></span> 

<span id="x.i-p67"></span><span id="x.i-p67.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p68"></span>**1.** *And Jacob went on his way*. After
Jacob has escaped from the hands of his father-in-law, that is, from
present death, he meets with his brother, whose cruelty was as much, or
still more, to be dreaded; for by the threats of this brother he had
been driven from his country; and now no better prospect lies before
him. He therefore proceeds with trepidation, as one who goes to the
slaughter. Seeing, however, it was scarcely possible but that he should
sink oppressed by grief, the Lord affords him timely succor; and
prepares him for this conflict, as well as for others, in such a manner
that he should stand forth a brave and invincible champion in them all.
Therefore, that he may know himself to be defended by the guardianship
of God, angels go forth to meet him, arranged in ranks on both sides.
Hebrew interpreters think that the camp of the enemy had been placed on
one side; and that the angels, or rather God, stood on the other. But it
is much more probable, that angels were distributed in two camps on
different sides of Jacob, that he might perceive himself to be
everywhere surrounded and fortified by celestial troops; as in <span
id="x.i-p68.1"></span>[Ps 34:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#007.md)<span
id="x.i-p68.1"></span>, it is declared that angels, to preserve the
worshippers of God, pitch their tents around them. Yet I am not
dissatisfied with the opinion of those who take the dual number simply
for the plural; understanding that Jacob was entirely surrounded with an
army of angels. Now the use of this vision was twofold; for, first,
since the holy man was very anxious about the future, the Lord designed
early to remove this cause of terror from him; or, at least, to afford
him some alleviation, lest he should sink under temptation. Secondly,
God designed, when Jacob should have been delivered from his brother, so
to fix the memory of the past benefit in his mind, that it should never
be lost. We know how prone men are to forget the benefits of God. Even
while God is stretching out his hand to help them, scarcely one out of a
hundred raises his eyes towards heaven. Therefore it was necessary that
the visible protection of God should be placed before the eyes of the
holy man; so that, as in a splendid theater, he might perceive that he
had been lately delivered, not by chance, out of the hand of Laban; but
that he had the angels of God fighting for him; and might certainly
hope, that their help would be ready for him against the attempts of his
brother; and finally, that, when the danger was surmounted, he might
remember the protection he had received from them. This doctrine is of
use to us all, that we may learn to mark the invisible presence of God
in his manifested favors. Chiefly, however, it was necessary that the
holy man should be furnished with new weapons to endure the approaching
contest. He did not know whether his brother Esau had been changed for
the better or the worse. But he would rather incline to the suspicion
that the sanguinary man would devise nothing but what was hostile.
Therefore the angels appear for the purpose of confirming his faith in
future, not less than for that of calling past favors to his
remembrance. The number of these angels also encourages him not a
little: for although a single angel would suffice as a guardian for us,
yet the Lord acts more liberally towards us. Therefore they who think
that each of us is defended by one angel only, wickedly depreciate the
kindness of God. And there is no doubt that the devil, by this crafty
device, has endeavored, in some measure, to diminish our faith. The
gratitude of the holy man is noted by Moses, in the fact that he assigns
to the place a name, (*Galeed*,) as a token of perpetual remembrance.

<span id="x.i-p69"></span><span id="x.i-p69.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p70"></span>**3.** *And Jacob sent messengers*. It now
happened, by the providence of God, that Esau, having left his father,
had gone to Mount Seir of his own accord; and had thus departed from the
land of promise, by which means the possession of it would remain void
for the posterity of Jacob, without slaughter among brethren. For it was
not to be believed that he had changed his habitation, either because he
was compelled by his father’s command, or because he was willing to be
accounted inferior to his brother. I rather conjecture that he had
become greatly enriched, and that this induced him to leave his father’s
house. For we know that profane persons and men of this world so
vehemently pant for present advantages, that when anything offers itself
in accordance with their desire, they are hurried towards it with a
brutish impetuosity. Esau was imperious and ferocious; he was incensed
against his mother; had shaken off all reverence for his father, and
knew that he was himself also obnoxious to them both: his wives were
engaged in incessant contentions; it seemed to him hard and troublesome,
to be in the condition of a child in the family, when he was now
advancing to old age; for proud men do not regard themselves as free, so
long as any one has the preeminence over them. Therefore, in order to
pass his life free from the authority of others, he chose to live in a
state of separation from his father; and, allured by this attraction, he
disregarded the promised inheritance, and left the place for his
brother. I have said that this was done by the divine will: for God
himself declares by Malachi, that it was by a species of banishment that
Esau was led to Mount Seir. (<span id="x.i-p70.1"></span>[Mal
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#003)<span id="x.i-p70.1"></span>.md)
 <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) For although he departed
voluntarily, yet, by the secret counsel of God was he deprived of that
land which he had earnestly desired. But, attracted by the present lust
of dominion, he was blinded in his choice; since the land of Seir was
mountainous and rugged, destitute of fertility and pleasantness.
Moreover, he would appear to himself a great man, in giving his own name
to the country. Nevertheless, it is probable that Moses called that
country the land of Edom by the figure *prolepsis*, because it
afterwards began to be so called. The question now occurs, Whence did
Jacob know that his brother dwelt in that region? Though I assert
nothing as certain; yet the conjecture is probable, that he had been
informed of it by his mother; for, in the great number of her servants,
a faithful messenger would not be wanting. And it is easily gathered
from the words of Moses, that Jacob, before he had entered the land,
knew the fact respecting the new residence of his brother. And we know
that many things of this kind were omitted by Moses, which may easily
suggest themselves to the mind of the reader.

<span id="x.i-p72"></span><span id="x.i-p72.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p73"></span>**4.** *Thus shall ye speak unto my lord
Esau*. Moses here relates the anxiety of Jacob to appease his brother.
For this suppliant deprecation was extorted only by great and severe
torture of mind. It seems, however, to be an absurd submission, whereby
he cedes to his brother that dominion for which he had contended at the
hazard of his life. For if Esau has the primogeniture, what does Jacob
reserve for himself? For what end did he bring upon himself such hatred,
expose himself to such dangers, and at length endure twenty years of
banishment, if he does not refuse to be in subjection to his brother? I
answer, that though he gives up the temporal dominion, he yields nothing
of his right to the secret benediction. He knows that the effect of the
divine promise is still suspended: and therefore, being content with the
hope of the future inheritance, he does not hesitate, at present, to
prefer his brother in honor to himself, and to profess himself his
brother’s servant. Nor was there anything feigned in these words;
because he was willing to bear his brother on his shoulders; so that he
might not lose his own future right, which was as yet concealed.

<span id="x.i-p74"></span><span id="x.i-p74.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p75"></span>**5.** *I have oxen*. Jacob does not proclaim
his riches for the sake of boasting, but that by this method Esau might
be inclined to humanity. For it would have been exceedingly disgraceful,
cruelly to drive away one who had been enriched, by the favor of God, in
a distant land. Besides, he cuts off occasion of future emulation: for
if he had come empty and famishing, Esau might conceive fresh
indignation against him, through fear of the expense which might be
entailed on himself. Therefore Jacob declares, that he does not come for
the purpose of consuming his father’s substance, nor of being made rich
by his brother’s ruin: as if he had said, “Let thy earthly inheritance
be secure; thy claim shall not be injured by me; only suffer me to
live.” By this example we are taught in what way we are to cultivate
peace with the wicked. The Lord does not indeed forbid us to defend our
own right, so far as our adversaries allow; but we must rather recede
from that right, than originate contention by our own fault.

<span id="x.i-p76"></span><span id="x.i-p76.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p77"></span>**6.** *And the messengers returned*. Esau
advances to meet his brother with a feeling of benevolence: but Jacob,
reflecting on his cruel ferocity, inflated spirits, and savage threats,
expects no humanity from him. And the Lord willed that the mind of his
servant should be oppressed by this anxiety for a time, although without
any real cause, in order the more to excite the fervor of his prayer.
For we know what coldness, on this point, security engenders. Therefore,
lest our faith, being stirred up by no stimulants, should become torpid,
God often suffers us to fear things which are not terrible in
themselves. For although he anticipates our wishes, and opposes our
evils, he yet conceals his remedies until he has exercised our faith.
Meanwhile it is to be noted, that the sons of God are never endued with
a constancy so steadfast, that the infirmity of the flesh does not
betray itself in them. For they who fancy that faith is exempt from all
fear, have had no experience of the true nature of faith. For God does
not promise that he will be present with us for the purpose of removing
the sense of our dangers, but in order that fear may not prevail, and
overwhelm us in despair. Moreover our faith is never so firm at every
point, as to repel wicked doubts and sinful fears, in the way that might
be wished.

<span id="x.i-p78"></span><span id="x.i-p78.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p79"></span>**7.** *And he divided the people*. Moses
relates that Jacob formed his plans according to the existing state of
affairs. He divides his family into two parts,  <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) and puts his maids in the foremost
place, that they may bear the first assault, if necessary; but he places
his free wives further from the danger. Hence indeed we gather, that
Jacob was not so overcome with fear as to be unable to arrange his
plans. We know that when a panic seizes the mind, it is deprived of
discretion; and they who ought to look after their own concerns, become
stupid and inanimate. Therefore it proceeded from the spirit of faith
that Jacob interposed a certain space between the two parts of his
family, in order that if any destruction approached, the whole seed of
the Church might not perish. For by this scheme, he offered the half of
his family to the slaughter, that, at length, the promised inheritance
might come to the remainder who survived.

<span id="x.i-p81"></span><span id="x.i-p81.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p82"></span>**9.** *O God of my father Abraham*. Having
arranged his affairs as the necessity of the occasion suggested, he now
retakes himself to prayer. And this prayer is evidence that the holy man
was not so oppressed with fear as to prevent faith from proving
victorious. For he does not, in a hesitating manner, commend himself and
his family to God; but trusting both to God’s promises and to the
benefits already received, he casts his cares and his troubles into his
heavenly Father’s bosom. We have declared before, what is the point
aimed at in assigning these titles to God; in calling God the God of his
fathers Abraham and Isaac, and what the terms mean; namely, that since
men are so far removed from God, that they cannot, by their own power,
ascend to his throne, he himself comes down to the faithful. God in thus
calling himself the God of Abraham and Isaac, graciously invites their
son Jacob to himself: for, access to the God of his fathers was not
difficult to the holy man. Again, since the whole world had sunk under
superstition, God would have himself to be distinguished from all idols,
in order that he might retain an elect people in his own covenant.
Jacob, therefore, in expressly addressing God as the God of his fathers,
places fully before himself the promises given to him in their person,
that he may not pray with a doubtful mind, but may securely rely on this
stay, that the heir of the promised blessing will have God propitious
towards him. And indeed we must seek the true rule of prayer in the word
of God, that we may not rashly break through to Him, but may approach
him in the manner in which he has revealed himself to us. This appears
more clearly from the adjoining context, where Jacob, recalling the
command and promise of God to memory, is supported as by two pillars.
Certainly the legitimate method of praying is, that the faithful should
answer to God who calls them; and thus there is such a mutual agreement
between his word and their vows, that no sweeter and more harmonious
symphony can be imagined. “O Lord,” he says, “I return at thy command:
thou also didst promise protection to me returning; it is therefore
right that thou shouldest become the guide of my journey.” This is a
holy boldness, when, having discharged our duty according to God’s
calling, we familiarly ask of him whatsoever he has promised; since he,
by binding himself gratuitously to us, becomes in a sense voluntarily
our debtor. But whoever, relying on no command or promise of God, offers
his prayers, does nothing but cast vain and empty words into the air.
This passage gives stronger confirmation to what has been said before,
that Jacob did not falsely pretend to his wives, that God had commanded
him to return. For if he had then spoken falsely, no ground of hope
would now be left to him. But he does not scruple to approach the
heavenly tribunal with this confidence, that he shall be protected by
the hand of God, under whose auspices he had ventured to return to the
land of Canaan.

<span id="x.i-p83"></span><span id="x.i-p83.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p84"></span>**10.** *I am not worthy of the least of all
the mercies*  <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) Although this
expression sounds harsh to Latin ears, the sense is not obscure. Jacob
confesses, that greater mercies of God had been heaped upon him than he
had dared to hope for: and therefore, far be it from him that he should
plead anything of dignity or merit, for the purpose of obtaining what he
asks. He therefore says, that he is less than God’s favors; because he
felt himself to be unworthy of those excellent gifts which the Lord had
so liberally bestowed upon him. Moreover, that the design of the holy
patriarch may more clearly appear, the craft of Satan is to be observed:
for, in order to deter us from praying, through a sense of our
unworthiness, he would suggest to us this thought, “Who art thou that
thou shouldst dare to enter into the presence of God?” Jacob early
anticipates this objection, in declaring beforehand that he is unworthy
of God’s former gifts, and at the same time acknowledges that God is not
like men, in ever becoming weary to continue and increase his acts of
kindness. Meanwhile, Jacob collects materials for confidence from the
fact, that he has so often found God benignant towards him. Therefore,
he had a double end in view; first, because he wished to counteract the
distrust which might steal upon him in consequence of the magnitude of
God’s gifts; and then, he turns those gifts to a different purpose, to
assure himself that God would be the same to him that he had hitherto
been. He uses two words, *mercies* and *truth*, to show that God is
inclined by his mere goodness to benefit us; and in this way proves his
own faithfulness. This combination of mercy with truth frequently occurs
in the Scriptures, to teach us that all good things flow to us through
the gratuitous favor of God; but that we are made capable of receiving
them, when by faith we embrace his promises.

<span id="x.i-p86"></span>*For with my staff*  <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) Jacob does not enumerate separately
the mercies of God, but under one species comprises the rest; namely,
that whereas he had passed over Jordan, a poor and solitary traveler, he
now returns rich, and replenished with abundance. The antithesis between
a *staff* and *two troops* is to be noticed; in which he compares his
former solitude and poverty with his present affluence.

<span id="x.i-p88"></span><span id="x.i-p88.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p89"></span>**11.** *Deliver me*. After he has declared
himself to be bound by so many of God’s benefits that he cannot boast of
his own merits, and thus raised his mind to higher expectation, he now
mentions his own necessity, as if he would say, “O Lord, unless thou
choosest to reduce so many excellent gifts to nothing, now is the time
for thee to succor one, and to avert the destruction which, through my
brother, is suspended over me.” But having thus expressed his fear, he
adds a clause concerning the blessing promised him, that he may confirm
himself in the promises made to him. *To slay the mother with the
children*, I suppose to have been a proverbial saying among the Jews,
which means to leave nothing remaining. It is a metaphor taken from
birds, when hawks seize the young with their dams, and empty the whole
nest.  <span id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md)

<span id="x.i-p91"></span><span id="x.i-p91.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p92"></span>**13.** *And took of that which came to his
hand*. In endeavoring to appease his brother by presents, he does not
act distrustfully, as if he doubted whether he should be safe under the
protection of God. This, indeed, is a fault too common among men, that
when they have prayed to God, they turn themselves hither and thither,
and contrive vain subterfuges for themselves: whereas the principal
advantage of prayer is, to wait for the Lord in silence and quietness.
But the design of the holy man was not to busy and to vex himself, as
one discontented with the sole help of God. For although he was
certainly persuaded that to have God propitious to him would alone be
sufficient, yet he did not omit the use of the means which were in his
power, while leaving success in the hand of God. For though by prayer we
cast our cares upon God, that we may have peaceful and tranquil minds;
yet this security ought not to render us indolent. For the Lord will
have all the aids which he affords us applied to use. But the diligence
of the pious differs greatly from the restless activity of the world;
because the world, relying on its own industry, independently of the
blessing of God, does not consider what is right or lawful; moreover it
is always in trepidation, and by its bustling, increases more and more
its own disquietude. The pious, however, hoping for the success of their
labor, only from the mercy of God, apply their minds in seeking out
means, for this sole reason, that they may not bury the gifts of God by
their own torpor. When they have discharged their duty, they still
depend on the same grace of God; and when nothing remains which they can
attempt, they nevertheless are at rest.

<span id="x.i-p93"></span><span id="x.i-p93.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p94"></span>**14.** *Two hundred she-goats*. Hence we
perceive the value which Jacob set upon the promise given to him, seeing
he does not refuse to make so great a sacrifice of his property. We know
that those things which are obtained with great toil and trouble are the
more highly esteemed. So that generally they who are enriched by their
own labor are proportionally sparing and tenacious. It was, however, no
trivial diminution even of great wealth, to give forty cows, thirty
camels with their young, twenty bulls, and as many asses with their
foals, two hundred she-goats, and as many sheep, with twenty rams, and
the same number of he-goats. But Jacob freely lays upon himself this
tax, that he may obtains a safe return to his own country. Certainly it
would not have been difficult to find some nook where he might live with
his property entire: and an equally commodious habitations might have
been found elsewhere. But, that he might not lose the benefit of the
promise, he purchases, at so great a price, from his brother, a
peaceable abode in the land of Canaan. Therefore should we be ashamed of
our effeminacy and tardiness, who wickedly turn aside from the duty of
our calling, as soon as any loss is to be sustained. With a clear and
loud voice the Lord commands us to do what he pleases; but some, because
they find it troublesome to take up their burdens, lie in idleness;
pleasures also keep back some; riches or honors impede others; finally,
few follow God, because scarcely one in a hundred will bear to be
losers. In putting a space between the messengers, and in sending them
at different times from each other, he does it to mitigate by degrees
the ferocity of his brother: Whence we infer again, that he was not so
seized with fear, as to be unable prudently to order his affairs.

<span id="x.i-p95"></span><span id="x.i-p95.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p96"></span>**22.** *And he rose up that night*. After he
has prayed to the Lord, and arranged his plans, he now takes confidence
and meets the danger. By which example the faithful are taught, that
whenever any danger approaches, this order of proceeding is to be
observed; first, to resort directly to the Lord; secondly, to apply to
immediate use whatever means of help may offer themselves; and thirdly,
as persons prepared for any event, to proceed with intrepidity
whithersoever the Lord commands. So Jacob, that he might not fail in
this particular, does not dread the passage which he perceives to be
full of hazard, but, as with closed eyes, pursues his course. Therefore,
after his example, we must overcome anxiety in intricate affairs, lest
we should be hindered or retarded in our duty. He remains alone, —
having sent forward his wives and children,  <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) — not that he might himself escape if
he heard of their destruction, but because solitude was more suitable
for prayer. And there is no doubt that, fearing the extremity of his
peril, he was completely carried away with the ardor of supplication to
God.

<span id="x.i-p98"></span><span id="x.i-p98.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p99"></span>**24.** *There wrestled a man with him*  <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) Although this vision was particularly
useful to Jacob himself, to teach him beforehand that many conflicts
awaited him, and that he might certainly conclude that he should be the
conqueror in them all; there is yet not the least doubt that the Lord
exhibited, in his person, a specimen of the temptations — common to all
his people — which await them, and must be constantly submitted to, in
this transitory life. Wherefore it is right to keep in view this designs
of the vision, which is to represent all the servants of God in this
world as wrestlers; because the Lord exercises them with various kinds
of conflicts. Moreover, it is not said that Satan, or any mortal man,
wrestled with Jacob, but God himself: to teach us that our faith is
tried by him; and whenever we are tempted, our business is truly with
him, not only because we fight under his auspices, but because he, as an
antagonist, descends into the arena to try our strength. This, though at
first sight it seems absurd, experience and reason teaches us to be
true. For as all prosperity flows from his goodness, so adversity is
either the rod with which he corrects our sins, or the test of our faith
and patience. And since there is no kind of temptations by which God
does not try his faithful people, the similitude is very suitable, which
represents him as coming, hand to hand, to combat with them. Therefore,
what was once exhibited under a visible form to our father Jacob, is
daily fulfilled in the individual members of the Church; namely, that,
in their temptations, it is necessary for them to wrestle with God. He
is said, indeed, to tempt us in a different manner from Satan; but
because he alone is the Author of our crosses and afflictions, and he
alone creates light and darkness, (as is declared in Isaiah,) he is said
to tempt us when he makes a trial of our faith. But the question now
occurs, Who is able to stand against an Antagonist, at whose breath
alone all flesh perishes and vanishes away, at whose look the mountains
melt, at whose word or beck the whole world is shaken to pieces, and
therefore to attempt the least contest with him would be insane
temerity? But it is easy to untie the knot. For we do not fight against
him, except by his own power, and with his own weapons; for he, having
challenged us to this contest, at the same time furnishes us with means
of resistance, so that he both fights *against* us and *for* us. In
short, such is his apportioning of it is conflict, that, while he
assails us with one hand, he defends us with the other; yea, inasmuch as
he supplies us with more strength to resist than he employs in opposing
us, we may truly and properly say, that he fights *against* us with his
*left* hand, and *for* us with his *right* hand. For while he lightly
opposes us, he supplies invincible strength whereby we overcome. It is
true he remains at perfect unity with himself: but the double method in
which he deals with us cannot be otherwise expressed, than that in
striking us with a human rod, he does not put forth his full strength in
the temptation; but that in granting the victory to our faith, he
becomes in us stronger than the power by which he opposes us. And
although these forms of expression are harsh, yet their harshness will
be easily mitigated in practice. For if temptations are contests, (and
we know that they are not accidental, but are divinely appointed for
us,) it follows hence, that God acts in the character of an antagonist,
and on this the rest depends; namely, that in the temptation itself he
appears to be weak *against* us, that he may conquer *in* us. Some
restrict this to one kind of temptation only, where God openly and
avowedly manifests himself as our adversary, as if armed for our
destruction. And truly, I confess, that this differs from common
conflicts, and requires, beyond all others, a rare, and even heroic
strength. Yet I include willingly every kind of conflict in which God
exercises the faithful: since in all they have God for an antagonist,
although he may not openly proclaim himself hostile unto them. That
Moses here calls *him* a man whom a little after he declares to have
been God, is a sufficiently usual form of speech. For since God appeared
under the form of a man, the name is thence assumed; just as, because of
the visible symbol, the Spirit is called a dove; and, in turn, the name
of the Spirit is transferred to the dove. That this disclosure was not
sooner made to the holy man, I understand to be for this reason, because
God had resolved to call him, as a soldier, robust and skillful in war,
to more severe contests. For as raw recruits are spared, and young oxen
are not immediately yoked to the plough; so the Lord more gently
exercises his own people, until, having gathered strength, they become
more inured to toil. Jacob, therefore, having been accustomed to bear
sufferings, is now led forth to real war. Perhaps also, the Lord had
reference to the conflict which was then approaching. But I think Jacob
was admonished, at his very entrance on the promised land, that he was
not there to expect a tranquil life for himself. For his return to his
own country might seem to be a kind of release; and thus Jacob, like a
soldier who had kept his term of service, would have given himself up to
repose. Wherefore it was highly necessary for him to be taught what his
future conditions should be. We, also, are to learn from him, that we
must fight during the whole course of our life; lest any one, promising
himself rest, should wilfully deceive himself. And this admonition is
very needful for us; for we see how prone we are to sloth. Whence it
arises, that we shall not only be thinking of a truce in perpetual war;
but also of peace in the heat of the conflict, unless the Lord rouse us.

<span id="x.i-p101"></span><span id="x.i-p101.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p102"></span>**25.** *And when he saw that he prevailed
not against him*. Here is described to us the victory of Jacob, which,
however, was not gained without a wound. In saying that the wrestling
angel, or God, wished to retire from the contest, because he saw he
should not prevail, Moses speaks after the manner of men. For we know
that God, when he descends from his majesty to us, is wont to transfer
the properties of human nature to himself. The Lord knew with certainty
the event of the contest, before he came down to engage in it; he had
even already determined what he would do: but his knowledge is here put
for the experience of the thing itself.

<span id="x.i-p103"></span>*He touched the hollow of his thigh*. Though
Jacob gains the victory; yet the angel strikes him on the thigh, from
which cause he was lame even to the end of his life. And although the
vision was by night, yet the Lord designed this mark of it to continue
through all his days, that it might thence appear not to have been a
vain dream. Moreover, by this sign it is made manifest to all the
faithful, that they can come forth conquerors in their temptations, only
by being injured and wounded in the conflict. For we know that the
strength of God is made perfect in our weakness, in order that our
exaltation may be joined with humility; for if our own strength remained
entire, and there were no injury or dislocation produced, immediately
the flesh would become haughty, and we should forget that we had
conquered by the help of God. But the wound received, and the weakness
which follows it, compel us to be modest.

<span id="x.i-p104"></span><span id="x.i-p104.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p105"></span>**26.** *Let me go*. God concedes the praise
of victory to his servant, and is ready to depart, as if unequal to him
in strength: not because a truce was needed by him, to whom it belongs
to grant a truce or peace whenever he pleases; but that Jacob might
rejoice over the grace afforded to him. A wonderful method of
triumphing; where the Lord, to whose power all praise is entirely due,
yet chooses that feeble man shall excel as a conqueror, and thus raises
him on high with special eulogy. At the same time he commends the
invincible perseverance of Jacob, who, having endured a long and severe
conflict, still strenuously maintains his ground. And certainly we adopt
a proper mode of contending, when we never grow weary, till the Lord
recedes of his own accord. We are, indeed, permitted to ask him to
consider our infirmity, and, according to his paternal indulgence, to
spare the tender and the weak: we may even groan under our burden, and
desire the termination of our contests; nevertheless, in the meantime,
we must beware lest our minds should become relaxed or faint; and rather
endeavor, with collected mind and strength, to persist unwearied in the
conflict. The reason which the angel assigns, namely, that the day
breaketh, is to this effect, that Jacob may now that he has been
divinely taught by the nocturnal vision.  <span
id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md)

<span id="x.i-p107"></span>*I will not let thee go, except*. Hence it
appears, that at length the holy man knew his antagonist; for this
prayer, in which he asks to be blessed, is no common prayer. The
inferior is blessed by the greater; and therefore it is the property of
God alone to bless us. Truly the father of Jacob did not otherwise bless
him, than by divine command, as one who represented the person of God. A
similar office also was imposed on the priests under the law, that, as
ministers and expositors of divine grace, they might bless the people.
Jacob knew, then, that the combatant with whom he had wrestled was God;
because he desires a blessing from him, which it was not lawful simply
to ask from mortal man. So, in my judgment, ought the place in Hosea
(<span id="x.i-p107.1"></span>[Ho
12:3](../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003)<span id="x.i-p107.1"></span>.md) to
be understood, Jacob prevailed over the angel, and was strengthened; he
wept, and made supplication to him. For the Prophet means, that after
Jacob had come off conqueror, he was yet a suppliant before God, and
prayed with tears. Moreover, this passage teaches us always to expect
the blessing of God, although we may have experienced his presence to be
harsh and grievous, even to the disjointing of our members. For it is
far better for the sons of God to be blessed, though mutilated and half
destroyed, than to desire that peace in which they shall fall asleep, or
than they should withdraw themselves from the presence of God, so as to
turn away from his command, that they may riot with the wicked.

<span id="x.i-p108"></span><span id="x.i-p108.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p109"></span>**28.** *Thy name shall be called no more
Jacob*. Jacob, as we have seen, received his name from his mother’s
womb, because he had seized the heel of his brother’s foot, and had
attempted to hold him back. God now gives him a new and more honorable
name; not that he may entirely abolish the other, which was a token of
memorable grace, but that he may testify a still higher progress of his
grace. Therefore, of the two names the second is preferred to the
former, as being more honorable. The name is derived from <span
id="x.i-p109.1"></span>הרש (*sarah*) or <span id="x.i-p109.2"></span>רוש
(*sur*,) which signifies to rule, as if he were called a Prince of God:
for I have said, a little before, that God had transferred the praise of
his own strength to Jacob, for the purpose of triumphing in his person.
The explanation of the name which is immediately annexed, is thus given
literally by Moses, “Because thou hast ruled with, or, towards God and
towards man, and shalt prevail.” Yet the sense seems to be faithfully
rendered by Jerome:  <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) but if
Jacob acted thus heroically with God, much more should he prove superior
to men; for certainly it was the purpose of God to send forth his
servant to various combats, inspired with the confidence resulting from
so great a victory, lest he should afterwards become vacillating. For he
does not merely impose a name, as risen are accustomed to do, but with
the name he gives the thing itself which the name implies, that the
event may correspond with it.

<span id="x.i-p111"></span><span id="x.i-p111.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p112"></span>**29.** *Tell me, I pray thee, thy name*.
This seems opposed to what is declared above; for I have lately said,
that when Jacob sought a blessing, it was a token of his submission.
Why, therefore, as if he were of doubtful mind, does he now inquire the
name of him whom he had before acknowledged to be God? But the solution
of the question is easy; for, though Jacob does acknowledge God, yet,
not content will an obscure and slight knowledge, he wishes to ascend
higher. And it is not to be wondered at, that the holy man, to whom God
had manifested himself under so many veils and coverings, that he had
not yet obtained any clear knowledge of him, should break forth in this
wish; nay, it is certain that all the saints, under the law, were
inflamed with this desire. Such a prayer also of Manoah, is read in
<span id="x.i-p112.1"></span>[Jud
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/jdg013.htm#018.md)<span id="x.i-p112.1"></span>, to
which the answer from God is added, except that there, the Lord
pronounces his name to be wonderful and secret, in order that Manoah may
not proceed further. The sum therefore is this, that though Jacob’s wish
was pious, the Lord does not grant it, because the time of full
revelation was not yet completed: for the fathers, in the beginning,
were required to walk in the twilight of morning; and the Lord
manifested himself to them, by degrees, until, at length, Christ the Sun
of Righteousness arose, in whom perfect brightness shines forth. This is
the reason why he rendered himself more conspicuous to Moses, who
nevertheless was only permitted to behold his glory from behind: yet
because he occupied an intermediate place between patriarchs and
apostles, he is said, in comparison with them, to have seen, face to
face, the God Who had been hidden from the fathers. But now, since God
has approached more nearly unto us, our ingratitude is most impious and
detestable, if we do not run to meet with ardent desire to obtain such
great grace; as also Peter admonishes us in the first chapter of his
first epistle. (<span id="x.i-p112.2"></span>[1 Pet.
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#013)<span id="x.i-p112.2"></span>..md) It
is to be observed, that although Jacob piously desires to know God more
fully, yet, because he is carried beyond the bounds prescribed to the
age in which he lived, he suffers a repulse: for the Lord, cutting short
his wish, commands him to rest contented with his own blessing. But if
that measure of illumination which we have received, was denied to the
holy man, how intolerable will be our curiosity, if it breaks forth
beyond the contended limit now prescribed by God.

<span id="x.i-p113"></span><span id="x.i-p113.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p114"></span>**30.** *And Jacob called the name of the
place*  <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) The gratitude of our
father Jacob is again commended, because he took diligent care that the
memory of God’s grace should never perish. He therefore leaves a
monument to posterity, from which they might know that God had appeared
there; for this was not a private vision, but had reference to the whole
Church. Moreover, Jacob not only declares that he has seen the face of
God, but also gives thanks that he has been snatched from death. This
language frequently occurs in the Scriptures, and was common among the
ancient people; and not without reason; for, if the earth trembles at
the presence of God, if the mountains melt, if darkness overspreads the
heavens, what must happen to miserable men! Nay, since the immense
majesty of God cannot be comprehended even by angels, but rather absorbs
them; were his glory to shine on us it would destroy us, and reduce us
to nothing, unless he sustained and protected us. So long as we do not
perceive God to be present, we proudly please ourselves; and this is the
imaginary life which the flesh foolishly arrogates to itself when it
inclines towards the earth. But the faithful, when God reveals himself
to them, feel themselves to be more evanescent than any smoke. Finally;
would we bring down the pride of the flesh, we must draw near to God. So
Jacob confesses that, by the special indulgence of God, he had been
rescued from destruction when he saw God. It may however be asked, “Why,
when he had obtained so slight a taste only of God’s glory, he should
boast that he had seen him, face to face?” I answer, it is in no way
absurd that Jacob highly celebrates this vision above all others, in
which the Lord had not so plainly appeared unto him; and yet, if it be
compared with the splendor of the gospel, or even of the law, it will
appear like sparks, or obscure rays. The simple meaning then is, that he
saw God in an unwonted and extraordinary manner. Now, if Jacob so
greatly exults and congratulates himself in that slender measure of
knowledge; what ought we to do at this day, to whom Christ, the living
image of God, is evidently set before our eyes in the mirror of the
gospel! Let us therefore learn to open our eyes, lest we be blind at
noonday, as Paul exhorts us in <span id="x.i-p115.2"></span>[2Co
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#001.md)<span id="x.i-p115.2"></span>:1.

<span id="x.i-p116"></span><span id="x.i-p116.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p117"></span>**31.** *And he halted upon his thigh*. It is
probable, and it may be gathered even from the words of Moses, that this
halting was without the sense of pain, in order that the miracle might
be the more evident. For God, in the flesh of his servant, has exhibited
a spectacle to all ages, from which the faithful may perceive that no
one is such a powerful combatant as not to carry away some wound after a
spiritual convict, for infirmity ever cleaves to all, that no one may be
pleased with himself above measure. Whereas Moses relates that the Jews
abstained from the shrunken sinew, or that part of the thigh in which it
was placed: this was not done out of superstition.  <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) For that age, as we know, was the
infancy of the Church; wherefore the Lord retained the faithful, who
then lived, under the teaching of the schoolmaster. And now, though,
since the coming of Christ, our condition is more free; the memory of
the fact ought to be retained among us, that God disciplined his people
of old by external ceremonies.

tendon which fastens the hip-bone in its socket, which comprehends the

to be beaten, as the Jewish masters tell us.” — *Patrick*. See also
*Ainsworth* on this passage. *Professor* *Bush* says, “At present the
Jews do not know what sinew this was, nor even which thigh it was in;
and the effect of this uncertainty is, that they judge it necessary to
abstain from both the hind quarters, lest they should inadvertently eat
the interdicted sinew. They sell those parts to Christians.” — *Ed*.
