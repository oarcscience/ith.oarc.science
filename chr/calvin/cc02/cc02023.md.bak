<span id="xxiv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 46.

<span id="xxiv.i"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p1"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p1.1"></span>[Genesis
46:1-34](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#001.md)<span id="xxiv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p2"></span>**1** And Israel took his journey with all
that he had, and came to Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God
of his father Isaac.

<span id="xxiv.i-p3"></span>**1.** Itaque profects est Israel, et
quaecunque habebat, et venit in Beersebah, et sacrificavit sacrificia
Deo patris sui Ishac.

<span id="xxiv.i-p4"></span>**2** And God spake unto Israel in the
visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here *am* I.

<span id="xxiv.i-p5"></span>**2.** Et dixit Deus ad Israel in visi
onibus noctis, dixit inquam, Jahacob Jahacob. Ille respondit, Ecce,
adsum.

<span id="xxiv.i-p6"></span>**3** And he said, I *am* God, the God of
thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of
thee a great nation:

<span id="xxiv.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et dixit, Ego sum Deus, Deus patris
tui: ne timeas descendere in Aegyptum: quia in gentem magnam ponam to
ibi.

<span id="xxiv.i-p8"></span>**4** I will go down with thee into Egypt;
and I will also surely bring thee up *again*: and Joseph shall put his
hand upon thine eyes.

<span id="xxiv.i-p9"></span>**4.** Ego descendam tecum in Aegyptum, et
ego ascendere etiam to faciam ascendendo: Joseph quoque ponet manum suam
super oculos tuos.

<span id="xxiv.i-p10"></span>**5** And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and
the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones,
and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

<span id="xxiv.i-p11"></span>**5.** Postea surrexit Jahacob de
Beersebah, et sustulerunt filii Israel Jahacob patrem suum, et parvulos
suos, et uxores super currus, quos miserat Pharao ad ferendum eum.

<span id="xxiv.i-p12"></span>**6** And they took their cattle, and their
goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt,
Jacob, and all his seed with him:

<span id="xxiv.i-p13"></span>**6.** Et ceperunt pecudes suas, et
substantiam quam acquisierant in terra Chenaan: veneruntque in Aegyptum
Jahacob, et omne semen ejus cum ipso:

<span id="xxiv.i-p14"></span>**7** His sons, and his sons’ sons with
him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he
with him into Egypt.

<span id="xxiv.i-p15"></span>**7.** Eilii ejus, et filii filiorum ejus
cum eo, filiae ejus, et filiae filiorum ejus: et omne semen suum deduxit
secum in Aegyptum.

<span id="xxiv.i-p16"></span>**8** And these *are* the names of the
children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben,
Jacob’s firstborn.

<span id="xxiv.i-p17"></span>**8.** Haec sunt autem nomina filiorum
Israel, qui ingressi sunt in Aegyptum, Jahacob et filii ejus:
primogentus Jahacob, Reuben.

<span id="xxiv.i-p18"></span>**9** And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and
Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.

<span id="xxiv.i-p19"></span>**9.** Et filii Reuben, Hanoeh, et Phallu,
et Hesron, et Charmi.

<span id="xxiv.i-p20"></span>**10** And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and
Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a
Canaanitish woman.

Merari.

<span id="xxiv.i-p24"></span>**12** And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan,

Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.

<span id="xxiv.i-p25"></span>**12.** Filii Jehudah, Her, et Onam, et
Selah, et Peres, et Zerah: et mortuus est Her et Onam in terra Chenaan.
Fuerunt autem filii Peres, Hesron, et Hamul.

<span id="xxiv.i-p30"></span>**15** These *be* the sons of Leah, which
she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls
of his sons and his daughters *were* thirty and three.

<span id="xxiv.i-p31"></span>**15.** Isti sunt filii Leah, quos peperit
ipsi Jahacob in Padan Aram, et Dinah filiam ejus: emnes animae filiorum
ejus, et filiarum ejus fuerunt triginta et tres.

<span id="xxiv.i-p32"></span>**16** And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and

<span id="xxiv.i-p36"></span>**18** These *are* the sons of Zilpah, whom
Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, *even*
sixteen souls.

<span id="xxiv.i-p37"></span>**18.** Isti sunt filii Zilpah, quam dedit
Laban Leah filiae suae, et peperit istos ipsi Jahacob, sedecim animas.

<span id="xxiv.i-p38"></span>**19** The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife;
Joseph, and Benjamin.

<span id="xxiv.i-p39"></span>**19.** Filii Rachel uxoris Jahacob, Joseph
et Benjamin.

<span id="xxiv.i-p40"></span>**20** And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt
were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah
priest of On bare unto him.

<span id="xxiv.i-p41"></span>**20.** Nati sunt autem ipsi Joseph in

Arde.

<span id="xxiv.i-p44"></span>**22** These *are* the sons of Rachel,
which were born to Jacob: all the souls *were* fourteen.

<span id="xxiv.i-p45"></span>**22.** Isti sunt filii rachel qui nati
sunt ipsi Jahacob: omnes animae, quatuordecim.

<span id="xxiv.i-p46"></span>**23** And the sons of Dan; Hushim.

<span id="xxiv.i-p47"></span>**23.** Et filii Dan, Hussim.

<span id="xxiv.i-p48"></span>**24** And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel,
and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.

<span id="xxiv.i-p49"></span>**24.** Filii Nepthali, Jahseel, et Guni,

<span id="xxiv.i-p50"></span>**25** These *are* the sons of Bilhah,
which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto
Jacob: all the souls *were* seven.

<span id="xxiv.i-p51"></span>**25.** Isti sunt filii Bilhah, quam dedit
Laban Rachel filiae suae, et peperit istos ipsi Jahacob: omnes animae
septem.

<span id="xxiv.i-p52"></span>**26** All the souls that came with Jacob
into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives,
all the souls *were* threescore and six;

<span id="xxiv.i-p53"></span>**26.** Omnes animae, quae venerunt cum
Jahacob in Aegyptum, quae egressae sunt de femore ejus, praeter uxores
filiorum Jahacob, omnes, inquam, animae fuerunt sexaginta et sex.

<span id="xxiv.i-p54"></span>**27** And the sons of Joseph, which were
born him in Egypt, *were* two souls: all the souls of the house of
Jacob, which came into Egypt, *were* threescore and ten.

<span id="xxiv.i-p55"></span>**27.** Et filii Joseph, qui nati sunt ei
in Aegypto, animae duae. Omnes animae domus Jahacob, quae ingressae sunt
in Aegyptum, fuerunt septuaginta.

<span id="xxiv.i-p56"></span>**28** And he sent Judah before him unto
Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of
Goshen.

<span id="xxiv.i-p57"></span>**28.** Porro Jehudah misit ante se ad
Joseph ad praeparandum locum ante se in Gosen, et venerunt in terram
Gosen.

<span id="xxiv.i-p58"></span>**29** And Joseph made ready his chariot,
and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself
unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

<span id="xxiv.i-p59"></span>**29,** Et ligavit Joseph currum suum, et
ascendit in occursum Israel patris sui in Gosen: et conspectus est ei,
et jactavit se ad collum ejus, flevitque super collum ejus adhuc.

<span id="xxiv.i-p60"></span>**30** And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let
me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou *art* yet alive.

<span id="xxiv.i-p61"></span>**30.** Et dixit Israel ad Joseph, Moriar
hac vice, postquam vidi faciem tuam: adhuc enim tu vivis.

<span id="xxiv.i-p62"></span>**31** And Joseph said unto his brethren,
and unto his father’s house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say
unto him, My brethren, and my father’s house, which *were* in the land
of Canaan, are come unto me;

<span id="xxiv.i-p63"></span>**31.** Et dixit Joseph fratribus suis, et
domui patris svi, Ascendam, et nuntiabo Pharaoni: et dicam ei. Fratres
mei, et domus patris mei, qui erant in terram Chenaan, venerunt ad me.

<span id="xxiv.i-p64"></span>**32** And the men *are* shepherds, for
their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their
flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.

<span id="xxiv.i-p65"></span>**32.** Atque viri pastores pecudum sunt,
quia viri pecuarii sunt: et pecudes corum, et boves corum, et omnia quae
erant eis, adduxerunt.

<span id="xxiv.i-p66"></span>**33** And it shall come to pass, when
Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What *is* your occupation?

<span id="xxiv.i-p67"></span>**33.** Erit ergo quum vocaverit vos
Pharao, et dixerit, Quod est opus vestrum?

<span id="xxiv.i-p68"></span>**34** That ye shall say, Thy servants’
trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we,
*and* also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for
every shepherd *is* an abomination unto the Egyptians.

<span id="xxiv.i-p69"></span>**34.** Decetis, Viri pecuarii fuerunt
servi tui a pueritia nostra et usque nunc, etiam nos, etiam patres
nostri: ut habitetis in terra Gosen, quia abominatio Aegyptiis est omnis
pastor pecudum..

<span id="xxiv.i-p70"></span> 

<span id="xxiv.i-p71"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p71.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p72"></span>**1.** *And Israel took his journey*.
Because the holy man is compelled to leave the land of Canaan and to go
elsewhere, he offers, on his departure, a sacrifice to the Lord, for the
purpose of testifying that the covenant which God had made with his
fathers was confirmed and ratified to himself. For, though he was
accustomed to exercise himself in the external worship of God, there was
yet a special reason for this sacrifice. And, doubtless, he had then
peculiar need of support, lest his faith should fail: for he was about
to be deprived of the inheritance promised to him, and of the sight of
that land which was the type and the pledge of the heavenly country.
Might it not come into his mind that he had hitherto been deluded with a
vain hope? Therefore, by renewing the memory of the divine covenant, he
applies a suitable remedy against falling from the faith. For this
reason, he offers a sacrifice on the very boundaries of that land, as I
have just said; that we might know it to be something more than usual.
And he presents this worship to the God of his fathers, to testify that,
although he is departing from that land, into which Abraham had been
called; yet he does not thereby cut himself off from the God in whose
worship he had been educated. It was truly a remarkable proof of
constancy, that when cast out by famine into another region, so that he
might not even be permitted to sojourn in the land of which he was the
lawful lord; he yet retains, deeply impressed on his mind, the hope of
his hidden right. It was not without subjecting himself to odium that he
differed openly from other nations, by worshipping the God of his
fathers. But what profit was there in having a religion different from
all others? Seeing, then, that he does not repent of having worshipped
the God of his fathers, and that he now also perseveres in fear and
reverence towards him; we hence infer how deeply he was rooted in true
piety. By offering a sacrifice, he both increases his own strength, and
makes profession of his faith; because, although piety is not bound to
external symbols, yet he will not neglect those helps, the use of which
he has found to be, by no means, superfluous.

<span id="xxiv.i-p73"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p73.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p74"></span>**2.** *And God spake unto Israel*. In this
manner, God proves that the sacrifice of Jacob was acceptable to him,
and again stretches out his hand to ratify anew his covenant. The vision
by night availed for the purpose of giving greater dignity to the
oracle. Jacob indeed, inasmuch as he was docile and ready to yield
obedience to God, did not need to be impelled by force and terror; yet,
because he was a man encompassed with flesh, it was profitable for him
that he should be affected as with the glory of a present God, in order
that the word might penetrate more effectually into his heart. It is,
however, proper to recall to memory what I have said before, that the
word was joined with it; because a silent vision would have profited
little or nothing. We know that superstition eagerly snatches at mere
spectres; by which means it presents God in a form of its own. But since
no living image of God can exist without the word, whenever God has
*appeared* to his servants, he has also *spoken* to them. Wherefore, in
all outward signs, let us be ever attentive to his voice, if we would
not be deluded by the wiles of Satan. But if those visions, in which the
majesty of God shines, require to be animated by the word, then they who
obtrude signs, invented at the will of men, upon the Church, exhibit
nothing else than the empty pomps of a profane theater. Just as in the
Papacy, those things which are called sacraments, are lifeless phantoms
which draw away deluded souls from the true God. Let this mutual
connection, then, be observed, that the vision which gives greater
dignity to the word, precedes it; and that the word follows immediately,
as if it were the soul of the vision. And there is no question that this
was an appearance of the visible glory of God, which did not leave Jacob
in suspense and hesitation; but which, by removing his doubt, firmly
sustained him, so that he confidently embraced the oracle.

<span id="xxiv.i-p75"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p75.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p76"></span>**3.** *Jacob, Jacob*. The design of the
repetition was to render him more attentive. For, by thus familiarly
addressing him, God more gently insinuates himself into his mind: as, in
the Scripture, he kindly allures us, that he may prepare us to become
his disciples. The docility of the holy man appears hence, that as soon
as he is persuaded that God speaks, he replies that he is ready to
receive with reverence whatever may be spoken, to follow wheresoever he
may be called, and to undertake whatever may be commanded. Afterwards, a
promise is added, by which God confirms and revives the faith of his
servant. Whereas, the descent into Egypt was to him a sad event, he is
bidden to be of good and cheerful mind; inasmuch as the Lord would
always be his keeper, and after having increased him there to a great
nation, would bring him back again to the place, whence he now compelled
him to depart. And, indeed, Jacob’s chief consolation turned on this
point; that he should not perpetually wander up and down as an exile,
but should, at length, enjoy the expected inheritance. For, since the
possession of the land of Canaan was the token of the Divine favor, of
spiritual blessings, and of eternal felicity; if holy Jacob was
defrauded of this, it would have availed him little or nothing to have
riches, and all kinds of wealth and power heaped upon him, in Egypt. The
return promised him is not, however, to be understood of his own person,
but refers to his posterity. Now, as Jacob, relying on the promise, is
commanded boldly to go down into Egypt; so it is the duty of all the
pious, after his example, to derive such strength from the grace of God,
that they may gird themselves to obey his commands. The title by which
God here distinguishes himself, is attached to the former oracles which
Jacob had received by tradition from his fathers. For why does he not
rather call himself the Creator of heaven and earth, than the God of
Isaac or of Abraham, except for this reason, that the dominion over the
land of Canaan depends on the previous covenant, which he now ratifies
anew? At the same time also, he encourages his servant by examples drawn
from his own family, lest he should cease to proceed with constancy in
his calling. For, when he had seen that his father Isaac, and had heard
that his grandfather Abraham, though long surrounded by great troubles,
never gave way to any temptations, it ill became him to be overcome by
weariness in the same course; especially since, in the act of dying,
they handed their lamp to their posterity, and took diligent care to
leave the light of their faith to survive them in their family. In
short, Jacob is taught that he must not seek, in crooked and diverse
paths, that God whom he had learned, from his childhood, to regard as
the Ruler of the family of Abraham; provided it did not degenerate from
his piety. Moreover, we have elsewhere stated how far, in this respect,
the authority of the Fathers ought to prevail. For it was not the design
of God, either that Jacob should subject himself to men, or should
approve, without discrimination, whatever was handed down from his
ancestors, — seeing that he so often condemns in the Jews, a foolish
imitation of their fathers, — but his design was to keep Jacob in the
true knowledge of himself.

<span id="xxiv.i-p77"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p77.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p78"></span>**4.** *And Joseph shall put his hand upon
thine eyes*. This clause was added for the sake of showing greater
indulgence. For though Jacob, in desiring that, when he died, his eyes
should be closed by the hand of Joseph, showed that some infirmity of
the flesh was involved in the wish; yet God is willing to comply with
it, for the sake of moderating the grief of a fresh banishment.
Moreover, we know that the custom of closing the eyes was of the
greatest antiquity; and that this office was discharged by one most
closely connected with the deceased either by blood or affection.

<span id="xxiv.i-p79"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p79.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p80"></span>**5.** *And Jacob rose up*. By using the
words “rose up,” Moses seems to denote that Jacob received new vigor
from the vision. For although the former promises were not forgotten,
yet the addition of the recent memorial came most opportunely, in order
that he, bearing the land of Canaan in his heart, might endure his
absence from it with equanimity. When it is said that he took with him
all that he had acquired, or possessed in the land of Canaan, it is
probable that his servants and handmaids came together with his cattle.
 <span id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) But, on his departure, no
mention is made of them: nay, a little afterwards, when Moses enumerates
the separate heads of each tribe, he says that only seventy souls came
with him. Should any one say that Jacob had been compelled to liberate
his slaves, on account of the famine, or that he lost them through some
misfortune to us unknown, the conjecture is unsatisfactory; for it is
most incredible that he, who had been an industrious master of a family,
and had abounded in the earthly blessings of God, should have become so
entirely destitute, that not even one little servant remained to him. It
is more probable that, when the children of Israel were themselves
employed in servile works, they were then deprived of their servants in
Egypt; or, at least, a sufficient number was not left them, to inspire
them with confidence in any enterprise. And although, in the account of
their deliverance, Moses is silent respecting their servants, yet it may
be easily gathered from other passages, that they did not depart without
servants.

<span id="xxiv.i-p82"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p82.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p83"></span>**8.** *These are the names of the children
of Israel*. He recounts the sons and grandsons of Jacob, till he arrives
at their full number. The statement that there were but seventy souls,
while Stephen (<span id="xxiv.i-p83.1"></span>[Ac
7:14](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#014)<span id="xxiv.i-p83.1"></span>.md)
adds five more, is made, I doubt not, by an error of the transcribers.
For the solution of Augustine is weak, that Stephen, by a prolepsis,
enumerates also three who afterwards were born in Egypt; for he must
then have formed a far longer catalogue. Again, this interpretation is
repugnant to the design of the Holy Spirit, as we shall hereafter see:
because the subject here treated of, is not respecting the number of
children Jacob left behind him at his death, but respecting the number
of his family on the day when he went down into Egypt. He is said to
have brought with him, or to have found there, seventy souls born unto
him, in order that the comparison of this very small number, with that
immense multitude which the Lord afterwards led forth, might the more
fully illustrate His wonderful benediction. But that the error is to be
imputed to the transcribers, is hence apparent, that with the Greek
interpreters, it has crept only into one passage, while, elsewhere, they
agree with the Hebrew reckoning. And it was easy when numerals were
signified by marks, for one passage to be corrupted. I suspect also that
this happened from the following cause, that those who had to deal with
the Scripture were generally ignorant of the Hebrew language; so that,
conceiving the passage in the Acts to be vitiated, they rashly changed
the true number. If any one, however, chooses rather to suppose that
Luke in this instance accommodated himself to the rude and illiterate,
who were accustomed to the Greek version, I do not contend with them.
 <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) In the words of Moses there is,
indeed, no ambiguity, nor is there any reason why so small a matter, in
which there is no absurdity, should give us any trouble; for it is not
wonderful, that, in this mode of notation, one letter should have been
put in the place of another. It is more to the purpose, to examine
wherefore this small number of persons is recorded by Moses. For, the
more improbable it appears, that seventy men, in no lengthened space of
time, should have grown to such a multitude; so much the more clearly
does the grace of God shine forth. And this is also the reason why he so
frequently mentions this number. For it was, by no means, according to
human apprehension, a likely method of propagating the Church, that
Abraham should live childless even to old age; that, after the death of
Isaac, Jacob alone should remain; that he, being increased with a
moderate family, should be shut up in a corner of Egypt, and that there
an incredible number of people should spring up from this dry fountain.
 <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) When Moses declares that Shaul,
one of the sons of Simon, was born of a Canaanitish woman, while he does
not even mention the mothers of the other sons, his intention, I doubt
not, is to fix a mark of dishonor on his race. For the holy Fathers were
on their guard, not to mix in marriage with that nation, from which they
were separated by the decree of heaven. When Moses, having put down the
names of Leah’s sons, says there were thirty-three souls, whereas he has
only mentioned thirty-two; I understand that Jacob himself is to be
reckoned the first in order. The statement that he had so many sons or
daughters by Leah does not oppose this conclusion. For although,
strictly speaking, his discourse is concerning sons, yet he commences
with the head of the family. I reject the interpretation of the Hebrews,
who suppose Jochebed the mother of Moses to be included, as being
overstrained. A question suggests itself concerning the daughters,
whether there were more than two. If Dinah alone were named, it might be
said that express mention was made of her, because of the notorious fact
which had happened to her. But since Moses enumerates another female in
the progeny of Aser, I rather conjecture that these had remained
unmarried, or single; for no mention is made of those who were wives.

<span id="xxiv.i-p86"></span><span id="xxiv.i-p86.1"></span>

<span id="xxiv.i-p87"></span>**28.** *And he sent Judah before him unto
Joseph*. Because Goshen  <span id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) had
been selected by Joseph as the abode of his father and his brethren,
Jacob now desires, that, on his coming, he may find the place prepared
for him: for the expression which Moses uses, implies, not that he
requires a house to be built and furnished for him, but only that he may
be permitted there to pitch his tent without molestation. For it was
necessary that some unoccupied place should be assigned him; lest, by
taking possession of the pastures or fields of the inhabitants, he might
give them an occasion for exciting a tumult.

<span id="xxiv.i-p93"></span>In the meeting of Jacob with his son
Joseph, Moses describes their vehement feeling of joy, to show that the
holy Fathers were not destitute of natural affection. It must, however,
be remembered that, although the affections spring from good principles,
yet they always contract some evil, from the corrupt propensity of the
flesh; and have chiefly this fault, that they always exceed their
bounds: whence it follows, that they do not need to be eradicated, but
to be kept within due bounds.

<span id="xxiv.i-p95"></span>**31.** *I will go up and show Pharaoh*.
After Joseph had gone forth to meet his father for the purpose of doing
him honor, he also provides what will be useful for him. On this
account, he advises Jacob to declare that he and all his family were
keepers of cattle, to the end that he might obtain, from the king, a
dwelling-place for them, in the land of Goshen. Now although his
moderation deserves commendation on the ground, that he usurps no
authority to himself, but that, as one of the common people, he waits
the pleasure of the king: he yet may be thought craftily to have devised
a pretext, by which he might circumvent the king. We see what he
desired. Seeing that the land of Goshen was fertile, and celebrated for
its rich pastures; this advantage so allured his mind, that he wished to
fix his father there: but then, keeping out of Pharaoh’s sight the
richness of the land, he puts forth another reason; namely, that Jacob
with his sons, were men held in abomination, and that, therefore, he was
seeking a place of seclusion, in which they might dwell apart from the
Egyptians. It is not, however, very difficult to untie this knot. The
fertility of the land of Goshen was so fully known to the king, that no
room was left for fraud or calming, (though kings are often too profuse,
and foolishly waste much, because they know not what they grant,) yea,
Pharaoh, of his own accord, had offered them, unsolicited, the best and
choicest place in the kingdom. Therefore this bounty of his was not
elicited from him by stratagem; because he was free to form his own
judgment respecting what he would give. And truly Joseph, in order that
he might act modestly, felt it necessary to seek a habitation in Goshen,
on this pretext. For it would have been absurd, or at least
inconsiderate, for men who were obscure and strangers, to desire an
abode in the best and most convenient place for themselves, as if they
possessed a right to choose for themselves. Joseph, therefore, having
regard to his own modesty and that of his father, adduces another cause,
which was yet a true one. For seeing that the Egyptians held the
occupation of shepherds in abhorrence,  <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) he explains to the king that this
would be a suitable retreat for his brethren. Herein was no
dissimulation, because, in no other place, was a quiet habitation
accessible to them. Nevertheless, though it was hard for the holy
Fathers to be thus opprobriously rejected, and, as it were, to be
loathed by a whole nation; yet this ignominy with which they were
branded, was most profitable to themselves. For, had they been mingled
with the Egyptians, they might have been scattered far and wide; but
now, seeing that they are objects of detestation, and are thought
unworthy to be admitted to common society, they learn, in this state of
separation from others, to cherish more fervently mutual union between
themselves; and thus the body of the Church, which God had set apart
from the whole world, is not dispersed. So the Lord often permits us to
be despised or rejected by the world, that being liberated and cleansed
from its pollution, we may cultivate holiness. Finally, he does not
suffer us to be bound by chains to the earth, in order that we may be
borne upward to heaven.

<span id="xxiv.i-p81"></span> “A remarkable parallel to the description
of the arrival of Jacob’s family in Egypt, is furnished by a scene in a
tomb at Beni Hassan, representing strangers who arrive in Egypt. They
carry their goods with them upon asses. The first figure is an Egyptian
scribe, who presents an account of their arrival to a person in a
sitting posture, one of the principal officers of the reigning Pharaoh —
(compare the phrase, princes of Pharaoh, ver. 15.) The next, likewise an
Egyptian, ushers them into his presence, and two of the strangers
advance, bringing presents, the wild goat and the gazelle, probably as
production of their country. Four men with bows and clubs follow,
leading an ass, on which are two children in panniers, accompanied by a
boy and four women. Last, another ass laden and two men, one of whom
carries a bow and club, and the other a lyre, on which he plays with the
plectrum. All the men have beards, contrary to the custom of the
Egyptians,” etc. — Egypt and the Books of Moses, p. 40. It is supposed
by some that this sculpture was intended to represent the arrival of
Jacob and his family, recorded in this chapter. — *Ed*.

<span id="xxiv.i-p84"></span> Various methods have been resorted to, for
the purpose of accounting for the difference of numbers given in this
chapter and in <span id="xxiv.i-p84.1"></span>[Ac

It is true that Luke, after the Septuagint, says there were seventy-five
souls, whereas the Hebrew mentions only seventy. The reading of the
Septuagint is, “The sons of Joseph, who were with him in Egypt, were
nine souls; all of the souls of the house of Jacob which came with Jacob
into Egypt, where seventy-five souls.” Add then nine to the sixty-six,
mentioned in verse 26, and the number is made up. There is, however,
some difficulty to make out the nine. — See *Patrick*, *Poole*, *Bush*,
etc. in loc. — *Ed*.

<span id="xxiv.i-p85"></span> From the date of God’s promise of a holy
seed to Abraham, unto the birth of Isaac was twenty-five years. Isaac
lived sixty years before Jacob was born. Jacob had nearly reached the
age of eighty at the time of his marriage. So that about two hundred and
forty years elapsed before more than two persons were born of a family
which was to be as the stars of heaven, and as the sand on the
sea-shore, for multitude! — See *Bush* in loc. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[181](cc02023.htm#fr_180.md) <span

<span id="xxiv.i-p88"></span> Though Moses does not describe in express
ferms the position of the land of Goshen; yet the incidental allusions
contained in the narrative, are sufficient to fix its locality; and the
fact that those allusions are such as could only be made by a writer
conversant with its peculairities, affords decisive evidence of the
veracity of Moses as a writer of history.

<span id="xxiv.i-p89"></span>The land of Goshen appears as the eastern
border-land of Egypt; for on this side Jacob’s family entered, see <span
id="xxiv.i-p89.1"></span>[Ge
46:28](../../../bib/kjv/gen046.htm#028.md)<span id="xxiv.i-p89.1"></span>.

<span id="xxiv.i-p90"></span>It appears as lying near the chief city of
Egypt, (see <span id="xxiv.i-p90.1"></span>[Ge
45:10](../../../bib/kjv/gen045.htm#010)<span id="xxiv.i-p90.1"></span>..md)
What that city was, may be inferred from <span
id="xxiv.i-p90.2"></span>[Nu
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/num013.htm#022.md)<span id="xxiv.i-p90.2"></span>,
which points to Zoan or Tanis. This implies, that Zoan was one of the
oldest cities of Egypt, and that it held the first rank. God is said to
have performed his “wonders in the field of Zoan,” (<span
id="xxiv.i-p90.3"></span>[Ps. 78:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#012.md),
[43](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#043)<span id="xxiv.i-p90.3"></span>,.md)
alluding to the plagues of Egypt.

<span id="xxiv.i-p91"></span>The land of Goshen is described as pasture
land, and, As one of the most fruitful regions of Egypt.

<span id="xxiv.i-p92"></span>“All these circumstances harmonize, and the
different points, discrepant as they may seem, find their application,
when we fix upon the land of Goshen as the region east of the Tanitic
arm of the Nile, as far as the isthmus of Suez, or the border of the
Arabian desert.” — See Egypt and the Books of Moses, pp. 43-45. — *Ed*.

<span id="xxiv.i-p96"></span> “The monuments even now furnish abundant
evidence of this hatred of the Egyptians to shepherds. The artists of
Upper and Lower Egypt vie with each other in caricaturing them. In
proportion as the cultivation of the land was the more unconditionally
the foundation of the Egyptian state, the idea of coarseness and
barbarism was united with the idea of a shepherd among the Egyptians.” —
Egypt and the Books of Moses, p. 42. — *Ed*.
