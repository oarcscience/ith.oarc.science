<span id="xiii"></span>

<span id="xiii-p1"></span>A NOTICE OF THE  
ANCIENT VERSIONS AND CODEXES

<span id="xiii-p2"></span>WHICH CONTAIN  
EZEKIEL’S PROPHECIES.

<span id="xiii-p3"></span>**The Arabic Version Of Ezekiel**. It was made
from the Septuagint, and is contained in the London Polyglot,,. It
agrees throughout with that Greek text which exists in the Alexandrine
Codex, now in the British Museum. It was executed from Hesychius’s
edition of the Septuagint, and is valuable for the comparison of cognate
words and phrases with the Hebrew.

<span id="xiii-p4"></span>**The Chaldee Version**, said to have been
made by Jonathan, the son of Uzziel, is found in the London Polyglott,
and is praised in Buxtorf’s Rabbinical Commentaries.

<span id="xiii-p5"></span>**The Alexandrine Codex** is esteemed the most
ancient MS. existing, written probably in the fourth century, though
some authorities place it much later.  <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350.md) The book of Ezekiel was translated for
this version during the reign of Ptolemy Philometer. Of all the
prophets, Jeremiah seems the best executed: then Amos, and Ezekiel, and
Isaiah the worst of all, except Daniel. Edited by Jo. Ern. Grabe,
1707-1720. 4 vols. fol. Oxon.

<span id="xiii-p7"></span>**The Codices Of Kennicott And De Rossi**.
Only some of them contain Ezekiel; that formerly belonging to the
learned Reuchlin (No. 154) contains this Prophet, with a Targum also.
The Codex Norimburgensis, (No. 198,) written about A.D. 1290, is noticed
here only for the order in which Ezekiel is placed: it is neither that
of the Masorites nor the Talmudists. Again, in Codex No. 224, the order
is Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah.

<span id="xiii-p8"></span>**The Codex Romanus Or Vaticanus** is of great
antiquity. A facsimile of this MS. was made for Dr. Grabe in 1704, and
Horne has given an accurate specimen of Ezekiel, <span
id="xiii-p8.1"></span>[Eze 1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/eze001.htm#001.md)<span
id="xiii-p8.1"></span>. This facsimile is at long the MSS. of the
Bodleian Library. Cardinal Anton. Carasa executed an edition under the
auspices of Pope Sixtus V. Rome, 1587. Fol.

<span id="xiii-p9"></span>**The Syro. Estranghelae** Version is a
translation into Syriac of Origen’s Hexaplar edition of the Septuagint A
MS. exists in the Ambrosian Library at Milan. It contains Scholia of the
Greek and Syrian fathers, and various valuable annotations. Matth.
Norberg edited from it the Prophecies of Ezekiel and Jeremiah, in 1787,
4to, Londini Gothorum; giving it the title of <span
id="xiii-p9.1"></span>*Codex Syriaco-Hexaplaris
Ambrosiano-Mediolanensis*. See Eichhorn’s account of it in his Allgem.
Bib. der Bibl. Lit., volume 1 page 837, and foll.

<span id="xiii-p10"></span>**The Vulgate Version** needs mention here
only to point out the differences in rendering Ezekiel between the
editions of Sixtus 5. and Clement 8. In <span
id="xiii-p10.1"></span>[Eze 14:22](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#022.md)<span
id="xiii-p10.1"></span>, the former has <span
id="xiii-p10.2"></span>*egredientur*, which is correct, and the latter
<span id="xiii-p10.3"></span>*ingredientur*

<span id="xiii-p11"></span>**Among The Five Gothic Mss**. discovered by
Ang. Mai, in the Ambrosian Library at Milan, amidst the <span
id="xiii-p11.1"></span>Codices Rescripti, the homilies of Gregory the
Great on this Prophet were found written over various portions of St.
Paul’s Epistles. These homilies were executed before the eighth century.
