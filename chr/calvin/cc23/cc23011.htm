<p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref10"><a name="xii-p1"></A>A LIST OF THE CHIEF INTERPRETERS,<br> 		  ANCIENT AND MODERN.</p>  		
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld17"><a name="xii-p2"></A>1. Jewish Commentators.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p3"></A><b>Schelomoh Jarchi Ben Jizchak, </b>commonly called Solomon Jarchi, son of Isaac, known to the Jews by the word <i>Raschi</i>, made up of the initials of <a name="xii-p3.1"></A>&#1512;&#1489;&#1497; &#1513;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497;, <i>Rabbi Schelomoh Jarchi</i>, was an eminent commentator 		  on the whole of the Old Testament. the was born at Troyes, in Champagne, a province of France, and died A.D. 1180. His chief value arises from his having collected the best traditionary interpretations of his ancestors from the earliest times.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p4"></A><b>David Kimchi</b>, son of Joseph, known to the Jews by the name of <i>Radak</i>, from the initial letters of <a name="xii-p4.1"></A>&#1512;&#1489;&#1497; &#1491;&#1493;&#1512; &#1511;&#1502;&#1495;&#1497;, <i>Rabbi David Kimchi</i>, was a Spaniard. Though he lived so lately as the twelfth ten bury, his 		  interpretation is much valued by both Jews and. Christians for its grammatical accuracy. His commentary on Ezekiel is found in the Rabbinical Writings, edited by Buxtorf, A. D. 1618. Basil, 2 volumes.; and also 1724, Amsterdam.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p5"></A><b>Isaac Abarbanel</b>, a Portuguese Jew, born at Lisbon, A.D. 1437, and died in Apulia, A.D. 1508. His comments on Ezekiel appeared first at Pesaro, in Italy, A.D. 1520; and then again at Amsterdam, A.D. 1641. He is highly esteemed for his extensive erudition and his clear style.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p6"></A><b>Shelomoh Ben Melech</b>, a Spaniard, who lived at Constantinople in the middle of the sixteenth century. Under the title, <i>The Perfection of Beauty</i>, he wrote an elaborate commentary on the Old Testament, Constantinople, A.D. 1554, It was reprinted at Amsterdam, A.D. 1661 and 1685, fol., with the additions of Jacob Abendana. Tympius and Danzius have illustrated 		  the manner in which he has improved upon or misunderstood D. Kimchi, according to Wolf, Bibliothec. Hebr., volume 4 pages 989, 991.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p7"></A>These references to Jewish interpreters will enable the reader to judge how far their opinion on the sense of a passage is decisive. It must be remembered that they all lived more than a thousand years after the Christian era., and that consequently they are not to be esteemed of decisive authority.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p8"></A>Further information may be obtained from Jo. Christ. Wolf&#8217;s Bibliotheca Hebraee, volume 2, page 368, and elsewhere. Le Long and Boerner&#8217;s Bib. Sac. ab. A. G. Masch, pt. 1, p. 135; and De Rossi&#8217;s Annal. Hebrews Typ., Parmae, 1795, page 131; and Hartwell Horne, volume 2, part 2, where he has chiefly followed Carpzov.</p>  		
<p class="3rdLevelAllCap12Bld17"><a name="xii-p9"></A>2. The Early Fathers.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p10"></A><b>Origin </b>(between A.D. 185 and 254) appears to have commented very voluminously on Ezekiel, as, from the fragments which remain, it appears that the twentieth volume only reached to chap. 11. Jerome has translated fourteen homilies of Origen&#8217;s on Ezekiel into Latin, which are found in his works. <i>Edit</i>., Vallarsii, Venet. 1736, tom. 5 page 877; and in 		  <i>De La Rue&#8217;s</i> collected edition of Origen&#8217;s Works, volume 3, page 325.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p11"></A><b>Ephrem</b> of Edessa, who lived about A.D. 370, wrote a Commentary on this Prophet in Syriac, which is found in volume H of his works, as edited by Pet. Benedict, in Syriac and Latin, at Rome, 1740, fol.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p12"></A><b>Eusebius Hieronymus </b>&#8212; the well-known Jerome &#8212; wrote fourteen books of Comments on Ezekiel. See his works, edit. Martiani, volume 3, and Valarsii, volume 5 Rosenmuller esteems his interpretations highly, and often quotes them at length. Smith&#8217;s Biographical Dictionary, Art. Ineronymus, page 465, states, that the fourteen books of his Comments on this Prophet were written at intervals, between A.D. 411 and 		  414, having been commenced immediately after his Comments on Isaiah, but repeatedly broken off. See also the prolegomena to the 126th Epistle to Marcellinus, etc.; the Benedictine edition, volume 3, page 1072.</p>  		
<p><a name="xii-p13"></A><b>Theodoret</b>, Bishop of Cyrus, in Syria, who lived about A.D. 420, wrote a Commentary on Ezekiel, found in his works, edited by Jac. Sirmond, volume 2 page 300; and in the edit. Halen., volume 2 part 2.</p>

<p><a name="xii-p20"></A>This work is much praised and quoted by Rosenmuller. The first volume contains the Comments of Pradus on the first six-and-twenty chapters: he died before it was published; so that his coadjutor edited it, and compiled the two latter volumes. They had access to a <a name="xii-p20.1"></A><i>Catena Patrum Graecorum in Ezechielem</i>, preserved in the Vatican Library, which they inserted, translated into Latin by a 		  member of their own order; and they enriched their work with valuable illustrations of the city and temple at Jerusalem.
