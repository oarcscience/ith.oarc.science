<span id="viii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 19

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
19:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Moreover take you up a lamentation
for the princes of Israel,

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Et tu tolle lamentu  <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) super  <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) principes Israel,

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span>**2.** And say, What *is* thy mother? A
lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps among young
lions.

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span>**2.** Et dices, Quare mater vestra leaena
inter leones occubuit? in medio leonum educavit catulos suos.

<span id="viii.i-p8"></span>**3.** And she brought up one of her whelps:
it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured
men.

<span id="viii.i-p9"></span>**3.** Et sustulit unum e catulis suis, leo
factus est, et didicit praedari praedam, homines comedit.  <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md)

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span>**4.** The nations also heard of him; he
was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains unto the land
of Egypt.

<span id="viii.i-p12"></span>**4.** Et audierunt de ipso Gentes, in
fovea ipsarum captus est; et abduxerunt in cathenis in terram AEgypti.

<span id="viii.i-p13"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p14"></span><span id="viii.i-p14.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p15"></span>Here the Prophet, under the image of a
lion, informs us that whatever evils happened to the Israelites could
not be imputed to others. We must understand then his intention: it is
not surprising that the Spirit of God insists on a matter not very
obscure, since nothing is more obstinate than the pride of men,
especially when God chastises them, although they pretend to humility
and modesty, yet they swell with pride and are full of bitterness, and,
lastly, they can scarcely be induced to confess God to be just, and that
they deserve chastisement at his hand. For this reason, therefore,
Ezekiel confirms what we formerly saw, that the Jews were not afflicted
without deserving it. But he uses, as I have said, a simile taken from
lions. He calls *the nation itself a lioness*: for when he treats of the
mother of the people, we know that the offspring is considered. He says,
therefore, that the people was full of insolence. The comparison to a
lion is sometimes taken in a good sense, as when Moses uses it of the
tribe of Judea, as a lion’s whelp shall he lie down, (<span
id="viii.i-p15.1"></span>[Ge 49:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#009.md)<span
id="viii.i-p15.1"></span>,) a, phrase used in a good sense. But here
Ezekiel denotes cruelty, as if he had said that all the Jews were fierce
and savage beasts. For under the name of mother, as I said, he embraces
the whole nation. At the beginning he orders his Prophet to take up *a
mournful wailing*: for thus I interpret the word <span
id="viii.i-p15.2"></span>קינה, *kineh*, but there is in my judgment an
indirect opposition between this lamentation which God dictated to them
by his Prophet, and the common complaints which sounded constantly from
their tongues. For when their condition was not only ruinous, but
utterly deplorable, they made many groanings and bewailings. But at the
same time no one extended his thoughts beyond the pressure of present
evils they all exclaimed that they were wretched, but no one was anxious
to inquire why they were so or whence their miseries arose; nay, they
avoided this contemplation. The Prophet then indirectly reproves them,
by stating that this mournful complaint was suggested by God, but yet
was very different from that ordinary lamentation and howling in which
the Jews stopped at blind grief, and never inquired why God was so
hostile to them. *Take up*, therefore*, a lamentation*, says he,
*regarding* or against *the princes of Israel*. In this way God does not
excuse the people from blame, he only means that not only the common
people were lost, but the very flower of the nation and all who were
held in honor.

<span id="viii.i-p16"></span><span id="viii.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p17"></span>He says next, *that their mother lay down
among lions*, alluding to the people’s origin from lions, as we said
before, when the Prophet calls Judea the descendant of Canaan, and the
sister of Sodom and Samaria. When he now says, *their mother lay down
among lions*, he means that they were shamefully mixed with the
corruption of the Gentiles, so that they did not differ from them. But
God had chosen them as his peculiar people on the very condition of
being separate from all the filth of the Gentiles. There was, therefore,
a certain withdrawing of God’s favor *when the mother of the people lay
down among the lions,* that is, when they all promiscuously gave
themselves up to the perverse morals and superstitions of the Gentiles.
He says, *that she brought up whelps*, or young lions, which she
produced to these lions; since their origin was impure, being all
Abraham’s children, but, as I have said, a degenerate race. He
afterwards adds, *that the lion’s whelp*, or young lion, *grew up till
it became a lion: then it learnt to seize prey*, says he, and *to devour
men*. He refers to King Jehoahaz, son of Josiah, (<span
id="viii.i-p17.1"></span>[2Ki
23:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#030.md)<span
id="viii.i-p17.1"></span>:) but he had before asserted that the whole
people had a lion’s disposition, and that the princes, who were more
exalted, were like whelps. As only one lion is here brought forward, it
ought to be referred to the violence by which that wicked king
manifested his real disposition. But if it be asked whence the lion went
forth, the reply is, from amidst his brethren, for they were all lions’
whelps, or young lions. They could not administer the government either
together or singly, but each devoured his brother, and was devoted to
robbery and rapine. The king only, because freed from all fear, could
surpass the rest in rapine and robbery with impunity. We see, then, that
not only the king was here condemned, but that he becomes the type of
the whole nation; because, since no one could restrain his passions, he
could rob and devour mankind with unbridled freedom.

<span id="viii.i-p18"></span><span id="viii.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p19"></span>He afterwards adds, *that the nations had
heard, and were taken in their pit-fall.* Here Ezekiel states that
Jehoahaz was hurled from the royal throne, and taken captive by the
Egyptians, not only because God had beheld his cruelty, but because the
Gentiles had observed it; and it was notorious among them all. In this
way he signifies that the cruelty of King Jehoahaz was intolerable: and
he mentions him, since all the neighboring nations had heard of his
fame, and had conspired to destroy him; and so *he was taken in their
pit, and confined by chains, and led away into Egypt.* He means, as I
said, Jehoahaz, whom King Pharaoh-nechoh took captive. (<span
id="viii.i-p19.1"></span>[2 Kings
23:0](../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#000.md), [2 Chr.
36:0](../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#000)<span id="viii.i-p19.1"></span>..md)
For when he thought that the Egyptians were distracted by foreign wars,
he took the opportunity of collecting an army, and endeavored to seize
on certain neighboring cities. But Pharaoh, after he was disengaged from
other business, entered Judea, and since Jehoahaz was unable to resist,
he was taken. We now understand the Prophet’s meaning, namely, when this
first calamity and destruction happened to the Jews they were justly
chastised, because they were young lions; and a lion had sprung from
them whose cruelty was already intolerable to the profane Gentiles: this
is the sense of the passage. Now if we consider who was the father of
Jehoahaz this will be more detestable. For we know, that if ever any
king excelled in piety and every virtue, Josiah was among the number:
and from the son being so unlike his father, we perceive his perverse
disposition. There can be no doubt that his father desired to instruct
him in the fear and worship of God, and to train him to the discharge of
the royal office. But if we descend to the whole people, the prodigy
will be yet more detestable. For we know with what fervor and zeal
Josiah strove to form the morals of the people, so that the kingdom
should be entirely renewed. But the people soon declined, so that the
Holy Spirit says, *their mother was a lioness, and lay down among
lions*, whence we see their depraved nature. It now follows —

<span id="viii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#005.md)<span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>**5.** Now when she saw that she had
waited, *and* her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps,
*and* made him a young lion.

<span id="viii.ii-p3"></span>**5.** Et vidit quod sperasset, perdita
esset  <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) spes ejus: et sumpsit
unum ex catulis suis leonem constituit eum.  <span
id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md)

<span id="viii.ii-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.ii-p7"></span>I cannot proceed futher.

<span id="viii.iii"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="viii.iii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since we are all so
depraved by nature that we are not only most deserving of being cast
into the midst of lions, but are unworthy of being reckoned among thy
creatures, that you may extend thy hand to us, and manifest thy
wonderful power in reforming us; and may your image be so renewed in us,
that we may daily make more and more progress in true piety and
righteousness, until at length all the corruption’s of the flesh may be
abolished, and we may be partakers of that eternal glory which your
only-begotten Son has acquired for us. — Amen.

<span id="viii.iv"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p1"></span>Lecture Fifty-Ninth.

<span id="viii.iv-p2"></span><span id="viii.iv-p2.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p3"></span>We yesterday read over that sentence in
which the Prophet says that Judea produced another lion after the former
had been captured and led into Egypt. Now this ought to be referred to
King Jehoiakim, who was appointed by King Nebuchadnezzar, when he had
laid waste a part of Egypt, possessed the whole of Judea, and imposed
laws by establishing a king, according to the rights of conquest. But
since he also acted perfidiously, he was led away into captivity. The
Prophet, therefore, means that the nation did not repent through this
single chastisement; nor did it change its disposition, since its mother
was a lioness: and not only did it bring forth young lions, but taught
them to seize upon their prey till they became grown up. He says,
therefore, *that she saw what she had hoped, and her hope was futile*.
Some think that the noun “hope” is here repeated by the Prophet — she
saw that her hope was lost; lost hope, I say. But the other reading is
better — *she saw that she had hoped;* that is, she saw that her hope
had not produced any fruit for some time, because the royal throne
remained deserted; *therefore she took another of her whelps, says he,
and made him a lion*. The Prophet again briefly teaches that the whole
royal offspring was like young lions. Although, therefore, the lion
alone is called king, yet he is said to be taken from a number of
whelps; and hence it follows that this denotes the depraved and cruel
nature of all. Thus we see that the Jews are indirectly reproved for not
returning to soundness of mind, when God punished them severely, and
King Jehoahaz was taken. Since, therefore, that punishment did not
result in their correction, it follows that their dispositions were
depraved; and the Prophet means this when he says, *that she took one of
her whelps, and again made it a lion*. It follows —

<span id="viii.v"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p1"></span><span id="viii.v-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p2"></span>**6.** And he went up and down among the
lions, he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey, *and*
devoured. men.

<span id="viii.v-p3"></span>**6.** Et incessit in medio leonum, leo
fuit, et didicit praedari praedam,  <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) homines voravit.

<span id="viii.v-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.v-p6"></span><span id="viii.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p7"></span>Ezekiel confirms what I have already briefly
touched on, that this second lion was no less savage and cruel than the
former, of which he had spoken. As to the phrase, *he walked among
lions*, it means that his government was tyrannical, since there was
then such foul barbarity in those regions, that, kings were scarcely
human in their conduct. Since, therefore, kings were then everywhere
like lions, the Prophet says that Jehoiakim was not different from them,
but in every sense their ally. *He walked*, therefore, *he says, in the
midst of lions*, since he imitated their ferocity, which at length he
expresses more clearly, *that he became a lion, and was taught to seize
his prey*, so as to devour not only animals, but men, thus marking his
extreme cruelty. He afterwards adds —

<span id="viii.vi"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
19:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p2"></span>**7.** And he knew their desolate palaces,
and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the
fulness thereof, by the noise of his roaring.

<span id="viii.vi-p3"></span>**7.** Et contrivit,  <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) palatia ejus, et urbes eorum
destruxit, et redacta fuit in solitudinem terra, et plenitudo ejus a
voce rugitus illius.

<span id="viii.vi-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.vi-p6"></span><span id="viii.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p7"></span>He again confirms what he said of the
cruelty of King Jehoiakim: but the phrase is mixed, since he retains but
a part of the simile, and then speaks without a figure of palaces and
cities. Although interpreters incline to a different opinion, and
translate — and took notice of his widows: and if the remaining words
had suited, this reading would have been better; but I do not see how
things so different can be united, as destroying cities and noticing
widows. First, those who adopt this comment are obliged to adopt the
notion that Jehoiakim destroyed the men and deflowered their widows,
since he could not possess them in freedom till they were widows. Every
one will admit that this is far-fetched. But the word “afflict” suits
tolerably well. And truly the 53rd chapter of Isaiah, where Christ is
said to be bruised for our grieves, cannot be better explained, (<span
id="viii.vi-p7.1"></span>[Isa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003)<span id="viii.vi-p7.1"></span>..md)
Some translate, that he experienced sorrows, or knew them, or was
acquainted with them, in the passive signification. But those who say
that he saw sorrows, or experienced them, do not consider how it suits
the passage; and those who say that he was cognizant of grieves, meaning
his own, also distort the Prophet’s words. I doubt not, therefore, that
in this passage it means to afflict. Respecting the noun, I suppose the
letter, <span id="viii.vi-p7.2"></span>ל (*l*) taken for <span
id="viii.vi-p7.3"></span>ר (*r*); and in Isaiah (<span
id="viii.vi-p7.4"></span>[Isa
13:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#022)<span id="viii.vi-p7.4"></span>.md)
this word is used for palaces: wild beasts shall howl, says the Prophet,
<span id="viii.vi-p7.5"></span>באלמנותיו, *bal-meno-thiv*, that is, in
her palaces. The word cannot here mean widows, and all are agreed to
take it for palaces; and when the Prophet adds, *that he destroyed
cities*, the subject shows us that in the former clause the palaces were
afflicted, and then the cities destroyed: the Prophet asserts this
simply, and without a figure, though he soon returns to the simile,
*that the land was reduced to a desert by the voice of roaring*. Again,
he compares King Jehoiakim to a lion; whence it follows, as I said, that
the Prophet’s language is mixed. Elsewhere, also, the prophets reprove
the pride of their king. (<span id="viii.vi-p7.6"></span>[Jer
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer022.htm#015.md)<span id="viii.vi-p7.6"></span>;
<span id="viii.vi-p7.7"></span>[Jer
36:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer036.htm#030)<span id="viii.vi-p7.7"></span>..md)
For although he was contemptible, yet he raised himself above other
kings; hence he is derided, since he was not content with the condition
and moderation of his father, who ate and drank, — that is, lived like
mankind, — but he desired to raise himself above the race of men. For
this cause the Prophet now says, *that cities were destroyed by him, and
palaces afflicted by him*. There is a change of number in the pronouns,
because the singular number is put in the word “palaces,” and the plural
in cities. But we know how frequently this change occurs in the Hebrew
Language; while as to the sense there is no obscurity, for King
Jehoiakim was like a fierce and cruel beast, *because he destroyed
cities and pulled down palaces*. But afterwards he adds, *the land was
laid waste and made solitary by the voice of his roaring*. Here the
Prophet enlarges upon the atrocity of that king, since by his roaring
alone he had reduced the land to a desert. He does not speak of claws or
teeth, but says that they were all so frightened at the sound of his
roaring that the land was waste and solitary. He adds, *the fullness of
the land*, by which expression Scripture usually denotes the ornaments
of a country. The word comprehends trees, and fruits, and animals, as
well as inhabitants; for a land is empty and bare without that clothing;
that is, if trees and fruits are taken away as well as men and animals,
the face of the land is deserted and deformed, and its state displays
its emptiness. It afterwards follow: —

<span id="viii.vii"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p1"></span><span id="viii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#008.md)<span id="viii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p2"></span>**8.** Then the nations set against him on
every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him: he was in
taken in their pit.

<span id="viii.vii-p3"></span>**8.** Et posuerunt  <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) super eum gentes in circuitu, et
regionibus, et expanderunt super ipsum rete suum: in fovea ipsarum
captus est.

<span id="viii.vii-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.vii-p6"></span><span id="viii.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p7"></span>Since the word <span
id="viii.vii-p7.1"></span>נתן, *nethen*, is often taken for “to utter a
voice,” some explain this passage, that the nations came with great
clamor against King Jehoiakim, as when an attack is made against a wild
beast, the assailants mutually excite and encourage each other. They
understand it, that such a clamor was raised on all sides that they
rushed with one consent against King Jehoiakim. But since the same word
means “to put,” it may, in my opinion, be properly applied to counsel,
since they took counsel, that is, determined among themselves to take
him captive. The passive sense does not suit at all. Now, then, we
understand the Prophet’s meaning when he says, that *the Gentiles had
resolved against him,* that is, had conspired to take him. No doubt the
Chaldaeans were assisted by all their neighbors. First, we know that the
Jews were hated by other nations; then the audacity and rashness of this
king provoked many to send for the Babylonians, and eagerly to assist
them; and because they scarcely dared to engage in the war by
themselves, they conspired against King Jehoiakim under the protection
of others. Thus far concerning other nations, for this cannot, be meant
of the Chaldaeans alone; because, although they had other tribes under
their sway, yet that monarchy had devoured the Assyrians, whose people
made a portion of the Chaldaean army. Then the Prophet speaks of a
circuit, and says, that King Jehoiakim was shut in on all sides: hence
this must be ascribed to the neighboring nations, who not only favored
the Babylonians, but assisted them with troops and wealth, as is
sufficiently gathered from other passages.

<span id="viii.vii-p8"></span>At length he says, *they expanded their
net*, by which metaphor he means plans, desires, and efforts. For before
the neighboring nations openly declared war against the Jews, there is
no doubt that they took secret counsel as to the best way of attracting
the Chaldaeans to their side, and of insinuating themselves by various
arts, as if they were laying snares; although by the word *net* we may
also understand whatsoever apparatus they used for destroying King
Jehoiakim. In fine, he says that he was *taken in the pit of the
nations*, that is, was oppressed as well by snares as by open violence.
He uses the word *pitfall*, in accordance with the resemblance of the
king to a lion; but there is nothing absurd in extending the phrase to
any hostile violence by which Jehoiakim was oppressed. It follows —

<span id="viii.viii"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p1"></span><span id="viii.viii-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
19:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#009.md)<span id="viii.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p2"></span>**9.** And they put him in ward in
chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into
holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of
Israel.

<span id="viii.viii-p3"></span>**9.** Et posuerunt eum in clausuram
 <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) et adduxerunt in cathenis ad
regem Babylonis, deduxerunt in munitiones  <span
id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) ut non audiatur vox ejus amplius in
montibus Israel.

<span id="viii.viii-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.viii-p7"></span><span id="viii.viii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p8"></span>He pursues the same subject, saying that
King Jehoiakim, after being taken captive, was bound with fetters and
chains, adding, that he was brought to the king of Babylon; and thirdly,
was cast into prison. He shows, therefore, how severely God punished the
vicious obstinacy of that nation: for when King Jehoiakim was chastised,
it thought to have been enough to correct then; but since the people
were not improved by this, the severity was doubled; and here Ezekiel
says, *that King Jehoiakim was cast into a fortified dungeon*. He adds,
*that his voice*, that is, his roaring, *should be no longer heard in
the mountains of Israel.* For although he was reduced to straits,
through a great part of his kingdom being cut off, yet he did not desist
from his ferocity. The Prophet, therefore, sharply derides his
insolence, since he did not cease to cry out, and to roar even in the
mountains of Israel. It follows —

<span id="viii.ix"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p1"></span><span id="viii.ix-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
19:10-12](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#010.md)<span
id="viii.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p2"></span>**10.** Thy mother *is* like a vine in thy
blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful, and full of branches by
reason of many waters.

<span id="viii.ix-p3"></span>**10.** Mater tua tanquam vitis in sanguine
tuo super aquas plantata fuit: fructifera et ramosa  <span
id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) fuit ob aquas multas.

<span id="viii.ix-p5"></span>**11.** And she had strong rods for the
sceptres of them that bare rule, and her stature was exalted among the
thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her
branches.

<span id="viii.ix-p6"></span>**11.** Et fuerunt illi virgae roboris
 <span id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) ad sceptra dominantium: et
elevata fuit statura ejus supra,  <span
id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) et apparuit in altitudine sua, in
multitudine ramorum suorum.

<span id="viii.ix-p9"></span>**12.** But she was plucked up in fury, she
was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit: her
strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.

<span id="viii.ix-p10"></span>**12.** Et evulsa fuit in furore,  <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) terram projecta: et ventus Orientalis
arefecit fructum ejus discerpti sunt,  <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) et arefacti; virga robusta,  <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) ignis voravit eas.

<span id="viii.ix-p14"></span> 

<span id="viii.ix-p15"></span><span id="viii.ix-p15.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p16"></span>Here Ezekiel places before our eyes the
twofold state of the Jews, that they may acknowledge themselves fallen
into extreme misery, because they had provoked God. For they did not
sufficiently consider their present state, unless the former dignity and
happiness with which they were adorned was brought to their remembrance.
Now, in some way they had grown callous to all evils: although scarcely
anything remained safe but Jerusalem, they did not look back, but were
just as wanton as when their affairs were prosperous. Since they had not
yet been humbled by so many slaughters, the Prophet, therefore, on the
one hand, reminds them of their former condition, and then shows them
how they had fallen. This comparison, then, thought to prick their
consciences sharply, that they may at length feel that God was hostile
to them. We now understand the Prophet’s intention in saying, that *the
people’s mother was at first like a flourishing and fruit-bearing vine.*
It is not surprising that he says*, the vine was planted near the
waters*: for there the vines do not require lofty and dry situations, as
in cold climates, but rather seek their nourishment from water, as we
gather from many passages of Scripture. The Prophet, therefore, stays,
that the people at, the beginning was like a vine planted in a mild and
choice situation. He says, that *the vine was flourishing*, or
branching, *and fruitful*, since it drew its juices from the waters.

<span id="viii.ix-p17"></span>Respecting the word “blood,” I think those
who take it for vigor are mistaken; it rather refers to birth: he says,
*the mother of the people in her blood,* that is, in bringing forth the
people. Thus Ezekiel recalls the Jews to their first origin, as we
previously saw the word used in this sense. When you was in thy blood,
meaning, when you was born, as we know this to be the state of the young
offspring, as the metaphor was explained in the sixteenth chapter. Live
in thy blood, said God, (<span id="viii.ix-p17.1"></span>[Eze
16:6](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#006)<span id="viii.ix-p17.1"></span>,.md)
since the Jews were still defiled through not being cleansed from
pollution. In fine, blood is taken for birth, as if it had been said,
that the Jews, when first brought to light, were planted so as to take
root, since God led them into the land of Canaan. Here he says they were
brought to light when God restored them. He omits the intervening space
of time which we saw elsewhere, because he passes directly from the end
to the beginning. On the whole, he means that the Jews at their nativity
were placed in the land of Canaan, which was very fruitful, so that they
should bring forth their own fruit, that is, spend their time happily,
and enjoy an abundance of all things. Now we understand the meaning of
the phrase, *the mother of the people was planted near the waters, as a
flourishing and fruitful vine*

<span id="viii.ix-p18"></span><span id="viii.ix-p18.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p19"></span>He adds, *she had branches*, that is, vine
twigs, *for the scepters of those who bear rule*. Those who translate
with or above the scepters of rulers do not seem to me to comprehend the
Prophet’s meaning. I have no doubt he intends that scepters were
gathered from these vine branches, or rather that they were so formed as
to be like royal scepters. Although this translation seems rather rough,
yet the sense is not doubtful; because the Prophet means that kings were
taken from the people just as branches from the vine, as God chose
king’s from David to Zedekiah. In this sense he says *that the vine
branches became scepters of the rulers.* He afterwards adds*, her
stature was conspicuous, that she was remarkable for her loftiness even
in the multitude of the vine branches.* This is extended to the whole
body of the people. Since mention is made of the king, there is no doubt
that God commends his grace towards the whole people, whose safety and
happiness were placed in the king, as we saw elsewhere. But he asserts
more clearly that the people had increased, so that they excelled in
population, power, and wealth. On the whole, the Prophet teaches that
the Jews were adorned from the beginning with all kinds of advantages,
since God’s best gifts shone forth there, and their dignity was
conspicuous, and their opulence great, since he unites the *multitude of
the boughs* or vine branches with their height.

<span id="viii.ix-p20"></span><span id="viii.ix-p20.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p21"></span>Let us come now to the second clause. He
says *that the vine was torn away in wrath, thrown on the ground, and
dried by the east wind, and that its boughs were broken off and
withered, and consumed by fire.* I have now briefly explained the
Prophet’s meaning. As the Jews had grown stupid in their calamity, and
were not humbled so as suppliantly to fly to God’s mercy, the Prophet
corrects their torpor when he shows them their origin. He now says that
they were reduced to extreme wretchedness by a sudden assault; for a
change which took place in a short space of time ought to affect them to
the quick; but if they had been slowly diminished, the change had not
been so remarkable: but when the vine was struck by lightning, torn up,
withered, and burnt, that instantaneous slaughter, as I have said,
showed that it was not by chance, but by the evident wrath of God. For
this reason he says that *the vine was violently torn up, and cast upon
the ground*. If the vine had been dried up by degrees, it, would not
have been so wonderful; but its sudden tearing up ought to have made
them sensible of the wrath of God, towards which they had grown callous.
This is the reason why the Prophet adds one simile to another. The
plucking up would have been sufficient; but he adds, *it was cast upon
the ground*, that it should wither away completely. He adds, *the east
wind*, which destroys both fruits and trees, as is sufficiently evident
from many passages; and not only so, but he says that the boughs were
broken, or plucked off, *and withered*: lastly, *they were consumed with
fire* In fine, the hand of God appeared visibly in that horrible
slaughter of the people, when they were torn up, cut off, withered, and
burnt. It follows —

<span id="viii.x"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p1"></span><span id="viii.x-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
19:13](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#013.md)<span id="viii.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p2"></span>**13.** And now she *is* planted in the
wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.

<span id="viii.x-p3"></span>**13.** Et nunc plantata est in deserto, in
terra siccitatis et sitis.  <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md)

<span id="viii.x-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.x-p6"></span><span id="viii.x-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p7"></span>The Prophet seems here inconsistent with
himself, since these two clauses are openly at variance, that the vine
was not, only withered, but burnt up, and yet planted in a desert place;
for if it was withered, it could not take root again; but the burning
removed the slightest hope; for when the twigs were reduced to ashes,
who ever saw a vine spring up and grow from its ashes? But when the
Prophet says that the vine was *withered and burnt up,* he refers to the
conclusion which men must arrive at by their own senses when the city
was utterly ruined; for that was in truth a horrible spectacle, when the
people were made tributary after their king was taken, the temple,
plundered, the city ruined, and their safety dependent on the lust of
their conqueror. Since, therefore, neither the royal name and dignity,
nor freedom and security, remained, and especially when they were led to
the slaughter-house, was not their ruin very like a burning? Now,
therefore, we see why the Prophet said that the vine was torn and burnt
up, for that most severe destruction took away all hope of restoration
for a short time. Hence he spoke according to common sense: then he kept
in view that form of horrible ruin, or rather deformity, which was like
a burning and a final destruction of the people. But now, when he says
that the vine was planted again, he commends the mercy of God, who
wished some seed to remain for the production of young plants; as it is
said in the first chapter of Isaiah, Lest you should be in like Sodom
and Gomorrah, some small seed has been wonderfully preserved. Although,
therefore, the people were burnt up after being violently plucked up,
and all their lives subjected to the will of the proudest, of
conquerors, yet God took some twigs or vine branches, which he planted,
that he might propagate a new nation, which was done at the people’s
return.

<span id="viii.x-p8"></span>But he says *that those vine branches were
planted in the desert in the dry and thirsty land*, since God preserves
the religion of his people even in death. Hence he compares their exile
to a desert and a wilderness. It may seem absurd at first sight that,
Chaldaea should be likened to a desert, since that district we know to
be remarkable for its fertility and other advantages; we know, too, that
it was well watered, though called dry. But the Prophet here does not,
consider the material character of the country, but the condition of the
people in it. Although Chaldaea was most lovely, and full of all kinds
of fruits, yet, since the people were cruelly oppressed and
contemptuously treated, hence the land was called a desert. We say that
no prison is beautiful, so that their exile could not be agreeable to
the children of Israel; for they were ashamed of their life, and did not
dare to raise their eyes upwards. Since, then, they were drowned in a
deep abyss of evils, the land was to them a desert; hence there was no
splendor, dignity, or opulence; and liberty, the most precious of all
boons, was wrested from them. Now we see the sense of the words. It
follows at length —

<span id="viii.xi"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p1"></span><span id="viii.xi-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
19:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze019.htm#014.md)<span id="viii.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p2"></span>**14.** And fire is gone out of a rod of
her branches, *which* hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no
strong rod *to be* a sceptre to rule. This *is* a lamentation, and shall
be for a lamentation.

<span id="viii.xi-p3"></span>**14.** Et egressus est ignis a virga
ramorum ejus, fructum ejus voravit,  <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) et non fuit in ea virga fortitudinis,
 <span id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) sceptrum ad dominandum.
Lamentatio haec, et erit in lamentationem.

<span id="viii.xi-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xi-p7"></span><span id="viii.xi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p8"></span>Here the Prophet comes down to the close of
their woes, when Zedekiah was dragged into captivity, and so the
people’s independence was abolished. God had formerly planted that vine,
or at least some of the branches, in a desert spot, since first four
tribes, and afterwards seven, were led away, and last of all, the
greater part of the tribe of Judea; but the little that remained with
King Zedekiah perished. He says, therefore, *that the fire went forth
from the vine branches:* thus he shows that the last slaughter proceeded
only from the people themselves; and lest they should utter their
accustomed complaints, the Prophet meets them by saying that they were
consumed by intestine fire; that is, their slaughter could not be
ascribed to their Chaldaean conquerors, but to themselves; because King
Zedekiah, by his own perfidy, had stirred up the king of Babylon against
himself; for he might have spent his time in his kingdom, but he could
not refrain himself from throwing off the yoke; for this reason he armed
himself against the king of Babylon, because he was a breaker of
treaties: and thus the Prophet says, with propriety, *that a fire went
forth from one rod*, or twig of its branches, and hence *the fruit of
the whole vine was consumed;* that is, the remnant was lost by the fault
of that perfidious king. He now adds, there was no scepter for ruling
among its rods. Hence it appears that the exposition which I have
advanced suits best, and is entirely genuine. He said first that the
rods were for a scepter of the rulers; but he here says there was no
scepter for them among these rods. What follows we will treat tomorrow.

<span id="viii.xii"></span>

<span id="viii.xii-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="viii.xii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since you have once
deigned to insert us into the body of thy Son, that we may be such
vine-branches as you have undertaken to cultivate: that by the power of
thy Spirit we may be so watered as never to be deficient in spiritual
rigor: and may we so bear fruit to the glory of thy name, that we may at
length arrive at the fountain of our faith when we enjoy the celestial
glory to which you have adopted us in the same, your only-begotten

<span id="viii.xiii"></span>

<span id="viii.xiii-p1"></span>Lecture Sixtieth.

<span id="viii.xiii-p2"></span>Time did not permit us yesterday to
explain the words at the close of this nineteenth chapter: *this is a
lamentation, and it shall be a lamentation.* Some think this to be said
of the Jews, that is, of all the, Israelites, since they should all be
lamentable, because God would not cease to inflict his judgments upon
them until he had utterly consumed them. But I had rather refer it to
the prophecy, and this is the more correct sense *This lamentation*:
thus the Prophet designates this sad and mournful prophecy because it
contains the last slaughter of the people. Secondly, he adds, *it shall
be for a lamentation*, because it suggests material for wailing, since
remarkable miseries are accustomed to be more celebrated. If anything
usual occurs, men soon forget it; but if any slaughter happens worthy of
notice and of remembrance it is everywhere spread abroad, nay, it
supplies posterity with material for their poems. Hence the Prophet
signifies not only that this prophecy was mournful, but that God’s wrath
would fly about in common conversation through so rare and memorable an
example. I now come to the twentieth chapter.
