<span id="ii.xvi-p6"></span>**9. **But take heed to yourselves; for they
will deliver you up to councils and synagogues; you will be scourged and
will be brought before rulers and kings on my account, for a testimony
to them. **10. **And the gospel must first be preached among all
nations. **11. **And when they shall lead you away to deliver you up, do
not think beforehand what you shall say, nor premeditate, but whatever

but the Holy Ghost. **12. **And the brother will deliver up the brother

<span id="ii.xvi-p11"></span> 

<span id="ii.xvi-p12"></span><span id="ii.xvi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p13"></span>**<span id="ii.xvi-p13.2"></span>[Matthew
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#009.md)<span id="ii.xvi-p13.2"></span>.**
*Then will they deliver you up to be afflicted.* Christ now foretells to
the disciples another kind of temptation, by which, in addition to
ordinary afflictions, their faith must be tried; and that is, that they
*will be hated* and detested *by the whole world.* It is painful and
distressing enough in itself that the children of God should be
*afflicted* in such a manner as not to be distinguished from the
reprobate and the despisers of God, and should be subjected to the same
punishments which those men endure on account of their crimes; and it
appears to be still more unjust that they should be severely oppressed
by grievous calamities from which the ungodly are exempted. But as
wheat, after having been beaten by the flail along with the chaff, is
pressed down and bruised by the millstone, so God not only *afflicts*
his children in common with the ungodly, but subdues them by the cross
even beyond others, so that we might be apt to think them more unhappy
than the rest of mankind.

<span id="ii.xvi-p14"></span>But Christ treats here strictly of the
*afflictions* which the disciples had to endure on account of the
gospel. For, though what Paul stays is true, that those whom God hath
elected are likewise appointed by him to bear the cross,

<span id="ii.xvi-p15"></span>that they may be conformed to the image of
his Son,  
(<span id="ii.xvi-p15.2"></span>[Ro
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029)<span id="ii.xvi-p15.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="ii.xvi-p16"></span> yet he does not distinguish all by this
special Mark of enduring persecution from the enemies of the gospel. It
is of this species of the cross that Christ now speaks, when it becomes
necessary that believers should incur the hatred, meet the reproaches,
and provoke the fury, of the ungodly for the testimony of the gospel.
For he intended to warn his disciples that the doctrine of the gospel,
of which they were to be witnesses and messengers, would never be
pleasant or agreeable to the world, as he had formerly explained to
them. He foretells not only that they will have to contend with a few
enemies, but that, wherever they come, all nations will oppose them.

<span id="ii.xvi-p17"></span>But it was monstrous and incredible, and
was fitted to astonish and shake even the strongest minds, that the name
of the Son of God should be so infamous and hateful, that all who
professed it would be everywhere disliked. Accordingly, the words of
Mark are, *take heed to yourselves.* By this expression he points out
the end and use of the warning, which is, that they ought to be prepared
for endurance, lest, through want of caution, they might be overwhelmed
by temptation. The same Mark adds, that *this will be for a testimony to
kings and rulers,* when the disciples of Christ shall be brought before
their tribunal. Luke expresses it a little differently, *this will
happen to you for a testimony,* but the sense is quite the same; for
Christ means that his gospel will be so much the more fully attested,
when they have defended it at the risk of their lives.

<span id="ii.xvi-p18"></span>If the apostles had only given their
attention to preaching the gospel, and had not stood so firmly in
defending it against the furious attacks of enemies, the confirmation of
it would not have been so complete. But when they did not hesitate to
expose their lives, and were not driven from their purpose by any
terrors of death, their unshaken constancy made it manifest, how firmly
they were convinced of the goodness of their cause. It was therefore an
authentic seal of the gospel, when the apostles advanced without terror
to the tribunals of kings, and there made an open profession of the name
of Christ. Accordingly, Peter calls himself

<span id="ii.xvi-p19"></span>a witness of the sufferings of Christ,
(<span id="ii.xvi-p19.1"></span>[1Pe
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#001)<span id="ii.xvi-p19.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="ii.xvi-p20"></span> whose badges he wore; and Paul boasts that
he was

<span id="ii.xvi-p21"></span>placed for the defense of the gospel,
(<span id="ii.xvi-p21.1"></span>[Php
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#017)<span id="ii.xvi-p21.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xvi-p22"></span>This is eminently worthy of attention, that
those on whom God bestows so great an honor as to make them defenders of
his truth, may not through base treachery fall from the faith.

<span id="ii.xvi-p23"></span><span id="ii.xvi-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p24"></span>**<span id="ii.xvi-p24.2"></span>[Mark
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.xvi-p24.2"></span>.** *Neither premeditate.* This sentence, as
well as the one which immediately follows, we have explained  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) under <span
id="ii.xvi-p25.2"></span>[Mt
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#019.md)<span id="ii.xvi-p25.2"></span>
Our Lord’s design in these words is, to relieve the disciples from that
anxiety which interferes with the cheerful discharge of our duty, when
we doubt our inability to sustain the burden. Not that he wishes us to
fall asleep in indolent security, for nothing is more advantageous than
to have such a consciousness of our weakness as produces humility and
excites to prayer. But Christ advises us to cast all our cares into the
bosom of our Father, so that, relying on his promised aid, we may pursue
our course with cheerfulness. The promise is stated in different words
by Luke; not that Christ will deliver his people from death, (for this
must not always be expected,) but that *he will give them a mouth and
wisdom,* to confound their adversaries. Now though Christ supplies them
both with presence of mind and with ability to speak, yet I look upon
these two words as connected by that figure of speech which is called
*hypallage;* as if Christ had promised that he would guide their
tongues, so as to enable them to make a wise and suitable reply.

<span id="ii.xvi-p26"></span>He adds, that this *wisdom* will be
victorious against all their enemies, because *they will not be able to
contradict, or to oppose it.* Not that their impudence will yield the
palm to truth, but because that truth, which they in vain strive to
oppose, will triumph over their mad presumption. Would that all who are
called upon to make a confession of their faith would rely on that
assurance; for the power and majesty of the Spirit would be displayed in
a different manner for overthrowing the ministers of Satan. Now that we
are partly carried away by our own feelings, and, swelled with pride,
rush on heedlessly, or advance farther than is proper, and partly
confine ourselves within the limits of improper timidity, sad experience
shows that we are deprived of the grace of God and the assistance of the
Spirit. As Christ affirms, according to Matthew and Mark, that it is the
Spirit of the Father that speaketh in us, (<span
id="ii.xvi-p26.1"></span>[Mt
10:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#010.md)<span id="ii.xvi-p26.1"></span>;
<span id="ii.xvi-p26.2"></span>[Mr
13:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar013.htm#011)<span id="ii.xvi-p26.2"></span>,.md)
and here declares that *he will give a mouth,* we infer that it is His
prerogative to fortify us *by the Spirit.*

<span id="ii.xvi-p27"></span><span id="ii.xvi-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p28"></span>**<span id="ii.xvi-p28.2"></span>[Luke
21:19](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.xvi-p28.2"></span>.** *In your patience.* Here Christ enjoins on
his followers a different method of defending their life from what is
dictated by carnal reason. For naturally every man desires to place his
life in safety; we collect from every quarter those aids which we think
will be best, and avoid all danger; and, in short, we do not think that
we are alive, if we are not properly defended. But Christ prescribes to
us this defense of our life, that we should be always exposed to death,
and walk

<span id="ii.xvi-p29"></span>through fire, and water, and sword, (<span
id="ii.xvi-p29.1"></span>[Ps
66:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa066.htm#012)<span id="ii.xvi-p29.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xvi-p30"></span>And, indeed, no man will commit his soul
into the hands of God in a right manner, unless he have learned to live
from day to day constantly prepared to die.  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) In a word, Christ orders us *to
possess our life* both under the cross, and amidst the constant terrors
of death.

<span id="ii.xvi-p32"></span><span id="ii.xvi-p32.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p33"></span>**<span id="ii.xvi-p33.2"></span>[Matthew
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.xvi-p33.2"></span>.** *Then will many be offended.* He now
enumerates the temptations which will arise from bad examples. Now this
is an exceedingly violent temptation, and difficult to overcome; for
Christ is to many *a stone of offense,* (<span
id="ii.xvi-p33.3"></span>[1Pe 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.xvi-p33.3"></span>,) on which some dash themselves, or by meeting
which some are thrown back, and others fall away. In this expression
Christ appears to me to include many kinds of troubles; for not only do
they that had entered into the right course fall away, but many are
exasperated against Christ; others, forgetful of moderation and justice,
break out into rage; others grow profane, and lose every feeling of
piety; and others, amidst the confusion which prevails, take upon
themselves a liberty to commit crimes.

<span id="ii.xvi-p34"></span><span id="ii.xvi-p34.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p35"></span>**11.** *And many false prophets will
arise.* This warning differs from the former, in which Christ foretold
that *many would come in his name.* For there he spoke only of
impostors, who, shortly after the commencement of the Gospel, gave out
that they were *the Christ;* but now he threatens that in all ages false
teachers will arise, to corrupt sound doctrine, as Peter tells us (<span
id="ii.xvi-p35.1"></span>[2Pe 2:1](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.xvi-p35.1"></span>) that the Church will be no less exposed to
this evil under the Gospel than it anciently was under the Law. There is
therefore no reason why error, and certain impostures of the devil and
corruptions of piety, should strike pious minds with dismay; since no
man is properly founded on Christ, who has not learned that we must
stand firm against such attacks; for this is the undoubted trial of our
faith, when it is in no degree shaken by the false doctrines which
arise, or does he only say that *false prophets will come,* but likewise
that they will be so crafty as to *deceive* and draw away sects after
them.  <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) No ordinary caution is
necessary here; for the multitude of those who are going astray is like
a violent tempest, which compels us to leave the course, if we are not
firmly fixed on God. On this subject something was said but lately.

<span id="ii.xvi-p37"></span><span id="ii.xvi-p37.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p38"></span>**12** *Because iniquity will abound.* How
far and wide this evil extends every person ought to know, but there are
very few who observe it. For in consequence of the superior clearness
with which the light of the gospel discovers the malice of men, even
good and properly regulated minds *grow cool,* and almost lose the
desire to exercise benevolence. Each of them reasons thus with himself,
that the duties which they perform to one person, or to another, are
thrown away, because experience and daily practice show that almost all
are ungrateful, or treacherous, or wicked. This is unquestionably a
weighty and dangerous temptation; for what could be more unreasonable
than to approve of a doctrine, by which the desire of doing good, and
the rigor of charity, appear to be diminished? And yet when the gospel
makes its appearance, charity, which ought to kindle the hearts of all
men with its warmth, rather *grows cool.* But we must observe the source
of this evil, which Christ points out, namely, that many lose courage,
because through their weakness they are unable to stem the flood of
iniquity which flows on every hand. Christ requires from his followers,
on the other hand, such courage as to persist in striving against it; as
Paul also enjoins us *not to be weary* of performing deeds of kindness
and beneficence, (<span id="ii.xvi-p38.1"></span>[2Th
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#013)<span id="ii.xvi-p38.1"></span>..md)
Although, then, the charity of many, overwhelmed by the mass of
iniquities, should give way, Christ warns believers that they must
surmount this obstacle, lest, overcome by bad examples, they apostatize.
And therefore he repeats the statement, that no man can be saved,
*unless he strive lawfully,* (<span id="ii.xvi-p38.2"></span>[2Ti
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#005)<span id="ii.xvi-p38.2"></span>,.md)
so as to *persevere to the end*

<span id="ii.xvi-p39"></span><span id="ii.xvi-p39.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xvi-p40"></span>**14.** *And the gospel of the kingdom will
be preached throughout the whole world.* Our Lord, having delivered a
discourse which gave no small occasion for sorrow, seasonably adds this
consolation, to raise up minds that were cast down, or to uphold those
which were falling. Whatever may be the contrivances of Satan, and how
numerous soever may be the multitudes which he carries away, yet *the
gospel* will maintain its ground till it be spread *through the whole
world.* This might indeed appear to be incredible; but it was the duty
of the apostles, relying on this testimony of their Master, to cherish
hope against hope, and, in the meantime, to strive vigorously to
discharge their office. As to the objection brought by some, that to
this day not even the slightest report concerning Christ has reached the
*Antipodes* and other very distant nations, this difficulty may be
speedily resolved; for Christ does not absolutely refer to every portion
of the world, and does not fix a particular time, but only affirms that
*the gospel*—which, all would have thought, was immediately to be
banished from Judea, its native habitation would be spread to the
farthest bounds of the world before the day of his last coming.

<span id="ii.xvi-p41"></span>*For a testimony to all nations.* He
describes this to be the end of preaching; for although

<span id="ii.xvi-p42"></span>God has never left himself (<span
id="ii.xvi-p42.1"></span>ἀμάρτυρον) without witness,  
(<span id="ii.xvi-p42.3"></span>[Ac
14:17](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#017)<span id="ii.xvi-p42.3"></span>,.md)

<span id="ii.xvi-p43"></span>and although in special manner he testified
to the Jews concerning himself, yet it was *a testimony* remarkable
beyond all others when he revealed himself in Christ; and therefore Paul
says, that he was *manifested in due time,* (<span
id="ii.xvi-p43.1"></span>[1Ti 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.xvi-p43.1"></span>,) because this was the proper season for
calling the whole world to God. Let us, therefore, learn that, wherever
the gospel is preached, it is as if God himself came into the midst of
us, and solemnly and expressly besought us, that we may not wander in
darkness, as if we knew not where to go, and that those who refuse to
obey may be rendered inexcusable.

<span id="ii.xvi-p44"></span>*And then will the end come.* This is
improperly restricted by some to the destruction of the temple, and the
abolition of the service of the Law; for it ought to be understood as
referring to *the end* and renovation of the world. Those two things
having been blended by the disciples, as if the temple could not be
overthrown without the destruction of *the whole world,* Christ, in
replying to the whole question which had been put to him, reminded them
that a long and melancholy succession of calamities was at hand, and
that they must not hasten to seize the prize, before they had passed
through many contests and dangers. In this manner, therefore, we ought
to explain this latter clause: “The end of the world will not come
before I have tried my Church, for a long period, by severe and painful
temptations,” for it is contrasted with the false imagination which the
apostles had formed in their minds. Hence, too, we ought to learn that
no particular time is here fixed, as if the last day were to follow in
immediate succession those events which were just now foretold; for the
believers long ago experienced the fulfillment of those predictions
which we have now examined, and yet Christ did not immediately appear.
But Christ had no other design than to restrain the apostles, who were
disposed to fly with excessive eagerness to the possession of the
heavenly glory, and to show them the necessity of patience; as if he had
said, that redemption was not so close at hand as they had imagined it
to be, but that they must pass through long windings.
