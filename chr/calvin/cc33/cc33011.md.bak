<span id="ii.x-p12"></span>**47. **Who devour widows’ houses, and by way
of pretence make long prayers  <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md)
. These shall receive greater condemnation.

<span id="ii.x-p14"></span> 

<span id="ii.x-p15"></span>He breaks out into still stronger language of
condemnation, and he does so not so much on their account, as for the
purpose of withdrawing the common people and simple-minded men from
their sect.  <span id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) For though we see
frequently in Scripture the judgment of God pronounced against the
reprobate, so as to render them the more inexcusable, yet in their
person the children of God receive a useful warning, not to involve
themselves in the snares of the same crimes, but to guard against
falling into similar destruction. Certainly, when the scribes, after
overturning the worship of God and corrupting the doctrine of godliness,
would endure no correction, and with desperate madness, to their own
destruction and that of the whole nation, opposed the redemption which
was offered to them, it was proper that they should be held up to the
hatred and detestation of all. And yet Christ did not so much consider
what they deserved, as what would be useful to the uneducated and
ignorant; for he intended, towards the close of his life, to leave a
solemn testimony, that no man might, except knowingly and willingly, be
deceived by persons so base and wicked.

<span id="ii.x-p17"></span>We know how powerfully a foolish reverence
for false teachers hinders simple people from getting clear of their
erroneous views. The Jews were at that time deeply imbued with false
doctrine, and had even imbibed from their earliest years many
superstitions. While it was hard and difficult in itself to bring them
back to the right path, the chief obstacle lay in the foolish opinion
which they had formed about the false teachers, whom they regarded as
the lawful prelates of the Church, the rulers of divine worship, and the
pillars of religion. Besides, they were so strongly fascinated, that
they could scarcely be drawn away from those teachers but by violent
fear. It is not therefore for the purpose of cursing the scribes that
Christ pronounces against them the dreadful vengeance of God, but to
withdraw others from their impostures. In like manner, we are compelled
at the present day to thunder loudly against the Popish clergy, for no
other reason than that those who are tractable, and not quite desperate,
may direct their minds to their salvation, and, moved by the judgment of
God, may break the deadly snares of superstitions by which they are held
captive.

<span id="ii.x-p18"></span>Hence we may infer how cruel is the mildness
of those who dislike our vehemence. They are displeased to see harshness
and severity used towards the wolves, which are constantly, with open
mouth, tearing and devouring the sheep; and yet they see the poor sheep
deceived by a vain disguise, freely throwing themselves into the jaws of
the wolves, unless the pastor who desires to save them, and endeavors to
rescue them from destruction, drive them away with a loud voice. We must
therefore follow out the design of Christ, by copying out his example in
severe threatenings against wicked despisers, and in boldly exclaiming
against them, that those who are capable of being cured may be led by
the fear of destruction to withdraw from them. For though we gain
nothing by addressing the enemies of the truth, yet they must be
summoned to the judgment-seat of God, and others must be warned, that
they may know that the same destruction awaits themselves, if they do
not speedily withdraw from a wicked league with them.

<span id="ii.x-p19"></span><span id="ii.x-p19.1"></span>

<span id="ii.x-p20"></span>**<span id="ii.x-p20.2"></span>[Matthew
23:13](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#013.md)<span id="ii.x-p20.2"></span>.**
*You shut up the kingdom of heaven.* Christ pronounces a curse on them,
because they pervert their office to the general destruction of the
whole people; for since the government of the Church was in their hands,
they ought to have been, as it were, *porters* for *the kingdom of
heaven.* What purpose is served by religion and holy doctrine but to
open heaven to us? For we know that all mankind are banished from God,
and excluded from the inheritance of eternal salvation. Now the doctrine
of religion may be said to be the door by which we enter into life, and
therefore Scripture says metaphorically, that the keys of the kingdom of
heaven are given to pastors, as I have explained more fully under <span
id="ii.x-p20.3"></span>[Mt 16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.x-p20.3"></span>. And we ought to abide by this definition, which
appears still more strongly from the words of Luke, in which Christ
reproaches the *lawyers* with *having taken away the key of knowledge,*
which means that, though they were the guardians of the Law of God, they
deprived the people of the true understanding of it. As, therefore, in
the present day, *the keys of the kingdom of heaven* are committed to
the custody of pastors, that they may admit believers into eternal life,
and exclude unbelievers from all expectation of it, so the priests and
scribes anciently under the Law held the same office.

<span id="ii.x-p21"></span>From the word *knowledge* we infer how
absurdly the Papists forge false *keys,* as if they possessed some
magical power apart from the word of God; for Christ declares that none
but those who are ministers of doctrine have the use of *keys.* If it be
objected, that the Pharisees, though they were perverse expounders of
the Law still held *the keys,* I reply: Though, in respect of their
office, *the keys* were entrusted to them, yet they were suppressed by
malice and deceit, so that they no longer retained the use of them. And
therefore Christ says, that they *took away,* or *stole* that *key of
knowledge,* by which they ought to have opened the gate of *heaven.* In
like manner, *heaven* is *shut* by Popery against the wretched people,
while the very pastors—or, at least, those who hold that office—prevent
them by their tyranny from being opened. If we are not excessively
indifferent, we will not willingly enter into a league with wicked
tyrants, who cruelly *shut* against us the entrance into life.

<span id="ii.x-p22"></span><span id="ii.x-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ii.x-p23"></span>**14.** *For you devour widows’ houses.* He
now proceeds farther, for he not only accuses them of open crimes which
demand hatred and detestation, but even tears away the disguises of
virtues, by which they deceived the common people. If it be objected,
that there was no need of reproving those things which could do no harm
by their example, we ought to recollect that it was impossible to
promote the salvation of those who were held bound by the errors of the
scribes, unless they turned away entirely from such persons. This
reason, therefore, constrained Christ to expose the vain appearance of
virtues, which nourishes superstitions.

<span id="ii.x-p24"></span>*And that under the pretense of a long
prayer. He* says in general that, even when they appear to do what is
right, they wickedly abuse the pretense of religion. *Long prayers*
contained some evidence of remarkable piety; for the more holy a man is,
the more eminently is he devoted to prayer. But Christ says that the
*Pharisees* and *scribes* were so impure, that even the chief part of
the worship of God was not used by them without committing sin, because
constancy in *prayer* was with them, trap for base gain. For they sold
their prayers in exactly the same manner as hirelings dispose of their
daily labor.  <span id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) Hence also we infer
that our Lord does not exactly reprove *long prayers,* as if in itself
it were an impropriety—particularly since pastors ought to be eminently
devoted to *prayer*—but to condemn this abuse, because a thing laudable
in itself was turned to a wicked purpose. For when men aim at gain by
means of hired prayers, the more fervent the appearance of what they
call *devotion* becomes, the more is the name of God profaned. And as
this false conviction had been long and deeply seated in the minds of
the common people, on this account Christ employs harsher threatenings;
for the pollution of so sacred a thing was no light offense. That it was
chiefly *widows* that were imposed on need not excite surprise, because
silly women are more prone to superstition, and therefore it has always
been customary for base men to make gain of. them. Thus Paul brings a
charge against the false teachers of his age, that they

<span id="ii.x-p26"></span>lead captive silly women laden with sins,
(<span id="ii.x-p26.1"></span>[2Ti
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#006)<span id="ii.x-p26.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.x-p27"></span><span id="ii.x-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ii.x-p28"></span>**15.** *For* *you compass sea and land.* The
*scribes* had also acquired celebrity by their zeal in laboring to bring
over to the Jewish religion the strangers and uncircumcised. And so, if
they had gained any one by their false appearances, or by any other
stratagem, they gloried wonderfully over it as an increase of the
Church. On this account also they received great applause from the
common people, that by their diligence and ability they brought
strangers into the Church of God. Christ declares, on the contrary, that
so far is this zeal from deserving applause, that they more and more
provoke the vengeance of God, because they bring under heavier
condemnation those who devote themselves to their sect. We ought to
observe how corrupt their condition at that time was, and what confusion
existed in religion; for as it was a holy and excellent work to gain
disciples to God, so to allure the Gentiles to the Jewish worship—which
was at that time degenerate, and was even full of wicked profanation —
was nothing else than to hurry them from Scylla to Charybdis.  <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) Besides, by a sacrilegious abuse of the
name of God, they drew down upon themselves a heavier condemnation,
because their religion allowed them grosser licentiousness of crime. An
instance of the same kind may be seen at the present day among the
monks; for they are diligent in culling proselytes from every quarter,
but those proselytes, from being lascivious and debauched persons, they
render altogether devils: for such is the filthiness of those puddles,
within which they carry on their reveling, that it would corrupt even
the heavenly angels.  <span id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) Yet the
monk’s habit is a very suitable mantle for concealing enormities of
every description.

rocky promontory on the Italian side of the Strait of Messina, and to
Charybdis, a whirlpool opposite to it, on the coast of Sicily. Either of
them singly would have rendered the navigation formidable, but their
vicinity to ly aggravated the danger; for the very exertions which kept
the mariner at a distance from the one unavoidably brought him nearer to
the other. This appalling scene meets us frequently in the ancient
mythology, in the allusions of poets and orators, and on many other
occasions. He who, by avoiding one evil, fell into one still greater,
was proverbially said to have avoided Scylla and fallen into Charybdis.
