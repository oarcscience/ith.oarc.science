<span id="ii.xxxvi-p5"></span>**1. **But when it was morning, all the
chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, to
put him to death. **2. **And they led him away bound, and delivered him
to Pointius Pilate the governor. **3. **Then Judas, who had betrayed
him, perceiving that he was condemned, repented, and brought back the
thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, **4. **Saying,
I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said, What is that
to us? see thou to that. **5. **And having thrown down the pieces of
silver in the temple, he retired, and went away, and strangled himself.
**6. **And the chief priests, having taken the pieces of silver, said,
It is not lawful for us to throw them into the treasury, for they are
the price of blood. **7. **And having taken counsel, they bought with
them the potter’s field for a burying-place to strangers; **8. **For
which reason that field is called, The field of blood, to this day.
**9. **Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet,
saying, And they took thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was
valued, whom they of the children of Israel valued, **10. **And gave
them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p6"></span>**1. **And immediately on the break of
day, the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole
council, after having deliberated, led Jesus away bound and delivered
him to Pilate.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p7"></span>**1. **And the whole multitude of them
arose, and led him away to Pilate.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p8"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p9"></span><span id="ii.xxxvi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p10"></span>**<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p10.2"></span>[Matthew
27:1](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p10.2"></span>.** *But when it was morning.* The high
priest, with his council, after having examined him at an unseasonable
hour of the night, finally resolve, at sunrise, to place him at the bar
of the governor. By so doing, they observe the form of judicial
proceedings, that they may not be suspected of undue haste, when they
run to Pilate at an unusually early hour, as usually happens in cases of
tumult. But it is probable, that when Christ had been led away from
their council, they immediately held a consultation, and, without long
delay, resolved what they would do; for we have been already told at
what time Christ went out from them and met Peter, which was after the
*cock-crowing,* and just as day was breaking. The Evangelists,
therefore, do not mean that they removed from the place,  <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) but only relate, that as soon as it
was daylight, they condemned Christ to death, and did not lose a moment
in earnestly putting into execution their wicked design. What Luke
formerly stated, (<span id="ii.xxxvi-p11.2"></span>[Lu
22:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p11.2"></span>,) that *they assembled in the morning,*
ought not to be explained as referring to the very beginning, but to the
last act, which is immediately added: as if he had said, that as soon as
it was day, our Lord having acknowledged that he was the Son of God,
they pronounced their sentence of his death. Now if they had been
permitted to decide in taking away life, they would all have been eager,
in their fury, to murder him with their own hands; but as Pilate had
cognizance of capital crimes, they are constrained to refer the matter
to his jurisdiction; only they entangle him by their own previous
decision.  <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md) For the stoning of
Stephen (<span id="ii.xxxvi-p12.2"></span>[Ac
7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059)<span id="ii.xxxvi-p12.2"></span>.md)
took place in a seditious manner, as happens in cases of tumult; but it
was proper that the Son of God should be solemnly condemned by an
earthly judge, that he might efface our condemnation in heaven.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p13"></span><span id="ii.xxxvi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p14"></span>**3.** *Then Judas, perceiving that he
was condemned.* By this adverb (<span id="ii.xxxvi-p14.1"></span>τότε)
*then,* Matthew does not fix the exact point of time; for we shall find
him shortly afterwards adding, that Judas, when he saw that the priests
disdainfully refused to take back the reward of his treason, threw it
down in the temple. But from the house of Caiaphas they came straight to
the Pretorium, and stood there until Christ was condemned. It can
scarcely be supposed that they were found in the temple on that day; but
as the Evangelist was speaking of the rage and madness of the council,
he inserted also the death of Judas, by which their blind obstinacy, and
the hardness of their hearts like iron, were more fully displayed.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p15"></span>He says that Judas *repented;* not that
he reformed, but that the crime which he had committed gave him
uneasiness; as God frequently opens the eyes of the reprobate, so as to
begin to feel their miseries, and to be alarmed at them. For those who
are sincerely grieved so as to reform, are said not only (<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p15.1"></span>μεταμελεῖν),  <span
id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md) but, also (<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p16.9"></span>μετανοεῖν),  <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) from which is derived also (<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p17.9"></span>μετάνοια),  <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md) which is a true conversion of the soul
to God. So then, Judas conceived disgust and horror, not so as to turn
to God, but rather that, being overwhelmed with despair, he might serve
as an example of a man entirely shut out from the grace of God. Justly,
indeed, does Paul say, that the sorrow which leads to repentance is
salutary, (<span id="ii.xxxvi-p18.9"></span>[2Co
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p18.9"></span>;) but if a man stumble at the very
threshold, he will derive no advantage from a confused and mistaken
grief. What is more, this is a just punishment with which God at length
visits the wicked, who have obstinately despised his judgment, that he
gives them up to Satan to be tormented without the hope of consolation.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p19"></span>True repentance is displeasure at sin,
arising out of fear and reverence for God, and producing, at the same
time, a love and desire of righteousness. Wicked men are far from such a
feeling; for they would desire to sin without intermission, and even, as
far as lies in their power, they endeavor to deceive both God and their
own conscience,  <span id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) but
notwithstanding their reluctance and opposition, they are tormented with
blind horror by their conscience, so that, though they do not hate their
sin, still they feel, with sorrow and distress, that it presses heavily
and painfully upon them. This is the reason why their grief is useless;
for they do not cheerfully turn to God, or even aim at doing better,
but, being attached to their wicked desires, they pine away in torment,
which they cannot escape. In this way, as I have just said, God punishes
their obstinacy; for although his elect are drawn to him by severe
chastisements, and as it were contrary to their will, yet he heals in
due time the wounds which he has inflicted, so that they come cheerfully
to him, by whose hand they acknowledge that they are struck, and by
whose wrath they are alarmed. The former, therefore, while they have no
hatred to sin, not only dread, but fly from the judgment of God, and
thus, having received an incurable wound, they perish in the midst of
their sorrows.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p21"></span>If Judas had listened to the warning of
Christ, there would still have been place for repentance; but since he
despised so gracious an offer of salvation, he is given up to the
dominion of Satan, that he may throw him into despair. But if the
Papists were right in what they teach in their schools about
*repentance,* we could find no defect in that of Judas, to which their
definition of *repentance* fully applies; for we perceive in it
contrition of heart, and confession of the mouth, and satisfaction of
deed, as they talk. Hence we infer, that they take nothing more than the
bark; for they leave out what was the chief point, the conversion of the
man to God, when the sinner, broken down by shame and fear, denies
himself so as to render obedience to righteousness.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p22"></span><span id="ii.xxxvi-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p23"></span>**4.** *What is that to us?* Here is
described the stupidity and madness of the priests, since even after
having been warned by the dreadful example of Judas, still they do not
think about themselves. I do acknowledge that hypocrites, as they are
accustomed to flatter themselves, had some plausible excuse at hand for
distinguishing between their case and that of Judas; for they did not
think that they were partakers of his crime, though they abused the
treachery of Judas. But Judas not only confesses that he has sinned, but
asserts the innocence of Christ; from which it follows, that they had
meditated the death of a *righteous* man, and, therefore, that they were
guilty of a detestable murder. Nor is there any room to doubt that God
intended to sear their consciences with a hot iron, to discover the
hidden corruption. Let us therefore learn, that when we see wicked
persons, with whom we have any thing in common, filled with alarm, those
are so many excitements to repentance, and that they who neglect such
excitements aggravate their criminality. We ought also to believe, that
the crime of one man can have no effect in acquitting all those who are
in any way involved in it; and still more, that the leading perpetrators
of a crime can gain no advantage by distinguishing between themselves
and their agents, that they may not suffer the same punishment.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p24"></span><span id="ii.xxxvi-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p25"></span>**5.** *And he went away, and strangled
himself. This is* the price for which Satan sells the allurements by
which he flatters wicked men for a time. He throws them into a state of
fury, so that, voluntarily cutting themselves off from the hope of
salvation, they find no consolation but in death. Though others would
have permitted Judas to enjoy the *thirty pieces of silver,* by which he
had betrayed Christ and his own salvation, he *throws them down,* and
not only deprives himself of the use of them, but, along with the base
reward of the death of Christ, he throws away also his own life. Thus,
though God does not put forth his hand, wicked men are disappointed of
their desires, so that, when they have obtained their wishes, they not
only deprive themselves of the enjoyment of unsatisfying benefits, but
even make cords for themselves. But though they are their own
executioners by punishing themselves, they do not in any respect
alleviate or diminish the severity of the wrath of God.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p26"></span><span id="ii.xxxvi-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p27"></span>**6.** *It is not lawful for us to throw
it into the treasury.* Hence it plainly appears that hypocrites, by
attending to nothing more than the outward appearance, are guilty of
gross trifling with God. Provided that they do not violate their
*Corban,* (<span id="ii.xxxvi-p27.1"></span>[Mr
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p27.1"></span>,) they imagine that in other matters they
are pure, and give themselves no concern about the infamous bargain, by
which they, not less than Judas, had provoked against themselves the
vengeance of God. But if it was *unlawful to put into the* sacred
*treasury the price of blood,* why was it *lawful* for them to take the
money out of it? for all their wealth was derived from the offerings of
the temple, and from no other source did they take what they now scruple
to mingle again with it as being polluted. Now, whence came the
pollution but from themselves?

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p28"></span><span id="ii.xxxvi-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p29"></span>**8.** *For a burying-place to
strangers.* The more that wicked men endeavor to conceal their
enormities, the more does the Lord watch over them to bring those
enormities to light. They hoped that, by an honorable disguise, they
would bury their crime, were they to purchase a barren field for
*burying strangers.* But the wonderful providence of God turns this
arrangement to an opposite result, so that this *field* became a
perpetual memorial of that treason, which had formerly been little
known. For it was not themselves that gave this name to the place, but
after the occurrence was generally known, *the field* was called, by
common consent, *The field of blood;* as if God had commanded that their
disgrace should be in every man’s mouth. It was a plausible design to
provide *a burying-place for strangers,* if any of those who came up to
Jerusalem from distant countries, for the purpose of sacrificing, should
happen to die there. As some of them were of the Gentiles, I do not
disapprove of the opinion of some ancient writers, that this symbol held
out the hope of salvation to the Gentiles, because they were included in
the price of the death of Christ; but as that opinion is more ingenious
than solid, I leave it undetermined. The word *corbana,* (treasury,) is
Chaldaic, and is derived from the Hebrew word (<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p29.1"></span>קרבן), (*corban*,) of which we have spoken
elsewhere.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p30"></span><span id="ii.xxxvi-p30.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p31"></span>**9.** *Then was fulfilled what was
spoken by Jeremiah the prophet.* How the name of *Jeremiah* crept in, I
confess that I do not know nor do I give myself much trouble to inquire.
The passage itself plainly shows that the name of *Jeremiah* has been
put down by mistake, instead of Zechariah, (<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p31.1"></span>[Zec
11:13](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p31.1"></span>;) for in *Jeremiah* we find nothing of this
sort, nor any thing that even approaches to it. Now that other passage,
if some degree of skill be not used in applying it, might seem to have
been improperly distorted to a wrong meaning; but if we attend to the
rule which the apostles followed in quoting Scripture, we shall easily
perceive that what we find there is highly applicable to Christ. The
Lord, after having complained that his labors were of no avail, so long
as he discharged the office of a shepherd, says that he is compelled by
the troublesome and unpleasant nature of the employment to relinquish it
altogether, and, therefore, declares that he will break his crook, and
will be a shepherd no longer. He afterwards adds, that when he asked his
salary, they gave him *thirty pieces of silver.* The import of these
words is, that he was treated quite contemptuously as if he had been
some mean and ordinary laborer. For the ceremonies and vain pretenses,
by which the Jews recompensed his acts of kindness, are compared by him
to *thirty pieces of silver,* as if they had been the unworthy and
despicable hire of a cowherd or a day-laborer; and, therefore, he bids
them throw it before a *potter* in the temple; as if he had said: “As
for this fine present which they make to me, which would not be less
dishonorable in me to accept than it is contemptuous in them to offer
it, let them rather spend it in purchasing tiles or bricks for repairing
the chinks of the temple.” To make it still more evident that Christ is
the God of armies, towards whom the people had been from the beginning
malicious and ungrateful, when he

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p32"></span>was manifested in the flesh, (<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p32.1"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.xxxvi-p32.1"></span>,)

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p33"></span>it became necessary that what had
formerly been spoken figuratively should now be literally and visibly
accomplished in his person. So, then, when he was compelled by their
malice to take leave of them, and to withdraw his labors from them as
unworthy of such a privilege, they valued him at *thirty pieces of
silver.* And this disdain of the Son of God was the crowning act of
their extreme impiety.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p34"></span>*The price of him that was valued.*
Matthew does not quote the words of Zechariah; for he merely alludes to
the metaphor, under which the Lord then complains of the ingratitude of
the people. But the meaning is the same, that while the Jews ought to
have entirely devoted themselves, and all that they possessed, to the
Lord, they contemptuously dismissed him with a mean hire; as if, by
governing them for so many ages, he had deserved nothing more than any
cowherd would have received for the labors of a single year. He
complains, therefore, that though he is beyond all estimation, he was
rated by them at so low a price.

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p35"></span>*Whom they of the children of Israel did
value.* This expression, which he uses towards the close, must be taken
in a general sense. Judas had struck a bargain with the priests, who
were the avowed representatives of the whole people; so that it was the
Jews who set up Christ for sale, and he was sold, as it were, by the
voice of the public crier. The price was such as was fit to be given *to
a potter.*

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p36"></span><span id="ii.xxxvi-p36.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxvi-p37"></span>**10.** *As the Lord appointed me.* By
this clause Matthew confirms the statement, that this was not done
without the providence of God; because, while they have a different
object in view, they unconsciously fulfill an ancient prediction. For
how could it have occurred to them to *purchase a field* from *a
potter,* if the Lord had not turned their blameworthy conduct so as to
carry into execution his own purpose?
