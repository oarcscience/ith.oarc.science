<span id="ii.vii-p5"></span>**34.** But when the Pharisees heard that he
had put the Sadducees to silence, they assembled together. **35.** And
one of them, a doctor of the law, put a question to him, tempting him,
and saying, **36.** Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
**37.** Jesus saith to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. **38.** This is
the first and great commandment. **39.** And the second is like it, Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as much as thyself. **40.** On these two
commandments the whole law and the prophets depend.

<span id="ii.vii-p6"></span>**28.** And when one of the scribes came,
and heard them disputing together, and saw that he had answered them
well, he put a question to him, Which is the first commandment of all?
**29.** And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is,
Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. **30.** And, Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and
with all thy mind, and with all thy strength; this is the first
commandment. **31.** And the second, which is like it, is this, Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: there is no other commandment
greater than these. **32.** And the scribe said to him, Master, thou
hast answered well with truth, that there is one God, and there is no
other besides him. **33.** And that to love him with all the heart, and
with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the
strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is better than all the
burnt offerings and sacrifices. **34.** And Jesus, when he saw that he
had replied skillfully, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom
of God. And after that, no man ventured to put a question to him.

<span id="ii.vii-p7"></span>**25.** And, lo, a certain lawyer  <span
id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) rose up, tempting him, and saying,
Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? **26.** And he said to
him, What is written in the law? How readest thou? **27.** He answering
said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy
neighbor as thyself. **28.** And he said to him, Thou hast answered
right: do this, and thou shalt live. **29.** But he wishing to justify
himself, said to Jesus, and Who is my neighbor? **30.** And Jesus
answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and
fell among robbers, who even stripped him of his raiment, and, having
wounded him, went away, leaving him half-dead. **31.** And it happened
that a certain priest came down that way, and having seen him, passed
by. **32.** And in like manner a Levite, going near the place, having
approached and seen him, passed by. **33.** And a certain Samaritan, on
his journey, came to him, and when he saw him, was moved with
compassion. **34.** And approaching, bound up his wounds, pouring in oil
and wine; and, setting him on his own beast, conducted him to an inn,
and took care of him. **35.** And, next day, as he was departing, he
drew out two denarii, and gave them to the landlord, and said to him,
Take care of him, and whatever thou spendest more, when I return, I will
repay thee. **36.** Which therefore of these three, thinkest thou, was
neighbor to him who fell among robbers? **37.** And he said, He who took
compassion on him. Jesus therefore said to him, Go, and do thou in like
manner.

<span id="ii.vii-p9"></span> 

<span id="ii.vii-p10"></span><span id="ii.vii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p11"></span>Although I think that this narrative has
nothing more than a resemblance to what is related by Matthew in the
22nd, and by Mark in the 12th chapter, of his Gospel, and that they are
not the same; I have chosen to collect them into one place, because,
while Matthew and Mark affirm that this was the last *question* by which
our Lord was *tempted,* Luke makes no mention of that circumstance, and
seems intentionally to leave it out, because he had stated it in another
passage. And yet I do not dispute that it may be the same narrative,
though Luke has some things different from the other two. They all agree
in this, that the *scribe* put a question for the sake of tempting
Christ; but he who is described by Matthew and Mark goes away with no
bad disposition; for he acquiesces in Christ’s reply, and shows a sign
of a teachable and gentle mind: to which must be added, that Christ, on
the other hand, declares that he *is not far from the kingdom of God.*
Luke, on the other hand, introduces a man who was obstinate and swelled
with pride, in whom no evidence of repentance is discovered. Now there
would be no absurdity in saying that Christ was repeatedly *tempted* on
the subject of true righteousness, and of keeping the Law, and of the
rule of a good life. But whether Luke has related this out of its proper
place, or whether he has now passed by the other question — because that
former narrative relating to doctrine was sufficient — the similarity of
the doctrine seemed to require me to compare the three Evangelists with
each other.

<span id="ii.vii-p12"></span>Let us now see what was the occasion that
led this *scribe* to put a question to Christ. It is because, being an
expounder of the Law, he is offended at the doctrine of the gospel, by
which he supposes the authority of Moses to be diminished. At the same
time, he is not so much influenced by zeal for the Law, as by
displeasure at losing some part of the honor of his teaching. He
therefore inquires at Christ, if he wishes to profess any thing more
perfect than the Law; for, though he does not say this in words, yet his
question is ensnaring, for the purpose of exposing Christ to the hatred
of the people. Matthew and Mark do not attribute this stratagem to one
man only, but show that it was done by mutual arrangement, and that out
of the whole sect one person was chosen who was thought to excel the
rest in ability and learning. In the form of the question, too, Luke
differs somewhat from Matthew and Mark; for, according to him, the
*scribe* inquires *what* men *must do to obtain eternal life,* but
according to the other two Evangelists, he inquires *what is the chief
commandment in the law.* But the design is the same, for he makes a
deceitful attack on Christ, that, if he can draw any thing from his lips
that is at variance with *the law,* he may exclaim against him as an
apostate and a promoter of ungodly revolt.

<span id="ii.vii-p13"></span><span id="ii.vii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p14"></span>**<span id="ii.vii-p14.2"></span>[Luke
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.vii-p14.2"></span>.** *What is written in the law?* He receives
from Christ a reply different from what he had expected. And, indeed, no
other rule of a holy and righteous life was prescribed by Christ than
what had been laid down by the Law of Moses; for the perfect love of God
and of our neighbors comprehends the utmost perfection of righteousness.
Yet it must be observed, that Christ speaks here about obtaining
salvation, in agreement with the question which had been put to him; for
he does not teach absolutely, as in other passages, how men may arrive
at eternal life, but how they ought to live, in order to be accounted
righteous in the sight of God. Now it is certain that in the Law there
is prescribed to men a rule by which they ought to regulate their life,
so as to obtain salvation in the sight of God. That the Law can do
nothing else than condemn, and is therefore called the doctrine of
death, and is said by Paul to increase transgressions, (<span
id="ii.vii-p14.3"></span>[Ro 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.vii-p14.3"></span>,) arises not from any fault of its doctrine,
but because it is impossible for us to perform what it enjoins.
Therefore, though no man is justified by the Law yet the Law itself
contains the highest righteousness, because it does not falsely hold out
salvation to its followers, if any one fully observed all that it
commands.  <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) Nor ought we to look
upon this as a strange manner of teaching, that God first demands the
righteousness of works, and next offers a gratuitous righteousness
without works; for it is necessary that men should be convinced of their
righteous condemnation, that they may betake themselves to the mercy of
God. Accordingly, Paul (<span id="ii.vii-p15.2"></span>[Rom.
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006)<span id="ii.vii-p15.2"></span>.md)
compares both kinds of *righteousness,* in order to inform us that the
reason why we are freely justified by God is, that we have no
righteousness of our own. Now Christ in this reply accommodated himself
to the *lawyer,* and attended to the nature of his *question;* for he
had inquired not how salvation must be sought, but by what works it must
be obtained.

<span id="ii.vii-p16"></span><span id="ii.vii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p17"></span>**<span id="ii.vii-p17.2"></span>[Matthew
22:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037.md)<span
id="ii.vii-p17.2"></span>.** *Thou shalt love the Lord thou God.*
According to Mark, the preface is inserted, that *Jehovah alone is the
God of Israel;* by which words God supports the authority of his law in
two ways. For, first, it ought to be a powerful excitement to the
worship of God, when we are fully convinced that we worship the actual
Creator of heaven and earth, because indifference is naturally produced
by doubt; and, secondly, because it is a pleasing inducement to *love*
him, when he freely adopts us as his people. So then, that they may not
hesitate, as usually happens in cases of uncertainty, the Jews are
informed that the rule of life is prescribed to them by the true and
only God; and, on the other hand, that they may not be kept back by
distrust, God approaches to them in a familiar manner, and reminds them
of his gracious covenant with them. And yet there is no reason to doubt
that the Lord distinguishes himself from all idols, that the Jews may
not be drawn aside from him, but may adhere to the pure worship of God
himself. Now if uncertainty does not keep back the wretched worshippers
of idols from being carried away to the love of them by impetuous zeal,
what excuse is left for the hearers of the Law, if they remain
indifferent, after that God has revealed himself to them?

<span id="ii.vii-p18"></span>What follows is an abridgment of the Law,
 <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) which is also found in the
writings of Moses, (<span id="ii.vii-p19.2"></span>[De
6:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#005)<span id="ii.vii-p19.2"></span>..md)
For, though it is divided into two tables, the first of which relates to
the worship of God, and the second to charity, Moses properly and wisely
draws up this summary,  <span id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) that the
Jews may perceive what is the will of God in each of the commandments.
And although we ought to love God far more than men, yet most properly
does God, instead of worship or honor, require *love* from us, because
in this way he declares that no other worship is pleasing to Him than
what is voluntary; for no man will actually obey God but he who *loves*
Him. But as the wicked and sinful inclinations of the flesh draw us
aside from what is right, Moses shows that our life will not be
regulated aright till the *love* of God fill all our senses. Let us
therefore learn, that the commencement of godliness is the *love* of
God, because God disdains the forced services of men, and chooses to be
worshipped freely and willingly; and let us also learn, that under the
*love* of God is included the reverence due to him.

<span id="ii.vii-p21"></span>Moses does not add the *mind,* but mentions
only the *heart,* and the *soul,* and the *strength;* and though the
present division into four clauses is more full, yet it does not alter
the sense. For while Moses intends to teach generally that God ought to
be perfectly *loved,* and that whatever powers belong to men ought to be
devoted to this object, he reckoned it enough, after mentioning the
*soul* and the *heart,* to add the *strength,* that he might not leave
any part of us uninfluenced by the *love* of God; and we know also that
under the word *heart* the Hebrews sometimes include the *mind,*  <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) particularly when it is joined to the
word *soul* What is the difference between the *mind* and the heart,
both in this passage and in Matthew, I do not trouble myself to inquire,
except that I consider the *mind* to denote the loftier abode of reason,
from which all our thoughts and deliberations flow.

<span id="ii.vii-p23"></span>It now appears from this summary that, in
the commandments of the Law, God does not look at what men can do, but
at what they ought to do; since in this infirmity of the flesh it is
impossible that perfect *love* can obtain dominion, for we know how
strongly all the senses of our soul are disposed to vanity. Lastly, we
learn from this, that God does not rest satisfied with the outward
appearance of works, but chiefly demands the inward feelings, that from
a good root good fruits may grow.

<span id="ii.vii-p24"></span><span id="ii.vii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p25"></span>**39.** *And the second is like it.* He
assigns the *second* place to mutual kindness among men, for the worship
of God is *first* in order. The *commandment* to love our neighbors, he
tells us, is *like* the first, because it depends upon it. For, since
every man is devoted to himself, there will never be true charity
towards *neighbors,* unless where the love of God reigns; for it is a
mercenary love  <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) which the children
of the world entertain for each other, because every one of them has
regard to his own advantage. On the other hand, it is impossible for the
love of God to reign without producing brotherly kindness among men.

<span id="ii.vii-p27"></span>Again, when Moses commanded us to love our
neighbors as ourselves, he did not intend to put the *love* of
*ourselves* in the first place, so that a man may first love *himself*
and then love his *neighbors;* as the sophists of the *Sorbonne* are
wont to cavil, that a rule must always go before what it regulates. But
as we are too much devoted to ourselves, Moses, in correcting this
fault, places our neighbors in an equal rank with us; thus forbidding
every man to pay so much attention to himself as to disregard others,
because kindness unites all in one body. And by correcting the
*self-love* (<span id="ii.vii-p27.3"></span>φιλαυτίαν) which separates
some persons from others, he brings each of them into a common union,
and—as it were—into a mutual embrace. Hence we conclude, that charity is
justly pronounced by Paul to be

<span id="ii.vii-p28"></span>the bond of perfection, (<span
id="ii.vii-p28.1"></span>[Col
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#014)<span id="ii.vii-p28.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="ii.vii-p29"></span>and, in another passage, the

<span id="ii.vii-p30"></span>fulfilling of the law, (<span
id="ii.vii-p30.1"></span>[Ro
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010)<span id="ii.vii-p30.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="ii.vii-p31"></span>for all the commandments of the second
table must be referred to it.

<span id="ii.vii-p32"></span><span id="ii.vii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p33"></span>**<span id="ii.vii-p33.2"></span>[Luke
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.vii-p33.2"></span>.** *Do this, and thou shalt live.* I have
explained a little before, how this promise agrees with freely bestowed
justification by faith; for the reason why God justifies us freely is,
not that the Law does not point out perfect righteousness, but because
we fail in keeping it, and the reason why it is declared to be
impossible for us to obtain life by it is, that

<span id="ii.vii-p34"></span>it is weak through our flesh, (<span
id="ii.vii-p34.1"></span>[Ro 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.vii-p34.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.vii-p35"></span>So then these two statements are perfectly
consistent with each other, that the Law teaches how men may obtain
righteousness by works, and yet that no man is justified by works,
because the fault lies not in the doctrine of the Law, but in men. It
was the intention of Christ, in the meantime, to vindicate himself from
the calumny which, he knew, was brought against him by the unlearned and
ignorant, that he set aside the Law, so far as it is a perpetual rule of
righteousness.

<span id="ii.vii-p36"></span><span id="ii.vii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p37"></span>**29.** *But he wishing to justify
himself.* This question might appear to be of no importance for
*justifying* a man. But if we recollect what was formerly stated, that
the hypocrisy of men is elderly detected by means of the second
table—for, while they pretend to be eminent worshippers of God, they
openly violate charity towards their neighbors—it will be easy to infer
from this, that the Pharisee practiced this evasion, in order that,
concealed under the false mask of holiness, he might not be brought
forth to light. So then, aware that the test of charity would prove
unfavorable to him, he seeks concealment under the word *neighbor,* that
he may not be discovered to be a transgressor of the Law. But we have
already seen, that on this subject the Law was corrupted by the scribes,
because they reckoned none to be their *neighbors* but those who were
worthy of it. Hence, too, this principle was received among them, that
we have a right to *hate our enemies,* (<span
id="ii.vii-p37.1"></span>[Mt 5:43](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#043.md)<span
id="ii.vii-p37.1"></span>.) For the only method to which hypocrites can
resort for avoiding the condemnation of themselves, is to turn away as
far as they are able, that their life may not be tried by the judgment
of the Law.

<span id="ii.vii-p38"></span><span id="ii.vii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p39"></span>**30.** *And Jesus answering said.* Christ
might have stated simply, that the word *neighbor* extends
indiscriminately to every man, because the whole human race is united by
a sacred bond of fellowship. And, indeed, the Lord employed this word in
the Law, for no other reason than to draw us sweetly to mutual kindness.
The commandment would have run more clearly thus: *Love every man as
thyself.* But as men are blinded by their pride, so that every man is
satisfied with himself, scarcely deigns to admit others to an equal
rank, and withholds from them the duties he owes them, the Lord
purposely declares that all are *neighbors* that the very relationship
may produce mutual love. To make any person our *neighbor,* therefore,
it is enough that he be, a man; for it is not in our power to blot out
our common nature.

<span id="ii.vii-p40"></span>But Christ intended to draw the reply from
the Pharisee, that he might condemn himself. For in consequence of the
authoritative decision being generally received among them, that no man
is our *neighbor* unless he is our friend, if Christ had put a direct
question to him, he would never have made an explicit acknowledgment,
that under the word *neighbor* all men are included, which the
comparison brought forward forces him to confess. The general truth
conveyed is, that the greatest stranger is *our neighbor,* because God
has bound all men together, for the purpose of assisting each other. He
glances briefly, however, at the Jews, and especially at the priests;
because, while they boasted of being the children of the same Father,
and of being separated by the privilege of adoption from the rest of the
nations, so as to be God’s sacred heritage, yet, with barbarous and
unfeeling contempt, they despised each other, as if no relationship had
subsisted between them. For there is no doubt that Christ describes the
cruel neglect of brotherly kindness, with which they knew that they were
chargeable. But here, as I have said, the chief design is to show that
the *neighborhood,* which lays us under obligation to mutual offices of
kindness, is not confined to friends or relatives, but extends to the
whole human race.

<span id="ii.vii-p41"></span>To prove this, Christ compares *a
Samaritan* to *a priest* and *a Levite.* It is well known what deadly
hatred the Jews bore to the *Samaritans,* so that, notwithstanding their
living close beside them, they were always at the greatest variance.
Christ now says, that a Jew, an inhabitant of *Jericho,* on his journey
*from Jerusalem,* having been wounded by *robbers,* received no
assistance either from *a Levite or from a priest,* both of whom met
with him lying on the road, and *half-dead,* but that a *Samaritan*
showed him great kindness, and then asks, *Which of these three was
neighbor* to the Jew? This subtle doctor could not escape from
preferring the *Samaritan* to the other two. For here, as in a mirror,
we behold that common relationship of men, which the scribes endeavored
to blot out by their wicked sophistry;  <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) and the *compassion,* which an enemy
showed to a Jew, demonstrates that the guidance and teaching of nature
are sufficient to show that man was created for the sake of man. Hence
it is inferred that there is a mutual obligation between all men.

<span id="ii.vii-p43"></span>The allegory which is here contrived by the
advocates of free will is too absurd to deserve refutation. According to
them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of
Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well
was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only
*half-dead.* As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to
speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the
wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if
he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage,
that all are *dead,* but those whom he quickens by *his voice,* (<span
id="ii.vii-p43.1"></span>[Joh
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#025)<span id="ii.vii-p43.1"></span>..md)
As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has
been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost
universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This
*Samaritan* they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and
they tell us that *wine was poured,* along with *oil,* into the wound,
because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They
have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately
restore health, but sends us to the Church, as *an innkeeper,* to be
gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these
interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture
than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning.
And, indeed, any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led
them to contrive these speculations, contrary to the intention of
Christ.

<span id="ii.vii-p44"></span><span id="ii.vii-p44.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p45"></span>**<span id="ii.vii-p45.2"></span>[Matthew
22:40](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#040.md)<span
id="ii.vii-p45.2"></span>.** *On these two commandments.* I now return
to Matthew, where Christ says that *all the Law and the prophets depend
on these two commandments;* not that he intends to limit to them  <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) all the doctrine of Scripture, but
because all that is anywhere taught as to the manner of living a holy
and righteous life must be referred to these two leading points. For
Christ does not treat generally of what *the Law and the Prophets*
contain, but, in drawing up his reply, states that nothing else is
required in *the Law and the prophets* than that every man should *love
God* and his *neighbors;* as if he had said, that the sum of a holy and
upright life consists in the worship of God and in charity to men, as
Paul states that charity is

<span id="ii.vii-p47"></span>the fulfilling of the law, (<span
id="ii.vii-p47.1"></span>[Ro
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010)<span id="ii.vii-p47.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.vii-p48"></span>And therefore some ill-informed persons are
mistaken in interpreting this saying of Christ, as if we ought to seek
nothing higher in *the Law and the Prophets.* For as a distinction ought
to be made between the promises and the commandments, so in this passage
Christ does not state generally what we ought to learn from the word of
God, but explains, in a manner suited to the occasion, the end to which
all the commandments are directed. Yet the free forgiveness of sins, by
which we are reconciled to God, — confidence in calling on God, which is
the earnest of the future inheritance, — and all the other parts of
faith, though they hold the first rank in the Law, do not *depend on
these two commandments;* for it is one thing to demand what we owe, and
another thing to offer what we do not possess. The same thing is
expressed in other words by Mark, that *there is no other commandment
greater than these.*

<span id="ii.vii-p49"></span><span id="ii.vii-p49.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p50"></span>**<span id="ii.vii-p50.2"></span>[Mark
12:32](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#032.md)<span
id="ii.vii-p50.2"></span>.** *Master, thou hast spoken well, and with
truth. Mark* alone mentions that the *scribe* was softened down; and it
is worthy of notice that, though he had attacked Christ maliciously, and
with the intention of taking him by surprise, not only does he silently
yield to the latter, but openly and candidly assents to what Christ had
said. Thus we see that he did not belong to the class of those enemies
whose obstinacy is incurable; for, though they have been a hundred times
convinced, yet they do not cease to oppose the truth in some manner.
From this reply it may also be concluded, that Christ did not precisely
include under these two words the rule of life, but embraced the
opportunity which presented itself for reproving the false and
hypocritical holiness of the scribes, who, giving their whole attention
to outward ceremonies, almost entirely disregarded the spiritual worship
of God, and cared little about brotherly kindness. Now though the scribe
was infected by such corruptions, yet, as sometimes happens, he had
obtained from the Law the seed of right knowledge, which lay choked in
his heart, and on that account he easily allows himself to be withdrawn
from the wicked custom.

<span id="ii.vii-p51"></span><span id="ii.vii-p51.1"></span>

<span id="ii.vii-p52"></span>**33.** *Is better than all burnt-offerings
and sacrifices.* But it appears to be incongruous that *sacrifices,*
which are a part of divine worship, and belong to the first table of the
Law, should be reckoned of less importance than charity towards men. The
reply is, Though the worship of God is greatly preferable, and is more
valuable than all the duties of a holy life, yet its outward exercises
ought not to be estimated so highly as to swallow up brotherly kindness.
For we know that brotherly kindness, in itself and simply, is pleasing
to God, though *sacrifices* are not regarded by him with delight or
approbation, except with a view to another object. Besides, it is naked
and empty *sacrifices* that are here spoken of; for our Lord contrasts a
hypocritical appearance of piety with true and sincere uprightness. The
same doctrine is to be found very frequently in the prophets, that
hypocrites may know that *sacrifices* are of no value, unless spiritual
truth be joined to them, and that God is not appeased by offerings of
beasts, where brotherly kindness is neglected.

<span id="ii.vii-p54"></span>**34.** *But when Jesus saw.* Whether this
*scribe* made any farther progress is uncertain; but as he had shown
himself to be teachable, Christ stretches out the hand to him, and
teaches us, by his example, that we ought to assist those in whom there
is any beginning either of docility or of right understanding. There
appear to have been two reasons why Christ declared that this scribe
*was not far from the kingdom of God.* It was because he was easily
persuaded to do his duty, and because he skillfully distinguished the
outward worship of God from necessary duties. Nor was it so much with
the design of praising as of exhorting him, that Christ declared that
*he was near the kingdom of God;* and in his person Christ encourages us
all, after having once entered into the right path, to proceed with so
much the greater cheerfulness. By these words we are also taught that
many, while they are still held and involved in error, advance with
closed eyes towards the road, and in this manner are prepared for
running in the course of the Lord, when the time arrives.

<span id="ii.vii-p55"></span>*And after that, no man ventured to put a
question to him.* The assertion of the Evangelists, that the mouth of
adversaries was stopped, so they *did not venture* any more to lay
snares for Christ, must not be so understood as if’ they desisted from
their wicked obstinacy; for they groaned within, like wild beasts shut
up in their dens, or, like unruly horses, they bit the bridle. But the
more hardened their obstinacy, and the more incorrigible their
rebellion, so much the more illustrious was Christ’s triumph over both.
And this victory, which he obtained, ought greatly to encourage us never
to become dispirited in the defense of the truth, being assured of
success. It will often happen, indeed, that enemies shall molest and
insult us till the end, but God will at length secure that their fury
shall recoil on their own heads, and that, in spite of their efforts,
truth shall be victorious.
