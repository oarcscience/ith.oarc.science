the rest, but neither did they believe them. **14. **Afterwards he
appeared to the eleven while they sat at meat, and upbraided them with
their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those
who saw him after he was risen.

Lord is actually risen, and hath appeared to Simon. **35. **Then they
related what had taken place on the road, and how he had been recognized

these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them, and said to them, Peace
be to you. **37. **But they were terrified and affrighted, and thought

<span id="ii.xlix-p11"></span>**<span id="ii.xlix-p11.2"></span>[Luke
24:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.xlix-p11.2"></span>.** *And their eyes were opened.* By these
words, we are taught that there was not in Christ any *metamorphosis,*
or *variety of forms,* by which he might impose on the eyes of men, (as
the poets feign their *Proteus,*) but that, on the contrary, the eyes of
beholders were mistaken, because they were covered; just as, shortly
afterwards, *he vanished from the eyes* of those very persons, not
because his body was in itself invisible, but because God, by
withdrawing their rigor, blunted their acuteness. Nor ought we to wonder
that Christ, as soon as he was recognized, immediately disappeared; for
it was not advantageous that they should any longer behold him, lest, as
they were naturally too much addicted to the earth, they might desire
again to bring him back to an earthly life. So far, then, as it was
necessary to assure them of his resurrection, he made himself visible to
them; but by the sudden departure, he taught them that they must seek
him elsewhere than in the world, because the completion of the new life
was his ascension to heaven.

<span id="ii.xlix-p12"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p13"></span>**32.** *Did not our heart burn within
us?* Their recognition of Christ led the disciples to a lively
perception of the secret and hidden grace of the Spirit, which he had
formerly bestowed upon them. For God sometimes works in his people in
such a manner, that for a time they are not aware of the power of the
Spirit, (of which, however, they are not destitute,) or, at least, that
they do not perceive it distinctly, but only feel it by a secret
movement. Thus the disciples had formerly indeed felt an ardor, which
they now remember, but which they had not then observed: now that Christ
has made himself known to them, they at length begin to consider the
grace which they had formerly, as it were, swallowed without tasting it,
and perceive that they were stupid. For they accuse themselves of
indifference, as if they had said, “How did it happen that we did not
recognize him while he was talking? for when he penetrated into our
hearts, we ought to have perceived who he was.” But they conclude that
he is Christ, not simply from the bare sign that his word was
efficacious to inflame their hearts, but because they ascribe to him the
honor which belongs to him, that when he speaks with the mouth, he
likewise inflames their hearts inwardly by the warmth of his Spirit.
Paul, indeed, boasts that *the ministration of the Spirit* was given to
him, (<span id="ii.xlix-p13.1"></span>[2Co
3:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#008)<span id="ii.xlix-p13.1"></span>;.md)
and Scripture frequently adorns the ministers of the word with such
titles as the following; that they convert the hearts, enlighten the
understandings, and renew men so as to become pure and holy sacrifices;
but then it is not to show what they do by their own power, but rather
what the Lord accomplishes by means of them. But both belong equally to
Christ alone, to pronounce the outward voice, and to form the hearts
efficaciously to the obedience of faith.

<span id="ii.xlix-p14"></span>It cannot be doubted that he then engraved
an uncommon Mark on the hearts of these two men, that they might at
length perceive that in speaking he had breathed into them a divine
warmth. For though the word of the Lord is always *fire,* yet a fiery
rigor was at that time manifested in a peculiar and unusual, manner in
the discourse of Christ, and was intended to be an evident proof of his
divine power; for it is he alone *who baptizeth in the Holy Ghost and in
fire,* (<span id="ii.xlix-p14.1"></span>[Lu
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#016)<span id="ii.xlix-p14.1"></span>..md)
Yet let us remember that it is the proper fruit of heavenly doctrine,
whoever may be the minister of it, to kindle the fire of the Spirit in
the hearts of men, to purify and cleanse the affections of the flesh, or
rather to burn them up, and to kindle a truly fervent love of God; and
by its flame, as it were, to carry away men entirely to heaven.

<span id="ii.xlix-p15"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p16"></span>**33.** *And they arose in the same hour.*
 <span id="fr_319"></span>[320](#fn_319.md) The circumstance of the time,
and the distance of the places, show with what ardor those two men
turned to convey the intelligence to their fellow-disciples. As they
entered a lodging towards evening, it is probable that the Lord had not
made himself known to them before night came on. To perform a journey of
three hours in the dead of night was exceedingly inconvenient; yet they
rise that very instant, and return in haste to Jerusalem. And, indeed,
if they had only gone thither next day, their tardiness might have
exposed them to suspicion; but as they chose rather to deprive
themselves of the repose of the night than to allow the slightest delay
in making the apostles partakers of their joy, the very haste gave
additional credit to their narrative. Now whenLuke says that *they arose
in the same hour,*  <span id="fr_320"></span>[321](#fn_320.md) it is
probable that they came *to the disciples* about midnight. But,
according to the testimony of the same Luke, *the disciples* were at
that time conversing together; and hence we learn their anxiety, and
industry, and ardor, in spending almost the whole night without sleep,
and unceasingly making inquiries at each other, until the resurrection
of Christ was ascertained by a multitude of testimonies.

<span id="ii.xlix-p19"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p19.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p20"></span>**34.** *Saying, The Lord is actually
risen.* By these words Luke means that those persons who had brought to
the apostles joyful intelligence to confirm their minds, were informed
by the disciples respecting another appearance. Nor can it be doubled
that this mutual confirmation was the reward which God bestowed on them
for their holy diligence. By a comparison of the time, we may conclude
that Peter, after having returned from the sepulcher, was in a state of
great perplexity and uncertainty, until Christ showed himself to him,
and that, on the very day that he had visited the sepulcher, he obtained
his wish. Hence arose that mutual congratulation among the eleven, that
there was now no reason to doubt, because *the Lord had appeared to
Simon.*

<span id="ii.xlix-p21"></span>But this appears to disagree with the
words of Mark, who says, that the eleven *did not even believe* those
two persons; for how could it be that those who were already certain now
rejected additional witnesses, and remained in their former hesitation?
By saying that *he is actually risen,* they acknowledge that the matter
is beyond all doubt. First, I reply, that the general phrase contains a
*synecdoche;* for some were harder or less ready to believe, and Thomas
was more obstinate than all the rest, (<span
id="ii.xlix-p21.1"></span>[Joh
20:25](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.xlix-p21.1"></span>.) Secondly, We may easily infer that they
were convinced in the same way as usually happens to persons who are
astonished, and who do not consider the matter calmly; and we know that
such persons are continually falling into various doubts. However that
may be, it is evident from Luke, that the greater part of them, in the
midst of that overpowering amazement, not, only embraced willingly what
was told them, but contended with their own distrust; for by the word
*actually* they cut off all ground for doubt. And yet we shall soon
afterwards see that, a second and a third time, in consequence of their
astonishment, they fell back into their former doubts.

<span id="ii.xlix-p22"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p23"></span>**36.** *Jesus himself stood in the midst
of them.* While the Evangelist John copiously details the same
narrative, (<span id="ii.xlix-p23.1"></span>[Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.xlix-p23.1"></span>,) he differs from Luke in some circumstances.
Mark, too, differs somewhat in his brief statement. As to John, since he
only collects what Luke omitted, both may be easily reconciled. There is
no contradiction about the substance of the fact; unless some person
were to raise a debate about the time: for it is there said that Jesus
entered in the evening, while it is evident, from the thread of the
narrative, that he appeared at a late hour in the night, when the
disciples had returned from Emmaus. But I do not think it right to
insist precisely on the hour of the evening. On the contrary, we may
easily and properly extend to a late hour of the night what is here
said, and understand it to mean that Christ came to them after the
evening, when the apostles had shut the doors, and kept themselves
concealed within the house. In short, John does not describe the very
commencement of the night, but simply means that, when the day was past,
and after sunset, and even at the dead hour of night, Christ came to the
disciples contrary to their expectation.

<span id="ii.xlix-p24"></span>Still there arises here another question,
since Mark and Luke relate that *the eleven* were assembled, when Christ
appeared to them; and John says that Thomas was then absent, (<span
id="ii.xlix-p24.1"></span>[Joh
20:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#024.md)<span
id="ii.xlix-p24.1"></span>.) But there is no absurdity in saying that
the number — *the eleven* — is here put for the apostles themselves,
though one of their company was absent. We have lately stated—and the
fact makes it evident—that John enters into the details with greater
distinctness, because it was his design to relate what the others had
omitted. Besides, it is beyond a doubt that the three Evangelists relate
the same narrative; since John expressly says that it was only twice
that Christ appeared to his disciples at Jerusalem, before they went to
Galilee; for he says that *he appeared to them the third time at the sea
of Tiberias,* (<span id="ii.xlix-p24.2"></span>[Joh
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#001)<span id="ii.xlix-p24.2"></span>.md)
He had already described two appearances of our Lord, one which took
place on the day after his resurrection, (<span
id="ii.xlix-p24.3"></span>[Joh
20:19](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.xlix-p24.3"></span>,) and the other which followed eight days
afterwards, (<span id="ii.xlix-p24.4"></span>[Joh
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026)<span id="ii.xlix-p24.4"></span>.md)
though, were any one to choose rather to explain the second appearance
to be that which is found in the Gospel by Mark, I should not greatly
object.

<span id="ii.xlix-p25"></span>I now return to the words of Luke. He does
not, indeed, say that Christ, by his divine power, opened for himself
*the doors which were shut,* (<span id="ii.xlix-p25.1"></span>[Joh
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.xlix-p25.1"></span>;) but something of this sort is indirectly
suggested by the phrase which he employs, *Jesus stood.* For how could
our Lord suddenly, during the night, *stand in the midst of them,* if he
had not entered in a miraculous manner? The same form of salutation is
employed by both, *Peace be to you;* by which the Hebrews mean, that for
the person whom they address they wish happiness and prosperity.

<span id="ii.xlix-p26"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p27"></span>**37.** *And they were terrified and
affrighted.* John does not mention this terror; but as he also says that
Christ showed his hands and sides to the disciples, we may conjecture
that some circumstance had been omitted by him. Nor is it at all unusual
with the Evangelists, when they aim at brevity, to glance only at a part
of the facts. From Luke, too, we learn that the terror excited in them
by the strangeness of the spectacle was such, that they dare not trust
their eyes. But a little ago, they had come to the conclusion that *the
Lord was risen,* (verse 34,) and had spoken of it unhesitatingly as a
matter fully ascertained; and now, when they behold him with their eyes,
their senses are struck with astonishment, so that they think he is *a
spirit.* Though this error, which arose from weakness, was not free from
blame, still they did not so far forget themselves as to be afraid of
enchantments. But though they did not think that they are imposed upon,
still they are more inclined to believe that an image of the
resurrection is exhibited to them in vision by the Spirit, than that
Christ himself, who lately died on the cross, is alive and present. So
then they did not suspect that this was a vision intended to deceive
them, as if it had been an idle phantom, but, seized with fear, they
thought only that there was exhibited to them *in spirit* what was
actually placed before their eyes.

<span id="ii.xlix-p28"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p29"></span>**38.** *Why are you troubled?* By these
words they are exhorted to lay aside terror, and regain the possession
of their minds, that, having returned to the rigor of their senses, they
may judge of a matter which is fully ascertained; for so long as men are
seized with perturbation, they are blind amidst the clearest light. In
order, therefore, that the disciples may obtain undoubted information,
they are enjoined to weigh the matter with calmness and composure.

<span id="ii.xlix-p30"></span>*And why do thoughts arise in your
hearts?* In this second clause, Christ reproves another fault, which is,
that by the variety of their *thoughts* they throw difficulties in their
own way. By saying that *thoughts arise,* he means that the knowledge of
the truth is choked in them in such a manner, that *seeing they do not
see,* (<span id="ii.xlix-p30.1"></span>[Mt
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.xlix-p30.1"></span>;) for they do not restrain their wicked
imaginations, but, on the contrary, by giving them free scope, they
permit them to gain the superiority. And certainly we find it to be too
true, that as, when the sky has been clear in the morning, clouds
afterwards arise to darken the clear light of the sun; so when we allow
our reasonings to arise with excessive freedom in opposition to the word
of God, what formerly appeared clear to us is withdrawn from our eyes.
We have a right, indeed, when any appearance of absurdity presents
itself, to inquire by weighing the arguments on both sides; and, indeed,
so long as matters are doubtful, our minds must inevitably be driven
about in every direction: but we must observe sobriety and moderation,
lest the flesh exalt itself more highly than it ought, and throw out its
thoughts far and wide against heaven.

<span id="ii.xlix-p31"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p31.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p32"></span>**39.** *Look at my hands and my feet.* He
calls upon their bodily senses as witnesses, that they may not suppose
that a shadow is exhibited to them instead of a body. And, first, he
distinguishes between a corporeal man and a spirit; as if he had said,
“Sight and touch will prove that I am a real man, who have formerly
conversed with you; for I am clothed with that flesh which was
crucified, and which still bears the marks of it.” Again, when Christ
declares that his body may be touched, and that it has solid *bones,*
this passage is justly and appropriately adduced by those who adhere to
us, for the purpose of refuting the gross error about the
transubstantiation of bread into the body, or about the local presence
of the body, which men foolishly imagine to exist in the Holy Supper.
For they would have us to believe that the body of Christ is in a place
where no Mark of a body can be seen; and in this way it will follow that
it has changed its nature, so that it has ceased to be what it was, and
from which Christ proves it to be a real body. If it be objected, on the
other hand, that his *side* was then pierced, and that *his feet and
hands* were pierced and wounded by the *nails,* but that now Christ is
in heaven without any vestige of wound or injury, it is easy to dispose
of this objection; for the present question is not merely in what form
Christ appeared, but what he declares as to the real nature of his
flesh. Now he pronounces it to be, as it were, a distinguishing
character of his body, that he may be *handled,* and therefore differs
from a *spirit.* We must therefore hold that the distinction between
*flesh* and *spirit,* which the words of Christ authorize us to regard
as perpetual, exists in the present day.

<span id="ii.xlix-p33"></span>As to the *wounds,* we ought to look upon
this as a proof by which it was intended to prove to us all, that Christ
rose rather for us them for himself; since, after having vanquished
death, and obtained a blessed and heavenly immortality, yet, on our
account, he continued for a time to bear some remaining marks of the
cross. It certainly was an astonishing act of condescension towards the
disciples, that he chose rather to want something that was necessary to
render perfect the glory of the resurrection, than to deprive their
faith of such a support. But it was a foolish and an old wife’s dream,
to imagine that he will still continue to bear the marks of the wounds,
when he shall come to judge the world.

<span id="ii.xlix-p34"></span><span id="ii.xlix-p34.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlix-p35"></span>**<span id="ii.xlix-p35.2"></span>[Mark
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.xlix-p35.2"></span>.** *Afterwards he appeared to the eleven,
while they were sitting.* The participle (<span
id="ii.xlix-p35.3"></span>ἀνακειμένοις) which some have rendered
*sitting at table,* ought, in my opinion, to be simply rendered
*sitting;* and it is not without reason that I take this view of it, if
it be agreed that the Evangelist here describes the first appearance;
for it would have been an unseasonable hour of supper about midnight.
Besides, if the cloth had been laid,  <span
id="fr_321"></span>[322](#fn_321.md) this would not have agreed with what
Luke shortly afterwards says, that Christ asked if they had anything to
eat. Now, *to sit* is the Hebrew phrase for *resting* in any place.

<span id="ii.xlix-p37"></span>*And upbraided them with their unbelief
and hardness of heart.* This reproof corresponds more to the first
appearance than to the second; for since, *the disciples,* as John tells
us, (<span id="ii.xlix-p37.1"></span>[Joh
20:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#020)<span id="ii.xlix-p37.1"></span>.md)
*were glad when they had seen the Lord* on the day after the Passover,
their unbelief was then rebuked. To restrict these words of Mark to
Thomas alone, as some have done, appears to be forced; and, therefore, I
prefer to explain them simply as meaning, that when Christ first
appeared to the apostles, he reproved them for not believing the
testimony of eye-witnesses, who informed them of his resurrection. And
yet when he condemns their hardness of heart, it is not solely because
they did not give credit to men, but because, after having been
convinced by the result, they did not at length embrace the testimony of
the Lord. Since, therefore, *Peter* and *Mary, Cleopas* and his
companion, were not the first witnesses of the resurrection, but only
subscribed to the words of Christ, it follows, that the rest of the
apostles poured dishonor on the Lord by refusing to believe his words,
though they had already been proved by their result. Justly, therefore,
are they reproached with hardness of heart, because, in addition to
their slowness, there was wicked obstinacy; as if they had intentionally
desired to suppress what was evidently true; not that they intended to
extinguish the glory of their Master, or to accuse him of falsehood, but
because their obstinacy stood in the way, and hindered them from being
submissive. In short, he does not here condemn them for voluntary
obstinacy, as I have already said, but for blind indifference, which
sometimes hardens men that otherwise are not wicked or rebellious.
