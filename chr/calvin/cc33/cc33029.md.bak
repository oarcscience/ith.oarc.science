will all be offended at me this night; for it is written, I will strike
the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. **32. **But

strongly, Though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. In like
manner also they all spoke.

said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock will not crow today, before thou
thrice deny that you knowest me.

26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.xxviii-p10.2"></span>.** *You will all be offended at me.* What
Matthew and Mark extend to all the disciples alike is related by Luke as
having been spoken to Peter only. But though the statement was equally
addressed to all, yet it is probable that Christ spoke to them in the
person of one man, who was to be admonished more than all the rest, and
who needed extraordinary consolation, that, after having denied Christ,
he might not be altogether overwhelmed with despair.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p11"></span><span id="ii.xxviii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p12"></span>**<span
id="ii.xxviii-p12.2"></span>[Luke
22:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.xxviii-p12.2"></span>.** *Lo*, *Satan hath desired.* The other
two Evangelists relate more briefly and simply, that our Lord foretold
to his disciples their fall. But the words of Luke contain more abundant
instruction; for Christ does not speak of the future trouble in the way
of narrative, but expressly declares, that they will have a contest with
*Satan,* and, at the same *time,* promises to them victory. It is a
highly useful admonition, whenever we meet with any thing that gives us
offense, to have always before our eyes the snares of *Satan;* as Paul
also teaches, that

<span id="ii.xxviii-p13"></span>we wrestle not with flesh and blood, but
with spiritual armies,  
(<span id="ii.xxviii-p13.2"></span>[Eph
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.xxviii-p13.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xxviii-p14"></span>The meaning of the words therefore is:
“When, a short time hence, you shall see me oppressed, know that *Satan*
employs these arms to fight against you, and that this is a convenient
opportunity for destroying your faith.” I have said that this is a
useful doctrine, because it frequently happens that, from want of
consideration, we are overcome by disregarding temptations, which we
would regard as formidable, if we reflected that they are *the fiery
darts* (<span id="ii.xxviii-p14.1"></span>[Eph
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.xxviii-p14.1"></span>) of a vigorous and powerful enemy. And
though he now speaks of that singularly fierce attack, by which the
disciples, at one time, received dreadful shocks, so that their faith
was well nigh extinguished, yet he manifestly conveys a more extensive
doctrine, that *Satan* continually goes about, roaring for his prey. As
he is impelled by such furious madness to destroy us, nothing is more
unreasonable than that we should give ourselves up to drowsiness. Before
there is apparent necessity for fighting, let us already prepare
ourselves; for we know that *Satan* desires our destruction, and with
great skill and assiduity seizes on every method of injuring us. And
when we come to the conflict, let us know that all temptations, from
whatever quarter they come, were forged in the workshop of that enemy.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p15"></span>*That he may sift you as wheat.* The
metaphor of *sifting* is not in every respect applicable; for we have
elsewhere seen that the Gospel is compared to a *winnowing-fan* or
*sieve,* by which the *wheat* is purified from the *chaff* (<span
id="ii.xxviii-p15.1"></span>[Mt
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.xxviii-p15.1"></span>;) but here it simply means to toss up and
down, or to shake with violence, because the apostles were driven about
with unusual severity by the death of Christ. This ought to be
understood, because there is nothing in which Satan takes less delight
than the *purification* of believers. Yet though it be for a different
purpose that he shakes them, it is nevertheless true, that they are
driven and tossed about in every direction, just as the *wheat* is
shaken by the *winnowing-fan.* But we shall shortly afterwards see that
a still more disastrous fulfillment of these words was experienced by
the disciples. And this is what is meant by the words of our Lord, as
related by Matthew and Mark: *you will all be offended at me.* They mean
that the disciples will not only be attacked, but will nearly give way;
because the ignominious treatment of Christ will quite overpower their
minds. For whereas it was their duty to advance steadily with their
Master to the cross, fear kept them back. Their infirmity is thus
exhibited to them, that by prayers and groans they may betake themselves
to God’s holy protection.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p16"></span><span id="ii.xxviii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p17"></span>**<span
id="ii.xxviii-p17.2"></span>[Matthew
26:31](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.xxviii-p17.2"></span>.** *For it is written.* By this prediction
he encourages them to rise above the offense, because God does not cease
to recognize as his *sheep* those who are driven out and scattered in
every direction for a time. After having treated of the restoration of
the Church, the prophet, in order to prevent the minds of the godly from
being overwhelmed with despair by the extreme distresses which were
already at hand, declares, that when the government has been brought
into a state of confusion, or even completely overturned, there will be
a sad and miserable dispersion, but yet the grace of God will be
victorious. And though almost all commentators confine the passage in
<span id="ii.xxviii-p17.3"></span>[Zec
13:7](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#007.md)<span id="ii.xxviii-p17.3"></span>
to the person of Christ alone, yet I extend it farther, as meaning that
a government, on which the salvation of the people depends, will no
longer exist, because the *shepherds* will be driven from the midst of
them. I have no doubt that the Lord intended to include that whole
period during which, after the tyranny of Antiochus, the Church was
deprived of good *shepherds,* and reduced to a state of desolation; for
at that time God permitted the sword to commit fearful devastation, and,
by slaying the *shepherds,* to throw the people into a state of wretched
confusion. And yet this *scattering* did not prevent the Lord from
gathering his *sheep* at length, by *stretching out his hand* towards
them.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p18"></span>But though the prophet utters a general
threatening that the Church will be deprived of *shepherds,* still this
is justly and properly applied to Christ. For since he was the prince of
all the *shepherds,* on whom alone the salvation of the Church depended,
when he was dead, it might be thought that all hope was utterly gone.
And, indeed, it was an extremity of temptation, when the Redeemer, who
was the breath and life of his people, after having begun to collect the
flock of God, was suddenly dragged to death. But so much the more
strikingly was the grace of God displayed, when out of dispersion and
death the remaining flock was again assembled in a wonderful manner.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p19"></span>Thus we see, that Christ quoted this
passage appropriately, that the disciples might not be too much alarmed
by the future dispersion, and yet that, aware of their own weakness,
they might rely on their *Shepherd.* The meaning therefore is: “Not
having yet felt your weakness, you imagine that you are sufficiently
vigorous and powerful; but it will soon be apparent that the prediction
of Zechariah is true, that, *when the shepherd is slain, the flock will
be scattered.* But yet let the promise which is added exhilarate and
support you, that God will *stretch out his hand,* to bring back to Him
the *scattered sheep.*” We are here taught, that there is no unity that
brings salvation but that which keeps the *sheep* united under Christ’s
crook.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p20"></span>**32** *But after I have risen.* He now
expresses more clearly — what I lately hinted — that the disciples,
struck with dread, will resemble for a short time *scattered* and
wandering *sheep,* but will at length be brought back to the fold. For
Christ does not simply say that *he will rise again,* but promises to be
their leader, and takes them for his companions, as if they had never
swerved from their allegiance to him; and, to impart to them greater
confidence, he mentions the place where they will again meet; as if he
had said, “You, who are *scattered* at Jerusalem, will be again
assembled by me in *Galilee.*”

<span id="ii.xxviii-p21"></span><span id="ii.xxviii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxviii-p22"></span>**33.** *Peter answering.* Though
*Peter* uses no hypocrisy, but speaks with sincere affection, yet as a
false confidence in his virtue carries him away into foolish boasting,
he is justly reproved by Christ, and shortly afterwards is severely
punished for his rashness. Thus the event showed, that *Peter* promised
more for himself than he was able to accomplish, because he had not been
sufficiently careful to examine himself. Hence too we see more clearly,
how stupid is the intoxication of human presumption, that, when he is
again reminded of his weakness by the Son of God, and that with the
solemnity of an oath, he is so far from yielding, or even from making
any abatement of his foolish confidence, that he goes on to show those
lofty pretensions with more fierceness than ever.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p23"></span>But it is asked, Had not *Peter* a right
to hope what he promises for himself? and was he not even bound, relying
on the promise of Christ, to make this promise for himself? I answer,
When Christ formerly promised to his disciples the spirit of unshaken
fortitude, he referred to a new state of things which followed the
resurrection; and, therefore, as they were not yet endued with heavenly
power, *Peter,* forming confident expectations from himself, goes beyond
the limits of faith. He erred in two respects. First, by anticipating
the time he made a rash engagement, and did not rely on the promise of
the Lord. Secondly, shutting his eyes on his own weakness, and under the
influence of thoughtlessness rather than of courage, he undertook more
than the case, warranted.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p24"></span>This claims our attention, that every
man, remembering his own weakness, may earnestly resort to the
assistance of the Holy Spirit; and next, that no man may venture to take
more upon himself than what the Lord promises. Believers ought, indeed,
to be prepared for the contest in such a manner that, entertaining no
doubt or uncertainty about the result and the victory, they may resist
fear; for trembling and excessive anxiety are marks of distrust. But, on
the other hand, they ought to guard against that stupidity which shakes
off all anxiety, and fills their minds with pride, and extinguishes the
desire to pray. This middle course between two faulty extremes  <span
id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) is very beautifully expressed by Paul,
when he enjoins us to

<span id="ii.xxviii-p26"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxviii-p27"></span>work out our salvation with fear and
trembling, because it is God that worketh in us to will and perform,  
(<span id="ii.xxviii-p27.2"></span>[Phil.
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.xxviii-p27.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xxviii-p28"></span>For, on the one hand, having humbled us,
he entreats us to seek supplies elsewhere; and, on the other hand, lest
anxiety should induce sloth, he exhorts us to strenuous exertions. And,
therefore, whenever any temptation is presented to us, let us first
remember our weakness, that, being entirely thrown down, we may learn to
seek elsewhere what we need; and, next, let us remember the grace which
is promised, that it may free us from doubt. For those who, forgetting
their weakness, and not calling on God, feel assured that they are
strong, act entirely like drunken soldiers, who throw themselves rashly
into the field, but, as soon as the effects of strong drink are worn
off, think of nothing else than flight.

<span id="ii.xxviii-p29"></span>It is wonderful that the other
disciples, after *Peter* had been reproved, still break out into the
same rashness; and hence it is evident how little they knew themselves.
We are taught by this example, that we ought to attempt nothing, except
so far as God stretches out his hand; for nothing is more fading or
transitory than inconsiderate zeal. The disciples perceive that nothing
is more base or unreasonable than to forsake their Master; and,
therefore, they justly detest so infamous an action: but, having no
reliance on the promise, and neglecting prayer, they advance with
inconsiderate haste to boast of a constancy which they did not possess.
