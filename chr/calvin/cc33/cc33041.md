<span id="ii.xl-p15"></span>**<span id="ii.xl-p15.2"></span>[Matthew
27:33](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#033.md)<span id="ii.xl-p15.2"></span>.**
*And they came to the place.* Jesus was *brought to the place* where it
was customary to execute criminals, that his death might be more
ignominious. Now though this was done according to custom, still we
ought to consider the loftier purpose of God; for he determined that his
Son should be cast out of the city as unworthy of human intercourse,
that he might admit us into his heavenly kingdom with the angels. For
this reason the apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrews, (<span
id="ii.xl-p15.3"></span>[Heb
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#012)<span id="ii.xl-p15.3"></span>,.md)
refers it to an ancient figure of the law. For as God commanded his
people to *burn without the camp* the bodies of those animals, the blood
of which was carried into the sanctuary to make atonement for sins,
(<span id="ii.xl-p15.4"></span>[Ex
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#014.md)<span id="ii.xl-p15.4"></span>;
<span id="ii.xl-p15.5"></span>[Le
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#027)<span id="ii.xl-p15.5"></span>;.md)
so he says that Christ went out of the gate of the city, that, by taking
upon him the curse which pressed us down, he might be regarded as
accursed, and might in this manner atone for our sins.  <span
id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) Now the greater the ignominy and
disgrace which he endured before the world, so much the more acceptable
and noble a spectacle did he exhibit in his death to God and to the
angels. For the infamy of the place did not hinder him from erecting
there a splendid trophy of his victory; nor did the offensive smell of
the carcasses which lay there hinder the sweet savor of his sacrifice
from diffusing itself throughout the whole world, and penetrating even
to heaven.

<span id="ii.xl-p17"></span><span id="ii.xl-p17.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p18"></span>**34.** *And they gave him vinegar.*
Although the Evangelists are not so exact in placing each matter in its
due order, as to enable us to fix the precise moment at which the events
occurred; yet I look upon it as a probable conjecture that, before our
Lord was elevated on the cross, there was offered to him in a cup,
according to custom, *wine mingled with myrrh,* or some other mixture,
which appears to have been compounded of *gall and vinegar.* It is
sufficiently agreed, indeed, among nearly all interpreters, that this
draught was different from that which is mentioned by John, (<span
id="ii.xl-p18.2"></span>[Joh
14:29](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#029)<span id="ii.xl-p18.2"></span>,.md)
and of which we shall speak very soon. I only add, that I consider the
cup to have been offered to our Lord when he was about to be crucified;
but that after the cross was lifted up, *a sponge* was then dipped and
given to him. At what time he began to ask something to drink, I am not
very anxious to inquire; but when we compare all the circumstances, it
is not unreasonable to suppose that, after he had refused that bitter
mixture, it was frequently in derision presented to his lips. For we
shall find Matthew afterwards adding that the soldiers, while they were
giving him to drink, upbraided him for not being able to rescue himself
from death. Hence we infer that, while the remedy was offered, they
ridiculed the weakness of Christ, because he had complained that he was
forsaken by God, (<span id="ii.xl-p18.3"></span>[Mt
27:49](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#049)<span id="ii.xl-p18.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xl-p19"></span>As to the Evangelist John’s narrative, it is
only necessary to understand that Christ requested that some ordinary
beverage might be given him to assuage his thirst, but that *vinegar,
mingled with myrrh and gall,* was attempted to be forced upon him for
hastening his death. But he patiently bore his torments, so that the
lingering pain did not lead him to desire that his death should be
hastened; for even this was a part of his sacrifice and obedience, to
endure to the very last the lingering exhaustion.

<span id="ii.xl-p20"></span>They are mistaken, in my opinion, who look
upon the *vinegar* as one of the torments which were cruelly inflicted
on the Son of God. There is greater probability in the conjecture of
those who think that this kind of beverage had a tendency to promote the
evacuation of blood, and that on this account it was usually given to
malefactors, for the purpose of accelerating their death. Accordingly,
Mark calls it *wine mingled with myrrh.* Now Christ, as I have just now
hinted, was not led to refuse the *wine* or *vinegar* so much by a
dislike of its bitterness, as by a desire to show that he advanced
calmly to death, according to the command of the Father, and that he did
not rush on heedlessly through want of patience for enduring pain. Nor
is this inconsistent with what John says, that the Scripture was
fulfilled, *In my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.* For the two
accounts perfectly agree with each other; that a remedy was given to him
in order to put an end to the torments of a lingering death, and yet
that Christ was in every respect treated with harshness, so that the
very alleviation was a part, or rather was an augmentation, of his pain.

<span id="ii.xl-p21"></span><span id="ii.xl-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p22"></span>**35.** *They parted his garments.* It is
certain that the soldiers did this also according to custom, in dividing
among themselves the clothes of a man who had been condemned to die. One
circumstance was perhaps peculiar, that *they cast lots* on a *coat*
which *was without seam,* (<span id="ii.xl-p22.2"></span>[Joh
19:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#023)<span id="ii.xl-p22.2"></span>..md)
But though nothing happened to Christ in this respect but what was done
to all who were condemned to die, still this narrative deserves the
utmost attention. For the Evangelists exhibit to us the Son of God
stripped of his garments, in order to inform us, that by this nakedness
we have obtained those riches which make us honorable in the presence of
God. God determined that his own Son should be stripped of his raiment,
that we, clothed with his righteousness and with abundance of all good
things, may appear with boldness in company with the angels, whereas
formerly our loathsome and disgraceful aspect, in tattered garments,
kept us back from approaching to heaven. Christ himself permitted his
garments to be torn in pieces like a prey, that he might enrich us with
the riches of his victory.

<span id="ii.xl-p23"></span>*That it might be fulfilled which was spoken
by the prophet.* When Matthew says that thus was fulfilled the
prediction of David,

<span id="ii.xl-p24"></span>they part my garments among them, and cast
the lot upon my vesture,  
(<span id="ii.xl-p24.2"></span>[Ps
22:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#018)<span id="ii.xl-p24.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="ii.xl-p25"></span>we must understand his meaning to be, that
what David complained of, as having been done to himself metaphorically
and figuratively, was literally, (as the common phrase is,) and in
reality, exhibited in Christ. For by the word *garments* David means his
wealth and honors; as if he had said that, during his life, and under
his own eyes, he was prey to enemies, who had robbed his house, and were
so far from sparing the rest of his property, that they even carried off
his wife. This cruelty is represented even more strikingly by the
metaphor, when he says that *his garments were divided by lot.* Now as
he was a shadow and image of Christ, he predicted, by the spirit of
prophecy, what Christ was to suffer. In his person, therefore, this is
worthy of observation, that the soldiers plundered his raiment, because
in this pillage we discern the signs and marks by which he was formerly
pointed out. It serves also to remove the offense with which the sense
of the flesh might otherwise have regarded his nakedness, since he
suffered nothing which the Holy Spirit does not declare to belong truly
and properly to the person of the Redeemer.

<span id="ii.xl-p26"></span><span id="ii.xl-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p27"></span>**<span id="ii.xl-p27.2"></span>[Mark
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#025.md)<span id="ii.xl-p27.2"></span>**
*And it was the third hour.* This appears not to agree well with the
testimony of the Evangelist John; for he relates that Christ was
condemned *about the sixth hour,* (<span id="ii.xl-p27.3"></span>[Mr
14:14](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#014)<span id="ii.xl-p27.3"></span>..md)
But if we consider—what is evident from other passages—that the day was
divided into four parts, and that each of the parts took its name from
the first hour of its commencement, the solution will not be difficult.
The whole time, from sunrise to the second part of the day, they called
*the first* hour. The second part, which lasted till noon, was called by
them the *third* hour. The *sixth* hour commenced at noon, and lasted
till three or four o’clock in the afternoon. Thus, when the Jews saw
that Pilate was wearing out the time, and that the hour of noon was
approaching, John *says* that *they cried out* the more vehemently, that
the whole day might not be allowed to pass without something being done,
(<span id="ii.xl-p27.4"></span>[Mr
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#015)<span id="ii.xl-p27.4"></span>..md)
But this is not inconsistent with the assertion, that our Lord was
crucified about the close of *the third hour;* for it is plain enough,
that no sooner was he hastily condemned, than he was immediately
executed; so eager was the desire of the Jews to put him to death. Mark
therefore means not the beginning, but the close, of the third hour; and
it is highly probable that Christ did not hang on the cross longer than
three hours.

<span id="ii.xl-p28"></span><span id="ii.xl-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p29"></span>**<span id="ii.xl-p29.2"></span>[Luke
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034.md)<span id="ii.xl-p29.2"></span>.**
*And Jesus said, Father, forgive them.* By this expression Christ gave
evidence that he was that mild and gentle lamb, which was to be led out
to be sacrificed, as Isaiah the prophet had foretold, (<span
id="ii.xl-p29.3"></span>[Isa 53:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.xl-p29.3"></span>.) For not only does he abstain from revenge,
but pleads with God the Father for the salvation of those by whom he is
most cruelly tormented. It would have been a great matter not to think
of *rendering evil for evil,* (<span id="ii.xl-p29.4"></span>[1Pe
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#009)<span id="ii.xl-p29.4"></span>;.md) as
Peter, when he exhorts us to patience by the example of Christ, says
that he did not render curses for curses, and did not revenge the
injuries done to him, but was fully satisfied with having God for his
avenger (<span id="ii.xl-p29.5"></span>[1Pe
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023)<span id="ii.xl-p29.5"></span>..md)
But this is a far higher and more excellent virtue, to pray that God
would *forgive* his enemies.

<span id="ii.xl-p30"></span>If any one think that this does not agree
well with Peter’s sentiment, which I have just now quoted, the answer is
easy. For when Christ was moved by a feeling of compassion to ask
forgiveness from God for his persecutors, this did not hinder him from
acquiescing in the righteous judgment of God, which he knew to be
ordained for reprobate and obstinate men. Thus when Christ saw that both
the Jewish people and the soldiers raged against him with blind fury,
though their ignorance was not excusable, he had pity on them, and
presented himself as their intercessor. Yet knowing that God would be an
avenger, he left to him the exercise of judgment against the desperate.
In this manner ought believers also to restrain their feelings in
enduring distresses, so as to desire the salvation of their persecutors,
and yet to rest assured that their life is under the protection of God,
and, relying on this consolation, that the licentiousness of wicked men
will not in the end remain unpunished, not to faint under the burden of
the cross.

<span id="ii.xl-p31"></span>Of this moderation Luke now presents an
instance in our Leader and Master; for though he might have denounced
perdition against his persecutors, he not only abstained from cursing,
but even prayed for their welfare. But it ought to be observed that,
when the whole world rises against us, and all unite in striving to
crush us, the best remedy for over-coming temptation is, to recall to
our remembrance the blindness of those who fight against God in our
persons. For the result will be, that the conspiracy of many persons
against us, when solitary and deserted, will not distress us beyond
measure; as, on the other hand, daily experience shows how powerfully it
acts in shaking weak persons, when they see themselves attacked by a
great multitude. And, therefore, if we learn to raise our minds to God,
it will be easy for us to look down, as it were, from above, and despise
the ignorance of unbelievers; for whatever may be their strength and
resources, still *they know not what they do.*

<span id="ii.xl-p32"></span>It is probable, however, that Christ did not
pray for all indiscriminately, but only for the wretched multitude, who
were carried away by inconsiderate zeal, and not by premeditated
*wickedness.* For since the scribes and priests were persons in regard
to whom no ground was left for hope, it would have been in vain for him
to pray for them. Nor can it be doubted that this prayer was heard by
the heavenly Father, and that this was the cause why many of the people
afterwards drank by faith the blood which they had shed.

<span id="ii.xl-p33"></span><span id="ii.xl-p33.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p34"></span> **<span id="ii.xl-p34.2"></span>[Matthew
27:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#037.md)<span id="ii.xl-p34.2"></span>.**
*And placed over his head.* What is briefly noticed by Matthew and Mark
is more fully related by Luke, (<span id="ii.xl-p34.3"></span>[Lu
23:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#038)<span id="ii.xl-p34.3"></span>,.md)
that the inscription was written in three languages. John also describes
it *more* largely, (<span id="ii.xl-p34.4"></span>[Joh
14:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.xl-p34.4"></span>.) Under this passage my readers will find what
I pass over here for the sake of brevity. I shall only say, that it did
not happen without the providence of God, that the death of Christ was
made known in three languages. Though Pilate had no other design than to
bring reproach and infamy on the Jewish nation, yet God had a higher end
in view; for by this presage he caused it to be widely known that the
death of his Son would be highly celebrated, so that all nations would
everywhere acknowledge that he was *the King* promised to *the Jews.*
This was not, indeed, the lawful preaching of the Gospel, for Pilate was
unworthy to be employed by God as a witness for his Son; but what was
afterwards to be accomplished by the true ministers was prefigured in
Pilate. In short, we may look upon him to be a herald of Christ in the
same sense that Caiaphas was a prophet, (<span
id="ii.xl-p34.5"></span>[Joh
11:51](../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#051)<span id="ii.xl-p34.5"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xl-p35"></span><span id="ii.xl-p35.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xl-p36"></span>**38.** *Then were crucified with him two
robbers.* It was the finishing stroke of the lowest disgrace when Christ
was executed between *two robbers;* for they assigned him the most
prominent place, as if’ he had been the prince of *robbers.* If he had
been *crucified* apart from the other malefactors, there might have
appeared to be a distinction between his case and theirs; but now he is
not only confounded with them, but raised aloft, as if he had been by
far the most detestable of all. On this account Mark applies to him the
prediction of Isaiah, (<span id="ii.xl-p36.2"></span>[Isa
53:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012)<span id="ii.xl-p36.2"></span>.md)
*he was reckoned among transgressors;* for the prophet expressly says
concerning Christ, that he will deliver his people, not by pomp and
splendor, but because he will endure the punishment clue to their sins.
In order that he might free us from condemnation, this kind of expiation
was necessary, that he might place himself in, our room. Here we
perceive how dreadful is the weight of the wrath of God against sins,
for appeasing which it became necessary that Christ, who is eternal
justice, should be ranked with robbers. We see, also, the inestimable
love of Christ towards us, who, in order that he might admit us to the
society of the holy angels, permitted himself to be classed as one of
the wicked.
