God. **20. **And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working

Bethany, and lifted up his hands, and blessed them. **51. **And it came
to pass that, while he was blessing them, he withdrew from them, and was
carried up into heaven. **52. **And having worshipped him, they returned
to Jerusalem with great joy, **53. **And were always in the temple,
praising and blessing God. Amen.

<span id="ii.lii-p8"></span>**<span id="ii.lii-p8.1"></span>[Mark
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019.md)<span id="ii.lii-p8.1"></span>.**
*And after the Lord had thus spoken to them.* The Evangelist Matthew,
having extolled in magnificent language the reign of Christ over the
whole world, says nothing about his ascension to heaven. Mark, too,
takes no notice of the place and the manner, both of which are described
by Luke; for he says that *the disciples were led out to Bethany,* that
from *the Mount of Olives,* (<span id="ii.lii-p8.2"></span>[Mt
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003)<span id="ii.lii-p8.2"></span>,.md)
whence he had descended to undergo the ignominy of the cross, he might
ascend the heavenly throne. Now as he did not, after his resurrection,
appear indiscriminately to all, so he did not permit all to be the
witnesses of his ascension to heaven; for he intended that this mystery
of faith should be known by the preaching of the gospel rather than
beheld by the eyes.

<span id="ii.lii-p9"></span><span id="ii.lii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lii-p10"></span>**<span id="ii.lii-p10.2"></span>[Luke
24:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050.md)<span
id="ii.lii-p10.2"></span>.** *And lifted up his hands, and blessed
them;* by which he showed that the office of *blessing,* which was
enjoined on the priests under the law, belonged truly and properly to
himself. When men *bless* one another it is nothing else than praying in
behalf of their brethren; but with God it is otherwise, for he does not
merely befriend us by wishes, but by a simple act of his will grants
what is desirable for us. But while He is the only Author of all
blessing, yet that men might obtain a familiar view of his grace, he
chose that at first the priests should *bless* in his name as mediators.
Thus Melchizedek *blessed* Abraham, (<span id="ii.lii-p10.3"></span>[Ge
14:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#019)<span id="ii.lii-p10.3"></span>,.md)
and in <span id="ii.lii-p10.4"></span>[Nu
6:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/num006.htm#023.md)<span
id="ii.lii-p10.4"></span>, a perpetual law is laid down in reference to
this matter. To this purport also is what we read in <span
id="ii.lii-p10.5"></span>[Ps
118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md)<span id="ii.lii-p10.5"></span>,
We *bless you out of the house of the Lord* In short, the apostle has
told us that *to bless* others is a Mark of superiority; for *the less,*
he says, *is blessed by the greater,* (<span
id="ii.lii-p10.6"></span>[Heb 7:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb007.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.lii-p10.6"></span>.) Now when Christ, the true *Melchizedek* and
eternal Priest, was manifested, it was necessary that in him should be
fulfilled what had been shadowed out by the figures of the law; as Paul
also shows that we are *blessed* in him by God the Father, that we may
be rich in all heavenly blessings, (<span id="ii.lii-p10.7"></span>[Eph
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#003)<span id="ii.lii-p10.7"></span>..md)
Openly and solemnly he once *blessed* the apostles, that believers may
go direct to himself, if they desire to be partakers of his grace. In
*the lifting up of the hands* is described an ancient ceremony which, we
know:, was formerly used by the priests.

<span id="ii.lii-p11"></span><span id="ii.lii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lii-p12"></span>**52.** *And* *having worshipped him, they
returned.* By the word *worship,* Luke means, first, that the apostles
were relieved from all doubt, because at that time the majesty of Christ
shone on all sides, so that there was no longer any room for doubting of
his resurrection; and, secondly, that for the same reason they began to
honor him with greater reverence than when they enjoyed his society on
earth. For the *worship* which is here mentioned was rendered to him not
only as Master or Prophet, nor even as the Messiah, whose character had
been but half known, but as the King of glory and the Judge of the
world. Now as Luke intended to give a longer narrative, he only states
briefly what the apostles did during ten days. The amount of what is
said is, that through *the fervor of their joy* they broke out openly
into the *praises of God, and were continually in the temple;* not that
they remained there by day and by night, but that they attended the
public assemblies, and were present at the ordinary and stated hours to
*render thanksgiving to* God. This *joy* is contrasted with the fear
which formerly kept them retired and concealed at home.

<span id="ii.lii-p13"></span><span id="ii.lii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.lii-p14"></span>**<span id="ii.lii-p14.2"></span>[Mark
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.lii-p14.2"></span>.** *And sat down at the right hand of God.* In
other passages I have explained what is meant by this expression,
namely, that Christ was raised on high, that he might be exalted above
angels and all creatures; that by his agency the Father might govern the
world, and, in short, that *before him every knee might bow,* (<span
id="ii.lii-p14.3"></span>[Php
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010)<span id="ii.lii-p14.3"></span>..md)
It is the same as if he were called God’s Deputy, to represent the
person of God; and, therefore, we must not imagine to ourselves any one
place, since *the right hand* is a metaphor which denotes the power that
is next to God. This was purposely added by Mark, in order to inform us
that Christ *was taken up into heaven,* not to enjoy blessed rest at a
distance from us, but to govern the world for the salvation of all
believers.

<span id="ii.lii-p15"></span>**20.** *And they went out and preached.*
Mark here notices briefly those events of which Luke continues the
history in his second book  <span id="fr_324"></span>[325](#fn_324.md) that
the voice of a small and dispersed body of men resounded even to the
extremities of the world. For exactly in proportion as the fact was less
credible, so much the more manifestly was there displayed in it a
miracle of heavenly power. Every person would have thought that, by the
death of the cross, Christ would either be altogether extinguished, or
so completely overwhelmed, that he would never be again mentioned but
with shame and loathing. The apostles, whom he had chosen to be his
witnesses, had basely deserted him, and had betaken themselves to
darkness and concealment. Such was their ignorance and want of
education, and such was the contempt in which they were held, that they
hardly ventured to utter a word in public. Was it to be expected that
men who were unlearned, and were held in no esteem, and had even
deserted their Master, should, by the sound of their voice, reduce so
many scattered nations into subjection to him who had been crucified?
There is great emphasis, therefore, in the words, *they went out and
preached everywhere* — *men* who but lately shut themselves up,
trembling and silent, in their prison. For it was impossible that so
sudden a change should be accomplished in a moment by human power; and
therefore Mark adds,

<span id="ii.lii-p18"></span>*The Lord working with them;* by which he
means that this was truly a divine work. And yet by this mode of
expression he does not represent them as sharing their work or labor
with the grace of God, as if they contributed any thing to it of
themselves; but simply means that they were assisted by God, because,
according to the flesh, they would in vain have attempted what was
actually performed by them. The ministers of the word, I acknowledge,
are called *fellow-workers with God,* (<span
id="ii.lii-p18.1"></span>[1Co 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.lii-p18.1"></span>,) because he makes use of their agency; but we
ought to understand that they have no power beyond what he bestows, and
that by *planting and watering* they do no good, unless the increase
come from the secret efficacy of the Spirit.

<span id="ii.lii-p19"></span>*And confirming the word.* Here, in my
opinion, Mark points out a particular instance of what he had just now
stated in general terms; for there were other methods by which the Lord
*wrought with them,* that the preaching of the gospel might not be
fruitless; but this was a striking proof of his assistance, that he
confirmed their doctrine by miracles. Now this passage shows what use we
ought to make of miracles, if we do not choose to apply them to perverse
corruptions; namely, that they aid the gospel. Hence it follows that
God’s holy order is subverted, if miracles are separated from the word
of God, to which they are appendages; and if they are employed to adorn
wicked doctrines, or to disguise corrupt modes of worship.
