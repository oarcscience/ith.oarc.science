him, Put thy sword again into its place; for all who take the sword

thus far; and, having touched his ear, he healed him. **52. **And Jesus
said to those who had come to him, the chief priests, and rulers of the
temple, and elders, Are you come out, as against a robber, with swords
and clubs? **53. **When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not
lay hands on me; but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p10"></span> 

<span id="ii.xxxii-p11"></span><span id="ii.xxxii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxii-p12"></span>**<span
id="ii.xxxii-p12.2"></span>[Matthew
26:51](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#051.md)<span
id="ii.xxxii-p12.2"></span>.** *And, lo, one of those who were with
Jesus.* Luke says, that all the disciples made an agreement together to
fight for their Master. Hence it is again evident, that we are much more
courageous and ready for fighting than for bearing the cross; and,
therefore, we ought always to deliberate wisely what the Lord commands,
and what he requires from every one of us, lest the fervor of our zeal
exceed the bounds of reason and moderation. When the disciples asked
Christ, *Shall we strike with the sword?* they did so, not with the
intention of obeying his injunction; but by these words they declared
that they were prepared and ready to repel the violence of enemies. And,
indeed, Peter did not wait till he was commanded or permitted to strike,
but inconsiderately proceeded to unlawful violence. It appears, at first
view, to be praiseworthy valor in the disciples, that, forgetting their
own weakness, though they are unable to make resistance, they do not
hesitate to present their bodies before their Master, and to encounter
certain death; for they choose rather to perish with the Lord than to
survive and look on while he is oppressed. But as they improperly
attempt more than the calling of God commands or permits, their rashness
is justly condemned; and therefore let us learn, that in order that our
obedience may be acceptable to the Lord, we must depend on his will, so
that no man shall move a finger, except so far as God commands. One
reason ought, above all, to lead us to be zealous in cultivating this
modesty; which is, that instead of a proper and well-regulated zeal,
confused irregularity for the most part reigns in us.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p13"></span>Peter’s name is not mentioned here by the
Evangelists; but John (<span id="ii.xxxii-p13.1"></span>[Joh
18:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.xxxii-p13.1"></span>) assures us—and from what occurs shortly
afterwards in the narrative it is evident — that it was Peter who is
here described, though the name is suppressed. Yet Luke enables us
easily to infer that there were others also who took part in the same
outrage; for Christ does not speak to one person only, but says to all
alike, *Permit*  <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) *it to be thus
far.*

<span id="ii.xxxii-p15"></span><span id="ii.xxxii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxii-p16"></span>**52.** *Put thy sword again into its
place.* By these words, Christ confirms the precept of the Law, which
forbids private individuals to use the sword. And above all, we ought to
attend to the threatening of punishment which is immediately added; for
men did not, at their own pleasure, appoint this punishment for avenging
their own blood; but God himself, by severely prohibiting murder, has
declared how dearly he loves mankind. First, then, he does not choose to
be defended by force and violence, because God in the Law forbade men to
strike. This is a general reason; and he immediately descends to a
special reason.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p17"></span>But here a question arises. Is it never
lawful to use violence in repelling unjust violence? For though Peter
had to deal with wicked and base robbers, still he is condemned for
*having drawn his sword.* If, in such a case of moderate defense, an
exception was not allowed, Christ appears to tie up the hands of all.
Though we have treated this question more copiously  <span
id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) under <span
id="ii.xxxii-p18.2"></span>[Mt
5:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#039.md)<span id="ii.xxxii-p18.2"></span>,
yet I shall now state my opinion again in a few words. First, we must
make a distinction between a civil court and the court of conscience;
 <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) for if any man resist a robber,
 <span id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) he will not be liable to public
punishment, because the laws arm him against one who is the common enemy
of mankind. Thus, in every case when defense is made against unjust
violence, the punishment which God enjoins earthly judges to carry into
execution ceases. And yet it is not the mere goodness of the cause that
acquits the conscience from guilt, unless there be also pure affection.
So then, in order that a man may properly and lawfully defend himself,
he must first lay aside excessive wrath, and hatred, and desire of
revenge, and all irregular sallies of passion, that nothing tempestuous
may mingle with the defense. As this is of rare occurrence, or rather,
as it scarcely ever happens, Christ properly reminds his people of the
general rule, that they should entirely abstain from using *the sword.*

<span id="ii.xxxii-p21"></span>But there are fanatics who have foolishly
misapplied this passage, so as to wrest the sword out of the hands of
judges. They contend that it is unlawful to strike with *the sword.*
This I acknowledge to be true, for no man is at liberty to take *the
sword* at his own pleasure, so as to commit murder; but I deny that
magistrates—who are God’s ministers, and by whom he executes his
judgments—ought to be viewed as belonging to the ordinary rank. And not
only so, but by these words of Christ, this very power is expressly
ascribed to them: for when he declares that murderers must be put to
death, it follows, that *the sword* is put into the hands of judges,
that they may take vengeance for unjust murders. It will sometimes
happen, indeed, that men addicted to the shedding of blood are punished
by other means; but this is the ordinary way in which the Lord
determined that the fierce cruelty of wicked men should be restrained
from rioting with impunity. Certain doctors of what is called Canon Law
have ventured to proceed to such a pitch of impudence as to teach, that
*the sword* was not taken from Peter, but he was commanded to keep it
sheathed until the time came for drawing it; and hence we perceive how
grossly and shamefully those dogs have sported with the word of God.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p22"></span><span id="ii.xxxii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxii-p23"></span>**53.** *Thinkest thou that I cannot now
pray to my Father?* Now follows that special reason which I mentioned a
little ago; for Christ reminds them, that he would have at his command a
better and more legitimate kind of defense, were it not that he must
obey the decree of the Father. The substance of what he says is this.
“As he has been appointed by the eternal purpose of God to be a
sacrifice, and as this has been declared by the predictions of
Scripture, he must not fight against it.” Thus Peter’s rashness is
condemned on another ground, that he not only endeavors to overturn a
heavenly decree, but also to obstruct the path of the redemption of
mankind. Not only did Peter *draw his sword* unlawfully, but the
disciples were foolish and mad; for—though they were few in number, and
feeble—they attempted to make some resistance to a band of soldiers and
a very great multitude. On this account, the Lord, in order to make
their folly more manifest, employs this comparison. “If he wished to
have a guard to defend his life, he would immediately obtain not eleven
*angels,* but a large and invincible army, and since he does not implore
that *angels* may be sent to assist him, much less would he resort to
ill-considered means, from which no advantage was to be expected; for
the utmost that could be effected by the disciples would be of no more
service than if a few rooks were to make a noise.”

<span id="ii.xxxii-p24"></span>But here some commentators labor to no
purpose in inquiring how Christ could have obtained a commission of
*angels* from *his Father,* by whose decree it was that he had to suffer
death. For the two things are inconsistent: that he exposed his Son to
death naked and defenseless, because it was necessary that it should be
so, and because it had been appointed; and yet, that he might have been
prevailed on by prayer to send him relief. But Christ speaks
conditionally, that he has a far better method of defending his life,
were it not that the will of *the Father* was opposed to it. This takes
away all contradiction, for Christ refrained from presenting such a
request to *his Father,* because he knew that it was contrary to his
decree. Yet from this we draw a useful doctrine, that those who resort
to unlawful means on the plea of necessity pour dishonor on God. If a
man is destitute of lawful aid and support, he runs headlong to wicked
schemes and sinful undertakings; and the reason is, that few look for
the secret protection of God, which alone ought to be sufficient to set
our minds at rest. Are we threatened with danger? Because no remedy can
be discovered according to the flesh, we make this or the other
contrivance, as if there were no *angels* in heaven, who — Scripture
frequently tells us — are placed as guardians *for our salvation,*
(<span id="ii.xxxii-p24.1"></span>[Heb
1:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.xxxii-p24.1"></span>.) In this way we deprive ourselves of their
assistance; for all who are impelled, by their restlessness and
excessive anxiety, to stretch out their hands to forbidden remedies for
evils, do unquestionably renounce the providence of God.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p25"></span><span id="ii.xxxii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxii-p26"></span>**54.** *How then shall the Scriptures be
fulfilled?* By this expression Christ means, that he ought not to
attempt any method of escaping death, to which he knew that he was
called by the Father. For himself, indeed, he had no need of *the
Scriptures* to inform him that God had appointed that he should die at
that time; but because mortals do not know what God has determined to do
until it be revealed by his word, Christ, with a view to his disciples,
properly refers to the testimony which God gave of his will. We know
that whatever affliction happens to us, it is inflicted by God himself;
but since we are uncertain as to the result, when we seek remedies which
he allows, we do not rise against his government; but when his will has
been ascertained, nothing more remains for us than to acquiesce. Though
in this passage Christ teaches nothing more than that he ought patiently
to suffer death, because *the Scriptures* have declared that it must be
so, yet the use of this doctrine is evidently more extensive, namely,
that Scripture is a sufficient bridle for subduing the rebellion of the
flesh; because God points out to us what is his. will for the very
purpose of keeping us in subjection to his will. Accordingly, Paul
ascribes to *Scripture* this office, that it trains us *to patience,*
(<span id="ii.xxxii-p26.1"></span>[Ro
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.xxxii-p26.1"></span>,) and supplies us with all the comfort that
we need in adversity. His reproof of the disciples, as given by Luke, is
more brief, *Permit them to do thus far;* but still he severely condemns
their presumption, in having gone so far as to perform an unlawful
action, though at the same time he holds out a hope of pardon, if they
suppress their improper zeal, and proceed no farther.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p27"></span><span id="ii.xxxii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxii-p28"></span>**<span id="ii.xxxii-p28.2"></span>[Luke
22:51](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#051.md)<span
id="ii.xxxii-p28.2"></span>.** *And having touched his ear, he healed
him.* By his foolish zeal Peter had brought grievous reproach on his
Master and his doctrine; and there can be no doubt, that this was a
contrivance by which Satan attempted to involve the Gospel in eternal
disgrace, as if Christ had kept company with assassins and seditious
persons for revolutionary purposes. This, I think, was the reason why
Christ healed the wound which Peter had inflicted. But a fearful and
amazing stupidity must have seized his adversaries, who were not at all
affected by having seen such a miracle. And yet there is the less reason
to wonder that they did not see the power of Christ displayed in the
person of another, when, after having themselves been laid prostrate by
his voice, they still continued to rage, (<span
id="ii.xxxii-p28.3"></span>[Joh
18:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.xxxii-p28.3"></span>.) Such is the spirit of giddiness by which
Satan maddens the reprobate, when the Lord has given them over to
blindness. Above all, in the person himself who was healed, there is a
striking instance of ingratitude; for neither did the divine power of
Christ subdue him to repentance for his hardness, nor was he overcome by
kindness so as to be changed from an enemy into a disciple. For it is a
foolish imagination of the monks that he was also *healed* in his soul,
that the work of Christ might not be left incomplete; as if the goodness
of God were not every day poured out on those who are unworthy.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p29"></span><span id="ii.xxxii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxii-p30"></span>**<span
id="ii.xxxii-p30.2"></span>[Matthew
26:55](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#055.md)<span
id="ii.xxxii-p30.2"></span>.** *Are you come out, as against a robber?*
By these words Christ expostulates with his enemies for having intended
to bring odium upon him, by coming provided with a great body of
soldiers; for the meaning is this, “What necessity was there for making
such a display of arms against me, as if your object had been to
overcome some robber? But I have always lived peaceably amongst you, and
without using arms; and when I was teaching in the temple, you might
easily have seized me without any military force.” Yet, while he
complains of their malice in violently rushing upon him, as if he were a
seditious man, he again wounds their evil conscience by reminding them,
that though they had a traitor for their leader, they approached him
with trembling, and with many marks of distrust.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p31"></span><span id="ii.xxxii-p31.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxii-p32"></span>**56.** *Now all this was done.* The
other two Evangelists express it somewhat differently; for what Matthew
relates in his own person, Mark appears to attribute to Christ.Luke
employs even different words: *this is your hour, and the power of
darkness.* But the design of the Holy Spirit is, beyond all doubt, that
whatever may be the contrivances of wicked men, nothing whatever has
been done but by the will and providence of God; for as he had said a
little before, God has testified nothing by the prophets but what he had
determined with himself, (<span id="ii.xxxii-p32.2"></span>[Lu
22:3](../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.xxxii-p32.2"></span>.) First, therefore, we are here informed,
that whatever may be the unbridled rage by which Satan and all ungodly
men are actuated, still the hand of God always prevails, so as to draw
them reluctantly wherever he pleases. Secondly, we are informed, that
though wicked men *fulfill* what was predicted in *the Scriptures;* yet,
since God does not employ them as his lawful ministers, but directs
them, by a secret movement, to that which was farthest from their wish,
they are not excusable; and that, while God makes a righteous use of
their malice, blame still attaches to them. At the same time, let us
observe that Christ said this in order to remove the offense, which
would otherwise have greatly disturbed weak minds, when they saw him so
reproached and outraged.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p33"></span>Still Christ intended not only to promote
the advantage of his disciples, but also to repress the pride of his
adversaries, that they might not triumph as if they had achieved
victory. For this reason, in Luke’s narrative he says, *this is your
hour;* by which he means that the Lord grants them this liberty for a
short time. *The power of darkness* denotes *the power* of the devil,
and this term had also a strong tendency to abase their glory; for
though they exalt themselves ever so much, Christ shows that they are
still nothing more than the slaves of the devil. While all things are
mingled in confusion, and while the devil, by spreading darkness abroad,
appears to overturn the whole order of the world, let us know that the
providence of God shines above in heaven, to bring at length to order
what is confused; and let us, therefore, learn to raise the eyes of
faith to that calm sky. *Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.*
Hence we may again infer how much more ready they were to fight rashly
than to follow their Master.

<span id="ii.xxxii-p34"></span><span id="ii.xxxii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xxxii-p35"></span>**<span id="ii.xxxii-p35.2"></span>[Mark
14:51](../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#051.md)<span
id="ii.xxxii-p35.2"></span>.** *And a young man.* How some persons have
come to dream that this was John  <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) I know not, nor is it of much
importance to inquire. The chief point is, to ascertain for what purpose
Mark has related this transaction. I think that his object was, to
inform us that those wicked men — as usually happens in riotous
assemblies stormed and raved without shame or modesty; which appeared
from their seizing *a young man* who was unknown to them, and not
suspected of any crime, so that he had difficulty in escaping out of
their hands *naked.* For it is probable that *the young man,* who is
mentioned, had some attachment to Christ, and, on hearing the tumult by
night, without stopping to put on his clothes, and covered only with a
linen garment, came either to discover their traps, or, at least, that
he might not be wanting in a duty of friendship.  <span
id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) We certainly perceive — as I just now
said — that those wicked men raged with cruel violence, when they did
not even spare a poor *young man,* who had left his bed, almost *naked,*
and run, on hearing the noise.
