<span id="ii.xx-p16"></span>**<span id="ii.xx-p16.2"></span>[Matthew
24:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#037.md)<span id="ii.xx-p16.2"></span>.**
*But as the days of Noah were.* Although Christ lately expressed his
desire to keep the minds of his followers in suspense, that they might
not inquire too anxiously about the last day; yet, lest the indifference
arising out of the enjoyments of the world should lull them to sleep, he
now exhorts them to solicitude. He wished them to be uncertain as to his
coming, but yet to be prepared to expect him every day, or rather every
moment.  <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) To shake off their
sloth, and to excite them more powerfully to be on their guard, he
foretells that the end will come, while the world is sunk in brutal
indifference; just as *in the days of Noah* all the nations were
swallowed up by *the deluge,* when they had no expectation of it, but
rioted in gluttony and voluptuousness, and shortly afterwards, the
inhabitants of *Sodom,* while they were abandoning themselves without
fear to sensuality, were consumed by fire from heaven. Since
indifference of this sort will exist about the time of the last day,
believers ought not to indulge themselves after the example of the
multitude.

<span id="ii.xx-p18"></span>We have now ascertained the design of
Christ, which was, to inform believers that, in order to prevent
themselves from being suddenly overtaken, they ought always to keep
watch, because the day of the last judgment will come when it is not
expected. Luke alone mentions *Sodom,* and that in the seventeenth
chapter, where he takes occasion, without attending to the order of
time, to relate this discourse of Christ. But it would not have been
improper that the two Evangelists should have satisfied themselves with
a single example, though Christ mentioned two, more especially when
those examples perfectly agreed with each other in this respect, that at
one time the whole human race, in the midst of unbroken indolence and
pleasure, was suddenly swallowed up,  <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) with the exception of a few
individuals. When he says that men were giving their whole attention to
*eating, drinking, marriage,* and other worldly employments, at the time
when God destroyed the whole world by *a deluge,* and *Sodom* by
thunder; these words mean that they were as fully occupied with the
conveniences and enjoyments of the present life, as if there had been no
reason to dread any change. And though we shall immediately find him
commanding the disciples to guard against *surfeiting* and earthly
cares, yet in this passage he does not directly condemn the
intemperance, but rather the obstinacy, of those times, in consequence
of which, they despised the threatenings of God, and awaited with
indifference their awful destruction. Promising to themselves that the
condition in which they then were would remain unchanged, they did not
scruple to follow without concern their ordinary pursuits. And in itself
it would not have been improper, or worthy of condemnation, to make
provision for their wants, if they had not with gross stupidity opposed
the judgment of God, and rushed, with closed eyes, to unbridled
iniquity, as if there had been no Judge in heaven. So now Christ
declares that the last age of the world will be in a state of stupid
indifference, so that men will think of nothing but the present life,
and will extend their cares to a long period, pursuing their ordinary
course of life, as if the world were always to remain in the same
condition. The comparisons are highly appropriate; for if we consider
what then happened, we shall no longer be deceived by the belief that
the uniform order of events which we see in the world will always
continue. For within three days of the time, when every man was
conducting his affairs in the utmost tranquillity, the world was
swallowed up by a deluge, and five cities were consumed by fire.

<span id="ii.xx-p20"></span><span id="ii.xx-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p21"></span>**39.** *And knew not until the deluge
came.* The source and cause of their ignorance was, that unbelief had
blinded their minds; as, on the other hand, we are informed by the
Apostle, that *Noah* beheld at a distance, by the eyes of *faith,* the
vengeance of God which was still concealed, so as to entertain an early
dread of it, (<span id="ii.xx-p21.2"></span>[Heb
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#007)<span id="ii.xx-p21.2"></span>..md)
And here Christ compares *Noah* with the rest of the world, and *Lot*
with *the inhabitants of Sodom,* that believers may learn to withdraw,
lest they wander and be cut off along with others. But it must be
observed that the reprobate, at that time, were hardened in their
wickedness, because the Lord did not show his grace to any but his
servants, by giving them a salutary warning to beware in proper time.
Not that information of the future deluge was altogether withheld from
the inhabitants of the world—before whose eyes *Noah,* in building the
ark for more than a hundred years, presented a warning of the
approaching calamity—but because one man was specially warned, by divine
revelation, of the future destruction of the whole world, and raised up
to cherish the hope of salvation. Though the report of the last judgment
is now widely circulated, and though there are a few persons who have
been taught by God to perceive that Christ will come as a Judge in due
time, *yet* it is proper that those persons should be aroused by this
extraordinary kindness of God, and that their senses should be
sharpened, lest they give themselves up to the indifference which so
generally prevails. For Peter compares the ark of *Noah* with our
*baptism* on this ground, that a small company of men, separated from
the multitude, is *saved* amidst the waters, (<span
id="ii.xx-p21.3"></span>[1 Pet. 3:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#021)<span id="ii.xx-p21.3"></span>..md) To
this small number, therefore, our minds must be directed, if we desire
to escape in safety.

<span id="ii.xx-p22"></span><span id="ii.xx-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p23"></span>**40.** *Two men shall then be in the
field.* Before mentioning this, Luke inserts some sentences; the first
of which is presented by Matthew as belonging to the destruction of
Jerusalem, *Let not him who shall be on the house-top go down into his
house to carry away his furniture.* But it is possible that Christ
applied the same words to various subjects. Luke states also a warning,
that the disciples should *remember Lot’s wife;* that is, that they
should *forget those things which are behind,* (<span
id="ii.xx-p23.2"></span>[Php 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.xx-p23.2"></span>) and advance towards the end of the heavenly
calling. For *Lot’s wife* was changed into *a pillar of salt,* (<span
id="ii.xx-p23.3"></span>[Ge 19:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.xx-p23.3"></span>,) because, hesitating whether there were good
reasons for departing from the city, she *looked behind her,* by which
she gave the lie to the heavenly oracle. Perhaps, too, regret at leaving
her nest, in which she had dwelt with comfort, induced her to turn her
head. Since, therefore, God intended that she should remain as an
everlasting demonstration, our minds ought to be strengthened by the
constancy of faith, that they may not hesitate and give way in the
middle of the course; and they ought also to be trained to perseverance,
in order that, bidding adieu to the fascinations of a transitory life,
they may rise cheerfully and willingly towards heaven.

<span id="ii.xx-p24"></span>Luke adds a third sentence, *whosoever shall
seek to save his soul will lose it,* that the desire of an earthly life
may not prevent believers from passing rapidly through the midst of
death, to the salvation laid up for them in heaven. And Christ employs a
strong expression to denote the frailty of the present life, when he
says that souls (<span id="ii.xx-p24.1"></span>Ζωογονοῦνται)*,* — that
is, *are begotten into life* — *when* they are *lost.* His meaning is
the same as if he had declared that inch do not *live* in the world,
because the commencement of that life which is real, and which is worthy
of the name, is, to leave the world. Luke afterwards adds what we find
also in Matthew, that husbands and wives will then be separated, that
the tics by which human beings are bound to each other in the world may
not hinder or retard the godly; for it frequently happens that, while
men are paying attention to each other, not one of them advances a step.
In order, therefor that every man in his own department, freed from
every bond and impediment, may run with cheerfulness, Christ informs us
that, out of a single couple, *one* partner *will be taken,* while *the
other is* *left.* Not that all who are united must of necessity be thus
separated; for the sacred bond of piety will cause a believing wife to
cleave to a believing husband, and will cause children to accompany
their father. But Christ only intended, in order to cut off every
occasion of delay, to enjoin every one to make haste, that those who
already prepared may not waste their time in waiting for their
companions. Immediately afterwards Luke adds, *where the carcass is,
there will the eagles also be gathered together;* which must not,
however, be restricted to the last day, but as the disciples had asked,
*Where, Lord?* that is, “How shall we stand erect amidst so great
shaking? and how shall we remain safe amidst such dangerous storms? and
to what places of concealment shall we resort for protection, when we
are united?” Christ declares, as we find in Matthew—that he is the
banner of solid union, and in which all the children of God must be
gathered.

<span id="ii.xx-p25"></span><span id="ii.xx-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xx-p26"></span>**42.** *Watch therefore.* In Luke the
exhortation is more pointed, or, at least, more special, *Take heed to
yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting,
and drunkenness, and the cares of this life.* And certainly he who, by
living in intemperance, has his senses overloaded with food and wine,
will never elevate his mind to meditation on the heavenly life. But as
there is no desire of the flesh that does not intoxicate a man, they
ought to take care, in all these respects, not to satiate themselves
with the world, if they wish to advance with speed to the kingdom of
Christ. The single word *watch* — which we find in Matthew — denotes
that uninterrupted attention which keeps our minds in full activity, and
makes us pass through the world like pilgrims.

<span id="ii.xx-p27"></span>In the account given by *Mark,* the
disciples are first enjoined to *take heed* lest, through carelessness
or indolence, ruin overtake them; and next are commanded to *watch,*
because various allurements of the flesh are continually creeping upon
us, and lulling our minds to sleep. Next follows an exhortation to
*prayer,* because it is necessary to seek elsewhere the supplies that
are necessary for supporting our weakness. Luke dictates the very form
*of prayer;* first, that God may be pleased to rescue us from so deep
and intricate a labyrinth; and next, that he may present us safe and
sound in presence of his Son; for we shall never be able to reach it but
by miraculously escaping innumerable deaths. And as it was not enough to
pass through the course of the present life by rising superior to all
dangers, Christ places this as the most important, that we may be
permitted to stand before his tribunal.

<span id="ii.xx-p28"></span>*For you know not at what hour your Lord
will come.* It ought to be observed, that the uncertainty as to the time
of Christ’s coming — which almost all treat as an encouragement to sloth
— ought to be felt by us to be an excitement to attention and
watchfulness. God intended that it should be hidden from us, for the
express purpose that we may keep diligent watch without the relaxation
of a single hour. For what would be the trial of faith and patience, if
believers, after spending their whole life in ease, and indolence, and
pleasure, were to prepare themselves within the space of three days for
meeting Christ?
