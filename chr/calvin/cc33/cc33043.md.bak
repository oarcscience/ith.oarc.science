darkness over the whole land  <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md)
till the ninth hour. **46. **And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a
loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me? **47. **And some of those who were standing
by, when they heard it, said, He calleth Elijah. **48. **And immediately
one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and
fastened it to a reed, and gave him to drink. **49. **But others said,
Let him alone, let us see if Elijah will come to save him. **50. **And
Jesus having again cried with a loud voice, gave up his spirit.
**51. **And, lo, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to
the bottom; and the earth trembled, and the rocks were split,
**52. **And graves were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had
slept arose, **53. **And came out of their graves, after his
resurrection, and came into the holy city and appeared to many.
**54. **Now the centurion, and they who were with him guarding Jesus,
when they saw the earthquake, and those things which were done, were
exceedingly terrified, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.
**55. **And there were there many women looking on at a distance, who
had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him: **56. **Among whom
were Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother of James and Joses, and the
mother of Zebedee’s sons.

there was darkness over all the land  <span

ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama

forsaken me? **35. **And some of those who were standing by, when they
heard it, said, Lo, he calleth for Elijah. **36. **And some one ran, and
filled a sponge with vinegar, and fastened it to a reed, and held it out
to him to drink, saying, Let him alone, let us see if Elijah will come
to take him down. **37. **And Jesus, having uttered a loud voice,
expired. **38. **And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top
to the bottom. **39. **And when the centurion, who was standing opposite
to him, saw that he thus expired after crying aloud, he said, Certainly
this man was the Son of God. **40. **And there were also women looking
on from a distance, among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary, the mother
of James the less and of Joses, and of Salome; **41. **(Who also, when
he was in Galilee, had followed him, and ministered to him,) and many
others, who had also gone up with him to Jerusalem.

<span id="ii.xlii-p9"></span>**44. **Now it was about the sixth hour;
and there was darkness over all the land  <span

sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
**46. **And Jesus having cried with a loud voice, said, Father into thy
hands I commit my spirit. And having said this, he expired. **47. **And
when the centurion saw what happened, he glorified God, saying,
Certainly this was a righteous man. **48. **And all the multitudes who
were present at that spectacle, when they saw what was done, returned,
smiting their breasts. **49. **And all his acquaintances, and the women
who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, beholding these
things.

<span id="ii.xlii-p11"></span> 

<span id="ii.xlii-p12"></span><span id="ii.xlii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlii-p13"></span>**<span id="ii.xlii-p13.2"></span>[Matthew
27:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045.md)<span
id="ii.xlii-p13.2"></span>.** *Now from the sixth hour.* Although in the
death of Christ the weakness of the flesh concealed for a short time the
glory of the Godhead, and though the Son of God himself was disfigured
by shame and contempt, and, as Paul says, *was emptied,* (<span
id="ii.xlii-p13.3"></span>[Php
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#007)<span id="ii.xlii-p13.3"></span>.md)
yet the heavenly Father did not cease to distinguish him by some marks,
and during his lowest humiliation prepared some indications of his
future glory, in order to fortify the minds of the godly against the
offense of the cross. Thus the majesty of Christ was attested by the
*obscuration of the sun,* by the *earthquake,* by the *splitting* of the
*rocks,* and the *rending* of *the veil,* as if heaven and earth were
rendering the homage which they owed to their Creator.

<span id="ii.xlii-p14"></span>But we inquire, in the first place, what
was the design of the eclipse of *the sun?* For the fiction of the
ancient poets in their tragedies, that the light of the sun is withdrawn
from the earth whenever any shocking crime is perpetrated, was intended
to express the alarming effects of the anger of God; and this invention
unquestionably had its origin in the ordinary feelings of mankind. In
accordance with this view, some commentators think that, at the death of
Christ, God sent darkness as a Mark of detestation, as if God, by
bringing darkness over the sun, hid his face from beholding the blackest
of all crimes. Others say that, when the visible sun was extinguished,
it pointed out the death of *the Sun of righteousness.* Others choose to
refer it to the blinding of the nation, which followed shortly
afterwards. For the Jews, by rejecting Christ, as soon as he was removed
from among them, were deprived of the light of heavenly doctrine, and
nothing was left to them but the darkness of despair.

<span id="ii.xlii-p15"></span>I rather think that, as stupidity had shut
the eyes of that people against the light, the *darkness* was intended
to arouse them to consider the astonishing design of God in the death of
Christ. For if they were not altogether *hardened,* an unusual change of
the order of nature must have made a deep impression on their senses, so
as to look forward to an approaching renewal of the world. Yet it was a
terrific spectacle which was exhibited to them, that they might tremble
at the judgment of God. And, indeed, it was an astonishing display of
the wrath of God that he did not spare even his only begotten Son, and
was not appeased in any other way than by that price of expiation.

<span id="ii.xlii-p16"></span>As to the scribes and priests, and a great
part of the nation, who paid no attention to the eclipse of the sun, but
passed it by with closed eyes, their amazing madness ought to strike us
with horror;  <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md) for they must have
been more stupid than brute beasts, who when plainly warned of the
severity of the judgment of heaven by such a miracle, did not cease to
indulge in mockery. But this is the spirit of stupidity and of giddiness
with which God intoxicates the reprobate, after having long contended
with their malice. Meanwhile, let us learn that, when they were
bewitched by the enchantments of Satan, the glory of God, however
manifest, was afterwards hidden from them, or, at least, that their
minds were darkened, so that, *seeing they did not see,* (<span
id="ii.xlii-p17.2"></span>[Mt
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.xlii-p17.2"></span>.) But as it was a general admonition, it
ought also to be of advantage to us, by informing us that the sacrifice
by which we are redeemed was of as much importance as if the sun had
fallen from heaven, or if the whole fabric of the world had fallen to
pieces; for this will excite in us deeper horror at our sins.

<span id="ii.xlii-p18"></span>As to the opinion entertained by some who
make this eclipse of the sun extend to every quarter of the world, I do
not consider it to be probable. For though it was related by one or two
authors, still the history of those times attracted so much attention,
that it was impossible for so remarkable a miracle to be passed over in
silence by many other authors, who have described minutely events which
were not so worthy of being recorded. Besides, if the eclipse had been
universal throughout the world, it would have been regarded as natural,
and would more easily have escaped the notice of men.  <span
id="fr_283"></span>[284](#fn_283.md) But when the sun was shining
elsewhere, it was a more striking miracle that Judea was covered with
*darkness.*

<span id="ii.xlii-p20"></span><span id="ii.xlii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlii-p21"></span>**46.** *And about the ninth hour Jesus
cried.* Though in the *cry* which Christ uttered a power more than human
was manifested, yet it was unquestionably drawn from him by intensity of
sorrow. And certainly this was his chief conflict, and harder than all
the other tortures, that in his anguish he was so far from being soothed
by the assistance or favor of his Father, that he felt himself to be in
some measure estranged from him. For not only did he offer his body as
the price of our reconciliation with God, but. in his soul also he
endured the punishments due to us; and thus he became, as Isaiah speaks,
*a man of sorrows,* (<span id="ii.xlii-p21.2"></span>[Isa
53:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#003)<span id="ii.xlii-p21.2"></span>..md)
Those interpreters are widely mistaken who, laying aside this part of
redemption, attended solely to the outward punishment of the flesh; for
in order that Christ might satisfy for us,  <span
id="fr_284"></span>[285](#fn_284.md) it was necessary that he should be
placed as a guilty person at the judgment-seat of God. Now nothing is
more dreadful than to feel that God, whose wrath is worse than all
deaths, is the Judge. When this temptation was presented to Christ, as
if, having God opposed to him, he were already devoted to destruction,
he was seized with horror, which would have been sufficient to swallow
up a hundred times all the men in the world; but by the amazing power of
the Spirit he achieved the victory. Nor is it by hypocrisy, or by
assuming a character, that he complains of having been *forsaken by the
Father.* Some allege that he employed this language in compliance with
the opinion of the people, but this is an absurd mode of evading the
difficulty; for the inward sadness of his soul was so powerful and
violent, that it forced him to break out into a *cry.* Nor did the
redemption which he accomplished consist solely in what was exhibited to
the eye, (as I stated a little ago,) but having undertaken to be our
surety, he resolved actually to undergo in our room the judgment of God.

<span id="ii.xlii-p23"></span>But it appear absurd to say that an
expression of despair escaped Christ. The reply is easy. Though the
perception of the flesh would have led him to dread destruction, still
in his heart faith remained firm, by which he beheld the presence of
God, of whose absence he complains. We have explained elsewhere how the
Divine nature gave way to the weakness of the flesh, so far as was
necessary for our salvation, that Christ might accomplish all that was
required of the Redeemer. We have likewise pointed out the distinction
between the sentiment of nature and the knowledge of faith; and, there
ore, the perception of God’s estrangement from him, which Christ had, as
suggested by natural feeling, did not hinder him from continuing to be
assured by faith that God was reconciled to him. This is sufficiently
evident from the two clauses of the complaint; for, before stating the
temptation, he begins by saying that he betakes himself to God as *his
God,* and thus by the shield of faith he courageously expels that
appearance of *forsaking* which presented itself on the other side. In
short, during this fearful torture his faith remained uninjured, so
that, while he complained of being forsaken, he still relied on the aid
of God as at hand.

<span id="ii.xlii-p24"></span>That this expression eminently deserves
our attention is evident from the circumstance, that the Holy Spirit, in
order to engrave it more deeply on the memory of men, has chosen to
relate it in the Syriac language;  <span
id="fr_285"></span>[286](#fn_285.md) for this has the same effect as if he
made us hear Christ himself repeating the very words which then
proceeded from his mouth. So much the more detestable is the
indifference of those who lightly pass by, as a matter of jesting, the
deep sadness and fearful trembling which Christ endured. No one who
considers that Christ undertook the office of Mediator on the condition
of suffering our condemnation, both in his body and in his soul, will
think it strange that he maintained a struggle with the sorrows of
death, as if an offended God had thrown him into a whirlpool of
afflictions.

<span id="ii.xlii-p26"></span><span id="ii.xlii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlii-p27"></span>**47.** *He calleth Elijah.* Those who
consider this as spoken by the soldiers, ignorant and unskilled in the
Syriac language, and unacquainted with the Jewish religion, and who
imagine that the soldiers blundered through a resemblance of the words,
are, in my opinion, mistaken. I do not think it at all probable that
they erred through ignorance, but rather that they deliberately intended
to mock Christ, and to turn his prayer into an occasion of slander. For
Satan has no method more effectual for ruining the salvation of the
godly, than by dissuading them from calling on God. For this reason, he
employs his agents to drive off from us, as far as he can, the desire to
pray. Thus he impelled the wicked enemies of Christ basely to turn his
prayer into derision, intending by this stratagem to strip him of his
chief armor. And certainly it is a very grievous temptation, when prayer
appears to be so far from yielding any advantage to us, that God exposes
his name to reproaches, instead of lending a gracious car to our
prayers. This ironical language, therefore — or rather this barking of
dogs — amounts to saying that Christ has no access to God, because, by
imploring *Elijah,* he seeks relief in another quarter. Thus we see that
he was tortured on every hand, in order that, overwhelmed with despair,
he might abstain from calling on God, which was, to abandon salvation.
But if the hired brawlers of Antichrist, as well as wicked men existing
in the Church, are now found to pervert basely by their calumnies what
has been properly said by us, let us not wonder that the same thing
should happen to our Head. Yet though they may change *God* into
*Elijah,* when they have ridiculed us to their heart’s content, God will
at length listen to our groanings, and will show that he vindicates his
glory, and punishes base falsehood.

<span id="ii.xlii-p28"></span><span id="ii.xlii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlii-p29"></span>**48.** *And immediately one ran.* As
Christ had once refused to drink, it may be conjectured with
probability, that it was repeatedly offered to him for the sake of
annoyance; though it is also not improbable that *the vinegar* was held
out to him in a cup before he was raised aloft, and that *a sponge* was
afterwards applied to his mouth, while he was hanging on the cross.

<span id="ii.xlii-p30"></span><span id="ii.xlii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlii-p31"></span>**<span id="ii.xlii-p31.2"></span>[Mark
15:36](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#036.md)<span
id="ii.xlii-p31.2"></span>.** *Saying, Let him alone, let us see if
Elijah will come to save him. Mark* relates these words as having been
spoken by the soldier, while holding out the vinegar; but Matthew tells
us that others used the same language. There is no inconsistency here,
however; for it is probable that the jeering was begun by one person,
but was eagerly seized by others, and loudly uttered by the multitude.
The phrase, *let him alone,* appears to have implied not restraint, but
ridicule; accordingly, the person who first mocked Christ, ironically
addressing his companions, says, *Let us see if Elijah will come.*
Others quickly followed, and every one sung the same song to his next
neighbor, as usually happens with men who are agreed about any course.
Nor is it of any importance to inquire if it was in the singular or
plural number; for in either case the meaning is the same, the word
being used in place of an interjection, as if they had said, *Hush!
Hush!*

<span id="ii.xlii-p32"></span><span id="ii.xlii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlii-p33"></span>**<span id="ii.xlii-p33.2"></span>[Matthew
27:50](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#050.md)<span
id="ii.xlii-p33.2"></span>.** *Jesus having again cried with a loud
voice.* Luke, who makes no mention of the former complaint, repeats the
words of this second *cry,* which Matthew and Mark leave out. He says
that Jesus cried, *Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit;* by which
he declared that, though he was fiercely attacked by violent
temptations, still his faith was unshaken, and always kept its ground
unvanquished. For there could not have been a more splendid triumph than
when Christ boldly expresses his assurance that God is the faithful
guardian of his soul, which all imagined to be lost. But instead of
speaking to the deaf, he betook himself directly to God, and committed
to his bosom the assurance of his confidence. He wished, indeed, that
men should hear what he said; but though it might be of no avail to men,
he was satisfied with having God alone as his witness. And certainly
there is not a stronger or more decided testimony of faith than when a
pious man—perceiving himself attacked on every hand:, so that he finds
no consolation on the part of men—despises the madness of the whole
world, discharges his sorrows and cares into the bosom of God, and rests
in the hope of his promises.

<span id="ii.xlii-p34"></span>Though this form of prayer appears to be
borrowed from <span id="ii.xlii-p34.1"></span>[Ps
31:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa031.htm#005.md)<span id="ii.xlii-p34.1"></span>,
yet I have no doubt that he applied it to his immediate object,
according to present circumstances; as if he had said, “I see, indeed, O
Father, that by the universal voice I am destined to destruction, and
that *my soul* is, so to speak, hurried to and fro; but though,
according to the flesh, I perceive no assistance in thee, yet this will
not hinder me from committing my spirit into thy hands, and calmly
relying on the hidden safeguard of thy goodness.” Yet it ought to be
observed, that David, in the passage which I have quoted, not only
prayed that his soul, received by the hand of God, might continue to be
safe and happy after death, but committed his life to the Lord, that,
guarded by his protection, he might prosper both in life and in death.
He saw himself continually besieged by many deaths; nothing, therefore,
remained but to commit himself to the invincible protection of God.
Having made God the guardian of his soul, he rejoices that it is safe
from all danger; and, at the same time, prepares to meet death with
confidence, whenever it shall please God, because the Lord guards the
souls of his people even in death. No as the former was taken away from
Christ, to commit his soul to be protected by the Father during the
frail condition of the earthly life, he hastens cheerfully to death, and
desires to be preserved beyond the world; for the chief reason why God
receives our souls into his keeping is, that our faith may rise beyond
this transitory life.

<span id="ii.xlii-p35"></span>Let us now remember that it was not in
reference to himself alone that Christ committed his soul to the Father,
but that he included, as it were, in one bundle all the souls of those
who believe in him, that they may be preserved along with his own; and
not only so, but by this prayer he obtained authority to save all souls,
so that not only does the heavenly Father, for his sake, deign to take
them into his custody, but, giving up the authority into his hands,
commits them to him to be protected. And therefore Stephen also, when
dying, resigns his soul into his hands, saying, *Lord Jesus, receive my
spirit,* (<span id="ii.xlii-p35.1"></span>[Ac
7:59](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#059)<span id="ii.xlii-p35.1"></span>..md)
Every one who, when he comes to die, following this example, shall
believe in Christ, will not breathe his soul at random into the air, but
will resort to a faithful guardian, who keeps in safety whatever has
been delivered to him by the Father.

<span id="ii.xlii-p36"></span>The *cry* shows also the intensity of the
feeling; for there can be no doubt that Christ, out of the sharpness of
the temptations by which he was beset, not without a painful and
strenuous effort, broke out into this *cry.* And yet he likewise
intended, by this loud and piercing exclamation, to assure us that his
soul would be safe and uninjured by death, in order that we, supported
by the same confidence, may cheerfully depart from the frail hovel of
our flesh.

<span id="ii.xlii-p37"></span><span id="ii.xlii-p37.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlii-p38"></span>**51.** *And, lo, the veil of the temple
was rent.* When Luke blends *the rending of the veil* with the eclipse
of the sun, he inverts the order; for the Evangelists, as we have
frequently seen, are not careful to mark every hour with exactness. Nor
was it proper that the *veil* should be *rent,* until the sacrifice of
expiation had been completed; for then Christ, the true and everlasting
Priest, having abolished the figures of the law, opened up for us by his
blood the way to the heavenly sanctuary, that we may no longer stand at
a distance within the porch, but may freely advance into the presence of
God. For so long as the shadowy worship lasted,  <span
id="fr_286"></span>[287](#fn_286.md) a *veil* was hung up before the
earthly sanctuary, in order to keep the people not only from entering
but from seeing it, (<span id="ii.xlii-p39.2"></span>[Ex
26:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo026.htm#033.md)<span id="ii.xlii-p39.2"></span>;
<span id="ii.xlii-p39.3"></span>[2Ch
3:14](../../../bib/kjv/ch2003.htm#014)<span id="ii.xlii-p39.3"></span>..md)
Now Christ, by

<span id="ii.xlii-p40"></span>blotting out the handwriting which was
opposed to us,  
(<span id="ii.xlii-p40.2"></span>[Col
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014)<span id="ii.xlii-p40.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="ii.xlii-p41"></span>removed every obstruction, that, relying
on him as Mediator, we may all be *a royal priesthood,* (<span
id="ii.xlii-p41.1"></span>[1Pe
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009)<span id="ii.xlii-p41.1"></span>..md)
Thus the *rending* of the *veil* was not only an abrogation of the
ceremonies which existed under the law, but *was,* in some respects, an
opening of heaven, that God may now invite the members of his Son to
approach him with familiarity.

<span id="ii.xlii-p42"></span>Meanwhile, the *Jews* were informed that
the period of abolishing outward sacrifices had arrived, and that the
ancient priesthood would be of no farther use; that though the building
of the temple was left standing, it would not be necessary to worship
God there after the ancient custom; but that since the substance and
truth of the shadows had been fulfilled, the figures of the law were
changed into spirit. For though Christ offered a visible sacrifice, yet,
as the Apostle tells us (<span id="ii.xlii-p42.1"></span>[Heb
9:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#014)<span id="ii.xlii-p42.1"></span>.md)
it must be viewed spiritually, that we may enjoy its value and its
fruit. But it was of no advantage to those wretched men that the outward
sanctuary was laid bare by *the rending of the veil,* because the inward
*veil* of unbelief, which was in their hearts,  <span
id="fr_287"></span>[288](#fn_287.md) hindered them from beholding the
saving light.

<span id="ii.xlii-p44"></span>*And the earth trembled, and the rocks
were split.* What Matthew adds about the earthquake and the *splitting
oft he rocks,* I think it probable, took place at the same time. In this
way not only did the earth bear the testimony to its Creator, but it was
even called as a witness against the hard-heartedness of a perverse
nation; for it showed how monstrous that obstinacy must have been on
which neither the *earthquake* nor *the splitting of the rocks* made any
impression.

<span id="ii.xlii-p45"></span><span id="ii.xlii-p45.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlii-p46"></span>**52** *And graves were opened.* This was
also a striking miracle, by which God declared that his Son entered into
the prison of death, not to continue to be shut up there, but to bring
out all who were held captive. For at the very time when the despicable
weakness of the flesh was beheld in the person of Christ, the
magnificent and divine energy of his death penetrated even to hell. This
is the reason why, when he was about to be shut up in a sepulcher, other
sepulchers *were opened* by him. Yet it is doubtful if this *opening of
the graves* took place before his resurrection; for, in my opinion, *the
resurrection of the saints,* which is mentioned immediately afterwards,
was subsequent to the resurrection of Christ. There is no probability in
the conjecture of some commentators that, after having received life and
breath, they remained three days concealed in their graves. I think it
more probable that, when Christ died, the *graves* were immediately
*opened:* and that, when he rose, some of the godly, having received
life, *went out of their graves, and were seen* in the city. For Christ
is called *the first-born from the dead,* (<span
id="ii.xlii-p46.1"></span>[Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018)<span id="ii.xlii-p46.1"></span>,.md)
and *the first-fruits of those who rise,* (<span
id="ii.xlii-p46.2"></span>[1Co
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.xlii-p46.2"></span>,) because by his death he commenced, and by
his resurrection he completed, a new life; not that, when he died, the
dead were immediately raised, but because his death was the source and
commencement of life. This reason, therefore, is fully applicable, since
the opening of the graves was the presage of a new life, that the fruit
or result appeared three days afterwards, because Christ, in rising from
the dead, brought others along with him out of their graves as his
companions. Now by this sign it was made evident, that he neither died
nor rose again in a private capacity, but in order to shed the odor of
life on all believers.

<span id="ii.xlii-p47"></span>But here a question arises. Why did God
determine that only some should arise, since a participation in the
resurrection of Christ belongs equally to all believers? I reply: As the
time was not fully come when the whole body of the Church should be
gathered to its Head, he exhibited in a few persons an instance of the
new life which all ought to expect. For we know that Christ was received
into heaven on the condition that the *life* of his members should still
*be hid,* (<span id="ii.xlii-p47.1"></span>[Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003)<span id="ii.xlii-p47.1"></span>,.md)
until it should be manifested by his coming. But in order that the minds
of believers might be more quickly raised to hope, it was advantageous
that the resurrection, which was to be common to all of them, should be
tasted by a few.

<span id="ii.xlii-p48"></span>Another and more difficult question is,
What became of those saints afterwards? For it would appear to be absurd
to suppose that, after having been once admitted by Christ to the
participation of a new life, they again returned to dust. But as this
question cannot be easily or quickly answered, so it is not necessary to
give ourselves much uneasiness about a matter which is not necessary to
be known. That they continued long to converse with men is not probable;
for it was only necessary that they should be *seen* for a short time,
that in them, as in a mirror or resemblance, the power of Christ might
plainly appear. As God intended, by their persons, to confirm the hope
of the heavenly life among those who were then alive, there would be no
absurdity in saying that, after having performed this office, they again
rested in their graves. But it is more probable that the life which they
received was not afterwards taken from them; for if it had been a mortal
life, it would not have been a proof of a perfect resurrection. Now,
though the whole world will rise again, and though Christ will raise up
the wicked to judgment, as well as believers to salvation, yet as it was
especially for the benefit of his Church that he rose again, so it was
proper that he should bestow on none but *saints* the distinguished
honor of rising along with him.

<span id="ii.xlii-p49"></span><span id="ii.xlii-p49.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlii-p50"></span>**53.** *And* *went into the holy city.*
When Matthew bestows on Jerusalem the honorable designation of *the holy
city,* he does not intend to applaud the character of its inhabitants,
for we know that it was at that time full of all pollution and
wickedness, so that it was rather *a den of robbers,* (<span
id="ii.xlii-p50.1"></span>[Jer
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#011)<span id="ii.xlii-p50.1"></span>..md)
But as it had been chosen by God, its *holiness,* which was founded on
God’s adoption, could not be effaced by any corruptions of men, till its
rejection was openly declared. Or, to express it more briefly, on the
part of man it was profane, and on the part of God it was *holy,* till
the destruction or pollution of the temple, which happened not long
after the crucifixion of Christ.

<span id="ii.xlii-p51"></span><span id="ii.xlii-p51.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlii-p52"></span>**54.** *Now the centurion.* As Luke
mentions the *lamentation* of the people, *the centurion* and his
soldiers were not the only persons who acknowledged Christ to be *the
Son of God;* but the Evangelists mention this circumstance respecting
him for the purpose of heightening their description: for it is
wonderful that an irreligious man, who had not been instructed in the
Law, and was ignorant of true religion, should form so correct a
judgment from the signs which he beheld. This comparison tends
powerfully to condemn the stupidity of the city; for it was an evidence
of shocking madness, that when the fabric of the world *shook and
trembled,* none of the Jews were affected by it except the despised
rabble. And yet, amidst such gross blindness, God did not permit the
testimonies which he gave respecting his Son to be buried in silence.
Not only, therefore, did true religion open the eyes of devout
worshippers of God to perceive that from heaven God was magnifying the
glory of Christ, but natural understanding compelled foreigners, and
even soldiers, to confess what they had not learned either from the law
or from any instructor.

<span id="ii.xlii-p53"></span>When Mark says that *the centurion* spoke
thus, because Christ, *when he had uttered a loud voice, expired,* some
commentators think that he intends to point out the unwonted strength
which remained unimpaired till death; and certainly, as the body of
Christ was almost exhausted of blood, it could not happen, in the
ordinary course of things, that the sides and the lungs should retain
sufficient rigor for uttering so loud a cry. Yet I rather think that
*the centurion* intended to applaud the unshaken perseverance of Christ
in calling on the name of God. Nor was it merely the *cry of* Christ
that led *the centurion* to think so highly of him, but this confession
was extorted from him by perceiving that his extraordinary strength
harmonized with heavenly miracles.

<span id="ii.xlii-p54"></span>The words, *he feared God,*  <span
id="fr_288"></span>[289](#fn_288.md) must not be so explained as if he had
fully repented.  <span id="fr_289"></span>[290](#fn_289.md) It was only a
sudden and transitory impulse, as it frequently happens, that men who
are thoughtless and devoted to the world are struck with the fear of
God, when he makes an alarming display of his power; but as they have no
living root, indifference quickly follows, and puts an end to that
feeling. *The centurion* had not undergone such a change as to dedicate
himself to God for the remainder of his life, but was only for a moment
the herald of the divinity of Christ.

<span id="ii.xlii-p57"></span>When Luke represents him as saying no more
than *certainly this was a righteous man,* the meaning is the same as if
he had plainly said that he was *the Son of God,* as it is expressed by
the other two Evangelists. For it had been universally reported that
Christ was put to death, because he declared himself to be the Son of
God. Now when *the centurion* bestows on him the praise of
*righteousness,* and pronounces him to be innocent, he likewise
acknowledges him to be *the Son of God;* not that he understood
distinctly how Christ was begotten by God the Father, but because he
entertains no doubt that there is some divinity in him, and, convinced
by proofs, holds it to be certain that Christ was not an ordinary man,
but had been raised up by God.

<span id="ii.xlii-p58"></span>As to *the multitudes,* by *striving their
breasts,* they expressed the dread of punishment for a public crime,
because they felt that public guilt had been contracted by an unjust and
shocking murder.  <span id="fr_290"></span>[291](#fn_290.md) But as they
went no farther, their lamentation was of no avail, unless, perhaps, in
some persons it was the commencement or preparation of true repentance.
And since nothing more is described to us than the lamentation which God
drew from them to the glory of his Son, let us learn by this example,
that it is of little importance, or of no importance at all, if a man is
struck with terror, when he sees before his eyes the power of God,
until, after the astonishment has been abated, the fear of God remains
calmly in his heart.

<span id="ii.xlii-p60"></span><span id="ii.xlii-p60.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlii-p61"></span>**55.** *And there were also many women
there.* I consider this to have been added in order to inform us that,
while the disciples had fled and were scattered in every direction,
still some of their company were retained by the Lord as witnesses. Now
though the Apostle John did not depart from the cross, yet no mention is
made of him; but praise is bestowed on *the women* alone, who
accompanied Christ till death, because their extraordinary attachment to
their Master was the more strikingly displayed, when the men fled
trembling. For they must have been endued with extraordinary strength of
attachment, since, though they could render him no service, they did not
cease to treat him with reverence, even when exposed to the lowest
disgrace. And yet we learn fromLuke that all the men had not fled; for
he says that *all his acquaintances stood at a distance.* But not
without reason do the Evangelists bestow the chief praise on *the
women,* for they deserved the preference above the men. In my opinion,
the implied contrast suggests a severe reproof of the apostles. I speak
of the great body of them; for since only one remained, the three
Evangelists, as I mentioned a little ago, take no notice of him. It was
in the highest degree disgraceful to chosen witnesses to withdraw from
that spectacle on which depended the salvation of the world.
Accordingly, when they afterwards proclaimed the gospel, they must have
borrowed from *women* the chief portion of the history. But if a remedy
had not been miraculously prepared by Providence against a great evil,
they would have deprived themselves, and us along with them, of the
knowledge of redemption.

<span id="ii.xlii-p62"></span>At first sight, we might think that the
testimony of *the women* does not possess equal authority; but if we
duly consider by what power of the Spirit they were supported against
that temptation, we shall find that there is no reason why our faith
should waver, since it rests on God, who is the real Author of their
testimony.  <span id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291.md) Yet let us observe,
that it proceeded from the inconceivable goodness of God, that even to
us should come that gospel which speaks of the expiation by which God
has been reconciled to us. For during the general desertion of those who
ought to have run before others, God encouraged some, out of the midst
of the flock, who, recovering from the alarm, should be witnesses to us
of that history, without the belief of which we cannot be saved. Of *the
women* themselves, we shall presently have another opportunity of saying
something. At present, it may be sufficient to take a passing notice of
one point, that their eagerness for instruction led them to withdraw
from their country, and constantly to learn from the lips of Christ, and
that they spared neither toil nor money, provided that they might enjoy
his saving doctrine.
