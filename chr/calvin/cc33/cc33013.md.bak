may be made clean. **27. **Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! for you are like whitened sepulchers, which outwardly indeed
appear beautiful, but within are full of dead men’s bones, and of all
filthiness. **28. **So you also outwardly indeed appear righteous to
men; but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

<span id="ii.xii-p5"></span>**42. **But woe to you, Pharisees! for you
pay tithe of mint, and rue, and every kind of herb, and pass by judgment
and the love of God. The latter you ought to have done, and not to have
omitted the former. (A little after.) **44. **Woe to you, scribes and
Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are as tombs which do not appear, and the
men who walk over them are not aware of them.

<span id="ii.xii-p6"></span> 

<span id="ii.xii-p7"></span>Christ charges the scribes with a fault
which is found in all hypocrites, that they are exceedingly diligent and
careful in small matters, but disregard *the principal points of the
Law.* This disease has prevailed in almost all ages, and among all
nations; so that men have, in most cases, endeavored to please God by
observing with exactness some trivial matters. Finding that they cannot
entirely release themselves from all obedience to God, they have
recourse to this second remedy of expiating any heinous offenses by
satisfactions which are of no value. Thus we see that the Papists, while
they transgress the chief commandments of God, are extremely zealous in
the performance of trifling ceremonies. Hypocrisy of the same kind is
now reproved by God in the scribes, who, while they were very diligent
and careful in *paying tithes,* cared little about *the principal points
of the Law.* To expose more fully to ridicule their offensive
ostentation, he does not say generally that they *paid tithes,* but
*tithes of mint, and anise, and* (as Luke has it) of *every kind of
herb,* so as to make a display of extraordinary zeal for piety at the
least possible expense.

<span id="ii.xii-p8"></span>But as Christ makes the chief righteousness
of the Law to consist in *mercy, judgment, and faith,* we *must first,*
see what he means by these words; and, *secondly,* why he left out the
commandments of the first table, which strictly relate to the worship of
God, as if godliness were of less value than the duties of charity.
*Judgment* is taken for *equity,* or *uprightness,* the effect of which
is, that we render to every man what belongs to him, and that no man
deceives or injures others. *Mercy* proceeds farther, and leads a man to
endeavor to assist his brethren with his property, to relieve the
wretched by advice or by money, to protect those who are unjustly
oppressed, and to employ liberally for the common good the means which
God has put into his hands. *Faith* is nothing else than strict
integrity; not to attempt any thing by cunning, or malice, or deceit,
but to cultivate towards all that mutual sincerity which every man
wishes to be pursued towards himself. The sum of the Law, therefore,
relates to charity.

<span id="ii.xii-p9"></span>The word *faith,* I am aware, is interpreted
by some persons differently, as including, by synecdoche, the whole
worship of God; but Christ, according to his custom, here brings the
true test of holiness to brotherly love, and therefore does not refer to
the first table. Nor is it inconsistent with this view that, instead of
*faith,* Luke uses the expression, *the love of God;* for the design of
Christ was, to show what it is that the Lord chiefly requires of us in
his Law. It is well known that the Law was divided into two tables, so
as to point out, first, what we owe to God, and next, what we owe to
men. Luke expresses both parts as if Christ had said, that the chief
design of the Law is, that we should love God, and that we should be
just and merciful towards our neighbors. Matthew satisfies himself with
one part; and there is no absurdity in calling the duties of charity
*the principal points of the Law,* since charity itself is pronounced by
Paul to be *the perfection of the Law;* as he also says, that

<span id="ii.xii-p10"></span>the Law is fulfilled if toe love our
neighbors,  
(<span id="ii.xii-p10.2"></span>[Ro
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#010)<span id="ii.xii-p10.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xii-p11"></span>And Christ, when formerly interrogated as
to the commandments of the Law quoted none but those which belonged to
the second table.

<span id="ii.xii-p12"></span>If it be objected, that in this way men are
preferred to God, because charity, which is performed towards them, is
reckoned more valuable than religion, the answer is easy. Christ does
not here contrast the second table of the Law with the first, but, on
the contrary, draws from the manner in which the second table is kept
the proof whether or not God is truly and sincerely worshipped. As piety
lies within the heart, and as God does not dwell amongst us in order to
make trial of our *love* towards Him, and does not even need our
services, it is easy for hypocrites to lie, and falsely to pretend to
*love God.* But the duties of brotherly love fall under the senses, and
are placed before the eyes of all, and therefore in them the impudence
of hypocrites is better ascertained. Christ, therefore, did not intend
to enter into subtle inquiries about the particular parts of
righteousness, or their order, but, so far as the ordinary capacity of
men allowed, intended simply to show that the Law is kept only when men
are just, and kind, and true, towards each other; for thus they testify
that they *love* and fear *God,* and give proper and sufficient evidence
of sincere piety. Not that it is enough to discharge our duties towards
men, if we do not first render to God what we owe to him, but because he
who regulates his life according to God’s commandment must be a sincere
worshipper of God.

<span id="ii.xii-p13"></span>And yet the question is not fully answered;
for *tithes,* which Christ places inferior to *judgment and mercy,* were
a part of divine worship, and some part of them was usually bestowed on
the poor, so that *tithes* contained a double sacrifice. I reply:
*Tithes* are not simply compared to *alms,* and *faith, and judgment,*
but the pretended holiness of the scribes is compared with the sincere
and pure feeling of charity. Why were they so ready and willing to *pay
tithes,* but in order to pacify God a, the least expense and trouble?
For they did not regard the principal point; and therefore those light
matters, by which they attempted to deceive God and men, ought not to be
reckoned along the duties of charity.

<span id="ii.xii-p14"></span><span id="ii.xii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p15"></span>**<span id="ii.xii-p15.2"></span>[Matthew
23:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023.md)<span
id="ii.xii-p15.2"></span>.** *The former you ought to have done.* This
is intended to anticipate their calumny; for they might have put an
unfavorable interpretation on his discourse, and charged him with
setting no value on what the Law of God had enjoined. He therefore
acknowledges that whatever God has enjoined ought to be performed, and
that no part of it ought to be omitted, but maintains that zeal for the
whole Law is no reason why we ought not to insist chiefly on *the
principal points.* Hence he infers that they overturn the natural order
who employ themselves in the smallest matters, when they ought rather to
have begun with *the principal points;* for *tithes* were only a kind of
appendage. Christ therefore affirms that he has no intention to lessen
the authority even of the smallest commandments, though he recommends
and demands due order in keeping the Law. It is therefore our duty to
preserve entire the whole Law, which cannot be violated in any part
without contempt for its Author; for He who has forbidden us to commit
adultery, and to kill, and to steal, has likewise condemned all impure
desire. Hence we conclude that all the commandments are so interwoven
with each other, that we have no right to detach one of them from the
rest. Wherefore it is also written,

<span id="ii.xii-p16"></span>Cursed is every one that performeth not all
things that are written, (<span id="ii.xii-p16.1"></span>[De
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026.md)<span id="ii.xii-p16.1"></span>;
<span id="ii.xii-p16.2"></span>[Ga
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010)<span id="ii.xii-p16.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="ii.xii-p17"></span>by which words the righteousness of the
whole Law, without exception, is enforced. But this reverence, as we
have said, does not take away the distinction between the commandments,
or the true design of the Law, to which those who truly observe it
direct their mind, that they may not merely amuse themselves on the
surface.

<span id="ii.xii-p18"></span><span id="ii.xii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p19"></span>**24.** *Blind guides.* This is s
proverbial saying, by which he beautifully describes the affected
scrupulousness of hypocrites about trifling matters; for they utterly
shrink from very small faults, as if a single transgression appeared to
them more revolting than a hundred deaths, and yet they freely permit
themselves and others to commit the most heinous crimes. They act as
absurdly as if a man were to *strain out* a small crumb of bread, and to
swallow a whole loaf.

<span id="ii.xii-p20"></span>*Straining out*  <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) *a gnat, and swallowing a camel.* We
know that *a gnat* is a very small animal, and that *a camel* is a huge
beast. Nothing therefore could be more ridiculous than to *strain out*
the wine or the water, so as not to hurt the jaws by swallowing *a
gnat,* and yet carelessly to gulp down a *camel.*  <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) But it is evident that hypocrites
amuse themselves with such distinctions; for while they pass by
*judgment, mercy, and faith,* and even tear in pieces the whole Law,
they are excessively rigid and severe in matters that are of no great
importance; and while in this way they pretend to kiss the feet of God,
they proudly spit in his face.

<span id="ii.xii-p23"></span><span id="ii.xii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p24"></span>**25.** *For you cleanse the outer part.*
Our Lord follows out the same statement, and employs a figure for
reproaching the *scribes* with being eagerly bent on this single object
of making a brilliant appearance before men. For by *the outer part of
the dish* he metaphorically expresses the outward appearance; as if he
had said, “You give yourselves no concern about any *cleanness* but what
appears outwardly, which is quite as if one were carefully to wash off
the filth of the dish without, but to leave it filthy within.” That the
expression is metaphorical is evident from the second clause, in which
the uncleanness *within* is condemned, because *within they are full of
intemperance and extortion.* He therefore reproves their hypocrisy, in
not endeavoring to regulate their life, except before the eyes of men,
in order to procure for themselves an empty reputation for holiness.
Thus he recalls them to the pure and sincere desire of a holy life.
*Cleanse first,* he says, *that which is within;* for it would be
ridiculous to feast your eyes with outward splendor, and yet to drink
out of a cup full of dregs, or in other respects filthy.  <span
id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md)

<span id="ii.xii-p26"></span><span id="ii.xii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xii-p27"></span>**27** *You are like whitened sepulchers.*
This is a different metaphor, but the meaning is the same; for he
compares them to *sepulchers,* which the men of the world ambitiously
construct with great beauty and splendor. As a painting or engraving on
*sepulchers* draws the eyes of men upon them, while inwardly they
contain stinking carcasses; so Christ says that hypocrites deceive by
their outward appearance, because they are full of deceit and iniquity.
The words of Luke are somewhat different, that they deceive the eyes of
men, *like sepulchers, which frequently are not perceived by those who
walk over them;* but it amounts to the same meaning, that, under the
garb of pretended holiness, there lurks hidden filth which they cherish
in their hearts, like a marble *sepulcher;* for it wears the aspect of
what is beautiful and lovely, but covers a stinking carcass, so as not
to be offensive to those who pass by. Hence we infer what I have
formerly said, that Christ, with a view to the advantage of the simple
and ignorant, tore off the deceitful mask which the scribes held wrapped
around them in empty hypocrisy; for this warning was advantageous to
simple persons, that they might quickly withdraw from the jaws of
wolves. Yet this passage contains a general doctrine, that the children
of God ought to desire to be pure rather than to appear so.

<span id="ii.xii-p21"></span> In rendering the words, <span
id="ii.xii-p21.1"></span>οἱ διυλιζοντες τὸυ κύνωπα, *Campbell* resorts
to a circumlocution, who strain your liquor, to avoid swallowing a gnat;
and he adds the following note:— E.T. Who strain at a gnat. I do not
understand the import of this expression. Some have thought that it has
sprung originally from a mere typographical error of some printer, who
has made it strain at, instead of strain out.” — The conjecture
mentioned by *Campbell* is strongly confirmed by the earlier English
versions. “Blinde leders; clensenge a gnat, but swolowynge a camel.” —
(Wyclif, 1380.) “Ye blinde gydes, which strayne out a gnat, and swalowe
a cammyll.” — (Tyndale, 1534.) “Ye blynde gydes, which strayne out a
gnat, and swalowe a camell.” — (Cranmer, 1539.) “Ye blynde gydes, which
strayne out a gnate, and swalow a cammel.” — (Geneva, 1557.) “Blinde
guides, that strain a gnat, and swallow a camel.” — (Rheims, 1582.) The
coincidence of those versions in supporting the true reading is very
remarkable, and the substitution of at for out is more likely to have
been the effect of accident than of design. — *Ed.*
