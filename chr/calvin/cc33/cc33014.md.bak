hypocrites! for you build the sepulchers of the prophets and embellish
the monuments of the righteous, **30. **And say, If we had been in the
days of our fathers, we would not have been their associates in the
blood of the prophets. **31. **Thus you testify against yourselves, that
you are the children of those who killed the prophets. **32. **Do you
also fill up the measure of your fathers. **33. **Serpents, offspring of
vipers, how shall you escape the judgment of hell? **34. **Therefore,
lo, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes, and some of them
you will slay and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your
synagogues, and persecute from city to city: **35. **That upon you may
come all the righteous blood which hath been shed on the earth, from the
blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Barachiah,
whom you slew between the temple and the altar. **36. **Verily I say to
you, All these things shall come on this generation. **37. **Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, who slayest the prophets, and stonest those who were sent to
thee, how often would I have gathered together thy children, as a hen
gathereth her chickens under her wings, and you would not! **38. **Lo,
your house is left to you desolate. **39. **For I tell you, that you
shall never see me henceforth, till you say, Blessed be he that cometh
in the name of the Lord.

<span id="ii.xiii-p5"></span>**47. **Woe to you, for you build the

them, and you build their sepulchers. **49. **Therefore also the Wisdom
of God hath said, I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of
them they will slay and persecute: **50. **That the blood of all the
prophets, which hath been shed since the creation of the world, may be
demanded from this generation; **51. **From the blood of Abel to the

<span id="ii.xiii-p17"></span>**<span id="ii.xiii-p17.2"></span>[Matthew
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#029.md)<span
id="ii.xiii-p17.2"></span>.** *For you build the sepulchers of the
prophets.* An unfounded opinion is entertained by some, that the
*scribes* are here reproved for superstition, in foolishly honoring the
deceased *prophets* by splendid *sepulchers,* as the Papists now
transfer the honor of God to departed saints, and even are so perverse
as to adore their images. They had not yet arrived at such a pitch of
blindness and madness, and therefore the design of Christ was different.
The scribes endeavored to gain the favor of the ignorant multitude, and
indeed of all the Jews, by this additional hypocrisy, that they
cherished with reverence the memory of the *prophets;* for while in this
manner they pretended to maintain their doctrine, any one would have
supposed that they were faithful imitators of them, and very keen
zealots for the worship of God. It was a proposal, therefore, which was
likely to prove highly acceptable, to erect monuments for the prophets,
because in this way religion might be said to be drawn out of darkness,
that it might receive the honor which it deserved. And yet nothing was
farther from their design than to restore doctrine, which might appear
to have been extinguished by the death of the prophets. But though they
were not only averse to the doctrine of the prophets, but most
inveterate enemies to it, yet they honored them—when dead—with
sepulchers, as if they had made common cause with them.

<span id="ii.xiii-p18"></span>It is customary, indeed, with hypocrites
thus to honor, after their death, good teachers and holy ministers of
God, whom they cannot endure while they are alive. Nor does this arise
merely from the common fault, which Horace thus describes: “We hate
virtue while it is in safety, but when it has been removed from our
eyes, we seek it with envy;”  <span id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md)
but as the ashes of the dead no longer give annoyance by harsh and
severe reproofs, they who are driven to madness by the living voices of
those men are not unwilling, by adoring them, to make an empty display
of religion. It is a hypocrisy which costs little to profess warm regard
for those who are now silent.  <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md)
Thus each of the *prophets,* in his own age, was contemptuously
rejected, and wickedly tormented, by the Jews, and, in many instances,
cruelly put to death; while posterity, though not a whit better than
their fathers, pretended to venerate their memory, instead of embracing
their doctrine; for they too were actuated by equal hostility towards
their own teachers.  <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) As the
world—not venturing altogether to despise God, or at least to rise
openly against him—contrives this stratagem of adoring the shadow of God
instead of God, so a similar game is played in reference to the
prophets.

<span id="ii.xiii-p23"></span>A proof of this—far too striking—may be
seen in Popery. Not satisfied with paying just veneration to Apostles
and Martyrs, they render to them divine worship, and think that they
cannot go too far in the honors which they heap upon them; and yet, by
their rage against believers, they show what sort of respect they would
have manifested towards Apostles and Martyrs, if they had been still
alive to discharge the same office which they anciently held. For why
are they inflamed with such rage against us, but because we desire that
doctrine to be received, and to be successful, which the Apostles and
Martyrs sealed with their blood? While the holy servants of God valued
that doctrine more highly than their own life, would their life have
been spared by those who so outrageously persecute the doctrine? Let
them adorn the images of the saints as they may think fit, by perfumes,
candles, flowers, and every sort of gaudy ornament. If Peter were now
alive, they would tear him in pieces; they would stone Paul; and if
Christ himself were still in the world, they would burn him with a slow
fire.

<span id="ii.xiii-p24"></span>Our Lord, perceiving that the *scribes*
and priests of his age were eager to obtain the applause of the people,
on the ground of their being devout worshippers of the *prophets,*
reproves them for deceit and mockery, because they not only reject, but
even cruelly persecute, the prophets that are now present,  <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) and whom God has sent to them. But it
is a display of base hypocrisy, and shameful impudence, to desire to be
thought religious on account of worshipping the dead, while they
endeavor to murder the living.

<span id="ii.xiii-p26"></span><span id="ii.xiii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p27"></span>**30.** *If we had been in the days of our
fathers.* Not without good reason did Christ introduce this sentiment;
for though he does not blame them for the conduct of their fathers, and
does not make it the chief ground of accusation that they are the
children of murderers: yet he takes a passing glance of their foolish
boasting, in being accustomed to glory in their ancestors, while they
were descended from the bloody enemies of God. The appeal may be thus
stated: “You look upon the veneration which you pay to the deceased
*prophets* as some sort of expiation for the wickedness of your
*fathers.* Now then I have this to urge, that it is in vain for you to
boast of a sacred ancestry, since you are descended from wicked and
ungodly parents. Go now, and screen your crimes by the piety of those
whose hands, you acknowledge, were stained with innocent blood. But it
is an additional and far more heinous crime, that the sacrilegious fury
of the *fathers,* which you condemn by raising sepulchers for the dead,
is imitated by you in the murder of the living.”

<span id="ii.xiii-p28"></span><span id="ii.xiii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p29"></span>**32.** *Do you then fill up the measure
of your fathers.* He at length concludes that they are not, in this
respect, degenerate from their fathers; as if he had said, “It is not
now that your nation begins to treat with cruelty the prophets of God;
for this is the ancient discipline, this is the custom handed down from
the fathers, and, in short, this way of acting is almost natural to
you.” And yet he does not bid them do what they are doing, to put to
death holy teachers, but states figuratively that they have a hereditary
right to rise against the servants of God, and that they must be
permitted to oppose religion, because in this way they *fill up* what is
wanting in the crimes of *their fathers,* and finish the web which they
had begun. By these words he not only pronounces themselves to be
desperate, and incapable of being brought to a sound mind, but warns
simple people that there is no reason to wonder, if the *prophets* of
God are ill-treated by the children of murderers.

<span id="ii.xiii-p30"></span><span id="ii.xiii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p31"></span>**33.** *Offspring of vipers.* After
having demonstrated that the *scribes* are not only base enemies of
sound doctrine, and wicked corrupters of the worship of God, but
likewise deadly plagues of the Church, Christ, being about to close his
discourse, kindles into more vehement indignation against them; as it is
necessary to shake off by violence the flatteries in which hypocrites
indulge, and to drag them, as it were, to the judgment seat of God, that
they may be filled with alarm. And yet Christ did not keep them alone in
his eye, but intended to strike terror into the whole people, that all
might guard against a similar destruction. How harsh and intolerable
this roughness of language must have been to these reverend instructors
may easily be inferred from the long period during which they had held a
peaceful dominion, so that no one dared to mutter against them. And
there can be no doubt that many were displeased with the great freedom
and sharpness which Christ used, and, above all, that he was looked upon
as immoderate and outrageous in venturing to apply such reproachful
epithets to the order of the *scribes;* as many fastidious persons of
the present day cannot endure any harsh word to be spoken against the
Popish clergy. But as Christ had to deal with the worst of hypocrites,
who not only were swelled with proud contempt of *God,* and intoxicated
with careless security, but had captivated the multitude by their
enchantments, he found it necessary to exclaim against them with
vehemence. He calls them *serpents* both in nature and in habits, and
then threatens them with a punishment, which it will be in vain for them
to attempt to escape, if they do not speedily repent.

<span id="ii.xiii-p32"></span><span id="ii.xiii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p33"></span>**34.** *Therefore, lo, I send to you.
Luke* introduces it in a still more emphatic manner, *Wherefore also the
Wisdom of God hath said;* which some commentators explain thus: “I, who
am the eternal *Wisdom of God,* declare this concerning you.” But I am
more inclined to believe that, according to the ordinary custom of
Scripture, God is here represented as speaking in the person of his
*Wisdom;* so that the meaning is, *“God* foretold long ago, by the
prophetic Spirit, what would happen with regard to you.” This sentence,
I acknowledge, is nowhere to be found literally: but as God denounces
the incorrigible obstinacy of that people in many places of Scripture,
Christ draws up a kind of summary of them, and by this personification
 <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) expresses more clearly what was
the judgment of God as to the incurable wickedness of that nation. For
if those teachers would have no success, it might have appeared strange
that Christ should have desired them to weary themselves to no purpose.
Men argue thus: “God labors in vain, when he sends his word to the
reprobate, who, he knows, will continue obstinate.” And hypocrites, as
if it were sufficient of itself to have preachers of the heavenly
doctrine continually with them, though they show themselves to be
disobedient, entertain the conviction that God is reconciled and
favorable to them, provided that the outward word be heard amongst them.

<span id="ii.xiii-p35"></span>Thus the Jews fiercely boasted that, in
comparison of other nations, they had always enjoyed the best *prophets*
and teachers, and, as if they had deserved so great an honor, they
considered this to be an undoubted proof of their own excellence.  <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) To put down this foolish boasting,
Christ not only affirms that they do not excel other nations on the
ground of having received from God distinguished prophets and expounders
of *his Wisdom,* but maintains that this ilk requited favor is a greater
reproach, and will bring upon them a heavier condemnation, because the
purpose of God was different from what they supposed, namely, to render
them more inexcusable, and to bring their wicked malice to the highest
pitch; as if he had said, “Though prophets have been appointed to you by
heaven in close succession, it is idly and foolishly that you claim this
as an honor; for God had quite a different object in his secret
judgment, which was, to lay open, by an uninterrupted succession of
gracious invitations, your wicked obstinacy, and, on your being
convicted of it, to involve the children in the same condemnation with
the fathers.”

<span id="ii.xiii-p37"></span>With regard to the words, the discourse as
related by Matthew is defective, but its meaning must be supplied from
the words of Luke. The mention of *scribes and wise men* along with
*prophets* tends to magnify the grace of God; by which their ingratitude
becomes more apparent, since, though God left nothing undone for their
instruction, they made no proficiency. Instead of *wise men* and
*scribes, Luke* mentions *apostles,* but the meaning is the same. This
passage shows that God does not always bestow salvation on men when he
sends his word to them, but that he sometimes intends to have it
proclaimed to the reprobate, who, he knows, will continue obstinate,
that it may be to them

<span id="ii.xiii-p38"></span>the savior of death unto death, (<span
id="ii.xiii-p38.1"></span>[2Co
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016)<span id="ii.xiii-p38.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xiii-p39"></span>The word of God, indeed, in itself and by
its own nature, brings salvation, and invites all men indiscriminately
to the hope of eternal life; but as all are not inwardly drawn, and as
God does not pierce the ears of ally—in short, as they are not renewed
to repentance or bent to obedience, those who reject the word of God
render it, by their unbelief, deadly and destructive.

<span id="ii.xiii-p40"></span>While God foresees that this will be the
result, he purposely sends his prophets to them, that he may involve the
reprobate in severer condemnation, as is more fully explained by Isaiah,
(<span id="ii.xiii-p40.1"></span>[Isa
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#010)<span id="ii.xiii-p40.1"></span>..md)
This, I acknowledge, is very far from being agreeable to the reason of
the flesh, as we see that unholy despisers of God seize on it as a
plausible excuse for barking, that God, like some cruel tyrant, takes
pleasure in inflicting more severe punishment on men whom, without any
expectation of advantage, he knowingly and willingly hardens more and
more. But by such examples God exercises the modesty of believers. Let
us maintain such sobriety as to tremble and adore what exceeds our
senses. Those who say, that God’s foreknowledge does not hinder
unbelievers from being saved, foolishly make use of an idle defense for
excusing God. I admit that the reprobate, in bringing death upon
themselves, have no intention of doing what God foresaw would happen,
and therefore that the fault of their perishing cannot be ascribed to
His foreknowledge; but I assert that it is improper to employ this
sophistry in defending the justice of God, because it may be immediately
objected that it lies with God to make them repent, for the gift of
faith and repentance is in his power.

<span id="ii.xiii-p41"></span>We shall next be met by this objection,
What is the reason why *God,* by a fixed and deliberate purpose,
appoints the light of his word to blind men? When they have been devoted
to eternal death, why is he not satisfied with their simple ruin? and
why does he wish that they should perish twice or three times? There is
nothing left for us but to ascribe glory to the *judgments of God,* by
exclaiming with Paul, that they are a deep and unfathomable abyss,
(<span id="ii.xiii-p41.1"></span>[Ro
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#033.md)<span
id="ii.xiii-p41.1"></span>.) But it is asked, How does he declare that
the prophecies will turn to the destruction of the Jews, while his
adoption still continued to be in force towards that nation? I reply, As
but a small portion embraced the word by faith for salvation, this
passage relates to the greater number or the whole body; as Isaiah,
after having predicted the general destruction of the nation, is
commanded

<span id="ii.xiii-p42"></span>to seal the law of God among the
disciples, (<span id="ii.xiii-p42.1"></span>[Isa
8:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#016)<span id="ii.xiii-p42.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xiii-p43"></span>Let us know then that, wherever the
Scripture denounces eternal death against the Jews, it excepts a
*remnant,* (<span id="ii.xiii-p43.1"></span>[Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md)<span id="ii.xiii-p43.1"></span>;
<span id="ii.xiii-p43.2"></span>[Ro
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005)<span id="ii.xiii-p43.2"></span>;.md)
that is, those in whom the Lord *preserves some seed* on account of his
free *election*

<span id="ii.xiii-p44"></span><span id="ii.xiii-p44.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p45"></span>**35.** *That upon you may come.* He not
only takes away from them their false boasting, but shows that they had
received *prophets* for a totally different purpose, that no age might
be free from the criminality of wicked rebellion; for the pronoun *you*
embraces generally the whole nation from its very commencement. If it be
objected, that it is not consistent with the judgment of God that
punishment should be inflicted on the children for the sins of the
parents, the answer is easy. Since they are all involved in a wicked
conspiracy, we ought not to think it strange if God, in punishing all
without reserve, make the punishment due to the fathers to fall upon the
children. Justly then is the whole nation — in whatever age individuals
may have lived — called to account, and likewise punished, for this
unceasing contempt. For as God, by an uninterrupted course of patience,
has unceasingly contended with the malice of the whole people, so the
whole people is justly held guilty of the inflexible obstinacy which
continued to the very last; and as every age had conspired to put to
death its own *prophets,* so it is right that a general sentence should
be pronounced upon them, and that all the murders, which have been
perpetrated with one consent, should be avenged on all.

<span id="ii.xiii-p46"></span>*From the blood of Abel.* Though *Abel*
(<span id="ii.xiii-p46.1"></span>[Ge
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen004.htm#008)<span id="ii.xiii-p46.1"></span>.md)
was not slain by the Jews, yet the murder of *Abel* is imputed to them
by Christ, because there is an affinity of wickedness between them and
Cain; otherwise there would have been no propriety in saying that
*righteous blood* had been shed by that *nation from the beginning of
the world.* Cain is therefore declared to be the head, and leader, and
instigator of the Jewish people, because, ever since they began to slay
*prophets,* they succeeded in the room of him whose imitators they were.

<span id="ii.xiii-p47"></span>*To the blood of Zechariah.* He does not
speak of *Zechariah* as the latest martyr; for the Jews did not then put
an end to the murder of the *prophets,* but, on the contrary, their
insolence and madness increased from that period; and posterity, who
followed them, satiated themselves with the blood which their fathers
only tasted. Nor is it because his death was better known, though it is
recorded in Scripture. But there is another reason, which, though it
deserves attention, has escaped the notice of commentators; in
consequence of which they have not only fallen into a mistake, but have
likewise involved their readers in a troublesome question. We might
suppose it to have arisen from forgetfulness on the part of Christ,
that, while he mentions one ancient murder, he passes by a prodigious
slaughter which afterwards took place under Manasseh. For until the Jews
were carried to Babylon, their wicked persecutions of holy men did not
cease; and even while they were still under affliction, we know with
what cruelty and rage they pursued Jeremiah, (<span
id="ii.xiii-p47.1"></span>[Jer
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#002)<span id="ii.xiii-p47.1"></span>..md)
But our Lord on purpose abstains from reproaching them with recent
murders, and selects this murder, which was more ancient—which was also
the commencement and source of base licentiousness, and afterwards led
them to break out into unbounded cruelty—because it was more suitable to
his design. For I have lately explained, that his leading object was to
show that this nation, as it did not desist from impiety, must be held
guilty of all the murders which had been perpetrated during a long
period. Not only, therefore, does he denounce the punishment of their
present cruelty, but says that they must be called to account for the
murder of *Zechariah,* as if their own hands had been imbrued in his
blood.

<span id="ii.xiii-p48"></span>There is no probability in the opinion of
those who refer this passage to that *Zechariah* who exhorted the
people, after their return from the Babylonish captivity, to build the
temple, (<span id="ii.xiii-p48.1"></span>[Zec
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#009)<span id="ii.xiii-p48.1"></span>,.md)
and whose prophecies are still in existence. For though the title of the
book informs us that he was the son of Barachiah, (<span
id="ii.xiii-p48.2"></span>[Zec
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#001)<span id="ii.xiii-p48.2"></span>,.md)
yet we nowhere read that he was slain; and it is, forced exposition to
say, that he was slain during the period that intervened *between* the
building of *the altar and of the temple.* But as to the other
*Zechariah,* son of Jehoiada, the sacred history relates what agrees
perfectly with this passage; that when true religion had fallen into
decay, after the death of his father, through the wicked revolt of the
king and of the people, *the Spirit of God came upon him,* to reprove
severely the public idolatry, and that on this account he was stoned in
the porch of the temple, (<span id="ii.xiii-p48.3"></span>[2 Chr.
24:20](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021)<span id="ii.xiii-p48.3"></span>..md)
There is no absurdity in supposing that his father Jehoiada received, in
token of respect, the surname of *Barachiah,* because, having throughout
his whole life defended the true worship, he might justly be pronounced
to be the *Blessed of God.* But whether Jehoiada had two names, or
whether (as Jerome thinks) there is a mistake in the word, there can be
no doubt as to the fact, that Christ refers to that impious stoning of
Zechariah which is recorded in <span id="ii.xiii-p48.4"></span>[2 Chr.
24:21](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/ch2024.htm#022.md)<span id="ii.xiii-p48.4"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p49"></span>*Whom you slew between the temple and the
altar.* The crime is rendered still more heinous by the circumstance of
the place, since they did not revere the sacredness of *the temple.*
Here *the temple* is put for the outer court, as in other passages. Near
it was the *altar of burnt offerings,* (<span
id="ii.xiii-p49.1"></span>[1 Kings
8:64](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#064.md), [1 Kings
18:30](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#030.md)<span
id="ii.xiii-p49.1"></span>,) so that the priest offered the sacrifices
in presence of the people. It is evident, therefore, that there must
have been furious rage, when the sight of *the altar and of the temple*
could not restrain the *Jews* from profaning that sacred place by a
detestable murder.

<span id="ii.xiii-p50"></span><span id="ii.xiii-p50.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p51"></span>**37.** *Jerusalem, Jerusalem.* By these
words, Christ shows more clearly what good reason he had for
indignation, that *Jerusalem,* which God had chosen to be his sacred,
and — as we might say — heavenly abode, not only had shown itself to be
unworthy of so great an honor, but, as if it had been a den of robbers,
(<span id="ii.xiii-p51.2"></span>[Jer
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#011)<span id="ii.xiii-p51.2"></span>,.md)
had been long accustomed to suck the blood of the prophets. Christ
therefore utters a pathetic exclamation at a sight so monstrous, as that
the holy city of God should have arrived at such a pitch of madness,
that it had long endeavored to extinguish the saving doctrine of God by
shedding *the blood of the prophets.* This is also implied in the
repetition of the name, because impiety so monstrous and incredible
deserves no ordinary detestation.

<span id="ii.xiii-p52"></span>*Thou who killest the prophets.* Christ
does not reproach them with merely one or another murder, but says that
this custom was so deeply rooted, that the city did not care to slay
every one of *the prophets* that were sent to it. For the participle,
(<span id="ii.xiii-p52.1"></span>ἀποκτείνουσα τοὺς προφήτας), (*killing*
*the prophets,)* is put for an epithet; as if Christ had said, “Thou who
oughtest to have been a faithful guardian of the word of God, a teacher
of heavenly wisdom, the light of the world, the fountain of sound
doctrine, the seat of divine worship, a pattern of faith and obedience,
art a murderer of *the prophets,* so that thou hast acquired a certain
habit of sucking their blood.”  <span id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md)
Hence it is evident, that they who had so basely profaned the sanctuary
of God deserved every kind of reproaches. Yet Christ had likewise the
intention to obviate the scandal which soon after arose, that believers,
when they saw him basely put to death at Jerusalem, might not be
confounded by the novelty of such an exhibition. For by these words they
were already warned that it was not wonderful if a city, which had been
accustomed to strangle or stone *the prophets,* should cruelly put to
death its own Redeemer. This shows us what value we should attach to
places. There never certainly was a city in the world on which God
bestowed such magnificent titles, or such distinguished honor; and yet
we see how deeply it was sunk by its ingratitude.

<span id="ii.xiii-p54"></span>Let the Pope now compare the abode of his
robbery with that holy city; what will he find worthy of equal honor?
His hired flatterers boast to us that the faith flourished there in
ancient times. But admitting this to be true, if it is evident that it
has now, by wicked rebellion, revolted from Christ, and is full of
innumerable deeds of sacrilege, what folly is it in them to maintain
that the honor of primacy belongs to it? Let us, on the contrary, learn
from this memorable example, that when any place has been exalted by
uncommon instances of the favor of God, and thus has been removed from
the ordinary rank, if it degenerate, it will not only be stripped of its
ornaments, but will become so much the more hateful and detestable,
because it has basely profaned the glow of God by staining the beauty of
his favors.

<span id="ii.xiii-p55"></span>*How often would I have gathered together
thy children.* This is expressive of indignation rather than of
compassion. The city itself, indeed, over which he had lately wept,
(<span id="ii.xiii-p55.1"></span>[Lu
19:41](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#041.md)<span
id="ii.xiii-p55.1"></span>,) is still an object of his compassion; but
towards the scribes, who were the authors of its destruction, he uses
harshness and severity, as they deserved. And yet he does not spare the
rest, who were all guilty of approving and partaking of the same crime,
but, including all in the same condemnation, he inveighs chiefly against
the leaders themselves, who were the cause of all the evils. We must now
observe the vehemence of the discourse. If in *Jerusalem* the grace of
God had been merely rejected, there would have been inexcusable
ingratitude; but since God attempted to draw the Jews to himself by mild
and gentle methods, and gained nothing by such kindness, the criminality
of such haughty disdain was far more aggravated. There was likewise
added unconquerable obstinacy; for not once and again did God *wish to
gather them together,* but, by constant and uninterrupted advances, he
sent to them *the prophets,* one after another, almost all of whom were
rejected by the great body of the people.

<span id="ii.xiii-p56"></span>*As a hen collecteth her brood under her
wings.* We now perceive the reason why Christ, speaking in the person of
God, compares himself to *a hen.* It is to inflict deeper disgrace on
this wicked nation, which had treated with disdain invitations so
gentle, and proceeding from more than maternal kindness. It is an
amazing and unparalleled instance of love, that he did not disdain to
stoop to those blandishments, by which he might tame rebels into
subjection. A reproof nearly similar is employed by Moses, that God,
like

<span id="ii.xiii-p57"></span>an eagle with outspread wings, (<span
id="ii.xiii-p57.1"></span>[De
32:11](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.xiii-p57.1"></span>,)

<span id="ii.xiii-p58"></span>embraced that people. And though in more
than one way God *spread out his wings* to cherish that people, yet this
form of expression is applied by Christ, in a peculiar manner, to one
class, namely, that *prophets* were sent to *gather together* the
wandering and dispersed into the bosom of God. By this he means that,
whenever the word of God is exhibited to us, he opens his bosom to us
with maternal kindness, and, not satisfied with this, condescends to the
humble affection of *a hen* watching over her *chickens.* Hence it
follows, that our obstinacy is truly monstrous, if we do not permit him
to *gather us together.* And, indeed, if we consider, on the one hand,
the dreadful majesty of God, and, on the other, our mean and low
condition, we cannot but be ashamed and astonished at such amazing
goodness. For what object can God have in view in abasing himself so low
on our account? When he compares himself to a mother, he descends very
far below his glory; how much more when he takes the form of *a hen,*
and deigns to treat us as his *chickens?*

<span id="ii.xiii-p59"></span>Besides, if this charge was justly brought
against the ancient people, who lived under the Law, it is far more
applicable to us. For though the statement—which I quoted a little ago
from Moses—was always true, and though the complaints which we find in
Isaiah are just, that

<span id="ii.xiii-p60"></span>in vain did God spread out his hands every
day to embrace a hard-hearted and rebellious people, (<span
id="ii.xiii-p60.1"></span>[Isa
65:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#002)<span id="ii.xiii-p60.1"></span>.md)

<span id="ii.xiii-p61"></span>that, though he rose up early, (<span
id="ii.xiii-p61.1"></span>[Jer
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#013)<span id="ii.xiii-p61.1"></span>.md)
he gained nothing by his incessant care of them; yet now, with far
greater familiarity and kindness, he invites us to himself by his Son.
And, therefore, whenever he exhibits to us the doctrine of the Gospel,
dreadful vengeance awaits us, if we do not quietly hide ourselves under
his wings, by which he is ready to receive and shelter us. Christ
teaches us, at the same time, that all enjoy safety and rest who, by the
obedience of faith, are *gathered together* to God; because *under his
wings* they have an impregnable refuge.  <span
id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md)

<span id="ii.xiii-p63"></span>We must attend likewise to the other part
of this accusation, that God, notwithstanding the obstinate rebellion of
his ancient people, was not all at once so much offended by it, as to
lay aside a father’s love and a mother’s anxiety, since he did not cease
to send *prophets* after *prophets* in uninterrupted succession; as in
our own day, though he has experienced a marvelous depravity in the
world, he still continues to dispense his grace. But these words contain
still deeper instruction, namely, that the Jews, as soon as the Lord
*gathered them together,* immediately left him. Hence came dispersions
so frequent, that they scarcely remained at rest for a single moment
*under the wings* of God, as we see in the present day a certain
wildness in the world, which has indeed existed in all ages; and,
therefore, it is necessary that God should recall to himself those who
are wandering and going astray. But this is the crowning point of
desperate and final depravity, when men obstinately reject the goodness
of God, and refuse to come *under his wings.*

<span id="ii.xiii-p64"></span>I said formerly that Christ speaks here in
the person of God, and my meaning is, that this discourse belongs
properly to his eternal Godhead; for he does not now speak of what he
began to do since he was manifested in the flesh, (<span
id="ii.xiii-p64.1"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)<span id="ii.xiii-p64.1"></span>,.md)
but of the care which he exercised about the salvation of his people
from the beginning. Now we know that the Church was governed by God in
such a manner that Christ, as the Eternal Wisdom of God, presided over
it. In this sense Paul says, not that God the Father was tempted in the
wilderness, but that Christ himself was tempted,  <span
id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) (<span id="ii.xiii-p65.2"></span>[1Co
10:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#009)<span id="ii.xiii-p65.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.xiii-p66"></span>Again, when the sophists seize on this
passage, to prove free will, and to set aside the secret predestination
of God, the answer is easy. “God *wills* to gather all men,” say they;
“and therefore all are at liberty to come, and their *will* does not
depend on the election of God.” I reply: The *will* of God, which is
here mentioned, must be judged from the result. For since by his word he
calls all men indiscriminately to salvation, and since the end of
preaching is, that all should betake themselves to his guardianship and
protection, it may justly be said that he *wills* to gather all to
himself. It is not, therefore, the secret purpose of God, but his
*will,* which is manifested by the nature of the word, that is here
described; for, undoubtedly, whomsoever he efficaciously *wills* to
*gather,* he inwardly draws by his Spirit, and does not merely invite by
the outward voice of man.

<span id="ii.xiii-p67"></span>If it be objected, that it is absurd to
suppose the existence of two *wills* in God, I reply, we fully believe
that his *will* is simple and one; but as our minds do not fathom the
deep abyss of secret election, in accommodation to the capacity of our
weakness, the *will* of God is exhibited to us in two ways. And I am
astonished at the obstinacy of some people, who, when in many passages
of Scripture they meet with that figure of speech  <span
id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) (<span
id="ii.xiii-p68.5"></span>ἀνθρωποπάθεια) which attributes to God human
feelings, take no offense, but in this case alone refuse to admit it.
But as I have elsewhere treated this subject fully, that I may not be
unnecessarily tedious, I only state briefly that, whenever the doctrine,
which is the standard of union,  <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md)
is brought forward, God *wills* to *gather* all, that all who do not
come may be inexcusable.

<span id="ii.xiii-p70"></span>*And you would not.* This may be supposed
to refer to the whole nation, as well as to the *scribes;* but I rather
interpret it in reference to the latter, by whom the *gathering
together,*  <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) was chiefly
prevented. For it was against them that Christ inveighed throughout the
whole of the passage; and now, after having addressed *Jerusalem* in the
singular number, it appears not without reason that he immediately used
the plural number. There is an emphatic contrast between God’s *willing*
and their *not willing;*  <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) for it
expresses the diabolical rage of men, who do not hesitate to contradict
God.

<span id="ii.xiii-p73"></span><span id="ii.xiii-p73.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p74"></span>**38** *Lo,* *your house is left to you
desolate.* He threatens the destruction of the temple, and the
dissolution of the whole frame of civil government. Though they were
disfigured by irreligion, crimes, and every kind of infamy, yet they
were so blinded by a foolish confidence in the temple, and its outward
service, that they thought that God was bound to them; and this was the
shield which they had always at hand: “What? Could God depart from that
place which he has chosen to be his only habitation in the world? And
since he dwells in the midst of us, we must one day be restored.” In
short, they looked upon the temple as their invincible fortress, as if
they dwelt in the bosom of God. But Christ maintains that it is in vain
for them to boast of the presence of God, whom they had driven away by
their crimes, and, by calling it *their house, (lo, your house* *is left
to you,)* he indirectly intimates to them that it is no longer *the
house of God.* The temple had indeed been built on the condition, that
at the coming of Christ it would cease to be the abode and residence of
Deity; but it would have remained as a remarkable demonstration of the
continued grace of God, if its destruction had not been occasioned by
the wickedness of the people. It was therefore a dreadful vengeance of
God, that the place which Himself had so magnificently adorned was not
only forsaken by Him, and ordered to be razed to the foundation, but
consigned to the lowest infamy to the end of the world. Let the
Romanists now go, and let them proceed, in opposition to the will of
God, to build their Tower of Babylon, while they see that the temple of
God, which had been built by his authority and at his command, was laid
low on account of the crimes of the people.

<span id="ii.xiii-p75"></span><span id="ii.xiii-p75.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p76"></span>**39.** *For I tell you.* He confirms what
he had said about the approaching vengeance of God, by saying that the
only method of avoiding destruction will be taken from them. For that
was *the accepted time, the day of salvation,* (<span
id="ii.xiii-p76.1"></span>[Isa
49:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008.md)<span id="ii.xiii-p76.1"></span>;
<span id="ii.xiii-p76.2"></span>[2Co
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#002)<span id="ii.xiii-p76.2"></span>,.md)
so long as that very person who had come to be their Redeemer, attested
and proclaimed the redemption which he had brought. But at his
departure, as at the setting of the sun, the light of life vanished; and
therefore this dreadful calamity, which he threatens, must of necessity
fall upon them.

<span id="ii.xiii-p77"></span>*Until you say.* We come now to inquire
what period is denoted by this phrase. Some restrict it to the last day
of judgment. Others think that it is a prediction, which was soon
afterwards fulfilled, when some of the Jews humbly adored Christ. But I
do not approve of either of these interpretations. And I am certainly
astonished that learned men should have stumbled at so small an
obstacle, by taking great pains to inquire how unbelievers can say
concerning Christ, *Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord;*
for he does not declare what they will be, but what he himself will do.
And even the adverb *until* extends no farther than to the time which
goes before. Joseph did not know his wife *until* she brought forth
Christ, (<span id="ii.xiii-p77.1"></span>[Mt
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#025)<span id="ii.xiii-p77.1"></span>..md)
By these words Scripture does not mean, that after Christ had been born
they lived together as husband and wife, but only shows that Mary,
before the birth of her son, was a virgin that had not known man.

<span id="ii.xiii-p78"></span>So then the true meaning of the present
passage, in nay opinion, is this: *“Hitherto* I have lived among you in
humility and kindness, and have discharged the office of a teacher; and
no having finished the course of my calling, I shall depart, and it will
not be possible for you any longer to enjoy my presence, but him whom
you now despise as a Redeemer and a minister of salvation, you will find
to be your Judge.” In this manner the passage agrees with the words of
Zechariah, *They shall look on him whom they pierced,* (<span
id="ii.xiii-p78.1"></span>[Zec
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md)<span id="ii.xiii-p78.1"></span>;
<span id="ii.xiii-p78.2"></span>[Joh
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#037.md)<span
id="ii.xiii-p78.2"></span>.) But Christ appears also to make an indirect
allusion to their vain hypocrisy, because, as if they ardently longed
for the promised salvation, they sung daily the words of the psalm,

<span id="ii.xiii-p79"></span>Blessed be he that cometh in the name of
the Lord,  
(<span id="ii.xiii-p79.2"></span>[Ps
118:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.xiii-p79.2"></span>;)

<span id="ii.xiii-p80"></span>while they treated with scorn the Redeemer
that was offered to them. In short, he declares that he will not come to
them *until,* trembling at the sight of his dreadful majesty, they shall
exclaim—when it is too late—that truly he is the Son of God. And this
threatening is addressed to all despisers of the Gospel, more especially
to those who falsely profess his name, while they reject his doctrine;
for they will one day acknowledge that they cannot escape the hands of
him whom they now mock by their hypocritical pretensions. For the same
song is now sung by the Papists, who, after all, care nothing about
Christ, *until,* armed with vengeance, he ascends his tribunal. We are
also reminded, that so long as Christ exhibits himself to us in the name
of the Father as the herald of salvation and Mediator, we ought not only
to honor him with our lips, but sincerely to wish that he would make us
and the whole world subject to himself.

<span id="ii.xiii-p81"></span><span id="ii.xiii-p81.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xiii-p82"></span>**<span id="ii.xiii-p82.2"></span>[Luke
11:53](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#053.md)<span
id="ii.xiii-p82.2"></span>.** *And while he was saying these things to
them.* I have formerly mentioned that the preceding sentences were not
inserted by Luke in their proper place. For while he was relating that
Christ at a dinner reproved the scribes, he introduced also the latest
discourses by which, a little before his death, he reproved their wicked
courses; and in like manner, the reproof which we have just now examined
is inserted by Luke, in connection with a different narrative. If any
one prefer to follow the opinion of those who conjecture that Christ
repeated the same discourses on various occasions, I have no great
objection. After pronouncing the curses which have been now explained,
he concludes by saying that all the scribes became more inveterate
against Christ, so that they did not cease to *entrap him by ensnaring
questions;* which ought to be referred to the conversation held at the
table, rather than to his latest discourse. But I have not thought it a
matter of great importance to be very exact about the time — a matter
which the Evangelist has disregarded.

[Next: Mark 12:41-44; Luke 21:1-4](cc33015.md)
