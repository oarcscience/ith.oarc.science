<span id="ii.xviii-p5"></span>**29.** And immediately after the
tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall
not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers
of heaven shall be shaken. **30.** And then shall appear the sign of the
Son of man in heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn;
and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with
great power and glory. **31.** And he shall send his angels with a loud
sound of a trumpet; and they shall gather together his elect from the
four winds, from one extremity of heaven to the other.

<span id="ii.xviii-p6"></span>**24.** But in those days, after that
tribulation, shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her
light. **25.** And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers which
are in heaven shall be shaken. **26.** And then shall they see the Son
of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. **27.** And then
shall he send his angels, and gather together his elect from the four
winds, from the extremity of the earth to the extremity of heaven.

<span id="ii.xviii-p7"></span>**25.** And there shall be signs in the
sun, and in the moon, and in the stars, and on the earth the anguish of
nations in despair, the sea and the waves roaring: **26.** Men fainting
through fear,  <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) and expectation
of those things which shall come on the world; for the powers of heaven
shall be shaken. **27.** And then shall they see the Son of man coming
in a cloud with great power and glory. **28.** But when these things
begin to take place, look up, and lift up your heads, for your
redemption is at hand.

<span id="ii.xviii-p9"></span> 

<span id="ii.xviii-p10"></span><span id="ii.xviii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xviii-p11"></span>**<span
id="ii.xviii-p11.2"></span>[Matthew
24:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#029.md)<span
id="ii.xviii-p11.2"></span>.** *And immediately after the tribulation of
those days.* Christ comes now to speak of the full manifestation of his
kingdom, about which he was at first interrogated by the disciples, and
promises that, after they have been tried by so many distressing events,
the redemption will arrive in due time. The principal object of his
reply was, to confirm his disciples in good hope, that they might not be
dismayed on account of the troubles and confusion that would arise. For
this reason, he does not speak of *his coming* in simple terms, but
employs those modes of expression which were common among the prophets,
by which, the more attentively they were considered, so much the more
severe would be the contest of temptation experienced by the reader, in
consequence of the opposite character of the event. For what could be
more strange than to see the kingdom of Christ not only despised, but
oppressed by the cross, loaded with many reproaches, and overwhelmed by
every kind of *tribulation, that* kingdom which the prophets had
frequently described in such magnificent language? Might it not be
asked, where was that majesty which would darken *the sun, and moon, and
stars,* shake the whole frame of the world, and change the ordinary
course of nature? Our Lord now meets these temptations, declaring that,
though these predictions are not immediately fulfilled, they will at
length be fully justified by the event. The meaning therefore is, that
the predictions which had been formerly made about the miraculous
*shaking of heaven and earth,* ought not to be restricted to the
commencement of redemption, because the prophets had embraced the whole
course of it, till it should arrive at perfection.

<span id="ii.xviii-p12"></span>Having now ascertained Christ’s
intention, we shall have no difficulty in perceiving the meaning of the
words to be, that *heaven* will not be *darkened* immediately, but after
that the Church shall have passed through the whole course of its
*tribulations.* Not that the glory and majesty of the kingdom of Christ
will not appear till his last coming, but because till that time is
delayed the accomplishment of those things which began to take place
after his resurrection, and of which God gave to his people nothing more
than a taste, that he might lead them farther on in the path of hope and
patience. According to this argument, Christ keeps the minds of
believers in a state of suspense till the last day, that they may not
imagine those declarations which the prophets made, about the future
restoration, to have failed of their accomplishment, because they lie
buried for a long period under the thick *darkness* of *tribulations.*

<span id="ii.xviii-p13"></span>*The tribulation of those days* is
improperly interpreted by some commentators to mean the destruction of
Jerusalem; for, on the contrary, it is a general recapitulation (<span
id="ii.xviii-p13.1"></span>ἀνακεφαλαίωσις) of all the evils of which
Christ had previously spoken. To encourage his followers to patience, he
employs this argument, that the *tribulations* will at length have a
happy and joyful result. As if he had said, “So long as the Church shall
continue its pilgrimage in the world, there will be dark and cloudy
weather; but as soon as an end shall have been put to those distresses,
a day will arrive when the majesty of the Church shall be illustriously
displayed.” In what manner *the sun will be darkened* we cannot now
conjecture, but the event will show. He does not indeed mean that *the
stars* will actually fall, but according to the apprehension of men; and
accordingly Luke only predicts that *there will be signs* *in the sun,
and in the moon, and in the stars.* The meaning therefore is, that there
will be such a violent commotion of the firmament of heaven, that *the
stars* themselves will be supposed *to fall.* Luke also adds that there
will be a dreadful commotion of the sea, *the sea and the waves roaring,
so that men will faint through fear* and alarm. In a word, all the
creatures above and below will be, as it were, heralds to summon men to
that tribunal, which they will continue to treat with ungodly and wanton
contempt till the last day.

<span id="ii.xviii-p14"></span><span id="ii.xviii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xviii-p15"></span>**30.** *Then shall appear the sign of
the Son of man.* By this term Christ points out more clearly the
difference between the present condition of his kingdom and its future
glory; for it is a sort of admission that, amidst the *darkness* of
*tribulations,* the majesty of Christ will not fully appear, and men
will not perceive the redemption which he has brought. The confused
mixture of things which we now perceive does certainly, on the one hand,
*darken* our minds, and, on the other hand, bury the grace of Christ,
and make it almost vanish from our sight, so that the salvation obtained
by him, so far as relates to the perception of the flesh, is not
comprehended. And therefore he declares that he will appear openly at
his last coming and, surrounded by the heavenly power, which will be a
*sign* erected on an elevated spot, he will turn the eyes of the whole
world upon himself.  <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md)

<span id="ii.xviii-p17"></span>Perceiving that the greater part of men
would despise his doctrine and oppose his reign, he threatens also
against all nations *mourning* and *lamentation;* because it is proper,
that by his presence he should crush and destroy the rebels, who, while
he was absent, despised his authority. He says this, partly to bring the
haughty and refractory to repentance, by striking them with terror; and
partly to confirm the minds of his followers amidst so great obstinacy
existing in the world. For it is no slight ground of offense to see the
ungodly living without concern, because they think that their mockery of
God will remain unpunished; and again, there is nothing to which we are
more prone than to be captivated by the allurements of the prosperity
which they enjoy, so as to lose the fear of God. That the joy by which
they are intoxicated may not excite the envy of believers, Christ
declares that it will at length be turned into *mourning* and *gnashing
of teeth.*

<span id="ii.xviii-p18"></span>He alludes, I think, to <span
id="ii.xviii-p18.1"></span>[Zec
12:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#011.md)<span
id="ii.xviii-p18.1"></span>, where God, informing them that a striking
display of his judgment will soon be made, declares that there will be
*lamentation in every family,* such as is not usually seen at the
funeral of a first-born son. There is no reason, therefore, why any
person should expect the conversion of the world, for at length—when it
will be too late, and will yield them no advantage—

<span id="ii.xviii-p19"></span>they shall look on him whom they
pierced,  
(<span id="ii.xviii-p19.2"></span>[Zec
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.xviii-p19.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xviii-p20"></span>Next follows the explanation of that
*sin,* that *they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds,* who at
that time was living on earth in the garb of a despised servant. And
thus he warns them that the glory of his kingdom will be heavenly, and
not earthly, as the disciples had falsely imagined.

<span id="ii.xviii-p21"></span><span id="ii.xviii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xviii-p22"></span>*And he shall send his angels.* He
describes the effect of his power, that *he will send his angels to
gather his elect* from the most distant parts of the world; for by *the
extremity of heaven* is meant the most distant region. But Christ speaks
hyperbolically, in order to show that *the elect,* even though they were
carried away from the earth and scattered in the air, will again be
gathered, so to be united in the enjoyment of eternal life under Him as
their head, and enjoy the expected inheritance; for Christ intended to
console his disciples, that they might not be altogether discouraged by
the lamentable dispersion of the Church. Whenever, therefore, we
perceive the Church scattered by the wiles of Satan, or torn in pieces
by the cruelty of the ungodly, or disturbed by false doctrines, or
tossed about by storms, let us learn to turn our eyes to this *gathering
of the elect.* And if it appear to us a thing difficult to be believed,
let us call to remembrance the power of *the angels,* which Christ holds
out to us for the express purpose of raising our views above human
means. For, though the Church be now tormented by the malice of men, or
even broken by the violence of the billows, and miserably torn in
pieces, so as to have no stability in the world, yet we ought always to
cherish confident hope, because it will not be by human means, but by
heavenly power, which will be far superior to every obstacle, that the
Lord will *gather* his Church.

<span id="ii.xviii-p23"></span><span id="ii.xviii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xviii-p24"></span>**<span id="ii.xviii-p24.2"></span>[Luke
21:28](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.xviii-p24.2"></span>.** *And when these things begin to take
place.* Luke expresses more clearly the consolation by which Christ
animates the minds of his followers; for, though this sentence contains
nothing different from the words of Matthew, which we have just now
explained, yet it shows better for what purpose *the angels will come,*
as we are told, *to gather the elect.* For it was necessary to contrast
the joy of the godly with the general sorrow and distress of the world,
and to point out the difference between them and the reprobate, that
they might not view with horror the coming of Christ. We know that
Scripture, when it speaks not only of the last judgment, but of all the
judgments which God executes every day, describes them in a variety of
ways, according as the discourse is addressed to believers or to
unbelievers.

<span id="ii.xviii-p25"></span>To what purpose is the day of the Lord to
you?  
says the prophet Amos, (<span id="ii.xviii-p25.2"></span>[Am
5:18](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.xviii-p25.2"></span>.)

<span id="ii.xviii-p26"></span>It is a day of darkness and gloominess,
 <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) not of light; of sorrow, not of
joy; of destruction, not of salvation. On the other hand, Zechariah
(<span id="ii.xviii-p27.3"></span>[Zec
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#009)<span id="ii.xviii-p27.3"></span>.md)
bids the *daughter of Zion rejoice* on account of the *coming* of her
*King;* and justly, for—as Isaiah (<span id="ii.xviii-p27.4"></span>[Isa
35:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa035.htm#004)<span id="ii.xviii-p27.4"></span>.md)
tells us—the same day which brings wrath and vengeance to the reprobate
brings good-will and *redemption* to believers.

<span id="ii.xviii-p28"></span>Christ therefore shows that, at his
coming, the light of joy will arise on his disciples, that they may
rejoice in the approaching salvation, while the wicked are overwhelmed
with terror. Accordingly, Paul distinguishes them by this mark, that
they *wait for* the *day* or *coming of the Lord,* (<span
id="ii.xviii-p28.1"></span>[1Co
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#007)<span id="ii.xviii-p28.1"></span>.md)
for that which is their *crown,* and perfect happiness, and solace, is
delayed till *that day,* (<span id="ii.xviii-p28.2"></span>[2Ti
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/ti2004.htm#008)<span id="ii.xviii-p28.2"></span>..md)
It is therefore called here (as in <span id="ii.xviii-p28.3"></span>[Ro
8:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#023)<span id="ii.xviii-p28.3"></span>.md)
*redemption;* because we shall then obtain truly and perfectly the
consequences of the deliverance obtained through Christ. Let our ears
therefore be awake to the sound of the *angel’s trumpet,* which will
then sound, not only to strike the reprobate with the dread of death,
but to arouse the elect to a second life; that is, to call to the
enjoyment of life those whom the Lord now quickens by the voice of his
Gospel; for it is a sign of infidelity, to be afraid when the Son of God
comes in person for our salvation.
