<span id="ii.xliv-p3"></span>**62. **And the next day, which is after
the preparation,  <span id="fr_296"></span>[297](#fn_296.md) the chief
priests and Pharisees came to Pilate, **63. **Saying, Sir, we remember
that that impostor said, while he was still alive, After three days I
shall rise again. **64. **Command, therefore, that the sepulcher be made
secure till the third day, lest perhaps his disciples come by night to
steal him, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead; and the
last error shall be worse than the first. **65. **Pilate saith to them,
You have a guard; go, make it as secure as you can. **66. **And they
went and made the sepulcher secures sealing the stone, and posting
guards.

27:62](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#062.md)<span
id="ii.xliv-p7.1"></span>.** *And the next day.* In this narrative
Matthew did not so much intend to show with what determined rage the
scribes and priests pursued Christ, as to exhibit to us, as in a mirror,
the amazing providence of God in proving the resurrection of his Son.
Cunning men, practiced at least in fraud and treachery, plot among
themselves, and contrive a method by which they may extinguish the
memory of a dead man; for they see that they have gained nothing, if
they do not destroy the certainty of the resurrection. But while they
are attempting to do this, they appear rather as if they had expressly
intended to bring it forth to the light, that it might be known. The
resurrection of Christ would undoubtedly have been less manifest, or, at
least, they would have had more plausible grounds for denying it, if
they had not taken pains to station witnesses at the sepulcher. We see
then how the Lord not only *disappointeth the crafty,* (<span
id="ii.xliv-p7.2"></span>[Job
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/job005.htm#012)<span id="ii.xliv-p7.2"></span>,.md)
but employs even their own schemes as snares for holding them fast, that
he may draw and compel them to render obedience to him. The enemies of
Christ were indeed unworthy of having his resurrection made known to
them; but it was proper that their insolence should be exposed, and
every occasion of slander taken away from them, and that even their
consciences should be convinced, so that they might not be held
excusable for ignorance. Yet let us observe that God, as if he had hired
them for the purpose, employed their services for rendering the glory of
Christ more illustrious, because no plausible ground for lying, in order
to deny it, was left to them when they found the grave empty; not that
they desisted from their wicked rage, but with all persons of correct
and sober judgment it was a sufficient testimony that Christ was risen,
since his body, which had been placed in a grave, and protected by
guards who surrounded it on all sides, was not to be found.

<span id="ii.xliv-p8"></span><span id="ii.xliv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xliv-p9"></span>**63.** We *remember that that impostor
said.* This thought was suggested to them by divine inspiration, not
only that the Lord might execute upon them just vengeance for their
wickedness, (as he always punishes bad consciences by secret torments,)
but chiefly in order to restrain their unholy tongues. Yet we again
perceive what insensibility seizes on wicked men, when they are
bewitched by Satan. They go so far as to call him an *impostor,* whose
divine power and glory were lately manifested by so many miracles. This
certainly was not to defy the clouds, but to spit in the face of God, so
to speak, by ridiculing the brightness of the sun. Such examples show us
that we ought, with pious and modest thoughtfulness, to direct our
attention early to the glory of God when it is presented to our view,
that our hardness of heart may not lead us to brutal and dreadful
blindness. Now though it may appear strange and absurd for wicked men to
indulge in such wicked mockery over Christ when dead, that our minds may
not be rendered uneasy by this licentiousness, we ought always to
consider wisely the purpose to which the Lord turns it. Wicked men
imagine that they will overwhelm the whole of the doctrine of Christ,
together with his miracles, by that single blasphemy, which they
haughtily vomit out; but God employs no other persons than themselves
for vindicating his Son from all blame of *imposture.* Whenever these
wicked men shall labor to overturn everything by their calumnies, and
shall launch out into unmeasured slander, let us wait with composure and
tranquillity of mind until God bring light out of darkness.

<span id="ii.xliv-p11"></span>**65.** *You have a guard.* By these
words, Pilate means that he grants their request by permitting them to
post soldiers to keep watch. This, permission bound them more firmly, so
that they could not escape by any evasion; for though they were not
ashamed to break out against Christ after his resurrection, yet with
Pilate’s signet they as truly shut their own mouths as they shut up the
sepulcher.
