<span id="ii.xlv-p5"></span>**1. **Now in the evening of the Sabbaths,
 <span id="fr_297"></span>[298](#fn_297.md) which began to dawn towards the
first of the Sabbaths, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see
the sepulcher. **2. **And lo, there was a great earthquake; for the
angel of the Lord came down from heaven, and approached, and rolled away
the stone from the door, and sat upon it. **3. **And his countenance was
like lightning, and his raiment was white as snow. **4. **And through
fear of him the guards trembled, and became as dead men. **5. **But the
angel answering, said to the women, Fear not; for I know that you seek
Jesus, who was crucified. **6. **He is not here; for he is risen, as he
said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay: **7. **And go quickly, and
tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, lo, he goeth
before you into Galilee; there shall you see him: lo, I have told you.

<span id="ii.xlv-p7"></span>**1. **And when the Sabbath was past, Mary
Magdalene, and Mary, the wife of James, and Salome, bought spices to
come and anoint him. **2. **And very early in the morning of the first
day of the Sabaths,  <span id="fr_298"></span>[299](#fn_298.md) They come
to the tomb at the rising of the sun.  <span
id="fr_299"></span>[300](#fn_299.md) **3. **And they said among themselves,
Who shall roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?
**4. **And having looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away; for
it was very great. **5. **And entering the tomb, they saw a young man
sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe; and they were
afraid. **6. **But he saith to them, Be not terrified: you seek Jesus of
Nazareth, who was crucified; he is risen, he is not here: lo, the place
where they laid him. **7. **But go away, tell his disciples and Peter,
that he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall you see him, as he
said to you.

<span id="ii.xlv-p10"></span>**1. **And on the first day of the
Sabbaths, very early in the morning, they came to the tomb, carrying the
spices which they had prepared, and some women with them. **2. **And
they found the stone rolled away from the tomb. **3. **And having
entered, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus. **4. **And it
happened, while they were in consternation on this account, lo, two men
stood near them in shining garments. **5. **And when the women were
terrified, and bowed their face to the earth, they said to them, Why do
you seek the living among the dead? **6. **He is not here, but is risen:
remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, **7. **Saying,
that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of the wicked men,
and be crucified and rise again on the third day. **8. **And they
remembered his words.

<span id="ii.xlv-p11"></span> 

<span id="ii.xlv-p12"></span><span id="ii.xlv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlv-p13"></span>We now come to the closing scene of our
redemption. For the lively assurance of our reconciliation with God
arises from Christ having come from hell as the conqueror of death, in
order to show that he had the power of a new life at his disposal.
Justly, therefore, does Paul say that there will be no gospel, and that
the hope of salvation will be vain and fruitless, unless we believe that
*Christ is risen from the dead,* (<span id="ii.xlv-p13.2"></span>[1Co
15:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#014)<span id="ii.xlv-p13.2"></span>..md)
For then did Christ obtain righteousness for us, and open up our
entrance into heaven; and, in short, then was our adoption ratified,
when Christ, by rising from the dead, exerted the power of his Spirit,
and proved himself to be the Son of God. No though he manifested his
resurrection in a different manner from what the sense of our flesh
would have desired, still the method of which he approved ought to be
regarded by us also as the best. he went out of the grave without a
witness, that the emptiness of the place might be the earliest
indication; next, he chose to have it announced to the women by the
angels that he was alive; and shortly afterwards he appeared to the
women, and, finally, to the apostles, and on various occasions.

<span id="ii.xlv-p14"></span>Thus he gradually brought his followers,
according to their capacity, to a larger measure of knowledge. He began
with *the women,* and not only presented himself to be seen by them, but
even gave them a commission to announce the gospel to the apostles, so
as to become their instructors. This was intended, first, to chastise
the indifference of the apostles, who were like persons half-dead with
fear, while the women ran with alacrity to the sepulcher, and likewise
obtained no ordinary reward. For though their design to anoint Christ,
as if Ire were still dead, was not free from blame, still he forgave
their weakness, and bestowed on them distinguished honor, by taking away
from men the apostolic office, and committing it to them for a short
time. In this manner also he exhibited an instance of what Paul tells
us, that he *chooses those things which are foolish and weak in the
world* to abase the loftiness of the flesh. And never shall we be duly
prepared to learn this article of our faith in any other manner than by
laying aside all pride, and submitting to receive the testimony of the
women. Not that our faith ought to be confined within such narrow
limits, but because the Lord, in order to make trial of our faith,
determines that we shall become fools, before he admits us to a more
ample knowledge of his mysteries.

<span id="ii.xlv-p15"></span>So far as regards the narrative, Matthew
says only that *the two Marys came to see the sepulcher;* Mark adds a
third, *Salome,* and says that they *bought spices to anoint the body;*
and from Luke we infer, that not two or three only, but many women came.
But we know that it is customary with the sacred writers, when speaking
of a great number, to name but a few of them. It may also be conjectured
with probability, that *Mary Magdalene,* with another companion—whether
she was sent before, or ran forward of her own accord arrived at the
grave before the rest of the women. And this appears to be conveyed by
the words of Matthew, that those two women *came for the purpose of
seeing;* for without *seeing* Christ:, they had no means of anointing
him. He says nothing, in the meantime, about the purpose which they had
formed of doing honor to him; for the principal object which he had in
view was, to testify of the resurrection.

<span id="ii.xlv-p16"></span>But it may be asked, how could this zeal of
the women, which was mixed with superstition, be acceptable to God? I
have no doubt, that the custom of anointing the dead, which they had
borrowed from the Fathers, was applied by them to its proper object,
which was, to draw consolation, amidst the mourning of death, from the
hope of the life to come. I readily acknowledge that they sinned in not
immediately raising their minds to that prediction which they had heard
from the lips of their Master, when he foretold that he would rise again
on the third day.  <span id="fr_300"></span>[301](#fn_300.md) But as they
retain the general principle of the final resurrection, that defect is
forgiven, which would justly have vitiated, as the phrase is, the whole
of the action. Thus God frequently accepts, with fatherly kindness, the
works of the saints, which, without pardon, not only would not have
pleased him, but would even have been justly rejected with shame and
punishment. It is, therefore, an astonishing display of the goodness of
Christ, that he kindly and generously presents himself alive to the
women, who did him wrong in seeking him among the dead. Now if he did
not permit them to come in vain to his grave, we may conclude with
certainty, that those who now aspire to him by faith will not be
disappointed; for the distance of places does not prevent believers from
enjoying him who fills heaven and earth by the power of his Spirit.

<span id="ii.xlv-p18"></span><span id="ii.xlv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlv-p19"></span>**<span id="ii.xlv-p19.2"></span>[Mark
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#001.md)<span id="ii.xlv-p19.2"></span>.**
*And when the Sabbath was past.* The meaning is the same as in Matthew,
*In the evening, which began to dawn towards the first day of the
Sabbaths,* and in Luke, on *the first day of the Sabbaths.* For while we
know that the Jews began to reckon their day from the commencement of
the preceding night, everybody understands, that when the Sabbath was
past, the women resolved among themselves to visit the sepulcher, so as
to come there before the dawn of day. The two Evangelists give the name
of *the first day of the Sabbaths,* to that which came first in order
between two Sabbaths. Some of the Latin translators  <span
id="fr_301"></span>[302](#fn_301.md) have rendered it *one,* and many have
been led into this blunder through ignorance of the Hebrew language; for
though (<span id="ii.xlv-p20.2"></span>אחד) sometimes means *one,* and
sometimes *first,* the Evangelists, as in many other passages, have
followed the Hebrew idiom, and used the word <span
id="ii.xlv-p20.3"></span>μίαν, *one.*  <span
id="fr_302"></span>[303](#fn_302.md) But that no one may be led astray by
the ambiguity, I have stated their meaning more clearly. As to *the
purchase of the spices,* Luke’s narrative differs, in some respects,
from the words of Mark; for Luke says that they *returned* into the
city, and *procured spices, and then rested* one day, *according to the
commandment of the law* before pursuing their journey. But Mark, in
introducing into the same part of the narrative two different events,
at—tends less accurately than Luke to the distinction of dates; for he
blends with their setting out on the journey what had been previously
done. In the substance of the fact they perfectly agree, that the women,
after having observed the holy rest, left home during the darkness of
the night, that they might reach the sepulcher about the break of day.

<span id="ii.xlv-p22"></span>We ought also to recollect what I have
formerly suggested, that the custom of anointing the dead, though it was
common, among many heathen nations, was applied to a lawful use by the
Jews alone, to whom it had been handed down by the Fathers, to confirm
them in the faith of the resurrection. For without having this object in
view, to embalm a dead body, which has no feeling, would be an idle and
empty solace, as we know that the Egyptians bestowed great labor and
anxiety on this point, without looking for any advantage. But by this
sacred symbol, God represented to the Jews the image of life in death,
to lead them to expect that out of putrefaction and dust they would one
day acquire new vigor. Now as the resurrection of Christ, by its
quickening vigor, penetrated every sepulcher, so as to breathe life into
the dead, so it abolished those outward ceremonies. For himself, he
needed not those aids, but they were owing to the ignorance of the
women, who were not yet fully aware that he was free from corruption.

<span id="ii.xlv-p23"></span><span id="ii.xlv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlv-p24"></span>**3.** *And they said among themselves.*
Mark alone expresses this doubt; but as the other Evangelists relate
that *the stone was rolled away by the angel,* it may easily be
inferred, that they remained in perplexity and doubt as to what they
should do, until the entrance was opened up by the hand of God. But let
us learn from this, that in consequence of having been carried away by
their zeal, they came there without due consideration. They had seen *a
stone* placed before the sepulcher, to hinder any one from entering. Why
did not this occur to them, when they were at home and at leisure, but
because they were seized with such fear and astonishment, that thought
and recollection failed them? But as it is a holy zeal that blinds them,
God does not charge them with this fault.

<span id="ii.xlv-p25"></span><span id="ii.xlv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlv-p26"></span>**<span id="ii.xlv-p26.2"></span>[Matthew
28:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#002.md)<span id="ii.xlv-p26.2"></span>.**
*And, lo, a great earthquake.* By many signs the Lord showed the
presence of his glory, that he might more fully prepare the hearts of
the holy women to reverence the mystery.  <span
id="fr_303"></span>[304](#fn_303.md) For since it was not a matter of
little consequence to know that the Son of God had obtained a victory
over death, (on which the principal point of our salvation is founded,)
it was necessary to remove all doubts, that the divine majesty might be
openly and manifestly presented to the eyes of the women. Matthew says,
therefore, that *there was an earthquake,* by which the divine power
which I have mentioned might be perceived. And by this prodigy, it was
proper that the women should be allowed to expect nothing human or
earthly, but to raise their minds to a work of God which was new, and
surpassed the expectations of men.

<span id="ii.xlv-p28"></span>The *raiment* and *the countenance* of the
angel, too, might be said to be rays by which the splendor of Godhead
was diffused, so as to enable them to perceive that it was not a mortal
man that stood near them, having the face of a man. For though *dazzling
light,* or *the whiteness of snow,* is nothing in comparison of the
boundless glory of God, but rather, if we wish to know him aright, we
ought not to imagine to ourselves any color; yet when he makes known by
outward signs that he is present, he invites us to him, as far as our
weakness can endure. Still we ought to know that the visible signs of
his presence are exhibited to us, that our minds may conceive of him as
invisible; and that, under bodily forms, we obtain a taste of his
spiritual essence, that we may seek him spiritually. Yet it cannot be
doubted that, together with outward signs, there was an inward power,
which engraved on the hearts of the women an impression of Deity. For
though at first they were struck with amazement, yet it will appear,
from what follows, that they gathered courage, and were gradually
instructed in such a manner, that they perceived the hand of God to be
present.

<span id="ii.xlv-p29"></span>Our three Evangelists, from a desire of
brevity, leave out what is more fully related by John, (<span
id="ii.xlv-p29.1"></span>[Joh
20:1-12](../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.xlv-p29.1"></span>) which, we know, is not unusual with them.
There is also this difference, that Matthew and Mark mention but *one
angel,* while John and Luke speak of *two.* But this apparent
contradiction also is easily removed; for we know how frequently in
Scripture instances occur of that figure of speech by which a part is
taken for the whole. There were *two angels,* therefore, who appeared
first to Mary, and afterwards to her other companions; but as the
attention of the women was chiefly directed to the angel who spoke,
Matthew and Mark have satisfied themselves with relating his message.
Besides, when Matthew says that *the angel sat on a stone,* there is in
his words (<span id="ii.xlv-p29.2"></span>ὕστερον πρότερον), *an
inversion of the order of events;* or, at least, that order was
disregarded by him; for *the angel* did not immediately appear, but
while the women were held in suspense and anxiety by an event so strange
and astonishing.

<span id="ii.xlv-p30"></span><span id="ii.xlv-p30.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlv-p31"></span>**4.** *Through fear the guards trembled.*
The Lord struck *the guards* with *terror,* as if he had engraved their
consciences with a hot iron, so as to constrain them reluctantly to feel
his divine power. The *terror* had, at least, the effect of hindering
them from treating with careless mockery the report of the resurrection
which was to be spread abroad shortly afterwards. For though they were
not ashamed of prostituting their tongues for him, still they were
compelled, whether they would or not, to acknowledge inwardly what they
wickedly denied before men. Nor can it be doubted that, when they were
at liberty to talk freely among their acquaintances, they frankly
admitted what they dare not openly avow, in consequence of having been
gained over by money.

<span id="ii.xlv-p32"></span>We must attend to the distinction between
the two kinds of *terror,* between which Matthew draws a comparison. The
soldiers, who were accustomed to tumults, were terrified, and were so
completely overwhelmed by alarm, that they fell down like men who were
almost dead; but no power was exerted to raise them from that condition.
A similar terror seized the women; but their minds, which had nearly
given way, were restored by the consolation which immediately followed,
so as to begin, at least, to entertain some better hope. And, certainly,
it is proper that the majesty of God should strike both terror and fear
indiscriminately into the godly, as well as the reprobate, that all
flesh may be silent before his face. But when the Lord has humbled and
subdued his elect, he immediately mitigates their dread, that they may
not sink under its oppressive influence; and not only so, but by the
sweetness of his grace heals the wound which he had inflicted. The
reprobate, on the other hand, he either overwhelms by sudden dread, or
suffers to languish in slow torments. As to the soldiers themselves,
they were, no doubt, *like dead* men, but without any serious
impression. Like men in a state of insensibility, they tremble, indeed,
for a moment, but presently forget that they were afraid; not that the
remembrance of their terror was wholly obliterated, but because that
lively and powerful apprehension of the power of God, to which they were
compelled to yield, soon passed away from them. But we ought chiefly to
attend to this point, that though they, as well as the women, were
afraid, no medicine was applied to soothe their terror; for to the women
only did the angel say, *Fear not.* He held out to them a ground of joy
and assurance in the resurrection of Christ. Luke adds a reproof, *Why
do you seek the living among the dead?* as if the angel pulled their
ear, that they might no longer remain in sluggishness and despair.

<span id="ii.xlv-p33"></span><span id="ii.xlv-p33.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlv-p34"></span>**7.** *And go quickly, and tell his
disciples.* Here God, by the angel, confers extraordinary honor on the
women, by enjoining them to proclaim to the apostles themselves the
chief point of our salvation. In Mark’s account of it, they are
expressly enjoined to carry this message to *Peter;* not because he was
at that time higher in rank than the others, but because his crime,
which was so disgraceful, needed peculiar consolation to assure him that
Christ had not cast him off, though he had basely and wickedly fallen.
He had already entered into the sepulcher, and beheld the traces of the
resurrection of Christ; but God denied him the honor, which he shortly
afterwards conferred on the women, of hearing from the lips of the angel
that Christ *was risen.* And, indeed, the great insensibility under
which he still labored is evident from the fact that he again fled
trembling to conceal himself, as if he had seen nothing, while Mary sat
down to weep at the grave. It cannot be doubted, therefore, that she and
her companions, in beholding the angel, obtained the reward of their
patience.

<span id="ii.xlv-p35"></span>*And, lo, He goeth before you into
Galilee.* When the angel sent the disciples *into Galilee,* he did so, I
think, in order that Christ might make himself known to a great number
of persons; for we know that he had lived a long time *in Galilee.* He
intended also to give his followers greater liberty, that by the very
circumstance of their retirement they might gradually acquire courage.
Besides, by being accustomed to the places, they were aided in
recognizing their Master with greater certainty; for it was proper to
adopt every method of confirming them, that nothing might be wanting to
complete the certainty of their faith.

<span id="ii.xlv-p36"></span>*Lo, I have told you.* By this manner of
speaking the angel earnestly assures them that what is said is true. He
states this, not as from himself, as if he had been the first to suggest
it, but gives his signature to the promise of Christ; and, therefore, in
Mark’s account of it, he merely recalls to their remembrance the very
words of Christ. Luke carries out the address still farther, by saying
that the disciples were informed by Christ *that he must be crucified,
and rise again on the third day.* But the meaning is the same; for along
with his resurrection he had foretold his death. He then adds, —

<span id="ii.xlv-p37"></span><span id="ii.xlv-p37.1"></span>

<span id="ii.xlv-p38"></span>**<span id="ii.xlv-p38.2"></span>[Luke
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#008.md)<span id="ii.xlv-p38.2"></span>.**
*And they remembered his words;* by which we are taught that, though
they had made little proficiency in the doctrine of Christ, still it was
not lost, but was choked up, until in due time it yielded fruit.
