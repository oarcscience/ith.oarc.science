<span id="ii.xiv-p4"></span>**41. **And while Jesus was sitting opposite
to the treasury, he perceived how the multitude threw money into the
treasury, and many rich persons put in much. **42. **And a poor widow
came, and threw in two mites, which make a farthing. **43. **And having
called his disciples to him, he said, Verily I say to you, that this
poor widow hath thrown in more than all who have thrown into the
treasury: **44. **For they all have thrown in out of their abundance;
but she out of her poverty hath thrown in all that she had, all her
living.  <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md)

<span id="ii.xiv-p6"></span>**1. **And, lifting up his eyes, he saw
those rich men who were throwing their gifts into the treasury.
**2. **And he saw also a certain poor widow throwing into it two mites.
**3. **And he said, Verily I say to you, that this poor widow hath
thrown in more than all: **4. **For all these, out of their abundance,
have thrown into the offering of God; but she out of her poverty hath
thrown in all the living which she had.  <span

<span id="ii.xiv-p10"></span>**<span id="ii.xiv-p10.2"></span>[Mark
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#043.md)<span
id="ii.xiv-p10.2"></span>.** *Verily I say to you.* This reply of Christ
contains a highly useful doctrine that whatever men offer to God ought
to be estimated not by its apparent value,  <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) but only by the feeling of the heart,
and that the holy affection of him who according to his small means,
offers to God the little that he has, is more worthy of esteem than that
of him who offers a hundred times more *out of his abundance.* In two
ways this doctrine is useful, for the poor who appear not to have the
power of doing good, are encouraged by our Lord not to hesitate to
express their affection cheerfully out of their slender means; for if
they consecrate themselves, their offering, which appears to be mean and
worthless, will not be less valuable than if they had presented all the
treasures of Crœsus.  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) On the
other hand, those who possess greater abundance, and who have received
from God larger communications, are reminded that it is not enough if in
the amount of their beneficence they greatly surpass the poor and common
people; because it is of less value in the sight of God that a rich man,
out of a vast heap, should bestow a moderate sum, than that a poor man,
by giving very little, should exhaust his store. *This widow* must have
been a person of no ordinary piety, who, rather than come empty into the
presence of God, chose to part with *her own living.* And our Lord
applauds this sincerity, because, forgetting herself, she wished to
testify that she and all that she possessed belonged to God. In like
manner, the chief sacrifice which God requires from us is self-denial.
As to the *sacred offerings,* it is probable that they were not at that
time applied properly, or to lawful purposes; but as the service of the
Law was still in force, Christ does not reject them. And certainly the
abuses of men could not prevent the sincere worshippers of God from
doing what was holy, and in accordance with the command of God, when
they offered for sacrifices and other pious uses.
