<span id="iii.v.ii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.ii-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.v.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.ii-p2"></span>**1.** How is the gold become dim! *how*
is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured
out in the top of every street.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p3"></span>**1.** Quomodo obscuratum est aurum!
Mutatum est aurum bonum! Effusi sunt (*vel,* projecti) lapides
sanctuarii in capite omnium platearum.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.ii-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.ii-p6"></span>Here Jeremiah, following the order of the
alphabet the fourth time,  <span id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md)
deplores the ruin of the city, and the destruction of the priesthood and
of the kingdom. For they are mistaken who think that the death of Josiah
is here lamented; for there are here many things, which we shall see as
we proceed, which do not suit that event. There is no doubt but that
this mournful song refers to the destruction of the Temple and city; but
when Josiah was killed, the enemy had not come to the city, and the
stones of the Temple were not then east forth into the streets and the
public roads. There are also other things which we shall see, which did
not then happen. It follows then that here is described the terrible
vengeance of God, which we have had already to consider.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p8"></span>He begins by expressing his astonishment,
*How obscured is the gold! and the precious gold! for* <span
id="iii.v.ii-p8.1"></span>כתם, *catam,* is properly the best gold,
though the word *good*,<span id="iii.v.ii-p8.2"></span>הטוב *ethub*, is
added to it. We may hence conclude that it generally denotes gold only.
He mentions, then, gold twice, but they are two different words in
Hebrew, <span id="iii.v.ii-p8.3"></span>זהב, *zaeb,* and <span
id="iii.v.ii-p8.4"></span>כתם *catam.*  <span
id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) Now he speaks figuratively in the
former part of the verse; but there is no doubt but that by the gold,
and the finest gold, as it is rendered, he means the splendor of the
Temple; for God had designed the Temple to be built, as it is well
known, in a very magnificent manner. Hence he calls what was ornamental
in the Temple gold.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p12"></span>He then speaks without a figure, and
says, that the *stones were thrown* here and there in all directions.
Some, indeed, think that these words refer to the sacred vessels, of
which there was a large quantity, we know, in the Temple. But this
opinion is not probable, for the Prophet does not complain that the gold
was taken away, but that it was obscured, and changed. It is then, no
doubt, a metaphorical expression. But he afterwards explains himself
when he says that *the stones of the sanctuary were cast forth* here and
there along all the streets. It was indeed a sad spectacle; for God had
consecrated that temple to himself, that he might dwell in it. When
therefore the stones of the sanctuary were thus disgracefully scattered,
it must have grievously wounded the minds of all the godly; for they saw
that God’s name was thus exposed to reproaches. Nor is there a doubt but
that the Chaldeans vomited forth many reproaches against God when they
thus scattered the stones of the temple. It hence appears, that the
Prophet did not without reason exclaim, How has this happened! for such
a sight must have justly astonished all the godly, seeing as they did
the degradation of the temple connected with a reproach to God himself.
It follows, —

<span id="iii.v.iii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.iii-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#002.md)<span id="iii.v.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iii-p2"></span>**2.** The precious sons of Zion,
comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the
work of the hands of the potter!

<span id="iii.v.iii-p3"></span>**2.** Filii Sion pretiosi (*alii
vertunt*, inclytos) comparatiauro (*alii vertunt*, amicti auro, *quod
mihi magis placet*,) quomodo reputati sunt in lagenas testaceas (testae,
ad *verbum*) opus manuum figuli?

<span id="iii.v.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.iii-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iii-p6"></span>The Prophet comes now to the people,
though he does not include the whole people, but brings forward those
who were renowned, and excelled in honor and dignity. He then says, that
they were become like *earthen vessels* and the *work of the potter’s
hands,* which is very fitly added. Then by the *sons of Sion,* whom he
calls *precious* or glorious, he means the chief men and the king’s
counselors and those who were most eminent. And he seems to allude to
that prophecy which we before explained’ for he had said that the people
were like earthen vessels; and he went into the house of the potter,
that he might see what was made there. When the potter made a vessel
which did not please him, he remodeled it, and then it assumed another
form; then God declared that the people were in his hand and at his
will, as the clay was in the hand of the potter. (<span
id="iii.v.iii-p6.1"></span>[Jer. 18:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer018.htm#002.md),
[Jer. 19:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer019.htm#011.md)<span
id="iii.v.iii-p6.1"></span>.) When he now says, that the chief men were
stripped of all dignity, and reduced to another form, so as to become
like earthen vessels, he no doubt sets forth by this change the judgment
of God, which the Jews had for a time disregarded.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p7"></span>And we must bear in mind the Prophet’s
object: he described the ruin of the Temple and city, that he might
remind the people of the punishment which had at length been inflicted;
for we know that the people had not only been deaf, but had also scoffed
at and derided all prophecies and threatenings. As, then, they had not
believed the doctrine of Jeremiah, he now shews that what he had
predicted was really fulfilled, and that the people were finding to
their cost that God did not trifle with them when he had so often
threatened what at length happened. And hence we may conclude, that
there was then a superfluous splendor in garments, for we read that they
had been clad or clothed in gold; surely it was a display too sumptuous.
There is, however, no wonder, for we know that Orientals are far too
much given to such trumperies.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p8"></span>Now, if the other reading, that the *sons
of Sion had been before compared to gold,*  <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) be more approved, the passage must be
extended to all their dignity and to all those gifts by which they had
been favored and had become illustrious. I have already reminded you,
that the *work of the potter’s hands* is here to be taken for the
vessels or the earthen flagons; but it was the Prophet’s object to
enlarge on that reproach, which \]lad been before incredible. It follows
—

<span id="iii.v.iv"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.iv-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#003.md)<span id="iii.v.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv-p2"></span>**3.** Even the sea-monsters draw out the
breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people
*is become* cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.

<span id="iii.v.iv-p3"></span>**3.** Etiam serpentes educunt mammam,
lactant catulos suos; filia populi mei ad crudelem tanquam ululm (*vel*,
struthiones) in deserto.

<span id="iii.v.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.iv-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv-p6"></span>This verse is harshly explained by many,
for they think that the daughter of the people is called cruel, because
she acted towards her children as serpents do to their young ones. But
this meaning is not suitable, for the word <span
id="iii.v.iv-p6.1"></span>בת, *beth,* is well known to be feminine. He
says that the daughter of the people had come to a savage or cruel one,
the latter word is masculine. Then the Prophet seems to mean that the
whelps (such is the word) of serpents are more kindly dealt with than
the Jews. Serpents are void of all humanity, yet they nourish their
brood and give them the breast,. Hence the Prophet by this comparison
amplifies the miseries of the people, that their condition was worse
than that of serpents, for the tender brood are nourished by their
mothers; but the people were without any help, so that they in vain
implored the protection of their mother and of others. ‘We now see the
real meaning of the Prophet.

<span id="iii.v.iv-p7"></span>The particle <span
id="iii.v.iv-p7.1"></span>גם, *gam*, is emphatical; for had he spoken of
animals, such as are careful to nourish their young, it would not have
been so wonderful; but so great seems to be the savageness and barbarity
of serpents, that they might be expected to east away their brood. Now
he says that *even serpents draw out the breast* The Jews say that the
breasts of serpents are covered with scales, as though they were hidden;
but this is one of their figments. It is a common phrase, taken from t
common practice; for a woman draws out the breast when she gives suck to
her infant; so serpents are said to draw out the breast when they give
suck to their whelps; for <span id="iii.v.iv-p7.2"></span>גורים,
*gurim*, are the whelps of lions or of bears; but in this place the word
is applied to serpents. *The daughter,* then, *of my people has come to
the cruel one,* for the people had to do with nothing but cruelty, there
being no one to bring them help or to succor them in their miseries. He,
then, does not accuse the people of cruelty, that they did not nourish
their children, but on the contrary he means that they were given up to
cruel enemies.  <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md)

<span id="iii.v.iv-p11"></span>*As the ostriches,* or the owls, he says,
in the wilderness. If we understand the ostrich to be intended, we know
that bird to be very stupid; for as soon as she lays an egg, she forgets
and leaves it. The comparison, then, would be suitable, were the
daughter of the people said to be cruel, because she neglected her
children; but the Prophet, as I think, means, on the contrary, that the
Jews were so destitute of every help, as though they were banished into
solitary places beyond the sight of men; for birds in solitude in vain
seek the help of others. As, then, the ostrich Or the owl has in the
desert no one to bring it help, and is without its own mother, so the
Prophet intimates that there was no one to stretch forth a hand to the
distressed people to relieve their extreme miseries. It follows, —

<span id="iii.v.v"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.v-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#004.md)<span id="iii.v.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p2"></span>**4.** The tongue of the sucking child
cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask
bread, *and* no man breaketh *it* unto them.

<span id="iii.v.v-p3"></span>**4.** Adhaesit lingua lactantis ad palatum
ejus in siti; parvuli petierunt panem, dividens nemo illis (*hoc est*,
nemo est qui illis dividat, *id est*, porrigat.)

<span id="iii.v.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.v-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p6"></span>He says that sucking children were so
thirsty, that the tongue was as it were fixed to the palate; and it was
a dreadful thing; for mothers would willingly pour forth their own blood
to feed their infants. When, therefore, the tongue of a child clave to
his mouth, it seemed to be in a manner beyond nature. Among other
calamities, then, the Prophet names this, that *infants pined away with
thirst,* and also that *children sought bread* in vain. He speaks not in
the latter instance of sucklings, but. of children three or four years
old. Then he says that they *sought* or asked for bread, but that there
was no one to give.  <span id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md)

<span id="iii.v.v-p10"></span>He describes here the famine of the city,
of which he had predicted, when he declared that it would be better with
the slain than with the people remaining alive, for a harder conflict
with famine and want would await the living. But this was not believed.
Now, then, the Prophet upbraids the Jews with their former perverseness.
He afterwards adds, —

<span id="iii.v.vi"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vi-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.vi-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#005.md)<span id="iii.v.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vi-p2"></span>**5.** They that did feed delicately are
desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace
dunghills.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p3"></span>**5.** Qui comedebant ad delicias (hoc
est, in deliciis, *ad verbum*, <span id="iii.v.vi-p3.1"></span>למעדנים,)
perierunt in plateis; qui educati fuerant in coccino (ad coccinum,)
amplexi sunt stercora.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.vi-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vi-p6"></span>Here he goes on farther, and says, that
they had perished with famine who had been accustomed to the most
delicate food. He had said generally that infants found nothing in their
mothers’ breasts, but pined away with thirst, and also that children
died through want of bread. But he now amplifies this calamity by
saying, that this not only happened to the children of the common
people, but also to those who had been brought up delicately, and had
been clothed in scarlet and purple.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p7"></span>Then he says that *they perished in the
streets,* and also that they *embraced the dunghills,* because they had
no place to lie down, or because they sought food, as famished men do,
on dunghills.  <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md) It seems to be a
hyperbolical expression; but if we consider what the Prophet has already
narrated and will again repeat, it ought not to appear incredible, that
those who had been accustomed to delicacies embraced dunghills; for
mothers cooked their own children and devoured them as beef or mutton.
There is no doubt but that the siege, of which we have before read,
drove the people to acts too degrading to be spoken of, especially when
they had become blinded through so great a pertinacity, and had
altogether hardened themselves in their madness against God. It follows,
—

<span id="iii.v.vii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#006.md)<span id="iii.v.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p2"></span>**6.** For the punishment of the iniquity
of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin
of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on
her.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p3"></span>**6.** Et major fuit poena filiae populi
mei poena Sodomae (*ad verbum est*, iniquitas filiae populi mei peccato
*vel* scelere Sodomae; *sed statim, dicam cur de poena exponam potius
quam de ipso scelere*,) quae eversa fuit tanquam momento; non manserunt
in ea plagae (*alii vertunt*, et non castrametatae sunt manus; *sed
postea etiam dicam cur mihi magis placeat illa versio*.)

<span id="iii.v.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.vii-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p6"></span>The Prophet says first,, that the
punishment of his people was heavier than that of Sodom. If any one
prefers the other version, I will not contend, for it is not unsuitable;
and hence also a most useful doctrine may be drawn, that we are to judge
of the grievousness of our sins by the greatness of our punishment for
God never exceeds what is just when he takes vengeance on the sins of
men. Then his severity shews how grievously men have sinned. Thus,
Jeremiah may have reasoned from the effect to the cause, and declared
that the people had been more wicked than the Sodomitites. Nor is this
unreasonable; for if the Jews had not fallen into that great wickedness
of which the Sodomites were guilty, yet the Prophets everywhere charged
them as men who not only equaled but also surpassed the Sodomites,
especially Ezekiel, (<span id="iii.v.vii-p6.1"></span>[Ezek.
16:46](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#046.md),
[47](../../../bib/kjv/eze016.htm#047)<span id="iii.v.vii-p6.1"></span>..md)
Isaiah also called them the people of Gomorrha, and the king’s
counselors and judges, the princes of Sodom, (<span
id="iii.v.vii-p6.2"></span>[Isa. 1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#010)<span id="iii.v.vii-p6.2"></span>..md)
This mode of speaking is then common in the Prophets, and the meaning is
not unsuitable.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p7"></span>But as he dwells only on the grievousness
of their punishment, the other explanation seems more simple; for I
regard not what is plausible, but accept the true meaning. Let us then
repeat the Prophet’s words: *greater is the punishment of my people,*
etc. The word <span id="iii.v.vii-p7.1"></span>עון, *oun*, means
punishment as well as iniquity; this is certain, beyond dispute. Now
<span id="iii.v.vii-p7.2"></span>חטאת, *chethat*, means also both sin
and punishment. It is hence applied to expiations; the sacrifice for sin
is called <span id="iii.v.vii-p7.3"></span>חטאת, *chethat*. As to the
words, then, they designate punishment as well as sin, the cause of it.
But the reason which follows leads me to consider punishment as
intended, for he says that *Sodom was overthrown* as in a moment. Here,
doubtless, we see that the sins of the Jews are not compared to the sins
of the Sodomites, but their destruction only: God had overthrown Sodom,
as afterwards he overthrew Jerusalem; but the ruin of Sodom was milder,
for it perished in a moment — for when God had dreadfully thundered, the
Sodomites and their neighboring citizens were immediately destroyed; and
we know that the shorter the punishment, the more tolerable it is. As
the Prophet here compares the momentary destruction of Sodom with the
prolonged ruin of the city and slaughter of the people, we see that what
is spoken of is not sin, but on the contrary God’s judgment.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p8"></span>There is yet no doubt but that the
Prophet summoned the Jews to God’s tribunal, that they might know that
they deserved such a vengeance, and that they might perceive that they
were worse than the Sodomites. For it was not the Prophet’s object to
expostulate with God, or to charge him with having been too rigid in
destroying the city of Jerusalem. As, then, the Prophet does not charge
God either with injustice or with cruelty, it is certain that punishment
is what is here set forth, in order that the people might know what they
deserved.  <span id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md)

<span id="iii.v.vii-p10"></span>But the words declare nothing more than
that God’s vengeance had been severer towards the Jews than towards the
Sodomites. How so? it is evident from this reason, *because Sodom was
consumed as in a moment;* and then it is added, *and strokes remained
not on her*. The word <span id="iii.v.vii-p10.1"></span>יד, *id*, as it
is well known, means hand, a place, but sometimes, metaphorically, a
stroke. Interpreters vary here, but I shall not recite the opinions of
all, nor is it needful. Those who seem to come nearest to the words of
the Prophet, render them thus, “and hands (or forces) have not encamped
against her.” But this is a forced and far-fetched meaning. It would run
better, “have not remained.” The verb <span
id="iii.v.vii-p10.2"></span>חול *chul*, means sometimes to encamp and
sometimes to remain, to settle. Then the most appropriate meaning would
be*, that strokes settled not on the Sodomites,* while the Jews pined
away in their manifold evils.  <span id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md)
For they did not immediately perish like the Sodomitites; but when God
saw them so obstinate in their wickedness, he destroyed some by famine,
some by pestilence, and some by the sword; and then the city was not
immediately demolished altogether, as it often happens when enemies make
a slaughter and kill men, women, and children; but this people were not
so destroyed. Many of them were driven into exile, and some of the
common people were left to inhabit the ruined cities, for there was
dreadful desolation. The king himself, as it has before appeared, was
removed to Babylon, but his eyes had previously been pulled out, and his
children slain in his presence.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p14"></span>We hence see that the destruction of the
city was like a slow consumption: and that thus strokes remained there
as it were fixed, which did not happen to Sodom; for Sodom suddenly
perished when God thundered against it; but the hand of God did not
depart from the Jews, and the strokes or smitings, as I have said, were
fixed on them and continued. It follows, —

<span id="iii.v.viii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.viii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.viii-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.viii-p2"></span>**7.** Her Nazarites were purer than
snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than
rubies, their polishing *was* of sapphire:

<span id="iii.v.viii-p3"></span>**7.** Candidiores Nazaraei ejus nive,
(*vel*, puriores,) candidiores laete, rubicundi fuerunt corpore suo
(*neque enim hoc potest accipi de ossibus*) supra lapillos preciosos,
sapphirus excisio ipsorum:

<span id="iii.v.viii-p4"></span>**8.** Their visage is blacker than a
coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their
bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p5"></span>**8.** Obtenebrata est prae caligine
forma ipsorum, non agniti in plateis; adhaesit cutis eorum ossi ipsorum,
(*hoc est*, ossibus;) exaruit, fuit tanquam lignum.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p6"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.viii-p7"></span><span id="iii.v.viii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.viii-p8"></span>Here the Prophet speaks of Nazarites, by
whom we know the worship of God was honored; for they, who were not
content with the common observance of the Law, consecrated themselves to
God, that by their example they might stimulate others. It was then a
singular zeal in a few to consecrate themselves, so as to become
Nazarites, or separated. What this custom was may be known from the
sixth chapter of Numbers. For God, who has always repudiated all
fictitious forms of worship, prescribed to the Nazarites what he
approved in every particular. Hence Moses carefully men-honed all those
things which were to be observed by the Nazarites.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p9"></span>As to the present passage, it is enough
to say, that the Nazarites were peculiarly devoted to God’s service
during the time of their separation, for it was only a temporary
service.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p10"></span>Then the Prophet brings them forward,
that it might hence be evident how sad was the change, which he never
could have made the Jews to believe. He says that the Nazarites were
purer than snow, and whiter that milk, and also ruddier than precious
stones, so that they might be corn-pared to sapphire; for, by saying
sapphire was their cutting, he means that they were like sapphires well
polished. Now we know that the Nazarites abstained from wine and strong
drink: hence abstinence might have lessened somewhat of their ruddiness.
For he who is accustomed to drink wine, if he abstains for a time, is
apt to grow pale; lie will then lose almost all his color, at least he
will not be so ruddy; nor will there appear in his face and in his
members so much rigor as when he took his ordinary support. Jeremiah, in
short, teaches us flint the blessing of God was conspicuous in the
Nazarites, for he wonderfully supported them while they were for a time
abstinence.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p11"></span><span id="iii.v.viii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.viii-p12"></span>Now, on the contrary, he says that the
*Nazarites were become withered, that their skin clave to their bones,*
that, in short, they were so deformed that they could not be known, not
only in obscure corners, but even in the open street, hi the middle of
the market-place. We hence learn that as the favor of God had before
appeared as to the Nazarites, so now also his vengeance might be
certainly known, because they had fallen off from their vigor, and were
reduced to a degrading deformity.  <span
id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md)

<span id="iii.v.viii-p20"></span>The Prophet at the same time shews that
worship according to the law had in a manner deteriorated on account of
the vices of the people; and this is the design of the whole, as I
reminded you at the beginning. For there is no doubt but that he wished
to rouse the Jews, that they might at length raise up their eyes to God;
for they had long grown torpid in their vices, and had been even
inflated with diabolical pride; hence was their inveterate obstinacy. As
long as the Temple stood, they thought that they satisfied God by the
sacrifices they offered. When the Prophet now tells them that the stones
of the Temple were thrown down, it hence follows that the Temple was
profaned’ whence this profanation? from the wickedness of the people.
The Chaldeans, indeed, thought that they brought a great reproach on God
when they demolished the Temple; but, as long pollution had preceded,
our Prophet now represents to the Jews their sins as in a mirror or a
living form; for they had polluted the Temple before the Chaldeans. So
also he shews that the worship according to the law was no longer
pleasing to God, for they had mocked him with empty specters; for it was
only a vain display when there was no integrity within. The Prophet then
shews to them what, he could before by no means have persuaded them to
believe, that God was in no way pleased with the external worship of the
Jews, while they were audaciously violating the whole law. It afterwards
follows, —

<span id="iii.v.ix-p2"></span>**9.** *They that be* slain with the sword
are better than *they that be* slain with hunger: for these pine away,
stricken through for *want of* the fruits of the field.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p3"></span>**9.** Meliores fuerunt occisi gladio quam
occisi fame; fluxerunt transrossi a fructibus agri.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.ix-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.ix-p6"></span>The beginning of the verse is without any
difficulty; for the Prophet says that it happened better to those who
immediately perished by the sword than to others who had to struggle
with famine, according to what he had lately said, that the punishment
of Sodom was more tolerable, because it was suddenly executed. Sudden
death is the easiest And the Prophet, when complaining that the ungodly
prospered, so that the faithful sometimes envied them, says that they
die as it were in a moment, and are taken away from the world; but he
says that the faithful are held, as it were, captive by the snares of
death, and protract life in perpetual languor. For this reason the
Prophet now says that the punishment of death would have been light to
the Jews. And yet we know that. a violent death is regarded by us with
horror. For he who dies on his bed is said to yield to his fate, as he
seems to pay what he owes to nature; but, he who is slain by the sword
is violently snatched away, and, as it were, contrary to nature. Violent
death, then, is always horrible. But the comparison used by the Prophet
amplifies the atrocity of their punishment, because it would have been
more desirable to have been killed at once than to remain alive to
struggle with famine.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p7"></span>And he expresses himself more clearly by
saying that *they pined away, having been pierced through by the fruits
of the earth* There is here some obscurity, but *by the fruits of the
earth,* we are no doubt to understand all kinds of food. Some consider
that “defect,” or failure, is to be understood. But the Prophet speaks
much more emphatically, even that all the productions of the earth took
vengeance on this wicked people, by refusing the usual supply. The earth
is the servant of God’s bounty and kindness; for it is the same as
though he with his hand extended food to us, when the earth opens its
bowels; so also the productions of the earth are evidences of God’s
paternal love towards us. Now, when the fruits of the earth withdraw
themselves from us, they are as it were the weapons to execute God’s
vengeance. So, then, the Prophet means that the Jews had been *pierced
through by the fruits of the earth, and thus had pined away;* as though
he had said, that they had not been pierced by the sword, but had been
wounded by famine, for the productions of the earth became, as it were,
swords, while yet they sustain, as we have said, the life of men.  <span

<span id="iii.v.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xii-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xii-p6"></span>Here Jeremiah refers to that disgraceful
and abominable deed mentioned yesterday; for it was not only a
barbarity, but a beastly savageness, when mothers boiled their own
children. That it was done is evident from other writers; but the
Prophet is to us a sufficient witness, who had seen it with his own
eyes. He then says that the mothers were merciful, that no one might
think that they were divested of every natural feeling; but he meant
thus to set forth the blindness which proceeds from God’s dreadful
vengeance. He does not, then, praise the mothers for their clemency, as
though they felt as they ought to have done for their offspring; but. he
intimates that though they would have been otherwise humane, they were
yet seized with unusual madness, so that they boiled their own children,
even their own bowels. We now, then, perceive the meaning of the word
*merciful,* as applied to the mothers by the Prophet. It is not then to
be deemed as a praise to them, as though they had a maternal love for
their children; but his object was to set forth that monstrous act,
which would not have sufficiently touched their minds, had he not
testified that the mothers of whom he speaks were not so brutal as not
to have gladly given food to their children; but that they were
supernaturally blinded by furious madness. It follows —

id="iii.v.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p2"></span>**11.** The LORD hath accomplished his
fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in
Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p3"></span>**11.** Complevit (*vel*, perfecit)
Jehova iracundiam suam, effudit excandescentiam irae suae et accendit
ignem in Sion, qui voravit fundamenta ejus.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p6"></span>He at length concludes that nothing was
wanting to complete the extreme vengeance of God; for had the Jews been
chastised in an ordinary way, they would have still extenuated their
sins, as we know that they were not easily led to repentance. Hence the
Prophet, to shew that their offenses had not been slight, but that they
had been extremely wicked before God, says that the whole of God’s wrath
had been executed: *Jehovah has completed his wrath* The expression is
indeed harsh to Latin ears; but the meaning is, that he had executed his
extreme judgment.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p7"></span>He afterwards adds, *He has poured forth
the indignation of his wrath*. God is indeed content with moderate
punishment, provided men be awakened from their torpor; but when he
pours forth his wrath, there is no hope of repentance. It is then a sign
of final despair when God’s vengeance overflows like a deluge. But when
Jeremiah thus speaks, he does not contend with God, but rather reminds
the Jews of what they deserved, as it was stated yesterday. There is,
then, no doubt but that he argues, from the grievousness of their
punishment, that there was no reason for the Jews to flatter themselves
any longer, since God had dealt so severely with them.

<span id="iii.v.xiii-p8"></span>He then, in other words, points out the
same thing, that God had *kindled a fire which devoured* or consumed
*the very foundations.* Fire is wont rather to take hold on the roofs of
houses, or, when it creeps farther, it does not proceed beyond the
surface. It is a very rare thing for it to penetrate into the
foundations. Let us at the same time know that the Prophet speaks
metaphorically of the destruction of the city, for it was such as left
nothing remaining. For when some ruins remain, there is some intimation
of a future restoration at least the minds of beholders are inclined to
hope that what has fallen is to be restored; but when the buildings are
not only pulled down, but also demolished from their foundations, then
the destruction seems to be without any hope of restoration. And this is
what the Prophet means when he says, that the *fire had consumed,* not
only what was above ground, but the *very foundations* of Jerusalem. It
follows, —

<span id="iii.v.xiv"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p1"></span><span

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p2"></span>**12.** The kings of the earth, and all
the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary
and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p3"></span>**12.** Non crediderunt (*vel*, non
credidissent) reges terrae, neque omnes incolae orbis, quod ingressus
esset adversarius et inimicus in portas Jerusalem.

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p6"></span>He confirms the same thing; for when a
thing incredible happens, either we are extremely stupid, or we must be
moved and affected. The Prophet, then, now says that the destruction of
the city of Jerusalem had been incredible, because God had defended it
by his power; it was also so fortified that no one believed that it
could be taken, and the grandeur of the city was known everywhere.

<span id="iii.v.xiv-p7"></span>He then says that Jerusalem had been
taken and overthrown, which no one of the heathens, neither their kings
nor their people, had thought possible. It then follows that the city
had been destroyed by God’s hand rather than by the power of enemies.
Nebuchadnezzar had indeed brought a strong army, but the city was so
well fortified that they thought that all attempts would be in vain.
That the city, then, was taken and demolished, could not have been
ascribed to human forces, but to a power hidden from the eyes of men. It
then follows that it was God’s work, and indeed singular. We now, then,
understand the design of the Prophet in saying that it was not believed
by kings nor people that enemies could storm Jerusalem. And in
continuation he adds, —

<span id="iii.v.xv"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xv-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.xv-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013.md)<span id="iii.v.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xv-p2"></span>**13.** For the sins of her prophets,
*and* the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the
just in the midst of her,

<span id="iii.v.xv-p3"></span>**13.** Propter peccatum prophetarum ejus,
iniquitatem sacerdotum ejus, qui fuderunt in medio ejus sanguinem
justorum.

<span id="iii.v.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xv-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xv-p6"></span>The Prophet, as in a matter fully proved,
rebukes the Jews, that he might, as it was necessary, bring down their
pride. Had he at first condemned the wickedness of the prophets and the
priests, no credit would have been given to his word. But after he had
set before them what we have observed, and especially after he had shewn
that the ruin of the city was a kind of prodigy, what he now adds must
have been certainly inferred, even that the Jews had in so many ways and
with such pertinacity provoked God, that it became necessary that they
should be wholly destroyed, as it happened.

<span id="iii.v.xv-p7"></span>But he points out here the sins by which
God’s wrath hart been kindled against. the people. He then says that the
fountain or the origin was ill the prophets and priests. Now, we have
elsewhere explained that the fault was not removed from the people when
the prophets and the priests were thus condemned. Indeed, the common
people readily exonerate themselves when they can plead ignorance, or
say that they have been deceived by their teachers and leaders. But when
Jeremiah imputes the chief part of the evils to the prophets and
priests, he does not, as I have said, devolve on them the fault of the
people, but intimates that their physicians had been as it were
impostors. For when the people corrupted themselves, the prophets were
sent for this end, to apply a remedy to their evils, and so also were
the priests; for we know that it was a duty enjoined on them to retain
the people in true religion and in the worship of God. In short,
Jeremiah shows that the people had been ruined, because corruption had
begun with the prophets and the priests; or, which is the same thing,
that die sins of the people had proved fatal, because their heads or
chiefs were diseased; *because*, he says, *of the sin of the prophets,
and the iniquity of the priests, etc.*

<span id="iii.v.xv-p8"></span>He mentions one kind of sins, that *they
shed the blood of the righteous in the midst of Jerusalem* They had no
doubt led the people astray in other things, for they flattered their
vices, and gave loose reins to licentiousness; but the Prophet here
fixed on one particular sin, the most grievous; for they had not only,
by their errors and false doctrines and flatteries, led away the people
from the fear of God, but had also obstinately defended their impiety,
and by force and cruelty repressed their faithful teachers, and put to
death the witnesses of God; for by the *righteous* or just he no doubt
means the prophets. For what Jerome and others say, that blood had been
shed because false teachers draw souls to perdition, is frivolous and
wholly foreign to what Jeremiah had in view; for the word righteous
cannot be applied to those miserable men who were ensnared to their own
ruin. Then Jeremiah, after having denounced the sin of the prophets and
the iniquity of the priests, mentions the savage cruelty, which was as
it were the summit of all their riches. Though, then, they had in
various ways provoked God, yet this was their extreme wickedness, that
they exercised so great a cruelty against God’s servants, that they
constrained as it were the Holy Spirit to be silent. For when the
despisers of God went so far as to give themselves up to shed innocent
blood, it was a proof of a diabolical obstinacy. We now, then,
understand what the Prophet had here in view.

<span id="iii.v.xv-p9"></span>Now this passage teaches us, that Satan
has from the beginning polluted the sanctuary of God by means even of
sacred names: for the prophetic office was honorable — so also was the
sacerdotal. God had established among his people the priesthood, which
was as it were a living image of Christ: there was then nothing more
excellent than the priesthood under the Law, if we regard the
institution of God. It was also a singular blessing that God promised
that his people should never be without prophets. As, then, prophets and
priests were two eyes as it were in the Church, the devil turned them to
every kind of profanation. This example then reminds us how much we
ought to watch, lest empty titles deceive us, which are nothing but
masks or specters. When we hear the name of Church and of pastors, we
ought reverently to regard the office as well as the order which has
proceeded from God, provided we are not content with naked titles, but
examine whether the reality also corresponds. Thus we see that the whole
world has for many ages degenerated from true religion; under what
pretext? even this, — that those who led astray miserable souls, boasted
that they were the vicars of Christ, the successors of the apostles, so
that they still arrogantly boast of these titles, and are inflated with
them. But we see what happened in the time of Jeremiah.

<span id="iii.v.xv-p10"></span>We have had before similar passages; but
this ought to be carefully noticed, for it says, that prophets and
priests had destroyed the very Church of God. It was, indeed, a very
grievous trial, and therefore a powerful instrument, as it were, for
subverting the faith of the simple, when they saw that the very prophets
and priests were the cause of ruin; but it behooved the faithful
constantly to persevere in their obedience to the law. And we ought at
the same time to remember what I have said, that the Prophet enhances
the wickedness of the people, because the priests and the prophets
themselves had been infected with impiety and contempt of God, and not
only so, but they had exercised tyrannical cruelty towards the servants
of God. It follows, —

<span id="iii.v.xvi"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md)<span id="iii.v.xvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p2"></span>**14.** They have wandered *as* blind
*men* in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that
men could not touch their garments.

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p3"></span>**14.** Errarunt caeci (*subaudienda est
nota similitudinis*, sicut) in plateis, polluti sunt in sanguine, quia
non potuerunt quin contingerent vestes ipsorum (*ita lego, nec sine
ratione, quia alioe* *versiones nullo modo conveniunt, ut nun
videbimus*.)

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p6"></span>They who simply read, that the blind had
wandered, deduce this meaning, that the blind were polluted in the
streets, even because there was filth everywhere. They, indeed, come
near to the meaning of the Prophet, but they do not clearly explain what
he intended. I regard it therefore beyond dispute, that the people are
here compared to the blind, but it does not yet appear for what purpose.
But my opinion is this, that the whole city was so full of defilement’s,
that they could not avoid uncleanness; for a blind man would touch a
carcass, he would touch an unclean beast, he would touch a man infected
with some disease; how so? because he could not see to distinguish
between a dead and a living man, between the clean and unclean. Our
Prophet now compares the people to the blind, and why? because wherever
they went, uncleanness met them, so that their eyes were in a manner
dazzled by thick darkness. For when pestilence does not spread
everywhere, we can avoid an unclean place; but when there is no corner
where there is not a dead corpse or some sickness, we must pass on
anyhow, having no choice to make, — and why? because uncleanness
surrounds us everywhere. So, then, the Prophet says that the citizens of
Jerusalem were everywhere polluted, as though they were blind.

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p7"></span>Now follows the reason, which has not
been understood by interpreters, *They were polluted*, he says, *with
blood, because they could not but touch their garments.* They all give
this version, “They could not touch their garments,” and as there is
much obscurity and almost absurdity in this rendering, they say that the
meaning is that they were to avoid to touch their garments, because the
law forbade them to touch the unclean. But the Prophet meant another
thing. The words are literally thus, “They could not, they will touch
their garments, that is, they will inevitably touch their garments. But
the particle which I have mentioned is to be understood, and the passage
will read thus, *They could not but touch their garments;* and we know
that the language will bear this. And as this is consistent with the
subject which the Prophet handles, every one, judging rightly, will
readily receive what I have stated. The meaning then is, that they
*wandered as the blind, and were polluted in all the streets of the
city, because they could not escape uncleanness,* which met them
everywhere; that is, because the city, as I have said, was full of so
many pollutions, that they could not turn either here or there and avoid
uncleanness.  <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md)

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p15"></span>As to the words, *polluted with blood,*
they refer to the ceremonial law. There were indeed various kinds of
pollutions, but this was the chief. He accommodates his expressions to
his own age, and follows what was prescribed by the law. He, however,
alludes to the sins designated by blood. We, in short, see that the
whole of Jerusalem was so polluted with defilements, that no one could
go forth without falling on some uncleanness. A confirmation follows,
which also interpreters have not understood, —

<span id="iii.v.xvii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xvii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.xvii-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations

<span id="iii.v.xvii-p2"></span>**15.** They cried unto them, Depart ye;
*it is* unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and
wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn
*there*

<span id="iii.v.xvii-p3"></span>**15.** Discedite, pollutus, clamavit
illis; discedite, discedite, ne accedatis: quia evolarunt (*aut*,

Labitandum

<span id="iii.v.xvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xvii-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xvii-p6"></span>The Prophet confirms the former verse,
as I have said, even that no part of the city was free from filth,
because they cried everywhere, “Depart, depart — unclean!” That what is
said may be more evident to us, we must notice that the Prophet alludes
(which also has not been perceived) to <span
id="iii.v.xvii-p6.1"></span>[Le
13:45](../../../bib/kjv/lev013.htm#045.md)<span
id="iii.v.xvii-p6.1"></span>. For it is said there of the lepers, whose
disease was incurable, that they were to go with rent garments, with a
bare head, with covered lips, and cry, “Unclean, unclean, <span
id="iii.v.xvii-p6.2"></span>טמא טמא יקרא *thema, thema, ikora.* God,
then, would have the leprous to be driven from the assembly; and hence
came into use the exclamation, Unclean, unclean, <span
id="iii.v.xvii-p6.3"></span>טמא טמא, *thema, thema.* But here the
Prophet says, “Depart, depart — unclean <span
id="iii.v.xvii-p6.4"></span>סורו סורו טמא, *suru suru thema;* which is
substantially the same as commanded in the law. Now the Prophet speaks
metaphorically when he says, that the city was infected with
uncleanness, as though lepers were everywhere. We hence see how all
these things agree together, “They cried, Depart ye — unclean; depart
ye, depart;” that is, no one can move a foot from his house, or go forth
in public, but some uncleanness will appear to him, so that it might be
rightly exclaimed, *Unclean, depart ye, depart* The Prophet, after
having thus spoken, *Depart ye, come not nigh* says, *they have fled*.
It is a striking allusion to the exile of the people, as though he had
said, that they were driven afar off by their defilements. As then they
were removed to a distant land, he says that this happened through their
own fault; how so? because they could no longer endure these
defilement’s of their sins; they had so contaminated the holy city, that
it was foetid through their filth. As, then, the city Jerusalem was so
polluted, the citizens, he says, at length fled away: and thus exile
proceeded from themselves, that is, the cause of exile was their filth,
because they contaminated the city. *They have fled*, he says, *and have
also wandered*; that is, so great was their haste, that they kept not
the right way, but turned here and there, as they usually do who hasten
with trembling. For when any one travels, and his mind composed, he
attends to the road that he may not go astray; but he who trembles, or
is filled with fear, forgets the way, and wanders from the right course.
So, then, our Prophet now says, that the Jews *fled* and also
*wandered*; for he uses the particle <span
id="iii.v.xvii-p6.5"></span>גם, *gam*, also; they also wandered, he
says, even through that trepidation by which they were smitten.

<span id="iii.v.xvii-p7"></span>*They have said among the nations, They
shall not return to dwell;* that is, they are scattered and driven among
various nations without hope of returning.

<span id="iii.v.xvii-p8"></span>We now see what the Prophet meant to
show, even that the Jews had no reason to complain of their exile,
because they had so infected the holy city with their vices, that they
were hence driven by their own filth; this is one thing: and, then, that
so great was the mass of their evils, that they were seized with fear;
and thus they did not keep on the right way, but turned into devious
paths and met darkness; and, in the last place, he adds, as a
continuation of what he had said, that there was no hope of a return.

<span id="iii.v.xviii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xviii-p2"></span>**16.** The anger of the LORD hath
divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the
persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.

<span id="iii.v.xviii-p3"></span>**16.** Facies Jehovae divisit (*vel*,

<span id="iii.v.xviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xviii-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xviii-p6"></span>He explains himself by saying, that
they had been scattered from the face of Jehovah. He had said, that they
had fled into foreign lands, and that they believed their exile to be
perpetual; he now assigns the reason that God had thus banished them.
But he had promised by Moses, that though they were dispersed through
the four quarters of the world, he would yet be propitious to them, so
as to gather them when dispersed, as it is said in the Psalms, “He will
gather the dispersed of Israel.” (<span id="iii.v.xviii-p6.1"></span>[De
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#004.md)<span
id="iii.v.xviii-p6.1"></span>; <span id="iii.v.xviii-p6.2"></span>[Ps
147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.v.xviii-p6.2"></span>.) And we know that the time of exile had
been prefixed; for the Prophet had often testified that God would at
length become a deliverer to his people, so as to stretch forth again
his hand, and draw them forth from Chaldea as he did from Egypt: how
then does he say, that they had been scattered from the face of Jehovah,
and then, that they had been so rejected, that he would not favor them
hereafter with his paternal countenance? the obvious answer is this,
that the Prophet here regards only the extremely dispersed state of the
people. For though the promise of God as to their return was certain and
clear, yet, when any one cast his eyes on the state of things at that
time, he could have hoped no such thing; for the desolation, the ground
of despair, was immense: no name had remained for the people, the
priesthood had been extinguished, the royal dignity had been degraded,
the city also and the Temple had been completely overthrown. As, then,
there was nothing remaining as to the nation and the place, and also as
to God’s worship, how could they do otherwise than despond?

<span id="iii.v.xviii-p7"></span>Then the Prophet, viewing the
desolation, says, that nothing else could be concluded, but that the
Jews would be perpetually exiles, and that all the ways were closed up,
to prevent them to return to their country, and also that the eyes of
God were shut, so as never to look on them. We now, then, perceive what
he means by saying, that they were *scattered from the face of Jehovah*,
so that he should no longer look on them. And this mode of speaking is
often found in Scripture; for, on the one hand, it; sets before us the
wrath of God, which brings death; and then on the other, it sustains us,
or when we are fallen it raises us up, by setting before us the favor of
God even in death itself.

<span id="iii.v.xviii-p8"></span>The Prophet, then, considers now no
other thing than the dreadful calamity which was sufficient to sink the
minds of all into the lowest abyss of despair.

<span id="iii.v.xviii-p9"></span>He then adds, that they *respected not
the face of the priests, and shewed no pity to the elders.* Some think
that the reason is given why God had so severely punished the people,
even because they had despised the aged and the priests; but this is a
forced view. I, then, have no doubt but that the Prophet here intimates,
that the Jews had been treated reproachfully, so that there had been no
account made of the aged, and no respect shewn to the priests. It is,
indeed, true, that Daniel was held in great repute; but he speaks here
of the priests who had impiously despised all sound doctrine; and he
speaks of the aged who were in authority when the kingdom was yet
standing. He then says that they had been, as it were, trodden under
feet. He hence concludes, that, all hope of restoration was taken away
from the Jews, if they only considered their extreme calamity. He
afterwards adds, —

<span id="iii.v.xix-p2"></span>**17.** As for us, our eyes as yet failed

<span id="iii.v.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xix-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xix-p6"></span>Here the Prophet charges the people with
another crime, that neglecting God, and even despising his favor, they
had always attached themselves to vain and false hopes. And this was a
sacrilege not to be endured, because they thus robbed God of his rights:
and what does he demand more than that we should depend on him, and that
our minds should acquiesce in him alone? When, therefore, salvation is
expected from others rather than from God alone, he is, in a manner,
reduced to nothing. The Prophet, then, accuses the Jews of this great,
sacrilege, that they never betook themselves to God, nor had any hope in
him, but on the contrary wandered here and there for help.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p7"></span>*As yet for us,* he says, that, is, while
we were yet standing.  <span id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) And this
circumstance deserves to be noticed; for after the Jews had been
overthrown, they at length began to know how they had been previously
deceived, when they placed confidence in the Egyptians. Prosperity
inebriates men, so that they take delight ill their own vanities: and
while we seem to ourselves to stand, or while we remain alive, God is
disregarded, and we seek help here and there, and think our safety
beyond all danger. The Prophet then says, that the Jews had been
inebriated with false confidence, so that they disregarded God, and in
the meantime fled to the Egyptians. *When*, he says, *we were standing,
our eyes failed, etc*. We have before seen what this phrase means: the
eyes are said to fail, when with unwearied perseverance we pursue a hope
to the last, as it is said in the Psalms,

<span id="iii.v.xix-p11"></span>“Our eyes have failed for the living
God,” (<span id="iii.v.xix-p11.1"></span>[Ps
69:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.v.xix-p11.1"></span>;)

<span id="iii.v.xix-p12"></span>that is, We have persevered, and though
many trials may have wearied us, yet we have been constant in our hope
in God. So now the Prophet says, that the eyes of the people had failed;
but he adds, for a vain help, or a help of vanity, by which term he
designates the Egyptians: and there is an implied contrast between empty
and fallacious help and the help of God, which the people rejected when
they preferred the Egyptians. *Our eyes*, he says, *failed*, that is, we
were unwearied in hoping vainly, for we always thought that the
Egyptians would be a sufficient, defense to us. This is one thing.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p13"></span>He afterwards adds*, In our looking out,
we looked out to a nation which could not save us.* He. repeats the same
thing in other words. Some consider a relative to be understood, “In our
expectation with which we have expected,” etc.; but it seems not
necessary. I, then, so connect the words of the Prophet, that the
meaning is, that the Jews always turned their eyes to Egypt, as long as
they stood as a state and kingdom and thus they willfully deceived
themselves, because they took delight in their own vanity. The other
clause which follows has the same meaning, *In our expectation we
expected a nation,* etc.; and this clause is added as an explanation;
for the Prophet explains how their eyes failed for a vain hope, or for a
vain help, even because the people did not look to God, but only to the
Egyptians.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p14"></span>Now the words, to look out and looking
out, are not unsuitable, for they refer to those vain imaginations to
which the unbelieving give heed; for God called them, but turning away
from him they transferred their hope to the Egyptians. It was, then,
their own looking out or speculation, when, through a foolish conceit,
they imagined that safety would be secured to them by the Egyptians.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p15"></span>He says that they were a *nation which
could not save;* and there is no doubt but that the Prophet here puts
them in mind of the many warnings which had not been received by the
Jews, for God had tried to call them back from that ruinous confidence,
but without any success; for we know how much the Prophets labored in
this respect, but they were never believed until at length experience
proved how vain was the help of Egypt, as God had testified by his
servants.

<span id="iii.v.xx"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xx-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="iii.v.xx-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we are beset
on every side with so many allurements, and as Satan ceases not to draw
us here and there by vain flatteries, — O grant that we may recumb on
thee alone, even on thy power, and, in short, on thy word, nor doubt but
thou wilt be our deliverer, whatever may happen, and that we may always
so seek thee in our straits, and so acquiesce in the faithfulness of thy
promises, that we may calmly sustain all the assaults of afflictions,
until thou at length gatherest us into that blessed rest which is
prepared for us in heaven by Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="iii.v.xxii-p2"></span>**18.** They hunt our steps, that we

our end is come.

<span id="iii.v.xxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xxii-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxii-p6"></span>Many apply this verse to the Egyptians,
that they insidiously enticed the Jews to flee to them in their
difficulties. It is indeed, true, that the Jews had been deceived by
their false promises; and, as a harlot draws to herself young men by
wicked arts, so also the Jews had been captivated by the enticements of
the Egyptians. But the meaning of the Prophet seems to be different,
even this, — that the Chaldeans followed the Jews as hunters, so that
they observed their footsteps; and I connect together the two verses,
for it immediately follows, —

<span id="iii.v.xxiii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#019.md)<span
id="iii.v.xxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p2"></span>**19.** Our persecutors are swifter
than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they
laid wait for us in the wilderness.

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p3"></span>**19.** Velociores fucrunt
persequutores nostri aquilis coelorum; super montes insequuti sunt nos,
in deserto insidiati sunt nobis

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p6"></span>Here, then, the Prophet means, that the
Jews were so straitened, that there was no escape for them, because
their steps were observed by their enemies, and also because the
Chaldeans had recourse to the greatest celerity, that they might take
them.

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p7"></span>He then, says, first, that their
enemies were like hunters, for the Jews could not go even through the
streets of their own city. We know that they were reduced to the
greatest straits; but how hard the siege was is better expressed by this
similitude, even that they dared not walk through the city; for there is
an implied comparison, as though he had said, “We had no liberty in the
very city, much less were we allowed to go out and ramble through the
open fields.” he, in the second place, adds what corresponds with the
first clause, *Approach did our end, fulfilled were our days; surely
come did our end*  <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md) He concludes,
that no hope remained since their enemies were thus oppressing them. He,
then, infers that the end was at hand, by which he means final ruin or
destruction; and he adds, that the days were fulfilled, where, he seems
to compare the state of Jerusalem with the life of man; for he is said
to have fulfilled his day who leaves the world — for a certain time for
cur sojourn has been prefixed. God, when it pleases him, calls us to
himself. Hence, our time is then fulfilled, as our course is said to be
finished; for, as the life of man is compared in Scripture to a race, so
death is like the goal. So now, speaking of the city, the Prophet says
that its time was fulfilled, for it was not God’s will that it should
remain any longer. In the third place, he says, that the end had come.
He said before, that it was nigh, but he says now, that it had come. he,
in short, shows that God, having long spared the Jews, when he saw that
they made no end of sinning, at length had recourse to rigor, for they
had shamefully abused his forbearance; for he had long suspended his
judgment, and had often tried whether they were healable. The Prophet,
then, reproves now their obstinacy, when he says that their *end* had
*come*, and that their *time was fulfilled.*

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p11"></span>He afterwards, for the same purpose,
adds, that *swifter than eagles had been their persecutors* or pursuers.
The Prophet, no doubt;, continues the same subject. As, then, he had
made the Chaldeans to be like hunters, so he says now, that in flying
they exceeded the eagles. It is, indeed. a hyperbolical expression, but
the Prophet could not otherwise express the incredible celerity with
which the Chaldeans hastened in pursuing the Jews. Nor is there a doubt
but that he indirectly derided the security of the foolish people; for
we know, that whenever the prophets threatened them, this false opinion
ever prevailed, that the Chaldeans would not come, because they were far
away, the journey was long and difficult, time were many hinderances.
The Prophet, then, now taunts them for this confidence, by which they
had been deceived, when he says, that swifter titan the eagles of the
heavens were their enemies.

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p12"></span>He mentions the ways they adopted,
*Through the mountains they pursued, and laid in wait in the desert.* He
means that every way of escape was closed up. For when enemies come,
many hide themselves on mountains and thus escape; and others, betaking
themselves to the desert, find there some hiding-places. But the Prophet
says that such was the velocity of the Chaldeans, that the Jews in vain
looked to the mountains or to deserts, for snares were everywhere
prepared, and they were present everywhere to pursue them. Thus he
confirms what he had said, that the time was fulfilled, for the Lord
kept them shut up on every side.

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p13"></span>Now, though the Prophet speaks here of
the ruin of the city, yet we may gather a useful doctrine: When the hand
of God is against us, we in vain look around in all directions, for
there will be no safety for us on mountains, nor will solitude protect
us in the desert. As, then, we see that the Jews were closed up by God’s
hand, so when we contend with him, we in vain turn our eyes here and
there; for, however we may for a time entertain good hopes, yet God will
surely at last disappoint us. It follows, —

<span id="iii.v.xxiv"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#020.md)<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p2"></span>**20.** The breath of our nostrils, the
anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under
his shadow we shall live among the heathen.

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p3"></span>**20.** Spritus narium nostrarum
Christus Jehovae captus est laqueis ipsorum; de quo diximus, In umbra
ejus vivemus inter gentes.

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xxiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p6"></span>This verse, as I have said elsewhere,
has been ignorantly applied to Josiah, who fell in battle long before
the fall of the city. The royal dignity continued after his death; he
was himself buried in the grave of his fathers; and though the enemy was
victorious, yet he did not conic to the city. It is then absurd to apply
to that king what is here properly said of Zedekiah, the last king; for
though he was wholly unlike Josiah, yet he was one of David’s posterity,
and a type of Christ.

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p7"></span>As it was, then, God’s will that the
posterity of David should represent Christ, Zedekiah is here rightly
called the Christ of Jehovah, by which term Scripture designates all
kings, and even Saul; and though his kingdom was temporary, and soon
decayed, yet he is called “the Anointed of Jehovah;” and doubtless the
anointing, which he received by the hand of Samuel, was not altogether
in vain. But David is properly called the Anointed of Jehovah, together
with his posterity. Hence he often used these words, “Look on thy
Christ.” (<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p7.1"></span>[Ps
84:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p7.1"></span>.) And when Hannah in her song spoke of the
Christ of Jehovah, she had no doubt a regard to this idea. (<span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p7.2"></span>[1Sa
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#010.md)<span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p7.2"></span>.) And, at length, our Lord was called the
Christ of the Lord, for so Simeon called him. (<span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p7.3"></span>[Lu
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p7.3"></span>.)

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p8"></span>Now, then, we perceive that this passage
cannot be understood except of king Zedekiah. It ought at the same time
to be added, that he is called the Christ of Jehovah, because his crown
was not as yet cast down, but he still bore that diadem by which he had
been adorned by God. As, then, the throne of David still remained,
Zedekiah, however unworthy he was of that honor, was yet the Christ of
Jehovah, as Manasseh was, and others who were wholly degenerated.

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p9"></span>The Prophet, however, seems to ascribe
to Zedekiah far more than he deserved, when he calls the life of the
people. But this difficulty may be easily removed; the man himself is
not regarded according to his merits, but as he was called by God, and
endued with that high and singular honor; for we know that what is here
said extended to all the posterity of David, —

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p10"></span>“I have made him the first-begotten
among all the kings  
of the earth.” (<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p10.2"></span>[Ps
89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md)<span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p10.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p11"></span>For though the kings of the earth
obtained not their authority, except as they were established by God’s
decree, yet the king from David’s posterity was first-begotten among
them all. In short, it was a sacerdotal, and even a sacred kingdom,
because God had peculiarly dedicated that throne to himself. This
peculiarity ought then to be borne in mind, that we may not look on the
individual in himself.

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p12"></span>Then the passage runs consistently,
when he says, that the *Messiah*, or the anointed *of Jehovah, had been
taken it snares;* for we know that he was taken; and this is consistent
with history. He had fled by a hidden way into the desert, and he
thought that lie had escaped from the hands of his enemies; but he was
soon seized, and brought to king Nebuchadnezzar. As, then, he had
unexpectedly fallen into the hands of his enemies, rightly does the
Prophet say metaphorically, that he was taken in their snares.

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p13"></span>He calls him the *spirit of the
nostrils* of the people, because the people without their king was like
a mutilated and an imperfect body. For God made David king, and also his
posterity, for this end, that the life of the people might in a manner
reside in him. As far, then, as David was the head of the people, and so
constituted by God, he was even their life. The same was the case with
all his posterity, as long as the succession continued; for the favor of
God was not extinguished until all liberty vanished, when the city was
destroyed, and even the name of the people was as it were abolished.
 <span id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md)

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p15"></span>But we must observe what we have before
said, that these high terms in which the posterity of David were spoken
of, properly belong to Christ only; for David was not the life of the
people, except as he was the type of Christ, and represented his person.
Then what is said was not really found in the posterity of David, but
only typically. Hence the truth, the reality, is to be sought in no
other but in Christ And we hence learn that the Church is dead, and is
like a maimed body, when separated from its head. If, then, we desire to
live before God, we must come to Christ, who is really the spirit or the
breath of our nostrils; for as man that is dead does no longer breathe,
so also we are said to be dead when separated from Christ. On the other
hand, as long as there is between him and us a sacred union, though our
life is hid, and we die, yet we live in him, and though we are dead to
the world, yet our life is in heaven, as also Paul and Peter call us
thither. (<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p15.1"></span>[Col.
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004.md)<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p15.1"></span>;
<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p15.2"></span>[2Pe
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#016.md)<span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p15.2"></span>.) In short, Jeremiah means that the favor
of God was as it were extinguished when the king was taken away, because
the happiness of the people depended on the king, and the royal dignity
was as it were a sure pledge of the grace and favor of God; hence the
blessing of God ceased, when the king was taken away from the Jews.

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p16"></span>It follows at length, *Of whom we have
said, Under thy shadow we shall live among the nations*. The Prophet
shews that the Jews in vain hoped for anything any more as to their
restoration; for the origin of all blessing was from the king. God had
bereaved them of their king; it then follows that they were in a
hopeless state. But the Prophet that he might more clearly express this,
says, that the people thought that they would be safe, provided the
kingdom remained, — *We shall live*, they said, *even among the nations
under the shadow of our king;* that is, “Though we may be driven to
foreign nations, yet the king will be able to gather us, and his shadow
will extend far and wide to keep us safe.” So the Jews believed, but
falsely, because by their defection they had cast away the yoke of
Christ and of God, as it is said in <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p16.1"></span>[Ps
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#003.md)<span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p16.1"></span>. As then they had shaken off the heavenly
yoke, they in vain trusted in the shadow of an earthly king, and were
wholly unworthy of the guardianship and protection of God.  <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) It afterwards follows, —

<span id="iii.v.xxv"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#021.md)<span id="iii.v.xxv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p2"></span>**21.** Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter
of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass
through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p3"></span>**21.** Guade et laetare, filia Edom quae
habitas in terra Uts (<span id="iii.v.xxv-p3.1"></span>עף, *ad verbum*;)
etiam super te transibit calix, inebriaberis et nudaberis.

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xxv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p6"></span>The Prophet in this verse intimates that
the Jews were exposed to the reproaches and taunts of all their enemies,
but he immediately moderates their sorrow, by adding a consolation; and
it was a sorrow that in itself must have been very bitter; for we know
that nothing’ is harder to bear, in a state of misery, than the petulant
insults of enemies; these wound us more than all other evils which we
may suffer. The Prophet then intimates, that the Jews had been so
reduced, that all the ungodly and malevolent were able, with impunity,
to exult over them, and to taunt them with their troubles. This is done
in the former clause but its it was a prophecy, or rather a
denunciation, extremely bitter, he mitigates the atrocity of the evil,
when he says that their enemies would have soon in their turn to undergo
punishment.

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p7"></span>Some explain the whole verse as spoken
ironically, as though the Prophet had said tauntingly, — “Go now, ye
Idumeans, and rejoice; but your joy shall be evanescent.”  <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) But I rather think that he refers to
the very summit of extreme misery, because the Jews had been thus
exposed to the taunts of their enemies; but he afterwards adds some
alleviation, because all their enemies would at length be punished.
There is, in <span id="iii.v.xxv-p8.1"></span>[Mic
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008.md)<span id="iii.v.xxv-p8.1"></span>,
a similar mode of speaking, though there is no mention made there of
Edom; for there the Prophet speaks generally to all those who envied the
people, and were their adversaries: he compares the people, according’
to what was usual, to a woman; and we know that in that sex there is
much more jealousy than in men; and then, when there is a grudge, they
fiercely urge their pleas, that they may have an occasion to speak evil
of others. Therefore the Church, after having acknowledged that she had
been deservedly chastised, adds, “Rejoice not over me, mine enemy.” But
I have already fully explained the Prophet’s meaning, — that the Church
calls all her enemies an enemy, or an inimical woman, as though there
had been some quarrel or jealousy between women. Hence she says,

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p9"></span>“Though I have fallen, yet rejoice thou
not, my enemy; though I lie in darkness, yet the Lord will be my light —
though then my enemy has rejoiced, yet my eyes shall see when she shall
be trodden down.” (<span id="iii.v.xxv-p9.1"></span>[Mic.
7:8](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#008.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#010)<span id="iii.v.xxv-p9.1"></span>..md)

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p10"></span>The Prophet no doubt meant there to
mitigate the sorrow of the godly, who saw that they were insolently
taunted by all their neighbors. He then shews the necessity of a patient
endurance for a time; for God would at length stretch out his hand, and
render to enemies the reward of their barbarity.

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p11"></span>But why in this place mention is made of
Edom, rather than of other nations, is not evident. The Jews were,
indeed, surrounded on every side with enemies, for they had as many
enemies as neighbors. But the Idumeans, above others, had manifested
hostility to the chosen people. And the indignity was the greater,
because they had descended from the same father, for Isaac was their
common father; and they derived their origin from two brothers, Esau and
Jacob. As, then, the Idumeans were related to the Jews, their cruelty
was less tolerable; for they thus forgot their own race, and raged
against their brethren and relatives. Hence it is said in <span
id="iii.v.xxv-p11.1"></span>[Ps
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md)<span
id="iii.v.xxv-p11.1"></span>,

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p12"></span>“Remember, O Lord, the children of Edom,
who said, in the day of Jerusalem, Down with it, down with it, to the
very foundation.”

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p13"></span>The Prophet, then, after having
imprecated God’s vengeance on all the ungodly, mentioned especially the
Idumeans; and why? because they indulged their cruelty above all others;
for they were standard-bearers, as it were, to enemies, and were like
falls, by which the fire was more kindled; for this address was no doubt
made to the Chaldeans,

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p14"></span>“Make bare, make bare; spare not;  
let not a stone remain on a stone.” (<span

id="iii.v.xxv-p14.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p15"></span>As, then, the Idumeans had behaved most
cruelly towards their own relatives, the Prophet complains of them, and
asks God to render to them what they deserved.

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p16"></span>So now in this place our Prophet says,
*Be glad and rejoice, thou daughter of Edom, who dwellest in the land of
Uz* By this clause, as I have already said, Jeremiah intimates that the
Jews were exposed to the taunts of their enemies, because the Idumeans
could now insult them with security. But he immediately adds, *also*:
here he begins a new subject, and this is intimated by the particle
<span id="iii.v.xxv-p16.1"></span>גם *gam*, *To thee also shall pass the
cup* He employs a common metaphor; for adversity is denoted in Scripture
by the word cup; for God, according to his will, gives to drink to each
as much as he pleases. As when a master of a family distributes drink to
his children and servants; so also God, in a manner, extends his cup to
every one whom he chastises; nor does he allow any one either to reject
the cup offered, or to throw away the wine, but he constrains him to
drink and to exhaust to the very dregs as much as he gives to each to
drink. Hence it is for this reason that the Prophet says now that the
cup would pass over to the Idumeans; for we know that, shortly after,
they were subdued by the Chaldeans, with whom they had before been
united. But when they had by their perfidy fallen off from their treaty,
they were in their turn punished. As, then, the agreement they had made
with the Chaldeans did not continue, the Prophet says, that to them also
the cup would pass over.

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p17"></span>He adds, *Thou shalt be inebriated and
made naked* God is wont thus to distinguish between his own children and
aliens or the reprobate; for he indeed gives a bitter potion to his own
children to drink, but it is as much as they are able to drink; but he
altogether chokes others, because lie constrains them, as it has been
already said, to drink to the very dregs. So, then, the Prophet now
compares the extreme miseries which the Idumeans suffered to
drunkenness; and to the same purpose are the words which follow*, Thou
shalt be made naked* For he thus intimates, that they would be so
confounded with the atrocity of their evils, as to have no care for
decency, and to be dead to all shame: as a drunken man, who is
overpowered by wine, disregards himself, and falls and exposes himself
as Noah did; so also the Prophet says, that so great would be the
calamities of Edom, that the people, exposed to every reproach, would
afford occasion to all around them for taunts. As when a sot lies down
in the mire, casts away his garments, and makes an exposure of himself,
it is a spectacle both sad and shameful; so the Prophet says, that the
Idumeans would be like the drunken, because they would lie down in their
reproach. It follows, —

<span id="iii.v.xxvi"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p1"></span><span
id="iii.v.xxvi-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
4:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#022.md)<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p2"></span>**22.** The punishment of thine iniquity
is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away
into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he
will discover thy sins.

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p3"></span>**22.** Completa est iniquitas tua,
filia Sion; non adjiciet ad te in exilium trahendam; visitavit
iniquitatem filiae Edom, et discooperuit super peccatum tuum (*hoc est*,
nudavit peccatum tuum.)

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p5"></span><span id="iii.v.xxvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p6"></span>This verse, in my judgment, is
incorrectly explained; and the Jews have toiled much, for there seems to
be a kind of inconsistency, since it is certain that they were
afterwards scattered into exile, not only once, but several times. Hence
they interpret this place of the second dispersion by Titus, under the
authority of his father Vespasian. They then say that the iniquity of
the people was then completed, for after that exile no change has
followed. Otherwise they do not think that this prediction of the
Prophet accords with the reality or the event; for, as I have said, they
have been driven into all lands. They had been, indeed, before
fugitives, as Moses had declared concerning them. For we know that Jews
dwelt in Greece and in Macedonia; we know that many of the cities of
Italy were full of this people, until by the edict of Claudius Caesar
they were expelled from Italy; for he thought that Italy was infected by
them, and he drove them afar off, as though they were contagious. But
the Jews lay hold on these refinements to no purpose for the Prophet
simply meant to say, that such would be, the punishment of the people,
that it would not be necessary then to repeat it.

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p7"></span>When, therefore, he says that *their
iniquity*, or the punishment of their iniquity, *was completed*, he
intimates that God had dealt so severely with them, that there was
nothing short of extreme rigor: and this mode of speaking occurs
elsewhere. To the same purpose is what immediately follows: The enemy,
or God, which is the same, *will no more add to draw thee into exile,* —
why? for what need was there of a second exile when the whole land had
been reduced to solitude? since also the poor who had been left in the
land had at length gone into Egypt, whence they were brought again into
Chaldea; but they were, at the time, fugitives from the Holy Land. Then
the Prophet means, that God’s judgment was, in all its parts, completed,
that nothing short of extreme calamity had happened to the Jews.

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p8"></span>It afterwards follows in the second
clause, *He will visit*, which is, indeed, in the past tense, *he hath
visited*, but he speaks of what was future. According to the usual
manner of the prophets, in order to confirm the prediction, he speaks of
the event as already past, He has visited the iniquity of the daughter
of Edom; so that thy wickedness has been uncovered. The meaning will be
clearer if we add the particles of comparison, “As thy punishment,
daughter of Sion, has been completed; so thine iniquity, daughter of
Edom, shall be visited;” or if we render the words thus, by way of
concession, “The punishment of thine iniquity, daughter of Sion, has
indeed been completed; but thy sin, daughter of Edom, shall be
uncovered.”  <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md)

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p12"></span>We, in short, see that the reason is
explained why the Prophet, in the last verse, alleviated, with comfort,
the sorrow of the people, that though the Jews were very miserable, it
would yet be nothing better with Edom, when the time of visitation came.
And in saying that the punishment of iniquity was completed, he refers
not to their sin, but says that they had been thus chastised, as it
seemed good to God to execute all his rigor towards them; and nearly the
same manner of speaking is found in the fortieth chapter of Isaiah. Then
the Prophet does not deny but that the Jews might at a future time
become exiles; but he says that their transmigration now was complete,
so that it was not necessary that Nebuchadnezzar should again denude the
land of its inhabitants: this had been done, as it were, by a sudden
whirlwind; for by one sweep they had been snatched away. The land,
indeed, was before made desolate, but when Nebuchadnezzar took
possession of the city, he only left behind the dregs of the people. And
he did this on purpose that he might have there some people as
tributaries. Then that transmigration was complete.

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p13"></span>But the Prophet means not here, that
God would not afterwards banish and scatter the Jews as they deserved.
There is then no inconsistency, that the Jews afterwards became
fugitives and wanderers through the whole world, and that yet the enemy
would not again draw them into captivity, for he speaks here only of the
Chaldeans: and this was said, because Jeremiah wished to compare the
Jews with the Idumeans, and to shew, that though the Idumeans insolently
exulted over them, yet their own calamity was nigh, which would wholly
overwhelm them, as the case had previously been with the Jews. There is
no time now to begin with the prayer of Jeremiah: I must therefore defer
it till the next Lecture.

<span id="iii.v.xxvii"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxvii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="iii.v.xxvii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou seest
that at this day the mouths not only of our enemies, but of thine also,
are open to speak evil, — O grant, that no occasion may be given them,
especially as their slanders are cast on thy holy name; but restrain
thou their insolence, and so spare us, that though we deserve to be
chastised, thou mayest yet have regard for thine own glory, and thus
gather us under Christ our head, and restore thy scattered Church, until
we shall at length be all gathered into that celestial kingdom, which
thine only-begotten Son our Lord has procured for us by his own blood. —
Amen.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p7"></span> Here, as in the two first chapters, the
verses only begin alphabetically, but instead of having three or six
lines, they have only two or four. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_206"></span>[207](cc21012.htm#fr_206.md) <span
id="iii.v.ii-p8.5"></span>

<span id="iii.v.ii-p9"></span> This chapter, like the two first
chapters, begins with the word <span id="iii.v.ii-p9.1"></span>איכה,
“How this!” and the verbs are in the future tense, used for the present.
—

<span id="iii.v.ii-p10"></span>How *is* this! tarnished is gold,  
Changed is fine gold, the best:  
Cast forth are the sacred stones  
At the head of every street.

<span id="iii.v.ii-p11"></span> — *Ed*

<span id="fn_207"></span>[208](cc21012.htm#fr_207.md) <span
id="iii.v.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iii-p9"></span> The value, and not the appearance, is
evidently meant: the “sons of Sion” were “precious,” as here expressly
stated. In this respect they had been of the same estimate with gold;
but now they were as worthless as potter’s vessels: they were so
esteemed and treated, —

<span id="iii.v.iii-p10"></span>The sons of Sion *were* precious,  
Of worth equal to pure gold;  
How is this! they have been deemed as earthen vessels,  
The work of the hands of the potter.

<span id="iii.v.iii-p11"></span> — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_208"></span>[209](cc21012.htm#fr_208.md) <span
id="iii.v.iv-p7.3"></span>

<span id="iii.v.iv-p8"></span> The reference here is to the conduct of
mothers, called here “the daughter of my people,” as it appears evident
from the following verse, —

<span id="iii.v.iv-p9"></span>Even dragons have drawn out the breast,  
They have suckled their young ones:  
The daughter of my people *has been* for cruelty  
Like the ostriches in the desert.

<span id="iii.v.iv-p10"></span>It is said that the ostrich lays her eggs
and forsakes them. See <span id="iii.v.iv-p10.1"></span>[Job
39:15](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#015.md)<span
id="iii.v.iv-p10.1"></span>. The verb, to be, is understood, as the case
often is, but it must ever be in the same tense as the verb or verbs
connected with the sentence. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[210](cc21012.htm#fr_209.md) <span
id="iii.v.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.v-p7"></span> The verbs here are in the past tense, and
not in the present, as in our version, —

<span id="iii.v.v-p8"></span>Cleave did the tongue of the suckling  
To his palate through thirst;  
Children asked bread,  
A breaker, none *was* to them.

<span id="iii.v.v-p9"></span> — *Ed*

<span id="fn_210"></span>[211](cc21012.htm#fr_210.md) <span
id="iii.v.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vi-p8"></span> The dunghills were collections of
cow-dung and other things heaped together for fuel instead of wood. They
had been brought up “on scarlet,” *i.e.,* on scarlet couches, they were
now glad to lie down anywhere, even on dunghills, and hence they are
said to have embraced them, as though they had a love for them, —

<span id="iii.v.vi-p9"></span>They who had fed on delicacies  
Perished in the streets;  
They who had been brought up on scarlet  
Embraced the dunghills.

<span id="iii.v.vi-p10"></span> — *Ed*

<span id="fn_211"></span>[212](cc21012.htm#fr_211.md) <span
id="iii.v.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p9"></span> The early versions and the *Targ*.
render the words “iniquity,” and “sin;” but modern critics agree with
*Calvin.* Penalty and punishment might be suitably adopted. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[213](cc21012.htm#fr_212.md) <span
id="iii.v.vii-p10.3"></span>

<span id="iii.v.vii-p11"></span> The clause might be rendered, —

<span id="iii.v.vii-p12"></span>And not wearied against (or, over) her
were hands.

<span id="iii.v.vii-p13"></span>This is substantially the *Sept.* and
the *Syr. Grotius* says that the meaning is, that Sodom was destroyed
not by human means, that is, not by a siege, as Jerusalem had been. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[214](cc21012.htm#fr_213.md) <span
id="iii.v.viii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.viii-p13"></span> As to these two verses there is much
disagreement in the early versions and the *Targ.;* that of the *Sept.*
comes nearest to the original. They may be thus rendered, —

<span id="iii.v.viii-p14"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.viii-p15"></span>**7.** Clearer were her Nazarites than
snow,  
They were whiter than milk;  
Ruddier were they in body than rubies,  
Sapphire was their polish (or smoothness:)

<span id="iii.v.viii-p16"></span>**8.** Darker than the dusk became
their appearance,  
They were not known in the streets:  
Cleave did their skin to their bones,  
Dried up, it became like a stick.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p17"></span>“Rubies,” rendered “pearls,” by
*Bochart;* “load stones,” or magnets, by *Parkhurst;* “red corals,” by
*Gesenius.* They were no doubt precious stones of reddish appearance.
The “sapphire” is mentioned for its smoothness, as it appears from the
contrast at the end of the eighth verse, where it is said that their
skin had become like a dried “stick,” whose rind is shriveled. *“Dusk”*
is rendered *“soot”* by the *Sept.,* and “coals” by the *Vulg.* and the
*Syr.* <span id="iii.v.viii-p17.1"></span>שחור is the dusk, or the dawn:
but the river Nile is also thus called on account of its muddy and dusky
waters. See <span id="iii.v.viii-p17.2"></span>[Jer
2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.v.viii-p17.2"></span>. This being the case, may it not be so
taken here.; The character of the passage favors this, “snow,” “milk,”
etc. Then the line would be, —

<span id="iii.v.viii-p18"></span>Darker than Sihor (or, the Nile) became
their appearance.

<span id="iii.v.viii-p19"></span> — *Ed*

<span id="fn_214"></span>[215](cc21012.htm#fr_214.md) <span
id="iii.v.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.ix-p8"></span> *Houbigant* and *Blayney* have given the
following version of this clause, which has been approved by *Horsley,*
—

<span id="iii.v.ix-p9"></span>For those (the former) departed, having
been cut off  
Before the fruits of the field.

<span id="iii.v.ix-p10"></span>That is, they bad been cut off before the
fruits of the field failed, which occasioned the famine. This rendering
is more satisfactory than our version or that of *Calvin.* — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_215"></span>[216](cc21012.htm#fr_215.md) <span
id="iii.v.xvi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p8"></span> This clause has been variously
explained. The whole passage from <span id="iii.v.xvi-p8.1"></span>[La
4:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#012.md)<span
id="iii.v.xvi-p8.1"></span> inclusive, ought to be considered. The
taking of Jerusalem is said to have been incredible, even to heathens.
Then the Prophet, in <span id="iii.v.xvi-p8.2"></span>[La
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#013.md)<span id="iii.v.xvi-p8.2"></span>,
tells the cause — “the sins of the prophets and the iniquities of the
priests;” and in <span id="iii.v.xvi-p8.3"></span>[La
4:14-16](../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.v.xvi-p8.3"></span>**,** he describes their shame and their
punishment at the siege, when the people found out by experience that
they had be deceived by them, —

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p9"></span> 

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p10"></span>**13.** For the sins of her prophets,  
*For* the iniquities of her priests,  
Who had shed in the midst of her  
The blood of the righteous, —

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p11"></span>**14.** They wandered frantic in the
streets,  
They were (or, had been) polluted with blood:  
Inasmuch as they could not  
But touch their garments,

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p12"></span>**15.** “Depart ye, uncleanness,” they
cried to them,  
“Depart, depart, touch not:”  
When they fled, yea, became fugitives,  
They said among the heathens,  
“They shall no more dwell *there*”;

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p13"></span>**16.** The face of Jehovah, their
portion,  
Shall no more look on them;  
The face of their priests they regard not,  
To their elders they shew no favor.”

<span id="iii.v.xvi-p14"></span>The last five lines contain what the
heathens said, when they observed that the prophets and the priests were
pronounced unclean by the people, and were ordered to depart. They had
shed blood, and were thus polluted, or in their frenzy they touched the
slain and became thus polluted. Their retribution was just, and rendered
to them by their own people, whom they had led astray: for instead of
attending to the true prophets, they killed them, and flattered the
people with falsehoods, and encouraged them in their idolatry and vices;
and thus brought on the ruin of a city deemed impregnable. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_216"></span>[217](cc21012.htm#fr_216.md) <span
id="iii.v.xix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xix-p8"></span> The true reading is no doubt <span
id="iii.v.xix-p8.1"></span>עדינו; and *Blayney* thinks that there is a
<span id="iii.v.xix-p8.2"></span>ו wanting before the next verb, as it
is in other in other instances; <span id="iii.v.xix-p8.3"></span>[1
Kings 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg1001.htm#014.md),

It is supplied in the *Sept., Syr.,* and *Vulg.*

<span id="iii.v.xix-p9"></span>Yet we *were,* and fail did our eyes  
As to our assistance;  
In vain by looking out did we look out  
To a nation that could not save.

<span id="iii.v.xix-p10"></span>The *Syr*. connect “in vain,” more
properly, with the third line. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[218](cc21012.htm#fr_217.md) <span
id="iii.v.xxiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p8"></span> He describes throughout what had taken
place. Our version is not right in giving the verbs in the present
tense. “For” is better than “surely” before “come.”

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p9"></span>They hunted our footsteps,  
That we could not walk in our streets:  
Near was our end; fulfilled were our days,  
For come had our end.

<span id="iii.v.xxiii-p10"></span>Then he describes what happened when
the city was taken. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[219](cc21012.htm#fr_218.md) <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p14"></span> A kingdom cannot exist without a king.
Hence the king may be said to be the breath or the life of the body
politic. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[220](cc21012.htm#fr_219.md) <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p16.2"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p17"></span> The last clause ought to be thus
rendered, —

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p18"></span>Under whose shadow, we said,  
We shall live among the nations.

<span id="iii.v.xxiv-p19"></span>The *Syr*. in some measure imitates the
original, but neither the *Sept.* nor the *Vulg.* The <span
id="iii.v.xxiv-p19.1"></span>אשר is not governed by “we said.” It can be
rendered literally in Welsh. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_220"></span>[221](cc21012.htm#fr_220.md) <span
id="iii.v.xxv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxv-p8"></span> This is the sense that is commonly
taken: *Gataker, Lowth, Scott,* and *Blayney,* regard the expression as
ironical. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[222](cc21012.htm#fr_221.md) <span
id="iii.v.xxvi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p9"></span> The word “iniquity” is used in this
verse in two senses. This we discover by the two verbs which are used.
To complete “iniquity” can here mean no other thing than to complete the
punishment due to it; and that punishment was exile, as the following
words shew. But to “visit” iniquity clearly means to punish it. —

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p10"></span>Completed has been thine iniquity,
daughter of Sion;  
He will not again remove thee:  
He has visited thine iniquity, daughter of Edom;  
Having been removed for thy sins,  
*or*, — He has removed *thee* for thy sins.

<span id="iii.v.xxvi-p11"></span>Though all the early versions and the
*Targ*. agree in rendering the last verb in the sense of discovering or
uncovering, yet the other meaning, which it often has, and even in the
second line of this verse, is more suitable to this place. Removal or
migration had been the punishment of the Jews: the same was to be the
punishment of Edom. In this sense is the word rendered by *Blayney* and
*Henderson.* The past time in the latter clause is evidently used for
the future, according to the usual manner of the Prophets, “He will
visit,” etc., “he will remove, *etc.* — *Ed.*
