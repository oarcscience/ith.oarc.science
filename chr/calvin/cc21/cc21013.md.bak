<span id="iii.vi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 5

<span id="iii.vi.i"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.i-p1"></span>Lecture Seventeeth

<span id="iii.vi.ii"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#001.md)<span id="iii.vi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p2"></span>**1.** Remember, O LORD, what is come
upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p3"></span>**1.** Memento (recordare,) Jehova, quid
sit nobis (*hoc est*, quomodo nobiscum agatur.) aspice et vide
opprobrium nostrum.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p6"></span>This prayer ought to be read as
unconnected with the Lamentations, for the initial letters of the verses
are not written according to the order of the Alphabet; yet it is a
complaint rather than a prayer; for Jeremiah mentions those things which
had happened to the people in their extreme calamity in order to turn
God to compassion and mercy.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p7"></span>He says first, *Remember* what has
happened to us; and then in the second part he explains himself, *Look
and see our reproach* Now the words, though brief and concise, yet
contain a useful doctrine — that God is pleased to bring help to the
miserable when their evils come to an account before him, especially
when they are unjustly oppressed. It is, indeed, certain that nothing is
unknown to God, but this mode of speaking is according to the
perceptions of men; for we think that God disregards our miseries, or we
imagine that his back is turned to us when he does not immediately
succor us. But as I have said, he is simply to be asked to look on our
evils, for we know what he testifies of himself; so that as he claims to
himself the office of helping the miserable and the unjustly oppressed,
we ought to acquiesce in this consolation, that as soon as he is pleased
to look on the evils we suffer, aid is at the same time prepared for us.

<span id="iii.vi.ii-p8"></span>There is mention especially made of
reproach, that the indignity might move God the more: for it was for
this end that he took the people under his protection, that they might
be for his glory and honor, as Moses says. As, then, it was God’s will
that the riches of his glory should appear in that people, nothing could
have been more inconsistent that that instead of glory they should have
nothing but disgrace and reproach. This, then, is the reason why the
Prophet makes a special mention of the reproach of the people. It
follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.iii"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#002.md)<span id="iii.vi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p2"></span>**2.** Our inheritance is turned to
strangers, our houses to aliens.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p3"></span>**2.** Haereditas nostra devoluta est ad
exteros, domus nostrae ad alienos.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p6"></span>A catalogue of many calamities is now
given by the Prophet, and as I have reminded you, for this end, that he
may obtain God’s favor for himself and for the whole people. It was by
no means a reasonable thing, that the inheritance of the elect people
should be given to aliens; for we know that the land had been promised
to Abraham four hundred years before his children possessed it; we know
that this promise had been often repeated, “This land shall be to you
for an inheritance.” For though God sustained all nations, yet he was
pleased to take a peculiar care of his people. In short, no land has
ever been given to men in so singular a way as the land of Canaan to the
posterity of Abraham. As, then, this inheritance had been for so many
ages possessed by the chosen people, Jeremiah does not without reason
complain that it was turned over to aliens.

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p7"></span>In the second clause he repeats the same
thing; but he shews that the Jews had not only been robbed of their
fields, but had been cast out of their houses, a more grievous and
disgraceful thing. For it sometimes happens, that when one loses his
farm, his fields, and vineyards, his house remains to him untouched; but
the Prophet here amplifies the misery of his own nation, that they were
not only deprived of their fields and possessions, but that they were
also ejected from their own houses, and others had possession of them.
For it is a sight deemed affecting even among heathens, when one
unworthy of any honor succeeds in the place of another eminent in wealth
and dignity. Well known are these words, —

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p8"></span>O house of Aucus! How ruled by an
unequal master!  <span id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md)

<span id="iii.vi.iii-p10"></span>As Tarquinius had succeeded and taken
possession of the kingdom, the heathen poet upbraidingly said that the
house of Ancus had passed over to those who were at first exiles and
fugitives, but afterwards became proud and cruel tyrants. So also in
this place Jeremiah says that aliens dwelt in the houses of the people.
It follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.iv"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#003.md)<span id="iii.vi.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p2"></span>**3.** We are orphans and fatherless, our
mothers *are* as widows.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p3"></span>**3.** Pupilli fuimus patre (non patre,)
matres nostrae tanquam viduae.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p6"></span>Here the Prophet not only speaks in the
person of the whole people, but utters also the groans and complaints of
each; for this could not have been suitable to the whole Church, as he
speaks of fathers and mothers. We hence see that this verse does not
apply to the whole body, but to individual members, though every one of
the people might have said that widows and orphans were everywhere seen.

<span id="iii.vi.iv-p7"></span>Now, this usually happens when a nation
is consumed either by pestilence or by war; for in one battle all do not
so fall that a whole country becomes full of orphans. But the Prophet
sets forth here the orphanage and widowhood occasioned through the
continued vengeance of God, for he had not ceased to afflict the people
until by degrees they were exhausted. It was, indeed, a sad spectacle to
see among the chosen people so many widows, and also so many children
deprived of their fathers. It follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.v"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.v-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.v-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:4](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#004.md)<span id="iii.vi.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.v-p2"></span>**4.** We have drunken our water for
money; our wood is sold unto us.

<span id="iii.vi.v-p3"></span>**4.** Aquas nostras pecunia bibimus,
ligna nostra pretio veniunt (*non* veneunt, *nam intelligit ligna
afferri, aut venire in illorum manus non sine pretio*.)

<span id="iii.vi.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.v-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.v-p6"></span>The Prophet here relates, that the people
were denuded, that they labored under the want of water and of wood. He
does not say that they were only deprived of corn and wine, he does not
complain that any of their luxuries were lessened; but he mentions water
and wood, the common things of life; for the use of water, as it is
said, is common to all; no one is so poor, if he dwells not in a land
wholly dry, but that he has water enough to drink. For if there be no
fountains, there are at least rivers, there are wells; nor do men perish
through thirst, except in deserts and in places uninhabitable. As, then,
water might be had everywhere, the Prophet here sets forth the extreme
misery of the people, for water was even sold to them. In stony and high
places water is sold; but this is a very rare thing. The Prophet here
means that the people were not only deprived of their wealth, but
reduced to such a state of want that they had no water without buying
it.

<span id="iii.vi.v-p7"></span>At the same time he seems to express
something worse when he says, *Our water we drink for money*, and our
*wood is brought to us for a price*. It is not strange that wood should
be bought; but the Prophet means that water was sold to the Jews which
had been their own, and that they were also compelled to buy wood which
had been their own. Thus the possessive pronouns are to be considered as
emphatical. Then he says, “Our own waters we drink,” etc.  <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md) He calls them the waters of the
people, which by right they might have claimed as their own; and he also
calls the wood The same; it was that to which the people had a
legitimate right. He then says that all things had been so taken away by
their enemies, that they were forced to buy, not only the wine which had
been taken from their cellars, and the corn which had been taken from
their granaries, but also the water and the wood.

<span id="iii.vi.v-p12"></span>But were any one disposed to take the
words more simply, the complaint would not be unsuitable, — that the
people, who before had abundance of wine and all other things, were
constrained to buy everything, even water and wood. For it is a grievous
change when any one, who could once cut wood of his own, and gather his
own wine and corn, is not able to get even a drop of water without
buying it. This is a sad change. So this passage may be understood. It
follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.vi"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#005.md)<span id="iii.vi.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p2"></span>**5.** Our necks *are* under persecution:
we labour, *and* have no rest.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p3"></span>**5.** Super colla nostra (*vel*,
cervicibus nostris) persecutionem passi sumus; laboravimus non requies
nobis.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p6"></span>Here he says that the people were
oppressed with a grievous bondage. It is, indeed, a metaphorical
expression when he says, that people suffered persecution on their
necks. Enemies may sometimes be troublesome to us, either before our
face, or behind our backs, or by our sides; but when they so domineer as
to ride on our necks, in this kind of insult there is extreme
degradation. Hence the Prophet here complains of the servile and even
disgraceful oppression of the people when he says, that the Jews
*suffered persecution on their necks.*

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p7"></span>The meaning is, that the enemies so
domineered at the, it pleasure, that the Jews dared not to raise up
their heads. They were, indeed, worthy of this reward — for we know that
they had an iron neck; for when God would have them to bear his yoke,
they were wholly unbending; nay, they were like untameable wild beasts.
As, then, their hardness had been so great, God rendered to them a just
reward for their pride and obstinacy, when their enemies laid such a
burden on their necks.  <span id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md)

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p13"></span>But the Prophet sets forth here this
indignity, that he might turn God to mercy; that is, that the Chaldeans
thus oppressed as they pleased the chosen people.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p14"></span>He adds, that they *labored and had no
rest.* He intimates by these words that there were no limits nor end to
their miseries and troubles; for the phrase in Hebrew is, *We have
labored and there was no rest*. It often happens that when one is
pressed down with evils for a short time, a relaxation comes. But the
Prophet. says that there was no end to the miseries of the people. Then
to labor without rest is the same as to be pressed down with incessant
afflictions, from which there is no outlet. Their obstinacy was worthy
also of this reward, for they had fought against God, not for a few
months or years only, but for many years. We know how long the Prophet
called them without any success. Here, however, he seeks favor with God,
by saying that the people were miserable without limits or end.

<span id="iii.vi.vii"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#006.md)<span id="iii.vi.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p2"></span>**6.** We have given the hand *to* the
Egyptians, *and to* the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p3"></span>**6.** AEgyptiis dedimus manum Assyriis,
ut saturemur panibus.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p6"></span>He speaks here of the mendicity of the
people, that they sought bread from every quarter. To give the hand, is
explained in three ways: some say that it means humbly to ask; others,
to make an agreement; and others, to extend it in token of misery, as he
who cannot ask for help, intimates his wants by extending his hand. But
the Prophet seems simply to mean that the people were so distressed by
want, that they begged bread. I then take the expression, to give the
hand, as meaning that they asked bread, as beggars usually do.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p7"></span>He now says that they *gave* or extended
*the* *hand* both to the *Egyptians* and to the *Assyrians*, which was a
most unworthy and disgraceful thing; for the Egyptians had been their
most troublesome enemies, and the Assyrians afterwards followed their
example. At that time, indeed, the Egyptians pretended to be the friends
of the chosen people, and made a treaty with them; but the Jews were
held in contempt by them as they deserved, for they had prostituted as
it were themselves like harlots. As, then, they had been despised by the
Egyptians, it was a disgrace and reproach the most bitter, when they
were compelled to beg bread in Egypt, and then in Assyria; for this
might have been turned to the bitterest taunts.

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p8"></span>We now, then, perceive the meaning of
the Prophet; even this reward also God justly rendered to them. He had
promised them a fruitful land, in which he was ready to support them to
the full. How often is mention made by Moses of corn, wine, and oil; and
why? in order that God might shew that that land exceeded every other in
fertility. It was, then, an evidence of an extreme curse when the people
were compelled to beg bread here and there, while yet the abundance of
all things ought to have been sufficient to supply even aliens,

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p9"></span>“Thou shalt lend to others, but thou
shalt not borrow.” (<span id="iii.vi.vii-p9.1"></span>[De
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu015.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.vi.vii-p9.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.vii-p10"></span>They then who ought to have fed others
by their plenty, were so reduced that their want forced them to undergo
this disgrace, to beg bread of the Egyptians and Assyrians. It follows,
—

<span id="iii.vi.viii"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#007.md)<span id="iii.vi.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p2"></span>**7.** Our fathers have sinned, *and
are* not; and we have borne their iniquities.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p3"></span>**7.** Patres nostri peccarunt, non
sunt (non ipsi, ad verbum,) nos vero iniquitatem eorum portavimus.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p6"></span>The Prophet seems here to contend with
God, and to utter that blasphemy mentioned by Ezekiel. For when God
severely chastised the people, that proverb was commonly used by them,

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p7"></span>“Our fathers did eat a sour grape, and
our teeth are blunted.” (<span id="iii.vi.viii-p7.1"></span>[Eze
18:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#002.md)<span
id="iii.vi.viii-p7.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p8"></span>Thus they intimated that they were
unjustly and cruelly treated, because they suffered the punishment of
others, when they themselves were innocent. So the Prophet seems to
quarrel with God when he says that the *fathers who sinned were no
more*; but as we shall presently see, the Prophet confesses also the
sins of those who were yet alive. As, then, an ingenuous confession is
made by the Prophet, he no doubt abstained here from that blasphemy
which is so severely reproved by Ezekiel. Jeremiah had nothing farther
from his purpose than to free the people from all blame, as though God
had dealt cruelly with them, according to what is said by a heathen
poet, —

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p9"></span>*“For the sins of the fathers thou
undeservedly sufferest, O Roman!”*  <span
id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p12"></span>Another says, —

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p13"></span>*“Enough already by our blood  
Have we suffered for the perjuries of Laomedonian Troy.”*  <span
id="fr_226"></span>[227](#fn_226.md)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p16"></span>They mean that the people of their age
were wholly innocent, and seek in Asia and beyond the sea the cause of
evils, as though they never had a sin at Rome. But the meaning of
Jeremiah was not this, but he simply intended to say that the people who
had been long rebellious against God were already dead, and that it was
therefore a suitable time for God to regard the miseries of their
posterity. The faithful, then, do not allege here their own innocency
before God, as though they were blameless; but only mention that their
fathers underwent a just punishment, for that whole generation had
perished. Daniel speaks more fully when he says,

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p17"></span>“We have sinned, and our fathers, and
our kings.”  
(<span id="iii.vi.viii-p17.2"></span>[Da
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#008.md)<span
id="iii.vi.viii-p17.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p18"></span>He involved in the same condemnation
both the fathers and their children.

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p19"></span>But our Prophet’s object was
different, even to turn God to mercy, as it has been stated; and to
attain this object he says, “O Lord, thou indeed hast hitherto executed
just punishment, because our fathers had very long abused thy goodness
and forbearance; but now the time is come for thee to try and prove
whether we are like our fathers: as, then, they have perished as they
deserved, receive us now into favor.” We hence see that thus no quarrel
or contention is carried on with God, but only that the miserable exiles
ask God to look on them, since their fathers who had provoked God and
had experienced his dreadful vengeance, were already dead.  <span
id="fr_227"></span>[228](#fn_227.md)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p23"></span>And when he says that the *sons bore
the iniquity* of the fathers, though it be a strong expression, yet its
meaning is not as though God had without reason punished their children
and not their fathers; for unalterable is that declaration,

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p24"></span>“The son shall not bear the iniquity
of the father, nor the father the iniquity of the son; but the soul that
sinneth it shall die.”  
(<span id="iii.vi.viii-p24.2"></span>[Eze
18:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#020.md)<span
id="iii.vi.viii-p24.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p25"></span>It may yet be said that children are
loaded with the sins of their fathers, because God, as he declares by
Moses, extends his vengeance to the third and fourth generation. (<span
id="iii.vi.viii-p25.1"></span>[Ex
20:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.vi.viii-p25.1"></span>.) And he says also in another place,

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p26"></span>“I will return into the bosom of
children the iniquity of their fathers.”  
(<span id="iii.vi.viii-p26.2"></span>[Jer
32:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.vi.viii-p26.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.viii-p27"></span>God then continued his vengeance to
their posterity. But yet there is no doubt but that the children who had
been so severely punished, bore also the punishment of their own
iniquity, for they deserved a hundred deaths. But these two things well
agree together, that God returns the iniquity of the fathers into the
bosom of their children, and yet that the children are chastised for
their own sins.

<span id="iii.vi.ix"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:8](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#008.md)<span id="iii.vi.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p2"></span>**8.** Servants have ruled over us:
*there is* none that doth deliver *us* out of their hand.

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p3"></span>**8.** Servi dominati sunt nobis;
eripiens nemo ex manibus ipsorum (*hoc est*, nemo est qui nos eripiat e
manibus ipsorum.)

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p6"></span>Another circumstance aggravated the
calamity of the people, that they came under the power of servants,
which is more degrading than when the rich and the eminent in wealth and
power make us their servants. For it is no shame to serve a king, or at,
least a man who possesses some eminence; for that servitude which is not
apparently degrading is deemed tolerable. But when we become the
servants of servants, it is a most afflicting degradation, and most
grievously wounds our minds.

<span id="iii.vi.ix-p7"></span>It is, then, for this indignity that
Jeremiah now expostulates, and says that *servants ruled over them.*
There is, indeed, no doubt but that they were driven into exile by some
of the lowest; for the Chaldeans thought it right to exercise towards
them every kind of cruelty. But it was yet a very mournful thing for
God’s children to be the slaves of servants; for they were before a
sacerdotal kingdom, and God had so taken them under his protection, that
their condition was better and more desirable than that of any other
kingdom. As, then, they had been robbed of their liberty, and not only
so, but also made subject to servants, the change was sad in the
extreme.  <span id="fr_228"></span>[229](#fn_228.md) Therefore the Prophet
sought another occasion to plead for mercy, when he said that they were
ruled by servants. It now follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.x"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.x-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:9](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#009.md)<span id="iii.vi.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p2"></span>**9.** We gat our bread with *the peril
of* our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.

<span id="iii.vi.x-p3"></span>**9.** In anima nostra (*alii vertunt*, in
periculo vitae nostrae, *vel*, cum periculo) adduximus ad panem nostrum
ob siccitatem deserti (*alii vertunt*, a facie gladii, in deserto.)

<span id="iii.vi.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.x-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.x-p6"></span>The word <span
id="iii.vi.x-p6.1"></span>חרב, *chereb*, means drought as well as sword.
As the Prophet is speaking of famine and the desert,, I have no doubt
but that dryness or drought is *sword* the word means here; and I wonder
that the word sword had occurred to any; they could not have regarded
the context.

<span id="iii.vi.x-p7"></span>He then says that the people sought bread
with the soul, that is, at the hazard of their own life. If danger be
preferred, I do not object. But as he simply says, with the soul, he
seems to express this, that for food they hazarded their own life. Food,
indeed, is the support of life, for why is bread sought but for
sustaining life? But the hungry so rush headlong to procure food, that
they expose themselves to thousand dangers, and they also weary
themselves with many labors; and this is to seek bread with their soul,
that is, when men not only anxiously labor to procure food, but pour
forth as it were their own blood, as when one undertakes a long journey
to get some support, lie is almost lifeless when he reaches the distant
hospital. As, then, the Jews nowhere found food, the Prophet says that
they sought bread with their life, that is, at the hazard of life. This
is the view I prefer.

<span id="iii.vi.x-p8"></span>He then adds, *For the dryness of the
wilderness*. What has the sword to do with wilderness? We see that this
is wholly unsuitable; there was then no reason why interpreters should
pervert this word. But what he calls the dryness of the wilderness was
the want by which the people were distressed, as though they were in the
wilderness. This is said by way of comparison, — that on account of the
dryness of the desert, that is, on account of sterility, they were under
the necessity of exposing their life to death, only that they might
anywhere find bread.  <span id="fr_229"></span>[230](#fn_229.md)

<span id="iii.vi.x-p12"></span>It may also be, that the Prophet meant,
that they were fugitives, and thus went in hunger through woods and
forest, when they dared not to go forth into the open country lest the
enemy should meet them. But what I have said is most suitable, that is,
that they were so famished as though they were in a vast desert, and far
away from every hospital, so that bread could nowhere be found. We now,
then, perceive the meaning of the Prophet. He adds, —

<span id="iii.vi.xi-p2"></span>**10.** Our skin was black like an oven
because of the terrible famine.

<span id="iii.vi.xi-p3"></span>**10.** Pelles nostrae quasi clibanus
nigredinem contraxerunt ob exustiones famis.

<span id="iii.vi.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.xi-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xi-p6"></span>Some read, “for tremors;” literally,
“from the face of tremors.” Jerome renders it, “tempests,” but the word
“burnings” is the most suitable; for he says that their skins were
darkened, and he compares them to an oven. This metaphor often occurs in
Scripture,

<span id="iii.vi.xi-p7"></span>“Though ye have been as among pots in the
smoke, and deformed by blackness, yet your wings shall shine.” (<span
id="iii.vi.xi-p7.1"></span>[Ps
68:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xi-p7.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.xi-p8"></span>God says that his people had contracted
blackness, as though they had touched smoky pots, because they had been
burnt as it were by many afflictions; for when we pine away in our
evils, filthiness itself deforms us. But here he compares to an oven
(which is the same thing) their skins or skin. He then says that the
skin of every one was so wrinkled and darkened by blackness, that it was
like an oven which is black through constant fire and smoke. The Prophet
or whoever was the author of the 119th Psalm, uses another comparison,
that he was like a bottle or a bladder, contracted by the smoke, and had
wrinkles together with blackness.  <span
id="fr_230"></span>[231](#fn_230.md)

<span id="iii.vi.xi-p12"></span>The meaning is, that there was a
degrading deformity in the people, for they were so famished that no
moisture remained in them; and when moisture fails, then paleness and
decay follow; and then from paleness a greater deformity and blackness,
of which the Prophet now speaks. Hence I have said, that the word
“burnings” is the most proper. For, if we say tempests or storms, a
tempest does not certainly darken the skin; and if we render it tremors
or tremblings, this would be far remote; but if we adopt the word
burnings, the whole passage will appear consistent; and we know, that as
food as it were irrigates the life of man, so famine burns it up, as
Scripture speaks also elsewhere. It follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p2"></span>**11.** They ravished the women in Zion,
*and* the maids in the cities of Judah.

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p3"></span>**11.** Mulieres in Sion afflictae

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p6"></span>He mentions here another kind of
reproach, that women had been ravished in Jerusalem, and in other
cities.  <span id="fr_231"></span>[232](#fn_231.md) God had commanded
chastity to be observed among his people. When, therefore, virgins and
women were thus defiled, it was a thing extremely disgraceful. But the
Prophet mentioned this also, in order that God might at length show
himself propitious to his people after having been entreated. (<span
id="iii.vi.xii-p9.1"></span>[De
22:21-24](../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xii-p9.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p10"></span>And he mentioned *Sion* rather than
Jerusalem, — it was indeed to state a part for the whole; but that
place, we know, had been chosen by God that his name might be there
worshipped. Sion, then, was a holy place above any other; it was, in a
word, the earthly dwelling of God. As, then, God had there his palace,
that he might dwell in the midst of his people, it was a disgraceful
sight in the extreme to see women ravished there, for the temple of God
was thus violated. It was not only a thing disgraceful to the people,
that women were thus ravished, but it was a filthy profanation of God’s
worship, and therefore sacrilegious. We now see the design of the
Prophet. He mentions also the cities of Judah, but with reference to the
same thing. It follows —

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p6"></span>The beginning of the verse may be
explained in two ways. All render thus, “The princes have been slain by
their hand,” that is, of their enemies. But I wonder how it never
occurred to them, that it was far more grievous, that they were slain by
their own hand. I certainly do not doubt but that the Prophet says here,
that some of the princes had laid violent hands on themselves. For it
would be a frigid expression, that the princes were hung by the hand of
enemies; but if we read, that the princes were hung by their own hand,
this would be far more atrocious, as we have before seen that even
women, excelling in humanity, devoured their own offspring. So he says
now that princes were hung, not by enemies, for it was a common thing
for the conquered to be slain by their enemies, and be also hung by way
of reproach; but the Prophet, as it appears to me, meant to express
something more atrocious, even that the miserable princes were
constrained to lay violent hands on themselves.  <span
id="fr_232"></span>[233](#fn_232.md)

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p11"></span>He adds, that *the faces of the aged
were not honored*; which is also a thing not natural; for we know that
some honor is always rendered to old age, and that time of life is
commonly regarded with reverence. When, therefore, no respect is shown
to the aged, the greatest barbarity must necessarily prevail. It is the
same, then, as though the Prophet had said that the people had been so
disgracefully treated, that their enemies had not even spared the aged.
We also now understand why he adds this, for it would have otherwise
appeared incredible, that the princes hung themselves by their own hand.
But he here intimates that there was no escape for them, except they in
despair sought death for themselves, because all humanity had
disappeared. It follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.xvi"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xvi-p1"></span>Lecture Eighteenth

<span id="iii.vi.xvi-p2"></span>The Prophet now says, that *young men,
had been delivered to the mill,* or to the grinding-house; and we know
that of all servile works this was the lowest; for as they used asses to
grind, so also they used slaves. The meaning is, that the Jews were
shamefully treated, and were reduced to the most abject condition. I
know not how came Jerome to give this version, that they were basely
used for lust; for <span id="iii.vi.xvi-p2.1"></span>טחן, *thechen*,
means to grind or to tear. He thought that it means here something base,
which could not be named, as though the enemies had shamefully abused
the young men; but we may gather from the second clause of the verse
that such an idea does not accord with the passage.

<span id="iii.vi.xvi-p3"></span>He then says, that *young men* were
compelled to *grind*, and that *boys stumbled under the wood*. He means
that boys were loaded with wood, as drudges were wont to be; and it was
a vile work. As, then, he said previously, that the young men were
employed in grinding, so now he says that boys succumbed under the wood,
because they carried burdens on their shoulders too heavy for them,
which they were not able to bear. We now, then, apprehend what the
Prophet means. It follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.xvii"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xvii-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#014.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xvii-p2"></span>**14.** The elders have ceased from the
gate, the young men from their musick.

<span id="iii.vi.xvii-p3"></span>**14.** Senes cessarunt e porta
adolescentes a pulsatione sua (*vel*, canticis musicis.)

<span id="iii.vi.xvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.xvii-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.xvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xvii-p6"></span>Here the Prophet briefly shews that the
city was reduced to ruins, so that nothing but desolation could be seen
there. For when cities are inhabited, judges sit at the gate and young
men exercise themselves in lawful pursuits; but he says that there were
no judgments; for at that time, as it is well known, they were wont to
administer justice and to hold assemblies at the gates of cities. It was
then the same as though all civil order had been abolished.

<span id="iii.vi.xvii-p7"></span>Then he adds, the *young men had ceased
from their own beating* or musical songs. The meaning is, that there was
so great a desolation in the city, that, it was no more a city. For men
cannot dwell together without laws and without courts of justice. Where
courts of justice are closed up, where laws are mute, where no equity is
administered, there barbarity prevails, which is worse than solitude;
and where there are no assemblies for legitimate amusements, life
becomes brutal, for we know that man is a sociable being. By these
words, then, the Prophet shews that a dreadful desolation appeared in
the city after the people had gone into exile. And among the Chaldeans,
and in Assyria, they had not their own judges nor any form of
government, for they were dispersed and scattered, and that designedly,
that they might not unite together any more; for it was the purpose of
the Chaldeans to obliterate by degrees the very name of the people; and
hence they were not there formed into a community. So justly does the
Prophet deplore their desolation even in exile. It follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.xviii"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.xviii-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xviii-p6"></span>He pursues the same subject, but he
seems more clearly to explain what he had briefly stated in the
preceding verse, when he says that *all joy of the heart had ceased, and
that all the dances were turned into mourning*  <span
id="fr_233"></span>[234](#fn_233.md) We know that life is more bitter than
death when men are in constant mourning; and truly where there is no
hilarity, that state of life is worse than death. And this is what the
Prophet now means by saying that all joy had ceased, and that all dances
were converted into mourning.

<span id="iii.vi.xix"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xix-p2"></span>**16.** The crown is fallen *from* our
head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!

<span id="iii.vi.xix-p3"></span>**16.** Cecidit corona capitis nostri;
vae nunc nobis, quia peccavimus.

<span id="iii.vi.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.xix-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xix-p6"></span>By the crown of the head he no doubt
understands all those ornaments by which that people had been adorned.
They had a kingdom and a priesthood, which were like two luminaries or
two precious jewels; they had also other things by which the Lord had
adorned them. As, then, they were endued with such excellent things,
they are said to have borne a *crown on their head* But a crown was not
only taken for a diadem, — it was also a symbol of joy and of honor; for
not only kings then wore crowns, but men were crowned at weddings and
feasts, at games also, and theatres. The Prophet, in a word, complains,
that though many ornaments did belong to the people, yet now they were
denuded of them all: *The crown*, he says, *has fallen from our head*
 <span id="fr_234"></span>[235](#fn_234.md)

<span id="iii.vi.xix-p12"></span>He then exclaims, *Woe to us now, for
we have sinned!* Here he sets forth an extreme misery, and at the same
time shews that all hope of restoration was taken away. He, however,
mentions the cause, *because they had done wickedly* By saying this he
did not intend to exasperate their sorrow, so that they who were thus
afflicted might murmur against God; but, on the contrary, his object was
to humble the afflicted, so that they might perceive that they were
justly punished. It is the same as though he had summoned them as guilty
before the tribunal of God, and pronounced in one word that they justly
suffered or sustained so grievous a punishment; for a just God is an
avenger of wickedness.

<span id="iii.vi.xix-p13"></span>We hence conclude, that when he said
yesterday that the fathers who had sinned were dead, and their iniquity
was borne by their children, he did not so speak as to exempt the living
from all blame; for here he condemns them and includes himself in the
number. But I explained yesterday the meaning of that verse; and here
the Prophet ingenuously confesses that the people were justly punished,
because they had by their sins provoked the wrath of God. And this
doctrine ought to be carefully observed; because when we are pressed
down by adversities, Satan will excite us to sorrow, and at the same
time hurry us on to rage, except this doctrine comes to our minds, that
we have to do with God, who is a righteous Judge. For the knowledge of
our sins will tame our pride and also check all those clamorous
complaints, which the unbelieving are wont to utter when they rise up
against God. Our evils, then, ought to lead us to consider God’s
judgment and to confess our sins; and this was the end which our Prophet
had in view. It follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.xx"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xx-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.xx-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:17](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#017.md)<span id="iii.vi.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xx-p2"></span>**17.** For this our heart is faint; for
these *things* our eyes are dim.

<span id="iii.vi.xx-p3"></span>**17.** Propterea debile est cor nostrum;
super hoc (*id est*, propter hane causem) obtenebrati sunt oculi nostri.

<span id="iii.vi.xx-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.xx-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.xx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xx-p6"></span>He connects sorrow here with the
acknowledgment of sin, that the people under the pressure and agony of
sorrow might apply their minds so as to consider their own sins. At the
same time the Prophet, no doubt, includes here all that we have already
observed, as though he had said that the people were not without reason
wearied with sorrow, for they had ample and manifold reasons for their
grief.

<span id="iii.vi.xx-p7"></span>For this reason, he says, that is, we do
not exceed a due measure in our sorrow, for our afflictions are not
ordinary, so that our grief cannot be moderate; but as we are come to an
extremity, it cannot then be but our minds should be overwhelmed with
sorrow. As, then, the curse of God appeared everywhere, he says that
this was the cause of the fainting heart; and he says also, Therefore
were our eyes darkened. This is a common metaphor, that the eyes become
dim through sorrow; for the senses through sorrow are blunted. Hence it
is that the sight of the eyes is injured; and David especially makes use
of this mode of speaking. Our Prophet then says that the eyes were
darkened, because their grief was, as it were, deadly. It follows —

<span id="iii.vi.xxi"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p1"></span><span

which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p3"></span>**18.** Propter montem Sion qui in

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.xxi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p6"></span>Though he had in general included all
kinds of evils, he yet mentions now the principal cause of sorrow, that
*mount* Sion had lost its beauty and its excellency. For that place had
been chosen by God, as though he had descended there from heaven, that
he might dwell there; and we know also that its beauty is spoken of in
high terms. For there the face of God shone forth, as Moses and the
Prophets often speak. It was then an extremely sad change, that as God
had dwelt in mount Sion, foxes should lodge there as in a deserted cave.
For on mount Sion was the tabernacle or the sanctuary; and God says that
it was the tabernacle of meeting, <span
id="iii.vi.xxi-p6.1"></span>מועד, *moud*, because there he wished to
hold intercourse with his people. As, then, that place included God and
his Church, it was, as I have said, a dreadful and monstrous thing, that
it had become so desolate, that foxes succeeded in the place of God and
the faithful. It was not, then, without reason that Jeremiah, after
having spoken of so many and so bitter calamities, mentioned this as the
chief, that *mount Sion was reduced to desolation, so that foxes ran
there hither and thither*  <span id="fr_235"></span>[236](#fn_235.md)

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p17"></span>For as it is the principal thing, and
as it were the chief of all blessings, to be counted God’s people, and
to have a familiar access to him, so in adversities nothing is so sad as
to be deprived of God’s presence. When David testified his gratitude to
God, because he had been enriched by every kind of blessing, he added
this,

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p18"></span>“I shall dwell in the house of God.”
(<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p18.1"></span>[Ps
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xxi-p18.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p19"></span>For though he had spoken of wealth and
riches and of the abundance of all things, yet he saw that his chief
happiness was to call on God together with the faithful, and to be
deemed one of his people. So, also, on the other hand, the Prophet here
shews that nothing can be sadder to the godly than when God leaves his
dwelling and makes it desolate, in order to terrify all who may see it.

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p20"></span>This had been predicted to them by
Jeremiah himself, as we have seen in the seventh chapter of his
prophecies, “Go ye to Shiloh,” he said, where the ark of the covenant
had long been; though that place had been a long time the habitation of
God, yet it was afterwards rejected with great disdain. Jeremiah then
declared to the Jews, while they were yet in safety, that such would be
the condition of Jerusalem; but his prophecy was not believed. He now,
then, confirms, by the event, what he had predicted by God’s command,
when he says that mount Sion was become the den of foxes. It follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.xxii"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p1"></span><span

id="iii.vi.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p2"></span>**19.** Thou, O LORD, remainest for
ever; thy throne from generation to generation.

<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p3"></span>**19.** Tu Jehova perpetuo sedebis,
solium tuum in aetatem et aetatem (id est, omnibus seculis.)

<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.xxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p6"></span>The Prophet here raises up his eyes to
God, and, by his example, he encourages all the godly, that they might
not cease, notwithstanding their extreme calamities, to look to God, as
we find in the hundred and second Psalm, where the Psalmist speaks of
the destruction of the city of Jerusalem. Indeed the subject of that
psalm is similar to that of this chapter; nor is there a doubt but that
it was composed when the people, as it clearly appears, were in exile in
Babylon. There the Psalmist, after having spoken of the ruin of the
city, and calamities of the people, says, that the heavens were growing
old and wasting as it were with rottenness, together with the whole
world; but he afterwards adds,

<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p7"></span>“But thou, O Lord, remainest
perpetually.”  
(<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p7.2"></span>[Ps
102:26-28](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xxii-p7.2"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p8"></span>At the same time he speaks more clearly
than Jeremiah, for he applies his doctrine to the consolation of the
Church, “Children’s children,” he says, “shall inhabit it.” Hence, from
the perpetuity and immutability of God, he infers the perpetuity of the
Church. This is not done by Jeremiah, though it is implied; and for this
reason, no doubt, he exclaims, that *God dwells for ever,* and that *his
throne remains fixed in all ages,* or through all ages.

<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p9"></span>For when we fix our eyes on present
things, we must necessarily vacillate, as there is nothing permanent hi
the world; and when adversities bring a cloud over our eyes, then faith
in a manner vanishes, at least we are troubled and stand amazed. Now the
remedy is, to raise up our eyes to God, for however confounded things
may be in the world, yet he remains always the same. His truth may
indeed be hidden from us, yet it remains in him. In short, were the
world to change and perish a hundred times, nothing could ever affect
the immutability of God. There is, then, no doubt but that the Prophet
wished to take courage and to raise himself up to a firm hope, when he
exclaimed, “Thou, O God, remainest for ever.” By the word sitting or
remaining, he doubtless meant that the world is governed by God. We know
that God has no body, but the word sitting is to be taken
metaphorically, for He is no God except he be the judge of the world.

<span id="iii.vi.xxii-p10"></span>This, also, he expresses more clearly,
when he says, that God’s throne remains through all ages. The throne of
God designates the government of the world. But if God be the judge of
the world, then he doeth nothing,, or suffereth nothing to be done, but
according to his supreme wisdom and justice.  <span
id="fr_236"></span>[237](#fn_236.md) We hence see, that inasmuch as the
state of present things, as thick darkness, took away all distinction,
the Prophet raises up his eyes to God and acknowledges him as remaining
the same perpetually, though things in the world continually change.
Then the throne of God is set in opposition to chance or uncertain
changes which ungodly men dream of; for when they see things in great
confusion in the world, they say that it is the wheel of fortune, they
say that all things happen through blind fate. Then the Prophet, that he
might not be cast down with the unbelieving, refers to the throne of
God, and strengthens himself in this doctrine of true religion, — that
God nevertheless sits on this throne, though things are thus confounded,
though all things fluctuate; yea, even though storms and tempests mingle
as it were heaven and earth together, yet God sits on his throne amidst
all such disturbances. However turbulent, then, all the elements may be,
this derogates nothing from the righteous and perpetual judgment of God.
This is the meaning of the words; and hence fruit and benefit may be
easily gathered. It. follows, —

and submit to God’s scourges, do yet familiarly deposit their complaints
in his bosom, and thus unburden themselves. We see that David prayed,
and no doubt by the real impulse of the Spirit, and at the same time
expostulated,

<span id="iii.vi.xxiii-p7"></span>“Why dost thou forget me perpetually?”
(<span id="iii.vi.xxiii-p7.1"></span>[Ps
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa013.htm#001.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xxiii-p7.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.xxiii-p8"></span>Nor is there a doubt but that the
Prophet took this complaint from David. Let us, then, know, that though
the faithful sometimes take this liberty of expostulating with God, they
yet do not put off reverence, modesty, submission, or humility. For when
the Prophet thus inquired why God should for ever forget his people and
forsake them, he no doubt relied on his own prophecies, which he knew
had proceeded from God, and thus he deferred his hope until the end of
the seventy years, for that time had been prefixed by God. But it was
according to human judgment that he complained in his own person, and in
that of the faithful, that the affliction was long; nor is there a doubt
but that he dictated this form of prayer to the faithful, that k might
be retained after his death. He, then, formed this prayer, not only
according to his own feeling, and for the direction to those of his own
age; but his purpose was to supply the faithful with a prayer after his
own death, so that they might flee to the mercy of God.

<span id="iii.vi.xxiii-p9"></span>We now, then, perceive how complaints
of this kind ought to be understood, when the prophets asked, “How
long?” as though they stimulated God to hasten the time; for it cannot
be, when we are pressed down by many evils, but that we wish help to be
accelerated; for faith does not wholly strip us of all cares and
anxieties. But when we thus pray, let us remember that our times are at
the will and in the hand of God, and that we ought not to hasten too
much. It is, then, lawful for us on the one hand to ask God to hasten;
but, on the other hand, we ought to check our impatience and wait until
the suitable time comes. Both these things the Prophet no doubt joined
together when he said, *Why shouldest thou, perpetually forget us and
forsake us?*  <span id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md)

<span id="iii.vi.xxiii-p13"></span>We yet see that he judged according
to the evils then endured; and doubtless he believed that God had not
forsaken his own people nor forgotten them, as no oblivion can happen to
him. But, as I have already said, the Prophet mentioned these complaints
through human infirmity, not that men might indulge themselves in their
own thoughts, but that they might ascend by degrees to God and overcome
all these temptations. It follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#021.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p2"></span>**21.** Turn thou us unto tee, O LORD,
and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p3"></span>**21.** Converte nos, Jehova ad te et
convertimur: innova (*vel*, instaura) dies nostros sicuti olim (*vel*,
ab initio.)

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p6"></span>The Prophet shews, in this verse, that
the remedy is in God’s hand whenever he is pleased to succor his people.
He, then, exalts here the power of God, as though he had said, that God
is not without power, but that he can, whenever he pleases, help his
people. This is not, indeed, a sufficient ground for confidence, yet it
is the beginning of hope; for whence is it that despair weakens us, so
that we cannot call on God? because we think that it is all over with
us; and whence is this? because we impiously confine the power of God;
nay, we in a manner, through our unbelief, repel his power, which would
otherwise be exerted in our behalf. As, then, we thus close the door
against God, when we extenuate his power, and think that our evils will
prevail; it is, therefore, as I have said, the beginning of hope to
believe that all the issues of death are in God’s hand, and that were we
a hundred times swallowed up, yet he, by stretching forth his hand to
us, can become the author of salvation to us at any moment.

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p7"></span>This is now the argument which the
Prophet handles, when he says, Turn us, O Jehovah, and we shall be
turned; that is, “If thou, O Jehovah, be pleased to gather us, salvation
is already certain to us.” And he does not speak here of repentance.
There is, indeed, a twofold turning or conversion of men to God, and a
twofold turning of God to men. There is all inward turning when God
regenerates us by his own Spirit; and turning with respect to us is said
to be the feeling of true religion, when, after having been alienated
from him, we return to the right way and to a fight mind. There is also
all exterior turning as to God, that is, when he so receives men into
favor, that his paternal favor becomes apparent; but the interior
turning of men to God takes place when they recover life and joy.

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p8"></span>Of this second turning, then, does the
Prophet now speak, Turn us, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned; that is,
If thou, Jehovah, lookest on us, our condition will immediately become
prosperous, for in thy hand there is a sure salvation for us.” As, then,
the Jews were at that time like the dead, the Prophet says, that if it
pleased God to gather them, they could in a moment, as they say, have
been restored, as it is said also in the Psalms,

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p9"></span>“Thou takest away life, and all things
change; send forth thy Spirit, and renew the face of the earth.” (<span
id="iii.vi.xxiv-p9.1"></span>[Ps.
104:29](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#029.md),
[30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#030.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xxiv-p9.1"></span>.)

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p10"></span>As, then, God renews the face of the
earth and restores it by only looking at it, hence now the Prophet says,
that the Jews, though they had been destroyed, could yet be immediately
restored, if it were the will of God to receive them into favor.  <span
id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md)

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p16"></span>He adds, *Renew our days as of old*.
This is an explanation of the former clause — the renewing of days was
restoration to their former state. God had been for many ages the
deliverer of his people; under David had been their greatest happiness;
under Solomon also they had greatly flourished; but from the time when
God had redeemed his people, he had given, as we know, many and constant
proofs of his favor and mercy. As, then, God’s goodness had, by so many
evidences been made conspicuous, the Prophet now says, *Renew our days
as formerly,* that is, “Restore us to that happiness, which was formerly
a testimony of thy paternal favor towards thy people.” We now then
perceive the meaning of the Prophet.

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p17"></span>But it ought to be noticed, that he
grounds his hope on the ancient benefits of God; for as God had formerly
redeemed his people, had often helped the miserable, had poured forth on
them, posterity fullness of blessings, hence the Prophet encourages
himself to entertain good hope, and suggests also to others the same
ground of confidence. We see that this was done often by David; for
whenever he mentions ancient testimonies of God’s favor towards his
people, he hence gathered, that God would extend the same goodness and
kindness to posterity. It follows, —

<span id="iii.vi.xxv"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p1"></span><span
id="iii.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>[Lamentations
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/lam005.htm#022.md)<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p2"></span>**22.** But thou hast utterly rejected
us; thou art very wroth against us.

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p3"></span>**22.** Nisi (*vel*, sed, *vel*, quod
si) rejiciendo rejecisti nos excanduisti contra nos valde.

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p4"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p5"></span><span id="iii.vi.xxv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p6"></span>The two words <span
id="iii.vi.xxv-p6.1"></span>כי אם, *ki am,* are differently explained:
some render them, “but if,” or “certainly if,” and thus separate the
verse into two parts, “Surely if thou hast rejected us, thou art very
angry;” but this is a forced meaning, not intended, as I think, by the
Prophet. And these seem to have been compelled by necessity to pervert
the Prophet’s words; because it appears hard simply to declare that the
people had been wholly rejected by God. As, then, this harshness
offended them, they contrived this comment, “If thou hast rejected us,
thou art very angry.” But as I have said, this exposition I do not
approve of, because it is a very forced one; and the greater part of
interpreters follow what I stated in the first place, for they take
<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p6.2"></span>כי אם, *ki* *am*, adversatively. The
two particles are often connected together, and rendered, “though” or
although, — “Though thou hast rejected us:” and hence the last verse has
been repeated.

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p7"></span>For the Jews labor under this
superstition, that when a book ends with a hard and severe sentence, or
one containing a dreadful threatening, grating to the ears, in order to
avoid the sad omen, they repeat the last verse but one. So they do at
the end of Isaiah, and at the end of Malachi. As Isaiah says, “It shall
be a horror (or abomination) to all flesh;” they therefore repeat the
previous verse. So in Malachi; as he says, “Lest I come and smite the
earth with a curse — <span id="iii.vi.xxv-p7.1"></span>חרם, *cherem*,”
they think that as he pronounces there an anathema, it is a sort of
charm that may absorb this curse, to have the previous verse repeated
after it. There is, then, no doubt but that they took this passage in
the same sense, “Though thou hast rejected us,” etc.

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p8"></span>If this explanation be approved, we must
hold that the Prophet here exceeded due limits, as also the faithful, in
their prayers, do not always so restrain themselves, but that some heat
bubbles up; for we see how David, in the Psalms, too often shewed this
kind of feeling; and it is hence evident, that his mind was not always
sufficiently calm. We must then say, that the Prophet was impelled by a
turbulent feeling when he uttered these words.

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p9"></span>But <span id="iii.vi.xxv-p9.1"></span>כי
אם, *ki* *am*, may also be rendered, “Unless,” or except’ and it is
singular that no one has perceived this, though it be not an unsuitable
meaning, “Except it may be thou rejecting hast rejected us, and hast
become very angry with us,” or above measure angry; for <span
id="iii.vi.xxv-p9.2"></span>עד מאד, *od mad* in Hebrew, means the same
as above measure (*supra* *modum*) in Latin. Though the Prophet seems to
speak doubtingly, by laying down t, his condition, there is vet no doubt
but that he struggled against all unbelief, when he said, *Except it may
be;* for he reasons from what is impossible, “Turn thou us to thee and
we shall be turned, renew our days as formerly; *except it may be thou
hast rejected us:”* but this was impossible. Then, as I have said, the
Prophet here strengthens himself by setting up a shield against all the
assaults of temptations when he says, *Except it may be thou hast
rejected us*  <span id="fr_239"></span>[240](#fn_239.md)

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p16"></span>But it cannot be that God will reject
his people, and be so angry with them, as never to be reconciled. We
hence see that the Prophet does not simply set down the condition, as
though he said, “O God, if thou art to be perpetually angry with us, and
wilt never be reconciled, it is there all over with our salvation; but
if thou wilt be reconciled to us, we shall then entertain good hope.”
No, the Prophet did not thus keep his own mind and the minds of others
in suspense, but had a sure confidence as to God’s favor; for it cannot
be that God will ever forsake those whom he has chosen, as Paul also
shews in the eleventh chapter of the Epistle to the Romans.

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p17"></span>As it has so seemed good to the
brethren, I will begin tomorrow the explanation of Ezekiel.

<span id="iii.vi.xxvi"></span>

<span id="iii.vi.xxvi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="iii.vi.xxvi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou didst
formerly execute judgments so severe on thy people, — O grant, that
these chastisements may at this day teach us to fear thy name, and also
keep us in watchfulness and humility, and that we may so strive to
pursue the course of our calling, that we may find that thou art always
our leader, that thy hand is stretched forth to us, that thy aid is ever
ready for us, until, being at length gathered into thy celestial
kingdom, we shall enjoy that eternal life, which thine only-begotten Son
has obtained for us by his own blood. — Amen.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p8"></span> Not one of the versions or the Targ*.,*
though they all differ, gives a satisfactory rendering of this clause.
Some take, “on our neck we have been pursued,” as meaning, We have been
closely pursued. So *Gataker.* Others, as *Lowth* and *Henderson,*
regarding <span id="iii.vi.vi-p8.1"></span>על a noun, signifying a yoke,
give a construction of this kind, “With the yoke on our neck we have
been pursued” or persecuted*,* according to the words of Moses in <span
id="iii.vi.vi-p8.2"></span>[De
28:48](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#048.md)<span
id="iii.vi.vi-p8.2"></span>. The former seems the best, —

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p9"></span>On our neck (closely) have we been
pursued,  
We labored and had no rest.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p10"></span>Then comes in what they did when thus

To Assyria, to be satisfied with bread.

<span id="iii.vi.vi-p12"></span>To give the hand, in this case, was to

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p7"></span> There is here a delicate word for a
disgraceful act. The words literally are, —

<span id="iii.vi.xii-p8"></span>Women in Sion they humbled (or, were

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p7"></span> The most obvious meaning of the words
is, that princes were hung or suspended by the hand, and not by the
neck. Such a punishment is not recorded as having *been* then practiced;
but it may have been a barbarity resorted to by the Chaldeans. This
seems to be the meaning conveyed by the versions and the *Targ.,* —

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p8"></span> 

<span id="iii.vi.xiii-p9"></span>Princes were by their hand hung up,  
The persons of the aged were not honored.

declarative, —

<span id="iii.vi.xix-p10"></span>Woe *is* now to us, because we have

For these things darkened were our eyes,

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p10"></span>**18.** *Yea,* for mount Sion, which is
desolate;  
Foxes have walked through it.

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p11"></span>“This” was the “woe” which sin had
brought; and “these things” were the various things which he had
previously stated, but the desolation of mount Sion was the chief cause
of sorrow.

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p12"></span>Others take this verse by itself, as it
is done by the *Sept.,* where <span id="iii.vi.xxi-p12.1"></span>על is
rendered *“on,”* and <span id="iii.vi.xxi-p12.2"></span>ש for <span

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p13"></span>On mount Sion, because it has become
desolate,

<span id="iii.vi.xxi-p14"></span>If <span
id="iii.vi.xxi-p14.1"></span>על be rendered concerning, or, as to, or,

<span id="iii.vi.xxiii-p12"></span>“To the end,” or perpetually, and

appears from <span id="iii.vi.xxiii-p12.1"></span>[Ps
23:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#006.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xxiii-p12.1"></span>, means the extent of the present life;
the phrase is there used as synonymous with all the days of one’s life.
Might not the Prophet here refer to the life of those then living? As to
restoration after seventy years, he could have had no doubt. He seems to
have pleaded for the restoration of the generation then living. — *Ed*.

that we may be restored.

<span id="iii.vi.xxiv-p13"></span>And as *Calvin,* as well as *Grotius,*

id="iii.vi.xxv-p10.1"></span>כי אם, seem to have the meaning of
“except,” as in <span id="iii.vi.xxv-p10.2"></span>[Ge
32:26](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#026.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xxv-p10.2"></span>, “except thou bless me.” But the
exposition is too refined. The usual meaning of the particles is, *but
in truth, for surely, when indeed.* See <span
id="iii.vi.xxv-p10.3"></span>[1Sa
21:5](../../../bib/kjv/sa1021.htm#005.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xxv-p10.3"></span>; <span id="iii.vi.xxv-p10.4"></span>[Pr
23:18](../../../bib/kjv/pro023.htm#018.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xxv-p10.4"></span>; <span id="iii.vi.xxv-p10.5"></span>[Ex
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#023.md)<span
id="iii.vi.xxv-p10.5"></span>. They are rendered here, “for,” by the
*Sept., Syr.,* and *Arab;* “but,” by the *Vulg*., and “although,” by the
*Targ.* The version of *Blayney* and *Henderson* is, “For surely.” The
Prophet assigns a reason for his petition in the preceding verse; as
though he had said, “I ask for restoration to thy favor and to our land,
because thou hast clearly manifested thy rejection of us, and thy
displeasure towards us.”

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p11"></span>For surely rejecting thou hast rejected
us,  
Thou hast been wroth with us exceedingly,

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p12"></span>or, more literally,

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p13"></span>Thou hast foamed against us
exceedingly.

<span id="iii.vi.xxv-p14"></span>The first line here corresponds with
the latter part of the previous verse, “Restore us to our land, and
renew the ancient days,” — “Thou hast wholly rejected us.” He speaks of
things as they were then. Then the last line in this verse bears a
relation to the first part of the preceding verse, “Restore us to thy
favor,” — “Thou hast been exceedingly displeased with us.” Thus, for
displeasure he asked favor, and for repudiation, a restoration. — *Ed*.
