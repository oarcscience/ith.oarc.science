<span id="ii.iii.ii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#001.md)<span id="ii.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p2"></span>**1**. The word that the LORD spake
against Babylon, *and* against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the
prophet.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p3"></span>**1**. Sermo quem loquutus est Jehova
super Babylone, super terra Chaldaeorum, in manu Jeremiae prophetae.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p6"></span>Our Prophet has been hitherto speaking of
neighboring nations who had cruelly harassed the chosen people; and it
was some consolation when the children of Abraham understood that God
undertook their cause and would be the avenger of those wrongs which
they had suffered. But this of itself would have been no great
consolation, yea, it might have been viewed as nothing by many, while
there was no hope of restoration; for it would have been but a small
consolation to have others as associates in misery. If, indeed, Jeremiah
had only taught that none of the nations who had troubled God’s Church
would escape unpunished, the Jews might have raised an objection, and
said, that they were not freed from their own calamities, because the
monarchy of Babylon still flourished, and that they were buried as it
were in a perpetual grave. It was therefore necessary that what we read
here should be predicted. And though this prophecy is given last, we
ought to notice that the Prophet had from the beginning expressly
spoken, as we have seen, of the calamity and destruction of Babylon. But
this prophecy is given as the conclusion of the book, to mitigate the
sorrow of the miserable exiles; for it was no small relief to them to
hear that the tyranny by which they were oppressed, and under which they
did live as it were a lifeless life, would not be perpetual. We now then
understand why the Prophet spoke of the Babylonians and of their
destruction.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p7"></span>But a longer preface would be
superfluous, because those acquainted with Scripture well know that the
Jews were at length so reduced by the Babylonians that their very name
seemed to have been obliterated. As then they were reduced to such
extremities, it is no wonder that the Prophet here affirms that the
Babylonians would be at length punished, and that not only that God
might show himself to be the avenger of wickedness, but also that the
miserable exiles might know that they were not wholly repudiated, but on
the contrary that God had a care for their salvation. We now perceive
the design of this prophecy.

<span id="ii.iii.ii-p8"></span>*The word of Jehovah*, he says, *which he
spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by the
hand of Jeremiah the Prophet* He testifies in his usual manner that he
did not bring forward what he himself had invented, but that God was the
author of this prophecy. He at the same time declares that he was God’s
minister; for God did not descend from heaven whenever it pleased him to
reveal his favor to the Jews, but, as it is said in Deuteronomy, he was
wont to speak by his servants. (<span id="ii.iii.ii-p8.1"></span>[De
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.iii.ii-p8.1"></span>.) In short, Jeremiah thus recommends the
things he was about to say, that the Jews might reverently receive them,
not as the fictions of men, but as oracles from heaven. It follows —

<span id="ii.iii.iii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#002.md)<span id="ii.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p2"></span>**2**. Declare ye among the nations, and
publish, and set up a standard; publish, *and* conceal not: say, Babylon
is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are
confounded, her images are broken in pieces.

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p3"></span>**2**. Nuntiate in gentibus, audire
facite (*hoc est*, promulgate,) et tollite signum, promulgate, ne
taceatis (*ad verbum*, ne occultetis,) dicite, Capta est Babylon,
pudefactus est Bel, contritus est Merodach, pudefacta sunt simulachra
ejus, contrita sunt idola ejus.

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p6"></span>He predicts the ruin of Babylon, not in
simple words, for nothing seemed then more unreasonable than to announce
the things which God at length proved by the effect. As Babylon was then
the metropolis of the East, no one could have thought that it would ever
be possessed by a foreign power. No one could have thought of the
Persians, for they were far off. As to the Medes, who were nearer, they
were, as we know, sunk in their own luxuries, and were deemed but half
men. As then there was so much effeminacy in the Medes, and as the
Persians were so far off and inclosed in their own mountains, Babylon
peaceably enjoyed the empire of the whole eastern world. This, then, is
the reason why the Prophet expresses at large what he might have set
forth in a very few words.

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p7"></span>*Tell*, he says, *among the nations,
publish, raise up a sign*, and again, *publish* To what purpose is such
a heap of words? even that the faithful might learn to raise up their
thoughts above the world, and to look for that which was then, according
to the judgment of all, incredible. This confidence shews that Jeremiah
did not, in vain, foretell what he states; but he thundered as it were
from heaven, knowing whence he derived this prophecy. And his
proclamation was this, *Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, and
Merodach is broken* I know not why some think that Merodach was an idol:
for as to Bel, we know that the Babylonians trusted in that god, or
rather in that figment. But the Prophet mentions here evidently the name
of a king well known to the Jews, in order to show that Babylon, with
all its defences and its wealth, was already devoted to destruction: for
we know that men look partly to some god, and partly to human or
temporal means. So the Babylonians boasted that they were under the
protection of Bel, and dared proudly to set up this idol in opposition
to the only true God, as the unbelieving do; and then in the second
place, they were inebriated with confidence in their own power: and
hypocrisy ever rules in the unbelieving, so that they arrogate to
themselves much more than what they ascribe to their idols. It is then
the same thing as though he had said, that Babylon was taken, that Bel
was confounded, and that the kingdom was broken, or broken in pieces.
 <span id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md)

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p11"></span>The name *Merodach*, as I have said,
was well known among the Jews, and mention is made of a father and of a
son of this name, by Isaiah and in sacred history. (<span
id="ii.iii.iii-p11.1"></span>[Isa
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa039.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iii-p11.1"></span>; <span id="ii.iii.iii-p11.2"></span>[2Ki
20:12](../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.iii.iii-p11.2"></span>.) It is no wonder, then, that the Prophet
should name this king, though dead, on account of the esteem in which he
was held, as we have seen in the case of the kingdom of Syria, he
mentioned Ben-hadad, though no one supposes that he was then alive; but
as Ben-hadad distinguished himself above other kings of Syria, the
Prophet introduced his name. For the same reason, in my opinion, he
names Merodach here.

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p12"></span>The sum of the whole is, that though
Babylon thought itself safe and secure through the help of its idol, and
also through its wealth and warlike power, and through other defences,
yet its confidence would become vain and empty, for God would bring to
shame its idol and destroy its king. He again returned to the idols, and
not without reason; for he thus called the attention of his own nation
to the only true God, and also reminded them how detestable was the
idolatry which then prevailed among the Chaldeans. And it was necessary
to set this doctrine before the Jews, and to impress it on them, that
they might not abandon themselves to the superstitions of heathens, as
it happened. But the Prophet designedly spoke of images and idols, that
the Jews might know that it was the only true God who had adopted them,
and that thus they might acquiesce in his power, and know that those
were only vain fictions which were much made of through the whole world
by the heathens and unbelieving. It now follows —

<span id="ii.iii.iv"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#003.md)<span id="ii.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p2"></span>**3**. For out of the north there cometh
up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none
shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and
beast.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p3"></span>**3**. Quoniam ascendet contra eam gens
ab aquilone, quae ponet terram in vastitatem, et (ut) non sit habitator
in ea ab homine usque ad bestiam; fugerunt, abierunt.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p6"></span>Let what I have before said be borne in
mind, that the Prophet makes use of many words in describing the ruin of
Babylon; for it was not enough to predict what was to be; but as weak
minds vacillated, it was necessary to add a confirmation. After having
then spoken of the power of Babylon and its idols, he now points out the
way in which it was to be destroyed — a nation would come from the
north, that is, with reference to Chaldea. And he means the Medes and
Persians, as interpreters commonly think; and this is probable, because
he afterwards adds that the Jews would then return. As then Jeremiah
connects these two things together, the destruction of Babylon and the
restoration of God’s Church, it is probable that he refers here to the
Medes and Persians. If, at the same time, we more narrowly view things,
there is no doubt but that this prophecy extends further, and this will
appear more evident as we proceed.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p7"></span>He simply says now that a *nation* would
*come from the north*, which would *turn the land to a waste* This
clause shews that this prophecy could not be fitly confined to the time
when Babylon was taken by Cyrus; for we know that it was betrayed by two
Satraps during a siege; and that it was at a time when a feast was held,
as though there was peace and security, as Daniel testifies, with whom
heathen writers agree. Now Xenophon testifies that Cyrus exercised great
forbearance and humanity, and that he used his victory with such
moderation, that Babylon seemed as though it had not been taken. It had,
indeed, changed masters, but such was the change that the citizens
readily submitted to it. But it was afterwards more hardly dealt with,
when Darius recovered it by the aid of Zopyrus; for Babylon had revolted
from the Persians, and shook off the yoke. Darius having in vain stormed
it, at length recovered it by the help of one man; for Zopyrus, having
cut off his nose, and mutilated his ears and his face, pretended, in
this deformed manner, to be a fugitive, and complained of the cruelty
and barbarity of his king, with whom yet he was most intimate. The city
was soon afterwards taken by treachery in the night. Then about four
thousand of the Persians were hung in the middle of the Forum, nor did
Darius spare the people. The Prophet then seems to include this second
destruction when he predicted that the whole land would be made
desolate. Nor ought this to be deemed unreasonable, for the Prophets so
spoke of God’s judgments, that they extended what they said further than
to the commencement, as was the case in the present instance.

<span id="ii.iii.iv-p8"></span>When, therefore, Babylon was taken by the
Persians, it received the yoke; and she which ruled over all other
nations, was reduced to a state of servitude. For the Persians, as it is
well known, were very inhuman, and Isaiah describes them so at large. In
the meantime, the city, as I have said, retained its external
appearance. The citizens were robbed of their gold and silver, and of
their precious things, and were under the necessity of serving
strangers: this was bitter to them. But when Darius punished their
perfidy and hung so many of the chief men, about four thousand, and also
shed indiscriminately the blood of the people, and subjected the city
itself to the plunder of his soldiers, then doubtless what the Prophet
says here was more fully accomplished. It was yet God’s purpose to give
only a prelude of his vengeance, when he made the Babylonians subject to
the Medes and Persians. It now follows —

<span id="ii.iii.v"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.v-p1"></span><span id="ii.iii.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#004.md)<span id="ii.iii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.v-p2"></span>**4**. In those days, and in that time,
saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children
of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD
their God.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p3"></span>**4**. Diebus illis et tempore illo (*sed*
<span id="ii.iii.v-p3.1"></span>עת *proprie significat condictum aut
proefixum tempus*,) dicit Jehova, venient filii Israel ipsi, et filii
Jehudah simul, eundo et flendo venient, et Jehovam *Deum* suum quaerent.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.v-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.v-p6"></span>The Prophet now explains more clearly the
purpose of God, that in punishing so severely the Chaldeans, his object
was to provide for the safety of his Church. For had Jeremiah spoken
only of vengeance, the Jews might have still raised an objection and
said, “It will not profit us at all, that God should be a severe judge
towards our enemies, if we are to remain under their tyranny.” Then the
Prophet shews that the destruction of Babylon would be connected with
the deliverance of the chosen people; and thus he points out, as it were
by the finger, the reason why Babylon was to be destroyed, even for the
sake of the chosen people, so that the miserable exiles may take
courage, and not doubt but that God would at length be propitious, as
Jeremiah had testified to them, having, as we have seen, prefixed the
term of seventy years. He was derided by the Jews, who had so habituated
themselves to hardness of heart, that they counted as nothing, or at
least regarded as fables, all the reproofs and threatenings of God, and
also gave heed, as we have seen, to the flatteries of the false
prophets.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p7"></span>Jeremiah now promises that God would be
their liberator after the time of exile had passed, of which he had
spoken. Thus we perceive the design of this passage, in which the
Prophet, after having referred to the destruction of Babylon, makes a
sudden transition, and refers to God’s mercy, which he would show to the
Jews after they had suffered a just punishment: *In those days*, he
says, *and at that time* — he adds the appointed time, that the Jews
might not doubt but that the Chaldeans would be subdued, because God had
appointed them to destruction.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p8"></span>He says, *Come shall the children of
Israel, they and the children of Judah together*; and he says this, that
they might still suspend their desires. He commends here the greatness
of God’s favor, because the condition of the Church would be better
after the exile than it was before. The ten tribes, as we know, had
separated from the kingdom of Judah; and that separation was as it were
the tearing asunder of the body. For God had adopted the seed of Abraham
for this end, that they might be one body under one head; but they
willfully made a defection, so that both kingdoms became mutilated. The
kingdom of Israel became indeed accursed, for it had separated from the
family of David, and this separation was in a manner an impious denial
of God. As then the children of Israel had alienated themselves from the
Church, and the kingdom of the ten tribes had become spurious, their
condition was doubtless miserable (though the Jews as well as the
Israelites were alike inebriated with their own lusts).

<span id="ii.iii.v-p9"></span>But what does our Prophet now say? They
shall return together, *the children of Israel and the children of
Judah*; that is, God will not only gather the dispersed, but will also
apply such a remedy, that there will no more be any separation; but that
on the contrary a brotherly concord will prevail between the ten tribes
and the tribe of Judah, when God shall restore them again to himself. We
now then perceive what the Prophet had in view: there is, indeed, here
an implied comparison between their former state and that which they
could yet hardly hope for, after their return from exile; for there is
nothing better than brotherly concord, as it is said in the Psalms,

<span id="ii.iii.v-p10"></span>“How good and how pleasant it is for
brethren  
to dwell together in unity.” (<span id="ii.iii.v-p10.2"></span>[Ps
133:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa133.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.iii.v-p10.2"></span>)

<span id="ii.iii.v-p11"></span>For the kingdom and the priesthood, the
pledges, as it were, of the people’s safety, could not stand together,
without the union of the Israelites with the Jews. But they had been
long alienated from one another, so that the chief favor of God had been
extinguished by this separation. The Prophet says now, that they would
*come together*.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p12"></span>And he adds, *Going and weeping they
shall come* This may seem contrary to what is said in the Psalms,

<span id="ii.iii.v-p13"></span>“Going they shall go, and weep as those
who sow; but coming they shall come with joy, carrying their handfuls.”
(<span id="ii.iii.v-p13.1"></span>[Ps
126:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.iii.v-p13.1"></span>)

<span id="ii.iii.v-p14"></span>The Prophet says here, that they shall
*come with tears*. How can these two things be consistent? even because
weeping may be taken for that which flows from joy or from admiration;
for we know that tears gush out not only through sorrow, but also
through rejoicing; and further, when anything unexpected happens, tears
will flow from our eyes. We can then take the Prophet’s words in this
sense, that they would come weeping, because they would then find God
merciful to them. But it is better to regard sorrow as simply meant; and
the two things may be thus reconciled, — that the Jews would come with
joy, and also with sorrow, not only because the memory of their exile
could not be immediately obliterated from their minds, but because it
behooved them to remember their sins: they saw the Temple overthrown,
the land wasted — sights sufficient to draw tears a hundred times from
the hardest. On one side there were reasons for joy; and on the other,
reasons for tears. We know that there were tears shed; for the Prophet
Haggai expressly tells us, that the old men, who had seen the former
Temple, were much cast down, because there was then no such glory as
they had seen. (<span id="ii.iii.v-p14.1"></span>[Hag
2](../../../bib/kjv/hag002.htm#000)<span id="ii.iii.v-p14.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.iii.v-p15"></span>However this may have been, the Prophet
means, that though the return would not be without many troubles, yet
the Jews would come; *coming*, he says, they shall *come*, that is,
going they shall go, *and weep*, as it is said in the Psalms, that they
would come through desert and dry places. (<span
id="ii.iii.v-p15.1"></span>[Ps
84:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa084.htm#006.md)<span
id="ii.iii.v-p15.1"></span>.) The meaning then is, that though the
journey would be hard and laborious, yet the Jews would return with
alacrity into their own country, so that no labors would so fatigue them
as to make them to desist from their course.

<span id="ii.iii.v-p16"></span>He subjoins the main thing, that they
would come to *seek their God* Their change of place would have been
useless, had they not come animated with the desire of worshipping God;
for the worship had ceased during the time of exile, as it is said again
in another Psalm,

<span id="ii.iii.v-p17"></span>“How shall we sing songs to our God in a
foreign land?” (<span id="ii.iii.v-p17.1"></span>[Ps
137:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#004.md)<span
id="ii.iii.v-p17.1"></span>)

<span id="ii.iii.v-p18"></span>Then the Prophet here reminds them, that
God’s favor would be real and complete, because the Jews would not only
return to their own country, so as to possess it, but that they would
also set up the worship of God, and dwell as it were under his
protection. It follows —

<span id="ii.iii.vi"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#005.md)<span id="ii.iii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p2"></span>**5**. They shall ask the way to Zion,
with their faces thitherward, *saying*, Come, and let us join ourselves
to the LORD in a perpetual covenant *that* shall not be forgotten.

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p3"></span>**5**. Sion interrogabunt viam (*hoc
est*, interrogabunt de via) versus Sionem, illuc facies eorum: Venite,
et copulate vos Jehovae foedere perpetuo, quod oblivione non delebitur
(*subaudiendum est relativum pronomen*, *quod omissum est*.)

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p6"></span>He explains himself more at large, that
they would *ask* those they met *the way*, that *their faces* would be
towards *Sion*, that they would also exhort one another to seek God and
join themselves to him by a perpetual covenant. The Prophet includes
here all the tribes, and says that the Jews and the Israelites would not
only return into their own country, to partake of the produce of that
rich and fruitful land, but that they would also render to God the
worship due to him, and then that nothing would be so vexatious to them
but that they would be able to overcome all difficulties and all
obstacles.

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p7"></span>He says first, that they would *ask the
way* — a proof of perseverance; that they would *ask the way to Sion*,
that is, ask how they were to proceed that they might come to Sion. By
these words, the Prophet, as I have just said, denotes their constancy
and indefatigable resolution, as though he had said, that though they
journeyed through unknown lands, yea, through many devious places, they
would yet be in no way disheartened so as not to inquire of those they
met with until they came to Sion. This is one thing. Then he adds to the
same purpose, *Thither their faces* We indeed know, that plans are often
changed when adverse events impede us; for he who undertakes an
expedition, when he sees his course very difficult, turns back again.
But the Prophet declares here that there would be no change of mind that
would cause the Jews to relinquish their purpose of returning, because
*their faces* would be towards *Sion*, that is, they would turn their
eyes thither, so that nothing would be able to turn them elsewhere.
There is added, in the third place, an exhortation, *Come ye; and they
shall join themselves to Jehovah* their God, by *a perpetual covenant*
Here the Prophet first shews, that the Jews would be so encouraged as to
add stimulants to one another; and hence it is said, *Come ye*; and,
secondly, he adds, *they shall cleave* (there is here a change of
person) *to Jehovah by a perpetual covenant which shall not by oblivion
be obliterated*  <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md)

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p11"></span>He again repeats what he had said, that
the exiles would not return to their own country, that they might there
only indulge themselves, but he mentions another end, even that they
might join themselves to God. He means, in short, that God would do for
them something better and more excellent than to allure them by earthly
pleasures.

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p12"></span>But we must notice the words, *they
shall cleave* (so it is literally*) to Jehovah by a perpetual covenant*;
for there is an implied contrast between the covenant they had made void
and the new covenant which God would make with them, of which Jeremiah
spoke in <span id="ii.iii.vi-p12.1"></span>[Jeremiah
31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#000.md)<span id="ii.iii.vi-p12.1"></span>.
God’s covenant was, indeed, ever inviolable; for God did not promise to
be the God of Abraham for a certain term of years; but the adoption, as
Paul testifies, remains fixed, and can never be changed. (<span
id="ii.iii.vi-p12.2"></span>[Ro
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#029.md)<span
id="ii.iii.vi-p12.2"></span>.) Then on God’s part it is eternal. But as
the Jews had become covenant-breakers, that covenant is called, on this
account, weak and evanescent: and for this reason the Prophet said,

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p13"></span>“In the last days I will make a covenant
with you, not such as I made with your fathers, for they have broken, he
said, that covenant.” (<span id="ii.iii.vi-p13.1"></span>[Jer.
31:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#031.md),
[32](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#032)<span id="ii.iii.vi-p13.1"></span>.md)

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p14"></span>Jeremiah now repeats the same thing,
though more briefly, that the Jews would return to favor with God, not
only for a moment, but that his covenant might continue and remain
valid; and the way by which this would be done is expressed in <span
id="ii.iii.vi-p14.1"></span>[Jeremiah
21](../../../bib/kjv/jer021.htm#000.md)<span id="ii.iii.vi-p14.1"></span>,
even because God would inscribe his law on their inward parts, and
engrave it on their hearts. For it is not in man’s power to continue so
constant as that God’s covenant should never fail; but what the Prophet
omits here must be supplied from the former passage, that when the Jews
returned, God’s covenant would again become so valid and fixed, that it
would never fail, even because their hearts would be renewed, so that
they would be faithful to God, and never become apostates any more like
their fathers.

<span id="ii.iii.vi-p15"></span>He then adds, This covenant *shall not
be forgotten. We* hence conclude, that the perpetuity of which he
speaks, was founded rather on the mere benevolence of God than on the
virtue of the people. He calls then the covenant which God would never
forget, perpetual, because he would remember his mercy towards the
chosen people; and though they were unworthy to receive such a favor,
yet he would continue perpetually his mercy towards them to the coming
of Christ; for the passage clearly shows that this prophecy cannot be
otherwise explained than of Christ’s spiritual kingdom. The Jews indeed
returned to their own country, but it was only a small number; and
besides, they were harassed by many troubles; God also visited their
land with sterility, and they were lessened by various slaughters in
wars: how then came the prophets thus to extol in such high terms the
favor of God, which yet did not appear among the people? even because
they included the kingdom of Christ; for whenever they spoke of the
return of the people, they ascended, as we have said, to the chief
deliverance. I do not yet follow our interpreters, who explain these
prophecies concerning the spiritual kingdom of Christ allegorically; for
simply, or as they say, literally, ought these words to be taken, — that
God would never forget his covenant, so as to retain the Jews in the
possession of the land. But this would have been a very small thing, had
not Christ come forth, in whom is founded the real perpetuity of the
covenant, because God’s covenant cannot be separated from a state of
happiness; for blessed are the people, as the Psalmist says, to whom God
shows himself to be their God. (<span id="ii.iii.vi-p15.1"></span>[Ps
144:15](../../../bib/kjv/psa144.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.iii.vi-p15.1"></span>.) Now, then, as the *Jews* were so
miserable, it follows that God’s covenant did not openly appear or was
not conspicuous; we must therefore come necessarily to Christ, as we
have elsewhere seen, that this was commonly done by the Prophets. The
Prophet now enters on a new argument, —

<span id="ii.iii.vii"></span>

id="ii.iii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah

inebriated with the sweetness of earthly blessings which thou bestowest

eternal felicity, and in the meantime have such a taste of thy
blessings, that we may know that thou art an inexhaustible fountain of
all felicity, so that we may cleave to thee with a sincere heart and in
perfect integrity, until we shall at length be brought to the full
fruition of that kingdom, which thine only-begotten Son has procured for
us by his own blood. — Amen.

<span id="ii.iii.ix-p2"></span><span id="ii.iii.ix-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.ix-p3"></span>THE, Prophet in the sixth verse compares
God’s people to lost sheep: he therefore says, that the Jews *wandered
on the mountains* and *went from mountain to hill* He throws the blame
on the shepherds, by whom the miserable people had been led astray.
Notwithstanding, God does not extenuate the fault of the people; nor did
he accuse the pastors as though their wickedness and perfidy absolved
the people; but on the contrary, he commends the greatness of his own
grace, that he had mercy on a flock that was lost and without hope. We
now then understand the design of the Prophet when he thus spoke in the
person of God, *My people have become lost sheep, and the shepherds have
seduced them, on the mountains have they made them to go astray, from
mountain to hill have they gone;* and he says, that they had *forgotten
their lying down;*  <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) for when there
is no fixed station, the sheep have no place to rest. Flocks, we know,
return in the evening to their folds. But the Prophet says that the
Jews, when scattered, forgot their lying down, because they had no
settled habitation. It afterwards follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.x"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.x-p1"></span><span id="ii.iii.x-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#007.md)<span id="ii.iii.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.x-p2"></span>**7**. All that found them have devoured
them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have
sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the
hope of their fathers.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p3"></span>**7**. Omnes qui invenerunt eos
comederunt, et adversarii eorum dixerunt, Non peccamus, quia scelerati
fuerunt contra Jehovam; habitaculum justitiae et expectatio (*vel*,
spes) patrum ipsorum, Jehova.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.x-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.x-p6"></span>Jeremiah goes on with the same subject;
for he tells us how miserable was the condition of the people until God
looked on them to relieve them from their evils. And this comparison, as
I have before said, more fully sets forth the favor of God, because he
raised up his people as it were from hell at a time when they were
reduced to despair.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p7"></span>He says first, *All who found them
devoured them;* that is, all who came in contact with them thought them
a prey. He, in short, means that they were plundered by all who met
them; and then that enemies were so far from sparing them that they
gloried in their cruelty towards them. Hence he adds, *Their enemies
said, We sin not, because they have acted wickedly against Jehovah.* By
these words the Prophet intimates, that their enemies indulged in
greater wantonness, because they thought that what they did would not be
punished. Almost the same sentiment is found in Zechariah, where it is
said,

<span id="ii.iii.x-p8"></span>“All who devoured them sinned not, and
they who devoured them said, Blessed be the Lord who has enriched us.”
(<span id="ii.iii.x-p8.1"></span>[Zec
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/zac011.htm#005)<span id="ii.iii.x-p8.1"></span>.md)

<span id="ii.iii.x-p9"></span>But we must more closely consider the
design of the Holy Spirit. The Prophet indeed shows that the Jews were
reduced to extremities, so that they were not only cruelly treated by
their enemies, but were also exposed to the greatest contempt. He,
however, reminded them at the same time of their duty to repent, for
when the whole world condemned them, it was but right that God should
call them to an account for their sins. As then he had set over them all
men as their judges, he indirectly touched and goaded their consciences,
so that they might know that they had to do with God. When therefore
Zechariah said,

<span id="ii.iii.x-p10"></span>“All who devoured thee said, Blessed be
the Lord,”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p11"></span>he meant, that the sins of the people
were so manifest to all, that all the heathens declared that they
deserved extreme punishment; for by the words, “Blessed be the Lord who
hath enriched us,” he intimated that heathens, in spoiling and
plundering the Jews, would be so far from feeling any shame, that they
would rather glory in being enriched with prey as it were by the hand of
God. So also in this place, *All who found them devoured them, and their
enemies said, We sin, not,* — and why? *because they have acted wickedly
against Jehovah.*

<span id="ii.iii.x-p12"></span>In short, the Prophet means, that the
Jews would not only be exposed to the rapacity, avarice, and cruelty of
enemies, but also to the greatest contempt and reproach. At the same
time he exhorted them to repent; for if they were thus condemned by the
judgment of the whole world, it was not unreasonable to direct their
thoughts to the tribunal of God. Nor was it a strange thing that the
unbelieving referred to God, for it is what we commonly meet with in all
the prophets; and it was ever a principle held by all nations, that
there is some supreme Deity; for though they devised for themselves
various gods, yet they all believed that there is one supreme God. So
the name, Jehovah, was known in common by all nations: and hence the
Prophet here introduced the Chaldeans as speaking, that the Jews had
*acted wickedly against Jehovah;* not indeed that they ascribed to God
his honor, but because this opinion, that there is some God, was held by
all; and this God they all indiscriminately worshipped according to
their own forms of religion, but they still thought that they worshipped
God.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p13"></span>What follows, interpreters explain as
though the Prophet in the person of enemies intended to exaggerate the
sin of the chosen people; they therefore connect the words thus, “They
have been wicked against Jehovah, who is the habitation of justice, and
has always been the hope of their fathers.” If we take this meaning, it
is no wonder that their sin is amplified, because the Jews had forsaken
not some unknown God, whose favor and power they had not experienced,
but because they had been perfidious against the God who had by many
proofs testified his paternal love towards them. It was then an impiety
the more detestable, because they had thus dared to forsake the only
true God.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p14"></span>But I approve of a different meaning, —
that the Prophet answers by God’s command, that their enemies deceived
themselves, when they thus confidently trod under foot the chosen
people, and thought that everything was lawful for them. The Prophet, I
doubt not, now checks the wantonness of which he speaks, as though he
had said, “Ye think that this people are wholly rejected by me, and
hence there are no limits to your cruelty; but I have so adopted them,
that my covenant can never be rendered void.” We may better understand
what Jeremiah means by a similar example: when Isaiah answered King
Hezekiah that God would be the defender of the city*,* when they recited
to him the words of Sennacherib or of Rabshakch, who brought his orders,
(<span id="ii.iii.x-p14.1"></span>[Isa
37:24](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#024.md)<span
id="ii.iii.x-p14.1"></span>) he said,

<span id="ii.iii.x-p15"></span>“But he thinks not that I have founded
Sion.”  <span id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md)

<span id="ii.iii.x-p17"></span>That answer seems to me to be wholly like
this passage. Sennacherib said, “I will go up and take the city and the
temple;” he, in short, triumphed as though he was a conqueror; but God,
on the other hand, restrained his confidence in these words, “But that
impious and proud enemy knows not that I have created Sion, and have
been from the beginning its maker: can I then now bring upon it such a
destruction as would wholly cut off the memory of it? Many cities have
indeed perished, and there is no place so illustrious which may not
sometime be destroyed; but the condition of the holy city (says God) is
different.” And he adds the reason, Because he had created it. So in
this place, *Jehovah is the habitation, of justice and the hope of their
fathers* For God’s enemies almost always form their judgment according
to the present state of things; for in prosperity they are inflated with
so much pride that they dare insolently to utter blasphemies against
God. For though the Chaldeans had spoken thus, that they sinned not,
because the Jews had been wicked, there is yet no doubt but that their
boasting was insulting to God, as it is said in <span
id="ii.iii.x-p17.1"></span>[Isa.
37:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023.md)<span id="ii.iii.x-p17.1"></span>,

<span id="ii.iii.x-p18"></span>“The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath
despised and derided thee, and drawn out the tongue against thee; me,
the God of hosts, he says, hath he despised.”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p19"></span>By these words God shows that he was
derided in the person of his Church. For this reason, then, God himself
now comes forth and declares that he is the habitation of justice and
the hope of his chosen people, in order that the Chaldeans might not
promise themselves prosperity perpetually.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p20"></span>We hence see that these sentences are set
in opposition one to another rather than connected together, and spoken
in the person of the ungodly. The Chaldeans said, “We sin not, because
they have acted wickedly against Jehovah;” then the Prophet responds and
shows that they deceived themselves if they thought that God’s covenant
was abolished, because he for a time chastised his people, as it is said
by Isaiah,

<span id="ii.iii.x-p21"></span>“What shall the messengers of the nations
declare?”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p22"></span>or,

<span id="ii.iii.x-p23"></span>“What shall be told by the messengers of
the nations? that God hath founded Sion.” (<span
id="ii.iii.x-p23.1"></span>[Isa
14:32](../../../bib/kjv/isa014.htm#032.md)<span
id="ii.iii.x-p23.1"></span>)

<span id="ii.iii.x-p24"></span>When he spoke of the deliverance of the
people and city, he added this acclamation, that it would be a memorable
benefit, the report of which would be known among all nations, that is,
that God had founded Sion, that it had been wonderfully delivered as it
were from present destruction.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p25"></span>He first calls God the *habitation of
justice;* and he alludes, as I think, to the tabernacle; and then he
more clearly expresses himself, that *God was the hope of their fathers*
The Jews were indeed unworthy of being protected by God; but he speaks
not here of their merits, but, on the contrary, God himself affirms the
perpetuity of his covenant, and the constancy of his faithfulness, in
opposition to the ungodly. For since the Chaldeans had already possessed
the greater part of the country, and had taken all the cities except
Jerusalem, they thought that the people were forsaken by their God; and
this tended to cast reproach on God himself. Hence he declares here,
that though the Jews had been wicked, yet his covenant was so far from
being extinct, that he was a *habitations,* that is, like a place of
refuge. And he calls him the *habitation of justice,* that is, firm or
faithful; for justice is not to be taken here in its proper sense, but,
as in many other places of Scripture, it means firmness or rectitude; as
though he had said, “God has once extended his wings to cherish his
people, (as it is said elsewhere;) he will therefore be always a sure
habitation.”

<span id="ii.iii.x-p26"></span>He had also been the hope of their
fathers, according to what is said by Isaiah, that he had created Sion
from the beginning; but he renews the memory of his covenant, as though
he had said, “It is not today that I have first received this people
into favor, but I made a covenant with their father Abraham, which will
remain fixed.” So, also, he says in this place, that he was the hope of
their fathers, even because he had adopted the whole race of Abraham,
and showed them mercy through all ages. Then the Prophet indirectly
infers that it would not be possible for their enemies perpetually to
possess power over them, because God, after having chastened his people,
would again gather the dispersed, and thus heal all their evils.  <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md)

<span id="ii.iii.x-p30"></span>A useful doctrine may be hence gathered,
that whenever the Church seems to be so oppressed by enemies as to
exclude any hope of restoration, this ought always to be borne in mind
by us, that as God has once chosen it, it cannot be but that he will
manifest his faithfulness even in death itself, and raise from the grave
those who seem to have been already reduced to ashes. Let this passage,
then, come to our minds, when the calamities of the Church threaten
utter ruin, and nothing but despair meets us; and when enemies
insolently arrogate everything to themselves, and boastingly declare
that we are accursed. But God is a *habitation of justice,* and was the
*hope of our fathers;* let us, then, recumb on that grace which he has
once promised, when he deigned to choose us for himself, and to adopt us
as his peculiar people. Such is the import of the passage. It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xi"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xi-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#008.md)<span id="ii.iii.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xi-p2"></span>**8**. Remove out of the midst of
Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the
he-goats before the flocks.

<span id="ii.iii.xi-p3"></span>**8**. Fugite e medio Babylonis, et e
Chaldaea egredimini, et sitis tanquam hirci ante gregem.

<span id="ii.iii.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xi-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xi-p6"></span>This verse confirms the exposition which
I have given; for God does not now reprove his people, nor does he
condemn their sins; but on the contrary, he exhorts them to entertain
good hope, though they were overwhelmed with extreme miseries, he then
pursues the same subject when he bids them to *flee from Babylon and to
go forth from Chaldea;* for he promises deliverance to the faithful, and
at the same time reminds them of the coming ruin of the Chaldean empire,
so that they who went the farthest off would best consult their own
safety. For the Prophet intimates that all found in Chaldea would be
exposed to the violence of enemies; hence he bids them to flee and to go
forth quickly. But as I have before said, he promises a free exit to the
Jews; for he would have in vain exhorted them to depart had they been
shut up, for we know that they had been confined as within inclosures.
Had they then been thus captives, the Prophet would have spoken in
mockery by saying to them, *Flee* and *go forth* But he shows that their
captivity would not be perpetual, because God would remove all obstacles
and open a way for the miserable exiles to return to their own country.

<span id="ii.iii.xi-p7"></span>He bids them to be as *he-goats before
the flocks:* by which he means that they were to hasten with all
confidence. For the he-goats possess more boldness than sheep, and they
go before the flock because no fear restrains them. So God takes away
every fear of danger from the Jews when he bids them to be *as he-goats
before the flock;* as though he had said that they were no more to fear,
lest the Chaldeans should punish them for avowing their wish to return
to their own country; for it was a capital offense to speak of their
return as long as the Chaldeans ruled over the Jews. But God now
promises a change, for he would dissipate the terror by which they had
been for a time restrained. It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#009.md)<span id="ii.iii.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p2"></span>**9**. For, lo, I will raise and cause
to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north
country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence
she shall be taken: their arrows *shall be* as of a mighty expert man;
none shall return in vain.

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p3"></span>**9**. Quia ecce ego excito (excitans,
*ad verbum,* et adducens) et adduco super Babylonem congregationem
gentium magnarum e terra aquilonis, et ordinabunt contra eam (aciem
*scilicet.) unde* capietur; sagittae ejus tanquam fortis prudenter
agentis; non redibit frustra,

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p6"></span>Here, again, God declares that enemies
would come and overthrow the monarchy of Babylon; but what has been
before referred to is here more clearly expressed. For he says, first,
that he would be the leader of that war — that the Persians and Medes
would fight under his authority. *I*, he says (the pronoun <span
id="ii.iii.xii-p6.1"></span>אנכי*, anki,* is here emphatical,) *I am
he,* says God, who *rouse* and *bring,* and then he adds, *an, assembly
of great nations* The Chaldeans, as we know, had devoured many kingdoms,
for Babylon had subjugated all the neighboring nations. Except, then,
this had been distinctly expressed, they might have disregarded the
prophetic threatenings. But Jeremiah speaks here of the assembly of
great nations, lest the Chaldeans, relying on their power, the largeness
of the monarchy, and the multitude of their men, should promise
themselves victory, and thus lie asleep in their indulgences. God then,
in these words, shortly intimates that there would be ready at hand
those who in number and power would surpass the Chaldeans.

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p7"></span>He afterwards adds, *They will set in
order against her.* Something is to be here supplied — that they would
set the battle in order. Now, by this expression, the Prophet sets forth
the boldness of the Persians and Medes, as they would be immediately
ready for the conflict; they would not long consult, but quickly advance
to the fight. In short, he refers to the quickness and boldness of the
Persians and Medes, when he says, *They shall set in order against her;*
for they who distrust their own strength, take convenient positions, or
contrive ambushes, or withdraw for a time until they know all the plans
of their enemies; but the Prophet says that the Persians would by no
means be such, because they would be prepared for battle at the first
onset, and have the army set in order against the Babylonians.

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p8"></span>It follows, *thence taken shall be*
Babylon. The word <span id="ii.iii.xii-p8.1"></span>משם, *mesham,* means
from that place. But the Prophet intimates that the Persians would
become conquerors by one battle only, so that the Chaldeans would no
more dare to resist. We indeed know that those once put to flight, do
often prepare new forces and renew the battle; this is indeed usually
the case, and it seldom happens that any one is conquered in one battle.
But the Prophet here declares that Babylon would be taken at one time;
as soon, he says, as the fight begins, the enemies shall not only
overcome, but shall by one assault take Babylon, so as to make it
captive.

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p9"></span>We now, then, perceive the design of the
Prophet; but, doubtless, this prophecy was a derision to the
unbelieving, for he seemed to speak of a thing impossible: thus he sang
a fable to the deaf. But God, however, did not without reason predict
that Babylon would be so taken, that it would, as it were, in one moment
fall into the hands of enemies. We said, indeed, yesterday, that it was
long besieged and taken by treachery in the night; but we also said that
this prophecy is not to be confined to one period; for Babylon was often
taken. It was taken through the contrivance of Zopyrus, as we said
yesterday, when it thought itself sufficiently strong to resist, and
Darius had nearly despaired. We shall therefore find nothing
inconsistent in this prophecy, when we consider how great and how supine
was the security of that people even at the time when they were suddenly
overthrown.

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p10"></span>He now adds, *Its arrows as of a
valiant man;* some render it, as of a bereaving man, because some put
the point on the right side and some on the left. The word <span
id="ii.iii.xii-p10.1"></span>שכל, *shecal,* means to act prudently, to
be prosperous, and also to be bereaved. But I agree with those who take
the first sense, for it immediately follows, *it shall not return in
vain* Those who render the word “bereaved,” understand thereby that the
arrows of the Persians would be deadly or fatal. But the context does
not correspond, for an explanation is afterwards given, that it would
not return in vain. It seems, then, that by this word Jeremiah denotes
their dexterity, as though he had said that the Persians would be so
skillful in throwing arrows, that they would not discharge one arrow in
vain; as those who are well exercised in that art always aim directly at
an enemy, and never shoot their arrows here and there without effect. So
then the Prophet says that the arrows of the Persians would be those of
men shooting skillfully, who know how to take a right aim.  <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) And he calls them *valiant* or strong;
for it is not enough to send arrows straight against an enemy, except
there be also nerve and strength to shoot them; for arrows might touch
one, but not penetrate into his body, or hardly hurt his skin. But the
Prophet refers to both these things — that arrows would be hurled with
sufficient force to strike and wound the Chaldeans — and that they would
also have always a direct aim, so that no one would miss its object. It
afterwards follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xiii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xiii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah

<span id="ii.iii.xiii-p2"></span>**10**. And Chaldea shall be a spoil:

<span id="ii.iii.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xiii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xiii-p6"></span>Here he mentions the effect of the
victory, that he might more fully confirm what he had said; for it is
sometimes the case, that they who are conquered flee to their cities.
The country is indeed laid waste, but the enemies depart with their
spoils. But the Prophet here says, that the whole of Chaldea would be
plundered: he further adds, that the plunderers would be *satiated,* as
though he had said, “The enemies shall not only seize on all sides, as
it sometimes happens, on what may fall into their hands, but they shall
heap together all the treasures of Chaldea until they shall be
satiated.” He means, in short, that Chaldea would be wholly emptied; for
these two things ought to be deemed as set in opposition the one to the
other, — that the enemies would be filled to satiety, and that the
Chaldeans would be reduced to poverty. Then the satiety of which the
Prophet speaks, implies that the Chaldeans would be brought to extreme
penury and want. It follows, —

Chaldeans insolently exulted for a time, yet their joy would not
continue; and at the same time he points out the cause of their ruin,
even because they dealt so arrogantly with the people of God. He then
says in the former clause, *Ye exulted and rejoiced in plundering my
heritage;* and then he adds, *Ye became fat* (for to be multiplied means
here to become fat) *as a heifer,* well fed, or *of the grass;* for some
think that the word is used for <span id="ii.iii.xiv-p8.1"></span>דשאה,
*deshae;* but some render it, “herbified,” or fed on grass; while others
derive the word from <span id="ii.iii.xiv-p8.2"></span>דוש, *dush,* to
thresh or tread out corn.  <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) It is
then added, *Ye neighed like strong horses,* or ye bellowed like bulls,
as some render the words; for <span id="ii.iii.xiv-p9.2"></span>אבירים,
*abirim,* sometimes mean bulls, and sometimes strong horses; and the
verb <span id="ii.iii.xiv-p9.3"></span>צהל, *tzal,* means to cry aloud,
but is taken sometimes in the sense of neighing, as we have seen in
<span id="ii.iii.xiv-p9.4"></span>[Jeremiah
5](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#000.md)<span id="ii.iii.xiv-p9.4"></span>,
“Every one neigheth on his neighbor’s wife;” the Prophet said so in
condemning the people for their lusts; and they who apply this passage
to bulls are obliged to change the meaning of the verb — for bellowing,
and not neighing, is what belongs to bulls.  <span
id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md)

<span id="ii.iii.xiv-p11"></span>Now it was necessary, for two reasons,
for the Prophet to speak thus; first, it was hardly credible, that the
Chaldeans, after so many and so remarkable victories, could be broken
down and laid prostrate by new enemies; for they had been terrible to
the whole world, they had subdued all their neighbors, they had extended
on all sides their borders; it was then the same as though they had set
their nest in the clouds. Then the Prophet says here, that though they
exulted and gave loose reins to their joy, yet this state of things
would not be perpetual, because they should at length be brought to
shame. This is one thing. And the second reason why the Prophet spoke
thus was, because God intended that it should be testified to his own
people, that though he permitted so much liberty to the Chaldeans, he
had not yet forgotten his covenant; and for this reason he mentioned the
word heritage. Though then the calamity of his people was apparently a
sort of repudiation, as though God designed to have nothing more to do
with them, yet he says that they were his own heritage; and thus he
shows, that God would give a specimen of his favor towards the Jews, by
thus severely chastising the Chaldeans. This then is the reason why he
says, *Ye have rejoiced in plundering my heritage, but your mother is
ashamed.* He expresses here more than if he had said, “Ye shall at
length lie down confounded with shame;” but he names their mother, that
he might intimate the destruction of the whole of that monarchy, which
had been so terrible to all the neighboring nations.  <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md)

<span id="ii.iii.xv"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="ii.iii.xv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that though we cease
not daily to provoke thy wrath by our many sins, we may yet, with
confidence, flee to thy mercy, and that though thou seemest for a time
to cast us away, we may not yet cast away hope, founded on thy eternal
word, but that, relying on that Mediator in whom we always find the
price of expiation, we may not hesitate to call on thee as our Father;
and may we, in the meantime, find thee by experience to be such towards
us, so that we may cheerfully look forward to that celestial
inheritance, which has been obtained for us by the blood of thy
only-begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="ii.iii.xv-p3"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xvi"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xvi-p1"></span>LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIRST

<span id="ii.iii.xvi-p2"></span><span id="ii.iii.xvi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xvi-p3"></span>WE explained yesterday why the Prophet
denounced shame and reproach on the Babylonians, even because they had
arrogantly exulted over the children of God. And he says that Babylon
would be *the extremity of the Nations.*

<span id="ii.iii.xvi-p4"></span>The Chaldeans had flourished in power
and wealth, and possessed the empire of the East. It was then an
extraordinary revolution to be reduced to the lowest condition, to be,
as it were, the dregs of all the nations. And to the same purpose he
adds, *a barren land, a desert, and a solitude* It now follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xvii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xvii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xvii-p2"></span>**13**. Because of the wrath of the
LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every
one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her
plagues.

<span id="ii.iii.xvii-p3"></span>**13**. Ab indignatione Jehovae non
habitabitur *(hoc est,* praee indignatione, *aut,* propter
indignationem,) et erit vastitas tota; quisquis transierit per Babylonem
stupebit, et sibilabit super omnibus plagis ejus.

<span id="ii.iii.xvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xvii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xvii-p6"></span>Jeremiah again repeats that the
destruction of Babylon would be an evidence of God’s vengeance, because
the Chaldeans had unjustly raged against the Church. But the name of God
seems also to have been designedly mentioned, that the faithful might
more readily receive this prophecy: for had they thought that what
Jeremiah said came from man, they would have hardly believed his words,
for what he said exceeded the comprehension of men. He then mentioned
the indignation of God, that the faithful might know that it was absurd
to form an opinion concerning the ruin of Babylon according to the
present aspect of things, because God would do a work there beyond the
common course of things.

<span id="ii.iii.xvii-p7"></span>He then says, that it would become *a
waste,* so that *every one passing through it* would be astonished, and
yet would not pity it. This way of speaking often occurs in the
Prophets, when they wish to describe a waste exceeding what is common.
In the meantime, what follows ought to be noticed, that this arrangement
would excite no commiseration, but rather mockery, which the Prophet
denotes by the word *hissing.* It then follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xviii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xviii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#014.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xviii-p2"></span>**14**. Put yourselves in array
against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her,
spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.

<span id="ii.iii.xviii-p3"></span>**14**. Ordinate contra Babel per
circuitum; quicunque tenditis arcum projicite *(vel,* jaculamini) super
earn, (contra eam,) ne parcatis sagittee; quia contra Jehovam scelerat
egit.

<span id="ii.iii.xviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xviii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xviii-p6"></span>The Prophet now turns to address the
Medes and Persians, and instigates them, in the name of God, to destroy
Babylon. We have already said, why the Prophets assume authority over
all nations, even that they might show that God’s power is connected
with his word. For men do not easily apprehend the efficacy of God’s
word, and think that the air is to no purpose beaten by an empty sound.
Hence the Prophets show that God has his hand extended whenever he
speaks, so that nothing is announced in vain. This then is the reason
why the Prophet now, as before, commands the Persians and Medes
strenuously to exert themselves in attacking Babylon.

<span id="ii.iii.xviii-p7"></span>He says, first, *Set in order,* that
is, the battle, or the assault; set in order *against Babylon;* and
then, *around,* so that no escape might be open to them. He adds, *All
ye who bend the bow,* for this mode of fighting was common among the
Medes and Persians, as it appeared elsewhere; and the Orientals still
follow the same practice, for they throw darts at their enemy, and move
here and there, for they do not engage in pitched battles. he afterwards
says, *Throw* or *shoot at her, spare not the arrow;* the singular is
here used for the plural, he adds the reason, *because they have acted
wickedly against God.*  <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md)

<span id="ii.iii.xviii-p9"></span>Though the iniquity of Babylon was
manifold, there is yet no doubt but that God here undertakes the cause
of his Church. Then, of all the sins of the Chaldeans, the chief was
this, that they had oppressed the Church of God; for we know with what
favor God regards his children, so that he who hurts them toucheth the
apple of his eye, as he testifies elsewhere. (<span
id="ii.iii.xviii-p9.1"></span>[Zec
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xviii-p9.1"></span>.) This singular effect of love Jeremiah
sets forth when he says, that the Chaldeans had *acted wickedly against
Jehovah,* even because they had tyrannically oppressed his Church.

<span id="ii.iii.xviii-p10"></span>Now God will have nothing, as it
were, apart from his children: and hence we learn a useful doctrine, —
that the salvation of his Church is so precious in the sight of God,
flint he regards the wrong done to the faithful as done to himself. Thus
there is no reason why we should torment ourselves, when the ungodly
harass us, because God will at length really show that our salvation is
not less dear to him than their own eyes are to men. It afterwards
follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xix"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p2"></span>**15**. Shout against her round about:
she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are
thrown down: for it *is* the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon
her; as she hath done, do unto her.

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p3"></span>**15**. Vociferamini contra eam per
circuitum; dedit manum suam; ceciderunt fundamenta ejus, diruti sunt
muri ejus, quia ultio Jehovae haec; ultionem sumite de ea; quemadmodum
fecit, facite ei.

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p6"></span>Jeremiah proceeds in exhorting the
Persians and the Medes, not that he had ever spoken to them; but this
mode of speaking, as it has been said, availed to confirm the minds of
the godly, so that they might feel assured that what had proceeded from
the mouth of Jeremiah was not vain. Here, then, he assumes the person of
God himself, and with authority commands the Persians and the Medes as
to what they were to do. He says again, *Cry aloud against her.* By
crying aloud or shouting, he means the cry of triumph which soldiers
send forth when a city is taken, or rather, as I think, the encouraging
cries, by which soldiers rouse one another when they make an attack; for
battles are never without shoutings, nor the storming of cities. God
titan bids the soldiers to animate one another in their usual way to
make a strenuous effort. *Shout,* he says, and then adds, *all around.*

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p7"></span>He then says, *She hath given her hand*
By these words he intimates that Babylon would not be able to resist.
Hands are wont to be given as a token of union; but he is also said to
give his hand who confesses himself to be conquered. In this sense we
may take the words of Jeremiah, that Babylon had *given her hand,*
because she could not defend herself against the Medes and Persians. But
as we know flint the city was taken by treachery, in this manner also
was fulfilled what Jeremiah had announced, when two Satraps, in order to
revenge private wrongs, sent for Cyrus: for thus it happened that
Babylon, or those within it, willingly stretched forth the hands.

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p8"></span>It is added, *her foundations have
fallen, and her walls have been overthrown;* not that Cyrus attacked the
city with warlike engines, for he entered in by the fords; but still the
soldiers readily mounted the walls. Jeremiah then speaks figuratively,
as though he had said, that the Chaldeans were mistaken in thinking that
they had strong fortresses, because the walls would avail them nothing,
however high and wide they were. And we know what ancient historians
relate of these walls and towers. The event was almost incredible; for
no one could have thought it possible that a city so fortified could be
taken by assault. But the Prophet derides this confidence, and declares
that the *walls would be overthrown,* together with *their foundations*
 <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) But as it was a thing difficult to
be believed, he again adds a confirmation, that it would be *the
vengeance of Jehovah;* as though he had said, that the destruction of
Babylon ought not to be estimated according to the thoughts of men,
because God would there put forth his wonderful power. In the meantime,
he animates again the Persians and the Medes to take vengeance, and to
render to the Babylonians what they had deserved. The Prophet in short
intimates that the Persians and the Medes would be armed to execute
God’s vengeance on the Babylonians.

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p10"></span>But we must notice the last clause, *Do
to her as she has done* to others; for we hence learn, what we have also
observed elsewhere, that a reward is rendered to every one, so that they
who have been cruel to others, do find how dreadful is God’s judgment.
God does not always execute his judgment by men; but still this is ever
true,

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p11"></span>“Woe to thee who plunderest, for thou
shalt be plundered;”

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p12"></span>and also this,

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p13"></span>“Judgment without mercy shall be to
him  
who hath showed no mercy;”

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p14"></span>and still further,

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p15"></span>“With what measure any one measures,  
the same shall be rendered to him.”

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p16"></span>(<span
id="ii.iii.xix-p16.1"></span>[Isa
33:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa033.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xix-p16.1"></span>; <span id="ii.iii.xix-p16.2"></span>[Jas
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xix-p16.2"></span>; <span id="ii.iii.xix-p16.3"></span>[Mt
7:2](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xix-p16.3"></span>.) This truth, then, remains fixed and
unchangeable. But God in various ways renders to the ungodly their
reward; for he sometimes punishes them by the hand of man, and sometimes
he suspends his judgment. Here he shows that the Persians and the Medes
would be the executioners of his vengeance, even as the Chaldeans
themselves had been as it were his scourges when he chastised his people
for their sins; for he had employed the Chaldeans in carrying on war
against the Jews. But God has many ways by which he calls each one to an
account. Thus at length he punished the Chaldeans, because they indulged
only their avarice and ambition in oppressing the Jews; for it was not
their purpose to punish the Jews as they deserved; but their own lust,
as I have just said, led them to cruelty and slaughter. It was,
therefore, but just that they should in their turn be chastised by God’s
hand. It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xx"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xx-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#016.md)<span id="ii.iii.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xx-p2"></span>**16**. Cut off the sower from Babylon,
and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the
oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall
flee every one to his own land.

<span id="ii.iii.xx-p3"></span>**16**. Excidite seminantem e Babylone,
et qui apprehendit falcem tempore messis; coram gladio opprimente,
quisque ad populum suum respiciet, quisque ad terram suam fugiet.

<span id="ii.iii.xx-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xx-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xx-p6"></span>He still addresses the Medes and the
Persians, and bids them *cut* off from *Babylon* both the *sowers* and
the *reapers;* but by stating a part for the whole he includes also all
others. Husbandmen in a manner preserve the life of men, as other arts
and occupations are not capable of doing so. Were there no sowing and
reaping, all would of necessity perish. When, therefore, the Prophet
bids them take away those who sowed and reaped, it was the same as
though he had said, *“*Strike with the sword and kill all the
inhabitants, so that nothing may remain but the land reduced to
solitude.” He then commands the Chaldeans to be slain, so that no
husbandmen should remain to sow and reap.

<span id="ii.iii.xx-p7"></span>This, indeed, was not fulfilled by Cyrus,
as we have elsewhere seen. But what I then reminded you of ought to be
borne in mind, that the Prophet extends his threatenings much further,
for Babylon was often smitten by God’s hand, and at length wholly
destroyed. The assault of Cyrus was a prelude, but other calamities
followed, when it was more severely oppressed.

<span id="ii.iii.xx-p8"></span>He adds, *From the face of the
oppressing* or wasting *sword every one shall flee to his people and to
his own land* As that country was wealthy, many strangers had come
there, and they had also drawn together captives from all parts. Thus
many foreigners no doubt dwelt in Chaldea when the empire flourished.
There were there many husbandmen and many artificers. The Chaldeans
ruled, and yet many were content with small means, and even paltry; or
it may be that the Chaldeans compelled conquered nations to do servile
work in agriculture and in works of art. The Prophet now says, that in
the revolution which was to happen, each would look to his own land and
flee there, as there could be no delight in a country deserted and
desolate. Then from *the face of the oppressing sword shall every one
look to his own people and to his own land;* and those who before
pretended to be wholly devoted to the Chaldeans, would forsake them in
their necessity, because nothing would be better for them than to
consult their own safety. It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxi"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxi-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxi-p2"></span>**17**. Israel *is* a scattered sheep;
the lions have driven *him* away: first the king of Assyria hath
devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken
his bones.

<span id="ii.iii.xxi-p3"></span>**17**. Grex dispersus *(vel,* agnus

interdum gregem, interdum etiam significat singulos agnos, vel singulas
oves;* grex *ergo* dispersus fuit) Israel; leones expulerunt eun; primus
voravit eum rex Assyriae, et hic postremus contrivit ossa ejus
Nebuchadrezer rex Babylonis.

<span id="ii.iii.xxi-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxi-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxi-p6"></span>Here the Prophet more clearly shows what
he had briefly referred to, even that God was thus incensed against the
Babylonians, because he had undertaken the cause of the people whom he
had chosen. Then Jeremiah’s design was to show to the faithful, that
though God severely chastised them for a time, he had not wholly
divested himself of his paternal regard towards them, because he would
at length make it openly evident that they to whom he had been so rigid
were dear to him. He then mitigates the severity of punishment, that the
Jews might not succumb to despair, but call upon God in their miseries,
and hope that he, after having turned them, would at length be
propitious to them.

<span id="ii.iii.xxi-p7"></span>The sum of what is said is, that
whatever punishments God inflicts on his Church are temporary, and are
also useful for salvation, being remedies to prevent them from perishing
in their vices. Let us then learn to embrace the promises whenever we
are wounded with extreme sorrow under the chastisements of God: let us
learn, I say, to look to his mercy; and let us be convinced of this,
that though signs of his wrath may appear on every side, yet the
punishments we suffer are not fatal, but on the contrary, medicinal. For
this reason, the Prophet exhorted the faithful of his time to be
patient, by showing that God, after having been a Judge, would be again
a Father to them.

<span id="ii.iii.xxi-p8"></span>He then says that *Israel* was like *a
scattered flock,* or a straying sheep, which is the same thing. He
expresses how they became so, *the first* who *devoured* them was *the
king of Assyria;* for we know that the kingdom of Israel was overthrown
by the Assyrians, and the land of Judah was also very much pillaged by
them; a small portion remained. Then God says, that the people had been
consumed by the calamities which the Assyrians had occasioned. But he
compares what remained to bones, as though a wild beast devoured a
sheep, and left only the bones. There was then no flesh or skin in
Israel after the Assyrians had cruelly treated them, and that often. But
as the kingdom of Judah remained, he says that it was like bones; and
hence he adds, *and this last, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, hath
broken, his bones,*  <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) that is, hath
broken in pieces and devoured the bones which remained.

<span id="ii.iii.xxi-p10"></span>We now perceive the meaning of the
Prophet. Moreover, he exaggerates the miseries of the chosen people,
that he might in a manner open a way for mercy. God, then, here assumes
the feeling of man, who is touched with a sad spectacle, when he sees a
miserable and harmless sheep devoured, and the bones cast away, and then
sees another wild beast, still more savage, who breaks the bones with
his teeth and devours them. Since God then thus speaks, there is no
doubt but that he meant to express with what tender feeling he regarded
his chosen people, and that he also meant to give the godly the hope of
salvation. It afterwards follows,—

<span id="ii.iii.xxii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#018.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxii-p2"></span>**18**. Therefore thus saith the LORD
of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon
and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.

<span id="ii.iii.xxii-p3"></span>**18**. Propterea sic dicit Jehova
exercituun, Deus Israel, ecce ego visito super regem Babylonis, et super
terram ejus, quemadmodum visitavi regem Assyriae.

<span id="ii.iii.xxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxii-p6"></span>What I have said may hence with more
certainty be inferred — that the similitude which God employed was
intended for this end, that having assumed the person of one in sorrow,
he might represent as it were to their eyes his sympathy, he then shows
that he would be the avenger of the cruelty which the Chaldeans had
practiced, as he had already been the avenger of all the evils which the
Assyrians had done to his people.

<span id="ii.iii.xxii-p7"></span>We must bear in mind the time — for the
meaning of this passage depends on history. The Assyrians were stronger
than the Chaldeans when they harassed the kingdom of Israel: for we know
that in the time of Hezekiah the king of Babylon sent to him to seek his
favor, and to allure him to a confederacy. While then the monarchy of
Assyria was formidable, the Assyrians were very hostile to the
Israelites and also to the Jews: what followed? Nineveh was overthrown,
and Babylon succeeded in its place; and so they who had ruled were
constrained to bear the yoke, and thus Babylon made the Assyrians
captive to itself. God now refers to this judgment, which was known to
all. The Assyrians themselves did not indeed think that the God of
Israel was the avenger of his people, but yet it was so. Hence God here
declares that he had already given a manifest proof of the solicitude
which he had for the welfare of his people: as then he had punished
Assyria, so he declares that he would take vengeance on the Babylonians.
And thus, by an example, he confirms what might have appeared
incredible. For who could have thought that that monarchy could so
suddenly fall? And yet it happened beyond what any could have
anticipated. God here repeats what had taken place, that the faithful
might feel assured that the judgment which the Assyrians had
experienced, awaited the Babylonians. This is the plain meaning of the
Prophet. It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxiii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxiii-p2"></span>**19**. And I will bring Israel again
to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul
shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.

<span id="ii.iii.xxiii-p3"></span>**19**. Et reducam Israelem ad caulas
suas, et pascetur in (monte) Carmel et Basan, et in monte Ephraim et
Gilead; satiabitur anima ejus.

<span id="ii.iii.xxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxiii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxiii-p6"></span>Jeremiah pursues here the same
subject, and sustains the minds of the faithful in their miseries, lest
they should wholly despond. It is then the same as though he stretched
forth his hand to the shipwrecked, or gave support to those lying down
as it were lifeless; for exile to God’s children was not only sad, but
was like death, because they perceived the vengeance of God as though
they had been wholly repudiated. It was therefore necessary to give them
some consolation, that they might not altogether despair. The object,
then, of our Prophet now is, to encourage the Jews to bear patiently
their troubles, and not to think the stroke inflicted on them to be
fatal. Hence God promises a restoration to their own country, which
would be an evidence of pardon and of mercy; for when God gathered his
people, it was the same as though he had openly showed that their
adoption remained unchanged, and that the covenant which seemed for a
time to fail was still valid.

<span id="ii.iii.xxiii-p7"></span>We now then see why Jeremiah spoke of
the restoration of the people; and then he adds, to *their own folds,*
or to their own habitation. This mode of speaking, we know, is found
everywhere in the Prophets, for they compare God to a shepherd, and the
Church to a flock of sheep. This similitude then is sufficiently common,
nor could God better express how much he was concerned for the welfare
of his people, than by setting himself forth as their shepherd, and by
testifying that he would take care of his flock. But as we said at the
beginning of the book, Jeremiah had a special reason for using this
similitude, because he was from a town of pastures, and had been from
his childhood among shepherds: there is therefore no wonder that he
often uses expressions to which he had been accustomed; for education in
a great measure forms the language of men. Though then the Prophet
speaks according to the usual phraseology of Scripture, there is yet no
doubt but that he retained, as it has been said elsewhere, his own
habitual mode of speaking.

<span id="ii.iii.xxiii-p8"></span>He then says, that after the people
had been gathered, they would inhabit, rich and fertile mountains, even
*Carmel* and *Bashan.* The fruitfulness of these mountains is spoken of
in many places, but it is not necessary to quote them. The meaning
however is, that God, after having again gathered his chosen people,
would be as it were a faithful shepherd to them, so that they might feel
assured that there would be not only a free return to their own country,
but that God would be also the guardian of their safety, so as ever to
protect them, to exercise care over them, to defend them against their
enemies.

<span id="ii.iii.xxiii-p9"></span>But that God might more fully set
forth his kindness, he adds, *and satisfied shall be his soul* Soul here
is to be taken for desire, as in many other places. Now the former
doctrine ought to be borne in mind, that God is never so angry or
displeased with his Church but that he remembers his covenant. Then, as
to the faithful, after they have undergone their temporary punishment,
God at length stretches forth his hand to them; nor is he once only
propitious to them, but continues his mercy, and so cherishes them, that
he is not less solicitous for their welfare than a shepherd is, to whom
his flock is not less dear than his own life, so that he watches in the
night, endures cold and heat, and also exposes himself to many dangers
from robbers and wild beasts in order that he might protect his flock.
But the Prophet points out as by the finger the very fountain of all
this when he adds, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxiv"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxiv-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxiv-p2"></span>**20**. In those days, and in that
time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and
*there shall be* none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be
found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.

<span id="ii.iii.xxiv-p3"></span>**20**. In diebus illis et tempore
illo, dicit Jehova, quaeretur iniquitas Israel, et nulla erit, scelus
Jehudah, et non invenietur; quia propitius ero his quos fecero residuos.

<span id="ii.iii.xxiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxiv-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxiv-p6"></span>As I have already said, the Prophet now
shows the primary cause why God purposed to deal so kindly and
mercifully with his people, even because he would remit their sins. And
doubtless whatever is said of the remission of sins is cold and
unmeaning, except we be first convinced that God is reconciled and
propitious to us. The unbelieving indeed seek no other thing than to be
relieved from their evils, as the sick who require nothing from their
physician but that he should immediately remove pain. If the sick man
thirsts, “Take away thirst,” he will say. In short, they regard only the
symptom, of the disease they do not say a word. Such is the case with
the ungodly, they neglect the chief thing, that God should pardon them
and receive them into favor. Provided they are exempted from punishment,
this is enough for them. But as to the faithful, they can never be
satisfied until they feel assured that God is propitious to them. In
order, then, to free from disquietude and all misgivings the minds of
the godly, our Prophet says that God would be propitious, so that he
would bury all the sins of Israel and Judah, so that they might no more
be remembered or come to judgment.

<span id="ii.iii.xxiv-p7"></span>This passage is remarkable, and from it
we especially learn this valuable truth, that when God severely
chastises us, we ought not to stop at the punishment and seek only a
relief from our troubles, but on the contrary we ought to look to the
very cause of all evils, even our sins. So David, in many places, when
he seeks from God a relaxation of evil, does not only say, “Lord,
deliver me from mine enemies; Lord, restore to me my health; Lord,
deliver me from death;” — he does not simply speak thus, but he
earnestly flees to God and implores his mercy. And on the other hand,
when God promises deliverance from punishment, he does not simply say,
“I will restore you from exile or captivity, I will restore you to your
own country;” but he says, “I will forgive you your sins.” For when the
disease is removed, the symptoms also which accompany the disease
disappear. So also it happens in this case, for when God shows that he
is propitious to us, we are then freed from punishment, that is, what we
have for a time suffered, or what awaited us, had not God spared us
according to his infinite mercy and goodness.  <span

<span id="ii.iii.xxv"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="ii.iii.xxv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou
hast been so merciful towards thine ancient *people,* and however
grievously thou mightest have been offended, yet thou didst preserve
some remnant to whom thou gavest tokens of thy mercy, — O grant that it
may please thee so to allure us also at this day; and however we may
deserve a thousand times to be condemned by thee, yet deign to receive
us in thine only-begotten Son, and through him show thyself reconciled
to us to the end of our life; and be thou our Father in death itself, so
that we may live and die to thee, and acknowledge this to be the only
true way of salvation, until we shall at length enjoy that celestial
inheritance which has been obtained for us by the blood of the same,
thine only-begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p1"></span>LECTURE ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SECOND

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p2"></span>IN the last lecture we began to explain
what the Prophet says, that when God redeemed his people he would be so
propitious as to blot out all their sins. We said also that the Prophet
shows that the people had for just reasons been treated with severity.
Here then we have to observe the justice of God in all his judgments.
For the Prophet reminds us that the Jews could not have been reconciled
to God, except they acknowledged that they had been justly punished. And
hence we learn also a useful doctrine, that whenever God smites us with
his rods, we are not only to seek that relief may be given us from
external evils or sorrow, but that God may also forgive us. The reason
also is to be observed, for the Prophet teaches us that there would be
no iniquity because God would be propitious. We hence learn that there
were also just reasons why God chastised his people, but that as he
designed to forgive their sins he became their deliverer. Let us then
know that we are counted just before God, not because he sees no
iniquities in us, but because he freely forgives them. It is, in short,
the only true way of being reconciled to God, when he buries as it were
our sins so as never to call them to judgment.

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p3"></span>Moreover, that this favor properly
belongs to the kingdom of Christ may be gathered from the thirty-first
chapter, where the Prophet, having spoken of the new covenant, lays down
this as the principal thing,

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p4"></span>“I will pardon their iniquities,”
(<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p4.1"></span>[Jer
31:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#034.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxvi-p4.1"></span>)

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p5"></span>and he uses here the same verb. This
promise then ought not to be confined to that short time when the people
returned from their Babylonian exile, but ought on the contrary to be
extended to the kingdom of Christ, for it was then that this prophecy
was fully accomplished, because our sins do not appear before God when
he is reconciled to us.

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p6"></span>Yet the Prophet intimates that this
favor would not be general, for he adds that God would be propitious
only to the *remnant;* and it was needful to express this, because the
faithful after their return might have otherwise desponded, when they
saw that a few only of the people were restored. Had their restoration
been indiscriminately promised, the faith of the godly might have
faltered on seeing that almost the whole people disregarded the favor
offered to them; for a part only of the tribe of Judah availed
themselves of the kindness of Cyrus and Darius; and the ten tribes chose
rather to dwell in Chaldea and in other places. And it was not only once
that God restricted the promise given here; for it is said by Isaiah,

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p7"></span>“Were thy people as the sand of the
sea,  
a remnant only shall be saved.” (<span
id="ii.iii.xxvi-p7.2"></span>[Isa.
10:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxvi-p7.2"></span>)

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p8"></span>The people gloried in their number and
boasted of what had been said to Abraham,

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p9"></span>“Number if thou canst the stars of
heaven and the sand of the sea, so shall thy seed be.” (<span
id="ii.iii.xxvi-p9.1"></span>[Ge
15:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxvi-p9.1"></span>)

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p10"></span>God then shows that the Jews were
greatly mistaken when they thought that they would be always in a safe
state. Hence the Prophet says here that God would not be propitious
indiscriminately to all, but to those whom he would *make the remnant.*
And God also intimates that it was to be ascribed to his gratuitous
goodness that any remained alive, according to what is said in <span
id="ii.iii.xxvi-p10.1"></span>[Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxvi-p10.1"></span>,

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p11"></span>“Except some seed had been left to us,
we must have been as Gomorrah, and like to Sodom,”

<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p12"></span>God then declares here that the
remnant would not otherwise be saved than through his gratuitous mercy,
as Paul also says, that the Jews were not to hope for salvation, except
through the free mercy of God. (<span id="ii.iii.xxvi-p12.1"></span>[Ro
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxvi-p12.1"></span>.) And he especially noticed this passage
and similar passages, because the Jews then in opposing the Gospel
raised the objection, that they were the seed of Abraham, and the chosen
people; but Paul gave them this answer, that it was not a new thing that
God gathered a small remnant from his people; and he assigns as the
cause his gratuitous election. It now follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p2"></span>**21**. Go up against the land of
Merathaim, *even* against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod:
waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according
to all that I have commanded thee.

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p3"></span>**21**. Super terram exasperantium
ascende super eam *(sod abundat) et* super habitatores visitationis (et
habitatores visitationis;) occide et disperde post eos, dicit Jehova; et
fac omnia quae praecepi tibi.

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p6"></span>The Prophet here undertakes the office
of a herald, and animates the Persians and the Medes to make war with
Babylon. This prophecy indeed never came to these nations, but we have
stated why the Prophets proclaimed war and addressed at one time heathen
nations, at another time the Jews — now one people, then another; for
they wished to bring the faithful to the very scene of action, and
connected the accomplishment with their predictions. By this mode of
speaking, the Prophet then teaches us, that he did not scatter words
into the air, but that the power of God was connected with the word
which he spoke, as though God had expressly commanded the Medes and the
Persians to execute his vengeance on Babylon. And doubtless Jeremiah did
not thus speak; according to his own thoughts, nor did he thus speak in
the person of man; but on the contrary, he introduced God as the
speaker, as it appears front the end of the verse.

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p7"></span>He then says, *Ascend on the land of
the exasperating;* others read, “of bitterness,” but improperly. God
indeed calls the Chaldeans rebellious, for though they were for a time
the scourges of his wrath, they yet had cruelly treated many nations,
being impelled only by their own pride and avarice; he justly calls them
“the exasperating,” and then adds, *Slay the inhabitants of visitation*
Some regard <span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p7.1"></span>פקוד, *pekud,* as a
proper name; and they first imagine that it was a town of some note in
Chaldea, which is groundless; and then they give a frigid explanation by
saying that it was some mean and obscure place. There is then no doubt
but that the Prophet calls the Chaldeans the *inhabitants of
visitation,* because God’s vengeance awaited them, nay, it was even
suspended over their heads, as he afterwards declares. But this way of
speaking frequently occurs in the Prophets.  <span
id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md)

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p11"></span>He afterwards adds, *and destroy
after* or behind *them* There is an alliteration in the words <span
id="ii.iii.xxvii-p11.1"></span>החרם אתריהם, *etherem acheriem;* and he
means that the slaughter would be extreme, so that the Medes and
Persians would not cease to destroy until they had extinguished the name
of Babylon. Yet we know that this was not done by Cyrus and Darius; for
as we have already stated several times, the city was taken by fraud and
treachery in the night, and the king and the princes were slain, for
Darius, or rather Cyrus, spared the rest of the people; for though
Darius had the name of being king, yet Cyrus was by far the most
renowned, as he was a valiant soldier, and only on account of his fame
accompanied his father-in-law and uncle. As then the sword did not
destroy all the Chaldeans when Babylon was taken, we conclude that the
Prophets, when they denounced slaughter and destruction on Babylon, did
not confine what they said to that time, but included also other
slaughters; for Babylon was often taken. It revolted from the Persians;
and when it was recovered, it suffered very severe punishment; for, by
way of reproach, those who were first in power and authority were hung,
and there was also great cruelty exercised towards men and women. There
is no doubt then but that the Prophets, in speaking of the destruction
of Babylon, referred to God’s judgments inflicted at various times.
However this may have been, we learn that though God may long connive,
or suspend extreme judgments, yet the ungodly cannot possibly escape his
hand, though they may long be spared.

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p12"></span>He then adds, *Do to them as I have
commanded thee* This prophetic mode of speaking ought also to be
noticed; for the Medes and the Persians never thought that they fought
under the authority of God; why then is the word “commanded” used? even
because God rules by his secret power ungodly men, and leads them
wheresoever he pleases, though nothing of the kind is ever thought of by
them. To explain the matter more fully, we must observe flint God
commands in two ways; for he commands the faithful when he shows to them
what is right and what they ought to follow. Thus daily God may be said
to exercise his authority or right of ruling, when he exhorts us to do
our duty, when he sets his law before us. And it is the proper way of
commanding, or of exercising authority, when God expresses what he would
have us to do, or what he requires from us. But God commands the
unbelieving in another way; for though he does not declare to them what
he would have them to do, he yet draws them, willing or unwilling,
where-ever he pleases. Thus, by his secret operation, he induced Cyrus
and Darius to take up arms against Babylon.

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p13"></span>We now then understand what the
Prophet meant by this expression; for he did not mean that Darius and
Cyrus obeyed God from the heart, because they knew not that he was the
leader and author of that war; no such thing ever entered into their
minds. The former mode of commanding, as I have said, is peculiar to the
Church; for God is pleased to bestow on us a peculiar privilege and
favor, when he shows to us what is right, and prescribes the rule of
life. But yet his hidden providence, by which he influences the ungodly,
takes the place of a command, as it is said,

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p14"></span>“The king’s heart is in the hand of
God.” (<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p14.1"></span>[Pr
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro021.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxvii-p14.1"></span>)

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p15"></span>But Solomon speaks of a king rather
than of common men, because, if there be any liberty among mankind, it
belongs to kings, for they seem exempt from every yoke; and Solomon
declares that the hearts of kings are ruled by God. Though then Darius
and Cyrus were carried away by their own cupidity when they made war,
yet God, as we shall hereafter see more clearly, guided their hearts. So
also he is said to command the heavens and the earth-not that the
heavens, being without ears and reason, hear his voice, but because God
powerfully moves and influences the heavens; for when he intends to
punish us, he commands the heaven not to rain. This command of God the
heaven executes, and the earth also obeys God; but there is no word of
command given to them, — what then? it is God’s providence which is hid
from us. It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxviii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxviii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#022.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxviii-p2"></span>**22**. A sound of battle *is* in the
land, and of great destruction.

<span id="ii.iii.xxviii-p3"></span>**22**. Vox praelii in terra et
contritio magna.

<span id="ii.iii.xxviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxviii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxviii-p6"></span>The Prophet continues the same style
of speaking, for he says that there would be *the voice* or the sound
*of battle* Could he rouse up the Medes and the Persians? not indeed by
his own power, but here he exalts the efficacy of his doctrine; as
though he had said, that the vengeance he denounced on the Babylonians
would be in readiness when the time came, as Paul says that the
ministers of the gospel had vengeance ready at hand for all those who
despised it. We now then see why the Prophet mentions the word *battle,*
and says that *breaking,* or ruin, would be *great in the land.* It now
follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxix"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#023.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p2"></span>**23**. How is the hammer of the whole
earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among
the nations!

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p3"></span>**23**. Quomodo excisus est et
contritus malleus universes terrae? quomodo redacta est (fuit) in
vastitatem Babylon inter gentes?

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p4"></span>**24**. I have laid a snare for thee,
and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art
found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p5"></span>**24**. Illaqueavi to, atque etiam

nescivisti; inventa es atque adeo deprehensa, quoniam contra Jehovam to
miscuisti (litigasti.)

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p6"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p7"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p8"></span>Here, in the first place, Jeremiah asks
in astonishment how it happened that *the hammer of the whole earth was
broken,* when it had before broken all nations. God afterwards gives an
answer, even because “I am he who have taken Babylon.” The question
availed to rouse the people to a greater attention. We neglect God’s
judgments or are blind to them, even because we do not carefully
consider them; for little things often excite us, when that which God
works in an unusual manner is deemed by us as nothing. As then our
apathy as to the works of God is so great, it is necessary to stimulate
us. And this is what is done now by Jeremiah, when he says in
astonishment, *How?* for he intimates that to cut down Babylon would be
incredible, for no one could have thought that that monarchy could have
ever fallen; for it had arrived to the highest *eminence,* and was
surrounded on all sides by so many fortresses, that no danger could be
feared. In short, all thought that Babylon could not be endangered
without a concussion of heaven and earth.

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p9"></span>Then the Prophet here wonders at a
thing unusual, and says, *How is the hammer of all the earth broken and
shattered to pieces?*  <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md) and then,
*How has Babylon become a waste among the nations?* for it had
subjugated to itself not only the neighboring nations, but the remotest
parts of the earth. And in this manner he animated the faithful to
entertain hope, lest they should despond, for the power of that monarchy
was terrible.

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p13"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxix-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p14"></span>He then immediately answers in the
person of God, *I have ensnared thee, and therefore thou Babylon art
taken* Here God declares, that though it could not be possible that
Babylon and its empire should fall through human means, yet its
destruction was in his hand. *Thou,* he says, *art taken,* even because
*I ensnared thee;* as though he had said, that the Chaldeans would not
have to do with men, because he himself would carry on the war and guide
and direct the Persians and the Medes, and also endue them with power:
He would, in short, fight himself until he had overcome the Babylonians.

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p15"></span>When he says, *thou knewest not,* he
not only reproves the insensibility of that people, but at the same time
derides their security, as though he had said, “Thou thinkest thyself
beyond the reach of harm, but thou wilt find that no one can escape my
hand.” We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet. It is indeed
true that the unbelieving, when God punishes them for their wickedness,
do not acknowledge his hand; but the Prophet means another thing, — that
though Babylon trusted in its strength and feared nothing, it would yet
be taken, because it could not evade the snares.

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p16"></span>He adds, *Thou art found and therefore
caught;* and he states the reason, because she had *contended* with God.
We shall presently explain how Babylon contended or litigated with or
against God, even because God had taken under his protection and
patronage the Israelites. This, then, is said with reference to the
Church, as I shall presently explain more at large. It must be here
briefly observed, that God so undertakes the cause of his people, as
though he himself were injured, according to what he promises that they
would be to him as the apple of his eye. (<span
id="ii.iii.xxix-p16.1"></span>[Zec
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/zac002.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxix-p16.1"></span>.) It now follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxx"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxx-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxx-p2"></span>**25**. The LORD hath opened his
armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this
*is* the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.

<span id="ii.iii.xxx-p3"></span>**25**. Aperuit Jehova thesaurum suum,
et protulit vasa irae suae, quia opus hoc Domini, Jehovae exercituum,
est in terra Chaldaeorum.

<span id="ii.iii.xxx-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxx-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxx-p6"></span>The Prophet here expresses more clearly
what he bad touched upon, even that this war would not be that of the
Persians, but of God himself. He then says, that God had *opened his
treasure,* even because he has various and manifold ways and means,
which cannot be comprehended by men, when he resolves to destroy the
ungodly. That monarchy was impregnable according to the judgment of men;
but God here says that he had hidden means by which he would lay waste
Babylon and reduce it to nothing. Then what is by a similitude called
the *treasure* of God, means such a way as surpasses the comprehension
of men, that is, when God executes his judgments in a way hidden and
unexpected.

<span id="ii.iii.xxx-p7"></span>As, then, the faithful could hardly
conceive what Jeremiah said, he raises up their thoughts to God’s
providence, which ought not to be subjected to human judgment; for it is
absurd in men to judge of God’s power according to the perceptions of
the flesh; it is the same as though they attempted to include heaven and
earth in the hollow of their hand. God himself says, that he takes
heaven and earth in the hollow of his hand. When, therefore, men seek to
comprehend the power of God, it is like a fly attempting to devour all
the mountains. Hence the Prophet reproves this presumption to which we
are all by nature inclined, even to determine according to the
comprehension of our minds what God is about or ought to do, as though
his power were not infinite.

<span id="ii.iii.xxx-p8"></span>This is the reason why the Prophet says,
God *hath opened his treasury;* and then, *he hath thence brought forth
the instruments of his wrath,* that is, from his treasury, even in a way
and manner which was then incomprehensible.  <span
id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) And subjoined is the reason, *Because
this is the work of God* alone, *the God of hosts, in the land of the
Chaldeans*  <span id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) Here the Prophet
briefly concludes, intimating, that the faithful ought quietly to wait
until what he taught came to pass, even because it was the work of God.
And there is nothing more absurd than for men to seek to measure God’s
power, as it has been said, by their own judgment. It follows, — but I
cannot explain the verse now.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxi"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="ii.iii.xxxi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou
hast been pleased to set before us thy judgments on the unbelieving, we
may not only fear thee, but also learn to cast on thee the hope of our
salvation, so that we may make progress in the truth, that we may
neither be insensible as to thy threatenings, nor tremble in our extreme
evils, but so learn to raise up to thee our eyes, that we may, during
the whole course of our life, call on thee through Christ Jesus our

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p1"></span><span

50:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#026.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p2"></span>**26**. Come against her from the
utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy
her utterly: let nothing of her be left.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p3"></span>**26**. Venite contra eam a fine,
aperite apothecas ejus, calcate earn tanquam acervos, et disperdite eam,
ne sint ei reliquiae.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p6"></span>The Prophet again addresses the
Persians and the Medes, and encourages them to come against Babylon. We
stated yesterday that the prophets are went to speak with authority,
because they sustained the person of God; and we mentioned how necessary
this mode of speaking was, for the world does not acknowledge that God
speaks effectually.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p7"></span>Then he says first, *Come ye against
her;*  <span id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md) and then, *Open her
storehouses* The word <span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p8.2"></span>מאבס,
*meabes,* means a cornhouse or a repository of any kind: hence some
render it *“granaries.”* But it seems to me that the word is thus too
much restricted, for the Prophet no doubt speaks of the treasures of
Babylon. Now storehouses, *(apothecas,)* the Greeks call those
repositories which contain all sorts of things, not only wine and oil,
but goods of merchants, and also money. We call them in French,
*Arrieres-boutiques,* or, *magasins.* But this word is to be extended to
wine, to every kind of fruit, and then to treasures, and also to arms;
for they were repositories of arms, of weapons of every kind. It is the
same as though Jeremiah had said, that nothing would be so hidden among
the Chaldeans but that the Medes and the Persians would find it out.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p9"></span>He then adds, *Tread her as heaps.*
The word <span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p9.1"></span>ערמים, *oremim,* means not
heaps of stones, but on the contrary, of sheaves. Then he intimates that
the Persians and the Medes would act cruelly, and tread them as corn is
trodden on the floor.  <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md) He lastly
says, *Destroy her utterly, that there way be to her no remnant* He
seems indirectly to set this in contrast with what God promised always
to his people, that there would be some remnant, he then says that
nothing would remain when God had executed his vengeance on the
Chaldeans. The sum of what is said is, that the punishment of which the
Prophet speaks would be such as would obliterate the very name of the
Babylonian monarchy. This, as we said yesterday and also previously, was
not completed in one day. But when the Prophets speak of God’s
judgments, they do not regard only the preludes, but their words extend
to the last judgment that awaits all the reprobate. It now follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiv"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#027.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p2"></span>**27**. Slay all her bullocks; let
them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the
time of their visitation.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p3"></span>**27**. Occidite omnes juvencos ejus;
descendant ad mactationem: vae illis! quia venit dies eorum, tempus
visitationis eorum.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p6"></span>He goes on with the same subject; he
bids the Persians and the Medes to slay every strong man in Chaldea; for
by *bullocks* he no doubt means by a metaphor all those who excelled in
strength, or in power, or in wealth. The sum of what he says is, that
the vengeance of which he now speaks, would not only be against the
common people, but also against the highest and the choicest among them.
He includes then the nobles as well as all the men of war; for he refers
not only to strength of body, but also to power and authority.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p7"></span>*Slay,* then, he says, *all her
bullocks,* that is, whatever is most valued in Chaldea: that was to
perish when the day of vengeance came.  <span
id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md) He afterwards says, *let them descend to
the slaughter* We must ever bear in mind what I have said, that the
Prophet gave orders as though he had the Medes and the Persians under
his own hand and authority, because the whole world is subject to God’s
word. He says, *Woe to them! for their day is come, and the time of
their visitation* This was added, because the faithful might have
disputed with themselves and said, “How can it be that Babylon should
perish so quickly?” For God seemed to have favored that monarchy for a
long time, as though he intended to protect it perpetually. Hence the
Prophet speaks here of the time of visitation, so that the faithful
might not doubt respecting this prophecy, because God had not as yet put
forth his band. He then reminded them that God has his fixed times, and
that he does not every day visit nations, that is, that he does not
execute his judgments every moment, but at the time which he has
appointed. Whenever, then, the ungodly securely exult and triumph, let
us ever remember this truth, that the time is not yet come for God to
execute his judgment; how so? because there is a fixed time of
visitation, and that is dependent on God’s will. Let us then learn to
bear patiently all our trials until it shall please God to show that he
is the judge of the world. It follows,—

<span id="ii.iii.xxxv"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxv-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#028.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxv-p2"></span>**28**. The voice of them that flee and
escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of
the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxv-p3"></span>**28**. Vox fugientium et qui evaserint
e terra Babylonis ad annuntiandum in Sion vindictam Jehovae Dei nostri,
vindictam templi ejus.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxv-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxxv-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxxv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxv-p6"></span>The Prophet again shows, that God in
punishing Babylon, would give a sure proof of his favor towards his
Church. For this prophecy would have been uninteresting to the faithful,
did they not know that God would be an enemy to that great monarchy,
because he had undertaken the care of their safety. Then the Prophet
often calls the attention of the faithful to this fact, that God’s
vengeance on the Babylonians would be to them a sure proof of God’s
favor, through which he had once embraced them, and which he would
continue to show to them to the end.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxv-p7"></span>This, then, was the design of the
Prophet, when he said, *The voice officers and of those who escape from
the land of Babylon,* etc.; as though he had said, “Babylon is on many
accounts worthy of destruction, but God in destroying it will have a
regard to his own people, and will effectually show that he is the
Father of the people whom he has adopted.” Jeremiah afterwards exhorts
the faithful to show their gratitude. There are here, then, two things;
the first is, that when God destroyed Babylon, the people would hence
with certainty perceive how dear they were to God; and secondly, from
this truth flows an exhortation, that the faithful were not to be mute
at such a singular benefit of God, but were to proclaim their
deliverance. Hence he says, *The voice of fleers and of those who escape
from the land of Babylon, to announce in Sion,* etc. By saying *in
Sion,* he shows for what end God intended to gather his people, even
that he might again be worshipped as formerly-in his own Temple.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxv-p8"></span>He adds, *to announce in Sion the
vengeance of our God* The vengeance of God is to be taken here in an
active sense, signifying the vengeance which God would execute. The
vengeance of the Temple, which immediately follows, is to be taken
passively, as meaning the vengeance by which God would avenge the
indignity offered to the Temple. God then takes vengeance, and God’s
Temple is defended from contempt and reproach.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxv-p9"></span>We now then see the meaning of this
passage. The Prophet first teaches us, that God would have a regard to
his people in so rigidly punishing Babylon; and secondly, he adds an
exhortation, lest the faithful should be unthankful to God, but
acknowledge that God, for the sake of their deliverance had undertaken
war against that monarchy; and lastly, he shows the end, even that the
people who had been scattered, as it is said in <span
id="ii.iii.xxxv-p9.1"></span>[Ps
147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxv-p9.1"></span>,

<span id="ii.iii.xxxv-p10"></span>“God is he who gathers the dispersed
of Israel,”

<span id="ii.iii.xxxv-p11"></span>might again be collected together. As,
then, the Jews were as a mutilated body among the Chaldeans, the Prophet
shows that that monarchy would be dispersed, in order that the faithful
might again be gathered, and that all might worship God together in the
Temple, or on mount Sion. It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#029.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p2"></span>**29**. Call together the archers
against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about;
let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according
to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against
the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p3"></span>**29**. Convocate contra Babylonem
potentes, omnes qui intendunt arcum; obsidete earn in circuitu, ne sit
evasio; reddite ei secundum opus suum, secundum omnia quae fecit facite
ei; quia contra Jehovam superb egit, contra sanctum Israelis.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p6"></span>The Prophet adopts various modes of
speaking, and not without reason, because he had to thunder rather than
to speak; and then as he spoke of a thing incredible, there was need of
no common confirmation; the faithful also, almost pining away in their
miseries, could hardly entertain any hope. This is the reason why the
Prophet dwells so long and so diffusely on a subject in itself not
obscure, for there was not only need of amplifying, but also of great
vehemence.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p7"></span>Then, as though he had many heralds
ready to obey, he says, *Call together the mighty against Babylon* Some
read “many,” but the word <span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p7.1"></span>רבים*,
rebim,* means both; and I think that “the mighty” or strong are meant
here. Why some render it “arrows” I know not. It is, indeed, immediately
added, *all who bend the bow,* <span
id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p7.2"></span>כל-דרכי קשת*, caldereki koshet.* But the
word, without anything added to it, never means an arrow. They refer to
a place in <span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p7.3"></span>[Ge
21:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p7.3"></span>, where Ishmael is said to be “an archer,”
<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p7.4"></span>רבה, *rebe;* but the word “bow”
follows it. We cannot then take <span
id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p7.5"></span>רבים, *rebim* here but as signifying many
or the mighty; and the latter is the most suitable word. Then the
Prophet bids the strong and the warlike to come together, and then he
mentions them specifically*,* — *all who bend the bow,* even all
skillful archers. For the Persians excelled in this art, they were
archers of the first order. It was indeed a practice common among
eastern nations, but the Persians surpassed all others. The Prophet then
points them out when he bids *archers* to assemble.  <span
id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md)

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p11"></span>He adds, *encompass* or besiege *her
around, that there may be no escape* This also was a thing difficult to
be believed, for Babylon was more like a country than a city. Then one
could have hardly thought that it could have been besieged around and at
length taken, as it happened. Therefore the Prophet here testifies that
what exceeded the opinion of all would take place. But he had said
before that this would be the work of God, that the faithful might not
form a judgment according to their own measure, for nothing is more
absurd, as it has been said, than to measure the power of God by our own
understanding. As then the Prophet had before *declared* that the siege
of Babylon would be the work of God, he bids them now, with more
*confidence,* to *besiege it around, that there might not be an escape*

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p12"></span>It is then added, *Render to her
according to her work; according to what she has done, do to her* By
these words the Prophet shows that the vengeance which God would execute
on the Chaldeans would be just, for nothing is more equitable than to
render to one what he had done to others.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p13"></span>“With what measure ye mete to
others,” says Christ, “it shall be rendered to you.” (<span
id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p13.1"></span>[Lu
6:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#038.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p13.1"></span>)

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p14"></span>As, then, nature itself teaches us
that the punishment is most just which is inflicted on the cruel
themselves, hence the Prophet reminds us here that God would be a just
avenger in his extreme violence against the Babylonians. But he looks
farther, for he assumes this principle, that God is the judge of the
world. Since he is so, it follows that they who unjustly oppress others
must at length receive their own reward; as also Paul says, that the
judgment of God, otherwise obscure, will be made evident, when he shall
give relief and rest to the miserable who are now unjustly afflicted,
and when he shall render their reward to oppressors. (<span
id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p14.1"></span>[2 Thess.
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p14.1"></span>.) The Prophet then takes occasion of
confidence from this truth to animate the faithful and to encourage them
to entertain hope. How so? Since God is the judge of the world, the Jews
ought to have considered what sort of people the Babylonians had been;
nay, they had already sufficiently experienced how cruel and barbarous
they were. As, then, the avarice and cruelly of the Chaldeans were
sufficiently apparent, the Prophet here reminds them, that as God is in
heaven, it could not be otherwise but that he would shortly call them to
judgment, for otherwise he would not be God. Surely he would not be the
judge of the world, were he not to regard the miserable unjustly
oppressed, and bring them help, and stretch forth his hand to relieve
them; and were he not also, on the other hand, to punish the avaricious
and the proud and the cruel. We now understand the meaning of the
Prophet.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p15"></span>He adds, in the last place, *because
she has acted proudly against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel*
By saying that the Babylonians had *acted proudly,* he means that they
had not only been injurious to men, but had been also insolent towards
God himself; for the verb here used denotes a sin different from that
which happens through levity or want of thought. When any one sins
inconsiderately, he is said to have erred; but when one sins knowingly,
it is a deliberate wickedness, and he is said to be proud; and this we
learn from <span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p15.1"></span>[Ps
19:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#012.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p15.1"></span>; for David there sets pride in
opposition to errors:

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p16"></span>“errors,” he says, “who can
understand?”

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p17"></span>and then he asks God to cleanse him
from all pride. David indeed had not designedly raised his horns against
God, but he yet feared lest the wantonness of the flesh should lead him
to pride. When, therefore, the Prophet now says that the Chaldeans had
*acted proudly towards God,* it is the same as though he accused them of
sacrilegious pride, even that they designed to be insolent towards God
himself, and not only cruel to his people.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p18"></span>But an explanation follows, *against
the Holy One of Israel* The Babylonians might have raised an objection,
and said, that it was not their purpose to act proudly towards God. But
the Prophet here brings forward the word *Israel,* as though he had
said, “If there be a God in heaven, our religion is true; then God’s
name dwells with us. Since, then, the Babylonians have basely oppressed
the people whom God has chosen, it follows that they have been
sacrilegious towards him.” And he meant the same thing when he said
before, *the vengeance of Jehovah our God* Why did he add, *our God?*
that the Jews might know that whatever wrongs they had suffered, they
reached God himself, as though he were hurt in his own person. So also
in this place the Prophet takes away from the Babylonians all means of
evasion when he says, that they had *acted proudly towards the Holy One
of Israel* When, therefore, the ungodly seek evasions and say that they
do not contend with God, their pretenses are disproved, when they carry
on war with his Church, and fight, against his faithful people, whose
safety he has undertaken to defend. For God cannot be otherwise the
protector of his Church than by setting himself up as a shield in its
defense whenever he sees his people unjustly attacked by the reprobate.
It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#030.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvii-p2"></span>**30**. Therefore shall her young men
fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that
day, saith the LORD.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvii-p3"></span>**30**. Propterea cadent electi ejus
*(vel,* adolescentes,) in plateis ejus, et omnes viri militiae ejus
*(hoc est,* omnes viri bellicosi) redigentur ad silentium *(alii
vertunt,* compescentur; nam <span id="ii.iii.xxxvii-p3.1"></span>דמם
significat utrumque) in die illo, dicit Jehova.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxxvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvii-p6"></span>He confirms the same thing, and shows
that the destruction of Babylon would be such, that everything valuable
would be destroyed. *Fall,* he says, *shall her strong men in the
streets;* which is worse than if he had said, “They shall fall in
battle.” Babylon was so taken that all her armed men were slain in the
middle of the city. Cyrus indeed spared, as it has been already said,
the common people; but he slew all the chief men and the armed soldiers.
As the Babylonians were taken while keeping a feast, as we read in
Daniel, hence Jeremiah mentions *the streets.* He afterwards adds, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxxviii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxviii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxviii-p2"></span>**31**. Behold, I *am* against thee,
O *thou* most proud, saith the Lord GOD, of hosts: for thy day is come,
the time *that* I will visit thee.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxviii-p3"></span>**31**. Ecce ego contra to, superbe,
dicit Dominus Jehova exercituum quia venit dies tuus, tempus
visitationis tuae.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxxviii-p5"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxxviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxviii-p6"></span>Jeremiah, in order more fully to
confirm what he had said, again introduces God as the speaker. And we
have stated how necessary this was, because he could have hardly gained
credit otherwise to his prophecy; but when he introduced God, he removed
every doubt. *Behold,* he says, *I am against thee, O proud one* He
again calls the Babylonians *proud,* even because they had not been led
to war by levity or folly, or vain ambition, but because they had
assailed God and men without any reverence and without any regard to
humanity.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxviii-p7"></span>He says that the *time had come,*
because the faithful would have otherwise interrupted him and said, “How
is this, that God so long delays?” That they might then sustain and
cherish hope until the time which God had prescribed for his vengeance,
he says, that the *day had come, and the time of visitation* Whenever
this mode of speaking occurs, let us know that all the natural instincts
of our flesh are checked; for there is no one of us who does not
immediately jump to take vengeance when we see the faithful oppressed,
when we see many unworthy things done to our brethren, when we see
innocent blood shed, and the miserable cruelly treated by the ungodly.
When, therefore, all these instances of barbarity happen, none of us can
contain himself; hence God puts on us a bridle, and exhorts us to
exercise patience, when he says, that the time of visitation is not yet
completed.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxviii-p8"></span>As long then as God delays, let us
know that the fit time is not yet come, because he has a fixed day of
visitation, unknown to us. It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxxix"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxix-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:32](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#032.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxix-p2"></span>**32**. And the most proud shall
stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire
in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxix-p3"></span>**32**. Et impinget superbus et cadet,
et nemo qui eum erigat; et accendam ignem in urbibus ejus, qui consumet
omnia quae sunt in circuitu (per circuitus ejus, *ad verbum.)*

<span id="ii.iii.xxxix-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xxxix-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xxxix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxix-p6"></span>The Prophet continues the same
subject: as then he had announced in God’s name that the time of
visitation would come when God would rise up against the Chaldeans, he
now adds, *stumble shall the proud, and fall* The verb <span
id="ii.iii.xxxix-p6.1"></span>כשל, *cashel,* means also to fall; but as
it is added, <span id="ii.iii.xxxix-p6.2"></span>ונפל*, vanuphel, and
fall,* it ought to be rendered *stumble* here. *Stumble,* then, *shall
the proud, and fall* — for the Prophet denotes a gradation. Some render
the words, “Fall shall the proud and tumble down:*”* but more suitable
is the rendering I have given, that the *proud would stumble,* and then
that he *would fall. And no one,* he says, *shall raise him up* By these
words, God intimates, that though Babylon had many nations under its
authority, yet there would be no help given to it, when the time of
visitation came. It indeed often happens that many busy themselves, and
make every effort to assist the wicked, but without any success. When,
therefore, God declares that there would be no one to raise up Babylon
when fallen, the meaning is not, that courage would be wanting to all,
but that the efforts of all would be of no avail, even because God, when
Babylon fell, would be against her, so that were the whole world to
unite for her relief, all their attempts would be useless.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxix-p7"></span>And for the same purpose, he adds, *I
will kindle a fire which will consume* or devour *all his cities* God
calls slaughter, by a metaphor, fire; for slaughter, like fire, raged so
as to consume the whole monarchy — not only the city, but also all the
neighboring nations — for the war reached even to Asia. Cyrus, as it is
well known, passed over the sea and depopulated Phrygia. In short,
though victory might have been mild, yet it was no doubt like fire, as
it devoured all the neighboring nations. It follows,—

<span id="ii.iii.xl"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xl-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:33-34](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#033.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xl-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p2"></span>**33**. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; the
children of Israel and the children of Judah *were* oppressed together:
and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them
go.

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p3"></span>**33**. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum,
Oppressi fuerunt filii Israel et filii Jehudah pariter; et omnes qui
captivos ceperunt praevaluerunt contra ipsos, et renuerunt ipsos
dimittere.

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p4"></span>**34**. Their Redeemer *is* strong; the
LORD of hosts *is* his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that
he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p5"></span>**34**. Redemptor (inquit) eorum fortis,
Jehova exercituum nomen ejus; litem litigando litigabit, (hoc est,
disceptando disceptabit causam ipsorum,) ut terram ipsam reddat
tranquillam, (ut alii vetrunt, sed ego potius ita interpretor, ut terram
scindat,) et contremiscere faciat habitatores Babylonis.

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p6"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p7"></span><span id="ii.iii.xl-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p8"></span>Our Prophet returns again to his former
subject — that God, in destroying the Babylonian monarchy, would have a
regard to his chosen people. But the comparison made here is very
important; for in the first place, the Prophet refers to an occasion of
diffidence and even of despair, which might have closed up the way
against all his prophecies. For this objection might have always been
made, “We are driven into exile, we are in a far country, and in places
distant from one another; it is the same as though we were in another
world, and we can hardly move a foot without our conquerors being
enraged against us.” Thus the Jews, according to the aspect of things at
that time, could not otherwise than despair of returning to their own
country. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet says here, by way of
concession, “It is, indeed, true that the children of Judah and the
children of Israel are oppressed with cruel tyranny:” as when we wish to
secure faith, we state what seems to be opposed to us, and then
dissipate it; so now the Prophet does in this place, as though he had
said, “I see what his own mind may dictate to every one, even that the
children of Judah, as well as the children of Israel, are held captive,
and shut up by such fastnesses that no way of escape is open to them.”

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p9"></span>When he speaks of the children of Israel
and of the children of Judah, we must remember that the ten tribes had
been led into exile, and also that the whole kingdom had been destroyed;
and at length, after a considerable time, the Chaldeans took possession
also of the kingdom of Judah. Hence then it was, that both the
Israelites and the Jews became subject to a cruel oppression. He
therefore adds, *They who led them captive have prevailed,* or, as some
render the last word, “have held them;” for <span
id="ii.iii.xl-p9.1"></span>חזק*, chesek,* means to hold, to lay hold;
but the Prophet seems to mean another thing, even that their conquerors
so prevailed as securely to rule over them; and hence it is added, *they
have refused to let them go;* and we learn the same thing from the next
verse, in which the strength and power of God is set in opposition to
the power of their enemies. As far as things appeared to men, there was
certainly no way of deliverance for the people. The Prophet then
concedes what might have taken away every hope from them.

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p10"></span><span id="ii.iii.xl-p10.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p11"></span>But he immediately after removes this
ground of despair, and says, *Their redeemer is strong* He then sets
this *strong,* <span id="ii.iii.xl-p11.1"></span>חזק, *chesek,* in
opposition to the verb used before, *“prevailed”* or ruled, <span
id="ii.iii.xl-p11.2"></span>החזיקו בם, *echesiku beem,* “prevailed” or
domineered “over them*,*” so that they were stronger. But now, on the
other hand, he calls the *Redeemer of Israel strong;* for were you only
to consider, he seems to say, how great the power of Babylon is, you
might despond; but can God, in the meantime, do nothing? Is there any
power on earth which can overrule him? Since then their redeemer was
strong, he would prove superior to the Chaldeans.

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p12"></span>He afterwards adds what is of the same
import, *His name is Jehovah of hosts;* that is, neither Babylon nor all
other nations have so much power as can resist the infinite power of
God, for he is always like himself, and perfect; he is the God of hosts.
He at length adds, *Their strife by litigating he will litigate,* or, by
pleading he will plead the cause of his people, even so as to *cut off*
or destroy *the land* The verb, <span id="ii.iii.xl-p12.1"></span>רגע,
*rego,* means indeed sometimes to rest, and so almost all give this
rendering, “so as to make to rest the land:” but as I take “land” and
“the inhabitants of Babylon” to be the same, I doubt not but that this
verb is to be taken here in its proper sense. Then it is, *so as to cut
off or destroy the land,*  <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) *and to
make to tremble the inhabitants of Babylon. H*e then speaks of the
Chaldeans in mentioning the land, and afterwards explains himself by
adding, the inhabitants of Babylon.

<span id="ii.iii.xli"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xli-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="ii.iii.xli-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that, as thou hast
deigned once to take us under thy protection, we may always raise up our
eyes to thine infinite power, and that when we see all things not only
confounded, but also trodden under foot by the world, we may not yet
doubt but that thy power is sufficient to deliver us, so that we may
perpetually call on thy name, and with firm constancy so fight against
all temptations, that we may at length enjoy in thy celestial kingdom
the fruit of our victory, through Jesus Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="ii.iii.xliii-p2"></span>**35**. A sword *is* upon the
Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon
her princes, and upon her wise *men.*

<span id="ii.iii.xliii-p3"></span>**35**. Gladius super Chaldaeos, et
super habitatores Babylonis, et super principes ejus, et super sapientes
ejus.

<span id="ii.iii.xliii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xliii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xliii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xliii-p6"></span>THE Prophet proceeds with the same
subject, and employs the same manner of speaking. He denounces war on
the Chaldeans as a celestial herald; and then that what he says might
have more force and power, he sets the Persians and the Medes before us
in the act of assailing and destroying Babylon. He therefore says now in
general, *A sword on the Chaldeans;* and, secondly, he mentions the
*inhabitants of Babylon,* for that city was the seat and head of the
kingdom, as it is well known; but as the power of that monarchy was
deemed by men unassailable, the Prophet adds, that though the chief men
excelled in counsel and strength, and in the art of war, yet a *sword
would be* upon them; and in the last place, that though Babylon had its
diviners, their knowledge would yet be in vain. He, indeed, uses an
honorable name, yet he no doubt refers to astrologers and soothsayers,
and other kinds of prophets. For we know that the whole nation was given
to many superstitions; but they boasted themselves to be the chief of
all astrologers; and hence soothsayers, who practice their impostures,
are called Chaldeans, and it was formerly a common designation.

<span id="ii.iii.xliii-p7"></span>Then the Prophet means, that neither
power nor warlike skill, nor knowledge of any kind, would be a defense
to the Chaldeans, nor the arts in which they gloried, even though they
thought that they were familiarly acquainted with God; for by the stars
they were wont to divine whatever was to be. It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xliv"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xliv-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xliv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#036.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xliv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xliv-p2"></span>**36**. A sword *is* upon the liars;
and they shall dote: a sword *is* upon her mighty men; and they shall be
dismayed.

<span id="ii.iii.xliv-p3"></span>**36**. Gladius super divinos ejus, et
infatuabuntur; gladius super fortes ejus, et conterentur (vel,
expavescent.)

<span id="ii.iii.xliv-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xliv-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xliv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xliv-p6"></span>He repeats the same thing, but in other
words; and in the first clause he mentions diviners whom he before
called wise men; and he calls them now by their true and proper name;
for <span id="ii.iii.xliv-p6.1"></span>בדים*, bedim,* mean mendacious
men as well as falsehoods. He then calls those now impostors to whom he
conceded before the name of wise men. But when he called them wise men,
he spoke according to the common opinion, and he was unwilling to
contend with the Chaldeans as to the character of their wisdom: he,
however, at the same time made known the impositions of those who
boasted that they had a familiar intercourse with God and angels, whilst
they pronounced by the stars what was to be.  <span
id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) That art itself is indeed worthy of
praise, were men to preserve moderation. But as the curiosity of men is
insatiable, so they wandered here and there, and overleaped all limits,
and thus perverted the whole order of nature. The Chaldeans, then, were
not genuine, but, on the contrary, spurious astrologers.

<span id="ii.iii.xliv-p8"></span>This is the reason why the Prophet
calls them now liars; for we have before seen, that it was a mere
imposition, when the Chaldeans held that the whole life of man is
subject to the influence of the stars. Hence he exhorted the faithful to
fear no dangers from the stars. It is then no wonder that the Prophet
now charges all the diviners with falsehoods, who yet proudly arrogated
to themselves the name of wise men, *they shall be infatuated,* he says.
The verb <span id="ii.iii.xliv-p8.1"></span>יאל, *ial,* means indeed to
begin, but in *Niphal* it means to become foolish, or to be infatuated.
 <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md)

<span id="ii.iii.xliv-p10"></span>Then he says, *The sword shall be on
her valiant men;* whom before he called chief men or princes, <span
id="ii.iii.xliv-p10.1"></span>שרים*, sherim,* he now calls strong, <span
id="ii.iii.xliv-p10.2"></span>גברים, *geberim,* or those who excelled in
valor. The amount of the whole is, — that whatever wisdom Babylon
arrogated to itself would become folly, and that the valor in which it
prided, would vanish away. For he says, that they would *be broken in
pieces* The verb <span id="ii.iii.xliv-p10.3"></span>חתת, *chetat,*
means to be broken, but as we have elsewhere seen, it is often applied
to the mind, and then it means to dread, or to be terrified. He then
says, that the valiant would not be able to stand when the sword was
upon them, for they would become, as it were, lifeless, or, at least,
they would become so effeminate as to think of nothing but flight.

<span id="ii.iii.xlv-p2"></span>**37**. A sword *is* upon their horses,
and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that *are* in

<span id="ii.iii.xlv-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xlv-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xlv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlv-p6"></span>The Prophet, indeed, changes the gender
of the pronouns, and seems to refer to the king; but there is no
ambiguity in the meaning, he then declares that the horses as well as
the chariots would perish; for the sword would consume all the things
used in war. And at the beginning he generally declared that destruction
was nigh all the Chaldeans, so he repeats the same now, *on all the
promiscuous multitude, which is in the midst* of Babylon. He says that
they would be without courage, for the Lord would dishearten them by
terror, as it will be hereafter stated again. Then he joins, *and on her
treasures, and they shall be a prey to* enemies. It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#038.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p2"></span>**38**. A drought *is* upon her waters;
and they shall be dried up: for it *is* the land of graven images, and
they are mad upon *their* idols.

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p3"></span>**38**. Siccitas super aquas ejus et
arescent; quia terra sculptilium est, et iis idolis *(proprie,* in
terroribus, *vel,* terriculamentis) gloriantur *(vel,* insaniunt.)

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p6"></span>Here the same word is used in a
different sense: he had often before used the word <span
id="ii.iii.xlvi-p6.1"></span>חרב, *chereb,* “sword;” but now by changing
only a point, he uses it in the sense of waste, or drought.  <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md) But as he mentions waters, the Prophet,
no doubt, means drought; nor was it without reason that he mentioned
this, because the Euphrates, as it is well known, flowed near the city,
and it was also divided into many streams, so that there were many
islands, as it were, made by the skill and hand of men. Thus the city
was in no ordinary way fortified, for it was difficult of access, being
on one side surrounded by so large a river: it had also trenches full of
water, and it had many channels. But Cyrus, as Xenophon relates, when
attempting to take the city, used the same contrivance, and imitated
those who had fortified Babylon, but for a different purpose; for he
diverted the streams, so that the river might be forded. Thus, then, he
dried up that great river, which was like a sea; so that Babylon was
taken with no great trouble. Cyrus, indeed, entered in by night, and
unexpectedly invaded Babylon, while they were securely feasting, and
celebrating a festival, as we find in the book of Daniel. However, the
way by which Cyrus contrived to take the city was, by dividing the
Euphrates into many streams. Hence it was, that the Prophet, in order
that the Jews might see, as it were, with their own eyes, spoke nothing
without reason, having not only predicted the slaughter and destruction
of the city, but showed also the very way in which it was done, as
though the event had been portrayed before them.

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p8"></span>The reason is added, *because it is the
land of carvings,* or gravings. God, indeed, took vengeance on Babylon
for other things, as it has before appeared; but the Prophet here speaks
of carvings, that the Israelites might know that there is no certain
salvation anywhere else except in the one true God, who had revealed
himself to them. Jeremiah, in short, means, that when any country is
destitute of God’s help, though it may excel in arms, in number, in
wealth, and in wisdom, yet everything under heaven is of no avail
without the blessing and favor of God. He has spoken of princes and of
wise men, and he has named chariots, horses, and treasures, — all these
have been mentioned for the purpose I have just stated, even to show,
that were we supplied with all that may seem necessary to defend us,
except God protected us, whatever the world may offer would be all in
vain; for we shall at length find, that without God neither arms, nor
chariots, nor wisdom nor counsel, nor any other helps, can avail us
anything.

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p9"></span>It follows, that Chaldea *gloried in
images* The word <span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p9.1"></span>אימים*, aimim,*
means terrors, and giants are called by this name in <span
id="ii.iii.xlvi-p9.2"></span>[De
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xlvi-p9.2"></span>, because they inspire terror by their
aspect. But this name is no doubt applied to images, because they are
only bugbears, *des epovantailz,* as we say in French.  <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) As then they are mere scarecrows, which
only frighten children, they are called <span
id="ii.iii.xlvi-p10.2"></span>אימים, *aimim.* And he says, that they
*gloried in,* or doted on them — for <span
id="ii.iii.xlvi-p10.3"></span>הלל, *elal,* means both, in *Hithpael,* as
it is found here. It means to boast or to elate one’s-self, and also to
be mad or to dote. Either sense would not be unsuitable to this place;
for the unbelieving gloried in their idols, and at the same time were
mad: yet the first meaning seems to me the best, that they *gloried in
their idols,* as it is said in <span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p10.4"></span>[Ps
47:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa047.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xlvi-p10.4"></span>,

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p11"></span>“Let them perish who trust in images
and glory in them.”

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p12"></span>Though the verb there is indeed
different, yet the meaning is the same.

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p13"></span>It was not, indeed, without reason,
that the Prophet reproaches the Chaldeans, that they gloried in their
idols, because they thereby robbed God of his honor; for what is
ascribed to idols is taken away from God. He intimates, in short, that
the Chaldeans would be justly punished as guilty of sacrilege, because
they had impiously transferred the glory of God to their own idols. And
this passage teaches us, that when God is purely worshipped among us,
and when true religion flourishes, it will be our best protection. We
shall then be more impregnable than if we had all the power and wealth
of the world: nothing can hurt us, if we give to God his due honor, and
strive to worship him in sincerity and truth. It now follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xlvii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#039.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p2"></span>**39**, Therefore the wild beasts of
the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell *there,* and
the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for
ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.

<span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p3"></span>**39**. Propterea habitabunt *aves*
sylvestres cum bestiis sylvestribus, et habitabunt filae struthionum;
nec habitabitur amplius in seculum; non erit (inquam) in habitationem
usque ad aetatem et aetatem.

<span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p6"></span>*The birds of the forest with the
beasts of the forest,* are rendered by some, “the satyrs with the
fairies;” but <span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p6.1"></span>איים, *aiim,* as well
as <span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p6.2"></span>ציים, *tsiim,* are, on the
contrary, birds or beasts of the forest. Some render <span
id="ii.iii.xlvii-p6.3"></span>איים, *aiim,* “cats ” I hold no
controversy as to these words — let there be a free judgment to every
one; but, as we have elsewhere seen, the Prophet means birds and beasts
of the forest, rather than satyrs and fairies. Then he adds, *the
daughters of the ostriches,* rendered by some “of the owls;” but about
this name also I will not contend. Some then render <span
id="ii.iii.xlvii-p6.4"></span>יענה, *ione,* “owl,” and refinedly explain
that “daughters” are mentioned, because these birds forsake their young,
when they howl through want or famine; but this is fictitious. I then
take the daughters of the ostriches or of the owls, according to the
usual manner of the language, to mean the very birds themselves.  <span
id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md)

<span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p8"></span>The Prophets usually speak thus, when
they give no hope. We have said before, that Babylon was not then so
laid waste, but that men dwelt there, who afterwards lived in great
luxury; for the city, under Cyrus and his son, was always populous; and
then, after its revolt, it was again inhabited; and when Alexander
subdued Asia, Babylon was full of people, and flourished in luxury and
wealth; and when he died there, he left the city very opulent. We hence,
then, conclude, that what Jeremiah declares here, was not immediately
fulfilled. But as the light or moderate punishments which the
unbelieving suffer now are certain preludes of final and eternal
destruction; so the Prophets, when speaking of God’s vengeance, ever
extend what they say to the last overthrow; and this also appears more
clearly from the next verse, where it is said, —

<span id="ii.iii.xlviii"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlviii-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#040.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlviii-p2"></span>**40**. As God overthrew Sodom and
Gomorrah and the neighbour *cities* thereof, saith the LORD; *so* shall
no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.

<span id="ii.iii.xlviii-p3"></span>**40**. Secundum subversionem Dei in
Sodomam et Gomorram et vicinos ejus, dicit Jehova, non habitabit illie
vir, et non morabitur in ea filius hominis.

<span id="ii.iii.xlviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xlviii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xlviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlviii-p6"></span>This verse confirms and explains the
previous verse. But that the design of the Prophet may be more evident,
we must remember what Jude in his epistle (<span
id="ii.iii.xlviii-p6.1"></span>[Jude
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xlviii-p6.1"></span>) says, that the destruction of Sodom is
as it were a mirror in which we behold God’s vengeance on all the
ungodly. God overthrew Sodom; but he does not proceed in the same way
with other lands and nations; yet the same is the lot of all the
unbelieving, of the despisers of God, and reprobates; for they are
exposed to his vengeance, which they cannot escape, though it may be for
a time suspended. When, therefore, the Prophet says now that Babylon
would be overthrown, as Sodom was overthrown, he does not mean that this
would be after seventy years, when taken by Cyrus and Darius, nor when
retaken after its revolt, nor when taken by Alexander; for it remained a
long time after this, even to the reign of Augustus Caesar. As, then, it
has been so, it follows that our Prophet does not speak of its first,
second, or third assault, but that he had in view what I have already
stated, — that when God summons the wicked to judgment, it is a certain
prelude of eternal and final destruction. His way with the godly is
another; for though God may sink them down to the grave, nay, to the
center of the earth, yet hope is still left them; hence their death is
never like the destruction of Sodom. And to the same purpose is what we
have already quoted from Isaiah,

<span id="ii.iii.xlviii-p7"></span>“Except a seed had been left us, we
should have been as Sodom, and like to Gomorrah.” (<span
id="ii.iii.xlviii-p7.1"></span>[Isa
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#009.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xlviii-p7.1"></span>)

<span id="ii.iii.xlviii-p8"></span>That exception shows the difference
between God’s children and the reprobate, even because he often delivers
them from ruin.

<span id="ii.iii.xlviii-p9"></span>We now then understand the Prophet’s
meaning when he says that Babylon would become desolate and solitary, so
that no *one would dwell there, nor remain;*  <span
id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) and that *from age to age,* or from
generation to generation.

<span id="ii.iii.xlviii-p11"></span>Moreover, we learn from what is here
said, that the unbelieving are overwhelmed with despair even under the
least punishment, because they see nothing but the vengeance of God; for
though God does not immediately slay them, yet the least puncture
denotes what impends over them; nay, he inflicts a deadly wound when he
seems only to touch them lightly. There is then only one consolation,
which can sustain us in our miseries, even to know that we are separated
from the Sodomites through the mercy of God alone; because we have
deserved the same destruction, and the Lord has spared us according to
his infinite goodness. This, then, is the meaning, It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.xlix"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlix-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.xlix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:41](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#041.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xlix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlix-p2"></span>**41**. Behold, a people shall come
from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up
from the coasts of the earth.

<span id="ii.iii.xlix-p3"></span>**41**. Ecce populus veniet ab
aquilone, et gens magna, et reges multi *(aut,* validi*)* excitabuntur a
lateribus terrae.

<span id="ii.iii.xlix-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.xlix-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.xlix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlix-p6"></span>The Prophet again shows whence
destruction was to come on the Babylonians. He does not indeed mention
Cyrus, as Isaiah does (<span id="ii.iii.xlix-p6.1"></span>[Isa.
44:28](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028.md), [Isa.
45:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xlix-p6.1"></span>), nor does he mention the Persians; but he
evidently points out the Medes, when he says that a *people* would *come
from the north* He adds, *a great nation and many* or powerful *kings;*
and lastly, *from the sides of the earth.* It is indeed certain that the
war was carried on under the banner and command of Cyrus and Darius.
Cyrus was the chief, but Darius, on account of his age, was deemed the
king. To whom then does Jeremiah refer, when he says *many kings,* if we
so render the words? even to the satraps or princes, of whom a great
number Darius brought with him; for Cyrus came from remote mountains,
and from a barbarous nation; but the kingdom of Darius was very wide.
There is then no doubt but that he brought with him many kings, who yet
obeyed his authority. But we may take <span
id="ii.iii.xlix-p6.2"></span>רבים, *rebim,* in the sense of being
strong. However this may be, the Prophet means that the Chaldeans would
have to carry on war, not with one nation or one king, but with many
nations and with many kings, or certainly with mighty kings. Hence he
mentions the *sides* of the earth, by which phrase he reminds us that
the army would come, not from one country but from remote parts; and
though the distance might be great, yet the Prophet says, that they
would all come together to attack the Chaldeans.

<span id="ii.iii.xlix-p7"></span>We now see that what afterwards
happened is represented as in a picture, in order that the event itself
might confirm the Jews, not only in the truth announced by Jeremiah, but
also in the whole law and worship of God; for this prophecy was ratified
to the faithful when they found that Jeremiah, a faithful interpreter of
the law, had thus spoken. And then his doctrine availed also for another
purpose, even that the people might know that they rebelled against God
when they obstinately resisted the holy Prophet; for we know that they
were extremely disobedient. They were then proved, by what happened, to
have been guilty of having contended with God in their pertinacious
wickedness and contempt. There was afterwards given them a sure ground
of hope; for as Jeremiah had spoken of the destruction of Babylon, so,
on the other hand, he had promised a return to the Jews. They had then
reason to look for restoration, when they saw fulfilled what Jeremiah
had spoken.

<span id="ii.iii.xlix-p8"></span>By the word *raised,* he expresses
something more than by the word *come:* he says that people would
*come,* and adds, that they would be *raised up* or roused; he intimates
that they would not come of themselves, but by the hidden influence of
God, because this war was not carried on merely by men. Cyrus indeed,
led by insatiable avarice and ambition, was guided by his own
inclination to undertake this war; and he made no end of his cruelty,
until he at length miserably died, for he never ceased to shed innocent
blood everywhere. But yet the Lord made use of these kings and nations
to destroy Babylon: they were in reality the scourges of God, and
accordingly he says, that they were *roused from the sides of the
earth,* that is, from the most distant places.

<span id="ii.iii.l-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.l-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.l-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.l-p6"></span>Jeremiah again speaks especially of armor,
to intimate that the Babylonians would not be able to sustain the
assault of their enemies. He then says that they would be armed with the
*bow* and the *shield*;  <span id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) and adds,
that they would be *cruel.* It is certain that the Persians were very
bloody; for it was a barbarous nation; and where barbarity rules, there
is no feeling of mercy. Cyrus indeed wished to appear a magnanimous
prince, and not a savage; but it is sufficiently evident that he was
very cruel, though Xenophon in his Life speaks of him otherwise; but he
is not a true historian, for he tells many false things in favor of
Cyrus. But when any one reads all that has been recorded, he will
readily find out that Cyrus was a barbarian, who delighted in slaughter
and carnage.

<span id="ii.iii.l-p8"></span>As to the Medes, they were given to
luxuries, and were not a warlike nation. Darius, however, brought with
him many princes, those whom he had overcome in uncultivated countries,
and such as also possessed some valor. Though, then, the king of the
Medes was effeminate as well as his people, yet he had with him many
warlike men. And the same thing is expressed also by Isaiah; and you
ought to compare this prophecy with that of Isaiah (<span
id="ii.iii.l-p8.1"></span>[Isa
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#017)<span id="ii.iii.l-p8.1"></span>.md)
for the two Prophets wholly agree, though Isaiah was dead when Jeremiah
uttered this prophecy and wrote it.

<span id="ii.iii.l-p9"></span>He says that *their voice* would be
*tumultuous as the sea,* or would sound or roar as the sea, when moved
by some violent storm. And all these things were said, that the
Babylonians might know that all their defenses would Be of no avail,
when God should arm the Persians and the Medes for their destruction.
For had that war been carried on only by men, the Chaldeans would have
never thought that their enemies would be victorious; and doubtless they
would have never been so, had not the Lord roused them and determined by
their means to execute vengeance on the Chaldeans. He says that they
would be *prepared as a man for war* Interpreters do not seem to me to
understand the meaning of the Prophet; for though Jeremiah uses the word
“prepared” in the singular number, yet he speaks of the whole people.
But how does he say they would be prepared? even *like a man* Here he
sets forth the union of the whole army, for they would all come to
battle, like one man attacking his own enemy. It is indeed difficult for
the minds of all to be so directed in battle, that they should unitedly
attack an enemy and fight as it were with one hand, and that they should
not look on one another, and yet make an united assault. This, then, is
what the Prophet means when he says, that they would be *prepared*
against the Chaldeans *as one man.*

<span id="ii.iii.l-p10"></span>He then adds, *against thee, daughter of
Babylon* He intimates that they would be not only sufficiently strong
against ordinary enemies, but also against the city itself. For had not
this been added, Babylon would have ever been considered as an
exception; for it was deemed impregnable on account of the multitude of
men, the height and breadth of its walls, its towers, and all other
defenses. Now, then, God shows that though Babylon proudly exulted in
its forces, and thought itself exempt from every danger, yet the
Persians and the Medes would possess sufficient power by which they
would easily overcome it. What follows I cannot finish today; it is
therefore better to stop here.

<span id="ii.iii.li-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou
teachest us by the example of the ungodly to fear thy name, we may learn
to submit our necks to thy word, and willingly, and as it becomes us,
submissively to receive thy yoke, that while we strive to glorify thy
name, being safe under thy protection, we may disregard all the attacks
of our enemies, and all the assaults and onsets of Satan, who is the
captain of all our enemies, until we shall at length enjoy our victory
in the celestial kingdom, through Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="ii.iii.liii-p3"></span>**43**. Audivit rex Babylonis famam

<span id="ii.iii.liii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.liii-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.liii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.liii-p6"></span>The Prophet means by these words, that
as soon as the report of war reached the Chaldeans, they would be so
disheartened through fear as to become like a conquered people. As they
had subjected to themselves many nations, they had acquired the name of
being a warlike people; but the Prophet declares here that they would
have no courage, and that therefore there would be no need of much valor
to attack them, as they would of themselves give way and flee. The sum
of what is said is, that the Persians and the Medes would gain the
victory before they fought, for there would be no need of an attack, as
their enemies would flee as being without any courage.

<span id="ii.iii.liii-p7"></span>The Prophet at the same time intimates
that in God’s hand are the hearts of men, as I have often said, so that
they who seem to excel in great boldness, melt as wax in a moment. For
no doubt the Chaldeans were not wanting in courage to fight until God
had rendered them effeminate, so that they took to flight through fear
as soon as they heard the report respecting their enemies. It is,
indeed, true that this was not immediately the case, for we know that
they had long sustained a siege, and that Belshazzar was slain in the
night, while they were securely and joyfully feasting as in the greatest
quietness and peace; but they were at length taken, so that they had
neither wisdom nor confidence; for the king and his princes were slain,
and the city was in a moment taken, as though all the men were turned
into logs of wood or into statues of stone. It follows,—

<span id="ii.iii.liv"></span>

quis electus quem super eam praeficiam? Quis enim similis mei? et quis
contestabitur mecum? et quis ille pastor qui consistat coram me *(vel,*
ad faciem meam)?

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.liv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p6"></span>We have explained nearly the same words
in the last chapter; for the Prophet not only used the same similitude
respecting the Humans, but also added all the words which are found
here; nay, the Prophet brings forward nothing new to the end of the
chapter, but only repeats what we have seen before.

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p7"></span>He first compares either Darius or Cyrus
to a lion, who, at, the overflowing of Jordan, removes to another place.
This passage, like the former, is indeed variously explained. Some read,
“for the pride of Jordan.” But as it appears from other places that
lions had their dens near the banks of Jordan, I have no doubt but that
the Prophet here compares Cyrus to, a lion, forced to leave his own lair
because of the inundation of that river. We know how savage a beast is
the lion; but, when he is forced to change his dwelling and to move to
another place, his fury rages the more. It is the same, then, as though
he had said, that not any sort of lion would attack the Babylonians, but
a lion furious through rage. He then adds, *to the strong habitation*
When he spoke of the Idumeans, the allusion might have been to their
country, which was elevated, and they had also mountains as their
fortresses. But as Babylon was also strongly fortified, and nearly
impregnable on account of fire various streams of the Euphrates, what
the Prophet says is also suitable, that *a lion* would *come,* though
there were hindrances which might impede his course; for when a lion
rambles, being not hungry nor forced by any necessity, he can turn here
and there as he pleases; but when rage drives and constrains him, he
will then surmount all obstacles. So also the Prophet says, that how
confident soever Babylon might be in its fortresses, yet Cyrus would
break through them, for he would be like a lion, who, at the overflowing
of Jordan, removes elsewhere, as he can no longer find his wonted
dwelling.

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p8"></span>We now perceive the meaning of the
words, — that the Babylonians would have to do, not with an idle but a
terrible enemy, and with one who would surmount all obstacles, as when
fury excites a lion when necessity drives him as it were headlong.

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p9"></span>What follows is obscure. Some render the
words thus, “When I shall make Israel to rest, then I will make them to
flee from her.” In the former place (<span
id="ii.iii.liv-p9.1"></span>[Jer
49:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.iii.liv-p9.1"></span>), we read “him,” in the singular, <span
id="ii.iii.liv-p9.2"></span>אריצנו, *aritsnu; but* here the Prophet uses
the plural number, “them,” <span id="ii.iii.liv-p9.3"></span>אריצם,
*aritsem;* it is yet certain that the meaning is the same. Some, at the
same time, apply this to the *Jews,* that God would remove them from
Babylon, purposing to give them rest, that is, by dwelling securely in
their own country; but as there is no mention made here of his people,
this view is forced and far-fetched. I omit other explanations, for the
meaning of the Prophet seems to me to be simply this, *When I shall make
an irruption,* or, after I shall have made them rest, *I will make them
to flee* He speaks, as I think, of the Chaldeans; and the particle <span
id="ii.iii.liv-p9.4"></span>כי, *ki,* is to be taken as an adverb of
time, *when,* or *after.* It is, indeed, often a causative, but it has
sometimes this meaning.

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p10"></span>Now, these two clauses may be thus
explained: *When I shall make an irruption,* or, when I shall have made
them rest; for <span id="ii.iii.liv-p10.1"></span>רגע, *rego,* means
both to break and to rest. It is here in the active or causative
conjugation, in *Hiphil.* If, then, we read, “After I shall have made
them to rest,” the sense will be that the: Babylonians had been long
tranquil, as there was no one who infested them or disturbed their
peace; and we know that men having long rested in their idleness and
sloth, become almost stupefied, so that they are touched with no fear.
God then shows that the Babylonians were greatly mistaken, if they
thought that the rest which they had previously enjoyed would be
perpetual; for he would make them to flee from the city, though they had
been long there in a tranquil state. The other sense is by no means
unsuitable, “When I shall break,” or make an irruption, then all will
flee away, that is, leave the city, which was before like a paradise.
There is still no doubt but that the Prophet here denounces on the
Babylonians a sudden overthrow, which would drive the people here and
there in all directions.  <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md)

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p12"></span>It now follows, *Who is the chosen* one
*whom I shall set over her?* God here in a manner deliberates as to the
person whom he should make the leader of the war against the Chaldeans;
and by these words he intimates that there would be ready for him the
best general, and one especially active and also excelling in the art of
war. And we know that even the unwilling are made to serve God, when he
employs the ungodly as his scourges. In short, God shows that though the
Babylonians might have brave leaders and most skillful in war, there yet
would be prepared leaders, to whom he would commit the office of taking
that city. And thus he teaches us at the same time that men are ruled by
his hand, so that he chooses them according to his will and directs them
to any work he pleases, *Who is the chosen* one, he says, *whom I shall
set over her?*

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p13"></span>And he adds, *and who is like me?* Here
the Prophet shows that the Babylonians in vain trusted in their own
defenses; for after having tried all things, they would find that
whatever was set up against God and his invincible power, would be mere
smoke. This sentence often occurs; and however common it may appear,
yet, if we examine ourselves, we shall find that the Holy Spirit does
not so often enforce it without reason; for after we have confessed that
none is equal to God or can add to his power, — as soon as any trial
assails us, this confession vanishes, and we tremble as though God was
nothing, and had no power to bring us help. Diffidence, then, which
often creeps in when we are in difficulties or dangers, sufficiently
shows that we do not attribute to God the praise due to his power. He
does not then exclaim here, as in other places, without reason, *Who is
like me?* as though he had said, that the Babylonians would foolishly
seek auxiliaries here and there; for when they had made the utmost
exertions, whatever they might think the most useful would all vanish
away, so that they would be destitute of all remedies.

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p14"></span>He adds, *And who will protest against
me?* Some give this frigid version, *Who will prescribe to* me the time?
but they wholly pervert the meaning of the Prophet; for God in this
place declares, that men would in vain contend or litigate with him. It
is the same as if he had said, “Though all men were to rise up against,
me, yet I will not allow them to litigate with me; and this they would
also do in vain.” In short, God intimates that men would in vain clamor
against his judgments, for he would nevertheless perform what he has
decreed. He does not yet claim for himself that absolute power about
which the sophists prattle, while they separate it from justice; but he
intimates that the causes are not always manifest to men when he
executes his judgments; for it is not without reason that the Scripture
testifies that God’s judgments are a deep abyss; but by such an
expression it is not meant that anything in God’s judgments is confused
or in disorder, what then? even that God works in an extraordinary
manner, and that hence his judgments are sometimes hidden from men.

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p15"></span>Then God briefly shows, that though the
Babylonians were to dispute, and start many objections, all this would
be useless, because he would execute what he had decreed, and that
without debating.

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p16"></span>Let us then learn from these words,
that when God’s works have the appearance of being unreasonable, we
ought humbly to admire them, and never to judge them according to our
computation; for God is not to be judged by us. Therefore, as I have
already said, we are then only wise, when we humbly adore him in all his
works, without disputing with him; for when we adduce all possible
things, he will close our mouth with one word, and check all our
presumption; nay, he will ever overcome us by being silent, for his
justice will always overthrow whatever may come to our minds. But we
must bear in mind what I have stated, that God never so acts by his
absolute power as to separate it from his justice; for this would be as
it were to wound himself; for these things are undivided, his power and
justice, though justice often does not appeal however this may be, his
sole and simple will is to us the rule of all justice.

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p17"></span>It follows, *And who is that shepherd
who will stand before me?* He alludes to the similitude he had used, for
he compared himself before to a lion. he says now, “Since I shall go
against Babylon like a lion, what shepherd will dare to oppose me?” We
see that there is to be understood a contrast, between a lion and a
shepherd; for God would be like a lion to destroy Babylon; hence, by
pastor, he denotes any adversary who might come forth to defend the
Chaldean flock. It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.lv"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.lv-p1"></span><span
id="ii.iii.lv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
50:45](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#045.md)<span id="ii.iii.lv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.lv-p2"></span>**45**. Therefore hear ye the counsel of
the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he
hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the
flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make *their* habitation
desolate with them.

<span id="ii.iii.lv-p3"></span>**45**. Propterea audite consilium
Jehovae quod consultavit contra Babylonem, et cogitationes quas
cogitavit contra terram Chaldaeorum; Si non traxerint eos parvuli
gregis; si non perdiderint super eos habitaculum.

<span id="ii.iii.lv-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.lv-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.lv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.lv-p6"></span>The Prophet confirms his previous
doctrine, and uses an oath, for he had already spoken sufficiently at
large of the destruction of Babylon, and his words might seem otherwise
superfluous, because the subject had been explained with abundant
clearness. But he introduces God here as making an oath, for the
particles, “if not,” <span id="ii.iii.lv-p6.1"></span>אם לא, *am la,*
show the sentence to be elliptical; and we know that this form of
swearing is common in Scripture. Then God swears, that the Babylonians
were already given up to destruction, so that even the *least of the
flock* would be superior to them.

<span id="ii.iii.lv-p7"></span>But it is not without reason that the
Prophet speaks here of the *counsel* of God and of his *thoughts;* for
we know that men through their own vanity are held suspended or in
doubt, so that they do not firmly acquiesce in God’s word, at least they
vacillate so as to have no stability of faith. As, then, men think in
themselves that possibly a thing may happen otherwise than according to
the words of the prophets, Jeremiah does here meet such thoughts, and
bids men to *hear* the *counsel* of God and his *thoughts.* It is,
indeed, a mode of speaking transferred from men, when he speaks of the
thoughts of God; for we know that God does not deliberate on what he is
about to do, as the case is with men. But this manner of speaking so
frequently occurs, that it ought to be familiar to us. However this may
be, he intimates that God did not in vain announce terror when speaking
of Babylon, but that the irrevocable decree was declared which God had
formed. Hence he says, that he had already taken counsel, so that men
need not deliberate any more, nor call into question his fixed decree,
nor dispute concerning his thoughts. There is, then, no reason for men
to revolve things in themselves, and to adopt different views; because
events must be, he says, as I have predicted; God then has commanded me
to announce this prophecy as brought forth from his counsel, which can
by no means be changed. This is the reason why he mentions God’s counsel
and thoughts.

<span id="ii.iii.lv-p8"></span>He adds, *If they shall not draw them
forth;* some read, “cast them out.” But <span
id="ii.iii.lv-p8.1"></span>סחב, *sacheb,* means to draw; and there is no
doubt but that the Prophet denotes by this verb contempt and reproach;
as carcasses are drawn through the mud, or a dead dog is drawn and cast
into a river; so now, he says, *Draw forth the Babylonians shall the
least of the flock* But how can these things agree together, that there
was to be the choicest leader, and that yet the least of the flock would
be the conquerors? God intimates, that though he would endow Cyrus with
warlike valor, yet if it pleased him, there would be means by which he
could destroy the Babylonians, were he to send sheep or lambs as their
enemies. He means, in a word, that the Babylonians would be unwarlike,
when God deprived them of their courage.

<span id="ii.iii.lv-p9"></span>*If they will not upset over them their
tabernacle* Some read as though the verb were <span
id="ii.iii.lv-p9.1"></span>שום, *shum,* “If they will not set,” etc.;
others derive the word from <span id="ii.iii.lv-p9.2"></span>ישם,
*ishem;* but it comes rather from <span id="ii.iii.lv-p9.3"></span>שמם,
*shemem; If,* then, *they will not upset over them their tabernacle,*
that is, when the Babylonians shall be laid prostrate, even their houses
shall fall and overwhelm them. In short, God sets forth here a final
ruin, from which the Babylonians could never be restored; for it is an
evidence of hopeless despair, when houses are upset, so that their
masters are buried in their ruins. It follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.lvi"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.lvi-p1"></span><span

<span id="ii.iii.lvi-p2"></span>**46**. At the noise of the taking of

<span id="ii.iii.lvi-p3"></span>**46**. A voce captae Babylonis

est.

<span id="ii.iii.lvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii.lvi-p5"></span><span id="ii.iii.lvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.lvi-p6"></span>This is to anticipate an objection; for
many might have said, “How can it be, that Babylon should thus fall, on
whose monarchy so many and so wide countries are dependent?” As, then,
such an event appearing so unreasonable, might occur to them, the
Prophet meets the objection, and answers by way of anticipation, that
though the earth shook, yet this would surely take place. He shows, at
the same time, how great the calamity would be, for it would, by its
noise, make the whole world to tremble: it would be thus better known
how grievous was to be God’s vengeance on the Babylonians; for it was
not to be without the shaking of the whole earth. Now follows, —

<span id="ii.iii.iii-p10"></span>The word for “images” means labor, and

id="ii.iii.ix-p3.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.ix-p4"></span> I render the verse thus, —

<span id="ii.iii.ix-p5"></span>**6.** Lost sheep have become my people;
Their shepherds have caused them to err, Having turned them here and
there on the mountains; From mountain to hill have they gone; They have
forgotten their resting-place.

<span id="ii.iii.ix-p6"></span>The meaning of <span
id="ii.iii.ix-p6.1"></span>שובבים is given by the *Sept.* and *Vulg.,*
“causing them to wander;” the verb <span id="ii.iii.ix-p6.2"></span>שב
is to turn; being here a *reduplicate,* it means to turn much, or again
and again, or here and there; and this is confirmed by what follows —
they went, through the teaching of their pastors, from “mountain to
hill,” that is, from one form of idolatry to another; and “forgotten
their resting-place,” which was God. — *Ed*

<span id="ii.iii.x-p16"></span> *Calvin,* in his exposition of <span
id="ii.iii.x-p16.1"></span>[Isa
37:26](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#026.md)<span

Sennacherib, as it is commonly done. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[54](cc21004.htm#fr_53.md) <span
id="ii.iii.x-p26.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.x-p27"></span> The most approved exposition is the
first, which makes the latter words to be in apposition with Jehovah, as
given in the Versions, though the last clause seems to be a separate
sentence, —

<span id="ii.iii.x-p28"></span>Because they have sinned against Jehovah,
The habitation of righteousness; And the hope of their fathers *was*
Jehovah.

<span id="ii.iii.x-p29"></span>By calling God the habitation of
righteousness, what is implied is, as *Lowth* suggests, that they would
not have been banished, had they not justly deserved to be so treated,
God being the seat or dwelling-place of justice or righteousness. And in
addition to this, he had been the hope of their fathers. See <span
id="ii.iii.x-p29.1"></span>[Jer
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer040.htm#003.md)<span id="ii.iii.x-p29.1"></span>,

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p11"></span> Their arrows, like those of a skilful

<span id="ii.iii.xii-p11.2"></span>[Isa

the *Targ.* — *Ed.*

47:3](../../../bib/kjv/jer047.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xiv-p10.2"></span>) used the word for steeds or horses, we
may conclude that he means the same here. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_57"></span>[58](cc21004.htm#fr_57.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xiv-p12"></span> The connection of these two verses
will be more evident, if we render <span id="ii.iii.xiv-p12.1"></span>כי
*when,* as proposed by *Gataker,* and not *surely,* as by *Calvin,* nor
*because,* as in our version, —

<span id="ii.iii.xiv-p13"></span>**11.** When ye shall rejoice, when ye
shall exult, Ye plunderers of mine heritage, When ye shall skip as a fed
heifer, And neigh like steeds,

<span id="ii.iii.xiv-p14"></span>**12.** Ashamed greatly *shall be* your
mother, Confounded *shall* she be who bare you; Behold, the last of the
nations *shall she be,* A desert, a dry land, and a wilderness.

<span id="ii.iii.xiv-p15"></span>The reference seems to be to the
rejoicings of Babylon, when it was taken. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_58"></span>[59](cc21004.htm#fr_58.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xviii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xviii-p8"></span> Or literally, “Because against
Jehovah has she sinned.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[60](cc21004.htm#fr_59.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xix-p9"></span> Rather “battlements” or ramparts, as
given by the *Sept.;* for it is not proper to say that “*foundations*”
have fallen. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[61](cc21004.htm#fr_60.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xxi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxi-p9"></span> Literally, “and boned him;” which is to
be taken in a privative sense, “and unboned him.” There are similar
words in Hebrew: to neck is to break the neck. (<span
id="ii.iii.xxi-p9.1"></span>[Ex
13:13](../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#013.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxi-p9.1"></span>.) To tail is to cut off the tail. (<span
id="ii.iii.xxi-p9.2"></span>[Jos
10:19](../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#019.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxi-p9.2"></span>.) To root is to root up. (<span
id="ii.iii.xxi-p9.3"></span>[Ps
52:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa052.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxi-p9.3"></span>.) The *Vulg.* here is <span
id="ii.iii.xxi-p9.4"></span>*exossavit* — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_61"></span>[62](cc21004.htm#fr_61.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xxiv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxiv-p8"></span> The idea of this verse is rightly
given in these words: the punishment for iniquity and sins would not be
exacted, because God would pardon the remnant; hence they appeared not.
The removal of punishment, the restoration from exile, would shew that
iniquity and sins no longer existed, God having fully pardoned them, and
thus obliterated them.

<span id="ii.iii.xxiv-p9"></span>The iniquity of Israel was false
worship, the worship of the calves, and the sins of Judah were
especially idolatry and the rejection of God’s messages by his prophets.
For these evils more particularly they were banished, and their exile
proved a remedy for them, as they never afterwards fell into these sins.
— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[63](cc21004.htm#fr_62.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xxvii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p8"></span> Merathaim and Pekod are appellatives,
and not proper names, in the early versions, and the first is so in the
*Targ*. and rendered “rebellious;” but by the *Sept*. “bitterly;” by the
*Vulg.* “rulers;” and by the *Syr.* “exasperating.” The most probable
derivation of the word is from <span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p8.1"></span>מרה,
to rebel, with a dual termination, doubly rebellious, *i.e.,* very
rebellious. As to “Pekod,” the versions give it the idea of visiting by
way of punishment: “Avenge thou with the sword,” is the *Sept.;* “Visit
her inhabitants,” the *Vulg.;* “Assail ye her and her inhabitants,” the
*Syr.;* the *Targ.* has “the inhabitants of Pekod.” It is better to take
both words as appellatives: —

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p9"></span>**21.** Against the land of the most
rebellious, against her ascend, And to the inhabitants of visitation;
Slay and utterly destroy their posterity, saith Jehovah, And do
according to all that I have commanded thee.

<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p10"></span>As to Babylon being “rebellious,” see
<span id="ii.iii.xxvii-p10.1"></span>[Jer.
50:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#024.md),
[33](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#033.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxvii-p10.1"></span>. “Inhabitants of visitation” were such
as were to be visited, *i.e.,* with judgment; see <span
id="ii.iii.xxvii-p10.2"></span>[Jer
50:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#031.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxvii-p10.2"></span>. The repetition, “against her,” is
emphatical. “posterity,” *i.e.,* children, or young men, as in <span
id="ii.iii.xxvii-p10.3"></span>[Jer
50:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#030.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxvii-p10.3"></span>. See <span
id="ii.iii.xxvii-p10.4"></span>[1Ki
16:3](../../../bib/kjv/kg1016.htm#003.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxvii-p10.4"></span>. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_63"></span>[64](cc21004.htm#fr_63.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xxix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p10"></span> The first verb, <span
id="ii.iii.xxix-p10.1"></span>גדע, means to cast off as well as to cut
off; the breaking is expressed by the following verb. According to order
often found in the Prophets, the final act, casting off, is first
mentioned, and then the previous act, the breaking of it, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p11"></span>**23.** How has the hammer of all the
earth Been cast off and broken! How has Babylon become a wonder among
nations!

<span id="ii.iii.xxix-p12"></span>“A wonder” or astonishment, for so the
word is evidently to be taken here, according to the *Syr.,* though
rendered “extinction” by the *Sept.,* and “desert” by the *Vulg.* and
*Targ. Blayney* and *Henderson* render it “astonishment.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_64"></span>[65](cc21004.htm#fr_64.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xxx-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxx-p9"></span> “Treasury” here means an armory or
arsenal, as rendered by *Blayney:* and then “instruments” signify
weapons, drawn from the armory. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_65"></span>[66](cc21004.htm#fr_65.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xxx-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxx-p10"></span> Literally it is, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxx-p11"></span>For a work — this the Lord Jehovah of
hosts has In the land of the Chaldeans.

<span id="ii.iii.xxx-p12"></span> — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_66"></span>[67](cc21004.htm#fr_66.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p8"></span> It is added, “from the extremity,”
*i.e.,* of heaven, according to a parallel passage in <span
id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p8.1"></span>[Isa
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#005.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p8.1"></span>. They were to come from the farthest
parts of the earth then known. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_67"></span>[68](cc21004.htm#fr_67.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p9.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p10"></span> The most approved rendering is,
“Cast (or throw) her up as heaps,” *i.e.,* of rubbish, according to
<span id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p10.1"></span>[Jer
51:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#037.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxiii-p10.1"></span>. It is said that the verb here never
means to tread under foot, “Make her, of a goodly, stately city, nothing
but heaps of earth, stones, and rubbish.” *Gataker.* — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_68"></span>[69](cc21004.htm#fr_68.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p8"></span> The *Sept.* and *Syr.* take <span
id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p8.1"></span>פרי here as signifying fruit, *i.e.,* of
the womb — children, offspring; and what is said in <span
id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p8.2"></span>[Isa
13:16-18](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#016.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p8.2"></span>, favours this meaning, as well as what is
said in <span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p8.3"></span>[Jer
50:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer050.htm#021.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p8.3"></span>, if we render <span
id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p8.4"></span>אחריהם, “their posterity.” The *Vulg.* and
the *Targ.* render the word here “valiants,” expressing the meaning of
“bullocks.” The first version is the most suitable, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p9"></span>Slay ye all her fruit (or
offspring;)  
Let them descend to the slaughter.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p10"></span>It is descending to the slaughter
that led critics to render <span id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p10.1"></span>פרי
bullocks, but we find this expression unconnected with bullocks in <span
id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p10.2"></span>[Jer
48:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#015.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xxxiv-p10.2"></span>; where “chosen young men” are said to
“descend to the slaughter.” To descend denotes degradation, and to
ascend dignity. The *Targ.* has, “Let them be delivered to the
slaughter.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_69"></span>[70](cc21004.htm#fr_69.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p7.6"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p8"></span> The early versions and the *Targ.*
render <span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p8.1"></span>רבים, “*many*;” and the
rendering of the *Sept.* and *Vulg.* is to this effect, —

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p9"></span>Proclaim ye to the many at Babylon, To
all who bend the bow, — “Encompass her around, Let there be no escape,”
etc.

<span id="ii.iii.xxxvi-p10"></span>The first part is a charge like what
we find in the second verse; and the second states what they were to do.
“Proclaim ye to,” is literally, “‘Make ye to hear,” — “Make ye the many
at Babylon to hear,” etc. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_70"></span>[71](cc21004.htm#fr_70.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xl-p12.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p13"></span> The versions, except the *Syr.* and the
*Targ.,* give a similar meaning to this verb: but there is no instance
of the verb in Hiphil having this meaning, though it would be the most
suitable to this place. At the same time we may consider the land of
Chaldea to be meant, if we regard the stillness or quietness as
referring to the check produced by God’s restraining power, —

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p14"></span>So as to render the land still,  
And to terrify the inhabitants of Babylon.

<span id="ii.iii.xl-p15"></span>The promise is to make the land quiet so
as not to oppose the return of the Jews, and for the same purpose, to
terrify Babylon. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_71"></span>[72](cc21004.htm#fr_71.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xliv-p6.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xliv-p7"></span> The word is rendered “diviners” by the
*Vulg.,* the *Syr.,* and the *Targ.;* it is left out by the *Sept.* Some
derive it from <span id="ii.iii.xliv-p7.1"></span>בדא, to feign, to
devise, to invent, the <span id="ii.iii.xliv-p7.2"></span>א being left
out in <span id="ii.iii.xliv-p7.3"></span>בדים, others say that it comes
from <span id="ii.iii.xliv-p7.4"></span>בד, alone, solitary, separate,
so that <span id="ii.iii.xliv-p7.5"></span>בדים were the recluse,
retirement or seclusion being often the habit of impostors. It is
connected, in <span id="ii.iii.xliv-p7.6"></span>[Isa
44:25](../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#025.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xliv-p7.6"></span>, with <span
id="ii.iii.xliv-p7.7"></span>קסמים, diviners, prognosticators. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_72"></span>[73](cc21004.htm#fr_72.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xliv-p8.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xliv-p9"></span> Events would prove, that they were
foolish and ignorant, being not able to foretell the ruin of their own
nation, notwithstanding their boast in the knowledge of futurity. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_73"></span>[74](cc21004.htm#fr_73.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xlvi-p6.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p7"></span> It is so rendered by the *Vulg*. and
the *Targ.,* omitted by the *Sept.,* and rendered “sword” by the *Syr.,*
and also by *Blayney* and *Henderson.* The same incongruity exists as to
the treasures; but the sword here, means those who wielded it, the
soldiers of Cyrus: they spoiled the treasures, they turned the streams
of the rivers. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_74"></span>[75](cc21004.htm#fr_74.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xlvi-p9.3"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlvi-p10"></span> That the Babylonians had large idols
or images, which were of terrific size, is evident from <span
id="ii.iii.xlvi-p10.1"></span>[Da
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#001.md)<span
id="ii.iii.xlvi-p10.1"></span> — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_75"></span>[76](cc21004.htm#fr_75.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xlvii-p6.5"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p7"></span> As to the two first words, the
versions and the *Targ.* widely differ. According to *Bochart,* the
first word, <span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p7.1"></span>ציים, means “wild cats,”
and the second, <span id="ii.iii.xlvii-p7.2"></span>איים, jackals. The
*Vulg.,* the *Syr*., and the *Targ.* render the other word, <span
id="ii.iii.xlvii-p7.3"></span>יענה, the same, “the ostrich;” and this is
the general opinion. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_76"></span>[77](cc21004.htm#fr_76.md) <span
id="ii.iii.xlviii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.xlviii-p10"></span> Rather “*sojourn,*” according to
the *Sept.* — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_77"></span>[78](cc21004.htm#fr_77.md) <span
id="ii.iii.l-p6.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.l-p7"></span> Rather “spear” or lance; so the *Sept.*
and *Syr*., though the *Vulg.* and *Targ.* have “shield.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_78"></span>[79](cc21004.htm#fr_78.md) <span
id="ii.iii.liv-p10.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iii.liv-p11"></span> See note on <span
