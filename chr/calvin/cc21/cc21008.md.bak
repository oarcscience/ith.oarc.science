<span id="iii.i-p1"></span>PRELECTIONS OF JOHN CALVIN

<span id="iii.i-p2"></span>ON

<span id="iii.i-p3"></span>THE LAMENTATIONS OF JEREMIAH

<span id="iii.i-p4"></span>PREFACE

<span id="iii.i-p5"></span>I undertake now to explain The Lamentations
of Jeremiah. We must inquire when the Book was composed by the Prophet,
and also what was the object of the author. Grossly mistaken was
*Jerome*, who thought that it is the Elegy which Jeremiah composed on
the death of Josiah; for we see nothing here that is suitable to that
event. There is indeed mention made in one place of a king, but what is
said there cannot be applied to Josiah; for he was never driven into
exile, but was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers. From the whole
contents of the Book we may justly conclude, that it was written after
the city was destroyed, and the people led into exile.

<span id="iii.i-p6"></span>Some think that Jeremiah, before this
calamity happened, historically described it, and that he thus
prophesied of what was future and yet unknown. But this is by no means
probable; for Jeremiah here sets before the eyes of all, those things
which they knew as facts; and we shall easily discover that his manner
of stating things is wholly different from that used in prophetic
writings. There is, then, no doubt but that Jeremiah, after the city was
destroyed and the Temple burnt, bewailed the miserable state of his own
nation, not after the manner of heathens, but that he might shew that
even in so disastrous a state of things some benefit might be derived
from what he says. And this is what ought to be especially noticed; for
except we bear this in mind, the Book will lose its peculiar interest,
but if we direct our minds to that desolation, which wholly dejected not
only the people in general, but also the Prophet himself, so that he
lost all hope, we may surely hence derive no small benefit. It is an
easy thing to extol in high terms the favor of God in prosperity, and
also to exhort those who have reasons to hope well to entertain
confidence, and to bring forward God’s promises, that the minds of the
godly may recumb on them; but when things are in a state of despair, and
God seems to have forsaken his Church, since prophecy still remains in
its force, and God appears as stretching forth his hand to the
miserable, and to such as are almost in a hopeless state, we hence
derive much benefit, and this is the chief use of what is taught here.
But. we see that Jeremiah, when the kingdom had fallen, when the king
with all his children was exposed to extreme disgrace, when in short the
covenant of God seemed wholly abolished, still continued to discharge
his office, which he certainly did not do in vain.

<span id="iii.i-p7"></span>When, therefore, he understood that his
teaching would not be without fruit, he was thus induced to speak first
of God’s judgments; secondly, to exhort the people to repentance;
thirdly, to encourage them to hope; and lastly, to open the door for
prayer to God, so that the people in their extremities might venture to
flee to God’s mercy; which could not have been done without faith.

<span id="iii.i-p8"></span>We now in a measure understand for what
purpose this Book was written by Jeremiah: his object was to shew that
though nothing in the land appeared but desolation, and the Temple being
destroyed, the Covenant of God appeared as made void, and thus all hope
of salvation had been cut off, yet hope still remained, provided the
people sought God in true repentance and faith; and he thus proceeded in
the course of his calling, and made it evident that his doctrine would
not be without benefit.

<span id="iii.i-p9"></span>He indeed bewails, as I have said, the
extreme calamity of his people; but he mingles with his lamentations the
doctrine of repentance and faith’ For, on the one hand, he shews that
the people suffered a just punishment for the many iniquities, of which
they could not have been healed; and then, on the other hand, he gives
them some intimations of God’s mercy, that in death itself the Jews
might seek life, nay, that in the lowest depths they might know that God
would be propitious to them. He at length by his own example stimulates
them to pray; but prayer is founded on faith. It then follows, that
Jeremiah, when the people had become wholly alienated from the worship
of God, yet spent his labor in collecting together the remnant. Though,
then, the whole Church was not only in the greatest disorder, but also
reduced as it were almost to nothing, yet Jeremiah constructed some sort
of building out of the ruins. This is the substance of this Book.

<span id="iii.i-p10"></span>The Greek Translators call this Book <span
id="iii.i-p10.1"></span>Θρήνους, Lamentations, and very properly, as
also the Hebrews call it <span id="iii.i-p10.2"></span>קינוה, *kinut*;
though the common name or title is <span id="iii.i-p10.3"></span>אכה,
*aike*, from the first word in it. But when they wish to express what
the Book contains, they call it <span id="iii.i-p10.4"></span>קינות,
*kinut*, Lamentations.

<span id="iii.i-p11"></span>Let us now proceed to the words; for what I
have now briefly touched upon, can be more fully explained as we go on.
