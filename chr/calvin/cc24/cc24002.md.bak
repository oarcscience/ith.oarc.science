<span id="iii-p1"></span>THE PRINTER WISHES HEALTH FROM THE LORD

<span id="iii-p2"></span>TO THE PIOUS READER.

<span id="iii-p3"></span>Hail to thee, Christian Reader! — I present to
thee the Lectures of the most illustrious John Calvin, in which he has
interpreted The Prophecies Of Daniel, with his usual diligence and
clearness, and with that singular fidelity which shines throughout all
his Expositions of Sacred Scripture. The manner in which they have been
edited by those two brethren, John Budaeus and Charles Joinville, it
would be superfluous to dwell upon, since that has been clearly made
manifest in the way in which the Twelve Minor Prophets were brought out
two years ago by John Crispin. For, in treating these Lectures, they
have followed entirely the same course as they did in the former ones.
Lest, perhaps, you should be surprised at the addition of the Hebrew
context to the Latin version, I will explain the matter in a few words.
Some studious and learned men very much wished to have the Hebrew text
in the former Lectures which I mentioned, for the following reason
chiefly, among others. It is exceedingly agreeable to Hebrew scholars to
have that very fountain placed before their eyes from which this most
faithful Interpreter drew the genuine sense of the Prophet. It is by no
means unpleasing to those less skilled in the language, to see Daniel
speaking not only in a foreign, but in his native tongue, and to
understand how anything is originally expressed. Hence we have thought
it right not to pass over the original words of the holy man. In
addition to this, the same learned Interpreter, Calvin, is accustomed
first to read each verse in Hebrew, and then to turn it into Latin. It
was desirable to introduce this short preface, that you may understand
his whole method of teaching. Besides, every one will judge better by
his own perusal, what copious and abundant fruit all may derive from
these Lectures. Farewell, and if you profit at all, ascribe the praise
to God alone, who deserves it, and always pray much for Calvin, his most
faithful servant.  <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_59"></span>[60](cc24002.htm#fr_59.md) <span
id="iii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="iii-p4"></span> This is the address of Bartholomew Vincent in
his edition, A.D. *1571,* which has the Hebrew and Latin text printed
together. It has been repeated in the edition at Geneva, 1591, with the
omission of the clause “<span id="iii-p4.1"></span>*ante biennium Joanne
Crispino;*” since, like the former, it contains the Hebrew and Chaldee
text opposite the Latin, with a running Hebrew title.

<span id="iii-p5"></span>In the collected edition of Calvin’s works,
Amsterdam, volume v., a Dedication to that Volume occurs, dated 10mo
Cal. Aug. 1568, which, although preceding Daniel, has no reference to
his Prophecies, and is consequently omitted in this our work. It
concerns the disputes of that period respecting the Lord’s Supper, and
certain heretical perversions of the truth then current.

<span id="iii-p6"></span>The Address of the Printer to the Reader
prefixed to the same volume, refers to Jeremiah, Laminations, Twelve
Miner Prophets, and Daniel generally; but; as it contains nothing
suitable to our purpose, it is of course omitted.
