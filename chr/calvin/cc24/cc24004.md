<span id="v-p1"></span>THE PRAYER

<span id="v-p2"></span>WHICH JOHN CALVIN WAS ACCUSTOMED TO USE AT THE
C0MMENCEMENT OF HIS LECTURES.

<span id="v-p3"></span>Grant unto us, O Lord, to be occupied in the
mysteries of thy Heavenly wisdom, with true progress in piety, to thy
glory and our own edification. — Amen.

<span id="v-p4"></span>This prayer is not inserted in the Geneva edition
of 1617, but is found in that of 1571. The French Translation renders it
as follows — “May the Lord grant us grace so to treat the secrets of His
celestial wisdom, that we may truly profit in the fear of his holy name,
to His glory and to our edification. Amen”
