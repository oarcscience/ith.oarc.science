<span id="ii-p1"></span>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE

<span id="ii-p2"></span>The Prophecies Of Daniel are among the most
remarkable Predictions of The Elder Covenant. They are not confined
within either a limited time or a contracted space. They relate to the
destinies of mighty Empires, and stretch forward into eras still hidden
in the bosom of the future. The period of their delivery was a
remarkable one in the history of out race. The Assyrian hero had long
ago swept away the Ten Tribes from the, land of their fathers, and he in
his turn had bowed his head in death, leaving magnificent memorials of
his greatness in colossal palaces and gigantic sculptures. The Son of
the renowned Sardanapalus, the worshipper of Assarac and Beltis, had
already inscribed his name and exploits on those swarthy obelisks and
enormous bulls which have lately risen from the grave of centuries. The
glory of Nineveah, passed away, to be restored again in these our days
by the marvelous excavations at Koyunjik, Khorabad, and Nimroud. Another
capital had arisen on the banks of the Euphrates, destined to surpass
the ancient splendor of its ruined predecessor on the banks of the
Tigris. The worshipper of the eagle-headed Nisroch — a mighty leader of
the Chaldean hordes — had arisen, and gathering his armies from their
mountain homes, had made the palaces and halls of Nineve a desert, had
marched southwards against the reigning Pharaoh of Egypt — had
encountered him at Carchemish — hurried on to The Holy City, and carried
away with him to his favorite capital the rebellious people of the Lord.
Among them was a captive of no ordinary note. He was at that time a
child, yet he lived to see this descendant of the hardy Chasdim grow
great in power and fame — to hear the tale of the fall of Tyre, and “the
daughter of the Zidonians,” and of the triumph over Pharaoh Hophra, whom
modern researches have discovered in the twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt’s
kings. At length the haughty conqueror returns, and dreams mysteriously.
This forgotten prisoner becomes the only interpreter of wondrous visions
of Empires about to arise and spread over distant centuries. The dreamer
is at length gathered to his fathers, yet the interpreter lives on
through the reign of the grandson, and explains a mysterious writing on
the palace wall, amidst revelry which ends in the city’s overthrow.
Cryus and his Persians, Darius and his Medes rise rapidly to power, and
the Prophet rises with them — till envy throws the aged Seer into a
lion’s den. But he perishes not till he has seen visions of the future
history of mankind. The triumphs of Pitasia and Macedon are revealed —
the division of Alexander’s Empire — the wars of his successors — the
wide-spread dominion of Rome — the overthrow of the Sacred Sanctuary by
Titus — and The Coming Of Messiah to regenerate and to rule the world
when the seventy weeks were accomplished.

<span id="ii-p3"></span>The Roll of the Book, containing all these
surprising announcements, has naturally excited the attention of the
Scholars and Divines of all ages. Among the voluminous Comments of the
laborious Calvin, none will be received by the British public with more
heartfelt interest than his Lectures upon Daniel. The various
illustrations of Daniel and the Apocalypse with which the press has
always teemed, display the hold which these Divine Oracles have taken of
the public mind. Various theories of interpretation have been warmly and
even bitterly discussed. The Praeterist, and the Futurist, the German
Neologian, and the American Divine, have each written boldly and
copiously; and the public of Christendom have read with avidity, because
they have been taught that these predictions come home to our own times,
and to our modern controversies. Abstruse arguments and historical
discussions have been rendered popular, through the expectation of
seeing either Pope or Turk, or, perhaps, the Saracen in The Willful
King, and The Little Horn. If Napoleon the First, or Napoleon the
Second, if an Emperor of Russia, or a Pharaoh of Egypt, can be
discovered in the King of the South, pushing at the King of the North —
then the deep significance of the Prophecy *to us* is at once
acknowledged, and the intensity of its brightness descends directly upon
*our own* generation. If the “twelve hundred and ninety Days” of the
twelfth Chapter be really years, then the blessing of waiting till “The
Time of The End” seems to be upon us, since The French Revolution, and
the waning of the Turkish sway, and the Conquests of Britain in the
East, are then foretold in these “words” which have hitherto been
“closed up and sealed.”

<span id="ii-p4"></span>Whether any of these theories be true or false,
they have exercised a mighty power over the imaginations of modern
Writers on Prophecy, and have so attracted the minds of Theologians to
the subject, as to give force to the inquiry, What was Calvin’s view of
these stirring scenes? Without anticipating his Comments, it may be
replied, that he disposes of the important question in a few lines. “*In
numeris non sum Pythagoricus,*” is the expression of both his wisdom and
his modesty. In attempting, however, a solution of these great problems
in Prophecy, the opinions of The Reformers are most important, and among
them all none stands higher as a deep and original thinker than the
Author of these Explanatory Lectures. It is enough for this our Preface
to remark, that the bare possibility of the contents of this Book
corning home to the daily politics of Europe and the East, adds a charm
and a zest to the following pages, which no infirmity in the Commentator
can destroy.

<span id="ii-p5"></span>In these Introductory Remarks, we shall allude
to the present state of opinion respecting the Genuineness and
Authenticity of the Book itself, touching upon some of the conjectures
advanced since Calvin’s time to the present, and adverting to the
skepticism of German Neology and the bold speculations of the amiable
Arnold. In confutation of all Infidel Objections, we shall next give a
general sketch of the History of Assyria and Babylon, as it has been
lately disentombed by the labors of Mm. Botta and Layard, and rescued
from the intricacies of the Cuneiform Inscriptions by Hincks and
Rawlinson. By these means, the Nimrod Obelisk in the British Museum —
the palatial chambers of Khorsabad and Koyunjik — the Winged Bull of
Persepolis — the statue of Cyrus, Moorghab — and the magnificent
sculpture of Darius at Behistun — all become vocal proofs of the
truthfulness of Daniel’s predictions. A visit to the East India House in
London will make us acquainted with the Standard Inscription of
Nebuchadnezzar, containing a list of “all tire temples build by the king
in the different towns and cities of Babylonia, naming the particular
gods and goddesses to whom the shrines were dedicated:  <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) a journey from Baghdad to the Bier’s Nimrod,
would shew us *every* ruin to be of the age of Nebuchadnezzar:” the
testimony of experience is here decisive. “I have examined the bricks
*in situ,*” says Major Rawlinson, “*belonging,* perhaps, to an hundreds
of towns and cities within this area of about 100 miles in length, and
thirty or forty in breadth, and I never found any other legend than that
of Nebuchadnezzar, the son of Nabopalassar, king of Babylon.”  <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) These interesting researches into The Times
Of Daniel will be followed by some criticism or The Book Of Daniel Here
we might enlarge to an overwhelming extent, but we are necessarily
compelled to confine our remarks to Calvin’s method of interpreting
these marvelous Prophecies. It will next be desirable to point out how
succeeding Commentators have differed from our Reformer, while we must
leave the reader to form his own opinion of his merits when he has
compared his views with those of his successors. We shall present him,
however, with sufficient *data* for making this comparison, and by
references to some modern Writers of eminence; and by short epitomes of
their leading arguments, we hope to render this edition of these
celebrated Lectures as instructive and as interesting as the limit of
our space will allow.

<span id="ii-p8"></span>AUTHENTICITY OF THE BOOK OF DANIEL

<span id="ii-p9"></span>The Third Century Of Christianity had scarcely
commenced, when the Authenticity of this Book was fiercely assailed by
the vigorous skepticism of Porphyry; and it would be totally unnecessary
to allude to so distant an opponent, had not his arguments been
reproduced by the later scholars of Germany, and adopted by one of our
noble spirits, whom in many things we delight to honor. Although the
Jews admitted this Book into their *Haiographa,* and our Lord referred
to its contents when predicting Jerusalem’s overthrow, yet these
self-sufficient critics of our day have repeated the heathen objection
which Jerome so elaborately refuted. If we inquire into the reason for
the revival of such obsolete skepticism, we shall find it in the pride
of that carnal mind which will not bow down submissively to the
miraculous dealings of the Almighty. The Prophecies concerning the times
of the Seleucidae and the Lagidae are found to be exceedingly precise
and minute hence it is argued, “they are no prophecies at all — they are
History dressed in the garb of Prophecy, written by some pseudo-Daniel
living during their supposed fulfillment.” The Sacred words of Holy Writ
become thus branded with imposture the testimony of the Jews and of our
Lord to the integrity of the Sacred Canon is set aside, and the simple
trust of the Christian Church both before and since the Reformation is
asserted to be a baseless delusion. The judgment and labors of Sir Isaac
Newton, the chronological acumen of Faber and Hales, are nothing but
“the foolishness of the wise,” because Bertholdt and Bleek, De Wett, and
Kirmis, have repeated the cry “*vaticinia post eventurn!*” And why this
eagerness to degrade this Book to a fabulous compilation of the Macabian
times? Simply because its reception as the Word of God would overthrow
the favorite theories of the Rationalists respecting The Old Testament.
We cannot undertake to reply to such objections in detail; we can only
furnish the reader with a few references to those Writers by whom they
have been both propagated and refuted. We shall first indicate and label
the poison. The proscenium of Rosemuller a furnishes us with a succinct
abstract of the assertions of Eichhornas in his *Einleit. in das A. T.,*
 <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) of Bertholt in his *Histor. krit.
Einleit,*  <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) of Bleek in his *Theolog
Zeitschr.,*  <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) *and* of Grissinger in
his *Neue, ansicht der auffatze im Buche Daniel.*  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) The antidote to these conjectures is
contained in Havernick’s article on Daniel, in Kitto’s Cyclopmdia of
Biblical Literature, and also in his valuable “New Critical Commentary
on the Book of Daniel.”  <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md)

<span id="ii-p15"></span>Professor Hengstenberg  <span
id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md) of Berlin has ably refilled the Neologian
objections of his predecessors the American reader will find the subject
ably treated in the Biblical Repertory of Philadelphia;  <span
id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) and the English student may obtain an
abstract of the points in dispute from the elaborate “Introduction” of
Hartwell Horne.  <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) The various theories
of these Neologists imply that the Book was written during the Machabean
period, by one or more authors who invented the earlier portions by
mingling fable with history in inextricable confusion, and by throwing
around the history of their own age the garb of prophetic romance! The
reception of any such hypothesis would so completely nullify the whole
of Calvin’s Exposition, that we feel absolved from the necessity of
entering into details. No disciple of this school will even condescend
to peruse these Lectures. It is enough for us to know, that these
unworthy successors of the early German Reformers have been met with
ability and research by Luderwalk, Staudlin, Jahn, Lack, and Steudel.
The unbelief of a Semler, and Michaelis, and a Corrodi, will seem to the
follower of Calvin the offspring of an unsanctified reason which has
never been trained in reverential homage to the inspired. Word. The
keenness of this perverse criticism has attempted to explain away two
important facts; first, that Ezekiel mentions Daniel as alive in his
day, and as a model of piety and wisdom, (<span
id="ii-p18.1"></span>[Eze 14:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii-p18.1"></span>, and <span id="ii-p18.2"></span>[Eze
28:3](../../../bib/kjv/eze028.htm#003.md)<span id="ii-p18.2"></span>,
 <span id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10) .md) and secondly, that the Canon of
the Hebrew Scriptures was finally closed before the times of the
Maccabean warriors. Havernick also treats with the greatest erudition
the linguistic character of the Book as a decisive proof of its
authenticity. He reminds us that the Hebrew language had ceased to be
spoken by the Jews long before the reigns of the Seleucid, that the
Aramaean was then the vernacular tongue, and yet still there is a
difference between the Aramaean of Daniel and the late Chaldee
Paraphrases of the Old Testament. Oriental scholars have pronounced this
testimony to be decisive. Interesting as his illustrations are, the
numerous subjects which demand our immediate notice will only admit of
our referring the reader to the Professor’s “New Critical Commentary on
the Book of Daniel.”  <span id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md)

<span id="ii-p21"></span>Happily there exists a strong conservative
protection against the injury arising from such speculations. They are
perfectly harmless to us when locked up in the obscurity of a foreign
language and of a forbidding theology. But it grieves the Christian mind
to find a writer worthy of being classed among the boldest of Reformers
giving the sanction of his authority to such baseless extravagances.
There are many points of similarity between the characters of Arnold and
Calvin. Both were remarkable for an unswerving constancy in upholding
all they felt to be right, and in resisting all they knew to be wrong.
Both were untiring in their industry, and marvelously successful in
impressing the young with the stamp of their own mental rigor. Agreeing
in their manful protest against the impostures of priestcraft, they
differed widely respecting the Book of Daniel. Our modern interpreter,
in a letter to a friend,  <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12.md) writes as
follows concerning “*the* latter chapters of Daniel, which, if genuine,
would be a clear exception to my canon of interpretation, as there can
be no reasonable spiritual meaning made out of The Kings of the North
and South. But I have long thought that the greater part of the Book of
Daniel is most certainly very late work, of the time of the Maccabees;
and the pretended Prophecy about the Kings of Grecia and Persia, and of
the North and South, is mere history, like the poetical prophecies in
Vigil and elsewhere. In fact, you can trace distinctly the date when it
was written, because the events up to the date are given with historical
minuteness, totally unlike the character of real prophecy, and beyond
that date all is imaginary.” It is not difficult to detect the leading
fallacy of this passage in the phrase “my canon of interpretation.” This
original thinker, with a pertinacity equal to that of Calvin, had
adopted his own method of explaining Prophecy, and determined at all
hazards to uphold it. As the writings of this accomplished scholar have
been very widely diffused, it will be useful to notice the arguments
which he has employed. His “Sermons on Prophecy” contain the dangerous
theory, which has been fully and satisfactorily answered by Blake in his
chapter on “The Historical Reality of Prophecy.”  <span
id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md)

<span id="ii-p24"></span>Dr. Arnold’s statements are as follow Sacred
Prophecy is not an anticipation of History. For History deals with
particular nation, times, places, and persons. But Prophecy cannot do
thief, or it would alter the very conditions of humanity. It deals only
with general principles, good and evil, truth and falsehood, God and his
enemy. It is the voice of God announcing the issue of the great struggle
between good and evil. Prophecy then, on this view, cannot be fulfilled
literally in the persons and nations mentioned in its language, it can
only be, fulfilled in the person of Christ. Thus, every part is said to
have a double sense, “one Historical, comprehended by the Prophet and
his own generation, in all its poetic features, but never fulfilled
answerably to the magnificence of is language, because that was inspired
by a higher object the other Spiritual, the proper form of which neither
the Prophet nor his contemporaries knew, but fill-filled adequately in
Christ, and his promises to his people as judgment on his enemies.” “It
is History which deals with the Twelve Tribes of Israel; but the Israel
of Prophecy are God’s Israel really and truly, who walk with him
faithfully, and abide with him to the end.” Twice the Prophecies have
failed of their fulfillment, first in the circumcised and then in the
baptized Church. “The Christian Israel does not answer more worthily to
the expectations of Prophecy than Israel after the flesh. Again have the
people whom he brought out of Egypt corrupted themselves” and hence
Predictions relating to the happiness of the Church, both before and
since the times of the Messiah, have signally and necessarily failed. We
cannot undertake the refutation of this general theory, we must refer
the reader to the satisfactory arguments of Birks. We can only quote his
clear exposition of the manner in which the Visions of Daniel confute
these crude speculations — “Instead of a mere glimpse of the sure
triumph of goodness at the last, we have most numerous details of the
steps of Providence which lead to that blessed consummation. The seven
years madness of Nebuchadnezzar, and his restoration to the throne; the
fate of Belshazzar, and the conquests of the Medes and Persians; the
rise of the Second Empire, the earlier dignity of the Medes, and the
later pre-eminence of the Persians over them; the victories of Cyrus
westsyard in Lydia, northward in Armenia, and southward in Babylon; the
unrivaled greatness of his Empire, and the exactions on the subject
provinces; the three successors of Cyrus, Cambyses, Smerdis, and Darius;
the accession of Xerxes, and the vast armament he led against Greece,
are all predicted within the time of the two earlier Empires. In the
time of the Third Kingdom a fuller variety of details is given. The
mighty exploits of Alexander, his total conquest of Persia, the rapidity
of his course, his uncontrolled dominion, his sudden death in the height
of his power, the fourfold division of his kingdom, and. the extinction
of his posterity; the prosperous reign of the first Ptolemy, and of the
great Seleucus, with the superior power of the latter before his death;
the reign of Philadelphus, and the marriage of Berenice his daughter
with Antiochus Theus; the murder of Antiochus and Berenice and their
infant son by Laodice; the vengeance taken by Euergetes, brother of
Bernice, on his accession to the throne; his conquest of Seleucia, the
fortress of Syria, and the idol gods which he carried into Egypt; the
earlier death of Callinicus; the preparations of his sons, Seleucus,
Ceraunus, and Antiochus the Great, for war with Egypt, are all
distinctly set before us. Then follows the history of Antiochus. His
sole reign after his brother’s death, his eastern conquests and recovery
of Seleucia; the strength of the two rival armies and the Egyptian
victory at Raphia; the pride of Ptolomy Philopater and his partial
conquests, with the weakness of his profligate reign; the return of
Antichous with added strength after an interval of years, and with the
riches of the East; his victories in Judea and the capture of Sidon; the
overthrow of the Egyptian forces at Panium, the honor shewn by Antiochus
to the Temple, and his care for its completion and beauty; his treaty
with Egypt, the marriage of his daughter Clopatra with Ptolemy
Philometor, and defection from her father’s cause; his invasion of the
Isles of Greece; his rude repulse by the Roman Consul, and the reproach
of tribute which came upon him through his defeat; his return to Antioch
and speedy death, are all described in regular order. Then follow the
reigns of Seleucus and Antiochus Epiphanes, given with an equal fitness
of prophetic detail, and close the narrative of the Third Empire. Even
in the time of the Fourth and last Kingdom, though more remote from the
days of the Prophet, the events predicted are not few. We find there,
distinctly revealed, the iron strength of the Romans, their gradual
subjugation of other powers, their fierce and warlike nature, their
cruel and devouring conquests, the stealthy policy of their empire, and
its gradual advance in the direction of the East, southward and eastward
towards the land of Israel, till it had cast down the noblest Kings, and
firmly ingrafted its new dominion on the stock of the Greek Empire. We
have next described its oppression of the Jews, the overthrow of their
City and Sanctuary by Titus, the Abomination of Desolation in the Holy
Place, and their arrogant pride in standing up against Messiah, the
Prince of princes.”  <span id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md)

<span id="ii-p26"></span>If the latter portion of these predictions were
really written previously to the, events, they must be inspired; and if
a writer of the Maccabaean period could thus accurately predict the
Conquests of Rome in the East, the whole question is decided there is no
reason whatever why the events of the Second and Third Empire should not
have been foretold as clearly as those of the Fourth. Thus the very
existence of the Book before the Jewish Canon was closed is fact which
proves all that is required. These Visions then become “the voice of Him
who sees the end from the beginning, and pronounces in his secret,
council, even on the destiny of the falling sparrow. They are designed
to stoop to the earthly estate of the Church, while they exalt her hopes
to the glory that shall be revealed. They range through everlasting
ages; but they let fall in passing a bright gleam of light that
discovers to us the ass’s colt, tied at the meeting of their ways, on
which the Lord of glory was to ride into Jerusalem. Every step in the
long vista of preparation lies before them, from the seven months reign
of Smerdis and the marriage of Berenice with Antiochus, (<span
id="ii-p26.1"></span>[Da 11:2-6](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#002.md)<span
id="ii-p26.1"></span>,) to the seven months burial of (corpses) in days
to come in the land of Israel, and the marriage supper of the Lamb. They
touch, as with an wand, the perplexed and tangled skein of human
history, and it becomes a woof of curious and costly workmanship, that;
bespeaks the skill of its Divine Artificer an outer hanging, embroidered
by heavenly wisdom, for that glorious tabernacle in which the God of
heaven will reveal himself for ever.”  <span
id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md)

<span id="ii-p28"></span>THE DIVINES OF GERMANY

<span id="ii-p29"></span>Throughout this Preface and the subsequent
Dissertions the reader will find frequent reference to The Divines or
Germany. Some of these have proposed explanations of our Prophet which
appear to the English readers manifestly erroneous, that he may fancy we
have spent too much space in confuting them. But he who would keep pace
with the Theological Investigations of the day, may derive improvement
from perusing the hypothesis of Bertholdt and De Wette, and rejoice that
they have elieked the able replies of Havernick and Hengstenberg. In
truth, the reader Of Daniel must put aside for a while the laudable
prejudices which he has been taught to cherish from his earliest days,
and descend into the arena where the contest is fiereest, — whether our
Prophet was contemporary with Nebuchadnezzar or Antiochus. To many the
question itself is startling, and that we may be prepared to meet it,
thoroughly furnished with available armory, let us glance over the wide
field of Continental Rationalism as far as it concerns the Authenticity
of Daniel.

<span id="ii-p30"></span>The system under review is a melancholy
off-shoot from the teaching of Luther and his intrepid followers. They
led men away from form, and ceremony, and imposture, to rely upon one
Book as their Rule of Faith and Duty. They did more — they sifted the
chaff from the wheat, and by discarding the Apocrypha, placed before the
eager attention of mankind the pure word of heaven. Luther and Calvin
held very distinct ideas about Revelation and Justification, and
enforced very boldly their views of the only Books which were written by
the penmanship of the Almighty. Theirs was a work of purification and of
reconstruction on the assertion of the existence of a Divine Revelation,
of its being contained in the Old and New Testaments, and of these
documents being the only Inspired Records of what we are to believe, and
how we are to live. In process of time, each Boole became the subject of
separate study — its history, its criticism, and its preservation were
respectively examined with intense eagerness — and a vast amount of
information was collected, which was totally unknown to the Early
Reformers. It soon became apparent that the Reformed Churches were
living under a totally different state of things from theft described in
the Old Testament. The events, for instance, of this Book of Daniel all
seemed so mingled and so intertwined; the ordinary occurrences of
every-day life are so interlaced with marvelous dreams and visions, and
the conduct and passions of monarchs seem so singularly controlled by an
unseen Mind, that the question occurs, Is all this literally true? Did
it all actually come to pass exactly as it is recorded? Or, Is it
allegorical, or a historical romance, or only partially inspired by
Jehovah, and tinged in its style and diction with the natural
exaggeration of Oriental imaginary? Such inquiries shew us how the mind
seeks to fathom the mysteries of what is offered to its veneration, and
have led to the conclusion, that the Sacred Books of the Hebrews are not
all pure revelation, but that they contain it amidst much extraneous
matter.  <span id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) The writers to whom we
refer have ever since the sixteenth century been attempting to define
how much of the Hebrew Scriptures is the pure and spiritual Revelation
of the Divine Mind to us, and how much is the unavoidable impurity of
the channel through which it has been conveyed. With the names of some
later critics, the modern Theologian is familiar. Gesenius, Wegscheider,
And Rohr, yet retain a powerful influence over the minds of later
students, while Schultz at Breslau, Gieseler at Gottingen, Allmann at
Heidelberg, Bretschneider at Gotha, De Wette — lately deceased — at
Basle, hare at Jena, and Weiner at Leipsic, are writers who worship
irreverently at the shrine of human reason, and either qualify or deny
the Inspiration of Revelation.

<span id="ii-p32"></span>FALSE SYSTEMS OF SCRIPTURE EXPOSITION

<span id="ii-p33"></span>An important change was necessarily made on the
minds of the successors of the Reformers, by the more general spread of
Classical Literature, and a far better acquaintance with Hebrew
philology. Here, we must allow, that some of the disciples of Luther and
Calvin were better furnished for the work of Interpretation than their
more Christian-minded masters. Ernesti, the learned philologer of
Leipsic, in 1761 laid down “The Laws of a wise Interpretation,” and has
ever since been considered as the founder of a scholar like system of
Scriptural Exposition. His principles are now universally admitted,
viz., that we must make use of history and philology of the views of the
period at which each Book was written, and of all those appliances which
improved scholarship has provided in the case of the Classical Authors
of Greece and Rome. Every attentive reader of German Theology must
perceive, that too many of their celebrated Critics have rested in this
outward appeal to mere reason and. research. Semler and Tittmann,
Michaelis and Henke, have pursued this system of accommodation so far,
that they have destroyed the very spirit and essence of a Divine
Revelation. In the Prophets, and especially in Daniel, whom Semler
includes among the doubtful Books, timre is a spiritual meaning only to
be comprehended by the moral and religious faculties; and except this
spirit be elicited, the merely outward form of prophetic dictation can
effect no religious result. Let ROHR and Paulus sneer as they please, at
the mysticism and pietism of the Evangelic Reformers, we must still
contend, that without a spirituality similar to theirs, all comments are
essentially lifeless and profitless to the soul of man. The may display
erudition, but they will not aid the spirit which hungers and thirsts
after righteousness on its way towards heaven.

<span id="ii-p34"></span>Every student who desires to become familiar
with these discussions, may consult with advantage the Dissertations of
Hengstenberg, who has written fully and ably on The Genuineness of our
Prophet. He has sketched, historically, the attacks which have been
made, and has answered every possible objection. The impurity of the
Hebrew, the words supposed to be Greek, the silence of Siraeh, the
disrespect shewn by the Jews, and the position in the Canon of
Scripture, are all ably discussed. The miracles have been called
“profuse in number and aimless in purpose;” historical errors have been
asserted, and statements called contradictory, or suspicious, or
improbable; many ideas and usages have been said to belong to later
times. These and similar arguments are used to shew the Book to be the
production of the times of Antiochus Epiphanes, but they have been fully
treated by this orthodox Professor at Berlin. He discusses most ably,
and with the most laborious erudition, those marvelous Prophecies of
this Sacred Book, which have necessarily provoked a host of assailants.
He reminds us that in the earliest ages, Porphyry devoted his twelfth
book to the assault upon this Prophet, and that we are indebted to
Jerome for a knowledge of his objections as well as for their
refutation. He asserted that the Book was composed during the reign of
Antiochus Epiphanes in Greek, “and that Daniel did not so much predict
future events as narrate past ones.”  <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) Though the imperial commands condemned
his works to the flames, yet Eusebius of Caesarea, Methodius of Tyre,
and Apollinaris of Laodicea, have ably refuted them. In later times, the
first scholar-like attack upon the genuineness of various portions was
made by J. D. Michaelis. Collins and Semler, Spinoza and Hobbes, had
each condemned the Book after his own manner but it was left for Eichorn
 <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) to lead the host of those later
theologians who have displayed their vanity and their skepticism, by the
boastfulness of their learning and the emptiness of their conclusions.
Hezel and Corrodi treat it as the work of an impostor; while Bertholdt,
Griesinger, and Gesenius, have each their own theory concerning its
authorship and contents. Other Critics have followed the footsteps of
these into paths most dangerous and delusive.

<span id="ii-p37"></span>Having replied to the most subtle objections
against the Genuineness of these Prophecies, Hengstenberg proceeds to
uphold the direct arguments in its favor. He first discusses the
testimony of the author himself, and then enters upon its reception into
the Canon of the Sacred Writings. He comments at full length on the
important passage in Josephus contra Apion. 1:8, and shews the
groundlessness of every assertion which impugns its Canonical value. He
next proves that the declaration of our Lord assumes the prophetical
authority of the work, and traces its existence in pre-Maccabaean times.
The alleged exhibition of these Writings to Alexander The Great and the
exposition of their contents to the Grecian Conqueror of the East, form
a singular episode in the midst of profound criticism. The incorrectness
of the Alexandrine Version and its rejection by the Early Church, who
substituted that of Theodotion for it, is turned into an argument
against the Maccabaean origin of the original; for certainly, a
composition of which the author and the translators were nearly
contemporary, might be better translated, than one separated by an
interval of many ages. Then the peculiar features and complexion of the
original language point out the *exact* period to which the writing is
to be assigned. The historical accuracy, the apparent *discrepancies,*
and yet the real agreement with Profane Narratives, all strengthen the
assertion, that the writer lived during the times of the Babylonian and
Persian Monarchies. Another argument, as strong as any of the former, is
deduced from the nature of the symbolism used throughout the Book. The
reasonings of Hengstenberg have now received additional confirmation
from the excavations of Layard. The prevalence of animal imagery, rudely
grotesque and awkwardly gigantic, is characteristic of Chaldean times,
and bespeaks an era previous to the Medo-Persian Sculptures at
Persepolis. Summing up his reasonings, the Professor quotes the
observation of Fenelon: “lisez Daniel, denoncant a Balthasar la
vengeance de Dieu toute prete a fondre sur lui, et cherchez dans les
plus sublimes originaux de l’antiquite quelque chose qu’on puisse
comparer a ces endroits la!”

<span id="ii-p38"></span>ENGLISH PHILOSOPHICAL SCHOOL

<span id="ii-p39"></span>The speculations which we have hitherto
discussed are not confined within the limits of unreadable German
Neology they have been transfused into English Philosophy, and presented
in a popular form to the readers of our current literature. In a learned
and speculative Work, entitled “The Progress of the Intellect, as
exemplified in the Religious Development of the Greeks and Hebrews,” the
writer  <span id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) has adopted the untenable
hypothesis of the German Neologists. In his second section of a chapter
on the “Notion of a supernatural Messiah,” he writes as follows; “During
the severe persecution under Antiochus Epiphanes, when the cause of
Hebrew faith in its struggle with colossal heathenism seemed desperate,
and when, notwithstanding some bright examples of heroism, the majority
of the higher class was inclined to submit and to apostatize, an unknown
writer adopted the ancient name of Daniel, in order to revive the almost
extinct hopes of his countrymen, and to exemplify the proper bearing of
a faithful Hebrew in the presence of a Gentile Tyrant. The object of
pseudo-Daniel is to foreshow, under a form adapted to make the deepest
impression on his countrymen, by a prophecy, half-allusive,
half-apocalyptic, the approaching destruction of heathenism through the
advent of Messiah. Immediately after the overthrow of the Four Beasts,
emblematic of four successive heathen Empires, the last being the
Macedonian with its offset, the Syrian; the kingdom would devolve to the
‘Saints of the Most High,’ that is, to the Messianic Establishment of
Jewish expectation, presided over by a being appearing in the clouds,
and distinguished, like the angels, by his human form from the uncouth
symbols of the Gentile Monarchies.”  <span
id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) He treats “Messiah” as a “title which
hitherto confined to human anointed authorities, such as kings, priests,
or prophets, became henceforth, specifically appropriated to the ideal
personage who was to be the Hope, the Expectation, and the Salvation of
Israel.” He discusses the Seventy Weeks as the fiction of the imaginary
Daniel, and terms the accompanying predictions “adventurous,” and as
turning out “as fallacious as all that had *preceded* them.” His fourth
section on Daniel’s Messiah is, if possible, more wildly conjectural
than the two preceding ones. Daniel’s idea, says he, of a supernatural
leader called “Son of Man,” became afterwards “a basis of mystical
Christology.” Those glowing passages of this Prophet, which fill the
Christian mind with awe and delight, are to this theorist “the earthly
or Messianic resurrection of pious Hebrews, which was all that was
originally contemplated in the prediction.” In thus attempting to
overthrow the Inspired authority of Daniel, he mingles the Books of
Esdras and the Jewish Targum, and is eager to catch at ally Jewish
fiction as if it were true interpretation of ancient prophecy. He
alludes to puerile Rabbinical fables as really explanatory of the Divine
Records, and mingles Zoroaster and Maimonides, Gfrorer and Eisenmenger,
as of equal value in determining abstruse points of sound criticism! The
sections with which we are concerned evince the greatest research and
the crudest opinions all hurried together without the slightest critical
skill or philosophical sagacity. With materials gathered together in the
richest abundance, he has presented us with results which are alike
baseless, futile, and injurious. Tobit and Papias, the Book of Baruch
and the Book of Enoch, are all treated as on a level with the writings
of Moses or Tacitus, Justin Martyr or a German Mystic! The public, too,
are in danger of being imposed on by a show of learning and by long
Latinized words and phrases, which merely disguise, under classical
forms, ideas with which the well-read Divine is already familiar; at the
same time, they give such an air of scholarship to these speculations,
that the unlearned may be readily deceived by their showy rationalism.
The whole work utterly fails in its attempt to explain the rites and
symbols of Jewish worship, and to give the slightest explanation of the
“theories” and “philosophies” of the Old Testament. The tendency is to
reduce it all to mysticism and symbolism, and to any other “theosophy”
which leads the mind away from the Christian assurance of one God, one
Faith, and one Spirit.

<span id="ii-p42"></span>THE RECENT EASTERN DISCOVERIES

<span id="ii-p43"></span>The strongest of all possible arguments against
these fallacious theories has lately been derived from Eastern
discovery. Fresh importation’s of sculptured rock are daily arriving in
Europe, from the sepulchers of those cities amidst which our Prophet
dwelt. The more this new vein is worked, the richer it becomes. Are we
to be told by Bleek that the writer of this Book transferred the events
of which he was a spectator to the more ancient times of Assyria and
Babylon? and that Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar were but fabulous
characters, of which the original types were Antiochus and Alexander?
 <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) Are Eichhorn and Bertholdt to make
Daniel another Homer, or Virgil, or AEschylus? Then let us appeal to the
testimony of Mm. Botta and Layard let us visit the British museum, and
under the guidance of Rawlinson and Hincks, let us peruse, in the
arrow-headed characters, the history of the Monarchs of Assyria and
Babylon, and observe how exactly those memorials of antiquity illustrate
the Visions of our Prophet. The assistance which these excavations
afford, for the elucidation of our subject, is too important to be
passed over, and we must venture upon such arguments as may properly
enter into a General Preface, while they vindicate the historical
accuracy of the interpretation which Calvin has so elaborately set
before us in the following Lectures.

<span id="ii-p45"></span>ANCIENT ASSYRIAN REMAINS

<span id="ii-p46"></span>The order of the Visions suggests the propriety
of treating, first, The Ancient Assyrian Remains; then those of Babylon
and Persepolis with such notices of the Egypt Of The Ptolemies as the
connection of the history may require.

<span id="ii-p47"></span>The earliest memorials of Assyria have not been
preserved in the records of literature, but by durable engravings on
marble and granite. Within the last fifty years the Pyramids of Egypt
have been compelled to open their lips of stone to speak for God’s Word,
and the Rosetta table suggested to Young and Champollion an alphabet by
which they read on sarcophagus and entablature the history of the
earliest dynasties of the Nile. What Lepsius and Bunsen have done for
Thebes and Memphis, Dendera and Edfou, Layard and Rawlinson are now
accomplishing for the long lost Nineveh, the majestic Babylon, and the
elegant Persepolis. It has lately been revealed to astonished Europe,
that a buried city lies, in all its pristine grandeur, beneath that huge
mound which frowns over Mosul on the banks of the Tigris. Khorsabad and
Koyunjik, Nimroud, and BEHISTUN, are now giving up their black obelisks,
their colossal bulls, and their eagle-headed warriors, to become “signs
and wonders” to our curious generation. In this general sketch we must
avoid details, however interesting we can only allude to the first
Assyrian monuments discovered by M. Botta, in 1843,  <span
id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) as containing a line of Cuneiform
Inscriptions amid winged kings and their warlike chariots. They are
deposited in the Louvre, and form the most ancient of its esteemed
collections. The elegant volumes of Layard, and the more tangible proof
of his untiring labors, now deposited in the British Museum, have thrown
new light upon the prophetic portion of the Elder Covenant. Two-coned
Conquerors, winged Chiefs, carrying either the gazelle or the goat,
sacred trees, and their kneeling worshippers —

<span id="ii-p49"></span>*The life-like statue and the breathing bust,  
The column rescued from defiling dust* —

<span id="ii-p50"></span>enable us to guess at the exploits of a long
line of kings before the age of Saul or Priam. The name of Sardanapalus
is now rescued from traditional disgrace, and ennobled in the midst; of
a hardy race of ancestors and successors. Our progress in interpreting
these arrow-headed mysteries, enables us to assign the date 1267 B.C.
for the founding of Nineveh as a settled point in Asiatic chronology.
The earliest historical document in the world is that on the north-west
palace of Nimroud built by Assar-Adan-Pal. He informs us of the
existence, and celebrates the exploits of Temen-Bar the first, the
founder of Haleh, at a time when the Hebrews were just entering the
promised land, and the Argives were colonizing the virgin valleys of
Hellas! The familiar names of Shalmaneser, Sennacherib, and Esarhaddon,
are found incised upon the enduring masonry; and it is now possible to
ascertain who founded the Mespila of Xenophon, who constructed the
towers in the south-west palace of Nimroud and who stamped his annals on
the clay cylinders in the British Museum.  <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) The Nimroud obelisk becomes a precious
relic, since it enables us to ascertain, for the first time, the events
of those nine centuries, during which Nineveh existed from its rise to
its overthrow. We are mainly concerned with the manner in which it
confirms the truthfulness of the Prophets of the Hebrews, and with the
unanswerable arguments which it supplies against the subtleties of
German Neology. The credibility of one Prophet is intimately bound up
with that of another. Whatever confirms either Isaiah or Ezekiel, throws
its reflected light upon Daniel and Hosea. The god Nisroch, in whose
temple Sennacherib was slain, (<span id="ii-p51.1"></span>[2Ki
19:37](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#037.md)<span id="ii-p51.1"></span>, and
<span id="ii-p51.2"></span>[Isa
37:38](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#038)<span id="ii-p51.2"></span>,.md) is,
repeatedly mentioned on the obelisk as the chief deity of the Assyrians.
The “Sargon king of Assyria” (<span id="ii-p51.3"></span>[Isa
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa020.htm#001)<span id="ii-p51.3"></span>.md) is
most probably the monarch who founded the city excavated by M. Botta;
and the occurrence of the name “Yehuda,” in the 33rd number of the
British Museum series, leads Interpreters to consider the passage as
alluding to the conquest of Samaria. The very paintings so graphically
described by Ezekiel, (<span id="ii-p51.4"></span>[Ezek.
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/eze023.htm#015)<span id="ii-p51.4"></span>,.md) have
reappeared upon the walls of these palaces. They are, perhaps, the very
identical objects which this Prophet beheld, for he dwelt at no great
distance from them on the banks of the Khabur, and wrote the passage
about thirteen years after the destruction of the Assyrian Empire. The
prophecy bears the date B.C. 593, and “the latest Assyrian sculpture on
the site of Nineveh must be as early as B.C. 634.”  <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) We would gladly linger over these proofs
of the truthfulness of the ancient Prophets; but further details must be
inserted in those Dissertations which accompany the text, and we close
this rapid sketch of these Assyrian remains in the touching words of
their enterprising Discoverer. “I used,” says Mr. Layard, “to
contemplate for hours these mysterious emblems, and to muse over their
intent and history. What more noble forms could have ushered the people
into the temple of their gods? What more sublime images could have been
borrowed from nature, by men who sought, unaided by the light of
Revealed Religion, to embody their conception of the wisdom, power, and
ubiquity of a Supreme Being? They could find no better type of intellect
and knowledge, than the head of a man; of strength, than rite body of
the lion; of ubiquity, than the wings of the bird. The
winged-human-headed lions were not idle creations;, the offspring of
mere fancy; their meaning was written upon them. They had awed and
instructed races which had flourished 3000 years ago. Through the
portals which they guarded, kings, priests, and warriors had borne
sacrifices to their altars, long before the wisdom of the East had
penetrated to Greece, and had furnished its mythology with symbols long
recognized by the Assyrian votaries. They may have been buried, and
their existence may have been unknown, before the foundation of the
Eternal City. For twenty-five centuries they had been hidden from the
eye of man, and they now stood forth once more in their ancient majesty.
But how changed was the scene around them! The luxury and civilization
of a mighty nation had given place to the wretchedness and ignorance of
a few half-barbarous tribes; the wealth of temples, and the riches of
great cities had been succeeded by ruins and shapeless heaps of earth.
Above the spacious hall in which they stood, the plough had passed and
the corn now waved. Egypt had monuments no less ancient and no less
wonderful, but they have stood forth for ages, to testify her early
power and renown, while those before me had but now appeared to bear
witness in the words of the Prophet, that once The Assyrian was a cedar
in Lebanon, with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud of a high
stature; and his top was among the thick boughs. His height was exalted
above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and
his branches became long, because of the multitude of the waters which
he shot forth. All the fowls of heaven made nests in his boughs, and
under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their
young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations; for now is ‘Nineveh
a desolation, and dry like a wilderness, and flocks lie down in the
midst of her; all the beasts of the nations, both the cormorant and the
bittern lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice sings in the
windows, and desolation is in the thresholds.’”  <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md)

<span id="ii-p54"></span>ANCIENT BABYLONIAN REMAINS

<span id="ii-p55"></span>As we travel onwards in time, and southward in
place, our attention is attracted to those Babylonian antiquities which
vindicate the correctness of the Comments of Calvin.

<span id="ii-p56"></span>After centuries of extensive empire, Nineveh
yielded to a younger rival. The army of Sennacherib had been annihilated
by the angel of the Lord; Esarhaddon, his son, had planted his heathen
colonizes in the fertile plains of Samaria. Nebuchadonosor had won the
battle of Rhagau; Phraortes had been slain, and his son, Cyaxares in
alliance with Nabopalassar, had taken Nineveh, and destroyed for ever
its place in the history of Asia. Palaces of black basalt, bas-reliefs,
and hawk-headed heroes, covered with legends of unbounded triumphs, no
longer rose at the bidding of the servants of Bar, and the worshippers
of Assarac, Beltis, and Rimmon. No more

<span id="ii-p57"></span>Her obelisks of buried chrysolite

<span id="ii-p58"></span>proclaimed her far-famed majesty; for her new
masters transferred the scat of their empire to the banks of the
Euphrates. The renowned son of Nabopalassar now commences the era of
Babylonian greatness. This enterprising chieftain is no creation of
poetic fancy. Herodotus and Berosus have recorded his exploits, and we
have now the testimony of recent discovery to confirm the assertions of
Daniel, and to throw fresh light upon his narrative.

<span id="ii-p59"></span>“The earliest Babylonian record that we have,”
says Major Rawlinson, “is, I think, the inscription engraved on a
triumphal tablet at Holwan, near the foot of Mount Zagros; it is chiefly
religious, but it seems also to record the victories of a certain king
named Temnin against the mountaineers. Unfortunately it is in a very
mutilated state, and parts of it alone are legible. I discovered this
tablet on the occasion of my last visit to Behistun, and with the help
of a telescope, for there are no possible means of ascending the rock,
succeeded in taking a copy of such portions of the writing as are
legible. I am not able at present to attempt a classification of the
kings of Babylon, such as they are known from the various relics that we
possess of them nor, indeed, can I say with certainty, whether the kings
recorded, with the exception of Nebuchadnezzar and his father, may be
anterior or posterior to the era of Nabonassar. The Babylonians
certainly borrowed their alphabet from the Assyrians, and it requires no
great trouble or ingenuity at the present day to form a comparative
table of the characters.”  <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md) “I have
examined,” says this enterprising traveler, “hundreds of the Hymar
bricks, (near Babylon,) and have found them always to bear the name of
Nebuchadnezzar ” Borsippa was a city in the neighborhood of Babylon, and
there is monumental” evidence of its being the capital of Shinar, as
early almost as the earliest Assyrian epoch.” Temenbar, the Obelisk
king, conquered it in the ninth year of his reign. the bricks upon the
spot are exclusively stamped with the name of Nebuchadnezzar, being at
this moment tangible proofs of the reality of the words “Is not this the
great Babylon that I have built?” The rebuilding of the city, and the
construction and dedication of the great temple is noticed “in the
standard inscription of Nebuchadnezzar, of which the India house slab
furnishes us with the best and most perfect copy ” This valuable
monument gives a detail of all the temples which he built throughout the
various cities of his extensive provinces, it names the particular
deities to whom the shrines were dedicated, and mentions other
particulars, which our present ignorance of the language enables us. but
partially to comprehend. The vast; mound of El Kasr contains the remains
of a magnificent palace, supposed to be that of Nebuchadnezzar; but as
these recent excavations are more to our present purpose, it is
unnecessary to refer at length to this majestic ruin.  <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md)

<span id="ii-p62"></span>PERSIAN AND EGYPTIAN ANTIQUITIES

<span id="ii-p63"></span>Again, in commenting on the ninth chapter,
Calvin has followed the usual method of interpreting it of Alexander and
his successors he naturally assumes them to be real predictions, and
believes them to have been accomplished according to the utterance of
their Hebrew captive. And have we no traces of the foot-prints of
Alexander now remaining to us? Not long ago, a traveler, amid the barren
plains of Persia, lighted unexpectedly on a magnificent ruin — alone, on
a deserted plain — its polished marbles, and its chiseled columns all
strewed around in wild confusion. This Chehel-Minar, or hall of forty
pillars, was built by the Genii, said the Arabs, amid the desert
solitudes of Merdusht. The Genii builders have lately been stripped of
their disguise of fable, and the long lost Persepolis, destroyed by the
mad frolic of Alexander stands revealed to the world in the
Takht-i-Jemshid. The grandeur of these pillared halls, these sculptured
staircases, and fretwork fringes of horn-bearing lions, interests the
reader of Daniel, through the inscriptions which they bear on their
surface. The ingenuity of a Westergaard and a Lassen has been displayed
in deciphering them, and has enabled us to discover the original
architects. Cyrus and Cambyses, Darius Hystaspes and Xerxes, each
erected his own portion. One portion can be assigned to the Achaenenian
dynasty, and another to the monarchs of the Sassanian family. These
inscriptions also point out where the rulers of Persia formed their
sepulchral repose. The tomb of Cyrus at Moorghab, his statue discovered
and described by Sir R. K. Porter, and “*the* thousand lines” on the
sculptured rock of Behistun,  <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) throw
a clear and brilliant light on the statements of Daniel, as well as on
the narrative of Herodotus. These passing allusions must suffice at
present — further discussions must be left for distinct dissertations —
while the ninth and tenth chapters of Vaux’s Nineveh and Persepolis will
supply additional information to all who are inclined to search for it.
Enough is introduced, if the reader is impressed with the conviction
that Daniel’s Vision; and Calvin’s Lectures are no vague or cunning
delusions, no skillful travestying of history, under the garb of either
intentional forgery or weak credulity.

<span id="ii-p65"></span>As Persepolis suggests the triumph of the
He-goat, and the rising of the four horns towards the four winds of
heaven, (<span id="ii-p65.1"></span>[Da
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan008.htm#008)<span id="ii-p65.1"></span>,.md) so it
leads us forwards towards the subsequent warfare between Asia and Egypt.
The mighty king stood ups, and his kingdom was broken and the king of
the south became strong and mighty, (<span id="ii-p65.2"></span>[Dan.
11:3](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#004)<span id="ii-p65.2"></span>..md) All
index here points to the valley of the Nile, where there now exists a
countless host of monuments, raised by the giants of the very earliest
days of out race. On the day when Cambyses, flushed with victory,
stabbed with his own hand the living Apis, and commanded the bones of
the Pharaohs to be beaten with rods, he struck to the heart the genius
of the Nile. At that moment, the quarries were teeming with busy
sculptors, numerous as swarming bees — massive monoliths were becoming
Sphinxes and Memnons, while architrave’s and propyla, worthy of the
Temple of Karnak, were emerging from the living rock. They all retired
to rest that evening, intending to renew their labor on the morrow, but
can the morrow bursts the avenging Persian, and that long train of
workers are still for ever. But their unfinished handicraft remains for
the astonishment of our later centuries. A perfect statue only awaits
one final blow to detach it from its parent rock — there runs the track
of the wheels which had come to transport it to either Edfou or Luxor;
there may be seen the very marks of the tools which lay by its side all
night, and were never used on the next fatal morning.

<span id="ii-p66"></span>Henceforth Egyptian art is transferred to the
tombs and palaces of the kings of Persia. It is cheering to feel, that
as our knowledge of the significance of these treasures advances, they
confirm the assertions of Holy Writ. Among the mural sculptures at
Karnak, one of the captives, with a Jewish physiognomy, bears the title
which we can now read — Youdah Malek, meaning a king of Judah. The
Rosetta Stone in our National Museum, which is the basis of modern
Egyptology was sculptured as late as B.C. 195 and contains decree of
Ptolemy Epiphanes, to whom Daniel is supposed to refer. The primaeval
antiquity of The Zodiac on the majestic portico Dendera, has now been
disproved. “The Greek Inscription on the pronaos refers to Tiberius and
Hadrian.” The hieroglyphic legends on the oldest portion of its walls
belong to the last Cleopatra while the Zodiac was constructed between
A.D. 12 and 132. While we willingly allow the connection between Assyria
and Egypt as early as the thirteenth century before Christ, and admit
the occurrence of its name on the Nimroud obelisk in the British Museum,
 <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) and on the sculptures of Behistun
and Nakhshi-Rustam,  <span id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) yet; we
contend. against that assumption of a false antiquity, which is assumed
for the purpose of throwing discredit upon die prophetic portions of our
Sacred Oracles.

<span id="ii-p69"></span>What, then, is the result of our rapid sketch
of these remains of the dynasties of former eras? A complete overthrow
of the baseless fabrications of German Neology. Till the arrow-headed
character was deciphered, the history of Nineveh was almost a bank to
the world. As Assyria and Babylon now breathe and live in resuscitated
glory, so all that Daniel wrote is confirmed and amplified by the
marbles and tombs which have traveled to this Island of the West. Hence
this Captive of Judah really lived while the Head of Gold was towering
majestically upon the allegorical image. Neither poet nor impostor of
the reign of Antiochus could have fancied or forged characters and
events which accord so exactly with the excavations of a Layard, or the
decipherings of a Rawlinson. Skeptical infidelity must now hide its head
for ever, and speculations of the school of Arnold must shrink into
their original insignificance.

<span id="ii-p70"></span>POSITIVE EVIDENCE

<span id="ii-p71"></span>The positive evidence of additional facts may
also be adduced. This Book was translated by The Seventy many years
before the death of Antiochus, and the translation was well known to
Jerome, although it has not come down to our age. Bishop Chandler has
pointed out fifteen places in which Jerome refers to it;  <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) and Bishop Halifax has collected many
conclusive arguments on these and kindred topics.  <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) The words of Josephus are explicit enough
as to the received opinion in his day, “you will find the Book of
Daniel, in our Sacred Writings.”  <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md)
Maimonides, indeed, has attempted to detract from its high reputation,
but has been sufficiently refuted by Abarbanel and the son of Jarchi.
 <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) The arrangement of the Jews, which
places this Book among the Hagiography, and not among the Prophets,
seems also to be intended to depreciate its Canonical value; but while
the earlier Talmudists place it with the Psalms and the Proverbs, the
later ones range it with Zechariah and Haggai.  <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) When Aquila and Theodotion translated
their Versions, he was admitted to the Prophetic rank and although we
can — not absolutely determine the point from the MS. of the Septuagint
in the Chigian Library at Rome, yet the probability is highly in its
favor. Origen places Daniel among the Prophets and before Ezekiel,
following the example of Josephus in his first book against Apion.

<span id="ii-p77"></span>JEWISH TESTIMONIES — SINAITIC INSCRIPTIONS

<span id="ii-p78"></span>Instead of following the beaten track of
reference to Jewish Comments and Rabbinical Traditions, which Calvin
always quoted and refitted, we shall here introduce a collateral branch
of singular and valuable evidence. As the surface of the Theological
world is much agitated by doubts of historic facts, originating alike
with Rationalists and Romanists, it is desirable to fortify our evidence
from existing inscriptions of correlative value with those of Nineveh.
That far-famed seceder to Rome, Dr. Newman, speaks of some “Scripture
Narratives which are quite as difficult to the reason as any miracles
recorded in the History of the Saints;” and he then instances that “of
the Israelites flight from Egypt, and entrance into the Promised Land.”
 <span id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) Anxious as the votary of either
Superstition or of Reason may be to suggest doubts as to the recorded
facts, The Rocks Of Sinai are now vocal with the voices of the moving
Tribes Valley after valley has been found in which these Sinaitic
Inscriptions abound. “Their numbers may be computed by thousands, their
extent by miles, and their positions above the valleys being as often
measurable by fathoms as by feet.”  <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md)
These hitherto unreadable remnants of a former age have now been read,
and they become fresh confirmations of the truthfulness of the Mosaic
Narrative. It is enough for our present purpose to refer to the
conclusive labors of the Rev. Charles Forster, who has compared the
characters used with those of The Rosetta Stone, with the Arrow-headed
Character, and with the Alphabets of Etruria, Palmyra, and Persepolis;
and has been enabled to read what neither Beer could decipher nor
Pococke explain.  <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) By him they are
shewn to record the bitterness of the Waters at Marah — the Flight of
Pharaoh on horseback — the Miracle of the feathered fowls, the Murmuring
at Meribah — and the Uplifting of the hands of Moses at the battle of
Rephidim. Thus the “Written Valley,” and the “Written Mountain,”’ have
rendered their testimony in favor of Revelation. “No difficulties of
situation, no ruggedness of material, no remoteness of locality, has
been any security against the gravers of the one phalanx of mysterious
scribes. The granite rocks of the almost inaccessible Mount Serbal, from
its base to its summit, repeat the characters and inscriptions of the
Sandstone’s of the Mokateh.” Countless multitudes are supposed to be yet
undiscovered. And what people but the Israelites could have engraven
them? Professor Beer allows them to be all of the same age — the soil
affords no sustenance for hordes of men, and never did provide for the
existence of a settled population. This wilderness may be periodically
traveled through, but never has been permanently settled by mankind. The
very execution of such works requires the use of ladders and platforms,
ropes, baskets, and tools, and all the usual instruments of a long
established population. But no people could have executed all this
unproductive labor without a ready supply of water and food. If, then, a
single generation carved and grayed these countless Inscriptions, how
can we account for the fact, except by the Mosaic narrative? Whence came
the bodily aliments, by which so many workmen were enabled to carry out
their hazardous employments for so long and continuous a period? Grant
that Israel coming out of Egypt performed them, and the difficulty is
solved — adopt; any other possibility, and the problem becomes perfectly
insoluble! We forbear to enter further little this important discussion;
it is enough to have awakened this train of thought, in accordance with
our previous reasonings.  <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39.md)

<span id="ii-p83"></span>THE CONTENTS OF THE BOOK OF DANIEL.

<span id="ii-p84"></span>The Contents of this Book admits of an easy and
natural division. The first part has been called “The Historical,” and
the second “The Prophetical” portions. Each contains, six chapters, and
the Comments on each, with the Editor’s, Dissertations, will
respectively occupy a Volume. The Historical Portion contains
Predictions; but they were, not uttered by Daniel himself, and seem to
spring naturally out of the events of the times. It is not without its
difficulties. The learned have differed respecting the existence of a
second Nebuchadnezzar, the person and character of Cyrus, and the reign
of Darius the Mede. Strenuous efforts have been made to show that one
Nebuchadnezzar plundered the Temple, and another was afflicted by
madness that the Koresh of the last verse of the sixth chapter is not
Cyrus The Great, but an obscure Satrap of an earlier age. A noble Duke,
those scriptural researches confer higher honor on His name than the
coronet he wears, has proposed an elaborate theory for the better
explanation of” The Times of Daniel,”  <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) and the hypothesis has met with an
equally learned reply by the author of “The Two later Visions of
Daniel.”  <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) A detail of the arguments
on both sides will be found in the Dissertation’s previously referred
to. The discrepancies between Herodotus and Xenophon, which Archbishop
Secker tried in vain to reconcile, must be again discussed; the critical
value of Ptolemy’s Astronomical Canon ascertained, and many subordinate
and collateral events examined. Calvin makes no pretensions to minute
Historical Criticism- he adopts the received opinions of his day, and if
he sometimes errs, he does so in ignorance of other sources of knowledge
which have since been opened to the world. But his diligence and his
judgment have preserved him from errors of ally ultimate importance; and
it must be always remembered that the Antiquarian Researches of later
times have thrown a flood of light upon these distant Eras. Baseless
conjecture has, indeed, done much to pervert and mystify the plainest
truths; but the materials themselves are of a most varied and intricate
character; and the satisfactory adjustment of these historical
difficulties requires the highest powers of discrimination, as well as
the most comprehensive grasp of all the conflicting evidence by which a
doubtful event is embarrassed.

<span id="ii-p87"></span>THE SEVENTY WEEKS.

<span id="ii-p88"></span>In attempting to appreciate Calvin’s Comments
on the Historical Portion of this Book, and of the celebrated period Of
“The Seventy Weeks,” it will be necessary to advert to some abstruse
points of Chronology. We would willingly avoid any tedious discussion of
dates and figures, but the interest of many important questions now
frequently turns upon such arithmetical proofs. A strong assertion of
the Chevalier Bunsen must justify us in the course which we are about to
pursue. “All the results,” says he, “of Jewish or Christian Research
are; based upon the Writings of the Old Testament and their
Interpretation, and upon the connection between the Chronological data
they supply and divine Revelation. There are points, therefore, relative
to which it is of vital importance, both to the sound thinker and the
sound critic, to arrive at a clear understanding before embarking upon
his inquiry... The question is, Whether the external History related in
the Sacred Books be externally complete, and capable of chronological
arrangement?”  <span id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) The reply should be
given “with a deep feeling of the respect due to the general
chronological statements of Scripture, which have been considered during
so many centuries as forming the groundwork of religious faith, and are
even at the present moment intimately connected with the Christian
Faith.” Let but these principles of the learned Egyptologist guide us in
our decisions, and we may hope for the blessing of Heaven in
disentangling many of the Historical intricacies which will soon come
under our notice.

<span id="ii-p90"></span>TIIE PRAETERIST, ANTI-PAPAL,  
AND FUTURIST VIEWS.

<span id="ii-p91"></span>In attempting to determine the intrinsic value
of these Lectures, it becomes necessary to compare Calvin’s Prophetic
Interpretations with those of the Divines who preceded and have followed
him. The scheme proposed for interpreting, these Visions may be classed
generally under this threefold division, viz., the Praeterist, the
Anti-Papal, and the Futurist Views. The first view is that usually
adopted, with some slight modifications, by the Primitive Church and the
Earlier Reformers. The second, sometimes called rite “Protestant”
System, supposes the Papal power to be prominently foretold by both
Daniel and Sir John; while the Third System defers the accomplishment of
many of these Prophecies to times yet future. If these three Systems be
borne distinctly in mind, it will become easy to understand how the most
popular modern explanations differ for in those of the earlier period of
the Reformation. The Primitive Church has, with few exceptions, agreed
in considering The Head of Gold to mean, either the Babylonian Empire or
the person of Nebuchadnezzar; the Silver denoting the Medo-Persian; the
Brass the Greek; and the Iron the Roman; while the mixture of the Clay
denotes the intermingling of Conquered Nations with the power of Heathen
Rome. In interpreting the Four Beasts, the Lion denotes the Babylonian
Empire; the Eagle Wings relate to Nebuchadnezzar’s ambition; the Bear to
the Medo-Persians; the Leopard to the Macedonians; and the Fourth Beast
to the Romans. The Ten Horns were differently explained; some referring
them to Ten individual Kings, and others to Ten Divisions, of the
Empire; some supposing them to commence with the Roman sway in the East,
others not till the Fourth or Fifth Centuries after Christ.

<span id="ii-p92"></span>Calvin differs slightly from the earlier, and
most materially from the later Commentators. Supposing the Fourth Boast
to typify the Roman Empire, “The Tell Kings,” he says, “were not persons
succeeding each other in dominion, but rather the complex Form of the
Government instead of a unity under one head.” The number “ten” is, he
thinks, indefinite, for “many,” and the Sway of a Senate instead of a
Monarchy is the true, fulfillment of the Prophecy. The rise of one King
and his oppressing three, refers to the two Caesars, Julius and
Octavius, with Lepidus and Antony. How unconscious was Calvin that
succeeding Protestant Writers would determine The “Little Horn” to be
the Pope, and the Three Kings, the Exarchate of Ravenna, the Kingdom of
Lombardy, and the State of Rome. Here the multitude of modern
commentators differ most materially from the author of these Lectures.
The “Time, Times, and Half a Time” of this chapter, Calvin refers to the
persecution of the Christian Church under Nero, and similar tyrannical
Emperors of Rome, and gives not the slightest countenance to any
allusion in these words to a specified number of years. “Time and Times”
are with him a long undefined period; and “Half a Time” is added in the
spirit of the promise to shorten the time, for the Elects sake. Those
modern Writers, who think the Year-Day theory essential to the full
exposition of the Visions of Daniel, will be disappointed by the opinion
of our Reformer. He takes no notice of either the 1260 years of the
Papacy, or the 1290 years for the reign of Antichrist. Again, there are
Writers who deny the Fourth Beast to refer to Rome at all. Rosenmuller
and Todd are instances; and each of these has his own way of
interpreting the concluding portion of this chapter. The former asserts
it to be fulfilled in the Greek Empire in Asia after Alexander’s death,
and the latter supposes it to be yet future. According to Dr. Todd and
the Futurists, it has yet to be developed. Its fulfillment shall be the
precursor of The Final Antichrist, whom the Lord shall destroy with the
brightness of his Personal Advent. This Antichrist shall tyrannize in
the world for the “Time, Times, and Half a Time,” that is, for the
definite space of three years and a half, till the Ancient of Days shall
proclaim The Final Close Of The Gentile Dispensation.

<span id="ii-p93"></span>The three views, then, of the Interpretation of
these Prophecies are thus clearly distinguished. The *Praeterits,* view
treats them as fulfilled in past historical events, taking place under
the several Empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Heathen Rome. The
modern *Anti-Papal* view treats “The Little Horn” as the Pope, and the
drays as years; and this stretches the predictions over the Twelve
Centuries of European struggle between the Ecclesiastical and the Civil
Powers. The *Futurist* is dissatisfied with the Year-Day theory he
cannot agree with the past fulfillment of these glowing images of future
blessedness. Hence, instead of either Antiochus, Mahomet, Nero, or the
Pope, he sees a future Antichrist in the Eleventh Horn of the seventh
chapter, in The Little Horn of the eighth chapter, and ht The Willful
King of the eleventh chapter. He rejects entirely the Year-Day
explanation, and every assertion which is based upon it,; he takes the
days literally as days, and supposes them yet unfulfilled. The “Toes” of
the image, and the “Horns” of the beasts, are not to him Kingdoms or
Successions of Rulers of any kind, but single individual persons. The
phrase, The Pope, as equivalent to a “Horn*,*” is to him a fallacy as it
does not mean one person, like an Alexander or a Seleucus; or a single
despotic Antichrist — but a long succession of Rulers, one after
another.  <span id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) Faber, for example,
interprets “the Scriptures of Truth,” chapter 11, by extending it
throughout all history, till the end of the Gentile Dispensation. Dr.
Todd refers it solely to its close, and contends very strongly against
the usual explanation of the Fourth verse. Elliott, again, (Horae Apoc.,
volume 3,) expounds this chapter to the 35th verse with great propriety
and clearness, but passes at once from the Ptolemidae and Seleucidae to
the Pope, as signified by “The Willful King.” The Days then become
Years, and. the various phases of the Papacy throughout many centuries
are supposed to be predicted here, and fulfilled by the decrees of
Justinian, persecutions of the Waldenses, French Revolutions, and
catastrophes and convulsions yet to come. Our American brethren have
adopted similar theories. Professor Bush in his “Hierophant,” has
inserted an able exposition of the “Little Horn,” as unquestionably the
Ecclesiastical Power of the “Papacy,”  <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) and introduced the Goths and Charlemagne
as fulfilling their own portions of this interesting Vision. Professor
Stuart, however, of Andover, and some of his followers, have returned to
the simplicity of the Earlier Expositors.  <span
id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45.md)

<span id="ii-p97"></span>CALVIN PROPHETIC SCHEME.

<span id="ii-p98"></span>Calvin, then, was, on the whole, a Praeterits.
He saw hi the history of the world before the times of the Messiah the
fulfillment of the Visions of this Book. They extended from
Nebuchadnezzar to Nero. “The Saints of the Most High” were to him either
the Hebrew or the Christian Church under heathen persecutors they had a
glimpse indeed of the times of the Messiah, and expressed his views in
general language; but he rejected the idea of any series of
fulfillment’s through a succession of either Popes or Sultans. He saw in
these four-footed beings, neither Mahomet, nor Justinian, nor the
Ottoman Empire, nor the Albigensian Martyrs. Heathen Rome, and its
Senate, and its early Caesars, were to him what Papal Rome, and its
Priesthood, and its Gregories, have been to later Expositors.

<span id="ii-p99"></span>Our Second Volume, which contains The
Prophetical Portion of the Book, will be illustrated by many
*Dissertations,* which will condense the sentiments of later Expositors.
Ample scope will then be given to important details. Extracts will be
made from the most approved Moderns, and copious references to the best
sources of information. IT will be sufficient here to insert the reply
of Professor Bush of New York to Professor Stuart of Andover, as
illustrating the importance of the difference between those who adopt
the Year-Day theory and those who do not “Denying *in* *toto,* as I do,
and disproving, as I think I have done, the truth of your theory in
regard to the literal import of Day, I can of course see no evidence,
and therefore feel no interest in your reasonings respecting the events
which you consider as the fulfillment of these splendid Visions. If a
*Day* stands for a *Year,* and a *Beast* represents an *Empire,* then we
are imperatively remanded to a far different order of occurrences in
which to read the realization of the mystic scenery from that which you
have indicated. As the Spirit of Prophecy has under his illimitable ken
the most distant future as well as the nearest present, I know nothing,
in reason or exegesis, that should prevent the affairs of the Christian
economy being represented by Daniel as well as by John. As the Fourth
Beast of Daniel lives and acts through the space of 1260 years, and as
the Seven-headed and Ten-horned beast of John prevails through the same
period, and puts forth substantially the same demonstrations, I am
driven to the conclusion that they adumbrate precisely the same thing —
that they are merely different aspects of the same really — and this, I
have no question, is the *Roman, Empire.* This you deny; but I submit
that the denial can be sustained only by shewing an adequate reason why
the Spirit of God should be debarred from giving such extension to the
Visions of the Old Testament Prophets. Until this demand is satisfied,
no progress can be made towards convincing the general mind of
Christendom of the soundness of your Expositions. The students of
Revelation will still reiterate the query, Why the oracles of Daniel;
should be so exclusively occupied with the historical fates of Antiochus
Epiphanes? If I do not err in the auguries of the times, a struggle is
yet to ensue on the prophetic field between two conflicting parties, on
whose banners shall be respectively inscribed, *Antiochus and
Antichrist.*”  <span id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md)

<span id="ii-p101"></span>OECOLAMPADIUS, ZUINGLE, AND BULLINGER.

<span id="ii-p102"></span>This is precisely the point that these
Lectures will assist in determining, and the following sketches of the
opinions of the immediate predecessors and successors of our Reformer,
will be useful hi guiding the judgment of the reader.

<span id="ii-p103"></span>One of the most learned of the Commentators
among the Early Reformers was Oecolampadius, the well-known companion of
Zuingle. Bullinger published his notes on the Prophets about fifty years
before Beza edited Calvin’s *Lec*tures. His character for piety and
profound erudition stood high among his contemporaries, and his
elaborate expositions of the Prophets form a tangible proof of his
industry, ingenuity, and Christian proficiency. Some account of the
method in which he treats these interesting questions will here be
appropriate. He divides the Book into the two natural divisions — the
Historical and the Prophetical. His remarks on the former portion
contain nothing which demands our notice at present; but his second
division contains some valuable comments. He takes the Four Beasts of
chapter 7 for the Babylonian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman Empires,
dwells on the cruelties of Sylla and Marius, Tiberius and Nero; and
accuses Aben-Ezra and the Jews of denying this Fourth Beast to mean
Heathen Rome, lest they should be compelled to embrace JESUS as their
Messiah. He is not satisfied with Jerome’s opinion, that the Ten Horns
mean Ten Kings, who should divide among them the territories of the
Roman power. He takes the numbers “ten” and “*seven*” for complete and
perfect numbers, quoting from the parable, “The kingdom of heaven is
like *ten* virgins.” He quotes and approves of Hippolytus, who asserts
“the Little Horn” to mean the Antichrist., to whom St. Paul alludes in
the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians. Apollinarius and other
Ecclesiastical Writers judge rightly in adopting this interpretation,
while Polychronius is *deceived* by Porphyay in referring it to
Antiochus. But who is this Antichrist? Is he supposed to rule after the
destruction of Heathen or of Papal Rome? Oecolampadius furnishes us with
many opinions — some supposing Mahomet, others Trajan, and others the
Papal See. He quotes the corresponding passage in the Apocalypse, and
implies that the successors of Mahomet and the occupiers of the Chair of
St. Peter are equally intended. By thus introducing the modern history
of Europe and of Asia, he leans rather to the second of those divisions
into which Commentators on Daniel have been divided. On this testing
question of “the Time, Times, and Half a Time” he assumes it to mean
three years and a half, he has no limit of any extension of the time
through 1260 years; adding, “there is no reason why we should be
religiously bound to that number, or follow puerile and uncertain
triflings.” He will not allow Antichrist to be only a single person, and
thus throws an air of indefiniteness over the whole subject.

<span id="ii-p104"></span>Consistently with these principles, he
interprets “The Willful King” of chapter 11 by both Mahomet and the
Papacy; and explains how this twofold power should be destroyed in the
Holy Land. The repetition in the numbers in chapter 12 is treated very
concisely. Literal days are said to be intended, and the possibility of
ascertaining certainty is doubted. “*If* any one has detected any
certainty in these obscure dates, I do not envy him the exposition
already offered satisfies me; for it is not in our power to know the
precise divisions of the time (*articulos temporum*) ” Throughout the
whole Comment of Oecolampadius, there is a tone of pity, and a
proficiency in correct interpretation which we seek for in vain in some
disciples of the Early Reformers. He was evidently a spiritually-minded
man, and was always preaching Christ in his Comments on the Old
Testament. In this respect he equals, and if possible surpasses the more
elaborate Calvin. The extreme spirituality of this eminent Reformer
entitles him, in these days, to more notice than he receives. His
constant effort’s to honor Christ as his Redeemer, and the practical and
persevering manner in which he preaches the gospel of his Redeemer, in
his *Old* Testament Exposition, should render his writings familiar to
every sincere and simple-minded Christian. And we are not surprised when
we hear competent judges of the difference between Calvin and himself
prefer the tone of his remarks to that of his more vigorous ally.

<span id="ii-p105"></span>GROTIUS

<span id="ii-p106"></span>The Commentary of Grotius is also worthy of
comparison with that of Calvin. He is very precise and minute in shewing
how the history of the East has borne out the truthfulness of the
predictions; and is, perhaps, more accurate in details than his
predecessor he differs, indeed, in a few points of importance, which
will be separately noticed, but, on the whole, his remarks are correct
and judicious. The Ten Kings of the seventh chapter (<span
id="ii-p106.1"></span>[Da 7](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#000.md)<span
id="ii-p106.1"></span>) he considers to be Syrian Monarchs, and
enumerates them as Seleuci, Antioch, and Ptolemaei. Polanus and Junius,
two Commentators who are constantly quoted by Poole, in his Synopsis,
treat the passage in a similar way. The king to arise after them is
still confined to the Jewish era, and “the Time, Times,” etc., are
supposed to be literally three years and a, half. The 36th verse of
chapter 11 (<span id="ii-p106.2"></span>[Da
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036)<span id="ii-p106.2"></span>.md),
Grotius interprets of Antiochus Epiphanes, and is supported by Junius,
Polanus, Maldonatus, Willet, and Broughton. The “Days” of the twelfth
chapter are taken literally by all the Commentators quoted by Poole from
Calvin to Mede, and all sup — pose the period intended to be during the
reign of the successors of Alexander. Mede was the well-known reviver of
the Year-Day theory. Before his time it was a vague assertion, he first
gave it shape, and form, and plausible consistency, and since his day it
has been adopted by many intelligent Critics, among whom are Sir Isaac
Newton, Bishop Newton, Faber, Frere, Keith, And Birks.

<span id="ii-p107"></span>MALDONATUS.

<span id="ii-p108"></span>The Commentary of Maldonatus, the Jesuit,
demands more extended notice, as he lived about the times of our author,
and calls him *Patriarcha Hereticorum,* and looks upon the subject from
exactly the opposite point of view. His exposition of Jeremiah, Baruch,
Ezekiel, and Daniel, was published at Moguntiae, (Mentz,) 1611. In his
*procemium* he sketches the life of Daniel, and defends his Book against
Porphyry, the Manichaeans, and the Anabaptists. He quotes the mention
made of Daniel by Ezekiel, and lays it down as a rule, that our
ignorance of the author of a book does not impeach its Canonical
Authority; and in the spirit of his Religious Society, lays special
stress upon the judgment and decision of “*the* Church.” He next argues
in favor of the Apocryphal Books attributed to this Prophet, and then
prefers the authority of his Church to the testimony of Jerome. He
defends the canonicity of the stories of Susannah and the Idol Bel, and
comments on them in two additional chapters, and places “The Song of the
Three Children” between <span id="ii-p108.1"></span>[Da
3:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/dan003.htm#023.md)<span id="ii-p108.1"></span>,
translating from Theodotion’s version. There is nothing worthy of
special notice in his remarks on the first six chapters; but the next
six treat of the reign’s of Christ. and of Antichrist. In accordance
with this view, he decides upon the Fourth Beast of tale seventh chapter
as the Roman Empire, after rejecting the opinion of Aben-Ezra in favor
of the Turks, and that of Porphyry, who thought it to be the successors
of Alexander. Respecting the “Little Horn,” his wrath is stirred up,
for” the heretical Lutherans and Calvinists, and other monstrous sects,”
had dared to pronounce it to be the Roman Pontiff. “But this
interpretation even their master, Calvin, has shewn to be absurd.”
 <span id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) He combats the notion that by one
term all the Roman Pontiffs are intended; and then triumphantly asks,
Where are the “Three” whom this single one was to pluck up? He further
inquires, Whether all were past in his own day, or all future? He
determines that it is all yet to be fulfilled, and thus becomes an
adherent to the cause of the Futurists. As neither the Ten Horns nor the
Eleventh have yet come into existence, it is natural to conclude the
Eleventh to be that Antichrist whom Jerome represents not as a Demon,
but a man in whom “a whole Satan shall corporally dwell.” He shall
reign, he thinks, three years and a half — a distinct and fixed period —
objecting to what he calls “figurt; Calvini,” viz., that an uncertain
period is intended by so clear an expression. The, various opinions of
his predecessors on <span id="ii-p109.2"></span>[Da
11:36](../../../bib/kjv/dan011.htm#036.md)<span id="ii-p109.2"></span>,
move rather his derision than his wrath. Their notions about
Constantine, and Mahomet, and the Roman Pontiffs, do not need his
serious refutation. Almost all Catholics, he adds, both ancient and
modern, refer it to the Antichrist. He also accuses the greater part of
“the New Heretics” of stating the Michael of the 12th chapter to be,
Messiah himself; and treats the “days” of the close of this chapter as
partly fulfilled under the Jewish and partly under the Christian
dispensations. His inconsistency in this interpretation is more apparent
than in the preceding ones; while his work on the whole is worthy of
perusal, as he quotes with judgment the opinions of learned Jews and of
the earlier Commentators of the Christian Church.

<span id="ii-p110"></span>Within the first century after the
Reformation, the views of Divines respecting these Prophecies were far
more in accordance with the ancient Greek and Latin Fathers than those
prevalent in the present day. The student who would know how Melancthon,
Osiander, and Bullinger treated the subject in reply to Bellarmine,
Fererius, and other Romish Divines, may profitably consult Willet’s
Hexapla in Danielem, published at Cambridge in 1610, and dedicated to
King James I. The arguments of the ancients in reply to “wicked
Porphirie” are collected and reviewed, the opinions of various Jewish
writers are stated and confuted, and no valuable remark of any preceding
Commentator is overlooked. For instance, the Fourth Beast of the seventh
chapter is explained according to the Jews, as the Turkish, and to
Jerome, of the Roman empire but he decides it to be the kingdom of
Syria, under the sway of Seleucus and his posterity. The “Little Horne”
is said to be Antiochus; and Calvin’s view, connecting it with Augustus
and the following Emperors, is thus treated — “But though these things
may, by way of analogy, be thus applied, yet, historically, as hath been
shewed at large, this prophecy was fulfilled before the coming of the
Messiah into the world.” Bullinger refers it to. the Pope, and others to
the Turks; and “These applications, by way of analogie, we mislike not.”
The “rimes” are supposed, by the majority of these writers quoted, to be
single years, and the whole period three years and a half. His laborious
industry respecting the “Seventy Weeks” is most instructive; and he
deserves the greatest possible credit for the patience with which he has
examined all authorities, and the acuteness with which he has discussed
the most opposite opinions. He is careful in remarking the various
readings of the text, and the different renderings of all preceding
versions. The eleventh chapter he treats as all fulfilled in the history
of Syria and Palestine before the birth of Christ. He discusses with
much ability the question, whether Antichrist is a single person, or a
succession of Rulers, as Caliphs or Popes, and presents us with the
decisions of the leading Fathers, Romanists, and Reformers on the “notes
and marks wherein Antiochus and Antichrist agree.” All who would see
Bellarmine fully confuted, and the enormities of this chapter brought
home to the several occupants of the See of Rome, will peruse Willet
with eagerness and profit. He will also find Calvin’s Interpretations
clearly stated and fairly compared with those of the most celebrated
Reformers and their most acute antagonists. The days of the twelfth
chapter are taken literally, and no hint is given of any elaborate
theory of a dozen centuries, extending through the modern history of
Europe. To all who love to trace the progress of opinion, respecting the
intercourse between men and angels, “the Ancient of Daies,” the Opening
of the Books, Michael the Prince, and the application of these
Prophecies to the Turks, the Papacy, and the times of a yet future
Antichrist, will find hi the “Hexapla” a storehouse of valuable
material, where he may exercise, with all freedom, the liberty of
choice. It proposes and answers 593 questions, and discusses 134
controversies, the greater part of the latter division being directed
against the doctrines aid practices of the Church of Rome.

<span id="ii-p111"></span>JOSEPH MEDE.

<span id="ii-p112"></span>A formidable opposition to the principles
propounded in these Lectures is found in the writings of Joseph Mede.
That learned and ingenious author is usually held as the ablest and
earliest expositor of the Year-Day theory. It is neither necessary nor
possible for us here either to confirm or confute all his hypotheses; we
can only refer to his “*Revelatio Antichrist, sive de Numeris
Daniel*’*s, 1290 1335.*” (Works, page 717.) The first part is occupied
by refuting Broughton and Junius, who assert those mystic days to have
been literally fulfilled during the Wars of Antiochus. The prediction,
he thinks, fulfilled in the twelfth century of our era, when the
persecutions of the Papal See, against the Heretics of those days, are
said to verify the words of the Prophet. Dr. Todd has thought this
treatise worthy of a detailed refutation, and to all who are interested
in determining whether Antichrist is a Succession of Rulers or a single
person, his learned remarks are worthy of attentive perusal. In
pursuance of his own ideas respecting a personal future Antichrist, he
is led to dispute the division of Alexander’s empire into four parts,
and to quote at full length various authorities, especially Venema, who
endeavored to shew the number of divisions to be ten, and that the
portion of chapter 8 usually interpreted of the Roman was really
fulfilled by the Grecian Empire in the East.  <span
id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md)

<span id="ii-p114"></span>Calvin then, we find, agrees entirely with
Venema, and by anticipation confutes the arguments of Dr. Todd. He
thinks it surprising, that men versed in Scripture can thus substitute
darkness for light. He is supported by Melancthon and Michaelis,
Hengstenberg and Rosenmuller as well as by Theodoret and most of the
Greek Expositors. He treats those more leniently who modestly and
considerately suppose the times of Antiochus to be figurative of those
of Antichrist. At this “figura Calvini” Maldonatus sneers; and yet if we
determine that Calvin’s solution is right, it is the very principle by
which the perusal of Holy Scripture becomes profitable to us. “I
desire,” says he, “to treat the Sacred Oracles reverently; but I require
something certain.” “If any one wishes to adapt this passage to present
use, he may refer it to Antichrist*,*” on the principle, “that whatever
happened to the Ancient Church, occurred for our instruction.” Hence he,
allows of a double sense, and raises a question which has been ably
contended for and against by many subsequent Divines. It is too
important to be passed over, and will demand our notice in our Second
Volume.

<span id="ii-p115"></span>The followers of Mede have met with a
formidable antagonist, and the adherents of Calvin a staunch supporter
in the late Regius Professor of Hebrew in the University of Cambridge.
Dr. Lee, in his pamphlet on the Visions of Daniel and St. John  <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) has stated his reasons for adhering to
the Older Interpreters, thus adopting the principle of the Praeterists,
and entirely discarding the slightest reference to the Pope and the
Papacy. His conclusions may be exhibited in a few words. Respecting
Nebuchadnezzar’s Image, “the feet must of necessity symbolize *Heathen*
Rome in its last times.” “Papal Rome cannot, therefore, possibly be any
prolongation of Daniel’s Fourth Empire.” “These Kings,” represented by
the *Toes,* “may, therefore, be supposed in a mystical sense to be, as
the digits ten, a round number, and signifying a whole series.”  <span
id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) “The Little Horn” is said to be Heathen
Rome — its persecuting Emperors from Nero to Constantine fulfilling the
Prophetic conditions. The phrase “a Time, Times, and a Half,” is said to
refer to the “latter half (mystically speaking) of the Seventieth *Week*
of our Prophet.” “Daniel’s Week of seven days — equivalent here to
Ezekiel’s period of seven years — is, we find, divided into two parts
mystically considered halves, or of three days and a half.”  <span
id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) \[...\] “That the Roman Power took away
the Daily Sacrifice, arid cast down the place of its Sanctuary, it is
impossible to doubt. Titus, during the reign of his father Vespasian
desolated Jerusalem by destroying both the City and the *Sanctuary.*”
Thus in his general principles of Exposition, this celebrated Hebraist
pronounces his verdict in favor of Calvin and his interpretation.

<span id="ii-p119"></span>No notice is taken in these Lectures of the
Deutero-Canonical additions, to this Prophet. In the versions of the
Septuagint, and that of Theodotion, there are some additions, to this
Book which are not found in the Hebrew Canon. Jerome translated these
from the version of Theodotion, and ably replies to the objection of
Porphyry by denying the canonicity of the following treatises, viz., The
Prayer of Azarias, the Song of The Three Children, the History of
Susanna, and The Story of Bel and the Dragon. Eusebius also denies the
identity between the Prophet and the Son of Abdias, the priest who ate
of the table of the King of Babylon. De Wette, in his *Lehrbuch,* has
discussed the, criticism of these treatises with great ability. As early
as the second century, the Septuagint Version of Daniel was superseded
by that of Theodotion; and the former was lost till it was discovered
and published at Rome in 1772. The views of De Wette, and of” Alber Of
Pesth, who contends. against Jahn for the historic truth of these
variations,” will be found in the Addenda to Daniel in Kitto’s
Cyclopaedia. The Commentators of the Romish Church feel bound in honor
to defend these additional portions. Their best arguments will be found
in a praiseworthy attempt of J. G. Kerkherdere Historian to his Catholic
Majesty Charles III,. to explain some difficulties in this Prophet.
 <span id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) He considers, the number of
Daniel’s Treatises to be a dozen. He places the history of his own Youth
first, that of Susanna second, the Story of Bel and the Dragon third,
and Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream fourth; and. then with great precision and
clearness, enters upon those historical questions which need both
acuteness and research in their treatment.  <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) Bellarmine also dwells on the testimony
of the Greek Fathers, but meets, with an able opponent in Willet, the
laborious author of the *Hexapla in Danielem.*  <span
id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md)

<span id="ii-p123"></span>It must not be forgotten that portions of this
Book, like that of Ezra, are written in Chaldee. From the fourth verse
of chapter 2 to the end of chapter 7., the language is Chaldee.
Rosemuller assigns as a reason for this, the desire of the author to
represent Nebuchadnezzar and the Magi as speaking in the language of
their country. However valid this reason may be for the earlier
chapters, it is not equally so for the sixth and seventh, since the
Medes and Persians probably used the Persian tongue. Abarbenel, in the
preface to his *Commentaries,* supposes that Chaldee was no longer in
use after the taking of the city; and that Daniel, through ignorance of
Persian, returned to the use of Hebrew. C.B. Michaelis, however, demurs
to this, and suggests that the use of either tongue was arbitrary, just
as modern scholars use either Latin or their own vernacular tongue
according to their *convenience* and taste. The occurrence of this older
form of the Aramaic idiom has been seized upon by the opponents of the,
authenticity of this Book, while its use has been ably explained and
vindicated by Hengstenberg.  <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md)

<span id="ii-p125"></span>**THE RELIGIOUS, SOCIAL,  
AND POLITICAL VALUE OF CALVIN**’**S**

<span id="ii-p126"></span>METHOD OF EXPOSITION.

<span id="ii-p127"></span>In concluding our Introductory Remarks it will
be useful to offer a few suggestions on the Religious, Social, and
Political value of Calvin’s Method of Exposition throughout these
Lectures. Such suggestions are the more appropriate in these days when
views directly adverse to our Reformer’s are extensively popular through
the ingenious theories of Faber, Elliott, and Cumming. Those who have
imbibed their views will pronounce these Volumes profitless and barren.
“*What* can it benefit us,” they will ask, “*in* the present day, to
know how many Kings reigned from Cyrus to Xerxes; the changes in the
Empire of Alexander; the troops which fought at Raphia; the marriage of
Bernice, and the, results of the invasion of Greece by Antiochus,...”
 <span id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) “Why not suffer these antiquated
facts of history to sleep quietly in the dust, and bend our strength to
the controversies and practical movements of the present hour?” May we
not reply, that he is best able to understand and unfold the religious
phases of the age in which he lives, who is most familiar with the
events and opinions of all preceding times. A man can permanently
impress his own age with the precepts of spiritual wisdom, who knows
nothing but what his own eyes have seen, and his own hands have handled.
The ever varied messages of the Holy Spirit have always combined
historical reality with the deepest spiritual significance. The details
of Profane History and its comparison with the Sacred Text will never,
by itself, enable us to reap the full harvest of solid improvement from
the perusal of these Sacred Oracles. We must dive deeper than the
surface. We must look at them in the light of one majestic and solemn
truth. They are all “the foreseen counsels and works of the living God;
the vast scheme of Providence which he has ordained for his own glory,
and steps in the fulfillment of his everlasting counsel.”

<span id="ii-p129"></span>We are fully aware, that many will pronounce
these Volumes deficient in spiritual life, and in Protestant zeal. But
the Christian who dares not dogmatize beyond the direct teachings of the
Spirit of God, will apply them indirectly to the events of the present
era, on the intelligible principles of Sacred Analogy. They thus become
a portion of that Divine Lesson which fulfilled Prophecy is ever reading
to the Church of God. They display His ceaseless dominion over the wills
of Sovereigns and over the destinies of Nations. When abstract truths
are felt to be powerless in breaking the spell of worldliness, and in
piercing within the charmed circle of social strife and political party,
these embodied proofs of an ever-watchful Deity may awe men into
submission to his sovereign will. The hollow maxims of earthly policy
will never be superseded till men reverence the God Of Daniel, and, like
the heavenly Elders, cast all their crowns of intellect and renown
before His throne. From the days of Nebuchadnezzar and of Cyrus, we see
in every change the foot;-prints of a guiding Deity. “The reigns of
Cambyses, Smerdis, and Darius; the armament of Xerxes, with its
countless myriad’s; the marches, and counter-marches, and conflicts, the
subtle plots and shifting alliances of contending kings, long before
they occurred, were noted down in the Scriptures of Truth — the Secret
Volume of the Divine counsels. All of them, before they rose into birth,
were revealed by the Son of God to his holy Prophets; and they remain
till the end of time an imperishable monument of His Providence and
foreknowledge. All was foreseen by His wisdom and ordained by his
Sovereign power. The passing generations of mankind, while they see,
this blue arch of Providence above them, and around them, sure and
steadfast, age after age, like Him who has ordained it, must feel a deep
and quiet reverence take possession of their soul.” The minuteness of
detail in the visions concerning Alexander and Ptolemy Soter, and the
repulse of Antiochus, convey the same instructive lesson. “Every royal
marriage, like that of Berenice or Cleopatra, with all its secret issues
of Peace or war, of discord or union; the levying of every army, the
capture of every fortress, the length of every reign, the issue of every
battle, the lies of deceitful ambition, the treachery of councilors, the
complex web of policy, woven out of ten thousand human wiles, and each
of them agahl the product of ten thousand various influences of good and
evil, all are portrayed with unerring accuracy in the ‘Scriptures of
Truth.’” \[...\] “The pride of Antiochus the Great, his successful
ambition and military triumphs, his schemes of politic affinity, nay,
even his prudent regard for the house of God, cannot avert. the sentence
written against him, for his fraud and violence in the Word of Truth. In
the height of seeming power, his own reproach is turned against him, and
he tumbles and falls, and is not found.”

<span id="ii-p130"></span>If, then, we conclude with Calvin, that the
persecution of the Little Horn and the idolatries of the Willful King
are past, on what principle are we to derive instruction from their
perusal? By the induction’s of a Divine analogy, by the assertion that
“all *which has passed is in some sense typical of all that is to
come.*” “The Saints of the Most High” are always the special objects of
Jehovah’s regard; they ever meet with an oppressor as fierce as
Antiochus, and as hateful as “*the* Man of Sin*;*” but still, whatever
their sufferings under a Guise or an Alva, they shall ultimately “take
the Kingdom,” and possess it for ever. Strongholds of Mahuzzim there
always. will be, under either the successors of Medici or the
descendants of Mahomet. The evidence of Gibbon, which has been used so
freely by many modern theorists, is equally valuable on the hypothesis,
that similar relations between the Church and the world occur over and
over again in the course of successive ages. A parallel may often be
drawn by an ingenious mind between the persecutions of Heathen and of
Papal Rome, and the temptation is, always great to refer the fulfillment
of Prophecy exclusively to that system of things with which we are
immediately and personally concerned. Military ambition, subtle policy,
the arts of Statesmen, the voice of excited multitudes, the passions of
*every* hour, the delusions of every age — all must pass in silent
review Under the *eye* of heaven. They are repeated with every
successive generation under an infinite variety of outward form, but
with a perfect identity in spirit and in feeling. It may be safely
asserted, that every social and political change from the times of
Nebuchadnezzar to those of Constantine, have had their historic parallel
from the days of Charlemagne to those of Napoleon. Hence, Predictions
which originally related to the Empires of the East, may be naturally
transferred to the transactions of Western Christendom. At the same
time, there never may have been the slightest intention in the mind of
the writer to apply them in this double sense. We cannot venture to
discuss all the arguments either for or against the double sense of
Prophecy. Calvin, at least, opposed it strongly, and whenever he swerved
from the literal version, he substituted the principle of accommodation,
according to the educated taste of an experienced Expounder of Holy
Writ. It will, perhaps, be our truest wisdom to listen to the judicious
advice of Bishop Horsley — “Every single text of prophecy is to be
considered as a portion of an entire system, and to be understood in
that sense which may best connect it with the whole. The sense of
Prophecy, in general, is to be sought in the events which have actually
taken place \[...\] To qualify the Christian to make a judicious
application of these rules, no skill is requisite in verbal criticism —
no proficiency in the subtleties of the logician’s art — no acquisition
of recondite learning. That degree of understanding with which serious
minds are ordinarily blessed — those general views of the schemes of
Providence, and that general acquaintance with the Prophetic language
which no Christian can be wanting in these qualifications will enable
the pious, though unlearned Christian, to succeed in the application of
the Apostle’s rules.” (<span id="ii-p130.1"></span>[2 Pet.
1:20](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#020.md),
[21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#021)<span id="ii-p130.1"></span>..md)
 <span id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) While this sentiment is cheering
to the humble minded believer, another principle laid down by the same
author must never be omitted. The meaning of a prediction “never can be
discovered without a general knowledge of the principal events to which
k alludes.” Let Calvin, then, be judged by this simple test — and before
we venture to condemn him, let us be equally patient, and equally
careful to gather all the information within our reach.

<span id="ii-p132"></span>CONTEMPORARY EVENTS IN FRANCE.

<span id="ii-p133"></span>The period when our Reformer addressed these
Lectures To All The Pious Worshippers Of God In France, is now worthy of
our attention. Calvin writes from Geneva at the close of the month of
August A.D. *1561,* immediately preceding that Colloquy at Poissy to
which reference was made in the preface to Ezekiel.  <span
id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) His Letter depicts so faithfully the
state of persecution in which the Christians of France were placed, and
compares it so efficiently with the condition of Daniel and the pious
worshippers of God under Nebuchadnezzar, that the more we know of the
times in which Calvin wrote, the more complete the parallel appears. An
animated sketch of this eventful era has lately been published by the
Queen’s Professor of Modern History in the University of Cambridge; and
as the views of the Editor accord with those of the Professor “*On* the
Reformation and the Wars of Religion” in France, we shall abridge and
condense his narrative, as the best suited to our purpose.

<span id="ii-p135"></span>THE GENERAL SYNOD  
OF PROTESTANTS AT PARIS.

<span id="ii-p136"></span>When Calvin addressed his followers in France,
as desirous of the firm establishment of Christ’s kingdom in the native
land, he was at His College in Geneva; but his labors and his Writings
were all-powerful in influence with the Reformed in France. Their
numbers were large throughout the cities and villages of the Empire.
Lefevre and Farel were as father and son in ceaseless efforts to make
known to these Gentiles “the, unsearchable riches of Christ.” Their
evangelical preaching was signally blessed. Briconnet, the Bishop of
Meaux, aided them in translating the Evangelists and in heralding the
word of God, and so rapidly and widely had their gospel been received,
that “a Heretic of Meaux” became the popular title for an opponent of
the Papacy. Notwithstanding the hideous spectacle and the odious
Massacre of the 29th of January 1535*,* when Francis I. celebrated the
Fete of Paris by the Martyrdom of the Saints of God, the Reformers were
so numerous throughout the realm, that a serious conflict was
approaching between themselves and their foes. On the 25th of May 1559,
a General Synod Of All Protestant Congregations was solemnly convened
and held at Paris — the ecclesiastical system of their Patriarch at
Geneva was adopted, and his “*Institution Chretienne*” became the source
and basis of their Confession of Faith. Paris was but the energizing
center of an organized Church throughout the Sixteen Provinces of the
Realm, while Synods, and Consistories, and Conferences formed a kind of
Spiritual Republic, spreading like network over the land. But the hand
and the eye of the Persecutor was upon them. Rome had its despotic
tyrants both in Court and Camp. In the very midst of the Parliament at
Paris, a confessor of the true fifth appeared — but his courage was
extinguished by his condemnation. Dubourg, a magistrate of eminent
learning and illustrious family, in the presence of the King, in his
place in Parliament, invoked a National Council for the Reform of
Religion, and denounced the persecution of Heritics as a crime against
Him whose holy name they were accustomed to adore with their dying
breath. He expected His audacity by his death, and before the grave had
been opened for him it had closed upon the Royal Tyrant, Henery II., who
bequeathed his crown to a second France in his sixteenth year. And who
knows not the crafty, treacherous, and intriguing wickedness of the
Queen-mother, Catherine or Medici? Who knows not the ambitious
worldliness of the two sons of Claude or Lorraine — Francis, the Duke of
Guise — the savage butcher of the Huguenots of Champagne, and Charles,
the Cardinal Lorraine, the subtle agent of Rome’s most hateful policy?
These artful brothers worked their way to supreme influence in the
national councils. Having married their niece, Mary Queen or Scots, to
the youthful Sovereign, they employed their vast influence for the
wholesale martyrdom of the defenseless flock of Christ. In every
Parliament of the kingdom they established Chambers for trying and
burning all persons charged with herisy, which obtained the unenviable
notoriety of” *chambres ardentes.*” “But deep,” says the eloquent
Lecturer, “called unto deep.” The alarmed and exasperated Huguenots,
confident in their strength and deriving courage from despair, rose in
many parts of France to repel, or at least to punish their antagonists.
In the midst of the anarchy of the times, a voice was raised in calm and
earnest remonstrance, urging toleration and peace. In August 1560,
the*,* renowned Chancellor L’hopital appeared before the King and an
assembly of notables at Fontainebleau. He presents a Petition from the
whole Reformed Church of the realm, and requests the royal permission
for the free performance of public worship. “Your Petition,” says the
King, “is without a signature!” “True*,* sire,” replies Coligny “but if
you will allow us to meet for the purpose, I will obtain 50,000
signatures in one day in Normandy alone!” His zeal might occasion a
slight; exaggeration — but the phrase presents us with data for
conjecturing the number of “the pious” whom our Reformer addressed about
a year afterwards. As soon as opportunity was given for listening to the
glad tidings of salvation, large accessions were made to the hosts of
the believers. Farel, though advanced in years, preached the truth to
large and ethusiastic assemblages. In the neighborhood of Paris, the
followers of Beza were numerous, and his admirers reckoned them at
40,000. L’hopital presented to the Queen-mother a list of 2150 Ireformed
Congregations, each under the ministry of a separate pastor, and he
reckoned the number of the Huguenots as one-third of that of the
Romanists!

<span id="ii-p137"></span>EDICT OF POISSY.

<span id="ii-p138"></span>At the very moment when Calvin was penning in
his study the Letter which is prefixed to these Lectures Of Daniel, the
Edict of July 1561 was issued. It bears the impress of the restored
influence of the House of Lorraine*,* which ever proved an implacable
foe to the Gospel of Christ as preached by The Calvinists. That Edict
forbid their public assemblies, and yet tolerated their private and
social worship. It protected them from injury on account of their
opinions, and provided for a National Council which should, if possible,
settle differences which were in their nature irreconcilable. This
important enactment was issued in the Assembly at Poissy, held a few
weeks after the date of the Letter which follows this Preface, and which
has been alluded to in the Preface to Ezekiel. Cams was absent, because
the French Court refused to give those securities for his safety which
the, Republic of Geneva required. But he was ably represented by Beza,
and a dozen ministers, and twenty-two lay deputies of the Churches. The
dramatic taste of the French mind was gratified by the scene, for the
tournaments of belted knights had now given way to those of theological
disputant,. In the Refectory of the great Convent the boy King was
seated on a temporary throne. The members of his family, the officers
and ladies of his Court, were stationed on one side, six Cardinals, with
an array of mitred Bishops, were assembled on the other. The rustic garb
of Beza and his associates, as they were introduced to their Sovereign
by the Chancellor, contrasted strongly with the gorgeous apparel and the
showy splendor of the Court and its attendants. The political Cardinal
or Lorraine and the subtle General of the Jesuits, Iago Lasquez,
conducted the dispute against Beza. The Doctors of the Sorbonne watched
the sport with official keenness, while Catherine listened to the debate
with secret contempt, having long ago determined to root out every
Heretic as soon as she could throw the mantle of policy over her
cruelty.

<span id="ii-p139"></span>PARALLEL BETWEEN THE PROTESTANTS IN FRANCE
ANDTHE JEWS IN BABYLON.

<span id="ii-p140"></span>The matured Christian is now enabled to see at
a glance, that such Conferences are, of necessity, worthless as to any
progress of vital religion in the soul. The narrative, however, may
enable the reader to enter a little into the state of the Christian, in
France when Calvin’s indicted his Prefatory Letter, and may justify the
comparison which he makes between their lot, under the tyranny of such
merciless rulers, and that of Daniel under the sway of the imperious
Nebuchadnezzar*,* and at the tender mercy of his colleagues under
Darius. The parallel is as complete as it could possibly be between the
temporal position of the pious in France, and that of the devout Jews in
Babylon — and the graphic description of the Royal Professor of Modern
History fully justifies the pastoral anxiety of the austere Theologian
of Geneva.

<span id="ii-p141"></span>ARRANGEMENT OF THE PRESENT WORK.

<span id="ii-p142"></span>The Contents of these Volumes are as follow —

<span id="ii-p143"></span>The first Volume contains a translation of
Calvin’s elaborate Address to All the Faithful in France; and also of

the Volume, containing various historical, critical, and exegetical
remarks, illustrating the Sacred Text as expounded by our Reformer. The
chief of them are as follow, viz.

<span id="ii-p144"></span>**CHAPTER 1** The Date of Jehoiakim’s Reign.  
Nebuchadnezzar — one King or two?

Translation of the remaining Chapters, which are the peculiarly
Prophetic portion of the Book; and the interest which every sound
Exposition of these Prophecies has always excited throughout the
Theological world, will render the following Addenda acceptable to the

<span id="ii-p158"></span>**7.** A copious Index Of The Chief Words And
Subjects treated in these Volumes.

<span id="ii-p159"></span>Before concluding these Prefatory
Observations, The Editor would briefly refer to the fundamental rules of
The Calvin Translation Society, which very wisely exclude all
expressions of private opinion. He hopes that no remarks in this Preface
will be deemed inconsistent with so judicious a regulation. The clear
illustration and the comprehensive defense of our Venerable Reformer
seem to demand the candid statement of some views which are adverse to
the popular current; but this necessity need not induce him to step
beyond the limits of his province. It has been his desire
conscientiously to vindicate his Author’s Interpretations wherever he is
able to do so, and as fearlessly to point out wherever Calvin is allowed
to be in error; but in both cases, the Editor has scrupulously avoided
taking any one-sided view of a great argument. He has attempted to
exercise the utmost impartiality in quoting from a great variety of
Standard Works which contain the most opposite conclusions; and yet, in
accordance with the first principles of these Translations, he has at
the same time carefully abstained from pressing any sentiments of his
own on rite attention of the intelligent reader.
