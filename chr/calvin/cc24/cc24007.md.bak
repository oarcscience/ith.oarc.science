<span id="viii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="viii-p2"></span>In this second chapter we are informed how God
brought Daniel into a theater, to exhibit that prophetic office to which
he had been destined. God had already engraven, as we have said,
distinct marks by which Daniel might be acknowledged as a Prophet, but
he wished really to prove the effect of the grace which he had conferred
upon Daniel. First of all, a simple history is narrated, then Daniel
proceeds to the interpretation of a dream. This is the heading of the
chapter.

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1.** And in the second year of the reign
of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit
was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Anno autem secundo regni
Nebuchadnezzar somniavit Nebuchadnezzar somnia et contritus fuit
spiritusejus, et somnus: ejus interruptus est ei.  <span
id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md)

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span><span id="viii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span>Daniel here says, — King Nebuchadnezzar
dreamt in the second year of his reign. This seems contrary to the
opinion expressed in the first chapter. For if Nebuchadnezzar besieged
Jerusalem in the first year of his reign, how could Daniel be already
reckoned among the wise men and astrologers, while he was as yet but a
disciple? Thus it is easily gathered from the context that he and his
companions were already brought forward to minister before the king. At
the first glance these things are not in accordance, because in the
first year of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign Daniel and his companions were
delivered into training; and in the second he was in danger of death
through being in the number of the Magi. Some, as we have mentioned
elsewhere, count the second year from the capture and destruction of the
city, for they say Nebuchadnezzar was called king from the time at which
he obtained the monarchy in peace. Before he had cut off the City and
Temple with the Nation, his Monarchy could not be treated as united;
hence they refer this to the capture of the city, as I have said. But I
rather incline to another conjecture as more probable — that of his
reigning with his father, and I have shewn that when he besieged
Jerusalem in the time of Jehoiachim, he was sent by his father; he next
returned to Chaldea from the Egyptian expedition, through his wish to
repress revolts, if any one should dare to rebel. In this, therefore,
there is nothing out of place. Nebuchadnezzar reigned before the death
of his father, because he had already been united with him in the
supreme power; then he reigned alone, and the present narrative happened
in the second year of his reign. In this explanation there is nothing
forced, and as the history agrees with it, I adopt it as the best.

<span id="viii.i-p8"></span>He says — he *dreamt dreams,* and yet only
one Dream is narrated; but since many things were involved in this
dream, the use of the plural number is not surprising. It is now added,
*his, spirit was contrite,* to shew us how uncommon the dream really
was. For Nebuchadnezzar did not then begin to dream, and was not
formerly so frightened every night as to send for all the Magi. Hence,
in this dream there was something extraordinary, which Daniel wished to
express in these words. The clause at the end of the verse which they
usually translate *his sleep was interrupted,* does not seem to have
this sense; another explanation which our brother D. Antonius gave you
 <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) suits it better; namely, — his
sleep was upon him, meaning he began to sleep again. The genuine and
simple sense of the words seems to me — *his spirit was confused,* that
is, very great terror had seized on his mind. He knew, indeed, the dream
to be sent from heaven; next, being astonished, he slept again, and
became like a dead man, and when he considered the interpretation of the
dream, he became stupified and returned to sleep and forgot the vision,
as we shall afterwards see. It follows —

<span id="viii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#002.md)<span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>**2.** Then the king commanded to call the
magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans,
for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.

<span id="viii.ii-p3"></span>**2.** Etedixit rex ut vocarentur  <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md) astrologi, et conjectores, et divini,
et Chaldei, annuntiarent regi somnia sua  <span
id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) et venerunt et steterunt in conspectu
regis.

<span id="viii.ii-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.ii-p7"></span><span id="viii.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p8"></span>This verse more *clearly* proves what I
have already said that the dream caused the king to feel God to be its
author. Though this was not his first dream, yet the terror which God
impressed on his mind, compelled him to summon all the Magi, since he
could not rest even by returning to sleep. He felt as. it were a sing in
his mind, since God did not suffer him to rest, but wished him to be
troubled until he received an interpretation of the dream. Even profane
writers very correctly consider dreams connected with divine agency.
They express various opinions, because they could not know anything with
perfect certainty; yet the persuasion was fixed in their minds relative
to some divine agency in dreams. It would be foolish and puerile to
extend this to all dreams; as we see some persons never passing by a
single one without a conjecture, and thus making themselves ridiculous.
We know dreams to arise from different causes; as, for instance, from
our daily thoughts. If I have meditated on anything during the daytime,
something occurs to me at night in a dream; because the mind is not
completely buried in slumber, but retains some seed of intelligence,
although it be suffocated. Experience also sufficiently teaches us how
our daily thoughts recur during sleep, and hence the various affections
of the mind and body produce, many dreams. If any one retires to bed in
sorrow from either the death of a friend, or any loss, or through
suffering any injury or adversity, his dreams will partake of the
previous preparation of his mind. The body itself causes dreams, as we
see in the case of those who suffer from fever; when thirst prevails
they imagine fountains, burnings, and similar fancies. We perceive also
how intemperance disturbs men in their sleep; for drunken men start and
dream in their sleep, as if in a state of frenzy. As there are many
natural causes for dreams, it would be quite out of character to be
seeking for divine agency or fixed reason in them all; and on the other
hand, it is sufficiently evident that some dreams are under divine
regulation. I omit events which have been related in ancient histories;
but surely the dream of Calphurnia, the wife of Julius Caesar, could not
be fictitious; because, before he was slain it was commonly reported,
“Caesar has been killed,” just as she dreamt it. The same may be said of
the physician of Augustus, who had ordered him to leave his tent the day
of the battle of Pharsalia, and yet there was no reason why the
physician should order him to be carried out of the tent on a litter,
unless he had dreamt it to be necessary. What was the nature of that
necessity? why, such as could not be conjectured by human skill, for the
camp of Augustus was taken at that very moment. I doubt not there are
many fabulous accounts, but here I may choose what I shall believe, and
I do not yet touch on dreams which are mentioned in God’s word, for I am
merely speaking of what profane men were compelled to think on this
subject. Although Aristotle freely rejected all sense of divination,
through being prejudiced in the matter, and desiring to reduce the
nature of Deity within the scope of human ingenuity, and to comprehend
all things by his acuteness; yet he expresses this confession, that all
dreams do not happen rashly but that <span
id="viii.ii-p8.1"></span>μαντίκη*,* that is “divination,” is the source
of some of them. He disputes, indeed, whether they belong to the
intellectual or sensitive portion of the mind, and concludes they belong
to the latter, as far as it is imaginative. Afterwards, when inquiring
whether they are causes or anything of that kind, he is disposed to view
them only as symptoms or accidents fortuitously contingent. Meanwhile,
he will not admit dreams to be sent from heaven; and adds as his reason,
that many stupid men dream, and manifest the same reason in them as the
wisest. He notices next the brute creation, some of which, as elephants,
dream. As the brutes dream, and wise men more seldom than the rudest
idiots, Aristotle does not think it probable that dreams are divinely
inspired. He denies, therefore, that they are sent from God, or divine,
but asserts that they spring from the *Daimones;*  <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) that is, he fancies them to be
something between the natures of the Deity and the Daimones. We know the
sense in which philosophers use that word, which, in Scripture, has
usually a bad sense. He says that dreams were occasioned by those aerial
inspirations, but are not from God.; because, he says, man’s nature is
not divine, but inferior; and yet more than earthly, since it, is
angelic. Cicero discourses on this subject at great, length, in his
first book on Divination; although he refutes in the second all he had
said, while he was a disciple of the Academy.  <span
id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) For among other arguments in proof of
the existence of deities, he adds dreams; — if there is any divination
in dreams, it follows that there is a. Deity in heaven, for the mind of
man cannot conceive of any dream without divine inspiration. Cicero’s
reasoning is valid; if there is divination in dreams, then is there also
a Deity. The distinction made by Macrobius is worthy of notice; although
he ignorantly confounds species and genera, through being a person of
imperfect judgment, who strung together in rhapsodies whatever he read,
without either discrimination or arrangement. This, then, should remain
fixed, — the opinion concerning the existence of some kind of divine
agency in dreams was not rashly implanted in the hearts of all men.
Hence that expression of Homer’s, a dream is from Jupiter.  <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) He does not mean this generally and
promiscuously of all dreams; but he takes notice of it, when bringing
the characters of his heroes before us, since they were divinely
admonished in their sleep.

<span id="viii.ii-p12"></span>I now come to Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream. In
this, two points are worthy of remark. First, all remembrance of its
subject was entirely obliterated; and secondly, no interpretation was;
found for it. Sometimes the remembrance of a dream was not; lost while
its interpretation was unknown. But here Nebuchadnezzar was not only
perplexed at the interpretation of the dream, but even the vision itself
had vanished, and thus his perplexity and anxiety was doubled. As to the
next point, there is no novelty in Daniel making known the
interpretation; for it sometimes, but rarely, happens that a person
dreams without a figure or enigma, and with great plainness, without any
need of conjurers — a name given to interpreters of dreams. This indeed
happens but seldom, since the usual plan of dreams is for God to speak
by them allegorically and obscurely. And this occurs in the case of the
profane as well as of the servants of God. When Joseph dreamt that he
was adored by the sun and moon, (<span id="viii.ii-p12.1"></span>[Ge
37:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#009)<span id="viii.ii-p12.1"></span>,.md)
he was ignorant of its meaning; when he dreamt of his sheaf being adored
by his brothers sheaves, he understood not its meaning, but related it
simply to his brothers. Hence God often speaks in enigmas by dreams,
until the interpretation is added. And such was Nebuchadnezzar’s dream.

<span id="viii.ii-p13"></span>*We* perceive, then, that God reveals his
will even to unbelievers, but not clearly; *because* seeing they do not
see, just as if they were gazing at a closed book or sealed letter; as
Isaiah says, — God speaks to unbelievers in broken accents and with a
stammering tongue. (<span id="viii.ii-p13.1"></span>[Isa
28:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#011.md)<span id="viii.ii-p13.1"></span>
and <span id="viii.ii-p13.2"></span>[Isa
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#011.md)<span
id="viii.ii-p13.2"></span>.) God’s will was so revealed to
Nebuchadnezzar that he still remained perplexed and lay completely
astonished. His dream would have been of no use to him, unless, as we
shall see, Daniel had been presented to him as its interpreter. For God
not only wished to hold the king in suspense, but he thus blotted out
the remembrance of the dream from his mind, to increase the power of his
sting. As mankind are accustomed to neglect the dreams which they do not
remember, God inwardly fastened such a sting in the mind of this
unbeliever, as I have already said, that he could not rest, but was
always wakeful in the midst of his dreaming, because God was drawing him
to himself by secret chains. This is the true reason why God denied him
the immediate explanation of his dream, and blotted out the remembrance
of it from his mind, until he should receive both from Daniel. We will
leave the rest till tomorrow.

<span id="viii.iii"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="viii.iii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since every perfect
gift comes from thee, and since some excel others in intelligence and
talents, yet as no one has anything of his own, but as thou deignest to
distribute to man a measure of thy gracious liberality, — Grant that
whatever intelligence thou dost confer upon us, we may apply it to the
glory of thy name. Grant also, that we may acknowledge in humility and
modesty what thou hast committed to our care to be thine own; and may we
study to be restrained by sobriety, to desire nothing superfluous, never
to corrupt true and genuine knowledge, and to remain in that simplicity
to which thou callest us. Finally, may we not rest in these earthly
things, but learn rather to raise our minds to true wisdom, to
acknowledge thee to be the true God, and to devote ourselves to the
obedience of thy righteousness; and may it be our sole object to devote
and consecrate ourselves entirely to the glory of thy name throughout
our lives, through Jesus Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="viii.iv"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p1"></span>Lecture Fifth.

<span id="viii.iv-p2"></span>We yesterday saw the Magi sent for by the
king’s edict, not only in order to explain his dream to him, but also to
narrate the dream itself which had slipt from his memory. But since four
kinds of Magi are used here, or at least three, and their description is
added in the fourth place, I shall briefly touch upon what seems to me
their meaning. <span id="viii.iv-p2.1"></span>הרטמים *Hartummim,* is
usually explained by “soothsayers,” and afterwards <span
id="viii.iv-p2.2"></span>אשפים, *Assaphim,* they think, means
“*physicians.*” I am unwilling to contend against the first
interpretation; but I see no reason for the second. They interpret it as
“*physicians,*” because they judge of men’s health by feeling the pulse,
but having no better reason than this, I adopt the opinion that it
refers to astrologers. In the third place, <span
id="viii.iv-p2.3"></span>מכשפים, *Mecasphim,* is used, meaning
“*sorcerers,*” though some change the signification, and say it; means
“*star-gazers,*” who indicate future events and *predict* unknown ones
from the position of the stars. I have nothing to bring forward more
probable than this, *except* the uncertainty of what the Hebrews meant
by the word for *since* the matter itself is so buried in oblivion, who
can distinguish between words which belong to the profession of an
unknown art? <span id="viii.iv-p2.4"></span>כשדים, *Casdim,* is
doubtless put for a race, for it is the name of a nation, yet on account
of its excellence, the Magi appropriated it to themselves, as. if the
nobility and *excellence* of the whole nation was in their power; and
this name is known to be in common use in Greece and Italy. All who
professed their ability to predict future or hidden events from the
stars or other conjectures, were called *Chaldees.* With respect to the
three other words, I do not doubt their honorable meaning, and for this
red, son they called themselves Mathematicians, as if there were no
*science* in the world except with them. Besides, although their
principles were good, they were certainly stuffed with many
superstitions, for they were soothsayers and diviners, and we know them
to have given especial attention to augury. Although they were highly
esteemed by their fellow-countymen, yet they are condemned by God’s law,
for all their pretense to science was complete imposture. They are
generally called Magi, and also Chaldeans, as shortly afterwards, when
Daniel will repeat what they have spoken before the king, he will not
enumerate those three species, but will simply call them Chaldees. It is
surprising that Daniel and his companions were not called among them,
for he ought to have been called among the first, since the king, as we
have, said, found these four to be ten times better than all the Magi
and Diviners throughout his kingdom! Since their dexterity was not
unknown to the king, why does he pass them completely by, while the
other Magi are at hand and are called in to a case so arduous? Very
probably the king omitted them because he trusted more in the natives;
or suspected the captives, and was unwilling to entrust them with his
secrets, as he had not yet sufficiently tried their fidelity and
constancy. This might have been the reason, but it is better for us to
consider the intention of the Almighty, for I have no doubt that this
forgetfulness on the part of the king occurred by God’s providence, as
he was unwilling from the first to mingle his servant Daniel and the
rest with the Magi and Soothsayers. This accounts for Daniel not being
sent for with the rest; whence, as we shall see, his divination would
afterwards *become more* illustrious. It now follows —

<span id="viii.v"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p1"></span><span id="viii.v-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#003.md)<span id="viii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p2"></span>**3.** And the king said unto them, I have
dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.

<span id="viii.v-p3"></span>**3.** Et dixit illis rex, Somnium somniavi,
et contritus est spiritus meus, ad sciendum  <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) somnium.

<span id="viii.v-p5"></span>**4.** Then spake the Chaldeans to the king
in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we
will shew the interpretation.

<span id="viii.v-p6"></span>**4.** Et dixerunt Chaldaei regi Syriace,
Rex in eternum vive: dic somnium servis tuis, et expositionem
indicabimus.

<span id="viii.v-p7"></span> 

<span id="viii.v-p8"></span><span id="viii.v-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p9"></span>Daniel relates first the great confidence of
the Chaldeans, since they dared to promise the interpretation of a dream
as yet unknown to them. *The king says he was troubled through desire to
understand the dream;* by which he signifies that a kind of riddle was
divinely set, before him. He confesses his ignorance, while the
importance of the object may be gathered from his words. Since, then,
the king testifies his desire to inquire concerning a matter obscure and
profound, and exceeding his comprehension, and since he clearly
expresses himself to be contrite in spirit, some kind of fear and
anxiety ought to have touched these Chaldeans; yet they securely promise
to offer the very best interpretation of the dream as soon as they
understood it. When they say, *O king live for ever,* it is not a simple
and unmeaning prayer, but they rather order the king to be cheerful and
in good spirits, as they are able to remove all care and anxiety from
his mind, because the explanation of the dream was at hand. We know how
liberal in words those impostors always were; according to the language
of an ancient poet, they enriched the ears and emptied the purses of
others. And truly those who curiously court the breeze with their ears
deserve to feed upon it, and to be taken in by such deceits. And all
ages have proved that nothing exceeds the confidence of astrologers, who
are not content with true science, but divine every one’s life and
death, and conjecture all events, and profess to know everything.

<span id="viii.v-p10"></span>We must hold generally that the art of
conjecturing from dreams is rash and foolish; there is, indeed, a
certain fixed interpretation of dreams, as we said yesterday, yet as we
shall afterwards see, this ought not to be ascribed to a sure science,
but to God’s singular gift. As, therefore, a prophet will not gather
what he has to say from fixed reasonings, but will explain God’s
oracles, so also he who will interpret dreams correctly, will not follow
certain disthief rules; but if God has explained the meaning of the
dream, he will then undertake the office of interpreting it according to
his endowment with this gift. Properly speaking, these two flyings are
opposite to each other and do not mutually agree, general and perpetual
science, and special revelation. Since God claims this power of opening
by means of a dream, what he has engraven on the minds of men, hence art
and science cannot obtain it, but a revelation from the spirit must be
waited for. When the Chaldeans thus boldly promise to become good
interpreters of the dream, they not only betray their rashness, but
become mere impostors, who pretend to be proficients in a science of
which they know nothing, as if they could predict by their conjectures
the meaning of the king’s dream. It now follows —

<span id="viii.vi"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#005.md)<span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p2"></span>**5.** The king answered and said to the
Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if ye will not make known unto me
the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces,
and your houses shall be made a dunghill.

<span id="viii.vi-p3"></span>**5.** Respondit rex et dixit Chaldaeis,
Sermo a me exiit,  <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) si non
indicaveritis mihi somnium et interpretationem ejus, frusla efficiemini,
 <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) et domus vestrae ponentur
sterquilinium.  <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)

<span id="viii.vi-p7"></span> 

<span id="viii.vi-p8"></span><span id="viii.vi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p9"></span>Here the king requires from the Chaldeans
more than they professed to afford him; for although their boasting, as
we have said, was foolish in promising to interpret any dream, yet they
never claimed the power of narrating to any one his dreams. The king,
therefore, seems to me to act unjustly in not regarding what they had
hitherto professed, and the limits of their art and science, if indeed
they had any science! When he says — the matter or speech had departed
from him, the words admit of a twofold sense, for <span
id="viii.vi-p9.1"></span>מלתה*, millethah,* may be taken for all
“*edict,*” as we shall afterwards see; and so it might be read, *has
flowed away;* but since the same form of expression will be shortly
repeated when it seems to be, used of the dream, (<span
id="viii.vi-p9.2"></span>[Da 2:8](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#008.md)<span
id="viii.vi-p9.2"></span>,) this explanation is suitable enough, as the
king says his dream had vanished so I leave the point undecided. It is
worthwhile noticing again what we said yesterday, that terror was so
fastened upon the king as to deprive him of rest, and yet he was not so
instructed that the least taste of the revelation remained; just as if
an ox, stunned by a severe blow, should toss himself about, and roll
over and over. Such is the madness of this wretched king, because God
harasses him with dreadful torments; all the while the remembrance of
the dream is altogether obliterated from his mind. Hence he *confesses*
— *his dream had escaped him;* and although the Magi had prescribed the
limits of their science, yet through their boasting themselves to be
interpreters of the gods, he did not hesitate to exact of them what they
had never professed. This is the just reward of arrogance, when men
puffed up with a perverse confidence assume before others more than they
ought, and forgetful of all modesty wish to be esteemed angelic spirits.
Without the slightest doubt God wished to make a laughingstock of this
foolish boasting which was conspicuous among the Chaldees, when the king
sharply demanded of them to relate his dream, as well as to offer an
exposition of it.

<span id="viii.vi-p10"></span>He afterwards adds threats, clearly
tyrannical; *unless they expound the dream their life is in danger* No
common punishment is threatened, but he says they should become
“*pieces*” — *if we* take the meaning of the word to signify pieces. If
we think it means “blood*,*” the sense will be the same. This wrath of
the king is clearly furious, nay, Nebuchadnezzar in this respect
surpassed all the cruelty of wild beasts. What fault could be imputed to
the Chaldeans if they did not know the king’s dream? — surely, they had
never professed this, as we shall afterwards see; and no, king had ever
demanded what was beyond the faculty of man. We perceive how the long
manifested a brutal rage when he denounced death and every cruel torture
on the Magi and sorcerers. Tyrants, indeed, often give the reins to
their lust, and think all things lawful to themselves; whence, also,
these words of the tragedian, Whatever he wishes is lawful. And
Sophocles says, with evident truth, that any one entering a tyrant’s
threshold must cast away his liberty; but if we were to collect all
examples, we should *scarcely* find one like this. It follows, then,
that the king’s mind was impelled by diabolic fury, urging him to punish
the Chaldees who, with respect to him, were innocent enough. We know
them to have been impostors, and the world to have been deluded by their
impositions, which rendered them deserving of death, since by the
precepts of the law it was a capital crime for any one to pretend to the
power of prophecy by magic arts. (<span id="viii.vi-p10.1"></span>[Le
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/lev020.htm#006)<span id="viii.vi-p10.1"></span>..md)
But, as far as concerned the king, they could not be charged with any
crime. Why, then, did he threaten them with death? because the Lord
wished to shew the miracle which we shall afterwards see. For if the
king had suffered the Chaldeans to depart, he could have buried directly
that anxiety which tortured and excruciated his mind. The subject, too,
had been less noticed by the people; hence God tortured the king’s mind,
till he rushed headlong in his fury, as we have said. Thus, this
atrocious and cruel denunciation ought to have aroused all men; for
there is no doubt that the greatest and the least trembled together when
they heard of such vehemence in the monarch’s wrath. This, therefore, is
the complete sense, and we must mark the object of God’s providence in
thus allowing the king’s anger to burn without restraint.  <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) It follows —

<span id="viii.vii"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p1"></span><span id="viii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p2"></span>**6.** But if ye shew the dream, and the
interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and
great honour, therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation
thereof.

<span id="viii.vii-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.vii-p6"></span><span id="viii.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p7"></span>Here the king, on the other hand, desires
to entice them by the hope of gain, to apply themselves to narrate his
dream. He had already attempted to strike them with horror, that even if
they are unwilling he may wrest the narration of the dream from them, as
well as its interpretation. Meanwhile, if they could be induced by
flattery, he tries this argument upon them; for he promises *a gift, and
reward, and honor,* that is, he promises a large remuneration if they
narrated his dream, and were faithful interpreters. Hence we gather,
what all history declares, that the Magi made a gain of their
predictions and guesses. The wise men of the Indies, being frugal and
austere in their manner of living, were not wholly devoted to gain; for
they are known to have lived without any need of either money, or
furniture, or anything else. They were content with roots, and had no
need of clothing, slept upon the ground, and were thus free from
avarice. But the Chaldeans, we know, ran hither and thither to obtain
money from the simple and credulous. Hence the king here speaks
according to custom when he promises a large reward. We must remark
here, how the Chaldeans scattered their prophecies for the sake of gain;
and when knowledge is rendered saleable, it is sure to be adulterated
with many faults. As when Paul speaks of corruptors of the Gospel, he
says, — they trafficked in it, (<span id="viii.vii-p7.1"></span>[2Co
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#007)<span id="viii.vii-p7.1"></span>,.md)
because when a profit is made, as we have previously said, even
honorable teachers must necessarily degenerate and pervert all sincerity
by their lying. For where avarice reigns, there is flattery, servile
obsequiousness, and cunning of all kinds, while truth is utterly
extinguished. Whence it is not surprising if the Chaldeans were so
inclined to deceit, as it became natural to them through the pursuit of
gain and the lust for wealth. Some honest teachers may receive support
from the public treasury; but, as we have said, when any one is drawn
aside by lucre, he must necessarily pervert and deprave all purity of
doctrine. And from this passage we gather, further, the anxiety of the
king, as he had no wish to spare expense, if by this means he could
click the interpretation of his dream from the Chaldeans; all the while
he is furiously angry with them, because he does not obtain what the
offered reward ought to procure. It now follows —

<span id="viii.viii"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p1"></span><span id="viii.viii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p2"></span>**7.** They answered again and said, Let
the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the
interpretation of it.

<span id="viii.viii-p3"></span>**7.** Responderunt secundo, et dixerunt,
Rex sonmium exponat  <span id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) servis
suis, et interpretationem indicabimus.

<span id="viii.viii-p5"></span>**8.** The king answered and said, I know
of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is
gone from me.

<span id="viii.viii-p6"></span>**8.** Respondit rex et dixit, Vere
 <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) novi ego  <span

quod exierit sermo a me.  <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md)

<span id="viii.viii-p10"></span>**9.** But if ye will not make known
unto me the dream, *there is but* one decree for you: for ye have
prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be
changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew
me the interpretation thereof.

<span id="viii.viii-p11"></span>**9.** Propterea si somnium non

cognoscam quod interpretationem ejus mihi indicetis.  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md)

<span id="viii.viii-p15"></span> 

<span id="viii.viii-p16"></span><span id="viii.viii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p17"></span>Here the excuse of the Magi is narrated.
They state the truth that their art only enabled them to discover the
interpretation of a dream; but the king wished to know the dream itself.
Whence he appears again to have been seized with prodigious fury and
became quite implacable. Kings sometimes grow warm, but are appeased by
a single admonition, and hence this sentiment is very true, — anger is
assuaged by mild language. But since the fair reply of the Magi did not
mitigate the king’s wrath, he was quite hurried away by diabolical
vehemence. And all this, as I have said, was governed by God’s secret
counsel, that Daniel’s explanation might be more noticed. They next ask
the king — to *relate his dream,* and then they promise as before to
interpret it directly. And even this was too great a boast, as we have
said, and they ought to have corrected their own conceit and foolish
boasting when in such a difficulty. But since they persist in that
foolish and fallacious self-conceit, it shews us how they were blinded
by the devil, just as those who have become entangled by superstitious
deceptions confidently defend their own madness. Such an example we have
in the Magi, who always claimed the power of interpreting dreams.

<span id="viii.viii-p18"></span><span id="viii.viii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p19"></span>The king’s exception now follows: — *I
know,* says he, *that ye would gain time, since you are aware that the
matter has gone from me,* or the word has been pronounced, if we adopt
the former sense. The king here accuses them of more disgraceful
cunning, since the Magi have nothing to offer, and so desire to escape
as soon as they know that the king has lost all remembrance of his
dream. It is just as if he had said — You promised me to be sure
interpreters of my dream, but this is false; for if I could narrate the
dream, it would be easy to prove your arrogance, since ye cannot explain
that enigma; but as lye know I have forgotten my dream, for that reason
ye ask me to relate it; but *this is only to gain time,* says he; thus
ye manage to conceal your ignorance and retain your credit for
knowledge. But if my dream still remained in my memory I should soon
detect your ignorance, for we cannot perform your boasting. We see,
therefore, how the king here loads the Magi with a new crime, because
they were impostors who deluded the people with false boastings; and
hence he shews them worthy of death, unless they relate his dream. The
argument indeed is utterly vicious; but it is not surprising when
tyrants appear in the true colors of their cruelty. Meanwhile we must
remember what I have said. — the Magi deserved this reproof, for they
were puffed up with vanity and made false promises, through conjecturing
the future from dreams, auguries, and the like. But in the king’s case,
nothing was more unjust. than to invent such a crime against the Magi,
since if they deceived others it arose from being self-deceived. They
were blinded and fascinated by the foolish persuasion of their own
wisdom, and had no intention of deceiving the king; for they thought
something might immediately occur which would free his mind from all
anxiety. But the king always pursued the blindest impulse of his rage.
Meanwhile we must notice the origin of this feeling, — he was divinely
tormented, and could not rest a single moment till he obtained an
explanation of his dream. He next adds, *If ye do not explain my dream,
this sentence alone remains for you,* says he; that is, it is already
decreed concerning you all, I shall not inquire particularly which of
you is in fault and which wishes to deceive me; but I will utterly cut
off all the tribe of the Magi, and no one shall escape punishment,
unless ye explain to me both the dream and its interpretation.

<span id="viii.viii-p20"></span><span id="viii.viii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p21"></span>He adds again, *Ye have prepared a
fallacious and corrupt speech to relate here before me,* as your excuse.
Again, the king charges them with fraud and malice, of which they were
not guilty; as if he had said, they purposely sought specious pretenses
for practicing deceit. But he says*, a lying speech,* or fallacious *and
corrupt;* that is, yours is a stale excuse, as we commonly say, and I
loathe it. If there were any colorable pretext I might admit what. ye
say, but I see in your words nothing but fallacies, and those too which
savor of corruption. Now, therefore, we observe the king not only angry
because the Magi cannot relate his dream, but charging it against them,
as a greater crime, that they brought a stale excuse and wished
purposely to deceive him. He next adds*, tell me the dream and then I
shall know it;* or then I shall know that ye can faithfully interpret,
its meaning. Here the king takes up another argument to convict the Magi
of cunning. Ye boast, indeed, that you have no difficulty in
interpreting the dream. How can ye be confident of this, for the dream
itself is still unknown to you? If I had told it you, ye might then say
whether ye could explain it or not; but when I now ask you about the
dream of which both you and I are ignorant, ye say, when have related
the dream, the rest is in your power; I therefore shall prove you to be
good and true interpreters of dreams if ye can tell me mine, since the
one thing depends on the other, and ye are too rash in presuming upon
what is not yet discovered. Since, therefore, ye burst forth so hastily,
and wish to persuade me that ye are sure of the interpretation, you are
evidently quite deceived in this respect; and your rashness and fraud
are herein detected, because ye are clearly deceiving me. This is the
substance — the rest to-morrow.

<span id="viii.ix-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.ix-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since during our
pilgrimage in this world we have daily need of the teaching and

word and secret inspiration, and not take too much on ourselves, —
Grant, also, that we may be conscious of our ignorance, blindness, and
stupidity, and always flee, to thee, and never permit ourselves to be
drawn aside in any way by the cunning of Satan and of the ungodly. May
we remain so fixed in thy truth as never to turn aside from it, whilst
thou dost direct us through the whole course of our vocation, and then
may we arrive at that heavenly glory which has been obtained for us
through the blood of thine only begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="viii.x-p1"></span>Lecture Sixth

<span id="viii.xi"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p1"></span><span id="viii.xi-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#010.md)<span id="viii.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p2"></span>**10.** The Chaldeans answered before the
king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the
king’s matter: therefore *there is* no king, lord, nor ruler, *that*
asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.

<span id="viii.xi-p3"></span>**10.** Responderunt Chaldaei coram rege,
et dixerunt, Non est homo super terram qui sermonem  <span

mago, et astrologo, et Chaldaeo.

<span id="viii.xi-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.xi-p6"></span><span id="viii.xi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p7"></span>The Chaldeans again excuse themselves for
not relating the king’s dream. They say, in reality, this is not their
peculiar art or science; and they know of no example handed down of wise
men being asked in this way, and required to answer as well *de facto*
as *de jure,* as the phrase is. They boasted themselves to be
interpreters of dreams, but their conjectures could not be extended to
discover the dreams themselves, but only their interpretation. This was
a just excuse, yet the king does not admit it, but is impelled by his
own wrath and by the divine instinct to shew the Magi, and sorcerers,
and astrologers, to be mere impostors and deceivers of the people. And
we must observe the end in view, because God wished to extol his servant
Daniel, and to separate him from the common herd. They add, that no
kings had ever dealt thus with Magi and wise men. It afterwards follows:
—

<span id="viii.xii"></span>

<span id="viii.xii-p1"></span><span id="viii.xii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#011.md)<span id="viii.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xii-p2"></span>**11.** And *it is* a rare thing that the
king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the
king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.

<span id="viii.xii-p3"></span>**11.** Et sermo de quo rex inquirit
pretiosus est;  <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) et nullus est
qui possit exponere coram rege, nisi dii, quorum habitatio cum carne non
est ipsis.  <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md)

<span id="viii.xii-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xii-p7"></span><span id="viii.xii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xii-p8"></span>They add, that the object of the king’s
inquiry surpassed the power of human ingenuity. There is no doubt that
they were slow to confess this, because, as we said before, they had
acquired the fame of such great wisdom, that the common people thought
nothing unknown to them or *concealed* from them. And most willingly
would they have escaped the dire necessity of confessing their ignorance
in this respect, but in their extremity they were compelled to resort to
this subterfuge. There may be a question why they thought the matter
about which the king inquired was precious; for as they were ignorant of
the king’s dream, how could they ascertain its value? But it is not
surprising that men, under the influence of extreme anxiety and fear,
should utter anything without judgment. *They* say, therefore, — *this
matter is precious;* thus they mingle flattery with their excuses to
mitigate the king’s anger, hoping to escape the unjust death which was
at hand. *The matter of which the king inquires is precious;* and yet it
would probably be said, since *the,* matter was uncommon, that the dream
was divinely sent to the king, and was afterwards suddenly buried in
oblivion. There certainly was some mystery here, and hence the Chaldeans
very reasonably considered the whole subject to surpass in magnitude the
common measure of human ability; therefore they add, — *there cannot be
any other interpreters than gods or angels* Some refer this to angels,
but we know the Magi to have worshipped a multitude of gods. Hence it is
more simple to explain this of the crowd of deities which they imagined.
They had, indeed, lesser gods; for among all nations a persuasion has
existed concerning a supreme God who reigns alone. Afterwards they
imagined inferior deities, and each fabricated a god for himself
according to his taste; hence they are called “gods,” according to
common opinion and usage, although they ought rather to be denoted genie
or demons of the air. For we know that all unbelievers were imbued with
this opinion concerning the existence of intermediate deities. The
Apostles contended strongly against this ancient error, and we know the
books of Plato  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) to be full of
the doctrine that demons or genii act as mediators between man and the
Heavenly Deity.

<span id="viii.xii-p10"></span>We may, then, suitably understand these
words that the Chaldeans thought angels the only interpreters; not
because they imagined angels as the Scriptures speak of them clearly and
sincerely, but the Platonic doctrine flourished among them, and also the
superstition about the genii who dwell in heaven, and hold familiar
intercourse with the supreme God. Since men are clothed in flesh, they
cannot so raise themselves towards heaven as to perceive all secrets.
Whence it follows, that the king acted unjustly in requiring them to
discharge a duty either angelic or divine. This excuse was indeed
probable, but the king’s ears were deaf because he was carried away by
his passions, and God also spurred him on by furies, which allowed him
no rest. Hence this savage conduct which Daniel records.

<span id="viii.xiii"></span>

<span id="viii.xiii-p1"></span><span id="viii.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#012.md)<span id="viii.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiii-p2"></span>**12.** For this cause the king was angry
and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise *men* of
Babylon.

<span id="viii.xiii-p3"></span>12. Propterea rex in ira et indignatione
magna edixit ut interficerent omnes sapientes Babylonis.

<span id="viii.xiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xiii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiii-p6"></span>The former denunciation was horrible, but
now Nebuchadnezzar proceeds beyond it; for he not merely threatens the
Chaldeans with death, but commands it to be inflicted. Such an example
is scarcely to be found in history; but the cause of his wrath must be
noticed, since God wished his servant Daniel to be brought forward and
to be observed by all men. This was the preparation by which it became
generally evident that the wise men of Babylon were proved vain, through
promising more than they could perform; even if they had been endowed
with the greatest wisdom, they would still have been destitute of that
gift of revelation which was conferred upon Daniel. Hence it happened
that the king denounced death against them all by his edict; for he
might then perhaps acknowledge what he had never perceived before,
namely, that their boasting was nothing but vanity, and their arts full
of superstitions. For when superstition fails of success, madness
immediately succeeds, and when those who are thought and spoken of as
remarkably devout, perceive their fictitious worship to be of no avail,
then they burst forth into the madness which I have mentioned, and curse
their idols, and detest what they had hitherto followed. So it occurred
here, when Nebuchadnezzar suspected imposture in so serious a matter,
and no previous suspicion of it had entered his mind; but now, when he
sees through the deception, in so perplexing a case, and hi such great
anxiety, when left destitute of the advice of those from whom he hoped
all things, then he is a hundredfold more infuriated than if he had been
previously in a state of perfect calmness. It afterwards follows: —

<span id="viii.xiv"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p1"></span><span id="viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:13-15](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#013.md)<span
id="viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p2"></span>**13.** And the decree went forth that the
wise *men* should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be
slain.

<span id="viii.xiv-p3"></span>**13.** Et edictum exiit et sapientes
interficiebantur; et quaerebant Daniel et socios ejus ad interficiendum.

<span id="viii.xiv-p4"></span>**14.** Then Daniel answered with council
and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone
forth to slay the wise *men* of Babylon:

<span id="viii.xiv-p5"></span>**14.** Et tunc Daniel sciscitatus est
*de* consilio et edicto ab Arioch principe satellitum regis, qui exierat
ad interficiendum sapientes Babylonis.

<span id="viii.xiv-p6"></span>**15.** He answered and said to Arioch the
king’s captain, Why *is* the decree *so* hasty from the king? Then
Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.

<span id="viii.xiv-p7"></span>**15.** Respondit et dixi t ipsi Arioch
praefecto  <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) regis, Ad quid edic
tum festinat ev conspectu regis? Tunc rem  <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) patefecit Arioeh ipsi Danieli.

<span id="viii.xiv-p10"></span> 

<span id="viii.xiv-p11"></span><span id="viii.xiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p12"></span>It appears from these words that some of
the wise men had been slain, for Daniel at first is not required for
slaughter; but when the Magi and Chaldeans were promiscuously dragged
out for punishment, Daniel and his companions were in the same danger.
And this is clearly expressed thus — *widen the edict had gone forth,*
that is, was published, according to the Latin phrase, *and the wise
mere were slain,* then Daniel was also sought for; because the king
would never suffer his decree to be despised after it had once been
published; for if he had publicly commanded this to be done, and no
execution had been added, would not this have been ridiculous? Hence,
very probably, the slaughter of the Magi and Chaldeans was extensive.
Although the king had no lawful reason for this conduct, yet they
deserved their punishment; for, as we said yesterday, they deserved to
be exterminated from the world, and the pest must be removed if it could
possibly be accomplished. If Nebuchadnezzar had been like David, or
Hezekiah, or Josiah, he might most justly have destroyed them all, and
have purged the land from such defilements; but as he was only carried
away by the fervor of his wrath, he was himself in fault. Meanwhile, God
justly punishes the Chaldeans, and this admonition ought to profit the
whole people. They were hardened in their error, and were doubtless
rendered more excuseless by being blinded against such a judgment of
God. Because Daniel was condemned to death, though he had not been
called by the king, the injustice of the edicts of those kings who do
not inquire into the causes of which they are judges, becomes more
manifest.

<span id="viii.xiv-p13"></span><span id="viii.xiv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p14"></span>Nebuchadnezzar had often heard of Daniel,
and had been compelled to admire the dexterity of his genius, and the
singular gift of his wisdom. *How* comes it, then, that he passed him by
when he had need of his singular skill? Although the king anxiously
inquires concerning the dream, yet we observe he does not act seriously;
since it would doubtless have come into his mind, “Behold, thou hadst
formerly beheld in the captives of Judah the incredible gift of
celestial wisdom — -then, in the first place, send for them!” Here the
king’s sloth is detected because he did not send for Daniel among the
rest. We have stated this to be governed by the secret providence of
God, who was unwilling that his servant should mix with those ministers
of Satan, whose whole knowledge consisted in juggling and errors. We now
see how the king had neglected the gift of God, and had stifled the
light offered to him; but Daniel is next dragged to death. Therefore, I
said, that tyrants are, for this reason, very unjust, and exercise a
cruel violence because they will not undertake the labor and trouble of
inquiry. Meanwhile we see that God wonderfully snatches his own people
from the jaws of death, as it happened in Daniel’s case; for we may be
surprised at Arioch sparing his life when he slew the others who were
natives. How can we account for Daniel meeting with more humanity than
the Chaldeans, though he was a foreigner and a captive? Because his life
was in the hand and keeping of God, who restrained both the mind and the
hand of the prefect from being immediately savage with him. But it is
said — Daniel *inquired concerning the counsel and the edict* Some
translate *prudently* and *cunningly* and <span
id="viii.xiv-p14.1"></span>עטא, *gneta,* signifies “*prudence,*” just as
<span id="viii.xiv-p14.2"></span>טעם*, tegem,* metaphorically is
received for “*intelli*gence” when it signifies taste.  <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) But we shall afterwards find this
latter word used for an edict, and because this sense appears to suit
better, I therefore adopt it, as Daniel had inquired of the prefect the
meaning of the edict and the king’s design. Arioch also is called the
Prince of Satellites. Some translate it of executioners, and others of
cooks, for <span id="viii.xiv-p15.5"></span>טבח, *tebech,* signifies
“*to* slay,” but the noun deduced from this means a cook. Thus Potiphar
is called, to whom Joseph was sold. (<span
id="viii.xiv-p15.6"></span>[Ge
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen039.htm#001.md)<span
id="viii.xiv-p15.6"></span>.) It seems to me a. kind of absurdity to
call him the prince of gaolers; and if we say the prefect of cooks, it
is equally unsuitable to his office of being sent to slay the Chaldeans.
I therefore prefer interpreting it more mildly, supposing him to be the
prefect of the guards; for, as I have said, Potiphar is called <span
id="viii.xiv-p15.7"></span>רב טבחים*, reb tebechi,* and here the
pronunciation only is changed. It follows:

<span id="viii.xiv-p16"></span><span id="viii.xiv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p17"></span>Daniel also had said, *Whither does the
edict haste from before the king?* It seems by these words, that Daniel
obliquely blames the king’s anger and ingratitude, because he did not
inquire with sufficient diligence before he rushed forward to that cruel
punishment. Then he seems to mark his ingratitude, since he is now
undeservedly doomed to death without being sent for, though the king
might have known what was in him. As he refers to haste, I do not doubt
his expostulating with the king, since he was neither called for nor
listened to, and yet was to be slain with the rest, as if he were guilty
of the same fault as the Chaldeans. The conclusion is, — there was no
reason for such haste, since the king would probably find what he
desired, if he inquired more diligently. It is afterwards added, *Arioch
explained the matter to Daniel.* Whence it appears that Daniel was
formerly ignorant of the whole matter; and hence we may conjecture the
amount of the terror which seized upon the pious man. For he had known
nothing about it, and was led to punishment suddenly and unexpectedly,
as if he had been guilty. Hence, it was necessary for him to be divinely
strengthened, that he might with composure seek the proper time from
both the prefect and the king, for relating the dream and adding its
interpretation. Daniel’s power of acting so composedly, arose from God’s
singular gift, since terror would otherwise have seized on his mind; for
we are aware that in sudden events, we become deprived of all plan, and
lose our presence of mind. Since nothing of this kind was perceived in
Daniel, it becomes clear that his mind was governed by God’s Spirit. It
is afterwards added-

<span id="viii.xv"></span>

<span id="viii.xv-p1"></span><span id="viii.xv-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#016.md)<span id="viii.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xv-p2"></span>**16.** Then Daniel went in, and desired of
the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king
the interpretation.

<span id="viii.xv-p3"></span>**16.** Et Daniel ingressus est, et
postulavit a rege, ut tempus daret sibi, et expositionem  <span
id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) afferret regi.

<span id="viii.xv-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.xv-p6"></span><span id="viii.xv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xv-p7"></span>This verse contains nothing new, unless we
must notice what is not expressed, namely, that the prefect was not
entirely without fear in giving Daniel an introduction to the king. For
he knew the Icing to be very angry, and himself under serious
displeasure, for not immediately executing the edict. But, as we have
already said, God had taken Daniel into his confidence, and so bends and
tames the mind of the prefect, that he no longer hesitates to introduce
Daniel to the king. Another point is also gathered from the context,
namely, Daniel’s obtaining his request; for it is said, *he returned
home,* doubtless, because he obtained a single day from the king with
the view of satisfying his demands on the next day. And yet it is
surprising that this favor was granted, since the king wished the dream
narrated to him immediately. Although Daniel does not here relate the
reasons which he used with the king, yet most probably he confessed what
we shall afterwards observe in its own place, namely, that he was not
endued with sufficient intelligence to expound the dream, but hoping in
God’s kindness, he would return next day with a new revelation.
Otherwise the king would never have permitted this, if Daniel had
petitioned doubtfully; or if he had not borne witness to his hopes of
some, secret revelation from God, he would have been rejected
immediately, and would have provoked still further the anger of the
king. The Hebrews very commonly mention afterwards, in the context,
whatever they omit in its proper place. So when he modestly confesses
his inability to satisfy the king, till he has received from the Lord a
faithful message, the king grants him the required time, as we shall
see; more clearly afterwards. It follows —

<span id="viii.xvi"></span>

<span id="viii.xvi-p1"></span><span id="viii.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#017.md)<span
id="viii.xvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvi-p2"></span>**17.** Then Daniel went to his house, and
made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:

<span id="viii.xvi-p3"></span>**17.** Tumc Daniel in domurn venit,
 <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) et Hananise, et Misaeli, et
Azariae sociis suis sermonem  <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md)
patefecit.

<span id="viii.xvi-p6"></span>**18.** That they would desire mercies of
the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows
should not perish with the rest of the wise *men* of Babylon.

<span id="viii.xvi-p7"></span>**18.** Et misericordias ad petendurm
 <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) a facie Dei coelorum super
arcano hoc, ut ne interficerentur Danielet socii ejuscum residuo
sapientum Babylonis.  <span id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md)

<span id="viii.xvi-p10"></span> 

<span id="viii.xvi-p11"></span><span id="viii.xvi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvi-p12"></span>We observe with what object and with what
confidence Daniel demanded an extension of time. His object was to
implore God’s grace. Confidence was also added, since he perceived a
double punishment awaiting him, if he disappointed the king; if he had
returned the next day without reply, the king would not have been
content with an easy death, but would have raged with cruelty against
Daniel, in consequence of his deception. Without the slightest doubt,
Daniel expected what he obtained — namely, that the king’s dream would
be revealed to him. He therefore urges his companions to implore
unitedly mercy from God. Daniel had already obtained the singular gift
of being an interpreter of dreams, and as. we, have seen, he alone was a
Prophet. of God. God was accustomed to manifest his intentions to his
Prophets by dreams or visions, (<span id="viii.xvi-p12.1"></span>[Nu
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/num012.htm#006.md)<span
id="viii.xvi-p12.1"></span>,) and Daniel had obtained both. Since
Misael, Hananiah, and Azariah were united with him in prayer, we gather
that they were not induced by ambition, to desire anything for
themselves; for if they had been rivals of Daniel, they could not have
prayed in concord with him. They did not pray about their own private
concerns, but only for the interpretation of the dream being made known
to Daniel. We observe, too, how sincerely they agree in their prayers,
how all pride and ambition is laid aside, and without any desire for
their own advantage. Besides, it is worthy of notice why they are said
*to have desired mercy from God* Although they, do not hem come into
God’s presence as criminals, yet they hoped their request would be
graciously granted, and hence the word “mercy” is used. Whenever we fly
to God to bring assistance to our necessities, our eyes and all our
senses ought always to be turned towards his nlerey, for his more good
will reconciles him to us. When it is said, at. the close of the
*verse,* — *they should not perish with the rest of the wise men of
Babylon,* some explain this, as if they had been anxious about the life
of the Magi, and wished to snatch them also from death. But although
they wished all persons to be safe, clearly enough they here separate
themselves from the Magi and Chaldeans; their conduct was far different.
It now follows —

<span id="viii.xvii"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p1"></span><span id="viii.xvii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:19](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#019.md)<span id="viii.xvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p2"></span>**19.** Then was the secret revealed unto
Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

<span id="viii.xvii-p3"></span>**19.** Tunc Danieli in visione
noctisarcanum patefactumest: tunc Daniel benedixit Deum coeli.

<span id="viii.xvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xvii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p6"></span>Here it may be gathered, that Daniel did
not vacillate nor pray with his companions through any doubt upon his
mind. For that sentence of James ought to *come* into our memory,
namely, Those who hesitate, and tremble, and pray to God with
difference, are unworthy of being heard. Let not such a one, says James,
think he shall obtain anything from the Lord, if he is driven about
variously like the waves of the sea. (<span
id="viii.xvii-p6.1"></span>[Jas
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#006)<span id="viii.xvii-p6.1"></span>..md)
As God, therefore, shewed himself propitious to the prayers of Daniel,
we conclude him to have prayed with true faith, and to be clearly
persuaded that his life was in God’s hands; hence, also, he felt that
God did not vainly harass the mind of King Nebuchadnezzar, but was
preparing some signal and remarkable judgment for him. Because Daniel
was imbued with this firm persuasion, he exercises a sure confidence,
and prays to God as if he had already obtained his request. On the other
hand, we perceive that God never closes his ears when rightly and
cordially invoked, as also it is said in the Psalms, (<span
id="viii.xvii-p6.2"></span>[Ps
145:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa145.htm#018.md)<span
id="viii.xvii-p6.2"></span>,) He is near to all who pray to him in
truth; for there cannot be truth *when* faith is wanting; but as Daniel
brought faith and sincerity to his prayers, he was listened to, and the
secret concerning the dream was made known to him in a vision by night.
I cannot now proceed any further.

<span id="viii.xviii"></span>

<span id="viii.xviii-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="viii.xviii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since we are in
danger every day and ever, moment, not merely from the cruelty of a
single tyrant, but from the devil, who excites the whole world against
us, arming the princes of this world, and impelling them to destroy us,
— Grant, I pray thee, that we may feel and demonstrate, by experience,
that our life is in thy hand, and that under thy faithful guardianship
thou wilt not suffer one hair of our heads to fall. Do thou also so
defend us, that the impious themselves may acknowledge that we do not
boast this day in vain in thy name, nor invoke thee without success. And
when we have experienced thy paternal anxiety, through the whole course
of our life, may we arrive at that blessed immortality which thou hast
promised us, and which is laid up for us in heaven, through Jesus Christ
our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="viii.xix-p1"></span>Lecture Seventh

<span id="viii.xx"></span>

<span id="viii.xx-p1"></span><span id="viii.xx-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#020.md)<span id="viii.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xx-p2"></span>**20.** Daniel answered and said, Blessed
be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:

<span id="viii.xx-p3"></span>**20.** Loquutus est  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) Daniel et dixit, Sit nomen Dei
benedicitum a seculo et in seculum ejus est sapientia, et robur ipsius.
 <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md)

<span id="viii.xx-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xx-p7"></span><span id="viii.xx-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xx-p8"></span>Daniel here pursues his narrative, and
thanks God after King Nebuchadnezzar’s dream had been made known to him,
while he relates the sense of the words which he had used. *May God’s
name be blessed,* says he, *from age to age* We ought daily to wish for
this; for when we pray that God’s name may be hallowed, continuance is
denoted under this form of prayer. But Daniel here breaks forth into the
praises of God with greater vehemence, because he acknowledges his
singular benefit in being snatched away from death, together with his
companions, beyond his expectation. Whenever God confers any remarkable
blessing on his servants, they are the more stirred up to praise him, as
David says, (<span id="viii.xx-p8.1"></span>[Ps
40:3](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#003)<span id="viii.xx-p8.1"></span>,.md)
Thou hast put a new song into my mouth. And Isaiah also uses this form
of speech twice, (<span id="viii.xx-p8.2"></span>[Isa
42:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#010)<span id="viii.xx-p8.2"></span>,.md)
as if God had given him material for a new and unusual song, in dealing
so wonderfully with his Church. So also, there is no doubt that Daniel
here wished to praise God in a remarkable manner, since he had received
a rare proof of his favor in being delivered from instant death.
Afterwards he adds, *whose (or since his) is the wisdom and the
strength;* for the relative is here taken for the causal particle, and
the sentence ought to be so expressed; the additional particles may
avail to strengthen the expression, and be taken exclusively, as if he
had said, — to God alone ought the praise of wisdom and virtue to be
ascribed. Without him, indeed, both are sought in vain; but these graces
do not seem to suit the present purpose; for Daniel ought rather to
celebrate God’s praises, through this vision being opened, and this was
enough to content him. But he may here speak of God’s glory as well from
his power as his wisdom; as, when, re Scripture wishes to distinguish
the true God from all fictions, it takes these two principles — first,
God governs all things by his own hand, and retains them under his sway;
and secondly, nothing is hid from him — and these points cannot be
separated when his majesty is to be proved. We see mankind fabricating
deities for themselves, and thus multiplying gods, and distributing to
*each* his own office; because they cannot rest in simple unity, when
God is treated of. Some fancy God retains but half his attributes; as.
for instance, the praters about bare foreknowledge. They admit nothing
to be hidden to God, and his knowledge of all things; and this they
prove by the prophecies which occur in the Scriptures. What they say is
true; but they very much lessen the glory of God; nay, they tear it to
pieces by likening him to Apollo, whose office it formerly was, hi the
opinion of the heathen, to predict future events. When they sought
predictions of future events, they endued Apollo with the virtue of
making known to them future occurrences. Many at the present time think
God able to foresee all things, but suppose him either to dissemble or
purposely withdraw from the government of the world.

<span id="viii.xx-p9"></span>Lastly, Their notion of God’s foreknowledge
is but a cold and idle speculation. Hence I said, they rob God of half
his glory, and, as far as they can, tear him to pieces. But Scripture,
when it wishes to assert what is peculiar to God, joins these two things
inseparably; first, God foresees all things, since nothing is hidden
from his eyes; and next, he appoints future events, and governs the
world by his will, allowing nothing to happen by chance or without his
direction. Daniel here assumes this principle, or rather unites the two,
by asserting Israel’s God alone to deserve the name, since both wisdom
and strength are in his power. We must remember how God is defrauded of
his just praise when we do not connect these two attributes together —
his universal foresight and his government of the world allowing nothing
to happen without his permission. But as it would be too cold to assert
that to God alone belongs wisdom and strength, unless his wisdom was
conspicuous, and his strength openly acknowledged, hence it follows
immediately afterwards —

<span id="viii.xxi"></span>

<span id="viii.xxi-p1"></span><span id="viii.xxi-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#021.md)<span id="viii.xxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxi-p2"></span>**21.** And he changeth the times and the
seasons: he removeth kings, and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto
the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:

<span id="viii.xxi-p3"></span>**21.** Et ipse  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) mutat tempora, et articulos temporum,
constituit reges et admovet reges: dat sapientiam sapientibus, et
scientiam iis qui scientiam cognoscunt.  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md)

<span id="viii.xxi-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxi-p7"></span><span id="viii.xxi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxi-p8"></span>Daniel explains, in these words, what
might have been obscure; for he teaches God to be the true fountain of
wisdom and virtue, while he does not confine them to himself alone, but
diffuses them through heaven and earth. And we must mark this
diligently; for when Paul affirms God alone to be wise, this praise does
not seem magnificent enough, (<span id="viii.xxi-p8.1"></span>[Ro
16:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#027.md)<span
id="viii.xxi-p8.1"></span>;) but when we think of God’s wisdom, and set
before our eyes all around and about us, then we feel more strongly the
import of Paul’s words, that God only is wise. God, therefore, as I have
already stated, does not keep His wisdom confined to himself, but makes
it flow throughout the whole world. The full sense of the verse is, —
whatever wisdom and power exists in the world, is a testimony to the
Almighty’s. This is man’s ingratitude; whenever they find anything
worthy of praise in themselves or others, they claim it directly as
their own, and thus God’s glory is diminished by the depravity of those
who obtain their blessings from him. We are here taught not to detract
anything from God’s wisdom and power, since wherever these qualities are
conspicuous in the world, they ought rather to reflect his glory. We now
perceive the Prophet’s meaning — God places before our eyes, as in a
glass, the proofs of his wisdom and power, when the affairs of the world
roll on, and mankind become powerful through wisdom, and some are raised
on high, and others fall to the ground. Experience teaches us these
events do not proceed from human skill, or through the equable course of
nature, while the loftiest kings are cast down and others elevated to
the highest posts of honor. Daniel, therefore, admonishes us not to seek
in heaven alone for God’s wisdom and power, since it is apparent to us
on earth, and proofs of it are daily presented to our observation. We
now see how these two verses are mutually united He had stated wisdom to
belong exclusively to God; he now shews that it is not hidden within
him, but is made manifest to us; and we may perceive by familiar
experience, how all wisdom flows from him as its exclusive fountain. We
ought to feel the same concurring power also.

<span id="viii.xxi-p9"></span>*It is he,* then, *who changes times and
portions of time.* We know it to be ascribed to fortune when the world
passes through such uncertain changes that everything is daily changing.
hence the profane consider all things to be acted on by blind impulse,
and others affirm the human race to be a kind of sport to God, since men
are tossed about like balls. But, as I have already said, it is not
surprising to find men of a perverse and corrupt disposition thus
perverting the object of all God’s works. For our own practical
improvement we should consider what the Prophet is here teaching, how
revolutions, as they are called, are testimonies of God’s power, and
point out with the finger to the truth that the affairs of men are ruled
by the Most High. For we must of necessity adopt one or the other of
these views, either that nature rules over human events, or else fortune
turns about in every direction, things which ought to have an even
course. As far as nature is concerned, its course would be even, unless
God by his singular counsel, as we have seen, thus changes the course of
the times. Yet those philosophers who assign the supreme authority to
nature are much sounder than others who place fortune in the highest
rank. For if we admit for a moment this latter opinion that fortune
directs human affairs by a kind of blind impulse, whence comes this
fortune? If you ask them for a definition, what answer will they make?
They will surely be compelled to confess this, the word “*fortune*”
explains nothing. But neither God nor nature will have any place in this
vain and changeable government of the world, where all things throw
themselves into distinct forms without the least order or connection.
And if this be granted, truly the doctrine of Epicurus will be received,
because if God resigns the supreme government of the world, so that all
things are rashly mingled together, he is no longer God. But in this
variety he rather displays his hand in claiming for himself the empire
over the world. In so many changes, then, which meet us on every side,
and by which the whole face of things is renewed, we must remember that
the Providence of God shines forth; and things do not flow on in an even
course, because then the peculiar property of God might with some shew
of reason be ascribed to nature. God, I say, so changes empires, and
times, and seasons, that we should learn to look up to him. If the sun
always rose and set at the same period, or at least certain symmetrical
changes took place yearly, without any casual change; if the days of
winter were not short, and those of summer not long, we might then
discover the same order of nature, and in this way God would be rejected
from his own dominion. But when the days of winter not only differ in
length from those of summer, but even spring does not always retain the
same temperature, but is sometimes stormy and snowy, and at others warm
and genial; and since summers are so various, no year being just like
the former one; since the air is changed every hour, and the heavens put
on new appearances — when we discern all these things, God rouses us up,
that we may not grow torpid in our own grossness, and erect nature into
a deity, and de-wive him of his lawful honor, and transfer to our own
fancy what he claims for himself alone. If then, in these ordinary
events, we are compelled to acknowledge God’s Providence, if any change
of greater moment arises, as when God transfers empires from one hand to
another, and all but transforms the whole world, ought we not then to be
the more affected, unless we are utterly stupid? Daniel, therefore, very
reasonably corrects the perverse opinion which commonly seizes upon the
senses of all, that the world either rolls on by chance, or that nature
is the supreme deity, when he asserts — God changes times and seasons.

<span id="viii.xxi-p10"></span>It is evident from the context, that he
is here properly speaking of empires, since *he appoints and removes
kings* We feel great difficulty in believing kings placed upon their
thrones by a divine power, and afterwards deposed again, since we
naturally fancy that they acquire their power by their own talents, or
by hereditary right, or by fortuitous accident Meanwhile all thought of
God is excluded, when the industrly, or valor, or success, or any other
quality of man is extolled! Hence it is said in the Psalms, neither from
the east nor the west, but God alone is the judge. (<span
id="viii.xxi-p10.1"></span>[Ps. 75:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#007)<span id="viii.xxi-p10.1"></span>..md)
The Prophet there derides the discourses of those who call themselves
Wise, and who gather up reasons from all sides to shew how power is
assigned to man, by either his own counsel and valor, or by good fortune
or other human and inferior instruments. Look round, says he, wherever
you please, from the rising to the setting of the sun, and you will find
no reason why one man becomes lord of his fellow-creatures rather than
another. God alone is the judge; that is, the government must remain
entirely with the one God. So also in this passage, the Lord is said to
appoint kings, and to raise them from the rest of mankind as he pleases.
As this argument is a most important one, it might be treated more
copiously; but since the same opportunity will occur in other passages,
I comment but shortly on the contents of this verse; for we shall often
have to treat of the state of kingdoms and of their ruin and changes. I
am therefore unwilling to add anything more at present, as it is
sufficient to explain Daniel’s intention thus briefly.

<span id="viii.xxi-p11"></span>He afterwards adds, — *he gives wisdom to
the wise, and knowledge to those who are endued with it* In this second
clause, the Prophet confirms what we have already said, that God’s
wisdom is not shrouded in darkness, but is manifested to us, as he daily
gives us sure and remarkable proofs of this. Meanwhile he here corrects
the ingratitude of men who assume to themselves the praise of their own
excellencies which spring from God, and thus become almost sacrilegious.
Daniel, therefore, asserts that men have no wisdom but what springs from
God. Men are, indeed, clever and intelligent, but the question arises,
whether it springs from themselves? He also shews us how mankind are to
be blamed in claiming anything as their own, since they have really
nothing belonging to them, however they may be wrapt, in admiration of
themselves. Who then will boast of becoming wise by his own innate
strength? Has he originated the intellect with which he is endowed?
Because God is the sole author of wisdom and knowledge, the gifts by
which he has adorned men ought not to obscure his glory, but rather to
illustrate it. He afterwards adds —

<span id="viii.xxii"></span>

<span id="viii.xxii-p1"></span><span id="viii.xxii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:22](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#022.md)<span id="viii.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxii-p2"></span>**22.** He revealeth the deep and secret
things: he knoweth what *is* in the darkness, and the light dwelleth
with him.

<span id="viii.xxii-p3"></span>**22.** Ipse patefecit profunda et
abscondita cognoseit quod in tenebris,  <span
id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) et lux cum eo habitat.  <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md)

<span id="viii.xxii-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxii-p7"></span><span id="viii.xxii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxii-p8"></span>He pursues the same sentiment, and
confirms it, — that all mortals receive from God’s Spirit whatever
intelligence and light they enjoy; but he proceeds a step further in
this verse than in the last. He had said generally, that, men receive
wisdom and understanding by God’s good will; but here he speaks
specially; for when a man’s understanding is rare and unusual, there
God’s gift shines forth more clearly; as if he had said — God not only
distributes to every one according to the measure of his own liberality,
whatever acuteness and ingenuity they possess, but he adorns some with
such intelligence that they appear as his interpreters. He speaks,
therefore, here, specially of the gift of prophecy; as if he had said,
God’s goodness is conspicuous, not only in the ordinary prudence of
mankind, for no one is so made as to be unable to discover between
justice and injustice, and to form some plan for regulating his life;
but in Prophets there is something extraordinary, which renders God’s
wisdom more surprising. Whence, then, do Prophets obtain the power of
prophesying concerning hidden events, and penetrating above the heavens,
and surpassing all bounds? Is this common to all men? Surely this far
exceeds the ordinary ability of man, while the Prophet here teaches
that; God’s beneficence and power deserve more praise, *because he
reveals hidden and secret things;* and in this sense he adds — *light
dwells with God;* as if he had said, — God differs very much from us,
since we are involved in many clouds and mists; but to God all things
are clear; he has no occasion to hesitate, or inquire, and has no need
to be hindered through ignorance. Now, we fully understand the Prophet’s
meaning.

<span id="viii.xxii-p9"></span>Let us learn from this passage to
attribute to God that praise which the greater part of the world claims
to itself with sacrilegious audacity, though God shews it to belong to
himself. Whatever understanding or judgment we may possess, we should
remember that it was first received from God. Hence, also, if we have
but a small portion of common sense, we are still equally indebted to
God, for we should be like stocks or stones unless by his secret
instinct he endued us with understanding. But if any one excels others,
and obtains the admiration of all men, he ought still modestly to submit
himself to God, and acknowledge himself the more bound to him, because
he has received more than others. For who knows himself fully but God?
The more, therefore, he excels in understanding, the more he will lay
aside all claims of his own, and extol the beneficence of God. Thirdly,
let, us learn that the understanding of spiritual things is a rare and
singular gift of the Holy Spirit, in which God’s power shines forth
conspicuously. Let us guard against that diabolical pride by which we
see almost; the whole world to be swollen and intoxicated. And in this
respect we should chiefly glorify God, as he has not, only adorned us
with ordinary foresight, enabling us to discern between good and evil,
but raised us above the ordinary level of human nature, and so
enlightened us that we can understand things far exceeding our
capacities. When Daniel pronounces *light to be with God,* we must
supply a tacit antithesis; since he indicates, as I have already said,
that men are surrounded by thick darkness, and grope about in obscurity.
The habitation of men is here obliquely contrasted with the sanctuary of
God; as if the Prophet had said, there is no pure and perfect light but
in God alone. Hence, when we remain in our natural state, we must
necessarily wander in darkness, or at least be obscured by many clouds.
These words naturally lead us not to rest satisfied in our own position,
but to seek from God that light in which he only dwells. Meanwhile, we
should remember how God dwells in light unapproachable, (<span
id="viii.xxii-p9.1"></span>[1Ti
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016.md)<span
id="viii.xxii-p9.1"></span>,) unless he deigns to stretch forth his hand
to us. Hence, if we desire to become partakers of this divine light, let
us be, on our guard against audacity, and mindful of our ignorance; let;
us seek God’s illumination. Thus his light will not be inaccessible to
us, when, by his Spirit, he shall conduct us beyond the skies. He
afterwards adds —

<span id="viii.xxiii"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#023.md)<span id="viii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiii-p2"></span>**23.** I thank thee, and praise thee, O
thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast
made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast *now* made
known unto us the king’s matter.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p3"></span>**23.** Tibi confiteor, Deus patrum

postulavimus abs te; qui negotium  <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) regis patefecisti nobis.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxiii-p7"></span><span id="viii.xxiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiii-p8"></span>Daniel turns his discourse to God. *I
confess to thee,* says he, *O God of my fathers, and praise thee* Here
he more openly distinguishes the God of the Israelites from all the
fictions of the nations. Nor does he use this epithet in vain, when he
praises the God of his fathers; for he wishes to reduce to nothing all
the fabrications of the Gentiles concerning a multitude of deities.
Daniel rejects this as a vain and foolish thing, and shews how the God
of Israel alone is worthy of praise. But he does not found the glory of
God on the authority of their fathers, as the Papists, when they wish to
ascribe the supreme power to either George, or Catharine, or any others,
count up the number of ages during which the error has prevailed. Thus
they wish whatever the consent of mankind has approved to be received as
oracular. But if religion depended on the common consent of mankind,
where would be its stability? We know nothing vainer than the minds of
men. If man is weighed, says the Prophet, with vanity in a balance,
vanity itself will preponderate. (<span id="viii.xxiii-p8.1"></span>[Ps
62:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#009.md)<span
id="viii.xxiii-p8.1"></span>.) Nothing, therefore, is more foolish than
this principle of this king, — what has prevailed by the consent of many
ages must be religiously true. But here Daniel partially commends the
God of their fathers, as their fathers were the sorts of God. For that
sacred adoption prevailed among the Jews, by which God chose Abraham and
his whole family for himself. Daniel, therefore, here does not extol the
persons of men, as if they either could or ought to add anything they
pleased to God; but this is the reason why he says, *the God of Israel
is the God of their fathers,* since he was of that race which the
Almighty had adopted. On the whole, he so opposes the God of Israel to
all the idols of the Gentiles, that the mark of separation is in the
covenant itself, and in the celestial doctrine by which he revealed
himself to the sacred fathers. For while the Gentiles have no certain
vision, and follow only their own dreams, Daniel here deservedly sets
forth *the God of their fathers.*

<span id="viii.xxiii-p9"></span>He afterwards adds, *because thou hast
given me wisdom and strength* As far as relates to wisdom, the reason
is. clear enough why Daniel thanks God, since he had obtained, as he
soon afterwards says, the revelation of the dream. He had also formerly
been endued with the prophetic spirit and with visions. as he related in
the first chapter, (<span id="viii.xxiii-p9.1"></span>[Da
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#017.md)<span
id="viii.xxiii-p9.1"></span>.) We may here, inquire what he means by
*strength?* He was not remarkable for his honor among men, nor was he
ever a commander in military affairs, and he had no superior gift of
magnificent power to cause him to return thanks to God. But Daniel
regards this as the principal point, that the God. of Israel was then
acknowledged as the true and only God; because, whatever wisdom and
virtue exists in the world, it flows from him as its only source. For
this reason he speaks of himself as well as of all others, as if he had
said — If I have any strength or understanding, I ascribe it all to
thee; it is thine entirely. And, truly, though Daniel was neither a king
nor a prefect, yet that unconquered greatness of mind which we have seen
was not to be esteemed as without value. Hence he very properly
acknowledges something of this kind to have been conferred upon him by
heaven. Lastly, his intention is to debase himself and to attribute to
God his own; but he speaks concisely, as we have said, since under the
phrases “*power*” and “*wisdom*” he had previously embraced the proof of
his divinity. He afterwards adds, *Thou hast revealed to me what we
demanded of thee; thou hast made known to us the king’s inquiry* There
seems here a slight discrepancy, as he praises God for granting him a
revelation of the dream, and then unites others to himself. Yet the
revelation was not common to them, but peculiar to himself. The solution
is easy; for he first expresses that this was given to himself
specially, that he might know the king’s dream and understand its
interpretation. When he has confessed this, he extends the benefit to
his companions, and deservedly so; because though they did not yet
understand what God had conferred upon Daniel, yet he had obtained this
in their favor,-they were all snatched from death, and all their prayers
attended to. And this availed very much for the confirmation of their
faith as it assured them they had not prayed in vain. For we said that
there was no ambition in their prayers, as if any one desired any
peculiar gift by which he might acquire honor and estimation for himself
in the world. Nothing of the kind. It was enough for them to shew forth
God’s name among unbelievers; because by his kindness, they had been
delivered from death. Hence Daniel very properly says, the king’s dream
was made known to him with its interpretation; and this he will
afterwards transfer to his companions.

<span id="viii.xxiv"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiv-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="viii.xxiv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since we have so
many testimonies to thy glory daily before our eyes, though we seem so
blind as to shut out all the light by our ingratitude; grant, I pray,
that we may at length learn to open our eyes; yea, do thou open them by
thy Spirit. May we reflect on the number, magnitude, and importance of
thy benefits towards us; and while thou dost set before us the proof of
thy eternal divinity, grant that we may become proficient in this school
of piety. May we learn to ascribe to thee the praise of all. virtues,
till nothing remains but to extol thee alone. And the more thou deignest
to declare thyself liberal towards us, may we the more ardently desire
to worship thee. May we devote ourselves to thee without reserving the
slightest self praise, but caring for this only, that thy glory may
remain and shine forth throughout all the world, through Christ our
Lord. — Amen.

<span id="viii.xxvi-p2"></span>**24.** Therefore Daniel went in unto
Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise *men* of Babylon:
he went and said thus unto him; Destroy not the wise *men* of Babylon:
bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the
interpretation.

<span id="viii.xxvi-p3"></span>**24.** Itaque ingressus est Daniel ad

<span id="viii.xxvi-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxvi-p6"></span><span id="viii.xxvi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxvi-p7"></span>Before Daniel sent his message to the
king, as we saw yesterday, he discharged the duty of piety as he ought,
for he testified his gratitude to God for revealing the secret. But he
now says, *that he came to Arioch, who had been sent by the king to,
slay the Magi, and asked him not to kill them, for he had a revelation;*
of which we shall afterwards treat. Here we must notice that some of the
Magi were slain, as I have said. For after Arioch had received the
king’s mandate, he would never have dared to delay it even a few days;
but a delay occurred after Daniel had requested a short space of time,
to be afforded him. Then Arioch relaxed from the severity of the king’s
order against the Magi; and now Daniel asks him to spare the remainder.
He seems, indeed, to have done this with little judgment, because we
ought to desire the utter abolition of magical arts, for we saw before
that they were diabolical sorceries. It may be answered thus, — although
Daniel, saw many faults and corruptions in the Magi and their art, or
science, or false pretensions to knowledge, yet, since the principles
were true, he was unwilling to allow what had proceeded from God to be
blotted out. But; it seems to me that Daniel’s object was somewhat
different, for although the Magi might have been utterly destroyed
without the slightest difficulty, yet he looks rather to the cause, and
therefore wished the persons to be spared. It will often happen that
wicked men are called in question as well as those who have deserved a
tenfold death; but if they are not punished for any just reason, we
ought; to spare their persons, not through their worthiness, but through
our own habitual sense of equity and rectitude. It is therefore probable
that Daniel, when he saw the king’s command concerning the slaughter of
the Magi to be so tyrannical, went out to meet him, lest; they should
all be slain with savage and cruel violence, without; the slightest
reason. I therefore think that Daniel spared the Magi, but not through
any personal regard; he wished them to be safe, but for another purpose,
namely, to await their punishment from God. Their iniquity was not yet
ripe for destruction through the indignation of the king. It is not
surprising, then, that Daniel wished, as far as possible, to hinder this
cruelty. It afterwards follows, —

<span id="viii.xxvii"></span>

<span id="viii.xxvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:25](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#025.md)<span id="viii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxvii-p2"></span>**25.** Then Arioch brought in Daniel
before the king in haste, and said thus unto him, I have found a man of
the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the
interpretation.

<span id="viii.xxvii-p3"></span>**25.** Tunc Arioch cum festinatione
introduxit Danielem ad regem, et sic locutus est el, Inveni virum ex
filiis captivitatis Jehudah, qui interpretationem regi notam faciet.

<span id="viii.xxvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxvii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxvii-p6"></span>It may here be a question, in what sense
Arioch speaks of bringing Daniel before the king, as if it were
something new. For Daniel had already requested from the king time for
prayer, as we have seen. Why then does Arioch now boast of *having found
a man of the captives of Judah,* as if he were speaking of all obscure
and unknown person? But very probably Daniel requested the time for
prayer from Arioch, since we learn from history how difficult it was to
approach those kings; for they thought it a profanation of their majesty
to be polite and humane. The conjecture, therefore, is probable, that
Arioch was the channel through whom the king granted the time to Daniel;
or, we may suppose the words of Arioch are not simply related, but that
Daniel shews the great boasting of courtiers, who always praise their
own good offices, and adorn them with the splendor of words. Hence
Arioch reminds the king how he had met with Daniel, and had at length
obtained what the king very urgently desired. I do not therefore dwell
longer on this, since either Arioch then explained more clearly to the
long that Daniel could interpret, his dream; or he joined what had
formerly been done; or else Daniel had obtained this before; or he had
begged of the king that some time should be given to Daniel. He puts
*sons of transmigration, or captivity,* a usual scriptural phrase for
captives, although this noun is collective. It now follows, —

<span id="viii.xxviii"></span>

<span id="viii.xxviii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#026.md)<span
id="viii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxviii-p2"></span>**26.** The king answered and said to
Daniel, whose name *was* Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto
me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?

<span id="viii.xxviii-p3"></span>**26.** Respondit *rex,* et dixit
Danieli cujus nomen *erat* Baltesazzar, Estne tibi facultas ad
notificandum  <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) mihi somnium quod
vidi, et interpretationem ejus?

<span id="viii.xxviii-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxviii-p6"></span><span id="viii.xxviii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxviii-p7"></span>The king uses these words through his
despair of all interpretation, since he perceived all the Magi in this
respect without judgment and understanding; for he was at first
persuaded that the Magi alone were the possessors of wisdom. Since he
had asked them in vain, the error with which he was imbued, as I have
said, prevented him from hoping for anything better elsewhere. Through
surprise, then, he here inquires, as if the thing were impossible, Have
you that power? There is no doubt that God drew this interrogation from
the proud king to render his grace in Daniel more illustrious. The less
hope there was in the king himself, the more there was in the revelation
of both dignity and reverence, as we shall afterwards see; for the, king
was astonished, and fell prostrate through stupor upon the earth before
a captive! This is the reason wily Daniel relates the use of this
interrogation by the king. It now follows, —

<span id="viii.xxix"></span>

<span id="viii.xxix-p1"></span><span id="viii.xxix-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:27](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#027.md)<span id="viii.xxix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxix-p2"></span>**27.** Daniel answered in the presence
of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot
the wise *men*, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew
unto the king;

<span id="viii.xxix-p3"></span>**27.** Respondit Daniel regi, et dixit,
Arcanum quod rex postulat sapientes, magi, astrologi, genethliasi non
possunt indicare regi.

<span id="viii.xxix-p4"></span>**28.** But there is a God in heaven that
revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what
shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon
thy bed, are these;

<span id="viii.xxix-p5"></span>**28.** Sed est Deus in coelis, qui
revelat arcana; et indicavit regi Nebuchadnezzar quid futurum sit in
fine  <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) dierum somnium tuum, et
visio capitis tuisuper lectum tuum, haec est.

<span id="viii.xxix-p7"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxix-p8"></span><span id="viii.xxix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxix-p9"></span>First, with respect to these names we
need not trouble ourselves much, since even the Jews themselves are
compelled to guess at them. They are very bold in their definitions and
rash in their affirmations, and jet they cannot clearly distinguish how
one kind of wise man differed from the others; hence it is sufficient
for us to hold that the discourse now concerns those then esteemed “wise
men,” under the various designations of Magi, Soothsayers, and
Astrologers. Now, as to Daniel’s answer. He says it was not surprising
that the king did not find what he hoped for among the Magi, since God
had breathed into him this dream beyond the comprehension of human
intellect. I know not whether those interpreters are right who think
magical arts here simply condemned; for I rather think a comparison is
instituted; between the king’s dream and the substance of the science of
the Magi. I always exclude superstitions by which they vitiated true and
genuine science. But as far as the principles are concerned, we cannot
precisely condemn astronomy and whatever belongs to the consideration of
the order of nature. This appears to me the whole intention, — the
king’s dream was not subjected to human knowledge, for mortals have no
such natural skill as to be able to comprehend the meaning of the dream,
and God manifests those secrets which need the peculiar revelation of
the Spirit. When Daniel says the Magi, Astrologers, and the rest cannot
explain to the king his dream, and are not suitable interpreters of it,
the true reason is, because the dream was not natural and had nothing in
common with human conjectures, but was the peculiar revelation of the
Spirit. As when Paul disputes concerning the Gospel, he collects into
order every kind of intelligence among men, because those who are endued
with any remarkable acuteness or ability think they can accomplish
anything. But the doctrine of the Gospel is a heavenly mystery (<span
id="viii.xxix-p9.1"></span>[1Co
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004)<span id="viii.xxix-p9.1"></span>.md)
which cannot be comprehended by the most learned and talented among men.
The real sense of Daniel’s words is this, — the Magi, Astrologers, and
Soothsayers had no power of expounding the king’s dream, since it was
neither natural nor human.

<span id="viii.xxix-p10"></span>This is clearly evident from the
context, because he adds,

<span id="viii.xxix-p11"></span><span id="viii.xxix-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxix-p12"></span>*There is a God in heaven who reveals
secrets* For I take <span id="viii.xxix-p12.1"></span>ברם, *berem,* here
for the adversative particle. He opposes therefore the revelation of God
to the conjectures and interpretations of the Magi, since all human
sciences are included, so to speak, within their own bounds and bolts.
Daniel, therefore, says that the matter requires the singular gift of
the Holy Spirit. The same God also who revealed the king’s dream to
Daniel, distributes to each of us ability and skill according to his own
pleasure. Whence does it arise that some are remarkable for quickness
and others for stupidity and sloth? — that some become proficients in
human arts and learning, and others remain utterly ignorant, unless God
shews, by this variety, how by his power and will the minds of men
become enlightened or remain blunt and stupid? As the Almighty is the
supreme origin of all intelligence in the world, What Daniel here says
is not generally true; and this contrast, unless we come to particulars,
is either cold or superfluous. We understand, therefore, why he said in
the former verse that the Magi and Astrologers could not explain the
king’s dream, since the Almighty had raised King Nebuchadnezzar above
the common level for the purpose of explaining futurity to him through
his dream.

<span id="viii.xxix-p13"></span>There is then *a God in heaven who
reveals secrets; he shews to king Nebuchadnezzar what will come to
pass.* He confirms what I have said, that the king was utterly unable to
comprehend the meaning of his own dream. It often happens that men’s
minds move hither and thither, and thus make clever guesses; but Daniel
excludes all human *media,* and speaks of the dream as proceeding
directly from God. He adds, *what shall happen at the end* or extremity
*of the days* We may inquire what he means by the word “extremity.”
Interpreters think this ought to be referred to the advent of Christ;
but they do not explain why this word signifies Christ’s advent. There
is no obscurity in the phrase; “*the* end of the days” signifies the
advent of Christ, because it was a kind of renewal to the world. Most.
truly, indeed, the world is still in the same state of agitation as it
was when Christ was manifest in the flesh; but, as we shall afterwards
see, Christ came for the very purpose of renovating the world, and since
his Gospel is a kind of perfection of all things, we are said to be “in
the last days.” Daniel compares the whole period preceding Christ’s
advent with this extremity of the days. God therefore wished to shew the
king of Babylon what should occur after one monarchy had destroyed
another, and also that there should be an end of those changes whenever
Christ’s kingdom should arrive. At present I touch but briefly on this
point, since more must; be said upon it by and bye.

<span id="viii.xxix-p14"></span>*This,* says he, *is the dream and
vision of thy head upon thy couch* It may seem absurd for Daniel here to
profess to explain to the king the nature of his dream and its
interpretation, and yet to put in something else. But, as he will add
nothing out of place, we ought not to question the propriety of his
saying, this was the king’s vision and his dream; for his object was to
rouse the king the more urgently to attend to both the dream and its
interpretation. Here we must; take notice how the Prophet persists in
this, with the view of persuading the king that God was the author of
the dream about. which he inquired of Daniel; for the words would be
entirely thrown away unless men were thoroughly persuaded that the
explanation given proceeded from God. For many in the present day will
hear willingly enough what may be said about the Gospel, but they are
not inwardly touched by it, and then all they hear vanishes away and
immediately escapes them. Hence reverence is the principle of true and
solid understanding. Thus Daniel does not abruptly bring forward either
the explanation or the narration of the dream, but prepares the proud
king to listen, by shewing him that he neither dreamt at, random nor in
accordance with his own thoughts, but was divinely instructed and
admonished concerning hidden events. It now follows,-

<span id="viii.xxx"></span>

<span id="viii.xxx-p1"></span><span id="viii.xxx-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:29](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#029.md)<span id="viii.xxx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxx-p2"></span>**29.** As for thee, O king, thy thoughts
came *into thy mind* upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter:
and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to
pass.

<span id="viii.xxx-p3"></span>**29.** Tibi, rex, cogitationes tuae super
lectum tuum ascenderunt, quid futurum esset posthac; et qui revelat
arcana exposuit tibi quid futurum esset.

<span id="viii.xxx-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxx-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxx-p6"></span>He again confirms what I have just touched
upon, for he wished to impress this upon the king’s mind — that God was
the author of the dream, to induce the king to prepare for its
interpretation with becoming sobriety, modesty, and docility. For unless
he had been seriously affected, he would have despised Daniel’s
interpretation; just as we see men fail to profit through their own
pride or carelessness even when God addresses. them familiarly. Hence we
must observe this order, and be fully prepared to listen to God, and
learn to put a bridle upon ourselves on hearing his sacred name, never
rejecting whatever he proposes to us, but treating it with proper
gravity. This is the true reason why Daniel repeats again that King
Nebuchadnezzar was divinely instructed in future events. He says, in the
first clause, *The king’s thoughts ascended,* — *the* phrase is Hebrew
and. Chaldee. Thoughts are said to ascend when they are revolved in the
brain or head, as we formerly saw — this vision was in thy head; since
the seat of the reasoning faculty is in the head. Daniel therefore
asserts the king to be anxious about futurity, as the greatest monarchs
think of what shall happen after their death, and every one dreams about
enjoying the empire of the whole world. So King Nebuchadnezzar was very
probably indulging these thoughts. But it follows immediately, that his
thoughts could non profit him unless God unveiled the future, because it
was his peculiar office, says the Prophet, *to reveal secrets,* Here we
see clearly how vainly men disturb themselves when they turn over and
over again subjects which surpass their abilities. King Nebuchadnezzar
might have fatigued himself for a, long time without profit if he had
not been instructed by the oracle. Hence there is weight in these words
— He *who reveals secrets has explained to the king what shall happen;*
that is, thou canst not understand the dream by thine own thoughts, but
God has deemed thee worthy of this peculiar favor when he wished to make
thee conscious of mysteries which had been otherwise altogether hidden
from thee, for thou couldst never have penetrated to such a depth.

<span id="viii.xxx-p7"></span>He afterwards adds —

<span id="viii.xxxi"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxi-p1"></span><span id="viii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:30](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#030.md)<span id="viii.xxxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxi-p2"></span>**30.** But as for me, this secret is not
revealed to me for *any* wisdom that I have more than any living, but
for *their* sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king,
and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.

<span id="viii.xxxi-p3"></span>**30.** Et ego,  <span
id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) non in sapientia quae sit in me prae
cunctis viventibus, arcanum hoc patefactum *est* mihi;  <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) sed ut interpretationem regi
exponerem, et cogitationes cordis tui cognosceres.

<span id="viii.xxxi-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxxi-p7"></span><span id="viii.xxxi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxi-p8"></span>Here Daniel meets an objection which
Nebuchadnezzar might make, — If God alone can reveal secrets, how, I
pray thee, canst thou, a mere mortal, do it? Daniel anticipates this,
and transfers the whole glory to God, and ingenuously confesses that he
has no interpretation of his own to offer, but represents himself as led
forward by God’s hand to be its interpreter; and as having nothing by
his own natural talents, but acting as God pleased to appoint him his
servant for this office, and-as using his assistance. *This secret,*
then, says he, *has been made known to me* By these words he
sufficiently declares, how his undertaking to interpret the dream was
God’s peculiar gift. But he more clearly expresses this gift to be
supernatural, as it is called, by saying, *not in the wisdom which
belongs to me* For if Daniel had surpassed the whole world in
intelligence, yet he could never divine what; the king of Babylon had
dreamt! He excelled, indeed, in superior abilities and learning, and was
endowed, as we have said, with remarkable gifts; yet; he could never
have obtained this power which he acquired from God through prayer, (I
repeat it; again,) through his own study or industry, or any human
exertions.

<span id="viii.xxxi-p9"></span>We observe how Daniel here carefully
excludes, not only what men foolishly claim as their own, but; also what
God naturally confers; since we know the profane to be endowed with
singular talents, and other eminent faculties; and these are called
natural, since God desires his gracious gifts to shine forth in the
human race by such examples as these. But while Daniel acknowledges
himself endowed with no common powers, through the good pleasure and
discipline of God, though he confesses this, I say, yet he places this
revelation on a higher footing. We observe also how the gifts of the
Spirit mutually differ, because Daniel acted in a kind of twofold
capacity with regard to the endowments with which it pleased God to
adorn him. First of all, he made rapid progress in all sciences, and
flourished much in intellectual quickness, and we have already clearly
shewn this to be, owing to the mere liberality of God. This liberality
puts all things in their proper order, while it shews God’s singular
favor in the explanation of the dream.

<span id="viii.xxxi-p10"></span>*This secret,* then, *was not made known
to me on account of any wisdom in me beyond the rest of mankind* Daniel
does not affirm himself to be superior to all men in wisdom, as some
falsely twist these words, but he leaves this in doubt by saying, This
ought not to be ascribed to wisdom, for if I were the acutest of all
men, all my shrewdness would avail me nothing and, again, if I were the
rudest idiot, still it is God who uses me as his servant, in
interpreting the dream to you. You must not, therefore, expect anything
human from me, but you must receive what I say to you, because I am the
instrument of God’s Spirit, just as if I had come down from heaven. This
is the simple sense of the words. Hence we may learn to ascribe the
praise to God alone, to whom it is due; for it is his peculiar office to
illuminate our minds, so that we may comprehend heavenly mysteries. For
although we are naturally endued with the greatest acuteness, which is
also his gift, yet we may call it a limited endowment, as it does not
reach to the heavens. Let us learn, then, to leave his own to God, as we
are admonished by this expression of Daniel.

<span id="viii.xxxi-p11"></span>He afterwards adds, *But that I may make
known to the king the interpretation, and thou mayest know the thoughts
of thy heart* Daniel uses the plural number, but indefinitely; as if he
had said, God has left thee indeed hitherto in suspense; but yet he did
not inspire thee with this dream in vain. These flyings, therefore, are
mutually united, namely, — God has revealed to thee this secret, and has
appointed me his interpreter. Thus we perceive Daniel’s meaning. For
Nebuchadnezzar might object, Why does God torment me thus? What is the
meaning of my perplexity; — first I dream, and then my dream escapes me,
and its interpretation is unknown to me? Lest, therefore, Nebuchadnezzar
should thus argue with God, Daniel here anticipates him, and shows how
neither the dream nor the vision occurred in vain; but God now grants
what was there wanting, namely, the return of the dream to
Nebuchadnezzar’s memory, and at the same time his acknowledgment of its
purport, and the reason of its being sent to him.

<span id="viii.xxxii"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxii-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="viii.xxxii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since thou desirest
us to differ from the brutes, and hence didst impress our minds with the
light of intellect, — Grant, I pray thee, that we may learn to
acknowledge and to magnify this singular favor, and may we exercise
ourselves in the knowledge of those things which induce us to reverence
thy sovereignty. Besides this, may we distinguish between that common
sense which thou hast bestowed upon us, and the illumination of thy
Spirit, and the gift of faith, that thou alone mayest be glorified by
our being grafted by faith into the body of thine only-begotten Son. We
entreat also from thee further progress and increase of the same faith,
until at length thou bring us to the full manifestation of light. Then,
being like thee, we shall behold thy glory face to face, and enjoy the
same in Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p6"></span>**32.** This image’s head *was* of fine

was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet *that

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p15"></span>**35.** Then was the iron, the clay,
the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and
became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind
carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that
smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p16"></span>**35.** Tunc contrita sunt simul

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p18"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p19"></span><span id="viii.xxxiv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p20"></span>Although Daniel here records the dream,
and does not touch on its interpretation, yet we must not proceed
farther without discoursing on the matter itself. When the
interpretation is afterwards added, we shall confirm what we have
previously said, and amplify as the context may guide us. Here Daniel
records how Nebuchadnezzar saw an image consisting of gold, silver,
brass, and iron, but its feet were mixed, partly of iron and portly of
clay. We have already treated of the name of the “Vision,” but I briefly
repeat again, — king Nebuchadnezzar did not see this image here
mentioned, with his natural eyes, but it was a specimen of the
revelation which he knew with certainty to have been divinely offered to
him. Otherwise, he might have thrown off all care, and acted as he
pleased; but God held him down in complete torment, until Daniel came as
its interpreter.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p21"></span>*Nebuchadnezzar then saw an image.* All
writers endowed with a sound judgment and candidly desirous of
explaining the Prophet’s meaning, understand this, without controversy,
of the Four Monarchies, following each other in succession. The Jews,
when pressed by this interpretation, confuse the Turkish with the Roman
empire, but their ignorance and unfairness is easily proved. For when
they wish to escape the confession of Christ having been exhibited to
the world, they seek stale calumnies which do not require refutation;
but still something must afterwards be said in its proper place. My
assertion is perfectly correct, that interpreters of moderate judgment
and candor, all explain the passage of the Babylonian, Persian,
Macedonian, and Roman monarchies, and Daniel himself afterwards shews
this sufficiently by his own words. A question, however, arises, why God
represented these four monarchies under this image? for it does not seem
to correspond throughout, as the Romans had nothing in common with the
Assyrians. History has fully informed us how the Medes and Persians
succeeded the Chaldeans; how Babylon was besieged by the enemy; and how
Cyrus, after obtaining the victory, transferred the empire to the Medes
and Persians. It may, perhaps, seem absurd that one image only should be
proposed. But it is probable — nay, it may be shewn — that God does not
here regard any agreement between these four monarchies, for there was
none at all, but the state of the world at large. God therefore wished,
under this figure, to represent the future condition of the world till
the advent of Christ. This is the reason why God joined these four
empires together, although actually different; since the second sprang
from the destruction of the first, and the third from that of the
second. This is one point, and we may now inquire, secondly, why Daniel
calls the kingdom of Babylon by the honorable term *golden.* For we know
the extent of its tyranny and the character of the Assyrians, and their
union with the Chaldeans. We are also aware of the destruction of
Nineveh, and how the Chaldeans made Babylon their capital city, to
preserve the seat of empire among themselves. If we consider the origin
of that monarchy, we shall surely find the Assyrians like savage beasts,
full of avarice, cruelty, and rapacity, and the Chaldeans superior to
all these vices. Why, then, is that empire called *the head* — and why a
*golden head?*

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p22"></span>As to the name, “head,” since that
monarchy arose first, there is nothing surprising in Daniel’s assigning
the highest place to it. And as to his passing by Nineveh, this is not
surprising, because that city had been already cut off, and he is now
treating of future events. The Chaldean empire, then, was first in the
order of time, and is called “golden” by comparison; because the world
grows worse as it becomes older; for the Persians and Medes who seized
upon the whole East under the auspices of Cyrus, were worse than the
Assyrians and Chaldeans. So profane poets invented fables about *The
Four Ages,* the Golden, Silver, Brazen, and Iron. They do not mention
the clay, but without doubt they received this tradition from Daniel. If
any one object, that Cyrus excelled in the noblest qualities, and was of
a heroic disposition, and celebrated by historians for his prudence and
perseverance, and other endowments, I reply, we must not look here at
the character of any one man, but at the continued state of the Persian
empire. This is sufficiently probable on comparing the empire of the
Medes and Persians with that of the Babylonians, which is called
“silver;” since their morals were deteriorated, as we have already said.
Experience also demonstrates how the world always degenerates, and
inclines by degrees to vices and corruptions.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p23"></span>Then as to the Macedonian empire, it
ought not to seem absurd to find it compared to brass, since we know the
cruelty of Alexander’s disposition. It is frivolous to notice that
politeness which has gained him favor with historians; since, if we
reflect upon his natural character, he surely breathed cruelty from his
very boyhood. Do we not discern in him, when quite a boy, envy and
emulation? When he saw his father victorious in war, and subduing by
industry or depraved arts the cities of Greece, he wept with envy,
because his father left him nothing to conquer. As he manifested such
pride when a boy, we conclude him to have been more cruel than humane.
And with what purpose and intention did he undertake the expedition by
which he became king of kings, unless through being discontented not
only with his own power, but with the possession of the whole worm? We
know also how tie wept when he heard from that imaginative philosophy,
that there were more worlds than this. “What*,*” said he, “I do not
possess even one world!” Since, then, one world did not suffice for a
man who was small of stature, he must indeed put off all humanity, as he
really appeared to do. He never spared the blood of any one; and
wherever he burst forth, like a devouring tempest, he *destroyed*
everything. Besides, what is here said of that monarchy ought not to be
restricted to the person of Alexander, who was its chief and author, but
is extended to all his successors. We know that they committed horrible
cruelties, for before his empire was divided into four parts,
constituting the kingdoms of Asia, Syria, Egypt, and Macedonia, how much
blood was sited! God took away from Alexander all his offspring. He
might have lived at home and begotten children, and thus his memory
would have been noble and celebrated among all posterity; but God
exterminated all his family from the world. His mother perished by the
sword at the age of eighty years; also his wife and sons, as well as a
brother of unsound mind. Finally, it was a horrible proof of God’s anger
against Alexander’s offspring, for the purpose of impressing all ages
with a sense of his displeasure at such cruelty. If then we extend the
Macedonian empire to the period when Perseus was conquered, and
Cleopatra and Ptolemy slain in Egypt., and Syria, Asia, and Egypt
reduced under the sway of Rome — if we comprehend the whole of this
period, we shall not wonder at the prophet Daniel calling the monarchy
“brazen.”

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p24"></span>When he speaks of The Roman Empire as
“iron,” we must always remember the reason I have noticed, which has
reference to the world in general, and to the depraved nature of
mankind; whence their vices and immoralities always increase till they
arrive at a fearful height. If we consider how the Romans conducted
themselves, and how cruelly they tyrannized over others, the reason why
their dominion is called “*iron*” by Daniel will immediately appear.
Although they appear to have possessed some skill in political affairs,
we are acquainted with their ambition, avarice, and cruelty. Scarcely
any nation can be found which suffered like the Romans under those three
diseases, and since they were so subject to these, as well as to others,
it is not surprising that the Prophet detracts from their fame and
prefers the Macedonians, Persians, Medes, and even Assyrians and
Chaldeans to them.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p25"></span><span id="viii.xxxiv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p26"></span>When he says, *the feet of the image
were partly of iron and partly of clay,* this ought to be referred to
the ruin which occurred, when God dispersed and cut in pieces, so to
speak, that monarchy. The Chaldean power fell first; then the
Macedonians, after subduing the East, became the sole monarchs to whom
the Medes and Persians were subservient. The same event happened to the
Macedonians, who were at length subdued by the, Romans; and all their
kings who succeeded Alexander were cut off. But there was another reason
why God wished to overthrow the Roman monarchy. For it fell by itself
according to the prediction of this prophecy. Since, then, without any
external force it fell to pieces by itself, it easily appears that it
was broken up by Christ, according to this dream of King Nebuchadnezzar.
It is positively certain, that nothing was ever stable from the
beginning of the world, and the assertion of Paul was always true — the
fashion of this world passeth away. (<span
id="viii.xxxiv-p26.1"></span>[1Co
7:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#031.md)<span
id="viii.xxxiv-p26.1"></span>.) By the word “fashion” he means whatever
is splendent in the world is also shadowy and evanescent, he adds, also,
that all which our eyest gaze upon must vanish away. But, as I have
said, the reason was different when God wished to destroy the empire of
the Chaldees, the Persians, and the Macedonians; because this was more
clearly shewn in the case of the Romans, how Christ by his advent took
away whatever was splendid, and magnificent, and admirable in the world.
This, therefore, is the reason why God assigns specially to the Romans
*feet of clay* Thus much, then, with respect to the four empires.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p27"></span><span id="viii.xxxiv-p27.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p28"></span>In the third place, it may be doubted
why *Christ* is said *to have broken this image from the mountains* For
if Christ is the eternal wisdom of God (<span
id="viii.xxxiv-p28.1"></span>[Pr
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro008.htm#015.md)<span
id="viii.xxxiv-p28.1"></span>) by whom kings reign, this seems scarcely
to accord with it; for how, by his advent, should he break up the
political order which we; know God approves of, and has appointed and
established by his power? I answer, — earthly empires are swallowed and
broken up by Christ accidentally, as they say. (<span
id="viii.xxxiv-p28.2"></span>[Ps
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#009.md)<span
id="viii.xxxiv-p28.2"></span>.) For if kings exercise their office
honestly, clearly enough Christ’s kingdom is not contrary to their
power. Whence, then, does it happen that Christ strikes kings with an
iron scepter*,* and breaks, and ruins, and reduces them to nothing? Just
*because* their pride is untamable, and they raise their heads to
heaven, and wish, if possible, to draw down God from his throne. Hence
they necessarily feel Christ’s hand opposed to them, because they cannot
and will not subject themselves to God.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p29"></span>But another question may be raised: —
When Christ was made manifest, those monarchies had fallen long
previously; for the Chaldean, the Persian, and that of the successors of
Alexander, had passed away. The solution is at hand, if we understand
what I have previously mentioned — that under one image the whole state
of the world is here *depicted* for us. Although all events did not
occur at the same moment, yet we shall find the Prophet’s language
essentially true, that Christ should destroy all monarchies. For when
the seat of the empire of the East was changed, and Nineveh destroyed,
and the Chaldeans had fixed the seat of empire among themselves, this
happened by God’s just judgment, and Christ was already reigning as the
king of the world. That monarchy was really broken up by his power, and
the same may be said of the Persian empire. For when they degenerated
from a life of austerity and sobriety into one of foul and infamous
luxury; when they raged so cruelly against all mankind, and became so
exceedingly rapacious, their empire necessarily passed away from them,
and Alexander executed the judgment of God. The same occurred to
Alexander and his successors. Hence the Prophet means, that before
Christ appeared, he already possessed supreme power, both in heaven and
earth, and thus broke up and annihilated the pride and violence of all
men.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p30"></span>But Daniel says — the image perished
when the Roman empire was broken up, and yet we observe in the East and
the neighboring regions the greatest monarchs still reigning with very
formidable prowess. I reply, we must remember what we said yesterday —
the dream was presented to King Nebuchadnezzar, that he might understand
all future events to the renovation of the world. Hence God was not
willing to instruct the king of Babylon further than to inform him of
the four future monarchies which should possess the whole globe, and
should obscure by their splendor all the powers of the world, and draw
all eyes and all attention to itself; and afterwards Christ should come
and overthrow those monarchies. God, therefore, wished to inform King
Nebuchadnezzar of these events; and here we must notice the intention of
the Holy Spirit. No mention is made of other kingdoms, because they had
not yet emerged into importance sufficient to be compared to these four
monarchies. While the Assyrians and Chaldeans reigned, there was no
rivalry with their neighbors, for the whole of the East obeyed them. It
was incredible that Cyrus, springing from a barbarous region, could so
easily draw to himself such resources, and seize upon so many provinces
in so short a time! For he was like a whirlwind which destroyed the
whole East. The same may be said of the third monarchy; for if the
successors of Alexander had been mutually united, there was then no
empire in the world which could have increased their power. The Romans
were fully occupied in struggling with their neighbors, and were not yet
at rest on their own soil; and afterwards, when Italy, Greece, Asia, and
Egypt were obedient to them, no other empire rivaled their fame; for all
the power and glory of the world was at that period absorbed by their
arms.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p31"></span>We now understand why Daniel mentioned
those four kingdoms, and why he places their close at the advent of
Christ. When I speak of Daniel, this ought to be understood of the
dream; for without doubt God wished to encourage the Jews not to
despair, when first the brightness of the Chaldean monarchy, then that
of the Persian, next the Macedonian, and lastly, the Romans overwhelmed
the world. For what could they have determined by themselves at the time
when Nebuchadnezzar dreamt about the four empires? The kingdom of Israel
was then utterly destroyed, the ten tribes were exiles, the kingdom of
Judah was reduced to desolation. Although the city Jerusalem was yet.
standing, still where was the kingdom? It was full of ignominy and
disgrace; nay, the posterity of David then reigned precariously in the
tribe of Judah, and even there over but a part of it; and afterwards,
although their return was permitted, yet we know how miserably they were
afflicted. And when Alexander, like a tempest, devastated the East, they
suffered, as we know, the greatest distress; they were frequently
ravaged. by his successors; their *city* was reduced almost to solitude,
and the temple profaned; and when their condition was at the best, they
were still tributary, as we, shall afterwards see. It was certainly
necessary for their minds to be supported in so great and such confused
perturbation. This, therefore, was the reason why God sent the, dream
about those monarchies to the king of Babylon. It Daniel had dreamt, the
faithful would not have had so remarkable a subject-matter for the
confirmation of their faith; but when the king’s dream is spread abroad
through almost the whole East, and when its interpretation is equally
celebrated, the Jews might recover their spirits and revive their hopes
at their own time, since they understood from the first that these four
monarchies should not exist by any mere changes of fortune; for the same
God who had foretold to King Nebuchadnezzar future events, determined
also what he should do, and what he wished to take place.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p32"></span>The Jews knew that; the Chaldeans were
reigning only by the decree of heaven; and that another more destructive
empire should afterwards arise; thirdly, that they must undergo a
servitude under the Macedonians; lastly, that the Romans should be the
conquerors and masters of the world — and all this by the decree of
heaven. When they reflected on these things, and finally heard of the
Redeemer, as, according to promise, a perpetual King, and all the
monarchies, then so refulgent, as without any stability-all this would
prove no common source of strength. Now, therefore, we understand with
what intention God wished what had hitherto been hidden, to be
everywhere promulgated; the Jews, too, would hand down to their sons and
grandsons what they had heard from Daniel, and afterwards this
*prophecy* would be extant, and become an admiration to them throughout
all ages.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p33"></span>When we come to the words, he says,
*one image was great and large, its splendor was precious, and its form
terrible* By this phrase, God wished to meet a doubt which might creep
into the minds of the Jews, on perceiving each of those empires
prosperous in its turn. When the Jews, captive and forlorn, saw the
Chaldeans formidable throughout the whole world, and, consequently,
highly esteemed and all but adored by the rest of mankind, what could
they think of it? Why, they would have no hope of return, because God
had raised their enemies to such great power that their avarice and
cruelty were like a deep whirlpool. The Jews might thus conclude
themselves to be drowned in a very deep abyss, whence they could not
hope to escape. But when the empire was transferred to the Medes and
Persians, although they were allowed the liberty of returning, still we
know how small a number used this indulgence, and the rest were
ungrateful. Whether or not this was so, few of the Jews, returned to
their country; and these had to make war upon their neighbors, and were
subject to continual molestation. As far as common sense would guide
them, it was easier for them not to stir a step from Chaldea, Assyria,
and the other parts of the East, since their neighbors in their own
country were all so hostile to them. As long as they were tributary and
esteemed almost as serfs and slaves, and while their condition was so
humiliating, the same temptation remained. For, if they were God’s
people, why did he not care for them so far as to relieve them from that
cruel tyranny? Wily did he not restore them to calmness, and render them
free from such various inconveniences, and from so many injuries? When
the Macedonian. empire succeeded, they were more miserable than before;
they were daily exposed as a prey, and every species of cruelty was
practiced towards them. Then, with regard to the Romans, we know how
proudly they domineered over them. Although Pompey, at his first
assault, did not spoil the temple, yet at length he became bolder, and
Crassus shortly afterwards destroyed everything till the most horrible
and prodigious slaughter followed. As the Jews must suffer these things,
this consolation must, necessarily be offered to them — the Redeemer
shall at length arrive, who shall break up all these empires.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p34"></span>As to Christ being called *the stone
cut out without human, hands,* and being pointed out by other phrases, I
cannot explain them now.

<span id="viii.xxxv"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxv-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="viii.xxxv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since we so travel
through this world that our attention is easily arrested, and our
judgment darkened, when we behold the power of the impious refulgent and
terrible to ourselves and others. Grant, I say, that we may raise our
eyes upwards, and consider how much power thou hast conferred upon thine
only-begotten Son. Grant, also, that he may rule and govern us by the
might of his Spirit, protect us by his faithfulness and guardianship,
and compel the whole world to promote our salvation; thus may we rest
calmly under his protection, and fight with that boldness and patience
which he both commands and commends, until at length we enjoy the fruit
of the victory which thou hast promised, and which thou wilt provide for
us in thy heavenly kingdom. — Amen.

<span id="viii.xxxvi"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p1"></span>Lecture Tenth

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p2"></span>We have already explained God’s
intention in offering to King Nebuchadnezzar the dream concerning the
four monarchies, and the kingdom of Christ which should put an end to
them. We have shewn it to have been not for the king’s sake so much as
for the consolation and support of the remnant of the faithful in those
very severe troubles which awaited them, and were close at hand. For
when redemption had been promised to them, and the Prophets had extolled
that remarkable beneficence of God in magnificent terms, their
confidence might fail them amidst those revolutions which afterwards
followed. For God wished to sustain their spirits, so that amidst such
agitations and tumults they might remain constant, and patiently and
quietly wait; for the promised Redeemer. Meanwhile God wished to render
all the Chaldeans without excuse, because this dream of the king’s was
everywhere celebrated, and yet, none of them profited by it, as far as
Christ’s eternal reign is concerned. But this was the principal point in
the dream, as we shall afterwards see. But God wished, in the first
place, to consult the interests of his elect, lest they should despond
among those so-called revolutions, which might seem contrary to those
numerous prophecies, by which not merely simple liberty was promised,
but perpetual and continued happiness under God’s hand. We now
understand the end which God intended by this dream. We must now treat
its explanation. We have already touched upon some points, but Daniel
himself shall lead the way along which we are to proceed. First of all
he says-

<span id="viii.xxxvii"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:36-38](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#036.md)<span
id="viii.xxxvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxvii-p2"></span>**36.** This *is* the dream; and we
will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.

<span id="viii.xxxvii-p3"></span>**36.** Hoc est somnium; et
interpretationem ejus dicemus coram rege.

<span id="viii.xxxvii-p4"></span>**37.** Thou, O king, *art* a king of
kings: for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and
strength, and glory.

<span id="viii.xxxvii-p5"></span>**37.** Tu rex, rex regum *es*, cui
Deus coelorum regnum, potentiam et robur dedit, et  <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) gloriam tibi.  <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md)

<span id="viii.xxxvii-p8"></span>**38.** And wheresoever the children of
men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he
given into thine hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou
*art* this head of gold.

<span id="viii.xxxvii-p9"></span>**38.** Et ubicunque habitant filii
hominum, bestia agri, et volucris coelorum,  <span
id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) dedit in manum tuam, et praefecit to
omnibus  <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) tu ipse caput *es*
aureum.

<span id="viii.xxxvii-p12"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxxvii-p13"></span><span id="viii.xxxvii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxvii-p14"></span>Daniel here declares “the golden head
of the image“ to be the Babylonian kingdom. We know that the Assyrians
were subdued before the monarchy was transferred to Babylon; but since
they did not prevail sufficiently to be considered as supreme rulers in
that eastern territory, the Babylonian empire is here mentioned first.
It is also worthwhile to remark, that God was unwilling to refer here to
what had already occurred, but he rather proposed that the people should
in future depend on this prophecy and rest upon it. Here it would have
been superfluous to say anything about the Assyrians, since that empire
had already passed away. But the Chaldeans were still to reign for some
time — say seventy or at least sixty years. Hence God wished to hold the
minds of his own servants in suspense till the end of that monarchy, and
then to arouse them by fresh hopes, until the second monarchy should
pass away, so that afterwards they might rest in patience under the
third and fourth monarchies, and might perceive at length the time of
Christ’s advent to be at hand. This is the reason why Daniel places the
Chaldean monarchy here in the first rank and order. And in this matter
there is no difficulty, because he states King Nebuchadnezzar to be the
golden head of the image. We may gather the reason of his being called
*the golden head* from the context, namely, because its integrity was
then greater than under the empire of the Medes and Persians. It is very
true that the Chaldeans were the most cruel robbers, and we know how
Babylon was then detested by all the pious and sincere worshippers of
God. Still, since things usually become worse by process of time, the
state of the world was; as yet tolerable under that sovereignty. This is
the reason why Nebuchadnezzar is called “the head of gold;” but this
ought not to be referred to him personally, but rather extended to his
whole kingdom, and all his successors, among whom Belshazzar was the
most hateful despiser of God; and by comprehension he is said to form
part of this head of gold. But Daniel shews that he did not flatter the
king, since he assigns this reason for Nebuchadnezzar being the golden
head — God had set him up above all the earth. But this seems to be
common to all kings, since none of them reign without God’s permission —
a sentiment which is partially true, but the Prophet implies that
Nebuchadnezzar was raised up in an especial manner, because he excelled
all other sovereigns. It now follows —

<span id="viii.xxxviii"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxviii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:39](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#039.md)<span
id="viii.xxxviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxviii-p2"></span>**39.** And after thee shall arise
another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass,
which shall bear rule over all the earth.

<span id="viii.xxxviii-p3"></span>**39.** Et post to exsurget regnum
aliud inferius te,  <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) et regnum
tertium aliud quod *erit* aeneum, et dominabitur in tota terra.

<span id="viii.xxxviii-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxxviii-p6"></span><span id="viii.xxxviii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxviii-p7"></span>In this verse Daniel embraces the
Second and Third Monarchies. He says the second should be inferior to
the Chaldean in neither power nor wealth; for the Chaldean empire,
although it spread so far and so wide, was added to that of the Medes
and Persians. Cyrus subdued the Medes first; and although he made his
father-in-law, Cyaxares, his ally in the sovereignty, yet he had
expelled his maternal grandfather, and thus obtained peaceable
possession of the kingdom throughout all Media. Then he afterwards
conquered the Chaldeans and Assyrians, as well as the Lydians and the
rest of the nations of Asia Minor. We see then that his kingdom is not
called inferior through having less splendor or opulence in human
estimation, but because the general condition of the world was worse
under the second monarchy, as men’s vices and corruptions increase more
and more. Cyrus was, it is true, a prudent prince, but yet sanguinary.
Ambition and avarice carried him fiercely onwards, and he wandered in
every direction, like a wild beast, forgetful of all humanity. And if we
scan his disposition accurately, we shall discover it to be, as Isaiah
says, very greedy of human blood. (<span
id="viii.xxxviii-p7.1"></span>[Isa
13:18](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#018.md)<span
id="viii.xxxviii-p7.1"></span>.) And here we may remark, that he does
not treat only of the persons of kings, but of their counselors and of
the whole people. Hence Daniel deservedly pronounces the second state of
the kingdom inferior to the first; not because Nebuchadnezzar excelled
in dignity, or wealth, or power, but because the world had not
degenerated so much as it afterwards did. For the more these monarchies
extend themselves, the more licentiousness increases in the world,
according to the teaching of experience. Whence the folly and madness of
those who desire to have kings very powerful is apparent, just as if any
one should desire a river to be most rapid, as Isaiah says when
combating this folly. (<span id="viii.xxxviii-p7.2"></span>[Isa
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#007.md)<span
id="viii.xxxviii-p7.2"></span>.) For the swifter, the deeper, and the
wider a river flows on, the greater the destruction of its overflow to
the whole neighborhood. Hence the insanity of those who desire the
greatest monarchies, because some things will by positive necessity
occur out of lawful order. when one man occupies so broad a space; and
this did *occur* under the sway of the Medes and Persians.

<span id="viii.xxxviii-p8"></span>The description of the Third Monarchy
now follows. It is called *brazen,* not so much from its hardness as
from its being worse than the second. The Prophet teaches how the
difference between the second and third monarchies is similar to that
between silver and brass. The rabbis confound the two monarchies,
through their desire to comprehend under the second what they call the
kingdom of the Greeks; but they display the grossest ignorance and
dishonesty. For they do not err, through simple ignorance, but they
purposely desire to overthrow what Scripture here states clearly
concerning the advent of Christ. Hence they are not ashamed to mingle
and confuse history, and to pronounce *carelessly* on subjects unknown
to them — unknown, I say, not because they escape men moderately versed
hi history, but through their being brutal themselves, and discerning
nothing. For instead of Alexander the son of Philip, they put Alexander
the son of Mammea, who possessed the Roman empire, when half its
provinces had been already separated from it. He was a spiritless boy,
and was slain in his tent with the greatest ignominy by his own
soldiers; besides that, he never really governed, but lived as a minor
under the sway of his mother. And yet the Jews are not ashamed to
distort and twist what relates to the king of Macedon to this Alexander
the son of Mammea. But their wickedness and ignorance is easily refuted
by the context, as we shall afterwards see. Here Daniel states shortly
that there shall be a third monarchy, he does not describe its
character, nor explain it fully; but we shall see in another place the
meaning of his prophecy. He now interprets the dream of the king of
Babylon, as the vision of the four empires had been offered to him. But
the angel afterwards confirms the same to him by a vision, and very
clearly, too, as will be seen in its own place. Without doubt this
narrative of the brazen image relates to the Macedonian kingdom. How,
then, is all doubt removed? By the description of the fourth empire,
which is much fuller, and clearly indicates what we shall soon see, that
the Roman empire was like the feet, partly of clay and partly of iron.
He says, therefore, —

<span id="viii.xxxix"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxix-p1"></span><span

<span id="viii.xxxix-p2"></span>**40.** And the fourth kingdom shall be
strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all
*things;* and as iron that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces
and bruise.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p3"></span>**40.** Et regnum quartum erit robustum

and toes, part of potters’ clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be
divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch
as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p8"></span>**42.** And *as* the toes of the feet

strong, and partly broken.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p15"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxxix-p16"></span><span id="viii.xxxix-p16.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxix-p17"></span>Here the Fourth Empire is described,
which agrees only with the Roman, for we know that the four successors
of Alexander were at length subdued. Philip was the first king of
Macedon, and Antiochus the second; but yet Philip lost nothing from his
own kingdom; he only yielded it to the free cities of Greece. It was,
therefore, hitherto, entire, except as it paid tribute to the Romans for
some years on account of the expenses of the war. Antiochus, also, when
*compelled* to adopt the conditions imposed by the conqueror, was driven
beyond Mount Taurus; but Macedonia was reduced to a province when
Perseus was overcome and captured. The kings of Syria and Asia suffered
in the same way; and, lastly, Egypt was seized upon by Augustus. For
their posterity had reigned up to that period, and Cleopatra was the
last of that race, as is *sufficiently* known. When, therefore, the
three monarchies were absorbed by the Romans, the language of the
Prophet suits them well enough; for, as the sword diminishes, and
destroys, and ruins all things, thus those three monarchies were bruised
and broken up by the Roman empire. There is nothing surprising in his
here enumerating that popular form of government, among “*monarchies,*”
since we know how few were rulers among this people, and how customary
it was to call every kind of government among them an empire, and the
people themselves the rulers of the whole world! But the Prophet
compares them to “iron,” not only on account of its hardness, although
this reason is clearly expressed, but also through another kind of
similitude, — they were worse than all others, and surpassed in cruelty
and barbarity both the Macedonians. and the Medo-Persians. Although they
boast much in their own prowess, yet if any one exercises a sound
judgment upon their actions, he will discover their tyranny to be far
more cruel than all the rest; although they boast in their senators
being as great as ordinary kings, yet we shall find them no better than
robbers and tyrants, for scarcely one in a hundred of them shewed a
grain of equity, either then sent into any province or when discharging
any magistracy; and with regard to the body of the empire itself, it was
all horrible pollution. This, then, is the reason why the Prophet says
that monarchy was partly composed of iron, and partly of potter’s clay,
since we know how they suffered under intestine disorders. The Prophet
requires no other interpretation here, because, he says, this mixture of
iron and clay, which unites so badly, is a sign of disunion, through
their never mingling together.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p18"></span>*The kingdom,* therefore, *shall be
divided,* and he adds yet another mixture, — *they shall mingle
themselves with the seed of men,* that is., they shall be neighbors to
others, and that mutual interchange which ought to promote true
friendship, shall become utterly profitless. The opinion of those who
introduce the alliance of Pompey and Caesar is farfetched, for the
Prophet is speaking of a continued government. If stability is sought
for in any kind of government, it surely ought to shine forth in a
republic, or at least in an oligarchy in preference to a despotism;
because, when all are slaves, the king cannot so confidently trust his
subjects, through their constant fear for themselves. But when all unite
in the government, and the very lowest receive some mutual advantage
from their commonwealth, then, as I have said, superior stability ought
to be conspicuous. But Daniel pronounces, that even if the superior
power should reside in the senate and the people — for there is dignity
in the senate, and majesty in the people yet that empire should fall.
Besides, although they should be mutually united in neighborhood and
kindred, yet this would not prevent them from contending with each other
with savage enmity, even to the destruction of their empire. Here then
the Prophet furnishes us with a vivid picture of the Roman empire, by
saying *that it was like iron,* and also *mingled with clay,* or mud, as
they destroyed themselves by intestine discord after arriving at the
highest pitch of fortune. Thus far concerning the four monarchies.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p19"></span>We may now inquire why Daniel said,
*The stone which was to be cut out of the mountain should destroy all
these empires;* since it does not appear, at first sight, to suit the
kingdom of Christ. The Babylonian monarchy had been previously abolished
— the Medes and Persians had been utterly prostrated by Alexander — and
after Alexander’s conquests, had been divided into four kingdoms; the
Romans subdued all those lands; and then it is objected that the
Prophet’s language is absurd, *a stone shall come out of a mountain
which shall break up all empires* The solution, as I have said above is
at hand. Daniel does not here state that; the events shall happen
together, but simply wishes to teach how the empires of the world shall
fail, and one kingdom shall be eternal. He does not regard, therefore,
when or why the empire’s of the Chaldees and of the Persians fell, but
he compares the kingdom of Christ with all those monarchies which have
been mentioned. And we must always remember what I have touched upon,
that the Prophet speaks for the captive people, and accommodates his
*style* to the faithful, to whom he wished to stretch forth the hand,
and to strengthen them in those most serious concussions which were at
hand. And hence, when he speaks of all lands and nations, if any one
objects — there were then. other empires in the world, the answer is
easy, the Prophet is not here describing what should happen through all
the ages of the world, but only what the Jews should see. For the Romans
were the lords of many regions before they passed over into Greece; we
know they had two provinces in Spain, and after the close of the second
Punic war were masters of that upper sea, and held undisputed possession
of all the islands, as well as of Cisalpine Gaul and other regions. No
notice is taken of this empire, till it was made known to the Jews, as
they might have given themselves up to, utter despair, when they could
not perceive an end to those storms which almost ruined the world; and,
meanwhile, they were the most miserable of all men, because the various
and continual calamities of the world never ceased. We must remember
this view of things, as otherwise the whole prophecy would be cold and
profitless to us. I now return to the kingdom of Christ.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p20"></span>The Kingdom or Christ is said *to break
up all the empires of the world,* not *directly,* but only accidentally,
as the phrase is. For Daniel here assumes a principle, sufficiently
understood by the Jews; namely, those monarchies were opposed to
Christ’s; kingdom. For the Chaldees had overthrown God’s temple, and had
endeavored as far as possible to extinguish the whole of his worship,
and to exterminate piety from the world. As far as concerns the Medes
and Persians, although by their kindness a permission to return was
granted to the people, yet very soon afterwards the kings of the Medes
and Persians raged against that most miserable people, until the greater
part of them preferred remaining; in exile to returning home. At length
came the Macedonian fury; and although the Jews were spared for a short
period, we know how impetuously the kings of Syria and Egypt overran
Judea, how cruelly they treated the wretched people by rapine and
plunder, and the shedding of innocent blood. Again, the extreme
barbarity of Antiochus in ordering all the Prophetic Books to be burned,
and in all but exterminating the religion itself (<span
id="viii.xxxix-p20.1"></span>[1 Maccabees
1:59](../../../bib/apo/ma1001.htm#059.md)<span
id="viii.xxxix-p20.1"></span>) is well ascertained.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p21"></span>No wonder, then, that Daniel here
opposes the reign of Christ to such monarchies! Next, as to the Romans,
we know how thoroughly and proudly they despised the name of
“Christian!” nay, they endeavored by all means to root out from the
world the Gospel and the doctrine of salvation, as an abominable thing.
With all this we are familiar. Hence, to inform the faithful of their
future condition until Christ’s advent, Daniel shews how all the empires
of the world should be adverse to God, and all its most powerful kings
and sovereigns should be his very worst and most cruel enemies, and
should use every means in their power to extinguish true piety. Thus he
exhorts them to bear their cross, and never to yield to those wretched
and sorrowful spectacles, but to proceed steadily in the course of their
calling, until the promised Redeemer should appear. We stated this to be
“accidental,” since all the kingdoms of this world are clearly founded
on the power and beneficence of Christ; but a memorable proof of God’s
anger ought to exist against them all, because they raised themselves
against the Son of God, the Supreme King, with such extreme fury and
hostility.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p22"></span>Now, Christ is compared *to a stone cut
out of a mountain* Some restrict this, unnecessarily, to the generation
of Christ, because he was born of a virgin, out of the usual course of
nature. Hence he says, as we have seen, *that it was cut out of a
mountain without the hand of man;* that is, he was divinely sent, and
his empire was separated from all earthly ones, since it was divine and
heavenly. Now, therefore, we understand the reason of this simile.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p23"></span>With respect to the word “*stone,*”
Christ is not here called *a stone* in the sense of the word in <span
id="viii.xxxix-p23.1"></span>[Ps
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md)<span
id="viii.xxxix-p23.1"></span>, and <span
id="viii.xxxix-p23.2"></span>[Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md)<span
id="viii.xxxix-p23.2"></span>, and <span
id="viii.xxxix-p23.3"></span>[Zec
9:15](../../../bib/kjv/zac009.htm#015.md)<span
id="viii.xxxix-p23.3"></span>, and elsewhere. For there the name of a
stone is applied to Christ, because his Church is founded on it. The
perpetuity of his kingdom is denoted there as well as here; but, as I
have already said, these phrases ought to be distinguished. It must now
be added, — Christ is called a stone cut out without human hands,
because he was from the beginning almost without form and comeliness, as
far as human appearance goes. There is also a silent contrast between
its magnitude, which the Prophet will soon mention, and this
commencement. *The stone cut out of the mountain shall descend, and it
shall become a great mountain, and shall fill the whole earth.* We see
how the Prophet here predicts the beginning of Christ’s Kingdom, as
contemptible and abject before the world. It was not conspicuous for
excellence, as it is said in Isaiah, A branch is sprung from the root of
Jesse. (<span id="viii.xxxix-p23.4"></span>[Isa
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001.md)<span
id="viii.xxxix-p23.4"></span>.) When the posterity of David were
deprived of all dignity, the royal name was utterly buried, and the
diadem trodden under foot, as it is said in Ezekiel (<span
id="viii.xxxix-p23.5"></span>[Eze
17:19](../../../bib/kjv/eze017.htm#019.md)<span
id="viii.xxxix-p23.5"></span>.) Hence, Christ first appeared cast down
and lowly; but the branch increased wonderfully and beyond all
expectation and calculation, unto an immense size, till it filled the
whole earth. We now perceive how appositely Daniel speaks of Christ’s
kingdom but we must treat the rest to-morrow.

<span id="viii.xl"></span>

<span id="viii.xl-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="viii.xl-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that we may remember
ourselves to be pilgrims in the world, and that no splendor of wealth,
or power, or worldly wisdom may blind our eyes, but may we always direct
our eyes and all our senses towards the kingdom of thy Son. May we
always fix them there, and may nothing hinder us from hastening on in
the course of our calling, until at length we pass over the course and
reach the goal which thou hast set before us, and to which thou dost
this day invite us by the heralding of thy gospel. Do thou at length
gather us unto that happy eternity which has been obtained for us
through the blood of the same, thy Son. May we never be separated from
him, but, being sustained by his power, may we at last be raised by him
to the highest heavens. — Amen.

<span id="viii.xli"></span>

<span id="viii.xli-p1"></span>Lecture Eleventh

<span id="viii.xli-p2"></span>WE must now explain more clearly what we
yesterday stated concerning the eternal kingdom of Christ. In relating
the dream, the Prophet *said* — *The stone cut out of the mountain
without hands is the fifth kingdom,* by which the four kingdoms were to
be broken up and destroyed, according to the vision shewn to King
Nebuchadnezzar. We must now see whether or not this is the kingdom of
Christ. The Prophet’s words are these:

<span id="viii.xlii"></span>

<span id="viii.xlii-p1"></span><span id="viii.xlii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:44-45](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#044.md)<span
id="viii.xlii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlii-p2"></span>**44.** And in the days of these kings
shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be
destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, *but* it
shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand
for ever.

<span id="viii.xlii-p3"></span>**44.** Et in diebus illis regum illorum
suscitabit Deus coelorum regnum, quod in seculum non dissipabitur,
 <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) et regnum *hoe* populo alieno
non derelinquetur confringet et conteret omnia illa regna, et ipsum
stabit perpetuo.

<span id="viii.xlii-p5"></span>**45.** Forasmuch as thou sawest that the
stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in
pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the
great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter:
and the dream *is* certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.

<span id="viii.xlii-p6"></span>**45.** Propterea vidisti, nempe e monte
excisum lapidem et absque manu, qui confregit  <span
id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) ferrum, aes, testam, argentum et
aurum, Deus magnus patefecit regi quid futurum esset postero tempore, et
verum est somnium, et fidelis interpretatio ejus.

<span id="viii.xlii-p8"></span> 

<span id="viii.xlii-p9"></span><span id="viii.xlii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlii-p10"></span>The Jews agree with us in thinking this
passage cannot be otherwise understood than of the perpetual reign of
Christ, and willingly and eagerly ascribe to the glory of their own
nation whatever is written everywhere throughout the Scriptures; nay,
they often cry down many testimonies of Scripture for the purpose of
boasting in their own privileges. They do not therefore deny the dream
to have been sent to King Nebuchadnezzar concerning Christ’s kingdom;
but they differ from us, in expecting a Christ of their own. Hence they
are, compelled in many ways to corrupt this prophecy; because, if they
grant that the fourth empire or monarchy was accomplished in the Romans,
they must necessarily acquiesce in the Gospel, which testifies of the
arrival of that Messiah who was promised in the Law. For Daniel here
openly affirms that Messiah’s kingdom should arrive at the close of the
fourth monarchy. Hence they fly to the miserable refuge that by the
fourth monarchy should be understood the Turkish empire, which they call
that of the Ishmaelites; and thus they confound the Roman with the
Macedonian empire. But what pretense have they for making only one
empire out of two such different ones? They say the Romans sprang from
the Greeks; and if we grant this, whence did the Greeks spring? Did they
not arise from the Caspian Mountains and Higher Asia? The Romans
referred their origin to Troy, and at the time when the prophecy ought
to be fulfilled, this had become utterly obscure — but what is this to
the purpose when they had no reputation for a thousand years afterwards?
But the Turks a long time afterwards, namely 600 years, suddenly burst
forth like a deluge. In such a variety of circumstances, and at such a
distance of time, how can they form one single kingdom? Then they shew
no difference between themselves and the rest of the nations. For they
recall us to the beginning of the world, and in this way make one
kingdom out of two, and this mixture is altogether without reason, or
any pretension to it. There is no doubt then, that Daniel intended the
Romans by the fourth empire, since we yesterday saw, how in a manner
contrary to nature, that empire ultimately perished by intestine
discord. No single monarch reigned there, but only a democracy. All
thought themselves to be equally kings, for they were all related. This;
union ought to have been the firmest bond of perpetuity. But Daniel here
witnesses beforehand, how, even if they were intimately related, that
kingdom would not be social, but would perish by its own dissension’s.
Finally, it is now sufficiently apparent that the Prophet’s words cannot
be otherwise explained than of the Roman empire, nor can they be drawn
aside, except by violence, to the Turkish empire.

<span id="viii.xlii-p11"></span>I shall now relate what our brother
Anthony has suggested to me, from a certain Rabbi Barbinel,  <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) who seems to excel others in
acuteness. He endeavors to shew by six principal arguments, that the
fifth kingdom cannot relate to our Christ — Jesus, the son of Mary. He
*first* assumes this principle, since the four kingdoms were earthly,
the fifth cannot be compared with them, except its nature is the same.
The comparison would be, he says, both inappropriate and absurd. As if
Scripture does not always compare the celestial kingdom of God with
those of earth! for it is neither necessary nor important for all points
of a comparison to be precisely similar. Although God shewed to the king
of Babylon the four earthly monarchies, it does not follow that the
nature of the fifth was the same, since it might be very different. Nay,
if we weigh all things rightly, it is necessary to mark some difference
between those four and this. last one. The reasoning, therefore, of that
rabbi is frivolous, when he infers that Christ’s kingdom ought to be
visible, since it could not otherwise correspond with the other
kingdoms. The *second* reason, by which he opposes us, is this, — if
religion makes the difference between kingdoms, it follows that the
Babylonian, and Persian, and Macedonian are all the same; for we know
that all those nations worshipped idols, and were devoted to
superstition! The answer to so weak an argument is easy enough, namely,
these four kingdoms did not differ simply in religion, but God deprived
the Babylonians of their power, and transfer-red the monarchy to the
Medes and Persians; and by the same providence of God the Macedonians
succeeded them; and then, when all these kingdoms were abolished, the
Romans possessed the sway over the whole East. We have already explained
the Prophet’s meaning. He wished simply to teach the Jews this, — they
were not to despair through beholding the various agitation’s of the
world, and its surprising and dreadful confusion; although those ages
were subject to many changes, the promised king should at length arrive.
Hence the Prophet wished to exhort the Jews to patience, and to hold
them in suspense by the expectation of the Messiah. He does not
distinguish these four monarchies through diversity of religion, but
because God was turning the, world round like a wheel while one nation
was expelling another, so that the Jews might apply all their minds and
attention to that hope of redemption which had been promised through
Messiah’s advent.

<span id="viii.xlii-p13"></span>The *third* argument which that rabbi
brings forward may be refitted without the slightest trouble. He gathers
from the words of the Prophet that the kingdom of our Christ, the son of
Mary, cannot be the kingdom of which Daniel! speaks, since it is here
clearly expressed that there should be no passing away or change of this
kingdom, *it shall not pass on to another* or a strange *people.* But
the Turks, says he, occupy a large portion of the world, and religion
among Christians is divided, and many reject the doctrine of the Gospel.
It follows, then, that Jesus, the son of Mary, is not, that king of whom
Daniel prophesied — that is, about whom the dream which Daniel explained
occurred to the king of Babylon. But he trifles very foolishly, because
he assumes, what. we shall ever deny — that Christ’s kingdom is visible.
For however the sons of God are dispersed, without any reputation among
men, it is quite clear that Christ’s kingdom remains safe and sure,
since hi its own nature it is not outward but invisible. Christ did not
utter these words in vain, “My kingdom is not of this world.” (<span
id="viii.xlii-p13.1"></span>[Joh
18:36](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#036.md)<span
id="viii.xlii-p13.1"></span>.) By this expression he wished to remove
his kingdom from the ordinary forms of government. Although, therefore,
the Turks have spread far and wide, and the world is filled with impious
despisers. of God, and the Jews yet occupy a part of it, still Christ,
kingdom exists and has not been transferred to any others. Hence this
reasoning is not only weak but puerile.

<span id="viii.xlii-p14"></span>*A fourth* argument follows: — It seems
very absurd that Christ, who was born under Octavius or Augustus Caesar,
should be the king of whom Daniel prophesied. For, says he, the
beginning of the fourth and fifth monarchy was the same, which is
absurd; for the fourth monarchy ought to endure for some time, and then
the fifth should succeed it. But here he not only betrays his ignorance,
but his utter stupidity, since God so blinded the whole people that they
were like restive dogs. I have had much conversation with many Jews- I
have never seen either a drop of piety or a grain of truth or
ingenuousness — nay, I have never found common sense in any Jew. But
this fellow, who seems so sharp and ingenious, displays his own
impudence to his great disgrace. For he thought the Roman monarchy began
with Julius Caesar! as if the Macedonian empire was not abolished when
the Romans took possession of Macedon and reduced it to a province, when
also Antiochus was reduced into order by them — nay, when the third
monarchy, namely, the Macedonian, began to decline, then the fourth,
which is the Roman, succeeded it. Reason itself dictates to us to reckon
hi this way, since unless we confess the fourth monarchy to have
succeeded directly on the passing away of the third, how could the rest
follow on? We must observe, also, that the Prophet does not look to the
Caesars when he treats of these monarchies; nay, as we saw concerning
the mingling of races, this cannot in any way suit the Caesars; for we
shewed yesterday how those who restrict this passage to Pompey and
Caesar are only trifling, and are utterly without judgment in this
respect. For the Prophet speaks generally and continuously of a popular
state, since they *were,* all mutually related, and yet the empire was
not stable, through their consuming themselves internally by intestine
warfare. Since this is the case, we conclude this rabbi to be very
foolish and palpably absurd in asserting the Christ not to be the son of
Mary who was born under Augustus, although I do not argue for the
kingdom of Christ commencing at his nativity.

<span id="viii.xlii-p15"></span>His *fifth* argument is this: —
Constantine and other Caesars professed the faith of Christ. If we
receive, says he, Jesus the son of Mary as the fifth king, how will this
suit? as the Roman Empire was still in existence under this king. For
where rite religion of Christ flourishes, where he is worshipped and
acknowledged as the only King, that kingdom ought not to be separated
from his. When therefore Christ, under Constantine and his successors,
obtained both glory and power among the Romans, his monarchy cannot be
separated from theirs. But the solution of this is easy, as the Prophet
here puts an end to the Roman Empire when it began to be torn in pieces.
As to the time when Christ’s reign began, I have just said it ought not
to be referred to the time of his birth, but to the preaching of the
Gospel. From the time when the Gospel began to be promulgated, we know
the Roman monarchy to have been dissipated and at length to vanish away.
Hence the empire did not endure through Constantine or other emperors,
since their state was different; and we know that neither Constantine
nor the other Caesars were Romans. From the time of Trojan the empire
began to be transferred to strangers, and foreigners reigned at Rome. We
also know by what monsters God destroyed the ancient glory  <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) of the Roman people! — for nothing
could be more abandoned or disgraceful than the conduct of many of the
emperors. If any one will but run through their histories, he will
discover immediately that no other people ever had such monsters for
rulers as the Romans under Heliogabalus and others like him, — I omit
Nero and Caligula, and speak only of foreigners. The Roman Empire was
therefore abolished after the Gospel began to be promulgated and Christ
became generally known throughout the world. Thus we observe the same
ignorance in this argument of the rabbi as in the others.

<span id="viii.xlii-p17"></span>The *last* assertion is, — The Roman
empire as yet partially survives, hence what is here said of the fifth
monarchy cannot belong to the son of Mary; it is necessary for the
fourth empire to be at an end, if the fifth king began to reign when
Christ rose from the dead and was preached in the world. I reply, as I
have said already, the Roman empire ceased, and was abolished when God
transferred their whole power with shame and reproach to foreigners, who
were not only barbarians, but horrible monsters! It would have been
better for the Romans to suffer the utter blotting out of their name,
rather than submit to such disgrace. *We* perceive how this sixth and
last reason vanishes away. I wished to collect them together, to shew
you how foolishly those Jewish reasoners make war with God, and
furiously oppose the clear light of the Gospel.

<span id="viii.xlii-p18"></span>I now return to Daniel’s words. He says
*A kingdom shall come and destroy all other kingdoms* I explained
yesterday the sense in which Christ broke up those ancient monarchies,
which had come to an end long before his advent. For Daniel does not
wish to state precisely what Christ would do at any one moment, but what
should happen from the time of the captivity till his appearance. If we
attend to this intention, all difficulty will be removed from the
passage. The conclusion, therefore, is this; the Jews should behold the
most powerful empires, which should strike them with terror, and utterly
astonish them, yet they should prove neither stable nor firm, through
being opposed to the kingdom of the Son of God. But Isaiah denounces
curses upon all the kingdoms which do not obey the Church of God. (<span
id="viii.xlii-p18.1"></span>[Isa
60:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#012.md)<span
id="viii.xlii-p18.1"></span>.) As all those monarchs erected their
crests against the Son of God and true piety, with diabolical audacity,
they must be utterly swept away, and God’s curse, as announced by the
Prophet, must become conspicuous upon them. Thus Christ rooted up all
the empires of the world. The Turkish empire, indeed, at this day,
excels in wealth and power, and the multitude of nations under its sway;
but. it was not God’s purpose to explain future events after the
appearance of Christ. He only wished the Jews to be admonished, and
prevented from sinking under the weight of their burden, since they
would be in imminent danger through the rise of so many fresh tyrannies
in the world, and the absence of all repose. God wished, therefore, to
brace their minds by fortitude. One reason *was* this — to cause them to
dwell upon the promised redemption, and to experience how evanescent and
uncertain are all the empires of the world which are not founded in God,
and not united to the kingdom of Christ. *God,* therefore, will *set up
the kingdoms of the heavens, which shall never be dissipated.* It is
here worthwhile to notice the sense in which Daniel uses the term
“perpetuity ” It ought not to be restricted to the person of Christ, but
belongs to all the pious and the whole body of the Church. Christ is
indeed eternal in himself, but he also communicates his eternity to us,
because he preserves the Church in the world, and invites us by the hope
of a better life than this, and begets us again by his Spirit to an
incorruptible life. The perpetuity, then, of Christ’s reign, is twofold,
without considering his person. *First,* in the whole body of believers;
for though the Church is often dispersed and hidden from men’s eyes, yet
it never entirely perishes; but God preserves it by his incomprehensible
virtue, so that it shall survive till the end of the world. Then there
is a *second* perpetuity in each believer, since each is born of
incorruptible seed, and renewed by the Spirit of God. The sons of Adam
are now not mortal only, but bear within them heavenly life; since the
Spirit within them is life, as St. Paul says, in the Epistle to the
Romans. (<span id="viii.xlii-p18.2"></span>[Ro
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010.md)<span
id="viii.xlii-p18.2"></span>.) We hold, therefore, that whenever
Scripture affirms Christ’s reign to be eternal, this is extended to the
whole body of the Church, and need not be confined to his person. We
see, then, how the kingdom from which the doctrine of the Gospel began
to be promulgated, was eternal; for although the Church was in a certain
sense buried, yet God gave life to his elect, even in the sepulcher.
Whence, then, did it happen that the sons of the Church were buried, and
a new people and a new creation required, as in <span
id="viii.xlii-p18.3"></span>[Ps
102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md)<span
id="viii.xlii-p18.3"></span>? Hence it easily appears that God is served
by a remnant, although they are not evident to human observation.

<span id="viii.xlii-p19"></span>He adds, *This kingdom shall not pass
away to another people.* By this phrase the Prophet means that this
sovereignty cannot be transferred, as in the other instances. Darius was
conquered by Alexander, and his posterity was extinguished, till at
length God destroyed that ill-fated Macedonian race, until no one
survived who boasted himself to be sprung from that-family. With respect
to the Romans, although they continued to exist, yet they were so
disgracefully subjected to the tyranny of strangers and barbarians, as
to be completely covered with shame and utterly disgraced. Then, as to
the reign of Christ, he cannot be deprived of the empire conferred upon
him, nor can we who are his members lose the kingdom of which he has
made us partakers. Christ, therefore, both in himself and his members,
reigns without any danger of change, because he always remains safe and
secure in his own person. As to ourselves, since we are preserved by his
grace, and he has received us under his own *care* and protection, we
are beyond the reach of danger; and, as I *have* already said, our
safety is ensured, for we cannot be deprived of the inheritance awaiting
us in heaven. We, therefore, who are kept by his power through faith, as
Peter says, may be secure and calm, (<span
id="viii.xlii-p19.1"></span>[1Pe
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#005.md)<span
id="viii.xlii-p19.1"></span>,) because whatever Satan devises, and
however the world attempts various plans for our destruction, we shall
still remain safe in Christ. *We* thus see how the Prophet’s words ought
to be understood, when he says that this fifth empire is not to be
transferred and alienated to another people. The last clause of the
sentence, which is this, *it shall bruise and break all other kingdoms,
and shall stand perpetually itself,* does not require any long
exposition. We have explained the manner in which Christ’s kingdom
should destroy all the earthly kingdoms of which Daniel had previously
spoken; since whatever is adverse to the only-begotten Son of God, must
necessarily perish and utterly vanish away. A Prophet exhorts all the
kings of the earth to kiss the Son. (<span
id="viii.xlii-p19.2"></span>[Ps
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#012.md)<span
id="viii.xlii-p19.2"></span>.) Since neither the Babylonians, nor
Persians, nor Macedonians, nor Romans, submitted themselves to Christ,
nay, even used their utmost efforts to oppose him, they were the enemies
of piety, and ought to be extinguished by Christ’s kingdom; *because,*
although the Persian empire was not in existence when Christ appeared in
the world, yet its remembrance was cursed before God. For Daniel does
not here touch only on those things which were visible to men, but
raises our minds higher, assuring us most clearly that no true support
on which we can rest can be found except in Christ alone. Hence he
pronounces, that without Christ all the splendor, and power, opulence,
and might of the world, is vain, and unstable, and worthless. He
confirms the same sentiment in the following verse, where God shewed the
king of Babylon what should happen in the last times, when he pointed
out a *stone cut out of the mountain without hands* We stated Christ to
be cut out of the mountain without hands, because he was divinely sent,
so that men cannot claim anything for themselves in this respect, since
God, when treating of the redemption of his own people, speaks thus, by
Isaiah, — Since God saw no help in the world, he relied upon his own arm
and his own power. (<span id="viii.xlii-p19.3"></span>[Isa
63:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#005.md)<span
id="viii.xlii-p19.3"></span>.) As, therefore, Christ was sent only by
his heavenly Father, he is said to be *cut out without hands*

<span id="viii.xlii-p20"></span>Meanwhile, we must consider what I have
added in the second place, that the humble and abject origin of Christ
is denoted, since it was like a rough and unpolished stone. With regard
to the word “mountain”, I have no doubt Daniel here, wished to shew
Christ’s reign to be sublime, and above the whole world. Hence the
figure of the mountain means, in my opinion, — Christ should not spring
out of the earth, but should come in the glory of his heavenly Father,
as it is said in the Prophet. And thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, art the
least among the divisions of Judah; yet out of thee shall a leader in
Israel arise for me, and his reign shall be from the days of eternity.
(<span id="viii.xlii-p20.1"></span>[Mic
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/mic005.htm#002.md)<span
id="viii.xlii-p20.1"></span>.) Daniel, then, here condescends to those
gross imaginations to which our minds are subjected. Because, at the
beginning, Christ’s dignity did not, appear so great as we discern it in
the kings of the world, and to this day it seems to some obscured by the
shame of the cross, many, alas! despise him, and do not acknowledge any
dignity in him. Daniel, therefore, now raises aloft our eyes and senses,
when he says *this stone should be cut out of the mountain* Meanwhile,
if any one prefers taking the mountain for the elect people, I will not
object to it, but this seems to me not in accordance with the genuine
sense of the Prophet. At length he adds, *And the dream is true, and its
interpretation trustworthy* Here Daniel securely and intrepidly asserts,
that he does not bring forward doubtful conjectures, but explains
faithfully to King *Nebuchadnezzar* what he has received from the Lord.
Here he claims for himself the Prophetic authority, to induce the king
of Babylon to acknowledge him a sure and faithful interpreter of God. We
see how the prophets always spoke with this confidence, otherwise all
their teaching would be useless. If our faith depended on man’s wisdom,
or on anything of the kind, it would indeed be variable. Hence it is
necessary to determine this foundation of truth, — Whatever the Prophets
set before us proceeds from God; and the reason why they so constantly
insist on this is, lest their doctrine should be supposed to be
fabricated by men. Thus also in this place, Daniel first says, *the
dream is true;* as if he said, the dream is not a common one, as the
poets fable concerning a gate of horn; the dream is not confused, as men
imagine when scarcely sane, or stuffed with meat and drink, or through
bodily constitution, either melancholy or choleric. He states,
therefore, the king of Babylon’s dream to *have* been a *true* oracle;
and adds, *its interpretation is certain* Where, as in the next clause,
the Prophet again urges his own authority, lest Nebuchadnezzar should
doubt his divine instructions to explain the truth of his dream. It now
follows, —

<span id="viii.xliii"></span>

<span id="viii.xliii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xliii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:46](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#046.md)<span id="viii.xliii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xliii-p2"></span>**46.** Then the king Nebuchadnezzar
fell upon his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they
should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.

<span id="viii.xliii-p3"></span>**46.** Tunc rex Nebuchadnezer cecidit
in faciem suam, et Danielem adoravit et oblationem, et suffitum
odoriferum,  <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) jussit illi
sacrificari.

<span id="viii.xliii-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.xliii-p6"></span><span id="viii.xliii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xliii-p7"></span>When the king of Babylon *fell upon his
face,* it is partly to be considered as worthy of praise and partly of
blame. It was a sign of both piety and modesty, when he prostrated
himself before God and his Prophet. We know the *fierceness* and pride
of kings; nay, we see them act like madmen, because they do not reckon
themselves among mortals, and become blinded with the splendor of their
greatness. Nebuchadnezzar was really a very powerful monarch, and it was
difficult for him so to regulate his mind as to attribute the glory to
God. Thus the dream which Daniel explained could not be pleasing to him.
He saw his monarchy cursed before God, and about to perish in ignominy
others, too, which should succeed it were ordained in heaven; and though
he might *receive* some comfort from the destruction of the other
kingdoms, yet it was very harsh to delicate ears, to hear that a
kingdom, which appeared most flourishing, and which all men thought
would be perpetual, was of but short duration and sure to perish. As,
therefore, the king so prostrated himself before Daniel, it is, as I
have said, a sign of piety in thus reverencing God, and in embracing the
prophecy, which would otherwise be bitter and distasteful. It was also a
sign of modesty, because he humbled himself so before God’s Prophet Thus
far the king of Babylon is worthy of praise, and we will discuss
tomorrow the deficiency in his reverence.

<span id="viii.xliv"></span>

<span id="viii.xliv-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="viii.xliv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since thou hast
shewn us by so many, such clear and such solid *testimonies,* that we
can hope for no other Redeemer than him whom thou hast set forth and as
thou hast sanctioned his divine and eternal power by so many miracles,
and hast sealed it by both the preaching of the Gospel and the seal of
thy Spirit in our hearts, and dost confirm the same by daily
*experience,* — *Grant* that we may remain firm and stable in him. May
we never decline from him may our faith never waver, but withstand all
the temptations of Satan and may *we* so persevere in the course of thy
holy calling, that we may be gathered at length unto that eternal
blessedness and perpetual rest which has been obtained for us by the
blood of the same, thy Son — Amen.

<span id="viii.xlv"></span>

<span id="viii.xlv-p1"></span>Lecture Twelfth

<span id="viii.xlv-p2"></span>We said yesterday that King Nebuchadnezzar
was worthy of praise, because he prostrated himself before Daniel after
he had heard the narration of his dream and the interpretation which was
added. For he gave them some testimony of piety, since in the person of
Daniel he adored the true God, as we shall mention hereafter. Hence he
shewed himself teachable, since the prophet might, exasperate his mind;
because tyrants can scarcely ever bear anything to detract from their
power. But he cannot be entirely excused. Although he confesses the God
of Israel to be the only God, yet he transfers a part of his worship to
a mortal man. Those who excuse this do not sufficiently remember how
profane men mingle heavenly and earthly things; though they occasionally
have right dispositions, yet they relax immediately to their own
superstitions. Without doubt the confession, which we shall meet with
directly, was confined to this single occasion. Nebuchadnezzar was not
really and completely converted to true piety, so as to repent of his
errors, but he partially recognized the supreme power to be with the God
of Israel. This reverence, however, did not correct all his idolatries,
but by a sudden impulse, as I have said, he confessed Daniel to be a
servant of the true God. At the same time he did not depart from the
errors to which he had been accustomed, and he afterwards returned to
greater hardness, as we shall find in the next chapter. So also we see
Pharaoh giving glory to God, but only for a moment, (<span
id="viii.xlv-p2.1"></span>[Ex
9:27](../../../bib/kjv/exo009.htm#027.md)<span id="viii.xlv-p2.1"></span>,
and <span id="viii.xlv-p2.2"></span>[Ex
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo010.htm#016.md)<span
id="viii.xlv-p2.2"></span>;) meanwhile he continued determinately proud
and cruel, and never put off his original disposition. Our opinion of
the king of Babylon ought to be of the same kind, though different in
degree. King Nebuchadnezzar’s obstinacy was not equal to the pride of
Pharaoh. Each, indeed, showed some sign of reverence, bug neither was
truly and heartily submissive to the God of Israel. Hence he bows before
Daniel, not thinking him a God, but mingling and confounding, as profane
men do, black and white; and we know that from the beginning even the
dullest men had some perception of the only God. For no one ever denied
the existence of a Supreme Deity, but men afterwards fabricated for
themselves a multitude of gods, and transferred a part of the divine
worship to mortals. As King Nebuchadnezzar was involved in these errors,
we are not surprised at his adoring Daniel, and at the same time
confessing there is but one God! And at this day we see how all in the
papacy confess this truth, and yet they tear up the name of God, not in
word, but in reality; for they so divide the worship of God, that each
has part of the spoil and the plunder. Daniel relates what experience
even now teaches us. This adoration was, it is true, commonly received
among the Chaldeans, since the Orientals were always extravagant in
their ceremonies, and we know their kings to have been adored as gods.
But since the word for sacrificing is here used, and the word, <span
id="viii.xlv-p2.3"></span>מנחה, *mencheh,* for “*offering*” also occurs,
it is quite clear that Daniel was worshipped without consideration, as
if he had been a demigod dropped down from heaven. Hence we must
conclude that king Nebuchadnezzar did wrong in offering this honor to
Daniel.

<span id="viii.xlv-p3"></span>There ought to be moderation in our
respect for God’s Prophets, as we should not extol them beyond their
deserts; we know the condition on which the Lord calls us forth — -that
he alone may be exalted, while all his teachers, and prophets, and
servants, should remain in their own position. A question arises
concerning the Prophet himself, — Why did he allow himself to be
worshipped? For if Nebuchadnezzar sinned, as we have said, the Prophet
had no excuse for allowing it. Some commentators labor anxiously to
excuse him; but if he passed this by in silence, we must be compelled to
confess him in some degree corrupted by the allurements of the court,
since it is difficult to be familiar there without immediately being
subject to its contagion. The defense of any man, however perfect, ought
never to interfere With this fixed principle — nothing must be
subtracted from the honor of God, and — it is a mark of perverseness
whenever and howsoever the worship which is peculiar to God is
transferred to creatures. Perhaps Daniel decidedly refused this, and so
restrained the folly of the king of Babylon; but I leave the point in
doubt, as nothing is said about it. Although it is scarcely probable
that he took no notice at the time, when he saw the honor of God partly
transferred to himself; for this would have been to make himself a
partaker of sacrilege and impiety. A holy Prophet could scarcely fall
into this snare. We know many things are omitted in the narrative, and
Daniel does not record what was done, but what the king ordered. He
prostrated himself on his face; but perhaps Daniel shewed this to be
unlawful. When he ordered sacrifice to be offered, Daniel might have
rejected it as a great sill. For Peter properly corrected the error of
Cornelius, which was more tolerable, since he wished to adore Peter
after the common fashion. If, therefore, the Apostle did not endure
this, but boldly rebuked the deed, (<span id="viii.xlv-p3.1"></span>[Ac
10:26](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#026.md)<span
id="viii.xlv-p3.1"></span>,) what must be said about the Prophet? But,
as I have said, I dare not assert anything on either side, unless what
conjecture renders probable, that God’s servant rejected this
preposterous honor. If, indeed, he allowed it, he had no excuse for his
sin; but still, as we have said, it is very difficult for those who
desire to retain their purity to have much intercourse with courts,
without contracting some spots of corruption. We see this even in the
person of Joseph. Although he was completely dedicated to God, yet in
his language, as shown by his swearing, he was tainted by the Egyptian
custom. (<span id="viii.xlv-p3.2"></span>[Ge
42:15](../../../bib/kjv/gen042.htm#015.md)<span
id="viii.xlv-p3.2"></span>.) And since this was sinful in him, the same
may be said of Daniel. Let us go on: —

<span id="viii.xlvi"></span>

<span id="viii.xlvi-p1"></span><span id="viii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:47](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#047.md)<span id="viii.xlvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlvi-p2"></span>**47.** The king answered unto Daniel,
and said, Of a truth *it is,* that your God *is* a God of gods, and a
Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal
this secret.

<span id="viii.xlvi-p3"></span>**47.** Respondit rex Danieli, et dixil,
Exvero Deusvester ipse *est* Deusdeorum, et dominus regum, et revelator
arcanorum, quod potueris revelare arcanum hoc.

<span id="viii.xlvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xlvi-p5"></span><span id="viii.xlvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlvi-p6"></span>This confession is quite pious and holy,
and is fraught with rectitude and sincerity; it may even be taken as a
proof of true conversion and repentance. But, as I have lately reminded
you, profane men are sometimes seized with an admiration of God and then
they profess largely and copiously whatever may be expected from God’s
true worshippers. Still this is but momentary, for all the while they
remain wrapt up in their own superstitions. God, therefore, extorts this
language from them, when they speak so piously; but they inwardly retain
their faults, and afterwards easily fall back to their accustomed habits
— as a memorable example will shortly prove to us. Whatever sense be
adopted, God wished his glory to be proclaimed by the mouth of the
profane king, and desired him to be the herald of his own power and
influence. But this was peculiarly profitable to those Jews who still
remained firm in their allegiance; for the greater part had revolted —
notoriously enough, and had degenerated with great facility from the
pure worship of God. When led into captivity, they became idolaters and
apostates, and denied the living God; but a small number of the pious
remained; God wished to promote their benefit, and to strengthen their
minds when he drew this confession from the king of Babylon. But another
object was gained, since the king as well as all the Chaldeans and
Assyrians were rendered more excuseless. For if the God of Israel was
truly God, why did Bel in the meantime retain his rank*? He is the God
of gods* — then it must be added at once, he is the enemy of false gods.
We observe how Nebuchadnezzar here mingles light with darkness, and
black with white, while he confesses the God of Israel to be supreme
among gods, and set continues to worship other deities. For if the God
of Israel obtains his right, all idols vanish away. Hence,
Nebuchadnezzar contends with himself in this language. But, as I have
said, he is seized by a violent impulse, and is not quite in his senses
when he so freely declares the power of the only God.

<span id="viii.xlvi-p7"></span>As far then as words go, he says, *truly
your God is himself a God of gods* The particle *truly* is by no means
superfluous here; it is strongly affirmative. For if any one had
inquired of him whether Bel and other idols were to be worshipped as
gods, he might answer, “*yes*;” but doubtfully, and according to
pre-conceived opinion, since all superstitious worshippers are
perplexed, and if ever they defend their superstitons, they do so with
the rashness which the devil suggests, but not according to their
judgment. In truth, their minds are not composed when they dare to
assert their own superstitions to be pious and holy. But Nebuchadnezzar
seems here formally to renounce his own errors; as if he had said —
Hitherto I acknowledged other gods, but I now change my opinion; I have
discovered your God to be the chief of all gods. And, truly, if he
really spoke his own mind, he might *perceive* he was doing injustice to
his own idols, if there was any divinity in them; Israel’s God was
confessedly held in utter hatred and abomination by the profane nations.
By extolling him above all gods, he degrades Bel and the whole crew of
false gods which the Babylonian worshipped. But, as we have said, he was
swayed by impulse and spoke without thinking. He was in a kind of
enthusiasm, since God astonished him, and then drew him on to wonder at
and to declare his own power. He calls him *Lord of kings,* by which
eulogium he claims for him the supreme dominion over the world; he means
to assert that Israel’s God not only excels all others, but holds the
reins of government over the world. For if he is the Lord of kings, all
people are under his hand and dominion! and the multitude of mankind
cannot be drawn away from his empire, if he rules their very monarchs.
We understand, therefore, the meaning of these words, namely, whatever
deity is worshipped is inferior to the God of Israel, because he is high
above all gods; then his providence rules over the world, while he is
Lord of all peoples and kings, and governs all things by his will.

<span id="viii.xlvi-p8"></span>He adds, *he is a revealer of secrets*
This is our proof of Divinity, as we have said elsewhere. For Isaiah,
when wishing to prove the existence of only one God, takes these two
principles, viz., Nothing happens without his permission; and his
foreseeing all things. (<span id="viii.xlvi-p8.1"></span>Daniel
48:3-5<span id="viii.xlvi-p8.1"></span>.) These two principles have been
inseparably unified. Although Nebuchadnezzar did not understand what was
the true peculiarity of Divinity, yet he is here impelled by the secret
instinct of God’s Spirit clearly to set forth God’s power and wisdom.
Hence he confesses the God of Israel to excel all gods, since he obtains
power in the whole world, and nothing whatever is concealed from him. He
adds the reason — *Daniel could reveal that secret* This reason does not
seem very good one; for he infers the world to be governed by one God,
because Daniel made this secret known. But, then “this has no reference
to his power.” The answer to this remark is easy; we shewed elsewhere
how we ought not to imagine a god like Apollo who can only predict
future events. And, truly, it is far too insipid to attribute to God
simple prescience, as if the events of the world had any other
dependence than upon his power; for God is said to have a previous
knowledge of future events, because he determined what he wished to have
done. Hence Nebuchadnezzar concluded the dominion of the whole world to
be in God’s hands, because he could predict futurity; for unless he had
the full power over the future, he could not predict anything with
certainty. As, therefore, he really predicts future; events, this
clearly determines all things to be ordained by him, and disproves the
existence of chance, while he fulfills whatever he has decreed.

<span id="viii.xlvi-p9"></span>Let us learn from this passage, how
insufficient it is to celebrate God’s wisdom and power with noisy
declamation, unless we at the same time reject all superstitions from
our minds, and so cling to the only God as to bid all others heartily
farewell. No fuller verbal confession can be required than is here set
before us; and yet we observe how Nebuchadnezzar was always involved in
Satan’s impostures, because he wished to retain his false gods, and
thought it sufficient to yield the first place to the God of Israel. Let
us learn again, to do our best in purging the mind front all
superstitions, that the only God may pervade all our senses. Meanwhile,
we must observe how severe and dreadful a judgment awaits Papists, and
all like them, who at least ought to be imbued with the rudiments of
piety, while they confess the existence of but one supreme God, and yet;
mingle together a great multitude of deities, and dishonor both his
power and wisdom, and at the same time observe, what is here said by a
profane king. For the Papists not; only divide God’s power, by
distributing it in parts to each of their saints; but also when they
speak of God himself, they fancy him as knowing all things beforehand,
and yet; leaving all things contingent on man’s free will; first
creating all things, and then leaving every event in suspense. Hence
heaven and earth, as they bear either men’s merits; or crimes, at one
time become useful, and at another adverse to mankind. Truly enough,
neither rain, nor heat, nor cloudy nor serene weather, nor anything else
happens without God’s permission; and whatever is adverse is a sign of
his curse; whatever is prosperous and desirable is the sign of his
favor. This, indeed, is true, but when the Papists lay their foundation
in the will of man, we see how they deprive God of his rights. Let us
learn, then, from this passage, not to attribute to God less than was
conceded by this profane king.

<span id="viii.xlvii-p1"></span><span

2:48](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#048.md)<span id="viii.xlvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlvii-p2"></span>**48.** Then the king made Daniel a
great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the
whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise
*men* of Babylon.

<span id="viii.xlvii-p3"></span>**48.** Tunc rex Danielem magnificavit,
et munera praeclara, et magna dedit ei,  <span
id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) et constituit eum super totam
povinciam Babylonis, et magistrum procerum super omnes sapientes
Babylonis.

<span id="viii.xlvii-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.xlvii-p6"></span><span id="viii.xlvii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlvii-p7"></span>Here also another point is added,
namely, how King Nebuchadnezzar raised God’s Prophet and adorned him
with the highest honors. We have spoken of that preposterous worship
which he himself displayed and commanded others to offer. As far as
concerns gifts and the discharge of public duties, we can neither
condemn Nebuchadnezzar for honoring God’s servant, nor yet Daniel for
suffering himself to be thus exalted. All God’s servants ought to take
care not to make a gain of their office, and we know how very pestilent
the disease is when prophets and teachers are addicted to gain, or
easily receive the gifts offered them. For where there is no contempt of
money, many vices necessarily spring up, since all avaricious and
covetous men adulterate God’s word and makes, traffic of it. (<span
id="viii.xlvii-p7.1"></span>[2Co
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#017.md)<span
id="viii.xlvii-p7.1"></span>.) Hence all prophets and ministers of God
ought to watch against being covetous of gifts. But as far as Daniel is
concerned, he might receive what the king offered him just as Joseph
could lawfully undertake the government of the whole of Egypt. (<span
id="viii.xlvii-p7.2"></span>[Ge
41:40](../../../bib/kjv/gen041.htm#040.md)<span
id="viii.xlvii-p7.2"></span>.) There is no doubt that Daniel had other
views than his private and personal advantage. We must not believe him
covetous of gain while he bore his exile so patiently, and, besides
this, when at the hazard of his life he had preferred abstinence from
the royal food to alienating himself from the people of God. As he
manifestly preferred the shame of the cross by which God’s people were
then oppressed, to opulence, luxury, and honor, who will think him
blinded by avarice through receiving gifts? But since he saw the sons of
God miserably and cruelly oppressed by the Chaldeans, he wished as far
as he could to succor them in their miseries. As he well knew this would
afford some consolation and support to his race, he allowed himself to
be made prefect of a province. And the same reason influenced him to
seek some place of authority for his companions, as follows, —

<span id="viii.xlviii"></span>

<span id="viii.xlviii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>[Daniel
2:49](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#049.md)<span
id="viii.xlviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlviii-p2"></span>**49.** Then Daniel requested of the
king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of
the province of Babylon: but Daniel *sat* in the gate of the king.

<span id="viii.xlviii-p3"></span>**49.** Et Daniel petiit a rege; et
constituit super opus  <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md)
provinciae Babylonis Sidrach, Mesach, et Abed-nego: Daniel antem *erat*
in porta regis.

<span id="viii.xlviii-p5"></span> 

<span id="viii.xlviii-p6"></span><span id="viii.xlviii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlviii-p7"></span>Some ambition may be noticed here in
the Prophet, since he procures honors for his own companions. For when
the king spontaneously offers him a command, he is obliged to accept it;
he need not offend the mind of the proud king. There was a necessity for
this, because he himself seeks from the king prefectships for others.
What shall we say was the origin of this conduct? As I have already
hinted, Daniel may be here suspected of ambition, for it might be
charged against him as a crime that he made a gain of the doctrine which
he had been divinely taught. But, he rather regarded his people, and
wished to bring some comfort to them when oppressed. For the Chaldeans
treated their slaves tyrannically, and we are aware how the Jews were
utterly hated by the whole world. When therefore Daniel, through the
feeling of pity, seeks some consolation from the people of God, there is
no reason for accusing him of any fault, because he was not drawn aside
by private advantage, and did not desire honors for either himself or
his companions; but he was intent on that object to enable his
companions to succor the Jews in their troubles. Hence the authority
which he obtains for them has no other object than to cause the Jews to
be treated a little more humanely, as their condition would not be so
harsh and bitter while they have prefects of their own people who should
study to treat them as brethren. We now see how Daniel may be rightly
acquitted of this charge without any difficulty or argument; for the
matter itself is sufficiently clear, and we may readily collect that
Daniel was both pious and humane, and free from all charge of sin. From
the words — *was in the king’s gate, we* ought not to understand his
being a gate-keeper. Some suppose this phrase to be used, because they
were accustomed to exercise justice there; but they transfer to the
Chaldeans what Scripture teaches us of the Jews. I take it more simply.
Daniel was chief over the king’s court, since he held the supreme
command there; and that sense is more genuine. Besides, we are fully
aware of the custom of the Chaldeans and Assyrians to make the approach
to the king difficult. Daniel is therefore said *to be at the gate,* to
prevent any entrance into the king’s palace, unless by his permission.
It now follows, —

id="viii.vi-p10.2"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p11"></span> Calvin is correct in preferring the sense
of “pieces” to that of “blood;” for <span id="viii.vi-p11.1"></span>הדם,
*hedem,* is a Chaldee word, and the <span id="viii.vi-p11.2"></span>ין
is the Chaldee plural ending; his criticism, too, on <span
id="viii.vi-p11.3"></span>מלה, *meleh,* is also correct; for it is the
Chaldee equivalent for <span id="viii.vi-p11.4"></span>דבר, *deber,* a
“word” or thing, and justly rendered “edict.” As great light has been
thrown upon the meaning and derivation of single words since Calvin’s
time, we may often find that modern knowledge has rendered his
derivations untenable; still the soundness of his judgment is worthy of
notice. It may be added, too, that the perplexity is increased when
Chaldee forms are used, although there is a uniform change of single
letters observable in the two languages. Thus <span
id="viii.vi-p11.5"></span>ש, *sh,* becomes <span
id="viii.vi-p11.6"></span>ת*, th,* as in <span
id="viii.vi-p11.7"></span>[Da 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan002.htm#007.md)<span
id="viii.vi-p11.7"></span> and <span id="viii.vi-p11.8"></span>[Da

<span id="viii.xlii-p12"></span> The Rabbi Barbinel, to whose opinion
Calvin’s attention was drawn, was the celebrated Jewish statesman and
commentator, Isaac Abarbanel. He claimed descent from the family of King
David, being born in Lisbon 1437, and died at Venice 1508. From Dr.
M’Caul’s preface to Tegg’s *­Prideaux,* (1845,) we learn that his
“Commentary to Daniel” was entitled *Mayene ha-yeshuah,* and published
after his death in 1551, 4to, and also at Amsterdam, 1647. The younger
Buxtory translated it into Latin, and it was refuted at length by
Carpzov, Hulsius, and Varenius. Several of his works are still
unprinted. He was a strong opponent of the Christian interpretation of
Daniel, and an equally determined combatant of the rationalistic views
of Moses the Egyptian, the son of Maimon.
