<span id="xiii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 9

<span id="xiii.i"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p1"></span><span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#001.md)<span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p2"></span>**1.** He cried also in mine ears with a
loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw
near, even every man *with* his destroying weapon in his hand.

<span id="xiii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Et clamavit voce magna in aure mea
 <span id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) dicendo, appropinquate  <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) praefecturae  <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) urbis: et quisque  <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192.md) instrumentum perditionis  <span
id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) suae in manu sua.

<span id="xiii.i-p9"></span> 

<span id="xiii.i-p10"></span><span id="xiii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p11"></span>Now the manner of that vengeance which was
lately mentioned is expressed. Hence the Prophet says, God exclaimed, so
that his command reached to the Chaldeans, who were to be executors of
his vengeance, and therefore the imperative mood pleases me better,
*approach ye therefore.* Those who consider the tense past say
“visitations,” nor can they do otherwise, because no sense can be
elicited from the words — to have approached the prefecture of the city.
But if we read the imperative mood, the sense agrees very well,
*approach ye the prefecture:* the thing is put for the persons, or the
name of the men may be understood, and thus <span
id="xiii.i-p11.1"></span>פקדות, *phekdoth,* may be taken in the genitive
*case.* As to the general meaning, God commands his servants who held
authority over the devoted city, *to approach,* or apply themselves, or
be ready to fulfill his work, and *let each,* says he, *have his
instrument of destruction:* here destruction is taken actively. For God
does not mean that the Chaldeans were armed for their own destruction,
but for that of the Jews, and the ruin of the city. It follows —

<span id="xiii.ii"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#002.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p2"></span>**2.** And, behold, six men came from the
way of the higher gate, which lieth toward the north, and every man a
slaughter-weapon in his band; and one man among them *was* clothed with
linen, with a writer’s inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood
beside the brasen altar.

<span id="xiii.ii-p3"></span>**2.** Et ecce sex viri venientes e via
portae superioris  <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) quae est e
regione aquilonis: et cuique  <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md)
instrumentum mallei sui  <span id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) in manu
sua: et vir unus in medio ipsorum vestitus lineis,  <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197.md) et atramentarium scribae in lumbis
ejus: et venerunt, et steterunt e regione altaris aenei.

<span id="xiii.ii-p8"></span> 

<span id="xiii.ii-p9"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p10"></span>Now the Prophet writes that God’s command
was not vain or empty, because the effect appears directly by vision.
Therefore six men offered themselves. Why again he names six, rather
than more or fewer, I have not found out. For some cite the thirty-ninth
chapter of Jeremiah, where eight leaders are referred to who were in
Nebuchadnezzar’s army, and had the chief authority; but first they vary
in number, then they twist themselves in many ways. But I am not so
anxiously curious, nor does it seem to me of any consequence, unless
perhaps God wished to show his servant that a little band was
sufficient, and that there was no need of a large army: or by six men he
confusedly designated the whole army. It is certain indeed that
Nebuchadnezzar came surrounded with a large force to destroy the city;
but in the meantime God wished to destroy that pride and contumacy of
the people, since he only shows to his servant six men who could destroy
the whole city. He says therefore, *that he came by the gate, or by way
of a lofty gate,* or higher one, which was towards the north, because
Babylon lay towards that region with respect to Jerusalem. It appears
therefore that the Chaldeans were here pointed out, to whom the way was
direct through that gate, since it ascended from the north over against
Jerusalem. He says, *each man had an instrument of destruction,* or of
pounding. This word is derived from <span id="xiii.ii-p10.1"></span>נפף,
*nephetz,* which is to destroy and rub to pieces: therefore it can be
taken as well for the mallet as for the act itself. There is no doubt
that the Prophet meant that God’s command should not be without
immediate effect: because as soon as he cried out, six men were directly
at hand for obeying him, which he afterwards expresses more clearly when
he says *that they stood near the altar* For it was a sign of their
readiness to obey God’s commands when they placed themselves before the
altar. But this passage is worthy of notice, because it shows us how
anxiously we ought to give heed to God’s threats, which are for the most
part *directed* against us. In order that we may learn to rouse
ourselves from our torpor, here as in a glass the conjunction of God’s
vengeance with his threats is proposed to us. For as soon as he had
spoken, we see that there were six men armed and drawn up for destroying
the city. But God wished to show his Prophet this vision, because his
business was with a hard and stupid people, as we have already seen.
God’s voice was as it were their final doom: just as if a trumpet
resounded, and announced that there was no hope of pardon unless the
enemy gave himself up directly. So therefore *God exclaimed with a loud
voice,* but this was no empty cause of fright, because he directly
joined the execution of it, when six men appeared before the altar. But
he calls *the altar* which Solomon had built of square stones *brazen:*
even the brazen altar was not sufficient, but it looks to its first
origin.

<span id="xiii.ii-p11"></span>Now he says that there was among them, one
man clothed with a linen garment (<span id="xiii.ii-p11.2"></span>[1Ki
8:64](../../../bib/kjv/kg1008.htm#064)<span id="xiii.ii-p11.2"></span>..md)
He is not placed among the multitude, as one among the others, but he is
separated, because his signification is distinct. This *man* then
doubtless sustained the character of an angel, and it is sufficiently
customary in Scripture that angels, when they take a visible form,
should be called men: not because they are really men, but because God
endues them with such forms as he sees fit. Some, whose opinion I do not
altogether reject, restrict this to Christ. But because the Prophet adds
no remarkable traits, I had rather receive it generally of any angel. He
says therefore, that there was among the Chaldeans, who were prepared to
execute God’s vengeance, *one man clad in a linen garment* A distinct
mark is sometimes given to angels which separates them from men. The
linen garment was then a remarkable ornament. And the sacrificing
Papists, as if they were apes, have imitated that custom in their
garments called surplices. But since priests were accustomed to be clad
in linen robes, here the angel was represented to the Prophet in this
garb. Now let us go on, because in the next verse it will be evident why
mention was made of that angel.

<span id="xiii.iii"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
9:3-4](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#003.md)<span id="xiii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p2"></span>**3.** And the glory of the God of Israel
was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the
house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which *had* the
writer’s inkhorn by his side;

<span id="xiii.iii-p3"></span>**3.** Et gloria Dei Israel ascendit
 <span id="fr_198"></span>[199](#fn_198.md) a cherub super quem residebat
 <span id="fr_199"></span>[200](#fn_199.md) ad limen domus: et clamavit ad
vi-rum indutum vestibus lineis, eujus atramentarium seribae in lumbis
erat.

<span id="xiii.iii-p6"></span>**4.** And the LORD said unto him, Go
through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a
mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the
abominations that be done in the midst thereof.

<span id="xiii.iii-p7"></span>**4.** Et dixit Iehovah ad ipsum, transi
per medium urbis, per medium Hierosolymae: et signa signum super frontes
virorum qui gemunt, et clamant super omnibus abominationibus quae
patiuntur in medio ejus.

<span id="xiii.iii-p8"></span> 

<span id="xiii.iii-p9"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p10"></span>Now the Prophet shows why the angel was
added to the Chaldeans, namely, to put a bridle on them, lest they
should rage promiscuously and without selection against the elect and
the reprobate. This is a remarkable passage, because from it we learn,
first, that God effectually threatens the impious, so that he may have
attendants always at hand to obey him; then, that even unbelievers make
war under the direction of God, and are governed by his rod, and do
nothing except at his will. Nor are the Chaldeans said to have come to
the temple in vain, and to have placed themselves before the altar of
God. This is not related to their praise, as if they obeyed God
spontaneously, or as if they had purposed to themselves to carry out his
commands, but the secret providence of God is here treated. Although,
therefore, the Chaldeans gave the rein to their self-will, and did not
think themselves divinely governed; yet God here pronounces that they
were under his hand just as if God had them as hired soldiers: as Satan
is said to have joined himself to the sons of God: this was not a
voluntary obedience, but because his machinations could not attack the
holy Job, unless by God’s command. (<span
id="xiii.iii-p10.1"></span>[Job
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006)<span id="xiii.iii-p10.1"></span>..md)
God’s sons appear in a very different way, since they offer a free
obedience, and desire him only to reign. But how great soever is the
difference between the sons of God and Satan, and all the reprobate, yet
it is equally true that Satan and the wicked obey God. This, therefore,
we must learn in the second place. But, thirdly, we are taught that God
never rashly executes his vengeance without sparing his elect. For this
reason in the slaughter of Jerusalem he has an angel, who opposes a
shield, as it were, to the Chaldeans, lest their cruelty should injure
them beyond God’s pleasure, as we shall by and bye see. Therefore I said
that the place was remarkable, because when God puts forth the signs of
his wrath, the sky is, as it were, overclouded, and the faithful no less
than the unbelieving are frightened, nay terrified with fear. For as to
outward condition, there was no difference between them. Because
therefore the sons of God are subject to that terror which obscures all
sense of God’s favor in adversity, so this doctrine must be held
diligently, namely, when God gives the rein to furious men, so that they
dissipate, overthrow, and destroy all things, then the angels are always
united, who restrain their intemperance with a hidden bridle, since
otherwise they would never be moderate.

<span id="xiii.iii-p11"></span>He says, therefore, *that the glory of
the God of Israel ascended from the cherub to the threshold* He takes
the glory of God for God himself, as we may readily collect from the
next verse; for he says that Jehovah had spoken. But this speech agrees
very well, because God cannot be comprehended by us, unless as far as he
accommodates himself to our standard. Because therefore God is
incomprehensible in himself, nor did he appear to his Prophet as he
really is, (since not angels even bear the immense magnitude of his
glory, much less a mortal man,) but he knew how far it was expedient to
discover himself, therefore the Prophet here takes his glory for
himself; that is, the vision, which was a sign or symbol of the
*presence* of God. But he says *that it ascended from the cherub* Here
also is a change of number, because God is said everywhere to sit
between the cherubim. (<span id="xiii.iii-p11.1"></span>[2Sa
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#002.md)<span id="xiii.iii-p11.1"></span>;
<span id="xiii.iii-p11.2"></span>[2Ki
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/kg2019.htm#015.md)<span
id="xiii.iii-p11.2"></span>; <span id="xiii.iii-p11.3"></span>[Isa
37:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#016.md)<span
id="xiii.iii-p11.3"></span>.) But here only one cherub is put, but this
figure of speech is well understood, as it is so common, for God resided
between the cherubim: it is said *that he went thence to the threshold
of the temple* This was a prelude to departure, as we shall afterwards
see. And this testimony was needful to the Jews, because they thought
that God was bounded by the visible temple. Hence the Prophet shows that
God was not fixed to a place, so as to be compelled to remain there.
This is the reason why it is said *that he came from his seat to the
threshold of the temple* Now, he adds, *that he cried out to the man
clad in the linen garment, and whose inkhorn was by his side,* though
others translate it writing-tablets: but as he afterwards says, *write
on their foreheads,* it is very probable that the ink was in his girdle,
that he might mark the elect of God, that the Chaldeans should not touch
them. Again he calls the angel a man, but on account of the form which
he put on, as I said before. I cannot proceed further.

<span id="xiii.iv"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="xiii.iv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since thou hast
deigned to approach us so familiarly, that in return we may also desire
to approach thee, and remain in firm and holy union; so that whilst we
persevere in that lawful course which thou prescribest for us in thy
word, thy blessings may increase towards us, until thou leadest us to
fullness, when thou shalt gather us into thy celestial kingdom, by
Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xiii.iv-p3"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p1"></span>Lecture Twenty-fourth.

<span id="xiii.v-p2"></span>We began to explain the precept given to the
angel before God sent forth the Chaldeans to cut off the city, and
destroy the people. The angel is at length commanded to sign the
foreheads of all the pious. But many take the noun <span
id="xiii.v-p2.1"></span>תו, *tho,* which means the same as a mark, for
the last letter of the alphabet, and yet there is no reason to compel
them to do so. <span id="xiii.v-p2.2"></span>תו*, tho,* is a Hebrew
mark. It is puerile to invent that subtle comment, that the foreheads of
the pious were signed with that letter, because the noun <span
id="xiii.v-p2.3"></span>תורה, *thoreh,* which signifies the doctrine of
the law, begins with the same letter. Jerome brings forward another
figment: he says that in his time, among the Samaritans, the letter
<span id="xiii.v-p2.4"></span>ת was like a cross, with which the
Christians used then to sign themselves. But all see how nugatory this
is. Although it was not the figure which is now in use among the
Papists, but was the mark which the brothers Antonii used: but I omit
that as unworthy of mention. If puzzles please you, it would be a better
reason why the faithful were marked with the last letter, because they
were last among men, and as it were the offscouring of the world. Since
therefore from the beginning, the world has treated the sons of God as
if they were castaways, therefore I have said that they may be signed
with the last letter: but we may be content with the simple and genuine
sense of the Prophet: therefore God orders their foreheads to be signed.
We yesterday explained the cause, and said that a most useful doctrine
could be collected from this place, namely, when all things seem mingled
on the earth, and turned upwards and downwards, yet that God never casts
away the care of his own, but protects them from all harm. God therefore
always restrains his judgments, so that he really proves that the safety
of his people is dear and precious to himself. We gather also that
angels are ministers of this grace, because they watch over the safety
of the faithful, as Scripture everywhere testifies. (<span
id="xiii.v-p2.5"></span>[Ps. 91:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#012.md)<span id="xiii.v-p2.5"></span>, and
elsewhere often.) Now, if any one asks what this sign was? it must be
simply answered, that this vision was presented to the Prophet for the
common perception of all; for if we wish to single out a few in a crowd,
we need some sign. God therefore here borrows what we read concerning a
sign from the customs of men: for the faithful could not otherwise
understand that they were beyond the reach of weapons, when mixed with
the unbelieving. Because therefore it seems the common condition of all,
they might be frightened just as if God should raise his hand to
chastise their sins. Therefore he says here, that they were signed in
some way. It is true then that we daily bear a sign by which God
distinguishes us from the reprobate. For the blood of Christ reconciles
us to the Father, as is sufficiently known; but perhaps that also may be
too far-fetched. It is also true that when God struck the land of Egypt,
the Israelites were passed over by the angel, since the blood of a lamb
was sprinkled on the door-posts. (<span id="xiii.v-p2.6"></span>[Exod.
12:22](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#022.md),
[23](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#023)<span id="xiii.v-p2.6"></span>..md)
Every house which had the mark of blood was secure and safe, when God’s
vengeance was inflicted upon all the Egyptians. But as to this passage,
I interpret it thus: when God gives liberty to unbelievers, so float
they seem to be able to overturn the whole world, the angels are at the
same time sent forth, who hinder their lust that they should not touch
the sons of God. This then is sufficient for us.

<span id="xiii.v-p3"></span>Now the Prophet adorns the faithful with
various titles, when he says, *upon the foreheads of men who groan and
cry.* There is a great likeness between these two words, <span
id="xiii.v-p3.1"></span>אנך, *anek,* and <span
id="xiii.v-p3.2"></span>אנה, *aneh;* but one is written by <span
id="xiii.v-p3.3"></span>K final, and the other by <span
id="xiii.v-p3.4"></span>ה. He says then, *that the faithful groan over
the abominations:* and then, *that they cry out:* for thus they
translate the latter clause, although it may also be taken for
bewailing, if we only understand outward sorrow, and that which openly
appears. Hence we gather how God receives us under his guardianship, and
sends us his angels as protectors, so that if mixed with the impious, we
may yet keep ourselves undefiled by their pollutions, and then when we
cannot correct their wickedness, yet we bear testimony by grief and
sorrow that they displease us. When the Apostle commends to us the
patience of Lot, he says, that he tormented his heart while he dwelt in
Sodom. A single stranger could not recall those abandoned ones to a
sound mind, who had given themselves over to all wickedness. (<span
id="xiii.v-p3.5"></span>[2Pe 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#007.md)<span
id="xiii.v-p3.5"></span>.) But he did not grow hardened to the foulness
of so much sin, but continually groaned before God, and Was in perpetual
grief. The Prophet now bears the same witness *concerning* other
believers. Whatever it is, God here shows what he wishes his sons to be.
Therefore if we allow ourselves to approve the sins of the impious, and
take pleasure in them and applaud them, we boast ourselves in vain to be
God’s sons, because he does not reckon any among his own who do not
groan at abominations. And truly this is the sign of too much sloth,
when we see the sacred name of God made the subject of ridicule, and all
order overthrown, and yet are not affected with grief. Nor is it
surprising if we are involved in the punishment of sins which our own
connivance has fostered, instead of their being a torment to us. For
that exhortation must be remembered, that the zeal of God’s house may
eat us up, and the reproaches of those who reproach God may fall upon
us, (<span id="xiii.v-p3.6"></span>[Ps
69:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010)<span id="xiii.v-p3.6"></span>,.md)
as it is said elsewhere, May my tongue cleave to my palate, if I am
unmindful of thee, O Jerusalem, at the summit of my mirth. (<span
id="xiii.v-p3.7"></span>[Ps 137:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#006.md)<span
id="xiii.v-p3.7"></span>.) Therefore when we see on one side the name of
God trodden as it were under foot, and all justice violated, we see on
the other side the Church of God miserably and cruelly afflicted, if we
smile in security, by this very thing we sufficiently show that we have
nothing in common with God, and in vain we call him Father. Hence these
titles must be marked, by which the Prophet marks all God’s elect, when
he says, *whosoever groan over the abominations:* then he adds the word,
*crying out,* the better to express the ardor and vehemence of their
zeal, — just as if he said that groaning was not sufficient, as many
groan in a corner, when they see the whole order of God so perverted,
but when they *come* to the light and the sight of men, they dare not
give any sign of the least suspicion, because they are unwilling to
incur hatred and ill-will. The Prophet therefore here exacts more from
the sons of God than secret groaning, when he wishes them to groan
openly and vociferate; so that they bear witness that they abominate
those things which God has condemned in his law. Now it follows —

<span id="xiii.vi"></span>

<span id="xiii.vi-p1"></span><span id="xiii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
9:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#005.md)<span id="xiii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vi-p2"></span>**5.** And to the others he said in mine
hearing, Go ye after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye
spare, neither have ye pity:

<span id="xiii.vi-p3"></span>**5.** Illis autem dixit in auribus meis,
Transite per civitatem post eum, percutite: et ne parcat oculus vester,
et ne misereamini:

<span id="xiii.vi-p4"></span>**6.** Slay utterly old *and* young, both
maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon
whom *is* the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the
ancient men which *were* before the house.

<span id="xiii.vi-p5"></span>**6.** Senem, adolescentem, puellam, puerum
et mulieres percutite ad internecionem: tamen ad omnem virum super quem
fuerit signum, ne accesseritis,  <span id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md)
et a sanctuario meo incipite: et inceperunt a viris sentortbus qni erant
coram domo.

<span id="xiii.vi-p7"></span> 

<span id="xiii.vi-p8"></span><span id="xiii.vi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vi-p9"></span>Now the Prophet adds, that the Chaldeans
were sent to destroy the city and its inhabitants, but the order must be
observed, because they are ordered to go *behind the angel.* The grace
of God therefore precedes to the safety of all the pious: then he opened
the gate, and made a way open for his wrath, long and wide, after he had
removed the faithful from all danger: for this reason it is said, *that
he went through the city yet after him.* And Patti also signifies this,
when he says, after that your obedience has been fulfilled, then wrath
is at hand against all rebels and proud ones. (<span
id="xiii.vi-p9.1"></span>[2Co
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#006)<span id="xiii.vi-p9.1"></span>..md)
God therefore first cares for his own; but after he has received them
into his keeping, and hid them as it were under his wings, then he
permits the flame of his wrath to burn against all the wicked. In fine,
we see that as often as God revenges man’s wickedness, he regards his
Church, and treats all as worthy of peculiar care who are endued with
true and serious piety.

<span id="xiii.vi-p10"></span>Then *he orders them to strike, so that
their eye should not spare;* what God had taken to himself he transfers
to the Chaldees, because there ought to be an agreement between God and
all his servants, even those who are not voluntary agents, but whom he
bends every way by his secret instinct. Then he expresses more clearly,
*that they should not spare either old men or young men or boys or
girls;* as if he said, that he must rage against all promiscuously,
without any choice of age or sex. He here opposes women to men, because
that sex bends even the most cruel to pity, and we know that when men
are slain, women are preserved. Now girls seem to hold a better position
and boys also: and decrepit old men, because nothing is to be feared
from them, are *preserved* safe. But God wishes the Chaldeans so to
attack the whole city, that they respect neither age nor sex. Meanwhile
he excepts the faithful of whom he had spoken, *upon whomsoever the mark
shall be, do not approach him.* Here it is asked, were all the good
preserved free from slaughter? for we know that Jeremiah was drawn into
Egypt, to whom Chaldaea would have been a preferable place of
banishment. Already Daniel and his companions had been snatched away
before him, many were faithful in that multitude. On the other hand, we
see many despisers of God either escaped or left in the land, as
Nebuchadnezzar wished the dregs of the people to remain there. But we
saw of what sort they were in Jeremiah. It follows therefore that God
neither spared all the elect, nor made a difference in consequence of
the mark, because the wicked obtained safety as well as the faithful.
(<span id="xiii.vi-p10.1"></span>[Jer
39:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer039.htm#010.md)<span id="xiii.vi-p10.1"></span>;
<span id="xiii.vi-p10.2"></span>[Jer.
43:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/jer043.htm#004.md)<span id="xiii.vi-p10.2"></span>;
<span id="xiii.vi-p10.3"></span>[Jer.

[16](../../../bib/kjv/jer044.htm#016)<span id="xiii.vi-p10.3"></span>..md)
But we must observe, although God apparently afflicts his people with
the ungodly, yet they are so separated, that nothing happens which does
not tend to the safety of the righteous. When therefore God forbids the
Chaldeans to approach them, he does not mean them to be free from all
injury or disadvantage, but he promises that they should be so separated
from the ungodly, that they should acknowledge by sure experience that
God was never forgetful of his faith and promise. Now therefore we see
how that difficulty must be solved, since God does not so spare his own
as not to exercise their faith and patience, but he does spare them so
that no destruction happens to them, while he is always their protector.
But when he seems to give license to the impious, he grants this to
their destruction, because they are rendered more and more inexcusable.
And this daily *experience teaches* us. For we see that the very best
are so afflicted, that God’s judgment begins with them. We see meanwhile
that many reprobate exult with joy, even when they wantonly rage against
God. But God has the care of his own as if they had been sealed, and
separates them from the ungodly; but their own destruction remains for
the ungodly, and they are already held within its folds, although it is
not yet perceptible by the eye.

<span id="xiii.vi-p11"></span>It follows, *begin at my sanctuary. By*
the word “sanctuary” the priests and Levites are doubtless intended, and
their fault was clearly greater. There was indeed a small number who
worshipped God purely, and stood firm in their duty, but the greater
part had revolted from the worship of God. Hence this passage ought to
be understood of those impious priests who had despised God and his
servants. Nor is it surprising that God’s wrath should begin with them.
For they sin doubly; because if any private man fall away, his example
is not so injurious as that of the eminent, who thus draw all men into
the same ruin. For we know that the eyes of the multitude are turned
towards their superiors. Since therefore the priests sinned more
severely than all the rest, it is not surprising if God should punish
them in the first place. Those who interpret this sentence generally, as
if God ordered the Chaldeans to begin from his Church, extenuate the
sense of the Prophet too much. For this is not a comparison between the
Church of God and profane nations, but God rather compares the ministers
of his temple with the people in general, and a clearer explanation
follows directly after, *that the Chaldeans began from the men, the
elders who were before the house;* that is, who were *set over the
temple* Now it follows —

<span id="xiii.vii"></span>

<span id="xiii.vii-p1"></span><span id="xiii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#007.md)<span id="xiii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vii-p2"></span>**7.** And he said unto them, Defile the
house, and fill the courts the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth,
and slew in the city.

<span id="xiii.vii-p3"></span>**7.** Et dixit ad eos, poiluite  <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) domum, et implete altaria occisis
egredimini: et egressi sunt, et percusserunt in urbe.  <span
id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md)

<span id="xiii.vii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xiii.vii-p7"></span><span id="xiii.vii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vii-p8"></span>Here God. repeats what he had formerly
touched upon shortly and obscurely, namely, that the Jews trusted in
vain in the visible temple, because already he had ceased to dwell
there, as we shall afterwards see that he had departed. He had promised
that his perpetual dwelling should be there, (<span
id="xiii.vii-p8.1"></span>[Ps
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md)<span
id="xiii.vii-p8.1"></span>,) but that promise is not opposed by the
casual desertion of that dwelling-place. Now therefore he adds this
sentence, when he orders the Chaldeans *to pollute the temple itself*
But it was already polluted, some one will say: I confess it: but it
regards the Common perception of the people; for although the Jews had
infected the sanctuary of God with their wickedness, yet they boasted
that his worship still remained there and his sacred name. Now therefore
he speaks of another kind of pollution, namely, that *the Chaldeans
should fill all the area with the slain* If a human corpse or even a dog
was seen in the sanctuary, this was an intolerable pollution; all would
cry out that it was portentous. But as often as they entered the temple,
although they dragged their crimes into God’s presence, (for they went
there polluted with blood, rapine, fraud, perjuries, and a whole heap of
guilt,) yet they reckoned all these pollutions as nothing. God therefore
here obliquely derides their sloth, when he says that they boasted of
the sanctity of the temple in vain, because they should see it at length
filled with corpses, and then should really acknowledge that the temple
was no longer sacred. Now therefore we understand the intention of the
Holy Spirit. He adds, *that they had gone forth, and occasioned a
slaughter in the city* Here again the Prophet shows that the Chaldeans
would be at hand to smite the Jews with terror, as soon as God commanded
them to destroy the city and cut off the inhabitants. Perhaps the city
had not yet been besieged, and that is probable, for the Jews thought
Ezekiel’s threatenings fabulous. For this reason he says that the
Chaldeans appeared to him, that they might hear or receive the
commandment of God: then *that they had returned from the slaughter,* to
prove their obedience to God. In fine, he shows that God’s threatenings
should not be in vain, because as soon as the right time should arrive,
the army of the Chaldeans would be prepared for obedience. It follows —

<span id="xiii.viii"></span>

<span id="xiii.viii-p1"></span><span id="xiii.viii-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
9:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#008.md)<span id="xiii.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.viii-p2"></span>**8.** And it came to pass, while they
were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried,
and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the residue of Israel in
thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?

<span id="xiii.viii-p3"></span>**8.** Et factum est eum percuterent
relictus fui ego: et cecidi super faciem meam, et clamavi, et dixi Aha
 <span id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) Dominator Iehovah, an delebis
tu quidquid residunm est Israelis?  <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) fundendo iracundiam tuam super
Ierusalem.

<span id="xiii.viii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xiii.viii-p7"></span><span id="xiii.viii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.viii-p8"></span>The Prophet does not so carefully
preserve the historical order in the context of the words. For he says,
*the Chaldeans had returned* He afterwards adds, *while they were
striking the city that he fell upon his face.* But we know this to be
sufficiently common among the Hebrews, to relate first what is done
afterwards. Although the Prophet seems *to have fallen upon his face* a
little after their return, *i.e.,* as soon as he perceived the city to
have been nearly destroyed; yet he says, *while they were smiting, he
himself was left.* They think the word compounded of the past and future
tense, because there can be no grammatical reason that the word should
be one and single. Indeed the word seems compounded of the first and
third persons, as if he would say that he was left alone when all the
rest were perishing. Yet there is no ambiguity in the sense; for it
signifies that the Chaldeans had so attacked them everywhere, that they
left none remaining. Since, therefore, they raged so savagely against
the whole multitude, the Prophet seemed to himself to remain alone, as
if God had snatched him from the horrible burning, by which he wished
the whole people to be consumed and perish. Now if any one should
object, that they were not all slain, the answer is, that a slaughter
took place which almost destroyed the name of the people; then the
survivors were like the dead, because exile was worse to them than death
itself. Lastly, we must remark that the prophecy was extended to the
last penalty, which at length awaits the ungodly, although God connives
at them for a time, or merely chastises them moderately.

<span id="xiii.viii-p9"></span>In fine, the slaughter of the city was
shown to the Prophet as if all the citizens had utterly perished. And so
God wished to show how terrible a destruction pressed upon the people,
and yet no one feared it. Now as the Prophet *fell upon his face,* it
was a testimony of the human affection, by which he instructed the
people although unworthy. Hence he fell upon his face as a mediator, for
we know that when the faithful ask pardon of God, they fall upon their
face. They are said also to pour forth their prayers for the sake of
humility, because they are unworthy to direct their prayers and words
upwards. (<span id="xiii.viii-p9.1"></span>[Ps
102:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001.md)<span
id="xiii.viii-p9.1"></span>.) Therefore Ezekiel shows that he interceded
for the safety of the people. And truly God was unwilling that his
servants, under pretense of zeal, should cast off all sense of humanity,
so that the slaughter of the people should be their play and joke. We
have seen how anxiously Jeremiah prayed for the people, so that he was
at length entirely overwhelmed with grief; for he wished, as we see in
the ninth chapter, that his eyes flowed down as fountains. (<span
id="xiii.viii-p9.2"></span>[Jer
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#001)<span id="xiii.viii-p9.2"></span>..md)
Hence the Prophets, although they were God’s heralds to promulgate his
wrath, yet had not altogether put off all care and anxiety; for when
they seemed to be hostile to the people they pitied them. And to this
end *Ezekiel fell on his face before God* And truly that was a grievous
trial, which he did not disguise; for he complains that a populous city
was destroyed, and women and boys slain promiscuously with men. But he
lays before God his own covenant, as if he said, even if the whole world
should perish, yet it was impossible for God to lose his own Church,
because he had promised, that as long as the sun and moon shone in
heaven, there should be a seed of the pious in the world. “They shall be
my faithful witnesses in heaven,” said he. (<span
id="xiii.viii-p9.3"></span>[Ps. 89:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#037.md),
[38](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#038)<span id="xiii.viii-p9.3"></span>..md)
The sun and moon are remaining in their place: therefore God seemed to
have broken his covenant when he destroyed the whole people. This is the
reason why the Prophet lies on his face, as if astonished, and exclaims
with vehemence, *Alas! O Lord God, wilt thou destroy the remnant of
Israel by pouring forth thine anger?* that is, whilst thou so purest
forth thine anger against Jerusalem — for that city remained as a
testimony of God’s covenant; for as yet some safety could be hoped for;
but although after it was cut off, the faithful wrestled with that
temptation, yet the contest was hard and fatiguing; for no one thought
that any memorial of God’s covenant could flourish when that city was
extinct. For he had there chosen his seat and dwelling, and wished to be
worshipped in that one place. Since, therefore, the Prophet saw that
city destroyed, he broke forth into a cry, what then will become of it!
For when thou hast poured forth thine anger against Jerusalem, nothing
will remain left in the city. Hence also it will readily be understood,
that God’s covenant was almost obliterated, and had lost all its effect.
Now it follows —

<span id="xiii.ix"></span>

<span id="xiii.ix-p1"></span><span id="xiii.ix-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
9:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#009.md)<span id="xiii.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ix-p2"></span>**9.** Then said he unto me, The iniquity
of the house of Israel and Judah *is* exceeding great, and the land is
full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD
hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.

<span id="xiii.ix-p3"></span>**9.** Et dixit mihi, iniquitas do-mus
Israel et Iehudah magna supra modum,  <span
id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) et repleta fuit terra sanguinibus, et
urbs repleta fuit perverse:  <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md)
quia dixerunt, Deseruit Iehovah terram, et Iehovah non respicit.

<span id="xiii.ix-p6"></span> 

<span id="xiii.ix-p7"></span><span id="xiii.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ix-p8"></span>Here God so answers his Prophet, that he
restrains too much fervor, and at the same time asserts his own justice
— for the Prophet might be impelled this way and that — he might even
doubt whether God would be true to his word. God might also shake his
confidence in another manner, as by raging too much against the
innocent; since therefore he might be agitated amidst those waves of
trial, what God now does ought to set him at rest. Therefore, as I have
already said, he mitigates the feelings of his Prophet, and at the same
time asserts the equity of his judgment against all false opinions which
are apt to creep over us when God’s judgments do not answer to our will.
Meanwhile it must be remarked, how the Prophet complains suppliantly of
the slaughter of the city, and although he seemed to expostulate with
God, yet he submitted all his senses to his command, and on that account
an answer is given which can calm him. Whenever, therefore, God does not
seem to work as our carnal reason dictates to us, we may learn, by the
Prophet’s example, how to restrain ourselves, and to subject our reason
to God’s will, so that it may suffice us that he wills a thing so,
*because* his will is the most perfect rule of all justice. We see that
Prophets sometimes complain, and seem also to permit themselves too much
liberty when they expostulate with God, as we saw a memorable example in
Jeremiah. (<span id="xiii.ix-p8.1"></span>[Jer
12](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#000.md)<span id="xiii.ix-p8.1"></span> and
<span id="xiii.ix-p8.2"></span>[Jer
20](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#000)<span id="xiii.ix-p8.2"></span>..md)
Then we read also a similar one in Habakkuk. (<span
id="xiii.ix-p8.3"></span>[Hab 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#002.md)<span
id="xiii.ix-p8.3"></span>.) How so? Do the Prophets contend with God
himself? yea, they directly return to themselves, and collect into order
all those wandering opinions by which they perceive that they were
greatly disturbed. So also our Prophet, on the one hand, wonders at the
slaughter of the city, and exclaims vehemently; at the same time *he
falls upon his face,* and in this way testifies that he would be
obedient, as soon as God answered him. This is the reason, then, why God
also desires to appease his servant; nor is it doubtful that we shall
experience the same thing, if we modestly and soberly learn to enquire
when God’s judgments do not answer our opinions. If, therefore, we
approach God in this way, he will doubtless show us that what he does is
right, and thus supply us with material for rest. Hence, also, God’s
inestimable indulgence toward his people is collected, because he so
deigns to render a reason, as if he wished to satisfy them. It is
certain that men are carried forward into too much rashness, as often as
they ask questions of God; for who will dare to oppose himself to his
judgments? and who will reply to him? so Paul says. (<span
id="xiii.ix-p8.4"></span>[Ro 9:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020.md)<span
id="xiii.ix-p8.4"></span>.) But God in his amazing goodness, descends
even thus far, so as to render a reason of his deeds to his servants, to
settle their minds, as I have said.

<span id="xiii.x"></span>

<span id="xiii.x-p1"></span>PRAYER.

<span id="xiii.x-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, since thou didst
formerly chastise thy people so harshly, that we may profit by their
example; and may we be so restrained by fear of thy name and obedience
to thy law, that thou mayest not pour forth thy wrath against us: then
if thou chastisest us, grant that it may all turn out to our good: and
may we so feel ourselves to have been sealed by thee, and to be
acknowledged in the number of thy sons, until at length thou shalt
gather us into that blessed inheritance which has been obtained for us
by the blood of thine only-begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="xiii.xi"></span>

<span id="xiii.xi-p1"></span>Lecture Twenty fifth.

<span id="xiii.xi-p2"></span>We began yesterday to explain God’s answer,
when he restrains the Prophet’s feelings: for he complained of the
destruction of the whole nation. There was a specious reason for it,
because he thought that in this way God’s covenant was made vain. But
God simply answers, that he does not exceed propriety in punishment. The
question is not answered in this way: for the Prophet might still doubt
how God’s covenant remained firm and yet the people was cut off. But God
does not in every way untie all the knots by which we are entangled:
hence he leaves us in suspense, but while he does this, he wishes to
prove our modesty, for if he satisfied us altogether, there would be no
proof of our obedience. But when he commands us to acquiesce in his
judgment, if we do not pass beyond it, then we bear ourselves towards
him as modestly as becomes us. Thus, therefore, he now answers half the
question of his Prophet when he pronounces, *that the sin of Jerusalem
and Judah is grievous* But he says, *beyond measure,* that the Prophet
may understand that the *city,* together with the nation, was to be
utterly *destroyed,* since there was no end to its wickedness. When he
says, *the land was filled with bloods, and the city with perverse
judgments:* bloods we may take for slaughters, or, generally, for all
kinds of sin; for the Scripture sometimes calls atrocious crimes which
deserve death, bloods, but it sometimes calls unjust slaughters so. But
because God embraces all the sins of the people, I readily interpret
bloods as crimes, by which those who had so often provoked his anger,
brought destruction upon themselves.

<span id="xiii.xi-p3"></span>It follows, *because they said, Jehovah has
deserted the land, Jehovah sees nothing* We had a similar sentence a
little before, (<span id="xiii.xi-p3.1"></span>[Eze
8:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012)<span id="xiii.xi-p3.1"></span>,.md)
and I then hinted that it was taken too coldly by interpreters, because
they think that the Jews were Epicureans, who thought that God enjoyed
his own ease, and did not regard human affairs. They think, therefore,
that the Jews were so inebriated by a brutish contempt of God, as to
think they could do as they pleased with impunity, since God was afar
off: as at this time profane men allow themselves so much license,
because they do not set God before their eyes, as the Scripture often
says. But we said that the Prophet intended something else. For when the
Jews had been often chastised, they were hardened in their sins, and
when they ought to acknowledge that those punishments were justly
inflicted upon them, they imagined that all things happened to them by
chance; just as unbelievers reckon all events as fortuitous. Such then
was the sloth of the people. God was visiting them, as he often says,
that he would be known among them as a judge: when they felt God’s hand
present with them, they said he was far off, because he did not succor
them in their miseries, nor offer himself as a shield against their
enemies. For their fathers had experienced the helping hand of God in
all their dangers. Since, then, God had cast away all regard for them,
and showed himself rather their enemy than the defender of their safety,
they said that he was afar off. And as we saw, he had stirred up the
Chaldeans, and was then proving the faithfulness of all his prophecies
when he was executing what he had denounced by his servants. Now,
therefore, we see in what sense they said, *that God had deserted the
land,* because, in truth, he was not granting it any taste of his favor.
But they experienced his power in another manner when he executed his
punishment upon them. Why then did they not think him a just avenger
when he thus chastised them? But they laid hold of one thing, that they
were not so regarded by God as to be rescued from their enemies. This
passage then is worthy of notice. For when God not only invites wretched
men to himself, but also draws them to receive the punishment due to
their sins, they are often rendered more obstinate, and fancy that God’
is afar off. Hence, therefore, it happens that they are seized with
madness, and hesitate not to provoke him more boldly. This perverseness
is now described when Ezekiel represents the Jews as saying, *that God
had deserted the land* For they are unable to see in it anything more
than this; for when profane men once take up the principle that they are
deserted by God, they think at the same time that whatever they do
escapes his notice. But this was the extreme of impiety: hence God
shows, that he could no longer spare men so abandoned. And he confirms
this also in the next verse when he says —

<span id="xiii.xii"></span>

<span id="xiii.xii-p1"></span><span id="xiii.xii-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
9:10](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#010.md)<span id="xiii.xii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.xii-p2"></span>**10.** And as for me also, mine eye shall
not spare, neither will I have pity; *but* I will recompense their way
upon their head.

<span id="xiii.xii-p3"></span>**10.** Etiam *ego,* non parcet  <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) oculus mens, et non miserebor: vias
ipsorum in capita eorum reddam.

<span id="xiii.xii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xiii.xii-p6"></span><span id="xiii.xii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.xii-p7"></span>Now God pronounces the Jews to be so
obstinate in their malice as to have cut off from themselves all hope of
pardon. For when he now says, *that he would be hostile to them without
pity,* he shows the necessity of taking vengeance, because their impiety
had penetrated even heaven, so that he could not spare them without
denying himself. And abrupt speech increases vehemence, as if God
pronounced that he had changed his plans. Now then we understand the
meaning of this answer, that the Jews were bound by so many and such
impious crimes, that they had closed the door of God’s pity: nay, they
had compelled him to the utmost pitch of vengeance, because they
continued to provoke him more and more. Let us learn then from this
passage not to weigh God’s judgments in our scale, because we are too
much accustomed to extenuate our sins, and to treat our serious
iniquities as but slight errors, because we do not attribute just honor
to God as the only judge. Now when God commands his Prophet to rest and
be silent, without doubt he at the same time restrains that rashness of
ours by which we burst forth in disobedience when he seems to us to be
too rigid. But, as I have said, we do not consider the greatness of our
sins. Therefore it is God’s province alone to pronounce concerning sins,
that no mortal should estimate the quality of actions, for then we
trench on God’s peculiar office. It follows —

<span id="xiii.xiii"></span>

<span id="xiii.xiii-p1"></span><span id="xiii.xiii-p1.1"></span>[Ezekiel
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#011.md)<span id="xiii.xiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.xiii-p2"></span>**11.** And, behold, the man clothed with
linen, which *had* the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying,
I have done as thou hast commanded me.

<span id="xiii.xiii-p3"></span>**11.** Et ecce vir indutus lineis
vestibus, cui atramentarium erat in lumbis, reversus retulit dicendo,
Feci quemadmodum praeceperas  <span id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md)
mihi.

<span id="xiii.xiii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xiii.xiii-p6"></span><span id="xiii.xiii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.xiii-p7"></span>This sentence confirms what I said
yesterday about God’s paternal anxiety towards the faithful. For the
Prophet taught, before God would permit the Chaldeans to destroy the
city, that an angel was sent before to succor the elect, and thus to
oppose himself to the violence of the enemies: where we have said that
it is shown to us as in a glass that God holds this order in his
judgments, that his fatherly love towards the faithful always precedes
them, so that he does not permit anything to happen to them but what
tends to their safety. For this reason the angel now says, *that he had
done as he was commanded.* Doubtless the obedience of the angel is
reported to us, because it answers to the will of God. Hence, therefore,
we gather that the safety of the faithful is always precious to God, and
therefore they will always be safe and secure when we think heaven and
earth mingled together. This then is the explanation. Now follows —
