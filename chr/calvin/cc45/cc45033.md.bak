<span id="ix.i-p1"></span>A TRANSLATION OF

<span id="ix.i-p2"></span>CALVIN'S VERSION OF

<span id="ix.i-p3"></span>THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER

<span id="ix.i.i"></span>

<span id="ix.i.i-p1"></span>

<span id="ix.i.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="ix.i.i-p3"></span>**1** Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to
the sojourners who are scattered through Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
Asia, and Bithyuia,

<span id="ix.i.i-p4"></span>**2** Elected according to the foreknowledge
of God the Father, through the sanctification of the Spirit, unto
obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you
and peace be multiplied.

<span id="ix.i.i-p5"></span>**3** Blessed be God, even the Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to his great mercy hath begotten us
again to a living hope, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
the dead,

<span id="ix.i.i-p6"></span>**4** To an inheritance incorruptible, and
undefiled, and unfading, laid up in heaven for you;

<span id="ix.i.i-p7"></span>**5** Who by the power of God are kept
through faith unto salvation, which is ready to be revealed at the last
time:

<span id="ix.i.i-p8"></span>**6** On account of which ye exult, though
now for a little while, if it be necessary, ye are made sorrowful
through various temptations;

<span id="ix.i.i-p9"></span>**7** That the probation of your faith, much
more precious than gold which perisheth, though even it be proved by
fire, may be found unto praise, and honour, and glory, when Jesus Christ
shall be revealed:

<span id="ix.i.i-p10"></span>**8** Whom, though ye have not seen, ye
love; on whom believing, though ye see him not, ye exult with joy
unspeakable and glorious;

<span id="ix.i.i-p11"></span>**9** Receiving the end of your faith, the
salvation of your souls.

<span id="ix.i.i-p12"></span>**10** Of which, salvation the prophets
inquired and searched, who prophesied of future grace to us;

<span id="ix.i.i-p13"></span>**11** Searching what or what manner of
time the Spirit of Christ who was in them did signify, previously
testifying of the sufferings of Christ, and of the glories which were to
follow:

<span id="ix.i.i-p14"></span>**12** To whom it was revealed, that not to
themselves, but to us they ministered the things which have been now
declared to you by those who have preached to you the gospel, through
the Holy Spirit sent from heaven; into which things the angels desire to
look.

<span id="ix.i.i-p15"></span>**13** Therefore, girding up the loins of
your mind, being sober, perfectly hope for the grace which is to be
brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;

<span id="ix.i.i-p16"></span>**14** As obedient children, not conformed
to former lusts which prevailed during your ignorance:

<span id="ix.i.i-p17"></span>**15** But as he who has called you is
holy, be ye also yourselves holy in *your* whole conduct;

<span id="ix.i.i-p18"></span>**16** Because it is written, "Be ye holy,
for I sin holy."

<span id="ix.i.i-p19"></span>**17** And since ye call on the Father,
who, without respect of persons, judgeth the work of every one, puss in
fear the time of your

<span id="ix.i.i-p20"></span>**18** Sojourning; knowing that not with
corruptible things, silver or gold, you have been redeemed from your
vain way of living, delivered down from the fathers;

<span id="ix.i.i-p21"></span>**19** But with the precious blood of
Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled:

<span id="ix.i.i-p22"></span>**20** Who had been, indeed, foreordained
before the world was founded, but has been manifested in the last times
for you,

<span id="ix.i.i-p23"></span>**21** Who through him believe in God, who
has raised him from the dead, and has given him glory, that your faith
and hope may be in God:

<span id="ix.i.i-p24"></span>**22** Purifying your souls by obedience to
the truth through the Spirit, with an unfeigned brotherly love, love ye
one another from a pure heart fervently;

<span id="ix.i.i-p25"></span>**23** Having been begotten again, not from
a seed that is corruptible, but incorruptible, through the word of the
living God, which abideth for ever.

<span id="ix.i.i-p26"></span>**24** For all flesh is as grass, and all
his glory as the flower of the grass: wither does the grass, and its
flower fades;

<span id="ix.i.i-p27"></span>**25** but the word of the Lord remains for
ever: and this is the word which has been declared to you.

<span id="ix.i.ii"></span>

<span id="ix.i.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="ix.i.ii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="ix.i.ii-p3"></span>**1** Laying aside, therefore, all
wickedness, and all guile, and dissimulations, and envyings, and all
slanderings,

<span id="ix.i.ii-p4"></span>**2** As infants lately born, desire the
milk that is rational and guileless, that by it ye may grow;

<span id="ix.i.ii-p5"></span>**3** If indeed ye have tasted that the
Lord is gracious:

<span id="ix.i.ii-p6"></span>**4** To whom coming as to a living stone,
rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and precious,

<span id="ix.i.ii-p7"></span>**5** Ye also yourselves as living stones
are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual
sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.

<span id="ix.i.ii-p8"></span>**6** Therefore also the Scripture contains
*this,* "Behold, I lay in Sion a corner-stone, chosen, precious; and he
who believeth in him shall not be ashamed."

<span id="ix.i.ii-p9"></span>**7** To you, then, who believe, he is
precious; but to the unbelieving, the stone which the builders rejected,
this has become the head of the corner;

<span id="ix.i.ii-p10"></span>**8** And a stone of stumbling and a rock
of offense to those who stumble at the word, being unbelieving; to which
also they had been appointed.

<span id="ix.i.ii-p11"></span>**9** But ye are a chosen race, a royal
priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye may declare the
virtues of him who has called you out of darkness

<span id="ix.i.ii-p12"></span>**10** Into his marvelous light: who
sometimes were not a people, but now are the people of God; who had not
obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.

<span id="ix.i.ii-p13"></span>**11** Beloved, I exhort you as sojourners
and strangers, to abstain from carnal desires, which war against the
soul;

<span id="ix.i.ii-p14"></span>**12** Having your behavior good among the
Gentiles, that whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may,
considering your good works, glorify God in the day of visitation.

<span id="ix.i.ii-p15"></span>**13** Be then subject to every human
ordinance for the Lord's sake;

<span id="ix.i.ii-p16"></span>**14** Whether to the king, as supreme; or
to governors, as those who are sent by him, for the punishment indeed of
evil-doers, but for the praise of those who do well:

<span id="ix.i.ii-p17"></span>**15** For so is the will of God, that by
well-doing ye should put a stop to the ignorance of foolish men;

<span id="ix.i.ii-p18"></span>**16** As free, and not having liberty as
a cloak for wickedness, but as the servants of God.

<span id="ix.i.ii-p19"></span>**17** Honor all, love the brotherhood,
fear God, honor the king.

<span id="ix.i.ii-p20"></span>**18** The servants, let them be subject
with all fear to *their* lords, not only to the good and humane, but
also to the perverse.

<span id="ix.i.ii-p21"></span>**19** For this is acceptable, if for
conscience towards God any one bears sorrows, suffering unjustly:

<span id="ix.i.ii-p22"></span>**20** For what sort of glory is it, if ye
bear it when having done evil ye be buffeted? but if, having done well
and suffering, ye bear it, this is acceptable with God.

<span id="ix.i.ii-p23"></span>**21** For to this end you have been
called; because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example,
that ye may follow his footsteps;

<span id="ix.i.ii-p24"></span>**22** Who did no sin, nor was guile found
in his mouth; who, when reviled, reviled not again;

<span id="ix.i.ii-p25"></span>**23** When suffering, threatened not; but
committed his cause to him who judgeth righteously;

<span id="ix.i.ii-p26"></span>**24** Who bare himself our sins in his
own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sin, may live to
righteousness; by whose bruise have ye been healed.

<span id="ix.i.ii-p27"></span>**25** For ye were as sheep going astray;
but ye have been now turned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

<span id="ix.i.iii"></span>

<span id="ix.i.iii-p1"></span>

<span id="ix.i.iii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="ix.i.iii-p3"></span>**1** In like manner the wives, let them
be subject to their own husbands, that even if any believe not the word,
they may without the word be gained by the behavior of *their* wives,

<span id="ix.i.iii-p4"></span>**2** While observing your pure behavior
and fear:

<span id="ix.i.iii-p5"></span>**3** Whose adorning, let it not be the
outward, in the plaiting of the hair and the encircling of gold, or the
putting on of cloaks;

<span id="ix.i.iii-p6"></span>**4** But the inner man of the heart,
which is in the incorruption of a placid and quiet spirit, which before
God is precious.

<span id="ix.i.iii-p7"></span>**5** For so formerly also holy women who
hoped in God, adorned themselves, being subject to their own husbands;

<span id="ix.i.iii-p8"></span>**6** As Sara, *who* obeyed Abraham,
calling him lord; whose daughters ye become, when ye do well, and are
not terrified by any dread.

<span id="ix.i.iii-p9"></span>**7** Let husbands in like manner dwell
with *them* according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife as the
weaker vessel, and as joint-heirs of the grace of life, that your
prayers may not be hindered.

<span id="ix.i.iii-p10"></span>**8** Finally, *be ye* of one mind,
compassionate, loving to the brethren, merciful, humble-minded;

<span id="ix.i.iii-p11"></span>**9** Not rendering evil for evil, or
railing for railing, but on the contrary, bless ye, knowing that you
have been called for this end, that ye may inherit a blessing.

<span id="ix.i.iii-p12"></span>**10** For let him who would love life
and see good days, keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking
guile; let him turn away from evil and do good;

<span id="ix.i.iii-p13"></span>**11** Let him seek peace and pursue it:

<span id="ix.i.iii-p14"></span>**12** Because the eyes of the Lord are
on the righteous, and his cars to their prayers; but the face of the
Lord is against them who do evil.

<span id="ix.i.iii-p15"></span>**13** And who is he who can do you harm,
if ye be followers of what is good?

<span id="ix.i.iii-p16"></span>**14** But if ye also suffer for
righteousness, happy *are ye;* and the fear of them fear not, nor be
troubled;

<span id="ix.i.iii-p17"></span>**15** But sanctify the Lord of hosts in
your hearts, and be ready always for an answer to any one asking you a
reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;

<span id="ix.i.iii-p18"></span>**16** Having a good conscience, that
whereas they speak against you as evil-doers, they may be ashamed who
slander your good behavior in Christ.

<span id="ix.i.iii-p19"></span>**17** For it is better to suffer, if so
be the will of God, for doing good than for doing evil:

<span id="ix.i.iii-p20"></span>**18** Because Christ also once suffered
for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, having
indeed been put to death in the flesh, but brought to life by file
Spirit:

<span id="ix.i.iii-p21"></span>**19** By whom having also gone, he
preached to the spirits who were in prison,

<span id="ix.i.iii-p22"></span>**20** When there were formerly
unbelievers, when once the patience of God waited in the days of Noah,
while the ark was prepared; in which a few, that is, eight souls, were
saved by water;

<span id="ix.i.iii-p23"></span>**21** Corresponding to which, baptism
saves us also now (not the casting away of the filth of the flesh, but
the answer of a good conscience towards God) through the resurrection of
Jesus Christ;

<span id="ix.i.iii-p24"></span>**22** Who is at the right hand of God,
having gone into heaven, angels and dominions and powers being made
subject to him.

<span id="ix.i.iv"></span>

<span id="ix.i.iv-p1"></span>

<span id="ix.i.iv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="ix.i.iv-p3"></span>**1** Christ then having suffered for us in
the flesh, be ye also armed with the same mind: because he who hath
suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;

<span id="ix.i.iv-p4"></span>**2** That he may no longer live the rest
of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.

<span id="ix.i.iv-p5"></span>**3** For it is enough for us, that we have
wrought, in the past time of life, the will of the Gentiles, when we
walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excesses in wine, revellings,
banquetings, and wicked idolatries:

<span id="ix.i.iv-p6"></span>**4** On account of which they think it
strange, that ye run not with *them* into the same excess of riot,
speaking evil *of you;*

<span id="ix.i.iv-p7"></span>**5** Who shall give account to him who is
ready to judge the living and the dead.

<span id="ix.i.iv-p8"></span>**6** For the gospel has for this end been
also preached to the dead, that they may indeed be judged according to
men in the flesh, but live according to God in the Spirit.

<span id="ix.i.iv-p9"></span>**7** But the end of all things is near; be
ye then sober, and watchful to pray;

<span id="ix.i.iv-p10"></span>**8** And above all things having fervent
love among yourselves; for love will cover a multitude of sins.

<span id="ix.i.iv-p11"></span>**9** Be hospitable towards one another,
without murmurings.

<span id="ix.i.iv-p12"></span>**10** As every one has received a gift,
minister the same one to another, as good dispensers of the manifold
grace of God;

<span id="ix.i.iv-p13"></span>**11** If any one speak, *let* *him speak*
as the oracles of God; if any one minister, *let him do so* as by the
power which God supplies; that in all things God may be glorified
through Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory and the dominion for ever and
ever. Amen.

<span id="ix.i.iv-p14"></span>**12** Beloved, think it not strange when
ye are tried by fire for the purpose of proving you, as though some new
thing had happened to you;

<span id="ix.i.iv-p15"></span>**13** But inasmuch as ye are partakers of
the sufferings of Christ, rejoice; that at the revelation also of his
glory ye may exultingly rejoice.

<span id="ix.i.iv-p16"></span>**14** If ye be reproached for the name of
Christ, happy *are ye;* for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon
you: by them, indeed, he is slandered, but by you he is glorified.

<span id="ix.i.iv-p17"></span>**15** But let none of you suffer as a
murderer, or a thief, or an evil-doer, or as a coveter of another man's
goods; but if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;

<span id="ix.i.iv-p18"></span>**16** Nay, let him in this case glorify
God: for it is the time, when judgment begins at the house of God;

<span id="ix.i.iv-p19"></span>**17** But if it be first on us, what
*will be* the end of those who obey not the gospel of God?

<span id="ix.i.iv-p20"></span>**18** And if the righteous be hardly
saved, the ungodly and the sinner, where will they appear?

<span id="ix.i.iv-p21"></span>**19** Let therefore those who suffer
according to the will of God, commit their souls to him, in doing good,
as to a faithful possessor.

<span id="ix.i.v"></span>

<span id="ix.i.v-p1"></span>

<span id="ix.i.v-p2"></span>CHAPTER 5

<span id="ix.i.v-p3"></span>**1** The elders who are among you I exhort,
who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a
partaker of the glory which shall be revealed:

<span id="ix.i.v-p4"></span>**2** Feed as much as in you lieth the flock
of God, discharging the office of bishops, not constrainedly, but
willingly; not for the sake of filthy lucre, but liberally;

<span id="ix.i.v-p5"></span>**3** And not as exercising tyranny over
*God's* heritages, but that ye may be patterns to the flock:

<span id="ix.i.v-p6"></span>**4** And when the Chief Shepherd shall
appear, ye shall receive an unfading crown of glory.

<span id="ix.i.v-p7"></span>**5** In like manner the younger, be ye
subject to the elder; yea, be ye all subject to one another: put ye on
humility of mind; because God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to
the humble.

<span id="ix.i.v-p8"></span>**6** Be ye then humbled under the mighty
hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;

<span id="ix.i.v-p9"></span>**7** All your care being cast on him, for
he cares for you.

<span id="ix.i.v-p10"></span>**8** Be sober, be vigilant, because your
adversary, the Devil, as a roaring lion, goeth around, seeking whom he
may devour:

<span id="ix.i.v-p11"></span>**9** Whom resist ye, being firm in the
faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your
brethren in the world.

<span id="ix.i.v-p12"></span>**10** Now the God of all grace, who hath
called us to his eternal glory through Christ Jesus, — may he perfect
you, while suffering for a short time, confirm, strengthen, *and*
establish *you:*

<span id="ix.i.v-p13"></span>**11** To him be the glory and the
dominion, for ever and ever. Amen.

<span id="ix.i.v-p14"></span>**12** By Sylvanus, a faithful brother to
you, as I suppose, I have written in a few words, exhorting *you* and
testifying that this is the true grace of God in which ye stand.

<span id="ix.i.v-p15"></span>**13** The *church,* elected together with
you, which is in Babylon, saluteth you, and Marcus my son.

<span id="ix.i.v-p16"></span>**14** Salute ye one another with the kiss
of love. Grace *be* to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
