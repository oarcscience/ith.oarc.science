<span id="vi.v-p1"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="vi.v.i"></span>

<span id="vi.v.i-p1"></span><span id="vi.v.i-p1.1"></span>[James
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.v.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.i-p2"></span>**1** From whence *come* wars and fightings
among you? *come they* not hence, *even* of your lusts that war in your
members?

<span id="vi.v.i-p3"></span>**1** Unde bella et pugnae inter vos? nonne
hinc, ex voluptatibus vestris, quae militant in membris vestris.

<span id="vi.v.i-p4"></span>**2** Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and
desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not,
because ye ask not.

<span id="vi.v.i-p5"></span>**2** Concupiscitis et non habetis;
invidetis et aemulamini, et non potestis obtinere; pugnatis et
belligeramini, non habetis, propterea quod non petitis;

<span id="vi.v.i-p6"></span>**3** Ye ask, and receive not, because ye
ask amiss, that ye may consume *it* upon your lusts.

<span id="vi.v.i-p7"></span>**3** Petitis, et non accipitis, quia male
petitis, ut in voluptates vestras insumatis.

<span id="vi.v.i-p8"></span> 

<span id="vi.v.i-p9"></span><span id="vi.v.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.i-p10"></span>**1** *From whence come wars*. As he had
spoken of peace, and had reminded them that vices are to be exterminated
in such a way as to preserve peace, he now comes to their contentions,
by which they created confusion among themselves; and he shews that
these arose from their invidious desires and lusts, rather than from a
zeal for what was just and right; for if every one observed moderation,
they would not have disturbed and annoyed one another. They had their
hot conflicts, because their lusts were allowed to prevail unchecked.

<span id="vi.v.i-p11"></span>It hence appears, that greater peace would
have been among them, had every one abstained from doing wrong to
others; but the vices which prevailed among them were so many attendants
armed to excite contentions. He calls our faculties *members*. He takes
*lusts* as designating all illicit and lustful desires or propensities
which cannot be satisfied without doing injury to others.

<span id="vi.v.i-p12"></span><span id="vi.v.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.i-p13"></span>**2** *Ye lust,* or *covet, and have not*.
He seems to intimate that the soul of man is insatiable, when he
indulges wicked lusts; and truly it is so; for he who suffers his sinful
propensities to rule uncontrolled, will know no end to his lust. Were
even the world given to him, he would wish other worlds to be created
for him. It thus happens, that men seek torments which exceed the
cruelty of all executioners. For that saying of Horace is true:

<span id="vi.v.i-p14"></span>The tyrants of Sicily found no torment
greater than envy.  <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md)

<span id="vi.v.i-p16"></span>Some copies have <span
id="vi.v.i-p16.1"></span>φονεύετε, “ye kill;” but I doubt not but that
we ought to read, <span id="vi.v.i-p16.2"></span>φθονεῖτε, “ye envy,” as
I have rendered it; for the verb, to kill, does in no way suit the
context.  <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) *Ye fight*: he does
not mean those wars and fightings, which men engage in with drawn
swords, but the violent contentions which prevailed among them. They
derived no benefit from contentions of this kind, for he affirms that
they received the punishment of their own wickedness. God, indeed, whom
they owned not as the author of blessings, justly disappointed them. For
when they contended in ways so unlawful, they sought to be enriched
through the favor of Satan rather than through the favor of God. One by
fraud, another by violence, one by calumnies, and all by some evil or
wicked arts, strove for happiness. They then sought to be happy, but not
through God. It was therefore no wonder that they were frustrated in
their efforts, since no success can be expected except through the
blessings of God alone.

<span id="vi.v.i-p19"></span><span id="vi.v.i-p19.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.i-p20"></span>**3** *Ye seek and receive not*. He goes
farther: though they sought, yet they were deservedly denied; because
they wished to make God the minister of their own lusts. For they set no
bounds to their wishes, as he had commanded; but gave unbridled license
to themselves, so as to ask those things of which man, conscious of what
is right, ought especially to be ashamed. Pliny somewhere ridicules this
impudence, that men so wickedly abuse the ears of God. The less
tolerable is such a thing in Christians, who have had the rule of prayer
given them by their heavenly Master.

<span id="vi.v.i-p21"></span>And doubtless there appears to be in us no
reverence for God, no fear of him, in short, no regard for him, when we
dare to ask of him what even our own conscience does not approve. James
meant briefly this, — that our desires ought to be bridled: and the way
of bridling them is to subject them to the will of God. And he also
teaches us, that what we in moderation wish, we ought to seek from God
himself; which if it be done, we shall be preserved from wicked
contentions, from fraud and violence, and from doing any injury to
others.

<span id="vi.v.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p1"></span><span id="vi.v.ii-p1.1"></span>[James
4:4-6](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#004.md)<span id="vi.v.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p2"></span>**4** Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know
ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever
therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p3"></span>**4** Adulteri et adulterae, an nescitis
quod amicitia mundi inimictia Dei est? qui ergo voluerit amicus esse
mundi, inimicus Dei constituitur.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p4"></span>**5** Do ye think that the scripture saith
in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?

<span id="vi.v.ii-p5"></span>**5** An putatis quod frustra dicat
scriptura? An ad invidiam concupiscit spiritus qui habitat in nobis?

<span id="vi.v.ii-p6"></span>**6** But he giveth more grace. Wherefore
he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p7"></span>**6** Quin majorem dat gratiam: —

<span id="vi.v.ii-p8"></span> 

<span id="vi.v.ii-p9"></span><span id="vi.v.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p10"></span>**4** *Ye adulterers*. I connect this
verse with the foregoing verses: for he calls them *adulterers*, as I
think, metaphorically; for they corrupted themselves with the vanities
of this world, and alienated themselves from God; as though he had said,
that they had become degenerated, or were become bastards. We know how
frequent, in Holy Scripture, is that marriage mentioned which God forms
with us. He would have us, then, to be like a chaste virgin, as Paul
says, (<span id="vi.v.ii-p10.1"></span>[2Co
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#002)<span id="vi.v.ii-p10.1"></span>..md)
This chastity is violated and corrupted by all impure affections towards
the world. James, then, does not without reason compare the love of the
world to adultery.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p11"></span>They, then, who take his words literally,
do not sufficiently observe the context: for he goes on still to speak
against the lusts of men, which lead away those entangled with the world
from God, as it follows, —

<span id="vi.v.ii-p12"></span>*The friendship of the world*. He calls it
the friendship of the world when men surrender themselves to the
corruptions of the world, and become slaves to them. For such and so
great is the disagreement between the world and God, that as much as any
one inclines to the world, so much he alienates himself from God. Hence
the Scripture bids us often to renounce the world, if we wish to serve
God.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p13"></span><span id="vi.v.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p14"></span>**5** *Do ye think*. He seems to adduce
from Scripture the next following sentence. Hence interpreters toil
much, because none such, at least none exactly alike, is found in
Scripture. But nothing hinders the reference to be made to what has been
already said, that is, that the friendship of the world is adverse to
God. Moreover; it has been rightly said, that this is a truth which
occurs everywhere in Scripture. And that he has omitted the pronoun,
which would have rendered the sentence clearer, is not to be wondered
at, for, as it is evident, he is everywhere very concise.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p15"></span>*The Spirit*, or, *Does the Spirit?* Some
think that the soul of man is meant, and therefore read the sentence
affirmatively, and according to this meaning, — that the spirit of man,
as it is malignant, is so infected with envy, that it has ever a mixture
of it. They, however, think better who regard the Spirit of God as
intended; for it is he that is given to dwell in us.  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) I then take the Spirit as that of God,
and read the sentence as a question; for it was his object to prove,
that because they envied they were not ruled by the Spirit of God;
because he teaches the faithful otherwise; and this he confirms in the
next verse, by adding that *he giveth more grace*

<span id="vi.v.ii-p20"></span>For it is an argument arising from what is
contrary. Envy is a proof or sign of malignity; but the Spirit of God
proves himself to be bountiful by the affluence of his blessings. There
is then nothing more repugnant to his nature than envy. In short, James
denies that the Spirit of God rules where depraved lusts prevail, which
excite to mutual contention; because it is peculiarly the office of the
Spirit to enrich men more and more continually with new gifts.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p21"></span>I will not stop to refute other
explanations. Some give this meaning that the Spirit lusteth against
envy; which is too harsh and forced. Then they say that God *gives more
grace* to conquer and subdue lust. But the meaning I have given is more
suitable and simple, — that he restores us by his bounty from the power
of malignant emulation. The continuative particle <span
id="vi.v.ii-p21.1"></span>δὲ is to be taken adversatively, for <span
id="vi.v.ii-p21.2"></span>ἀλλὰ or <span id="vi.v.ii-p21.3"></span>ἀλλά
γε; so have I rendered it <span id="vi.v.ii-p21.4"></span>*quin*, but.

<span id="vi.v.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p1"></span><span id="vi.v.iii-p1.1"></span>[James
4:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#007.md)<span id="vi.v.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p2"></span>**7** Submit yourselves therefore to God.
Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p3"></span>**7** Subjecti igitur estote Deo;
Resistite diabolo, et fugiet a vobis;

<span id="vi.v.iii-p4"></span>**8** Draw nigh to God, and he will draw
nigh to you. Cleanse *your* hands, *ye* sinners; and purify *your*
hearts, *ye* double minded.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p5"></span>**8** Appropinquate Deo, et appropinquabit
vobis; mundate manus, peccatores; purificate corda duplici animo;

<span id="vi.v.iii-p6"></span>**9** Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep:
let your laughter be turned to mourning, and *your* joy to heaviness.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p7"></span>**9** Affligimini, lugete et plorate;
risus vester in luctum vertatur et gaudium in moerorem.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p8"></span>**10** Humble yourselves in the sight of
the Lord, and he shall lift you up.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p9"></span>**10** Humiliamini coram Deo, et eriget
vos.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p10"></span> 

<span id="vi.v.iii-p11"></span><span id="vi.v.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p12"></span>**7** *Submit yourselves*. The submission
which he recommends is that of humility; for he does not exhort us
generally to obey God, but requires submission; for the Spirit of God
rests on the humble and the meek. (<span id="vi.v.iii-p12.1"></span>[Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.v.iii-p12.1"></span>.) On this account he uses the illative
particle. For as he had declared that God’s Spirit is bountiful in
increasing his gifts, he hence concludes that we ought to lay aside
envy, and to submit to God.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p13"></span>Many copies have introduced here the
following sentence: “Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but
giveth grace unto the humble.” But in others it is not found. Erasmus
suspects that it was first a note in the margin, and afterwards crept
into the text. It may have been so, though it is not unsuitable to the
passage. For what some think, that it is strange that what is found only
in Peter, should be quoted as Scripture, may be easily disposed of. But
I rather conjecture that this sentence which accords with the common
doctrine of Scripture, had become then a sort of proverbial saying
common among the Jews. And, indeed, it is no more than what is found in
<span id="vi.v.iii-p13.1"></span>[Ps
18:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.v.iii-p13.1"></span>,

<span id="vi.v.iii-p14"></span>“The humble O Lord, thou wilt save;  
and the eyes of the proud wilt thou cast down:”

<span id="vi.v.iii-p15"></span>and similar sentences are found in many
other passages.  <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md)

<span id="vi.v.iii-p17"></span>*Resist the devil*. He shews what that
contention is which we ought to engage in, as Paul says, that our
contest is not with flesh and blood, but he stimulates us to a spiritual
fight. Then, after having taught us meekness towards men, and submission
towards God, he brings before us Satan as our enemy, whom it behooves us
to fight against.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p18"></span>However, the promise which he adds,
respecting the fleeing of Satan, seems to be refuted by daily
experience; for it is certain, that the more strenuously any one
resists, the more fiercely he is urged. For Satan, in a manner, acts
playfully, when he is not in earnest repelled; but against those who
really resist him, he employs all the strength he possesses. And
further, he is never wearied with fighting; but when conquered in one
battle, he immediately engages in another. To this I reply, that fleeing
is to be taken here for putting to flight, or routing. And, doubtless,
though he repeats his attacks continually, he yet always departs
vanquished.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p19"></span><span id="vi.v.iii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p20"></span>**8** *Draw nigh to God*. He again
reminds us that the aid of God will not be wanting to us, provided we
give place to him. For when he bids us to draw nigh to God, that we may
know him to be near to us, he intimates that we are destitute of his
grace, because we withdraw from him. But as God stands on our side,
there is no reason to fear succumbing. But if any one concludes from
this passage, that the first part of the work belongs to us, and that
afterwards the grace of God follows, the Apostle meant no such thing;
for though we ought to do this, yet it does \[not\] immediately follow
that we can. And the Spirit of God, in exhorting us to our duty,
derogates nothing from himself, or from his own power; but the very
thing he bids us to do, he himself fulfills in us.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p21"></span>In short, James meant no other thing in
this passage, than that God is never wanting to us, except when we
alienate ourselves from him. He is like one who brings the hungry to a
table and the thirsty to a fountain. There is this difference, that our
steps must be guided and sustained by the Lord, for our feet fail us.
But what some cavil at, and say, that God’s grace is secondary to our
preparation, and as it were the waiting-maid, is only frivolous; for we
know that it is no new thing that he adds now to former graces and thus
enriches more and more those to whom he has already given much.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p22"></span>*Cleanse* your *hands*. He here addresses
all those who were alienated from God and he does not refer to two sorts
of men, but he calls the same *sinners* and *double-minded* Nor does he
understand every kind of sinners, but the wicked and those of a corrupt
life. It is said in <span id="vi.v.iii-p22.1"></span>[Joh
9:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#003.md)<span id="vi.v.iii-p22.1"></span>,

<span id="vi.v.iii-p23"></span>“God does not hear sinners;”

<span id="vi.v.iii-p24"></span>in the same sense a woman is called a
sinner by Luke. (<span id="vi.v.iii-p24.1"></span>[Lu
7:39](../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#039.md)<span
id="vi.v.iii-p24.1"></span>.) It is said by the same and the other
evangelists, “He drinketh and eateth with sinners.” He, therefore, does
not smite all indiscriminately to that sort of repentance mentioned
here, but those who are wicked and corrupt in heart, and whose life is
base and flagitious or at least wicked; it is from these he requires a
purity of heart and outward cleanliness.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p25"></span>We hence learn what is the true character
of repentance. It is not only an outward amendment of life, but its
beginning is the cleansing of the heart. It is also necessary on the
other hand that the fruits of inward repentance should appear in the
brightness of our works.  <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md)

<span id="vi.v.iii-p28"></span><span id="vi.v.iii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p29"></span>**9** *Be afflicted and mourn*. Christ
denounces mourning on those who laugh, as a curse, (<span
id="vi.v.iii-p29.1"></span>[Lu
6:25](../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.v.iii-p29.1"></span>;) and James, in what shortly follows,
alluding to the same words, threatens the rich with mourning. But here
he speaks of that salutary mourning or sorrow which leads us to
repentance. He addresses those who, being inebriated in their minds, did
not perceive God’s judgment. Thus it happened that they flattered
themselves in their vices. That he might shake off from them this deadly
torpor, he admonishes them to learn to mourn, that being touched with
sorrow of conscience they might cease to flatter themselves and to exult
on the verge of destruction. Then *laughter* is to be taken as
signifying the flattering with which the ungodly deceive themselves,
while they are infatuated by the sweetness of their sins and forget the
judgment of God.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p30"></span><span id="vi.v.iii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p31"></span>**10** *Humble yourselves,* or, *be ye
humbled*. The conclusion of what is gone before is, that the grace of
God then be ready to raise us up when he sees that our proud spirits are
laid aside. We emulate and envy, because we desire to be eminent. This
is a way wholly unreasonable, for it is God’s peculiar work to raise up
the lowly, and especially those who willingly humble themselves.
Whosoever, then, seeks a firm elevation, let him be cast down under a
sense of his own infirmity, and think humbly of himself. Augustine well
observes somewhere, As a tree must strike deep roots downwards, that it
may grow upwards, so every one who has not his soul fixed deep in
humility, exalts himself to his own ruin.

<span id="vi.v.iv"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iv-p1"></span><span id="vi.v.iv-p1.1"></span>[James
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#011.md)<span id="vi.v.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iv-p2"></span>**11** Speak not evil one of another,
brethren. He that speaketh evil of *his* brother, and judgeth his
brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou
judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.

<span id="vi.v.iv-p3"></span>**11** Ne detrahatis invicem, fratres; qui
detrahit fratri, aut judicat fratrem suum, detrahit legi, et judicat
legem; si autem judicas legem, non es factor legis sed judex.

<span id="vi.v.iv-p4"></span>**12** There is one lawgiver, who is able
to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?

<span id="vi.v.iv-p5"></span>**12** Unus est legislator, qui potest
servare et perdere: tu, quis es qui judicas alterum?

<span id="vi.v.iv-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.v.iv-p7"></span><span id="vi.v.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iv-p8"></span>**11** *Speak not evil,* or, *defame not*.
We see how much labor James takes in correcting the lust for slandering.
For hypocrisy is always presumptuous, and we are by nature hypocrites,
fondly exalting ourselves by calumniating others. There is also another
disease innate in human nature, that every one would have all others to
live according to his own will or fancy. This presumption James suitably
condemns in this passage, that is, because we dare to impose on our
brethren our rule of life. He then takes *detraction* as including all
the calumnies and suspicious works which flow from a malignant and
perverted judgment. The evil of slandering takes a wide range; but here
he properly refers to that kind of slandering which I have mentioned,
that is, when we superciliously determine respecting the deeds and
sayings of others, as though our own morosity were the law, when we
confidently condemn whatever does not please us.

<span id="vi.v.iv-p9"></span>That such presumption is here reproved is
evident from the reason that is immediately added, *He that speaketh
evil of,* or *defames* *his brother, speaketh evil of,* or *defames*
*the law*. He intimates, that so much is taken away from the law as one
claims of authority over his brethren. Detraction, then, against the law
is opposed to that reverence with which it behooves us to regard it.

<span id="vi.v.iv-p10"></span>Paul handles nearly the same argument in
<span id="vi.v.iv-p10.1"></span>[Ro
14](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.v.iv-p10.1"></span>,
though on a different occasion. For when superstition in the choice of
meats possessed some, what they thought unlawful for themselves, they
condemned also in others. He then reminded them, that there is but one
Lord, according to whose will all must stand or fall, and at whose
tribunal we must all appear. Hence he concludes that he who judges his
brethren according to his own view of things, assumes to himself what
peculiarly belongs to God. But James reproves here those who under the
pretense of sanctity condemned their brethren, and therefore set up
their own morosity in the place of the divine law. He, however, employs
the same reason with Paul, that is, that we act presumptuously when we
assume authority over our brethren, while the law of God subordinates us
all to itself without exception. Let us then learn that we are not to
judge but according to God’s law.

<span id="vi.v.iv-p11"></span>*Thou art not a doer of the law, but a
judge*. This sentence ought to be thus explained: “When thou claimest
for thyself a power to censure above the law of God thou exemptest
thyself from the duty of obeying the law.” He then who rashly judges his
brother; shakes off the yoke of God, for he submits not to the common
rule of life. It is then an argument from what is contrary; because the
keeping of the law is wholly different from this arrogance, when men
ascribe to their conceit the power and authority of the law. It hence
follows, that we then only keep the law, when we wholly depend on its
teaching alone and do not otherwise distinguish between good and evil;
for all the deeds and words of men ought to be regulated by it.

<span id="vi.v.iv-p12"></span>Were any one to object and say, that still
the saints will be the judges of the world, (<span
id="vi.v.iv-p12.1"></span>[1Co
6:2](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#002)<span id="vi.v.iv-p12.1"></span>,.md)
the answer is obvious, that this honor does not belong to them according
to their own right, but inasmuch as they are the members of Christ; and
that they now judge according to the law, so that they are not to be
deemed judges because they only obediently assent to God as their own
judge and the judge of all. With regard to God he is not to be deemed
the doer of the law, because his righteousness is prior to the law; for
the law has flown from the eternal and infinite righteousness of God as
a river from its fountain.

<span id="vi.v.iv-p13"></span><span id="vi.v.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iv-p14"></span>**12** *There is one lawgiver*  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) Now he connects the power of saying
and destroying with the office of a lawgiver, he intimates that the
whole majesty of God is forcibly assumed by those who claim for
themselves the right of making a law; and this is what is done by those
who impose as a law on others their own nod or will. And let us remember
that the subject here is not civil government, in which the edicts and
laws of magistrates have place, but the spiritual government of the
soul, in which the word of God alone ought to bear rule. There is then
one God, who has consciences subjected by right to his own laws, as he
alone has in his own hand the power to save and to destroy.

<span id="vi.v.iv-p16"></span>It hence appears what is to be thought of
human precepts, which cast the snare of necessity on consciences. Some
indeed would have us to shew modesty, when we call the Pope antichrist,
who exercises tyranny over the souls of men, making himself a lawgiver
equal to God. But we learn from this passage something far more, even
that they are the members of Antichrist, who willingly submit to be thus
ensnared, and that they thus renounce Christ, when they connect
themselves with a man that is not only a mortal, but who also extols
himself against him. It is, I say, a prevaricating obedience, rendered
to the devil, when we allow any other than God himself to be a lawgiver
to rule our souls.

<span id="vi.v.iv-p17"></span>*Who art thou*. Some think that they are
admonished here to become reprovers of their own vices, in order that
they might begin to examine themselves, and that by finding out that
they were not purer than others, they might cease to be so severe. I
think that their own condition is simply suggested to men, so that they
may think how much they are below that dignity which they assumed, as
Paul also says, “Who art thou who judgest another?” (<span

<span id="vi.v.v-p2"></span>**13** Go to now, ye that say, To day or to
morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy
and sell, and get gain:

<span id="vi.v.v-p3"></span>**13** Age nunc, qui dicitis, Hodie et cras
eamus in civitatem, et transigamus illic annum unum, et mercemur et
lucremur;

<span id="vi.v.v-p4"></span>**14** Whereas ye know not what *shall be*
on the morrow. For what *is* your life? It is even a vapour, that
appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.

<span id="vi.v.v-p5"></span>**14** Qui nescitis quid cras futurum sit;
quae enim est vita nostra? vapor est scilicet ad exiguum tempus
apparens, deinde evanescens:

<span id="vi.v.v-p6"></span>**15** For that ye *ought* to say, If the
Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.

<span id="vi.v.v-p7"></span>**15** Quum dicere debeatis, Si Dominus
voluerit, et vixerimus, faciemus hoc vel illud.

<span id="vi.v.v-p8"></span>**16** But now ye rejoice in your boastings:
all such rejoicing is evil.

<span id="vi.v.v-p9"></span>**16** Nunc autem gloriamini in superbiis
vestris; omnia gloriatio talis, mala est.

<span id="vi.v.v-p10"></span>**17** Therefore to him that knoweth to do
good, and doeth *it* not, to him it is sin.

<span id="vi.v.v-p11"></span>**17** Qui ergo novit facere bonum, nec
facit, peccati reus est.

<span id="vi.v.v-p12"></span> 

<span id="vi.v.v-p13"></span><span id="vi.v.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.v-p14"></span>**13** *Go to now*. He condemns here
another kind of presumption, that many, who ought to have depended on
God’s providence, confidently settled what they were to do, and arranged
their plans for a long time, as though they had many years at their own
disposal, while they were not sure, no not even of one moment. Solomon
also sharply ridicules this kind of foolish boasting, when he says that

<span id="vi.v.v-p15"></span>“men settle their ways in their heart,  
and the Lord in the mean time rules the tongue.”  
(<span id="vi.v.v-p15.3"></span>[Pr
16:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001)<span id="vi.v.v-p15.3"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.v.v-p16"></span>And it is a very insane thing to undertake
to execute what we cannot pronounce with our tongue. James does not
reprove the form of speaking, but rather the arrogance of mind, that men
should forget their own weakness, and speak thus presumptuously; for
even the godly, who think humbly of themselves, and acknowledge that
their steps are guided by the will of God, may yet sometimes say,
without any qualifying clause, that they will do this or that. It is
indeed right and proper, when we promise anything as to future time, to
accustom ourselves to such words as these, “If it shall please the
Lord,” “If the Lord will permit.” But no scruple ought to be
entertained, as though it were a sin to omit them; for we read
everywhere in the Scriptures that the holy servants of God spoke
unconditionally of future things, when yet they had it as a principle
fixed in their minds, that they could do nothing without the permission
of God. Then as to the practice of saying, “If the Lord will or permit,”
it ought to be carefully attended to by all the godly.

<span id="vi.v.v-p17"></span>But James roused the stupidity of those who
disregarded God’s providence, and claimed for themselves a whole year,
though they had not a single moment in their own power; the gain which
was afar off they promised to themselves, though they had no possession
of that which was before their feet.

<span id="vi.v.v-p18"></span><span id="vi.v.v-p18.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.v-p19"></span>**14** *For what is your life?* He might
have checked this foolish license in determining things to come by many
other reasons; for we see how the Lord daily frustrates those
presumptuous men who promise what great things they will do. But he was
satisfied with this one argument, who has promised to thee a life for
tomorrow? Canst thou, a dying man, do what thou so confidently resolvest
to do? For he who remembers the shortness of his life, will have his
audacity easily checked so as not to extend too far his resolves. Nay,
for no other reason do ungodly men indulge themselves so much, but
because they forget that they are men. By the similitude of *vapor*, he
strikingly shews that the purposes which are founded only on the present
life, are altogether evanescent.

<span id="vi.v.v-p20"></span><span id="vi.v.v-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.v-p21"></span>**15** *If the Lord will*. A twofold
condition is laid down, “If we shall live so long,” and, “If the Lord
will;” because many things may intervene to upset what we may have
determined; for we are blind as to all future events.  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) By will he means not that which is
expressed in the law, but God’s counsel by which he governs all things.

<span id="vi.v.v-p23"></span><span id="vi.v.v-p23.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.v-p24"></span>**16** *But now ye rejoice*, or, *glory*.
We may learn from these words that James condemned something more than a
passing speech. *Ye rejoice*, or, *glory*, he says, in your empty
boastings. Though they robbed God of his government, they yet flattered
themselves; not that they openly set themselves up as superior to God,
though they were especially inflated with confidence in themselves, but
that their minds were inebriated with vanity so as to disregard God. And
as warnings of this kind are usually received with contempt by ungodly
men — nay, this answer is immediately given, “known to ourselves is what
is offered to us, so that there is no need of such a warning;” — he
alleges against them this knowledge in which they gloried, and declares
that they sinned the more grievously, because they did not sin through
ignorance, but through contempt.

<span id="vi.v.i-p15"></span> <span id="vi.v.i-p15.1"></span>Invidia
Siculi non invenere tyranni Majus tormentum. — EPIST. Lib. I. 2:58.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[130](cc45022.htm#fr_129.md) <span
id="vi.v.i-p16.3"></span>

<span id="vi.v.i-p17"></span> There is no MS. nor version in favor of
<span id="vi.v.i-p17.1"></span>φθονεῖτε. When it is said, “ye kill,” the
meaning is, that they did so as to the hatred or envy they entertained,
for hatred is the root of murder, and arises often from envy. What has
evidently led *Calvin* and others to conjecture a mistake here, has been
the difficulty arising from the order of the words, “Ye kill and ye
envy;” but this order is wholly consonant with the style of Scripture,
where often the greater evil or good is mentioned first, and then that
which precedes or leads to it. It is the same here as though the
copulative, *and*, were rendered causatively, “ye kill because ye envy.”
Envy is murder in the sight of God.

<span id="vi.v.i-p18"></span>The language of the whole passage is highly
metaphorical. He calls their contentions “wars and fightings;” for the
whole tenor of the passage is opposed to the supposition that he refers
to actual wars. He adopts a military term as to inward lusts or
ambitious desires, that they “carried on war” in their members; the
expedition for their contests was prepared within, mustered in their
hearts. Then the character of this war is more plainly defined, “Ye
covet,” not, ye lust; “ye kill,” or commit murder, for “ye envy;” when
ye cannot attain your objects, “ye wage war and fight,” that is, ye
wrangle and quarrel. Avarice and ambition were the two prevailing evils,
but especially avarice; and avarice too for the purpose of gratifying
the lusts and propensities of their sinful nature, as it appears from
the third verse.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[131](cc45022.htm#fr_130.md) <span
id="vi.v.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.ii-p16"></span> There are wagon-loads of interpretations,
says *Erasmus*, on this passage. The one given by *Calvin*, and adopted
by *Whitby*, *Doddridge*, *Scholefield*, and others, is the most
satisfactory, and what alone enables us to see a meaning in the words,
“more grace,” in the following verse. The Spirit dwells in God’s people,
and he dwells there to give more or increasing grace, according to the
tenor of what is said in <span id="vi.v.ii-p16.1"></span>[Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md)<span id="vi.v.ii-p16.1"></span>,
where God is said to “dwell with him that is of a contrite and humble
spirit,” and for this purpose, “to revive the spirit of the humble,”
etc.

<span id="vi.v.ii-p17"></span> 

<span id="vi.v.ii-p18"></span>**5, 6** “Do ye think that the scripture
speaketh *thus* in vain? Doth the Spirit who dwells in us lust to envy?
*nay*, but he giveth more (or increasing) grace: he therefore saith, God
sets himself in array against the insolent, but gives grace to the
humble.”

<span id="vi.v.ii-p19"></span>The humble are those who are made so by
grace; but God promises to give them more grace, to perfect that which
had begun.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[132](cc45022.htm#fr_131.md) <span
id="vi.v.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p16"></span> The passage is found in all MSS. and
versions: there is, therefore, no ground to think it an interpolation.
And it is taken literally from <span id="vi.v.iii-p16.1"></span>[Pr
3:34](../../../bib/kjv/pro003.htm#034.md)<span id="vi.v.iii-p16.1"></span>,
according to the *Sept.*; though the first clause differs from the
Hebrew in words, yet it is substantially the same. To “scorn the
scorners,” and to “resist (or, to stand in array against) the proud” or
insolent, mean the same thing.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[133](cc45022.htm#fr_132.md) <span
id="vi.v.iii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iii-p26"></span> In the seventh verse he seems still to
continue military terms, “Set yourselves, therefore, in array under God:
stand up against the devil, and he will flee from you.” It is especially
to be observed, that the first thing is to be under the banner and
protection of God, and then we can successfully stand up against the
devil: apart from God, we have no power to resist him.

<span id="vi.v.iii-p27"></span>The order in the following verse, the
eighth, is worthy of notice, as an example of what is very common in
Scripture. The main thing is first stated, to draw nigh to God: and then
the things which are previously necessary, to cleanse their hands and to
purify their hearts — an allusion probably to the practice among the
priests of the law, of washing themselves before they engaged in the
service of the temple. They were to wash their hands as though they had
been stained with blood, as the crime of murder had been imputed to them
in <span id="vi.v.iii-p27.1"></span>[Jas
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#002.md)<span id="vi.v.iii-p27.1"></span>:
and they were to purify their hearts from the covetings and ambitious
desires which they had entertained. Except those things were done they
could not draw nigh to God. And further, to draw nigh to God was
necessary before they could set themselves in array under his authority,
so that there is a connection between this verse and the former: the
ultimate object, stated first, was submission to God, and to be under
his protection; and all that follows was necessary for that purpose. The
regular order would be, Purify your hearts, cleanse your hands, draw
nigh to God, and be subject to him. But this mode of statement, by going
backward instead of forward, is to be met with in all parts of
Scripture. See on this subject the Preface to the third volume of
*Calvin’s* Commentaries on Jeremiah.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[134](cc45022.htm#fr_133.md) <span
id="vi.v.iv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.iv-p15"></span> *Griesbach* adds <span
id="vi.v.iv-p15.1"></span>καὶ κριτή<span id="vi.v.iv-p15.2"></span>ς,
“and judge,” a reading favored by many MSS. and the versions; and
doubtless it makes the passage more complete, especially as what follows
belongs to the judge rather than to the lawgiver, that is, to save or to
destroy.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[135](cc45022.htm#fr_134.md) <span
id="vi.v.v-p21.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v.v-p22"></span> The words may be rendered thus, “If the
Lord will, we shall both live and do this or that.” So that living and
doing are both dependent on God’s will.
