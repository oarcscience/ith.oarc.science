<span id="iv.iii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="iv.iii.i"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p1"></span><span id="iv.iii.i-p1.1"></span>[1 Peter
2:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.iii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Wherefore laying aside all malice,
and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,

<span id="iv.iii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Proinde deposita omni malitia et
omni dolo et simulationibus et invidiis et omnibus obtrectationibus,

<span id="iv.iii.i-p4"></span>**2.** As newborn babes, desire the
sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:

<span id="iv.iii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Tanquam modò geniti infantes, lac
rationale et dolo vacuum appetite, ut per illud subolescatis:

<span id="iv.iii.i-p6"></span>**3.** If so be ye have tasted that the
Lord *is* gracious.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Si quidem gustastis quòd benignus
sit Dominus;

<span id="iv.iii.i-p8"></span>**4.** To whom coming, *as unto* a living
stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, *and* precious,

<span id="iv.iii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Ad quem accedentes, qui est lapis
vivus, ab hominibus quidera reprobatus, apud Deum vero electus ac
pretiosus;

<span id="iv.iii.i-p10"></span>**5.** Ye also, as lively stones, are
built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual
sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Ipsi quoque tanquam vivi lapides,
aedificamini, domus spirituales, sacerdotium sanctum, ad offerendas
spirituales hostias, acceptas Deo per Jesum Christum.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p12"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.i-p13"></span><span id="iv.iii.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p14"></span>After having taught the faithful that
they had been regenerated by the word of God, he now exhorts them to
lead a life corresponding with their birth. For if we live in the
Spirit, we ought also to walk in the Spirit, as Paul says. (<span
id="iv.iii.i-p14.1"></span>[Ga
5:25](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.iii.i-p14.1"></span>.) It is not, then, sufficient for us to have
been once called by the Lord, except we live as new creatures. This is
the meaning. But as to the words, the Apostle continues the same
metaphor. For as we have been born again, he requires from us a life
like that of infants; by which he intimates that we are to put off the
old man and his works. Hence this verse agrees with what Christ says,

<span id="iv.iii.i-p15"></span>“Except ye become like this little
child,  
ye shall not enter into the kingdom of God.”  
(<span id="iv.iii.i-p15.3"></span>[Mt
18:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iii.i-p15.3"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.i-p16"></span>*Infancy* is here set by Peter in
opposition to the ancientness of the flesh, which leads to corruption;
and under the word *milk,* he includes all the feelings of spiritual
life. For there is also in part a contrast between the vices which he
enumerates and the sincere milk of the word; as though he had said,
“Malice and hypocrisy belong to those who are habituated to the
corruptions of the world; they have imbibed these vices: what pertains
to infancy is sincere simplicity, free from all guile. Men, when grown
up, become imbued with envy, they learn to slander one another, they are
taught the arts of mischief; in short, they become hardened in every
kind of evil: infants, owing to their age, do not yet know what it is to
envy, to do mischief, or the like things.” He then compares the vices,
in which the oldness of the flesh indulges, to strong food; and milk is
called that way of living suitable to innocent nature and simple
infancy.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p17"></span>1. *All malice* There is not here a
complete enumeration of all those things which we ought to lay aside;
but when the Apostles speak of the old man, they lay down as examples
some of those vices which mark his whole character.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p18"></span>“Known,” says Paul, “are the works of the
flesh, which are these,” (<span id="iv.iii.i-p18.1"></span>[Ga
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iii.i-p18.1"></span>;)

<span id="iv.iii.i-p19"></span>and yet he does not enumerate them all;
but in those few things, as in a mirror, we may see that immense mass of
filth which proceeds from our flesh. So also in other passages, where he
refers to the new life, he touches only on a few things, by which we may
understand the whole character.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p20"></span>What, then, he says amounts to this, —
“Having laid aside the works of your former life, such as malice,
deceit, dissimulations, envyings, and other things of this kind, devote
yourselves to things of an opposite character, cultivate kindness,
honesty,” etc. He, in short, urges this, that new morals ought to follow
a new life.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p21"></span><span id="iv.iii.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p22"></span>**2.** *The sincere milk of the word*
This passage is commonly explained according to the rendering of
Erasmus, “Milk not for the body but for the soul;” as though the Apostle
reminded us by this expression that he spoke metaphorically. I rather
think that this passage agrees with that saying of Paul,

<span id="iv.iii.i-p23"></span>“Be ye not children in understanding, but
in malice.”  
(<span id="iv.iii.i-p23.2"></span>[1Co
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#020.md)<span
id="iv.iii.i-p23.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.i-p24"></span>That no one might think that infancy,
void of understanding and full of fatuity, was commended by him, he in
due time meets this objection; so he bids them to desire milk free from
guile, and yet mixed with right understanding. We now see for what
purpose he joins these two words, *rational and guileless,* (<span
id="iv.iii.i-p24.1"></span>λογικὸν καὶ ἄδολος.) For simplicity and
quickness of understanding are two things apparently opposite; but they
ought to be mixed together, lest simplicity should become insipid, and
lest malicious craftiness should creep in for want of understanding.
This mingling, well regulated, is according, to what Christ says,

<span id="iv.iii.i-p25"></span>“Be ye wise as serpents, and harmless as
doves.”  
(<span id="iv.iii.i-p25.2"></span>[Mt
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iii.i-p25.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.i-p26"></span>And thus is solved the question which
might have been otherwise raised.  <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md)

<span id="iv.iii.i-p28"></span>Paul reproves the Corinthians because
they were like children, and therefore they could not take strong food,
but were fed with milk. (<span id="iv.iii.i-p28.1"></span>[1Co
3:1](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#001)<span id="iv.iii.i-p28.1"></span>..md)
Almost the same words are found in <span id="iv.iii.i-p28.2"></span>[Heb
5:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#012.md)<span id="iv.iii.i-p28.2"></span>.
But in these passages those are compared to children who remain always
novices and ignorant scholars in the doctrine of religion, who continued
in the first elements, and never penetrated into the higher knowledge of
God. *Milk* is called the simpler mode of teaching, and one suitable to
children, when there is no progress made beyond the first rudiments.
Justly, then, does Paul charge this as a fault, as well as the author of
the Epistle to the Hebrews. But milk, here, is not elementary doctrine,
which one perpetually learns; and never comes to the knowledge of the
truth, but a mode of living which has the savor of the new birth, when
we surrender ourselves to be brought up by God. In the same manner
infancy is not set in opposition to manhood, or full age in Christ, as
Paul calls it in <span id="iv.iii.i-p28.3"></span>[Eph
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.iii.i-p28.3"></span>,
but to the ancientness of the flesh and of former life. Moreover, as the
infancy of the new life is perpetual, so Peter recommends milk as a
perpetual aliment, for he would have those nourished by it to grow.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p29"></span><span id="iv.iii.i-p29.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p30"></span>**3** *If so be that ye have tasted;* or,
*If indeed ye have tasted*. He alludes to <span
id="iv.iii.i-p30.1"></span>[Ps
34:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#008.md)<span id="iv.iii.i-p30.1"></span>,

<span id="iv.iii.i-p31"></span>“Taste and see that the Lord is good.”

<span id="iv.iii.i-p32"></span>But he says that this taste is to be had
in Christ, as, doubtless, our souls can find no rest anywhere but in
him. But he has drawn the ground of his exhortation from the goodness of
God, because his kindness, which we perceive in Christ, ought to allure
us; for what follows,

<span id="iv.iii.i-p33"></span><span id="iv.iii.i-p33.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p34"></span>*To whom coming,* is not to be referred
simply to God, but to him as he is revealed to us in the person of
Christ. Now, it cannot be but that the grace of God must powerfully draw
us to himself and inflame us with the love of him by whom we obtain a
real perception of it. If Plato affirmed this of his Beautiful, of which
a shadowy idea only he beheld afar off, much more true is this with
regard to God.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p35"></span>Let it then be noticed, that Peter
connects an access to God with the taste of his goodness. For as the
human mind necessarily dreads and shuns God, as long as it regards him
as rigid and severe; so, as soon as he makes known his paternal love to
the faithful, it immediately follows that they disregard all things and
even forget themselves and hasten to him. In short, he only makes
progress in the Gospel, who in heart comes to God.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p36"></span>But he also shews for what end and to
what purpose we ought to come to Christ, even that we may have him as
our foundation. For since he is constituted a stone, he ought to be so
to us, so that nothing should be appointed for him by the Father in vain
or to no purpose. But he obviates an offense when he allows that Christ
is rejected by men; for, as a great part of the world reject him, and
even many abhor him, he might for this reason be despised by us; for we
see that some of the ignorant are alienated from the Gospel, because it
is not everywhere popular, nor does it conciliate favor to its
professors. But Peter forbids us to esteem Christ the less, however
despised he may be by the world, because he, notwithstanding, retains
his own worth and honor before God.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p37"></span><span id="iv.iii.i-p37.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p38"></span>**5.** *Ye also, as lively* or *living
stones, are built up* The verb may be in the imperative as well as in
the indicative mood, for the termination in Greek is ambiguous. But in
whatever way it is taken, Peter no doubt meant to exhort the faithful to
consecrate themselves as a spiritual temple to God; for he aptly infers
from the design of our calling what our duty is. We must further
observe, that he constructs one house from the whole number of the
faithful. For though every one of us is said to be the temple of God,
yet all are united together in one, and must be joined together by
mutual love, so that one temple may be made of us all. Then, as it is
true that each one is a temple in which God dwells by his Spirit, so all
ought to be so fitted together, that they may form one universal temple.
This is the case when every one, content with his own measure, keeps
himself within the limits of his own duty; all have, however, something
to do with regard to others.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p39"></span>By calling us *living stones* and
*spiritual* building, as he had before said that Christ is a living
stone, he intimates a comparison between us and the ancient temple; and
this serves to amplify divine grace. For the same purpose is what he
adds as to *spiritual sacrifices* For by how much the more excellent is
the reality than the types, by so much the more all things excel in the
kingdom of Christ; for we have that heavenly exemplar, to which the
ancient sanctuary was conformable, and everything instituted by Moses
under the Law.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p40"></span>*A holy priesthood* It is a singular
honor, that God should not only consecrate us as a temple to himself, in
which he dwells and is worshipped, but that he should also make us
priests. But Peter mentions this double honor, in order to stimulate us
more effectually to serve and worship God. Of the spiritual sacrifices,
the first is the offering of ourselves, of which Paul speaks in <span
id="iv.iii.i-p40.1"></span>[Ro
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.iii.i-p40.1"></span>;
for we can offer nothing, until we offer to him ourselves as a
sacrifice; which is done by denying ourselves. Then, afterwards follow
prayers, thanksgiving, almsdeeds, and all the duties of religion.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p41"></span>*Acceptable to God.* It ought also to add
not a little to our alacrity, when we know that the worship we perform
to God is pleasing o him, as doubt necessarily brings sloth with it.
Here, then, is the third thing that enforces the exhortation; for he
declares that what is required is acceptable to God, lest fear should
make us slothful. Idolaters are indeed under the influence of great
fervor in their fictitious forms of worship; but it is so, because Satan
inebriates their minds, lest they should come to consider their works;
but whenever their consciences are led to examine things, they begin to
stagger. It is, indeed, certain that no one will seriously and from the
heart devote himself to God, until he is fully persuaded that he shall
not labor in vain.

<span id="iv.iii.i-p42"></span>But the Apostle adds, *through Jesus
Christ* There is never found in our sacrifices such purity, that they
are of themselves acceptable to God; our self-denial is never entire and
complete, our prayers are never so sincere as they ought to be, we are
never so zealous and so diligent in doing good, but that our works are
imperfect, and mingled with many vices. Nevertheless, Christ procures
favor for them. Then Peter here obviates that want of faith which we may
have respecting the acceptableness of our works, when he says, that they
are accepted, not for the merit of their own excellency, but through
Christ. And it ought to kindle the more the ardor of our efforts, when
we hear that God deals so indulgently with us, that in Christ he sets a
value on our works, which in themselves deserve nothing. At the same
time, the words, *by* or *through* *Christ,* may be fitly connected with
offering; for a similar phrase is found in <span
id="iv.iii.i-p42.1"></span>[Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.i-p42.1"></span>,

<span id="iv.iii.i-p43"></span>“Through him let us offer the sacrifice
of praise to God.”

<span id="iv.iii.i-p44"></span>The sense, however, will remain the same;
for we offer sacrifices through Christ, that they may be acceptable to
God.

<span id="iv.iii.ii"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p1"></span><span id="iv.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>[1 Peter
2:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006.md)<span id="iv.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p2"></span>**6.** Wherefore also it is contained in
the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect,
precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p3"></span>**6.** Propterea etiam continet
scriptura, Ecce pono in Sion lapidem angularem, electum, pretiosum, et
qui crediderit in illo, non pudefiet.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p4"></span>**7.** Unto you therefore which believe
*he is* precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which
the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p5"></span>**7.** Vobis ergo qui creditis,
pretiosus; incredulis vero, Lapis quem reprobaverunt aedificantes, hic
positus est in caput anguli;

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p6"></span>**8.** And a stone of stumbling, and a
rock of offence, *even to them* which stumble at the word, being
disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p7"></span>**8.** Et Lapis impactionis, et petra
offendiculi iis qui impingunt in Sermonem, nec credunt; in quod etiam
ordinati fuerant.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p8"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p9"></span><span id="iv.iii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p10"></span>**6** *Wherefore also it is contained in
Scripture;* or, *Wherefore also the Scripture contains*  <span
id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) They who refer the verb “contain” (<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p11.4"></span>περιέχειν) to Christ, and render it
“embrace,” because through him all these unite together, wholly depart
from the meaning of the Apostle. No better is another exposition, that
Christ excels others; for Peter simply intended to quote the testimony
of Scripture.  <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) He then shews what
had been taught by the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures, or, which is the
same thing, that what he adds is contained in them. Nor is it an
unsuitable confirmation of the preceding verse. For we see for what
slight reasons, and almost for none, many reject Christ, and some fall
away from him; but this is a stumblingblock which above all other things
stands in the way of some; they are drawn away, because not only the
common people despise and reject Christ, but also those who are high in
dignity and honor, and seem to excel others. This evil has almost ever
prevailed in the world, and at this day it prevails much; for a great
part of mankind judge of Christ according to the false opinion of the
world. Moreover, such is the ingratitude and impiety of men, that Christ
is everywhere despised. Thus it is, that while they regard one another,
few pay him his due honor. Hence Peter reminds us of what had been
foretold of Christ, lest the contempt or the rejection of him should
move us from the faith.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p13"></span>Now, the first passage, which he
adduces, is taken from <span id="iv.iii.ii-p13.1"></span>[Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p13.1"></span>; where the Prophet, after having inveighed
against the desperate wickedness of his own nation, at length adds,

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p14"></span>“Your perfidy shall not prevent God from
restoring his church, which now through you lies wholly in a ruinous
state.”  
(<span id="iv.iii.ii-p14.2"></span>[Isa
28:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p14.2"></span>)

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p15"></span>The manner of restoration he thus
describes, “I will lay in Sion a stone.” We hence learn that there is no
building up of the Church without Christ; for there is no other
foundation but he, as Paul testifies, (<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p15.1"></span>[1Co
3:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p15.1"></span>.) This is no matter of wonder, for all our
salvation is found only in him. Whosoever, then, turns away from him in
the least degree, will find his foundation a precipice.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p16"></span>Therefore the Prophet not only calls him
a corner-stone, which connects the whole edifice, but also a stone of
trial, according to which the building is to be measured and regulated;
and farther, he calls him a solid foundation, which sustains the whole
edifice. He is thus, then, a corner-stone, that he might be the rule of
the building, as well as the only foundation. But Peter took from the
words of the Prophet what was especially suitable to his argument, even
that he was a chosen stone, and in the highest degree valuable and
excellent, and also that on him we ought to build. This honor is
ascribed to Christ, that how much soever he may be despised by the
world, he may not be despised by us; for by God he is regarded as very
precious. But when he calls him a corner-stone, he intimates that those
have no concern for their salvation who do not recumb on Christ. What
some have refined on the word “corner,” as though it meant that Christ
joins together Jews and Gentiles, as two distinct walls, is not well
founded. Let us, then, be content with a simple explanation, that he is
so called, because the weight of the building rests on him.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p17"></span>We must further observe, that the
Prophet introduces God as the speaker, for he alone forms and plans his
own Church, as it is said in <span id="iv.iii.ii-p17.1"></span>[Ps
78:69](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#069.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p17.1"></span>, that his hand had founded Sion. He,
indeed, employs the labor and ministry of men in building it; but this
is not inconsistent with the truth that it is his own work. Christ,
then, is the foundation of our salvation, because he has been ordained
for this end by the Father.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p18"></span>And he says *in Sion,* because there
God’s spiritual temple was to have its beginning. That our faith,
therefore, may firmly rest on Christ, we must come to the Law and to the
Prophets. For though this stone extends to the extreme parts of the
world, it was yet necessary for it to be located first in Sion, for
there at that time was the seat of the Church. But it is said to have
been then set, when the Father revealed him for the purpose of restoring
his Church. In short, we must hold this, that those only rest on Christ,
who keep the unity of the Church, for he is not set as a
foundation-stone except in Sion. As from Sion the Church went forth,
which is now everywhere spread, so also from Sion our faith has derived
its beginning, as Isaiah says,

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p19"></span>“From Sion shall go forth the law,  
and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.” (<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p19.2"></span>[Isa
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#003.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p19.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p20"></span>Corresponding with this is what is said
in the Psalms,

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p21"></span>“The scepter of thy power will the Lord
send forth from Sion.” (<span id="iv.iii.ii-p21.1"></span>[Ps
110:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p21.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p22"></span>*He that believeth* The Prophet does not
say *in him,* but declares generally, “He that believeth shall not make
haste.” As, however, there is no doubt but that God sets forth Christ
there as the object of our faith, the faith of which the Prophet speaks
must look on him alone. And, doubtless, no one can rightly believe, but
he who is fully convinced that in Christ he ought wholly to trust.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p23"></span>But the words of the Prophet may be
taken in two ways, either as a promise or as an exhortation. The future
time is referred to, “He shall not make haste;” but in Hebrew the future
is often to be taken for an imperative, “Let him not make haste.” Thus
the meaning would be, “Be ye not moved in your minds, but quietly
entertain your desires, and check your feelings, until the Lord will be
pleased to fulfill his promise.” So he says in another place,

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p24"></span>“In silence and in quietness shall be
your strength,”  
(<span id="iv.iii.ii-p24.2"></span>[Isa
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa030.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p24.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p25"></span>But as the other reading seems to come
nearer to Peter’s interpretation, I give it the preference. Then the
sense would not be unsuitable, “He who believeth shall not waver” or
vacillate; for he has a firm and permanent foundation. And it is a
valuable truth, that relying on Christ, we are beyond the danger of
falling. Moreover, to be ashamed (<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p25.1"></span>*pudefieri*) means the same thing. Peter has
retained the real sense of the Prophet, though he has followed the Greek
version.  <span id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md)

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p27"></span><span id="iv.iii.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p28"></span>**7.** *Unto you therefore which
believe* God having pronounced Christ to be a precious and a chosen
stone, Peter draws the inference that he is so to us. For, no doubt,
Christ is there described such as we apprehend him by faith, and such as
he proves himself to be by real evidences. We ought, then, carefully to
notice this inference: Christ is a precious stone in the sight of God;
then he is such to the faithful. It is faith alone which reveals to us
the value and excellency of Christ.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p29"></span>But as the design of the Apostle was to
obviate the offense which the multitude of the ungodly creates, he
immediately adds another clause respecting the unbelieving, that by
rejecting Christ, they do not take away the honor granted him by the
Father. For this purpose a verse in <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p29.1"></span>[Ps
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p29.1"></span>, is quoted, that the stone which the
builders rejected, is become, nevertheless, the head of the corner. It
hence follows, that Christ, though opposed by his enemies, yet continues
in that dignity to which he has been appointed by the Father. But we
must take notice of the two things here said, — the first is, that
Christ was rejected by those who bore rule in the Church of God; and the
other, that their efforts were all in vain, because necessarily
fulfilled must have been what God had decreed, that is, that he, as the
corner-stone, should sustain the edifice.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p30"></span>Moreover, that this passage ought
properly to be understood of Christ, not only the Holy Spirit is a
witness, and Christ himself, who has thus explained it, (<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p30.1"></span>[Mt
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p30.1"></span>;) but it appears also evident from this,
that it was thus commonly understood before Christ came into the world;
nor is there a doubt but this exposition had been delivered as it were
from hand to hand from the fathers. We hence see that this was, as it
were, a common saying even among children respecting the Messiah. I
shall, therefore, no longer discuss this point. We may take it as
granted, that David was thus rejected by his own age, that he might
typify Christ.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p31"></span>Let us now, then, return to the first
clause: Christ was rejected by the builders. This was first shadowed
forth in David; for they who were in power counted him as condemned and
lost. The same was fulfilled in Christ; for they who ruled in the
Church, rejected him as far as they could. It might have greatly
disturbed the weak, when they saw that Christ’s enemies were so many,
even the priests, the elders, and teachers, in whom alone the Church was
conspicuously seen. In order to remove this offense, Peter reminded the
faithful that this very thing had been predicted by David. He especially
addressed the Jews, to whom this properly applied; at the same time,
this admonition is very useful at this day. For they who arrogate to
themselves the first place of authority in the Church, are Christ’s most
inveterate enemies, and with diabolical fury persecute his Gospel.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p32"></span>The Pope calls himself the vicar of
Christ, and yet we know how fiercely he opposes him. This spectacle
frightens the simple and ignorant. Why is this? even because they
consider not that what David has predicted happens now. Let us, then,
remember that not those only were by this prophecy warned who saw Christ
rejected by the Scribes and Pharisees; but that we are also by it
fortified against daily offenses, which might otherwise upset our faith.
Whenever then, we see those who glory in the title of prelates, rising
up against Christ, let it come to our minds, that the stone is rejected
by the builders, according to the prediction of David. And as the
metaphor of building is common, when political or spiritual government
is spoken of, so David calls them builders, to whom is committed the
care and power of governing; not because they build rightly, but because
they have the name of builders, and possess the ordinary power. It hence
follows, that those in office are not always God’s true and faithful
ministers. It is, therefore, extremely ridiculous in the Pope and his
followers to arrogate to themselves supreme and indubitable authority on
this sole pretense, that they are the ordinary governors of the Church.
In the first place, their vocation to govern the Church is in no way
more just or more legitimate than that of Heliogabalus to govern the
empire. But though we should allow them what they unblushingly claim,
that they are rightly called, yet we see what David declares respecting
the ordinary rulers of the Church, that they rejected Christ, so that
they built a stye for swine rather than a temple for God. The other part
follows, that all the great, proud of their power and dignity, shall not
prevail, so that Christ should not continue in his own place.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p33"></span>*And a stone of stumbling* After having
comforted the faithful, that they would have in Christ a firm and
permanent foundation, though the greater part, and even the chief men,
allowed him no place in the building, he now denounces the punishment
which awaits all the unbelieving, in order that they might be terrified
by their example. For this purpose he quotes the testimony of <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p33.1"></span>[Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p33.1"></span>. The Prophet there declares that the Lord
would be to the Jews a stone of stumbling and rock of offense. This
properly refers to Christ, as it may be seen from the context; and Paul
applies it to Christ, (<span id="iv.iii.ii-p33.2"></span>[Ro
9:32](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#032.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p33.2"></span>.) For in him the God of hosts has plainly
manifested himself.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p34"></span>Here, then, the terrible vengeance of
God is denounced on all the ungodly, because Christ would be to them an
offense and a stumbling, inasmuch as they refused to make him their
foundation. For as the firmness and stability of Christ is such that it
can sustain all who by faith recumb on him; so his hardness is so great
that it will break and tear in pieces all who resist him. For there is
no medium between these two things, — we must either build on him, or be
dashed against him.  <span id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md)

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p36"></span><span id="iv.iii.ii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p37"></span>**8** *Which stumble at the word* He
points out here the manner in which Christ becomes a stumbling, even
when men perversely oppose the word of God. This the Jews did; for
though they professed themselves willing to receive the Messiah, yet
they furiously rejected him when presented to them by God. The Papists
do the same in the present day; they worship only the name of Christ,
while they cannot endure the doctrine of the Gospel. Here Peter
intimates that all who receive not Christ as revealed in the Gospel, are
adversaries to God, and resist his word, and also that Christ is to none
for destruction, but to those who, through headstrong wickedness and
obstinacy, rush against the word of God.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p38"></span>And this is especially what deserves to
be noticed, lest our fault should be imputed to Christ; for, as he has
been given to us as a foundation, it is as it were an accidental thing
that he becomes a rock of offense. In short, his proper office is to
prepare us for a spiritual temple to God; but it is the fault of men
that they stumble at him, even because unbelief leads men to contend
with God. Hence Peter, in order to set forth the character of the
conflict, said that they were the unbelieving.

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p39"></span>*Whereunto also they were appointed,*
or, *to which they had been ordained*. This passage may be explained in
two ways. It is, indeed, certain that Peter spoke of the Jews; and the
common interpretation is, that they were appointed to believe, for the
promise of salvation was destined for them. But the other sense is
equally suitable, that they had been appointed to unbelief; as Pharaoh
is said to have been set up for this end, that he might resist God, and
all the reprobate are destined for the same purpose. And what inclines
me to this meaning is the particle <span id="iv.iii.ii-p39.1"></span>καὶ
(also) which is put in.  <span id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) If,
however, the first view be preferred, then it is a vehement upbraiding;
for Peter does hence enhance the sin of unbelief in the people who had
been chosen by God, because they rejected the salvation that had been
peculiarly ordained for them. And no doubt this circumstance rendered
them doubly inexcusable, that having been called in preference to
others, they had refused to hear God. But, by saying that they were
appointed to believe, he refers only to their outward call, even
according to the covenant which God had made generally with the whole
nation. At the same time their ingratitude, as it has been said, was
sufficiently proved, when they rejected the word preached to them.

<span id="iv.iii.iii"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p1"></span><span id="iv.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>[1

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p2"></span>**9.** But ye *are* a chosen generation,

but now have obtained mercy.

misericordiam consequuti estis.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p6"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p7"></span><span id="iv.iii.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p8"></span>**9** *But ye are a chosen generation,*
or *race*. He again separates them from the unbelieving, lest driven by
their example (as it is often the case) they should fall away from the
faith. As, then, it is unreasonable that those whom God has separated
from the world, should mix themselves with the ungodly, Peter here
reminds the faithful to what great honor they had been raised, and also
to what purpose they had been called. But with the same high titles
which he confers on them, Moses honored the ancient people, (<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p8.1"></span>[Ex
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p8.1"></span>;) but the Apostle’s object was to shew that
they had recovered again, through Christ, the great dignity and honor
from which they had fallen. It is at the same time true, that God gave
to the fathers an earthly taste only of these blessings, and that they
are really given in Christ.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p9"></span>The meaning then is, as though he had
said,

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p10"></span>“Moses called formerly your fathers a
holy nation, a priestly kingdom, and God’s peculiar people: all these
high titles do now far more justly belong to you; therefore you ought to
beware lest your unbelief should rob you of them.” (<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p10.1"></span>[Ex
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p10.1"></span>)

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p11"></span>In the meantime, however, as the
greater part of the nation was unbelieving, the Apostle indirectly sets
the believing Jews in opposition to all the rest, though they exceeded
them in number, as though he had said, that those only were the children
of Abraham, who believed in Christ, and that they only retained
possession of all the blessings which God had by a singular privilege
bestowed on the whole nation.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p12"></span>He calls them *a chosen race,* because
God, passing by others, adopted them as it were in a special manner.
They were also *a holy nation;* for God had consecrated them to himself,
and destined that they should lead a pure and holy life. He further
calls them *a peculiar people,* or, *a people for acquisition*, that
they might be to him a peculiar possession or inheritance; for I take
the words simply in this sense, that the Lord hath called us, that he
might possess us as his own, and devoted to him. This meaning is proved
by the words of Moses,

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p13"></span>“If ye keep my covenant, ye shall be to
me a peculiar treasure beyond all other nations.” (<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p13.1"></span>[Ex
19:5](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p13.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p14"></span>There is in the *royal priesthood* a
striking inversion of the words of Moses; for he says, “a priestly
kingdom,” but the same thing is meant. So what Peter intimated was this,
“Moses called your fathers a sacred kingdom, because the whole people
enjoyed as it were a royal liberty, and from their body were chosen the
priests; both dignities were therefore joined together: but now ye are
royal priests, and, indeed, in a more excellent way, because ye are,
each of you, consecrated in Christ, that ye may be the associates of his
kingdom, and partakers of his priesthood. Though, then, the fathers had
something like to what you have; yet ye far excel them. For after the
wall of partition has been pulled down by Christ, we are now gathered
from every nation, and the Lord bestows these high titles on all whom he
makes his people.”

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p15"></span>There is further, as to these benefits,
a contrast between us and the rest of mankind, to be considered: and
hence it appears more fully how incomparable is God’s goodness towards
us; for he sanctifies us, who are by nature polluted; he chose us, when
he could find nothing in us but filth and vileness; he makes his
peculiar possession from worthless dregs; he confers the honor of the
priesthood on the profane; he brings the vassals of Satan, of sin, and
of death, to the enjoyment of royal liberty.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p16"></span>*That ye should shew forth,* or
*declare*. He carefully points out the end of our calling, that he might
stimulate us to give the glory to God. And the sum of what he says is,
that God has favored us with these immense benefits and constantly
manifests them, that his glory might by us be made known: for by
*praises,* or virtues, he understands wisdom, goodness, power,
righteousness, and everything else, in which the glory of God shines
forth. And further, it behoves us to declare these virtues or
excellencies not only by our tongue, but also by our whole life. This
doctrine ought to be a subject of daily meditation, and it ought to be
continually remembered by us, that all God’s blessings with which he
favors us are intended for this end, that his glory may be proclaimed by
us.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p17"></span>We must also notice what he says, that
we have been *called out of darkness into God’s marvellous* or
*wonderful* *light*; for by these words he amplifies the greatness of
divine grace. If the Lord had given us light while we were seeking it,
it would have been a favor; but it was a much greater favor, to draw us
out of the labyrinth of ignorance and the abyss of darkness. We ought
hence to learn what is man’s condition, before he is translated into the
kingdom of God. And this is what Isaiah says,

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p18"></span>“Darkness shall cover the earth, and
gross darkness the people; but over thee shall the Lord be seen, and his
glory shall in thee shine forth.” (<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p18.1"></span>[Isa
60:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p18.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p19"></span>And truly we cannot be otherwise than
sunk in darkness, after having departed from God, our only light. See
more at large on this subject in the second chapter of the Epistle to
the Ephesians.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p20"></span><span id="iv.iii.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p21"></span>**10** *Which in time past were not a
people* He brings for confirmation a passage from Hosea, and well
accommodates it to his own purpose. For Hosea, after having in God’s
name declared that the Jews were repudiated, gives them a hope of a
future restoration. Peter reminds us that this was fulfilled in his own
age; for the Jews were scattered here and there, as the torn members of
a body; nay, they seemed to be no longer God’s people, no worship
remained among them, they were become entangled in the corruptions of
the heathens; it could not then be said otherwise of them, but that they
were repudiated by the Lord. But when they are gathered in Christ, from
no people they really become the people of God. Paul, in <span
id="iv.iii.iii-p21.1"></span>[Ro
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#026.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p21.1"></span>, applies also this prophecy to the
Gentiles, and not without reason; for from the time the Lord’s covenant
was broken, from which alone the Jews derived their superiority, they
were put on a level with the Gentiles. It hence follows, that what God
had promised, to make a people of no people, belongs in common to both.

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p22"></span>*Which had not obtained mercy* This was
added by the Prophet, in order that the gratuitous covenant of God, by
which he takes them to be his people, might be more clearly set forth;
as though he had said, “There is no other reason why the Lord counts us
his people, except that he, having mercy on us, graciously adopts us.”
It is then God’s gratuitous goodness, which makes of no people a people
to God, and reconciles the alienated.  <span

they may by *your* good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in
the day of visitation.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p5"></span>**12**. Conversationem vestram inter

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p7"></span><span id="iv.iii.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p8"></span>**11** *As strangers,* or *sojourners*.
There are two parts to this exhortation, — that their souls were to be
free within from wicked and vicious lusts; and also, that they were to
live honestly among men, and by the example of a good life not only to
confirm the godly, but also to gain over the unbelieving to God.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p9"></span>And first, to call them away from the
indulgence of carnal lusts, he employs this argument, that they were
sojourners and strangers. And he so calls them, not because they were
banished from their country, and scattered into various lands, but
because the children of God, wherever they may be, are only guests in
this world. In the former sense, indeed, he called them sojourners at
the beginning of the Epistle, as it appears from the context; but what
he says here is common to them all. For the lusts of the flesh hold us
entangled, when in our minds we dwell in the world, and think not that
heaven is our country; but when we pass as strangers through this life,
we are not in bondage to the flesh.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p10"></span>By the *lusts* or *desires* *of the
flesh* he means not only those gross concupiscences which we have in
common with animals, as the Sophists hold, but also all those sinful
passions and affections of the soul, to which we are by nature guided
and led. For it is certain that every thought of the flesh, that is, of
unrenewed nature, is enmity against God. (<span
id="iv.iii.iv-p10.1"></span>[Ro
8:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#007.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iv-p10.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p11"></span>*Which war against the soul* Here is
another argument, that they could not comply with the desires of the
flesh, except to their own ruin. For he refers not here to the contest
described by Paul in <span id="iv.iii.iv-p11.1"></span>[Ro
7:14-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iv-p11.1"></span>, and in <span
id="iv.iii.iv-p11.2"></span>[Ga
5:17-26](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iv-p11.2"></span>, as he makes the soul to be an antagonist
to the flesh: but what he says here is, that the desires of the flesh,
whenever the soul consents to them, lead to perdition. He proves our
carelessness in this respect, that while we anxiously shun enemies from
whom we apprehend danger to the body, we willingly allow enemies hurtful
to the soul to destroy us; nay, we as it were stretch forth our neck to
them.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p12"></span><span id="iv.iii.iv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p13"></span>**12** *Your conversation* The second
part of the exhortation is, that they were to conduct themselves
honestly towards men. What, indeed, precedes this in order is, that
their minds should be cleansed before God; but a regard should also be
had to men, lest we should become a hindrance to them. And he expressly
says *among the Gentiles;* for the Jews were not only hated everywhere,
but were also almost abhorred. The more carefully, therefore, ought they
to have labored to wipe off the odium and infamy attached to their name
by a holy life and a well-regulated conduct.  <span
id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) For that admonition of Paul ought to be
attended to, “To give no occasion to those who seek occasion.” Therefore
the evil speakings and the wicked insinuations of the ungodly ought to
stimulate us to lead an upright life; for it is no time for living
listlessly and securely, when they sharply watch us in order to find out
whatever we do amiss.

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p15"></span>*That they* — *may glorify God* He
intimates that we ought thus to strive, not for our own sake, that men
may think and speak well of us; but that we may glorify God, as Christ
also teaches us. And Peter shews how this would be effected, even that
the unbelieving, led by our good works, would become obedient to God,
and thus by their own conversion give glory to him; for this he
intimates by the words, *in the day of visitation.* I know that some
refer this to the last coming of Christ; but I take it otherwise, even
that God employs the holy and honest life of his people, as a
preparation, to bring back the wandering to the right way. For it is the
beginning of our conversion, when God is pleased to look on us with a
paternal eye; but when his face is turned away from us, we perish. Hence
the day of visitation may justly be said to be the time when he invites
us to himself.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p11"></span><span id="iv.iii.v-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.v-p12"></span>**13** *Submit yourselves* He now comes
to particular exhortations: and as obedience with regard to magistrates
is a part of honest or good conversation, he draws this inference as to
their duty, “Submit yourselves,” or, Be ye subject; for by refusing the
yoke of government, they would have given to the Gentiles no small
occasion for reproaching them. And, indeed, the Jews were especially
hated and counted infamous for this reason, because they were regarded
on account of their perverseness as ungovernable. And as the commotions
which they raised up in the provinces, were causes of great calamities,
so that every one of a quiet and peaceable disposition dreaded them as
the plague, — this was the reason that induced Peter to speak so
strongly on subjection. Besides, many thought the gospel was a
proclamation of such liberty, that every one might deem himself as free
from servitude. It seemed an unworthy thing that God’s children should
be servants, and that the heirs of the world should not have a free
possession, no, not even of their own bodies. Then there was another
trial, — All the magistrates were Christ’s adversaries; and they used
their own authority, so that no representation of God, which secures the
chief reverence, appeared in them. We now perceive the design of Peter:
he exhorted the Jews, especially for these reasons, to shew respect to
the civil power.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p13"></span>*To every ordinance of man* Some render
the words, “to every creature;” and from a rendering so obscure and
ambiguous, much labor has been taken to elicit some meaning. But I have
no doubt but that Peter meant to point out the distinct manner in which
God governs mankind: for the verb <span
id="iv.iii.v-p13.1"></span>κτίζειν in Greek, from which <span
id="iv.iii.v-p13.2"></span>κτίσις comes, means to form and to construct
a building. Suitable, then, is the word “ordination;” by which Peter
reminds us, that God the maker of the world has not left the human race
in a state of confusion, that they might live after the manner of
beasts, but as it were in a building regularly formed, and divided into
several compartments. And it is called a *human ordination,* not because
it has been invented by man, but because a mode of living, well arranged
and duly ordered, is peculiar to men.  <span
id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md)

<span id="iv.iii.v-p15"></span>*Whether it be to the king* So he calls
Caesar, as I think, whose empire extended over all those countries
mentioned at the beginning of the Epistle. For though “king” was a name
extremely hated by the Romans, yet it was in use among the Greeks. They,
indeed, often called him autocrat, (<span
id="iv.iii.v-p15.1"></span>αὐτοκράτορα) but sometimes he was also called
by them king, (<span id="iv.iii.v-p15.2"></span>βασιλεὺς.) But as he
subjoins a reason, that he ought to be obeyed because he excelled, or
was eminent or supreme, there is no comparison made between Caesar and
other magistrates. He held, indeed, the supreme power; but that eminence
which Peter extols, is common to all who exercise public authority. And
so Paul, in <span id="iv.iii.v-p15.3"></span>[Ro
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001.md)<span id="iv.iii.v-p15.3"></span>,
extends it to all magistrates. Now the meaning is, that obedience is due
to all who rule, because they have been raised to that honor not by
chance, but by God’s providence. For many are wont to inquire too
scrupulously by what right power has been attained; but we ought to be
satisfied with this alone, that power is possessed and exercised. And so
Paul cuts off the handle of useless objections when he declares that
there is no power but from God. And for this reason it is that Scripture
so often says, that it is God who girds kings with a sword, who raises
them on high, who transfers kingdoms as he pleases.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p16"></span>As Peter referred especially to the Roman
Emperor, it was necessary to add this admonition; for it is certain that
the Romans through unjust means rather than in a legitimate way
penetrated into Asia and subdued these countries. Besides, the Caesars,
who then reigned, had possessed themselves of the monarchy by tyrannical
force. Hence Peter as it were forbids these things to be controverted,
for he shews that subjects ought to obey their rulers without
hesitation, because they are not made eminent, unless elevated by God’s
hand.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p17"></span><span id="iv.iii.v-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.v-p18"></span>**14** *Or unto governors,* or, *Whether
to presidents*. He designates every kind of magistrates, as though he
had said, that there is no kind of government to which we ought not to
submit. He confirms this by saying that they are God’s ministers; for
they who apply *him* to the king, are greatly mistaken. There is then a
common reason, which extols the authority of all magistrates, that they
rule by the command of God, and are sent by him. It hence follows (as
Paul also teaches us) that they resist God, who do not obediently submit
to a power ordained by him.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p19"></span>*For the punishment* This is the second
reason why it behoves us reverently to regard and to respect civil
authority, and that is, because it has been appointed by the Lord for
the common good of mankind; for we must be extremely barbarous and
brutal, if the public good is not regarded by us. This, then, in short,
is what Peter means, that since God keeps the world in order by the
ministry of magistrates, all they who despise their authority are
enemies to mankind.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p20"></span>Now he assumes these two things, which
belong, as Plato says, to a commonwealth, that is, reward to the good
and punishment to the wicked; for, in ancient times, not only punishment
was allotted to evil-doers, but also rewards to the doers of good. But
though it often happens that honors are not rightly distributed, nor
rewards given to the deserving, yet it is an honor, not to be despised,
that the good are at the least under the care and protection of
magistrates, that they are not exposed to the violence and injuries of
the ungodly, that they live more quietly under laws and better retain
their reputation, than if every one, unrestrained, lived as he pleased.
In short, it is a singular blessing of God, that the wicked are not
allowed to do what they like.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p21"></span>It may, however, be objected here and
said, that kings and magistrates often abuse their power, and exercise
tyrannical cruelty rather than justice. Such were almost all the
magistrates, when this Epistle was written. To this I answer, that
tyrants and those like them, do not produce such effects by their abuse,
but that the ordinance of God ever remains in force, as the institution
of marriage is not subverted though the wife and the husband were to act
in a way not becoming them. However, therefore, men may go astray, yet
the end fixed by God cannot be changed.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p22"></span>Were any one again to object and say,
that we ought not to obey princes who, as far as they can, pervert the
holy ordinance of God, and thus become savage wild beasts, while
magistrates ought to bear the image of God. My reply is this, that
government established by God ought to be so highly valued by us, as to
honor even tyrants when in power. There is yet another reply still more
evident, — that there has never been a tyranny, (nor can one be
imagined,) however cruel and unbridled, in which some portion of equity
has not appeared; and further, some kind of government, however deformed
and corrupt it may be, is still better and more beneficial than anarchy.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p23"></span><span id="iv.iii.v-p23.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.v-p24"></span>**15** *For so is the will of God* He
returns to his former doctrine, lest an occasion should be given to the
unbelieving to speak evil, though he expresses less than what he had
said before; for he says only that the mouths of the foolish ought to be
stopped. The phrase which he adopts, “to stop up ignorance,” though it
may seem harsh on account of its novelty, does not yet obscure the
sense.  <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) For he not only calls the
unbelieving foolish, but also points out the reason why they slandered,
even because they were ignorant of God. But inasmuch as he makes the
unbelieving to be without understanding and reason, we hence conclude,
that a right understanding cannot exist without the knowledge of God.
How much soever, then, the unbelieving may boast of their own acuteness,
and may seem to themselves to be wise and prudent, yet the Spirit of God
charges them with folly, in order that we may know that, apart from God,
we cannot be really wise, as without him there is nothing perfect.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p26"></span>But he prescribes the way in which the
evil-speaking of the unbelieving is to be restrained, even by
*well-doing,* or, *by doing good*. In this expression he includes all
the duties of humanity and kindness which we ought to perform towards
our neighbors. And in these is included obedience to magistrates,
without which concord among men cannot be cultivated. Were any one to
object and say, that the faithful can never be so careful to do good,
but that they will be evil-spoken of by the unbelieving: to this the
obvious answer is, that the Apostle here does not in any degree exempt
them from calumnies and reproaches; but he means that no occasion of
slandering ought to be given to the unbelieving, however much they may
desire it. And lest any one should further object and say, that the
unbelieving are by no means worthy of so much regard that God’s children
should form their life to please them, Peter expressly reminds us that
we are bound by God’s command to shut up their mouths.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p27"></span><span id="iv.iii.v-p27.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.v-p28"></span>**16** *As free* This is said by way of
anticipation, that he might obviate those things which are usually
objected to with regard to the liberty of God’s children. For as men are
naturally ingenious in laying hold on what may be for their advantage,
many, at the commencement of the Gospel, thought themselves free to live
only for themselves. This doting opinion, then, is what Peter corrects;
and he briefly shews how much the liberty of Christians differed from
unbridled licentiousness. And, in the first place, he denies that there
is any veil or pretext for wickedness, by which he intimates, that there
is no liberty given us to hurt our neighbors, or to do any harm to
others. True liberty, then, is that which harms or injures no one. To
confirm this, he declares that those are free who serve God. It is
obvious, hence, to conclude, that we obtain liberty, in order that we
may more promptly and more readily render obedience to God; for it is no
other than a freedom from sin; and dominion is taken away from sin, that
men may become obedient to righteousness.

<span id="iv.iii.v-p29"></span>In short, it is a free servitude, and a
serving freedom. For as we ought to be the servants of God, that we may
enjoy this benefit, so moderation is required in the use of it. In this
way, indeed, our consciences become free; but this prevents us not to
serve God, who requires us also to be subject to men.

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p5"></span><span id="iv.iii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p6"></span>This is a summary of what is gone before;
for he intimates that God is not feared, nor their just right rendered
to men, except civil order prevails among us, and magistrates retain
their authority. That he bids honor to be rendered to all, I explain
thus, that none are to be neglected; for it is a general precept, which
refers to the social intercourse of men.  <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) The word *honor* has a wide meaning in
Hebrew, and we know that the apostles, though they wrote in Greek,
followed the meaning of words in the former language. Therefore, this
word conveys no other idea to me, than that a regard ought to be had for
all, since we ought to cultivate, as far as we can, peace and friendship
with all; there is, indeed, nothing more adverse to concord than
contempt.

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p8"></span>What he adds respecting the *love of
brethren* is special, as contrasted with the first clause; for he speaks
of that particular love which we are bidden to have towards the
household of faith, because we are connected with them by a closer
relationship. And so Peter did not omit this connection; but yet he
reminds us, that though brethren are to be specially regarded, yet this
ought not to prevent our love from being extended to the whole human
race. The word *fraternity,* or brotherhood, I take collectively for
*brethren*.

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p9"></span>*Fear God* I have already said that all
these clauses are applied by Peter to the subject he was treating. For
he means, that honor paid to kings proceeds from the fear of God and the
love of man; and that, therefore, it ought to be connected with them, as
though he had said, “Whosoever fears God, loves his brethren and the
whole human race as he ought, and will also give honor to kings.” But,
at the same time, he expressly mentions *the king,* because that form of
government was more than any other disliked; and under it other forms
are included.

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p9"></span><span id="iv.iii.vii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p10"></span>**18** *Servants, be subject* Though
this is a particular admonition, yet it is connected with what is gone
before, as well as the other things which follow; for the obedience of
servants to masters, and of wives also to their husbands, forms a part
of civil or social subjection.  <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md)

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p12"></span>He first would have servants to be
subject *with all fear;* by which expression he means that sincere and
willing reverence, which they acknowledge by their office to be due. He
then sets this fear in opposition to dissimulation as well as to forced
subjection; for an eye-service (<span
id="iv.iii.vii-p12.1"></span>ὀφθαλμοδουλεία, <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p12.2"></span>[Col
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.iii.vii-p12.2"></span>,) as Paul calls it, is the opposite of
this fear; and further, if servants clamor against severe treatment,
being ready to throw off the yoke if they could, they cannot be said
properly to fear. In short, fear arises from a right knowledge of duty.
And though no exception is added in this place, yet, according to other
places, it is to be understood. For subjection due to men is not to be
so far extended as to lessen the authority of God. Then servants are to
be subject to their masters, only as far as God permits, or as far as
the altars, as they say. But as the word here is not <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p12.3"></span>δοῦλοι, *slaves*, but <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p12.4"></span>οἰκέται*, domestics*, we may understand the
free as well as the bond servants to be meant, though it be a difference
of little moment.

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p13"></span>*Not only to the good* Though as to the
duty of servants to obey their masters, it is wholly a matter of
conscience; if, however, they are unjustly treated, as to themselves,
they ought not to resist authority. Whatever, then, masters may be,
there is no excuse for servants for not faithfully obeying them. For
when a superior abuses his power, he must indeed hereafter render an
account to God, yet he does not for the present lose his right. For this
law is laid on servants, that they are to serve their masters, though
they may be unworthy. For *the froward* he sets in opposition to the
equitable or humane; and by this word he refers to the cruel and the
perverse, or those who have no humanity and kindness.  <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md)

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p15"></span>It is a wonder what could have induced
an interpreter to change one Greek word for another, and render it
“wayward.” I should say nothing of the gross ignorance of the Sorbons,
who commonly understand by wayward, (<span
id="iv.iii.vii-p15.1"></span>*dyscolos*,) the dissolute or dissipated,
were it not that they seek by this absurd rendering to build up for us
an article of faith, that we ought to obey the Pope and his horned wild
beasts, however grievous and intolerable a tyranny they may exercise.
This passage, then, shews how boldly they trifle with the Word of God.

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p16"></span><span id="iv.iii.vii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p17"></span>**19** *For this is thankworthy* The
word grace or favor, has the meaning of praise; for he means that no
grace or praise shall be found before God, if we bear the punishment
which we have by our faults deserved; but that they who patiently bear
injuries and wrongs are worthy of praise and accepted by God.  <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) To testify that it was acceptable to God,
when any one from conscience towards God persevered in doing his duty,
though unjustly and unworthily treated, was at that time very necessary;
for the condition of servants was very hard: they were counted no better
than cattle. Such indignity might have driven them to despair; the only
thing left for them was to look to God.

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p19"></span>*For conscience towards God* means
this, that one performs his duty, not from a regard to men, but to God.
For, when a wife is submissive and obedient to her husband, in order to
please him, she has her reward in this world, as Christ says of the
ambitious, who looked to the praise of men, (<span
id="iv.iii.vii-p19.1"></span>[Mt
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#016.md)<span
id="iv.iii.vii-p19.1"></span>.) The same view is to be taken of other
cases: When a son obeys his father in order to secure his favor and
bounty, he will have his reward from his father, not from God. It is, in
short, a general truth, that what we do is approved by God, if our
object be to serve him, and if we are not influenced by a regard to man
alone. Moreover, he who considers that he has to do with God, must
necessarily endeavor to overcome evil with good. For, God not only
requires that we should be such to every one as he is to us, but also
that we should be good to the unworthy and to such as persecute us.

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p20"></span><span id="iv.iii.vii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p21"></span>It is not, however, an assertion
without its difficulty, when he says, that *there is nothing
praiseworthy in him who is justly punished*; for, when the Lord punishes
our sins, patience is certainly a sacrifice of sweet odour to him, that
is, when we bear with a submissive mind our punishment. But to this I
reply, that Peter does not here speak simply but comparatively; for it
is a small and slender praise to bear with submission a just punishment,
in comparison with that of an innocent man, who willingly bears the
wrongs of men, only because he fears God. At the same time he seems
indirectly to refer to the motive; because they who suffer punishment
for their faults, are influenced by the fear of men. But the reply
already given is sufficient.

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p2"></span>**21**. For even hereunto were ye

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p3"></span>**21**. In hoc enim vocati estis;

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p5"></span>**22**. Qui quum peccatum non fecisset,
nec inventus esset dolus in ore ejus;

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p6"></span>**23**. Who, when he was reviled,
reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed
*himself* to him that judgeth righteously:

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p7"></span>**23**. Quum probro afficeretur, non
regerebat; quum pateretur, non comminabatur; causam vero commendabat ei
qui juste judicat.

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p8"></span> 

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p9"></span><span id="iv.iii.viii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p10"></span>**21** *For even hereunto were ye
called* For though his discourse was respecting servants, yet this
passage ought not to be confined to that subject. For the Apostle here
reminds all the godly in common as to what the condition of Christianity
is, as though he had said, that we are called by the Lord for this end,
patiently to bear wrongs; and as he says in another place that we are
appointed to this. Lest, however, this should seem grievous to us, he
consoles us with the example of Christ. Nothing seems more unworthy, and
therefore less tolerable, than undeservedly to suffer; but when we turn
our eyes to the Son of God, this bitterness is mitigated; for who would
refuse to follow him going before us?

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p11"></span>But we must notice the words, *Leaving
us an example*  <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) For as he treats of
imitation, it is necessary to know what in Christ is to be our example.
He walked on the sea, he cleansed the leprous, he raised the dead, he
restored sight to the blind: to try to imitate him in these things would
be absurd. For when he gave these evidences of his power, it was not his
object that we should thus imitate him. It has hence happened that his
fasting for forty days has been made without reason an example; but what
he had in view was far otherwise. We ought, therefore, to exercise in
this respect a right judgment; as also Augustine somewhere reminds us,
when explaining the following passage,

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p13"></span>“Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly
in heart.”  
(<span id="iv.iii.viii-p13.2"></span>[Mt
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iii.viii-p13.2"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p14"></span>And the same thing may be learnt from
the words of Peter; for he marks the difference by saying that Christ’s
patience is what we ought to follow. This subject is handled more at
large by Paul in <span id="iv.iii.viii-p14.1"></span>[Ro
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md)<span
id="iv.iii.viii-p14.1"></span>, where he teaches us that all the
children of God are foreordained to be made conformable to the image of
Christ, in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren.
Hence, that we may live with him, we must previously die with him.

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p15"></span><span id="iv.iii.viii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p16"></span>**22** *Who did no sin* This belongs
to the present subject; for, if any one boasts of his own innocence, he
must know that Christ did not suffer as a malefactor. He, at the same
time, shews how far we come short of what Christ was, when he says, that
there was *no guile found in his mouth;* for he who offends not by his
tongue, says James, is a perfect man. (<span
id="iv.iii.viii-p16.1"></span>[Jas
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#002.md)<span
id="iv.iii.viii-p16.1"></span>.) He then declares that there was in
Christ the highest perfection of innocency, such as no one of us can
dare claim for himself. It hence appears more fully how unjustly he
suffered beyond all others. There is, therefore, no reason why any one
of us should refuse to suffer after his example, since no one is so
conscious of having acted rightly, as not to know that he is imperfect.

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p17"></span><span id="iv.iii.viii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p18"></span>**23** *When he was reviled,* or,
*reproached*. Here Peter points out what we are to imitate in Christ,
even calmly to bear wrongs, and not to avenge wrongs. For such is our
disposition, that when we receive injuries, our minds immediately boil
over with revengeful feelings; but Christ abstained from every kind of
retaliation. Our minds, therefore, ought to be bridled, lest we should
seek to render evil for evil.

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p19"></span>*But committed himself*, or, *his
cause*. The word *cause* is not expressed, but it is obviously
understood. And Peter adds this for the consolation of the godly, that
is, that if they patiently endured the reproaches and violence of the
wicked, they would have God as their defender. For it would be a very
hard thing for us, to be subjected to the will of the ungodly, and not
to have God caring for our wrongs. Peter, therefore, adorns God with
this high attribute, that he *judgeth righteously,* as though he had
said, “It behoves us calmly to bear evils; God in the meantime will not
neglect what belongs to him, but will shew himself to be a righteous
judge.” However wanton then the ungodly may be for a time, yet they
shall not be unpunished for the wrongs done now to the children of God.
Nor is there any cause for the godly to fear, as though they were
without any protection; for since it belongs to God to defend them and
to undertake their cause, they are to possess their souls in patience.

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p20"></span>Moreover, as this doctrine brings no
small consolation, so it avails to allay and subdue the inclinations of
the flesh. For no one can recumb on the fidelity and protection of God,
but he who in a meek spirit waits for his judgment; for he who leaps to
take vengeance, intrudes into what belongs to God, and suffers not God
to perform his own office. In reference to this Paul says, “Give place
to wrath,” (<span id="iv.iii.viii-p20.1"></span>[Ro
12:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019.md)<span
id="iv.iii.viii-p20.1"></span>;) and thus he intimates that the way is
closed up against God that he might not himself judge, when we
anticipate him. He then confirms what he had said by the testimony of
Moses, “Vengeance is mine.” (<span id="iv.iii.viii-p20.2"></span>[De
32:35](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#035.md)<span
id="iv.iii.viii-p20.2"></span>.) Peter in short meant this, that we
after the example of Christ shall be more prepared to endure injuries,
if we give to God his own honor, that is, if we, believing him to be a
righteous judge, refer our right and our cause to him.

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p21"></span>It may however be asked, How did
Christ commit his cause to the Father; for if he required vengeance from
him, this he himself says is not lawful for us; for he bids us to do
good to those who injure us, to pray for those who speak evil of us.
(<span id="iv.iii.viii-p21.1"></span>[Mt
5:44](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044.md)<span
id="iv.iii.viii-p21.1"></span>.) To this my reply is, that it appears
evident from the gospel-history, that Christ did thus refer his judgment
to God, and yet did not demand vengeance to be taken on his enemies, but
that, on the contrary, he prayed for them, “Father,” he said, “forgive
them.” (<span id="iv.iii.viii-p21.2"></span>[Lu
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034.md)<span
id="iv.iii.viii-p21.2"></span>.) And doubtless the feelings of our flesh
are far from being in unison with the judgment of God. That any one then
may commit his cause to him who judgeth righteously, it is necessary
that he should first lay a check on himself, so that he may not ask
anything inconsistent with the righteous judgment of God. For they who
indulge themselves in looking for vengeance, concede not to God his
office of a judge, but in a manner wish him to be an executioner. He
then who is so calm in his spirit as to wish his adversaries to become
his friends, and endeavors to bring them to the right way, rightly
commits to God his own cause, and his prayer is, “Thou, O Lord, knowest
my heart, how I wish them to be saved who seek to destroy me: were they
converted, I should congratulate them; but if they continue obstinate in
their wickedness, for I know that thou watchest over my safety, I commit
my cause to thee.” This meekness was manifested by Christ; it is then
the rule to be observed by us.

restored us to life; it hence follows, that we are so bound to him, that
we ought cheerfully to follow his example. In the third place, he refers
to the general design of his death, that we, being dead to sins, ought
to live to righteousness. And all these things confirm his previous
exhortation.

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p9"></span>**24** *Who his own self bare our sins*
This form of speaking is fitted to set forth the efficacy of Christ’s
death. For as under the Law, the sinner, that he might be released from
guilt, substituted a victim in his own place; so Christ took on himself
the curse due to our sins, that he might atone for them before God. And
he expressly adds, *on the tree,* because he could not offer such an
expiation except on the cross. Peter, therefore, well expresses the
truth, that Christ’s death was a sacrifice for the expiation of our
sins; for being fixed to the cross and offering himself a victim for us,
he took on himself our sin and our punishment. Isaiah, from whom Peter
has taken the substance of his doctrine, employs various forms of
expression, — that he was smitten by God’s hand for our sins, that he
was wounded for our iniquities, that he was afflicted and broken for our
sake, that the chastisement of our peace was laid on him. But Peter
intended to set forth the same thing by the words of this verse, even
that we are reconciled to God on this condition, because Christ made
himself before his tribunal a surety and as one guilty for us, that he
might suffer the punishment due to us.

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p10"></span>This great benefit the Sophists in their
schools obscure as much as they can; for they prattle that by the
sacrifice of the death of Christ we are only freed after baptism from
guilt, but that punishment is redeemed by satisfactions. But Peter, when
he says that he bore our sins, means that not only guilt was imputed to
him, but that he also suffered its punishment, that he might thus be an
expiatory victim, according to that saying of the Prophet, “The
chastisement of our peace was upon him.” If they object and say, that
this only avails before baptism, the context here disproves them, for
the words are addressed to the faithful.

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p11"></span>But this clause and that which follows,
*by whose stripes ye were healed,* may be also applied to the subject in
hand, that is, that it behoves us to bear on our shoulders the sins of
others, not indeed to expiate for them, but only to bear them as a
burden laid on us.

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p12"></span>*Being dead to sins*  <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) He had before pointed out another end,
even an example of patience; but here, as it has been stated, it is made
more manifest, that we are to live a holy and righteous life. The
Scripture sometimes mentions both, that is, that the Lord tries us with
troubles and adversities, that we might be conformed to the death of
Christ, and also that the old man has been crucified in the death of
Christ, that we might walk in newness of life. (<span
id="iv.iii.ix-p13.2"></span>[Php
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ix-p13.2"></span>; <span id="iv.iii.ix-p13.3"></span>[Ro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ix-p13.3"></span>.) At the same time, this end of which he
speaks, differs from the former, not only as that which is general from
what is particular; for in patience there is simply an example; but when
he says that Christ suffered, that we being dead to sins should live to
righteousness, he intimates that there is power in Christ’s death to
mortify our flesh, as Paul explains more fully in <span
id="iv.iii.ix-p13.4"></span>[Ro
6:6-14](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ix-p13.4"></span>. For he has not only brought this great
benefit to us, that God justifies us freely, by not imputing to us our
sins; but he also makes us to die to the world and to the flesh, that we
may rise again to a new life: not that one day makes complete this
death; but wherever it is, the death of Christ is efficacious for the
expiation of sins, and also for the mortification of the flesh.

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p14"></span><span id="iv.iii.ix-p14.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p15"></span>**25** *For ye were as sheep* This also
has Peter borrowed from Isaiah, except that the Prophet makes it a
universal statement,

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p16"></span>“All we like sheep have gone astray.”
(<span id="iv.iii.ix-p16.1"></span>[Isa
53:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ix-p16.1"></span>.)

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p17"></span>But on the word *sheep* there is no
particular stress; he indeed compares us to sheep, but the emphasis is
on what the Prophet adds, when he says that every one had turned to his
own way. The meaning then is, that we are all going astray from the way
of salvation, and proceeding in the way of ruin, until Christ brings us
back from this wandering.

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p18"></span>And this appears still more evident from
the clause which follows, *but are now returned to the Shepherd, etc.*;
 <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) for all who are not ruled by
Christ, are wandering like lost sheep in the ways of error. Thus, then,
is condemned the whole wisdom of the world, which does not submit to the
government of Christ. But the two titles given here to Christ are
remarkable, that he is *the Shepherd and Bishop of souls* There is then
no cause to fear, but that he will faithfully watch over the safety of
those who are in his fold and under his care. And it is his office to
keep us safe both in body and soul; yet Peter mentions only souls,
because this celestial Shepherd keeps us under his own spiritual
protection unto eternal life.

id="iv.iii.i-p26.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.i-p27"></span> Our version here seems to convey the
most suitable meaning, by taking <span
id="iv.iii.i-p27.1"></span>λογικὸν for <span
id="iv.iii.i-p27.2"></span>τοῦ λόγου; see similar instances in <span
id="iv.iii.i-p27.3"></span>[1Pe
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013.md)<span id="iv.iii.i-p27.3"></span>
and <span id="iv.iii.i-p27.4"></span>[1Pe
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.iii.i-p27.4"></span>.
It is the wordy milk, or milk made up of the word; the word is the milk.
Then <span id="iv.iii.i-p27.5"></span>ἄδολον is to be taken in its
secondary meaning: when applied to persons, it means undeceitful, or
guileless; but when to things, genuine, pure, unadulterated, unmixed
with anything deleterious. We may, therefore, render the words, “Desire
the pure milk of the word.” It is a milk not adulterated by water or by
anything poisonous. There is no contrast here between milk and strong
food; but it includes all that is necessary as an aliment for the soul,
when renewed. The Word had before been represented as the instrument of
the new birth; it is now spoken of as the food and aliment of the
new-born. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_19"></span>[20](cc45006.htm#fr_19.md) <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p11"></span> Several copies have <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p11.1"></span>ἡ γραφὴ instead of <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p11.2"></span>ἐν τὣ γραφὴ; and this reading *Calvin* has
followed. But the verb <span id="iv.iii.ii-p11.3"></span>περιέχω is used
by *Josephus* and others in a passive sense. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_20"></span>[21](cc45006.htm#fr_20.md) <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p11.5"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p12"></span> The quotation is not exactly either
from the Hebrew or from the *Sept.* The Apostle seems to have taken what
was suitable to his purpose. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_21"></span>[22](cc45006.htm#fr_21.md) <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p25.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p26"></span> As to this verb he has, but in the
previous parts he comes nearer to the Hebrew than to the *Sept.* Paul
quotes this sentence twice, <span id="iv.iii.ii-p26.1"></span>[Rom.
9:33](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#033.md), [Rom.
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p26.1"></span>, and follows the *Sept.* as Peter does.
Indeed, the difference between <span id="iv.iii.ii-p26.2"></span>יחיש he
shall make haste, and <span id="iv.iii.ii-p26.3"></span>יבש, he shall be
ashamed, is very small; and further, the former verb admits of a similar
meaning with the latter. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_22"></span>[23](cc45006.htm#fr_22.md) <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p35"></span> There are in this verse two quotations,
one from <span id="iv.iii.ii-p35.1"></span>[Ps
118:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p35.1"></span>, and the other from <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p35.2"></span>[Isa
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p35.2"></span>. That from the Psalms is literally the
*Sept.,* and is the same as quoted in <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p35.3"></span>[Mt
21:42](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#042.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p35.3"></span>; <span id="iv.iii.ii-p35.4"></span>[Mr
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#010.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p35.4"></span>; and <span id="iv.iii.ii-p35.5"></span>[Lu
20:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#017.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p35.5"></span>. In all these instances it is <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p35.6"></span>λίθον, and not <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p35.7"></span>λίθος according to the Hebrew. It is
therefore necessary to consider <span id="iv.iii.ii-p35.8"></span>κατὰ
*as to,* or, *with respect to,* as understood, a thing not uncommon in
Greek. With regard to <span id="iv.iii.ii-p35.9"></span>ἡ τιμὴ, a noun
for an adjective, it refers to the stone, or to *him,* in the preceding
verse; but as the metaphor of stone is still continued in this verse, it
is better to retain it here, “it is precious,” that is, the stone; and
especially as Christ is represented before, in <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p35.10"></span>[1Pe
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p35.10"></span>, a stone “precious” in the sight of God. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_23"></span>[24](cc45006.htm#fr_23.md) <span
id="iv.iii.ii-p39.2"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p40"></span> The most obvious meaning is, to
consider the phrase, “who stumble at the word,” as the antecedent to
<span id="iv.iii.ii-p40.1"></span>εἰς ὃ “to which:” they being
disobedient or unbelieving were destined to stumble at the word, and
thereby to fall and to be broken. (<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p40.2"></span>[Isa.
8:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#015.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ii-p40.2"></span>.) To the believing it was precious, but to
the unbelieving it became the stone of stumbling; and this stumbling is
a judgment to which all the unpersuaded (literally) or the unbelieving,
are destined. I would render the two verses thus, —

<span id="iv.iii.ii-p41"></span>“To you then who believe it is precious;
but to the unbelieving (*with regard to* the stone which the builders
have rejected, the same *which* has become the head of the corner) even
a stone of stumbling and rock of offense; that is, *to those* who
stumble at the word, being unbelieving; to which also they have been
appointed:” that is, according to the testimony of Scripture. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_24"></span>[25](cc45006.htm#fr_24.md) <span
id="iv.iii.iii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iii-p23"></span> This verse is a quotation from <span
id="iv.iii.iii-p23.1"></span>[Ho
2:23](../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p23.1"></span>, only the two clauses are inverted. The
same is quoted by Paul in <span id="iv.iii.iii-p23.2"></span>[Ro
9:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#025.md)<span
id="iv.iii.iii-p23.2"></span>, in the same inverted form, and with this
difference, that Peter follows the Hebrew, and Paul the Septuagint. The
Hebrew is, “I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy;” but
according to the Septuagint, “I will love her that had not been loved.”
The meaning is the same, though the words are different. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_25"></span>[26](cc45006.htm#fr_25.md) <span
id="iv.iii.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.iv-p14"></span> Neither “conversation” nor “honest” are
suitable words. It is difficult to find a proper word in English for
<span id="iv.iii.iv-p14.1"></span>ἀναστροπὴ which means deportment,
behavior, carriage, conduct, manner of live: perhaps life would be the
best word, “Having your life good among the Gentiles;” that is, morally
good (<span id="iv.iii.iv-p14.2"></span>καλὴν) right, or upright. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_26"></span>[27](cc45006.htm#fr_26.md) <span
id="iv.iii.v-p13.3"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.v-p14"></span> The words literally are, “Submit ye to
every human creation:” but, as Calvin says, the Greek verb means
sometimes to form, to construct; and so does <span
id="iv.iii.v-p14.1"></span>ברא to create, in Hebrew. The noun may hence
be rendered “institution,” what is formed. As in the second verse, so
here, the Apostle, in a way almost peculiar to himself, and the reverse
of what is commonly done in Scripture, uses an adjective for a noun,
“human” for “of man;” and he does the same in <span
id="iv.iii.v-p14.2"></span>[1Pe
3:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#007.md)<span id="iv.iii.v-p14.2"></span>,
“the womanish weaker vessel,” instead of “the woman (or wife) the weaker
vessel.” We may then render the words, “Submit ye to every institution
of man.” The reference is clearly to government. The ostensible agent in
the formation of all governments is man; but God is the overruler of all
things. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_27"></span>[28](cc45006.htm#fr_27.md) <span
id="iv.iii.v-p24.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.v-p25"></span> The word properly means to muzzle; “that
ye, by doing good, should muzzle the ignorance of foolish men;”
according to what is done to savage animals, in order to prevent them to
do harm. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_28"></span>[29](cc45006.htm#fr_28.md) <span
id="iv.iii.vi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vi-p7"></span> It is better to take it in this wide
sense, than to limit it, as some have done, to rulers or magistrates,
because honor to magistrates is included in the last clause, “Honour the
king.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_29"></span>[30](cc45006.htm#fr_29.md) <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p11"></span> The word for “servants,” <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p11.1"></span>οἰκέται properly means “domestics,” or
household servants. They are mentioned as they came more in contact with
their masters, and were more liable to be ill-treated. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_30"></span>[31](cc45006.htm#fr_30.md) <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p14"></span>”Good,” <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p14.1"></span>ἀγαθοῖς, the kind, benevolent; “gentle,”
<span id="iv.iii.vii-p14.2"></span>ἐπιεικέσιν, the yielding, mild,
patient; “froward,” <span id="iv.iii.vii-p14.3"></span>σκολιο̑ις the
crooked, perverse, untoward, those of a cross disposition, self-willed,
and hence cruel, being neither kind nor meek. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_31"></span>[32](cc45006.htm#fr_31.md) <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.vii-p18"></span> Literally, “this is favor,” that is,
with God, as at the end of the next verse. To “find favor with God” is a
similar phrase, <span id="iv.iii.vii-p18.1"></span>[Lu
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#030.md)<span
id="iv.iii.vii-p18.1"></span>, which means to find acceptance with him.
We may render the words, “This is acceptable:” with whom acceptable, is
afterwards explained. So the word <span id="iv.iii.vii-p18.2"></span>חז
in Hebrew means a favorable acceptance, or approbation. See <span
id="iv.iii.vii-p18.3"></span>[Gen.
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#008.md), [Gen.
32:5](../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#005.md)<span
id="iv.iii.vii-p18.3"></span> — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_32"></span>[33](cc45006.htm#fr_32.md) <span
id="iv.iii.viii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.viii-p12"></span> Calvin has “you” instead of “us,” and
has also “you” after “suffered.” The authority as to *MSS.* is nearly
equal; but the verse reads better with having “you” in both instances,
as the verb “follow” is in the second person plural, “that *ye* may
follow in his footsteps.” The word for “example” is <span
id="iv.iii.viii-p12.1"></span>ὑπογραμμὸν, a copy set before scholars to
be imitated, and may be rendered “a pattern.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_33"></span>[34](cc45006.htm#fr_33.md) <span
id="iv.iii.ix-p12.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p13"></span> Or, “Being freed from sins:” <span
id="iv.iii.ix-p13.1"></span>ἀπογενόμενοι, being away from, having
departed from, or, being removed from. *Beza* renders it “being
separated from.” Freedom from the power or dominion of sin seems more
expressly to be intended, as the end of this freedom is, that we may
live to righteousness; the end of forgiveness on the other hand is, that
we may have peace with God. *Beza, Estius, Grotis,* and *Scott,* take
this view of the sentence. The subject in hand is not the removal of
guilt, but holiness of life, and Christ in his sufferings is set forth
as the pattern to us. Then in what follows, our diseased state and our
wandering from the right way, are the things referred to. Christ’s death
was intended to answer two great ends, — to remove guilt and to remove
or to destroy sin in us. The latter is the subject of this passage. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_34"></span>[35](cc45006.htm#fr_34.md) <span
id="iv.iii.ix-p18.1"></span>

<span id="iv.iii.ix-p19"></span> I would render the clause thus, “But
you have been now restored,” that is, from your wandering, “to the
shepherd and the bishop (or, overseer) of your souls.” *Macknight*
thinks, that our Lord took the title of shepherd in order to shew that
he is the person foretold in <span id="iv.iii.ix-p19.1"></span>[Eze
34:23](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#023.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ix-p19.1"></span>, and that Peter alludes, in calling him
bishop or overseer, to <span id="iv.iii.ix-p19.2"></span>[Eze
34:11](../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#011.md)<span
id="iv.iii.ix-p19.2"></span> of that chapter, the latter clause of
which, according to the *Sept.* is, “I will oversee them,” (<span
id="iv.iii.ix-p19.3"></span>ἐπισκέψομαι.) — *Ed.*
