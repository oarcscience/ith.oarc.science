<p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii.i-p7"></A><a name="viii.ii.i-p7.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.i-p8"></A><b>1</b>  <i>Jude the servant of Jesus Christ</i>. He calls himself the servant of Christ, not as the name applies to all the godly, but with respect to his apostleship; for they were deemed peculiarly the servants of Christ, who had some public office committed to them. And we know why the 				apostles were wont to give themselves this honorable name. Whosoever is not called, arrogates to himself presumptuously the right and authority of teaching. Then their calling was an evidence to the apostles, that they did not thrust themselves into their office through their own will. It was not, however, of itself sufficient to be appointed to their office, except they faithfully discharged it. And, no doubt, he who declares himself to be the servant of God, includes both these things, that 				is, that God is the bestower of the office which he exercises, and that he faithfully performs what has been committed to him. Many act falsely, and falsely boast to be what they are very far from being: we ought always to examine whether the reality corresponds with the profession.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.i-p9"></A><i>And brother of James</i>. He mentions a name more celebrated than his own, and more known to the churches. For though faithfulness of doctrine and authority do not depend on the names of mortal men, yet it is a confirmation to the faith, when the integrity of the man who undertakes the office of a teacher is made certain to us. Besides, the authority of 				James is not here brought forward as that of a private individual, but because he was counted by all the Church as one of the chief apostles of Christ. He was the son of Alpheus, as I have said elsewhere. Nay, this very passage is a sufficient proof to me against Eusebius and others, who say, that he was a disciple, named Oblias, [James,] mentioned by Luke, in <a name="viii.ii.i-p9.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013">Ac 15:13</a><a name="viii.ii.i-p9.1"></A>; 				<a name="viii.ii.i-p9.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018">Ac 21:18</a><a name="viii.ii.i-p9.2"></A>, who was more eminent than the apostles in the Church.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">187</FONT></A>
 				 But there is no doubt but that Jude mentions here his own brother, because he was eminent among the apostles. It is, then, probable, that he was the person to whom the chief honor was conceded by the rest, according to what Luke relates.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.i-p11"></A><i>To them that are sanctified by God the Father</i>, or, <i>to the called who are sanctified, etc.</i>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">188</FONT></A>
 				 By this expression, &#8220;the called,&#8221; he denotes all the faithful, because the Lord has separated them for himself. But as calling is nothing else but the effect of eternal election, it is sometimes taken for it. In this place it makes but little difference in which way you take it; for he, no doubt, commends the grace of God, by which he has been pleased to choose them as his peculiar treasure. And he intimates that men do not anticipate God, and that they never come 				to him until he draws them.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.i-p13"></A>Of the same he says that they were <i>sanctified in God the Father</i>, which may be rendered, &#8220;by God the Father.&#8221; I have, however, retained the very form of the expression, that readers may exercise their own judgment. For it may be, that this is the sense, &#8212; that being profane in themselves, they had their holiness in God. But the 				way in which God sanctifies is, by regenerating us by his Spirit.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.i-p14"></A>Another reading, which the Vulgate has followed, is somewhat harsh, &#8220;To the beloved (<a name="viii.ii.i-p14.1"></A>&#7968;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#951;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962;) in God the Father.&#8221; I therefore regard it as corrupt; and it is, indeed, found but in a few copies.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.i-p15"></A>He further adds, that they were <i>preserved in Jesus Christ</i>. For we should be always in danger of death through Satan, and he might take us at any moment as an easy prey, were we not safe under the protection of Christ, whom the Father has given to be our guardian, so that none of those whom he has received under his care and 				shelter should perish.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.i-p16"></A>Jude then mentions here a threefold blessing, or favor of God, with regard to all the godly, &#8212; that he has made them by his calling partakers of the gospel; that he has regenerated them, by his Spirit, unto newness of life; and that he has preserved them by the hand of Christ, so that they might not fall away from salvation.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii.i-p17"></A><a name="viii.ii.i-p17.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.i-p18"></A><b>2.</b> <i>Mercy to you.</i> Mercy means nearly the same as grace in the salutations of Paul. Were any one to wish for a refined distinction, it may be said that grace is properly the effect of mercy; for there is no other reason why God has embraced us in love, but that he pitied our miseries. <i>Love </i>may be understood as that of God towards men, as well as that of men towards one another.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">189</FONT></A>
 				 If it be referred to God, the meaning is, that it might increase towards them, and that the assurance of divine love might be daily more confirmed in their hearts. The other meaning is, however, not unsuitable, that God would kindle and confirm in them mutual love.</p>  <a name="viii.ii.ii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption16"><a name="viii.ii.ii-p1"></A><a name="viii.ii.ii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#003">Jude 3-4</a><a name="viii.ii.ii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p2"></A><b>3.</b> Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort <i>you</i>, that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p3"></A><b>3.</b> Dilecti, quum omne studium adhiberem ad scribendum vobis de communi salute, necesse habui scribere vobis ad vos hortandos ut certando adjuvetis eam, quae semel tradita est sanctis, fidem.</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p4"></A><b>4.</b> For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p5"></A><b>4.</b> Subingressi enim sunt quidam homines, olim praescripti judicium, impii, Dei nostri gratiam transferentes in lasciviam, et Deum, qui solus est Herus, et Dominum Jesum Christum negantes.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p6"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii.ii-p7"></A><a name="viii.ii.ii-p7.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p8"></A><b>3.</b> <i>When I gave diligence</i>. I have rendered the words <a name="viii.ii.ii-p8.1"></A>&#963;&#960;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#8052;&#957; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#8059;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;, &#8220;Applying care:&#8221; literally they are, &#8220;Making diligence.&#8221; But many interpreters explain the sentence in this sense, that a strong 				desire constrained Jude to write, as we usually say of those under the influence of some strong feeling, that they cannot govern or restrain themselves. Then, according to these expounders, Jude was under a sort of necessity, because a desire to write suffered him not to rest. But I rather think that the two clauses are separate, that though he was inclined and solicitous to write, yet a necessity compelled him. He then intimates, that he was indeed glad and anxious to write to them, but yet 				necessity urged him to do so, even because they were assailed (according to what follows) by the ungodly, and stood in need of being prepared to fight with them.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">190</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p10"></A>Then, in the first place, Jude testifies that he felt so much concern for their salvation, that he wished himself, and was indeed anxious to write to them; and, secondly, in order to rouse their attention, he says that the state of things required him to do so. For necessity adds strong stimulants. Had they not been forewarned how necessary his exhortation was, they might have been slothful and negligent; but when he makes this preface, 				that he wrote on account of the necessity of their case, it was the same as though he had blown a trumpet to awake them from their torpor.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p11"></A><i>Of the common salvation</i>. Some copies add &#8220;your,&#8221; but without reason, as I think; for he makes salvation common to them and to himself. And it adds not a little weight to the doctrine that is announced, when any one speaks according to his own feelings and experience; for vain is what we say, if we speak of salvation to others, when we ourselves have 				no real knowledge of it. Then, Jude professed himself to be (so to speak) an experimental teacher, when he associated himself with the godly in the participation of the same salvation.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p12"></A><i>And exhort you</i>. Literally, &#8220;exhorting you;&#8221; but as he points out the end of his counsel, the sentence ought to be thus expressed. What I have rendered, &#8220;to help the faith by contending,&#8221; means the same as to strive in retaining the faith, and courageously to sustain the contrary assaults of Satan.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">191</FONT></A>
 				 For he reminds them that in order to persevere in the faith, various contests must be encountered and continual warfare maintained. He says that faith had been <i>once delivered</i>, that they might know that they had obtained it for this end, that they might never fail or fall away.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii.ii-p14"></A><a name="viii.ii.ii-p14.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p15"></A><b>4.</b> <i>For there are certain men crept in unawares</i>. Though Satan is ever an enemy to the godly, and never ceases to harass them, yet Jude reminds those to whom he was writing of the state of things at that time. Satan now, he says, attacks and harasses you in a peculiar manner; it is therefore necessary 				to take up arms to resist him. We hence learn that a good and faithful pastor ought wisely to consider what the present state of the Church requires, so as to accommodate his doctrine to its wants.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p16"></A>The word <a name="viii.ii.ii-p16.1"></A>&#960;&#945;&#961;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#8051;&#948;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#957;, which he uses, denotes an indirect and stealthy insinuation, by which the ministers of Satan deceive the unwary; for Satan sows his tares in the night, and while husbandmen are asleep, in order that he may corrupt the seed of God. And at the same time he teaches us that it is an intestine evil; 				for Satan in this respect also is crafty, as he raises up those who are of the flock to do mischief, in order that they may more easily creep in.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p17"></A><i>Before of old ordained</i>. He calls that judgment, or condemnation, or a reprobate mind, by which they were led astray to pervert the doctrine of godliness; for no one can do such a thing except to his own ruin. But the metaphor is taken from this circumstance, because the eternal counsel of God, by which the faithful are ordained unto salvation, is 				called a book: and when the faithful heard that these were given up to eternal death, it behooved them to take heed lest they should involve themselves in the same destruction. It was at the same time the object of Jude to obviate danger, lest the novelty of the thing should disturb and distress any of them; for if these were already long ago ordained, it follows that the Church is not tried or exercised but according to the infallible counsel of God. 				  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">192</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p19"></A><i>The grace of our God</i>. He now expresses more clearly what the evil was; for he says that they abused the grace of God, so as to lead themselves and others to take an impure and profane liberty in sinning. But the grace of God has appeared for a far different purpose, even that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we may live soberly, righteously, 				and godly in this world. Let us, then, know that nothing is more pestilential than men of this kind, who from the grace of Christ take a cloak to indulge in lasciviousness.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">193</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p21"></A>Because we teach that salvation is obtained through God&#8217;s mercy alone, the Papists accuse us of this crime. But why should we use words to refute their effrontery, since we everywhere urge repentance, the fear of God, and newness of life, and since they themselves not only corrupt the whole world with the worst examples, but also by their ungodly teaching take away from the world true holiness and the pure worship of God? Though I 				rather think, that those of whom Jude speaks, were like the libertines of our time, as it will be more evident from what follows.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.ii-p22"></A><i>The only Lord God</i>, or, <i>God who alone is Lord</i>. Some old copies have, &#8220;Christ, who alone is God and Lord.&#8221; And, indeed, in the Second Epistle of Peter, Christ alone is mentioned, and there he is called Lord.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">194</FONT></A>
 				 But He means that <i>Christ</i> is <i>denied</i>, when they who had been redeemed by his blood, become again the vassals of the Devil, and thus render void as far as they can that incomparable price. That Christ, then, may retain us as his peculiar treasure, we must remember that he died and rose again for us, that he might have dominion over our life and death.</p>  <a name="viii.ii.iii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption16"><a name="viii.ii.iii-p1"></A><a name="viii.ii.iii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#005">Jude 5-7</a><a name="viii.ii.iii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p2"></A><b>5. </b>I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p3"></A><b>5. </b>Commonefacere autem vos volo, quum istud semel noveritis, quod Dominus postquam ex terra Egypti populum servaverat, postea non credentes perdidit.</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p4"></A><b>6. </b>And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p5"></A><b>6. </b>Angelos vero qui principatum (<i>vel, initium</i>) suum non servaverant, sed reliquerant suum domicilium, judicium magnae diei vinculis aeternis sub caligine servavit.</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p6"></A><b>7. </b>Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p7"></A><b>7. </b>Quemadmodum Sodoma et Gomorrha, et qae circum erant urbes, quum simili modo scortatae essent, et abiissent post carnem alienam, propositae sunt ignis aeterni judicium sustinentes.</p> 				    				  			   			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p8"></A>&nbsp;</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii.iii-p9"></A><a name="viii.ii.iii-p9.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p10"></A><b>5. </b><i>I will therefore put you in remembrance</i>, or, <i>remind you</i>. He either modestly excuses himself, lest he should seem to teach as it were the ignorant things unknown to them; or, indeed, he openly declares in an emphatical manner, (which I approve more of,) that he adduced 				nothing new or unheard of before, in order that what he was going to say might gain more credit and authority. I only recall, he says, to your mind what you have already learnt. As he ascribes knowledge to them, so he says that they stood in need of warnings, lest they should think that the labor he undertook towards them was superfluous; for the use of God&#8217;s word is not only to teach what we could not have otherwise known, but also to rouse us to a serious meditation of those things which we 				already understand, and not to suffer us to grow torpid in a cold knowledge.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p11"></A>Now, the meaning is, that after having been called by God, we ought not to glory carelessly in his grace, but on the contrary, to walk watchfully in his fear; for if any trifles thus with God, the contempt of his grace will not be unpunished. And this he proves by three examples. He first refers to the vengeance which God executed on those unbelievers, whom he had chosen as his people, and delivered by his power. Nearly the same 				reference is made by Paul in <a name="viii.ii.iii-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#001">1Co 10:1-13</a><a name="viii.ii.iii-p11.1"></A>. The import of what he says is, that those whom God had honored with the greatest blessings, whom he had extolled to the same degree of honor as we enjoy at this day, he afterwards severely punished. Then in vain were all they proud of God&#8217;s grace, who did not live in a manner suitable to their calling.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p12"></A>The word <i>people</i> is by way of honor taken for the holy and chosen nation, as though he had said that it availed them nothing, that they by a singular favor had been taken into covenant. By calling them <i>unbelieving</i>, he denotes the 				fountain of all evils; for all their sins, mentioned by Moses, were owing to this, because they refused to be ruled by God&#8217;s word. For where there is the subjection of faith, there obedience towards God necessarily appears in all the duties of life.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii.iii-p13"></A><a name="viii.ii.iii-p13.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p14"></A><b>6.</b> <i>And the angels</i>. This is an argument from the greater to the less; for the state of angels is higher than ours; and yet God punished their defection in a dreadful manner. He will not then forgive our perfidy, if we depart from the grace unto which he has called us. This punishment, inflicted on 				the inhabitants of heaven, and on such superior ministers of God, ought surely to be constantly before our eyes, so that we may at no time be led to despise God&#8217;s grace, and thus rush headlong into destruction.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p15"></A>The word <a name="viii.ii.iii-p15.1"></A>&#7936;&#961;&#967;&#8052; in this place, may be aptly taken for <i>beginning</i> as well as for <i>principality</i> or <i>dominion</i>. For Jude intimates that they suffered punishment, because they had 				despised the goodness of God and deserted their first vocation. And there follows immediately an explanation, for he says that they had <i>left their own habitation</i>; for, like military deserters, they left the station in which they had been placed.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p16"></A>We must also notice the atrocity of the punishment which the Apostle mentions. They are not only free spirits but celestial powers; they are now held bound by perpetual chains. They not only enjoyed the glorious light of God, but his brightness shone forth in them, so that from them, as by rays, it spread over all parts of the universe; now they are sunk in darkness. But we are not to imagine a certain place in which the devils are 				shut up, for the Apostle simply intended to teach us how miserable their condition is, since the time they apostatized and lost their dignity. For wherever they go, they drag with them their own chains, and remain involved in darkness. Their extreme punishment is in the meantime, deferred until the great day comes.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii.iii-p17"></A><a name="viii.ii.iii-p17.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p18"></A><b>7.</b> <i>Even as Sodom and Gomorrha</i>. This example is more general, for he testifies that God, excepting none of mankind, punishes without any difference all the ungodly. And Jude also mentions in what follows, that the fire through which the five cities perished was a type of the eternal fire. Then God at 				that time exhibited a remarkable example, in order to keep men in fear till the end of the world. Hence it is that it is so often mentioned in Scripture; nay, whenever the prophets wished to designate some memorable and dreadful judgment of God, they painted it under the figure of sulfurous fire, and alluded to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha. It is not, therefore, without reason that Jude strikes all ages with terror, by exhibiting the same view.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.iii-p19"></A>When he says, <i>the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication</i>, I do not apply these words to the Israelites and the angels, but to Sodom and Gomorrha. It is no objection that the pronoun <a name="viii.ii.iii-p19.1"></A>&#964;&#959;&#8059;&#964;&#959;&#953;&#962; is masculine, for Jude refers to the inhabitants and not to the places. To <i>go after strange flesh</i>, is the same as to be given up to monstrous lusts; for we know that the Sodomites, not content with the common manner of committing fornication, polluted themselves in a 				way the most filthy and detestable. We ought to observe, that he devotes them to eternal fire; for we hence learn, that the dreadful spectacle which Moses describes, was only an image of a much heavier punishment.</p>  <a name="viii.ii.iv"></A>

<p><a name="viii.ii.iv-p19"></A>But as this history is thought to have been taken from an apocryphal book, it has hence happened that less weight has been attached to this Epistle.

I know indeed that many puerilities had obtained the name of tradition, as at this day the Papists 				relate as traditions many of the silly dotages of the monks; but this is no reason why they should not have had <i>some</i> historical facts not committed to writing.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.iv-p20"></A>It is beyond controversy that Moses was buried by the Lord, that is, that his grave was concealed according to the known purpose of God. And the reason for concealing his grave is evident to all, that is, that the Jews might not bring forth his body to promote superstition. What wonder then is it, when the body of the prophet was hidden by God, Satan should attempt to make it known; and that angels, who are ever ready to serve God, 				should on the other hand resist him? And doubtless we see that Satan almost in all ages has been endeavoring to make the bodies of God&#8217;s saints idols to foolish men. Therefore this Epistle ought not to be suspected on account of this testimony, though it is not found in Scripture.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.iv-p21"></A>That Michael is introduced alone as disputing against Satan is not new.

<p><a name="viii.ii.v-p14"></A>Some copies have, &#8220;Feasting with you,&#8221; which reading, if approved, has this meaning, that they were not only a disgrace, but that they were also troublesome and expensive, as they crammed themselves without fear, at the public expense of the church.

At the same time they brought forth nothing spiritual, their object being on the contrary to make men as stupid as brute animals. Such, as it has been before stated, are the fanatics of our day, who call themselves Libertines. You may justly say that they make only rumbling sounds; for, despising common language, they form for themselves an exotic idiom, I know not what. They seem at one time to carry 				their disciples above heaven, then they suddenly fall down to beastly errors, for they imagine a state of innocency in which there is no difference between baseness and honesty; they imagine a spiritual life, when fear is extinguished, and when every one heedlessly indulges himself; they imagine that we become gods, because God absorbs the spirits when they quit their bodies. With the more care and reverence ought the simplicity of Scripture to be studied, lest, by reasoning more refinedly than 				is right, we should not draw men to heaven, but on the contrary be involved in manifold labyrinths.

 				 Were any one to ask, that since similar sentences occur in many parts of Scripture, why did he not quote a testimony written by one of the prophets? the answer is obvious, that he wished to repeat from the oldest antiquity what the Spirit had pronounced respecting them: and this is what the words intimate; for he says expressly that he was <i>the seventh from Adam</i>, in order 				to commend the antiquity of the prophecy, because it existed in the world before the flood.</p>

<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p16"></A><b>20.</b> <i>But ye, beloved</i>. He shews the manner in which they could overcome all the devices of Satan, that is, by having love connected with faith, and by standing on their guard as it were in their watch-tower, until the coming of Christ. But as he uses often and thickly his metaphors, so he has here a 				way of speaking peculiar to himself, which must be briefly noticed.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p17"></A>He bids them first to <i>build themselves on faith</i>; by which he means, that the foundation of faith ought to be retained, but that the first instruction is not sufficient, except they who have been already grounded on true faith, went on continually towards perfection. He calls their faith <i>most 				holy,</i> in order that they might wholly rely on it, and that, leaning on its firmness, they might never vacillate.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p18"></A>But since the whole perfection of man consists in faith, it may seem strange that he bids them to build upon it another building, as though faith were only a commencement to man. This difficulty is removed by the Apostle in the words which follow, when he adds, that men build on faith when love is added; except, perhaps, some one may prefer to take this meaning, that men build on faith, as far as they make proficiency in it, and 				doubtless the daily progress of faith is such, that itself rises up as a building.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">202</FONT></A>
 				Thus the Apostle teaches us, that in order to increase in faith, we must be instant in prayer and maintain our calling by love.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p22"></A><i>Praying in the Holy Ghost</i>. The way of persevering is, when we are endued with the power of God. Hence whenever the question is respecting the constancy of faith, we must flee to prayer. And as we commonly pray in a formal manner, he adds, <i>In the Spirit</i>; as though he had said, that such is our 				sloth, and that such is the coldness of our flesh, that no one can pray aright except he be roused by the Spirit of God; and that we are also so inclined to diffidence and trembling, that no one dares to call God his Father, except through the teaching of the same Spirit; for from him is solicitude, from him is ardor and vehemence, from him is alacrity, from him is confidence in obtaining what we ask; in short, from him are those unutterable groanings mentioned by Paul (<a name="viii.ii.viii-p22.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#026">Ro 8:26</a><a name="viii.ii.viii-p22.1"></A>.) It is not, then, without reason that Jude teaches us, that no one can pray as he ought without having the Spirit as his guide.</p>

<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p24"></A><b>21.</b> <i>Keep yourselves in the love of God.</i> He has made love as it were the guardian and the ruler of our life; not that he might set it in opposition to the grace of God, but that it is the right course of our calling, when we make progress in love. But as many things entice us to apostasy, so that 				it is difficult to keep us faithful to God to the end, he calls the attention of the faithful to the last day. For the hope of that alone ought to sustain us, so that we may at no time despond; otherwise we must necessarily fail every moment.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p25"></A>But it ought to be noticed that he would not have us to hope for eternal life, except through the mercy of Christ: for he will in such a manner be our judge, as to have no other rule in judging us than that gratuitous benefit of redemption obtained by himself.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii.viii-p26"></A><a name="viii.ii.viii-p26.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p27"></A><b>22.</b> <i>And of some have compassion</i>. He adds another exhortation, shewing how the faithful ought to act in reproving their brethren, in order to restore them to the Lord. He reminds them that such ought to be treated in different ways, every one according to his disposition: for to the meek and 				teachable we ought to use kindness; but others, who are hard and perverse, must be subdued by terror.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">203</FONT></A>
 				 This is the <i>difference </i>which he mentions.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p29"></A>The participle <a name="viii.ii.viii-p29.1"></A>&#948;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#957;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;, I know not why this is rendered in a passive sense by Erasmus. It may, indeed, be rendered in either way, but its active meaning is more suitable to the context. The meaning then is, that if we wish to consult the well-being of such as go astray, we must consider the character and 				disposition of every one; so that they who are meek and tractable may in a kind manner be restored to the right way, as being objects of pity; but if any be perverse, he is to be corrected with more severity. And as asperity is almost hateful, he excuses it on the ground of necessity; for otherwise, they who do not willingly follow good counsels, cannot he saved.</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p30"></A>Moreover, he employs a striking metaphor. When there is a danger of fire, we hesitate not to snatch away violently whom we desire to save; for it would not be enough to beckon with the finger, or kindly to stretch forth the hand. So also the salvation of some ought to be cared for, because they will not come to God, except when rudely drawn. Very different is the old translation, which reading is however found in many of the Greek 				copies; the Vulgate is, &#8220;Rebuke the judged,&#8221; (<a name="viii.ii.viii-p30.1"></A><i>Arguite dijudicatos</i>.) But the first meaning is more suitable, and is, I think, according to the old and genuine reading. The word <i>to save</i>, is transferred to men, not that they are the authors, but the ministers of salvation.</p>

<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p32"></A><b>23.</b> <i>Hating even the garment</i>. This passage, which otherwise would appear obscure, will have no difficulty in it, when the metaphor is rightly explained. He would have the faithful not only to beware of contact with vices, but that no contagion might reach them, he reminds them that everything that 				borders on vices and is near to them ought to be avoided: as, when we speak of lasciviousness, we say that all excitements to lusts ought to be removed. The passage will also become clearer, when the whole sentence is filled up, that is, that we should hate not only the flesh, but also the garment, which, by a contact with it, is infected. The particle <a name="viii.ii.viii-p32.1"></A>&#954;&#945;&#8054; even serves 				to give greater emphasis. He, then, does not allow evil be cherished by indulgence, so that he bids all preparations and all accessories, as they say, to be cut off.</p>

<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p34"></A><b>24</b>  <i>Now unto him that is able to keep you</i>. He closes the Epistle with praise to God; by which he shews that our exhortations and labors can do nothing except through the power of God accompanying them.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">204</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p39"></A>Some copies have &#8220;them&#8221; instead of &#8220;you.&#8221; If we receive this reading, the sense will be, &#8220;It is, indeed, your duty to endeavor to save them; but it is God alone who can do this&#8221; However, the other reading is what I prefer; in which there is an allusion to the preceding verse; for after having exhorted the faithful to save what was perishing, that they might understand that all their efforts would be vain except God 				worked with them, he testifies that they could not be otherwise saved than through the power of God. In the latter clause there is indeed a different verb, <a name="viii.ii.viii-p39.1"></A>&#966;&#965;&#955;&#8049;&#958;&#945;&#953;, which means <i>to guard</i>; so the allusion is to a remoter clause, when he said, <i>Keep yourselves</i></p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="viii.ii.viii-p28"></A> Though most agree that by &#8220;fear&#8221; here is meant terror, that is, that the persons referred to are to be terrified by the judgment which awaited them; yet what follows seems favorable to another view, that fear means the care and caution with which they were to be treated; for the act of saving them is compared to that of a man snatching anything from the fire, in doing which he must be careful lest he himself should be burnt; and then the 					 other comparison, that of a man shunning an infected garment lest he should catch the contagion, favors the same view. Hence our version seems right &#8212; &#8220;<i>with</i> fear.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Ed</i>.</p> 				</P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="viii.ii.viii-p35"></A> The doxology is as follows, &#8212;</p>  				  
<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p36"></A>&#8220;To the only wise God (or, to the wise God alone) our Savior, be glory and greatness, might and dominion, both now and through all ages.&#8221;</p>  				  
<p><a name="viii.ii.viii-p37"></A>&#8220;Dominion&#8221; (<a name="viii.ii.viii-p37.1"></A>&#7952;&#958;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#8055;&#945;) is the right to govern, imperial authority or power; &#8220;might&#8221; (<a name="viii.ii.viii-p37.2"></A>&#954;&#961;&#8049;&#964;&#959;&#962;) is strength to effect his purpose, omnipotence; &#8220;greatness&#8221; (<a name="viii.ii.viii-p37.3"></A>&#956;&#949;&#947;&#945;&#955;&#969;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;) comprises knowledge, wisdom, holiness, and everything that constitutes what is really great and magnificent; and (<a name="viii.ii.viii-p37.4"></A>&#948;&#8057;&#958;&#945;) is the result of all these things which belong to God; all terminate in his glory. The ultimate issue is first mentioned, then the things which lead to it. It is by acknowledging his sovereign power, his capacity to 					 exercise that power &#8212; his omnipotence, and his greatness in everything that constitutes greatness, that we give him the glory, the honor, and the praise due to his name. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p>
