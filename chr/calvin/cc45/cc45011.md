<span id="v.i-p1"></span>THE ARGUMENT

<span id="v.i-p2"></span>This Epistle is altogether worthy of the spirit
of that disciple who, above others, was loved by Christ, that he might
exhibit him as a friend to us. But it contains doctrines mixed with
exhortations; for he speaks of the eternal Deity of Christ, and at the
same time of the incomparable grace which he brought with him when he
appeared in the world, and generally of all his blessings; and he
especially commends and extols the inestimable grace of divine adoption.

<span id="v.i-p3"></span>On these truths he grounds his exhortations;
and at one time he admonishes us in general to lead a pious and holy
life, and at another time he expressly enjoins love. But he does none of
these things in a regular order; for he everywhere mixes teaching with
exhortation. But he particularly urges brotherly love: he also briefly
touches on other things, such as to beware of impostors, and similar
things. But each particular shall be noticed in its own place.
