<span id="ix.v"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p1"></span>A translation of

<span id="ix.v-p2"></span>John Calvin’s Version

<span id="ix.v-p3"></span>The Epistle of Jude.

<span id="ix.v.i"></span>

<span id="ix.v.i-p1"></span>

<span id="ix.v.i-p2"></span>**1** Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ, and
the brother of James, to the called, who are sanctified by God the
Father, and preserved by Jesus Christ;

<span id="ix.v.i-p3"></span>**2** Mercy to you and peace and love be
increased.

<span id="ix.v.i-p4"></span>**3** Beloved, when I was applying all care
to write to you of the common salvation, I deemed it necessary to write
to you in order to exhort *you,* that ye should by contending help the
faith once delivered to the saints.

<span id="ix.v.i-p5"></span>**4** For crept in stealthily have certain
men, ordained of old to this judgment, ungodly, turning the grace of our
God into lasciviousness, and denying God, the only sovereign, and our
Lord Jesus Christ.

<span id="ix.v.i-p6"></span>**5** Now I wish to remind you, though ye
once knew this, that the Lord, after having saved the people from the
land of Egypt, afterwards destroyed the unbelieving;

<span id="ix.v.i-p7"></span>**6** And the angels, who had not kept their
own pre-eminence, but left their own abode, he has reserved under
darkness in eternal chains for the judgment of the great day.

<span id="ix.v.i-p8"></span>**7** As Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities
around them, having in like manner committed fornication and gone after
strange flesh, have been set forth for an example, undergoing the
judgment of eternal fire:

<span id="ix.v.i-p9"></span>**8** In like manner also do these, deluded
with dreams, pollute the flesh, reject government, and heap curses on
dignities:

<span id="ix.v.i-p10"></span>**9** Yet Michael the archangel, when,
contending with the devil, he disputed about the body of Moses, dared
not to bring against him a reviling judgment, but said,

<span id="ix.v.i-p11"></span>**10** “The Lord rebuke thee.” But these
revile those things which they know not, but what things they know
naturally, as brute beasts; in these they corrupt themselves.

<span id="ix.v.i-p12"></span>**11** Woe to them! for they have gone in
the way of Cain, and abandoned themselves to the error of Balaam's
reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.

<span id="ix.v.i-p13"></span>**12** These are stains in your brotherly
feasts, feasting with you, heedlessly feeding themselves; clouds without
water, driven about by winds; withering trees of autumn, fruitless,
twice dead, rooted up;

<span id="ix.v.i-p14"></span>**13** Raging waves of the sea, foaming out
their own shame; wandering stars, for whom is reserved the blackness of
darkness for ever:

<span id="ix.v.i-p15"></span>**14** And Enoch also, the seventh from
Adam, formerly prophesied of these, saying, “Behold, the Lord cometh
with thousands of his saints,

<span id="ix.v.i-p16"></span>**15** To execute judgment on all, and to
convict all the ungodly of the ungodly deeds of ungodliness which they
have in an ungodly manner done, and of all the hard things which ungodly
sinners have spoken against God.”

<span id="ix.v.i-p17"></span>**16** These are murmurers, complainers,
walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaks swelling words,
admiring persons for the sake of gain.

<span id="ix.v.i-p18"></span>**17** But ye, beloved, remember the words
which have been spoken before by the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

<span id="ix.v.i-p19"></span>**18** For they have told you, that in the
last time scoffers would come, walking after their own ungodly lusts.

<span id="ix.v.i-p20"></span>**19** These are they who separate
themselves, being sensual, having not the Spirit.

<span id="ix.v.i-p21"></span>**20** But ye, beloved, building up
yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,

<span id="ix.v.i-p22"></span>**21** Keep yourselves in the love of God,
looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

<span id="ix.v.i-p23"></span>**22** And on some have mercy, making a
difference;

<span id="ix.v.i-p24"></span>**23** But others save by fear, snatching
them from the fire, hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

<span id="ix.v.i-p25"></span>**24** Now to him who can keep you free
from sin and set you faultless before the presence of his glory with
exultation

<span id="ix.v.i-p26"></span>**25** To the only wise God our Savior, be
glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and to all ages. Amen.
