<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iii.i-p9"></A><a name="vii.iii.i-p9.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.i-p10"></A><b>1.</b> <i>But there were.</i> As weak consciences are usually very grievously and dangerously shaken, when false teachers arise, who either corrupt or mutilate the doctrine of faith, it was necessary for the Apostle, while seeking to encourage the faithful to persevere, to remove out of the way an offense of this 				kind. He, moreover, comforted those to whom he was writing, and confirmed them by this argument, that God has always tried and proved his Church by such a temptation as this, in order that novelty might not disturb their hearts. &#8220;Not different,&#8221; he says, &#8220;will be the condition of the Church under the gospel, from what it was formerly under the law; false prophets disturbed the ancient Church; the same thing must also be expected by us.&#8221;</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.i-p11"></A>It was necessary expressly to shew this, because many imagined that the Church would enjoy tranquillity under the rein of Christ; for as the prophets had promised that at his coming there would be real peace, the highest degree of heavenly wisdom, and the full restoration of all things, they thought that the Church would be no more exposed to any contests. Let us then remember that the Spirit of God hath once for all declared, that the 				Church shall never be free from this intestine evil; and let this likeness be always borne in mind, that the trial of our faith is to be similar to that of the fathers, and for the same reason &#8212; that in this way it may be made evident, whether we really love God, as we find it written in <a name="vii.iii.i-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#003">De 13:3</a><a name="vii.iii.i-p11.1"></A>.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.i-p12"></A>But it is not necessary here to refer to every example of this kind; it is enough, in short, to know that, like the fathers, we must contend against false doctrines, that our faith ought by no means to be shaken on account of discords and sects, because the truth of God shall remain unshaken notwithstanding the violent agitations by which Satan strives often to upset all things.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.i-p13"></A>Observe also, that no one time in particular is mentioned by Peter, when he says <i>there shall be false teachers</i>, but that all ages are included; for he makes here a comparison between Christians and the ancient people. We ought, then, to apply this truth to our own time, lest, when we see false teachers rising up to oppose the 				truth of God, this trial should break us down. But the Spirit reminds us, in order that we may take the more heed; and to the same purpose is the whole description which follows.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.i-p14"></A>He does not, indeed, paint each sect in its own colors, but particularly refers to profane men who manifested contempt towards God. The advice, indeed, is general, that we ought to beware of false teachers; but, at the same time, he selected one kind of such from whom the greater danger arose. What is said here will hereafter become more evident from the words of Jude, [<a name="vii.iii.i-p14.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#004">Jude 1:4</a><a name="vii.iii.i-p14.1"></A>,] who treats exactly of the same subject.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.i-p15"></A><i>Who privily shall bring in.</i> By these words he points out the craftiness of Satan, and of all the ungodly who militate under his banner, that they would creep in by oblique turnings, as through burrows under ground.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">163</FONT></A>
 				 The more watchful, then, ought the godly to be, so that they may escape their hidden frauds: for however they may insinuate themselves, they cannot circumvent those who are carefully vigilant.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.i-p17"></A>He calls them <i>opinions of perdition,</i> or <i>destructive opinions</i>, that every one, solicitous for his salvation, might dread such opinions as the most noxious pests. As to the word<i> opinions </i>or heresies, it has not, without reason, 				been always deemed infamous and hateful by the children of God; for the bond of holy unity is the simple truth. As soon as we depart from that, nothing remains but dreadful discord.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.i-p18"></A><i>Even denying the Lord that bought them. </i>Though Christ may be denied in various ways, yet Peter, as I think, refers here to what is expressed by Jude, that is, when the grace of God is turned into lasciviousness; for Christ redeemed us, that he might have a people separated from all the pollutions of the world, and devoted to holiness and innocency. 				They, then, who throw off the bridle, and give themselves up to all kinds of licentiousness, are not unjustly said to deny Christ by whom they have been redeemed. Hence, that the doctrine of the gospel may remain whole and complete among us, let this be fixed in our minds, that we have been redeemed by Christ, that he may be the Lord of our life and of our death, and that our main object ought to be, to live to him and to die to him. He then says, that their <i>swift destruction</i> was at hand, lest others should be ensnared by them.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">164</FONT></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iii.i-p20"></A><a name="vii.iii.i-p20.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.i-p21"></A><b>2.</b> <i>And many shall follow</i>. It is, indeed, no slight offense to the weak, when they see that false doctrines are received by the common consent of the world, that a large number of men are led astray, so that few continue in true obedience to Christ. So, at this day, there is nothing that more violently 				disturbs pious minds than such a defection. For hardly one in ten of those who have once made a profession of Christ, retains the purity of faith to the end. Almost all turn aside into corruptions, and being deluded by the teachers of licentiousness, they become profane. Lest this should make our faith to falter, Peter comes to our help, and in due time foretells that this very thing would be, that is, that false teachers would draw many to perdition.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.i-p22"></A>But there is a double reading even in the Greek copies; for some read, &#8220;lasciviousness,&#8221; and others, &#8220;perdition.&#8221; I have, however, followed what has been mostly approved.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">165</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.i-p24"></A><i>By reason of whom the way of truth.</i> This I consider to have been said for this reason, because as religion is adorned when men are taught to fear God, to maintain uprightness of life, a chaste and virtuous conduct, or when at least the mouth of the wicked is closed, that they do not speak evil of the gospel; so when the reins are let loose, and every 				kind of licentiousness is practiced, the name and the doctrine of Christ are exposed to the reproaches of the ungodly. Others give a different explanation &#8212; that these false teachers, like filthy dogs, barked at sound doctrine. But the words of Peter appear to me on the contrary to intimate, that these would give occasion to enemies insolently to assail the truth of God. Though then they would not themselves assail the Christian faith with calumnies, yet they would arm others with the means of 				reproaching it.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iii.i-p25"></A><a name="vii.iii.i-p25.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.i-p26"></A><b>3.</b> <i>With feigned words.</i> Peter endeavors by all means to render the faithful displeased with ungodly teachers, that they might resist them more resolutely and more constantly. It is especially an odious thing that we should be exposed to sale like vile slaves. But he testifies that this is done, when any 				one seduces us from the redemption of Christ. He calls those <i>feigned words</i> which are artfully formed for the purpose of deceiving.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">166</FONT></A>
 				 Unless then one is so mad as to sell the salvation of his soul to false teachers, let him close up every avenue that may lead to their wicked inventions. For the same purpose as before he repeats again, that their destruction delayed not, that is, that he might frighten the good from their society. For since they were given up to a sudden destruction, every one who connected himself with them, must have perished with them.</p>  <a name="vii.iii.ii"></A>

<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p2"></A><b>4.</b> For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast <i>them</i> down to hell, and delivered <i>them</i> into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p3"></A><b>4.</b> Si enim Angelis qui peccaverant, Deus non perpercit, sed catenis caliginis in tartarum praecipitatos tradidit servandos in judicium;</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p4"></A><b>5. </b>And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth <i>person</i>, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;</p>

<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p6"></A><b>6.</b> And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes, condemned <i>them</i> with an overthrow, making <i>them</i> an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;</p>

<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p8"></A><b>7.</b> And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:</p>

<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p10"></A><b>8.</b> (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed <i>his</i> righteous soul from day to day with <i>their</i> unlawful deeds;)</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p11"></A><b>8.</b> Nam oculis et auribus justus ille, quum habitaret inter ipsos quotidie animam justam iniquis illorum operibus excruciabat;</p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iii.ii-p13"></A><a name="vii.iii.ii-p13.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p14"></A><b>4.</b><i> For if.</i> We have stated how much it behoves us to know that the ungodly, who by their mischievous opinions corrupt the Church, cannot escape God&#8217;s vengeance; and this he proves especially by three remarkable examples of God's judgment, &#8212; that he spared not even angels, that he once destroyed the whole world by a deluge, 				that he reduced Sodom to ashes, and other neighboring cities. But Peter thought it sufficient to take as granted what ought to be never doubted by us, that is, that God is the judge of the whole world. It hence follows that the punishment he formerly inflicted on the ungodly and wicked, he will now also inflict on the like characters. For he can never be unlike himself, nor does he shew respect of persons, so as to forgive the same wickedness in one which he has punished in another; but he 				hates injustice and wrong equally, whenever it is found.   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">167</FONT></A>
</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p16"></A>For we must always bear in mind that there is a difference between God and men; for men indeed judge unequally, but God keeps the same course in judging. For that he forgives sins, this is done because he blots them out through repentance and faith. He therefore does not otherwise reconcile himself to us than by justifying us; for until sin is taken away, there is always an occasion of discord between us and Him.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p17"></A>As to <i>the angels.</i> The argument is from the greater to the less; for they were far more excellent than we are, and yet their dignity did not preserve them from the hand of God; much less then can mortal men escape, when they follow them in their impiety. But as Peter mentions here but briefly the fall of angels, and as he has 				not named the time and the manner and other circumstances, it behoves us soberly to speak on the subject. Most men are curious and make no end of inquiries on these things; but since God in Scripture has only sparingly touched on them, and as it were by the way, he thus reminds us that we ought to be satisfied with this small knowledge. And indeed they who curiously inquire, do not regard edification, but seek to feed their souls with vain speculations. What is useful to us, God has made known, 				that is, that the devils were at first created, that they might serve and obey God, but that through their own fault they apostatized, because they would not submit to the authority of God; and that thus the wickedness found in them was accidental, and not from nature, so that it could not be ascribed to God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p18"></A>All this Peter declares very clearly, when he says that angels fell, though superior to men; and Jude is still more express when he writes, that they kept not their first estate, or their pre-eminence. [<a name="vii.iii.ii-p18.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#006">Jude 1:6</a><a name="vii.iii.ii-p18.1"></A>.] Let those who are not satisfied with these testimonies have recourse to the Sorbonian theology, which will teach them respecting angels to 				satiety, so as to precipitate them to hell together with the devils.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p19"></A><i>Chains of darkness.</i> This metaphor intimates that they are held bound in darkness until the last day. And the comparison is taken from malefactors, who, after having been condemned, suffer half of their punishment by the severity of the prison, until they are drawn forth to their final doom. We may hence learn, not only what punishment the wicked 				suffer after death, but also what is the condition of the children of God: for they calmly acquiesce in the hope of sure and perfect blessedness, though they do not as yet enjoy it; as the former suffer dreadful agonies on account of the vengeance prepared for them.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iii.ii-p20"></A><a name="vii.iii.ii-p20.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p21"></A><b>5.</b> <i>The old world.</i> The import of what he says is, that God, after having drowned the human race, formed again as it were a new world. This is also an argument from the greater to the less; for how can the wicked escape the deluge of divine wrath, since the whole world was once destroyed by it? For by 				saying that eight only were saved, he intimates that a multitude would not be a shield against God to protect the wicked; but that as many as sin shall be punished, be they few or many in number.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p22"></A>But it may be asked why he calls Noah <i>the preacher of righteousness.</i> Some understand that he was the preacher of the righteousness of God, inasmuch as Scripture commends God's righteousness, because he defends his own and restores them, when dead, to life. But I rather think that he is called the preacher of righteousness, 				because he labored to restore a degenerated world to a sound mind, and this not only by his teaching and godly exhortations, but also by his anxious toil in building the ark for the term of a hundred and twenty years. Now, the design of the Apostle is to set before our eyes God&#8217;s wrath against the wicked, so as to encourage us at the same time to imitate the saints.  				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">168</FONT></A>

<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p25"></A><b>6</b>  <i>The cities of Sodom.</i> This was so memorable an example of Divine vengeance, that when the Scripture speaks of the universal destruction of the ungodly, it alludes commonly to this as the type. Hence Peter says, that these cities were made an example. This may, indeed, be 				truly said of others; but Peter points out something singular, because it was the chief and a lively image; yea, rather, because the Lord designed that his wrath against the ungodly should be made known to all ages; as when he redeemed his people from Egypt, he has set forth to us by that one favor the perpetual safety of his Church. Jude has also expressed the same thing, calling it the punishment of eternal fire. [<a name="vii.iii.ii-p25.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#007">Jude 1:7</a><a name="vii.iii.ii-p25.1"></A>.]</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iii.ii-p26"></A><a name="vii.iii.ii-p26.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p27"></A><b>8.</b> <i>In seeing and hearing.</i> The common explanation is, that Lot was just in his eyes and ears, because all his senses abhorred the crimes of Sodom. However, another view may be taken of his <i>seeing and hearing</i>, so as to make this the meaning, that when 				the just man lived among the Sodomites, he tormented his soul by seeing and hearing; for we know that he was constrained to see and hear many things which greatly vexed his mind. The purport of what is said then is, that though the holy man was surrounded with every kind of monstrous wickedness, he yet never turned aside from his upright course.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.ii-p28"></A>But Peter expresses more than before, that is, that just Lot underwent voluntary sorrows; as it is right that all the godly should feel no small grief when they see the world rushing into every kind of evil, so the more necessary it is that they should groan for their own sins. And Peter expressly mentioned this, lest when impiety everywhere prevails, we should be captivated and inebriated by the allurements of vices, and perish 				together with others, but that we might prefer this grief, blessed by the Lord, to all the pleasures of the world.</p>  <a name="vii.iii.iii"></A>  			  				 				     				  
<p class="TableCaption16"><a name="vii.iii.iii-p1"></A><a name="vii.iii.iii-p1.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#009">2 Peter 2:9-11</a><a name="vii.iii.iii-p1.1"></A></p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p2"></A><b>9.</b> The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p3"></A><b>9.</b> Novit Dominus pios ex tentatione eripere; injustos autem in diem judicii puniendos servare;</p> 				    				 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p4"></A><b>10.</b> But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous <i>are they</i>, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p6"></A><b>11.</b> Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.</p> 				     				  
<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p7"></A><b>11.</b> Quum angeli, qui sunt robore et potentia majores, non ferant adversus illas coram Domino contumeliosum judicium.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p10"></A><b>9.</b> <i>The Lord knoweth.</i> What first offends the weak is, that when the faithful anxiously seek aid, they are not immediately helped by God; but on the contrary he suffers them sometimes as it were to pine away through daily weariness and languor; and secondly, when the wicked grow wanton with impunity 				and God in the meantime is silent, as though he connived at their evil deeds. This double offense Peter now removes; for he testifies that the Lord knows when it is expedient to deliver the godly from temptation. By these words he reminds us that this office ought to be left to him, and that therefore we ought to endure temptations, and not to faint, when at any time he defers his vengeance against the ungodly.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p11"></A>This consolation is very necessary for us, for this thought is apt to creep in, &#8220;If the Lord would have his own to be safe, why does he not gather them all into some corner of the earth, that they may mutually stimulate one another to holiness? why does he mingle them with the wicked by whom they may be defiled?&#8221; But when God claims to himself the office of helping, and protecting his own, that they may not fail in the contest, we 				gather courage to fight more strenuously. The meaning of the first clause is, that this law is prescribed by the Lord to all the godly, that they are to be proved by various temptations, but that they are to entertain good hope of success, because they are never to be deprived of his aid and help.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p12"></A><i>And to reserve the unjust.</i> By this clause he shews that God so regulates his judgments as to bear with the wicked for a time, but not to leave them unpunished. Thus he corrects too much haste, by which we are wont to be carried headlong, especially when the atrocity of wickedness grievously wounds us, for we then wish God to fulminate without 				delay; when he does not do so, he seems no longer to be the judge of the world. Lest, then, this temporary impunity of wickedness should disturb us, Peter reminds us that a day of judgment has been appointed by the Lord; and that, therefore, the wicked shall by no means escape punishment, though it be not immediately inflicted.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p13"></A>There is an emphasis in the word <i>reserve,</i> as though he had said, that they shall not escape the hand of God, but be held bound as it were by hidden chains, that they may at a certain time be drawn forth to judgment. The participle <a name="vii.iii.iii-p13.1"></A>&#954;&#959;&#955;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#962;, though in the present tense, is yet to be thus explained, that they are reserved or kept to be punished, or, that they may be punished. For he bids us to rely on the expectation of the last judgment, so that in hope and patience we may fight till the end of life.</p>  			 
<p class="Normal"><a name="vii.iii.iii-p14"></A><a name="vii.iii.iii-p14.1"></A></p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p15"></A><b>10.</b> <i>But chiefly them.</i> He comes here to particulars, accommodating a general doctrine to his own purpose; for he had to do with men of desperate wickedness. He then shews that dreadful vengeance necessarily awaited them. For since God will punish all the wicked, how can they escape who abandon 				themselves like brute beasts to every kind of iniquity? <i>To walk after the flesh,</i> is to be given up to the flesh, like brute animals, who are not led by reason and judgment, but have the natural desire of their flesh as their chief guide. By <i>the lust of uncleanness</i> understand filthy and unbridled 				gratifications, when men, having cast away every virtuous feeling, and shaken off shame, are carried away into every uncleanness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p16"></A>This is the first mark by which he brands them, that they are impure men, given up to wickedness. Other marks follow, that they despised government, and feared not to calumniate and reproach men whom God had favored with honorable stations in life. But these words refer to the same thing; for after having said that they held government in contempt, he immediately points out the fountain of this evil, that they were 				<i>presumptuous,</i> or <i>audacious</i>, and <i>self-willed,</i> or <i>refractory</i>;   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">169</FONT></A>
 				 and lastly, that he might more fully exhibit their pride, he says that they did not fear nor tremble when they treated dignities with contempt. For it is a monstrous arrogance to regard as nothing the glory which shines forth in dignities appointed by God.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p18"></A>But there is no doubt but that in these words he refers to the imperial and magisterial power; for though there is no lawful station in life which is not worthy of respect, yet we know that the magisterial office excels every other, because in governing mankind God himself is represented. Then truly glorious is that power in which God himself appears.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p19"></A>We now perceive what the Apostle meant in this second clause, even that they of whom he speaks were frantic men, lovers of tumults and confusion; for no one can introduce anarchy (<a name="vii.iii.iii-p19.1"></A>&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#961;&#967;&#8055;&#945;&#957;) into the world without introducing disorder (<a name="vii.iii.iii-p19.2"></A>&#7936;&#964;&#945;&#958;&#8055;&#945;&#957;.) Now, these with bold effrontery vomited forth reproaches against magistrates, that they might take away every respect for public rights; and this was openly to fight against God by their blasphemies. There are also many turbulent men of this sort at the present day, who proudly declare that the power of the sword is heathen and unlawful, and furiously attempt to subvert all government. Such furies Satan excites, in order to disturb and 				prevent the progress of the gospel. But the Lord hath dealt favorably with us; for he hath not only warned us to beware of this deadly poison, but hath also by this ancient example fortified us against this scandal. Hence the Papists act very dishonestly, when they accuse us, and say that seditious men are made so by our doctrine. The same thing might indeed have been alleged against the apostles formerly; and yet they were as far as possible from encouraging any such wickedness.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iii.iii-p21"></A><b>11.</b><i> Whereas angels.</i> He hence shews their rash arrogance, because they dared to assume more liberty than even angels. But it seems strange that he says that angels do not bring a railing accusation against magistrates; for why should they be adverse to that sacred order, the author of which they know to be God? Why should 				they oppose rulers whom they know to be exercising the same ministry with themselves? This reasoning has made some to think that the devils are meant; but they do not thus by any means escape the difficulty. For how could Satan be so moderate as to spare men, since he is the author of every blasphemy against God? And further, their opinion is refuted by what Jude says.

He, however, says, that men deserving hatred and execration, were not condemned by them in order that they might shew respect to a power divinely appointed.

It may not unaptly be thus explained, &#8220;Feasting with you, they insolently 				deride you by their errors.&#8221; I, however, have given the version which seems the most probable, &#8220;luxuriating in their errors, feasting with you.&#8221; He calls the libidinous such as had eyes full of adultery, and who were incessantly led to sin without restraint, as it appears from what is afterwards said.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iii.iv-p27"></A><b>14.</b><i> Beguiling, </i>or <i>baiting</i>, <i>unstable souls.</i> By the metaphor of <i>baiting</i> he reminds the faithful to beware of their hidden and 				deceitful arts; for he compares their impostures to hooks which may catch the unwary to their destruction. By adding <i>unstable souls</i> he shews the reason for caution, that is, when we have not struck firm roots in faith and in the fear of the Lord: and he intimates at the same time, that they have no excuse who suffer themselves to be baited or lured by such flatteries; for this must have been ascribed to their levity.

It ought not, 				however, to be confined to covetousness.

He compares them to Balaam, the son of Bozor, who employed a venal tongue to curse God&#8217;s people. And to shew that they were not worthy of a long refutation, he says that Balaam was reproved by an ass, and that 				thus his madness was condemned. But by this means also he restrains the faithful from associating with them. For it was a dreadful judgment of God, that the angel made himself known to the ass before he did to the prophet, so that the ass, perceiving God displeased, dared not to advance farther, but went back, when the prophet, under the blind impulse of his own avarice, pushed forward against the evident prohibition of the Lord. For what was afterwards answered to him, that he was to proceed, 				was an evidence of God's indignation rather than a permission. In short, as the greatest indignity to him, the mouth of the ass was opened, that he who had been unwilling to submit to God's authority might have that as his teacher. And by this miracle the Lord designed to shew how monstrous a thing it was to change the truth to a lie.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iii.iv-p32"></A>It may be here asked, by what right Balaam had the name of a prophet, when it appears that he was addicted to many wicked superstitions. To this I reply, that the gift of prophecy was so special, that though he did not worship the true God, and had not true religion, he might yet have been endued with it. Besides, God has sometimes caused prophecy to exist in the midst of idolatry, in order that men might have less excuse.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.iv-p33"></A>Now, if any one considers the chief things which Peter says, he will see that his warning is equally suitable to the present age; for it is an evil which prevails everywhere, that men use scurrilous raillery for the purpose of deriding God and the Savior; nay, they ridicule all religion under the cloak of wit; and when addicted, like beasts, to their own lusts, they will mingle with the faithful; they prattle something about the gospel, 				and yet they prostitute their tongue to the service of the devil, that they may bring the whole world, as far as they can, to eternal perdition. They are in this respect worse than Balaam himself, because they gratuitously pour forth their maledictions, when he, induced by reward, attempted to curse.</p>  <a name="vii.iii.v"></A>

 				 He means that they dazzled the eyes of the simple by high-flown stuff of words, that they might not perceive their deceit, for it was not easy to captivate their minds with such dotages, except they were first besotted by some artifice. He then says that they used an inflated kind of words and speech, that they might fill the unwary with admiration. And then this grandiloquence, which the ample lungs of the soul send forth, (as Persius says,   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">173</FONT></A>
 				) was very suitable to cover their shifts and trumperies. There was formerly a craft of this kind in Valentinus, and in those like him, as we learn from the books of Irenaeus. They made words unheard of before, by the empty sound of which, the unlearned being smitten, they were ensnared by their reveries.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.v-p18"></A>There are fanatics of a similar kind at this day, who call themselves by the plausible title of Libertines or free-men. For they talk most confidently of the Spirit and of spiritual things, as though they roared out from above the clouds, and fascinate many by their tricks and wiles, so that you may say that the Apostle has correctly prophesied of them. For they treat all things jocosely and scoffingly; and though they are great 				simpletons, yet as they indulge in all vices, they find favor with their own people by a sort of drollery. The state of the case is this, that when the difference between good and evil is removed, everything becomes lawful; and men, loosed from all subjection to laws, obey their own lusts. This Epistle, therefore, is not a little suitable to our age.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.v-p19"></A><i>They allure,</i> or <i>bait</i>, <i>through the lusts of the flesh.</i> He strikingly compares to hooks the allurements of the ungodly, when they make anything they please lawful; for as the lusts of men are headstrong and 				craving, as soon as liberty is offered, they lay hold on it with great avidity; but soon afterwards the strangling hook within is perceived.

<p><a name="vii.iii.v-p20"></A>He says that they who had really escaped from the society of those in error were again deceived by a new kind of error, even when the reins were let loose to them for the indulgence of every sort of intemperance. He hereby reminds us how dangerous are the wiles of these men. For it was already a dreadful thing that blindness and thick darkness possessed almost all mankind. It was, therefore, in a manner a double prodigy, that men, freed 				from the common errors of the world, should, after having received the light of God, be brought back to a beastly indifference. Let us be reminded of what we ought especially to beware of, after having been once enlightened, that is, lest Satan entice us under the pretense of liberty, so as to give ourselves up to lasciviousness to gratify the lusts of the flesh. But they are safe from this danger who seriously attend to the study of holiness.</p>

This reason, however, does not seem to be sufficiently valid, because it sometimes happens that 				wicked men, and wholly unacquainted with Christ, preach usefully concerning the benefits and blessings of Christ. But we must observe, that what is condemned here is vicious doctrine, connected with impurity of life; for the Apostle's design was to obviate the deceptive allurements by which they ensnared the foolish. The name of liberty is sweet, and they abused it for this end, that the hearer, being loosed from the fear of the divine law, might abandon himself unto unbridled licentiousness. 				But the liberty which Christ has procured for us, and which he offers daily by the gospel, is altogether different, for he has exempted us from the yoke of the law as far as it subjects us to a curse, that he might also deliver us from the dominion of sin, as far as it subjects us to its own lusts. Hence, where lusts reign, and therefore where the flesh rules, there the liberty of Christ has no place whatever. The Apostle then declares this to all the godly, that they might not desire any other 				liberty but that which leads those, who are set free from sin, to a willing obedience to righteousness.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.v-p23"></A>We hence learn that there have ever been depraved men who made a false pretense to liberty, and that this has been an old cunning trick of Satan. We need not wonder that at this day the same filth is stirred up by fanatical men.</p>

In the second place, since we teach nothing respecting Christian liberty but what is derived from Christ and his Apostles, and 				at the same time require the mortification of the flesh, and the proper exercises for subduing it, much more strictly than they do who slander us, they vomit forth their curses, not so much against us as against the Son of God, whom we have as our certain teacher and authority.</p>

By <i>the knowledge of Christ</i> he no doubt understands the gospel. He testifies that the design of it is, to 				deliver us from the defilements of the world, and to lead us far away from them. For the same reason he afterwards calls it <i>the way of righteousness.</i> He then alone makes a right progress in the gospel who faithfully learns Christ; and he truly knows Christ, who has been taught by him to put off the old man and to put on the new man, as Paul reminds us in <a name="vii.iii.vi-p11.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#022">Eph 4:22</a><a name="vii.iii.vi-p11.1"></A>   				&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">174</FONT></A>

<p><a name="vii.iii.vi-p14"></A><b>21. </b>By saying that having forsaken <i>the commandment delivered unto them,</i> they returned to their own pollutions, he intimates first, how inexcusable they were; and secondly, he reminds us that the doctrine of a holy and virtuous life, though common to all and indiscriminately 				belonging to all, is yet peculiarly taught to those whom God favors with the light of his gospel. But he declares that they who make themselves slaves again to the pollutions of the world fall away from the gospel. The faithful also do indeed sin; but as they allow not dominion to sin, they do not fall away from the grace of God, nor do they renounce the profession of sound doctrine which they have once embraced. For they are not to be deemed conquered, while they strenuously resist the flesh 				and its lusts.</p>

<p><a name="vii.iii.vi-p16"></A><b>22.</b> <i>But it has happened unto them.</i> As the example disturbs many, when men who had submitted to the obedience of Christ, rush headlong into vices without fear or shame, the Apostle, in order to remove the offense, says that this happens through their own fault, and that because they are pigs and dogs. 				It hence follows that no part of the sin can be ascribed to the gospel.</p>  			 
<p><a name="vii.iii.vi-p17"></A>For this purpose he quotes two ancient proverbs, the first of which is found as the saying of Solomon in <a name="vii.iii.vi-p17.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro026.htm#011">Pr 26:11</a><a name="vii.iii.vi-p17.1"></A>. But what Peter meant is briefly this, that the gospel is a medicine which purges us by wholesome vomiting, but that there are many dogs who swallow again what they have vomited to their own ruin; and that the gospel is also a 				laver which cleanses all our uncleanness, but that there are many swine who, immediately after washing, roll themselves again in the mud. At the same time the godly are reminded to take heed to themselves, except they wish to be deemed dogs or swine.</p>

And this is the rendering of <i>Macknight.</i> And he says, that the Apostle had probably in view the fables concerning the visions of angels and the miracles performed at the sepulchres of departed saints, which the false 					 teachers in the early ages, and the monks in latter times, fabricated, to draw money from the people.
