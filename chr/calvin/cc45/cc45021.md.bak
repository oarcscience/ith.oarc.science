<span id="vi.iv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="vi.iv.i"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.i-p1"></span><span id="vi.iv.i-p1.1"></span>[James
3:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.iv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.i-p2"></span>**1** My brethren, be not many masters,
knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p3"></span>**1** Nolite plures magistri fieri, fratres
mei; scientes quod majus judicium sumpturi sumus.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p4"></span>**2** For in many things we offend all. If
any man offend not in word, the same *is* a perfect man, *and* able also
to bridle the whole body.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p5"></span>**2** In multis enim labimur omnes: si quis
in sermone non labitur, hic perfectus est vir, ut qui posssit fraeno
moderari totum etiam corpus.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p6"></span>**3** Behold, we put bits in the horses’
mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p7"></span>**3** Ecce equis fraena in ora injicimus,
ut obediant nobis; et totum illorum corpus circumagimus:

<span id="vi.iv.i-p8"></span>**4** Behold also the ships, which though
*they be* so great, and *are* driven of fierce winds, yet are they
turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p9"></span>**4** Ecce etiam naves, cum tantae sint, et
a saevis ventis pulsentur, circumagnuntur a minimo gubernaculo,
quocunque affectus dirigentis voluerit:

<span id="vi.iv.i-p10"></span>**5** Even so the tongue is a little
member, and boasteth great things.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p11"></span>**5** Ita et lingua pusillum membrum est,
et magna jactat.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p12"></span> 

<span id="vi.iv.i-p13"></span><span id="vi.iv.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.i-p14"></span>**1** *Be not many masters*. The common
and almost universal interpretation of this passage is, that the Apostle
discourages the desire for the office of teaching, and for this reason,
because it is dangerous, and exposes one to a heavier judgment, in case
he transgresses: and they think that he said*, Be not many masters*,
because there ought to have been some. But I take masters not to be
those who performed a public duty in the Church, but such as took upon
them the right of passing judgment upon others: for such reprovers
sought to be accounted as masters of morals. And it has a mode of
speaking usual among the Greeks as well as Latins, that they were called
masters who superciliously animadverted on others.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p15"></span>And that he forbade them to be many, it
was done for this reason, because many everywhere did thrust in
themselves; for it is, as it were, an innate disease in mankind to seek
reputation by blaming others. And, in this respect, a twofold vice
prevails — though few excel in wisdom, yet all intrude indiscriminately
into the office of masters; and then few are influenced by a right
feeling, for hypocrisy and ambition stimulate them, and not a care for
the salvation of their brethren. For it is to be observed, that James
does not discourage those brotherly admonitions, which the Spirit so
often and so much recommends to us, but that immoderate desire to
condemn, which proceeds from ambition and pride, when any one exalts
himself against his neighbor, slanders, carps, bites, and malignantly
seeks for what he may turn to a sinister purpose: for this is usually
done when impertinent censors of this kind insolently boast themselves
in the work of exposing the vices of others.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p16"></span>From this outrage and annoyance James
recalls us; and he adds a reason, because they who are thus severe
towards others shall undergo a heavier judgment: for he imposes a hard
law on himself, who tries the words and deeds of others according to the
rule of extreme rigor; nor does he deserve pardon, who will pardon none.
This truth ought to be carefully observed, that they who are too rigid
towards their brethren, provoke against themselves the severity of God.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p17"></span><span id="vi.iv.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.i-p18"></span>**2** *For in many things we offend all*.
This may be taken as having been said by way of concession, as though he
had said, “Be it that thou findest what is blamable in thy brethren, for
no one is free from sins; but dost thou think that thou art perfect who
usest a slanderous and virulent tongue?” But James seems to me to exhort
us by this argument to meekness, since we are ourselves also surrounded
with many infirmities; for he acts unjustly who denies to others the
pardon he needs himself. So also Paul says, when he bids the fallen to
be reproved kindly, and in the spirit of meekness; for he immediately
adds,

<span id="vi.iv.i-p19"></span>“considering thyself, lest thou also be
tempted.”  
(<span id="vi.iv.i-p19.2"></span>[Ga
6:1](../../../bib/kjv/gal006.htm#001)<span id="vi.iv.i-p19.2"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.iv.i-p20"></span>For there is nothing which serves more to
moderate extreme rigor than the knowledge of our own infirmity.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p21"></span>*If any man offend not in word*. After
having said that there is no one who does not sin in many things, he now
shews that the disease of evil-speaking is more odious than other sins;
for by saying that he who offends not with his tongue is *perfect*, he
intimates that the restraining of the tongue is a great virtue, and one
of the chief virtues. Hence they act most perversely who curiously
examine every fault, even the least, and yet so grossly indulge
themselves.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p22"></span>He then indirectly touches here on the
hypocrisy of censors, because in examining themselves they omitted the
chief thing, and that was of great moment even their evil-speaking; for
they who reproved others pretended a zeal for perfect holiness, but they
ought to have begun with the tongue, if they wished to be perfect. As
they made no account of bridling the tongue, but, on the contrary, did
bite and tear others, they exhibited only a fictitious sanctity. It is
hence evident that they were the most reprehensible of all, because they
neglected a primary virtue. This connection renders the meaning of the
Apostle plain to us.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p23"></span><span id="vi.iv.i-p23.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.i-p24"></span>**3** *We put bits in the horses’ mouths*.
By these two comparisons he proves that a great part of true perfection
is in the tongue, and that it exercises dominion, as he has just said,
over the whole life. He compares the tongue, first, to a bridle, and
then to a helm of a ship. Though a horse be a ferocious animal, yet he
is turned about at the will of its rider, because he is bridled; no less
can the tongue serve to govern man. So also with regard to the helm of a
ship, which guides a large vessel and surmounts the impetuosity of
winds. Though the tongue be a small member, yet it avails much in
regulating the life of man.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p25"></span><span id="vi.iv.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.i-p26"></span>*And boasteth great things*. The verb
<span id="vi.iv.i-p26.1"></span>μεγαλαυχεῖν means to boast one’s self,
or to vaunt. But James in this passage did not intend to reprove
ostentation so much as to show that the tongue is the doer of great
things; for in this last clause he applies the previous comparisons to
his subject; and vain boasting is not suitable to the bridle and the
helm. He then means that the tongue is endued with great power.

<span id="vi.iv.i-p27"></span>I have rendered what Erasmus has
translated the *impetuosity*, the *inclination*, of the pilot or guide;
for <span id="vi.iv.i-p27.1"></span>ὁρμὴ means desire. I indeed allow
that among the Greeks it designates those lusts which are not
subservient to reason. But here James simply speaks of the will of the
pilot.

<span id="vi.iv.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p1"></span><span id="vi.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>[James
3:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#005.md)<span id="vi.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p2"></span>**5** — Behold, how great a matter a
little fire kindleth!

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p3"></span>**5** Ecce exiguus ignis quantam sylvam
incendit.

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p4"></span>**6** And the tongue *is* a fire, a world
of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the
whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on
fire of hell.

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p5"></span>**6** Et lingua ignis est, et mundus
iniquitatis: sic inquam lingua constituta est in membris nostris,
inquinans totum corpus, inflammans rotam nativitatis, et inflammatur a
gehenna.

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p7"></span><span id="vi.iv.ii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p8"></span>He now explains the evils which proceed
from the neglect of restraining the tongue, in order that we may know
that the tongue may do much good or much evil, — that if it be modest
and well regulated, it becomes a bridle to the whole life, but that if
it be petulant and violent, like a fire it destroys all things.

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p9"></span>He represents it as a *small* or *little
fire*, to intimate that this smallness of the tongue will not be a
hindrance that its power should not extend far and wide to do harm.

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p10"></span>**6**. By adding that it is *a world of
iniquity*, it is the same as though he had called it the sea or the
abyss. And he suitably connects the smallness of the tongue with the
vastness of the world; according to this meaning, A slender portion of
flesh contains in it the whole world of iniquity.

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p11"></span>*So is the tongue*. He explains what he
meant by the term *world*, even because the contagion of the tongue
spreads through every part of life; or rather he shews what he
understood by the metaphor *fire*, even that the tongue pollutes the
whole man. He however immediately returns to the fire, and says, that
the *whole course of nature* is set on fire by the tongue. And he
compares human life to a course or a wheel: and <span
id="vi.iv.ii-p11.1"></span>γένεσις, as before, he takes for nature,
(<span id="vi.iv.ii-p11.2"></span>[Jas
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#023.md)<span
id="vi.iv.ii-p11.2"></span>.)

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p12"></span>The meaning is, that when other vices are
corrected by age or by the succession of time, or when at least then do
not possess the whole man, the vice of the tongue spreads and prevails
over every part of life; except one prefers to take *setting on fire* as
signifying a violent impulse, for we call that fervid which is
accompanied with violence. And thus Horace speaks of wheels, for he
calls chariots in battle fervid, on account of their rapidity. The
meaning then would be, that the tongue is like untamed horses; for as
these draw violently the chariots, so the tongue hurries a man headlong
by its own wantonness.  <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md)

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p14"></span>When he says that it is *set on fire by
hell*, it is the same as though he had said, that the outrageousness of
the tongue is the flame of the infernal fire.  <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) For as heathen poets imagined that the
wicked are tormented by the torches of the Furies; so it is true, that
Satan by the fans of temptations kindles the fire of all evils in the
world: but James means, that fire, sent by Satan, is most easily caught
by the tongue, so that it immediately burns; in short, that it is a
material fitted for receiving or fostering and increasing the fire of
hell.

<span id="vi.iv.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p1"></span><span id="vi.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>[James
3:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p2"></span>**7** For every kind of beasts, and of
birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath
been tamed of mankind:

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p3"></span>**7** Omnis enim natura ferarum et
volucrum et serpentium et marinorum, a natura humana domatur et dimota
est:

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p4"></span>**8** But the tongue can no man tame; *it
is* an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p5"></span>**8** Linguam vero nullus hominum domare
potest, incoercibile malum, plena veneno mortifero.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p6"></span>**9** Therewith bless we God, even the
Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude
of God.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p7"></span>**9** Per ipsam benedicimus Deum et
Patrem; et per ipsam execramur homines ad similitudinem ejus factos.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p8"></span>**10** Out of the same mouth proceedeth
blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p9"></span>**10** Ex eodem ore procedit benedictio
et maledictio. Non onvenit, fratres mei, haec ita fieri.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p10"></span>**11** Doth a fountain send forth at the
same place sweet *water* and bitter?

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p11"></span>**11** An fons ex codem foramine ejicit
dulce et amarum?

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p12"></span>**12** Can the fig tree, my brethren,
bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so *can* no fountain both yield
salt water and fresh.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p13"></span>**12** Non potest, fratres mei, ficus
oleas proferre; aut vitis ficus; sic nullus fons salsam et dulcem
gignere aquam.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p14"></span> 

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p15"></span><span id="vi.iv.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p16"></span>**7** *For every kind of beasts*. This
is a confirmation of the last clause; for that Satan by the tongue rules
most effectively he proves by this — that it can by no means be brought
to due order; and he amplifies this by comparisons. For he says that
there is no animal so savage or fierce, which is not tamed by the skill
of man, — that fishes, which in a manner inhabit another world, — that
birds, which are so quick and roving — and that serpents, which are so
inimical to mankind, are sometimes tamed. Since then the tongue cannot
be restrained, there must be some secret fire of hell hidden in it.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p17"></span>What he says of wild beasts, of
serpents, and of other animals, is not to be understood of them all; it
is enough that the skill of man should subdue and tame some of the most
ferocious of them, and also that serpents are sometimes tamed. He refers
to present and to past time: the present regards power and capacity, and
the past, usage or experience. He hence justly concludes that the tongue
is full of deadly poison.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p18"></span>Though all these things most suitably
refer in the first place to the subject of this passage — that they
claim an unreasonable command over others, who labor under a worse vice;
yet a universal doctrine may be understood as taught here, — that if we
desire to form our life aright, we must especially strive to restrain
the tongue, for no part of man does more harm.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p19"></span><span id="vi.iv.iii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p20"></span>**9** *Therewith*, or, *by it, bless we
God*. It is a clear instance of its deadly poison, that it can thus
through a monstrous levity transform itself; for when it pretends to
bless God, it immediately curses him in his own image, even by cursing
men. For since God ought to be blessed in all his works, he ought to be
so especially as to men, in whom his image and glory peculiarly shine
forth. It is then a hypocrisy not to be borne, when man employs the same
tongue in blessing God and in cursing men. There can be then no calling
on God, and his praises must necessarily cease, when evil-speaking
prevails; for it is impious profanation of God’s name, which the tongue
is virulent towards our brethren and pretends to praise him. That he may
therefore rightly praise God, the view of evil speaking as to our
neighbor must especially be corrected.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p21"></span><span id="vi.iv.iii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p22"></span>This particular truth ought also to be
borne in mind, that severe censors discover their own virulence, which
they suddenly vomit forth against their brethren whatever curses they
can imagine, after having in sweet strains offered praises to God. Were
any one to object and say, that the image of God in human nature has
been blotted out by the sin of Adam; we must, indeed, confess that it
has been miserably deformed, but in such a way that some of its
lineaments still appear. Righteousness and rectitude, and the freedom of
choosing what is good, have been lost; but many excellent endowments, by
which we excel the brutes, still remain. He, then, who truly worships
and honors God, will be afraid to speak slanderously of man.

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p23"></span><span id="vi.iv.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p24"></span>**11** *Doth a fountain*. He adduces
these comparisons in order to shew that a cursing tongue is something
monstrous, contrary to all nature, and subverts the order everywhere
established by God. For God hath so arranged things which are contrary,
that inanimate things ought to deter us from a chaotic mixture, sure as
is found in a double tongue.  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md)

<span id="vi.iv.iv"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p1"></span><span id="vi.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>[James
3:13-18](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p2"></span>**13** Who *is* a wise man and endued with
knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works
with meekness of wisdom.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p3"></span>**13** Quis sapiens et intelligens inter
vos? ostendat ex honesta conversatione opera sua in mansuetudine
sapientiae.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p4"></span>**14** But if ye have bitter envying and
strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p5"></span>**14** Si vero aemulationem amaraem
habetis, et contentionem in corde vestro, ne gloriemini, et mentiamini
adversus veritatem.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p6"></span>**15** This wisdom descendeth not from
above, but *is* earthly, sensual, devilish.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p7"></span>**15** Non est haec sapientia de sursum
veniens, sed terrestris, animalis, daemonica.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p8"></span>**16** For where envying and strife *is*,
there *is* confusion and every evil work.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p9"></span>**16** Ubi enim aemulatio et contentio,
ibi perturbatio et omne pravum opus.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p10"></span>**17** But the wisdom that is from above
is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, *and* easy to be intreated, full
of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p11"></span>**17** Quae autem e sursum est sapientia,
primum pura est, deinde pacata, aequa, comis, plena misericordiae et
bonorum operum, sine disquisitione, sine simulatione.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p12"></span>**18** And the fruit of righteousness is
sown in peace of them that make peace.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p13"></span>**18** Fructus autem justitiae in pace
seminatur facientibus pacem.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p14"></span> 

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p15"></span><span id="vi.iv.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p16"></span>**13** *Who is a wise man*. As the lust
of slandering arises mostly from pride, and as the false conceit of
wisdom for the most part generates pride, he therefore speaks here of
wisdom. It is usual with hypocrites to exalt and shew off themselves by
criminating all others, as the case was formerly with many of the
philosophers, who sought glory for themselves by a bitter abuse of all
other orders. Such haughtiness as slanderous men swell with and are
blinded by, James checked, by denying that the conceit of wisdom, with
which men flatter themselves, has in it anything divine; but, on the
contrary, he declares that it proceeds from the devil.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p17"></span>Then the meaning is, that supercilious
censors, who largely indulge themselves, and at the same time spare
none, seem to themselves to be very wise, but are greatly mistaken; for
the Lord teaches his people far otherwise, even to be meek, and to be
courteous to others. They, then, are alone wise in the sight of God, who
connect this meekness with an honest conversation; for they who are
severe and inexorable, though they may excel others in many virtues, do
not yet follow the right way of wisdom.  <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md)

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p20"></span><span id="vi.iv.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p21"></span>**l4** *But if ye have bitter envying*.
He points out the fruits which proceed from that extreme austerity which
is contrary to meekness; for immoderate rigor necessarily begets
mischievous emulations, which presently break forth into contentions. It
is, indeed, an improper mode of speaking, to place contentions in the
heart; but this affects not the meaning; for the object was to shew that
the evil disposition of the heart is the fountain of these evils.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p22"></span>He has called *envying*, or *emulation*,
*bitter*; for it prevails not, except when minds are so infected with
the poison of malignity, that they turn all things into bitterness.
 <span id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md)

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p24"></span>That we may then really glory that we are
the children of God, he bids us to act calmly and meekly towards our
brethren; otherwise he declares that we are lying in assuming the
Christian name. But it is not without reason that he has added the
associate of envying, even *strife*, or contention, for contests and
quarrels ever arise from malignity and envy.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p25"></span><span id="vi.iv.iv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p26"></span>**15** *This wisdom descendeth not*. As
hypocrites with difficulty give way, he sharply checked their
haughtiness, denying that to be true wisdom with which they were
inflated, while they were extremely morose in searching out the vices of
others. Conceding to them, however, the term *wisdom*, he shews by the
words he applies to it its true character, and says that it is *earthly,
sensual, devilish*, or demoniac, while true wisdom must be heavenly,
spiritual, divine; which three things are directly contrary to the three
preceding ones. For James takes it as granted, that we are not wise,
except when we are illuminated by God from above through his Spirit.
However, then, the mind of man may enlarge itself, all its acuteness
will be vanity; and not only so, but being at length entangled in the
wiles of Satan, it will become wholly delirious.  <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md)

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p29"></span>*Sensual*, or *animal*, is in opposition
to what is spiritual, as in <span id="vi.iv.iv-p29.1"></span>[1Co
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md)<span id="vi.iv.iv-p29.1"></span>,
where Paul says that the sensual or animal man receives not the things
of God. And the pride of man could not have been more effectually cast
down, than when thus is condemned whatever wisdom he has from himself,
without the Spirit of God; nay, when from himself a transition is made
to the devil. For it is the same as though he had said, that men,
following their own sense, or minds, or feelings, soon became a prey to
the delusions of Satan.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p30"></span><span id="vi.iv.iv-p30.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p31"></span>**16** *For where envying is*. It is an
argument from what is contrary; for envying, by which hypocrites are
influenced, produces effects contrary to wisdom. For wisdom requires a
state of mind that is calm and composed, but envying disturbs it, so
that in itself it becomes in a manner tumultuous, and boils up
immoderately against others.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p32"></span>Some render <span
id="vi.iv.iv-p32.1"></span>ἀκαταστασία inconstancy, and sometimes it
means this, but as it signifies also sedition and tumult, perturbation
seems the most suitable to this passage. For James meant to express
something more than levity, even that the malignant and the slanderer
does everything confusedly and rashly, as though he were beside himself;
and hence he adds, *every evil work*

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p33"></span><span id="vi.iv.iv-p33.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p34"></span>**17** *But the wisdom which is from
above*. He now mentions the effects of celestial wisdom which are wholly
contrary to the former effects. He says first that it is *pure*; by
which term he excludes hypocrisy and ambition.  <span
id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) He, in the second place, calls it
*peaceable*, to intimate that it is not contentious. In the third place,
he calls it *kind* or humane, that we may know that it is far away from
that immoderate austerity which tolerates nothing in our brethren. He
also calls it *gentle* or tractable; by which he means that it widely
differs from pride and malignity. In the last place, he says that it is
*full of mercy*, etc., while hypocrisy is inhuman and inexorable. By
*good fruits* he generally refers to all those duties which benevolent
men perform towards their brethren; as though he had said, it is full of
benevolence. It hence follows, that they lie who glory in their cruel
austerity.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p36"></span>But though he had sufficiently condemned
hypocrisy, when he said that wisdom is *pure* or sincere; he makes it
more clear by repeating the same thing at the end. We are hence
reminded, that for no other reason are we beyond measure morose or
austere, but this, because we too much spare ourselves, and connive at
our own vices.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p37"></span>But what he says, *without discerning*
(<span id="vi.iv.iv-p37.1"></span>*sine dijudicatione*,) seems strange;
for the Spirit of God does not take away the difference between good and
evil; nor does he render us so senseless as to be so void of judgment as
to praise vice, and regard it as virtue. To this I reply, that James
here, by *discerning* or distinguishing refers to that overanxious and
overscrupulous inquiry, such as is commonly carried on by hypocrites,
who too minutely examine the sayings and doings of their brethren, and
put on them the worst construction.  <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md)

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p40"></span><span id="vi.iv.iv-p40.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p41"></span>**18** *And the fruit of righteousness*.
This admits of two meanings, — that fruit is sown by the peaceable,
which afterwards they gather, — or, that they themselves, though they
meekly tolerate many things in their neighbors, do not yet cease to sow
righteousness. It is, however, an anticipation of an objection; for they
who are carried away to evil speaking by the lust of slandering, have
always this excuse, “What! can we then remove evil by our
courteousness?” Hence James says, that those who are wise according to
God’s will, are so kind, meek, and merciful, as yet not to cover vices
nor favor them; but on the contrary in such a way as to strive to
correct them, and yet in a peaceable manner, that is, in moderation, so
that union is preserved. And thus he testifies that what he had hitherto
said tends in no degree to do away with calm reproofs; but that those
who wish to be physicians to heal vices ought not to be executioners.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p42"></span>He therefore adds, *by those who make
peace*; which ought to be thus explained: they who study peace, are
nevertheless careful to sow righteousness; nor are they slothful or
negligent in promoting and encouraging good works; but they moderate
their zeal with the condiment of peace, while hypocrites throw all
things into confusion by a blind and furious violence.

id="vi.iv.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p13"></span> “The course of nature,” or the compass
of nature, that is, all that is included in nature, means evidently the
same with “the whole body” in the preceding clause. There is no sense,
compatible with the passage, in what some have suggested, “the whole
course of life;” for what idea is conveyed, when we say that the tongue
inflames or sets in a flame the whole course of life? But there is an
intelligible meaning, when it is said, that the tongue sets in a flame
the whole machinery of our nature, every faculty that belongs to man.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[122](cc45021.htm#fr_121.md) <span

<span id="vi.iv.ii-p15"></span> “A bad tongue is the organ of the
devil.” — *Estius*.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[123](cc45021.htm#fr_122.md) <span
id="vi.iv.iii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iii-p25"></span> There is a different reading at the end
of the <span id="vi.iv.iii-p25.1"></span>[Jas
3:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam003.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.iv.iii-p25.1"></span>, adopted by *Griesbach*, though rejected by
Mill and others: <span id="vi.iv.iii-p25.2"></span>οὕτως οὔτε ἁλυχὸν
γλυχὺ ποιὢσαι ὕδωρ, “So neither can salt water produce sweet.” This
reading is favored by the *Syr.* and *Vulg.*, though the words are
somewhat different.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[124](cc45021.htm#fr_123.md) <span
id="vi.iv.iv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p18"></span> “Who is wise and intelligent among you?”
let him by a good conduct shew his works in meekness of wisdom.”

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p19"></span>The arrangement here is according to what
is common in scripture: Wisdom the effect first, then knowledge the
cause or what precedes it. In what follows the order is reversed;
knowledge distinguishes between good and bad works, and the good ought
to be exhibited with that meekness which wisdom dictates.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[125](cc45021.htm#fr_124.md) <span
id="vi.iv.iv-p22.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p23"></span> A similar order as to the words is found
here as in the former verse: bitter envying is occasioned by strife of
contention. There may be envying without contention, but it is
contention that commonly makes it bitter.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[126](cc45021.htm#fr_125.md) <span
id="vi.iv.iv-p26.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p27"></span> *Scott* considers that this wisdom was
called “earthly,” because it sought earthly distinctions, and was of
earthly origin, — “sensual,” or rather “natural,” as the word is
rendered in <span id="vi.iv.iv-p27.1"></span>[1Co
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#014.md)<span id="vi.iv.iv-p27.1"></span>,
because it was the result of such principles as *natural* men are
actuated by, such as envy and ambition, — “and devilish,” because it
came first from the devil, and constituted the image of his pride,
ambition, malignity, and falsehood.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p28"></span>The word “sensual” has led some to
suppose that the reference is to sensuality, the gratification of carnal
lusts: but there is nothing in the passage that favors this view. The
only things mentioned are envy and a contentious spirit, things which
belong to natural man.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[127](cc45021.htm#fr_126.md) <span
id="vi.iv.iv-p34.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p35"></span> “Pure,” <span
id="vi.iv.iv-p35.1"></span>ἁγνή, is to be understood according to what
the context contains. It means what is free from taint or pollution: the
*kind* of taint must be learnt from the passage. The wisdom from above
is contrasted with the wisdom from below: the latter has envy and
contention; the former is “pure,” being free from envy, and is
“peaceable.”

<span id="fn_127"></span>[128](cc45021.htm#fr_127.md) <span
id="vi.iv.iv-p37.2"></span>

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p38"></span> The word <span
id="vi.iv.iv-p38.1"></span>ἀδιύκριτος is found only here, and has been
variously rendered, because the verb from which it comes has various
meanings, — to discern, to make a difference, to judge, to examine, to
contend or litigate, and to doubt. It is rendered by the *Vulg.*, as
“not judging” — uncensorious; by *Beza*, “without contending” —
incontroversial; by *Erasmus*, “making no difference” — impartial; and
by *Hammond*, “not doubting,” *i.e.*, as to the faith. “Uncensorious,”
or, “impartial;” seems the most suitable rendering; not given to
rashness in judging of others, or not shewing respect of persons,
previously condemned in <span id="vi.iv.iv-p38.2"></span>[Jas
2:1](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.iv.iv-p38.2"></span>.
Then follows “undissembling,” not saying one thing and meaning another.

<span id="vi.iv.iv-p39"></span>There seems to be a complete contrast
between the two kinds of wisdom. The wisdom from above is not envious,
but pure; is not contentious, but peaceable; does not create confusion,
but is patient and conciliatory; and instead of producing “every evil
work,” it is full of mercy or benevolence, and of the fruits of
benevolence, being not censorious or partial in judgment, and not
dissembling, or acting dishonestly. By this comparison, we see what were
some of the things included in “every evil work;” they were the reverse
of mercy or benevolence, and its fruits, even censoriousness or
partiality, and dissimilation. And yet those who exhibited all those
evil things thought that they had wisdom! and even gloried in it!
