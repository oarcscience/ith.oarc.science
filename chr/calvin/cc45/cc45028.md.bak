<span id="vii.iv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="vii.iv.i"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv.i-p1.1"></span>[2 Peter
3:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.iv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p2"></span>**1.** This second epistle, beloved, I now
write unto you; in *both* which I stir up your pure minds by way of
remembrance:

<span id="vii.iv.i-p3"></span>**1.** Hane jam, dilecti, secundam vobis
scribo epistolam, in quibus excito per commonefactionem vestram puram
mentem;

<span id="vii.iv.i-p4"></span>**2.** That ye may be mindful of the words
which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of
us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:

<span id="vii.iv.i-p5"></span>**2.** Ut memores sitis verborum quae
predicta sunt a sanctis prophetis, et praecepti nostri, qui sumus
apostoli Domini et Servatoris;

<span id="vii.iv.i-p6"></span>**3.** Knowing this first, that there
shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,

<span id="vii.iv.i-p7"></span>**3.** Hoc primum scientes, quòd venient
in extremo dierum illusores, secundum suas ipsorum concupiscentias
ambulantes,

<span id="vii.iv.i-p8"></span>**4.** And saying, Where is the promise of
his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as
*they were* from the beginning of the creation.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p9"></span>**4.** Ac dicentes, Ubi est promissio
adventus ejus? Ex quo enim patres dormierunt, omnia sic permanent ab
initio creationis.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p10"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv.i-p11"></span><span id="vii.iv.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p12"></span>**1.** Lest they should be wearied with
the Second Epistle as though the first was sufficient, he says that it
was not written in vain, because they stood in need of being often
stirred up. To make this more evident, he shews that they could not be
beyond danger, except they were well fortified, because they would have
to contend with desperate men, who would not only corrupt the purity of
the faith, by false opinions, but do what they could to subvert entirely
the whole faith.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p13"></span>By saying, *I stir up your pure mind,* he
means the same as though he had said, “I wish to awaken you to a
sincerity of mind.” And the words ought to be thus explained, “I stir up
your mind that it may be pure and bright.” For the meaning is, that the
minds of the godly become dim, and as it were contract rust, when
admonitions cease. But we also hence learn, that men even endued with
learning, become, in a manner, drowsy, except they are stirred up by
constant warnings.  <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md)

<span id="vii.iv.i-p15"></span>It now appears what is the use of
admonitions, and how necessary they are; for the sloth of the flesh
smothers the truth once received, and renders it inefficient, except the
goads of warnings come to its aid. It is not then enough, that men
should be taught to know what they ought to be, but there is need of
godly teachers, to do this second part, deeply to impress the truth on
the memory of their hearers. And as men are, by nature, for the most
part, fond of novelty and thus inclined to be fastidious, it is useful
for us to bear in mind what Peter says, so that we may not only
willingly suffer ourselves to be admonished by others, but that every
one may also exercise himself in calling to mind continually the truth,
so that our minds may become resplendent with the pure and clear
knowledge of it.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p16"></span><span id="vii.iv.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p17"></span>**2.** *That ye may be mindful.* By these
words he intimates that we have enough in the writings of the prophets,
and in the gospel, to stir us up, provided we be as diligent as it
behoves us, in meditating on them; and that our minds sometimes contract
a rust, or become bedimmed through darkness, is owing to our sloth. That
God may then continually shine upon us, we must devote ourselves to that
study: let our faith at the same time acquiesce in witnesses so certain
and credible. For when we have the prophets and apostles agreeing with
us, nay, as the ministers of our faith, and God as the author, and
angels as approvers, there is no reason that the ungodly, all united,
should move us from our position. By the *commandment of the apostles*
he means the whole doctrine in which they had instructed the faithful.
 <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md)

<span id="vii.iv.i-p20"></span><span id="vii.iv.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p21"></span>**3.** *Knowing this first.* The
participle *knowing* may be applied to the Apostle, and in this way, “I
labor to stir you up for this reason, because I know what and how great
is your impending danger from scoffers.” I however prefer this
explanation, that the participle is used in place of a verb, as though
he had said, “Know ye this especially.” For it was necessary that this
should have been foretold, because they might have been shaken, had
impious men attacked them suddenly with scoffs of this kind. He
therefore wished them to know this, and to feel assured on the subject,
that they might be prepared to oppose such men.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p22"></span>But he calls the attention of the
faithful again to the doctrine which he touched upon in the second
chapter. For by *the last days* is commonly meant the kingdom of Christ,
or the days of his kingdom, according to what Paul says, “Upon whom the
ends of the world are come.” (<span id="vii.iv.i-p22.1"></span>[1Co
10:11](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#011.md)<span
id="vii.iv.i-p22.1"></span>.)  <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md)
The meaning is, that the more God offers himself by the gospel to the
world, and the more he invites men to his kingdom, the more audacious on
the other hand will ungodly men vomit forth the poison of their impiety.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p24"></span>He calls those *scoffers,* according to
what is usual in Scripture, who seek to appear witty by shewing contempt
to God, and by a blasphemous presumption. It is, moreover, the very
extremity of evil, when men allow themselves to treat the awful name of
God with scoffs. Thus, <span id="vii.iv.i-p24.1"></span>[Ps
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.iv.i-p24.1"></span>
speaks of the seat of scoffers. So David, in <span
id="vii.iv.i-p24.2"></span>[Ps
119:51](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#051.md)<span
id="vii.iv.i-p24.2"></span>, complains that he was derided by the proud,
because he attended to God’s law. So Isaiah, in <span
id="vii.iv.i-p24.3"></span>[Isa
28:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#014.md)<span
id="vii.iv.i-p24.3"></span>, having referred to them, describes their
supine security and insensibility. Let us therefore bear in mind, that
there is nothing to be feared more than a contest with scoffers. On this
subject we said something while explaining the third chapter of the
Epistle to the Galatians. As, however, the Holy Scripture has foretold
that they would come, and has also given us a shield by which we may
defend ourselves, there is no excuse why we should not boldly resist
them whatever devices they may employ.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p25"></span><span id="vii.iv.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p26"></span>**4.** *Where is the promise.* It was a
dangerous scoff when they insinuated a doubt as to the last
resurrection; for when that is taken away, there is no gospel any
longer, the power of Christ is brought to nothing, the whole of religion
is gone. Then Satan aims directly at the throat of the Church, when he
destroys faith in the coming of Christ. For why did Christ die and rise
again, except that he may some time gather to himself the redeemed from
death, and give them eternal life? All religion is wholly subverted,
except faith in the resurrection remains firm and immovable. Hence, on
this point Satan assails us most fiercely.

<span id="vii.iv.i-p27"></span>But let us notice what the scoff was.
They set the regular course of nature, such as it seems to have been
from the beginning, in opposition to the promise of God, as though these
things were contrary, or did not harmonize together. Though the faith of
the fathers, they said, was the same, yet no change has taken place
since their death, and it is known that many ages have passed away.
Hence they concluded that what was said of the destruction of the world
was a fable; because they conjectured, that as it had lasted so long, it
would be perpetual.

<span id="vii.iv.ii"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>[2 Peter
3:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#005.md)<span id="vii.iv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p2"></span>**5.** For this they willingly are
ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the
earth standing out of the water and in the water:

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p3"></span>**5.** Nam hoe nesciunt volentes. quòd
caeli jam olim fuerint, et terra ex aqua, et per aquam consistens, Dei
sermone;

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p4"></span>**6.** Whereby the world that then was,
being overflowed with water, perished:

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p5"></span>**6.** Per quae mundus qui tunc erat,
aqua inundatus periit:

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p6"></span>**7.** But the heavens and the earth,
which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire
against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p7"></span>**7.** Qui autem nunc sunt coeli et
terra, ejusdem sermone repositi sunt, et servantur igni in diem judicii
et perditionis impiorum.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p8"></span>**8.** But, beloved, be not ignorant of
this one thing, that one day *is* with the Lord as a thousand years, and
a thousand years as one day.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p9"></span>**8.** Porri, ne hoc unum nos lateat,
dilecti, quòd unus dies apud Dominum perinde est ut mille anni, et mille
anni ut dies unus.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p10"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p11"></span><span id="vii.iv.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p12"></span>**5.** *For this they willingly are
ignorant of.* By one argument only he confutes the scoff of the ungodly,
even by this, that the world once perished by a deluge of waters, when
yet it consisted of waters. (<span id="vii.iv.ii-p12.1"></span>[Ge
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#002.md)<span
id="vii.iv.ii-p12.1"></span>.) And as the history of this was well
known, he says that they *willingly,* or of their own accord, erred. For
they who infer the perpetuity of the world from its present state,
designedly close their eyes, so as not to see so clear a judgment of
God. The world no doubt had its origin from waters, for Moses calls the
chaos from which the earth emerged, waters; and further, it was
sustained by waters; it yet pleased the Lord to use waters for the
purpose of destroying it. It hence appears that the power of nature is
not sufficient to sustain and preserve the world, but that on the
contrary it contains the very element of its own ruin, whenever it may
please God to destroy it.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p13"></span>For it ought always to be borne in mind,
that the world stands through no other power than that of God's word,
and that therefore inferior or secondary causes derive from him their
power, and produce different effects as they are directed. Thus through
water the world stood, but water could have done nothing of itself, but
on the contrary obeyed God's word as an inferior agent or element. As
soon then as it pleased God to destroy the earth, the same water obeyed
in becoming a ruinous inundation. We now see how egregiously they err,
who stop at naked elements, as though there was perpetuity in them, and
their nature were not changeable according to the bidding of God.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p14"></span>By these few words the petulance of
those is abundantly refuted, who arm themselves with physical reasons to
fight against God. For the history of the deluge is an abundantly
sufficient witness that the whole order of nature is governed by the
sole power of God. (<span id="vii.iv.ii-p14.1"></span>[Ge
7:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#017.md)<span
id="vii.iv.ii-p14.1"></span>.)

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p15"></span><span id="vii.iv.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p16"></span>It seems, however, strange that he says
that the world perished through the deluge, when he had before mentioned
the heaven and the earth. To this I answer, that the heaven was then
also submerged, that is, the region of the air, which stood open between
the two waters. For the division or separation, mentioned by Moses, was
then confounded. (<span id="vii.iv.ii-p16.1"></span>[Ge
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#006.md)<span
id="vii.iv.ii-p16.1"></span>;) and the word *heaven* is often taken in
this sense. if any wishes for more on this subject, let him read
Augustine on the City of God. *Lib*. 20.  <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md)

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p22"></span><span id="vii.iv.ii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p23"></span>**7.** *But the heavens and the earth
which are now.* He does not infer this as the consequence; for his
purpose was no other than to dissipate the craftiness of scoffers
respecting the perpetual state of nature, and we see many such at this
day who being slightly embued with the rudiments of philosophy, only
hunt after profane speculations, in order that they may pass themselves
off as great philosophers.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p24"></span>But it now appears quite evident from
what has been said, that there is nothing unreasonable in the
declaration made by the Lord, that the heaven and the earth shall
hereafter be consumed by fire, because the reason for the fire is the
same as that for the water. For it was a common saying even among the
ancients, that from these two chief elements all things have proceeded.
But as he had to do with the ungodly, he speaks expressly of their
destruction.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p25"></span><span id="vii.iv.ii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p26"></span>**8.** *But be not ignorant of this one
thing.* He now turns to speak to the godly; and he reminds them that
when the coming of Christ is the subject, they were to raise upwards
their eyes, for by so doing, they would not limit, by their unreasonable
wishes, the time appointed by the Lord. For waiting seems very long on
this account, because we have our eyes fixed on the shortness of the
present life, and we also increase weariness by computing days, hours,
and minutes. But when the eternity of God's kingdom comes to our minds,
many ages vanish away like so many moments.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p27"></span>This then is what the Apostle calls our
attention to, so that we may know that the day of resurrection does not
depend on the present flow of time, but on the hidden purpose of God, as
though he had said, “Men wish to anticipate God for this reason, because
they measure time according to the judgment of their own flesh; and they
are by nature inclined to impatience, so that celerity is even delay to
them: do ye then ascend in your minds to heaven, and thus time will be
to you neither long nor short.”

<span id="vii.iv.iii"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>[2
Peter 1:9-13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#009.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p2"></span>**9.** The Lord is not slack concerning
his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to
us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
repentance.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p3"></span>**9.** Non tardat Dominus in
promissione, sicuti quidam tarditatem slackness; existimant; sed
tolerantem se praebet erga nos, nolens ullos perire, sed omnes ad
poenitentiam recipere (*aut, colligi, vel, aggregari.*)

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p4"></span>**10.** But the day of the Lord will
come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away
with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the
earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p5"></span>**10.** Veniet autem dies Domini tanquam
fur in nocte, in qua coeli in modum procellae transibunt, elementa autem
ardore solventur; et terra, quaeque in ea sunt opera ardebunt.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p6"></span>**11.** *Seeing* then *that* all these
things shall be dissolved, what manner *of persons* ought ye to be in
*all* holy conversation and godliness,

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p7"></span>**11.** Quum Haec igitur omnia
solvantur, quales oportet nos esse in sanctis conversationibus et
pietatibus;

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p8"></span>**12.** Looking for and hasting unto the
coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be
dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p9"></span>**12.** Expectantes properando adventum
diei Dei, propter quem coeli solventur, et elementa ardore consumentur?

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p10"></span>**13.** Nevertheless we, according to
his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
righteousness.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p11"></span>**13.** Novos autem coelos et terram
novam juxta promissum ejus expectamus, ín quibus habitat justitia.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p12"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p13"></span><span id="vii.iv.iii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p14"></span>**9.** *But the Lord is not slack,* or,
*delays not*. He checks extreme and unreasonable haste by another
reason, that is, that the Lord defers his coming that he might invite
all mankind to repentance. For our minds are always prurient, and a
doubt often creeps in, why he does not come sooner. But when we hear
that the Lord, in delaying, shews a concern for our salvation, and that
he defers the time because he has a care for us, there is no reason why
we should any longer complain of tardiness. He is tardy who allows an
occasion to pass by through slothfulness: there is nothing like this in
God, who in the best manner regulates time to promote our salvation. And
as to the duration of the whole world, we must think exactly the same as
of the life of every individual; for God by prolonging time to each,
sustains him that he may repent. In the like manner he does not hasten
the end of the world, in order to give to all time to repent.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p15"></span>This is a very necessary admonition, so
that we may learn to employ time aright, as we shall otherwise suffer a
just punishment for our idleness.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p16"></span>*Not willing that any should perish.*
So wonderful is his love towards mankind, that he would have them all to
be saved, and is of his own self prepared to bestow salvation on the
lost. But the order is to be noticed, that God is ready to receive all
to repentance, so that none may perish; for in these words the way and
manner of obtaining salvation is pointed out. Every one of us,
therefore, who is desirous of salvation, must learn to enter in by this
way.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p17"></span>But it may be asked, If God wishes none
to perish, why is it that so many do perish? To this my answer is, that
no mention is here made of the hidden purpose of God, according to which
the reprobate are doomed to their own ruin, but only of his will as made
known to us in the gospel. For God there stretches forth his hand
without a difference to all, but lays hold only of those, to lead them
to himself, whom he has chosen before the foundation of the world.
 <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md)

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p19"></span>But as the verb <span
id="vii.iv.iii-p19.1"></span>χωρὢσαι is often taken passively by the
Greeks, no less suitable to this passage is the verb which I have put in
the margin, that God would have all, who had been before wandering and
scattered, to be gathered or come together to repentance.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p20"></span><span id="vii.iv.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p21"></span>**10.** *But the day of the Lord will
come.* This has been added, that the faithful might be always watching,
and not promise to-morrow to themselves. For we all labor under two very
different evils — too much haste, and slothfulness. We are seized with
impatience for the day of Christ already expected; at the same time we
securely regard it as afar off. As, then, the Apostle has before
reproved an unreasonable ardor, so he now shakes off our sleepiness, so
that we may attentively expect Christ at all times, lest we should
become idle and negligent, as it is usually the case. For whence is it
that flesh indulges itself except that there is no thought of the near
coming of Christ?

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p22"></span>What afterwards follows, respecting the
burning of heaven and earth, requires no long explanation, if indeed we
duly consider what is intended. For it was not his purpose to speak
refinedly of fire and storm, and other things, but only that he might
introduce an exhortation, which he immediately adds, even that we ought
to strive after newness of life. For he thus reasons, that as heaven and
earth are to be purged by fire, that they may correspond with the
kingdom of Christ, hence the renovation of men is much more necessary.
Mischievous, then, are those interpreters who consume much labor on
refined speculations, since the Apostle applies his doctrine to godly
exhortations.

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p23"></span><span id="vii.iv.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p24"></span>Heaven and earth, he says, shall pass
away for our sakes; is it meet, then, for us to be engrossed with the
things of earth, and not, on the contrary, to attend to a holy and godly
life? The corruptions of heaven and earth will be purged by fire, while
yet as the creatures of God they are pure; what then ought to be done by
us who are full of so many pollutions? As to the word *godlinesses*
(<span id="vii.iv.iii-p24.1"></span>*pietatibus*,) the plural number is
used for the singular, except you take it as meaning the duties of
godliness.  <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md) Of the elements of
the world I shall only say this one thing, that they are to be consumed,
only that they may be renovated, their substance still remaining the
same, as it may be easily gathered from <span
id="vii.iv.iii-p25.1"></span>[Ro
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#021.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iii-p25.1"></span>, and from other passages.  <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md)

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p27"></span><span id="vii.iv.iii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p28"></span>**12** *Looking for and hasting unto,*
or, *waiting for by hastening*; so I render the words, though they are
two participles; for what we had before separately he gathers now into
one sentence, that is, that we ought hastily to wait. Now this
contrarious hope possesses no small elegance, like the proverb, “Hasten
slowly,” (<span id="vii.iv.iii-p28.1"></span>*festina lente*.) When he
says, “Waiting for,” he refers to the endurance of hope; and he sets
hastening in opposition to topor; and both are very apposite. For as
quietness and waiting are the peculiarities of hope, so we must always
take heed lest the security of the flesh should creep in; we ought,
therefore, strenuously to labor in good works, and run quickly in the
race of our calling.  <span id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) What he
before called the day of Christ (as it is everywhere called in
Scripture) he now calls the day of God, and that rightly, for Christ
will then restore the kingdom to the Father, that God may be all in all.

3:14-18](../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#014.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p2"></span>**14.** Wherefore, beloved, seeing that
ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in
peace, without spot, and blameless.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p3"></span>**14.** Quare, dilecti, quum Haec
expectetis, studete incontaminati et irreprehensibiles ab eo inyeniri in
pace:

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p4"></span>**15.** And account *that* the
longsuffering of our Lord *is* salvation; even as our beloved brother
Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p5"></span>**15.** Et Domini nostri tolerantiam
salutem existimate, quemadmodum et dilectus frater noster Paulus,
secundum datam sibi sapientiam scripsit vobis;

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p6"></span>**16.** As also in all *his* epistles,
speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be
understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as *they
do* also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p7"></span>**16.** Sicuti in omnibus Epistolis,
loquens de iis in quibus sunt quaedam difficilia intellectu, quae
indocti et instabiles invertunt (ut et caeteras Scripturas) ad suam
perniciem.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p8"></span>**17.** Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye
know *these things* before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the
error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p9"></span>**17.** Vos igitur, dilecti, praemoniti
cavete, ut ne simul nefariorum errore abacti, excidatis à vestra
firmitate.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p10"></span>**18.** But grow in grace, and *in* the
knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him *be* glory both
now and for ever. Amen.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p11"></span>**18.** Crescite autem in gratia et
notitia Domini nostri et Servatoris Jesu Christi; ipsi gloria et nunc et
in diem seternitatis

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p12"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p13"></span><span id="vii.iv.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p14"></span>**14.** *Wherefore.* He justly reasons
from hope to its effect, or the practice of a godly life; for hope is
living and efficacious; therefore it cannot be but that it will attract
us to itself. He, then, who waits for new heavens, must begin with
renewal as to himself, and diligently aspire after it; but they who
cleave to their own filth, think nothing, it is certain, of God's
kingdom, and have no taste for anything but for this corrupt world.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p15"></span>But we must notice that he says, that we
ought to be found blameless by Christ; for by these words he intimates,
that while the world engages and engrosses the minds of others, we must
cast our eyes on the Lord, and he shews at the same time what is real
integrity, even that which is approved by his judgment, and not that
which gains the Praise of men.  <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md)

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p17"></span>The word *peace* seems to be taken for a
quiet state of conscience, founded on hope and patient waiting.  <span
id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) For as so few turn their attention to
the judgment of Christ, hence it is, that while they are carried
headlong by their importunate lusts, they are at the same time in a
state of disquietude. This peace, then, is the quietness of a peaceable
soul, which acquiesces in the word of God.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p19"></span>It may be asked, how any one can be
found blameless by Christ, when we all labor under so many deficiencies.
But Peter here only points out the mark at which the faithful ought all
to aim, though they cannot reach it, until having put off their flesh
they become wholly united to Christ.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p20"></span><span id="vii.iv.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p21"></span>**15.** *The long-suffering of our
Lord.* He takes it as granted that Christ defers the day of his coming,
because he has a regard for our salvation. He hence animates the
faithful, because in a longer delay they have an evidence as to their
own salvation. Thus, what usually disheartens others through weariness,
he wisely turns to a contrary purpose.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p22"></span>*Even as our beloved brother Paul.* We
may easily gather from the Epistle to the Galatians, as well as from
other places, that unprincipled men, who went about everywhere to
disturb the churches, in order to discredit Paul, made use of this
pretense, that he did not well agree with the other Apostles. It is then
probable that Peter referred to Paul in order to shew their consent; for
it was very necessary to take away the occasion for such a calumny. And
yet, when I examine all things more narrowly, it seems to me more
probable that this Epistle was composed by another according to what
Peter communicated, than that it was written by himself, for Peter
himself would have never spoken thus. But it is enough for me that we
have a witness of his doctrine and of his goodwill, who brought forward
nothing contrary to what he would have himself said.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p23"></span><span id="vii.iv.iv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p24"></span>**16.** *In which are some things.* The
relative *which* does not refer to *epistles,* for it is in the neuter
gender.  <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) The meaning is, that in
the things which he wrote there was sometimes an obscurity, which gave
occasion to the unlearned to go astray to their own ruin. We are
reminded by these words, to reason soberly on things so high and
obscure; and further, we are here strengthened against this kind of
offense, lest the foolish or absurd speculations of men should disturb
us, by which they entangle and distort simple truth, which ought to
serve for edification.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p30"></span>But we must observe, that we are not
forbidden to read Paul's Epistles, because they contain some things hard
and difficult to be understood, but that, on the contrary, they are
commended to us, provided we bring a calm and teachable mind. For Peter
condemns men who are trifling and volatile, who strangely turn to their
own ruin what is useful to all. Nay, he says that this is commonly done
as to all the Scripture: and yet he does not hence conclude, that we are
not to read it, but only shews, that those vices ought to be corrected
which prevent improvement, and not only so, but render deadly to us what
God has appointed for our salvation.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p31"></span>It may, however, be asked, Whence is
this obscurity, for the Scripture shines to us like a lamp, and guides
our steps? To this I reply, that it is nothing to be wondered at, if
Peter ascribed obscurity to the mysteries of Christ's kingdom, and
especially if we consider how hidden they are to the perception of the
flesh. However the mode of teaching which God has adopted, has been so
regulated, that all who refuse not to follow the Holy Spirit as their
guide, find in the Scripture a clear light. At the same time, many are
blind who stumble at mid-day; others are proud, who, wandering through
devious paths, and flying over the roughest places, rush headlong into
ruin.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p32"></span><span id="vii.iv.iv-p32.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p33"></span>**17.** *Ye, therefore, beloved.* After
having shewn to the faithful the dangers of which they were to beware,
he now concludes by admonishing them to be wise. But he shews that there
was need of being watchful, lest they should be overwhelmed. And,
doubtless, the craft of our enemy, the many and various treacheries
which he employs against us, the cavils of ungodly men, leave no place
for security. Hence, vigilance must be exercised, lest the devices of
Satan and of the wicked should succeed in circumventing us. It, however
seems that we stand on slippery ground, and the certainty of our
salvation is suspended, as it were, on a thread, since he declares to
the faithful, that they ought to take heed lest they should fall from
their own steadfastness.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p34"></span>What, then, will become of us, if we are
exposed to the danger of falling? To this I answer, that this
exhortation, and those like it, are by no means intended to shake the
firmness of that faith which recumbs on God, but to correct the sloth of
our flesh. If any one wishes to see more on this subject, let him read
what has been said on the tenth chapter of the First Epistle to the
Corinthians.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p35"></span>The meaning is this, that as long as we
are in the flesh, our tardiness must be roused, and that this is fitly
done by having our weakness, and the variety of dangers which surround
us, placed before our eyes; but that the confidence which rests on God's
promises ought not to be thereby shaken.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p36"></span><span id="vii.iv.iv-p36.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p37"></span>**18.** *But grow in grace.* He also
exhorts us to make progress; for it is the only way of persevering, to
make continual advances, and not to stand still in the middle of our
journey; as though he had said, that they only would be safe who labored
to make progress daily.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p38"></span>The word *grace,* I take in a general
sense, as meaning those spiritual gifts we obtain through Christ. But as
we become partakers of these blessings according to the measure of our
faith, *knowledge* is added to grace; as though he had said, that as
faith increases, so would follow the increase of grace.  <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md)

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p40"></span>*To him be glory.* This is a remarkable
passage to prove the divinity of Christ; for what is said cannot belong
to any but to God alone. The adverb of the present time, now, is
designed for this end, that we may not rob Christ of his glory, during
our warfare in the world. He then adds, *for ever,* that we may now form
some idea of his eternal kingdom, which will make known to us his full
and perfect glory.

id="vii.iv.i-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p14"></span> The Apostle evidently admits that they
had a sincere or a pure mind, that is, freed from the pollutions
referred to in the last chapter; but still they stood in need of being
stirred up by admonitions: hence their minds were not, in a strict
sense, perfect, though sincere. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_175"></span>[176](cc45028.htm#fr_175.md) <span
id="vii.iv.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p18"></span> The construction of the passage is as
follows: — “In *both* which I, by admonition, arouse your sincere mind
to remember the words, aforetime spoken by the holy prophets, and the
doctrine of us, the apostles of our Lord and Savior.”

<span id="vii.iv.i-p19"></span>The verb <span
id="vii.iv.i-p19.1"></span>μνησθὢναι is connected with “arouse;” and it
is in this tense used actively as well as passively. See <span
id="vii.iv.i-p19.2"></span>[Mt
26:75](../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#075.md)<span
id="vii.iv.i-p19.2"></span>, and <span id="vii.iv.i-p19.3"></span>[Ac
10:31](../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#031.md)<span
id="vii.iv.i-p19.3"></span>. There is in the noun <span
id="vii.iv.i-p19.4"></span>ἐντολὴ, a metonymy, the commandment for what
was commanded to be taught, the doctrine. It has this meaning, according
to *Schleusner*, in <span id="vii.iv.i-p19.5"></span>[Joh
12:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#050.md)<span
id="vii.iv.i-p19.5"></span>, and in this Epistle, <span
id="vii.iv.i-p19.6"></span>[2Pe
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#021.md)<span id="vii.iv.i-p19.6"></span>.
— *Ed*

<span id="fn_176"></span>[177](cc45028.htm#fr_176.md) <span
id="vii.iv.i-p22.2"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.i-p23"></span> It is literally, “the last of the days,”
according to the Hebrew form <span id="vii.iv.i-p23.1"></span>אחרית
הימים, “the extremity of the days,” (<span
id="vii.iv.i-p23.2"></span>[Isa
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002)<span id="vii.iv.i-p23.2"></span>;.md)
but the meaning is the same as “the last days,” as used in <span
id="vii.iv.i-p23.3"></span>[Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.iv.i-p23.3"></span>,
and in other places, that is, the days of the gospel dispensation. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_177"></span>[178](cc45028.htm#fr_177.md) <span
id="vii.iv.ii-p16.2"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p17"></span> The two verses, the fifth and the
sixth, have been differently explained. “The earth,” say some,
“subsisting from water and through water,” that is, emerging from water
and made firm and solid by means of water; which is true, for through
moisture the earth adheres together and becomes a solid mass. Others
render the last clause, “in water,” or in the midst of water, that is,
surrounded by water; and this is the most suitable meaning.

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p18"></span>The <span id="vii.iv.ii-p18.1"></span>δι
᾿ ὧν at the beginning of the sixth verse, refers, according to *Beza,
Whitby,* and others, to the heavens and the earth in the preceding
verse, the deluge being occasioned by “the windows of heaven being
opened,” and “the fountains of the great deep being broken up.” (<span
id="vii.iv.ii-p18.2"></span>[Ge
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011.md)<span
id="vii.iv.ii-p18.2"></span>.) “By which (or by the means of which) the
world at that time, being overflowed with water, was destroyed.”

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p19"></span>The objection to this view is, as justly
stated by *Macknight*, that the correspondence between this verse and
the following is thereby lost: the reservation of the world to be
destroyed by fire is expressly ascribed, in verse seventh, to God’s
word; and to the same ought the destruction of the old world to be
ascribed. This is doubtless the meaning required by the passage, but
“which” being in the plural, creates a difficulty, and there is no
different reading. *Macknight* solves the difficulty by saying that the
plural “which” or whom, refers to “word,” meaning Christ, and “God,” as
in the first verse of this chapter, “in both which,” a reference is made
to what is implied in “the second Epistle,” that is, the first. He
supposes that there is here the same anomalous mode of speaking. But the
conjecture which has been made is not improbable, that it is a
typographical mistake, <span id="vii.iv.ii-p19.1"></span>ὧν being put
for <span id="vii.iv.ii-p19.2"></span>οὗ or for <span
id="vii.iv.ii-p19.3"></span>ὃν. Then the meaning would be evident; and
the two parts would correspond the one with the other:

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p20"></span>5. “For of this they are wilfully
ignorant, that the heavens existed of old and the earth (which subsisted
from water and in water,) by  
6. the word of God; by which the world at that time, being over-  
7. flowed with water, was destroyed. But the present heavens and the
earth are by His word reserved, being kept for fire to the day of
judgment and of the perdition of ungodly men.”

<span id="vii.iv.ii-p21"></span>By “word” here is meant command, or
power, or the *fiat* by which the world was created; and by the same it
was destroyed, and by the same it will be finally destroyed. Instead of
<span id="vii.iv.ii-p21.1"></span>αὐτῶ “the same” *Griesbach* has
introduced into his text <span id="vii.iv.ii-p21.2"></span>αὐτοῦ, “His.”
— *Ed*

<span id="fn_178"></span>[179](cc45028.htm#fr_178.md) <span
id="vii.iv.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p18"></span> A similar view was taken by *Estius,
Piscator*, and *Beza.* — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[180](cc45028.htm#fr_179.md) <span
id="vii.iv.iii-p24.2"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p25"></span> The previous word is also in the
plural number, “in holy conversations.” What seems to be meant is, that
every part of the conduct should be holy, and that every part of
godliness should be attended to: “In every part of a holy life, and
every act of godliness;” that is, we are not to be holy in part or pious
in part, but attend to every branch of duty towards man, and every
branch of duty towards God. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[181](cc45028.htm#fr_180.md) <span
id="vii.iv.iii-p25.2"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p26"></span> All that is said here is, that there
will be new heavens and a new earth, and not that the present heavens
and the present earth will be renovated. See <span
id="vii.iv.iii-p26.1"></span>[Rev.
20:11](../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011.md), [Rev.
21:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#001.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iii-p26.1"></span>. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[182](cc45028.htm#fr_181.md) <span
id="vii.iv.iii-p28.2"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iii-p29"></span> The first meaning of <span
id="vii.iv.iii-p29.1"></span>σπεύδω is to hasten, and it is often used,
when connected with another verb, adverbially as proposed by Calvin; but
when followed as here by an accusative case, it has often the secondary
meaning of earnestly desiring a thing. It is so taken here by
*Schleusner*, *Parkhurst*, and *Macknight*; “Expecting and earnestly
desiring the coming of the day of God.” — *Ed*

<span id="fn_182"></span>[183](cc45028.htm#fr_182.md) <span
id="vii.iv.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p16"></span> He says, “Expecting these things, be
diligent,” etc.; <span id="vii.iv.iv-p16.1"></span>σπουδάσατε, hasten,
make speed, diligently strive, earnestly labor, carefully endeavor:
“Therefore, beloved, since ye expect these things, diligently strive to
be found by him in peace, unspotted and unblamable;” that is, having no
stain, and not chargeable with crime. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_183"></span>[184](cc45028.htm#fr_183.md) <span
id="vii.iv.iv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p18"></span> Some say, “peace” with God; but the
view of *Calvin* is more suitable here. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_184"></span>[185](cc45028.htm#fr_184.md) <span
id="vii.iv.iv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p25"></span> It is in the feminine gender in some
MSS. The authority as to the copies and versions is nearly equal. The
difference is not much as to the sense, only “in which epistles,” reads
better. So thought *Beza, Mill*, and others.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p26"></span>It has been a question as to the
particular epistle referred to by Peter; for that he alludes to some
particular epistle is evident from the manner in which he writes. The
difficulty has arisen from connecting the reference made to Paul, only
with the former part of the 15th verse, while that part ought to be
viewed only as an addition to the former verse; and the former verse
stands connected with the new heavens and the new earth. So that the
subjects in hand are the day of judgment, the future state, and the
necessity of being prepared for it; and that these are the things
referred to is evident from this, that he says, that Paul speaks of them
in all his epistles, which is not true, as to what is said at the
beginning of the 15th verse. The passage then ought to be thus rendered:
—

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p27"></span>**14.** Therefore, beloved, since ye
expect these things,  
diligently strive to be found by him in peace,  
unspotted and unblamable;  
**15.** and deem the long-suffering of our Lord *to be for* salvation:  
even as Paul, our beloved brother, has, according to the wisdom given  
**16.** to him, written to you; as also in all his epistles,  
when speaking in them of these things;  
in which (epistles) there are some things difficult to be understood,”  
*etc.*

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p28"></span>Now the special epistle referred to was
most probably the epistle to the Hebrews, one particular design of which
was to direct the attention of the Jews to the country promised to their
fathers. Some, indeed, hold that that epistle was written to the Jews in
Judea; but others maintain that it was written to converted Hebrews
generally, whether in Judea or elsewhere; and this passage seems to
favor the latter opinion.

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p29"></span>If the view given here is right, that
is, that the subjects on which reference is made to Paul, are those
mentioned in the 12th, the 13th, and 14th verses, then there is no
epistle of Paul which could be more appropriately referred to than that
to the Hebrews, as the new heavens and the new earth answer exactly to
“the better and heavenly country,” mentioned in the Epistle to the
Hebrews. See <span id="vii.iv.iv-p29.1"></span>[Heb
11:16](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016.md)<span
id="vii.iv.iv-p29.1"></span>. Besides, the exhortations and warnings of
that epistle wholly coincide with the exhortation given here by Peter. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_185"></span>[186](cc45028.htm#fr_185.md) <span
id="vii.iv.iv-p38.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv.iv-p39"></span> “Grace” is the attainment, and “the
knowledge” of Christ is the way and means. The chief thing is often
mentioned first in Scripture, then that which leads to it: or the cause
of it. — *Ed*.
