<span id="viii.i-p1"></span>THE ARGUMENT

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>Though there was a dispute among the
ancients respecting this Epistle, yet as the reading of it is useful,
and as it contains nothing inconsistent with the purity of apostolic
doctrine, and was received as authentic formerly, by some of the best, I
willingly add it to the others. Its brevity, moreover, does not require
a long statement of its contents; and almost the whole of it is nearly
the same with the second chapter of the last Epistle.

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span>As unprincipled men, under the name of
Christians, had crept in, whose chief object was to lead the unstable
and weak to a profane contempt of God, Jude first shews, that the
faithful ought not to have been moved by agents of this kind, by which
the Church has always been assailed; and yet he exhorts them carefully
to beware of such pests. And to render them more hateful and detestable,
he denounces on them the approaching vengeance of God, such as their
impiety deserved. Now, if we consider what Satan has attempted in our
age, from the commencement of the revived gospel, and what arts he still
busily employs to subvert the faith, and the fear of God, what was a
useful warning in the time of Jude, is more than necessary in our age.
But this will appear more fully as we proceed in reading the Epistle.
