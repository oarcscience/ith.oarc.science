<span id="vi.iii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="vi.iii.i"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.i-p1"></span><span id="vi.iii.i-p1.1"></span>[James
2:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.iii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.i-p2"></span>**1** My brethren, have not the faith of
our Lord Jesus Christ, *the Lord* of glory, with respect of persons.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p3"></span>**1** Fratres mei, ne in acceptionabus
personarum fidem habeatis Domini Jesu Christi ex opinione, (*vel,
gloriae.*)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p4"></span>**2** For if there come unto your assembly
a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor
man in vile raiment;

<span id="vi.iii.i-p5"></span>**2** Si enim ingressus fuerit in coetum
vestrum vir aureos anulos gestans, veste indudus spliendida; ingressus
autem fuerit et pauper in sordida veste;

<span id="vi.iii.i-p6"></span>**3** And ye have respect to him that
weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good
place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my
footstool:

<span id="vi.iii.i-p7"></span>**3** Et respexeritis in cum qui vestem
fert splendidam, et ei dixeritis, Tu sede hic honeste, et pauperi
dixeritis, Tu sta illic, vel, Sede hic sub scabello pedum meorum;

<span id="vi.iii.i-p8"></span>**4** Are ye not then partial in
yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?

<span id="vi.iii.i-p9"></span>**4** An non dijudicati eestis in
vobisipsis, et facti judices malarum cogitationum?

<span id="vi.iii.i-p10"></span> 

<span id="vi.iii.i-p11"></span><span id="vi.iii.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.i-p12"></span>This reproof seems at first sight to be
hard and unreasonable; for it is one of the duties of courtesy, not to
be neglected, to honor those who are elevated in the world. Further, if
respect of persons be vicious, servants are to be freed from all
subjection; for freedom and servitude are deemed by Paul as conditions
of life. The same must be thought of magistrates. But the solution of
these questions is not difficult, if what James writes is not separated.
For he does not simply disapprove of honor being paid to the rich, but
that this should not be done in a way so as to despise or reproach the
poor; and this will appear more clearly, when he proceeds to speak of
the rule of love.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p13"></span>Let us therefore remember that the
respect of persons here condemned is that by which the rich is so
extolled, wrong is done to the poor, which also he shews clearly by the
context and surely ambitions is that honor, and full of vanity, which is
shewn to the rich to the contempt of the poor. Nor is there a doubt but
that ambition reigns and vanity also, when the masks of this world are
alone in high esteem. We must remember this truth, that he is to be
counted among the heirs of God’s kingdom, who disregards the reprobate
and honors those who fear God. (<span id="vi.iii.i-p13.1"></span>[Ps
15:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa015.htm#004.md)<span
id="vi.iii.i-p13.1"></span>.)

<span id="vi.iii.i-p14"></span>Here then is the contrary vice condemned,
that is, when from respect alone to riches, anyone honors the wicked,
and as it has been said, dishonors the good. If then thou shouldest read
thus, “He sins who respects the rich,” the sentence would be absurd; but
if as follows, “He sins who honors the rich alone and despises the poor,
and treats him with contempt,” it would be a pious and true doctrine.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p15"></span>**1** *Have not the faith*, *etc*., *with
respect of persons*. He means that the respect of persons is
inconsistent with the faith of Christ, so that they cannot be united
together, and rightly so; for we are by faith united into one body, in
which Christ holds the primacy. When therefore the pomps of the world
become preeminent so as to cover over what Christ is, it is evident that
faith hath but little vigor.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p16"></span>In rendering <span
id="vi.iii.i-p16.1"></span>τὢς δόξης, “on account of esteem,” (<span
id="vi.iii.i-p16.2"></span>*ex opinione*,) I have followed Erasmus;
though the old interpreter cannot be blamed, who has rendered it
“glory,” for the word means both; and it may be fitly applied to Christ,
and that according to the drift of the passage. For so great is the
brightness of Christ, that it easily extinguishes all the glories of the
world, if indeed it irradiates our eyes. It hence follows, that Christ
is little esteemed by us, when the admiration of worldly glory lays hold
on us. But the other exposition is also very suitable, for when the
esteem or value of riches or of honors dazzles our eyes, the truth is
suppressed, which ought alone to prevail. To *sit becomingly* means to
sit honorably.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p17"></span><span id="vi.iii.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.i-p18"></span>**4** *Are ye not then partial in
yourselves*? or, *are ye not condemned in yourselves*. This may be read
affirmatively as well as interrogatively, but the sense would be the
same, for he amplifies the fault by this, that they took delight and
indulged themselves in so great a wickedness. If it be read
interrogatively, the meaning is, “Does not your own conscience hold you
convicted, so that you need no other judge?” If the affirmative be
preferred, it is the same as though he had said, “This evil also
happens, that ye think not that ye sin, nor know that your thoughts are
so wicked as they are.”  <span id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md)

<span id="vi.iii.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p1"></span><span id="vi.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>[James
2:5-7](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#005.md)<span id="vi.iii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p2"></span>**5** Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath
not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the
kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p3"></span>**5** Audite, fratres mei dilecti, nonne
Deus elegit pauperes mundi hujus divites in fide et heredes regni quod
promisit iis qui diligunt eum?

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p4"></span>**6** But ye have despised the poor. Do
not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p5"></span>**6** Vos autem contemptui habiustis
pauperem: nonne divites tyrnnidem in vos exercent et iidem trahunt vos
ad tribunalia?

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p6"></span>**7** Do not they blaspheme that worthy
name by the which ye are called?

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p7"></span>**7** Et iidem contumelia afficiunt bonum
nomen quod invocatum est super vos?

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p8"></span> 

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p9"></span><span id="vi.iii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p10"></span>**5** *Hearken, my beloved brethren*. He
proves now by a two-fold argument, that they acted preposterously, when
for the sake of the rich they despised the poor: The first is, that it
is unbecoming and disgraceful to cast down those whom God exalts, and to
treat reproachfully those whom he honors. As God honors the poor, then
every one who repudiates them, reverses the order of God. The other
argument is taken from common experience; for since the rich are for the
most part vexatious to the good and innocent, it is very unreasonable to
render such a reward for the wrongs they do, so that they should be more
approved by us than the poor, who aid us more than they wrong us. We
shall now see how he proceeds with these two points.

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p11"></span>*Hath not God chosen the poor of this
world?* Not indeed alone, but he wished to begin with them, that he
might beat down the pride of the rich. This is also what Paul says, that
God hath chosen, not many noble, not many mighty in the world, but those
who are weak, that he might make ashamed such as are strong (<span
id="vi.iii.ii-p11.1"></span>[1Co
1:25](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.iii.ii-p11.1"></span>.) In short, though God pours forth his
grace on the rich in common with the poor, yet his will is to prefer
these to those, that the mighty might learn not to flatter themselves,
and that the ignoble and the obscure might ascribe in what they are to
the mercy of God, and that both might be trained up to meekness and
humility.

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p12"></span>*The rich in faith* are not those who
abound in the greatness of faith, but such as God has enriched with the
various gifts of his Spirit, which we receive by faith. For, doubtless,
since the Lord deals bountifully with all, every one becomes partaker of
his gifts according to the measure of his own faith. If, then, we are
empty or needy, that proves the deficiency of our faith; for if we only
enlarge the bosom of faith, God is always ready to fill it.

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p13"></span>He says, that *a kingdom is promised to
those who love God*: not that the promise depends on love; but he
reminds us that we are called by God unto the hope of eternal life, on
this condition and to this end, that we may love him. Then the end, and
not the beginning, is here pointed out.

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p14"></span><span id="vi.iii.ii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p15"></span>**6** *Do not the rich*. He seems to
instigate them to vengeance by bringing forward the unjust rule of the
rich, in order that they who were unjustly treated, might render like
for like: and yet we are everywhere bid to do good to those who injure
us. But the object of James was another; for he only wished to shew that
they were without reason or judgment who through ambition honored their
executioners, and in the meantime injured their own friends, at least
those from whom they never suffered any wrong. For hence appeared more
fully their vanity, that they were induced by no acts of kindness: they
only admired the rich, because they were rich; nay, they servilely
flattered those whom they found, to their own loss, to be unjust and
cruel.

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p16"></span>There are, indeed, some of the rich who
are just, and meek, and hate all unrighteousness; but few of such men
are to be found. James, then, mentions what for the most part usually
happens, and what daily experience proves true. For as men commonly
exercise their power in doing what is wrong, it hence happens, that the
more power any one has, the worse he is, and the more unjust towards his
neighbors. The more careful then ought the rich to be, lest they should
contract any of the contagion which everywhere prevails among those of
their own rank.

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p17"></span><span id="vi.iii.ii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.ii-p18"></span>**7** *Worthy,* or *good name*. I doubt
not but that he refers here to the name of God and of Christ. And he
says, *by*, or, *on, the which ye are called*; not in prayer, as
Scripture is wont sometimes to speak, but by profession; as the name of
a father, in <span id="vi.iii.ii-p18.1"></span>[Ge
48:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen048.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.iii.ii-p18.1"></span>, is said to be called on his offspring, and
in <span id="vi.iii.ii-p18.2"></span>[Isa
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa004.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.iii.ii-p18.2"></span>,
the name of a husband is called on the wife. It is, then, the same as
though he had said, “The good name in which ye glory, or which ye deem
it an honor to be called by; but if they proudly calumniate the glory of
God, how unworthy are they of being honored by Christians!”

<span id="vi.iii.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p1"></span><span id="vi.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>[James
2:8-11](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.iii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p2"></span>**8** If ye fulfill the royal law
according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye
do well:

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p3"></span>**8** Si legem quidem regiam perfectis
juxta scripturum, Diliges proximum tuum sicut te ipsum, bene facitis.
(<span id="vi.iii.iii-p3.1"></span>[Lev.
19:18](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018.md), [Matt.
22:39](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#039.md), [Mark
12:31](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#031.md), [Rom.
13:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#009.md), [Gal.
5:14](../../../bib/kjv/gal005.htm#014.md)<span
id="vi.iii.iii-p3.1"></span>.)

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p4"></span>**9** But if ye have respect to persons,
ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p5"></span>**9** Sin personam respicitis, peccatum
committis, et redarguimini a lege veluti transgressores. (<span
id="vi.iii.iii-p5.1"></span>[Lev.
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#015.md), [Deut.
1:17](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#017.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.iii.iii-p5.1"></span>.)

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p6"></span>**10** For whosoever shall keep the
whole law, and yet offend in one *point*, he is guilty of all.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p7"></span>**10** Quisquis enim totam legem
servaverit, offenderit autem in uno, factus est omnium reus.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p8"></span>**11** For he that said, Do not commit
adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if
thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p9"></span>**11** Nam qui dixit, Ne moecheris,
dixit etiam, Ne occidas. Quod si non fueris moechatus, occideris tamen,
factus es transgressor legis.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p10"></span> 

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p11"></span><span id="vi.iii.iii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p12"></span>Now follows a plainer declaration; for
he expressly points out the cause of the last reproof, for they were
officiously attentive to the rich, not from love, but on the contrary,
from a vain desire of attaining their favor: And it is in anticipation,
by which he obviated an excuse on the other side; for they might have
objected and said, that he ought not to be blamed, who humbly submiteth
himself to the unworthy. James, indeed, concedes that this is true, but
he shews that it was falsely pretended by them, because they shewed this
submission of homage, not from love to their neighbors, but from respect
of persons.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p13"></span>In the first clause, then, he
acknowledges as right and praiseworthy, as the duties of love which we
perform towards our neighbors. In the second, he denies that the
ambitious respect of persons ought to be deemed as of this kind, for it
widely differs from what the law prescribes. And the hinge of this
answer turns on the words “neighbor” and “respect of persons,” as though
he had said, “If you pretend that there is a sort of love in what you
do, this may be easily disproved; for God bids us to love our neighbors,
and not to shew respect of persons.” Besides, this word “neighbor”
includes all mankind: he, then, who says, that a very few, according to
his own fancy, ought to be honored, and others passed by, does not keep
the law of God, but yields to the depraved desires of his own heart. God
expressly commends to us strangers and enemies, and all, even the most
contemptible. To this doctrine the respect of persons is wholly
contrary. Hence, rightly does James assert, that respect of persons is
inconsistent with love.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p14"></span>**8** *If ye fulfill the royal law*.
The law here I take simply as the rule of life; and *to fulfill*, or
perform it, is to keep it with real integrity of heart, and as they say,
roundly, (<span id="vi.iii.iii-p14.1"></span>*rotunde*;) and he sets
such a keeping in opposition to a partial observance of it. It is said,
indeed, to be a *royal law*, as it is the royal way, or road; that is,
plain, straight, and level, which, by implication, is set in opposition
to sinuous by-paths and windings.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p15"></span>Allusion however is made, as I think,
to servile obedience which they rendered to the rich, when they might,
by serving in sincerity their neighbors, be not only free men, but live
as kings.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p16"></span><span id="vi.iii.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p17"></span>When, in the second place, he says,
that those who had respect of persons were *convinced*, or *reproved* by
the law, the law is taken according to its proper meaning. For since we
are bidden by God’s command to embrace all mortals, every one who, with
a few exceptions, rejects all the rest, breaks the bond of God, and
inverts also his order, and is, therefore, rightly called a transgressor
of the law.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p18"></span><span id="vi.iii.iii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p19"></span>**10** *For whosoever shall keep the
whole law*. What alone he means is, that God will not be honored with
exceptions, nor will he allow us to cut off from his law what is less
pleasing to us. At the first view, this sentence seems hard to some, as
though the apostle countenanced the paradox of the Stoics, which makes
all sins equal, and as though he asserted that he who offends in one
thing ought to be punished equally with him whose whole life has been
sinful and wicked. But it is evident from the context that no such thing
entered into his mind.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p20"></span>For we must always observe the reason
anything is said. He denies that our neighbors are loved when a part
only of them is through ambition chosen, and the rest neglected. This he
proves, because it is no obedience to God, when it is not rendered
equally according to his command. Then as the rule of God is plain and
complete or perfect, so we ought to regard completeness; so that none of
us should presumptuously separate what he has joined together. Let there
be, therefore, a uniformity, if we desire rightly to obey God. As, for
instance, were a judge to punish ten thefts, and leave one man
unpunished, he would betray the obliquity of his mind, for he would thus
shew himself indignant against men rather than against crimes; because
what he condemns in one he absolves in another.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p21"></span>We now, then, understand the design of
James, that is, that if we cut off from God’s law what is less agreeable
to us, though in other parts we may be obedient, yet we be come guilty
of all, because in one particular thing we violate the whole law. And
though he accommodates what is said to the subject in hand, it is yet
taken from a general principle, — that God has prescribed to us a rule
of life, which it is not lawful for us to mutilate. For it is not said
of a part of the law, “This is the way, walk ye in it;” nor does the law
promise a reward except to universal obedience.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p22"></span>Foolish, then, are the schoolmen, who
deem partial righteousness, as they call it, to be meritorious; for this
passage and many others, clearly shew that there is no righteousness
except in a perfect obedience to the law.

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p23"></span><span id="vi.iii.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p24"></span>**11** *For he that said*, or *he who
hath said*. This is a proof of the former verse; because the Lawgiver is
to be considered rather than each particular precept apart. The
righteousness of God, as an indivisible body, is contained in the law.
Whosoever, then, transgresses one article of the Law, destroys, as far
as he can, the righteousness of God. Besides, as in one part, so in
every part, God’s will is to try our obedience. Hence a transgressor of
the law is every one who offends as to any one of its commandments
according to this saying,

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p25"></span>“Cursed is he who fulfills not all
things.”  
(<span id="vi.iii.iii-p25.2"></span>[De
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.iii.iii-p25.2"></span>.)

<span id="vi.iii.iii-p26"></span>We further see, that the transgressor
of the law, and the guilty of all, mean the same according to James.

<span id="vi.iii.iv"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p1"></span><span id="vi.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>[James
2:12-13](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.iii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p2"></span>**12** So speak ye, and so do, as they
that shall be judged by the law of liberty.

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p3"></span>**12** Sic loquimini, et sic facite, ut
per legem libertatis judicandi.

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p4"></span>**13** For he shall have judgment without
mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p5"></span>**13** Judicium enim sine misericordia ei
qui non praestiterit misericordiam; et gloriatur misericordia adversus
judicium.

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p7"></span><span id="vi.iii.iv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p8"></span>**12** *So speak ye*. Some give this
explanation, that as they flattered themselves too much, they are
summoned to the right tribunal; for men absolve themselves according to
their own notions, because they withdraw themselves from the judgment of
the divine law. He then reminds them that all deeds and words are there
to be accounted for, because God will judge the world according to his
law. As, however, such a declaration might have smitten them with
immoderate terror, to correct or mitigate what they might have thought
severe, he adds, *the law of liberty*. For we know what Paul says,

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p9"></span>“Whosoever are under the law are under a
curse.”  
(<span id="vi.iii.iv-p9.2"></span>[Ga
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#010.md)<span
id="vi.iii.iv-p9.2"></span>.)

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p10"></span>Hence the judgment of the law in itself
is condemnation to eternal death; but he means by the word *liberty*,
that we are freed from the rigor of the law.

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p11"></span>This meaning is not altogether
unsuitable, though if one examines more minutely what immediately
follows, he will see that James meant another thing; the sense is as
though he had said, “Except ye wish to undergo the rigor of the law, ye
must be less rigid towards your neighbors; for the law of liberty is the
same as the mercy of God, which delivers us from the curse of the law”
And so this verse ought to be read with what follows, where he speaks of
the duty of bearing with infirmities. And doubtless the whole passage
thus reads well: “Since none of us can stand before God, except we be
delivered and freed from the strict rigor of the law, we ought so to
act, that we may not through too much severity exclude the indulgence or
mercy of God, of which we all have need to the last.”

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p12"></span><span id="vi.iii.iv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p13"></span>**13** *For he shall have judgment.*
This is an application of the last verse to the subject in hand, which
confirms altogether the second explanation which I have mentioned: for
he shews, that since we stand through God’s mercy alone, we ought to
shew that to those whom the Lord himself commends to us. It is, indeed,
a singular commendation of kindness and benevolence, that God promises
that he will be merciful to us, if we be so to our brethren: not that
our mercy, how ever great it may be, shewn towards men, merits the mercy
of God; but that God would have those whom he has adopted, as he is to
them a kind and an indulgent Father, to bear and exhibit his image on
the earth, according to the saying of Christ,

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p14"></span>“Be ye merciful, as your heavenly Father
is merciful.”  
(<span id="vi.iii.iv-p14.2"></span>[Mt
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.iii.iv-p14.2"></span>.)

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p15"></span>We must notice, on the other hand, that
he could denounce nothing on them more severe or more dreadful than the
judgment of God. It hence follows, that all they are miserable and lost
who flee not to the asylum of pardon.

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p16"></span>*And mercy rejoiceth*. As though he had
said, “God’s mercy alone is that which delivers us from the dread and
terror of judgment.” he takes *rejoicing* or *glorying* in the sense of
being victorious or triumphant; for the judgment of condemnation is
suspended over the whole world, and nothing but mercy can bring relief.

<span id="vi.iii.iv-p17"></span>Hard and forced is the explanation of
those who regard mercy as put here for the person, for men cannot
properly be said to rejoice or glory against the judgment of God; but
mercy itself in a manner triumphs, and alone reigns when the severity of
judgment gives way; though I do not deny but that hence arises
confidence in rejoicing, that is, when the faithful know that the wrath
of God in a manner yields to mercy, so that being relieved by the
latter, they are not overwhelmed by the former.

<span id="vi.iii.v-p2"></span>**14** What *doth it* profit, my brethren,
though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?

<span id="vi.iii.v-p3"></span>**14** Quid prodest, fratres mei, si fidem

<span id="vi.iii.v-p5"></span>**15** Quod si frater aut soror nudi
fuerint, et egentes quotidiano victu,

<span id="vi.iii.v-p6"></span>**16** And one of you say unto them,
Depart in peace, be *ye* warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them
not those things which are needful to the body; what *doth it* profit?

<span id="vi.iii.v-p7"></span>**16** Dicat autem aliquis vestrum illis,
Abite cum pace, calescite et saturamini; non tamen dederitis quae sunt
necessaria corpori, quae utilitas?

<span id="vi.iii.v-p8"></span>**17** Even so faith, if it hath not
works, is dead, being alone.

<span id="vi.iii.v-p9"></span>**17** Sic et fides, si opera non
habuerit, mortua est per se.

<span id="vi.iii.v-p10"></span> 

<span id="vi.iii.v-p11"></span><span id="vi.iii.v-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.v-p12"></span>**14** *What doth it profit*. He proceeds
to commend mercy. And as he had threatened that God would be a severe
Judge to us, and at the same time very dreadful, except we be kind and
merciful towards our neighbors, and as on the other hand hypocrites
objected and said, that faith is sufficient to us, in which the
salvation of men consists, he now condemns this vain boasting. The sum,
then, of what is said is, that faith without love avails nothing, and
that it is therefore wholly dead.

<span id="vi.iii.v-p13"></span>But here a question arises, Can faith be
separated from love? It is indeed true that the exposition of this
passage has produced that common distinction of the Sophists, between
unformed and formed faith; but of such a thing James knew nothing, for
it appears from the first words, that he speaks of false profession of
faith: for he does not begin thus, “If any one has faith;” but, “If any
says that he has faith;” by which he certainly intimates that hypocrites
boast of the empty name of faith, which really does not belong to them.

<span id="vi.iii.v-p14"></span>That he calls it then *faith,* is a
concession, as the Rhetoricians say; for when we discuss a point, it
does no harm, nay, it is sometimes expedient, to concede to an adversary
what he demands, for as soon as the thing itself is known, what is
conceded may be easily taken away from him. James then, as he was
satisfied that it was a false pretext by which hypocrites covered
themselves, was not disposed to raise a dispute about a word or an
expression. Let us, however, remember that he does not speak according
to the impression of his own mind when he mentions faith, but that on
the contrary he disputes against those who made a false pretense as to
faith, of which they were wholly destitute.

<span id="vi.iii.v-p15"></span>*Can faith save him?* This is the same as
though he had said, that we do not attain salvation by a frigid and bare
knowledge of God, which all confess to be most true; for salvation comes
to us by faith for this reason, because it joins us to God. And this
comes not in any other way than by being united to the body of Christ,
so that, living through his Spirit, we are also governed by him. There
is no such thing as this in the dead image of faith. There is then no
wonder that James denies that salvation is connected with it.  <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md)

<span id="vi.iii.v-p17"></span><span id="vi.iii.v-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.v-p18"></span>**15** *If a brother*, or, *For if a
brother*. He takes an example from what was connected with his subject;
for he had been exhorting them to exercise the duties of love. If any
one, on the contrary, boasted that he was satisfied with faith without
works, he compares this shadowy faith to the saying of one who bids a
famished man to be filled without supplying him with the food of which
he is destitute. As, then, he who sends away a poor man with words, and
offers him no help, treats him with mockery, so they who devise for
themselves faith without works, and without any of the duties of
religion, trifle with God.  <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md)

<span id="vi.iii.v-p20"></span><span id="vi.iii.v-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.v-p21"></span>**17** *Is dead, being alone*. He says
that faith is dead, being by itself, that is, when destitute of good
works. We hence conclude that it is indeed no faith, for when dead, it
does not properly retain the name. The Sophists plead this expression
and say, that some sort of faith is found by itself; but this frivolous
caviling is easily refuted; for it is sufficiently evident that the
Apostle reasons from what is impossible, as Paul calls an angel
anathema, if he attempted to subvert the gospel. (<span

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p7"></span><span id="vi.iii.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p8"></span>**18** *Yea, a man may say*. Erasmus
introduces here two persons as speakers; one of whom boasts of faith
without works, and the other of works without faith; and he thinks that
both are at length confuted by the Apostle. But this view seems to me
too forced. He thinks it strange, that this should be said by James,
*Thou hast faith*, who acknowledges no faith without works. But in this
he is much mistaken, that he does not acknowledge an irony in these
words. Then <span id="vi.iii.vi-p8.1"></span>ἀλλὰ I take for “nay
rather;” and <span id="vi.iii.vi-p8.2"></span>τὶς for “any one;” for the
design of James was to expose the foolish boasting of those who imagined
that they had faith when by their life they shewed that they were
unbelievers; for he intimates that it would be easy for all the godly
who led a holy life to strip hypocrites of that boasting with which they
were inflated.  <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md)

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p12"></span>*Shew me*. Though the more received
reading is, “by works,” yet the old Latin is more suitable, and the
reading is also found in some Greek copies. I therefore hesitated not to
adopt it. Then he bids to shew faith without works, and thus reasons
from what is impossible, to prove what does not exist. So he speaks
ironically. But if any one prefers the other reading, it comes to the
same thing, “Shew me by works thy faith;” for since it is not an idle
thing, it must necessarily be proved by works. The meaning then is,
“Unless thy faith brings forth fruits, I deny that thou hast any faith.”
 <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md)

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p15"></span>But it may be asked, whether the outward
uprightness of life is a sure evidence of faith? For James says, “*I
will shew thee my faith by my works*.” To this I reply, that the
unbelieving sometimes excel in specious virtues, and lead an honorable
life free from every crime; and hence works apparently excellent may
exist apart from faith. Nor indeed does James maintain that every one
who seems good possesses faith. This only he means, that faith, without
the evidence of good works, is vainly pretended, because fruit ever
comes from the living root of a good tree.

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p16"></span><span id="vi.iii.vi-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p17"></span>**19** *Thou believest that there is one
God*. From this one sentence it appears evident that the whole dispute
is not about faith, but of the common knowledge of God, which can no
more connect man with God, than the sight of the sun carry him up to
heaven; but it is certain that by faith we come nigh to God. Besides, it
would be ridiculous were any one to say, that the devils have faith; and
James prefers them in this respect to hypocrites. The devil *trembles*,
he says, at the mention of God’s name, because when he acknowledges his
own judge he is filled with the fear of him. He then who despises an
acknowledged God is much worse.

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p18"></span>*Thou doest well*, is put down for the
purpose of extenuating, as though he had said, “It is, forsooth! a great
thing to sink down below the devils.”  <span

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p4"></span>**21** Was not Abraham our father
justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p5"></span>**21** Abraham pater noster, nonne ex

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p6"></span>**22** Seest thou how faith wrought with
his works, and by works was faith made perfect?

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p7"></span>**22** Vides quod fides cooperata fuerit

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p8"></span>**23** And the scripture was fulfilled
which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for
righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p9"></span>**23** Atque implenta fuit scriptura,
quae dicit, Credidit Abraham Deo, et imputatum illi fuit in justitiam,
et Amicus Deo vacatus est?

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p10"></span>**24** Ye see then how that by works a
man is justified, and not by faith only.

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p11"></span>**24** Videtis igitur quod ex operibus
justificatur homo, et non ex fide solum.

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p12"></span>**25** Likewise also was not Rahab the
harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had
sent *them* out another way?

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p13"></span>**25** Similiter et Rahab meretrix,
nonne ex operibus justificata est, quum excepit nuntios, et alia via
ejecit?

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p14"></span>**26** For as the body without the
spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p15"></span>**26** Quemadmodum enim corpus sine
anima mortuum est, ita et fides sine operibus mortua est.

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p16"></span> 

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p17"></span><span id="vi.iii.vii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p18"></span>**20** *But wilt thou know*. We must
understand the state of the question, for the dispute here is not
respecting the cause of justification, but only what avails a profession
of faith without works, and what opinion we are to form of it. Absurdly
then do they act who strive to prove by this passage that man is
justified by works, because James meant no such thing, for the proofs
which he subjoins refer to this declaration, that no faith, or only a
dead faith, is without works. No one will ever understand what is said,
nor judge wisely of words, except he who keeps in view the design of the
writer.

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p19"></span><span id="vi.iii.vii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p20"></span>**21** *Was not Abraham*. The Sophists
lay hold on the word *justified*, and then they cry out as being
victorious, that justification is partly by works. But we ought to seek
out a right interpretation according to the general drift of the whole
passage. We have already said that James does not speak here of the
cause of justification, or of the manner how men obtain righteousness,
and this is plain to every one; but that his object was only to shew
that good works are always connected with faith; and, therefore, since
he declares that Abraham was *justified by works*, he is speaking of the
proof he gave of his justification.

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p21"></span>When, therefore, the Sophists set up
James against Paul, they go astray through the ambiguous meaning of a
term. When Paul says that we are justified by faith, he means no other
thing than that by faith we are counted righteous before God. But James
has quite another thing in view, even to shew that he who professes that
he has faith, must prove the reality of his faith by his works.
Doubtless James did not mean to teach us here the ground on which our
hope of salvation ought to rest; and it is this alone that Paul dwells
upon.  <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md)

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p23"></span>That we may not then fall into that
false reasoning which has deceived the Sophists, we must take notice of
the two fold meaning, of the word *justified*. Paul means by it the
gratuitous imputation of righteousness before the tribunal of God; and
James, the manifestation of righteousness by the conduct, and that
before men, as we may gather from the preceding words, “Shew to me thy
faith,” etc. In this sense we fully allow that man is justified by
works, as when any one says that a man is enriched by the purchase of a
large and valuable chest, because his riches, before hid, shut up in a
chest, were thus made known.

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p24"></span><span id="vi.iii.vii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p25"></span>**22** *By works was faith made
perfect*  <span id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) By this he again
shews, that the question here is not respecting the cause of our
salvation, but whether works necessarily accompany faith; for in this
sense it is said to have been perfected by works, because it was not
idle. It is said to have been perfected by works, not because it
received thence its own perfection, but because it was thus proved to be
true. For the futile distinction which the Sophists draw from these
words, between formed and unformed faith, needs no labored refutation;
for the faith of Abram was formed and therefore perfected before he
sacrificed his son. And this work was not as it were the finishing, or
last work. Formerly things afterwards followed by which Abraham proved
the increase of his faith. Hence this was not the perfection of his
faith, nor did it then for the first time put on its form. James then
understood no other thing, than that the integrity of his faith then
appeared, because it brought forth that remarkable fruit of obedience.

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p27"></span><span id="vi.iii.vii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p28"></span>**23** *And the Scripture was
fulfilled*. They who seek to prove from this passage of James that the
works of Abraham were imputed for righteousness, must necessarily
confess that Scripture is perverted by him; for however they may turn
and twist, they can never make the effect to be its own cause. The
passage is quoted from Moses. (<span id="vi.iii.vii-p28.1"></span>[Ge
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.iii.vii-p28.1"></span>.) The imputation of righteousness which
Moses mentions, preceded more than thirty years the work by which they
would have Abraham to have been justified. Since faith was imputed to
Abraham fifteen years before the birth of Isaac, this could not surely
have been done through the work of sacrificing him. I consider that all
those are bound fast by an indissoluble knot, who imagine that
righteousness was imputed to Abraham before God, because he sacrificed
his son Isaac, who was not yet born when the Holy Spirit declared that
Abraham was justified. It hence necessarily follows that something
posterior is pointed out here.

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p29"></span>Why then does James say that it was
fulfilled? Even because he intended to shew what sort of faith that was
which justified Abraham; that is, that it was not idle or evanescent,
but rendered him obedient to God, as also we find in <span
id="vi.iii.vii-p29.1"></span>[Heb
11:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.iii.vii-p29.1"></span>. The conclusion, which is immediately
added, as it depends on this, has no other meaning. Man is not justified
by faith alone, that is, by a bare and empty knowledge of God; he is
justified by works, that is, his righteousness is known and proved by
its fruits.

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p30"></span><span id="vi.iii.vii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p31"></span>**25** *Likewise also was not Rahab*.
It seems strange that he connected together those who were so unlike.
Why did he not rather choose some one from so large a number of
illustrious fathers, and join him to Abraham? Why did he prefer a harlot
to all others? he designedly put together two persons so different in
their character, in order more clearly to shew, that no one, whatever
may have been his or her condition, nation, or class in society, has
ever been counted righteous without good works. He had named the
patriarch, by far the most eminent of all; he now includes under the
person of a harlot, all those who, being aliens, were joined to the
Church. Whosoever, then, seeks to be counted righteous, though he may
even be among the lowest, must yet shew that he is such by good works.

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p32"></span>James, according to his manner of
speaking, declares that Rahab was justified by works; and the Sophists
hence conclude that we obtain righteousness by the merits of works. But
we deny that the dispute here is concerning the mode of obtaining
righteousness. We, indeed, allow that good works are required for
righteousness; we only take away from them the power of conferring
righteousness, because they cannot stand before the tribunal of God.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p19"></span> It is commonly admitted to be an
interrogatory sentence: “And do ye not make a difference among (or, in)
yourselves, and become judges, having evil thoughts?” literally, “judges
of evil thoughts,” it being, as they say, the genitive case of
possession. Or the words may be rendered, “and become judges of evil
(or, false) reasonings?” or as *Beza* renders the sentence, “and become
judges, reasoning falsely,” concluding that the rich man was good and
the poor man bad.

<span id="vi.iii.i-p20"></span>It is said by *Beza* and others, that
<span id="vi.iii.i-p20.1"></span>διακρίνομαι never means to be judged or
condemned, but to distinguish, to discriminate, to make a difference,
and also to contend and to doubt. The difference made here was the
respect of persons that was shewn, and they made this difference in
themselves, in their own minds, through the perverse or false thoughts
or reasonings which they entertained. But it appears that these
preferences were shewn, not to the members of the Church, but to such
strangers as might happen to come to their assemblies.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[113](cc45020.htm#fr_112.md) <span
id="vi.iii.v-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.v-p16"></span> When he says “Can faith save him?” his
meaning is “Can the faith which he says he has save him?” that is, faith
which is dead and produces no works; for that is the faith clearly
intended here, as it appears from what follows. To make the meaning more
evident, *Macknight* renders the sentence thus, — “Can this faith save
him?” that is, the faith that has not works.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[114](cc45020.htm#fr_113.md) <span
id="vi.iii.v-p18.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.v-p19"></span> This is adduced as an illustration: as
the saying of a man to the naked, “Be ye clothed,” when he does nothing,
effects no good, is wholly useless, so is that faith that produces no
works; it being as it were dead, it cannot save.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[115](cc45020.htm#fr_114.md) <span
id="vi.iii.vi-p8.3"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p9"></span> I would render the verse thus:

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p10"></span>“But one may say, Thou hast faith, I
also have works; shew me thy faith *that is* without works, and I will
shew thee my faith by my works.”

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p11"></span>It is the same as though he had said,
“Thou hast faith only, I have also works in addition to my faith; now,
prove to me that you have true faith without having works connected with
it, (which was impossible, hence he is called a ‘vain man,’ or
empty-headed, in <span id="vi.iii.vi-p11.1"></span>[Jas
2:20](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.iii.vi-p11.1"></span>,) and I will prove my faith by its fruits,
even good works.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[116](cc45020.htm#fr_115.md) <span
id="vi.iii.vi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p13"></span> *Griesbach* and others regard <span
id="vi.iii.vi-p13.1"></span>χωρὶς as the true reading, countenanced by
most MSS., and found in the *Syr.* and *Vulg.*

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p14"></span>This verse is a key to the meaning of
James: faith is to be *proved* by works; then faith properly justifies
and saves, and works prove its genuineness. When he says that a man is
justified by works, the meaning according to this verse is, that a man
is proved by his works to be justified, his faith thereby being shewn to
be a living and not a dead faith. We may well be surprised, as
*Doddridge* was, that any, taking a view of this whole passage, should
ever think that there is any contrariety in what is here said to be the
teaching of Paul. The doctrine of Paul, that man is justified by faith
and not by works, that is, by a living faith, which works by love, is
perfectly consistent with what James says, that is, that a man is not
justified by a dead faith but by that faith which proves its living
power by producing good works, or by rendering obedience to God. The sum
of what James says is, that a dead faith cannot save, but a living
faith, and that a living faith is a working faith — a doctrine taught by
Paul as well as by James.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[117](cc45020.htm#fr_116.md) <span
id="vi.iii.vi-p18.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p19"></span> The design of alluding to the faith of
devils seems to have been this, to shew that though a good man may
believe and tremble, yet if he does not obey God and do good works, he
has no true evidence of faith. Obedient faith is that which saves, and
not merely that which makes us tremble. The connection with the
preceding verse seems to be as follows, —

<span id="vi.iii.vi-p20"></span>In the former verse the boaster of mere
faith is challenged to prove that his faith is right and therefore
saving; the challenger would prove by his works. Then, in this verse, a
test is applied — the very first article of faith is mentioned: “Be it
that you believe this, yet this faith will not save you: the devils have
this faith, and instead of being saved they tremble.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[118](cc45020.htm#fr_117.md) <span
id="vi.iii.vii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p22"></span> It is justly observed by *Scott*, that
there is the same difficulty in reconciling James with himself as with
Paul. And this difficulty at once vanishes, when we take a view of the
whole passage, and not confine ourselves to single expressions.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[119](cc45020.htm#fr_118.md) <span
id="vi.iii.vii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p26"></span> The previous sentence is hardly
intelligible in our version or in *Calvin’s.* “Seest thou how faith
wrought (co-operated, by *C*.) with his works?” The verb is <span
id="vi.iii.vii-p26.1"></span>συνεργέω, which means properly to work
together, to co-operate; and it means also, as the effect of
co-operating, to aid, to help. “Seest thou how faith aided him in his
works?” *Schleusner* gives this paraphrase, “Thou sees that Abraham was
aided by his faith to do his remarkable works.” *Beza’s* version is,
“Thou seest that faith was the assistant (*administer*) of his works.”
Some give the idea of combining to co-operating, “Thou seest that faith
co-operated with his works,” that is, in justification. It has been
said, that if this combination had been intended, it ought to have been
said that works co-operated with his faith, as faith, according to the
testimony of scripture and the nature of things, is the primary and the
principal thing, and as there can be no good works without faith. But
the first explanation is the most consonant with the words and with the
drift of the passage.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[120](cc45020.htm#fr_119.md) <span
id="vi.iii.vii-p32.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p33"></span> The last verse is left unnoticed, —

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p34"></span><span id="vi.iii.vii-p34.1"></span>[Jas
2:26](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.iii.vii-p34.1"></span> “For as the body without the spirit is
dead, so faith without works (or, having no works) is dead.”

<span id="vi.iii.vii-p35"></span>The meaning is not, that works are to
faith what the spirit is to the body, for that would make works to be
the life of faith, the reverse of the fact; but the meaning is, that
faith having no works is like a dead carcass without life.
