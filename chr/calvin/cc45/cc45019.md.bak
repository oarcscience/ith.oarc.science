<span id="vi.ii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="vi.ii.i"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.i-p1.1"></span>[James
1:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.ii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p2"></span>**1** James, a servant of God and of the
Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad,
greeting.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p3"></span>**1** Jacobus, Dei ac Domini Jesu Christi
servus, duodecim tribubus quae in dispersione sunt, salutem.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p4"></span>**2** My brethren, count it all joy when ye
fall into divers temptations;

<span id="vi.ii.i-p5"></span>**2** Omne gaudium existimate, fratres mei,
quum in tentationes varias incideritis;

<span id="vi.ii.i-p6"></span>**3** Knowing *this*, that the trying of
your faith worketh patience.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p7"></span>**3** Scientes quod probatio fidei vestrae,
patientiam operatur

<span id="vi.ii.i-p8"></span>**4** But let patience have *her* perfect
work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p9"></span>**4** Patientia vero opus perfectum habeat,
ut sitis perfecti et integri, in nullo deficientes.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p10"></span> 

<span id="vi.ii.i-p11"></span><span id="vi.ii.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p12"></span>**1** *To the twelve tribes*. When the ten
tribes were banished, the Assyrian king placed them in different parts.
Afterwards, as it usually happens in the revolutions of kingdoms (such
as then took place,) it is very probable that they moved here and there
in all directions. And the Jews had been scattered almost unto all
quarters of the world. He then wrote and exhorted all those whom he
could not personally address, because they had been scattered far and
wide. But that he speaks not of the grace of Christ and of faith in him,
the reason seems to be this, because he addressed those who had already
been rightly taught by others; so that they had need, not so much of
doctrine, as of the goads of exhortations.  <span
id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md)

<span id="vi.ii.i-p16"></span><span id="vi.ii.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p17"></span>**2** *All joy*. The first exhortation is,
to bear trials with a cheerful mind. And it was especially necessary at
that time to comfort the Jews, almost overwhelmed as they were with
troubles. For the very name of the nation was so infamous, that they
were hated and despised by all people wherever they went; and their
condition as Christians rendered them still more miserable, because they
held their own nation as their most inveterate enemies. At the same
time, this consolation was not so suited to one time, but that it is
always useful to believers, whose life is a constant warfare on earth.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p18"></span>But that we may know more fully what he
means, we must doubtless take *temptations* or *trials* as including all
adverse things; and they are so called, because they are the tests of
our obedience to God. He bids the faithful, while exercised with these,
to rejoice; and that not only when they fall into one temptation, but
into many, not only of one kind, but of various kinds. And doubtless,
since they serve to mortify our flesh, as the vices of the flesh
continually shoot up in us, so they must necessarily be often repeated.
Besides, as we labor under diseases, so it is no wonder that different
remedies are applied to remove them.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p19"></span>The Lord then afflicts us in various ways,
because ambition, avarice, envy, gluttony, intemperance, excessive love
of the world, and the innumerable lusts in which we abound, cannot be
cured by the same medicine.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p20"></span>When he bids us to *count it all joy*, it
is the same as though he had said, that temptations ought to be so
deemed as gain, as to be regarded as occasions of joy. He means, in
short, that there is nothing in afflictions which ought to disturb our
joy. And thus, he not only commands us to bear adversities calmly, and
with an even mind, but shews us that this is a reason why the faithful
should rejoice when pressed down by them.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p21"></span>It is, indeed, certain, that all the
senses of our nature are so formed, that every trial produces in us
grief and sorrow; and no one of us can so far divest himself of his
nature as not to grieve and be sorrowful whenever he feels any evil. But
this does not prevent the children of God to rise, by the guidance of
the Spirit, above the sorrow of the flesh. Hence it is, that in the
midst of trouble they cease not to rejoice.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p22"></span><span id="vi.ii.i-p22.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p23"></span>**3** *Knowing this, that the trying*. We
now see why he called adversities *trials* or *temptations*, even
because they serve to try our faith. And there is here a reason given to
confirm the last sentence. For it might, on the other hand, be objected,
“How comes it, that we judge that sweet which to the sense is bitter?”
He then shews by the effect that we ought to rejoice in afflictions,
because they produce fruit that ought to be highly valued, even
patience. If God then provides for our salvation, he affords us an
occasion of rejoicing. Peter uses a similar argument at the beginning of
his first Epistle, “That the trial of your faith, more precious than
gold, may be,” etc. \[<span id="vi.ii.i-p23.1"></span>[1Pe
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#007.md)<span id="vi.ii.i-p23.1"></span>.\]
We certainly dread diseases, and want, and exile, and prison, and
reproach, and death, because we regard them as evils; but when we
understand that they are turned through God’s kindness unto helps and
aids to our salvation, it is ingratitude to murmur, and not willingly to
submit to be thus paternally dealt with.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p24"></span>Paul says, in <span
id="vi.ii.i-p24.1"></span>[Ro 5:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#003.md)<span
id="vi.ii.i-p24.1"></span>, that we are to glory in tribulations; and
James says here, that we are to rejoice. “We glory,” says Paul, “in
tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience.” What
immediately follows seems contrary to the words of James; for he
mentions probation in the third place, as the effect of patience, which
is here put first as though it were the cause. But the solution is
obvious; the word there has an active, but here a passive meaning.
Probation or trial is said by James to produce patience; for were not
God to try us, but leave us free from trouble, there would be no
patience, which is no other thing than fortitude of mind in bearing
evils. But Paul means, that while by enduring we conquer evils, we
experience how much God’s help avails in necessities; for then the truth
of God is as it were in reality manifested to us. Hence it comes that we
dare to entertain more hope as to futurity; for the truth of God, known
by experience, is more fully believed by us. Hence Paul teaches that by
such a probation, that is, by such an experience of divine grace, hope
is produced, not that hope then only begins, but that it increases and
is confirmed. But both mean, that tribulation is the means by which
patience is produced.

<span id="vi.ii.i-p25"></span>Moreover, the minds of men are not so
formed by nature, that affliction of itself produces patience in them.
But Paul and Peter regard not so much the nature of men as the
providence of God through which it comes, that the faithful learn
patience from troubles; for the ungodly are thereby more and more
provoked to madness, as the example of Pharaoh proves.  <span
id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md)

<span id="vi.ii.i-p27"></span><span id="vi.ii.i-p27.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p28"></span>**4** *But let patience have her perfect
work.* As boldness and courage often appear in us and soon fail, he
therefore requires perseverance. “Real patience,” he says, “is that
which endures to the end.” For *work* here means the effort not only to
overcome in one contest, but to persevere through life. His perfection
may also he referred to the sincerity of the soul, that men ought
willingly and not feignedly to submit to God; but as the word *work* is
added, I prefer to explain it of constancy. For there are many, as we
have said, who shew at first an heroic greatness, and shortly after grow
weary and faint. He therefore bids those who would be *perfect* and
*entire*,  <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) to persevere to the
end. But what he means by these two words, he afterwards explains of
those who fail not, or become not wearied: for they, who being overcome
as to patience, be broken down, must, by degrees, be necessarily
weakened, and at length wholly fail.

<span id="vi.ii.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>[James
1:5-8](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#005.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p2"></span>**5** If any of you lack wisdom, let him
ask of God, that giveth to all *men* liberally, and upbraideth not; and
it shall be given him.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p3"></span>**5** Porro si quis autem vestrum
destituitur sapientia, postulet a Deo, qui dat omnibus simpliciter, nec
exprobrat; et dabitur ei.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p4"></span>**6** But let him ask in faith, nothing
wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the
wind and tossed.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p5"></span>**6** Postulet autem in fide, nihil
haesitans; nam qui haesitat similis est fluctui maris, qui a vento
agitur et circumfertur.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p6"></span>**7** For let not that man think that he
shall receive any thing of the Lord.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p7"></span>**7** non ergo existimet homo ille quod
sit quicquam accepturus a Domino.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p8"></span>**8** A double minded man *is* unstable in
all his ways.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p9"></span>**8** Vir duplici animo, instabilis est in
omnibus viis suis.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p10"></span> 

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p11"></span><span id="vi.ii.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p12"></span>**5** *If any of you lack wisdom.* As our
reason, and all our feelings are averse to the thought that we can be
happy in the midst of evils, he bids us to ask of the Lord to give us
wisdom. For *wisdom* here, I confine to the subject of the passage, as
though he had said, “If this doctrine is higher than what your minds can
reach to, ask of the Lord to illuminate you by his Spirit; for as this
consolation alone is sufficient to mitigate all the bitterness of evils,
that what is grievous to the flesh is salutary to us; so we must
necessarily be overcome with impatience, except we be sustained by this
kind of comfort.” Since we see that the Lord does not so require from us
what is above our strength, but that he is ready to help us, provided we
ask, let us, therefore, learn, whenever he commands anything, to ask
from him the power to perform it.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p13"></span>Though in this place to be wise is to
submit to God in the endurance of evils, under a due conviction that he
so orders all things as to promote our salvation; yet the sentence may
be generally applied to every branch of right knowledge.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p14"></span>But why does he say *If any one,* as
though all of them did not want wisdom. To this I answer, that all are
by nature without it; but that some are gifted with the spirit of
wisdom, while others are without it. As, then, all had not made such
progress as to rejoice in affliction, but few there were to whom this
had been given, James, therefore, referred to such cases; and he
reminded those who were not as yet fully convinced that by the cross
their salvation was promoted by the Lord, that they were to ask to be
endued with wisdom. And yet there is no doubt, but that necessity
reminds us all to ask the same thing; for he who has made the greatest
progress, is yet far off from the goal. But to ask an increase of wisdom
is another thing than to ask for it at first.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p15"></span>When he bids us to *ask of the Lord,* he
intimates, that he alone can heal our diseases and relieve our wants.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p16"></span>*That giveth to all men liberally*. By
*all*, he means those who ask; for they who seek no remedy for their
wants, deserve to pine away in them. However, this universal
declaration, by which every one of us is invited to ask, without
exception, is very important; hence no man ought to deprive himself of
so great a privilege.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p17"></span>To the same purpose is the promise which
immediately follows; for as by this command he shews what is the duty of
every one, so he affirms that they would not do in vain what he
commands; according to what is said by Christ,

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p18"></span>“Knock, and it shall be opened.”  
(<span id="vi.ii.ii-p18.2"></span>[Mt
7:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#007.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p18.2"></span>;
<span id="vi.ii.ii-p18.3"></span>[Lu
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/luk011.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.ii.ii-p18.3"></span>.)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p19"></span>The word *liberally*, or *freely*,
denotes promptitude in giving. So Paul, in <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p19.1"></span>[Ro
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p19.1"></span>,
requires simplicity in deacons. And in <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p19.2"></span>[2Co 8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#000.md)<span
id="vi.ii.ii-p19.2"></span> and <span id="vi.ii.ii-p19.3"></span>[2Co
9](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p19.3"></span>,
when speaking of charity or love, he repeats the same word several
times. The meaning, then, is, that God is so inclined and ready to give,
that he rejects none, or haughtily puts them off, being not like the
niggardly and grasping, who either sparingly, as with a closed hand,
give but little, or give only a part of what they were about to give, or
long debate with themselves whether to give or not.  <span
id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md)

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p21"></span>*And upbraideth not.* This is added, lest
any one should fear to come too often to God. Those who are the most
liberal among men, when any one asks often to be helped, mention their
formal acts of kindness, and thus excuse themselves for the future.
Hence, a mortal man, however open-handed he may be, we are ashamed to
weary by asking too often. But James reminds us, that there is nothing
like this in God; for he is ready ever to add new blessings to former
ones, without any end or limitation.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p22"></span><span id="vi.ii.ii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p23"></span>**6** *But let him ask in faith*. He
shews here, first the right way of praying; for as we cannot pray
without the word, as it were, leading the way, so we must believe before
we pray; for we testify by prayer, that we hope to obtain from God the
grace which he has promised. Thus every one who has no faith in the
promises, prays dissemblingly. Hence, also, we learn what is true faith;
for James, after having bidden us to ask in faith, adds this
explanation, *nothing wavering*, or, *doubting nothing*. Then faith is
that which relies on God’s promises, and makes us sure of obtaining what
we ask. It hence follows, that it is connected with confidence and
certainty as to God’s love towards us. The verb <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p23.1"></span>διακρίνεσθαι, which he uses, means properly
to inquire into both sides of a question, after the manner of pleaders.
He would have us then to be so convinced of what God has once promised,
as not to admit a doubt whether he shall be heard or not.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p24"></span>*He that wavereth*, or *doubteth*. By
this similitude he strikingly expresses how God punishes the unbelief of
those who doubt his promises; for, by their own restlessness, they
torment themselves inwardly; for there is never any calmness for our
souls, except they recumb on the truth of God. He, at length, concludes,
that such are unworthy to receive anything from God.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p25"></span>This is a remarkable passage, fitted to
disprove that impious dogma which is counted as an oracle under the
whole Papacy, that is, that we ought to pray doubtingly, and with
uncertainty as to our success. This principle, then, we hold, that our
prayers are not heard by the Lord, except when we have a confidence that
we shall obtain. It cannot indeed be otherwise, but that through the
infirmity of our flesh we must be tossed by various temptations, which
are like engines employed to shake our confidence; so that no one is
found who does not vacillate and tremble according to the feeling of his
flesh; but temptations of this kind are at length to be overcome by
faith. The case is the same as with a tree, which has struck firm roots;
it shakes, indeed, through the blowing of the wind, but is not rooted
up; on the contrary, it remains firm in its own place.

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p26"></span><span id="vi.ii.ii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p27"></span>**8** *A double-minded man*, or, *a man
of a double mind*. This sentence may be read by itself, as he speaks
generally of hypocrites. It seems, however, to me to be rather the
conclusion of the preceding doctrine; and thus there is an implied
contrast between the simplicity or liberality of God, mentioned before,
and the double-mindedness of man; for as God gives to us with a
stretched out hand, so it behooves us in our turn to open the bosom of
our heart. He then says that the unbelieving, who have tortuous
recesses, are *unstable*; because they are never firm or fixed, but at
one time they swell with the confidence of the flesh, at another they
sink into the depth of despair.  <span id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>[James
1:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p2"></span>**9** Let the brother of low degree
rejoice in that he is exalted:

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p3"></span>**9** Porro glorietur frater humilis in
sublimate sua;

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p4"></span>**10** But the rich, in that he is made
low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p5"></span>**10** Dives autem in humilitate sua,
quia tanquam flos herbae prateteribit.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p6"></span>**11** For the sun is no sooner risen
with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof
falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the
rich man fade away in his ways.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p7"></span>**11** Nam sol exortus est cum aestu, et
exarescit herba, et flos ejus cecidit, et decor aspectus ejus periit;
sic et dives in suis viis (*vel, copiis*) marcescet.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p8"></span> 

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p9"></span><span id="vi.ii.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p10"></span>**9** *Let the brother of low degree*.
As Paul, exhorting servants submissively to bear their lot, sets before
them this consolation, that they were the free-men of God, having been
set free by his grace from the most miserable bondage of Satan, and
reminds them, though free, yet to remember that they were the servants
of God; so here James in the same manner bids the lowly to glory in
this, that they had been adopted by the Lord as his children; and the
rich, because they had been brought down into the same condition, the
world’s vanity having been made evident to them. Thus the first thing he
would have to do is to be content with their humble and low state; and
he forbids the rich to be proud. Since it is incomparably the greatest
dignity to be introduced into the company of angels, nay, to be made the
associates of Christ, he who estimates this favor of God aright, will
regard all other things as worthless. Then neither poverty, nor
contempt, nor nakedness, nor famine nor thirst, will make his mind so
anxious, but that he will sustain himself with this consolation. “Since
the Lord has conferred on me the principal thing, it behooves me
patiently to bear the loss of other things, which are inferior.”

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p11"></span>Behold, how a lowly brother ought to
glory in his elevation or exaltation; for if he be accepted of God, he
has sufficient consolation in his adoption alone, so as not to grieve
unduly for a less prosperous state of life.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p12"></span><span id="vi.ii.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p13"></span>**10** *But the rich, in that he is made
low*, or, *in his lowness*. He has mentioned the particular for the
general; for this admonition pertains to all those who excel in honor;
or in dignity, or in any other external thing. He bids them to glory in
their lowness or littleness, in order to repress the haughtiness of
those who are usually inflated with prosperity. But he calls it
*lowness*, because the manifested kingdom of God ought to lead us to
despise the world, as we know that all the things we previously greatly
admired, are either nothing or very little things. For Christ, who is
not a teacher except of babes, checks by his doctrine all the
haughtiness of the flesh. Lest, then, the vain joy of the world should
captivate the rich, they ought to habituate themselves to glory in the
casting down of their carnal excellency.  <span
id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p15"></span>*As the flower of the grass*. Were any
one to say that James alludes to the words of Isaiah, I would not much
object; but I cannot allow that he quotes the testimony of the Prophet,
who speaks not only of the things of this life and the fading character
of the world, but of the whole man, both body and soul; \[<span
id="vi.ii.iii-p15.1"></span>[Isa
40:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iii-p15.1"></span>;\] but here what is spoken of is the pomp
of wealth or of riches. And the meaning is, that glorying in riches is
foolish and preposterous, because they pass away in a moment. The
philosophers teach the same thing; but the song is sung to the deaf,
until the ears are opened by the Lord to hear the truth concerning the
eternity of the celestial kingdom. Hence he mentions *brother*;
intimating that there is no place for this truth, until we are admitted
into the order of God’s children.

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p16"></span><span id="vi.ii.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p17"></span>Though the received reading is <span
id="vi.ii.iii-p17.1"></span>ἐν ταῖς πορείαις, yet I agree with Erasmus,
and read the last word, <span id="vi.ii.iii-p17.2"></span>πορίαις,
without the diphthong “in his riches,” or, with his riches; and the
latter I prefer.  <span id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iv"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>[James
1:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/jam001.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p2"></span>**12** Blessed *is* the man that endureth
temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life,
which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p3"></span>**12** Beatus vir qui suffert
temptationem; quod quum probatus fuerit, accipiet coronam vitae, quam
promisit Deus diligentibus ipsum.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p4"></span>**13** Let no man say when he is tempted,
I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither
tempteth he any man:

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p5"></span>**13** Nemo quum tentatur dicat, a Deo
tentor; Deus enim nec tentari malis potest, nec quenquam tentat.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p6"></span>**14** But every man is tempted, when he
is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p7"></span>**14** Sed unusquisque tentatur, dum a sua
concupiscentia abstrahitur, et inescatur.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p8"></span>**15** Then when lust hath conceived, it
bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p9"></span>**15** Postquam antum concupiscentia
conceperit, parit peccatum vero perfectum generat mortem.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p10"></span> 

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p11"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p12"></span>**12** *Blessed is the man*. After having
applied consolation, he moderated the sorrow of those who were severely
handled in this world, and again humbled the arrogance of the great. He
now draws this conclusion, that they are happy who magnanimously endure
troubles and other trials, so as to rise above them. The word temptation
may indeed be otherwise understood, even for the stings of lusts which
annoy the soul within; but which is here commended, as I think, is
fortitude of mind in enduring adversities. It is, however, a paradox,
that they are not happy to whom all things come according to their
wishes, but such as are not overcome with evils.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p13"></span>*For when he is tried*. He gives a reason
for the preceding sentence; for the crown follows the contest. If, then,
it be our chief happiness to be crowned in the kingdom of God, it
follows, that the contests with which the Lord tries us, are aids and
helps to our happiness. Thus the argument is from the end or the effect:
hence we conclude, that the faithful are harassed by so many evils for
this purpose, that their piety and obedience may be made manifest, and
that they may be thus at length prepared to receive the crown of life.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p14"></span>But they reason absurdly who hence infer
that we by fighting merit the crown; for since God has gratuitously
appointed it for us, our fighting only renders us fit to receive it.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p15"></span>He adds, that it is *promised* to those
who *love* God. By speaking thus, he means not that the love of man is
the cause of obtaining the crown, (for God anticipates us by his
gratuitous love;) but he only intimates that the elect who love him are
alone approved by God. He then reminds us that the conquerors of all
temptations are those who love God, and that we fail not in courage when
we are tried, for no other cause than because the love of the world
prevails in us.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p16"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p17"></span>**13** *Let no man, when he is tempted*.
Here, no doubt, he speaks of another kind of temptation. It is
abundantly evident that the external temptations, hitherto mentioned,
are sent to us by God. In this way God tempted Abraham, (<span
id="vi.ii.iv-p17.1"></span>[Ge
22:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iv-p17.1"></span>,) and daily tempts us, that is, he tries us
as to what are we by laying before us an occasion by which our hearts
are made known. But to draw out what is hid in our hearts is a far
different thing from inwardly alluring our hearts by wicked lusts.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p18"></span>He then treats here of inward temptations
which are nothing else than the inordinate desires which entice to sin.
He justly denies that God is the author of these, because they flow from
the corruption of our nature.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p19"></span>This warning is very necessary, for
nothing is more common among men than to transfer to another the blame
of the evils they commit; and they then especially seem to free
themselves, when they ascribe it to God himself. This kind of evasion we
constantly imitate, delivered down to us as it is from the first man.
For this reason James calls us to confess our own guilt, and not to
implicate God, as though he compelled us to sin.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p20"></span>But the whole doctrine of scripture seems
to be inconsistent with this passage; for it teaches us that men are
blinded by God, are given up to a reprobate mind, and delivered over to
filthy and shameful lusts. To this I answer, that probably James was
induced to deny that we are tempted by God by this reason, because the
ungodly, in order to form an excuse, armed themselves with testimonies
of Scripture. But there are two things to be noticed here: when
Scripture ascribes blindness or hardness of heart to God, it does not
assign to him the beginning of this blindness, nor does it make him the
author of sin, so as to ascribe to him the blame: and on these two
things only does James dwell.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p21"></span>Scripture asserts that the reprobate are
delivered up to depraved lusts; but is it because the Lord depraves or
corrupts their hearts? By no means; for their hearts are subjected to
depraved lusts, because they are already corrupt and vicious. But since
God blinds or hardens, is he not the author or minister of evil? Nay,
but in this manner he punishes sins, and renders a just reward to the
ungodly, who have refused to be ruled by his Spirit. (<span
id="vi.ii.iv-p21.1"></span>[Ro
1:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.ii.iv-p21.1"></span>.) It hence follows that the origin of sin is
not in God, and no blame can be imputed to him as though he took
pleasure in evils. (<span id="vi.ii.iv-p21.2"></span>[Ge
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006)<span id="vi.ii.iv-p21.2"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p22"></span>The meaning is, that man in vain evades,
who attempts to cast the blame of his vices on God, because every evil
proceeds from no other fountain than from the wicked lust of man. And
the fact really is, that we are not otherwise led astray, except that
every one has his own inclination as his leader and impeller. But that
God tempts no one, he proves by this, because he is *not tempted with
evils*  <span id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) For it is the devil who
allures us to sin, and for this reason, because he wholly burns with the
mad lust of sinning. But God does not desire what is evil: he is not,
therefore, the author of doing evil in us.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p26"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p26.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p27"></span>**14** *When he is drawn away by his own
lust.* As the inclination and excitement to sin are inward, in vain does
the sinner seek an cause from an external impulse. At the same time
these two effects of lust ought to be noticed — that it ensnares us by
its allurements, and that it does us away; each of which is sufficient
to render us guilty.  <span id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md)

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p30"></span><span id="vi.ii.iv-p30.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p31"></span>**15** *Then when lust hath conceived*.
He first calls that *lust* which is not any kind of evil affection or
desire, but that which is the fountain of all evil affections; by which,
as he shews, are conceived vicious broods, which at length break forth
into sins. It seems, however, improper, and not according to the usage
of Scripture, to restrict the word *sin* to outward works, as though
indeed lust itself were not a sin, and as though corrupt desires,
remaining closed up within and suppressed, were not so many sins. But as
the use of a word is various, there is nothing unreasonable if it be
taken here, as in many other places, for actual sin.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p32"></span>And the Papists ignorantly lay hold on
this passage, and seek to prove from it that vicious, yea, filthy,
wicked, and the most abominable lusts are not sins, provided there is no
assent; for James does not shew when sin begins to be born, so as to be
sin, and so accounted by God, but when it breaks forth. For he proceeds
gradually and shews that the consummation of sin is eternal death, and
that sin arises from depraved desires, and that these depraved desires
or affections have their root in lust. It hence follows that men gather
fruit in eternal perdition, and fruit which they have procured for
themselves.

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p33"></span>By *perfected sin*, therefore, I
understand, not any one act of sin perpetrated, but the completed course
of sinning. For though death is merited by every sin whatever, yet it is
said to be the reward of an ungodly and wicked life. Hence is the dotage
of those confuted who conclude from these words, that sin is not mortal
until it breaks forth, as they say, into an external act. Nor is this
what James treats of; but his object was only this, to teach that there
is in us the root of our own destruction.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p8"></span> 

<span id="vi.ii.v-p9"></span><span id="vi.ii.v-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.v-p10"></span>**16** *Do not err*. This is an argument
from what is opposite; for as God is the author of all good, it is
absurd to suppose him to be the author of evil. To do good is what
properly belongs to him, and according to his nature; and from him all
good things come to us. Then, whatever evil he does, is not agreeable to
his nature. But as it sometimes happens, that he who quits himself well
through life, yet in some things fails, he meets this doubt by denying
that God is mutable like men. But if God is in all things and always
like himself, it hence follows that well-doing is his perpetual work.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p11"></span><span id="vi.ii.v-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.v-p12"></span>This reasoning is far different from that
of Plato, who maintained that no calamities are sent on men by God,
because he is good; for though it is just that the crimes of men should
be punished by God, yet it is not right, with regard to him, to regard
among evils that punishment which he justly inflicts. Plato, indeed, was
ignorant; but James, leaving to God his right and office of punishing,
only removes blame from him. This passage teaches us, that we ought to
be so affected by God’s innumerable blessings, which we daily receive
from his hand, as to think of nothing but of his glory; and that we
should abhor whatever comes to our mind, or is suggested by others,
which is not compatible with his praise.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p13"></span>God is called the *Father of lights*, as
possessing all excellency and the highest dignity. And when he
immediately adds, that there is in him *no shadow of turning*, he
continues the metaphor; so that we may not measure the brightness of God
by the irradiation of the sun which appears to us.  <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md)

<span id="vi.ii.v-p15"></span><span id="vi.ii.v-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.v-p16"></span>**18** *Of his own will*. He now brings
forward a special proof of the goodness of God which he had mentioned,
even that he has regenerated us unto eternal life. This invaluable
benefit every one of the faithful feels in himself. Then the goodness of
God, when known by experience, ought to remove from them all a contrary
opinion respecting him.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p17"></span>When he says that God *of his own will*,
or spontaneously, *hath begotten us*, he intimates that he was induced
by no other reason, as the will and counsel of God are often set in
opposition to the merits of men. What great thing, indeed, would it have
been to say that God was not constrained to do this? But he impresses
something more, that God according to his own goodwill hath begotten us,
and has been thus a cause to himself. It hence follows that it is
natural to God to do good.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p18"></span>But this passage teaches us, that as our
election before the foundation of the world was gratuitous, so we are
illuminated by the grace of God alone as to the knowledge of the truth,
so that our calling corresponds with our election. The Scripture shews
that we have been gratuitously adopted by God before we were born. But
James expresses here something more, that we obtain the right of
adoption, because God does also call us gratuitously. (<span
id="vi.ii.v-p18.1"></span>[Eph. 1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#005)<span id="vi.ii.v-p18.1"></span>..md)
Farther, we hence learn, that it is the peculiar office of God
spiritually to regenerate us; for that the same thing is sometimes
ascribed to the ministers of the gospel, means no other thing than this,
that God acts through them; and it happens indeed through them, but he
nevertheless alone doeth the work.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p19"></span>The word *begotten* means that we become
new men, so that we put off our former nature when we are effectually
called by God. He adds how God begets us, even by *the word of truth*,
so that we may know that we cannot enter the kingdom of God by any other
door.

<span id="vi.ii.v-p20"></span>*That we should be a kind of firstfruits
of his creatures*. The word <span id="vi.ii.v-p20.1"></span>τινὰ,
“some,” has the meaning of likeness, as though he had said, that we are
in a manner firstfruits. But this ought not to be restricted to a few of
the faithful; but it belongs to all in common. For as man excels among
all creatures, so the Lord elects some from the whole mass and separates
them as a holy offering, to himself.  <span
id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) It is no common nobility into which
God extols his own children. Then justly are they said to be excellent
as firstfruits, when God’s image is renewed in them.

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p4"></span>**20** For the wrath of man worketh not

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p7"></span>**21** Quapropter deposita omni

sermonem qui potest servare animas vestras.

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p8"></span> 

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p9"></span><span id="vi.ii.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p10"></span>**19** *Let every man*. Were this a
general sentence, the inference would be farfetched; but as he
immediately adds a sentence respecting the word of truth suitable to the
last verse, I doubt not but that he accommodates this exhortation
peculiarly to the subject in hand. Having then set before us the
goodness of God, he shews how it becomes us to be prepared to receive
the blessing which he exhibits towards us. And this doctrine is very
useful, for spiritual generation is not a work of one moment. Since some
remnants of the old man ever abide in us, we must necessarily be through
life renewed, until the flesh be abolished; for either our perverseness,
or arrogance, or sloth, is a great impediment to God in perfecting in us
his work. Hence, when James would have us to be *swift to hear*, he
commends promptitude, as though he had said, “When God so freely and
kindly presents himself to you, you also ought to render yourselves
teachable, lest your slowness should cause him to desist from speaking.”

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p11"></span>But inasmuch as we do not calmly hear God
speaking to us, when we seem to ourselves to be very wise, but by our
haste interrupt him when addressing us, the Apostle requires us to be
silent, to be *slow to speak*. And, doubtless, no one can be a true
disciple of God, except he hears him in silence. He does not, however,
require the silence of the Pythagorean school, so that it should not be
right to inquire whenever we desire to learn what is necessary to be
known; but he would only have us to correct and restrain our
forwardness, that we may not, as it commonly happens, unseasonably
interrupt God, and that as long as he opens his sacred mouth, we may
open to him our hearts and our ears, and not prevent him to speak.

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p12"></span>*Slow to wrath*. Wrath also, I think, is
condemned with regard to the hearing which God demands to be given to
him, as though making a tumult it disturbed and impeded him, for God
cannot be heard except when the mind is calm and sedate. Hence, he adds,
that as long as wrath bears rule there is no place for the righteousness
of God. In short, except the heat of contention be banished, we shall
never observe towards God that calm silence of which he has just spoken.

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p13"></span><span id="vi.ii.vi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p14"></span>**21** *Wherefore lay apart*. He
concludes by saying how the word of life is to be received. And first,
indeed, he intimates that it cannot be rightly received except it be
implanted, or strike roots in us. For the expression, *to receive the
implanted word*, ought to be thus explained, “to receive it, that it may
be really implanted.” For he alludes to seed often sown on and ground,
and not received into the moist bosom of the earth; or to plants, which
being cast on the ground, or laid on dead wood, soon wither. He then
requires that it should be a living implanting, by which the word
becomes as it were united with our heart.

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p15"></span>He at the same time shews the way and
manner of this reception, even *with meekness*. By this word he means
humility and the readiness of a mind disposed to learn, such as Isaiah
describes when he says,

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p16"></span>“On whom does my Spirit rest, except on
the humble and meek?” (<span id="vi.ii.vi-p16.1"></span>[Isa
57:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.ii.vi-p16.1"></span>.)

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p17"></span>Hence it is, that so far profit in the
school of God, because hardly one in a hundred renounces the
stubbornness of his own spirit, and gently submits to God; but almost
all are conceited and refractory. But if we desire to be the living
plantation of God, we must subdue our proud hearts and be humble, and
labor to become like lambs, so as to suffer ourselves to be ruled and
guided by our Shepherd.

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p18"></span>But as men are never thus tamed, so as to
have a calm and meek heart, except they are purged from depraved
affections, so he bids us to *lay aside uncleanness and redundancy of
wickedness*. And as James borrowed a comparison from agriculture, it was
necessary for him to observe this order, to begin by rooting up noxious
weeds. And since he addressed all, we may hence conclude that these are
the innate evils of our nature, and that they cleave to us all; yea,
since he addresses the faithful, he shews that we are never wholly
cleansed from them in this life, but that they are continually sprouting
up, and therefore he requires that care should be constantly taken to
eradicate them. As the word of God is especially a holy thing; to be
fitted to receive it, we must put off the filthy things by which we have
been polluted.

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p19"></span>Under the word <span
id="vi.ii.vi-p19.1"></span>κακία, he comprehends hypocrisy and obstinacy
as well as unlawful desires or lusts. Not satisfied with specifying the
seat of wickedness as being in the soul of man, he teaches us that so
abounding is the wickedness that dwells there, that it overflows, or
that it rises up as it were into a heap; and doubtless, whosoever will
well examine himself will find that there is within him an immense chaos
of evils.  <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md)

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p22"></span>*Which is able to save*. It is a high
eulogy on heavenly truth, that we obtain through it a sure salvation;
and this is added, that we may learn to seek and love and magnify the
word as a treasure that is incomparable. It is then a sharp goad to
chastise our idleness, when he says that the word which we are wont to
hear so negligently, is the means of our salvation, though for this
purpose the power of saving is not ascribed to the word, as if salvation
is conveyed by the external sound of the word, or as if the office of
saving is taken away from God and transferred elsewhere; for James
speaks of the word which by faith penetrates into the hearts of men, and
only intimates that God, the author of salvation, conveys it by his
Gospel.

word and testifies by his life that he really believes, according to the
saying of Christ,

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p18"></span>for he shews by the fruits what that
implanting is, before mentioned. We must further observe, that faith
with all its works is included by James, yea, faith especially, as it is
the chief work which God requires from us. The import of the whole is,
that we ought to labor that the word of the Lord should strike root in
us, so that it may afterwards fructify.  <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md)

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p20"></span><span id="vi.ii.vii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p21"></span>**23** *He is like to a man*. Heavenly
doctrine is indeed a mirror in which God presents himself to our view;
but so that we may be transformed unto his image, as Paul says in <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p21.1"></span>[2Co
3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#018.md)<span
id="vi.ii.vii-p21.1"></span>. But here he speaks of the external glance
of the eye, not of the vivid and efficacious meditation which penetrates
into the heart. It is a striking comparison, by which he briefly
intimates, that a doctrine merely heard and not received inwardly into
the heart avails nothing, because it soon vanishes away.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p22"></span><span id="vi.ii.vii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p23"></span>**25** *The perfect law of liberty*.
After having spoken of empty speculation, he comes now to that
penetrating intuition which transforms us to the image of God. And as he
had to do with the Jews, he takes the word *law*, familiarly known to
them, as including the whole truth of God.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p24"></span>But why he calls it *a perfect law*, and
*a law of liberty*, interpreters have not been able to understand; for
they have not perceived that there is here a contrast, which may be
gathered from other passages of Scripture. As long as the law is
preached by the external voice of man, and not inscribed by the finger
and Spirit of God on the heart, it is but a dead letter, and as it were
a lifeless thing. It is, then, no wonder that the law is deemed
imperfect, and that it is the law of bondage; for as Paul teaches in
<span id="vi.ii.vii-p24.1"></span>[Ga
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024.md)<span
id="vi.ii.vii-p24.1"></span>, separated from Christ, it generates to
condemn and as the same shews to us in <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p24.2"></span>[Ro
8:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.ii.vii-p24.2"></span>, it can do nothing but fill us with
diffidence and fear. But the Spirit of regeneration, who inscribes it on
our inward parts, brings also the grace of adoption. It is, then, the
same as though James had said, “The teaching of the law, let it no
longer lead you to bondage, but, on the contrary, bring you to liberty;
let it no longer be only a schoolmaster, but bring you to perfection: it
ought to be received by you with sincere affection, so that you may lead
a godly and a holy life.”

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p25"></span>Moreover, since it is a blessing of the
Old Testament that the law of God should reform us, as it appears from
<span id="vi.ii.vii-p25.1"></span>[Jer
31:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#033.md)<span
id="vi.ii.vii-p25.1"></span>, and other passages, it follows that it
cannot be obtained until we come to Christ. And, doubtless, he alone is
the end and perfection of the law; and James adds *liberty*, as an
inseparable associate, because the Spirit of Christ never regenerates
but that he becomes also a witness and an earnest of our divine
adoption, so as to free our hearts from fear and trembling.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p26"></span>*And continueth*. This is firmly to
persevere in the knowledge of God; and when he adds, *this man shall be
blessed in his deed*, or work, he means that blessedness is to be found
in doing, not in cold hearing.  <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md)

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p28"></span><span id="vi.ii.vii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p29"></span>**26** *Seem to be religious*. He now
reproves even in those who boasted that they were doers of the law, a
vice under which hypocrites commonly labor, that is, the wantonness of
the tongue in detraction. He has before touched on the duty of
restraining the tongue, but for a different end; for he then bade
silence before God, that we might be more fitted to learn. He speaks now
of another thing, that the faithful should not employ their tongue in
evil speaking.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p30"></span>It was indeed needful that this vice
should be condemned, when the subject was the keeping of the law; for
they who have put off the grosser vices, are especially subject to this
disease. He who is neither an adulterer, nor a thief, nor a drunkard,
but, on the contrary, seems brilliant with some outward shew of sanctity
will set himself off by defaming others, and this under the pretense of
zeal, but really through the lust of slandering.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p31"></span>The object here, then, was to
distinguish between the true worshippers of God and hypocrites, who are
so swollen with Pharisaic pride, that they seek praise from the defects
of others. *If any one,* he says, *seems to be religious,* that is, who
has a show of sanctity, and the meantime flatters himself by speaking
evil of others, it is hence evident that he does not truly serve God.
For by saying that his religion is vain, he not only intimates that
other virtues are marred by the stain of evil-speaking, but that the
conclusion is, that the zeal for religion which appears is not sincere.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p32"></span>*But deceiveth his own heart*. I do not
approve of the version of Erasmus — “But suffers his heart to err;” for
he points out the fountain of that arrogance to which hypocrites are
addicted, through which, being blinded by an immoderate love of
themselves, they believe themselves to be far better than they really
are; and hence, no doubt, is the disease of slandering, because the
wallet, as Aesop says in his Apologue, hanging behind, is not seen.
Rightly, then, has James, wishing to remove the effect, that is, the
lust of evil-speaking, added the cause, even that hypocrites flatter
themselves immoderately. For they would be ready to forgive were they in
their turn to acknowledge themselves to be in need of forgiveness. Hence
the flatteries by which they deceive themselves as to their own vices,
make them such supercilious censors of others.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p33"></span><span id="vi.ii.vii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p34"></span>**27** *Pure religion*. As he passes by
those things which are of the greatest moment in religion, he does not
define generally what religion is, but reminds us that religion without
the things he mentions is nothing; as when one given to wine and
gluttony boasts that he is temperate, and another should object, and say
that the temperate man is he who does not indulge in excess as to wine
or eating; his object is not to express the whole of what temperance is,
but to refer only to one thing, suitable to the subject in hand. For
they are in vain religious of whom he speaks, as they are for the most
part trifling pretenders.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p35"></span>James then teaches us that religion is
not to be estimated by the pomp of ceremonies; but that there are
important duties to which the servants of God ought to attend.

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p36"></span>To *visit in necessity* is to extend a
helping hand to alleviate such as are in distress. And as there are many
others whom the Lord bids us to succor, in mentioning widows and
orphans, he states a part for the whole. There is then no doubt but that
under one particular thing he recommends to us every act of love, as
though he had said, “Let him who would be deemed religious, prove
himself to be such by self denial and by mercy and benevolence towards
his neighbors.”

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p37"></span>And he says, *before God*, to intimate
that it appears in deed otherwise to men, who are led astray by external
masks, but that we ought to seek what pleases him. By *God and Father*,
we are to understand God who is a father.

id="vi.ii.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p13"></span> The salutation is peculiar; but in the
same form with the letter sent to Antioch by the Apostles, (of whom
James was one,) and the church at Jerusalem, <span
id="vi.ii.i-p13.1"></span>[Ac
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#023.md)<span id="vi.ii.i-p13.1"></span>.
It is therefore apostolic, although adopted from a form commonly used by
the heathen writers. See <span id="vi.ii.i-p13.2"></span>[Ac
23:26](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#026.md)<span id="vi.ii.i-p13.2"></span>.
John in <span id="vi.ii.i-p13.3"></span>[Joh
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#010.md)<span id="vi.ii.i-p13.3"></span>
and <span id="vi.ii.i-p13.4"></span>[Joh
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#011.md)<span id="vi.ii.i-p13.4"></span>
uses the verb <span id="vi.ii.i-p13.5"></span>χαίρειν in a similar
sense; and it means properly to rejoice. It being an infinitive, the
verb <span id="vi.ii.i-p13.6"></span>λέγω, to say or to bid, is put
before it by John, and is evidently understood here. Hence the
salutation may thus be rendered, —

<span id="vi.ii.i-p14"></span>“James, a servant of God and of the Lord
Jesus Christ, bids, (or sends, or wishes) joy to the twelve tribes who
are in their dispersion.”

<span id="vi.ii.i-p15"></span>There had been an *eastern* and a
*western* dispersion, the first at the Assyrian and Babylonian
captivity, and the second during the predominancy of the Grecian power,
which commenced with Alexander the Great. As this epistle was written in
Greek, it was no doubt intended more especially for those of the latter
dispersion. But the benefit of the eastern dispersion was soon
consulted, as the very *first* version of the New Testament was made
into this language, that is, the Syriac; and this was done at the
beginning of the second century.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[99](cc45019.htm#fr_98.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p26"></span> The word used by James is <span
id="vi.ii.i-p26.1"></span>δοχίμιον, trial, the act of testing, and by
Paul <span id="vi.ii.i-p26.2"></span>δοχιμὴ, the result of testing,
experience. James speaks of probation, and Paul of the experience gained
thereby.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[100](cc45019.htm#fr_99.md) <span
id="vi.ii.i-p28.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.i-p29"></span> “Perfect, <span
id="vi.ii.i-p29.1"></span>τέλειοι,” fully grown, mature; “entire, <span
id="vi.ii.i-p29.2"></span>ὁλόχληζοι,” complete, no part wanting. The
first refers to the maturity of grace; and the second to its
completeness, no grace being wanting. They were to be like men full
grown, and not maimed or mutilated, but having all their members
complete.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[101](cc45019.htm#fr_100.md) <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p19.4"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p20"></span> The literal meaning of <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p20.1"></span>ἁπλῶς is simply without any mixture; the
noun, <span id="vi.ii.ii-p20.2"></span>ἁπλότης, is used in the sense of
sincerity, which has no mixture of hypocrisy or fraud, (<span
id="vi.ii.ii-p20.3"></span>[2Co
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.ii.ii-p20.3"></span>.) and in the sense of liberality, or
disposition free from what is sordid or parsimonious, having no mixture
of niggardliness, (<span id="vi.ii.ii-p20.4"></span>[2Co
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#002)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p20.4"></span>..md)
This latter is evidently the meaning here, so that “liberally,”
according to our version, is the best word.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[102](cc45019.htm#fr_101.md) <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.ii-p28"></span> “The double-minded,” or the man with two
souls, <span id="vi.ii.ii-p28.1"></span>δίψυχος, means here no doubt the
man who hesitates between faith and unbelief, because faith is the
subject of the passage. When again used, in <span
id="vi.ii.ii-p28.2"></span>[Jas
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.ii.ii-p28.2"></span>,
it means a hesitation between God and the world.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[103](cc45019.htm#fr_102.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p14"></span> The opinion of *Macknight* and some
others, that the reference is to the lowness to which the rich were
reduced by persecution, does not comport with the passage, for the
Apostle afterwards speaks of the shortness of man’s life and its
uncertainty, and not of the fading nature of riches, which would have
been most suitable, had he in view to comfort the rich at the loss of
property. The Christian state was “lowness” according to the estimation
of the world.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[104](cc45019.htm#fr_103.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iii-p17.3"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iii-p18"></span> The received text is regarded as the
best reading; the other is found in very few copies.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[105](cc45019.htm#fr_104.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p22.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p23"></span> Literally, “untemptable by evils,” that
is, not capable of being tempted or seduced by evils, by things wicked
and sinful. He is so pure, that he is not influenced by any evil
propensities, that he is not subject to any evil suggestions. It hence
follows that he tempts or seduces no man to what is sinful. Being
himself unassailable by evils, he cannot seduce others to what is evil.
As God cannot be tempted to do what is sinful, he cannot possibly tempt
others to sin. The words may thus be rendered, —

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p24"></span> 

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p25"></span>**13**. “Let no one, when seduced, say,
‘By God I am seduced;’ for God is not capable of being seduced by evils,
and he himself seduceth no one.”

<span id="fn_105"></span>[106](cc45019.htm#fr_105.md) <span
id="vi.ii.iv-p27.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p28"></span> The words are very striking, — “But
every one is tempted (or, seduced) when, by his own lust, *he is* drawn
away, (that is, from what is good,) and *is* caught by a bait (or,
ensnared.)”

<span id="vi.ii.iv-p29"></span>He is in the first drawn off from the
line of duty, and then he is caught by something that is pleasing and
plausible, but like the bait, it has in it a deadly hook.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[107](cc45019.htm#fr_106.md) <span
id="vi.ii.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.v-p14"></span> This verse must be taken in connection
with what as gone before. When he mentions “every good gift,” it is in
opposition to the evil of which he says God is not the author. See <span
id="vi.ii.v-p14.1"></span>[Mt
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/mat007.htm#011.md)<span id="vi.ii.v-p14.1"></span>.
And “every perfect free-gift,” as <span id="vi.ii.v-p14.2"></span>δώρημα
means, has a reference to the correction of the evil which arises from
man himself. And he calls free-gift perfect, because it has no mixture
of evil, what he throughout denies that God is the author of. Then the
latter part of the verse bears a correspondence with the first. He calls
God “the Father of Lights.” Light in the language of scripture means
especially two things, the light of truth, divine knowledge and
holiness. God is the father, the parent, the origin, the source of these
lights. Hence from him descends every good, useful, necessary gift, to
deliver men from evil, from ignorance and delusion, and every perfect
free-gift to free men from their evil lusts, and to render them holy and
happy. And to shew that God is ever the same, he adds, “with whom there
is no variableness or the shadow (or shade, of the slightest appearance)
of a change;” that is, who never varies in his dealings with men, and
shews no symptom of any change, being the author and giver of all good,
and the author of no evil, that is, of no sin.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[108](cc45019.htm#fr_107.md) <span
id="vi.ii.v-p20.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.v-p21"></span> The firstfruits being a part and a pledge
of the coming harvest, to retain the metaphor, we must regard
“creatures” here as including all the saved in future ages. Hence their
opinion is to be preferred, who regard the first converts, who were
Jews, as the firstfruits.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[109](cc45019.htm#fr_108.md) <span
id="vi.ii.vi-p19.2"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p20"></span> What renders this passage unsatisfactory
is the meaning given to <span id="vi.ii.vi-p20.1"></span>περισσεία,
rendered by some “superfluity,” and by others “redundancy.” The verb
<span id="vi.ii.vi-p20.2"></span>περισσεύω means not only to abound, but
also to be a residue, to remain, to be a remnant. See <span
id="vi.ii.vi-p20.3"></span>[Mt
14:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.ii.vi-p20.3"></span>; <span id="vi.ii.vi-p20.4"></span>[Lu
9:17](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#017.md)<span id="vi.ii.vi-p20.4"></span>.
And its derivative <span id="vi.ii.vi-p20.5"></span>περίσσευμα is used
in the sense of a remnant or a remainder, <span
id="vi.ii.vi-p20.6"></span>[Mr
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/mar008.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.ii.vi-p20.6"></span>;
and this very word is used in the *Sept.*, for <span
id="vi.ii.vi-p20.7"></span>יתר which means *a residue, a remnant,* or
*what remains,* <span id="vi.ii.vi-p20.8"></span>[Eze
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/eze006.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.ii.vi-p20.8"></span>.
Let it have this meaning here, and the sense will not only be clear, but
very striking. James was addressing those who were Christians; and he
exhorted them to throw away every uncleanness and remnant of wickedness,
or evil, as the word <span id="vi.ii.vi-p20.9"></span>κακία more
properly means. See <span id="vi.ii.vi-p20.10"></span>[Ac
8:22](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.ii.vi-p20.10"></span>; <span id="vi.ii.vi-p20.11"></span>[1Pe
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016.md)<span id="vi.ii.vi-p20.11"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vi-p21"></span>“Every uncleanness,” or filthiness, means
every kind of uncleanness arising from lustful and carnal indulgences;
and the “remnant of wickedness,” in thought and in deed, most suitably
follows.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[110](cc45019.htm#fr_109.md) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p19"></span> *Calvin* takes no notice of the last
sentence, “deceiving yourselves.” The participle means deceiving by
false reasoning.; it may be rendered with *Doddridge*, “sophistically
deceiving yourselves.”

<span id="fn_110"></span>[111](cc45019.htm#fr_110.md) <span
id="vi.ii.vii-p26.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii.vii-p27"></span> It may be rendered thus, — “The same
shall be blessed in (or by) the doing of it,” that is, the work. The
very doing of the law of liberty, of what the gospel prescribes, makes a
man blessed or happy.
