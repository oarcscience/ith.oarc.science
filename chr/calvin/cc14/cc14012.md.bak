<span id="xiii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 24

<span id="xiii.i"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p1"></span>Isaiah Chapter 24:1-23

<span id="xiii.i-p2"></span>**1**. Behold, the Lord maketh the earth
empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth
abroad the inhabitants thereof.

<span id="xiii.i-p3"></span>**1**. Ecce Iehova evacuat terram, denudat
eam, evertit faciem ejus, et incolas ejus dissipat.

<span id="xiii.i-p4"></span>**2**. And it shall be, as with the people,
so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the
maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as
with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so
with the giver of usury to him.

<span id="xiii.i-p5"></span>**2**. Et erit ut populus, ita sacerdos; ut
servus, ita domina ejus; ut ancilla, ita domina ejus; ut emptor, ita
venditor; ut mutuo dans, ita qui mutuo accipit; ut foenerator, ita qui
accipit foenori, (*vel, ut creditor, ita debitor*.)

<span id="xiii.i-p6"></span>**3**. The land shall be utterly emptied,
and utterly spoiled: for the Lord hath spoken this word.

<span id="xiii.i-p7"></span>**3**. Evacuando evacuabitur terra, et
direptione diripietur; quoniam Iehova pronunciavit hoc verbum.

<span id="xiii.i-p8"></span>**4**. The earth mourneth *and* fadeth away;
the world languisheth *and* fadeth away; the haughty people of the earth
do languish.

<span id="xiii.i-p9"></span>**4**. Luxit, cecidit terra; elanguit,
cecidit orbis; elanguerunt qui erant sublimis populus terræ.

<span id="xiii.i-p10"></span>**5**. The earth also is defiled under the
inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed
the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.

<span id="xiii.i-p11"></span>**5**. Et terra fallax fuit sub incolis
suis; quoniam transgressi sunt leges, mutarunt statutum, dissolverunt
foedus seculi.

<span id="xiii.i-p12"></span>**6**. Therefore hath the curse devoured
the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate: therefore the
inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.

<span id="xiii.i-p13"></span>**6**. Itaque maledictio cosumpsit terram,
et desolati sunt incolæ ejus; ideo combusti sunt, inquam, incolæ terræ;
et pauci residui sunt facti homines.

<span id="xiii.i-p14"></span>**7**. The new wine mourneth, the vine
languisheth, all the merry hearted do sigh.

<span id="xiii.i-p15"></span>**7**. Periit vinum, elanguit vitis,
gemuerunt omnes qui læto erant corde.

<span id="xiii.i-p16"></span>**8**. The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the
noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.

<span id="xiii.i-p17"></span>**8**. Cessavit gaudium tympanorum, desiit
strepitus exultantium, quievit lætitia citharæ.

<span id="xiii.i-p18"></span>**9**. They shall not drink wine with a
song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.

<span id="xiii.i-p19"></span>**9**. Cum cantico non bibent vinum; amara
erit sicera bibentibus eam.

<span id="xiii.i-p20"></span>**10**. The city of confusion is broken
down; every house is shut up, that no man may come in.

<span id="xiii.i-p21"></span>**10**. Contrita est civitas vanitatis;
clausa est omnis domus, ne quis ingrediatur.

<span id="xiii.i-p22"></span>**11** *There is* a crying for wine in the
streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.

<span id="xiii.i-p23"></span>**11**. Clamor est super vino in plateis;
obscuratum est omne gaudium; migravit lætitia terræ.

<span id="xiii.i-p24"></span>**12**. In the city is left desolation, and
the gate is smitten with destruction.

<span id="xiii.i-p25"></span>**12**. Residua est in urbe vastitas, et
vastatione percussa est porta.

<span id="xiii.i-p26"></span>**13**. When thus it shall be in the midst
of the land among the people, *there shall be* as the shaking of an
olive tree, *and* as the gleaning-grapes when the vintage is done.

<span id="xiii.i-p27"></span>**13**. Quia sic erit in medio terræ, in
medio populorum, quasi decussio olivæ, et quasi racemi, cum peracta est
vindemia.

<span id="xiii.i-p28"></span>**14**. They shall lift up their voice,
they shall sing for the majesty of the Lord, they shall cry aloud from
the sea.

<span id="xiii.i-p29"></span>**14**. Hi levabunt vocem suam; jubilabunt
in altitudine Iehovæ, vociferabuntur a mari.

<span id="xiii.i-p30"></span>**15**. Wherefore glorify ye the Lord in
the fires, *even* the name of the Lord God of Israel in the isles of the
sea.

<span id="xiii.i-p31"></span>**15**. Propterea in vallibus glorificate
Iehovam, in insulis maris nomen Iehovæ Dei Israel.

<span id="xiii.i-p32"></span>**16**. From the uttermost part of the
earth have we heard songs, *even* glory to the righteous. But I said, My
leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt
treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very
treacherously.

<span id="xiii.i-p33"></span>**16**. Ab extremo terræ laudes audivimus,
gloriam (*vel*, *gratulationem*) justo, et dixi, Macies mihi, macies
mihi, væ mihi. Prævaricatores prævaricati sunt; prævaricatione, inquam,
prævaricatores prævaricati sunt.

<span id="xiii.i-p34"></span>**17**. Fear, and the pit, and the snare,
*are* upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.

<span id="xiii.i-p35"></span>**17**. Pavor, et fovea, et laqueus super
te, O icola terræ.

<span id="xiii.i-p36"></span>**18**. And it shall come to pass, *that*
he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he
that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare:
for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth
do shake.

<span id="xiii.i-p37"></span>**18**. Et accidet ut qui effugerit a voce
pavoris, incidat in foveam; et qui ascenderit e medio foveæ capiatur
laqueo. Quoniam fenestræ de excelso apertæ sunt; et commota sunt
fundamenta terræ.

<span id="xiii.i-p38"></span>**19**. The earth is utterly broken down,
the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.

<span id="xiii.i-p39"></span>**19**. Contritione contrita est terra;
dissolutione dissoluta est terra; commotione commota est terra.

<span id="xiii.i-p40"></span>**20**. The earth shall reel to and fro
like a drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the
transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not
rise again.

<span id="xiii.i-p41"></span>**20**. Agitatione agitata est terra, sicut
ebrius; et transferetur sicut tabernaculum; et gravis erit super eam
iniquitas ejus; et corruet, neque adjiciet ut resurgat.

<span id="xiii.i-p42"></span>**21**. And it shall come to pass in that
day, *that* the Lord shall punish the host of the high ones *that are*
on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.

<span id="xiii.i-p43"></span>**21**. Et erit in die illa, visitabit
Iehova super exercitum excelsum in excelso, et super reges terræ super
terram.

<span id="xiii.i-p44"></span>**22**. And they shall be gathered
together, *as* prisoners are gathered in the pit, and shall be shut up
in the prison, and after many days shall they be visited.

<span id="xiii.i-p45"></span>**22**. Et congregabuntur congregatione
instar vinctorum in carcere, et claudentur in ergastulo; deinde post
multos dies visitabuntur.

<span id="xiii.i-p46"></span>**23**. Then the moon shall be confounded,
and the sun ashamed, when the Lord of hosts shall reign in mount Zion,
and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.

<span id="xiii.i-p47"></span>**23**. Erubescet luna, et pudefiet sol;
cum regnaverit Iehova exercituum in monte Sion, et in Ierusalem; et
coram senibus suis gloria.

<span id="xiii.i-p48"></span> 

<span id="xiii.i-p49"></span><span id="xiii.i-p49.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p50"></span>**1.** *Behold, Jehovah maketh the earth
empty.* This prophecy, so far as I can judge, is the conclusion of all
the descriptions that have been given from the thirteenth chapter
downwards, in which Isaiah foretold destruction not only to the Jews and
to Israel, but to the Moabites, Assyrians, Egyptians, and other nations.
In short, having, as it were, surveyed all the countries which were near
the Jews and known to them, he gives a brief summary of the whole. Some
view this as referring to Israel, and others to the Jews, and think that
their destruction is foretold; but as he mentions *the world*, I can
view it in no other light than as a comprehensive statement of all that
he formerly said about each of them, and at different times. Nor is this
view contradicted by the fact that he immediately mentions *the priest*,
which might lead us to believe that these things relate to none but the
people of God; for although he speaks of all the nations, yet because
the Jews always hold the highest rank, Isaiah must have had them
especially in his eye, for he was appointed to them. It may be said to
have been accidental that he mentions other nations; and therefore we
ought not to wonder if, after having made reference to them, he speaks
particularly about his own people in a single word.

<span id="xiii.i-p51"></span>Others suppose that he means “the whole
world,” but think that he refers to the last day, which I consider to be
an excessively forced interpretation; for, after having threatened the
Jews and other nations, the Prophet afterwards adds a consolation, that
the Lord will one day raise up his Church and make her more flourishing;
which certainly cannot apply to the last judgment. But by the term *the
earth*, I do not think that the Prophet means the whole world, but the
countries well known to the Jews; just as in the present day, when we
speak of what happens in the world, we almost never go beyond Europe, or
think of what is passing in India; for this may be said to be our world.
Thus, Isaiah speaks of “the earth” known to himself and to all whom he
addressed, and of the people who inhabited the neighboring countries. In
short, we may limit the term “World” to the Egyptians, Assyrians,
Moabites, Tyrians, and such like; as if he had said, “Hitherto I have
spoken of various calamities, which threatened many nations, and still
in part threaten some of them; but I may sum up all by saying, ‘The Lord
will overturn and strip the face of the earth of all its ornaments.’”

<span id="xiii.i-p52"></span>*And maketh it bare.*  <span
id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) Some translate <span
id="xiii.i-p67.1"></span>בלקה, (*bōlĕkāch*,) *he uncovereth the earth,*
that the enemies may have free entrance into it. But I choose rather to
translate it, “he maketh bare the earth,” because the earth is said to
be “covered,” when it is inhabited by a great multitude of men, and when
it abounds in fruits and flocks; and it is said to be “uncovered” or
“laid bare,” when it is deprived of its inhabitants, and when its
covering is taken away from it, as if one were stripped of his raiment
and ornaments. Now, this must have happened not only to the Jews, but to
the Assyrians, Egyptians, and other nations, which he had mentioned; and
therefore to all of them together he threatens their ruin.

<span id="xiii.i-p68"></span><span id="xiii.i-p68.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p69"></span>**2.** *And it shall be.* By these words he
means the utmost desolation, in which there will be no longer any
distinction of ranks or any appearance of a commonwealth; for so long as
there is a tolerably regular form of government, some distinction
continues to be maintained between “the people” and “the priests.” By a
figure of speech, in which a part is taken for the whole, (<span
id="xiii.i-p69.1"></span>συνεκδοχικῶς,) he mentions one department
instead of the whole class, as is frequently done in the Scriptures;
though we might take <span id="xiii.i-p69.2"></span>כחנים, (*kōchănīm*,)
to mean those who hold any high rank; for Hebrew writers frequently give
this name to princes, and especially to those who are of royal blood;
but I have no reluctance to view it as an instance of the figure of
speech which I have mentioned.

<span id="xiii.i-p70"></span>Since Isaiah reckons this confusion among
the curses of God, and declares that, when the distinction of ranks is
laid aside, it is a terrible display of the vengeance of God, we ought
to conclude, on the other hand, how much God is pleased with regular
government and the good order of society, and also how great a privilege
it is to have it preserved among us; for when it is taken away, the life
of man differs little from the sustenance of cattle and of beasts of
prey. We ought therefore not only to acknowledge the dreadful vengeance
of God, but also to lay it to the blame of our own sins, whenever he
breaks down order and takes away instruction and courts of law; for when
these fall, civilisation itself falls along with them. It ought also to
be considered that, when the Lord executes his judgments, he spares no
rank, not even the most sacred. What was this order of priests, which
the Lord had so splendidly adorned, and had determined to consecrate to
himself, and of which the people also boasted as if it had been
unchangeable and eternal? Yet even the rank of priesthood is involved in
the judgment of God, because there is no respect of persons, but, on the
contrary, the more highly any have been favored, and the higher the rank
to which they have been exalted, the more severely will he punish them,
if they shall shew themselves to be ungrateful and abuse his benefits.

<span id="xiii.i-p71"></span>*As the servant, so his master; as the
buyer, so the seller.* This statement is to the same effect with what
goes before; for these ranks are manifestly lawful, and are not usually
set aside, unless when the Lord determines to chastise his people with
dreadful vengeance, as we have already said; for in a well-ordered
society the distinction between master and servant must be observed. In
like manner, no public government can be lasting without the
transactions of commerce; and therefore, when the distinction between
rich and poor has been taken away, every scheme for gaining a livelihood
among men is destroyed. The meaning of the Prophet is, that all civil
government will be broken up, because in such calamities, they who were
the wealthiest are reduced to the lowest poverty. In short, he describes
the most appalling desolation, which will be followed by unwonted
change.

<span id="xiii.i-p72"></span><span id="xiii.i-p72.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p73"></span>**3.** *By emptying shall the earth be
emptied.* He confirms what he had already said, and declares that those
changes will not be accidental, but that they are the work of God. In
the first verse, he had expressly stated that God is making preparations
for emptying the earth: he now asserts that it will happen, and adds the
reason, that God hath purposed and determined to do it.

<span id="xiii.i-p74"></span><span id="xiii.i-p74.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p75"></span>**4.** *The earth hath lamented.* Isaiah
proceeds with his subject; for all this tends to explain the desolation
of the whole world, that is, of the world which was known to the Jews.
According to his custom, he illustrates the judgment of God more clearly
by figures, which are fitted to produce an effect on sluggish minds.

<span id="xiii.i-p76"></span>*The lofty people of the earth.*  <span
id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) By the “lofty ones” we must understand
those eminent persons who held a higher rank than others; for this is
more wonderful than if the common people had fallen. Yet if it be
thought preferable to explain it as relating peculiarly to the Jews, I
have no objection; for although the Assyrians and Egyptians excelled
them in wealth and power, still the Jews held the highest rank in this
respect, that they had been adopted by God. But I prefer the other
exposition, which makes the meaning to be, that the Lord would inflict
punishment, not only on common people, but also on those who surpassed
others in rank and splendor.

<span id="xiii.i-p78"></span><span id="xiii.i-p78.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p79"></span>**5.** *And the earth was deceitful.*
 <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) Others render it “defiled” or
“polluted,” because <span id="xiii.i-p80.1"></span>כנף (*chānăph*) means
“to be wicked.” Both renderings may be appropriate; but the next verse
appears to demand that we explain it to mean *false*; for he appears to
illustrate and exhibit it more fully immediately afterwards, when he
says that “the earth has been consumed by a curse.”

<span id="xiii.i-p81"></span>*Under its inhabitants.* Whether <span
id="xiii.i-p81.1"></span>תהת (*tăhăth*) be translated “*Under* its
inhabitants,” or, “*On account of* its inhabitants,” is of little
importance. There is a kind of mutual bargain between the land and the
husbandmen, that it gives back with usury what it has received: if it
does not, it deceives those who cultivate it. But he assigns a reason,
imputing blame to them, that they render it barren by their wickedness.
It is owing to our fault that it does not nourish us or bring forth
fruit, as God appointed to be done by the regular order of nature; for
he wished that it should hold the place of a mother to us, to supply us
with food; and if it change its nature and order, or lose its fertility,
we ought to attribute it to our sins, since we ourselves have reversed
the order which God had appointed; otherwise the earth would never
deceive us, but would perform her duty.

<span id="xiii.i-p82"></span>*Because they have transgressed the laws.*
He immediately assigns the reason why the earth is unfaithful, and
deceives her inhabitants. It is because those who refuse to honor God
their Father and supporter, will justly be deprived of food and
nourishment. Here he peculiarly holds up to shame the revolt of his
nation, because it was baser and less excusable than all the
transgressions of those who had never been taught in the school of God.
The word <span id="xiii.i-p82.1"></span>תורה (*tōrāh*) is applied to
“the Law,” because it denotes instruction; but here, in the plural
number, <span id="xiii.i-p82.2"></span>תורת (*tōrōth*,) it denotes all
the instruction that is contained in the “Law.” But as the “Law”
contains both commandments and promises, he adds two parts for the
purpose of explanation.

<span id="xiii.i-p83"></span>*They have changed the ordinance.* The
Hebrew word <span id="xiii.i-p83.1"></span>חק (*chōk*) means “an
ordinance,” and on that account some think that it denotes ceremonies,
and others that it denotes morals. We may render it “commandments;” and
I understand it to mean not only ceremonies, but everything that belongs
to the rule of a holy life.

<span id="xiii.i-p84"></span>*They have broken the everlasting
covenant.* The third term employed by him is, <span
id="xiii.i-p84.1"></span>ברית, (*bērīth*,) by which he means a covenant
and contract. This word is limited to those “contracts” by which the
Lord, who adopted his people, promised that he would be their God.
(<span id="xiii.i-p84.2"></span>[Exod.
19:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#006.md), [Exod.
29:45](../../../bib/kjv/exo029.htm#045.md)<span id="xiii.i-p84.2"></span>;
<span id="xiii.i-p84.3"></span>[Le
26:12](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#012)<span id="xiii.i-p84.3"></span>..md)
He therefore charges them with ingratitude, because, when the Lord
revealed himself by all these methods, and gave proofs of his love, they
were disobedient and rebellious, “transgressed the laws,” and “broke the
holy covenant.”

<span id="xiii.i-p85"></span>But why does he address himself to the
Jews? Because he knew that he had been appointed to be their Prophet,
that he might especially give instructions to them. Hence we may infer
what is the rule of a holy life. It is contained in that law which we
ought to follow if we wish that God should approve of our life; if we
turn aside from it, we must be wicked and abandoned. We ought also to
remark, that it is the will of God that in his word we should consider
not only his commandments and laws, but also his covenant; for the chief
part of the word consists of promises, by which he adopts and receives
us as his own people. Besides, the Prophet unquestionably intended to
use a variety of terms in order to express his meaning more strongly; as
if he had said, “There is nothing about us that is sound and pure;
everything is polluted and corrupted.”

<span id="xiii.i-p86"></span>He calls it “the covenant of eternity,” or
“the everlasting covenant,” because it ought to be perpetual and
inviolable, and to be in force in every age. It was to be transmitted,
in uninterrupted succession, from father to son, that it might never be
effaced from the memory of man, but might be kept pure and entire. He
therefore represents in strong terms their treachery and wickedness,
because they dared to violate that covenant which God had made with
them, and to overthrow what the Lord intended to be firm and permanent.
This was monstrous; and therefore we ought not to wonder that the earth
takes vengeance for this wickedness, and refuses to give food to men.

<span id="xiii.i-p87"></span><span id="xiii.i-p87.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p88"></span>**6.** *Therefore hath the curse devoured
the earth.* Some render it *perjury*,  <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) but as <span
id="xiii.i-p89.1"></span>אלה (ā*lāh*) signifies also a “curse,” I have
no doubt that here he employs it to denote a “curse,” and alludes to
those curses which Moses in the law threatens against wicked men and
transgressors of the law, (<span id="xiii.i-p89.2"></span>[Le
26:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#016.md)<span id="xiii.i-p89.2"></span>;
<span id="xiii.i-p89.3"></span>[De
28:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015)<span id="xiii.i-p89.3"></span>..md)
We know that the earth was cursed on account of the transgression of our
first parent, so that it brought forth thorns and thistles instead of
fruits. (<span id="xiii.i-p89.4"></span>[Gen.
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#018)<span id="xiii.i-p89.4"></span>..md)
The Lord mitigated this curse, so that, although men were ungrateful and
unworthy, still it yielded them food. But when we do not cease to sin,
and when we add sin to sin, is it not in the highest degree just that
the earth should become barren and unfruitful, in order that we may more
clearly perceive this curse, and that it may make a deeper impression on
our senses?

<span id="xiii.i-p90"></span>*And its inhabitants are made desolate.* I
think that <span id="xiii.i-p90.1"></span>אשם (ā*shăm*) here means “to
make desolate,” rather than “to forsake;” and this is apparent from the
context, on which account I have translated it “are made desolate.” But
perhaps it will be thought preferable to take the copulative <span
id="xiii.i-p90.2"></span>ו (*vau*) as signifying *because*, and then the
meaning will be, “The earth accursed by God is burnt up, *because* its
inhabitants have acted wickedly.”  <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md)

<span id="xiii.i-p92"></span>*Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are
burned, and few men left.* The word <span id="xiii.i-p92.1"></span>חרו
(*charu*) may be taken metaphorically, and I prefer this view of it,
which makes the meaning to be, that those whom the wrath of God has
consumed are burned up; because the destruction is compared to a
conflagration. When he adds, “that few will be left,” we learn from it
that this prediction cannot be explained as relating to the last day of
judgment, and that, on the contrary, the Prophet foretells and confirms
those desolations which threatened various nations, and that he does so
in order that the godly may fear, and may be led to repentance, and may
be prepared for enduring all things.

<span id="xiii.i-p93"></span><span id="xiii.i-p93.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p94"></span>**7.** *The wine hath failed.* The same
subject is continued, and the Prophet threatens chiefly against the Jews
the desolation of the land. He gives a long description in order to
affect them more deeply, and impress them with a conviction of the
judgment of God. Their luxury, intemperance, and feasting, are rapidly
surveyed, because amidst so great abundance they proudly disobeyed God.
Such ingratitude was not peculiar to the Jews or to that age, but it is
universally found that they who enjoy abundance rebel against God, and
indulge themselves too freely. On this account the Prophet censures
them; as if he had said, “Hitherto you have been plunged in luxuries and
pleasures, but the Lord will cause you to lead a very different kind of
life.” Isaiah speaks of the future as if it had been present, in order
to place it more clearly before their eyes.

<span id="xiii.i-p95"></span><span id="xiii.i-p95.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p96"></span>**9.** *They shall not drink wine with a
song.* To drink wine is not in itself evil, because God has appointed it
for the use of man; but here the Prophet describes the banquets of
drunkards, which were full of licentiousness, songs, and insolence.
Again, because they abused their enjoyment of plenty, he threatens them
with want, which men almost bring upon themselves, when by their luxury
they turn to a bad use the goodness of God.

<span id="xiii.i-p97"></span>*Strong drink shall be bitter.* He adds,
that if they drink wine, it will be “bitter” to them; because sorrow
commonly deprives men of a relish both for what they eat and for what
they drink. The meaning may be thus summed up, “Though they have
abundance of wine, yet they will be deprived of the use of it, because
they will feel such sorrow as shall take away all relish for it.”
“Strong drink shall be *bitter*;” that is, you shall no longer enjoy
those pleasures and delights in which you have hitherto indulged.

<span id="xiii.i-p98"></span><span id="xiii.i-p98.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p99"></span>**10.** *The city of*  <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) *vanity is broken down.* I do not
object to viewing this as relating especially to the desolation of
Jerusalem. Yet it may be gathered from the context that it applies also
to other cities; for shortly afterwards he uses the plural number in
summoning the nations to appear before the same tribunal. But as the
Prophet had his own countrymen chiefly in view, we may properly consider
it to denote Jerusalem, which he calls “the city of vanity,” either
because there was no solid virtue in it, or because it was destroyed.

<span id="xiii.i-p101"></span>The word <span
id="xiii.i-p101.1"></span>תהו (*tōhū*) may refer either to the
destruction itself, or to their crimes, by which they provoked the wrath
of God against them. If it be thought better to refer it to their
crimes, it will denote “the city of confusion,” in which nothing is
regular or properly arranged; and I approve of this interpretation. Yet
it may refer to the punishment; for it declares, in my opinion, the
cause of the destruction, and gives up the city to ruin, because justice
and good government are banished from it.

<span id="xiii.i-p102"></span>*Every house is shut up.* This is a proof
of solitude, and the only reason why it is added is, to express the
desolation of that city.

<span id="xiii.i-p103"></span><span id="xiii.i-p103.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p104"></span>**11.** *There is a cry about wine.* He
means, that there will be a scarcity of wine; for where want or hunger
is found, it is accompanied by unceasing complaints, not only in
private, but “in the streets” and public places. He therefore points out
those doleful sounds and complaints, but, at the same time, reproves
their luxury and intemperance, because they were not satisfied with what
was necessary, but greedily swallowed wine, and abandoned themselves to
every kind of enjoyment. We must supply the contrast. “Hitherto you have
had abundance of wine and of food, and you have taken occasion from it
to grow insolent against God; and therefore you will justly be deprived
of them, and, instead of your wanton indulgence, wailing and
lamentations will be heard in the streets.”

<span id="xiii.i-p105"></span>*All joy is darkened.* The metaphor in
this second clause deserves attention; for, as we say that joy brightens
when it obtains its object, so the Prophet here says, that “joy is
darkened,” because sorrow may be said to be a cloud drawn over it. To
*rejoice* is not in itself evil, any more than to drink; and the Prophet
does not censure joy simply considered, but excessive and immoderate
mirth. When men are merry, they lay no restraint on themselves on
account of that dissoluteness or love of disorder (<span
id="xiii.i-p105.1"></span>ἀταξίαν) which is natural to them. The Jews,
having behaved insolently and lived luxuriously, are deservedly
threatened with the vengeance of God, because most justly is joy taken
from us when we know not how to make a right use of the Lord’s benefits,
or to rejoice in him. It thus becomes necessary that he should take away
our pleasures and delights, and compel us to sigh and groan.

<span id="xiii.i-p106"></span><span id="xiii.i-p106.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p107"></span>**12.** *In the city is left desolation.*
By an elegant mode of expression he describes the desolation of
Jerusalem or of many other cities. The ornament and perfection of cities
consists of men; and therefore, when their inhabitants have been
removed, cities are said to be deserted. The Prophet says ironically,
that “ruin” will be left; but the word <span
id="xiii.i-p107.1"></span>שמה (*shămmăh*) is rendered by others
*desolation*, which amounts to the same thing.

<span id="xiii.i-p108"></span>*And the gate is smitten with desolation.*
He mentions the *gates*, because in them the crowded population of the
city was seen, for there the people assembled, and there the courts of
justice were held. At first, therefore, he mentions the whole city, and
next he names one part of it, but for the purpose of setting the matter
in a stronger light; for although cities be deprived of their
inhabitants, yet some are to be seen in the gates; but if the gates be
altogether empty, there must be grievous solitude in the whole city.

<span id="xiii.i-p109"></span><span id="xiii.i-p109.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p110"></span>**13.** *For it shall be in the midst of
the land.* As this statement is inserted between the threatenings and
the consolation, the Prophet appears to address the chosen people, and
not all the nations indiscriminately; if we do not rather say that he
describes the dispersion, by which the Jews were divided, as it were,
into many nations. But this being a harsh and forced interpretation, I
interpret it as simply meaning that some hope is left to the ruined
nations, and certainly this prediction applies strictly to the kingdom
of Christ; and therefore we need not wonder that some part of the
salvation is also promised to the Gentiles.

<span id="xiii.i-p111"></span>*As the shaking of an olive-tree.* The
Prophet has elsewhere used the same metaphor, but it was when he spoke
of the Church alone. (<span id="xiii.i-p111.1"></span>[Isa.
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#005.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#006)<span id="xiii.i-p111.1"></span>..md)
On that occasion he said that some seed of God would be left, that
believers might not think that the Church was utterly ruined; for when
“the olives are shaken,” still a few olives are left, and some grapes
after the vintage; and in like manner, after the terrible destruction
which shall fall upon the Church, a small number of the godly will be
left. But now he extends the same promise to other parts of the world,
as they were to become partakers of the same grace through Christ. Yet
there is still a mixture of threatening; as if he had said, that the
earth will be deprived of its inhabitants in exactly the same manner as
the trees and vines are stripped of their fruits.

<span id="xiii.i-p112"></span><span id="xiii.i-p112.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p113"></span>**14.** *They shall lift up their voice.*
He follows out and increases the consolations which he had briefly
sketched; for, having formerly (<span id="xiii.i-p113.1"></span>[Isa
10:19-22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#019.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p113.1"></span>) said that, out of that vast multitude, a few
drops would be left, which would nevertheless overflow the whole world,
in like manner he now says, that the small number of the godly, which
shall be left out of an abundant vintage, will nevertheless rejoice and
utter a voice so loud that it will be heard in the most distant
countries. This was done by the preaching of the gospel; for, as to the
condition of Judea, it appeared to be entirely ruined by it: the
national government was taken away, and they were broken down by foreign
and civil wars in such a manner that they never could rise above them.
The rest of the world was dumb in singing the praises of God, and deaf
to hear his voice; but as the Jews were the first fruits, I shall
willingly admit that they are here placed in the highest rank.

<span id="xiii.i-p114"></span>Hence we obtain a remarkable consolation,
that the Lord can in a moment restore his Church, and make it most
flourishing; or rather, he can, as it were, create it out of nothing;
for even out of death, as we have seen, he brings life. Now, this is
contrary to nature and to ordinary custom, that so small a number of
persons should lift up their voice, and be heard in distant places; for
where there are few persons, there is silence, and where there is a
crowd, there is commonly a noise. It is therefore a work of God, which
goes beyond the course of nature and the ability of men; for otherwise
it would appear as if the Prophet uttered what was contradictory, that
when the whole of Judea had been laid waste and the world had been
emptied, there would be few or almost none left, and yet that their
shouting would be heard everywhere. This is in itself incredible, or
rather absurd; but, as we have already said, it is an astonishing work
of God.

<span id="xiii.i-p115"></span>*They shall cry aloud from the sea.* By
those heralds he means not only those who were the descendants of the
Jews according to the flesh, but those who were descended from them by
faith. The *crying aloud* denotes not only cheerful voices, expressive
of gladness and joy, but likewise confidence; for they will freely and
boldly utter with a loud voice the praises of God. He states, at the
same time, that it is right that believers should be employed in
extolling God’s perfections and not their own claims to approbation. By
*the sea*, he obviously means distant countries, and those which lay
beyond the sea and were unknown to the Jews.

<span id="xiii.i-p116"></span><span id="xiii.i-p116.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p117"></span>**15.** *Wherefore glorify Jehovah in the
valleys.*  <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) God’s benefits ought
to excite us to gratitude, and we testify it by singing his praises.
“What return shall we make,” as David says, “for all the benefits which
he has bestowed on us, but to take the cup of thanksgiving for
salvation, and call on the name of the Lord?” The Prophet therefore
observes this order; having spoken of the restoration of the Church, he
exhorts us to offer the sacrifice of praise.

<span id="xiii.i-p119"></span>By *the valleys*, he means countries that
are hidden and, as it were, separated from others; for those which are
surrounded by mountains are separated and disjoined by nature. The
consequence is, that the inhabitants of valleys are less civilized,
because they have fewer opportunities of conversing with each other. The
meaning is the same as if the Prophet had said, that there will not be a
corner so obscure or retired that the praises of God shall not be heard
in it.

<span id="xiii.i-p120"></span>*The name of Jehovah the God of Israel.*
He uses the expression, “the name of the God of Israel,” in order to
intimate that all nations will call upon the true God; for, as all
nations have a knowledge of God that is natural to them, so all easily
turn aside to superstition and false worship. (<span
id="xiii.i-p120.1"></span>[Ro
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#019)<span id="xiii.i-p120.1"></span>..md)
But here he speaks of spreading the true religion through the whole
world; and this makes it still more evident that the prophecy relates to
the kingdom of Christ, under which true religion has at length
penetrated into foreign and heathen nations.

<span id="xiii.i-p121"></span><span id="xiii.i-p121.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p122"></span>**16.** *From the uttermost part*  <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) *of the earth.* This verse contains
two statements which have some appearance of being at variance with each
other. It begins with a joyful description of the praises of God, and
next passes on to complaints and lamentations, in which he bewails the
treachery of transgressors, who overturn religion and godliness. So far
as relates to praises, we have said that we can neither praise God nor
call upon him, till he reveal himself to us, and give a taste of his
goodness, that we may entertain hope and confident expectation of life.
Hence those sayings of David,

<span id="xiii.i-p124"></span>“In the grave who shall praise thee, O
Lord?  
In death who shall confess to thee?” (<span
id="xiii.i-p124.2"></span>[Ps 6:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa006.htm#005.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p124.2"></span>.)

<span id="xiii.i-p125"></span>When we feel nothing but the wrath of God,
we are dumb to his praises; and therefore when he says that the praises
of God will be heard, he means that the gospel will be spread through
the whole world; that men may acknowledge God to be their Father, and
may thus break forth into his praise. “From the uttermost part” is a
phrase that deserves attention; for at that time the praises of God were
confined to Judea, and were not heard at a distance; but afterwards they
began to resound everywhere. (<span id="xiii.i-p125.1"></span>[Ps.
76:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002)<span id="xiii.i-p125.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xiii.i-p126"></span>*Glory to the righteous.* Some consider
this to be spoken by all believers, as if the song were, “God is
glorified on account of his righteousness.” Others read the two clauses
as one, “We have heard that glory is given to the righteous God.” Those
who think that the heralds of God’s praises are called “righteous,”
bring out a very good sense, but do not attend to the word “Glory,” or
at least are constrained to render the word <span
id="xiii.i-p126.1"></span>צבי (*tzēbī*) *joy.*  <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) He makes use of the preterite, “We
have heard,” instead of the future tense; and his reason for doing so
is, that he intended to cheer the hearts of the godly by some
consolation; “We shall again hear the praises of God;” for this is more
than if he had said, “They will be heard.” He speaks also in the first
person, in order to include the whole body of the Church, and thus to
awaken the attention of the godly.

<span id="xiii.i-p128"></span>God is called *righteous*; and we know
that this expression frequently occurs in Scripture, but it belongs to
him in a different manner from that in which it belongs to men; for men
are called “righteous,” on account of the “righteousness” which has been
communicated to them; but God, who is the fountain of righteousness, is
called “righteous,” on account of what he performs. (<span
id="xiii.i-p128.1"></span>[De
32:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#004.md)<span id="xiii.i-p128.1"></span>;
<span id="xiii.i-p128.2"></span>[Ps.
7:9](../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#009.md), [Ps.
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa011.htm#007)<span id="xiii.i-p128.2"></span>..md)
And that is a proof of this congratulation and thanksgiving, because
from the communication of this righteousness we obtain salvation and
life; and therefore, wherever the righteousness of God is, it must be
followed by praises and thanksgivings.

<span id="xiii.i-p129"></span>When the Prophet predicted these things,
how incredible might they appear to be! for among the Jews alone was the
Lord known and praised. (<span id="xiii.i-p129.1"></span>[Ps
76:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002)<span id="xiii.i-p129.1"></span>..md)
To them destruction is foretold, and next the publication of the word,
and the celebration of the praises of God; but how could these things be
done, when the people of God had been destroyed? Hence we may infer that
there were few who believed these predictions. But now that those events
have taken place, it is our duty to behold with admiration so great a
miracle of God, because, when the Jews had been not only broken down,
but almost annihilated, still there flashed from them a spark by which
the whole world was enlightened, and all who were kindled by it burst
forth into a confession of the truth.

<span id="xiii.i-p130"></span>*My leanness.*  <span
id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) This passage is explained in various
ways; for some translate <span id="xiii.i-p131.1"></span> רזי*(rāzī*)
*secret*, and others *leanness*. Those who translate it *secret*
understand the Prophet to mean that a double secret has been revealed to
him, because the Lord has determined to reward the good and to punish
the wicked; for when men look only at the outward appearance of things,
and see that the wicked succeed to their wish, and that the godly are
overwhelmed by afflictions, they are distressed, and doubt whether the
affairs of men are governed by the hand of God, or all things happen by
chance; and Solomon shews that thoughts of this kind are the seed of
ungodliness. (<span id="xiii.i-p131.2"></span>[Ec
8:11](../../../bib/kjv/ecc008.htm#011)<span id="xiii.i-p131.2"></span>..md)
On this account the Psalmist also says, that he “entered into the
sanctuary of God,” that he might examine the subject in another manner
than by human reason. (<span id="xiii.i-p131.3"></span>[Ps
73:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa073.htm#017.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p131.3"></span>.) If we adopt that interpretation, the
meaning will be, “Though it appear as if there were no reward to the
righteous, yet I hold this as a secret imparted to me, that it will be
well with them; and although the wicked think that they will escape, yet
I know that they will not pass unpunished.” But as this ingenuity
appears to be too far-fetched, I prefer a more simple interpretation;
and, besides, there immediately follows an interjection expressive of
lamentation, <span id="xiii.i-p131.4"></span>אוי, (ōī,) *Wo!* so that I
do not think that Isaiah speaks here about the righteous or about their
reward.

<span id="xiii.i-p132"></span>Others more correctly explain it
*leanness*; as if he had said, that through grief he shrinks and grows
lean; for as the prosperous and flourishing condition of that people
might be called “fatness,” so its wretched and distressed condition
might be called “leanness.” Here the Prophet stands forth as the
representative of the whole race; and when the Lord cuts it down, he
justly complains of his “leanness.” This interpretation, I have said, is
probable; for when the Prophet saw the people diminishing in numbers, he
had good reason for bewailing that diminution. We know that, when the
grace of God was very abundantly poured out, the ancient people was
greatly diminished, and the posterity of Abraham was almost annihilated.

<span id="xiii.i-p133"></span>But we must see if the Prophet does not
look farther than to the rejection of his nation, so as to bewail the
condition of his bowels, when he foresees that the Church will be
heavily distressed; for <span id="xiii.i-p133.1"></span>רז (*rāz*,)
which some translate *secret*, may properly be understood to denote the
internal part of the body. In this way the exclamation would be, “My
bowels, or my entrails, are pained;” for in a pathetic discourse there
is no absurdity in supposing that a word is supplied. When the Lord has
extended his Church, it appears to be in a flourishing state, and free
from all danger; but when its very inwards or bowels, that is, its own
members, give it uneasiness, it is grievously tormented. Hypocrites
arise, by whom it is more annoyed than by enemies who “are without.”
(<span id="xiii.i-p133.2"></span>[Re
22:15](../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#015.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p133.2"></span>.)

<span id="xiii.i-p134"></span>Such is also the import of those
groanings, <span id="xiii.i-p134.1"></span>אוי, (ōī,) *wo to* *me*; and
Isaiah, I have no doubt, intended to intimate that the godly should not
think that they will be happy in this world, but should believe that
they must maintain a continual strife, even when they might imagine that
there is nothing to hinder them from enjoying uninterrupted tranquillity
and peace. He wishes to express the feeling of poignant grief which
torments the Church inwardly, even in her very bowels; and this
affliction is the more deeply to be lamented, because it cannot be
avoided; for, as some one says, the Church can neither flee from
internal and domestic enemies, nor put them to flight. Isaiah can
scarcely find terms adequate to express this miserly

<span id="xiii.i-p135"></span>*The treacherous dealers have dealt
treacherously.* These words abundantly confirm the expositions which
have been already given. How heavy this affliction is, and how deeply it
ought to be deplored, we ourselves have abundantly experienced, and
still experience every day. Whence arose Popery, and all its corruption,
but from this internal evil? for it was an imposthume (<span
id="xiii.i-p135.1"></span>ἀπόστημα) bred in the very bowels of the
Church, which sent forth offensive and diseased matter. How comes it
also that, when the Church begins to revive, we see doctrine corrupted
and discipline overturned not only by the common people, but by those
who ought to have given a good example to others? Is it not because the
Church is always subject to this evil?

<span id="xiii.i-p136"></span><span id="xiii.i-p136.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p137"></span>**17** *Fear, and the pit, and the snare.*
The Prophet here discourses against the sins of the people. Formerly he
declared that not only one nation, but very many and very distant
nations, would have abundant grounds of thanksgiving. He now passes to
another doctrine; for I think that these words ought to be separated
from what goes before, because Isaiah again threatens the wicked, that
they may know that amidst the highest prosperity of the Church they will
be miserable. For the sake of cherishing their indifference, wicked men
are accustomed rashly to apply the promises of God to themselves, though
they do not at all belong to them; and therefore the prophets usually
mingle threatenings with them. It is also possible that Isaiah delivered
this discourse separately from the rest, and on a different occasion;
for neither the prophets themselves nor other learned men divided the
chapters. We have often seen different subjects joined together, and
others divided which ought to have been joined, which was undoubtedly
done through ignorance. However that may be, the Prophet returns to the
wicked, and threatens against them severe and dreadful judgment.

<span id="xiii.i-p138"></span>This description of “fear, the pit, and
the snare,” is intended to touch the feelings; for if he had said, in a
single word, that destruction awaits the wicked, they would not have
been greatly moved. But there is room for doubting if he addresses the
Jews alone. For my own part, I should not be much inclined to dispute
about this matter; but I think it is more probable that these
threatenings related also to other nations, and even to the whole world,
of which he had formally prophesied.

<span id="xiii.i-p139"></span>*O inhabitant of the earth.* By “the
world” we understand those countries which were known to the Jews, as we
have already explained. The meaning is, “Thou art pressed by afflictions
so diversified, that thou hast no means of escape.” Amos gives a similar
description: “He who shall flee through dread of a lion shall meet a
bear; and if he go into the house, when he leaneth on a wall, a serpent
shall bite him.” (<span id="xiii.i-p139.1"></span>[Am
5:19](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#019)<span id="xiii.i-p139.1"></span>..md)
Isaiah formerly said that lions would be sent against the Moabites who
had escaped from the battle. (<span id="xiii.i-p139.2"></span>[Isa
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa015.htm#009)<span id="xiii.i-p139.2"></span>..md)
God has an endless variety of scourges for punishing the wicked. It is
as if he had said, “Know that you cannot escape the hand of God; for he
has various methods by which he takes vengeance on their crimes, and
thus overtakes those who had hoped to escape by a variety of
contrivances. He who escapes from the battle shall be tormented with
hunger; and when he is freed from hunger, he will meet some other
calamity, as if nets had been laid on all sides to ensnare you.”

<span id="xiii.i-p140"></span>*For the windows from on high are open,
and the foundations of the earth are shaken.* This argument confirms
what had been already said, that it is impossible for them to escape the
vengeance of God, who has prepared for it a free course in heaven and in
earth, from the utmost height of heaven down to the depths of the earth.
Some think that he alludes (<span id="xiii.i-p140.1"></span>[Ge
7:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen007.htm#011)<span id="xiii.i-p140.1"></span>.md)
to the deluge; but, in my opinion, the meaning is simpler, that the
wrath of God will be revealed above and below; as if he had said, “The
Lord will arm heaven and earth to execute his vengeance against men,
that wherever they turn their eyes, they may behold nothing but
destruction.”

<span id="xiii.i-p141"></span><span id="xiii.i-p141.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p142"></span>**19.** *By breaking down is the earth
broken down.* He heightens his description of punishments by using
various modes of expression. A little afterwards he will point out the
cause of this “shaking,” which is, that men by their sins had drawn down
on themselves such destruction. He now declares that this evil is
incurable. We have formerly said that the Prophet explains the same
thing in various ways, and for the purpose of striking and arousing
those minds which are naturally very sluggish; for there is in the flesh
a carelessness which produces contempt of God, and we have too much
experience of it both in ourselves and in others. In order, therefore,
that the prophets might arouse those who were careless and asleep in
their vices, they adorn their style; not because they cared about being
thought eloquent, but that they might make their hearers more attentive,
and sting them to the quick. Hence the allusions of which these verses
are full; hence the brilliant metaphors in the style; hence the
threatenings and terrors announced in various ways; the object of all
is, that careless men may be aroused.

<span id="xiii.i-p143"></span>Now, this doctrine ought to be limited to
the wicked; not because the godly are exempted from those evils, for
they are afflicted as well as other men; but because, when the godly
betake themselves to God, and rely wholly upon him, they are not shaken
in this manner, and remain firm and steadfast against every assault;
while wicked men, who despised the judgments of God, and took unbounded
liberties in transgression, are terrified and alarmed, and never find
rest.

<span id="xiii.i-p144"></span><span id="xiii.i-p144.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p145"></span>**20.** *And shall be removed like a
tent.* This does not mean that any change will take place in the
position of the earth; but these words, as we have already said, must be
referred to men; as if he had said, that there would be no kingly power
and no regular government. In short, he intended to describe those
changes which he had spoken of in the tenth chapter.

<span id="xiii.i-p146"></span>*And the transgressions thereof shall be
heavy upon it.* When he says that “the earth is laden with its
iniquity,” he has very appropriately assigned this reason, that we may
understand that God is never angry with men without a cause; for we
ourselves are the authors of all the evils which we suffer. God is by
nature disposed to kindness, and regards us with a father’s love; and
therefore it is our own fault that we are treated with sharpness and
severity, and we have no reason to blame him.  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md)

<span id="xiii.i-p148"></span>*And it shall fall, and not rise again.*
He at length repeats what he briefly stated a little before, that there
will be no remedy for those evils. Some think that this relates to the
Jews, whose form of government was entirely taken away, so that they
were broken down and scattered, and were scarcely reckoned in the rank
of men. But I give a more extensive interpretation, that the distresses
of the world will be so severe, that it cannot be restored to its
original condition. Men always contend against adverse events, and their
minds are full of confidence. Having endured calamities, they think that
there will be some room for breathing, and their minds are swelled with
false hopes, which the Prophet therefore takes away, that they may not
in future deceive themselves by unfounded expectation. Yet it ought to
be observed, that this general statement does not set aside the
exception which Isaiah formerly made.

<span id="xiii.i-p149"></span><span id="xiii.i-p149.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p150"></span>**21.** *And it shall come to pass.* This
passage has tortured the minds of many commentators, and various
interpretations have been offered by various writers. Some think that
this relates to the sun and the stars, and others, that it relates to
the devils, who will be punished along with the wicked. Others refer it
to the Jews, on whom God had bestowed a remarkable privilege. But I
cannot adopt any of those interpretations.  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) The simple and genuine meaning,
therefore, appears to me to be, that no power will be so high as to be
exempted from those scourges of God; and though they raise themselves
above the clouds, yet the hand of God will reach them; as it is said in
the Psalm,

<span id="xiii.i-p152"></span>“Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? and
whither shall I flee from thy face? If I ascend into heaven, thou art
there; if I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
parts of the sea, there also shall thy hand pursue me.” <span
id="xiii.i-p152.1"></span>[Ps
139:7-10](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p152.1"></span>.

<span id="xiii.i-p153"></span>*Jehovah will visit upon the army on
high.*  <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) This is a metaphor by
which he denotes kings and princes, who shine and sparkle in the world
like stars; and he afterwards explains this metaphor in direct language,
by adding *upon the kings of the earth*; for I do not think that they
ought to be separated, as if he were speaking of different subjects, but
that there is a repetition of the same statement, so that the latter
clause explains the former. But perhaps it will be thought preferable to
explain it thus: “he will visit on the kingdoms of the earth,” even on
those things which appear to surpass the rank of men; for some things
rise so much above others, that they appear as if they did not belong to
the ordinary rank. The word *visit* must relate to punishment, as even
the context shews plainly enough.

<span id="xiii.i-p155"></span><span id="xiii.i-p155.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p156"></span>**22.** *And they shall be gathered
together, and shall be shut up in prison.* He continues his subject in
the beginning of the verse. The mode of expression is metaphorical; for
they were not all captives, but God reduced them to servitude, as if a
man held in his hand the enemies whom he subdued. He therefore brings
forward God as a conqueror, who shuts up enemies in prison, as captives
are commonly shut up. We know that men, as it were, flee from God, and
despise him, so long as he spares them, and exercises any forbearance
towards them; and on this account also he threatens that they shall be
thrown into prison in large masses, that they may not solace themselves
with their multitude.

<span id="xiii.i-p157"></span>*Afterwards they shall be visited.* When
he adds that after a time “they shall be visited,” it is not simply a
promise, but includes also a threatening to this effect, “As formerly by
their obstinacy they mocked God, and excessively prolonged the time of
sinning, so God will punish without making haste, till at length, though
late, they acknowledge the cause of their distresses.” Thus earthly
judges frequently do not deign to admit into their presence the
malefactors who have offended them, but plunge them into darkness and
filth, and gradually wear them out, in order to subdue their obstinacy.
Again, as there are two ways in which God visits the world, either when
he punishes the wicked, or when he shews to the elect the tokens of a
Father’s kindness, the word *visit* here signifies “to look upon;” and
thus the Prophet softens the harshness of the threatening. It was
necessary that the hearts of the godly should be supported amidst these
distresses, that they might not faint; and on their account, therefore,
after various threatenings, the prophets are wont to add consolations.
As these statements tended to support believers, they were undoubtedly
addressed to the Jews, among whom chiefly faith was found, or rather,
there was none to be seen anywhere else.

<span id="xiii.i-p158"></span>*After many days.* This also deserves
attention. It was intended to try the faith of the godly;  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) for we are hasty in our desires, and
would wish that God should immediately perform his promises: we complain
that he is slow, and we cannot brook any delay. It is therefore our duty
to wait patiently for that mercy; and no delay, however long, should
make us lose heart. Yet it ought also to be observed, that this does not
refer to all; for, as we saw a little before, God had determined to save
but a small remnant; and this ought to quicken us the more, that, being
humbled by slow and long-continued punishments, we may meet God who
visits us.

<span id="xiii.i-p160"></span><span id="xiii.i-p160.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p161"></span>**23.** *The moon shall be confounded.*
Many commentators think that the Prophet waxes still more wroth against
the Jews, so far as to say, that the sun and moon and stars are ashamed
of their unbelief, and that not only men, but creatures devoid of
speech, will abhor them; but this appears to be far removed from the
meaning and design of the Prophet. I have no doubt that he continues to
give the consolation which he had glanced at in the former verse; “When
the Lord shall visit his people, and cleanse the Church from its
defilement, he will establish a kingdom so illustrious that it will
darken the sun and stars by its brightness.” This mode of expression is
frequently employed by the prophets, and we have formerly seen it.
Since, therefore, God will establish your kingdom on Mount Zion, so
great will be its splendor in the restoration of the people, that those
things which dazzle the eyes of men, will be dark in comparison of it;
and, for the purpose of expressing this, he has mentioned those objects
which surpass all others in brightness.

<span id="xiii.i-p162"></span>*When the Lord of hosts shall reign in
Mount Zion.* Some think that the word *reign* denotes God’s vengeance;
but this is inaccurate, for although the Lord is said to reign when he
discharges the office of a Judge, yet the complex phrase, “the reign of
God in Mount Zion,” always denotes mercy and salvation. He speaks of the
restoration of the Church, and hence it follows, that it is only in
Christ that those things are fulfilled.

<span id="xiii.i-p163"></span>*And before his elders glory.* By
expressly mentioning the “elders,” he employs a figure of speech
frequently used in Scripture, by which the chief part of the Church is
taken for the whole body of it. And yet it is not without a special
design that he denotes, by the term “elders,” not only the priests, but
other governors who preside over discipline and morals, and by whose
moderation and prudence others ought to be guided. Under their name he
includes the whole nation, not only because they represent the whole
body, and because the common people are in some measure concealed under
their shadow, but likewise that believers may entertain hope of future
restoration; for otherwise it would have been of little or no avail that
a scattered multitude should be left like a mutilated body or a confused
mass. Not without good reason did he use the phrase, “and before his
elders,” that the Jews might know that the power of God would be visibly
and strikingly displayed; not that it can be perceived by the bodily
senses, but by faith. He reigns in such a manner, that we feel that he
is present with us; and if we did not comprehend this, it would yield us
no consolation.

<span id="xiii.i-p164"></span>*Glory.*  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) Instead of “glory” some read
“gloriously,” and others, “glorious.” I prefer to take it simply as a
substantive, though there is little difference in the meaning. He shews
how great will be the splendor and glory of God, when the kingdom of
Christ shall be established, because all that is brilliant must be
obscured, and the glory of Christ alone must hold a high and prominent
place. Hence it follows, that then only does God receive his just
rights, and the honor due to him, when all creatures are placed in
subjection, and he alone shines before our eyes.

<span id="xiii.i-p61"></span> FT386 There is a considerable diversity of
opinion about the application of the term *righteous* in this passage.
Many commentators agree with Calvin in thinking that God is here called
*righteous*. Bishop Stock has slightly modified this view by applying
the designation to the Messiah. “By the righteous,” says he, “is
probably meant one person the Messiah, (see <span
id="xiii.i-p61.1"></span>[Acts 7:52](../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#052.md),
[Acts 22:14](../../../bib/kjv/act022.htm#014.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p61.1"></span>,) whose kingdom the Prophet beholds in vision,
and joins in the chorus of joy at its approach; a joy, however, which is
presently interrupted by a reflection on the wickedness of the greater
part of his countrymen at that time, who should reject the Lord that
bought them. Therefore he saith, Woe is me! destruction shall overtake
the inhabitants of the land.” Instead of “Glory to the righteous,” the
Septuagint renders it, <span id="xiii.i-p61.2"></span>ἐλπὶς τῶ εὐσεβεῖ,
“hope to the godly man.” Professor Alexander’s rendering is, “Praise to
the righteous;” and he remarks, <span id="xiii.i-p61.3"></span>צדיק

<span id="xiii.i-p64"></span> FT389 “Interpreters have commonly assumed
that ‘the host of the high place’ is the same with the ‘host of heaven,’
and must therefore mean either stars (Jerome), or angels (Aben Ezra), or
both (Gesenius). Grotius understands by it the images of the heavenly
bodies worshipped in Assyria. Gesenius finds here an allusion to the
punishment of fallen angels, and then makes this a proof of recent
origin, because the Jewish demonology was later than the time of Isaiah.
It may be doubted whether there is any reference to the hosts of heaven
at all.” — *Alexander*
