<span id="xviii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 29

<span id="xviii.i"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p1"></span><span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>[Isaiah
29:1-24](../../../bib/kjv/isa029.htm#001.md)<span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city
*where* David dwelt! add ye year to year; let them kill sacrifices.

<span id="xviii.i-p3"></span>1. Heus Ariel, Ariel, urbs quam incoluit
David. Addite annum ad annum, quibus jugulentur agni.

<span id="xviii.i-p4"></span>**2.** Yet I will distress Ariel, and there
shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.

<span id="xviii.i-p5"></span>2. Atqui in angustum redigam Ariel, et erit
mœror et tristitia, eritque mihi tanquam Ariel.

<span id="xviii.i-p6"></span>**3.** And I will camp against thee round
about, and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise
forts against thee.

<span id="xviii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Et castrametabor adversum te in
circuitu, et oppugnabo te in statione, et erigam contra te aggeres.

<span id="xviii.i-p8"></span>**4.** And thou shalt be brought down,
*and* shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of
the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit,
out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.

<span id="xviii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Tum humiliaberis, e terra loqueris,
et e pulvere exibit eloquium tuum, et erit quasi Pythonis e terra vox
tua, et e pulvere eloquium tuum mussitabit.

<span id="xviii.i-p10"></span>**5.** Moreover, the multitude of thy
strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible
ones *shall be* as chaff that passeth away; yea, it shall be at an
instant suddenly.

<span id="xviii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et erit quasi pulvisculus sonitus
extraneorum tuorum, et quasi stipula transiens multitudo fortium, et
erit ad momentum repente.

<span id="xviii.i-p12"></span>**6.** Thou shalt be visited of the Lord
of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm
and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.

<span id="xviii.i-p13"></span>**6.** Ab Iehova exercituum visitaberis,
in tonitru, et tumultu, et fragore magno, in turbine, et tempestate, et
flamma ignis vorantis.

<span id="xviii.i-p14"></span>**7.** And the multitude of all the
nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and
her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a
night-vision.

<span id="xviii.i-p15"></span>**7.** Et erit quasi somnium visionis
nocturnæ multitudo omnium gentium pugnantium adversus Ariel; omnis,
inquam, pugnantis, et munitiones erigentis in eam, et constringentium
eam.

<span id="xviii.i-p16"></span>**8.** It shall even be as when an hungry
*man* dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is
empty; or as when a thirsty *man* dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh;
but he awaketh, and, behold, *he is* faint, and his soul hath appetite:
so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against mount
Zion.

<span id="xviii.i-p17"></span>**8.** Fiet ergo quemadmodum famelicus
somniat, et ecce comedit; cum autem evigilat, inanis est anima ejus; et
quemadmodum sitiens somniat, et ecce bibit; cum autem evigilat, lassus
est, et anima ejus appetens; sic erit multitudo omnium gentium
pugnantium adversus montem Sion.

<span id="xviii.i-p18"></span>**9.** Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye
out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not
with strong drink.

<span id="xviii.i-p19"></span>**9.** Immoremini, et admiremini. Excæcati
sunt et excæcant; ebrii sunt, et non vino; concussi sunt, et non sicera.

<span id="xviii.i-p20"></span>**10.** For the Lord hath poured out upon
you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets
and your rulers, the seers hath he covered.

<span id="xviii.i-p21"></span>**10.** Quia obtexit super vos Iehova
spiritu soporis, obstruxit oculos vestros: Prophetas vestros et
præcipuos Videntes caligine obduxit.

<span id="xviii.i-p22"></span>**11.** And the vision of all is become
unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which *men* deliver to
one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I
cannot; for it *is* sealed.

<span id="xviii.i-p23"></span>**11.** Itaque facta est vobis omnis visio
quasi verba libri obsignati; quem si tradant scienti literas, ac dicant,
Lege, quæso, in eo; tum dicet, Non possum, quia est obsignatus:

<span id="xviii.i-p24"></span>**12.** And the book is delivered to him
that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am
not learned.

<span id="xviii.i-p25"></span>**12.** Quod si detur ei liber qui non
didicit literas, ac dicatur, Lege, quæso, in eo; tum dicet, Nescio
literas.

<span id="xviii.i-p26"></span>**13.** Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch
as this people draw near *me* with their mouth, and with their lips do
honour me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear
toward me is taught by the precept of men:

<span id="xviii.i-p27"></span>**13.** Ergo dicit Dominus: propterea quod
appropinquat populus iste ore suo, et labiis suis honorat me, ac cor
suum longè a me removit, et fuit timor eorum erga me præcepto hominum
doctus;

<span id="xviii.i-p28"></span>**14.** Therefore, behold, I will proceed
to do a marvellous work among this people, *even* a marvellous work and
a wonder; for the wisdom of their wise *men* shall perish, and the
understanding of their prudent *men* shall be hid.

<span id="xviii.i-p29"></span>**14.** Propterea ecce adjicio ut faciam
rem mirandam in populo hoc, miraculum, inquam, et portentum; nam peribit
sapienta sapientum ejus, et prudentia prudentum ejus evanescet.

<span id="xviii.i-p30"></span>**15.** Woe unto them that seek deep to
hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and
they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us.

<span id="xviii.i-p31"></span>**15.** Væ latitantibus ab Iehova, ut
abscondant consilium; nam sunt in tenebris opera eorum, ac dicunt, Quis
videt nos? et, Quis scit nos?

<span id="xviii.i-p32"></span>**16.** Surely your turning of things
upside down shall be esteemed as the potter’s clay: for shall the work
say of him that made it, He made me not? Or shall the thing framed say
of him that framed it, He had no understanding?

<span id="xviii.i-p33"></span>**16.** Vestra concersio an sicut lutum
figuli reputatur? nempe, dicit opus de auctore suo, Non fecit me; et
figmentum de fictore suo, Non intellexit?

<span id="xviii.i-p34"></span>**17.** *Is* it not yet a very little
while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the
fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?

<span id="xviii.i-p35"></span>**17.** Nonne adhuc paululum, paululum, et
redigetur Libanus in Carmelum, et Carmelus in sylvam reputabitur.

<span id="xviii.i-p36"></span>**18.** And in that day shall the deaf
hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of
obscurity, and out of darkness.

<span id="xviii.i-p37"></span>**18.** Et audient in die illa surdi verba
libri, et de caligine et tenebris oculi cæcorum videbunt.

<span id="xviii.i-p38"></span>**19.** The meek also shall increase
*their* joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the
Holy One of Israel.

<span id="xviii.i-p39"></span>**19.** Tunc repentent humiles in Iehova
lætitiam, et pauperes hominum exultabunt in Sancto Israelis.

<span id="xviii.i-p40"></span>**20.** For the terrible one is brought to
nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are
cut off:

<span id="xviii.i-p41"></span>**20.** Quoniam in nihilum redactus est
violentus, contemptus est derisor; perierunt qui manè festinabant ad
iniquitatem.

<span id="xviii.i-p42"></span>**21.** That make a man an offender for a
word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside
the just for a thing of nought.

<span id="xviii.i-p43"></span>**21.** Facientes hominem peccare in
verbo, qui arguentem in porta illaquearunt, et justum flexerunt ad
nihilum.

<span id="xviii.i-p44"></span>**22.** Therefor thus saith the Lord, who
redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be
ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.

<span id="xviii.i-p45"></span>**22.** Propterea sic dicit Iehova ad
domun Iacob, qui redemit Abraham: Non confundetur nunc Iacob, neque
pallescet nunc facies ejus.

<span id="xviii.i-p46"></span>**23.** But when he seeth his children,
the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my
name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of
Israel.

<span id="xviii.i-p47"></span>**23.** Nam ubi viderit natos suos, opus
manuum mearum, in medio sui, sanctificabunt nomen meum, sanctificabunt
Sanctum Iacob, Deum Israel timebunt.

<span id="xviii.i-p48"></span>**24.** They also that erred in spirit
shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn
doctrine.

<span id="xviii.i-p49"></span>**24.** Tum errantes spiritu discent
intelligentiam; et murmuratores discent doctrinam.

<span id="xviii.i-p50"></span> 

<span id="xviii.i-p51"></span><span id="xviii.i-p51.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p52"></span>**1.** This appears to be another
discourse, in which Isaiah threatens the city of Jerusalem. He calls it
“Altar,”  <span id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) because the chief
defense of the city was in the “Altar;”  <span
id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) for although the citizens relied on
other bulwarks, of which they had great abundance, still they placed
more reliance on the Temple (<span id="xviii.i-p69.1"></span>[Jer
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#004)<span id="xviii.i-p69.1"></span>.md)
and the altar than on the other defences. While they thought that they
were invincible in power and resources, they considered their strongest
and most invincible fortress to consist in their being defended by the
protection of God. They concluded that God was with them, so long as
they enjoyed the altar and the sacrifices. Some think that the temple is
here called “Ariel,” from the resemblance which it bore to the shape of
a lion, being broader in front and narrower behind; but I think it
better to take it simply as denoting “the Altar,” since Ezekiel also
(<span id="xviii.i-p69.2"></span>[Eze
43:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#015)<span id="xviii.i-p69.2"></span>.md)
gives it this name. This prediction is indeed directed against the whole
city, but we must look at the design of the Prophet; for he intended to
strip the Jews of their foolish confidence in imagining that God would
assist them, so long as the altar and the sacrifices could remain, in
which they falsely gloried, and thought that they had fully discharged
their duty, though their conduct was base and detestable.

<span id="xviii.i-p70"></span>*The city where David dwelt.* He now
proceeds to the city, which he dignifies with the commendation of its
high rank, on the ground of having been formerly inhabited by David, but
intending, by this admission, to scatter the smoke of their vanity. Some
understand by it the lesser Jerusalem, that is, the inner city, which
also was surrounded by a wall; for there was a sort of two-fold
Jerusalem, because it had increased, and had extended its walls beyond
where they originally stood; but I think that this passage must be
understood to relate to the whole city. He mentions *David*, because
they gloried in his name, and boasted that the blessing of God
continually dwelt in his palace; for the Lord had promised that “the
kingdom of David would be for ever.” (<span
id="xviii.i-p70.1"></span>[2Sa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#013.md)<span id="xviii.i-p70.1"></span>;
<span id="xviii.i-p70.2"></span>[Ps
89:37](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#037.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p70.2"></span>.)

<span id="xviii.i-p71"></span>Hence we may infer how absurdly the
Papists, in the present day, consider the Church to be bound to Peter’s
chair, as if God could nowhere find a habitation in the whole world but
in the See of Rome. We do not now dispute whether Peter was Bishop of
the Church of Rome or not; but though we should admit that this is fully
proved, was any promise made to Rome such as was made to Jerusalem?
“This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell, for I have chosen it.”
(<span id="xviii.i-p71.1"></span>[Ps
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p71.1"></span>.) And if even this were granted, do not we
see what Isaiah declares about Jerusalem? That God is driven from it,
when there is no room for doctrine, when the worship of God is
corrupted. What then shall be said of Rome, which has no testimony? Can
she boast of anything in preference to Jerusalem? If God pronounces a
curse on the most holy city, which he had chosen in an especial manner,
what must we say of the rest, who have overturned his holy laws and all
godly institutions.

<span id="xviii.i-p72"></span>*Add year to year.* This was added by the
Prophet, because the Jews thought that they had escaped punishment, when
any delay was granted to them. Wicked men think that God has made a
truce with them, when they see no destruction close at hand; and
therefore they promise to themselves unceasing prosperity, so long as
the Lord permits them to enjoy peace and quietness. In opposition to
this assurance of their safety the Prophet threatens that, though they
continue to “offer sacrifices,”  <span id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md)
and though they renew them year by year, still the Lord will execute his
vengeance. We ought to learn from this, that, when the Lord delays to
punish and to take vengeance, we ought not, on that account, to seize
the occasion for delaying our repentance; for although he spares and
bears with us for a time, our sin is not therefore blotted out, nor have
we any reason to promise that we shall make a truce with him. Let us not
then abuse his patience, but let us be more eager to obtain pardon.

<span id="xviii.i-p74"></span><span id="xviii.i-p74.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p75"></span>**2.** *But I will bring Ariel into
distress*. I think that <span id="xviii.i-p75.1"></span>ו (*vau*) should
here be taken for a disjunctive conjunction: “And yet I will execute my
judgments and take vengeance, though, by delaying them for a time, it
may seem as if I had forgiven.” He next threatens that he will give them
*grief* and *mourning*, instead of the joy of the festivals. <span
id="xviii.i-p75.2"></span>אניה (ă*nīāh*) is viewed by some as an
adjective,  <span id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md) but improperly; for
it is used in the same manner by Jeremiah.  <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) (<span id="xviii.i-p77.1"></span>[La
2:5](../../../bib/kjv/lam002.htm#005)<span id="xviii.i-p77.1"></span>..md)
He declares that the Lord will reduce that city to straits, that the
Jews might know that they had to contend with God, and not with men, and
that, though the war was carried on by the Assyrians, still they might
perceive that God was their leader.

<span id="xviii.i-p78"></span>*And it shall be to me as Ariel.* This
clause would not apply to the Temple alone; for he means that everything
shall be made bloody by the slaughter which shall take place at
Jerusalem;  <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) and therefore he
compares it to an “Altar,” on which victims of all kinds are slain, in
the same manner as wicked men destined for slaughter are frequently
compared to a sacrifice. In short, by alluding here to the word “Altar,”
he says, that the whole city shall be “as Ariel,” because it shall
overflow with the blood of the slain. Hence it is evident that the
outward profession of worship, ceremonies, and the outward
demonstrations of the favor of God, are of no avail, unless we sincerely
obey him. By an ironical expression he tells hypocrites, (who with an
impure heart present sacrifices of beasts to God, as if they were the
offerings fitted to appease his anger,) that their labor is fruitless,
and that, since they had profaned the Temple and the Altar, it was
impossible to offer a proper sacrifice to God without slaying victims
throughout the whole city, as if he had said, “There will be carnage in
every part.” He makes use of the word “Sacrifice” figuratively, to
denote the violent slaughter of those who refused to offer themselves
willingly to God.

<span id="xviii.i-p80"></span><span id="xviii.i-p80.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p81"></span>**3.** *And I will camp against thee round
about.* By the word <span id="xviii.i-p81.1"></span>כדור (*kāddūr*)
 <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md) he alludes to the roundness of
a ball; and the expression corresponds to one commonly used, (“<span
id="xviii.i-p82.1"></span>Je l’environneray,”) “I shall surround it.”
Thus he shews that all means of escape will be cut off.

<span id="xviii.i-p83"></span>*And will lay siege against thee.* This
alludes to another method of invading the city; for either attacks are
made at various points, or there is a regular siege. He confirms the
doctrine of the former verse, and shews that this war will be carried on
under God’s direction, and that the Assyrians, though they are hurried
on by their passions and by the lust of power, will undertake nothing
but by the command of God. He reckoned it to be of great importance to
carry full conviction to the minds of the Jews, that all the evils which
befell them were sent by God, that they might thus be led to enter into
an examination of their crimes. As this doctrine is often found in the
Scriptures, it ought to be the more carefully impressed on our minds;
for it is not without good reason that it is so frequently repeated and
inculcated by the Holy Spirit.

<span id="xviii.i-p84"></span><span id="xviii.i-p84.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p85"></span>**4.** *Then shalt thou be laid low.* He
describes scornfully that arrogance which led the Jews to despise all
threatenings and admonitions, so long as they enjoyed prosperity, as is
customary with all hypocrites. He says therefore, that, when their pride
has been laid aside, they will afterwards be more submissive; not that
they will change their dispositions, but because shame will restrain
that wantonness in which they formerly indulged. We ought therefore to
supply here an implied contrast. He addresses those who were puffed up
by ambition, carried their heads high, and despised every one, as if
they had not even been subject to God; for they ventured to curse and
insult God himself, and to mock at his holy word. “This pride,” says
Isaiah, “shall be laid low, and this arrogance shall cease.”

<span id="xviii.i-p86"></span>*And thy voice shall be out of the
ground.*  <span id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) What he had formerly
said he expresses more fully by a metaphor, that they will utter a low
and confused noise as out of caverns.  <span
id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) The voice of those who formerly were
so haughty and fierce is compared by him to the speech *of soothsayers*,
who, in giving forth their oracles out of some deep and dark cave under
ground, uttered some sort of confused muttering; for they did not speak
articulately, but whispered. He declares that these boasters (<span
id="xviii.i-p88.1"></span>ἀλάζονες) shall resemble them. Some interpret
this expression as if the Prophet meant that they will derive no benefit
from the chastisement; but the words do not convey this meaning, and he
afterwards says that the Jews will be brought to repentance. Yet he
first strikes terror, in order to repress their insolence; for they
arrogantly and rebelliously scorned all the threatenings of the Prophet.
By their being “brought down,” therefore, he means nothing else than
that they shall be covered with disgrace, so that they will not dare to
utter, as from a lofty place, their proud and idle boastings.

<span id="xviii.i-p89"></span><span id="xviii.i-p89.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p90"></span>**5.** *And as the small dust.*  <span
id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) I shall first state the opinions of
others, and afterwards I shall bring forward what I consider to be more
probable. Almost all the commentators think that this expression denotes
the enemies of the Jews; for they consider “foreigners” to mean
“enemies,” and allege that the multitude of those who shall oppress the
Jews shall be “like dust;” that is, it shall be innumerable. But when I
examine closely the whole passage, I am more disposed to adopt a
contrary opinion. I think that the Prophet speaks contemptuously of the
garrisons on which the Jews foolishly relied, for they had in their pay
foreign soldiers who were strong men.

<span id="xviii.i-p92"></span>*The multitude of the mighty ones.* Such
is the interpretation which I give to <span
id="xviii.i-p92.1"></span>עריצים (*gnărītzīm*), which is also its
literal meaning; and I see no reason why some of the Jews should suppose
it to mean ungodly or wicked persons. Since, therefore, the Jews brought
various garrisons from a distance, they thought that they were well
defended, and dreaded no danger. The Prophet threatens that their
subsidiary troops, though they were a vast multitude, shall in vain
create a disturbance, for they shall be like “dust” or “chaff,” that is,
useless refuse, for they shall produce no effect.  <span
id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) Hence we ought to infer, that our
wealth and resources, however great they are, shall be reduced to
nothing, as soon as the Lord shall determine to deal with us as he has a
right to do. The assistance of men lasts indeed for a time; but when the
Lord shall lift up his hand in earnest, their strength must crumble
down, and they must become like chaff.

<span id="xviii.i-p94"></span>*And it shall be in a moment suddenly.*
Some explain the concluding clause of this verse to mean, that the noise
of the enemies’ attack shall spring up suddenly, and, as it were, in a
moment. But I consider <span id="xviii.i-p94.1"></span>והיח,
(*vĕhāyāh*,) *and it shall be*, to relate to the time of duration, which
he declares will be momentary; that is, those military aids shall not
last long, but shall quickly vanish away.  <span
id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) In vain do men boast of them, for God
is their enemy.

<span id="xviii.i-p96"></span><span id="xviii.i-p96.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p97"></span>**6.** *From Jehovah of hosts shalt thou
be visited.* He next assigns the reason why all this multitude of
garrisons shall be “like chaff;” and he expresses this by an opposite
metaphor, for with those soldiers he contrasts the anger and “visitation
of the Lord.” What is “chaff” to the flame of “a devouring fire?” What
is “dust” to the force and violence of a “whirlwind?” He shews that the
vengeance of God will be such as all their preparations shall be unable
to resist. This meaning, in my opinion, makes the passage to flow
easily, and the clauses will not be so well adjusted, if we follow a
different interpretation.

<span id="xviii.i-p98"></span>Hence we learn that those who assail us
can do no more than what the Lord permits them to do. If therefore the
Lord determine to save us, the enemies will accomplish nothing, though
they raise up the whole world against us. On the other hand, if he
determine to chastise us, we shall not be able to ward off his wrath by
any force or bulwarks, which shall quickly be thrown down as by a
“whirlwind,” and shall even be consumed as by “a flame.”

<span id="xviii.i-p99"></span><span id="xviii.i-p99.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p100"></span>**7.** *As a dream of a night-vision.*
This verse also I interpret differently from others; for they think that
the Prophet intended to bring consolation to the godly. There is
undoubtedly great plausibility in this view, and it contains an
excellent doctrine, namely, that the enemies of the Church resemble
“dreamers” in this respect, that the Lord disappoints their hopes, even
when they think that they have almost gained their object.  <span
id="fr_262"></span>[263](#fn_262.md) But this interpretation does not
appear to me to agree well with the text. Sometimes it happens that,
when a sentence is beautiful, it attracts us to it, and causes us to
steal away from the true meaning, so that we do not adhere closely to
the context, or spend much time in investigating the author’s meaning.
Let us therefore inquire if this be the true meaning of the Prophet.

<span id="xviii.i-p102"></span>Since he afterwards proceeds again to
utter threatenings, I have no doubt that here he follows out the same
subject, which otherwise would be improperly broken off by the present
statement. He censures the Jews, and rebukes them for their obstinacy,
in boldly despising God and all his threatenings. In short, by a most
appropriate metaphor, he reproves them for their false confidence and
presumption, when he threatens that the enemies shall arrive suddenly
and unexpectedly, while the Jews shall imagine that they are enjoying
profound peace, and are very far from all danger; and that the event
shall be so sudden and unexpected, that it will appear to be “a dream.”
“Although then,” says he, “thou indulgest the hope of uninterrupted
repose, the Lord will quickly awake thee, and will drive away thy
presumption.”

<span id="xviii.i-p103"></span>The Prophet says wittily, that the Jews
are “dreaming,” because, in consequence of being drowned in their
pleasures, they neither see nor feel anything, but, amidst the dizzy
whirl, stupidly fancy that they are happy. Hence he infers that the
enemies will come, as in “a dream,” to strike terror into those who are
asleep, as it frequently happens that a pleasant and delightful sleep is
disturbed by frightful dreams. It follows from this, that the pleasures
which have lulled them to sleep will be of no advantage to them; for,
though they do not at all think of it, yet a tumult will arise suddenly.
This might still have been somewhat obscure, if he had not explained the
subject more fully in the following verse.

<span id="xviii.i-p104"></span><span id="xviii.i-p104.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p105"></span>**8.** *It shall be therefore as when a
hungry man dreameth.* He compares the Jews to “hungry men,” who are
indeed asleep, but whose empty stomach craves for food; for it is
natural for men to dream about food and entertainments when they are in
want of them. Thus, while the Jews watched, they were like “hungry men.”
The Lord continually warned them by his prophets, and invited them to
the divine feasts of the word; but they despised those feasts, and chose
rather to take refuge wholly in their vices, and to fall asleep in them,
than to partake fully of those sacred feasts. Accordingly, while they
quieted their consciences, they imagined that they had abundance of all
things, and that they were free from every inconvenience. Isaiah
declares that they greatly resemble this “dream” and airy “vision;” for,
when they have been aroused by a sudden calamity, they shall feel how
empty and insubstantial those “dreams and visions” were, and how false
and delusive was the opinion which they had formed that they enjoyed
abundance. As “hungry men,” who have had such dreams, are rendered more
feeble by them, so the people, who had been falsely persuaded that
everything was going on well with them, will endure much greater
uneasiness than if they had never cherished in their minds such a
thought, but, on the contrary, had been aware of their poverty and
nakedness.

<span id="xviii.i-p106"></span>*So shall be the multitude.* At first
sight, the expression appears to be harsh, when he says, “The multitude
of those who fight against Ariel shall be as a dream;” but it ought to
be explained in this manner: — “When the Jews, through false hope, shall
promise to themselves deliverance, as if the enemies would be driven far
away, they shall quickly feel that they had been deceived; in the same
manner as a person whom hunger leads to dream that he is feasting
luxuriously, as soon as he awakes, feels that his hunger is keener than
before.” I see nothing here, therefore, that is fitted to yield
consolation, for the Prophet pursues the same subject, and exclaims
against the scorn and rebellion of the Jews, on whom the Prophet could
make no impression by exhortation or threatenings.  <span
id="fr_263"></span>[264](#fn_263.md)

<span id="xviii.i-p108"></span><span id="xviii.i-p108.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p109"></span>**9.** *Tarry and wonder.* Isaiah follows
out the same subject, and attacks more keenly the gross stupidity of the
people. Instead of “tarry,” some render the term, “Be amazed;” but the
view which I prefer may be thus expressed: “Though they dwell much and
long on this thought, yet it will end in nothing else than that, by long
continued thought, their minds shall be amazed.” In short, he means that
the judgment of God will so completely overwhelm their minds, that
though they torture themselves by thinking and reflecting, still they
will be unable to find any outlet or conclusion.

<span id="xviii.i-p110"></span>*They are drunken, and not with wine.* He
now assigns the reason why fixed thought does not aid them in conquering
their slowness of apprehension. It is, because they resemble
*drunkards*. When, therefore, they neither see nor understand anything
in the works of God, he shews that this is owing to their indolence and
stupidity. A proof of this is given daily in many persons; for spiritual
“drunkenness” engrosses and stupefies all their senses to such a degree,
that they are blind to the plainest subjects; and, when God shews the
brightest light of justice and equity, they are so completely dazzled,
that their dim vision bewilders them more and more. This stupidity is a
just punishment which the Lord inflicts on them on account of their
unbelief.

<span id="xviii.i-p111"></span>In order that we may apply this statement
of the Prophet for our own use, it is proper to observe, that these
words of the Prophet must not be understood to be commands, as if he
enjoined them to stop and think longer; but, on the contrary, he mocks
and reproves their stupidity, as we have already said. (<span
id="xviii.i-p111.1"></span>Pensez y tant que vous voudrez, vous n’y
entendres rien) “Think as much as you please about it, you will not at
all understand it.”

<span id="xviii.i-p112"></span>*They are blinded, and they blind.*
 <span id="fr_264"></span>[265](#fn_264.md) He means, that they are
destitute of judgment and understanding, and that consequently it is
useless for them to contemplate these works of God; for as the
brightness of the sun is of no avail to the toad, so a blinded
understanding in vain does its utmost to comprehend the majestic works
of God. When he says that “they are blinded,” he means that by nature we
are created so as to be endued with reason and understanding for
contemplating the works of God; that our being “blinded” is, so to
speak, an accidental fault, and that the drunkenness does not naturally
belong to us, for it is owing to the ingratitude of men, which the Lord
justly censures.

<span id="xviii.i-p114"></span>*They stagger.* This “staggering” of the
mind is contrasted by him with a calm and quiet exercise of reason; for
he means that violence of the passions which agitates the mind, and
causes it to waver and reel.

<span id="xviii.i-p115"></span><span id="xviii.i-p115.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p116"></span>**10.** *Because Jehovah hath overpowered
you with the spirit of slumber.* For the purpose of shewing more clearly
the source of this blindness, he attributes it to the judgment of God,
who determined to punish in this manner the wickedness of the people. As
it belongs to him to give eyes to see, and to enlighten minds by the
spirit of judgment and understanding, so he alone deprives us of all
light, when he sees that by a wicked and depraved hatred of the truth we
of our own accord wish for darkness. Accordingly, when men are blind,
and especially in things so plain and obvious, we perceive his righteous
judgment.

<span id="xviii.i-p117"></span>*Your prophets and principal seers.*
 <span id="fr_265"></span>[266](#fn_265.md) He adds, that the people are
deprived of those aids and helps which ought to have imparted light to
the understanding and given direction to others.  <span
id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) Such was the office of the prophets,
whom he describes by both of these names, <span
id="xviii.i-p119.2"></span>נביאים, (*nēbīīm*,) and <span
id="xviii.i-p119.3"></span>חזים, (*chōzīm*,) “prophets” and “seers.” In
short, he means not only that men who are endued with reason and
understanding will be deprived of common sense, but that their teachers
also, whose duty it was to enlighten others, will be altogether
senseless so as not to know the road, and, being covered with the
darkness of ignorance, will shamefully go astray, and will be so far
from directing others that they will not even be able to guide
themselves.

<span id="xviii.i-p120"></span><span id="xviii.i-p120.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p121"></span>**11.** *Therefore every vision hath
become to you.* The Prophet expresses still more clearly what he had
formerly said, that the blindness of the Jews will be so great that,
though the Lord enlightens them by the clearest light of his word, they
will understand nothing. Nor does he mean that this will happen to the
common people alone, but even to the rulers and teachers, who ought to
have been wiser than others, and to have held out an example to them.
 <span id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) In short, he means that this
stupidity will pervade all ranks; for both “learned and unlearned,” he
declares, will be so dull and stupid as to be altogether dazzled by the
word of God, and to see no more in it than in a “sealed letter.” He
makes the same statement, but in different words, which he had made in
the former chapter, that the Lord will be to them as “precept upon
precept, line upon line;” for they will always remain in the first
rudiments, and will never arrive at solid doctrine. (<span
id="xviii.i-p122.2"></span>[Isa
28:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#013.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p122.2"></span>.)

<span id="xviii.i-p123"></span>In the same sense he now shews that, from
the highest to the lowest, they will derive no benefit from the word of
God. He does not say that doctrine will be taken away, but that, though
it be in their possession, they will not have reason and understanding.
In two ways the Lord punishes the wickedness of men; for sometimes he
takes away entirely the use of the word, and sometimes, when he leaves
it, he takes away understanding, and blinds the minds of men, so that
“seeing they do not see.” (<span id="xviii.i-p123.1"></span>[Isa
6:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa006.htm#009)<span id="xviii.i-p123.1"></span>..md)
First, therefore, he deprives them of reading, either by taking away the
books through the tyranny of wicked men, as frequently happens, or by a
false conviction of men, which leads them to think that the books were
not delivered to be read universally by all. Secondly, although he
allows them to handle and read the books, yet, because men abuse them,
and are ungrateful, and do not look straight to the glory of God, they
are blinded, and see no more than if not a single ray of the word had
shone upon them. We must not boast, therefore, of the outward preaching
of the word; for it will be of no avail unless it produce its fruit by
enlightening our minds. It is as if he had said,

<span id="xviii.i-p124"></span>“On account of that covenant which he
made with your fathers, the Lord will leave to you the tables of that
covenant; but they shall be to you ‘a sealed letter,’ for you shall
learn nothing from them.” (<span id="xviii.i-p124.1"></span>[Deut.
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#020.md),
[37](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#037.md), [Deut.
7:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu007.htm#006)<span id="xviii.i-p124.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xviii.i-p125"></span>When we see that these things happened to
the Jews, as Isaiah threatened, and when we take into view the condition
of that people, which God had adopted and separated, it is impossible
that we should not altogether tremble at such dreadful vengeance. Though
they had been instructed both by the law and by the prophets, and had
been enlightened by a light of surpassing brightness, yet they fell into
frightful superstitions and shocking impiety; the worship of God was
corrupted, all religion was scattered and overthrown, and they were rent
and divided into various and monstrous sects. At length, when the
Sadducees, the most wicked of them all, held the chief power, when all
faith and all hope of a resurrection, and even of immortality, had been
taken away, what, I ask, could they resemble but cattle or swine? for
what is left to man if the hope of a blessed and eternal life be taken
from him?

<span id="xviii.i-p126"></span>And yet the Evangelists (<span
id="xviii.i-p126.1"></span>[Mt
22:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#023.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p126.1"></span>; <span id="xviii.i-p126.2"></span>[Mr
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#018.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p126.2"></span>; <span id="xviii.i-p126.3"></span>[Lu
20:27](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#027.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p126.3"></span>; <span id="xviii.i-p126.4"></span>[Ac
23:8](../../../bib/kjv/act023.htm#008)<span id="xviii.i-p126.4"></span>.md)
plainly tell us that there were such persons when Christ came; for at
that time these things were actually fulfilled, as they had been
foretold by the Prophet, that we may know that these threatening were
not thrown out at random or by chance, and that they did not fail of
accomplishment, because at that time they were obstinately and
rebelliously despised and scorned by wicked men. At that time,
therefore, both their unbelief and their folly were clearly seen, when
the true light was revealed to the whole world, that is, Christ, the
only light of truth, the soul of the law, the end of all the prophets.
At that time, I say, there was, in an especial manner, placed before the
eyes of the Jews “that vail which was shadowed out in Moses,” (<span
id="xviii.i-p126.5"></span>[Ex
34:30](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#030.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p126.5"></span>,) whom they could not look at on account of
his excessive brightness; and it was actually fulfilled in Christ, to
whom it belonged, as Paul tells us, to take away and destroy that vail.
(<span id="xviii.i-p126.6"></span>[2Co
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#016.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p126.6"></span>.) Till now, therefore, the vail lies on
their hearts when they read Moses; for they reject Christ, to whom Moses
ought to be viewed as related. In that passage “Moses” must be viewed as
denoting the law; and if it be referred to its end, that is, to Christ,
that vail will be taken away.

<span id="xviii.i-p127"></span>While we contemplate these judgments of
God, let us also acknowledge, that he who was formerly the Judge is
still the Judge, and that the same vengeance is prepared for those who
shall refuse to lend their ear to his most holy warnings. When he
expressly names the “learned and unlearned,”  <span
id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) it ought to be observed, that we do
not understand spiritual doctrine, in consequence of possessing an acute
understanding, or having received a superior education in the schools.
Learning did not prevent them from being blinded. We ought, therefore,
to embrace the word sincerely and earnestly, if we wish to escape this
vengeance, which is threatened not only against the ignorant but also
against the “learned.”

<span id="xviii.i-p143"></span><span id="xviii.i-p143.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p144"></span>**13.** *Therefore the Lord saith.* The
Prophet shews that the Lord, in acting with such severity towards his
people, will proceed on the most righteous grounds; though it was a
severe and dreadful chastisement that their minds should be stupefied by
the hand of God.  <span id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) Now, since men
are so fool-hardy and obstinate, that they do not hesitate to contend
with him, as if he were unjustly severe, the Prophet shews that God has
acted the part of a righteous judge, and that the blame lies wholly on
men, who have provoked him by their baseness and wickedness.

<span id="xviii.i-p146"></span>*Because this people draweth near with
their mouth.* He shews that the people have deserved this punishment
chiefly on account of their hypocrisy and superstitions. When he says
that “they draw near with the *mouth* and the *lips*,” he describes
their hypocrisy. This is the interpretation which I give to <span
id="xviii.i-p146.1"></span>נגש, (*nāgăsh*,) and it appears to me to be
the more probable reading, though some are of a different opinion. Some
translate it, “to be compelled,” and others, “to magnify themselves;”
but the word contrasted with it, *to remove,*  <span
id="fr_270"></span>[271](#fn_270.md) which he afterwards employs, shews
plainly that the true reading is that which is most generally received.

<span id="xviii.i-p148"></span>*And their fear toward me hath been
taught by the precept of men.* By these words he reproves their
superstitious and idolatrous practices. These two things are almost
always joined together; and not only so, but hypocrisy is never free
from ungodliness or superstition; and, on the other hand, ungodliness or
superstition is never free from hypocrisy. By the *mouth* and *lips* he
means an outward profession, which belongs equally to the good and the
bad; but they differ in this respect, that bad men have nothing but idle
ostentation, and think that they have done all that is required, if they
open their lips in honour of God; but good men, out of the deepest
feeling of the heart, present themselves before God, and, while they
yield their obedience, confess and acknowledge how far they are from a
perfect discharge of their duty.

<span id="xviii.i-p149"></span>Thus he makes use of a figure of speech,
very frequent in Scripture, by which one part or class denotes the
whole. He has selected a class exceedingly appropriate and suitable to
the present subject, for it is chiefly by the tongue and the mouth that
the appearance of piety is assumed. Isaiah therefore includes, also, the
other parts by which hypocrites counterfeit and deceive, for in every
way they are inclined to lies and falsehood. We ought not to seek a
better expositor than Christ himself, who, in speaking of the washing of
the hands, which the Pharisees regarded as a manifestation of holiness,
and which they blamed the disciples for neglecting, in order to convict
them of hypocrisy, says,

<span id="xviii.i-p150"></span>“Well hath Isaiah prophesied of you, This
people honoureth me with the lips, but their heart is far from me.”  
(<span id="xviii.i-p150.2"></span>[Matt.
15:7](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#008)<span id="xviii.i-p150.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xviii.i-p151"></span>With the “lips” and “mouth,” therefore,
the Prophet contrasts the “heart,” the sincerity of which God enjoins
and demands from us. If this be wanting, all our works, whatever
brilliancy they possess, are rejected by him; for “he is a Spirit,” and
therefore chooses to be “worshipped” and adored by us “with the spirit”
and the heart. (<span id="xviii.i-p151.1"></span>[Joh
4:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p151.1"></span>.) If we do not begin with this, all that men
profess by outward gestures and attitudes will be empty display. We may
easily conclude from this what value ought to be set on that worship
which Papists think that they render to God, when they worship God by
useless ringing of bells, mumbling, wax candles, incense, splendid
dresses, and a thousand trifles of the same sort; for we see that God
not only rejects them, but even holds them in abhorrence.

<span id="xviii.i-p152"></span>On the second point, when God is
worshipped by inventions of men, he condemns this “fear” as
superstitious, though men endeavour to cloak it under a plausible
pretence of religion, or devotion, or reverence. He assigns the reason,
that it “hath been taught by men.” I consider <span
id="xviii.i-p152.1"></span>מלמדה (*mĕlŭmmādāh*)  <span
id="fr_271"></span>[272](#fn_271.md) to have a passive signification; for
he means, that to make “the commandments of men,” and not the word of
God, the rule of worshipping him, is a subversion of all order.  <span
id="fr_272"></span>[273](#fn_272.md) But it is the will of the Lord, that
our “fear,” and the reverence with which we worship him, shall be
regulated by the rule of his word; and he demands nothing so much as
simple obedience, by which we shall conform ourselves and all our
actions to the rule of the word, and not turn aside to the right hand or
to the left.

<span id="xviii.i-p155"></span>Hence it is sufficiently evident, that
those who learn from “the inventions of men” how they should worship
God, not only are manifestly foolish, but wear themselves out by
destructive toil, because they do nothing else than provoke God’s anger;
for he could not testify more plainly than by the tremendous severity of
this chastisement, how great is the abhorrence with which he regards
false worship. The flesh reckons it to be improper that God should not
only reckon as worthless, but even punish severely, the efforts of those
who, through ignorance and error, weary themselves in attempts to
appease God; but we ought not to wonder if he thus maintains his
authority. Christ himself explains this passage, saying, “In vain do
they worship me, teaching doctrines, the commandments of men.” (<span
id="xviii.i-p155.1"></span>[Mt
15:9](../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#009.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p155.1"></span>.) Some have chosen to add a conjunction,
“teaching doctrines *and* commandments of men,” as if the meaning had
not been sufficiently clear. But he evidently means something different,
namely, that we act absurdly when we follow “the commandments of men”
for our doctrine and rule of life.

<span id="xviii.i-p156"></span><span id="xviii.i-p156.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p157"></span>**14.** *Therefore, behold, I add to do.*
 <span id="fr_273"></span>[274](#fn_273.md) He threatens that he will
punish by blinding not only the ignorant or the ordinary ranks, but
those wise men who were held in admiration by the people. From this
vengeance we may easily learn how hateful a vice hypocrisy is, and how
greatly it is abhorred by God, as the Prophet spoke a little before
about human inventions; for what kind of punishment is more dreadful
than blindness of mind and stupidity? This indeed is not commonly
perceived by men, nor are they aware of the greatness of this evil; but
it is the greatest and most wretched of all.

<span id="xviii.i-p159"></span>*For the wisdom of their wise men shall
perish.* He does not speak of the common herd of men, but of their very
leaders, who ought to have been like eyes. The common people in
themselves are blind, like the other members of the body; and when the
eyes are blinded, what shall become of the rest of the body? “If the
light be darkness,” as Christ says, “how great shall be the darkness!”
This is added in order to place that vengeance in a more striking light.

<span id="xviii.i-p160"></span>Hence also, we may infer how vain and
foolish is the boasting of the Papists, who think that they have shut
the mouths of all men, when they have brought forward the name of
Bishops, or other titles of the same kind, such as Doctors, or Pastors,
or the Apostolic See. They have perhaps a different kind of wisdom from
that which was possessed by the Jews; but whence did they derive it?
They pretend that it came from God; but we see that the Prophet does not
speak of the wise men of the Chaldeans or Egyptians, but of the order of
priesthood which God had appointed, of the teachers, and chief rulers,
and ensign bearers, of the chosen people and of the only Church; for
under this term “wise men,” he includes all superior excellence and
authority among the people.

<span id="xviii.i-p161"></span><span id="xviii.i-p161.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p162"></span>**15.** *Woe to them that conceal
themselves from Jehovah.* The Prophet again exclaims against those
wicked and profane despisers of God, whom he formerly called <span
id="xviii.i-p162.1"></span>לצים, (*lētzīm*,) “scorners,” who think that
they have no other way of being wise than to be skilful in mocking God.
They regard religion as foolish simplicity, and hide themselves in their
cunning, as in a labyrinth; and on this account they mock at warnings
and threatenings, and, in short, at the whole doctrine of godliness.
From this verse it is sufficiently evident that the pestilence, which
afterwards spread more widely, prevailed even at that time in the world,
namely, that hypocrites delighted in mocking inwardly at God, and in
despising prophecies. The Prophet therefore exclaims against them, and
calls them <span id="xviii.i-p162.2"></span>מעמיקים, (*măgnămīkīm*,)
that is, “diggers,”  <span id="fr_274"></span>[275](#fn_274.md) as if they
“dug” for themselves concealment and lurking-places, that by means of
them they might deceive God.

<span id="xviii.i-p164"></span>*That they may hide counsel.* This clause
is added for the sake of exposition. Some interpret the beginning of
this verse, as if the Prophet condemned that excessive curiosity by
which some men, with excess of hardihood, search into the secret
judgments of God. But that interpretation cannot be admitted; and the
Prophet plainly shews to whom he refers, when he immediately adds the
mockeries of those who thought that their wickedness was committed in a
manner so secret and concealed, that they could not be detected. The
“hiding of counsel” means nothing else than hardihood in wickedness, by
which wicked men surround themselves with clouds, and obscure the light,
that their inward baseness may not be seen. Hence arises that daring
question —

<span id="xviii.i-p165"></span>*Who seeth us?* For, although they
professed to be worshippers of God, yet they thought that, by their
sophistry, they had succeeded not only in refuting the prophets, but in
overturning the judgment of God; not openly, indeed, for even wicked men
wish to retain some semblance of religion, that they may more
effectually deceive, but in their heart they acknowledge no God but the
god which they have contrived. This craftiness, therefore, in which
wicked men delight and flatter themselves, is compared by Isaiah to a
hiding-place, or to coverings. They think that they are covered with a
veil, so that not even God himself can see and punish their wickedness.
As rulers are principally chargeable with this vice, it is chiefly to
them, in my opinion, that the Prophet’s reproof is directed; for they do
not think that they have sufficient acuteness or dexterity, if they do
not scoff at God, and despise his doctrine, and, in short, believe no
more than what they choose. They do not venture to reject it altogether,
or rather, they are constrained, against their will, to hold by some
religion; but they do so only as far as they think that they can promote
their own convenience, and are not moved by any fear of the true God.

<span id="xviii.i-p166"></span>At the present day this wickedness has
been abundantly manifested, and especially since the gospel was
revealed. Under Popery men found it easy to transact with God, because
the Pope had contrived a god who changed himself so as to suit the
disposition of every individual. Every person had a different method of
washing away his sins, and many kinds of worship for appeasing his
deity. Consequently, none ought to wonder that wickedness was not seen
at that time, for it was concealed by coverings of that sort; and when
these had been taken away, men declared openly what they had formerly
been. Yet not less common in our age is the disease which Isaiah
bewailed in his nation; for men think that they can conceal themselves
from God, when they have interposed their ingenious contrivances, as if
“all things were not naked and open to his eyes,” (<span
id="xviii.i-p166.1"></span>[Heb
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb004.htm#013.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p166.1"></span>,) or as if any man could deceive or be
concealed from him. For this reason he says, by way of explanation —

<span id="xviii.i-p167"></span>*For their works are in darkness.* He
assigns this as the cause of that foolish confidence by which ungodly
men are intoxicated. Though they are surrounded by light, they are so
slow of perception, that when they do not see it, they endeavour to flee
from the presence of God. They even promise to themselves full escape
from punishment, and commit sin with as much freedom as if they had been
protected and fortified on all sides against God. Such is the import of
their question, *Who seeth us?* Not that wicked men ventured openly to
utter these words, as we have said, but because they thus spoke or thus
thought in their hearts, which was manifested by their presumption and
vain confidence. They abandoned themselves to all wickedness, and
despised all warnings, in such a manner as if there would never be a
judgment of God. The Prophet, therefore, had to do with ungodly men, who
in appearance and name professed to have some knowledge of God, but in
reality denied him, and were very bitter enemies of pure doctrine. Now,
this is nothing else than to affirm that God is not a Judge, and to cast
him down from his seat and tribunal; for God cannot be acknowledged
without doctrine; and where that is set aside and rejected, God himself
must be set aside and rejected.

id="xviii.i-p169.3"></span>אם (ĭ*m*) is often used in putting a
question, and sometimes in making an affirmation; and therefore some
translate it *truly*. The word <span id="xviii.i-p169.4"></span>הפך
(*hāphăch*) is considered by some to mean “turning upside down,”  <span
id="fr_275"></span>[276](#fn_275.md) as if he had said, “Shall your turning
upside down be reckoned like clay?” Others render it “turning,” that is,
the purposes which are formed in the heart. But the most generally
received rendering is, “turning upside down” or “destruction.” As if he
had said, “I would care no more about destroying you, than the potter
would care about turning the clay; for you are like clay, because I have
created you with my hand.”

<span id="xviii.i-p171"></span>But as the Prophet appears to contrast
those two particles <span id="xviii.i-p171.1"></span>אם (ĭ*m*) and <span
id="xviii.i-p171.2"></span>כי (*kī*), I am more inclined to a different
opinion, though I do not object to the former exposition, which contains
a doctrine in other respects useful. My view of it therefore is this,
“Shall your turning, that is, the purposes which you ponder in your
heart, be like potter’s clay? Is it not as if the vessel said to the
potter, Thou hast not formed me? Your pride is astonishing; for you act
as if you had created yourselves, and as if you had everything in your
own power. I had a right to appoint whatever I thought fit. When you
dare to assume such power and authority, you are too little acquainted
with your condition, and you do not know that you are men.”  <span
id="fr_276"></span>[277](#fn_276.md)

<span id="xviii.i-p173"></span>This diversity of expositions makes no
difference as to the Prophet’s meaning, who had no other object in view
than to confirm the doctrine taught in the preceding verse; for he still
exclaims against proud men, who claim so much power to themselves that
they cannot endure the authority of God, and entertain a false opinion
about themselves, which leads them to despise all exhortations, as if
they had been gods. Thus do they deny that God has created them; for
whatever men claim for themselves, they take from God, and deprive him
of the honour which is due to him.

<span id="xviii.i-p174"></span>Only in the first clause would the
meaning at all differ; for those who interpret <span
id="xviii.i-p174.1"></span>אם (ĭ*m*) affirmatively, consider this verse
to mean, “*Truly*, I will destroy you as a potter would break the pot
which he had made.” But as the Prophet had to do with proud men, who
sought out lurking-places in order to deceive God, I rather view it as a
question, “Are you so able workmen that the revolutions of your brain
can make this or that, as a potter, by turning the wheel, frames vessels
at his pleasure?” Let every person adopt his own opinion: I follow that
which I consider to be probable.

<span id="xviii.i-p175"></span><span id="xviii.i-p175.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p176"></span>**17.** *Is it not yet a little while?*
The Lord now declares that he will make those wicked men to know who
they are; as if he had said, “You are now asleep in your pride, but I
shall speedily awake you.” Men indulge themselves, till they feel the
powerful hand of God; and therefore the Prophet threatens that the
judgment of God will overtake such profound indifference.

<span id="xviii.i-p177"></span>*And Lebanon shall be turned into
Carmel.*  <span id="fr_277"></span>[278](#fn_277.md) Under the names
“Lebanon” and “Carmel” he intended to express a renovation of the world
and a change of affairs. But as to the object of the allusion,
commentators differ widely from each other. As Mount “Lebanon” was
clothed with trees and forests, and “Carmel” had fruitful and fertile
fields. Many think that the Jews are compared to “Carmel,” because they
will be barren, and Christians to “Lebanon,” because they will yield a
great abundance of fruits. That opinion is certainly plausible, as men
are usually gratified by everything that is ingenious; but a parallel
passage, which we shall afterwards see, (<span
id="xviii.i-p178.2"></span>[Isa
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p178.2"></span>), will shew that the Prophet here employs
the comparison for the purpose of magnifying the grace of God; for, when
he shall again begin to bless his people, the vast abundance of all
blessings will take away from “Carmel” the celebrity which it possessed.
He therefore threatens that he will turn “Lebanon” into “Carmel,” that
is, a forest will become a cultivated field, and will produce corn, and
the cultivated fields shall yield so great an abundance of fruits that,
if their present and future conditions be compared, they may now be
pronounced to be unfruitful and barren. This mode of expression will be
more fully explained when we come to consider <span
id="xviii.i-p178.3"></span>[Isa
32:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa032.htm#015.md)<span id="xviii.i-p178.3"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p179"></span>Others view “Carmel” as an appellative,
but I prefer to regard it as a proper name; for it means that those
fruitful fields may now be reckoned uncultivated and barren, in
comparison of the new and unwonted fertility. Others explain it
allegorically, and take “Lebanon” as denoting proud men, and “Carmel” as
denoting mean and ordinary persons. This may be thought to be acute and
ingenious, but I choose rather to follow that more simple interpretation
which I have already stated. That the godly may not be discouraged, he
passes from threatenings to proclaim grace, and declares that when, by
enduring for a little the cross laid on them, they shall have given
evidence of the obedience of their faith, a sudden renovation is at hand
to fill them with joy. And yet, by shutting out the ungodly from this
hope, he intimates that, when they are at ease, and promise to
themselves peace or a truce, destruction is very near at hand; for,
“when they shall say, Peace and Safety,” as Paul tells us, “then sudden
destruction will overtake them.” (<span id="xviii.i-p179.1"></span>[1Th
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#003)<span id="xviii.i-p179.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xviii.i-p180"></span><span id="xviii.i-p180.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p181"></span>**18.** *And in that day shall the deaf
hear.* He promises that the Church of God, as we have said, shall still
be preserved amidst those calamities. Though the world be shaken by
innumerable tempests, and tossed up and down, and though heaven and
earth shall mingle, yet the Lord will preserve the multitude of the
godly, and will raise up his Church, as it were, out of the midst of
death. This ought to strengthen in no ordinary manner the faith of the
godly; for it is an extraordinary miracle of God that, amidst the
numerous and extensive ruins of empires and monarchies, which happen
here and there, the seed of the godly is preserved, among whom the same
religion, the same worship of God, the same faith, and the same method
of salvation, are continued.

<span id="xviii.i-p182"></span>*And the eyes of the blind shall see.*
But Isaiah appears here to contradict himself; for formerly he foretold
that among the people of God there would be so great stupidity that
nobody would understand, and now he says that even “the deaf” shall
understand, and “the blind shall see.” He therefore means that the
Church must first be chastised and purified, and that not in a common
and ordinary way, but in a way so unusual that it will appear to have
altogether perished. He therefore says, *in that day*, that is, after
having punished the wicked and purified his Church, not only will he
enrich the earth with an abundance of fruits, but, by renewing the face
of it, he will at the same time restore “hearing to the deaf” and “sight
to the blind,” that they may receive his doctrine. Men have no ears and
no eyes, so long as this dreadful punishment lasts; the minds of all are
stupefied and confounded, and do not understand anything. When the
plagues and distresses shall have come to an end, the Lord will open his
eyes, that they may behold and embrace his goodness and compassion.

<span id="xviii.i-p183"></span>This is the true method of restoring the
Church, when it gives sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf, which
we see that Christ also did, not only to the bodies but also to the
souls. (<span id="xviii.i-p183.1"></span>[John
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#007.md),
[39](../../../bib/kjv/joh009.htm#039)<span id="xviii.i-p183.1"></span>..md)
We too have experienced this in our own time, when we have been brought
out of the darkness of ignorance, in which we were enveloped, and have
been restored to the true light; and eyes have been restored to see, and
ears to hear it, which formerly were shut and closed; for the Lord
“pierced them,” (<span id="xviii.i-p183.2"></span>[Ps
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#006.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p183.2"></span>,) that he might bring us to obey him. The
blessing which he promised in the renovation of the earth was indeed a
kind of proof of reconciliation; but far more excellent is that
illumination of which he now speaks, without which all God’s benefits
not only are lost, but are turned to our destruction. Justly does God
claim for himself a work so glorious and excellent; because there is
nothing for which there is less ground of hope than that the blind
should recover sight, and that the deaf should recover hearing, by their
own strength. This is evidently promised, in a peculiar manner, to the
elect alone; for the greater part of men always continue in their
darkness.

<span id="xviii.i-p184"></span><span id="xviii.i-p184.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p185"></span>**19.** *Then shall the humble again take
joy in Jehovah.* Such is my translation of this passage, while others
render it, “They shall add,” or “continue to rejoice;” for the Prophet
describes not a “joy” which is continued but rather a “joy” which is
new. As if he had said, “Though they are now distressed and sorrowful,
yet I will give them occasion of gladness, so that they shall again be
filled with “joy.” He speaks of the “humble;” and hence it ought to be
observed that our afflictions prepare us for receiving the grace of God;
for the Lord casts us down and afflicts us, that he may afterwards raise
us up. Thus, when the Lord corrects his people, we ought not to lose
heart, but should recall to remembrance those statements, that we may
always hope for better things, and may believe that, after such
calamities and distresses, he will at length bring joy to his Church.
Yet we again learn from it what I briefly mentioned a little before,
that the grace of illumination does not belong indiscriminately to all;
for, although all have been chastened together, yet not all have had
their hearts subdued by affliction, so as truly to become “poor in
spirit,” or “meek.” (<span id="xviii.i-p185.1"></span>[Matt.
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005)<span id="xviii.i-p185.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xviii.i-p186"></span><span id="xviii.i-p186.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p187"></span>**20.** *For the violent man is brought
to nought.* He states more clearly what we have already mentioned in the
former verse, namely, that the restoration of the Church consists in
this, that the Lord raises up those who are cast down, and has
compassion on the poor. But that purification of the Church, of which we
have already spoken, is first necessary; for so long as the Lord does
not execute his judgment against the wicked, and the bad are mixed with
the good, so as even to hold the highest place in the Church, everything
is soiled and corrupted, God is not worshipped or feared, and even
godliness is trampled under feet. When therefore the ungodly are removed
or subdued, the Church is restored to its splendour, and the godly,
freed from distresses and calamities, leap for joy.

<span id="xviii.i-p188"></span>First, he calls them <span
id="xviii.i-p188.1"></span>עריצים, (*gnărītzīm*,) “violent.” There are
various interpretations of this word; but I think that the Prophet
distinguishes between those who are openly wicked, and have no shame,
 <span id="fr_278"></span>[279](#fn_278.md) and those who have some
appearance of goodness, and yet are not better than others, for they
mock at God in their hearts. But perhaps by the two adjectives,
“violent” and “scorners,” he describes the same persons; because, like
robbers among men, they seize, oppress, treat with cruelty, and commit
every kind of outrage, and yet are not withheld by any fear of God,
because they regard religion as a fable.

<span id="xviii.i-p190"></span>*And they who hastened early to
iniquity.*  <span id="fr_279"></span>[280](#fn_279.md) Under this class he
includes other crimes. He speaks not of the Chaldeans or Assyrians, but
of those who wished to be reckoned in the number of the godly, and
boasted of being the seed of Abraham.

<span id="xviii.i-p192"></span><span id="xviii.i-p192.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p193"></span>**21.** *That make a man an offender for
a word.* We have formerly stated who were the persons with whom the
Prophet had to do, namely, with hypocrites and profane scorners, who set
at nought all the reproofs and threatenings of the Prophets, and who
wished to frame a God according to their own fancy. Such persons,
desiring to have unbounded license, that they might indulge freely in
their pleasures and their crimes, bore very impatiently the keen
reproofs of the prophets, and did not calmly submit to be restrained. On
this account they carefully observed and watched for their words, that
they might take them by surprise, or give a false construction. I have
no doubt that he reproves wicked men, who complained of the liberty used
by the prophets, and of the keenness of their reproofs, as if they had
intended to attack the people, and the nobles, and the priests; for
hence arise the calumnies and false accusations which are brought even
against the faithful servants of God. Hence arise those doubtful and
ensnaring questions which are spread out as snares and nets, that they
may either bring a righteous man into danger of his life, or may
practice some kind of deceit upon him. We see that the Pharisees and
Sadducees did so to Christ himself. (<span
id="xviii.i-p193.1"></span>[Matt.
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#023.md), [Matt.
22:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#017.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p193.1"></span>; <span id="xviii.i-p193.2"></span>[Joh
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#006)<span id="xviii.i-p193.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xviii.i-p194"></span>*Who have laid a snare for him that
reproveth in the gate.* This latter clause, which is added for the sake
of exposition, does not allow us to interpret the verse as referring
generally to calumnies, and other arts by which cunning men entrap the
unwary; for now the Prophet condemns more openly those wicked
contrivances by which ungodly men endeavor to escape all censure and
reproof. As it was “in the gates” that public assemblies and courts of
justice were held, and great crowds assembled there, the prophets
publicly reproved all, and did not spare even the judges; for at that
time the government was in the hands of men whom it was necessary to
admonish and reprove sharply. Instead of repenting, as they ought to
have done when they were warned, they became worse, and were enraged
against the prophets, and laid snares for them; for “they hated,” as
Amos says, “him that reproveth in the gate, and abhorred him that
speaketh uprightly.” (<span id="xviii.i-p194.1"></span>[Am
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#010.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p194.1"></span>.) This relates to all, but principally to
judges, and those who hold the reins of government, who take it worse,
and are more highly displeased that they should receive such reproofs;
for they wish to be distinguished from the rank of other men, and to be
reckoned the most excellent of all, even though they be the most wicked.

<span id="xviii.i-p195"></span>*Who have laid snares.* Commentators
differ as to the meaning of the word! <span
id="xviii.i-p195.1"></span>יקשון, (*yĕkōshūn*;) for some render it “have
reproved,” and others “have reproached,” as if the Prophet censured the
obstinacy of those who resort to slanders, in order to drive reprovers
far away from them. But I trust that my readers will approve of the
meaning which I have followed.

<span id="xviii.i-p196"></span>*And have turned aside the righteous man
for nothing,* that is, when there is no cause.  <span
id="fr_280"></span>[281](#fn_280.md) By wicked and deceitful contrivances,
they endeavor to cause the righteous to be hated and abhorred by all
men, and to be reckoned the most wicked of all; but, after having thus
sported with the world, they will at length perish. Such is the
consolation which the Lord gives, that he will not suffer the wickedness
of the ungodly to pass unpunished, though they give way to mirth and
wantonness for a time, but will at length restrain them. Yet “we have
need of patience, that we may wait for the fulfillment of these
promises.” (<span id="xviii.i-p197.1"></span>[Heb
10:36](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#036.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p197.1"></span>.)

<span id="xviii.i-p198"></span><span id="xviii.i-p198.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p199"></span>**22.** *Therefore thus saith Jehovah.*
This is the conclusion of the former statement; for he comforts the
people, that they may not despair in that wretched and miserable
condition to which they shall be reduced. We ought to observe the time
to which those things must relate, that is, when the people have been
brought into a state of slavery, the temple overturned, the sacrifices
taken away, and when it might be thought that all religion had fallen
down, and that there was no hope of deliverance. The minds of believers
must therefore have been supported by this prediction, that, when they
were shipwrecked, they might still have this plank left, which they
might seize firmly, and by which they might be brought into the harbour.
We too ought to take hold of these promises, even in the most desperate
circumstances, and to rely on them with our whole heart.

<span id="xviii.i-p200"></span>*To the house of Jacob.* The address made
to them should lead us to remark, that the power of the word of God is
perpetual, and is so efficacious that it exerts its power, so long as
there is a people that fears and worships him. There are always some
whom the Lord reserves for himself, and he does not allow the seed of
the godly to perish. Since the Lord hath spoken, if we believe his word,
we shall undoubtedly derive benefit from it. His truth is firm, and
therefore, if we rely on him, we shall never want consolation.

<span id="xviii.i-p201"></span>*Who redeemed Abraham.* Not without good
reason does he add, that he who now declares that he will be kind to the
children of Jacob is the same God “who redeemed Abraham.” He recalls the
attention of the people to the very beginning of the Church, that they
may behold the power of God, which had formerly been made known by
proofs so numerous and so striking that it ought no longer to be
doubted. If they gloried in the name of Abraham, they ought to consider
whence it was that the Lord first delivered him, that is, from the
service of idols, which both he and his fathers had worshipped. (<span
id="xviii.i-p201.1"></span>[Gen.
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#031.md), [Gen.
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)<span id="xviii.i-p201.1"></span>;
<span id="xviii.i-p201.2"></span>[Jos
24:2](../../../bib/kjv/jos024.htm#002.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p201.2"></span>.) But on many other occasions he “redeemed”
him; when he was in danger in Egypt on account of his wife, (<span
id="xviii.i-p201.3"></span>[Ge
12:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#017.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p201.3"></span>,) and again in Gerar, (<span
id="xviii.i-p201.4"></span>[Ge
20:14](../../../bib/kjv/gen020.htm#014.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p201.4"></span>,) and again when he subdued kings, (<span
id="xviii.i-p201.5"></span>[Ge
14:16](../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#016.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p201.5"></span>,) and likewise when he received offspring
after being past having children. (<span
id="xviii.i-p201.6"></span>[Gen. 21:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#002.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/gen021.htm#005)<span id="xviii.i-p201.6"></span>..md)
Although the Prophet has chiefly in view the adoption of God, when the
Lord commanded him to leave “his father’s house,” (<span
id="xviii.i-p201.7"></span>[Ge
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/gen012.htm#001.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p201.7"></span>,) yet under the word “redeemed” he includes
likewise all blessings; for we see that Abraham was “redeemed” on more
than one occasion, that is, he was rescued from very great dangers and
from the risk of his life.

<span id="xviii.i-p202"></span>Now, if the Lord raised up from Abraham
alone, and at a time when he had no children, a Church which he should
afterwards preserve, will he not protect it for ever, even when men
shall think that it has perished? What happened? When Christ came, how
wretched was the dispersion, and how numerous and powerful were the
enemies that opposed him! Yet, in spite of them all, his kingdom was
raised up and established, the Church flourished, and drew universal
admiration. No one therefore ought to doubt that the Lord exerts his
power whenever it is necessary, and defends his Church against enemies,
and restores her.

<span id="xviii.i-p203"></span>*Jacob shall not now be ashamed.* He
means that it often happens that good men are constrained by shame to
hang down their heads, as Jeremiah declares in these words, “I will lay
my mouth in the dust.” (<span id="xviii.i-p203.1"></span>[La
3:29](../../../bib/kjv/lam003.htm#029.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p203.1"></span>.) Micah also says, “It is time that wise men
should hide their mouth in the dust.” (<span
id="xviii.i-p203.2"></span>[Mic
7:16](../../../bib/kjv/mic007.htm#016.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p203.2"></span>.)  <span id="fr_281"></span>[282](#fn_281.md)
For when the Lord chastises his people so severely, good men must be
“ashamed.” Now, the Prophet declares that this state of things will not
always last. We ought not to despair therefore in adversity. Though
wicked men jeer and cast upon us every kind of reproaches, yet the Lord
will at length free us from shame and disgrace. At the same time,
however, the Prophet gives warning that this favor does not belong to
proud or obstinate persons who refuse to bend their neck to God’s
chastisements, but only to the humble, whom shame constrains to hang
down their heads, and to walk sorrowful and downcast.

<span id="xviii.i-p205"></span>It may be asked, Why does he say, “Jacob
shall not be ashamed?” For “Jacob” had been long dead, and it might be
thought that he ascribed feeling to the dead, and supposed them to be
capable of knowing our affairs.  <span id="fr_282"></span>[283](#fn_282.md)
Hence also the Papists think that the dead are spectators of our
actions. But the present instance is a personification, such as we
frequently find in Scripture. In the same manner also Jeremiah says,

<span id="xviii.i-p207"></span>“In Ramah was heard the voice of Rachel
bewailing her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they are
not;”

<span id="xviii.i-p208"></span>for he describes the defeat of the tribe
of Benjamin by the wailing of “Rachel,” who was their remote ancestor.
(<span id="xviii.i-p208.1"></span>[Jer
31:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#015.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p208.1"></span>.)

<span id="xviii.i-p209"></span>Isaiah introduces Jacob as moved with
shame on account of the enormous crimes of his posterity; for Solomon
tells us that “a wise son is the glory of his father and a foolish son
brings grief and sorrow to his mother.” (<span
id="xviii.i-p209.1"></span>[Pr
10:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#001.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p209.1"></span>.) Though mothers bear much, still they blush
on account of the wicked actions of their children. What then shall be
the case with fathers, whose affection for their children is less
accompanied by foolish indulgence, and aims chiefly at training them to
good and upright conduct? Do they not on that account feel keener
anguish, when their children act wickedly and disgracefully? But here
the Prophet intended to pierce the hearts of the people and wound them
to the quick, by holding out to them their own patriarch, on whom God
bestowed blessings so numerous and so great, but who is now dishonored
by his posterity; so that if he had been present, he would have been
compelled to blush deeply on their account. He therefore accuses the
people of ingratitude, in bringing disgrace on their fathers whom they
ought to have honored.

<span id="xviii.i-p210"></span><span id="xviii.i-p210.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p211"></span>**23.** *Because, when he shall see his
children.* The particle <span id="xviii.i-p211.1"></span>כי (*kī*) is
here used in its natural and original meaning of *for* or *because*. The
Prophet assigns the reason why the disgrace of Israel shall be taken
away. It is, because he will have children, and those who were thought
to have perished will be still alive.

<span id="xviii.i-p212"></span>*The work of my hands in the midst of
him.* By giving them this name, he intended, I have no doubt, to
describe the astonishing work of redemption; for those whom God adopts
to be his children, and receives into fellowship with himself, are made
by him, as it were, new men, agreeably to that saying,

<span id="xviii.i-p213"></span>“And the people which shall be created
shall praise the Lord.” (<span id="xviii.i-p213.1"></span>[Ps
102:18](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#018.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p213.1"></span>.)

<span id="xviii.i-p214"></span>In that passage the Psalmist describes in
a similar manner the renewal of the Church; for this description, as we
have repeatedly stated on former occasions, does not relate to the
general creation which extends to all, but leads us to acknowledge his
power, that we may not judge of the salvation of the Church by the
present appearances of things. And here we ought to observe various
contrasts; first, between the ruinous condition of the Church and her
surpassing beauty, between her shame and her glory; secondly, between
the people of God and other nations; thirdly, between “the works of
God’s hands” and the works of men, (for by God’s hand alone can the
Church be restored;) and fourthly, between her flourishing condition and
the ruinous and desolate state to which she had formerly been reduced.
By the phrase, “in the midst of him,” is meant a perfect restoration, by
which the people shall be united and joined together in such a manner as
to occupy not only the extremities, but the very heart and the chief
places of the country.

<span id="xviii.i-p215"></span>*They shall hallow my name.* Last of all,
he points out the end of redemption. We were all created, that the
goodness of God might be celebrated among us. But as the greater part of
mankind have revolted from their original condition, God hath chosen a
Church in which his praises should resound and dwell, as the Psalmist
says, “Praise waiteth for thee in Zion.” (<span
id="xviii.i-p215.1"></span>[Ps
65:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa065.htm#001.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p215.1"></span>.) Now, since many even of the flock have
degenerated, the Prophet assigns this office to believers, whom God had
miraculously preserved.

<span id="xviii.i-p216"></span>*They shall fear the God of Israel.*
Because hypocrites, as we have formerly seen, honor God with their lips,
but are far removed from him in their heart, after speaking of the
ascription of praise, he next mentions *fear*; thus meaning that our
praises are reckoned of no value, unless we honestly and sincerely obey
God, and unless our whole life testify that we do not hypocritically
utter the name of God.

<span id="xviii.i-p217"></span><span id="xviii.i-p217.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p218"></span>**24.** *Then shall the erring in spirit
learn wisdom.* He again repeats that promise which he formerly noticed
briefly; for so long as the understandings of men shall be struck with
ignorance and blindness, even though they enjoy abundance of every kind
of blessings, yet they are always surrounded and besieged by ruin. In
making preparation for the restoration of the Church, the Lord therefore
enlightens by his word, and illuminates by the light of understanding,
his own people, who formerly wandered astray in darkness. He does this
by the secret influence of the Spirit; for it would be of little value
to be taught by the external word, if he did not also instruct our
hearts inwardly.

<span id="xviii.i-p219"></span>*And the murmurers shall learn doctrine.*
Some commentators translate <span id="xviii.i-p219.1"></span>רוגנים
(*rōgĕnīm*) “whisperers,” and others, “wanderers.” But it means that
those who formerly murmured against the prophets, and could not endure
their warnings, would be obedient and submissive; and therefore I have
chosen to render it *murmurers*. Hence we see how wonderful is the mercy
of God, who brings back into the path those who were highly unworthy,
and makes them partakers of so great blessings. Let us carefully ponder
this subject in private. Is there any one of us that has not sometimes
“murmured” against God, and despised pure doctrine? Nay, more, if God
had not softened the obstinate, and brought them mildly to obey, nearly
the whole human race would have perished in their madness.

<span id="xviii.i-p53"></span> “<span id="xviii.i-p53.1"></span>Il
l’appelle *Ariel*, c’est à dire, autel de Dieu;” — “He calls it *Ariel*,
that is, Altar of God.”

<span id="xviii.i-p54"></span> FT509 “Some, with the Chaldee, suppose it
to be taken from the hearth of the great altar of burnt-offerings, which
Ezekiel plainly calls by the same name; and that Jerusalem is here
considered as the seat of the fire of God, la <span
id="xviii.i-p54.1"></span>אור אל (ō*r ēl*,) which should issue from
thence to consume his enemies. Compare chap. <span
id="xviii.i-p54.2"></span>[Isa
31:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa031.htm#009.md)<span id="xviii.i-p54.2"></span>.
Some, according to the common derivation of the word, <span
id="xviii.i-p54.3"></span>ארי אל (ă*rīēl*,) the lion of God, or the
strong lion, suppose it to signify the strength of the place, by which
it was enabled to resist and overcome all its enemies.” — *Lowth*.
“Jonathan interprets it the altar of the Lord, and Ezekiel also (<span
id="xviii.i-p54.4"></span>[Eze
43:15](../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#015)<span id="xviii.i-p54.4"></span>.md)
gives it this name. It is so called, on account of the fire of God,
which couched like <span id="xviii.i-p54.5"></span>ארי (ă*rī*,) a lion
on the altar. Our Rabbins explain <span id="xviii.i-p54.6"></span>אריאל
(ă*rīēl*) to denote the temple of Jerusalem, which was narrow behind,
and broad in front.” — *Jarchi*. “The greater part of interpreters are
agreed, that <span id="xviii.i-p54.7"></span>אריאל (ă*rīēl*) compounded
of <span id="xviii.i-p54.8"></span>ארי (ă*rī*) and <span
id="xviii.i-p54.9"></span>אל (ē*l*,) denotes the lion of God, or, as
Castalio renders it, The Lion — God. But they differ in explaining the
application of this name to Jerusalem.” — *Rosenmüller*. “The meaning of
the Prophet, in my opinion, is, that ‘God will make Jerusalem the heart
of his anger, which shall consume not only the enemies but the obstinate
rebellious Jews.’ This meaning is elegant and emphatic, and agrees well
with the wisdom of the prophet Isaiah. Ariel is here taken, in its true
signification, not for the altar, but for the hearth of the altar, as in
Ezekiel. The import of the name lies here. The hearth of the altar
sustained the symbol of the most holy and pure will of God, by which all
the sacrifices offered to God must be tried; and to this applies the
justice of God, burning like a fire, and consuming the sinner, if no
atonement be found. Jerusalem would become the theater of the divine
judgments.” — *Vitringa*. “Isaiah foresees that the city will, in a
short time, be besieged by a very numerous army of the Assyrians, and
will be reduced to straits, and yet will not be vanquished by those
multitudes, but, like a lion, will rise by divine power out of the
severest encounters.” — *Doederlein*

<span id="xviii.i-p55"></span> FT510 Instead of “Let them kill
sacrifices,” Vitringa’s rendering, in which he has been followed by
Lowth, Stock, and Alexander, is, “Let the feasts revolve.” — *Ed*

<span id="xviii.i-p56"></span> FT511 Symmachus, on whom Montfaucon
bestows the exaggerated commendation of having adhered closely to the
Hebrew text, wherever it differed from the Septuagint, renders the
clause, <span id="xviii.i-p56.1"></span>καὶ ἐσταὶ κατώδυνος καὶ
ὀδυνωμένη, which has been closely followed by Jerome’s version, “<span
id="xviii.i-p56.2"></span>Et erit tristis ac moerens;” — “And she shall
be sad and sorrowful.” — *Ed*

<span id="xviii.i-p57"></span> FT512 In both cases there are two
synonyms, <span id="xviii.i-p57.1"></span>תאניה ואניה (*thăănīāh
văănīāh*,) which are derived from the same root. This peculiarity is
imitated by the version of Symmachus quoted above, <span
id="xviii.i-p57.2"></span>κατώδυνος καὶ ὀδυνωμένη, and by that of
Vitringa, (“<span id="xviii.i-p57.3"></span>mœstitia et mœror,”) who
remarks: “It is somewhat unusual to bring together words of the same
termination and derived from the same root, but in this instance it
produces an agreeable echo, which convinces me that it must have been
frequently employed in poetical writings.” — *Ed*

<span id="xviii.i-p58"></span> FT513 “<span
id="xviii.i-p58.1"></span>Que les ennemis feront en Jerusalem;” — “Which
the enemies shall make in Jerusalem.”

<span id="xviii.i-p59"></span> FT514 “Like a circle of tents. <span
id="xviii.i-p59.1"></span>נדור, (*kăddūr*,) like a *Dowar*; so the Arabs
call a circular village of tents, such as they still live in.” — *Stock*

<span id="xviii.i-p60"></span> FT515 “<span
id="xviii.i-p60.1"></span>Qu’ils parleront bas, et comme du creux de la
terre;” — “That they will speak low, and as out of the heart of the
earth.”

<span id="xviii.i-p61"></span> FT516 “And from the dust thou shalt chirp
thy words, or, utter a feeble, stridulous sound, such as the vulgar
supposed to be the voice of a ghost. This sound was imitated by
necromancers, who had also the art of pitching their voice in such a
manner as to make it appear to proceed out of the ground, or from what
place they chose.” — *Stock*

<span id="xviii.i-p62"></span> FT517 The Septuagint renders it, <span
id="xviii.i-p62.1"></span>καὶ ἔσται ὡς κονιορτὸς ἀπὸ τροχοὺ ὁ πλοῦτος
τῶν ἀσεβῶν, “and as the small dust from the wheel shall be the multitude
of the wicked.” Here it is necessary to attend to the distinction
between <span id="xviii.i-p62.2"></span>τρόχος and <span
id="xviii.i-p62.3"></span>τροχὸς — *Ed*

<span id="xviii.i-p63"></span> FT518 The military forces of Sennacherib,
which shall be fuel for the fire, and shall be reduced to powder.” —
*Jarchi*

<span id="xviii.i-p64"></span> FT519 “They shall be destroyed by the
pestilential blast *Simoom*, whose effects are instantaneous. Thevenot
describes this wind with all the circumstances here enumerated, with
thunder and lightning, insufferable heat, and a whirlwind of sand. By
such an ‘angel of Jehovah,’ as it is called below, (<span
id="xviii.i-p64.1"></span>[Isa
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#036.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p64.1"></span>,) was the host of Assyria destroyed.” —
*Stock*

<span id="xviii.i-p65"></span> FT520 “As a dream, when one thinks that
he sees, and yet does not in reality see, so shall be the multitude of
nations; they will indeed think that they are subduing the city of
Jerusalem, but they shall be disappointed of that hope, they shall not
succeed in it.” — *Jarchi*

<span id="xviii.i-p66"></span> FT521 The comparison is elegant and
beautiful in the highest degree, well wrought up, and perfectly suited
to the end proposed: the image is extremely natural, but not obvious; it
appeals to our inward feelings, not to our outward senses, and is
applied to an event in its concomitant circumstances exactly similar,
but in its nature totally different. For beauty and ingenuity it may
fairly come in competition with one of the most elegant of Virgil,
(greatly improved from Homer, Iliad, 22:199,) where he has applied to a
different purpose, but not so happily, the same image of the ineffectual
working of imagination in a dream. Virg. Æn. 12:908. Lucretius expresses
the very same image with Isaiah, (iv. 1091.)” — *Lowth*

<span id="xviii.i-p67"></span> FT522 “Cry ye out, and cry, *or*, Take
your pleasure and riot.” — Eng. Ver. “Turn yourselves and stare around.”
— *Stock*. Lowth’s rendering resembles this, but is somewhat
paraphrastic, “They stare with a look of stupid surprise.” Professor
Alexander’s comes nearer that of Calvin, “Be merry and blind!” — *Ed*

<span id="xviii.i-p68"></span> FT523 “Your prophets, and your rulers
(Heb. heads).” — Eng. Ver. Our translators very correctly state that the
literal meaning of <span id="xviii.i-p68.1"></span>רשיכם (*rāshēchĕm*)
is, “your heads.” Calvin treats it as an adjective, “your principal
seers.” — *Ed*

<span id="xviii.i-p128"></span> “The common version, *I am not learned*,
is too comprehensive and definite. A man might read a letter without
being learned, at least in the modern sense, although the word was once
the opposite of illiterate or wholly ignorant. In this case it is
necessary, to the full effect of the comparison, that the phrase should
be distinctly understood to mean, *I cannot read*.” — *Alexander*.

<span id="xviii.i-p129"></span> FT526 “<span
id="xviii.i-p129.1"></span>Par le jugement de Dieu;” — “By the judgment
of God.”

<span id="xviii.i-p130"></span> FT527 “Retirer.”

<span id="xviii.i-p131"></span> FT528 “<span

<span id="xviii.i-p132"></span> FT529 “<span

<span id="xviii.i-p133"></span> FT530 “I will proceed to do. (Heb. I

<span id="xviii.i-p135"></span> FT532 This corresponds with the English
version. — *Ed*

<span id="xviii.i-p136"></span> FT533 In almost all the ancient versions
<span id="xviii.i-p136.1"></span>הפככם, (*hŏphchĕchĕm*,) generally
rendered “your turning,” is construed as the nominative to the verb
“shall be.” Modern critics treat it as a separate clause, and
exclamation. “Perverse as ye are!” — *Lowth*. “Perverseness of yours!” —
*Stock*. “Your perversion!” — *Alexander*. The same meaning had been
brought out by Luther, though in a paraphrastic form, <span
id="xviii.i-p136.2"></span>*Wie seyb ihr so verfehrt*! “How are you so
perverse!” — *Ed*

<span id="xviii.i-p137"></span> FT534 This rendering is followed by
Lowth and Stock. “Ere Lebanon beams like Carmel. A mashal, or proverbial
saying, expressing any great revolution of things, and, when respecting
two subjects, an entire reciprocal change.” — *Lowth*. “And Lebanon
shall be turned into a Carmel. That which is now desert shall become a
fruitful field, and the reverse. Or, to quit the figure, the poor and
illiterate shall change conditions with the great ones and the wise of
this world, with respect to happiness, when the gospel shall be
promulgated.” — *Stock*. Jarchi, on the other hand, views “Carmel” as
meaning “a fruitful field,” and Alexander regards this point as decided
by the use of the article. “That <span id="xviii.i-p137.1"></span>הכרמל
(*hăkkărmĕl*) is not the proper name of the mountain, may be inferred
from the article, which is not prefixed to ‘Lebanon.’” “The mention of
the latter,” he adds, “no doubt suggested that of the ambiguous term
*Carmel*, which is both a proper name and an appellative.” — *Ed*

<span id="xviii.i-p138"></span> FT535 “<span
id="xviii.i-p138.1"></span>Ceux qui n’ont point honte de commettre leurs
meschancetez devant tous;” — “Those who are not ashamed to commit their
acts of wickedness in presence of all.”

<span id="xviii.i-p139"></span> FT536 “<span
id="xviii.i-p139.1"></span>Ceux qui se levoyent de matin pour mal
faire;” — “They who rose early to do evil.”

<span id="xviii.i-p140"></span> FT537 “<span
id="xviii.i-p140.1"></span>Il dit aussi que le juste est renversé sans
raison;” — “He says also, that the righteous man is overthrown without
any good reason.”

<span id="xviii.i-p141"></span> FT538 Both of the above quotations are
made inaccurately. The words of Jeremiah are, “He putteth his mouth in
the dust,” and of Micah, “They shall lay their hand upon their mouth.”
But while the Author, quoting from memory, has altered the words, the
passages are exceedingly apposite to his purpose. — *Ed*

<span id="xviii.i-p142"></span> FT539 “<span
id="xviii.i-p142.1"></span>Qu’ils peuvent savoir ce que nous faisons au
monde;” — “That they can know what we are doing in the world.”
