<span id="xxii-p1"></span>A TRANSLATION OF

<span id="xxii-p2"></span>CALVIN’S VERSION OF

<span id="xxii-p3"></span>THE PROPHECIES OF ISAIAH

<span id="xxii.i"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i-p2"></span>CHAPTERS 1—16

<span id="xxii.i.i"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.i-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 1

<span id="xxii.i.i-p3"></span>**1** The vision of Isaiah, the son of
Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of
Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p4"></span>**2** Hear, O heavens,  
And hearken, O earth,  
For thus the Lord speaketh:  
I have nourished and brought up children;  
Yet they have acted wickedly towards me.  <span
id="fr_346"></span>[347](#fn_346)

<span id="xxii.i.i-p6"></span>**3** The ox knoweth his owner,  
And the ass his masters crib;  
Israel doth not know;  
My people doth not understand.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p7"></span>**4** O sinful nation, a people laden with
iniquity,  
Seed of evil-doers, degenerate children!  
They have forsaken Jehovah,  
They have despised  <span id="fr_347"></span>[348](#fn_347) the Holy One
of Israel,  
They are estranged backwards.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p9"></span>**5** Why should I strike you any more?  
Ye will add faithlessness.  
The whole head is sickness,  
And the whole heart is faintness.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p10"></span>**6** From the sole of the foot even to
the head  
There is no soundness in it;  
A wound, a swelling, And a purifying sore;  
And they have not been plastered, nor bound up,  
Nor softened with ointment.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p11"></span>**7** Your country is desolation;  
Your cities are burnt with fire;  
Your land do strangers devour in your presence,  
It is reduced to solitude, like the destruction of foreigners.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p12"></span>**8** And the daughter of Zion shall be
left,  
As a cottage in a vineyard,  
As a lodge in a garden of cucumbers,  
As a city laid waste.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p13"></span>**9** Unless the Lord of hosts had left
us a very small remnant,  
We should have been as Sodom,  
And like Gomorrah.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p14"></span>**10** Hear the word of the Lord, ye
princes of Sodom!  
Give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah!  
Of what value to me is the multitude of your sacrifices?  
Saith the Lord.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p15"></span>**11** I am full of the burnt-offerings
of rams,  
And of the fat of fed beasts;  
And in the blood of oxen, or of sheep, or of he-goats,  
I delight not.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p16"></span>**12** When you come that you may appear
before my face,  
Who hath required this at your hand?  
Even to tread my courts.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p17"></span>**13** Do not continue to bring an
offering of vanity.  
Incense is an abomination to me.  
The new-moon, And the sabbath, And the yearly assemblies,  
I cannot endure,  
(It is a vain thing,)  
Nor the assembly.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p18"></span>**14** Your new-moons And your yearly
festivals  
My soul hateth;  
They have been a burden to me;  
I am weary of bearing them.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p19"></span>**15** When ye spread forth your hands,  
I will hide mine eyes from you.  
Even though you multiply prayer,  
I will not hear.  
Your hands are full of blood.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p20"></span>**16** Wash you, make you clean;  
Take away the wickedness of your practices from before mine eyes;  
Cease to do evil;

<span id="xxii.i.i-p21"></span>**17** Learn to do well:  
Seek judgment, restore  <span id="fr_348"></span>[349](#fn_348) the
oppressed;  
Plead for the orphan, defend the widow.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p23"></span>**18** Come now, and let us reason
together,  
Hath the Lord said:  
If your sins be as scarlet,  
They shall be white as snow;  
If they be red like purple,  
They shall be as wool.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p24"></span>**19** If ye shall be willing and shall
hearken,  
Ye shall eat the good of the land.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p25"></span>**20** But if ye shall refuse and
rebel,  
Ye shall be consumed by the sword;  
For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p26"></span>**21** How is the faithful city become a
harlot!  
She was full of judgment,  
And righteousness lodged by night  <span
id="fr_349"></span>[350](#fn_349) in her;  
But now murderers.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p28"></span>**22** Thy silver is become dross,  
And thy wine is mixed with water.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p29"></span>**23** Thy princes are rebellious,  
And are companions of thieves;  
Every one loveth a gift,  
And seeketh eagerly for rewards.  
They judge not the cause of the fatherless,  
Nor doth the cause of the widow come to them.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p30"></span>**24** Therefore saith the Lord,  <span
id="fr_350"></span>[351](#fn_350) Jehovah of hosts,  
The mighty One of Israel;  
Alas! I will take consolation on mine adversaries,  
I will be avenged of mine enemies.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p32"></span>**25** I will turn my hand upon thee;  
I will purely purge away thy dross,  
And I will take away all thy tin.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p33"></span>**26** And I will restore thy judges as
at the first,  
And thy counsellors as at the beginning.  
Then shall it be said of thee,  
The city of righteousness,  
The faithful city.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p34"></span>**27** Zion shall be redeemed with
judgment,  
And they who shall be brought back to her with righteousness.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p35"></span>**28** And the destruction of the
transgressors and of the sinners shall be together,  
And they who have revolted from the Lord shall be consumed.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p36"></span>**29** Yea, they shall be ashamed  
Of the trees which ye have desired,  
And they shall be covered with disgrace  
By the groves which ye have chosen.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p37"></span>**30** Ye shall surely be as a tree whose
leaf fadeth,  
And as a grove that hath no water.

<span id="xxii.i.i-p38"></span>**31** And your strong man  <span
id="fr_351"></span>[352](#fn_351) shall be as tow,  
And the maker of it as a spark;  
And they shall both be burnt,  
And there shall be none to quench them.

<span id="xxii.i.ii"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 2

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p3"></span>**1** The word which Isaiah, the son of
Amoz, saw concerning Judah And Jerusalem.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p4"></span>**2** And it shall come to pass in the
last of the days,  
That the mountain of the house of Jehovah  
Shall be established on the top of the mountains,  
And shall be exalted above the hills;  
And all nations shall flow to it.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p5"></span>**3** And many peoples shall come, and
shall say,  
Come, and we shall go up  
To the mountain of Jehovah,  
To the house of the God of Jacob;  
And he will teach us in his ways,  
And we shall walk in his paths;  
For out of Zion shall go forth the law,  
And the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p6"></span>**4** And he will judge among the
nations,  
And will rebuke many peoples:  
And they shall beat their swords into spades,  
And their spears into pruning-hooks;  
And nation shall not lift up sword against nation,  
Neither shall they practise war any more.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p7"></span>**5** O house of Jacob, come ye,  
And we shall walk in the light of the Lord.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p8"></span>**6** Verily thou hast forsaken thy
people, the house of Jacob;  
Because they are filled with the east  <span
id="fr_352"></span>[353](#fn_352)  
And with soothsayers, like the Philistines;  
And they have delighted in the children of foreigners.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p10"></span>**7** Their land is full of silver and
gold,  
And there is no end to their treasures.  
Their land is also full of horses,  
And there is no end to their chariots.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p11"></span>**8** Their land is also full of
idols,  
And they have bowed down  
Before the work of their own hands,  
Before that which their fingers have made.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p12"></span>**9** And the man of low degree boweth
down,  
And the man of rank humbleth himself;  
Therefore do not thou forgive them.  <span
id="fr_353"></span>[354](#fn_353)

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p14"></span>**10** Enter into the rock,  
Hide thee in the dust,  
From before the fear of the Lord  
And the glory of his majesty.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p15"></span>**11** The loftiness of the eyes of men
shall be humbled,  
And the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down;  
And Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p16"></span>**12** For the day of Jehovah of hosts
shall be  
On every one that is proud and lofty,  
And on all that is lifted up,  
And it shall be brought low.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p17"></span>**13** Even on all the cedars of Lebanon
high and lifted up,  
On all the oaks of Bashan,

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p18"></span>**14** And on all the lofty mountains,  
And on all the high hills,

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p19"></span>**15** And on every lofty tower,  
And on every fortified wall;

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p20"></span>**16** On all the ships of Tarshish,  
And on delightful pictures.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p21"></span>**17** And the loftiness of man shall be
bowed down,  
And the haughtiness of men shall be humbled;  
And Jehovah alone shall be exalted on that day.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p22"></span>**18** And he will utterly abolish the
idols.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p23"></span>**19** And they shall enter into caverns
of the rocks,  
And into clefts of the earth,  
From the presence of the terror of Jehovah,  
And from the glory of his majesty,  
When he shall arise to shake the earth.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p24"></span>**20** In that day shall a man cast
away  
His idols of silver,  
And his idols of gold,  
Which they made for him to worship,  
Into the cavern of the moles and of the bats;

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p25"></span>**21** And they shall enter into the
clefts of the rocks,  
And into the tops of the ragged rocks,  
From before the fear of the Lord,  
And from the glory of his majesty,  
When he shall arise to shake the earth.

<span id="xxii.i.ii-p26"></span>**22** Cease then from man,  
Whose breath is in his nostrils;  
For in what respect  <span id="fr_354"></span>[355](#fn_354) is he
valued?

<span id="xxii.i.iii"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 3

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p3"></span>**1** For, behold, the Governor, Jehovah
of hosts,  
Will take away from Jerusalem and Judah  
The stay and the strength;  
The whole stay of bread;  
The whole stay of water;

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p4"></span>**2** The strong man and the man of
war,  
The judge and the prophet,  
And the diviner and the elder;

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p5"></span>**3** The captain of fifty, and the man
of rank,  
The senator, and the skilful artificer, and the eloquent.  <span
id="fr_355"></span>[356](#fn_355)

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p7"></span>**4** And I will appoint boys to be
their rulers,  
And babes shall rule over them.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p8"></span>**5** The people shall violently oppress
each other,  
A man his neighbour;  
The youth shall behave insolently towards the old man,  
The despicable towards the honourable.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p9"></span>**6** When every man shall take hold of
his brother  
Of the family of his father, saying,  
Thou hast raiment;  
Be thou our ruler;  
Let this ruin be under thy hand;

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p10"></span>**7** He shall swear in that day,
saying,  
I will not be a healer;  
For in my house is neither bread nor raiment;  
Therefore make me not a ruler of the people.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p11"></span>**8** Verily Jerusalem is ruined,  
And Judah is fallen;  
Because their tongue And their practices are against Jehovah,  
To provoke the eyes of his glory.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p12"></span>**9** The proof of their countenance
answereth in them;  <span id="fr_356"></span>[357](#fn_356)  
They have declared their sin, as Sodom,  
And have not hid it.  
Wo to their soul!  
For they have brought evil on them.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p14"></span>**10** Say ye to the righteous man,  
It shall be well;  
For they shall eat the fruit of their hands.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p15"></span>**11** Wo to the wicked man!  
It shall be ill;  
For according to the works of his hands  
Shall it be rewarded to him.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p16"></span>**12** Of my people children are
oppressors,  
And women rule over them.  
O my people!  
They who govern thee lead thee astray,  
And pervert the way of thy paths.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p17"></span>**13** Jehovah standeth to plead,  
And standeth up to judge the people.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p18"></span>**14** Jehovah will enter into
judgment  
With the elders of his people,  
And with their rulers;  
And ye have destroyed the vineyard,  
And the spoil of the poor is in your houses.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p19"></span>**15** What mean ye that ye crush my
people,  
And grind the faces of the poor?  
Saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p20"></span>**16** Jehovah also saith,  
Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,  
And walk with stretched-forth neck,  
And with wandering eyes,  
And walk and mince as they go,  
And make a tinkling with their feet.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p21"></span>**17** Therefore will the Lord make
bald  
The crown of the head of the daughters of Zion,  
And the Lord will expose their shame.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p22"></span>**18** In that day will the Lord take
away  
Ornaments that tinkled, or were made of net-work, or like a half-moon,

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p23"></span>**19** Perfumes, bracelets, and
head-hands;

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p24"></span>**20** Bonnets, ornaments of the
legs,  
Chaplets, neck-amulets, and ear-rings;

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p25"></span>**21** Rings and nose-jewels,

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p26"></span>**22** Changeable dresses, mantles,  
Upper garments, and hair-ties,

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p27"></span>**23** Mirrors and fine linens,  
Hoods and veils.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p28"></span>**24** And instead of a sweet odour
there shall be rottenness,  
And instead of a girdle, a rent,  
And instead of curled locks, baldness;  
Instead of a belt, a girdle of sackcloth,  
Instead of beauty, burning.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p29"></span>**25** Thy men shall fall by the
sword,  
And thy might in the battle.

<span id="xxii.i.iii-p30"></span>**26** Her gates shall lament and
mourn,  
And she, desolate, shall sit on the ground.

<span id="xxii.i.iv"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.iv-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.iv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="xxii.i.iv-p3"></span>**1** In that day, therefore, shall seven
women  
Take hold of one man, saying,  
We will eat our own bread,  
We will wear our own raiment;  
Only let thy name be called on us,  <span
id="fr_357"></span>[358](#fn_357)  
And take thou away our reproach.

<span id="xxii.i.iv-p5"></span>**2** In that day shall the branch of
Jehovah  
Be for beauty and glory,  
And the fruit of the earth  
Be for excellence and comeliness,  
To the escaped of Israel.

<span id="xxii.i.iv-p6"></span>**3** And it shall come to pass  
That he who shall be left in Zion,  
And shall remain in Jerusalem,  
Shall be called holy,  
And all shall be enrolled  
Among the living  <span id="fr_358"></span>[359](#fn_358) at Jerusalem.

<span id="xxii.i.iv-p8"></span>**4** When the Lord shall have washed
away  
The filth of the daughter of Zion,  
And shall have cleansed the blood of Jerusalem  
From the midst of her,  
Both by the Spirit of judgment,  
And by the Spirit of burning.

<span id="xxii.i.iv-p9"></span>**5** And Jehovah will create  
On every dwelling-place of Mount Zion,  
And on all her assemblies,  
A cloud and darkness by day,  
And the brightness of a flaming fire by night;  
For on all the glory shall be a defence.

<span id="xxii.i.iv-p10"></span>**6** And a covering shall be by day  
For a shadow from the heat, and for refuge,  
And for a covert from storm and from rain.

<span id="xxii.i.v"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.v-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.v-p2"></span>CHAPTER 5

<span id="xxii.i.v-p3"></span>**1** Come, I will sing for my beloved  
A song of my beloved to his vineyard.  
My beloved had a vineyard  
On a hill, the son of oil.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p4"></span>**2** He fenced it, and gathered out the
stones,  
And planted it as a choice vine;  
He reared a tower in the midst of it,  
And built a wine-press in it:  
He therefore hoped that it would yield grapes,  
And it yieldeth wild grapes.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p5"></span>**3** Now then, O inhabitant of
Jerusalem,  
And man of Judah,  
Judge ye between me and my vineyard.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p6"></span>**4** What more ought to have been done to
my vineyard,  
Which I have not done to it?  
How did I look that it should yield grapes,  
And yet it hath yielded wild grapes?

<span id="xxii.i.v-p7"></span>**5** And now come, I will shew to you  
What I will do to my vineyard.  
I will take away its hedge, that it may become pasture;  
I will break down its wall, that it may be trodden down.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p8"></span>**6** I will lay it waste;  
It shall not be pruned nor digged;  
And the brier and thorn shall grow up.  
Yea, I will command the clouds  
That they do not rain on it.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p9"></span>**7** Verily the vineyard of Jehovah of
hosts is the house of Israel,  
And the men of Judah his pleasant plant.  
Hence he looked for judgment, and behold oppression;  
For righteousness, and behold a cry.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p10"></span>**8** Wo to them that join house to
house,  
And add field to field,  
Till there be no place;  
That you may be placed alone  
In the midst of the earth.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p11"></span>**9** This is in the ears of Jehovah of
hosts,  
If many houses be not laid desolate,  
Great and fair, without inhabitant.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p12"></span>**10** Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall
produce one bath,  
And the seed of a homer shall yield an ephah.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p13"></span>**11** Wo to them that rise early  
To follow drunkenness,  
And who prolong the time till night,  
While wine inflameth them.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p14"></span>**12** And the harp, the lyre, the
tabret, and the pipe, and wine  
Are in their entertainments;  
But they do not regard the work of Jehovah,  
Nor consider the operation of his hands.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p15"></span>**13** Therefore my people are gone into
captivity,  
Because they have no knowledge;  
And their glory are men famished,  
And their multitude are dried up with thirst.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p16"></span>**14** Therefore hell hath enlarged his
soul,  
And opened his mouth without measure;  
And his glory and his multitude hath descended,  
And his wealth, and he that rejoiced in her.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p17"></span>**15** And the man of low degree shall be
bowed down,  
And the man of rank shall be humbled;  
Yea, the eyes of the haughty shall be humbled.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p18"></span>**16** And Jehovah of hosts shall be
exalted in judgment,  
And God, who is holy, shall be sanctified in righteousness.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p19"></span>**17** And the lambs shall feed after
their manner,  
And the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p20"></span>**18** Wo to them that draw iniquity with
cords of vanity,  
And sin as with cart-ropes.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p21"></span>**19** Who say, Let him make speed, and
hasten his work,  
That we may see it;  
Let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come,  
That we may know it.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p22"></span>**20** Wo to them that call evil good,  
And good evil;  
That put darkness for light,  
And light for darkness;  
That turn bitter into sweet,  
And sweet into bitter.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p23"></span>**21** Wo to them that are wise in their
own eyes,  
And are prudent in their own sight.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p24"></span>**22** Wo to them that are powerful to
drink wine,  
And powerful men to mingle strong drink;

<span id="xxii.i.v-p25"></span>**23** Who justify the wicked for
reward,  
And take away the righteousness of the righteous from him.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p26"></span>**24** Therefore, as the tongue of fire
devoureth the stubble,  
And the chaff is consumed by the flame;  
So their root shall be as rottenness,  
And their blossom shall pass away as dust;  
Because they have cast away the law of Jehovah of hosts,  
And have loathed the word of the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p27"></span>**25** Therefore the anger of Jehovah  
Hath been kindled against his people,  
And, stretching forth his hand against them,  
He hath smitten them;  
And the mountains trembled,  
And their torn carcass was thrown into the midst of the streets;  
And for all these things his anger hath not been turned away,  
But his hand is stretched out still.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p28"></span>**26** And he will lift up an ensign to
the nations from afar;  
He will hiss to the nation from the end of the earth;  
And lo, it will come speedy and swift.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p29"></span>**27** None shall be weary nor stumble
among them;  
None shall slumber nor sleep;  
None shall have the girdle of their loins loosed,  
Nor shall the latchet of their shoes be broken.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p30"></span>**28** Their arrows will be sharp,  
And all their bows bent.  
The hoofs of their horses shall be counted as flint,  
And their wheels as a whirlwind.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p31"></span>**29** Their roaring shall be like that
of a lion;  
They shall roar like young lions;  
They shall gnash and seize the prey;  
They shall carry away the spoils,  
And none shall deliver.

<span id="xxii.i.v-p32"></span>**30** He shall roar against them in that
day, as the roaring of the sea;  
Then shall he look to the earth,  
And behold! the darkness of tribulation;  
And the light shall be darkened in the heavens.

<span id="xxii.i.vi"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p2"></span>CHAPTER 6

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p3"></span>**1** In the year that King Uzziah died,
I saw the Lord sitting on a throne high and lifted up, and his remotest
parts filled the temple.

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p4"></span>**2** And seraphim stood above it;  
Each had six wings;  
With two they covered their face,  
With two they covered their feet,  
And with two did they fly.

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p5"></span>**3** And one cried to another, saying,  
Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts;  
The whole earth is full of his glory.

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p6"></span>**4** And the posts of the doors were
moved by the voice of him that cried,  
And the house was filled with smoke.

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p7"></span>**5** Then I said,  
Wo to me, for I am undone;  <span id="fr_359"></span>[360](#fn_359)  
Because I am a man of polluted lips,  
And I dwell amidst a people having polluted lips;  
And yet mine eyes have seen the king, Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p9"></span>**6** And one of the seraphim flew to me,
having in his hand a live coal, snatched with a fork from the altar.

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p10"></span>**7** And laying it on my mouth, he
said,  
Lo, this hath touched thy lips,  
And thy sin shall be expiated.

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p11"></span>**8** Afterwards I heard the voice of
the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send? And who shall go for us? Then I
said, Here am I, send me.

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p12"></span>**9** Then he said,  
Go and tell this people:  
Hearing hear, and do not understand;  
Seeing see, and do not know.

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p13"></span>**10** Harden the heart of this
people,  
And make heavy their ears,  
And close up their eyes;  
Lest they see with their eyes,  
And hear with their ears,  
And their heart understand,  
And when they have been converted, they be healed.

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p14"></span>**11** And I said, how long, O Lord. And
he said,  
Till the houses be laid waste without inhabitant,  
And the houses be emptied of men,  
And the land be reduced to solitude;

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p15"></span>**12** Till God have removed men far
away,  
And till there be great desolation in the midst of the land:

<span id="xxii.i.vi-p16"></span>**13** Till a tenth shall return,  
And be destroyed like a teil and an oak,  
Whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves;  
So in it shall the substance be the holy seed.

<span id="xxii.i.vii"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 7

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p3"></span>**1** It came to pass, in the days of
Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin,
the king of Syria, and Pekah, the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went
up against Jerusalem, to besiege it, but could not overcome it.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p4"></span>**2** And it was told the house of
David, saying, Syria is allied with Ephraim; and his heart was moved, as
when the trees of the forest are moved by the wind.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p5"></span>**3** Then said Jehovah to Isaiah, Go
out to meet Ahaz, thou and Shearjashub, thy son, at the end of the
conduit of the upper pool, at the road of the fullers field.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p6"></span>**4** And thou shalt say to him:  
Take heed, and be quiet;  
Fear not, and let not thy heart be soft,  
For the two tails of those smoking firebrands,  
For the fierceness of the anger of Rezin the Syrian,  
And of the son of Remaliah.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p7"></span>**5** Because the Syrian hath taken
wicked counsel against thee  
With Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, saying:

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p8"></span>**6** Let us go up against Judah, and
harass it,  
And let us open it for us;  
And let us appoint a king in the midst of it,  
The son of Tabeal.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p9"></span>**7** Thus hath the Lord Jehovah said,  
It shall not stand, and shall not be,

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p10"></span>**8** For the head of Syria is
Damascus,  
And the head of Damascus is Rezin;  
And within sixty-five years shall be broken  
Ephraim, that it be not a people.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p11"></span>**9** Yet the head of Ephraim is
Samaria,  
And the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.  
If ye do not believe,  
Surely ye shall not stand.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p12"></span>**10** And Jehovah added to speak to
Ahaz, saying:

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p13"></span>**11** Ask thee a sign from Jehovah thy
God,  
By asking in the deep,  
Or in the height above.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p14"></span>**12** And Ahaz said, I will not ask,
and I will not tempt the Lord.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p15"></span>**13** And he said,  
Hear now, O house of David!  
Is it a small thing for you to weary men,  
If ye do not also weary my God?

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p16"></span>**14** Therefore will the Lord himself
give you a sign:  
Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son,  
And shall call his name Immanuel.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p17"></span>**15** Butter and honey shall he eat,  
Till he know to refuse the evil,  
And to choose the good.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p18"></span>**16** And before the child shall
know  
To refuse the evil and choose the good,  
Forsaken shall be the land which thou hatest  
By both her kings.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p19"></span>**17** Jehovah will bring upon thee,  
And on thy people, and on thy fathers house,  
Days which have not come  
Since the day of the revolt of Ephraim from Judah,  
The king of Assyria.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p20"></span>**18** It shall be in that day, Jehovah
shall hiss  
For the fly, which is in the extremity of the rivers of Egypt,  
And for the bee which is in the land of Assyria.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p21"></span>**19** And they shall all of them come
and rest  
In the desolate valleys, and in the caverns of the rocks,  
And on all thorns, and on all bushes.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p22"></span>**20** In that day shall Jehovah shave
with a hired razor,  
By those who are beyond the river, by the king of Assyria,  
The head and the hair of the feet;  
And shall also take away the beard.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p23"></span>**21** And it shall be in that day,
that a man shall nourish  
A young cow and two sheep.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p24"></span>**22** And it shall come to pass,  
That, on account of the abundance of milk which they shall yield,  
He shall eat butter.  
Yea, butter and honey shall every one eat  
That shall be left in the midst of the land.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p25"></span>**23** It shall also be in that day,  
That, wherever there are a thousand vines,  
They shall be sold for a thousand pieces of silver,  
On account of thorns and briers.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p26"></span>**24** With arrows and bow shall they
come thither,  
Because thorns and briers shall be throughout all the land.

<span id="xxii.i.vii-p27"></span>**25** And on all the mountains which
are dug with the hoe  
Thither shall not come the dread of thorns and briers;  
But they shall be laid out for pasture to the cattle,  
And shall be trodden by the flocks.

<span id="xxii.i.viii"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 8

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p3"></span>**1** And Jehovah said to me: Take thee
a large roll, and write in it with an ordinary pen:  <span
id="fr_360"></span>[361](#fn_360) Make speed to spoil, hasten to the
prey.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p5"></span>**2** And I took unto me faithful
witnesses, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p6"></span>**3** And I approached the prophetess,
who conceived and bare a son. And Jehovah spake to me:  
Call his name,  
Make speed to spoil,  
Hasten to the prey.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p7"></span>**4** Verily before the child shall
know  
To cry, My father and my mother,  
The riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria  
Shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p8"></span>**5** Moreover, Jehovah spoke unto me,
saying again:

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p9"></span>**6** Because this people hath
refused  
The waters of Shiloah, which flow softly,  
And hath rejoiced in Rezin and the son of Remaliah:

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p10"></span>**7** Therefore, behold, the Lord
bringeth upon them  
The waters of the river, rapid and strong,  
The king of Assyria and all his force;  
And he shall come up over all his channels,  
And shall pass over all his banks.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p11"></span>**8** And, crossing over into Judah,  
He shall overflow and pass over;  
He shall reach even to the neck;  
And the stretching out of his wings shall fill  
The breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p12"></span>**9** Associate yourselves, ye
peoples,  
And ye shall be broken in pieces;  
Give ear, all ye that are from a distant land.  
Gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces;  
Gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p13"></span>**10** Take counsel together, and it
shall be disannulled;  
Decree a decree, and it shall not stand;  
For God is with us.  <span id="fr_361"></span>[362](#fn_361)

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p15"></span>**11** For thus did Jehovah speak to
me, as if seizing  <span id="fr_362"></span>[363](#fn_362) my hand,  
And taught me not to go in the way of this people, saying,

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p17"></span>**12** Say ye not, A confederacy,  
In all things in which this people saith, A confederacy;  
And fear not their fear,  
Nor be ye afraid.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p18"></span>**13** Sanctify Jehovah of hosts
himself;  
And let him be your fear,  
And let him be your dread.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p19"></span>**14** Then shall he be for a
sanctuary;  
A stone of stumbling and rock of destruction  
To the two houses of Israel;  
A net and a snare  
To the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p20"></span>**15** And many among them shall
stumble, and fall,  
And shall be bruised, snared, and taken.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p21"></span>**16** Bind up the testimony;  
Seal the law among my disciples.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p22"></span>**17** Therefore will I wait for
Jehovah,  
Who hideth his face from the house of Jacob,  
And I will look for him.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p23"></span>**18** Behold I, and the children whom
Jehovah hath given me,  
Are for signs and wonders in Israel,  
From Jehovah of hosts,  
Who dwelleth in Mount Zion.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p24"></span>**19** And if they shall say to you,  
Inquire at soothsayers and diviners,  
Who whisper and mutter;  
Should not a people ask counsel of their God?  
From the living to the dead?

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p25"></span>**20** To the law and to the
testimony:  
If they have not spoken according to this word,  
It is because there is no light in them.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p26"></span>**21** Then shall they pass through
this land distressed and hungry,  
And it shall happen that, when they are hungry, they shall fret,  
And shall curse their king and their God, looking upward.

<span id="xxii.i.viii-p27"></span>**22** And when they shall look to the
earth,  
Lo, trouble and darkness, dimness and distress,  
And they shall be driven to gloominess.

<span id="xxii.i.ix"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p2"></span>CHAPTER 9

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p3"></span>**1** Yet the darkness shall not be,  
According to the affliction which happened to her,  
When they first lightly afflicted  
The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali;  
Nor when they afterwards did more grievously afflict  
By the way of the sea beyond Jordan,  
In Galilee of the nations.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p4"></span>**2** The people walking in darkness  
Hath seen a great light.  
They who dwelt in the land of the shadow of death,  
Light hath shined on them.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p5"></span>**3** By multiplying the nation thou hast
not increased the joy;  
They have rejoiced before thee according to the joy of harvest,  
As men shout in dividing the spoils.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p6"></span>**4** For his burdensome yoke,  
And the staff of his shoulder,  
The sceptre of his oppressor  
Hast thou broken, as in the day of Midian.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p7"></span>**5** Although every battle of the
warrior is made  
With noise and rolling of the vesture in blood,  
This shall be for burning,  
For fuel of fire.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p8"></span>**6** For to us a child is born;  
To us a son is given;  
And the government hath been laid upon his shoulder;  
And his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor,  
The mighty God, The Father of the age, The Prince of Peace.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p9"></span>**7** To the increase of the government
and to peace,  
There shall be no end;  
On the throne of David and on his kingdom,  
To order and establish it  
In judgment and justice,  
Henceforth, even for ever.  
The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will do this.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p10"></span>**8** The Lord sent a word against
Jacob,  
And it hath fallen on Israel.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p11"></span>**9** And all the people shall know,  
Ephraim, and the inhabitants of Samaria,  
Who say in the pride and haughtiness of their heart,

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p12"></span>**10** The bricks are fallen down, and
we will build with hewn stones;  
The sycamores are cut down, and we will substitute cedars.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p13"></span>**11** But Jehovah will strengthen the
enemies of Rezin against him,  
And will aid his adversaries.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p14"></span>**12** Syria before, and the Philistines
behind;  
And they shall devour Israel with open mouth.  
And for all this his anger is not turned away,  
But his hand is stretched out still.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p15"></span>**13** But the people have not turned to
him that smote them,  
And have not sought Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p16"></span>**14** Therefore will Jehovah cut off
from Israel  
The head and the tail,  
The branch and the reed,  
In one day.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p17"></span>**15** The elder and the honourable, he
is the head;  
And the prophet who teacheth falsehood, he is the tail.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p18"></span>**16** For the governors of this people
are seducers,  
And they who are guided by them are destroyed.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p19"></span>**17** Therefore the Lord will not
rejoice over their young men,  
And will not have compassion on the orphans and widows;  
For all are hypocrites and evil-doers,  
And every mouth speaketh villany.  
For all this his anger is not turned away,  
But his hand is stretched out still.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p20"></span>**18** For wickedness burneth as the
fire;  
It shall devour the briers and thorns;  
Afterwards it shall kindle into the thickets of the forest,  
And the smoke of that which ascendeth shall go up.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p21"></span>**19** Through the wrath of Jehovah of
hosts  
Shall the land be darkened,  
And the people shall be as the fuel of fire:  
No man shall spare his brother.

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p22"></span>**20** Every one shall snatch on the
right hand, and be hungry;  
He shall eat on the left hand, and shall not be satisfied;  
Every one shall devour the flesh of his own arm:

<span id="xxii.i.ix-p23"></span>**21** Manasseh, Ephraim;  
And Ephraim, Manasseh;  
They together shall be against Judah.  
And yet for all this his anger is not turned away,  
But his hand is stretched out still.

<span id="xxii.i.x"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.x-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.x-p2"></span>CHAPTER 10

<span id="xxii.i.x-p3"></span>**1** Wo to them that decree unrighteous
decrees,  
And who prescribing prescribe injustice:

<span id="xxii.i.x-p4"></span>**2** To keep back the poor from
judgment,  
And to take away the right from the poor of my people,  
To defraud the widows,  
And to plunder the orphans.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p5"></span>**3** And what will ye do in the day of
visitation?  
And when the desolation shall come from afar,  
To whom will ye flee for aid?  
And where will ye deposit  <span id="fr_363"></span>[364](#fn_363) your
glory?

<span id="xxii.i.x-p7"></span>**4** Unless  <span
id="fr_364"></span>[365](#fn_364) they shall stumble among the
vanquished,  
And shall fall down among the slain.  
For all this his anger shall not be turned away,  
And his hand is stretched out still.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p9"></span>**5** O Assyrian! the rod of mine anger!  
And the very staff in their hand is my wrath.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p10"></span>**6** Against a hypocritical nation will
I send him,  
And against the people of my indignation will I command him,  
To seize the prey,  
To carry off the spoils,  
And to tread him down as the mire of the streets.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p11"></span>**7** Yet will he not so intend,  
Nor will his heart think so;  
For it will be in his heart to destroy,  
And to cut off nations not a few.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p12"></span>**8** For he saith, Are not my princes
also kings?

<span id="xxii.i.x-p13"></span>**9** Is not Calno as Carchemish?  
Is not Hamath as Arpad?  
Is not Samaria as Damascus?

<span id="xxii.i.x-p14"></span>**10** As my hand hath found the kingdoms
of the idols,  
For their graven images excelled Jerusalem and Samaria.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p15"></span>**11** As I have done to Samaria and her
idols,  
Shall I not do so to Jerusalem and her idols?

<span id="xxii.i.x-p16"></span>**12** But it shall come to pass,  
When the Lord shall have performed his whole work  
In mount Zion and Jerusalem,  
I will punish the fruit of the haughtiness of the heart of the king of
Assyria,  
And the glory of the loftiness of his eyes.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p17"></span>**13** For he saith, By the strength of
my hand have I done it;  
And by my wisdom; for I am sagacious;  
And therefore have I removed the boundaries of the peoples,  
And have plundered their treasures,  
And have brought down the inhabitants, like a mighty man.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p18"></span>**14** And my hand hath found as a nest
the riches of the peoples;  
And as eggs which have been left are gathered,  
So have also I gathered the whole earth;  
And there was none that moved the wing,  
Or opened the mouth, or chirped.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p19"></span>**15** Shall the axe boast against him
that heweth with it?  
Shall the saw magnify itself against him that moveth it?  
Like the rising up of a rod against him that raiseth it,  
Like the risings up of a staff, as if it were not wood.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p20"></span>**16** Therefore will the Governor,
Jehovah of hosts, send  
Against his fat ones leanness,  
And under his glory will kindle  
A burning, like the burning of a fire.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p21"></span>**17** And the light of Israel shall
become a fire,  
And his Holy One shall become a flame;  
And it shall burn and devour  
His briers and thorns in one day.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p22"></span>**18** The glory of his forest and of his
fruitful field,  
From the soul even to the flesh, will he consume;  
And it shall be as the fainting of a standard-bearer.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p23"></span>**19** And the remains of the wood of his
forest  
Shall become a number,  
Such that a child may count them.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p24"></span>**20** It shall be in that day,  
The remnant of Israel,  
And they that are left of the house of Jacob,  
Shall not add to rely on him that smote them;  
For they shall rely on Jehovah,  
The Holy One of Israel, in truth.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p25"></span>**21** The remnant shall return, the
remnant of Jacob,  
To the mighty God.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p26"></span>**22** For if thy people Israel be as the
sand of the sea,  
A remnant of it shall return.  
The consumption decreed overfloweth righteousness.  <span
id="fr_365"></span>[366](#fn_365)

<span id="xxii.i.x-p28"></span>**23** For a consumption and
consummation  
Doth the Lord Jehovah of hosts make  
In the midst of all the land.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p29"></span>**24** Therefore thus saith Jehovah of
hosts:  
O my people, the inhabitants of Zion,  
Fear not the Assyrian.  
He will smite thee with a rod,  
And will lift up his staff against thee,  
After the pattern of Egypt.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p30"></span>**25** But yet a little while,  
And my rage and indignation  
Shall be discharged in their destruction.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p31"></span>**26** And Jehovah of hosts will stir up
a scourge against him,  
According to the slaughter of Midian on the rock Oreb;  
And his rod shall be on the sea,  
And he will lift it up after the pattern of Egypt.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p32"></span>**27** And it shall come to pass in that
day,  
That his burden shall be removed from thy shoulder,  
And his yoke from thy neck;  
And the yoke shall be destroyed  
From the face of the anointing.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p33"></span>**28** He is come to Aiath; he hath
passed to Migron;  
At Michmash he will lay up thy baggage.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p34"></span>**29** They have crossed the ford; they
have lodged by night at Geba;  
Ramah is terrified; Gibeah of Saul hath fled.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p35"></span>**30** Neigh with thy voice, O daughter
of Gallim!  
Cause it to be heard at Laish, O poor Anathoth.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p36"></span>**31** Madmenah is removed;  
The inhabitants of Gebim have gathered themselves.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p37"></span>**32** Yet a day, when he shall remain at
Nob,  
He will lift up his hand  
Against the mount of the daughter of Zion,  
The hill of Jerusalem.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p38"></span>**33** Behold! The Lord Jehovah of
hosts  
Will cut off the branch with terror;  <span
id="fr_366"></span>[367](#fn_366)  
And the lofty of stature shall be cut down,  
And the haughty shall be brought low.

<span id="xxii.i.x-p40"></span>**34** And he will cut down the thickets
of the forest with iron,  
And Lebanon shall fall violently.

<span id="xxii.i.xi"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p2"></span>CHAPTER 11

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p3"></span>**1** But a branch shall spring from the
stock of Jesse,  
And a sprout from his roots shall yield fruit.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p4"></span>**2** And the Spirit of Jehovah shall
rest upon him,  
The Spirit of wisdom and understanding,  
The Spirit of counsel and strength,  
The Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah;

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p5"></span>**3** And will make him sagacious in the
fear of Jehovah;  
Not according to the sight of his eyes shall he judge,  
Nor according to the hearing of his ears shall he reprove.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p6"></span>**4** For in righteousness he shall judge
the poor,  
And in equity shall he reprove for the meek of the earth;  
And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth,  
And with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p7"></span>**5** And righteousness shall be the belt
of his loins,  
And faithfulness the belt of his reins.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p8"></span>**6** The wolf shall dwell with the
lamb,  
And the leopard shall lie down with the kid;  
The calf, and the lion, and the fatling together;  
And a little child shall lead them.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p9"></span>**7** The cow and the bear shall feed;  
Their young ones shall lie down together;  
And the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p10"></span>**8** And the child shall play on the
hole of the asp,  
And on the dell of the basilisk shall the weaned child lay his hand.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p11"></span>**9** They shall not hurt, nor do
injury,  
In all the mountain of my holiness;  
For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of Jehovah,  
As with waters that cover the sea.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p12"></span>**10** And it shall be in that day, The
root of Jesse,  
Which shall stand for an ensign of the peoples,  
Shall be sought by the nations;  
And his rest shall be glory.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p13"></span>**11** And it shall be in that day,  
The Lord will again apply his hand,  
To recover the remnant of his people, which shall be left,  
From Assyria, and from Egypt, from Parthia,  
From Arabia, from Ethiopia, from Persia,  
From Chaldea, from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p14"></span>**12** And he shall lift up an ensign to
the nations,  
And shall gather the outcasts of Israel,  
And shall gather the dispersed of Judah,  
From the four corners of the earth.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p15"></span>**13** And the envy of Ephraim shall
depart,  
And the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off.  
Ephraim shall not envy Judah,  
And Judah shall not vex Ephraim.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p16"></span>**14** But they shall fly on the
shoulders of the Philistines to the west;  
They shall plunder together the children of the east;  
Edom and Moab shall be the stretching out of their hands,  
And the children of Ammon shall be their obedience.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p17"></span>**15** And Jehovah shall utterly
destroy  
The tongue of the Egyptian sea;  
And he shall lift up his hand on the river  
By the might of his wind;  
And he shall smite it in the seven streams,  
And shall make them to be shod with shoes.

<span id="xxii.i.xi-p18"></span>**16** And there shall be a path for the
remnant of his people,  
Which shall be left from Assyria,  
As there was to Israel,  
In the day when he came up out of the land of Egypt.

<span id="xxii.i.xii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.xii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 12

<span id="xxii.i.xii-p3"></span>**1** And in that day thou shalt say:  
I will sing to thee, O Jehovah;  
Though thou wast angry with me,  
Thine anger is turned away, and thou hast comforted me.

<span id="xxii.i.xii-p4"></span>**2** Behold! God is my salvation;  
I will trust, and not be afraid;  
For God Jehovah is my strength and song;  
And he hath become  <span id="fr_367"></span>[368](#fn_367) my
salvation.

<span id="xxii.i.xii-p6"></span>**3** Ye shall draw waters with joy  
From the fountains of the Saviour.  <span
id="fr_368"></span>[369](#fn_368)

<span id="xxii.i.xii-p8"></span>**4** And in that day shall ye say:  
Sing to Jehovah; call upon his name;  
Make known his works among the peoples;  
Proclaim that his name is exalted.

<span id="xxii.i.xii-p9"></span>**5** Sing to Jehovah;  
For he hath done glorious things;  
And this hath been made known throughout all the earth.

<span id="xxii.i.xii-p10"></span>**6** Shout and sing,  
O inhabitress of Zion!  
For great in the midst of thee,  
Is the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 13

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p3"></span>**1** The burden of Babylon, which
Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p4"></span>**2** On a lofty mountain lift up a
banner;  
Raise the voice to them; shake the hand;  
That they may enter into the gates of the nobles.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p5"></span>**3** I have commanded my sanctified
ones;  
And for mine anger have I also called my mighty ones,  
Who rejoice in my glory.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p6"></span>**4** The noise of a multitude in the
mountains,  
As of a great people;  
The noise of the sound of kingdoms,  
Of nations gathered together;  
Jehovah of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p7"></span>**5** Coming from a distant land,  
From the end of heaven,  
Jehovah and the vessels of his anger,  
To destroy the whole land.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p8"></span>**6** Howl ye, for the day of Jehovah
is at hand;  
As destruction from the Strong One  <span
id="fr_369"></span>[370](#fn_369) shall it come.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p10"></span>**7** Therefore shall all hands be
weakened,  
And every heart of man shall melt.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p11"></span>**8** And they shall be afraid;  
Pangs And sorrows shall take hold of them;  
They shall be in pain like a woman in labour;  
Every one shall be amazed at his neighbour;  
Their faces shall be faces of flames.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p12"></span>**9** Behold! the day of Jehovah shall
come cruel;  
Even indignation and the burning of anger,  
To lay the land desolate,  
And to destroy the sinners thereof out of it.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p13"></span>**10** Therefore the stars of heaven,
and the constellations,  
Shall not give their light;  
The sun shall be darkened in his going forth,  
And the moon shall not give forth her brightness.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p14"></span>**11** And I will visit upon the world
wickedness,  
And upon the wicked their iniquity;  
And I will cause the arrogance of the proud to cease,  
And I will lay low the loftiness of tyrants.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p15"></span>**12** I will make a mortal more
precious than fine gold,  
And a man than the weight of the gold of Ophir.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p16"></span>**13** Therefore I will shake the
heavens,  
And the earth shall be moved out of its place,  
In the indignation of Jehovah of hosts,  
And in the day of the fierceness of his anger.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p17"></span>**14** And it shall be as a chased
roe,  
And a sheep which no man taketh up;  
Every one shall look to his own people,  
And every one shall flee to his own land.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p18"></span>**15** Every one that is found shall
be pierced through,  
And every one that is joined to them shall fall by the sword.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p19"></span>**16** Their infants shall be dashed
in pieces before their eyes;  
Their houses shall be plundered,  
And their wives shall be ravished.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p20"></span>**17** Behold! I raise up against you
the Medes,  
Who shall not think of silver,  
And shall not desire even gold.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p21"></span>**18** And with their bows shall they
dash in pieces the children;  
They shall not pity the fruit of the womb,  
Nor shall their eye spare children.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p22"></span>**19** And Babylon, the glory of
kingdoms,  
And the ornament of the brightness of the Chaldeans,  
Shall be like God’s overthrowing of Sodom And Gomorrah.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p23"></span>**20** Never shall it be inhabited any
more,  
Nor shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation;  
Nor shall the Arabian pitch his tent there,  
Nor shall the shepherds make their flocks to lie down there.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p24"></span>**21** But the Ziim shall lie down
there;  
And their houses shall be full of Ohim;  
There shall the daughters of the ostrich dwell,  
And there shall the satyrs dance.

<span id="xxii.i.xiii-p25"></span>**22** And Iim shall cry in their
splendid houses,  
And dragons in their delightful palaces;  
And her time is near at hand,  
And her days shall not be prolonged.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 14

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p3"></span>**1** Jehovah will now pity Jacob,  
And will yet choose Israel,  
And will cause them to rest in their own land;  
And the stranger shall be joined to them;  
They shall be allied to the house of Jacob.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p4"></span>**2** And the peoples shall take them,  
And shall bring them to their own place,  
And in the land of Jehovah shall the house of Israel  
Possess them for servants and for handmaids;  
And they shall take them whose captives they were,  
And shall rule over their oppressors.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p5"></span>**3** And it shall be in the day,  
When Jehovah shall have given thee rest  
From thy labour,  
And from thy trembling,  
And from the hard bondage which had been laid on thee.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p6"></span>**4** Then against the king of Babylon  
Shalt thou take up this proverb, and shalt say,  
How hath the oppressor ceased!  
How hath the city covetous of gold ceased!

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p7"></span>**5** Jehovah hath broken the staff of
the wicked,  
The sceptre of the rulers,

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p8"></span>**6** Which smote the nations in
anger,  
With an incurable wound;  
Which ruled over the nations with anger;  
If any one suffered persecution,  
He did not hinder it.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p9"></span>**7** The whole earth is at rest, and is
quiet;  
They have sung praise.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p10"></span>**8** Yea, the fir-trees rejoice over
thee,  
And the cedars of Lebanon:  
Since thou art laid down,  
No feller hath come up against us.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p11"></span>**9** Hell from beneath is moved on
account of thee;  
To meet thy coming  
He hath stirred up the dead for thee,  
And hath made to rise from their thrones  
All the leaders of the earth,  
All the kings of the nations.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p12"></span>**10** All shall speak, and say to
thee:  
Art thou also become weak as we?  
And art thou become like to us?

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p13"></span>**11** In the grave is laid thy
splendour,  
And the noise of thine instruments of music;  
The worm is spread under thee,  
And reptiles cover thee.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p14"></span>**12** How art thou fallen from
heaven,  
O Lucifer, son of the dawn!  
How art thou thrown down to the earth,  
That didst cast the lot upon the nations!  <span
id="fr_370"></span>[371](#fn_370)

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p16"></span>**13** But thou saidst in thy heart,  
I will ascend to heaven;  
In high places near the stars of God  
Will I place my throne,  
And will sit on the mountain of the testimony,  
On the sides of the north.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p17"></span>**14** I will ascend above the heights
of the clouds,  
And will be like the Most High.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p18"></span>**15** But thou art brought down to the
grave,  
To the sides of the pit.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p19"></span>**16** They that see thee shall bend
forward,  
And shall view thee attentively.  
Is this the man that made the earth to tremble?  
That shook the kingdoms?

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p20"></span>**17** That made the world as a
wilderness;  
That destroyed its cities?  
That opened not the house to his prisoners?

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p21"></span>**18** All the kings of the nations,
all of them,  
Lie in glory, each in his own house.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p22"></span>**19** But thou art cast out of thy
grave,  
As an abominable branch,  
As the garments of the slain  
Who were killed with the sword,  
Who go down to the pit;  
As a carcase trodden under foot.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p23"></span>**20** Thou shalt not be joined with
them in burial;  
Because thou hast laid waste thy land,  
Thou hast slain thy people;  
The seed of wicked men shall not be continually remembered.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p24"></span>**21** Prepare slaughter for his
children,  
For the iniquity of their fathers;  
That they may not rise, and possess the land,  
And fill the face of the world with cities.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p25"></span>**22** For I will rise up against them,
saith Jehovah of hosts,  
And the name and the remnant,  
The son and the grandson,  
Will I cut off, saith Jehovah.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p26"></span>**23** And I will make it to be a
possession of the hedgehog,  
And pools of water;  
And I will sweep it with a besom, emptying it,  
Saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p27"></span>**24** Jehovah of hosts hath sworn,
saying,  
If it hath not been as I thought,  
And if it shall not stand as I purposed,

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p28"></span>**25** That in my land I will crush the
Assyrian,  
And on my mountains will tread him under foot;  
And that his yoke shall depart from them,  
And his burden be removed from their shoulder.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p29"></span>**26** This is the purpose which is
purposed on the whole earth;  
And this hand is stretched out on all the nations.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p30"></span>**27** For Jehovah of hosts hath
decreed, and who shall disannul it?  
His hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p31"></span>**28** In the year in which Ahaz the
king died, was this burden.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p32"></span>**29** Rejoice not, thou whole
Palestina,  
Because the rod of him that smote thee is broken;  
For from the root of the adder shall spring a cockatrice,  
And his fruit shall be a fiery serpent.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p33"></span>**30** And the first-born of the poor
shall feed,  
And the needy shall lie down in safety;  
And I will cause thy root to die with famine,  
And he shall slay thy remnant.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p34"></span>**31** Howl, O gate! cry, O city!  
Thou whole Palestina art dissolved;  
For smoke cometh from the north;  
And no one shall be alone in his appointed day.

<span id="xxii.i.xiv-p35"></span>**32** And what shall be answered to
the messengers of the nations?  
That Jehovah hath founded Zion,  
And the poor of his people shall have confidence in her.

<span id="xxii.i.xv"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.xv-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.xv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 15

<span id="xxii.i.xv-p3"></span>**1** The burden of Moab.  
Because in the night Ar of Moab  
Is laid waste, and brought to silence;  
Surely in the night Kir of Moab  
Is laid waste, and brought to silence.

<span id="xxii.i.xv-p4"></span>**2** He shall go up into the house, and
to the high places of Dibon, to weep;  
Over Nebo, and over Medeba, shall Moab howl.  
On all his heads shall be baldness,  
And every beard shall be shaved.

<span id="xxii.i.xv-p5"></span>**3** In his cross-roads shall they be
girded with sackcloth;  
On his roofs, and in his streets,  
Shall every one howl, and go down to weep.

<span id="xxii.i.xv-p6"></span>**4** Heshbon and Elealeh shall cry
aloud;  
As far as Jahaz shall their voice be heard;  
Therefore shall the armed men of Moab howl;  
The soul of each man shall howl to itself.

<span id="xxii.i.xv-p7"></span>**5** My heart shall cry aloud for
Moab;  
Her fugitives to Zoar, a heifer of three years old;  
By the going up of Luhith shall they go up with weeping,  
By the way of Horonaim shall they raise the cry of sorrow.

<span id="xxii.i.xv-p8"></span>**6** The waters of Nimrim are cut off;  
The grass is withered,  
The herbage hath failed,  
No verdure is left.

<span id="xxii.i.xv-p9"></span>**7** Therefore what every one hath left,
and his riches,  
They shall carry to the brook of the willows.  <span
id="fr_371"></span>[372](#fn_371)

<span id="xxii.i.xv-p11"></span>**8** The cry hath gone round the
borders of Moab;  
Even to Eglaim is his howling.  
And even to Beer-Elim is his howling.

<span id="xxii.i.xv-p12"></span>**9** Because the waters of Dimon shall
be full of blood;  
For I will lay additions upon Dimon,  
Lions to them that are escaped of Moab,  
And to the remnant of the land.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p2"></span>CHAPTER 16

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p3"></span>**1** Send ye the lamb to the governor
of the land,  
From the rock of the desert  
To the mountain of the daughter of Zion.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p4"></span>**2** And it shall be as a bird let
loose, wandering from its nest,  
So shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of Arnon.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p5"></span>**3** Assemble a council; execute
judgment;  
Make thy shadow as the night in the midst of noon-day;  
Hide the banished;  
Betray not the fugitive.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p6"></span>**4** Let mine outcasts dwell with
thee.  
Moab, be thou a place of concealment  
From the face of the destroyer;  
For the extortioner hath ceased;  
The destroyer hath failed;  
He that trod us under foot hath been consumed out of the land.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p7"></span>**5** And in mercy shall the throne be
prepared;  
And he shall sit upon it in steadfastness,  
To judge in the tabernacle of David,  
And to seek judgment,  
And to hasten righteousness.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p8"></span>**6** We have heard of the pride of
Ahab, (he is very proud,)  
His pride, his haughtiness, and his insolence;  <span
id="fr_372"></span>[373](#fn_372)  
But his lies shall not be successful.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p10"></span>**7** Therefore shall Moab howl to
Moab, all shall howl,  
On account of the foundations of Kirhareseth;  
You will groan, being only smitten.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p11"></span>**8** For the vines of Heshbon are cut
down,  
The vine of Sibmah.  
The lords of the nations have trodden down her choicest roots,  <span
id="fr_373"></span>[374](#fn_373)  
Which reached even to Jazer,  
Which wandered even to the wilderness;  
Her noble plants have been thrown down,  
Which crossed the sea.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p13"></span>**9** Therefore will I bewail with the
weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah;  
I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh!  
Because on thy summer fruits, and on thy harvest,  
A shouting shall break forth.  <span id="fr_374"></span>[375](#fn_374)

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p15"></span>**10** Joy and rejoicing have been
taken away from the fruitful field;  
In the vineyards shall there be no rejoicing nor shouting.  
The treader shall not tread wine in the presses;  
I have made the shouting to cease.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p16"></span>**11** Therefore my bowels shall sound
like a harp for Moab,  
And my inward parts for Kirharesh.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p17"></span>**12** And it shall be, when it shall
be seen  
That Moab hath been wearied on the high places,  
Then shall he come to the sanctuary to pray,  
And shall not profit by it.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p18"></span>**13** This is the word which Jehovah
uttered concerning Moab since that time.

<span id="xxii.i.xvi-p19"></span>14 Now, I say, Jehovah hath spoken,
saying —  
Three years, as the years of a hireling;  
And the glory of Moab,  
With all her multitude, however great,  
Shall be turned into disgrace;  
And her remnant shall be few, small, and feeble.

<span id="xxii.ii-p1"></span>CHAPTERS 17—32

<span id="xxii.ii.i"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 17

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p3"></span>**1** The burden of Damascus.  
Behold, Damascus is taken away, that it be not a city;  
For it shall be a heap of ruins.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p4"></span>**2** The cities of Aroer are forsaken;  
They shall be changed into sheepfolds;  
They shall lie down,  
And there shall be none to terrify them.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p5"></span>**3** And the fortress shall cease from
Ephraim,  
And the kingdom from Damascus;  
And the remnant of Syria shall be  
As the glory of the children of Israel,  
Saith Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p6"></span>**4** And it shall be in that day,  
The glory of Jacob shall be diminished,  
And the fatness of his flesh shall become lean.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p7"></span>**5** And it shall be as he who gathereth
the harvest of the corn,  
Who reapeth the ears with his arm,  
Like as one gleaneth grapes in the valley of Rephaim.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p8"></span>**6** And in thee shall be left a
gleaning, as the shaking of an olive-tree;  
There two or three berries remain on the top of the highest branch,  
Four or five on the spreading branches of its fruit,  
Saith Jehovah, the God of Israel.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p9"></span>**7** In that day shall a man look to his
Maker,  
And his eyes shall be fixed on the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p10"></span>**8** And he shall not look to the
altars, the work of his own hands.  
Nor view the things which his fingers have made,  
Nor the groves,  
Nor the graven images.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p11"></span>**9** In that day the cities of his
strength shall be  
As the forsaking of a thicket and of a branch,  
In like manner as they left before the children of Israel;  
And there shall be desolation.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p12"></span>**10** Because thou hast forgotten the
God of thy salvation,  
And hast not been mindful of the God of thy strength;  
Therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants,  
And thou shalt ingraft a foreign shoot.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p13"></span>**11** In the day of thy plantation
shalt thou make it to grow,  
And in the morning thou shalt make thy seed to sprout;  
But in the day of enjoying shall the harvest fail,  
And the grief shall be desperate.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p14"></span>**12** Alas! the multitude of many
peoples;  
Like the sound of many peoples shall they sound,  
And like the noise of nations;  
Like the noise of mighty waters shall they rush.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p15"></span>**13** Like the noise of mighty waters  
Shall the peoples make a noise,  
And he will rebuke them,  
And will drive them far away;  
They shall be chased  
As the chaff of the mountains before the wind,  
And as a rolling thing before the whirlwind.

<span id="xxii.ii.i-p16"></span>**14** In the evening time, behold!
trouble:  
Ere it be morning, it shall not at all be.  
This is the portion of them that tread us down,  
And the lot of them that plunder us.

<span id="xxii.ii.ii"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.ii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.ii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 18

<span id="xxii.ii.ii-p3"></span>**1** Alas! the land shadowing with
wings,  
Which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia.

<span id="xxii.ii.ii-p4"></span>**2** Sending ambassadors by the sea,  
In ships of reeds on the waters.  
Go, ye swift messengers,  
To a nation scattered and plundered,  
To a people terrible from that time and till now,  
To a nation trodden down on every side,  
Whose land the rivers have plundered.

<span id="xxii.ii.ii-p5"></span>**3** All ye inhabitants of the world,  
And dwellers on the earth,  
When he shall set up a standard on the mountains, you shall see it;  
When he shall sound a trumpet, you shall hear it.

<span id="xxii.ii.ii-p6"></span>**4** Thus also hath Jehovah said to
me,  
I will rest, and will look in my tabernacle,  
As the heat that drieth up the rain,  
And as a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

<span id="xxii.ii.ii-p7"></span>**5** For when the harvest shall be at
hand,  
The bud shall be perfect,  
And the ripening fruit shall go out of the flower;  
Then will he prune the twigs with pruning-hooks,  
And cut down and take away the branches.

<span id="xxii.ii.ii-p8"></span>**6** They shall be left together to the
fowls of the mountains,  
And to the beasts of the earth.  
The fowls shall spend the summer upon them,  
And all the beasts of the earth shall spend the winter upon them.

<span id="xxii.ii.ii-p9"></span>**7** At that time shall a present be
brought to Jehovah of hosts,  
A people torn and plundered,  
And from a people terrible from the beginning hitherto;  
From a nation trodden down on every side,  
Whose land the rivers have plundered,  
To the place of the name of Jehovah of hosts,  
To Mount Zion.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 19

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p3"></span>**1** The burden of Egypt.  
Behold, Jehovah rideth on a swift cloud,  
And will come into Egypt;  
And the idols of Egypt shall be moved before his face,  
And the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of her.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p4"></span>**2** And I will set the Egyptians
against the Egyptians;  
Then shall they fight every one against his brother,  
Every one against his neighbour;  
City against city,  
And kingdom against kingdom.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p5"></span>**3** And the spoil of Egypt shall be
emptied in the midst of her,  
And I will destroy her counsel,  
Even though they seek to the idols, to the magicians,  
To the soothsayers, to the diviners.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p6"></span>**4** And I will deliver the Egyptians,
into the hand of a cruel master,  
And a powerful king shall rule over them,  
Saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p7"></span>**5** Then shall the waters fail from
the sea,  
And the flood shall be wasted and dried up.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p8"></span>**6** The rivers shall be turned
aside;  
The brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up;  
The reed and the flag shall wither.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p9"></span>**7** The herbs at the brook, and on
the mouth of the brook,  
And all the seed of the river,  
Shall wither, and be driven away, that it may be no more.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p10"></span>**8** And the fishers shall mourn,  
And all who cast a hook into the brook shall lament;  
They who spread a net on the face of the waters shall anguish.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p11"></span>**9** They who work in the finest flax
shall blush,  
And they who weave perforated  <span id="fr_375"></span>[376](#fn_375)
meshes.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p13"></span>**10** For their nets shall be
broken,  
And all that make a net shall be sad in their heart.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p14"></span>**11** Surely the princes of Zoan are
fools;  
The counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is foolish.  
How say ye to Pharaoh,  
I am the son of the wise,  
And the son of ancient kings?

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p15"></span>**12** Where are now thy wise men?  
That they may declare to thee,  
Or that they may even know,  
What Jehovah of hosts hath decreed concerning Egypt.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p16"></span>**13** The princes of Zoan are become
infatuated,  
The princes of Noph are deceived;  
Egypt hath been led astray  
By a corner of her tribes.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p17"></span>**14** Jehovah hath mingled a spirit
of perverseness in the midst of her;  
And they have misled Egypt in all her work,  
As a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p18"></span>**15** Neither shall Egypt have any
work to do,  
The head or the tail,  
The branch or the rush.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p19"></span>**16** In that day shall Egypt be like
women;  
For it shall shudder and tremble,  
From before the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts,  
Which he shall shake over it.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p20"></span>**17** And to the Egyptians shall the
land of Judah be a terror.  
Every one that shall mention it  
Shall tremble on account of her,  
Because of the purpose of Jehovah of hosts,  
Which he hath decreed concerning her.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p21"></span>**18** In that day shall there be five
cities in the land of Egypt,  
Speaking with the lip of Canaan,  
And swearing by Jehovah of hosts.  
One shall be called, The city of desolation.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p22"></span>**19** In that day shall there be  
An altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt,  
And a statue to Jehovah near its border.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p23"></span>**20** And it shall be for a sign and
for a witness  
To Jehovah of hosts, in the land of Egypt;  
For they shall cry to Jehovah because of the oppressors,  
And he will send to them a saviour,  
And a ruler, that he may deliver them.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p24"></span>**21** And Jehovah shall be known by
the Egyptians;  
The Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day,  
And shall make sacrifice and oblation,  
And shall vow vows to Jehovah, and perform them.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p25"></span>**22** Therefore will the Lord smite
Egypt,  
Smiting and healing;  
For they shall be turned to Jehovah,  
And he will be entreated by them,  
And will heal them.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p26"></span>**23** In that day shall there be a
way from Egypt into Assyria;  
The Assyrians shall go into Egypt,  
And the Egyptians into Assyria;  
And the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians.  <span
id="fr_376"></span>[377](#fn_376)

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p28"></span>**24** In that day shall Israel be,  
With Egypt and with Assyria,  
The third blessing in the midst of the land.

<span id="xxii.ii.iii-p29"></span>**25** For Jehovah of hosts will bless
him, saying,  
Blessed be the Egyptian, my people,  
And the Assyrian, the work of my hands,  
And Israel, my inheritance.

<span id="xxii.ii.iv"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.iv-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.iv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 20

<span id="xxii.ii.iv-p3"></span>**1** In the year that Tartan came to
Ashdod, (when Sargon, the king of Assyria, sent him,) and attacked
Ashdod, and took it.

<span id="xxii.ii.iv-p4"></span>**2** At that time Jehovah spoke by the
hand of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saying,  
Go and loose the sackcloth from thy loins,  
And put off thy shoe from thy foot.

<span id="xxii.ii.iv-p5"></span>**3** And he did so, walking naked and
barefooted. And Jehovah said:  
As my servant Isaiah for three years  
Hath walked naked and barefooted,  
A sign and a wonder  
Concerning Egypt and concerning Ethiopia;

<span id="xxii.ii.iv-p6"></span>**4** So will the king of Assyria lead
away the captivity of Egypt,  
And the removal of Ethiopia,  
Of the young and of the old,  
Naked and barefooted,  
And with their hinder parts uncovered,  
To the disgrace of Egypt.

<span id="xxii.ii.iv-p7"></span>**5** And they shall be afraid and
ashamed  
Of Ethiopia their expectation,  
And of Egypt their glory.  <span id="fr_377"></span>[378](#fn_377)

<span id="xxii.ii.iv-p9"></span>**6** And in that day shall the
inhabitant of this island say,  
Behold! what is become of our expectation,  
To which we fled for aid,  
That we might be delivered from the face of the king of Assyria;  
And how shall we escape?

<span id="xxii.ii.v"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p2"></span>CHAPTER 21

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p3"></span>**1** The burden of the desert of the
sea.  
As storms that pass from a southerly direction,  
It will come from the wilderness,  
From a terrible land.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p4"></span>**2** A harsh vision hath been declared
to me,  
The transgressor to the transgressor,  
And the plunderer to the plunderer.  
Go up, O Persian! Besiege, O Mede!  
All his groaning have I made to cease.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p5"></span>**3** Therefore are my loins filled with
pain;  
Pangs have seized me, as the pangs of a woman in labour;  
I am bowed down at hearing,  
And am dismayed at seeing.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p6"></span>**4** My heart is shaken;  
Terror hath overwhelmed me;  
The night of my pleasures  
He hath changed to terror.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p7"></span>**5** Prepare the table;  
Watch in the watch-tower;  
Eat, drink;  
Arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p8"></span>**6** For thus hath the Lord said to
me:  
Go, appoint a watchman,  
That he may declare what he seeth.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p9"></span>**7** And he saw a chariot of a couple of
horsemen,  
A chariot of an ass, and a chariot of a camel;  
Next, he looked attentively,  
And watched eagerly.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p10"></span>**8** Then he cried, A lion.  
On my watch-tower, my lord, I continually stand by day,  
And in my ward am I stationed whole nights.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p11"></span>**9** And behold, here cometh a chariot
of a man,  
A couple of horsemen.  
And he spake, and said,  
Babylon is fallen, is fallen!  
And all the graven images of her gods  
Hath he broken to the ground.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p12"></span>**10** O my thrashing, and the corn of
my floor!  
I have related to you what I have heard  
From Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p13"></span>**11** The burden of Dumah.  
He calleth to me out of Seir:  
Watchman, what of the night?  
Watchman, what of the night?

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p14"></span>**12** The watchman said:  
The morning cometh, afterwards the night.  
If ye will inquire, inquire ye.  
Return, come.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p15"></span>**13** The burden in Arabia.  
In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge,  
In the ways of Dedanim.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p16"></span>**14** To meet the thirsty bring
waters,  
O inhabitants of the land of Tema!  
Relieve the fugitive with thy bread.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p17"></span>**15** For they flee from the face of
the swords,  
From the face of the drawn sword,  
From the face of the bent bow,  
From the face of the grievousness of war.

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p18"></span>**16** For thus hath the Lord said to
me:  
Yet a year, according to the years of a hireling,  
Then shall all the glory of Kedar fail;

<span id="xxii.ii.v-p19"></span>**17** And then shall be diminished the
number of the archers,  
Which shall be reckoned among the mighty sons of Kedar;  
For Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath spoken it.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p2"></span>CHAPTER 22

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p3"></span>**1** The burden of the valley of
vision.  
What hast thou here,  <span id="fr_378"></span>[379](#fn_378)  
That thou art entirely gone up upon the roofs?

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p5"></span>**2** Full of miseries,  
Tumultuous city, joyful city;  
Thy slain men are not slain by the sword,  
And are not dead in battle.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p6"></span>**3** All thy rulers have fled;  
Together have they been made prisoners by the archers;  
All that were found in thee have been made prisoners together,  
Who have fled from afar.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p7"></span>**4** Therefore I said, Let me alone;  
I will be bitter in my weeping;  
Labour not to comfort me  
Because of the plundering of the daughters of my people.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p8"></span>**5** For it is a day of trouble, and of
treading down, and of perplexity,  
From the Lord Jehovah of hosts, in the valley of vision,  
Demolishing the city,  
And crying to the mountain.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p9"></span>**6** Yet Elam beareth the quiver  
In a chariot of men and horsemen,  
And Kir uncovereth the shield.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p10"></span>**7** And the choice of thy valleys was
filled with chariots,  
And horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p11"></span>**8** And he took away the covering of
Judah;  
And thou didst look in that day  
To the armory of the house of the forest.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p12"></span>**9** And ye have seen the breaches of
the city of David, which were many;  
And ye collected the waters of the lower pool.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p13"></span>**10** And the houses of Jerusalem have
ye numbered,  
And ye have thrown down houses to fortify the wall.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p14"></span>**11** For the waters of the old pool  
Have ye also made a ditch between the walls;  
And ye have not looked to him that made it,  
And have not seen him that formed it in ancient times.  <span
id="fr_379"></span>[380](#fn_379)

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p16"></span>**12** And in that day the Lord,
Jehovah of hosts,  
Called to weeping and to lamentation,  
To baldness and girding with sackcloth;

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p17"></span>**13** And, behold! joy and gladness,  
Slaying oxen, killing sheep,  
Eating flesh, and drinking wine,  
Eating and drinking;  
For tomorrow we shall die!

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p18"></span>**14** It was revealed in my ears by
Jehovah of hosts,  
If this iniquity shall be forgiven you till ye die,  
Saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p19"></span>**15** Thus saith the Lord Jehovah of
hosts,  
Go, approach to that abettor,  
To Shebna, the ruler of the house.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p20"></span>**16** What hast thou here? and whom
hast thou here?  
That thou hast hewed out here for thyself a sepulchre,  
As he who heweth out his sepulchre on high,  
Or who cutteth out a habitation for himself in the rock.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p21"></span>**17** Behold, Jehovah will carry thee
away with a remarkable carrying away,  
And covering will cover thee.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p22"></span>**18** Whirling he will turn thee with
whirling,  
As a ball with the hands, into a distant country;  
There shalt thou die;  
And there the chariot of thy glory  
Shall be the disgrace of the house of thy lord.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p23"></span>**19** And I will drive thee from thy
post,  
And from thy abode shall he east thee out.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p24"></span>**20** And it shall be in that day, I
will call my servant,  
Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p25"></span>**21** And I will clothe him with thy
raiment,  
And will strengthen him with thy girdle,  
And will deliver thy power into his hand;  
And he shall be a father of the inhabitant of Jerusalem,  
And of the house of Judah.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p26"></span>**22** And I will lay the key of the
house of David upon his shoulder;  
He will open, and none shall shut;  
He will shut, and none shall open.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p27"></span>**23** And I will fasten him as a nail
in a sure place,  
And to the house of his father he shall become a throne of glory.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p28"></span>**24** And all the glory of his fathers
house,  
Grandchildren and great-grandchildren,  
All smaller vessels,  
From vessels of cups to all vessels of musical instruments,  
They shall hang upon him.

<span id="xxii.ii.vi-p29"></span>**25** In that day, saith Jehovah of
hosts,  
The nail fixed in a sure place shall be removed,  
And shall be cut down, and shall fall;  
And the burden which was upon it shall be cut off;  
For Jehovah hath spoken it.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 23

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p3"></span>**1** The burden of Tyre.  
Howl, ye ships of Tarshish;  
For desolation has been made,  
So that there is no house,  
That there is no entering in from the land of Chittim.  
This was revealed to them.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p4"></span>**2** Be silent, ye inhabitants of the
islands,  
The merchant of Sidon; they that crossed the sea;  
Who supplied thee.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p5"></span>**3** By great waters was the seed of
the Nile;  
Her fruits were the harvest of the river;  
And she was a mart of nations.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p6"></span>**4** Be ashamed, O Sidon;  
For the sea hath spoken,  
The strength of the sea, saying,  
I have not conceived nor brought forth,  
And I have not brought up young men,  
And have not reared virgins.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p7"></span>**5** As soon as the report shall reach
the Egyptians,  
They shall be grieved according to the report of Tyre.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p8"></span>**6** Pass ye over to Tarshish;  
Howl, ye inhabitants of the islands.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p9"></span>**7** Is this your exulting city?  
From ancient days is her antiquity.  
Her feet shall carry her,  
To travel into a distant country.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p10"></span>**8** Who hath consulted this
concerning crowning Tyre,  
Whose merchants are princes,  
Whose traders are the nobles of the land?

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p11"></span>**9** Thus hath Jehovah of hosts
decreed,  
To profane the pride of all that are illustrious,  
To bring into contempt all the renowned of the land.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p12"></span>**10** Cross over from thy land, like
a river,  
To the daughter of Tarshish;  
For there is no longer any girdle.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p13"></span>**11** He laid his hand upon the
sea,  
He shook kingdoms.  
Jehovah hath commanded concerning Canaan,  
To weaken her strength.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p14"></span>**12** And he saith, O virgin daughter
of Sidon,  
When thou shalt be oppressed,  
Thou shalt not add any more to rejoice.  
Arise, that thou mayest pass over into Chittim;  
Yet even there thou shalt not have rest.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p15"></span>**13** Behold, the land of the
Chaldeans;  
This was not a people;  
Assyria founded it for the inhabitants of the wilderness;  
They have reared its fortresses;  
They have built its palaces;  
He hath reduced it to desolation.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p16"></span>**14** Howl, ye ships of Tarshish;  
For your strength is laid waste.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p17"></span>**15** It shall come to pass in that
day,  
That Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years,  
According to the days of one king;  
At the end of seventy years  
Shall Tyre have a song like that of a harlot.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p18"></span>**16** Take a harp, go about the
city,  
O harlot, devoted to forgetfulness!  
Make sweet melody, multiply song,  
That thou mayest be kept in remembrance.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p19"></span>**17** It shall then be at the end of
seventy years,  
That Jehovah will visit Tyre;  
And then shall she return to her hire,  
And shall commit fornication  
With all the kingdoms of the earth  
Which are upon the earth.

<span id="xxii.ii.vii-p20"></span>**18** Yet her merchandise and her
hire  
Shall be holy to Jehovah;  
It shall not be treasured nor laid up;  
But her merchandise shall be  
For them that dwell before Jehovah,  
That they may eat sufficiently,  
And may have a thick covering.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 24

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p3"></span>**1** Behold, Jehovah emptieth the
earth,  
Maketh it bare,  
Overturneth its face,  
And scattereth its inhabitants.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p4"></span>**2** And it shall be, as the people,
so the priest;  
As the servant, so his master;  
As the maid, so her mistress;  
As the buyer, so the seller;  
As the lender, so the borrower;  
As the usurer, so he that giveth usury.  <span
id="fr_380"></span>[381](#fn_380)

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p6"></span>**3** By emptying shall the earth be
emptied,  
And by plundering shall it be plundered;  
For Jehovah hath spoken this word.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p7"></span>**4** The earth hath lamented, and
hath fallen;  
The world hath languished, and hath fallen;  
They who were the lofty people of the earth have languished.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p8"></span>**5** And the earth hath been
deceitful under its inhabitants;  
Because they have transgressed the laws,  
They have changed the ordinance,  
They have broken the covenant of eternity.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p9"></span>**6** Therefore hath the curse
consumed the earth,  
And its inhabitants are made desolate;  
Therefore are the inhabitants of the earth burned,  
And few men have been left.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p10"></span>**7** The wine hath failed;  
The vine hath languished;  
All who were of joyful heart have groaned.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p11"></span>**8** The joy of tabrets hath
ceased,  
The noise of them that exult is ended,  
The mirth of the harp is silent.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p12"></span>**9** They shall not drink wine with
a song;  
Strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p13"></span>**10** The city of vanity is broken
down;  
Every house is shut up, that none may enter.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p14"></span>**11** There is a cry about wine in
the streets;  
All joy is darkened;  
The mirth of the land hath departed.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p15"></span>**12** Desolation is left in the
city,  
And the gate is smitten with desolation.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p16"></span>**13** For in the midst of the
land,  
In the midst of the peoples,  
Thus shall it be as the shaking of an olive-tree,  
And as the shaking of the grapes, when the vintage is ended.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p17"></span>**14** They shall lift up their
voice;  
They shall shout for the majesty of the Lord;  
They shall cry aloud from the sea.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p18"></span>**15** Therefore glorify ye Jehovah
in the valleys,  
The name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the sea.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p19"></span>**16** From the uttermost part of the
earth have we heard songs,  
Glory to the Righteous One!  
  
And I said, I have leanness! I have leanness! Wo to me!  
The treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously;  
With treachery have the treacherous dealers dealt treacherously.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p20"></span>**17** Fear, and the pit, and the
snare,  
Are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth!

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p21"></span>**18** And it shall come to pass,  
That he who fleeth from the voice of fear,  
Shall fall into the pit,  
And he who goeth up out of the midst of the pit  
Shall be taken in the snare;  
For the windows from on high are opened,  
And the foundations of the earth are shaken.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p22"></span>**19** By bruising is the earth
bruised;  
By breaking down is the earth broken down;  
By shaking is the earth shaken.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p23"></span>**20** With reeling doth the earth
reel, like a drunkard;  
And it shall be removed, like a tabernacle;  
And its transgression shall be heavy upon it;  
And it shall fall, and shall not add to rise again.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p24"></span>**21** And it shall be in that day,  
Jehovah will visit  
Upon the high army on high,  
And upon the kings of the earth on the earth.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p25"></span>**22** And with gathering together
shall they be gathered together  
Like prisoners in a dungeon;  
And they shall be shut up in a prison;  
Afterwards at the end of many days shall they be visited.

<span id="xxii.ii.viii-p26"></span>**23** The moon shall be
confounded,  
And the sun shall be ashamed,  
When Jehovah of hosts shall reign  
In Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem;  
And before his elders glory.

<span id="xxii.ii.ix"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p2"></span>CHAPTER 25

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p3"></span>**1** O Jehovah, thou art my God;  
I will exalt thee;  
I will praise thy name;  
For thou hast done a wonderful thing;  
Counsels which have been already decreed of old;  
Firm truth.

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p4"></span>**2** For thou hast made of a city a
heap;  
A fortified city to be a ruin;  
A palace of foreigners, that it may not be a city,  
That it may never be built.

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p5"></span>**3** Therefore shall the mighty people
glorify thee;  
The city of the powerful nations shall fear thee.

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p6"></span>**4** For thou hast been strength to the
poor;  
Strength to the needy in his affliction;  
A refuge from the flood,  
A shadow from the heat;  
For the breath of the strong  <span id="fr_381"></span>[382](#fn_381)
ones  
Was as a storm  <span id="fr_382"></span>[383](#fn_382) against the
wall.

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p9"></span>**5** As the heat in a dry place,  
Thou wilt lay low the noise of foreigners,  
As the heat by the shadow of a cloud;  
The shouting  <span id="fr_383"></span>[384](#fn_383) of the strong ones
wilt thou lay low.

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p11"></span>**6** And Jehovah of hosts will make  
For all people in that mountain  
A feast of fat things,  
A feast of liquids purified,  
Of fat things full of marrow,  
Of liquids purified.

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p12"></span>**7** And he will destroy in that
mountain  
The face of the covering with which all nations were covered,  
And the veil which was spread over all nations.

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p13"></span>**8** He hath destroyed death
eternally.  
And the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from all faces,  
And will take away the disgrace of his people from all the earth;  
For Jehovah hath spoken it.

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p14"></span>**9** And it shall he said in that
day:  
Lo, this is our God;  
We have waited for him,  
And he will save us;  
This is Jehovah;  
We have waited for him;  
We will rejoice and be glad in his salvation.

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p15"></span>**10** For the hand of Jehovah shall
rest on that mountain;  
And Moab shall be trodden down under him,  
As straw is trodden down on the dunghill.

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p16"></span>**11** And he will spread out his hand
under the midst of them,  
As a swimmer spreadeth forth his hands to swim;  
And he will lay low their pride,  
With the arms of their hands.

<span id="xxii.ii.ix-p17"></span>**12** And the fortress of the
loftiness of thy walls  
He will bring down,  
He will lay low,  
And he will cast down to the ground,  
To the dust.

<span id="xxii.ii.x"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p2"></span>CHAPTER 26

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p3"></span>**1** In that day shall a song be sung in
the land of Judah;  
We have a city of strength;  
He hath made salvation to be walls and a rampart.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p4"></span>**2** Open ye the gates,  
And the righteous nation shall enter,  
Which keepeth the truth.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p5"></span>**3** The thought is fixed;  
Thou wilt keep peace, peace;  
For they have trusted in thee.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p6"></span>**4** Hope ye in Jehovah for ever;  
For in Jah Jehovah is the strength of ages.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p7"></span>**5** For he will bow down the
inhabitants of loftiness;  
He will lay low the elevated city;  
He will lay it low to the ground;  
He will bring it to the dust.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p8"></span>**6** The foot shall tread it down;  
The feet of the poor,  
The steps of the needy.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p9"></span>**7** Straightnesses are the path of the
righteous man;  
The straight way of the righteous man thou wilt weigh.  <span
id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384)

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p11"></span>**8** Even in the way of thy judgments,
O Jehovah,  
We have waited for thee;  
To thy name,  
And to the remembrance of thee,  
Is the desire of the soul.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p12"></span>**9** My soul hath desired thee in the
night;  
Yea, with my spirit within me I will seek thee in the morning;  <span
id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385)  
For so soon as thy judgments shall be in the earth,  
The inhabitants of the earth shall learn righteousness.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p14"></span>**10** The wicked man will obtain
favour,  
And will not learn righteousness;  
In the land of upright actions he will deal unjustly,  
And will not behold the majesty of Jehovah.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p15"></span>**11** Jehovah, though thy hand is
lifted up,  
They will not see;  
They shall see, and be ashamed,  
Through their envy of the people;  
Yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p16"></span>**12** O Jehovah, thou wilt ordain peace
for us;  
For thou also hast wrought all our works for us.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p17"></span>**13** O Jehovah our God,  
Lords besides thee have had dominion over us;  
By thee only will we call thy name to remembrance.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p18"></span>**14** The dead shall not live;  
The slain shall not rise again;  
Therefore thou hast visited and driven them away,  
And hast destroyed all remembrance of them.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p19"></span>**15** Thou hast added to the nation, O
Jehovah!  
Thou hast added to the nation;  
Thou art glorified;  
Thou hast enlarged all the boundaries of the earth.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p20"></span>**16** O Jehovah, in trouble have they
visited thee;  
They poured out a prayer, when thy chastening was upon them.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p21"></span>**17** As a woman with child, who
draweth near to her delivery,  
Is in pain, and crieth out in her pains;  
So have we been before thy face, O Jehovah.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p22"></span>**18** We have been in labour,  
We have had pain,  
As if we had brought forth wind;  
Salvation hath not been wrought for the earth,  
And the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p23"></span>**19** Thy dead men shall live;  
My dead body, they shall arise;  
Awake and sing, ye inhabitants of the dust;  
For thy dew is the dew of herbs;  
And the earth shall cast out the dead.  <span
id="fr_386"></span>[387](#fn_386)

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p25"></span>**20** Come, O my people;  
Enter thou into thy chambers;  
Shut the door behind thee;  
Hide thyself a little for a moment,  
Till the indignation pass over.

<span id="xxii.ii.x-p26"></span>**21** For, behold, Jehovah cometh out
of his place,  
To visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth against him;  
And the earth shall disclose her blood,  
And shall no longer cover her slain.

<span id="xxii.ii.xi"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p2"></span>CHAPTER 27

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p3"></span>**1** In that day will Jehovah visit  
With his hard, and great, and strong sword,  
On leviathan the piercing serpent,  
And on leviathan the crooked serpent;  
And he will slay the dragon that is in the sea.

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p4"></span>**2** In that day sing ye to the
vineyard of redness.

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p5"></span>**3** I Jehovah keep it;  
Every moment will I water it;  
That (the enemy) may not visit it,  
I will keep it night and day.

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p6"></span>**4** Fury doth not dwell in me.  
Who shall engage me in battle with the brier and thorn?  <span
id="fr_387"></span>[388](#fn_387)  
I will pass through it in a hostile manner,  
I will utterly burn it up.

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p8"></span>**5** Will she take hold of my
strength,  
That she may make peace with me?  
Yea, that she may make peace with me?

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p9"></span>**6** Afterwards shall Jacob put forth
roots;  
Israel shall bud and blossom;  
And the face of the world shall be filled with fruit.

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p10"></span>**7** Hath he smitten him according to
the stroke of him that smote him?  
Hath he been slain according to the slaughter of them that slew him?

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p11"></span>**8** In measure, in her shooting
forth,  
Thou wilt contend with her;  
Even though he blow with his violent wind  
In the day of the east wind.

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p12"></span>**9** Therefore in this manner shall
the iniquity of Jacob be expiated;  
And this is all the fruit,  
The taking away of his sin;  
When he shall make all the stones of the altar  
As lime-stones broken in pieces,  
That groves and images may not rise again.

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p13"></span>**10** Yet the fortified city shall be
desolate;  
The inhabited place shall be deserted,  
And forsaken like a wilderness.  
There the calf shall feed,  
And there shall lie down,  
And shall browse on its tops.

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p14"></span>**11** When its harvest shall wither,
they shall break  <span id="fr_388"></span>[389](#fn_388) it;  
Women coming shall burn it;  
For it is a people that doth not understand;  
Therefore their Maker will not have compassion on them,  
And he who formed them will not be gracious to them.

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p16"></span>**12** Yet in that day it shall come to
pass  
That Jehovah will thrash  
From the channel of the river  
To the river of Egypt;  
And ye shall be gathered one by one,  
O children of Israel.

<span id="xxii.ii.xi-p17"></span>**13** It shall also come to pass in
that day  
That the great trumpet shall be blown;  
And they shall come who were perishing in the land of Assyria,  
And who had been scattered in the land of Egypt;  
And they shall worship Jehovah  
In the holy mountain, in Jerusalem.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 28

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p3"></span>**1** Wo to the crown of pride of the
drunkards of Ephraim;  
For the splendour of his glory shall be a fading flower,  
Which is on the head of the valley of the fat ones,  
Of them that are overcome by wine.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p4"></span>**2** Behold, the Lord hath a mighty
and strong one;  
As a deluge of hail,  
A desolating whirlwind;  
As the violence of mighty waters overflowing,  
Casting down to the earth with the hand.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p5"></span>**3** The crown of pride of the
drunkards of Ephraim  
Shall be trodden under feet.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p6"></span>**4** And the splendour of his glory
shall be a fading flower,  
Which is on the head of the valley of the fat ones;  
Like the premature fig before the summer,  
Which, while he looketh at it,  
While it is yet in his hand,  
He that seeth it devoureth.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p7"></span>**5** In that day will Jehovah of
hosts  
Become a crown of glory  
And a diadem of excellence  
To the remnant of his people,

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p8"></span>**6** And a spirit of judgment to him
that sitteth on the judgment-seat,  
And strength to them that drive back the battle to the gate.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p9"></span>**7** But they also have erred through
wine;  
Through strong drink they have gone astray.  
The priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink;  
They have been swallowed up by wine;  
They have gone astray through strong drink;  
They have erred in vision,  
They have stumbled in judgment.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p10"></span>**8** For all tables are full of
nauseous vomiting,  
So that no place is unoccupied.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p11"></span>**9** Whom shall he teach knowledge?  
And whom shall he make to understand doctrine?  
Them that are weaned from the milk?  
Them that are withdrawn from the breasts?

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p12"></span>**10** For precept must be on precept,
precept on precept;  
Instruction on instruction, instruction on instruction;  
Here a little, there a little.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p13"></span>**11** For with stammering lips will
he speak to this people,  
And with a foreign tongue.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p14"></span>**12** For he said to them, This is
the rest;  
Cause the weary to rest;  
And this is the refreshing;  
And they refused to hear.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p15"></span>**13** The word of Jehovah shall
therefore be to them  
Rule upon rule, rule upon rule;  
Instruction upon instruction, instruction upon instruction;  
Here a little, there a little;  
Therefore they shall go, and shall fall backward,  
Shall be broken, and snared, and taken.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p16"></span>**14** Therefore hear the word of
Jehovah, ye scornful men,  
Who govern this people, which is in Jerusalem.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p17"></span>**15** Because ye have said,  
We have struck a league with death,  
And with hell have we made a compact;  
When the overflowing scourge shall pass through,  
It shall not come to us;  
For we have made falsehood our refuge,  
And under vanity have we hidden ourselves.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p18"></span>**16** Wherefore thus saith the Lord
Jehovah:  
Behold, I will lay in Zion a stone, a stone of trial,  
A precious corner-stone, a sure foundation.  
He that believeth shall not make haste.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p19"></span>**17** And I will lay judgment to the
line,  
And righteousness to the measure.  <span
id="fr_389"></span>[390](#fn_389)  
The hail shall sweep away the reliance of falsehood,  
And the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p21"></span>**18** And your compact with death
shall be disannulled;  
Your agreement with hell shall not stand;  
When the overflowing scourge shall pass through,  
Then shall ye become a treading down to it.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p22"></span>**19** From the time that it shall
pass,  
It shall seize you every morning,  
And shall pass every day by day and by night;  
And it shall be that terror  <span id="fr_390"></span>[391](#fn_390)
alone  
Shall cause them to understand the report.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p24"></span>**20** For the bed is short, so that
it is not enough;  
The covering shall be narrow for wrapping,

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p25"></span>**21** For as in Mount Perazim will
Jehovah stand up,  
And as in the valley of Gibeon will he be angry;  <span
id="fr_391"></span>[392](#fn_391)  
To do his work, his strange work;  
To perform his act, his strange act.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p27"></span>**22** Now therefore be ye not
mockers,  
Lest your chains be more firmly fastened;  
For I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts a consumption,  
And a completion on the whole earth.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p28"></span>**23** Listen ye, and hear my voice;  
Hearken, and hear my speech.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p29"></span>**24** Doth the ploughman plough every
day, that he may sow?  
Doth he open and break the clods of his field?

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p30"></span>**25** When he hath leveled its
surface,  
Will he not then scatter fitches, and sow cummin,  
And allot wheat in measure, and barley measured,  
And spelt in its order?

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p31"></span>**26** His God instructeth him,  
And teacheth him what is right.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p32"></span>**27** Certainly vetches shall not be
thrashed with a toothed instrument,  
Nor shall the wheel of a cart be turned round on the cummin;  
For vetches are beaten with a staff,  
And cummin with a rod.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p33"></span>**28** Though wheat be bruised,  
He doth not bruise it continually,  
Nor always cause the wheel of his cart to grind it,  
Lest he crush it with its teeth.

<span id="xxii.ii.xii-p34"></span>**29** This also hath proceeded from
Jehovah of hosts,  
Who is wonderful in counsel,  
And majestic in procedure.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p2"></span>CHAPTER 29

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p3"></span>**1** Alas! Ariel, Ariel,  
The city which David inhabited,  
Add ye year to year,  
That the lambs may be slain.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p4"></span>**2** Yet I will bring Ariel into
distress,  
And there shall be grief and sorrow,  
And it shall be to me as Ariel.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p5"></span>**3** And I will encamp against thee
round about,  
And will attack thee with a military force,  
And will erect ramparts against thee.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p6"></span>**4** Then shalt thou be brought
low,  
Thou shalt speak out of the earth,  
And thy speech shall come out of the dust,  
And thy voice shall be like that of a sorcerer out of the earth,  
And thy speech shall mutter out of the dust.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p7"></span>**5** And the sound of thy foreigners
shall be as the small dust,  
And the multitude of thy mighty men as the passing chaff,  
And it shall be in a moment suddenly.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p8"></span>**6** Thou shalt be visited by Jehovah
of hosts  
With thunder, and earthquake, and great noise,  
With whirlwind and tempest,  
And with the flame of devouring fire.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p9"></span>**7** And as a dream of a vision of
the night shall be  
The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,  
Of every one that fighteth,  
And that raiseth fortifications against her,  
And that distresseth her.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p10"></span>**8** It shall therefore be  
As when a hungry man dreameth, and behold! he eateth,  
But when he awaketh, his soul is empty;  
And as when a thirsty man dreameth, And behold! He drinketh,  
But when he awaketh, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite;  
So shall be the multitude of all the nations  
That fight against Mount Zion.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p11"></span>**9** Tarry and wonder;  
They are blinded and they blind;  
They are drunken, but not with wine;  
They stagger, and not with strong drink.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p12"></span>**10** For Jehovah hath overpowered
you with the spirit of slumber,  
And hath closed your eyes;  
Your prophets And principal seers  
He hath struck with darkness.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p13"></span>**11** Therefore every vision hath
become to you  
As the words of a sealed book;  
Which if they deliver to one who knoweth letters,  
And say, Read in it, I pray,  
Then shall he say, I cannot,  
For it is sealed:

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p14"></span>**12** And if the book be delivered
to one who hath not learned letters,  
And it be said, Read in it, I pray,  
Then shall he say, I know not letters.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p15"></span>**13** Therefore the Lord saith:  
Because this people draw near to me with their mouth,  
And honour me with their lips,  
And have removed their heart far from me,  
And their fear toward me hath been taught by the commandment of men;

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p16"></span>**14** Therefore, behold! I add to
do  
A wonderful work among this people,  
A miracle and a prodigy;  
For the wisdom of their wise men shall perish,  
And the prudence of their prudent men shall vanish away.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p17"></span>**15** Wo to them that conceal
themselves from Jehovah,  
That they may hide counsel;  
For their works are in the dark, and they say,  
Who seeth us? and, Who knoweth us?

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p18"></span>**16** Is your turning reckoned like
potters clay?  
Doth a work say of its author, He did not make me?  
And doth a thing framed say of its framer, He did not understand?

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p19"></span>**17** Is it not yet a little, a
little,  
And Lebanon shall be changed into Carmel,  
And Carmel shall be reckoned a forest?

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p20"></span>**18** And in that day shall the deaf
hear  
The words of the book,  
And the eyes of the blind shall see  
Out of obscurity and out of darkness.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p21"></span>**19** Then shall the humble again
take joy in Jehovah,  
And the poor of men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p22"></span>**20** For the violent man is brought
to nought,  
The mocker is despised;  
And they who hastened early to iniquity are ruined.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p23"></span>**21** Who make a man to offend in
word,  
Who have laid snares for him that reproveth in the gate,  
And have turned aside the righteous man for nothing.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p24"></span>**22** Therefore Jehovah, who
redeemed Abraham,  
Speaketh thus to the house of Jacob:  
Jacob shall not now be confounded,  
Nor shall his face now become pale.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p25"></span>**23** For when he shall see in the
midst of him  
His children, the work of my hands,  
They shall sanctify my name,  
They shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob,  
They shall fear the God of Israel.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiii-p26"></span>**24** Then they that erred in spirit
shall learn understanding,  
And the murmurers shall learn doctrine.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 30

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p3"></span>**1** Wo to the rebellious  <span
id="fr_392"></span>[393](#fn_392) children, saith Jehovah,  
That they may take counsel, and not from me;  
That they may cover a secret,  <span id="fr_393"></span>[394](#fn_393)
and not from my Spirit;  
That they may add sin to sin.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p6"></span>**2** Who set out that they may go down
into Egypt,  
And have not inquired at my mouth;  
Strengthening themselves with the strength of Pharaoh,  
And trusting in the shadow of Egypt.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p7"></span>**3** But the strength of Pharaoh  
Shall become to you shame;  
And reliance on the shadow of Egypt  
Shall become disgrace.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p8"></span>**4** For his princes were in Zoan,  
And his ambassadors came to Hanes.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p9"></span>**5** All shall be ashamed  
Of a people that will not profit them,  
And will not become a help,  
And will not yield advantage,  
But will become shame,  
And even disgrace.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p10"></span>**6** The burden of the beasts of the
south.  
In the land of trouble and anguish,  
The lion and the stronger lion,  
The viper and the flying serpent;  
While they shall carry their riches  
On the shoulders of young asses,  
And on the bunches of camels,  
To a people that will not profit them.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p11"></span>**7** Surely the Egyptians are
vanity,  
And shall help in vain.  
Therefore have I cried to her,  
Their strength is to sit still.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p12"></span>**8** Now go, and write this vision on
a tablet before them,  
And engrave it in a book,  
That it may be till the last day,  
For ever and ever.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p13"></span>**9** For this is a rebellious
people,  
Lying children,  
Children who refuse to hear the law of Jehovah.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p14"></span>**10** Who say to the seers, Do not
see,  
And to the foreseers, Do not foresee to us right things;  
Speak ye to us flatteries,  
See ye errors.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p15"></span>**11** Go out of the way;  
Turn aside from the path;  
Cause the Holy One of Israel  
To depart from our presence.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p16"></span>**12** Therefore thus saith the Holy
One of Israel:  
Because ye have disdained this word,  
And have trusted in violence and wickedness,  
And have rested on it;

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p17"></span>**13** Therefore shall your iniquity
be to you  
Like a breach falling,  
Like the bulging out in a lofty wall,  
The fall of which comes suddenly and unexpectedly.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p18"></span>**14** And the breaking of it shall
be  
As the breaking of a potter’s vessel,  
Which is broken without mercy;  
And in its breaking there is not found a sherd  
To carry fire from the hearth,  
Or to draw water from a well.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p19"></span>**15** For thus saith the Lord
Jehovah,  
The Holy One of Israel:  
In rest and quietness shall you be safe;  
In peace and confidence shall be your strength;  
But ye would not.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p20"></span>**16** And ye said, No, but we will
flee on horses;  
Therefore shall ye flee;  
We will ride on the swift;  
Therefore they that shall pursue you shall be more swift.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p21"></span>**17** A thousand as one from the face
of the rebuke of one,  
From the face of the rebuke of five shall ye flee,  
Until ye shall be left  
As the mast of a ship on the top of a mountain,  
And as a banner on a hill.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p22"></span>**18** Therefore will Jehovah wait for
you,  
That he may have compassion on you;  
And therefore will he be exalted,  
That he may have compassion on you;  
For Jehovah is a God of judgment:  
Blessed are all they that wait for him.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p23"></span>**19** Surely the people in Zion shall
dwell in Jerusalem:  
Weeping thou shalt not weep;  
With compassion will he have compassion on thee;  
At the voice of thy cry, as soon as he shall hear it,  
He will answer thee.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p24"></span>**20** When the Lord shall have given
to you  
Bread of anguish  
And water of affliction,  
Thy rain shall not be withheld,  
And thine eyes shall see thy rain.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p25"></span>**21** Then shall thine ears hear a
word behind thee,  
Saying, This is the way;  
Walk ye in it;  
Whether ye go to the right,  
Or go to the left.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p26"></span>**22** Then shall ye profane  
The covering of the graven images of thy silver,  
And the covering of thy molten gold;  
And thou shalt put it away from thee as a menstruous cloth,  
And shalt say to it, Depart.  <span id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394)

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p28"></span>**23** Then will he give rain to thy
seed,  
When thou shalt have sowed the ground,  
And bread of the produce of the earth;  
And it shall be plentiful and fat;  
And in that day thy cattle  
Shall feed in large pastures.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p29"></span>**24** Thine oxen also,  
And the young asses that labour the ground,  
Shall eat clean provender,  
Which shall be winnowed with the shovel  
And with the sieve.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p30"></span>**25** And it shall come to pass,  
That on every high mountain,  
And on every lofty hill,  
Shall be streams, streams of waters,  
In the day of the great slaughter  
When the towers shall have fallen.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p31"></span>**26** And the light of the moon shall
be as the light of the sun,  
And the light of the sun shall be sevenfold,  
As the light of seven days,  
In the day when Jehovah  
Shall have bound up the breach of his people,  
And shall have healed the stroke of their wound.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p32"></span>**27** Behold! the name of Jehovah
cometh  
From a distant place:  
His face burneth,  
And the burden is heavy;  
His lips are full of indignation,  
And his tongue as a devouring fire.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p33"></span>**28** And his breath, as an
overflowing torrent,  
Shall divide even to the neck;  
To sift the nations with a useless sieve;  
And on the cheeks of the peoples  
There shall be a bridle causing to err.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p34"></span>**29** You shall have a song, as in
the night  
When a festival is kept,  
And gladness of heart,  
As of him that moveth to a pipe,  
That he may come to the mountain of Jehovah,  
To the Mighty One of Israel.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p35"></span>**30** And Jehovah shall cause to be
heard the power of his voice,  
And shall cause to be seen the descent of his arm,  
With rage of countenance,  
And with the flame of devouring fire,  
With scattering, with flood, and with hailstones.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p36"></span>**31** Verily by the voice of Jehovah
shall the Assyrian be crushed,  
Who smote with a rod.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p37"></span>**32** And in every passage shall be
the fastened staff,  
Which Jehovah shall lay upon him  
With tabrets and harps,  
And with battles of lifting up  
Shall he fight against her.

<span id="xxii.ii.xiv-p38"></span>**33** For Tophet is ordained since
yesterday;  
Yea, for the king it is prepared:  
He hath made it deep and large;  
The pile of it is fire, and much wood;  
The breath of Jehovah, like a torrent of brimstone,  
Doth kindle it.

<span id="xxii.ii.xv"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.xv-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.xv-p2"></span>CHAPTER 31

<span id="xxii.ii.xv-p3"></span>**1** Wo to them that go down into Egypt
for help,  
And who rely on horses,  
And who trust to chariots, because they are numerous,  
And to horses, because they are very strong,  
And have not looked to the Holy One of Israel,  
Nor have sought Jehovah.

<span id="xxii.ii.xv-p4"></span>**2** Yet he also is wise:  
Therefore he will bring evil,  
And will not make void his words;  
He will rise up against the house of the evil-doers,  
And against the aid of the workers of vanity.

<span id="xxii.ii.xv-p5"></span>**3** And verily the Egyptian is a man,
and not God;  
And his horses are flesh, and not spirit.  
Therefore, as soon as Jehovah shall stretch out his arm,  
The helper shall fall,  
And he who is helped shall fall down,  
And all shall fail together.

<span id="xxii.ii.xv-p6"></span>**4** For thus hath Jehovah said to
me:  
As the lion roareth,  
And the young lion for his prey,  
Against whom, if a multitude of shepherds be gathered together,  
He shall not be alarmed by their cry,  
And shall not humble himself on account of their noise;  
Thus will Jehovah of hosts come down  
To fight for Mount Zion,  
And for its hill.

<span id="xxii.ii.xv-p7"></span>**5** As birds which fly,  
So will Jehovah of hosts defend Jerusalem;  
Defending, he will deliver it,  
And passing over, he will preserve it.

<span id="xxii.ii.xv-p8"></span>**6** Return ye,  
As ye have made a deep revolt,  
O children of Israel!

<span id="xxii.ii.xv-p9"></span>**7** For in that day shall a man cast
away  
The idols of his silver,  
And the idols of his gold,  
Which your hands have made for you, a sin.

<span id="xxii.ii.xv-p10"></span>**8** Then shall the Assyrian fall by
the sword, not of a mighty man;  
And the sword, not of a man, shall devour him;  
And by flight shall he seek safety from the face of the sword,  
And his young men shall melt away.

<span id="xxii.ii.xv-p11"></span>**9** He shall pass to his stronghold
through fear,  
And his princes shall tremble at the banner, saith Jehovah,  
Who hath a fire  <span id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395) in Zion,  
And who hath a furnace in Jerusalem.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p1"></span>

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p2"></span>CHAPTER 32

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p3"></span>**1** Behold! a king shall reign in
righteousness,  
And princes shall rule in judgment.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p4"></span>**2** And that man shall be  
As a hiding-place from the wind,  
As a covert from the rain,  
As streams of waters on dry ground,  
As the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p5"></span>**3** Then the eyes of them that see
shall not be closed up,  
And the ears of them that hear shall hearken.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p6"></span>**4** And the heart of fools shall be
eagerly directed to knowledge,  
And the tongue of stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p7"></span>**5** No longer shall the base man be
called liberal,  
Nor shall the parsimonious man be called bountiful.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p8"></span>**6** For the vile person will speak
vileness,  
And his heart will contrive iniquity,  
To commit wickedness,  
That he may utter mockery against Jehovah,  
That he may make empty the hungry soul,  
And that he may withhold drink from him that is thirsty.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p9"></span>**7** The instruments of the covetous
man are evil;  <span id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396)  
He contriveth wickednesses,  
That he may deceive the simple by lying words,  
And that he may speak against the poor man in judgment.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p12"></span>**8** But the liberal man shall devise
liberal things,  
And in acting liberally he shall make progress.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p13"></span>**9** Ye women at ease, arise;  
Hear my voice, ye careless daughters;  
Hearken to my speech.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p14"></span>**10** Days above a year shall ye
tremble, ye careless women;  
For the vintage shall fail,  
And the gathering shall not come.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p15"></span>**11** Tremble, ye women that are at
ease;  
Be troubled, ye careless women;  
Strip you, make you bare, gird your limbs.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p16"></span>**12** Mourning over the udders,  
Over the pleasant fields,  
Over the fruitful vine.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p17"></span>**13** There shall come up the thorn
and brier  
On the land of my people,  
Even on all the houses of gladness in the city of rejoicing.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p18"></span>**14** For the palace shall be
forsaken;  
The noise of the city shall be left;  
The tower and the fortress  
Shall be reduced to dens for ever,  
Where wild asses may delight themselves,  
And where flocks may feed.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p19"></span>**15** Till the Spirit be poured out
upon you from on high,  
And the wilderness become a cultivated field,  
And the cultivated field be reckoned like a forest.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p20"></span>**16** And judgment shall dwell in the
wilderness,  
And justice shall have its abode in the cultivated field.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p21"></span>**17** And the work of righteousness
shall be peace;  
The effect of righteousness shall be  
Safety and quietness for ever.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p22"></span>**18** And my people shall dwell in a
tabernacle of peace,  
And in safe dwellings,  
And in quiet resting-places.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p23"></span>**19** And in coming down the hail
shall turn aside on the forest,  
And the city shall be situated in a low place.

<span id="xxii.ii.xvi-p24"></span>**20** Blessed are ye who sow on all
waters,  
Who send forth the feet of the ox and of the ass.
