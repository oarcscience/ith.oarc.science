<span id="ix-p1"></span>CHAPTER 20

<span id="ix.i"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p1"></span>Isaiah Chapter 20:1-6

<span id="ix.i-p2"></span>**1**. In the year that Tartan came unto
Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against
Ashdod, and took it;

<span id="ix.i-p3"></span>**1**. Anno quo venit Thartan in Asdod, cum
misisset eum Sargon rex Assyriæ, oppugnassetque Asdod, et cepisset;

<span id="ix.i-p4"></span>**2**. At the same time spake the Lord by
Isaiah the son Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy
loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked
and barefoot.

<span id="ix.i-p5"></span>**2**. Tempore illo, inquam, loquutus est
Iehova iu manu Isaiæ filii Amoz, dicendo: Vade et solve saccum de lumbis
tuis, et calceamentum tuum exrahe de pede tuo; fecitque sic, ambulans
nudus et discalceatus.

<span id="ix.i-p6"></span>**3**. And the Lord said, Like as my servant
Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years *for* a sign and
wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia;

<span id="ix.i-p7"></span>**3**. Et dixit Iehova: Sicut ambulavit servus
meus Isaias nudus et discalceatus tribus annis, signum et portentum
super Ægypto et Ethiopia;

<span id="ix.i-p8"></span>**4**. So shall the king of Assyria lead away
the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old,
naked and barefoot, even with *their* buttocks uncovered, to the shame
of Egypt.

<span id="ix.i-p9"></span>**4**. Ita abducet rex Assur captivitatem
Ægypti, et transmigrationem Æthiopiæ juvenum et senum, nudam et
discalceatam, et discoopertos natibus in ignominiam Ægypti.

<span id="ix.i-p10"></span>**5**. And they shall be afraid and ashamed
of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.

<span id="ix.i-p11"></span>**5**. Et timebunt, et pudefient ab Æthiopia
respectu suo, et ab Ægypto gloriatione (*vel, pulchritudine*) sua.

<span id="ix.i-p12"></span>**6**. And the inhabitant of this isle shall
say in that day, Behold, such *is* our expectation, whither we flee for
help to be delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?

<span id="ix.i-p13"></span>**6**. Dicetque incola insulæ hujus in die
illa; Ecce, quomodo habeat respectus noster, quo confugimus auxilii
causa, ut liberemur a facie regis Assur; et quomodo effugiemus nos?

<span id="ix.i-p14"></span> 

<span id="ix.i-p15"></span><span id="ix.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p16"></span>**1.** *In the year that Tartan came to
Ashdod.* In the preceding chapter Isaiah prophesied about the calamity
which threatened Egypt, and at the same time promised to it the mercy of
God. He now introduces the same subject, and shews that Israel will be
put to shame by this chastisement of the Egyptians, because they placed
their confidence in Egypt. He now joins Ethiopia, which makes it
probable that the Ethiopians were leagued with the Egyptians, as I have
formerly remarked, and as we shall see again at the thirty-seventh
chapter.

<span id="ix.i-p17"></span>First, we must observe the time of this
prediction. It was when the Jews were pressed hard by necessity to
resort, even against their will, to foreign nations for assistance.
Sacred history informs us (<span id="ix.i-p17.1"></span>[2Ki
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017)<span id="ix.i-p17.1"></span>.md)
that *Tartan* was one of Sennacherib’s captains, which constrains us to
acknowledge that this *Sargon* was Sennacherib, who had two names, as
may be easily learned from this passage. We must also consider what was
the condition of Israel, for the ten tribes had been led into captivity.
Judea appeared almost to be utterly ruined, for nearly the whole country
was conquered, except Jerusalem, which was besieged by Rabshakeh. (<span
id="ix.i-p17.2"></span>[2Ki 18:13](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#013.md)<span
id="ix.i-p17.2"></span>.) Tartan, on the other hand, was besieging
Ashdod. Sacred history (<span id="ix.i-p17.3"></span>[2Ki
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/kg2018.htm#017)<span id="ix.i-p17.3"></span>.md)
mentions three captains;  <span id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) and this
makes it probable that Sennacherib’s forces were at that time divided
into three parts, that at the same instant he might strike terror on
all, and might throw them into such perplexity and confusion that they
could not render assistance to each other. Nothing was now left for the
Jews but to call foreign nations to their aid. In the mean time, Isaiah
is sent by God to declare that their expectation is vain in relying on
the Egyptians, against whom the arm of the Lord was now lifted up, and
who were so far from assisting them, that they were unable to defend
themselves against their enemies. Hence the Jews ought to acknowledge
that they are justly punished for their unbelief, because they had
forsaken God and fled to the Egyptians.

<span id="ix.i-p20"></span>We must consider the end which is here
proposed, for the design of God was not to forewarn the Egyptians, but
to correct the unbelief of the people, which incessantly carried them
away to false and wicked hopes. In order therefore to teach them that
they ought to rely on God alone, the Prophet here foretells what awaits
their useless helpers. The warning was highly seasonable, for the
Ethiopians had begun to repel the Assyrians, and had forced them to
retire, and no event could have occurred which would have been more
gladly hailed by the Jews. Lest those successful beginnings should make
them wanton, he foretells that this aid will be of short duration,
because both the Ethiopians and the Egyptians will soon be most
disgracefully vanquished.

<span id="ix.i-p21"></span><span id="ix.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p22"></span>**2.** *Go and loose the sackcloth from thy
loins.* In order to confirm this prophecy by the use of a symbol, the
Lord commanded Isaiah to walk naked. If Isaiah had done this of his own
accord, he would have been justly ridiculed; but when he does it by the
command of the Lord, we perceive nothing but what is fitted to excite
admiration and to strike awe. In this nakedness, and in the signs of a
similar kind, something weighty is implied. Besides, the Lord does
nothing either by himself or by his servants without likewise explaining
the reason; and therefore the Prophet does not merely walk naked, but
points out the design which the Lord had in view in ordering him to do
so. In other respects false prophets imitate the true servants of God,
and put on varied and imposing shapes, to dazzle the eyes of the
multitude, and gain credit to themselves; but those symbols are
worthless, because God is not the author of them.

<span id="ix.i-p23"></span>This ought to be carefully observed in
opposition to the Papists, who bring forward empty ceremonies instead of
true sacraments. This is the rule with which we ought to meet them. If
they proceed from God, we ought to embrace them, but if not, we may
boldly reject them; and, indeed, they cannot be adopted without offering
an insult to God, because in such cases men usurp his authority.
Besides, God does not bring forward signs without the word, for what
would a sacrament be if we beheld nothing but the sign? It is the
doctrine alone that makes the sacrament, and therefore let us know that
it is mere hypocrisy where no doctrine is taught, and that Papists act
wickedly when they lay aside doctrine, and give the name of sacrament to
empty ceremonies; for the Lord has connected them in such a manner that
no man can separate them without infringing that order which he has
enjoined.

<span id="ix.i-p24"></span>When the Lord commands him to *loose the
sackcloth;* almost all the commentators infer from it that Isaiah at
that time wore a garment of mourning, because he bewailed the distressed
condition of Israel; for sackcloth was a mourning dress, as is evident
from Joel (<span id="ix.i-p24.1"></span>[Joe
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/joe001.htm#013)<span id="ix.i-p24.1"></span>..md)
Their interpretation is, that this was done in order that, in the dress
of culprits, he might supplicate pardon from God, or that it was
impossible for his countenance or his dress to be cheerful when his
heart was sad, and he could not but be affected with the deepest grief
when he beheld so great a calamity. Some think that it was his ordinary
dress, because the Prophets, as Zechariah informs us, commonly wore a
mantle. (<span id="ix.i-p24.2"></span>[Zec
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/zac013.htm#004)<span id="ix.i-p24.2"></span>..md)
But that conjecture rests on exceedingly slight grounds, and has no
great probability. It is more probable that he wore sackcloth as
expressive of mourning. Judea was at that time sunk into such a state of
indifference, that when men saw their brethren wretchedly distressed and
wasted, still they were not affected by it, and did not think that the
affliction of their brethren was a matter which at all concerned them.
They still thought that they were beyond the reach of danger, and mocked
at the Prophets when they threatened and foretold destruction. Hence
Micah also complains that no man bewails the distresses of Israel.
(<span id="ix.i-p24.3"></span>[Mic
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#011)<span id="ix.i-p24.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.i-p25"></span>A question arises, Was this actually done, or
was it merely and simply a vision which he told to the people? The
general opinion is, that the Prophet never went naked, but that this was
exhibited to him in a vision, and only once. They allege as a reason,
that on account of heat and cold, and other inconveniences of the
weather, he could not have walked naked during the whole period of three
years. What if we should say that the Prophet wore clothes at home, and
also in public, unless when he wished to come forth to teach, and that
on such occasions he was accustomed to present to the people a spectacle
of nakedness? I pay little attention to the argument, that he was unable
to endure heat and cold; for God, who commanded him to do this, could
easily strengthen and protect him. But they assign another reason, that
nakedness would have been unbecoming in a Prophet. I answer, this
nakedness was not more unbecoming than circumcision, which irreligious
men might consider to be the most absurd of all sights, because it made
an exposure of the uncomely parts. Yet it must not be thought that the
Prophet went entirely naked, or without covering those parts which would
present a revolting aspect. It was enough that the people understood
what the Lord was doing, and were affected by it as something
extraordinary.

<span id="ix.i-p26"></span>I am led to form this opinion by what is here
said, “*By the hand* of Isaiah;” for although this mode of expression
frequently occurs elsewhere, still we never find it where it does not
imply something emphatic, to describe the effect produced. He places
himself in the midst between God and his countrymen, so as to be the
herald of a future calamity, not only in words, but likewise by a
visible symbol. Nor is it superfluous that it is immediately added, *He
did so*. I am therefore of opinion that Isaiah walked naked whenever he
discharged the office of a prophet, and that he uncovered those parts
which could be beheld without shame.

<span id="ix.i-p27"></span>So far as relates to *sackcloth*, although it
was customary for men in private stations of life to express their guilt
in this manner in adversity, yet it is probable that it was with a view
to his office that Isaiah made use of this symbol to confirm his
doctrine, that he might the better arouse the people from their
sluggishness. If at any time the Lord chastise ourselves or our
brethren, he does not enjoin us to change our raiment, but we are cruel
and (<span id="ix.i-p27.1"></span>ἄστοργοι) without natural affection,
if we are not moved by the afflictions of brethren and the ruin of the
Church. If we have any feeling towards God, we ought to be in sadness
and tears; and if it be our duty to mourn, we ought also to exhort
others and stimulate them by our example to feel the calamities of the
Church, and to be touched with some (<span
id="ix.i-p27.2"></span>συμπαθείᾳ) compassion.

<span id="ix.i-p28"></span><span id="ix.i-p28.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p29"></span>**3.** *Three years.* Why for such a period?
Because that was the time granted to the Egyptians and Ethiopians,
during which the Lord gave them a truce for repentance, and at the same
time wished to make trial of the obedience of his people, that without
delay they might relinquish unlawful aid, and that, though the Egyptians
and Ethiopians appeared to be secure, they might know that they were not
far from ruin. The Lord intended also to expose the rebellion of wicked
men; for undoubtedly many persons made an open display of their impiety
when they despised the nakedness of the prophet, and the godly, on the
other hand, moved by the sight of his nakedness, though the prosperity
of the Ethiopians was delightfully attractive, still did not hesitate to
fix their attention on the word. What they were bound to consider was
not the nakedness itself, but the mark which the Lord had put upon it;
in the same manner as, in the visible sacraments, we ought to behold
those things which are invisible.

<span id="ix.i-p30"></span><span id="ix.i-p30.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p31"></span>**4.** *The captivity of Egypt and the
removal of Ethiopia.*  <span id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md) The words
“captivity” and “removal” are taken collectively, to denote the
multitude of captives and emigrants. Next, he shews that there will be
no distinction of age, declaring that the *old*, as well as the *young*,
shall be led into captivity.

<span id="ix.i-p33"></span><span id="ix.i-p33.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p34"></span>**5.** *And they shall be afraid.* He now
shews for whose benefit he had foretold these things about the Egyptians
and Ethiopians. It was in order that the Jews might learn amidst their
afflictions to hope in God, and might not have recourse to foreign aid,
which the Lord had forbidden.

<span id="ix.i-p35"></span><span id="ix.i-p35.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p36"></span>**6.** *Lo, what is become of our
expectation?* He calls them *expectation*, or *lurking*, because the
Jews turned towards them, whenever they were oppressed by any calamity,
and placed their hope in them. We are accustomed to turn our eyes to
that quarter from which we expect any assistance. Hence also, to “look”
often signifies, in the Hebrew language, to “hope.” (<span
id="ix.i-p36.1"></span>[Ps. 34:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#005.md), [Job
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/job006.htm#019)<span id="ix.i-p36.1"></span>..md)
Now, they ought to have looked to God alone. Their wandering levity is
therefore censured. And the same thing must happen to us, and
deservedly, that when we have been invited by God, and refuse the sure
refuge which he offers to us, and allow ourselves to be captivated by
the delusions of Satan, we may lie down naked and destitute with shame
and disgrace.

<span id="ix.i-p37"></span>*And the inhabitants of the island shall
say.* He gives the name *island* not only to Jerusalem, but to the whole
of Judea; and it is generally thought that the name is given because its
shores are washed by the Mediterranean sea. But I think that there is a
different reason for this metaphor, for it is but a small portion of the
sea that washes it; but as an *island* is separated from other lands, so
the Lord separated Judea from other countries. It was kept apart from
all the nations, which cherished a mortal hatred towards the Jews; for
there was a “wall” between them, as Paul says, (<span
id="ix.i-p37.1"></span>[Eph 2:14](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014.md)<span
id="ix.i-p37.1"></span>,) which Christ at length threw down. Here again
Isaiah confirms his prophecy. If you are not now moved by my nakedness,
you shall one day be taught by the event, that these words were not
spoken to you in vain. Thus, at a late hour, obstinate and rebellious
men are constrained by God to confess their guilt, so that they are
struck with amazement, and argue within themselves how they could be so
greatly blinded by their own stubbornness.
