<span id="xviii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 14

<span id="xviii.i"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p1"></span><span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>[Romans
14:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#001.md)<span id="xviii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Him that is weak in the faith
receive ye, *but* not to doubtful disputations.

<span id="xviii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Eum vero qui fide est imbecilla,
suscipite, non ad disceptationes quaestionum.

<span id="xviii.i-p4"></span>**2.** For one believeth that he may eat
all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.

<span id="xviii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Qui credit, vescatur quibusvis: qui
autem infirmus est, olera edit.

<span id="xviii.i-p6"></span>**3.** Let not him that eateth despise him
that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth:
for God hath received him.

<span id="xviii.i-p7"></span>**3.** Qui edit, non contemnat eum qui
abstinet; et qui abstinet, eum non condemnet qui edit: Dominus enim
illum suscepit.

<span id="xviii.i-p8"></span>**4.** Who art thou that judgest another
man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall
be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.

<span id="xviii.i-p9"></span>**4.** Tu quis es qui judicas alienum
servum? proprio Domino stat vel cadit. Stabit vero: potens est enim Dens
efficere ut stet.

<span id="xviii.i-p10"></span><span id="xviii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p11"></span>**1.** *Him indeed, etc.* He passes on now
to lay down a precept especially necessary for the instruction of the
Church, — that they who have made the most progress in Christian
doctrine should accommodate themselves to the more ignorant, and employ
their own strength to sustain their weakness; for among the people of
God there are some weaker than others, and who, except they are treated
with great tenderness and kindness, will be discouraged, and become at
length alienated from religion. And it is very probable that this
happened especially at that time; for the Churches were formed of both
Jews and Gentiles; some of whom, having been long accustomed to the
rites of the Mosaic law, having been brought up in them from childhood,
were not easily drawn away from them; and there were others who, having
never learnt such things, refused a yoke to which they had not been
accustomed.  <span id="fr_412"></span>[413](#fn_412.md)

<span id="xviii.i-p13"></span>Now, as man’s disposition is to slide from
a difference in opinion to quarrels and contentions, the Apostle shows
how they who thus vary in their opinions may live together without any
discord; and he prescribes this as the best mode, — that they who are
strong should spend their labor in assisting the weak, and that they who
have made the greatest advances should bear with the more ignorant. For
God, by making us stronger than others, does not bestow strength that we
may oppress the weak; nor is it the part of Christian wisdom to be above
measure insolent, and to despise others. The import then of what he
addresses to the more intelligent and the already confirmed, is this, —
that the ampler the grace which they had received from the Lord, the
more bound they were to help their neighbors.

<span id="xviii.i-p14"></span>*Not for the debatings of questions.*
 <span id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) This is a defective sentence,
as the word which is necessary to complete the sense is wanting. It
appears, however, evident, that he meant nothing else than that the weak
should not be wearied with fruitless disputes. But we must remember the
subject he now handles: for as many of the Jews still clave to the
shadows of the law, he indeed admits, that this was a fault in them; he
yet requires that they should be for a time excused; for to press the
matter urgently on them might have shaken their faith.  <span
id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md)

<span id="xviii.i-p17"></span>He then calls those contentious questions
which disturb a mind not yet sufficiently established, or which involve
it in doubts. It may at the same time be proper to extend this farther,
even to any thorny and difficult questions, by which weak consciences,
without any edification, may be disquieted and disturbed. We ought then
to consider what questions any one is able to bear, and to accommodate
our teaching to the capacity of individuals.

<span id="xviii.i-p18"></span><span id="xviii.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p19"></span>**2.** *Let him who believes, etc.* What
<span id="xviii.i-p19.1"></span>Erasmus has followed among the various
readings I know not; but he has mutilated this sentence, which, in
Paul’s words, is complete; and instead of the relative article he has
improperly introduced <span id="xviii.i-p19.2"></span>*alius* — one,
“One indeed believes,” etc. That I take the infinitive for an
imperative, ought not to appear unnatural nor strained, for it is a mode
of speaking very usual with Paul.  <span
id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) He then calls those believers who were
endued with a conscience fully satisfied; to these he allowed the use of
all things without any difference. In the mean time the weak did eat
herbs, and abstained from those things, the use of which he thought was
not lawful. If the common version be more approved, the meaning then
will be, — that it is not right that he who freely eats all things, as
he believes them to be lawful, should require those, who are yet tender
and weak in faith, to walk by the same rule. But to render the word
*sick,* as some have done, is absurd.

<span id="xviii.i-p22"></span><span id="xviii.i-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p23"></span>**3.** *Let not him who eats, etc.* He
wisely and suitably meets the faults of both parties. They who were
strong had this fault, — that they despised those as superstitious who
were scrupulous about insignificant things, and also derided them:
these, on the other hand, were hardly able to refrain from rash
judgments, so as not to condemn what they did not follow; for whatever
they perceived to be contrary to their own sentiments, they thought was
evil. Hence he exhorts the former to refrain from contempt, and the
latter from excessive moroseness. And the reason which he adds, as it
belongs to both parties, ought to be applied to the two clauses, — “When
you see,” he says, “a man illuminated with the knowledge of God, you
have evidence enough that he is received by the Lord; if you either
despise or condemn him, you reject him whom God has embraced.”  <span
id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md)

<span id="xviii.i-p25"></span><span id="xviii.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p26"></span>**4.** *Who art thou who judgest, etc.*
“As you would act uncourteously, yea, and presumptuously among men, were
you to bring another man’s servant, under your own rules, and try all
his acts by the rule of your own will; so you assume too much, if you
condemn anything in God’s servant, because it does not please you; for
it belongs not to you to prescribe to him what to do and what not to do,
nor is it necessary for him to live according to your law.”

<span id="xviii.i-p27"></span>Now, though the power of judging as to the
person, and also as to the deed, is taken from us, there is yet much
difference between the two; for we ought to leave the man, whatever he
may be, to the judgment of God; but as to his deeds we may indeed form a
decisive opinion, though not according to our own views, but according
to the word of God; and the judgment, derived from his word, is neither
human, nor another man’s judgment. Paul then intended here to restrain
us from presumption in judging; into which they fall, who dare to
pronounce anything respecting the actions of men without the warrant of
God’s word.

<span id="xviii.i-p28"></span>*To his own Lord he stands or falls, etc.*
As though he said, — “It belongs rightly to the Lord, either to
disapprove, or to accept what his servant doeth: hence he robs the Lord,
who attempts to take to himself this authority.” And he adds, *he shall
indeed stand:* and by so saying, he not only bids us to abstain from
condemning, but also exhorts us to mercy and kindness, so as ever to
hope well of him, in whom we perceive anything of God; inasmuch as the
Lord has given us a hope, that he will fully confirm, and lead to
perfection, those in whom he has begun the work of grace.

<span id="xviii.i-p29"></span>But by referring to the power of God, he
means not simply, as though he had said, that God can do this if he
will; but, after the usual manner of Scripture, he connects God’s will
with his power: and yet he speaks not here of perpetuity, as though they
must stand to the end whom God has once raised up; but he only reminds
us, that we are to entertain a good hope, and that our judgments should
lean this way; as he also teaches us in another place,

<span id="xviii.i-p30"></span>“He who began in you a good work, will
perform it to the end.” (<span id="xviii.i-p30.1"></span>[Php
1:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#006)<span id="xviii.i-p30.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xviii.i-p31"></span>In short, Paul shows to what side their
judgments incline, in whom love abounds.

<span id="xviii.ii"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Romans
14:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#005.md)<span id="xviii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p2"></span>**5.** One man esteemeth one day above
another: another esteemeth every day *alike*. Let every man be fully
persuaded in his own mind.

<span id="xviii.ii-p3"></span>**5.** Hic quidem diem prae die aestimat;
ille autem peraque aestimat omnem diem. Unusquisque sententiae suae
certus sit.

<span id="xviii.ii-p4"></span>**6.** He that regardeth the day,
regardeth *it* unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the
Lord he doth not regard *it*. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he
giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not,
and giveth God thanks.

<span id="xviii.ii-p5"></span>**6.** Qui curat diem, Domino curat; qui
non curat diem, Domino non curat. Qui vescitur, Domino vescitur, gratias
enim agit Deo; et qui abstinet, Domino abstinet, et gratias agit Deo.

<span id="xviii.ii-p6"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p7"></span>**5.** *One indeed, etc.* He had spoken
before of scruples in the choice of meats; he now adds another example
of difference, that is, as to days; and both these arose from Judaism.
For as the Lord in his law made a difference between meats and
pronounced some to be unclean, the use of which he prohibited, and as he
had also appointed festal and solemn days and commanded them to be
observed, the Jews, who had been brought up from their childhood in the
doctrine of the law, would not lay aside that reverence for days which
they had entertained from the beginning, and to which through life they
had been accustomed; nor could they have dared to touch these meats from
which they had so long abstained. That they were imbued with these
notions, was an evidence of their weakness; they would have thought
otherwise, had they possessed a certain and a clear knowledge of
Christian liberty. But in abstaining from what they thought to be
unlawful, they evidenced piety, as it would have been a proof of
presumption and contempt, had they done anything contrary to the
dictates of conscience.

<span id="xviii.ii-p8"></span>Here then the Apostle applies the best
rule, when he bids every one to be fully assured as to his own mind; by
which he intimates that there ought to be in Christians such a care for
obedience, that they do nothing, except what they think, or rather feel
assured, is pleasing to God.  <span id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md)
And this ought to be thoroughly borne in mind, that it is the first
principle of a right conduct, that men should be dependent on the will
of God, and never allow themselves to move even a finger, while the mind
is doubtful and vacillating; for it cannot be otherwise, but that
rashness will soon pass over into obstinacy when we dare to proceed
further than what we are persuaded is lawful for us. If any object and
say, that infirmity is ever perplexing, and that hence such certainty as
Paul requires cannot exist in the weak: to this the plain answer is, —
That such are to be pardoned, if they keep themselves within their own
limits. For Paul’s purpose was none other than to restrain undue
liberty, by which it happens, that many thrust themselves, as it were,
at random, into matters which are doubtful and undetermined. Hence Paul
requires this to be adopted, — that the will of God is to preside over
all our actions.

<span id="xviii.ii-p10"></span><span id="xviii.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.ii-p11"></span>**6.** *He who regards a day, etc.* Since
Paul well knew that a respect for days proceeded from ignorance of
Christ, it is not probable that such a corruption was altogether
defended by him; and yet his words seem to imply, that he who regarded
days committed no sin; for nothing but good can be accepted by God.
Hence, that you may understand his purpose, it is necessary to
distinguish between the notion, which any one may have entertained as to
the observance of days, and the observance itself to which he felt
himself bound. The notion was indeed superstitious, nor does Paul deny
this; for he has already condemned it by calling it infirmity, and he
will again condemn it still more plainly. Now, that he who was held fast
by this superstition, dared not to violate the solemnity of a particular
day; this was approved by God, because he dared not to do any thing with
a doubtful conscience. What indeed could the Jew do, who had not yet
made such progress, as to be delivered from scruples about days? He had
the word of God, in which the keeping of days was commended; there was a
necessity laid on him by the law; and its abrogation was not clearly
seen by him. Nothing then remained, but that he, waiting for a fuller
revelation, should keep himself within the limits of his own knowledge,
and not to avail himself of the benefit of liberty, before he embraced
it by faith.  <span id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md)

<span id="xviii.ii-p13"></span>The same also must be thought of him who
refrained from unclean meats: for if he ate in a doubtful state of mind,
it would not have been to receive any benefit, from God’s hand, but to
lay his own hand on forbidden things. Let him then use other things,
which he thinks is allowed to him, and follow the measure of his
knowledge: he will thus give thanks to God; which he could not do,
except he was persuaded that he is fed by God’s kindness. He is not then
to be despised, as though he offended the Lord by this his temperance
and pious timidity: and there is nothing unreasonable in the matter, if
we say, that the modesty of the weak is approved by God, not on the
ground of merit, but through indulgence.

<span id="xviii.ii-p14"></span>But as he had before required an
assurance of mind, so that no one ought rashly of his own will to do
this or that, we ought to consider whether he is here exhorting rather
than affirming; for the text would better flow in this strain, — “Let a
reason for what he does be clear to every one; as an account must be
given before the celestial tribunal; for whether one eats meat or
abstains, he ought in both instances to have regard to God.” And
doubtless there is nothing more fitted to restrain licentiousness in
judging and to correct superstitions, than to be summoned before the
tribunal of God: and hence Paul wisely sets the judge before all, to
whose will they are to refer whatever they do. It is no objection that
the sentence is affirmative; for he immediately subjoins, that no one
lives or dies for himself; where he declares, not what men do, but
commands what they ought to do.

<span id="xviii.ii-p15"></span>Observe also what he says, — that we then
eat to the Lord, or abstain, when we give thanks. Hence, eating is
impure, and abstinence is impure, without thanksgiving. It is only the
name of God, when invoked, that sanctifies us and all we have.

<span id="xviii.iii"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Romans
14:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#007.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p2"></span>**7.** For none of us liveth to himself,
and no man dieth to himself.

<span id="xviii.iii-p3"></span>**7.** Nemo enim nostrum sibi ipsi vivit,
et nemo sibi moritur.

<span id="xviii.iii-p4"></span>**8.** For whether we live, we live unto
the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live
therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.

<span id="xviii.iii-p5"></span>**8.** Sive enim vivimus, Domino vivimus;
sive morimur, Domino morimur: sive vivimus sive morimur, Domini sumus.

<span id="xviii.iii-p6"></span>**9.** For to this end Christ both died,
and rose, and revived,  <span id="fr_419"></span>[420](#fn_419.md) that he
might be Lord both of the dead and living.

<span id="xviii.iii-p8"></span>**9.** In hoc enim et mortuus est
Christus, et resurrexit, et revixit,  <span
id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) ut vivis dominetur et mortuis.

<span id="xviii.iii-p10"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p11"></span>**7.** *For no one of us, etc.* He now
confirms the former verse by an argument derived from the whole to a
part, — that it is no matter of wonder that particular acts of our life
should be referred to the Lord’s will, since life itself ought to be
wholly spent to his glory; for then only is the life of a Christian
rightly formed, when it has for its object the will of God. But if thou
oughtest to refer whatever thou doest to his good pleasure, it is then
an act of impiety to undertake anything whatever, which thou thinkest
will displease him; nay, which thou art not persuaded will please him.

<span id="xviii.iii-p12"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p13"></span>**8.** *To the Lord we live, etc.* This
does not mean the same as when it is said in <span
id="xviii.iii-p13.1"></span>[Ro
6:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#011.md)<span
id="xviii.iii-p13.1"></span>, that we are made *alive unto God* by his
Spirit, but that we conform to his will and pleasure, and design all
things to his glory. Nor are we only to live to the Lord, but also to
die; that is, our death as well as our life is to be referred to his
will. He adds the best of reasons, for *whether we live or die, we are
his:* and it hence follows, that he has full authority over our life and
our death.

<span id="xviii.iii-p14"></span>The application of this doctrine opens
into a wide field. God thus claims authority over life and death, that
his own condition might be borne by every one as a yoke laid on him; for
it is but just that he should assign to every one his station and his
course of life. And thus we are not only forbidden rashly to attempt
this or that without God’s command, but we are also commanded to be
patient under all troubles and losses. If at any time the flesh draws
back in adversities, let it come to our minds, that he who is not free
nor has authority over himself, perverts right and order if he depends
not on the will of his lord. Thus also is taught us the rule by which we
are to live and to die, so that if he extends our life in continual
sorrows and miseries, we are not yet to seek to depart before our time;
but if he should suddenly call us hence in the flower of our age, we
ought ever to be ready for our departure.

<span id="xviii.iii-p15"></span><span id="xviii.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iii-p16"></span>**9.** *For to this end Christ also
died, etc.* This is a confirmation of the reason which has been last
mentioned; for in order to prove that we ought to live and to die to the
Lord, he had said, that whether we live or die we are under the power of
Christ. He now shows how rightly Christ claims this power over us, since
he has obtained it by so great a price; for by undergoing death for our
salvation, he has acquired authority over us which cannot be destroyed
by death, and by rising again, he has received our whole life as his
peculiar property. He has then by his death and resurrection deserved
that we should, in death as well as in life, advance the glory of his
name. The words *arose and lived again* mean, that by resurrection he
attained a new state of life; and that as the life which he now
possesses is subject to no change, his dominion over us is to be
eternal.

<span id="xviii.iv"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p1"></span><span id="xviii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Romans
14:10-13](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#010.md)<span
id="xviii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p2"></span>**10.** But why dost thou judge thy
brother?  <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md) or why dost thou set
at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat
of Christ.

<span id="xviii.iv-p4"></span>**10.** Tu vero quid judicas fratrem tuum?
aut etiam tu, quid contemnis fratrem tuum? Onmes enim sistemur ad
tribunal Christi:

<span id="xviii.iv-p5"></span>**11.** For it is written, *As* I live,
saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall
confess to God.

<span id="xviii.iv-p6"></span>**11.** Scripture est enim, Vivo ego, dick
Dominus, mihi flectetur omne genu, et omnis lingua confitebitur Deo.

<span id="xviii.iv-p7"></span>**12.** So then every one of us shall give
account of himself to God.

<span id="xviii.iv-p8"></span>**12.** Unusquisque igitur de se rationem
redder Deo.

<span id="xviii.iv-p9"></span>**13.** Let us not therefore judge one
another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a
stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in *his* brother’s way.

<span id="xviii.iv-p10"></span>**13.** Quare ne amplius judicemus alius
alium: sed hoc judicate potius, ne lapsus occasio detur fratri aut
offendiculum.

<span id="xviii.iv-p11"></span><span id="xviii.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p12"></span>**10.** *But thou, why dost thou, etc.*
As he had made the life and death of us all subject to Christ, he now
proceeds to mention the authority to judge, which the Father has
conferred on him, together with the dominion over heaven and earth. He
hence concludes, that it is an unreasonable boldness in any one to
assume the power to judge his brother, since by taking such a liberty he
robs Christ the Lord of the power which he alone has received from the
Father.

<span id="xviii.iv-p13"></span>But first, by the term *brother,* he
checks this lust for judging; for since the Lord has established among
us the right of a fraternal alliance, an equality ought to be preserved;
every one then who assumes the character of a judge acts unreasonably.
Secondly, he calls us before the only true judge, from whom no one can
take away his power, and whose tribunal none can escape. As then it
would be absurd among men for a criminal, who ought to occupy a humble
place in the court, to ascend the tribunal of the judge; so it is absurd
for a Christian to take to himself the liberty of judging the conscience
of his brother. A similar argument is mentioned by James, when he says,
that “he who judges his brother, judges the law,” and that “he who
judges the law, is not an observer of the law but a president;” and, on
the other hand, he says, that “there is but one lawgiver, who can save
and destroy.” (<span id="xviii.iv-p13.1"></span>[Jas
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/jam004.htm#012.md)<span
id="xviii.iv-p13.1"></span>.) He has ascribed *tribunal* to Christ,
which means his power to judge, as the voice of the archangel, by which
we shall be summoned, is called, in another place, a trumpet; for it
will pierce, as it were with its sound, into the minds and ears of all.
 <span id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md)

<span id="xviii.iv-p15"></span><span id="xviii.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p16"></span>**11.** *As I live, etc.* He seems to me
to have quoted this testimony of the Prophet, not so much to prove what
he had said of the judgment-seat of Christ, which was not doubted among
Christians, as to show that judgment ought to be looked for by all with
the greatest humility and lowliness of mind; and this is what the words
import. He had first then testified by his own words, that the power to
judge all men is vested in Christ alone; he now demonstrates by the
words of the Prophet, that all flesh ought to be humbled while expecting
that judgment; and this is expressed by the bending of the knee. But
though in this passage of the Prophet the Lord in general foreshows that
his glory should be known among all nations, and that his majesty should
everywhere shine forth, which was then hid among very few, and as it
were in an obscure corner of the world; yet if we examine it more
closely, it will be evident that its complete fulfillment is not now
taking place, nor has it ever taken place, nor is it to be hoped for in
future ages. God does not now rule otherwise in the world than by his
gospel; nor is his majesty otherwise rightly honored but when it is
adored as known from his word. But the word of God has ever had its
enemies, who have been perversely resisting it, and its despisers, who
have ever treated it with ridicule, as though it were absurd and
fabulous. Even at this day there are many such, and ever will be. It
hence appears, that this prophecy is indeed begun to be fulfilled in
this life, but is far from being completed, and will not be so until the
day of the last resurrection shall shine forth, when Christ’s enemies
shall be laid prostrate, that they may become his footstool. But this
cannot be except the Lord shall ascend his tribunal: he has therefore
suitably applied this testimony to the judgment-seat of Christ.

<span id="xviii.iv-p17"></span>This is also a remarkable passage for the
purpose of confirming our faith in the eternal divinity of Christ: for
it is God who speaks here, and the God who has once for all declared,
that he will not give his glory to another. (<span
id="xviii.iv-p17.1"></span>[Isa
42:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#008.md)<span
id="xviii.iv-p17.1"></span>.) Now if what he claims here to himself
alone is accomplished in Christ, then doubtless he in Christ manifests
himself And unquestionably the truth of this prophecy then openly
appeared, when Christ gathered a people to himself from the whole world,
and restored them to the worship of his majesty and to the obedience of
his gospel. To this purpose are the words of Paul, when he says that God
gave a name to his Christ, at which every knee should bow, (<span
id="xviii.iv-p17.2"></span>[Php
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010.md)<span
id="xviii.iv-p17.2"></span>:) and it shall then still more fully appear,
when he shall ascend his tribunal to judge the living and the dead; for
all judgment in heaven and on earth has been given to him by the Father.

<span id="xviii.iv-p18"></span>The words of the Prophet are, “Every
tongue shall swear to me:” but as an oath is a kind of divine worship,
the word which Paul uses, *shall confess,* does not vary in sense:
 <span id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) for the Lord intended simply to
declare, that all men should not only acknowledge his majesty, but also
make a confession of obedience, both by the mouth and by the external
gesture of the body, which he has designated by the bowing of the knee.

<span id="xviii.iv-p20"></span><span id="xviii.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p21"></span>**12.** *Every one of us, etc.* This
conclusion invites us to humility and lowliness of mind: and hence he
immediately draws this inference, — that *we are not to judge one
another;* for it is not lawful for us to usurp the office of judging,
who must ourselves submit to be judged and to give an account.

<span id="xviii.iv-p22"></span>From the various significations of the
word to judge, he has aptly drawn two different meanings. In the first
place he forbids us to judge, that is, to condemn; in the second place
he bids us to judge, that is, to exercise judgment, so as not to give
offense. He indeed indirectly reproves those malignant censors, who
employ all their acuteness in finding out something faulty in the life
of their brethren: he therefore bids them to exercise wariness
themselves; for by their neglect they often precipitate, or drive their
brethren against some stumblingblock or another.  <span

<span id="xviii.v-p2"></span>**14.** I know, and am persuaded by the
Lord Jesus,  <span id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) that *there* is
nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be
unclean, to him *it is* unclean.

<span id="xviii.v-p4"></span>**14.** Novi et persuasus sum in Domino
Iesu, nihil commune per se esse; nisi qui existimat aliquid esse
commune, ei commune est.

<span id="xviii.v-p5"></span>**15.** But if thy brother be grieved with
*thy* meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy
meat, for whom Christ died.

<span id="xviii.v-p6"></span>**15.** Verum si propter cibum frater tuus
contristatur, jam non secundum charitatem ambulas; ne cibo tuo ilium
perdas, pro quo Christus mortuus est.

<span id="xviii.v-p7"></span>**16.** Let not then your good be evil
spoken of:

<span id="xviii.v-p8"></span>**16.** Ne vestrum igitur bonum hominum
maledicentiae sit obnoxium:

<span id="xviii.v-p9"></span>**17.** For the kingdom of God is not meat
and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.

<span id="xviii.v-p10"></span>**17.** Non enim est regnum Dei esca et
potus; sed justitia, et pax, et gaudium in Spiritu sancto.

<span id="xviii.v-p11"></span>**18.** For he that in these things
serveth Christ *is* acceptable to God, and approved of men.

<span id="xviii.v-p12"></span>**18.** Qui enim servit per haec Christo,
acceptus est Deo, et probatus hominibus.

<span id="xviii.v-p13"></span><span id="xviii.v-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.v-p14"></span>**14.** *I know, etc.* To anticipate their
objection, who made such progress in the gospel of Christ as to make no
distinction between meats, he first shows what must be thought of meats
when viewed in themselves; and then he subjoins how sin is committed in
the use of them. He then declares, that no meat is impure to a right and
pure conscience, and that there is no hindrance to a pure use of meats,
except ignorance and infirmity; for when any imagines an impurity in
them, he is not at liberty to use them. But he afterwards adds, that we
are not only to regard meats themselves, but also the brethren before
whom we eat: for we ought not to view the use of God’s bounty with so
much indifference as to disregard love. His words then have the same
meaning as though he had said, — “I know that all meats are clean, and
therefore I leave to thee the free use of them; I allow thy conscience
to be freed from all scruples: in short, I do not simply restrain thee
from meats; but laying aside all regard for them, I still wish thee not
to neglect thy neighbor.”

<span id="xviii.v-p15"></span>By the word *common,* in this place, he
means unclean, and what is taken indiscriminately by the ungodly; and it
is opposed to those things which had been especially set apart for the
use of the faithful people. He says that he knew, and was fully
convinced, that all meats are pure, in order to remove all doubts. He
adds*, in the Lord Jesus;* for by his favor and grace it is, that all
the creatures which were accursed in Adam, are blessed to us by the
Lord.  <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) He intended, however, at
the same time, to set the liberty given by Christ in opposition to the
bondage of the law, lest they thought that they were bound to observe
those rites from which Christ had made them free. By the exception which
he has laid down, we learn that there is nothing so pure but what may be
contaminated by a corrupt conscience: for it is faith alone and
godliness which sanctify all things to us. The unbelieving, being
polluted within, defile all things by their very touch. (<span
id="xviii.v-p16.3"></span>Titus 1:15.)

<span id="xviii.v-p17"></span><span id="xviii.v-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.v-p18"></span>**15.** *But if through meat thy brother
is grieved, etc.* He now explains how the offending of our brethren may
vitiate the use of good things. And the first thing is, — that love is
violated, when our brother is made to grieve by what is so trifling; for
it is contrary to love to occasion grief to any one. The next thing is,
— that when the weak conscience is wounded, the price of Christ’s blood
is wasted; for the most abject brother has been redeemed by the blood of
Christ: it is then a heinous crime to destroy him by gratifying the
stomach; and we must be basely given up to our own lusts, if we prefer
meat, a worthless thing, to Christ.  <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) The third reason is, — that since the
liberty attained for us by Christ is a blessing, we ought to take care,
lest it should be evil spoken of by men and justly blamed, which is the
case, when we unseasonably use God’s gifts. These reasons then ought to
influence us, lest by using our liberty, we thoughtlessly cause
offenses.  <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md)

<span id="xviii.v-p21"></span><span id="xviii.v-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.v-p22"></span>**17.** *For the kingdom of God, etc.* He
now, on the other hand, teaches us, that we can without loss abstain
from the use of our liberty, because the kingdom of God does not consist
in such things. Those things indeed, which are necessary either to build
up or preserve the kingdom of God, are by no means to be neglected,
whatever offenses may hence follow: but if for love’s sake it be lawful
to abstain from meat, while God’s honor is uninjured, while Christ’s
kingdom suffers no harm, while religion is not hindered, then they are
not to be borne with, who for meat’s sake disturb the Church. He uses
similar arguments in his first Epistle to the Corinthians:

<span id="xviii.v-p23"></span>“Meat,” he says, “for the stomach, and the
stomach for meat; but God will destroy both,” (<span
id="xviii.v-p23.1"></span>[1Co
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013)<span id="xviii.v-p23.1"></span>:.md)

<span id="xviii.v-p24"></span>again,

<span id="xviii.v-p25"></span>“If we eat, we shall not abound,” (<span
id="xviii.v-p25.1"></span>[1Co
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#008)<span id="xviii.v-p25.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xviii.v-p26"></span>By these words he meant briefly to show,
that meat and drink were things too worthless, that on their account the
course of the gospel should be impeded.

<span id="xviii.v-p27"></span>*But righteousness and peace, etc.* He, in
passing, has set these in opposition to meat and drink; not for the
purpose of enumerating all the things which constitute the kingdom of
Christ, but of showing, that it consists of spiritual things. He has at
the same time no doubt included in few words a summary of what it is;
namely, that we, being well assured, have peace with God, and possess
real joy of heart through the Holy Spirit dwelling in us. But as I have
said, these few things he has accommodated to his present subject. He
indeed who is become partaker of true righteousness, enjoys a great and
an invaluable good, even a calm joy of conscience; and he who has
*peace* with God, what can he desire more?  <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md)

<span id="xviii.v-p29"></span>By connecting *peace* and *joy* together,
he seems to me to express the character of this joy; for however torpid
the reprobate may be, or however they may elevate themselves, yet the
conscience is not rendered calm and joyful, except when it feels God to
be pacified and propitious to it; and there is no solid joy but what
proceeds from this peace. And though it was necessary, when mention was
made of these things, that the Spirit should have been declared as the
author; yet he meant in this place indirectly to oppose the Spirit to
external things, that we might know, that the things which belong to the
kingdom of God continue complete to us without the use of meats.

<span id="xviii.v-p30"></span><span id="xviii.v-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.v-p31"></span>**18.** *For he who in these things, etc.*
An argument drawn from the effect: for it is impossible, but that when
any one is acceptable to God and approved by men, the kingdom of God
fully prevails and flourishes in him: he, who with a quiet and peaceful
conscience serves Christ in righteousness, renders himself approved by
men as well as by God. Wherever then there is righteousness and peace
and spiritual joy, there the kingdom of God is complete in all its
parts: it does not then consist of material things. But he says, that
man is acceptable to God, because he obeys his will; he testifies that
he is approved by men, because they cannot do otherwise than bear
testimony to that excellency which they see with their eyes: not that
the ungodly always favor the children of God; nay, when there is no
cause, they often pour forth against them many reproaches, and with
forged calumnies defame the innocent, and in a word, turn into vices
things rightly done, by putting on them a malignant construction. But
Paul speaks here of honest judgment, blended with no moroseness, no
hatred, no superstition.

<span id="xviii.vi"></span>

<span id="xviii.vi-p1"></span><span id="xviii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Romans
14:19-21](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#019.md)<span
id="xviii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.vi-p2"></span>**19.** Let us therefore follow after the
things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.

<span id="xviii.vi-p3"></span>**19.** Proinde quae pacis sunt, et
aedificationis mutuae, sectemur.

<span id="xviii.vi-p4"></span>**20.** For meat destroy not the work of
God. All things indeed *are* pure; but *it is* evil for that man who
eateth with offence.

<span id="xviii.vi-p5"></span>**20.** Ne propter cibum destruas opus
Dei. Omnia quidem pura, sed malum est homini qui per offensionem
vescitur.

<span id="xviii.vi-p6"></span>**21.** *It is* good neither to eat flesh,
nor to drink wine, nor *any thing* whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is
offended, or is made weak.

<span id="xviii.vi-p7"></span>**21.** Bonum est non edere carnem, nec
vinum bibere,  <span id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) nec aliud facere
in quo frater tuus concidat, vel offendatur, vel infirmetur.

<span id="xviii.vi-p9"></span><span id="xviii.vi-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.vi-p10"></span>**19.** *Let us then follow, etc.* He
recalls us, as much as possible, from a mere regard to meats, to
consider those greater things which ought to have the first place in all
our actions, and so to have the precedence. We must indeed eat, that we
may live; we ought to live, that we may serve the Lord; and he serves
the Lord, who by benevolence and kindness edifies his neighbor; for in
order to promote these two things, concord and edification, all the
duties of love ought to be exercised. Lest this should be thought of
little moment, he repeats the sentence he had before announced, — that
corruptible meat is not of such consequence that for its sake the Lord’s
building should be destroyed. For wherever there is even a spark of
godliness, there the work of God is to be seen; which they demolish, who
by their unfeeling conduct disturb the conscience of the weak.

<span id="xviii.vi-p11"></span>But it must be noticed, that edification
is joined to peace; because some, not unfrequently, too freely indulge
one another, so that they do much harm by their compliances. Hence in
endeavoring to serve one another, discretion ought to be exercised, and
utility regarded, so that we may willingly grant to our brother whatever
may be useful to further his salvation. So Paul reminds us in another
place: “All things,” he says, “are lawful to me; but all things are not
expedient;” and immediately he adds the reason, “Because all things do
not edify.” (<span id="xviii.vi-p11.1"></span>[1Co
10:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023.md)<span
id="xviii.vi-p11.1"></span>.)

<span id="xviii.vi-p12"></span>Nor is it also in vain that he repeats
again, *For meat destroy not,*  <span id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md)
*etc.*, intimating, that he required no abstinence, by which there would
be, according to what he had said before, any loss to piety: though we
eat not anything we please, but abstain from the use of meats for the
sake of our brethren; yet the kingdom of God continues entire and
complete.

<span id="xviii.vi-p14"></span><span id="xviii.vi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.vi-p15"></span>**20.** *All things are indeed pure,
etc.* By saying, that all things are pure, he makes a general
declaration; and by adding, that it is evil for man to eat with offense,
he makes an exception; as though he had said, — “Meat is indeed good,
but to give offense is bad.” Now meat has been given to us, that we may
eat it, provided love be observed: he then pollutes the use of pure
meat, who by it violates love. Hence he concludes, that it is good to
abstain from all things which tend to give offense to our brethren.

<span id="xviii.vi-p16"></span>He mentions three things in order, *to
fall, to stumble, to be weakened:* the meaning seems to be this, — “Let
no cause of falling, no, nor of stumbling, no, nor of weakening, be
given to the brethren.” For to be weakened is less than to stumble, and
to stumble is less than to fall. He may be said to be weakened whose
conscience wavers with doubt, — to stumble when the *conscience* is
disturbed by some greater perplexity, and to fall when the individual is
in a manner alienated from his attention to religion.  <span
id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md)

<span id="xviii.vii"></span>

<span id="xviii.vii-p1"></span><span id="xviii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Romans
14:22-23](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#022.md)<span
id="xviii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.vii-p2"></span>**22.** Hast thou faith? have *it* to
thyself before God. Happy *is* he that condemneth not himself in that
thing which he alloweth.

<span id="xviii.vii-p3"></span>**22.** Tu fidem habes? apud teipsum habe
coram Deo. Beatus qui non judicat seipsum in eo quod examinat.

<span id="xviii.vii-p4"></span>**23.** And he that doubteth is damned if
he eat, because *he eateth* not of faith: for whatsoever *is* not of
faith is sin.

<span id="xviii.vii-p5"></span>**23.** Qui verb dijudicat si comederit
condemnatus est; quia non ex fide: quicquid vero non est ex fide,
peccatum est.

<span id="xviii.vii-p6"></span><span id="xviii.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.vii-p7"></span>**22.** *Hast thou faith?* In order to
conclude, he shows in what consists the advantage of Christian liberty:
it hence appears, that they boast falsely of liberty who know not how to
make a right use of it. He then says, that liberty really understood, as
it is that of faith, has properly a regard to God; so that he who is
endued with a conviction of this kind, ought to be satisfied with peace
of conscience before God; nor is it needful for him to show before men
that he possesses it. It hence follows, that if we offend our weak
brethren by eating meats, it is through a perverse opinion; for there is
no necessity to constrain us.

<span id="xviii.vii-p8"></span>It is also plainly evident how strangely
perverted is this passage by some, who hence conclude, that it is not
material how devoted any one may be to the observance of foolish and
superstitious ceremonies, provided the conscience remains pure before
God. Paul indeed intended nothing less, as the context clearly shows;
for ceremonies are appointed for the worship of God, and they are also a
part of our confession: they then who tear off faith from confession,
take away from the sun its own heat. But Paul handles nothing of this
kind in this place, but only speaks of our liberty in the use of meat
and drink.

<span id="xviii.vii-p9"></span>*Happy is he who condemns not himself,
etc.* Here he means to teach us, first, how we may lawfully use the
gifts of God; and, secondly, how great an impediment ignorance is; and
he thus teaches us, lest we should urge the uninstructed beyond the
limits of their infirmity. But he lays down a general truth, which
extends to all actions, — “Happy,” he says, “is he who is not conscious
of doing wrong, when he rightly examines his own deeds.” For it happens,
that many commit the worst of crimes without any scruple of conscience;
but this happens, because they rashly abandon themselves, with closed
eyes, to any course to which the blind and violent intemperance of the
flesh may lead them; for there is much difference between insensibility
and a right judgment. He then who examines things is happy, provided he
is not bitten by an accusing conscience, after having honestly
considered and weighed matters; for this assurance alone can render our
works pleasing to God. Thus is removed that vain excuse which many
allege on the ground of ignorance; inasmuch as their error is connected
with insensibility and sloth: for if what they call good intention is
sufficient, their examination, according to which the Spirit of God
estimates the deeds of men, is superfluous.  <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md)

<span id="xviii.vii-p11"></span><span id="xviii.vii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.vii-p12"></span>**23.** *But he who is undecided, etc.*
He very fitly expresses in one word the character of that mind which
vacillates and is uncertain as to what ought to be done; for he who is
undecided undergoes alternate changes, and in the midst of his various
deliberations is held suspended by uncertainty. As then the main thing
in a good work is the persuasion of a mind conscious of being right
before God, and as it were a calm assurance, nothing is more opposed to
the acceptance of our works than vacillation.  <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) And, oh! that this truth were fixed in
the minds of men, that nothing ought to be attempted except what the
mind feels assured is acceptable to God, men would not then make such an
uproar, as they often do now, nor waver, nor blindly hurry onward
wherever their own imagination may lead them. For if our way of living
is to be confined to this moderation, that no one is to touch a morsel
of meat with a doubting conscience, how much greater caution is to be
exercised in the greatest things?

<span id="xviii.vii-p15"></span>*And whatever is not from faith, etc.*
The reason for this condemnation is, that every work, however splendid
and excellent in appearance, is counted as sin, except it be founded on
a right conscience; for God regards not the outward display, but the
inward obedience of the heart, by this alone is an estimate made of our
works. Besides, how can that be obedience, when any one undertakes what
he is not persuaded is approved by God? Where then such a doubt exists,
the individual is justly charged with prevarication; for he proceeds in
opposition to the testimony of his, own conscience.

<span id="xviii.vii-p16"></span>The word *faith* is to be taken here for
a fixed persuasion of the mind, or, so to speak, for a firm assurance,
and not that of any kind, but what is derived from the truth of God.
Hence doubt or uncertainty vitiates all our actions, however specious
they may otherwise be. Now, since a pious mind can never acquiesce with
certainty in anything but the word of God, all fictitious modes of
worship do in this case vanish away, and whatever works there may be
which originate in the brains of men; for while everything which is not
from faith is condemned, rejected is whatever is not supported and
approved by God’s word. It is at the same time by no means sufficient
that what we do is approved by the word of God, except the mind, relying
on this persuasion, prepares itself cheerfully to do its work. Hence the
first thing in a right conduct, in order that our minds may at no time
fluctuate, is this, that we, depending on God’s word, confidently
proceed wherever it may call us.

<span id="xviii.i-p12"></span> Some, as <span
id="xviii.i-p12.1"></span>Haldane, have found fault with this
classification, as there is nothing in the chapter which countenances
it. But as the Apostle’s object throughout the epistle was to reconcile
the Jews and Gentiles, there is reason sufficient to regard them as the
two parties here intended: and, as <span
id="xviii.i-p12.2"></span>Chalmers justly observes, it is more probable
that the Gentiles were the despisers, inasmuch as the Jews, who, like
Paul, had got over their prejudices, were no doubt disposed to
sympathize with their brethren, who were still held fast by them. —

<span id="xviii.i-p15.4"></span>Doddridge; “not in order to the strifes

are in the plural number; therefore to give the first the sense of
“judging,” as <span id="xviii.i-p15.6"></span>Hodge does, cannot be
right; for in that case it would have been in the singular number. The
words may be rendered, “no for the solutions of doubts.” One of the
meanings of the first word, according to <span

according to the frequent import of the preposition εἰς, the sentence

remarks on this verse are striking and appropriate, — “Notwithstanding,”
he says, “the authority vested by Christ in his Apostles, and their
infallibility in delivering his doctrine to mankind, differences of
opinion prevailed even among real Christians; nor did St. Paul, by an
express decision and command, attempt to put a final termination to
them. A proposition indeed may be certain and important truth; yet a man
cannot receive it without due preparation of mind and heart; — so that a
compelled assent to any doctrine, or conformity to any outward
observances, without conviction, would in general be hypocrisy, and
entirely unavailing. So essential are the rights and existence of
private judgment, in all possible cases, to the exercise of true
religion! and so useless an encumbrance would an infallible judge be,
for deciding controversies, and producing unanimity among Christians!”

<span id="fn_415"></span>[416](cc38017.htm#fr_415.md) <span
id="xviii.i-p19.3"></span>

<span id="xviii.i-p20"></span> This is true, but the passage here seems
not to require such a construction. Both sentences are declarative,
announcing a fact respecting two parties: the one believed he might eat
everything; the other did eat only herbs. The relative ὃς, when
repeated, often means “one,” as in <span id="xviii.i-p20.1"></span>[Ro
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#005.md)<span id="xviii.i-p20.1"></span>,
and in <span id="xviii.i-p20.2"></span>[1Co
11:21](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#021.md)<span id="xviii.i-p20.2"></span>:
and the article ὁ stands here for that repetition; an example of which
*Raphelius* adduces from the Greek classics.

<span id="xviii.i-p21"></span>Some think that this abstinence from meat
was not peculiar to the Jews; but that some Gentiles also had scruples
on the subject. It is true that heathens, who held the transmigration of
souls, did not eat flesh: but it is not likely that abstinence, arising
from such an absurd notion, would have been thus treated by the Apostle.
It indeed appears evident, that the abstinence here referred to did
arise from what was regarded to be the will of God: and though
abstinence from all animal food was not enjoined on the Jews, yet it
appears from history that Jews, living among heathens, wholly abstained,
owing to the fear they had of being in any way contaminated. This was
the case with Daniel and his companions, <span
id="xviii.i-p21.1"></span>[Da
1:8-16](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#008.md)<span
id="xviii.i-p21.1"></span>. Professor <span

“Josephus states in his life (chapter 23) that certain Jewish priests,
while at Rome, lived entirely upon fruit, from the dread of eating
anything unclean.” We may also suppose that some of the *Essenes*, who
abstained from meat and from wine, were among the early converts. —

<span id="xviii.i-p24"></span> The last clause is by <span

to this extension of it; and certainly the following verse is in favor
of his view, for the weak, the condemner, is the person reproved, and
therefore the strong is he who to his own master stands or falls. The
condemner throughout is the weak, and the despised is the strong. — *Ed*

<span id="xviii.ii-p12"></span> It has been suggested as a question by

<span id="xviii.iv-p3"></span> It appears from the order of the words σὺ
δέ τί, and ἣ καὶ σὺ τί, that the address was made to two parties. “But
thou, *the weak*, why condemnest thou thy brother? and thou also, *the
strong*, why dost thou despise thy brother?” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_422"></span>[423](cc38017.htm#fr_422.md) <span
id="xviii.iv-p13.2"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p14"></span> The words “We shall all stand,” etc.,
may be rendered, “We must all stand,” etc. It is indeed the future
tense, but this is according to what is often the case in Hebrew, for in
that language the future has frequently this meaning. <span
id="xviii.iv-p14.1"></span>[Ro
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#012.md)<span id="xviii.iv-p14.1"></span>
may be rendered in the same manner, “So then every one of us must give
account of himself to God.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_423"></span>[424](cc38017.htm#fr_423.md) <span
id="xviii.iv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p19"></span> The passage is from <span
id="xviii.iv-p19.2"></span>[Isa
45:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#023.md)<span
id="xviii.iv-p19.2"></span>. In two instances the Apostle gives the
sense, and not the words. Instead of “by myself have I sworn,” he give
the form of the oath, “*As* I live.” This is the manner in which God
swears by himself, it is by his life — his eternal existence. Then the
conclusion of the verse in Hebrew is, “every tongue shall swear,” that
is, “unto me.” To swear to God or by his name is to avow allegiance to
him, to profess or to confess his name. See <span
id="xviii.iv-p19.3"></span>[Ps
63:11](../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#011.md)<span
id="xviii.iv-p19.3"></span>; <span id="xviii.iv-p19.4"></span>[Isa
63:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#001.md)<span id="xviii.iv-p19.4"></span>;
<span id="xviii.iv-p19.5"></span>[Zep
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/zep001.htm#005.md)<span id="xviii.iv-p19.5"></span>.
The Apostle therefore does no more than interpret the Hebrew idiom when
he says, “every tongue shall confess to God.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_424"></span>[425](cc38017.htm#fr_424.md) <span
id="xviii.iv-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.iv-p23"></span> The two words, πρόσκομμα and σκάνδαλον,
mean nearly the same thing, but with this difference, that the first
seems to be an hindrance or an obstacle which occasions stumbling or
falling, and the other is an obstacle which stops or impedes progress in
the way. See <span id="xviii.iv-p23.2"></span>[Mt
16:23](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#023.md)<span
id="xviii.iv-p23.2"></span>. The two parties, the strong and the weak,
are here evidently addressed; the former was not, by eating, to put a
stumblingblock in the way of the weak brother; nor was the weak, by
condemning, to be a hindrance or impediment in the way of the strong so
as to prevent him to advance in his course. Thus we see that forbearance
is enjoined on both parties, though the Apostle afterwards dwells more
on what the strong was to do.

<span id="xviii.iv-p24"></span>The clause might be thus rendered, —

<span id="xviii.iv-p25"></span>“But rather judge it right to do this,
—  
not to lay before a brother a stumbling-stone, or an impediment.” —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_425"></span>[426](cc38017.htm#fr_425.md) <span
id="xviii.v-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.v-p3"></span> “At the very time of giving forth the
sentence, and on the highest of all authority, that there was nothing
unclean of itself, he yet leaves others at liberty to esteem anything
unclean. We are not sure if anywhere else in Scripture, the divine
authority of toleration is so clearly manifested.” — <span
id="xviii.v-p3.1"></span>Chalmers

<span id="fn_426"></span>[427](cc38017.htm#fr_426.md) <span
id="xviii.v-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.v-p16"></span> To elicit this meaning, which is in
itself true, <span id="xviii.v-p16.2"></span>Calvin must have construed
the sentence thus, “I know, and I am persuaded, that through the Lord
Jesus nothing is of itself unclean:” but this is not the meaning. What
the Apostle says is, that he knew, and was fully assured by the Lord
Jesus, that is, by the teaching of his word Spirit, that nothing was in
itself unclean, all ceremonial distinctions having been now removed and
abolished. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_427"></span>[428](cc38017.htm#fr_427.md) <span
id="xviii.v-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.v-p19"></span> From the words “destroy not,” etc., some
have deduced the sentiment, that those for whom Christ died may perish
for ever. It is neither wise nor just to draw a conclusion of this kind;
for it is one that is negatived by many positive declarations of
Scripture. Man’s inference, when contrary to God’s word, cannot be
right. Besides, the Apostle’s object in this passage is clearly this, —
to exhibit the *sin* of those who disregarded without saying that it
actually effected that evil. Some have very unwisely attempted to
obviate the inference above mentioned, by suggesting, that the
destruction meant was that of comfort and edification. But no doubt the
Apostle meant the ruin of the soul; hence the urgency of his
exhortation, — “Do not act in such a way as tends to endanger the safety
of a soul for whom Christ has shed his blood;” or, “Destroy not,” that
is, as far as you can do so. Apostles and ministers are said to “save”
men; some are exhorted here not to “destroy” them. Neither of these
effects can follow, except in the first instance, God grants his
blessing, and in the second his permission; and his permission as to his
people he will never grant, as he has expressly told us. See <span
id="xviii.v-p19.1"></span>[Joh

<span id="xviii.v-p20"></span> “<span id="xviii.v-p20.1"></span>Vestrum

id="xviii.v-p20.3"></span>Hammond, <span
id="xviii.v-p20.4"></span>Scott, <span
id="xviii.v-p20.5"></span>Chalmers, etc., agree with <span
id="xviii.v-p20.6"></span>Calvin, and view this “good,” or privilege, to
be Christian liberty, or freedom from ceremonial observances, (see <span
id="xviii.v-p20.7"></span>[1Co
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#029.md)<span
id="xviii.v-p20.7"></span>;) but <span id="xviii.v-p20.8"></span>Origen,
<span id="xviii.v-p20.9"></span>Ambrose, <span
id="xviii.v-p20.10"></span>Theodoret, <span
id="xviii.v-p20.11"></span>Mede, etc., consider that the gospel is
meant. The first opinion is the most suitable to the passage. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_429"></span>[430](cc38017.htm#fr_429.md) <span
id="xviii.v-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.v-p28"></span> What is here said is no doubt true of the
kingdom of God; but by considering what is afterwards said in the two
following verses, we cannot well accede to this exposition.
Righteousness, peace, and joy, mentioned here, are things acceptable to
God and *approved by men*: they must then be things apparent and
visible, which men see and observe; and to follow “the things of peace,”
refers to the conduct. “Righteousness” then must mean here the doing of
what is right and just towards one another; “peace,” concord and
unanimity, as opposed to discord and contentions; “joy,” the fruit of
this peaceable state, a cheering delight, a mutual rejoicing, instead of
the sorrow and grief occasioned by discord; and these come “through the
Holy Spirit” and are produced by him; and they are not the semblances of
such virtues and graces, presented in some instances by false religions.

<span id="xviii.v-p28.2"></span>Doddridge, <span
id="xviii.v-p28.3"></span>Stuart, and <span
id="xviii.v-p28.4"></span>Chalmers have viewed the passage in this
light, though the latter, as well as <span
id="xviii.v-p28.5"></span>Scott, seemed inclined to combine the two
views: but this is to mix up things together unnecessarily, and to
destroy the harmony of the context. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_430"></span>[431](cc38017.htm#fr_430.md) <span
id="xviii.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.vi-p8"></span> <span id="xviii.vi-p8.1"></span>Jerome
often employed the former part of this verse for the purpose of
encouraging nomasticism; and by thus disconnecting it from the context,
he got a passage quite suitable to his purpose. Even <span
id="xviii.vi-p8.2"></span>Erasmus condemned this shameful perversion. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_431"></span>[432](cc38017.htm#fr_431.md) <span
id="xviii.vi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.vi-p13"></span> This is a similar, but not the same
sentence as in <span id="xviii.vi-p13.1"></span>[Ro
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#015.md)<span
id="xviii.vi-p13.1"></span>. The verb is different, κατάλυε; which means
to undo, to loosen, to pull down; and as “work” follows, which, as <span
id="xviii.vi-p13.2"></span>Calvin and others think, is to be understood
of God’s building, the work of edifying or building up his people, the
verb may in this sense be rendered here, “Pull not down the work of
God.” But here, as in <span id="xviii.vi-p13.3"></span>[Ro
14:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#015.md)<span
id="xviii.vi-p13.3"></span>, it is the *tendency* of the deed that is to
be considered, and the effect as far as man’s doing was concerned. The
Apostle says nothing of what God would do. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_432"></span>[433](cc38017.htm#fr_432.md) <span
id="xviii.vi-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.vi-p17"></span> What is said here proves what is stated
in a note on <span id="xviii.vi-p17.2"></span>[Ro
14:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#013.md)<span
id="xviii.vi-p17.2"></span>; that is, that σκάνδαλον is a less evil than
πρόσκομμα, only that the idea of stumbling, instead of hindrance or
impediment, is given here to the former word. The Apostle still adopts,
as it were, the ascending scale. He first mentions the most obvious
effect, the actual fall, the extreme evil, and then the next to it, the
obstacle in the way; and, in the third place, the weakening of the faith
of the individual. The real order of the process is the reverse, — the
weakening, then the impediment, and, lastly, the stumblingblock which
occasions the fall. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_433"></span>[434](cc38017.htm#fr_433.md) <span
id="xviii.vii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.vii-p10"></span> The version of <span
id="xviii.vii-p10.1"></span>Calvin is, “<span
id="xviii.vii-p10.2"></span>Beatus qui non judicat seipsum in eo quod
examinat,” μακάριος ὅ μὴ κρίνων ἑαυτὸν ἐν ᾦ δοκιμάζει; the latter part
is rendered by <span id="xviii.vii-p10.3"></span>Beza, and <span
id="xviii.vii-p10.4"></span>Piscator, “<span
id="xviii.vii-p10.5"></span>in eo quod approbat — in that which he
approves;” by <span id="xviii.vii-p10.6"></span>Doddridge, “in the thing
which he alloweth;” by <span id="xviii.vii-p10.7"></span>Macknight, “by
what he approveth.” The reference is no doubt to the strong, who had
“faith,” who believed all meats lawful. The verb means to try, to
examine, as well as to approve; but the latter seems to be its meaning
here. To approve and to have faith appears in this case to be the same:
then to have faith and not to abuse it by giving offense to a brother
was to be a happy man, who did not condemn himself. The meaning then
most suitable to the passage is this, “Happy the man! who condemns not
himself by what he approves,” that is, by eating meat to the annoyance
and stumbling of the weak. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_434"></span>[435](cc38017.htm#fr_434.md) <span
id="xviii.vii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xviii.vii-p13"></span> The Greek is ὁ διακρινόμενος, “he who
discerns,” that is, a difference as to meats; so <span
id="xviii.vii-p13.1"></span>Doddridge, <span
id="xviii.vii-p13.2"></span>Macknight, and <span
id="xviii.vii-p13.3"></span>Chalmers regard its meaning. <span
id="xviii.vii-p13.4"></span>Beza has “<span
id="xviii.vii-p13.5"></span>qui dubitat — who doubts,” and so our
version. The word used by <span id="xviii.vii-p13.6"></span>Calvin is
<span id="xviii.vii-p13.7"></span>*dijudicat*, which properly means to
judge between things, to discern, but according to his explanation it
means to judge in two ways, to be undecided.

<span id="xviii.vii-p14"></span>The verb no doubt admits of these two
meanings; it is used evidently in the sense of making or putting a
difference, but only, as some say, in the active voice. There are indeed
two places where it seems to have this meaning in its passive or middle
form, <span id="xviii.vii-p14.1"></span>[Jas
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#004.md)<span id="xviii.vii-p14.1"></span>,
and <span id="xviii.vii-p14.2"></span>[Jude
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/jde001.htm#022.md)<span
id="xviii.vii-p14.2"></span>. But as Paul has before used it in this
Epistle, <span id="xviii.vii-p14.3"></span>[Ro
4:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020.md)<span
id="xviii.vii-p14.3"></span>, in the sense of hesitating, staggering, or
doubting, we may reasonably suppose that it has this meaning here, and
especially as in every place where he expresses the other idea, he has
employed the active form. See <span id="xviii.vii-p14.4"></span>[1Co
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#007.md)<span id="xviii.vii-p14.4"></span>;

etc. — *Ed.*
