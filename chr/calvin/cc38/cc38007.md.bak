<span id="viii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Romans
4:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1.** What shall we say then that Abraham
our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Quid ergo dicemus, invenisse Abraham
patrem nostrum secundw carnem?

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span>**2.** For if Abraham were justified by
works, he hath *whereof* to glory; but not before God.

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span>**2.** Si enim Abraham ex operibus
justificatus est. habet quo glorietur, sed non apud Deum.

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span>**3.** For what saith the scripture? Abraham
believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.  <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md)

<span id="viii.i-p9"></span>**3.** Quid enim Scripture dicit’ Credidit
Abraham Deo, et imputa tum est illi in justitiam.

<span id="viii.i-p10"></span><span id="viii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span>**1.** *What then,* *etc.* This is a
confirmation by example; and it is a very strong one, since all things
are alike with regard to the subject and the person; for he was the
father of the faithful, to whom we ought all to be conformed; and there
is also but one way and not many ways by which righteousness may be
obtained by all. In many other things one example would not be
sufficient to make a common rule; but as in the person of Abraham there
was exhibited a mirror and pattern of righteousness, which belongs in
common to the whole Church, rightly does Paul apply what has been
written of him alone to the whole body of the Church, and at the same
time he gives a check to the Jews, who had nothing more plausible to
glory in than that they were the children of Abraham; and they could not
have dared to claim to themselves more holiness than what they ascribed
to the holy patriarch. Since it is then evident that he was justified
freely, his posterity, who claimed a righteousness of their own by the
law, ought to have been made silent even through shame.

<span id="viii.i-p12"></span>*According to the flesh,* *etc.* Between
this clause and the word *father* there is put in Paul’s text the verb
<span id="viii.i-p12.1"></span>ἑυρηκέναι, in this order — “What shall we
say that Abraham our father has found according to the flesh?” On this
account, some interpreters think that the question is — “What has
Abraham obtained according to the flesh?” If this exposition be
approved, the words *according to the flesh* mean naturally or from
himself. It is, however, probable that they are to be connected with the
word *father.*  <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) Besides, as we
are wont to be more touched by domestic examples, the dignity of their
race, in which the Jews took too much pride, is here again expressly
mentioned. But some regard this as spoken in contempt, as they are
elsewhere called the carnal children of Abraham, being not so
spiritually or in a legitimate sense. But I think that it was expressed
as a thing peculiar to the Jews; for it was a greater honor to be the
children of Abraham by nature and descent, than by mere adoption,
provided there was also faith. He then concedes to the Jews a closer
bond of union, but only for this end — that he might more deeply impress
them that they ought not to depart from the example of their father.

<span id="viii.i-p15"></span><span id="viii.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p16"></span>**2.** *For if Abraham,* *etc.* This is an
incomplete argument,  <span id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) which may
be made in this form — “If Abraham was justified by works, he might
justly glory: but he had nothing for which he could glory before God;
then he was not justified by works.” Thus the clause *but not before
God,* is the minor proposition; and to this must be added the conclusion
which I have stated, though it is not expressed by Paul. He calls that
glorying when we pretend to have anything of our own to which a reward
is supposed to be due at God’s tribunal. Since he takes this away from
Abraham, who of us can claim for himself the least particle of merit?

<span id="viii.i-p19"></span><span id="viii.i-p19.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p20"></span>**3.** *For what saith the Scripture?* This
is a proof of the minor proposition, or of what he assumed, when he
denied that Abraham had any ground for glorying: for if Abraham was
justified, because he embraced, by faith, the bountiful mercy of God, it
follows, that he had nothing to glory in; for he brought nothing of his
own, except a confession of his misery, which is a solicitation for
mercy. He, indeed, takes it as granted, that the righteousness of faith
is the refuge, and, as it were, the asylum of the sinner, who is
destitute of works. For if there be any righteousness by the law or by
works, it must be in men themselves; but by faith they derive from
another what is wanting in themselves; and hence the righteousness of
faith is rightly called imputative.

<span id="viii.i-p21"></span>The passage, which is quoted, is taken from
<span id="viii.i-p21.1"></span>[Ge
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.i-p21.1"></span>;
in which the word *believe* is not to be confined to any particular
expression, but it refers to the whole covenant of salvation, and the
grace of adoption, which Abraham apprehended by faith. There is, indeed,
mentioned there the promise of a future seed; but it was grounded on
gratuitous adoption:  <span id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md) and it
ought to be observed, that salvation without the grace of God is not
promised, nor God’s grace without salvation; and again, that we are not
called to the grace of God nor to the hope of salvation, without having
righteousness offered to us.

<span id="viii.i-p23"></span>Taking this view, we cannot but see that
those understand not the principles of theology, who think that this
testimony recorded by Moses, is drawn aside from its obvious meaning by
Paul: for as there is a particular promise there stated, they understand
that he acted rightly and faithfully in believing it, and was so far
approved by God. But they are in this mistaken; first, because they have
not considered that *believing* extends to the whole context, and ought
not to be confined to one clause. But the principal mistake is, that
they begin not with the testimony of God’s favor. But God gave this, to
make Abraham more assured of his adoption and paternal favor; and
included in this was eternal salvation by Christ. Hence Abraham, by
believing, embraced nothing but the favor offered to him, being
persuaded that it would not be void. Since this was imputed to him for
righteousness, it follows, that he was not otherwise just, than as one
trusting in God’s goodness, and venturing to hope for all things from
him. Moses does not, indeed, tell us what men thought of him, but how he
was accounted before the tribunal of God. Abraham then laid hold on the
benignity of God offered to him in the promise, through which he
understood that righteousness was communicated to him. It is necessary,
in order to form an opinion of righteousness, to understand this
relation between the promise and faith; for there is in this respect the
same connection between God and us, as there is, according to the
lawyers, between the giver and the person to whom any thing is given,
(<span id="viii.i-p23.1"></span>*datorem et donatarium* — the donor and
the donee:) for we can no otherwise attain righteousness, than as it is
brought to us, as it were, by the promise of the gospel; and we realize
its possession by faith.  <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md)

<span id="viii.i-p27"></span>How to reconcile what James says, which
seems somewhat contrary to this view I have already explained, and
intend to explain more fully, when I come, if the Lord will permit, to
expound that Epistle.

<span id="viii.i-p28"></span>Only let us remember this, — that those to
whom righteousness is imputed, are justified; since these two things are
mentioned by Paul as being the same. We hence conclude that the question
is not, what men are in themselves, but how God regards them; not that
purity of conscience and integrity of life are to be separated from the
gratuitous favor of God; but that when the reason is asked, why God
loves us and owns us as just, it is necessary that Christ should come
forth as one who clothes us with his own righteousness.

<span id="viii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Romans
4:4-5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#004.md)<span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>**4.** Now to him that worketh is the
reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.

<span id="viii.ii-p3"></span>**4.** Ei quidem qui operatur merces non
imputatur secundum gratiam, sed secundum debitum:

<span id="viii.ii-p4"></span>**5.** But to him that worketh not, but
believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
righteousness.

<span id="viii.ii-p5"></span>**5.** Ei vero qui non operatur, credit
autem in eum qui justificat impium, imputatur fides sua in justitiam.

<span id="viii.ii-p6"></span><span id="viii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p7"></span>**4.** *To him indeed who works,* *etc.* It
is not he, whom he calls a worker, who is given to good works, to which
all the children of God ought to attend, but the person who seeks to
merit something by his works: and in a similar way he calls him no
worker who depends not on the merit of what he does. He would not,
indeed, have the faithful to be idle; but he only forbids them to be
mercenaries, so as to demand any thing from God, as though it were
justly their due.

<span id="viii.ii-p8"></span>We have before reminded you, that the
question is not here how we are to regulate our life, but how we are to
be saved: and he argues from what is contrary, — that God confers not
righteousness on us because it is due, but bestows it as a gift. And
indeed I agree with *Bucer,* who proves that the argument is not made to
depend on one expression, but on the whole passage, and formed in this
manner, “If one merits any thing by his work, what is merited is not
freely imputed to him, but rendered to him as his due. Faith is counted
for righteousness, not that it procures any merit for us, but because it
lays hold on the goodness of God: hence righteousness is not due to us,
but freely bestowed.” For as Christ of his own good-will justifies us
through faith, Paul always regards this as an evidence of our emptiness;
for what do we believe, except that Christ is an expiation to reconcile
us to God? The same truth is found in other words in <span
id="viii.ii-p8.1"></span>[Ga 3:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#011.md)<span
id="viii.ii-p8.1"></span>, where it is said, “That no man is justified
by the law, it is evident, for the just shall by faith live: but the law
is not by faith; but he who doeth these things shall live in them.”
Inasmuch, then, as the law promises reward to works, he hence concludes,
that the righteousness of faith, which is free, accords not with that
which is operative: this could not be were faith to justify by means of
works. — We ought carefully to observe these comparisons, by which every
merit is entirely done away.

<span id="viii.ii-p9"></span><span id="viii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p10"></span>**5***. But believes on him,* *etc.* This
is a very important sentence, in which he expresses the substance and
nature both of faith and of righteousness. He indeed clearly shews that
faith brings us righteousness, not because it is a meritorious act, but
because it obtains for us the favor of God.  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) Nor does he declare only that God is
the giver of righteousness, but he also arraigns us of unrighteousness,
in order that the bounty of God may come to aid our necessity: in short,
no one will seek the righteousness of faith except he who feels that he
is ungodly; for this sentence is to be applied to what is said in this
passage, — that faith adorns us with the righteousness of another, which
it seeks as a gift from God. And here again, God is said to justify us
when he freely forgives sinners, and favors those, with whom he might
justly be angry, with his love, that is, when his mercy obliterates our
unrighteousness.

<span id="viii.iii"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p1"></span><span id="viii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Romans
4:6-8](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p2"></span>**6.** Even as David also describeth the
blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without
works,

<span id="viii.iii-p3"></span>**6.** Quemadmodum etiam David finit
beatudinem hominis cui Deus imputat justitiam absque operibus,

<span id="viii.iii-p4"></span>**7.** *Saying,* Blessed *are* they whose
iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.

<span id="viii.iii-p5"></span>**7.** Beati quorum remissæ sunt
iniquitates, et quorum tecta sunt peccata:

<span id="viii.iii-p6"></span>**8.** Blessed *is* the man to whom the
Lord will not impute sin.

<span id="viii.iii-p7"></span>**8.** Beatus vir, cui non imputavit
Dominus peccatum.

<span id="viii.iii-p8"></span><span id="viii.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p9"></span>**6.** *As David also defines,* *etc.* We
hence see the sheer sophistry of those who limit the works of the law to
ceremonies; for he now simply calls those works, without anything added,
which he had before called the works of the law. Since no one can deny
that a simple and unrestricted mode of speaking, such as we find here,
ought to be understood of every work without any difference, the same
view must be held throughout the whole argument. There is indeed nothing
less reasonable than to remove from ceremonies only the power of
justifying, since Paul excludes all works indefinitely. To the same
purpose is the negative clause, — that God justifies men by *not*
imputing sin: and by these words we are taught that righteousness,
according to Paul, is nothing else than the remission of sins; and
further, that this remission is gratuitous, because it is imputed
without works, which the very name of remission indicates; for the
creditor who is paid does not remit, but he who spontaneously cancels
the debt through mere kindness. Away, then, with those who teach us to
redeem pardon for our sins by satisfactions; for Paul borrows an
argument from this pardon to prove the gratuitous gift of righteousness.
 <span id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) How then is it possible for
them to agree with Paul? They say, “We must satisfy by works the justice
of God, that we may obtain the pardon of our sins:” but he, on the
contrary, reasons thus, — “The righteousness of faith is gratuitous, and
without works, because it depends on the remission of sins.” Vicious, no
doubt, would be this reasoning, if any works interposed in the remission
of sins.

<span id="viii.iii-p13"></span>Dissipated also, in like manner, by the
words of the Prophet, are the puerile fancies of the schoolmen
respecting half remission. Their childish fiction is, — that though the
fault is remitted, the punishment is still retained by God. But the
Prophet not only declares that our sins are covered, that is, removed
from the presence of God; but also adds, that they are not imputed. How
can it be consistent, that God should punish those sins which he does
not impute? Safe then does this most glorious declaration remain to us —
“That he is justified by faith, who is cleared before God by a
gratuitous remission of his sins.” We may also hence learn, the
unceasing perpetuity of gratuitous righteousness through life: for when
David, being wearied with the continual anguish of his own conscience,
gave utterance to this declaration, he no doubt spoke according to his
own experience; and he had now served God for many years. He then had
found by experience, after having made great advances, that all are
miserable when summoned before God’s tribunal; and he made this avowal,
that there is no other way of obtaining blessedness, except the Lord
receives us into favor by not imputing our sins. Thus fully refuted also
is the romance of those who dream, that the righteousness of faith is
but initial, and that the faithful afterwards retain by works the
possession of that righteousness which they had first attained by no
merits.

<span id="viii.iii-p14"></span>It invalidates in no degree what Paul
says, that works are sometimes imputed for righteousness, and that other
kinds of blessedness are mentioned. It is said in <span
id="viii.iii-p14.1"></span>[Ps
106:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#030.md)<span
id="viii.iii-p14.1"></span>, that it was imputed to Phinehas, the Lord’s
priest, for righteousness, because he took away reproach from Israel by
inflicting punishment on an adulterer and a harlot. It is true, we learn
from this passage, that he did a righteous deed; but we know that a
person is not justified by one act. What is indeed required is perfect
obedience, and complete in all its parts, according to the import of the
promise, —

<span id="viii.iii-p15"></span>“He who shall do these things shall live
in them.”  
(<span id="viii.iii-p15.2"></span>[De
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#001)<span id="viii.iii-p15.2"></span>..md)

<span id="viii.iii-p16"></span>How then was this judgment which he
inflicted imputed to him for righteousness? He must no doubt have been
previously justified by the grace of God: for they who are already
clothed in the righteousness of Christ, have God not only propitious to
them, but also to their works, the spots and blemishes of which are
covered by the purity of Christ, lest they should come to judgment. As
works, infected with no defilements, are alone counted just, it is quite
evident that no human work whatever can please God, except through a
favor of this kind. But if the righteousness of faith is the only reason
why our works are counted just, you see how absurd is the argument, —
“That as righteousness is ascribed to works, righteousness is not by
faith only.” But I set against them this invincible argument, that all
works are to be condemned as those of unrighteousness, except a man be
justified solely by faith.

<span id="viii.iii-p17"></span>The like is said of blessedness: they are
pronounced blessed who fear the Lord, who walk in his ways, (<span
id="viii.iii-p17.1"></span>[Ps
128:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa128.htm#001.md)<span
id="viii.iii-p17.1"></span>,) who meditate on his law day and night,
(<span id="viii.iii-p17.2"></span>[Ps
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa001.htm#002)<span id="viii.iii-p17.2"></span>:.md)
but as no one doeth these things so perfectly as he ought, so as fully
to come up to God’s command, all blessedness of this kind is nothing
worth, until we be made blessed by being purified and cleansed through
the remission of sins, and thus cleansed, that we may become capable of
enjoying that blessedness which the Lord promises to his servants for
attention to the law and to good works. Hence the righteousness of works
is the effect of the righteousness of God, and the blessedness arising
from works is the effect of the blessedness which proceeds from the
remission of sins. Since the cause ought not and cannot be destroyed by
its own effect, absurdly do they act, who strive to subvert the
righteousness of faith by works.

<span id="viii.iii-p18"></span>But some one may say, “Why may we not
maintain, on the ground of these testimonies, that man is justified and
made blessed by works? for the words of Scripture declare that man is
justified and made blessed by works as well as by faith.” Here indeed we
must consider the order of causes as well as the dispensation of God’s
grace: for inasmuch as whatever is declared, either of the righteousness
of works or of the blessedness arising from them, does not exist, until
this only true righteousness of faith has preceded, and does alone
discharge all its offices, this last must be built up and established,
in order that the other may, as a fruit from a tree, grow from it and
flourish.

<span id="viii.iv"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p1"></span><span id="viii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Romans
4:9-10](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#009.md)<span id="viii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p2"></span>**9.** *Cometh* this blessedness then upon
the circumcision *only,*  <span id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) or
upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to
Abraham for righteousness.

<span id="viii.iv-p6"></span>**9.** Beatudo ergo ista in circumcisionem
modo, an et in præputium competit? Dicimus enim quod imputata fuit
Abrahæ fides in justitiam.

<span id="viii.iv-p7"></span>**10.** How was it then reckoned? when he
was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in
uncircumcision.

<span id="viii.iv-p8"></span>**10.** Quomodo igitur imputata fuit? In
Circumcisione quum esset, an in præputio? Non in circumcisione, sed in
præputio.

<span id="viii.iv-p9"></span><span id="viii.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p10"></span>**9-10.** As circumcision and
uncircumcision are alone mentioned, some unwisely conclude, that the
only question is, that righteousness is not attained by the ceremonies
of the law. But we ought to consider what sort of men were those with
whom Paul was reasoning; for we know that hypocrites, whilst they
generally boast of meritorious works, do yet disguise themselves in
outward masks. The Jews also had a peculiar way of their own, by which
they departed, through a gross abuse of the law, from true and genuine
righteousness. Paul had said, that no one is blessed but he whom God
reconciles to himself by a gratuitous pardon; it hence follows, that all
are accursed, whose works come to judgment. Now then this principle is
to be held, that men are justified, not by their own worthiness, but by
the mercy of God. But still, this is not enough, except remission of
sins precedes all works, and of these the first was circumcision, which
initiated the Jewish people into the service of God. He therefore
proceeds to demonstrate this also.

<span id="viii.iv-p11"></span>We must ever bear in mind, that
circumcision is here mentioned as the initial work, so to speak, of the
righteousness of the law: for the Jews gloried not in it as the symbol
of God’s favor, but as a meritorious observance of the law: and on this
account it was that they regarded themselves better than others, as
though they possessed a higher excellency before God. We now see that
the dispute is not about one rite, but that under one thing is included
every work of the law; that is, every work to which reward can be due.
Circumcision then was especially mentioned, because it was the basis of
the righteousness of the law.

<span id="viii.iv-p12"></span>But Paul maintains the contrary, and thus
reasons: “If Abraham’s righteousness was the remission of sins, (which
he safely takes as granted,) and if Abraham attained this before
circumcision, it then follows that remission of sins is not given for
preceding merits.” You see that the argument rests on the order of
causes and effects; for the cause is always before its effect; and
righteousness was possessed by Abraham before he had circumcision.

<span id="viii.v"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p1"></span><span id="viii.v-p1.1"></span>[Romans
4:11-12](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#011.md)<span id="viii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p2"></span>**11.** And he received the sign of
circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which *he had
yet* being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that
believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be
imputed unto them also:

<span id="viii.v-p3"></span>**11.** Et signum accepit circumcisionis,
sigillum justitiæ fidei quæ fuerat in præputio; ut esset pater omnium
credentium per præputium, quo ipsis quoque imputetur justitia;

<span id="viii.v-p4"></span>**12.** And the father of circumcision to
them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the
steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which *he had* being *yet*
uncircumcised.

<span id="viii.v-p5"></span>**12.** Et pater circumcisionis, non iis qui
sunt ex circumcisione tantum, sed qui insistunt vestigiis fidei, quæ
fuit in præputio patris nostri Abrahæ.

<span id="viii.v-p6"></span><span id="viii.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p7"></span>**11.** *And he received the sign, etc.* In
order to anticipate an objection, he shows that circumcision was not
unprofitable and superfluous, though it could not justify; but it had
another very remarkable use, it had the office of sealing, and as it
were of ratifying the righteousness of faith. And yet he intimates at
the same time, by stating what its object was, that it was not the cause
of righteousness, it indeed tended to confirm the righteousness of
faith, and that already obtained in uncircumcision. He then derogates or
takes away nothing from it.

<span id="viii.v-p8"></span>We have indeed here a remarkable passage
with regard to the general benefits of sacraments. According to the
testimony of Paul, they are seals by which the promises of God are in a
manner imprinted on our hearts, (<span id="viii.v-p8.1"></span>*Dei
promissiones cordibus nostris quodammodo imprimuntur*,) and the
certainty of grace confirmed (<span id="viii.v-p8.2"></span>*sancitur
gratœ certitudo* ) And though by themselves they profit nothing, yet God
has designed them to be the instruments (<span
id="viii.v-p8.3"></span>*instrumenta*) of his grace; and he effects by
the secret grace of his Spirit, that they should not be without benefit
in the elect. And though they are dead and unprofitable symbols to the
reprobate, they yet ever retain their import and character (<span
id="viii.v-p8.4"></span>*vim suam et naturam:*) for though our unbelief
may deprive them of their effect, yet it cannot weaken or extinguish the
truth of God. Hence it remains a fixed principle, that sacred symbols
are testimonies, by which God seals his grace on our hearts.

<span id="viii.v-p9"></span>As to the symbol of circumcision, this
especially is to be said, that a twofold grace was represented by it.
God had promised to Abraham a blessed seed, from whom salvation was to
be expected by the whole world. On this depended the promise — “I will
be to thee a God.” (<span id="viii.v-p9.1"></span>[Ge
17:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007)<span id="viii.v-p9.1"></span>..md)
Then a gratuitous reconciliation with God was included in that symbol:
and for this reason it was necessary that the faithful should look
forward to the promised seed. On the other hand, God requires integrity
and holiness of life; he indicated by the symbol how this could be
attained, that is, by cutting off in man whatever is born of the flesh,
for his whole nature had become vicious. He therefore reminded Abraham
by the external sign, that he was spiritually to cut off the corruption
of the flesh; and to this Moses has also alluded in <span
id="viii.v-p9.2"></span>[De 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#016.md)<span
id="viii.v-p9.2"></span>. And to show that it was not the work of man,
but of God, he commanded tender infants to be circumcised, who, on
account of their age, could not have performed such a command. Moses has
indeed expressly mentioned spiritual circumcision as the work of divine
power, as you will find in <span id="viii.v-p9.3"></span>[De
30:6](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.v-p9.3"></span>,
where he says, “The Lord will circumcise thine heart:” and the Prophets
afterwards declared the same thing much more clearly.

<span id="viii.v-p10"></span>As there are two points in baptism now, so
there were formerly in circumcision; for it was a symbol of a new life,
and also of the remission of sins. But the fact as to Abraham himself,
that righteousness preceded circumcision, is not always the case in
sacraments, as it is evident from the case of Isaac and his posterity:
but God intended to give such an instance once at the beginning, that no
one might ascribe salvation to external signs.  <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md)

<span id="viii.v-p12"></span>*That he might be the father,* *etc.* Mark
how the circumcision of Abraham confirms our faith with regard to
gratuitous righteousness; for it was the sealing of the righteousness of
faith, that righteousness might also be imputed to us who believe. And
thus Paul, by a remarkable dexterity makes to recoil on his opponents
what they might have adduced as an objection: for since the truth and
import (<span id="viii.v-p12.1"></span>*veritas et vis*) of circumcision
were found in an uncircumcised state, there was no ground for the Jews
to elevate themselves so much above the Gentiles.

<span id="viii.v-p13"></span>But as a doubt might arise, whether it
behoves us, after the example of Abraham, to confirm also the same
righteousness by the sign of circumcision, how came the Apostle to make
this omission? Even because he thought that the question was
sufficiently settled by the drift of his argument: for as this truth had
been admitted, that circumcision availed only to seal the grace of God,
it follows, that it is now of no benefit to us, who have a sign
instituted in its place by our Lord. As then there is no necessity now
for circumcision, where baptism is, he was not disposed to contend
unnecessarily for that respecting which there was no doubt, that is, why
the righteousness of faith was not sealed to the Gentiles in the same
way as it was to Abraham. *To believe in uncircumcision* means, that the
Gentiles, being satisfied with their own condition, did not introduce
the seal of circumcision: and so the proposition <span
id="viii.v-p13.1"></span>δια, *by* is put for <span
id="viii.v-p13.2"></span>εν, *in*  <span
id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md)

<span id="viii.v-p15"></span><span id="viii.v-p15.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p16"></span>**12.** *To them who are not, etc.* The
verb, *are*, is in this place to be taken for, “are deemed to be:” for
he touches the carnal descendants of Abraham, who, having nothing but
outward circumcision, confidently gloried in it. The other thing, which
was the chief matter, they neglected; for the faith of Abraham, by which
alone he obtained salvation, they did not imitate. It hence appears, how
carefully he distinguished between faith and the sacrament; not only
that no one might be satisfied with the one without the other, as though
it were sufficient for justifying; but also that faith alone might be
set forth as accomplishing everything: for while he allows the
circumcised Jews to be justified, he expressly makes this exception —
provided in true faith they followed the example of Abraham; for why
does he mention faith while in uncircumcision, except to show, that it
is alone sufficient, without the aid of anything else? Let us then
beware, lest any of us, by halving things, blend together the two modes
of justification.

<span id="viii.v-p17"></span>What we have stated disproves also the
scholastic dogma respecting the difference between the sacraments of the
Old and those of the New Testament; for they deny the power of
justifying to the former, and assign it to the latter. But if Paul
reasons correctly, when he argues that circumcision does not justify,
because Abraham was justified by faith, the same reason holds good for
us, while we deny that men are justified by baptism, inasmuch as they
are justified by the same faith with that of Abraham.

<span id="viii.vi"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Romans
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013.md)<span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p2"></span>**13.** For the promise, that he should be
the heir of the world, *was* not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the
law, but through the righteousness of faith.

<span id="viii.vi-p3"></span>**13.** Non enim per Legem promissio Abrahæ
et semini ejus data est, ut esset hæres mundi; sed per justitiam fidei.

<span id="viii.vi-p4"></span><span id="viii.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p5"></span>**13.** *For the promise,* *etc.* He now
more clearly sets the law and faith in opposition, the one to the other,
which he had before in some measure done; and this ought to be carefully
observed: for if faith borrows nothing from the law in order to justify,
we hence understand, that it has respect to nothing else but to the
mercy of God. And further, the romance of those who would have this to
have been said of ceremonies, may be easily disproved; for if works
contributed anything towards justification, it ought not to have been
said, through the written law, but rather, through the law of nature.
But Paul does not oppose spiritual holiness of life to ceremonies, but
faith and its righteousness. The meaning then is, that heirship was
promised to Abraham, not because he deserved it by keeping the law, but
because he had obtained righteousness by faith. And doubtless (as Paul
will presently show) consciences can then only enjoy solid peace, when
they know that what is not justly due is freely given them.  <span
id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md)

<span id="viii.vi-p8"></span>Hence also it follows, that this benefit,
the reason for which applies equally to both, belongs to the Gentiles no
less than to the Jews; for if the salvation of men is based on the
goodness of God alone, they check and hinder its course, as much as they
can, who exclude from it the Gentiles.

<span id="viii.vi-p9"></span>*That he should be the heir of the world,*
 <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) *etc.* Since he now speaks of
eternal salvation, the Apostle seems to have somewhat unseasonably led
his readers to the world; but he includes generally under this word
*world,* the restoration which was expected through Christ. The chief
thing was indeed the restoration of life; it was yet necessary that the
fallen state of the whole world should be repaired. The Apostle, in
<span id="viii.vi-p12.2"></span>[Heb
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md)<span id="viii.vi-p12.2"></span>,
calls Christ the heir of all the good things of God; for the adoption
which we obtain through his favor restores to us the possession of the
inheritance which we lost in Adam; and as under the type of the land of
Canaan, not only the hope of a heavenly life was exhibited to Abraham,
but also the full and complete blessing of God, the Apostle rightly
teaches us, that the dominion of the world was promised to him. Some
taste of this the godly have in the present life; for how much soever
they may at times be oppressed with want, yet as they partake with a
peaceable conscience of those things which God has created for their
use, and as they enjoy through his mercy and good-will his earthly
benefits no otherwise than as pledges and earnests of eternal life,
their poverty does in no degree prevent them from acknowledging heaven,
and the earth, and the sea, as their own possessions.

<span id="viii.vi-p13"></span>Though the ungodly swallow up the riches
of the world, they can yet call nothing as their own; but they rather
snatch them as it were by stealth; for they possess them under the curse
of God. It is indeed a great comfort to the godly in their poverty, that
though they fare slenderly, they yet steal nothing of what belongs to
another, but receive their lawful allowance from the hand of their
celestial Father, until they enter on the full possession of their
inheritance, when all creatures shall be made subservient to their
glory; for both heaven and earth shall be renewed for this end, — that
according to their measure they may contribute to render glorious the
kingdom of God.

4:14-15](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014.md)<span
id="viii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p2"></span>**14.** For if they which are of the law
*be* heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:

<span id="viii.vii-p3"></span>**14.** Si enim ii qui sunt ex Lege
hæredes sunt, exinanita est fides et abolita est promissio:

<span id="viii.vii-p4"></span>**15.** Because the law worketh wrath: for
where no law is, *there is* no transgression.

<span id="viii.vii-p5"></span>**15.** Nam Lex iram efficit; siquidem ubi
non est Lex, neque etiam transgressio.

<span id="viii.vii-p6"></span><span id="viii.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p7"></span>**14.** *For if they who are of the law,*
*etc.* He takes his argument from what is impossible or absurd, that the
favor which Abraham obtained from God, was not promised to him through
any legal agreement, or through any regard to works; for if this
condition had been interposed — that God would favor those only with
adoption who deserved, or who performed the law, no one could have dared
to feel confident that it belonged to him: for who is there so conscious
of so much perfection that he can feel assured that the inheritance is
due to him through the righteousness of the law? Void then would faith
be made; for an impossible condition would not only hold the minds of
men in suspense and anxiety, but fill them also with fear and trembling:
and thus the fulfillment of the promises would be rendered void; for
they avail nothing but when received by faith. If our adversaries had
ears to hear this one reason, the contest between us might easily be
settled.

<span id="viii.vii-p8"></span>The Apostle assumes it as a thing
indubitable, that the promises would by no means be effectual except
they were received with full assurance of mind. But what would be the
case if the salvation of men was based on the keeping of the law?
consciences would have no certainty, but would be harassed with
perpetual inquietude, and at length sink in despair; and the promise
itself, the fulfillment of which depended on what is impossible, would
also vanish away without producing any fruit. Away then with those who
teach the common people to seek salvation for themselves by works,
seeing that Paul declares expressly, that the promise is abolished if we
depend on works. But it is especially necessary that this should be
known, — that when there is a reliance on works, faith is reduced to
nothing. And hence we also learn what faith is, and what sort of
righteousness ought that of works to be, in which men may safely trust.

<span id="viii.vii-p9"></span>The Apostle teaches us, that faith
perishes, except the soul rests on the goodness of God. Faith then is
not a naked knowledge either of God or of his truth; nor is it a simple
persuasion that God is, that his word is the truth; but a sure knowledge
of God’s mercy, which is received from the gospel, and brings peace of
conscience with regard to God, and rest to the mind. The sum of the
matter then is this, — that if salvation depends on the keeping of the
law, the soul can entertain no confidence respecting it, yea, that all
the promises offered to us by God will become void: we must thus become
wretched and lost, if we are sent back to works to find out the cause or
the certainty of salvation.

<span id="viii.vii-p10"></span><span id="viii.vii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p11"></span>**15.** *For the law causeth wrath,*
*etc.* This is a confirmation of the last verse, derived from the
contrary effect of the law; for as the law generates nothing but
vengeance, it cannot bring grace. It can indeed show to the good and the
perfect the way of life: but as it prescribes to the sinful and corrupt
what they ought to do, and supplies them with no power for doing, it
exhibits them as guilty before the tribunal of God. For such is the
viciousness of our nature, that the more we are taught what is right and
just, the more openly is our iniquity discovered, and especially our
contumacy, and thus a heavier judgment is incurred.

<span id="viii.vii-p12"></span>By *wrath*, understand God’s judgment,
which meaning it has everywhere. They who explain it of the wrath of the
sinner, excited by the law, inasmuch as he hates and execrates the
Lawgiver, whom he finds to be opposed to his lusts, say what is
ingenious, but not suitable to this passage; for Paul meant no other
thing, than that condemnation only is what is brought on us all by the
law, as it is evident from the common use of the expression, and also
from the reason which he immediately adds.

<span id="viii.vii-p13"></span>*Where there is no law*, *etc.* This is
the proof, by which he confirms what he had said; for it would have been
difficult to see how God’s *wrath* is kindled against us through the
law, unless it had been made more apparent. And the reason is, that as
the knowledge of God’s justice is discovered by the law, the less excuse
we have, and hence the more grievously we offend against God; for they
who despise the known will of God, justly deserve to sustain a heavier
punishment, than those who offend through ignorance.

<span id="viii.vii-p14"></span>But the Apostle speaks not of the mere
transgression of what is right, from which no man is exempt; but he
calls that a transgression, when man, having been taught what pleases
and displeases God, knowingly and willfully passes over the boundaries
fixed by God’s word; or, in other words, transgression here is not a
mere act of sin, but a willful determination to violate what is right.
 <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) The particle, <span
id="viii.vii-p16.6"></span>οὖ, *where,* which I take as an adverb, some
consider to be a relative, *of which;* but the former reading is the
most suitable, and the most commonly received. Whichever reading you may
follow, the meaning will be the same, — that he who is not instructed by
the written law, when he sins, is not guilty of so great a
transgression, as he is who knowingly breaks and transgresses the law of
God.

<span id="viii.viii-p2"></span>**16.** Therefore *it* *is* of faith,
that *it might be* by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all
the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which
is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,

<span id="viii.viii-p3"></span>**16.** Propterea ex fide, ut secundum
gratiam, quo firma sit promissio universo semini non ei quod est ex Lege
solum, sed quod est ex fide Abrahæ, qui est pater omnium nostrum,

<span id="viii.viii-p4"></span>**17.** (As it is written, I have made
thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, *even* God,
who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though
they were.

<span id="viii.viii-p5"></span>**17.** (sicut scriptum est. Quod patrem
multarum gentium posui te,) coram Deo, cui credidit, qua vivificat
mortuos et vocat ea quæ non sunt tanquam sint.

<span id="viii.viii-p6"></span><span id="viii.viii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p7"></span>**16.** *It is therefore of faith,*
*etc.* This is the winding up of the argument; and you may summarily
include the whole of it in this statement, — “If the heirship of
salvation comes to us by works, then faith in it vanishes, the promise
of it is abolished; but it is necessary that both these should be sure
and certain; hence it comes to us by faith, so that its stability being
based on the goodness of God alone, may be secured.” See how the
Apostle, regarding faith as a thing firm and certain, considers
hesitancy and doubt as unbelief, by which faith is abolished, and the
promise abrogated. And yet this doubting is what the schoolmen call a
moral conjecture, and which, alas! they substitute for faith.

<span id="viii.viii-p8"></span>*That it might be by grace*, *etc.* Here,
in the first place, the Apostle shows, that nothing is set before faith
but mere grace; and this, as they commonly say, is its object: for were
it to look on merits, absurdly would Paul infer, that whatever it
obtains for us is gratuitous. I will repeat this again in other words, —
“If grace be everything that we obtain by faith, then every regard for
works is laid in the dust.” But what next follows more fully removes all
ambiguity, — that the promise then only stands firm, when it recumbs on
grace: for by this expression Paul confirms this truth, that as long as
men depend on works, they are harassed with doubts; for they deprive
themselves of what the promises contain. Hence, also, we may easily
learn, that grace is not to be taken, as some imagine, for the gift of
regeneration, but for a gratuitous favor: for as regeneration is never
perfect, it can never suffice to pacify souls, nor of itself can it make
the promise certain.

<span id="viii.viii-p9"></span>*Not to that only which is of the law,*
*etc.* Though these words mean in another place those who, being absurd
zealots of the law, bind themselves to its yoke, and boast of their
confidence in it, yet here they mean simply the Jewish nation, to whom
the law of the Lord had been delivered. For Paul teaches us in another
passage, that all who remain bound to the dominion of the law, are
subject to a curse; it is then certain that they are excluded from the
participation of grace. He does not then call them the servants of the
law, who, adhering to the righteousness of works, renounce Christ; but
they were those Jews who had been brought up in the law, and yet
professed the name of Christ. But that the sentence may be made clearer,
let it be worded thus, — “Not to those only who are of the law, but to
all who imitate the faith of Abraham, though they had not the law
before.”

<span id="viii.viii-p10"></span>*Who is the father of us all,* *etc.*
The relative has the meaning of a causative particle; for he meant to
prove, that the Gentiles were become partakers of this grace, inasmuch
as by the same oracle, by which the heirship was conferred on Abraham
and his seed, were the Gentiles also constituted his seed: for he is
said to have been made the father, not of one nation, but of many
nations; by which was presignified the future extension of grace, then
confined to Israel alone. For except the promised blessing had been
extended to them, they could not have been counted as the offspring of
Abraham. The past tense of the verb, according to the common usage of
Scripture, denotes the certainty of the Divine counsel; for though
nothing then was less apparent, yet as God had thus decreed, he is
rightly said to have been made the father of many nations. Let the
testimony of Moses be included in a parenthesis, that this clause, “Who
is the father of us all,” may be connected with the other, “before God,”
etc.: for it was necessary to explain also what that relationship was,
that the Jews might not glory too much in their carnal descent. Hence he
says, “He is our *father before* *God;*” which means the same as though
he had said, “He is our spiritual father;” for he had this privilege,
not from his own flesh, but from the promise of God  <span
id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md)

<span id="viii.viii-p13"></span><span id="viii.viii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p14"></span>**17.** *Whom he believed, who quickens
the dead*, *etc.* In this circuitous form is expressed the very
substance of Abraham’s faith, that by his example an opening might be
made for the Gentiles. He had indeed to attain, in a wonderful way, the
promise which he had heard from the Lord’s mouth, since there was then
no token of it. A seed was promised to him as though he was in vigor and
strength; but he was as it were dead. It was hence necessary for him to
raise up his thoughts to the power of God, by which the dead are
quickened. It was therefore not strange that the Gentiles, who were
barren and dead, should be introduced into the same society. He then who
denies them to be capable of grace, does wrong to Abraham, whose faith
was sustained by this thought, — that it matters not whether he was dead
or not who is called by the Lord; to whom it is an easy thing, even by a
word, to raise the dead through his own power.

<span id="viii.viii-p15"></span>We have here also a type and a pattern
of the call of us all, by which our beginning is set before our eyes,
not as to our first birth, but as to the hope of future life, — that
when we are called by the Lord we emerge from nothing; for whatever we
may seem to be we have not, no, not a spark of anything good, which can
render us fit for the kingdom of God. That we may indeed on the other
hand be in a suitable state to hear the call of God, we must be
altogether dead in ourselves. The character of the divine calling is,
that they who are dead are raised by the Lord, that they who are nothing
begin to be something through his power. The word *call* ought not to be
confined to preaching, but it is to be taken, according to the usage of
Scripture, for raising up; and it is intended to set forth more fully
the power of God, who raises up, as it were by a nod only, whom he
wills.  <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md)

<span id="viii.ix-p5"></span><span id="viii.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p6"></span>**18.** *Who against hope*, *etc.* If we
thus read, the sense is, that when there was no probable reason, yea,
when all things were against him, he yet continued to believe. And,
doubtless, there is nothing more injurious to faith than to fasten our
minds to our eyes, that we may from what we see, seek a reason for our
hope. We may also read, “above hope,” and perhaps more suitably; as
though he had said that by his faith he far surpassed all that he could
conceive; for except faith flies upward on celestial wings so as to look
down on all the perceptions of the flesh as on things far below, it will
stick fast in the mud of the world. But Paul uses the word *hope* twice
in this verse: in the first instance, he means a probable evidence for
hoping, such as can be derived from nature and carnal reason; in the
second he refers to faith given by God;  <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) for when he had no ground for hoping
he yet in hope relied on the promise of God; and he thought it a
sufficient reason for hoping, that the Lord had promised, however
incredible the thing was in itself.

<span id="viii.ix-p8"></span>*According to what had been said,* *etc.*
So have I preferred to render it, that it may be applied to the time of
Abraham; for Paul meant to say, that Abraham, when many temptations were
drawing him to despair, that he might not fail, turned his thoughts to
what had been promised to him, “Thy seed shall equal the stars of heaven
and the sands of the sea;” but he resignedly adduced this quotation
incomplete, in order to stimulate us to read the Scriptures. The
Apostles, indeed, at all times, in quoting the Scriptures, took a
scrupulous care to rouse us to a more diligent reading of them.

<span id="viii.x"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p1"></span><span id="viii.x-p1.1"></span>[Romans

<span id="viii.x-p2"></span>**19.** And being not weak in faith, he
considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years
old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah’s womb:

<span id="viii.x-p3"></span>**19.** Ac fide minime debilitatus, non
consideravit suum ipsius corpus jam emortuum, centenaries quum fere
esset, nec emortuam vulvam Saræ:

<span id="viii.x-p4"></span>**20.** He staggered not at the promise of
God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;

<span id="viii.x-p5"></span>**20.** Nec vero in Dei promissionem nec

<span id="viii.x-p6"></span>**21.** And being fully persuaded that, what
he had promised, he was able also to perform.

<span id="viii.x-p7"></span>**21.** Ac certe persuasus, quod ubi quid

<span id="viii.x-p8"></span>**22.** And therefore it was imputed to him
for righteousness.

<span id="viii.x-p9"></span>**22.** Ideo et imputatum illi est in
justitiam.

<span id="viii.x-p10"></span><span id="viii.x-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p11"></span>**19.** *In faith*, *etc.* If you prefer to
omit one of the negatives you may render it thus, “Being weak in faith,
he considered not his own body,” etc.; but this makes no sense. He
indeed shows now more fully what might have hindered, yea, and wholly
turned Abraham aside from receiving the promise. A seed from Sarah was
promised to him at a time when he was not by nature fit for generating,
nor Sarah for conceiving. Whatever he could see as to himself was
opposed to the accomplishment of the promise. Hence, that he might yield
to the truth of God, he withdrew his mind from those things which
presented themselves to his own view, and as it were forgot himself.

<span id="viii.x-p12"></span>You are not however to think, that he had
no regard whatever to his own body, now dead, since Scripture testifies
to the contrary; for he reasoned thus with himself, “Shall a child be
born to a man an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety, bear
a son?” But as he laid aside the consideration of all this, and resigned
his own judgment to the Lord, the Apostle says, that he *considered
not*, etc.; and truly it was a greater effort to withdraw his thoughts
from what of itself met his eyes, than if such a thing came into his
mind.

<span id="viii.x-p13"></span>And that the body of Abraham was become
through age incapable of generating, at the time he received the Lord’s
blessing, is quite evident from this passage, and also from <span
id="viii.x-p13.1"></span>[Gen. 17:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#017.md),
[Gen. 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#011.md)<span
id="viii.x-p13.1"></span>, so that the opinion of <span
id="viii.x-p13.2"></span>Augustine is by no means to be admitted, who
says somewhere, that the impediment was in Sarah alone. Nor ought the
absurdity of the objection to influence us, by which he was induced to
have recourse to this solution; for he thought it inconsistent to
suppose that Abraham in his hundredth year was incapable of generating,
as he had afterwards many children. But by this very thing God rendered
his power more visible, inasmuch as he, who was before like a dry and
barren tree, was so invigorated by the celestial blessing, that he not
only begot Isaac, but, as though he was restored to the vigor of age, he
had afterwards strength to beget others. But some one may object and
say, that it is not beyond the course of nature that a man should beget
children at that age. Though I allow that such a thing is not a prodigy,
it is yet very little short of a miracle. And then, think with how many
toils, sorrows, wanderings, distresses, had that holy man been exercised
all his life; and it must be confessed, that he was no more debilitated
by age, than worn out and exhausted by toils. And lastly, his body is
not called barren simply but comparatively; for it was not probable that
he, who was unfit for begetting in the flower and vigor of age, should
begin only now when nature had decayed.

<span id="viii.x-p14"></span>The expression, *being not weak in faith,*
take in this sense — that he vacillated not, nor fluctuated, as we
usually do under difficult circumstances. There is indeed a twofold
weakness of faith — one is that which, by succumbing to trying
adversities, occasions a falling away from the supporting power of God —
the other arises from imperfection, but does not extinguish faith
itself: for the mind is never so illuminated, but that many relics of
ignorance remain; the heart is never so strengthened, but that much
doubting cleaves to it. Hence with these vices of the flesh, ignorance
and doubt, the faithful have a continual conflict, and in this conflict
their faith is often dreadfully shaken and distressed, but at length it
comes forth victorious; so that they may be said to be strong even in
weakness.

<span id="viii.x-p15"></span><span id="viii.x-p15.1"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p16"></span>**20.** *Nor did he through unbelief make
an inquiry*, *etc.* Though I do not follow the old version, nor <span
id="viii.x-p16.1"></span>Erasmus, yet my rendering is not given without
reason. The Apostle seems to have had this in view, — That Abraham did
not try to find out, by weighing the matter in the balance of unbelief,
whether the Lord was able to perform what he had promised. What is
properly to inquire or to search into anything, is to examine it through
diffidence or mistrust, and to be unwilling to admit what appears not
credible, without thoroughly sifting it.  <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) He indeed asked, how it could come to
pass, but that was the asking of one astonished; as the case was with
the virgin Mary, when she inquired of the angel how could that be which
he had announced; and there are other similar instances. The saints
then, when a message is brought them respecting the works of God, the
greatness of which exceeds their comprehension, do indeed burst forth
into expressions of wonder; but from this wonder they soon pass on to
lay hold on the power of God: on the contrary, the wicked, when they
examine a message, scoff at and reject it as a fable. Such, as you will
find, was the case with the Jews, when they asked Christ how he could
give his flesh to be eaten. For this reason it was, that Abraham was not
reproved when he laughed and asked, how could a child be born to a man
an hundred years old, and to a woman of ninety; for in his astonishment
he fully admitted the power of God’s word. On the other hand, a similar
laughter and inquiry on the part of Sarah were not without reproof,
because she regarded not the promise as valid.

<span id="viii.x-p18"></span>If these things be applied to our present
subject, it will be evident, that the justification of Abraham had no
other beginning than that of the Gentiles. Hence the Jews reproach their
own father, if they exclaim against the call of the Gentiles as a thing
unreasonable. Let us also remember, that the condition of us all is the
same with that of Abraham. All things around us are in opposition to the
promises of God: He promises immortality; we are surrounded with
mortality and corruption: He declares that he counts us just; we are
covered with sins: He testifies that he is propitious and kind to us;
outward judgments threaten his wrath. What then is to be done? We must
with closed eyes pass by ourselves and all things connected with us,
that nothing may hinder or prevent us from believing that God is true.

<span id="viii.x-p19"></span>*But he was strengthened*, *etc.* This is
of the same import with a former clause, when it is said, that he was
not weak in faith. It is the same as though he had said, that he
overcame unbelief by the constancy and firmness of faith.  <span
id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) No one indeed comes forth a conqueror
from this contest, but he who borrows weapons and strength from the word
of God. From what he adds, *giving glory to God*, it must be observed,
that no greater honor can be given to God, than by faith to seal his
truth; as, on the other hand, no greater dishonor can be done to him,
than to refuse his offered favor, or to discredit his word. It is hence
the chief thing in honoring God, obediently to embrace his promises: and
true religion begins with faith.

<span id="viii.x-p21"></span><span id="viii.x-p21.1"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p22"></span>**21.** *That what he had promised*, *etc.*
As all men acknowledge God’s power, Paul seems to say nothing very
extraordinary of the faith of Abraham; but experience proves, that
nothing is more uncommon, or more difficult, than to ascribe to God’s
power the honor which it deserves. There is in deed no obstacle, however
small and insignificant, by which the flesh imagines the hand of God is
restrained from working. Hence it is, that in the slightest trials, the
promises of God slide away from us. When there is no contest, it is
true, no one, as I have said, denies that God can do all things; but as
soon as anything comes in the way to impede the course of God’s promise,
we cast down God’s power from its eminence. Hence, that it may obtain
from us its right and its honor, when a contest comes, we ought to
determine thus, — That it is no less sufficient to overcome the
obstacles of the world, than the strong rays of the sun are to dissipate
the mists. We are indeed wont ever to excuse ourselves, that we derogate
nothing from God’s power, whenever we hesitate respecting his promises,
and we commonly say, “The thought, that God promises more in his word
than he can perform, (which would be a falsehood and blasphemy against
him,) is by no means the cause of our hesitation; but that it is the
defect which we feel in ourselves.” But we do not sufficiently exalt the
power of God, unless we think it to be greater than our weakness. Faith
then ought not to regard our weakness, misery, and defects, but to fix
wholly its attention on the power of God alone; for if it depends on our
righteousness or worthiness, it can never ascend to the consideration of
God’s power. And it is a proof of the unbelief, of which he had before
spoken, when we mete the Lord’s power with our own measure. For faith
does not think that God can do all things, while it leaves him sitting
still, but when, on the contrary, it regards his power in continual
exercise, and applies it, especially, to the accomplishment of his word:
for the hand of God is ever ready to execute whatever he has declared by
his mouth.

<span id="viii.x-p23"></span>It seems strange to me, that <span
id="viii.x-p23.1"></span>Erasmus approved of the relative in the
masculine gender; for though the sense is not changed, we may yet come
nearer to the Greek words of Paul. The verb, I know, is passive;  <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) but the abruptness may be lessened by
a little change.

<span id="viii.x-p25"></span><span id="viii.x-p25.1"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p26"></span>**22.** *And it was therefore imputed*,
 <span id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) *etc.* It becomes now more
clear, how and in what manner faith brought righteousness to Abraham;
and that was, because he, leaning on God’s word, rejected not the
promised favor. And this connection of faith with the word ought to be
well understood and carefully remembered; for faith can bring us nothing
more than what it receives from the word. Hence he does not become
immediately just, who is imbued only with a general and confused idea
that God is true, except he reposes on the promise of his favor.

<span id="viii.xi"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p1"></span><span id="viii.xi-p1.1"></span>[Romans
4:23-25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#023.md)<span id="viii.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p2"></span>**23.** Now it was not written for his sake
alone, that it was imputed to him;

<span id="viii.xi-p3"></span>**23.** Non est autem scriptum propter
ipsum tantum, imputatum fuisse illi;

<span id="viii.xi-p4"></span>**24.** But for us also, to whom it shall
be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the
dead;

<span id="viii.xi-p5"></span>**24.** Sed etiam propter nos, quibus
imputabitur credentibus in eum, qui excitavit lesum Dominum nostrum ex
mortuis:

<span id="viii.xi-p6"></span>**25.** Who was delivered for our offences,
and was raised again for our justification.

<span id="viii.xi-p7"></span>**25.** Qui traditus fuit propter delicta
nostra, et excitatus propter nostram justificationem.

<span id="viii.xi-p8"></span><span id="viii.xi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p9"></span>**23.** *Now it was not written,* *etc.* A
proof from example is not always valid, of which I have before reminded
you; lest this should be questioned, Paul expressly affirms, that in the
person of Abraham was exhibited an example of a common righteousness,
which belongs equally to all.

<span id="viii.xi-p10"></span>We are, by this passage, reminded of the
duty of seeking profit from the examples recorded in Scripture. That
history is the teacher of what life ought to be, is what heathens have
with truth said; but as it is handed down by them, no one can derive
from it sound instruction. Scripture alone justly claims to itself an
office of this kind. For in the first place it prescribes general rules,
by which we may test every other history, so as to render it serviceable
to us: and in the second place, it clearly points out what things are to
be followed, and what things are to be avoided. But as to doctrine,
which it especially teaches, it possesses this peculiarity, — that it
clearly reveals the providence of God, his justice and goodness towards
his own people, and his judgments on the wicked.

<span id="viii.xi-p11"></span>What then is recorded of Abraham is by
Paul denied to have been written only for his sake; for the subject is
not what belongs to the special call of one or of any particular person;
but that way of obtaining righteousness is described, which is ever the
same with regard to all; and it is what belonged to the common father of
the faithful, on whom the eyes of all ought to be fixed.

<span id="viii.xi-p12"></span>If then we would make a right and proper
use of sacred histories, we must remember so to use them as to draw from
them sound doctrine. They instruct us, in some parts, how to frame our
life; in others, how to strengthen faith; and then, how we are to be
stirred up to serve the Lord. In forming our life, the example of the
saints may be useful; and we may learn from them sobriety, chastity,
love, patience, moderation, contempt of the world, and other virtues.
What will serve to confirm faith is the help which God ever gave them,
the protection which brought comfort in adversities, and the paternal
care which he ever exercised over them. The judgments of God, and the
punishments inflicted on the wicked, will also aid us, provided they
fill us with that fear which imbues the heart with reverence and
devotion.

<span id="viii.xi-p13"></span>But by saying, *not on his account only,*
he seems to intimate, that it was written partly for his sake. Hence
some think, that what Abraham obtained by faith was commemorated to his
praise, because the Lord will have his servants to be forever
remembered, according to what Solomon says, that their name will be
blessed. (<span id="viii.xi-p13.1"></span>[Pr
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/pro010.htm#007)<span id="viii.xi-p13.1"></span>..md)
But what if you take the words, *not on his account only*, in a simpler
form, as though it were some singular privilege, not fit to be made an
example of, but yet suitable to teach us, who must be justified in the
same manner? This certainly would be a more appropriate sense.

<span id="viii.xi-p14"></span><span id="viii.xi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p15"></span>**24.** *Who believe on him*, *etc.* I
have already reminded you of the design of those periphrastic
expressions: Paul introduced them, that he might, according to what the
passages may require, describe in various ways the real character of
faith — of which the resurrection of Christ is not the smallest part;
for it is the ground of our hope as to eternal life. Had he said only,
that we believe in God, it could not have been so readily learnt how
this could serve to obtain righteousness; but when Christ comes forth
and presents to us in his own resurrection a sure pledge of life, it
then appears evident from what fountain the imputation of righteousness
flows.

<span id="viii.xi-p16"></span><span id="viii.xi-p16.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p17"></span>**25.** *Who was delivered for our
offences*,  <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) *etc.* He expands
and illustrates more at large the doctrine to which I have just
referred. It indeed greatly concerns us, not only to have our minds
directed to Christ, but also to have it distinctly made known how he
attained salvation for us. And though Scripture, when it treats of our
salvation, dwells especially on the death of Christ, yet the Apostle now
proceeds farther: for as his purpose was more explicitly to set forth
the cause of our salvation, he mentions its two parts; and says, first,
that our sins were expiated by the death of Christ, — and secondly, that
by his resurrection was obtained our righteousness. But the meaning is,
that when we possess the benefit of Christ’s death and resurrection,
there is nothing wanting to the completion of perfect righteousness. By
separating his death from his resurrection, he no doubt accommodates
what he says to our ignorance; for it is also true that righteousness
has been obtained for us by that obedience of Christ, which he exhibited
in his death, as the Apostle himself teaches us in the following
chapter. But as Christ, by rising from the dead, made known how much he
had effected by his death, this distinction is calculated to teach us
that our salvation was begun by the sacrifice, by which our sins were
expiated, and was at length completed by his resurrection: for the
beginning of righteousness is to be reconciled to God, and its
completion is to attain life by having death abolished. Paul then means,
that satisfaction for our sins was given on the cross: for it was
necessary, in order that Christ might restore us to the Father’s favor,
that our sins should be abolished by him; which could not have been done
had he not on their account suffered the punishment, which we were not
equal to endure. Hence Isaiah says, that the chastisement of our peace
was upon him. (<span id="viii.xi-p19.5"></span>[Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005)<span id="viii.xi-p19.5"></span>..md)
But he says that he was delivered, and not, that he died; for expiation
depended on the eternal goodwill of God, who purposed to be in this way
pacified.

<span id="viii.xi-p20"></span>*And was raised again for our
justification.* As it would not have been enough for Christ to undergo
the wrath and judgment of God, and to endure the curse due to our sins,
without his coming forth a conqueror, and without being received into
celestial glory, that by his intercession he might reconcile God to us,
the efficacy of justification is ascribed to his resurrection, by which
death was overcome; not that the sacrifice of the cross, by which we are
reconciled to God, contributes nothing towards our justification, but
that the completeness of his favor appears more clear by his coming to
life again.  <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md)

<span id="viii.xi-p22"></span>But I cannot assent to those who refer
this second clause to newness of life; for of that the Apostle has not
begun to speak; and further, it is certain that both clauses refer to
the same thing. For if justification means renovation, then that he died
for our sins must be taken in the same sense, as signifying that he
acquired for us grace to mortify the flesh; which no one admits. Then,
as he is said to have died for our sins, because he delivered us from
the evil of death by suffering death as a punishment for our sins; so he
is now said to have been raised for our justification, because he fully
restored life to us by his resurrection: for he was first smitten by the
hand of God, that in the person of the sinner he might sustain the
misery of sin; and then he was raised to life, that he might freely
grant to his people righteousness and life.  <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) He therefore still speaks of
imputative justification; and this will be confirmed by what immediately
follows in the next chapter.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[129](cc38007.htm#fr_128.md) <span
id="viii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span> This chapter, as <span
id="viii.i-p7.1"></span>Turrettin observes, divides itself into three
parts. The *first* from 1 to 12 inclusive, the *second* from 13 to 17
inclusive, in which it is proved that the promises made to Abraham did
not depend on the law; and the *third* from 18 to the end, in which the
faith of Abraham is commended, and the Christian faith briefly referred
to.

<span id="viii.i-p8"></span>But <span id="viii.i-p8.1"></span>Pareus
makes a different division: 1, Four proofs of justification by faith,
from 1 to 16; 2, The dispensation of Abraham, from 17 to 22; 3, The
application of the subject, from 23 to 25. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_129"></span>[130](cc38007.htm#fr_129.md) <span
id="viii.i-p12.2"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p13"></span> So did all the fathers according to <span
id="viii.i-p13.1"></span>Pareus*,* and so does the *Vulgate.* But later
commentators have taken the words as they stand, and with good reason,
for otherwise the correspondence between this and the following verse
would not be apparent. <span id="viii.i-p13.2"></span>Beza*,* <span
id="viii.i-p13.3"></span>Hammond*,* and <span
id="viii.i-p13.4"></span>Macknight take the words in their proper order;
and this is what is done by the Syriac and Arabic versions.

<span id="viii.i-p14"></span>Κατὰ σάρκα is rendered by <span
id="viii.i-p14.1"></span>Grotius and <span
id="viii.i-p14.2"></span>Macknight*,* “by (<span
id="viii.i-p14.3"></span>*per*) the flesh. Some understand by the word
“flesh,” circumcision, as <span id="viii.i-p14.4"></span>Vatablus*;*
others, natural powers, as <span id="viii.i-p14.5"></span>Grotius But
<span id="viii.i-p14.6"></span>Beza and <span
id="viii.i-p14.7"></span>Hammond think that it is the same as what is
meant “by works” in the next verse; and “flesh” evidently has this
meaning: it signifies often the performance of what the law requires,
the observance not only of ceremonial but also of moral duties. See
<span id="viii.i-p14.8"></span>[Ga
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#003.md)<span id="viii.i-p14.8"></span>;
<span id="viii.i-p14.9"></span>[Ga

3:3](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#004.md)<span id="viii.i-p14.10"></span>;
where Paul gives up “all confidence in the *flesh,*” and enumerates,
among other things, his strict conformity to the law. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_130"></span>[131](cc38007.htm#fr_130.md) <span
id="viii.i-p16.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p17"></span> *Epicheirema;* in Greek ἐπιχείρεμα, an
attempted but an unfinished process of reasoning. It is not necessary to
introduce this sort of syllogism, it being not the character of
Scripture nor of any other writing to discuss matters in this form.

<span id="viii.i-p18"></span>The word for “glorying” here, καύχημα, is
different from that in <span id="viii.i-p18.1"></span>[Ro
3:27](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#027.md)<span id="viii.i-p18.1"></span>,
καύχησις, and means reason, ground, or cause for glorying, and is
rendered by <span id="viii.i-p18.2"></span>Grotius “<span
id="viii.i-p18.3"></span>unde laudem speret — whereby he may hope for
praise;” and by <span id="viii.i-p18.4"></span>Beza and <span
id="viii.i-p18.5"></span>Piscator “<span id="viii.i-p18.6"></span>unde
glorietur — whereby he may glory.” To complete the following clause,
most repeat the words ἔχει καύχημα — “But he has no ground for glorying
before God.” <span id="viii.i-p18.7"></span>Vatablus gives another
meaning, “But not with regard to God,” that is, with regard to what he
has said in his word; and this view is confirmed by what immediately
follows, “For what saith the Scripture?” In this case there is nothing
understood. That πρὸς θεόν is used in a similar manner, is evident from
other passages: τα πρὸς θεόν — “things which pertain to God,” i.e., to
God’s work or service. See <span id="viii.i-p18.8"></span>[Heb
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#017.md)<span id="viii.i-p18.8"></span>;
<span id="viii.i-p18.9"></span>[Heb
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p18.9"></span>. —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_131"></span>[132](cc38007.htm#fr_131.md) <span
id="viii.i-p21.2"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p22"></span> The adoption is evidently included in the
words, found in the first verse of this chapter, “I am thy shield and
thy exceeding great reward.” What follows is connected with this, and
the promise of a numerous seed arose from what Abraham said respecting
an heir. His *believing* then had an especial regard to the first
promise, as the second, respecting his “seed,” was only, as it were, an
enlargement of the first, or an addition to it. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_132"></span>[133](cc38007.htm#fr_132.md) <span
id="viii.i-p23.2"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p24"></span> The foregoing observations contain a lucid
and a satisfactory view of the character of Abraham’s faith, perfectly
consistent with what is said of it by Paul in this chapter, and in the
epistle to the Galatians. Some think that the *principle* of faith was
the only thing which the Apostle had in view in referring to Abraham’s
faith, and that he had no special regard to the object of justifying
faith, that is, Christ. But that Christ was, in a measure, revealed to
him, is evident from the account given in Genesis, and from what Christ
himself has said, — that Abraham saw his day and rejoiced, <span
id="viii.i-p24.1"></span>[Joh
8:56](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#056.md)<span id="viii.i-p24.1"></span>.
At the same time it was the promise of gratuitous mercy, as Calvin
intimates, that formed the most distinctive object of Abraham’s faith,
the promise of a free acceptance, without any regard to works. There are
two things which the Apostle clearly intended to show, — that imputation
of righteousness is an act of gratuitous favor, — and that it is alone
by faith.

<span id="viii.i-p25"></span>There is some difference in the wording,
though not in the meaning, of the sentence from <span
id="viii.i-p25.1"></span>[Ge 15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md)<span
id="viii.i-p25.1"></span>. Paul gives it literally according to the
Septuagint. The word “Abraham,” is put in; instead of “Jehovah,” it is
“God;” the verb “count,” is made passive, and a preposition is placed
before “righteousness.” The Hebrew is this, — “And he believed on
Jehovah, and he counted it to him righteousness.” The “it,” no doubt,
refers to what is included in the word “believed.” So Paul explains it
in <span id="viii.i-p25.2"></span>[Ro
4:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#009.md)<span id="viii.i-p25.2"></span>,
where he expressly puts down πίστις, faith.

<span id="viii.i-p26"></span>It has been said that this faith of Abraham
was not faith in Christ, according to what the context shows in Genesis.
And it was not so specifically: nor does Paul represent it as such; for
this was not his object. He states it throughout as faith in God; it was
believing the testimony of God; but that testimony embraced a promise
respecting Christ; so that it included the Savior within its compass. We
must remember that Paul’s object is to establish this truth, — that
righteousness is attained by faith and not by works; and that for this
end he adduces the examples both of Abraham and David. It was not his
design to point out specifically the object of justifying faith. We must
keep this in view, in order to understand the reasoning of the Apostle
in this chapter: it is the power and efficacy of faith, in opposition to
all works, that he particularly dwells upon, and the gracious promise of
God was its object. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_133"></span>[134](cc38007.htm#fr_133.md) <span
id="viii.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p11"></span> Some have stumbled at this sentence, —
“his faith is counted for righteousness,” and have misapplied it, as
though faith were in itself the cause of righteousness, and hence a
meritorious act, and not the way and means of attaining righteousness.
Condensed sentences will not submit to the rules of logic, but must be
interpreted according to the context and explanations elsewhere found.
“His faith” means, no doubt, his faith in the Promise, or in God who
promises, or in him who, as is said in this verse, “justifies the
ungodly:” hence what is believed, or the object of faith, is what is
counted for righteousness. This accords with the declarations, — that
“man is justified by faith,” <span id="viii.ii-p11.1"></span>[Ro
3:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#028.md)<span id="viii.ii-p11.1"></span>,
and that “the righteousness of God” is “by faith,” <span
id="viii.ii-p11.2"></span>[Ro
3:22](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#022.md)<span id="viii.ii-p11.2"></span>.
If *by* faith, then faith itself is not that righteousness.

<span id="viii.ii-p12"></span>“Beware,” says <span
id="viii.ii-p12.1"></span>Chalmers*,* “of having any such view of faith
as will lead you to annex to it the kind of merit, or of claim, or of
glorying under the gospel, which are annexed to works under the law.
This, in fact, were just animating with a legal spirit the whole
phraseology and doctrine of the gospel. It is God who justifies. He drew
up the title-deed, and he bestowed the title-deed. It is ours simply to
lay hold of it...Any other view of faith than that which excludes
boasting must be altogether unscriptural.” — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_134"></span>[135](cc38007.htm#fr_134.md) <span
id="viii.iii-p9.2"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p10"></span> Speaking of this righteousness, <span
id="viii.iii-p10.1"></span>Pareus says, “It is not ours, otherwise God
would not gratuitously impute it, but bestow it as a matter of right;
nor is it a habit or quality, for it is without works, and imputed to
the *ungodly,* who have habitually nothing but iniquities; but it is a
gratuitous remission, a covering, a non-imputation of sins.”

<span id="viii.iii-p11"></span>It is a striking proof of what the
Apostle had in view here, that he stop short and does not quote the
whole verse from <span id="viii.iii-p11.1"></span>[Ps
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md)<span id="viii.iii-p11.1"></span>.
He leaves out, “and in whose spirit there is no guile:” and why?
Evidently because his subject is justification, and not sanctification.
He has thus most clearly marked the difference between the two.

<span id="viii.iii-p12"></span>Sins may be said to be “forgiven” or
remitted, because they are debts, and “covered,” because they are filthy
and abominable in the sight of God: and they are said to be “not
imputed,” or not put to one’s account, in order to convey an assurance,
that they are wholly removed, and shall be no more remembered. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_135"></span>[136](cc38007.htm#fr_135.md) <span

<span id="viii.iv-p3"></span> This “only” is not in the original, but is
supplied by most commentators: yet it is not necessary, nor makes the
meaning consistent with what follows in <span
id="viii.iv-p3.1"></span>[Romans
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#010.md)<span id="viii.iv-p3.1"></span>.
The Καὶ; in the next clause is omitted in many copies; but if retained,
it will not alter the sense. We may render this part of the verse thus,

<span id="viii.iv-p4"></span>“*Came* then this blessedness on the
circumcision, or even on the uncircumcision?”

<span id="viii.iv-p5"></span>Then in the tenth verse he answerers in the
negative, — that it was not to Abraham while “in circumcision,” but
while he was a “in uncircumcision.” The reference is evidently to the
first state of things, to the case of Abraham himself. Abraham is
supposed to have been justified by faith about *fourteen* years before
he was circumcised. — *Ed.*

<span id="fn_136"></span>[137](cc38007.htm#fr_136.md) <span
id="viii.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p11"></span> The word “sign” in this passage, σημεῖον,
seems not to mean an outward token of something inward, but a mark,
circumcision itself, which was imprinted, as it were, as a mark in the
flesh. So <span id="viii.v-p11.1"></span>Macknight renders it, “The mark
of circumcision.” That circumcision was a sign or a symbol of what was
spiritual, is evident: but this is not what is taught here. Circumcision
is expressly called “a token,” or a sign, in <span
id="viii.v-p11.2"></span>[Ge
17:11](../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#011.md)<span id="viii.v-p11.2"></span>;
but it is said to have been “a token of the covenant,” that is, a proof
and an evidence of it. The *design* of circumcision is expressed by the
next word, σφραγίδα — seal. This sometimes signified the instrument,
<span id="viii.v-p11.3"></span>[1Ki
21:8](../../../bib/kjv/kg1021.htm#008.md)<span id="viii.v-p11.3"></span>;
and sometimes the impression, <span id="viii.v-p11.4"></span>[Re
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rev005.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.v-p11.4"></span>:
and the impression was used for various purposes, — to close up a
document, to secure a thing, and also to confirm an agreement. It is
taken here in the latter sense; circumcision was a “seal,” a
confirmation, an evidence, a proof, or a pledge, “of the righteousness”
obtained “by faith.” We meet not with any distinct statement of this
kind in Genesis: it is what the Apostle had gathered, and rightly
gathered, from the account given us of what took place between God and
Abraham. — *Ed.*

<span id="viii.vi-p6"></span> Critics have differed as to the
disjunctive ἤ, *or,* “or to his seed.” Some think it is put for καὶ,
*and:* but <span id="viii.vi-p6.1"></span>Pareus thinks that it has a
special meaning, intended to anticipate an objection. The Jews might
have said, “If the case with Abraham is as stated, it is not so with his
seed who received the law.” Yes, says Paul, there is no difference, “The
promise to Abraham, or to his seed, to whom the law was actually given,
was not by the law.”

<span id="viii.vi-p7"></span><span id="viii.vi-p7.1"></span>Hammond
renders the whole verse more literally than in our version, — “The
promise to Abraham or to his seed, that he should be the heir of the
world, was not by the law, but through the righteousness of faith.” —
*Ed.*

<span id="fn_139"></span>[140](cc38007.htm#fr_139.md) <span

<span id="viii.vi-p10"></span> There is in Genesis no expression
conveyed in these words; but the probability is, that he intended to
express in another form what he distinctly quotes in <span
id="viii.vi-p10.1"></span>[Ro
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#017.md)<span id="viii.vi-p10.1"></span>,
“I have made thee a father of many nations.”

<span id="viii.vi-p11"></span>The word “father,” in this case, has been
commonly understood to mean a leader, a pattern, a model, an exemplar, a
forerunner, as Abraham was the first believer justified by faith, of
whom there is an express record. But the idea seems to be somewhat
different. He was a father as the first possessor of an inheritance
which was to descend to all his children. The inheritance was given him
by grace through faith; it was to descend, as it were, to all his lawful
posterity, to all his legitimate seed, that is, to all who possessed the
like faith with himself. He is therefore called the father of many
nations, because many nations would become his legitimate heirs by
becoming believers; and in the same sense must be regarded the
expression here, “the heir of the world;” he was the representative of
all the believing world, and made an heir of an inheritance which was to
come to the world in general, to the believing Jews and to the believing
Gentiles. He was the heir, the first possessor, of what was to descend
to the world without any difference. He was the heir of the world in the
same sense as he was “the father of all who believe,” as he is said to
have been in verse eleventh.

<span id="viii.vi-p12"></span>The inheritance was doubtless eternal life
or the heavenly kingdom, the country above, of which the land of Canaan
was a type and a pledge. See <span id="viii.vi-p12.1"></span>[Heb.
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#013.md),

id="viii.vii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p15"></span> It is better to take this sentence,
“Where there is no law, there is no transgression,” according to its
obvious meaning; as it comports better with the former clause. The
reasoning seems to be this, — “The promise is by faith, and not by the
law; for the law brings wrath or condemnation: but where there is no
law, there is no transgression to occasion wrath.” The same idea is
essentially conveyed in verse <span id="viii.vii-p15.1"></span>[Ro
4:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#016.md)<span id="viii.vii-p15.1"></span>,
where it is said, that the promise is sure, because it is through faith
and by grace. Had it been by the law, there would have been
transgression and wrath, and hence the loss of the promise.

<span id="viii.vii-p16"></span>This verse is connected with the <span
id="viii.vii-p16.1"></span>[Romans
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013.md)<span id="viii.vii-p16.1"></span>
rather than with the 14th. It contains another reason, besides what
<span id="viii.vii-p16.2"></span>[Ro
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#014.md)<span id="viii.vii-p16.2"></span>
gives, in confirmation of what is said in <span
id="viii.vii-p16.3"></span>[Ro
4:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013.md)<span id="viii.vii-p16.3"></span>.
Hence <span id="viii.vii-p16.4"></span>Macknight renders γὰρ, in this
verse, “farther,” which renders the connection more evident. “Where no
law is, there is no transgression, and therefore no wrath or punishment;
but where law is, there is transgression, wrath, and punishment.” —
<span id="viii.vii-p16.5"></span>Pareus

<span id="fn_141"></span>[142](cc38007.htm#fr_141.md) <span
id="viii.viii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p11"></span> It appears from <span
id="viii.viii-p11.1"></span>Pareus and <span
id="viii.viii-p11.2"></span>Hammond, that some of the Fathers such as
<span id="viii.viii-p11.3"></span>Chrysostom, and <span
id="viii.viii-p11.4"></span>Theophylact, regarded κατέναντι in the sense
of ὁμοίως, *like*, and have rendered the passage, “like God, in whom he
believed;” that is, that as God is not partial, but the Father of all,
so Abraham was. But this meaning is not consistent with the import of
κατέναντι, nor with the context. The preposition is found in four other
places, <span id="viii.viii-p11.5"></span>[Mr
11:2](../../../bib/kjv/mar011.htm#002.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p11.5"></span>; <span id="viii.viii-p11.6"></span>[Mr

19:30](../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#030.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p11.8"></span>, and invariably means *before*, or, *over
against*. The *Septuagint* use it in <span
id="viii.viii-p11.9"></span>[Nu
25:4](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#004.md)<span
id="viii.viii-p11.9"></span>, in the sense of *before*, κατέναντι τοῦ
ἡλίου — “before the sun,” not “*against* the sun” as in our version; for
the word in Hebrew is <span id="viii.viii-p11.10"></span>נגד, <span
id="viii.viii-p11.11"></span>*Coram*, *in conspectu*. The context also
requires this meaning: Abraham was a father of many nations *before*
God, or, in the view or estimation of God, and not in the view or
estimation of men, because God, as it is said at the end of the verse,
regards things which are not, as though they were. Hence Abraham was
already in God’s view, according to his purpose, the father of many
nations.

<span id="viii.viii-p12"></span>The collocation of the words is said by
<span id="viii.viii-p12.1"></span>Wolfius to be an instance of Atticism,
the word θεοῦ, being separated from its preposition: and οὗ is put for ᾧ
by the grammatical law of attraction; and <span
id="viii.viii-p12.2"></span>Stuart brings three similar instances of the
relative being regulated by the case of its noun, though preceding it in
the sentence, <span id="viii.viii-p12.3"></span>[Mr

<span id="viii.viii-p16"></span> The idea of commanding to existence, or
of effecting, is given by many Commentators to the word καλοῦντος; but
this seems not necessary. The simple notion of calling, naming,
regarding, or representing, is more consistent with the passage, and
with the construction of the sentence: and the various modes of
rendering it, which critics have proposed, have arisen from not taking
the word in its most obvious meaning. “The literal version is, and who
calls things not existing as existing,” — και καλοῦντος τὰ μὴ ὄντα ὡς
ὄντα. The reference is evidently to the declaration, “I have made thee
the father of many nations.” This had then no real existence; but God
represents it as having an existence already. Far-fetched meanings are
sometimes adopted, when the plainest and the most obvious is passed by.

<span id="viii.ix-p4"></span> “<span id="viii.ix-p4.1"></span>Ut esset:”
this may indeed be rendered according to our version, “that he might
become;” but the drift of the comment seems to favor the other view,
that he believed that he should be, and not that he believed in order to
be, or that he might be, the father of many nations εἰς τὸ γενέσθαι
ἀυτὸν, “that he should be,” is the rendering of <span
id="viii.ix-p4.2"></span>Hammond, <span
id="viii.ix-p4.3"></span>Doddridge, and <span
id="viii.ix-p4.4"></span>Stuart*;* and it is indeed what is consistent
with the drift of the passage, and with what is recorded in Genesis.
<span id="viii.ix-p4.5"></span>Wolfius says, that εἰς here does not
signify the final cause, but the subject or the object of faith and
hope; Abraham believed the promise, that he should be the father of many
nations. — *Ed.*

id="viii.ix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p7"></span> This is a striking instance of the
latitude of meaning which some words have in Scripture. Here hope, in
the first instance, means the *ground* of hope; and in the second, the
*object* of hope. So faith, in <span id="viii.ix-p7.1"></span>[Ro
4:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#005.md)<span id="viii.ix-p7.1"></span>,
and in other places, must be considered as including its object, the
gracious promise of God; for otherwise it will be a meritorious act, the
very thing which the Apostle throughout repudiates with regard to man’s
justification. Faith, as it lays hold on God’s promise of free
acceptance and forgiveness, can alone, in the very nature of things, be
imputed for righteousness: it is not indispensably necessary that the
way, or medium, or the meritorious cause of acceptance and forgiveness,
should be clearly known and distinctly seen; the gracious promise of God
is enough, so that faith may become a justifying faith.

<span id="viii.xi-p18"></span> It is διὰ τὰ παραπτώματα ἡμων, “for our
offenses,” and διὰ τὴν δικαίωσιν ἡμων, “for our justification.” The
preposition διὰ, has here clearly two meanings: the first signifies the
*reason* why, and the second, the *end* for which. How is this to be
known? By the character of the sentence, and by what is taught
elsewhere. *For*, to which <span id="viii.xi-p18.2"></span>Johnson
attaches forty meanings, is commonly understood here as having a
different sense, and this is sufficiently indicated by what is connected
with it. But in case a doubt arises, we have only to consult other
passages in which the subject is handled.

<span id="viii.xi-p19"></span>Take the first instance — “for our
offenses.” There are those who say that διὰ here means *because of*, or,
*on account of;* and this, in order to evade the idea of a propitiation.
The preposition, no doubt, has this sense; but is this its sense here?
If the sentence itself be deemed insufficient to determine the question,
(though to a plain reader it is,) let us see what is said elsewhere of
Christ’s death in connection with our sins or offenses. He himself said,
that he came “to give his life a ransom (λύτρον — a redeeming price) for
many,” <span id="viii.xi-p19.1"></span>[Mt
20:28](../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#028.md)<span id="viii.xi-p19.1"></span>.
It is said, that he “gave himself a ransom (ἀντίλυτρον — a redeeming
price for another) for all,” <span id="viii.xi-p19.2"></span>[1Ti
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.xi-p19.2"></span>.
It is expressly declared, that “Christ was once *offered* to bear the
*sins* of many,” <span id="viii.xi-p19.3"></span>[Heb
9:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#028.md)<span id="viii.xi-p19.3"></span>.
And more to the purpose still, if possible, is the testimony of John,
when he says that Christ “is the propitiation (ἱλασμός — expiation) for
our sins,” <span id="viii.xi-p19.4"></span>[1Jo
2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md)<span id="viii.xi-p19.4"></span>.
Now, can it be that we can give any other meaning to the text, than that
God delivered his Son as a sacrifice for our offenses? This is the
doctrine of Scripture throughout. — *Ed.*

<span id="viii.xi-p21"></span> Christ is said here to have been raised
from the dead by *God*, as well as delivered into death. “However much
of the import of this,” says <span id="viii.xi-p21.1"></span>Chalmers,
“may have escaped the notice of an ordinary reader, it is pregnant with
meaning of the weightiest importance. You know that when the prison door
is opened to a criminal, and that by the very authority which lodged him
there, it envinces that the debt of his transgression has been rendered,
and that he stands aquitted of all it’s penalties. It was not for his
own, but for our offenses that Jesus was delivered unto the death, and
that his body was consigned to the imprisonment of the grave. And when
an angel descended from heaven, and rolled back the great stone from the
door of the sepulchre, this speaks to us, that the justice of God is
satisfied, that the ransom of our iniquity has been paid, that Christ
has rendered a full discharge of all the debt for which he undertook as
the great surety between God and the sinners who believe in him.” —
