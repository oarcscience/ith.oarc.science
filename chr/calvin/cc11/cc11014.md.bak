<span id="xv-p1"></span>PSALM 106

<span id="xv-p2"></span>This psalm differs from the preceding, inasmuch
as there the Psalmist showed that God had been more than a bountiful
father to his chosen people, in order to procure for himself, in coming
ages, a race of pure worshippers, while here he acknowledges that these
remarkable benefits had been turned to a bad account; because the Jews
from time to time threw off the yoke of God, basely abused his kindness,
defiled themselves with many pollutions, and also perfidiously departed
from his word. Nevertheless, it is not so much in the shape of a reproof
or complaint, as a confession of their sins, in order to the obtaining
the pardon of them. For the prophet commences with the praises of God,
with the design of encouraging both himself and others to cherish good
hope in him. Then he prays that God would continue his blessing to the
seed of Abraham. But because the people, after so frequently revolting
from God, were unworthy of the continuation of his kindness, he asks
pardon to be extended to them, and this after he had confessed that from
first to last, they had provoked God’s wrath by their malice,
ingratitude, pride, perfidy, and other vices.  <span

106:1-5](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#001.md)<span id="xv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p2"></span>**1.** Hallelujah.  <span
id="fr_237"></span>[238](#fn_237.md) Praise ye Jehovah; because he is good;
 <span id="fr_238"></span>[239](#fn_238.md) because his mercy endureth for
ever. **2.** Who shall express the power of Jehovah? who shall declare
all his praise? **3.** Blessed are they that keep judgment, and blessed
is he who worketh in righteousness at all times.  <span

the good will which thou bearest towards thy people: visit me with thy
salvation; **5.** That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may
rejoice in the joy of thy nation, and glory with thy heritage.

<span id="xv.i-p6"></span> 

<span id="xv.i-p7"></span><span id="xv.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p8"></span>**1.** *Praise ye Jehovah* This exhortation
supplies the want of a title; not that the psalm contains nothing else
than thanksgiving and praise to God, but that the people, from the
experience of past favors, may obtain the assurance of reconciliation;
and thus entertain the hope that God, although at present offended,
would soon be pacified towards them. In celebrating the praises of God,
therefore, he orders them to call to mind such things as would have a
tendency to assuage their grief on account of present ills, and to
animate their spirits, and prevent them from sinking into despair.
 <span id="fr_240"></span>[241](#fn_240.md)

<span id="xv.i-p10"></span><span id="xv.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p11"></span>**2** *Who shall express.* This verse is
susceptible of two interpretations; for if you read it in connection
with the one immediately following, the sense will be, that all men are
not alike equal to the task of praising God, because the ungodly and the
wicked do nothing else than profane his holy name with their unclean
lips; as it is said in the fiftieth psalm: “But unto the wicked God
saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou
shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?” And hence to this sentence the
following clause should have been annexed, in the form of a reply,
*Blessed are they that keep judgment* I am of opinion, however, that the
prophet had another design, namely, that there is no man who has ever
endeavored to concentrate all his energies, both physical and mental, in
the praising of God, but will find himself inadequate for so lofty a
subject, the transcendent grandeur of which overpowers all our senses.
Not that he exalts the power of God designedly to deter us from
celebrating its praises, but rather as the means of stirring us up to do
so to the utmost of our power. Is it any reason for ceasing our
exertions, that with whatever alacrity we pursue our course, we yet come
far short of perfection? But the thing which ought to inspire us with
the greatest encouragement is, the knowledge that, though ability may
fail us, the praises which from the heart we offer to God are pleasing
to him; only let us beware of callousness; for it would certainly be
very absurd for those who cannot attain to a tithe of perfection, to
make that the occasion of their not reaching to the hundredth part of
it.

<span id="xv.i-p12"></span><span id="xv.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p13"></span>**3** *Blessed are they that keep judgment* I
make a distinction between this and the preceding verse, and yet so as
to preserve the connection between them. For the prophet, having
declared the magnitude of God’s power to be such that no tongue could
utter all its praises, now says, that the praises of the lip merely are
not acceptable to God, but that the concurrence of the heart is
indispensable, nay, that even the whole of our deportment must be in
unison with this exercise. Now, when he first commands to *keep
judgment,* and then to *work righteousness,* he gives us a short
description of genuine godliness. I have no doubt, that in the former
clause he describes the sincere affection of the heart, and that, in the
latter, he refers to external works. For we know, there is nothing but
the mere shadow of righteousness, unless a man cordially devote himself
to the practice of honesty. He requires perseverance, too, that no one
may imagine that he has discharged this duty properly, excepting he
whose constant and continued aim it is to live righteously and justly.
We behold not a few who have only an empty profession; others show some
signs of virtue, but do not maintain a consistent course of conduct.

<span id="xv.i-p14"></span><span id="xv.i-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xv.i-p15"></span>**4** *Remember me* By these words the
prophet declares it to be his chief desire, that God would extend to him
that love which he bore towards the Church, that he might thus become a
participator of all the blessings which, from the very first, he bestows
upon his chosen, and which day by day he continues with them. Nor does
he desire this for himself alone, but in name of the Church Catholic,
offers up a prayer alike for all, that, by his example, he might
stimulate the faithful to present similar petitions.

<span id="xv.i-p16"></span>*Remember me,* says he, *with the good will
which thou bearest towards thy people;* that is to say, grant to me the
same unmerited kindness which thou art pleased to confer upon thy
people, that so I may never be cut off from thy Church, but always be
included among the number of thy children; for the phrase, *good will
towards thy people,* is to be understood passively of that love which
God graciously bears to his elect. It is, however, by a metonymy
employed by the prophet to point out the marks of God’s love. For from
this gracious source flows that proof which he actually and
experimentally gives of his grace. But the prophet, if accounted to
belong to the number of the people of God, would consider this to be the
summit of true happiness; because, by this means, he would feel that God
was reconciled to him, (than which nothing is more desirables) and thus,
too, he would experience that he was bountiful. The term, *remember,*
relates to the circumstance of time, as we shall see towards the end of
the psalm that it was penned when the people were in a state so sad and
calamitous, that the faithful might entertain some secret apprehension
that their God had forgotten them. To obviate this is the tendency of
the next clause, *visit me with thy salvation* For God is said to visit
those from whom he had apparently withdrawn himself; and their salvation
is a demonstration of his good-will towards them. In the next verse he
repeats the same sentiment, *that I may see the good of thy chosen* For
he desires to be an associate and participator of the blessings which
are constantly realised by the elect of God. The verb *to see,* is very
plainly taken to denote the enjoyment of the blessings, as “to see the
kingdom of God,” (<span id="xv.i-p16.1"></span>[Joh
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#003)<span id="xv.i-p16.1"></span>;.md) and
“to see good and life” (<span id="xv.i-p16.2"></span>[1Pe
3:10](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#010)<span id="xv.i-p16.2"></span>,.md)
denote the corresponding blessings. Those who expound it, that I may see
thee do good to the chosen, are mistaken; because the preceding verse
upon which this depends will not bear this interpretation, and the
exposition which I have given is supported by the words which follow,
*that I may rejoice in the joy of thy nation, and glory with thy
heritage* For it is quite obvious that the prophet is solicitous to
become a sharer in all the benefits which are the portion of the chosen,
that, satisfied with God alone, he may, under his providential care,
live joyfully and happily. Whatever might be the then mournful state of
the Church, the prophet, amid all such tumult, still clings fast by this
principle, that there is nothing better than to be regarded as belonging
to the flock and people of God, who will always prove the best of
fathers to his own, and the faithful guardian of their welfare. All that
he asks is, that God would deal with him, as he is wont to deal with his
Church; and declares that he could not bear the thought of being severed
or separated from the common lot of the Church. These words, however,
imply a tacit complaint that at that time God was withholding his
loving-kindness from his afflicted Church, as if he had cast her off
altogether.

<span id="xv.ii"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p1"></span><span id="xv.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
106:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#006.md)<span id="xv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p2"></span>**6.** We have sinned with our fathers, we
have acted iniquitously, we have done wickedly. **7.** Our fathers
understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude
of thy kindnesses; they rebelled at the sea, even the Red Sea. **8.**
Yet he saved them for his own name’s sake, that he might make his power
to be known. **9.** Also he rebuked the Red Sea, and dried it up; and
made them walk through the depths, as through the desert. **10.** And
saved them from the hand of the enemy, and delivered them from the hand
of the wicked. **11.** And the waters covered their oppressors: there
was not one of them left.

<span id="xv.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xv.ii-p4"></span><span id="xv.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p5"></span>**6** *We have sinned with our fathers* It is
quite plain from these words, that although the prophet may have spoken
in the person of one man, he yet dictates a form of prayer for the
common use of the whole Church, seeing that he now identifies himself
with the whole body. And from this to the end of the psalm, he gleans
from ancient histories that their fathers had always been of a malign
and perverse spirit, of corrupt practice, rebellious, ungrateful and
perfidious towards God; and confesses that their descendants were not
better; and having made this confession,  <span
id="fr_241"></span>[242](#fn_241.md) they come and ask the remission of
their sins. And as we are unable to obtain the pardon of our sins until
we have first confessed ourselves to be guilty of sin, and as our
hardness of heart shuts out the grace of God from us, the prophet,
therefore, with great propriety, humbly acknowledges the guilt of the
people in this their severe and sore chastisement, and that God might
justly inflict upon them a yet harder punishment. On another account it
was advantageous for the Jews to have their sins set before them;
because, if God punish us severely, we at once suppose that his promises
have failed. But when, on the contrary, we are reminded that we are
receiving the reward due to us for our transgressions, then if we
thoroughly repent, those promises in which God appears as pacified
towards us will come to our aid. Besides, by the three expressions which
he employs in reference to their transgressions, he points out their
enormity, that (as is usually the case) their hearts might not be
slightly affected, but deeply wounded with sorrow. For we know how men
are fettered by their vices, and how ready to let themselves alone,
until compelled to examine themselves in good earnest; nay, what is
more, when God calls them to judgment, they make a kind of verbal
confession of their iniquities, while, at the same time, hypocrisy
blinds their minds. When, therefore, the prophet says, that the *people
acted iniquitously in sinning,* and had become ungodly and wicked, he
employs no useless or unnecessary accumulation of words. Let any of us
examine ourselves, and we will easily find that we have equal need to be
constrained to make an ingenuous confession of our sins; for though we
dare not say that we have no sin, yet there is not one of us but is
disposed to find a cloak and subterfuge for his sin.

<span id="xv.ii-p7"></span>In a very similar manner, Daniel, in the
ninth chapter of his prophecies, acknowledges the guilt of his own
iniquities and those of the people; and it may be that the author of
this psalm followed his example. From both let us learn, that the only
way of pleasing God is to institute a rigid course of self-examination.
Let it also be carefully observed, that the holy prophets, who never
departed from the fear and worship of God, uniformly confessed their own
guilt in common with the people; and this they did, not out of feigned
humility, but because they were aware that they themselves were tainted
with manifold corruptions, for when iniquity abounds, it is almost
impossible for even the best of men to keep themselves from being
infected by its baneful effects. Not comparing themselves with others,
but sisting themselves before God’s tribunal, they at once perceive the
impossibility of making their escape.

<span id="xv.ii-p8"></span>At that time impiety had attained to such a
degree of enormity among the Jews, that it is not astonishing if even
the best and most upright men were carried away, as if by the violence
of a tempest. How very abominable, then, is the pride of those who
hardly imagine that they offend in the least possible way; nay, who
even, like certain fanatics of the day, conceive that they have attained
to a state of sinless perfection! It must be borne in mind, however,
that Daniel, who carefully kept himself under the fear of God, and whom
the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of the prophet Ezekiel, declares to be one
of the most upright of men, did not with reigned lips acknowledge his
own transgressions, and those of the people, when he confessed them,
under a deep sense of their grievously and dreadfully abhorrent
character in the eyes of God. True, indeed, he was not overwhelmed in
the same torrent of iniquity with others; but he knew that he had
contracted a very large amount of guilt. Besides, the prophet does not
bring forward their fathers for the purpose of palliating his own
delinquency, (as many at the present day set at nought all reproof,
shielding themselves with this, namely, that they have been so taught by
their fathers, and that, therefore, their bad education, and not they,
is at fault,) but rather to show that he and those of his own nation
were obnoxious to severe punishment, because even from the very first,
and as if co-existent with their early infancy, they never ceased to
provoke the displeasure of God against themselves more and more by their
fresh transgressions. It is in this manner that he involves the fathers
with the children in many of the grounds of condemnation.  <span
id="fr_242"></span>[243](#fn_242.md)

<span id="xv.ii-p10"></span><span id="xv.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p11"></span>**7** *Our fathers understood not thy
wonders in Egypt,* Here he relates how the people immediately, from the
very commencement of their emancipation from bondage, were ungrateful to
God, and conducted themselves in a rebellious manner. Nor does he
confine himself to the history of one period only, but the whole drift
of his narrative is to point out that the people had never ceased from
doing wickedly, although God met them in return with inconceivable
kindness; which is a proof of the invincible and desperate perversity of
this nation. He first blames the folly of the people as the occasion of
such ingratitude. In calling it folly, he does not intend to lessen the
offense, (as some are often wont to do,) but to expose the vile and
disgraceful stupidity of the people, in being blind in matters so plain;
for God’s works were such that even the blind might behold them. Whence
could such gross ignorance originate, unless that Satan had so maddened
them that they did not regard the miracles of God, which might have
moved the very stones? Now, when he adds, *they remembered not,* he
expresses more forcibly the inexcusable nature of their ignorance, nay,
that their blindness was the result of stupid indifference, more than
the want of proper instruction. For the cause of their ignorance was
their overlooking those matters which, in themselves, were abundantly
manifest. He further mentions how quickly that forgetfulness came upon
them, which tended to increase their guilt. For it was marvelous that
not even the very sight of these things could arouse their spirits.
Hence it came to pass, that while they had scarcely made their departure
from Egypt, and were passing through the sea, they proudly rose up
against their deliverer. Surely not one year, nor even a century, ought
to have erased from their minds deeds so worthy of being remembered.
What madness, then, at that very time to murmur against God, as if he
had abandoned them to be slaughtered by their enemies? That arm of the
sea through which the people passed is, in the Hebrew, called *the Sea
of Suph.* Some translate it *the Sea of Sedge,* and will have the word
<span id="xv.ii-p11.1"></span>סופ, *suph,* to signify *sea-weed.*  <span
id="fr_243"></span>[244](#fn_243.md) But whatever be its derivation, there
can be no doubt about the place. It is very likely that the name was
given to it because it abounded with rushes.

<span id="xv.ii-p13"></span><span id="xv.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ii-p14"></span>**8** *And saved them* The prophet here
teaches what any one could easily learn from the preceding sentence,
that the Israelites were saved, not on account of their deserving to be
so, but because God had a regard to his own glory. That obstacle being
removed, God went on to accomplish that deliverance which he had
commenced, in order that his holy name might not become a reproach among
the heathen. Besides, we must not overlook the antithesis between the
*name of God* and the merits of men, because God, out of a regard to his
own glory, can find in us no cause wherefore he should be moved to save
us. The inestimable kindness of God, which, for the sake of a people so
perverse, altered the usual order of nature, is more illustriously
displayed by the account which is afterwards given of the means by which
they were preserved. When he says that the *sea was rebuked,* he extols
the power of God, at whose command and will the sea was dried up — the
waters receded, so that a free passage was opened up between the
opposite heaps of waters. With the design of magnifying the miracle, he
employs a similitude, which, in all likelihood, was drawn from Isaiah;
for in the sixty-third chapter and thirteenth verse, he says, “Thou hast
made thy people to walk through the deeps, as an horse in the
wilderness, that he might not stumble.” When the people walked through
the sea as upon a dry plain, the prophet informs us that this was done
solely by the astonishing power of God. It is quite possible, that in
the desert in which the people wandered, there was many an abyss, the
path rugged, and many a hill and dale and ragged rock. But it cannot be
doubted that the prophet extols the power of God in the passage through
the sea, and enhances it by this consideration, that the path through
that deep sea was smooth. Besides, he gives greater strength to the
miracle in saying that *their enemies were drowned;* because, when the
sea afforded a free passage to the children of Israel, and covered and
engulfed the Egyptians, so *that not one of them escaped alive,* whence
proceeded this instantaneous difference, but from this, that God made a
distinction between the one people and the other?

<span id="xv.iii"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p1"></span><span id="xv.iii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
106:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#012.md)<span
id="xv.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p2"></span>**12.** Then they believed his words; they
sang his praises. **13.** They made haste, and forgot his works; they
did not attend to his counsel; **14.** And lusted greatly in the desert,
and tempted God in the wilderness. **15.** And he gave them their
desire; but sent leanness into their soul.

<span id="xv.iii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xv.iii-p4"></span><span id="xv.iii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p5"></span>**12.** *Then they believed his words* In
stating that they believed God’s word, and sang his praise, the prophet
does not say this to their commendation, but rather to increase, in a
twofold manner, their guilt; because, being convinced by such
indubitable testimony, they yet instantly resumed their wonted
disposition of mind, and began to rebel against God, as if they had
never beheld his wonderful works. How very inexcusable was that impiety
which in a moment could forget the remarkable benefits which they had
been constrained to admit! Overpowered by the grandeur of God’s works,
they were, he says, in spite of themselves, compelled to believe in God,
and give glory to him, and thus the criminality of their rebellion was
increased; because, although their stubbornness was overcome, yet they
immediately relapsed into their former state of unbelief. A question,
however, arises, seeing that true faith always corresponds with the
nature of the word, and as the word is an incorruptible seed, so though
it may happen to be almost, it never can be totally destroyed. But there
is a temporary faith, as Mark calls it, (<span
id="xv.iii-p5.1"></span>[Mr 4:17](../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#017.md)<span
id="xv.iii-p5.1"></span>) which is not so much a fruit of the Spirit of
regeneration, as of a certain mutable affection, and so it soon passeth
away. It is not a voluntary faith which is here extolled by the prophet,
but rather that which is the result of compulsion, namely, because men,
whether they will or not, by a sense which they have of the power of
God, are constrained to show some reverence for him. This passage ought
to be well considered, that men, when once they have yielded submission
to God, may not deceive themselves, but may know that the touchstone of
faith is when they spontaneously receive the word of God, and constantly
continue firm in their obedience to it.

<span id="xv.iii-p6"></span><span id="xv.iii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p7"></span>In order to point out the inconstancy of the
people, he says, *they made haste* Some explain this in the following
manner, namely, that after they had set out on their journey, they
hastened to come to the place called Marah. This, however, is to give a
very tame representation of the emphatic style in which the prophet
speaks, when severely reprehending their hasty and headlong departure
from the way, in that they believed only for a very short time, and
speedily forgot God’s works; for they had only journeyed three days from
their passage through the sea till they came to Marah, and yet they
began to murmur against God, because they could not procure pleasant
waters.  <span id="fr_244"></span>[245](#fn_244.md) Meantime, we must here
observe what we have seen elsewhere, that the alone cause why men are so
ungrateful towards God, is their despising of his benefits. Were the
remembrance of these to take fast hold of our hearts, it would serve as
a bridle to keep us in his fear. The prophet declares what their
transgression was, namely, that they did not suspend their desires till
a fitting opportunity occurred for granting them. The insatiable nature
of our desires is astonishing, in that scarcely a single day is allowed
to God to gratify them. For should he not immediately satisfy them, we
at once become impatient, and are in danger of eventually falling into
despair. This, then, was the fault of the people, that they did not cast
all their cares upon God, did not calmly call upon him, nor wait
patiently until he was pleased to answer their requests, but rushed
forward with reckless precipitation, as if they would dictate to God
what he was to do. And, therefore, to heighten the criminality of their
rash course, he employs the term *counsel;* because men will neither
allow God to be possessed of wisdom, nor do they deem it proper to
depend upon his counsel, but are more provident than becomes them, and
would rather rule God than allow themselves to be ruled by him according
to his pleasure. That we may be preserved from provoking God, let us
ever retain this principle, That it is our duty to let him provide for
us such things as he knows will be for our advantage. And verily, faith
divesting us of our own wisdom, enables us hopefully and quietly to wait
until God accomplish his own work; whereas, on the contrary, our carnal
desire always goes before the counsel of God, by its too great haste.

<span id="xv.iii-p9"></span><span id="xv.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p10"></span>**14.** *And they lusted* He goes on,
according to the history, to mention the sin which, agreeably to the
duty of his office as a teacher, he had briefly noticed. Should any one
inquire in what way they did not attend to God’s counsel, he answers,
because they had indulged in the gratification of their lusts; for the
only way of acting with proper moderation is, when God rules and
presides over our affections. It is therefore the more necessary to
bridle that strong tendency to fleshly lusts which naturally rage within
us. For whoever allows himself to desire more than is needful, openly
sets himself in direct opposition to God, inasmuch as all fleshly lusts
are directly opposed to him.

<span id="xv.iii-p11"></span>*To tempt God* is not to acquiesce in his
will, but to desire more than he is willing to grant. And since there
are a variety of modes of tempting God, the prophet here adverts to one
mode of doing so, namely, that the people had been so presumptuous as to
limit God to means of their own devising; and thus, in rejecting the way
which they ought to have followed, they ascribed to God a property
altogether novel, as much as to say, If God do not feed us with flesh we
will not regard him as God. He gave them the food which ought to have
satisfied them. And though God is not limited by any means whatsoever,
yet it is his will that our minds be rendered subservient to the means
which he has appointed. For instance, although he can nourish us without
bread, nevertheless it is his will that our life be sustained by such
provision; and if we neglect it, and wish to point out to him another
way of nourishing us, we tempt his power.

<span id="xv.iii-p12"></span><span id="xv.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iii-p13"></span>**15.** *He gave them their desire* There
is a fine paronomasia in the word <span id="xv.iii-p13.1"></span>רזון,
*razon,* for if, instead of <span id="xv.iii-p13.2"></span>ז, *zain,* we
read <span id="xv.iii-p13.3"></span>ץ*, tsädhé,* the word would signify
*good pleasure.* The prophet, therefore, in allusion to their lusting,
by a word which is very similar to good pleasure or desire, says that
*God sent leanness into their souls;* meaning by that, that he had
indeed gratified the inordinate desires of the people, in such a way,
however, as that those who had loathed the manna, now received nothing
but leanness.  <span id="fr_245"></span>[246](#fn_245.md) Thus the prophet
would seem to charge the people with what we daily observe among those
who live luxuriously and are fastidious, especially when their stomach,
in consequence of the fluids poured into it, being vitiated, has no
relish for wholesome food. For such persons only relish that food which
is pernicious; and, therefore, the more they pamper themselves with it,
so much the more do they become the creatures of noxious habits; and
thus in a very short time, the very food itself makes them pine away.
The prophet, seems, therefore, to apply to the mind what he says about
the unhealthy state of the body, and to compare the Jews to those morbid
persons, whose voraciousness, instead of promoting health, injures it,
because they do not derive any nourishment from their food. The reason
is, that God withheld his blessing from the food which they had so
immoderately longed for, in order that this their punishment for their
transgression might humble them. But their perversity is seen to be very
great, in that even this mode of punishing them did not overcome their
stubborn hearts. It is a proverbial saying, that fools learn wisdom from
the experience of evil. How insane and incorrigible must they have been,
whom even compulsion itself could not reform!

and Aaron the saint of Jehovah. **17.** The earth opened and swallowed
up Dathan, and covered over the tent of Abiram. **18.** And a fire was
kindled in their assembly, and the flame consumed the wicked. **19.**
They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped before the molten image.
**20.** And they changed their glory into the likeness of an ox that
eateth grass. **21.** They forgot God their preserver, who had done
great things in Egypt; **22.** And wondrous works in the land of Ham,
and terrible things at the Red Sea.

<span id="xv.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="xv.iv-p4"></span><span id="xv.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p5"></span>**16.** *And they envied* He refers here very
shortly to another transgression, and that, too, in such a way as to
furnish both to himself and others ample grounds for deep consideration.
For, as the people, in devising from time to time new modes of sinning,
displayed so much cunning in their attempts to provoke God’s anger, so
we ought the more to be filled with fear on that account. Moreover, when
he says that they *envied Moses and Aaron,* his meaning is, that, acting
under the influence of diabolic pride, they had risen up against God,
and were endeavoring to throw off the yoke which he had laid upon them;
according as Moses also said,

<span id="xv.iv-p6"></span>“What am I, and what is Aaron, that ye murmur
against us?” (<span id="xv.iv-p6.1"></span>[Nu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#011)<span id="xv.iv-p6.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xv.iv-p7"></span>As it was the will of God to rule the people
by means of Moses and Aaron, not to submit to their rule was virtually
to set themselves obstinately to resist the authority of God himself.
There is therefore great importance attached to the term, *envy,*
namely, that at the very time when God was treating the children of
Israel with the utmost kindness and care, they yet were discontented
with their lot, and rebelled against him. Could such madness serve any
other purpose than to show, that, casting off all farther dependence
upon the providence of God for their support, they aspire to rise above
the very heavens? In this sense Aaron is called *the saint of Jehovah,*
 <span id="fr_246"></span>[247](#fn_246.md) in order that we might know
that both he and Moses were equally identified with God; for under the
person of the one, the designation is applied to both, and in this way
the prophet shows that they had been Divinely invested with that
authority which they were exercising. In renouncing their authority,
therefore, and, to the utmost of their power, dishonoring these saints,
Dathan and Abiram were rebelling not against men, but against God.

<span id="xv.iv-p9"></span><span id="xv.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p10"></span>**17** *The earth opened* The heinousness of
their sin may be seen in the magnitude of the punishment by which it was
visited. But the design of the prophet was to accuse and reprove
publicly the obstinacy of the people, who, so far from being bettered by
their corrections, (although the vengeance of God was so terrible as
almost to move the very stones,) conducted themselves the more
perversely. That was surely an awfully ominous event, when *the earth
swallowed up alive Dathan and Abiram,* and all their accomplices; and
when fire coming down from heaven consumed  <span
id="fr_247"></span>[248](#fn_247.md) them, according to the saying of
Moses,

<span id="xv.iv-p12"></span>“If any thing common happen to these men,
then believe not that God who ruleth in heaven rules over you and me;
but if this new and extraordinary thing happen, namely, that the earth
open her mouth and swallow them up, then indeed believe that I am sent
by God,” <span id="xv.iv-p12.1"></span>[Nu
16:29](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#029.md)<span id="xv.iv-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p13"></span>When the Israelites were so infatuated as to
rise in rebellion against God, then did the terrible nature of their
distemper appear in that it could not be cured by the stringent remedy
which was applied to it. And as even hypocrites are afraid when they
feel the severity of God, it was the height of folly in them to fret and
quarrel with God where he was visiting their iniquities with stripes.
Should any one ask why God charges the faults of a few upon the whole
body of the people? the answer is obvious; for although there were only
two individuals who were the principal abettors of the conspiracy, and
along with them two hundred and seventy seditious persons, yet it would
seem, from the murmurings and cavillings of the whole congregation, that
they also were affected with the same distemper. The punishment did not
extend beyond the captains  <span id="fr_248"></span>[249](#fn_248.md) and
ringleaders of this wicked conspiracy, it being the design of God to
mitigate it, and to spare the people at large, who nevertheless had been
most desirous of innovation, seeing they could not endure the authority
of Moses and Aaron.

<span id="xv.iv-p15"></span><span id="xv.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p16"></span>**19.** *They made a calf.*  <span
id="fr_249"></span>[250](#fn_249.md) Here he represents their rebellion as
exceedingly base, in that they abandoned the true worship of God, and
made to themselves a calf. For although it was their intention to
worship God in this manner, yet the prophet reprehends their brutal
stupidity, because *they worshipped before the molten image,*  <span
id="fr_250"></span>[251](#fn_250.md) and represented God *by the figure of
an ox which eateth grass*  <span id="fr_251"></span>[252](#fn_251.md) From
this the prophet infers, that God had been robbed of his honor, and that
all his glory had been tarnished. And surely it is so; for although the
idolaters feign to serve God with great zeal, yet when, at the same
time, they represent to themselves a God visible, they abandon the true
God, and impiously make for themselves an idol. But he reproaches them
with being guilty of still greater impiety, when he says, *after the
likeness of an ox that eateth grass;* and contrasts with it *their honor
or glory.* For seeing that God had clothed them with his own glory, what
madness was it to substitute in place of him not only an ox, but the
inanimate form of an ox, as if there were any resemblance between God
who createth all kinds of food, and that stupid animal which feeds upon
grass?

<span id="xv.iv-p20"></span>It is necessary, however, to observe the
design of the prophet, which is to point out the blindness of men as
more base and abominable, because not contenting themselves with any
common form of superstition, but casting off all sham they give
themselves up to the most shocking forms of worshipping God. Had the
people formed for themselves a likeness of God under the likeness of a
man, even that would have been impiously robbing God of his due; how
much more shameful was their conduct when they assimilated God to an ox?
When men preserve their life by eating and drinking, they acknowledge
how frail they are, because they derive  <span
id="fr_252"></span>[253](#fn_252.md) from dead creatures the means of its
continuation. How much greater is the dishonor done to God when he is
compared to the brutal tribes? Moreover, the comparison referred to
increases the enormity of their guilt. For what credit was it for a holy
people to worship the inanimate likeness of an ox instead of the true
God? But God had condescended to spread out the overshadowing wings of
his glory upon the children of Abraham, that he might put on them the
highest honor. Therefore, in denuding themselves of this honor, they had
exposed their own baseness to the derision of all the nations of the
earth. And hence Moses employs the phrase of *nakedness,* when he is
showing that crime of idolatry:

<span id="xv.iv-p22"></span>“And when Moses saw that the people were
naked, (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their
enemies)”  
<span id="xv.iv-p22.2"></span>[Ex
32:25](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#025.md)<span id="xv.iv-p22.2"></span>.

<span id="xv.iv-p23"></span>Should any one be disposed to say that the
ark of the covenant was a representation of God, my answer is, That that
symbol was given to the children of Israel, not to engross the whole of
their attention, but only for the purpose of assisting and directing
them in the spiritual worship of God.

<span id="xv.iv-p24"></span><span id="xv.iv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xv.iv-p25"></span>**21.** *They forgot God* The prophet again
repeats that the people had sinned not simply through ignorance, but
also wilfully, inasmuch as God had already given a very palpable
manifestation of his power and glory. And as he makes himself known in
the creation of the heavens and of the earth, the blindness of men is
totally inexcusable. But far more aggravating is the sin of the children
of Israel, who, after God had made himself known to them, in the most
condescending manner, cast him off altogether, and gave themselves up to
the practice of brutish idolatry. And God having from heaven put forth
his Almighty power for their salvation, there must surely be no little
importance attached to such displays of his power as proclaim the praise
and honor of his great name. Had he merely given an ordinary token of
his power, even that ought to have attracted so much consideration as
should have kept the people in the fear and worship of God. Now, that
these miracles were so very notable, or rather terrible and rare, the
people acted a very base part to shut their eyes upon them, and give
themselves over to idolatry. For as the darkness is dispelled by the
beamy lustre of the sun, so all inventions and perverse errors should
vanish before such knowledge of God.

<span id="xv.v"></span>

<span id="xv.v-p1"></span><span id="xv.v-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
106:23-27](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#023.md)<span id="xv.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.v-p2"></span>**23.** And he said that he would destroy
them, unless that Moses his chosen had stood in the breach before his
face, to turn away his wrath, that he might not destroy them. **24.**
And they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his word;
**25.** And they murmured in their tents, and did not listen to the
voice of Jehovah. **26.** And he lifted up his hand against them, to
destroy them in the desert: **27.** And to destroy their seed among the
heathen, and to scatter them throughout the lands.  <span
id="fr_253"></span>[254](#fn_253.md)

<span id="xv.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="xv.v-p5"></span><span id="xv.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xv.v-p6"></span>**23.** *And he said* The prophet informs us,
by these words, that the people had a feeling sense of their remarkable
deliverance from impending destruction, by means of prayer alone, which,
for a season, restrained God’s vengeance from bursting forth against
them. In a very short time, however, they return to their wonted
disposition of mind, a striking proof of the awful perversity of their
hearts. To represent how highly God was offended, the prophet says that
he had purposed to destroy the transgressors: not that God is subject to
human passions, to be very angry for a little, and then immediately
afterwards, on being appeased, changes his purpose; for God, in his
secret counsel, had resolved upon their forgiveness, even as he actually
did pardon them. But the prophet makes mention of another purpose, by
which God designed to strike the people with terror, that coming to know
and acknowledge the greatness of their sin, they might be humbled on
account of it. This is that repentance so frequently referred to in the
Scriptures. Not that God is mutable in himself; but he speaks after the
manner of *men,* that we may be affected with a more feeling sense of
his wrath: like a king who had resolved to pardon an offender, yet
sisted him before his judgment-seat, the more effectually to impress him
with the magnitude of the kindness done to him. God, therefore, while he
keeps to himself his secret purpose, declared openly to the people that
they had committed a trespass which deserved to be punished with eternal
death. Next he says that *Moses stood in the breach,* meaning that he
had made intercession with God, lest his awful vengeance might break
forth among the people. There is here an allusion to the manner in which
cities are stormed; for if a breach is made in the wall by any of the
various engines which are employed in war, brave soldiers will instantly
throw themselves into the breach to defend it.  <span
id="fr_254"></span>[255](#fn_254.md) Hence Ezekiel reproaches the false
prophets, who, unlike Moses, deceiving the people by their flatteries,
making, as it were, a mud-wall, do not place themselves in the breach in
the day of battle.

<span id="xv.v-p8"></span>“Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither
made up the hedge for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the
day of the Lord,” <span id="xv.v-p8.1"></span>[Eze
13:5](../../../bib/kjv/eze013.htm#005.md)<span id="xv.v-p8.1"></span>.

<span id="xv.v-p9"></span>Some expositors are of opinion that the
prophet refers to the separation which the people had made among
themselves in violating the covenant of God, and the sacred relation in
which they stood to each other; but the meaning is the same. For in that
breach which gave rise to this metaphor or similitude, God, in defending
his people so faithfully, was to them in place of a wall or bulwark.
Having provoked him to anger anew, he was about to rush upon them for
their destruction, had not Moses interposed as their intercessor.

<span id="xv.v-p10"></span><span id="xv.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xv.v-p11"></span>**24.** *And they despised* It was an evident
demonstration of the unconquerable wickedness of the Jews, that, after
they had been in the jaws of destruction, and while they had scarcely
escaped from danger so great and so imminent, they rose up in rebellion
against God. What was the cause of this rebellion? The despising of the
Holy Land, which of all things ought to have been most desired by them.
The country of Canaan, which had been destined to them, as the place
where they were to be brought up under God’s paternal care, and as a
people separated from heathen nations were to worship him only, and
which, also, was more especially to them a pledge of the heavenly
inheritance, — this country here, and in several other passages, is very
properly called the *pleasant land* Was it not, then, the basest
ingratitude to despise the holy habitation of God’s chosen people? To
the cause of this scorn the prophet refers, when he says, *they did not
believe God’s word* For had they laid hold upon God’s promise with that
faith which it was incumbent upon them to do, they would have been
inflamed with such a strong desire for that land, that they would have
surmounted all obstacles which might occur in their way to it.
Meanwhile, not believing his word, they not only refuse the heritage
which was offered to them, but excite a rebellion in the camp, as if
they would rise up in arms against God.

<span id="xv.v-p12"></span><span id="xv.v-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xv.v-p13"></span>**26.** *And he lifted up.* He describes
another example of the vengeance of God, the recollection of which ought
to have been deeply seated in their hearts, so that cherishing a
constant fear of him, they might watch over themselves with the utmost
solicitude. No good having ensued from all this, it is obvious that the
madness of that people was incurable. At that time God did restrain his
anger, in that he did not disperse their offspring throughout various
parts of the earth; but his threatening of itself ought to have sufficed
for the subduing of their pride, had they not been incorrigible. *To
lift up the hand* is in this passage susceptible of two meanings. In
Scripture God is frequently said to lift up his hand to inflict
punishment. But as it is generally admitted that the prophet is here
speaking of swearing,  <span id="fr_255"></span>[256](#fn_255.md) with this
opinion I most readily coincide. The practice of lifting up the hand, as
if they would have called God down from heaven, was a solemn usual rite
among them, accompanying an oath; and is therefore improperly applied to
God, whose sublimity rises above all things, and who, as the apostle
says, cannot swear by a greater than himself, (<span
id="xv.v-p14.3"></span>[Heb 6:13](../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#013.md)<span
id="xv.v-p14.3"></span>) In employing it, therefore, it must be
understood that he borrows it from the common customs which prevail
among men. Had not the Holy Land been preserved to the people by the
prayers of Moses, awful indeed would their dispersion have been.

<span id="xv.vi"></span>

<span id="xv.vi-p1"></span><span id="xv.vi-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
106:28-31](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#028.md)<span id="xv.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vi-p2"></span>**28.** And they joined themselves to
Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. **29.** And they provoked
God to anger by their works,  <span id="fr_256"></span>[257](#fn_256.md)
and the plague broke out among them. **30.** And Phinehas stood up, and
executed justice: and the plague was stopped. **31.** And that deed was
imputed to him for righteousness from generation to generation for ever.

<span id="xv.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xv.vi-p5"></span><span id="xv.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vi-p6"></span>**28** *And they joined themselves to
Baal-peor* The prophet tells us that the Jews, after they had been
threatened with very awful punishment, very soon fell into a new species
of apostasy. Some think, that they are indirectly accused of falling
away to the superstitions of the Midianites, in consequence of having
been imposed upon by female intrigue. This, it is well known, was the
design of Balaam, as soon as he knew that he was forbidden by God to
curse the people. His counsel to king Balak was to set the daughters of
Moab before the people, to entice them by their allurements to the
practice of idolatry,

<span id="xv.vi-p7"></span>“Behold, these women caused the children of
Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the
Lord in the matter of Peor.” <span id="xv.vi-p7.1"></span>[Nu
31:16](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#016.md)<span id="xv.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vi-p8"></span>And as the idolatry here mentioned originated
from carnal intrigues, some expositors are of opinion, that on this
account the prophet charges the people with the commission of a twofold
trespass, in their not only being inveigled by the Midianitish women,
but also in binding themselves by another bond to Baal-peor, (<span
id="xv.vi-p8.1"></span>[Numbers
25](../../../bib/kjv/num025.htm#000)<span id="xv.vi-p8.1"></span>.md) Be
that as it may, the prophet exclaims against the perfidy of his own
nation, because in forsaking the true worship of God, they had broken
that holy union by which they had been betrothed to him. For we know,
that as God adopts the Church as his spouse, when she gives herself up
to idolatry, she no less shamefully violates her fidelity, than when a
wife leaves her husband, and becomes an adulteress. It is well known,
that Baal-peor was the idol of the Midianites; but it is not so well
known how he received this appellation. The word <span
id="xv.vi-p8.2"></span>בעל, *Baal,* has a signification  <span
id="fr_257"></span>[258](#fn_257.md) equivalent to *lord, master,* or
*patron.* And since <span id="xv.vi-p9.2"></span>פער*, paar,* signifies
*to open,* some render it *the God of opening,* and assign as a reason,
which, however, I dare not affirm, their shamefully exposing themselves
in his presence. Perhaps it is the name of some place, for we know that
the heathens often gave to their idols the names of the countries where
they were worshipped.  <span id="fr_258"></span>[259](#fn_258.md) We now
perceive the prophet’s meaning, That the Jews had wickedly revolted from
God, and defiled themselves in joining themselves to Baal-peor. In
saying that they *ate the sacrifices of the dead,*  <span
id="fr_259"></span>[260](#fn_259.md) he points out the greater baseness of
their offense. By the sacrifices of idols, he means that they ate things
that were offered to idols, as they had been wont to partake of those
sacrifices which bound them to the true God, the inexhaustible fountain
of life. Hence their conduct was the more detestable, when they wilfully
gave themselves over to death by perpetrating such a heinous crime. And
we know, that banqueting was to some extent connected with their
worship. The result of this was, that, renouncing the true God, they
joined themselves in marriage with the dead; and thus the prophet
charges them with acting a very disgraceful part, in not only bowing the
knee to Baal, and offering sacrifices to him, but also in feasting upon
these sacrifices.

<span id="xv.vi-p12"></span><span id="xv.vi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vi-p13"></span>**29.** *And they provoked God to anger.*
The prophet once more informs us, that they had been put upon their
guard by another plague, in order that it might appear that God had
always a strict regard for his own glory, in chastising the people; but
as they were not bettered by these plagues, these chastisements were
fruitless. Having formerly stated, that God’s wrath had been appeased by
the prayers of Moses, he now says, that the plague had been arrested or
ceased by means of the kind interposition of Phinehas. Some render the
word <span id="xv.vi-p13.2"></span>פלל*, pillel, to pray;* but the other
rendering, to *execute justice,* is more in accordance with the context;
namely, that by his zeal in executing justice upon the profligates, he
turned away God’s vengeance from the Israelites. *He stood up*
therefore, that is, he rose up or interposed, when all others maintained
a careless indifference. As the Jews were sensible that it was by the
kind intervention of one man that the plague was now healed, their
obstinacy was the less excusable in not even then ceasing to sin. We
must not forget that all these things are addressed to us. For when God
from time to time chastises us, and calls upon us to repent by setting
before us the example of others, how few profit by his corrections!
Moreover, it deserves to be noticed, that the plague ceased at the very
time when Phinehas executed justice. From this we may learn, that the
most effectual way to quench the fire of God’s anger, is when the sinner
willingly sits in judgment upon himself for the punishment of his own
transgressions; as Paul says, <span id="xv.vi-p13.3"></span>[1Co
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#031.md)<span id="xv.vi-p13.3"></span>,

<span id="xv.vi-p14"></span>“If we would judge ourselves, verily we
would not be judged of the Lord.”

<span id="xv.vi-p15"></span>And surely God confers no small honor upon
us, in placing the punishment of our sins within our reach. At the same
time, it must be observed, that on that occasion the plague ceased in
consequence of the punishment of a single person, because the people
then shrunk from the abominable wickedness to which they had been
addicted.

<span id="xv.vi-p16"></span><span id="xv.vi-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vi-p17"></span>**31.** *And that deed was imputed* The
prophet, in thus praising one individual, heaps reproach upon the whole
body of the people. For we infer from this token of approbation with
which the Holy Spirit condescended to stamp the excellent action of
Phinehas, how very base their conduct must have been. Neither was this
honor reserved for him alone, but his posterity were to enjoy it
throughout their succeeding generations. In order, therefore, to cast
the greater reproach upon the people, Phinehas alone is contrasted with
them. Some may be disposed to inquire, how the zeal of a single
individual, overstepping the boundaries  <span
id="fr_260"></span>[261](#fn_260.md) of his calling, taking a sword and
executing justice, could be approved of God? For it would seem, as if he
had ventured upon this action without due consideration. I answer, that
the saints have sometimes been under peculiar and extraordinary
impulses, which ought not to be estimated by the ordinary standard of
actions. When Moses slew the Egyptian, (<span
id="xv.vi-p18.2"></span>[Ex 2:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#012.md)<span
id="xv.vi-p18.2"></span>) though not yet called by God to be the
deliverer of Israel, and while he was not yet invested with the power of
the sword, it is certain, that he was moved by the invisible and
internal impulse of God to undertake that deed. Phinehas was moved by a
similar impulse. No one indeed imagined that he was armed with the sword
of God, yet he was conscious to himself of being moved by a heavenly
influence in this matter. And hence it is to be observed, that the
common mode and order of calling which God adopts, does not prevent him,
whenever it seems proper, to stir up his elect by the secret influence
of the Spirit to the performance of praiseworthy deeds.

<span id="xv.vi-p19"></span>But a more difficult question still remains,
How that one action could be imputed to Phinehas for righteousness?
 <span id="fr_261"></span>[262](#fn_261.md) Paul proves that men are
justified by faith alone, because it is written,

<span id="xv.vi-p21"></span>“Abraham believed God, and it was counted
unto him for righteousness,” <span id="xv.vi-p21.1"></span>[Ro
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#003.md)<span id="xv.vi-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vi-p22"></span>In <span id="xv.vi-p22.1"></span>[Ge
15:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#006.md)<span id="xv.vi-p22.1"></span>,
Moses employs the same word. If the same thing may be said respecting
works, the reasoning of Paul will be not only feeble, but frivolous.
First of all, let us examine, whether or not Phinehas was justified on
account of this deed alone. Verily the law, though it could justify, by
no means promises salvation to any one work, but makes justification to
consist in the perfect observance of all the commandments. It remains,
therefore, that we affirm, that the work of Phinehas was imputed to him
for righteousness, in the same way as God imputes the works of the
faithful to them for righteousness, not in consequence of any intrinsic
merit which they possess, but of his own free and unmerited grace. And
as it thus appears, that the perfect observance of the law alone (which
is done no where) constitutes righteousness, all men must prostrate
themselves with confusion of face before God’s judgment-seat. Besides,
were our works strictly examined, they would be found to be mingled with
much imperfection. We have, therefore, no other source than to flee for
refuge to the free unmerited mercy of God. And not only do we receive
righteousness by grace through faith, but as the moon borrows her light
from the sun, so does the same faith render our works righteous, because
our corruptions being mortified, they are reckoned to us for
righteousness. In short, faith alone, and not human merit, procures both
for persons and for works the character of righteousness. I now return
to Paul. And it is not from a single expression, that he argues that we
are justified freely, and by faith only, but he assumes higher
principles, to which I lately referred, that all men are destitute of
righteousness, until God reconcile them to himself by the blood of
Christ; and that faith is the means by which pardon and reconciliation
are obtained, because justification by works is no where to be obtained.
Hence he very properly concludes, that we are justified by faith alone.
But righteousness by works is as it were subordinate (as they say) to
the righteousness just mentioned, while works possess no value in
themselves, excepting, and as far as, out of pure benevolence, God
imputes them to us for righteousness.

<span id="xv.vii-p8"></span><span id="xv.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vii-p9"></span>**32** *And they provoked him* The prophet
mentions another offense of which they were guilty, in that, they
contended with God at the waters of strife, from which circumstance that
place derived its name. The clamor was, it is true, raised directly
against Moses, but if we examine the matter properly, we will find that
they virtually murmured against God himself. And to point out the
aggravation of their offense, he says that Moses was hardly dealt with
on their account. From this it may be inferred that their transgression
was very heinous, in that God did not spare even his own servant, whom
he had chosen in preference to all others. We do not deny that Moses
deserved that punishment; but if we search for the origin of the
trespass, we will find that it was the sin of the people that was
visited upon him. If Moses was prevented from entering the land of
Canaan, because through the influence of the sin of others, and in
opposition to the convictions of his own mind, he had been hurried on to
the commission of iniquity, how much more inexcusable is the impiety of
that people who deliberately strove with God, and by their folly and
fretfulness, brought in Moses for a share of their guilt?

<span id="xv.vii-p10"></span><span id="xv.vii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vii-p11"></span>**33.** *For they grieved his spirit* The
verb <span id="xv.vii-p11.1"></span>מרה, *marah,* properly signifies *to
vex* or *irritate,* but as it is here put in what the Hebrews call the
Hiphil conjugation, some are of opinion that it is to be understood
passively, to denote that it was the people who were the occasion of the
rebellion; which interpretation does not appear to me to be very
objectionable. I cannot, however, agree with those who would have the
particle <span id="xv.vii-p11.2"></span>את, *eth,* to be a sign of what
is denominated the dative case, as if Moses might be said to have
rebelled against the Spirit of God. Had he done so, then assuredly the
prophet would not have spoken so severely of the sin and folly into
which he had inadvertently fallen. The meaning which I have already
given answers very well, That the prime movers of the rebellion must
have committed a very heinous offense, seeing that Moses, who had been
pushed on by the impetuosity of the people to sin, was so severely dealt
with by God. But while the prophet informs us that Moses was punished on
the people’s account, he is not to be understood as saying that he was
altogether blameless. For even admitting that his spirit was ruffled in
consequence of the tumult of the people, this ought to have made him the
more careful to continue steadfast in his adherence to the Law of God.
He adds, that *he spoke with his lips;* and this I take to refer to
Moses, there being no ground for the conjecture that it refers to the
punishment which God expressly denounced against Moses. It is more
likely that these words were intended by the prophet to express how
greatly the spirit of Moses was agitated when he openly murmured against
God. The prophet, therefore, informs us that the submissive and gentle
spirit of Moses was fanned, as it were, into a breeze by the
perverseness of the people, so that even he spake un-advisedly, saying,
“Can God give you water out of the rock?” (<span
id="xv.vii-p11.3"></span>[Nu
20:10](../../../bib/kjv/num020.htm#010)<span id="xv.vii-p11.3"></span>.md)
For such was the indignation which he felt burning within him, that he
could not calmly wait for the commandment of God to smite the rock.

<span id="xv.vii-p12"></span><span id="xv.vii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vii-p13"></span>**34.** *They did not destroy the nations*
It appears to me that those persons are mistaken who think that the
prophet is here simply giving a relation of the punishment which was
inflicted upon the Jews, as if he were imputing to them the entire blame
of not exterminating the nations, in consequence of their not deserving
the honor of obtaining any more victories over them. But he rather
prefers another charge against them, that they had been remiss in
driving out the heathen, or more probably that they had not obeyed the
Divine command to root them out of the land. Now that the cup of the
iniquity of the Amorites was full, it was the purpose of God that they
should be exterminated, lest their society might prove injurious to the
holy people. For God, having chosen that land for a habitation to
himself, intended that it should be holy and purified from all
defilement. In refusing, therefore, to execute the vengeance enjoined
upon them, the people showed their willingness to associate with the
uncircumcised inhabitants of Canaan. In manifesting such indifference
about God’s command respecting the driving out these nations, they gave
just cause for his anger waxing hot against them. Behold, saith he, I
have commanded all these nations to be cut off by the sword; and now,
because ye have not obeyed my voice,

<span id="xv.vii-p14"></span>“they shall be pricks in your eyes, and
thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell,”
<span id="xv.vii-p14.1"></span>[Nu
33:55](../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#055.md)<span id="xv.vii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vii-p15"></span>The not destroying all these nations, but
permitting some of them to remain, might appear to be an act of mercy;
but in thus acting, the people were guilty of neglecting to execute
God’s righteous vengeance upon them, and of leaving the land liable to
be polluted with their abominations. From these things it ought to be
noticed, that there are two extremes in which men are apt to indulge,
either in being unnecessarily over rigorous, or in defeating the ends of
justice by too great lenity. We must, therefore, adhere strictly to
God’s command, if we would desire to shun both extremes. For if the
Israelites are condemned for sparing some of these nations wholly, what
are we to think of those judges who, from a timid and apathetic
attention to the responsible duties of their office, exercise too much
lenity to a few persons, thus weakening the restraints of the inlets to
vice, to the great detriment of the public weal?

<span id="xv.vii-p16"></span><span id="xv.vii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vii-p17"></span>**35** *But were mingled* He describes what
was the result of this foolish humanity; namely, that they were defiled
with the pollutions of the nations whom they had spared. Had they
exclusively inhabited the land of Canaan, they would have more easily
retained the pure worship of God. Allured by the influence of such
neighbors, it is not wonderful that they soon degenerated from the
footsteps of their fathers, for we are more inclined to follow the
example of the bad than of the good. And now he speaks of the
descendants of those who had so frequently provoked God’s anger in the
wilderness, and declares, that as the same unbelief, rebellion, and
ingratitude, were rampant in the succeeding race, they were no better
than their fathers.

<span id="xv.vii-p18"></span>In mingling with the heathens they openly
rejected the distinguishing loving-kindness of God, who adopted them as
his children, under the express condition that they should be separated
from these profane nations. Therefore, in associating with them
indiscriminately, they render this holy covenant of no effect. When he
adds, *that they learned their works,* he warns us, that nothing is more
dangerous than associating with the ungodly; because, being more prone
to follow vice than virtue, it cannot but be, that the more conversant
we are with corruption, the more widely will it spread. In such
circumstances, the utmost care and caution are requisite, lest the
wicked, with whom we come into contact, infect us by their vitiated
morals; and particularly where there is danger of relapsing into
idolatry, to which we are all naturally prone. What, then, will be the
effect produced upon us when instigated by others to commit sin, but to
add sin to sin?  <span id="fr_266"></span>[267](#fn_266.md) The prophet,
therefore, declares that the Jews were already so much under the tuition
of the heathen as to abandon themselves to the practice of their
idolatrous rites. In employing the word *to serve,* he confutes the
contemptible evasion of the Papists, who pretend that they do not give
to images the worship that is due to God alone, but only a sort of
honorary adoration.  <span id="fr_267"></span>[268](#fn_267.md) But if the
worshipping of images be lawful, the prophet had no sufficient cause to
condemn his own nation for serving strange gods. Despicable, therefore,
is the distinction, that Divine homage is to be paid to God alone, and
that a kind of honorary adoration is to be given to images. He adds,
that this *issued in their overthrow,* in order that their obstinate
attachment to their follies, and their despising the chastisements of
God, may more palpably appear.

<span id="xv.vii-p21"></span><span id="xv.vii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vii-p22"></span>**37.** *And they sacrificed* The prophet
here mentions one species of superstition which demonstrates the awful
blindness of the people; their not hesitating to sacrifice their sons
and daughters to devils.  <span id="fr_268"></span>[269](#fn_268.md) In
applying such an abominable designation to the sin of the people, he
means to exhibit it in more hateful colors. From this we learn that
inconsiderate zeal is a flimsy pretext in favor of any act of devotion.
For by how much the Jews were under the influence of burning zeal, by so
much does the prophet convict them with being guilty of greater
wickedness; because their madness carried them away to such a pitch of
enthusiasm, that they did not spare even their own offspring. Were good
intentions meritorious, as idolaters suppose, then indeed the laying
aside of all natural affection in sacrificing their own children was a
deed deserving of the highest praise. But when men act under the impulse
of their own capricious humor, the more they occupy themselves with acts
of external worship, the more do they increase their guilt. For what
difference was there between Abraham and those persons of whom the
prophet makes mention, but that the former, under the influence of
faith, was ready to offer up his son, while the latter, carried away by
the impulse of intemperate zeal, cast off all natural affection, and
imbrued their hands in the blood of their own offspring.

<span id="xv.vii-p24"></span><span id="xv.vii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vii-p25"></span>**38.** *And they shed* He inveighs with
still greater indignation against that religious phrensy which led them
to sacrifice their own children, and thus to pollute the land by the
shedding of innocent blood. Should any one object that Abraham is
praised, because he did not withhold his only son, the answer is plain,
That he did it in obedience to God’s command, so that every vestige of
inhumanity was effaced by means of the purity of faith. For if obedience
is better than sacrifice, (<span id="xv.vii-p25.1"></span>[1Sa
15:22](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022)<span id="xv.vii-p25.1"></span>.md)
it is the best rule both for morality and religion. It is an awful
manifestation of God’s vindictive wrath, when the superstitious
heathens, left to their own inventions, become hardened in deeds of
horrid cruelty. As often as the martyrs put their life in jeopardy in
defense of the truth, the incense of such a sacrifice is pleasing to
God. But when the two Romans, by name Decii,  <span
id="fr_269"></span>[270](#fn_269.md) in an execrable manner devoted
themselves unto death, that was an act of atrocious impiety. It is not
without just cause, therefore, that the prophet enhances the guilt of
the people by this consideration, that to the perverse mode of
worshipping God, they had added excessive cruelty. Nor is there less
cause for charging them with having polluted that land out of which God
had commanded them to expel the ancient inhabitants, in order that he
might render it the peculiar scene where he was to be worshipped. The
Israelites then were doubly wicked, who, by not only defiling the land
with their idolatry, but also by cruelly butchering their children,
robbed God of his due, and in a manner frustrated his designs.

<span id="xv.vii-p27"></span><span id="xv.vii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xv.vii-p28"></span>**39** *And they were polluted with their
own works* He now concludes by stating generally, that the Jews, in
adopting the abominable practices of the heathen, were become wholly
filthy; because in all the devices of men there is nothing else than
impurity. He denominates as the *works of men* all the false worship
which they devise without the Divine sanction; as if he should say, that
the holiness, which is truly connected with the worship of God, comes
from his word, and that all human inventions and admixtures in religion
are profane, and tend to corrupt the service of God. Doubtless it was
the intention of the Israelites to serve God, but the Holy Spirit
declares that all the fruit of their burning zeal was their becoming
more abominable in God’s sight by their lewd inventions. For a strict
adherence to the word of God constitutes spiritual chastity.

<span id="xv.viii"></span>

<span id="xv.viii-p1"></span><span id="xv.viii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
106:40-46](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#040.md)<span
id="xv.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.viii-p2"></span>**40.** And the wrath of Jehovah waxed hot
against his people, and he abhorred his own inheritance: **41.** And he
delivered them into the hands of the heathen; and their enemies ruled
over them. **42.** And their adversaries subdued them, and they were
afflicted under their hand. **43.** Many times he delivered them; and
they provoked him with their counsel, and were oppressed by their
iniquity. **44.** And he saw when they were in straits, in that he heard
their cry: **45.** And he remembered his covenant towards them, and it
repented him according to the greatness of his mercies. **46.** And he
made them to find pity from those who had carried them away captive.

<span id="xv.viii-p3"></span> 

<span id="xv.viii-p4"></span><span id="xv.viii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xv.viii-p5"></span>**40.** *And the wrath of Jehovah waxed
hot.* The severity of the punishment inflicted upon the people confirms
the truth of what we formerly said, that they had been guilty of no
trivial offense, in presuming to corrupt the worship of God. And they
themselves showed how hopeless their reformation was, in that all this
as yet failed to bring them truly to repent of their sin. That the
people, who were God’s sacred and chosen heritage, were delivered up to
the abominations of the heathen, who themselves were the slaves of the
devil, was an awful manifestation of his vindictive wrath. Then, at
least, ought they to have held in abhorrence their own wickedness, by
which they had been precipitated into such direful calamities. In
saying, *that they were subdued and afflicted by their enemies,* the
prophet points out, in a still more astonishing manner, the baseness of
their conduct. Reduced to a state of bondage and oppression, their folly
appears the more disgraceful, in that they were not truly and heartily
humbled under God’s almighty hand. For prior to this, they had been
warned by Moses, that they had not casually fallen into that bondage so
galling to them, neither had it happened by the valor of their enemies,
but because they were given over, and, as it were, sold to it by God
himself. That those who had refused to bear his yoke, should be
delivered up to tyrants to harass and oppress them, and that those who
would not endure to be ruled by God’s paternal sway, should be subdued
by their enemies, to be trodden under their feet, is a striking example
of God’s retributive justice.

<span id="xv.viii-p6"></span><span id="xv.viii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xv.viii-p7"></span>**43.** *Many times.* As the wicked
perversity of the people was manifested in that God’s severe
chastisements failed to produce their reformation, so now, on the other
hand, the prophet deduces the detestable hardness of their hearts from
the fact, that all the benefits which they had received from God could
not bend them into obedience. They did, indeed, in the time of their
afflictions, groan under the burden of them; but when God not only
mitigated their punishment, but also granted them wonderful
deliverances, can their subsequent backsliding be excused? It becomes us
to bear in mind, that here, as in a glass, we have a picture of the
nature of all mankind; for let God but adopt those very means which he
employed in relation to the Israelites, in order to reclaim the majority
of the sons of men, how comparatively few are there who will not be
found continuing in the very same state as they were? And if he either
humble us by the severity of his rod, or melt us by his kindness, the
effect is only temporary; because, though he visit us with correction
upon correction, and heap kindness upon kindness, yet we very soon
relapse into our wonted vicious practices. As for the Jews, their
insensate stupidity was insufferable, in that, notwithstanding the many
and magnificent deliverances which God wrought out for them, they did
not cease from their backslidings. For the Psalmist says, that they,
*nevertheless, provoked God with their wicked inventions* Then he
declares that they received a just recompense of reward in being
oppressed by their iniquity. Moreover, he informs us, that though they
were most deserving of all their afflictions, yet their groanings were
heard; whence we learn, that God, in his unwearied kindness, did not
cease to strive with them on account of their perverseness of spirit.

<span id="xv.viii-p8"></span>For what pity was this, to hear the cry of
those who turned a deaf ear to his wise instructions, and were
regardless of all his warnings and threatenings? And yet after all this
forbearance and long-suffering, their exceedingly depraved hearts
remained unchanged.

<span id="xv.viii-p9"></span><span id="xv.viii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xv.viii-p10"></span>**45.** *And he remembered* God’s being
mindful of his covenant is here assigned as the cause of his great mercy
and long-suffering. In that covenant, he not only declares that there is
a gracious pardon for transgressions, but he also adverts to the
perverse blindness of those who were not brought back by such remedies
to the covenant, in which they were well aware that their safety was
placed. But above all, he charges them with ingratitude; because, when
deserving to perish, they did not acknowledge that they were indebted to
the mercy of God alone for their preservation. This observation is
strengthened by the next clause of the verse, in which he says that God
had spared them *according to the greatness of his mercies* For the
greatness of the punishment which their sins deserved, may be inferred
from the great treasures of his loving-kindness, which God had to open
in order to procure their redemption. The word to *repent* expresses no
change in God, but only in the mode of administering his corrections. It
may seem as if God altered his purpose, when he mitigates punishment, or
withdraws his hand from executing his judgments. The Scripture, however,
accommodating itself to our weak and limited capacity, speaks only after
the manner of men.

<span id="xv.viii-p11"></span><span id="xv.viii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xv.viii-p12"></span>**46.** *And he made them to find pity* As
he had above said, that the Jews had been delivered into the hands of
their enemies, because God’s anger was, as it were, arms to their
adversaries to subdue them; so now he says, that the same God had
softened the hearts of these very enemies, who, by terrible means, and
with great cruelty, had executed his vengeance upon them. As, then, the
hearts of all men are entirely under God’s control, to harden or to
soften them according to his sovereign pleasure, so, while his anger was
kindled against his people, their enemies were at the same time also
inflamed with implacable resentment towards them. But the moment his
anger was appeased, the fire which issued from the furnace of his
judgment was extinguished, and the cruelty of their enemies was changed
into mercy. And that enemies, cruel and barbarous, should begin to love
and pity those whom they formerly hated, was a change so astonishing as
to be incredible, had they not, in the kind providence of God, from
wolves been transformed into lambs.

106:47-48](../../../bib/kjv/psa106.htm#047.md)<span id="xv.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ix-p2"></span>**47.** Save us, O Jehovah our God! and
gather us from among the heathen, to praise thy holy name, and to glory
in thy praise. **48.** Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, for ever

<span id="xv.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="xv.ix-p5"></span><span id="xv.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ix-p6"></span>**47.** *Save us, Jehovah our God!* From the
conclusion of the psalm, it is evident, that it was composed during the
sad and calamitous dispersion of the people. And although subsequent to
the times of Haggai and Malachi, no famous prophets appeared among the
people, it is nevertheless probable that some of the priests were endued
with the spirit of prophecy, in order that they might direct them to the
source whence they might receive all needful consolation. It is my
opinion, that after they were dispersed by the tyranny of Antiochus,
this form of prayer was adapted to the exigency of their existing
circumstances, in which the people, by reflecting upon their former
history, might acknowledge that their fathers had, in ways innumerable,
provoked God to wrath, since the time he had delivered them. For it was
needful for them to be completely humbled, to prevent them from
murmuring against God’s dispensations. And seeing that God had extended
pardon to their fathers though undeserving of it, that was calculated to
inspire them hereafter with the hope of forgiveness, provided they
carefully and cordially sought to be reconciled to him; and especially
is this the case, because there is here a solemn remembrance of the
covenant, through the faith of which they might draw near to God, though
his anger was not yet turned away. Besides, as God had chosen them to be
his peculiar people, they call upon him to collect into one body the
dissevered and bleeding members, according to the prediction of Moses,

<span id="xv.ix-p7"></span>“If any of thine be driven out unto the
utmost parts of heaven, from thence will the Lord thy God gather thee,
and from thence will he fetch thee,” <span id="xv.ix-p7.1"></span>[De
30:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#004.md)<span id="xv.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ix-p8"></span>This prediction was at length accomplished,
when the widely separated multitude were gathered together, and grew up
in the unity of the faith. For although that people never regained their
earthly kingdom and polity, yet their being grafted into the body of
Christ, was a more preferable gathering together. Wherever they were,
they were united to each other, and also to the Gentile converts, by the
holy and spiritual bond of faith, so that they constituted but one
Church, extending itself over the whole earth. They subjoin the end
contemplated by their redemption from captivity, namely, that they
*might celebrate the name of God,* and employ themselves continually in
his praises.

<span id="xv.ix-p9"></span><span id="xv.ix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xv.ix-p10"></span>**48.** *Blessed be Jehovah, the God of
Israel* The prophet here regulates the prayers and desires of the people
in such a way, as that, amid their grievous oppression, the dejected
captives may not cease to render thanks to God; and this is a matter
which must be carefully attended to, because, when borne down by
adversity, there is scarcely one among a hundred, who, with composure of
spirit, draws near to God; but, on the contrary, he betrays the pride of
his heart by the careless and insipid manner in which he prays, or in
pouring out complaints about his afflicted condition. But the only way
in which we can expect God to lend a favorable ear to the voice of our
supplications is, in the spirit of meekness to submit to his
corrections, and patiently to bear the cross which he is pleased to lay
upon us. It is with great propriety then, that the prophet exhorts the
afflicted captives to bless God, even when he was chastising them with
considerable severity. It is to the same purpose that it is added, *let
the people say, Amen;* as if he were commanding them all to consent to
the praises of God, though both privately and publicly they were
overwhelmed in a sea of troubles.

<span id="xv-p3"></span> The first and two last verses of this psalm

proper name, (as it seems to be in <span id="xv.ii-p12.1"></span>[De

means *the sea of weeds*; and that sea is still called by a similar name
in modern Egypt. This, its designation throughout the books of the Old
Testament, is in the Syriac version and the Chaldee paraphrase likewise
rendered *the sea of weeds*; which name may have been derived from the
weeds growing near its shore, or from the weeds, or coralline
productions, with which, according to Diodorus Siculus and Kircher, it
abounded; and which were seen through its translucent waters. Finati,
quoted by Laborde, speaks of the transparency of its waters, and the
corals seen at its bottom ” — *Cresswell.* It has sometimes been
asserted that this sea received the appellation of *Red* from its color.
But it has been abundantly attested by those who have seen it, that it
is no more red than any other sea. Niebuhr, in his description of
Arabia, says, “The Europeans are accustomed to give the Arabian Gulf the
name of Red Sea; nevertheless, I have not found it any more *red* than
the Black Sea or the White Sea, or any other sea in the world.”
Artemidorus in Strabo expressly tells us that “it looks of a *green*
color, by reason of the abundance of *sea-weed* and moss that grow in
it;” which Diodorus Siculus also asserts of a particular part of it. It
appears to have derived its name of “Red Sea” from Edom, which signifies
*red.* Although throughout the whole Scriptures of the Old Testament it
is called *Yam Suph, the weedy sea,* yet among the ancient inhabitants
of the countries adjoining it was called *Yam Edom, the sea of Edom,*

the land of Edom having extended to the Arabian Gulf; and the Edomites
or Idumeans having occupied at one time a part, if not the whole, of
Arabia Petraea. The Greeks, who took the name of the sea from the
Phoenicians, who called it *Yam* *Edom,* instead of rendering it *the
sea of Edom,* or, *the Idumean Sea,* as they ought to have done, took
the word Edom, by mistake, for an appellative, instead of a proper name,
and accordingly rendered it <span id="xv.ii-p12.5"></span>ερυθρα
θαλασσα, that is, *the Red Sea.* Hence the LXX. translate *Yam Suph,* by
the *Red Sea*; in which they have been followed by the authors of our
English version. But *the sea of weeds* is undoubtedly the best
translation of the Hebrew text. — See *Prideaux*’ *Connections, etc.,*

<span id="xv.iii-p8"></span> The history to which reference is here made
is recorded in <span id="xv.iii-p8.1"></span>[Ex
15](../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#000.md)<span id="xv.iii-p8.1"></span> We
read in the 22nd verse of that chapter, that the Israelites “went out
into the wilderness of Shur, and they went three days in the wilderness,
and found no water.” They then came to Marah, where there was abundance
of water; but it was so bitter that they could not drink of it. Being
thus disappointed in the hopes with which the first sight of these
waters inspired them, they murmured against Moses, and said, “*What*
*shall we drink*?” How rapid the transition from gratitude and praise to
discontent and murmuring! No sooner did a new trouble befall that
people, than they forthwith yielded to impatience, forgat the long
series of miracles which had been wrought for their deliverance from
Egypt, and distrusting God, appeared to be at once prepared to break out
in rebellion against him and Moses their leader.

<span id="xv.iii-p14"></span> The reference here is to the quails which
God granted to the people in answer to their request for flesh, but
which, from the excess in which they partook of them, so far from
affording nourishment, proved the cause of disease. When food of an
unwholesome quality, or too much of that which is wholesome, is eaten,
nature with much violence seeks to throw it off from the system by the
several evacuations, upon which follows a sudden and almost incredible
deprivation of strength and flesh. The Israelites, when God gave them
the quails, having indulged their appetite to an immoderate degree,
(<span id="xv.iii-p14.1"></span>[Ex
16:8](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#008.md)<span id="xv.iii-p14.1"></span>;

[29](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#029)<span id="xv.iii-p14.2"></span>,.md)
the effect was their being seized with a sudden and wasting sickness,
which is supposed by some to have been what is called cholera, a disease
which produces a rapid prostration of strength and emaciation of the
whole frame. This opinion seems confirmed from what is stated in <span
id="xv.iii-p14.3"></span>[Nu
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#020.md)<span id="xv.iii-p14.3"></span>,
where it is threatened that the quails should “come out at their
nostrils,” probably indicating the violent vomitings which accompany
that malady. It is indeed said, that the *Lord smote* the people with a
very great plague, <span id="xv.iii-p14.4"></span>[Nu
11:33](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#033.md)<span id="xv.iii-p14.4"></span>.
But God’s agency, and even his miraculous agency, admits of the
subserviency of means. French and Skinner read the clause, “But sent a
wasting disease among them.” “The word <span
id="xv.iii-p14.5"></span>רזה, *to attenuate, emaciate,*” says Hammond,
“is used also for *destroying,* <span id="xv.iii-p14.6"></span>[Zep
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/zep002.htm#011.md)<span id="xv.iii-p14.6"></span>,
when God threatens that he will *emaciate, i.e., destroy all the gods.*
And then <span id="xv.iii-p14.7"></span>רזון, may be rendered, more
generally, destruction or plague, and so R. Tanchum on Zephaniah renders
it *destruction.*”

of the Egyptian God Apis, or Serapis, a word which signifies the head of
an ox, the Egyptians having exalted that animal to the rank of a god
whom they absurdly worshipped, and to whom they resorted as to an
oracle. “The modern Jews assert, that their ancestors were in that
matter misled by certain Egyptian proselytes, who had accompanied the
Israelites when they were delivered from their bondage. The Psalmist, it

‘covering spread over’ the carved wood. It is often joined with the
‘carved wooden, image’ which it covered. Aaron’s calf was thus made of

<span id="xv.v-p3"></span> Some interpreters, as Mudge and Horsley, have
felt great difficulty in interpreting this verse. “Nothing,” says the
latter critic, “was said about overthrowing the seed, at the time when
the adults, which came out of Egypt, were sentenced to perish in the
wilderness. On the contrary, it was promised that their little ones,
*i.e.,* those who were under the age of twenty years at the time of the
general muster, should be settled in the land of Canaan. — See <span
id="xv.v-p3.1"></span>[Nu 14](../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#000.md)<span
id="xv.v-p3.1"></span>“ He farther adds, that “nothing was said at the
time alluded to about scattering the seed, which should be settled in
Canaan, in some future period, through the lands.” And he concludes his
note on the verse by observing, that, upon the whole, he could not
explain it to his own satisfaction. But there seems in the passage to be
a reference to those prophetical denunciations afterwards uttered, by
which God threatened that he would punish the sins of the Israelites,
not only in their own persons, but also in their posterity; —
denunciations which have been fulfilled in the various dispersions of
that people, and which are fulfilling at the present day. — <span
id="xv.v-p3.2"></span>[Le 26:33](../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#033.md)<span
id="xv.v-p3.2"></span>; <span id="xv.v-p3.3"></span>[De
28:64](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#064.md)<span id="xv.v-p3.3"></span>. “It
is obvious,” says Dr Morison, “that those interpreters are mistaken who
refer the allusions of the 27th verse to the same history as those of
the 26th. The people overthrown in the wilderness were to be destroyed
by pestilence; but the overthrow threatened in the 27th verse was by
banishment and captivity.”

id="xv.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xv.v-p7"></span> The sins of the people had opened *a breach*
or *gap*, for God as an enemy to enter and destroy them. But, like
soldiers who stand in the breach that has been made in the walls of a
beleaguered city to oppose the irruption of the enemy, Moses, by his
earnest prayer, stopped this breach, <span id="xv.v-p7.1"></span>[Ex
32:11-14](../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#011.md)<span id="xv.v-p7.1"></span>.
“Moses is here mentioned in the character of a mediator, under the
figure of one standing in the breach of the wall of a city made by
besiegers, to oppose any farther hostile aggressions. The figure of *a
breach* is frequently employed in Scripture to denote some destruction
by God. Thus in <span id="xv.v-p7.2"></span>[Jud
21:15](../../../bib/kjv/jdg021.htm#015.md)<span id="xv.v-p7.2"></span>, God
made *a breach,*<span id="xv.v-p7.3"></span>פרף*,* in the tribes of
Israel, *i.e.,* He destroyed one of the tribes, viz., that of Benjamin:
see also <span id="xv.v-p7.4"></span>[2Sa
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#008.md)<span id="xv.v-p7.4"></span>; <span
id="xv.v-p7.5"></span>[Eze 22:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze022.htm#030.md)<span
id="xv.v-p7.5"></span>. Hence in this passage we understand that God
would have destroyed the Israelites, had not Moses stood in the breach,
*i.e.,* interceded by his prayers, just at the time when the divine
judgments were about to be executed. The Chaldee has paraphrased it
thus, *If Moses had not stood before Him and prevailed in prayer*,
*i.e*., arrested the destruction.” — *Phillips*

<span id="xv.vi-p10"></span> Baal was a very common name of the
principal male god of the nations of the East, as Ashtaroth was a common
one for their chief female deity. The Moabites, Phoenicians, Assyrians,
Babylonians, and often the Hebrews, worshipped this idol. Among the
Babylonians, he was called Bel or Belus. The sun only might at first be
worshipped under that name, as we know that under it the Phoenicians
adored that luminary. But at length it came to be applied to many other
idols, according to these words of the Apostle, “There be gods many, and
*baalims,* or lords many,” <span id="xv.vi-p10.1"></span>[1Co
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005.md)<span id="xv.vi-p10.1"></span>. As
the idol Jupiter among the Romans had different names and different
rites of worship, occasioned sometimes from the different benefits which
he was thought to bestow upon men, as Jupiter Pluvius, because he gave
rain, Jupiter Lucetius, because he gave light, Jupiter Altitonans, from
thundering; and sometimes from different places — as Jupiter Olympius,
from the hill Olympus, Jupiter Capitolinus, from the Capitol hill,
Jupiter Latialis, from that part of Italy which is called Latium: so
Baal had his distinctive titles, and different rites of worship,
occasioned in the same manner. He sometimes received his name from the
benefits he was supposed to confer, as Baal-tsephon, (<span
id="xv.vi-p10.2"></span>[Ex 14:1](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#001.md)<span
id="xv.vi-p10.2"></span>) the latter term denoting *a watcher,* and
Baalzebub, (<span id="xv.vi-p10.3"></span>[2Ki
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/kg2001.htm#002)<span id="xv.vi-p10.3"></span>.md)
which signifies *the lord of the flies.* He was worshipped under this
last name by the Cyrenians, but principally by Ekronites, because,
whenever they sacrificed to him, they believed that the swarms of flies,
which at that time molested the country, would die. At other times he
received a distinctive appellation from the places where he was
worshipped, as Baal-peor, from the hill Peor, mentioned in <span
id="xv.vi-p10.4"></span>[Nu 23:28](../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#028.md)<span
id="xv.vi-p10.4"></span>; and his temple, whither his votaries resorted,
standing on the same hill, was called *Beth-peor,* <span
id="xv.vi-p10.5"></span>[De 3:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#029.md)<span
id="xv.vi-p10.5"></span>. Possibly, however, the mountain might have
taken its name from the god that was there worshipped. The idol named
*Chemosh,* in <span id="xv.vi-p10.6"></span>[Jer
48:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#007.md)<span id="xv.vi-p10.6"></span>, is
thought to be the same as Baal-peor. “I take it,” says Goodwin, “to be
applied to Baal-peor, by way of contempt, as if one should say their
*blind god,* according to that in the psalm, ‘They have eyes, and see
not;’ for the first letter, *caph,* signifies *as it were,* or *like,*
and <span id="xv.vi-p10.7"></span>מוש, *musch, to grope,* or *feel about
in manner of blind men.*” *Moses and Aaron,* page 170. This idol was
also called *Baal-bereth,* (<span id="xv.vi-p10.8"></span>[Jud
8:33](../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#033.md)<span id="xv.vi-p10.8"></span>,

<span id="xv.vi-p11"></span> “The dead” appears to be a term of contempt
applied to idols. They are so called in opposition to the true and

this act an offended God was satisfied. He gives to <span

but so infatuated were they, and such is the desperate wickedness of the
human heart and the power of Satan over men, that they frequently
relapsed into it. Dr Adam Clarke translates the original word which
Calvin renders *devils* by *demons.* “*Devil*,” says he, “is never in
Scripture used in the plural; there is but one *devil,* though there are
many demons.”

<span id="xv.ix-p3"></span> The Hebrew for “Praise ye Jehovah,” is <span
id="xv.ix-p3.1"></span>הללו-יה, *Haleluyah,* — a word which occurs very
frequently at the beginning and end of psalms. The LXX., leaving it
untranslated, have <span id="xv.ix-p3.2"></span>Αλληλουϊα. From this
solemn form of praise to God, which no doubt was far more ancient than
the time of David, the ancient Greeks plainly had their similar
acclamation, <span id="xv.ix-p3.3"></span>Αλληλουϊα, with which they
both began and ended their poems or hymns in honor of Apollo. — See
*Parkhurst*’*s Lexicon on* <span id="xv.ix-p3.4"></span>הלל, 4. With
this psalm is concluded the fourth of the books into which the Psalms
have been divided by the Jews.
