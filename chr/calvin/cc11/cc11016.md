<span id="xvii-p1"></span>PSALM 108

<span id="xvii.i"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p1"></span><span id="xvii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
108:1-13](../../../bib/kjv/psa108.htm#001)<span id="xvii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvii.i-p2"></span>A Song or Psalm of David.

<span id="xvii.i-p3"></span>**1.** My heart is prepared, O God! my heart
is prepared; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. **2.**
Awake, psaltery and harp: I will arise at break of day. **3.** I will
praise thee, O Jehovah! among the people; and sing unto thee among the
nations: **4.** Because thy goodness is great above the heavens, and thy
truth unto the clouds. **5.** Be thou, O God! exalted above the heavens;
and thy glory above all the earth: **6.** That thy chosen may be set
free, save me by thy right hand, and hear me. **7.** God has spoken in
his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and measure the
valley of Succoth. **8.** Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim is
the strength of my head: Judah is my lawgiver.  <span
id="fr_291"></span>[292](#fn_291) **9.** Moab is the pot of my washing;
over Edom I will cast my shoe; over Philistina I will triumph. **10.**
Who will bring me into the fortified city? who will bring me even unto
Edom? **11.** Wilt not thou, O God! who hadst repulsed us? and wentest
not out, O God! with our armies? **12.** Lord us help out of our
tribulations; because the help of man is vain. **13.** Through God we
will do valiantly, and he shall trample under foot our enemies.

<span id="xvii.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="xvii.i-p6"></span>Because this psalm is composed of parts
taken from the fifty-seventh and sixtieth psalms, it would be
superfluous to repeat, in this place, what we have already said by way
of exposition in those psalms.  <span id="fr_292"></span>[293](#fn_292)

<span id="xvii.i-p7"></span> “The 108th psalm is altogether made up of
extracts from the others; its first part being identical (with the
exceptions of a few slight variations) with the third division of the
57th; its second, with the second division of the 60th. And both these
borrowed parts are discriminated, both in the 57th and 60th psalms, from
the rest of the context by the word Selah. This is a remarkable fact,
and illustrates strongly one of the functions of the Diapsalma. These
parts were, then, to a certain degree, regarded as distinct
compositions, which occasionally were disjointed from their original
context; the very change of sentiment and strain, which originated the
word Diapsalma, sanctioning such an occasional practice.” — *Jebb*’*s*
