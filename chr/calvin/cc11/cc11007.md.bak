<span id="viii-p1"></span>PSALM 99

<span id="viii-p2"></span>This psalm differs from those which precede it
in one respect, that it speaks of the kingdom of God, and the blessings
consequent upon it, as confined within Judea; and rather calls upon the
posterity of Abraham, in distinction from the surrounding nations, to
praise God for the privilege of their adoption.

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
99:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Jehovah reigns; let the people
tremble: he dwells between the cherubim; let the earth be moved. **2.**
Jehovah is great in Zion; and he is high above all nations. **3.** They
shall acknowledge thy great and terrible name; it is holy. **4.** The
king’s strength  <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) also loves
judgment; thou hast established equity, thou hast done judgment and
righteousness in Jacob.

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span><span id="viii.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span>**1** *Jehovah reigns* The people, who were
formerly called upon to rejoice, are now commanded to tremble. For as
the Jews were encompassed by enemies, it was of the utmost importance
that God’s power should be magnified among them, that they might know
that, while under his guardianship, they would be constantly and
completely safe from the hatred and fury of every foe. The Hebrew word
<span id="viii.i-p6.1"></span>רגז, *ragaz,* as we have elsewhere seen,
sometimes signifies *to tremble,* at other times, *to be angry,* and, in
short, denotes any strong emotion arising either from anger or fear.
 <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md) Accordingly, the prophet here
intends that God, in the emancipation of his chosen people, should give
such a palpable display of his power, as would strike all the nations
with dismay, and make them feel how madly they had rushed upon their own
destruction. For it is with regard to men that God is said to reign,
when he exalts himself by the magnificent displays which he gives of his
power; because, while the aid which he gives to them remains invisible,
unbelievers act a more presumptuous part, just as if there were no God.

<span id="viii.i-p8"></span><span id="viii.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p9"></span>**2** *Jehovah in Zion* It is proper that we
should not forget the antithesis I formerly mentioned, namely, that God
is great in Zion to destroy and annihilate all the enemies of his
Church; and that, when the Psalmist goes on to say, *he is high above
all nations,* his meaning is, not that he presides over them to promote
their welfare, but to disconcert their counsels, to baffle their
designs, and to subvert all their power. That which immediately follows
about the *praising of God’s name,* refers not to the nations at large,
but in my opinion to the faithful, from whom alone the prophet demands a
tribute of gratitude. For although God compels his vanquished enemies to
acknowledge him, yet as they do not cease from speaking against his
glory, and blaspheming his holy name, it cannot be to them that the
exhortation is addressed, *Praise the name of God, for it is holy;* but
to the faithful, who, from their knowledge of God’s holy name, very
cordially engage in the celebration of its praises.

<span id="viii.i-p10"></span><span id="viii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p11"></span>**4** *The king’s strength also loves
judgment* This may be viewed as a threatening designed to fill his
enemies with dismay; as if he should say, such is God’s regard for
righteousness and equity, that he hath clothed himself with power to
avenge the injuries which his enemies have done to him. I think it
preferable, however, to apply it to the Church, because she is under the
government of God for the express purpose  <span
id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md) of practicing righteousness and
holiness. There is another interpretation which is by no means
objectionable, namely, that which does not associate ideas of tyranny
with the government of God, because there is constant concord between
his power and justice. But when I consider the whole context, I have no
doubt, that the prophet, after having introduced God as established upon
his royal throne, now speaks of the manner in which he governs his
kingdom; for he adds, *thou hast established equity* and righteousness.
This clause is susceptible of two interpretations; either that God in
his law has commanded his people to practice perfect equity, or that, in
supporting and defending them, he has uniformly testified his great
regard for his justice and equity. It is most true that the highest
equity has always characterized the works and judgments of God, yet it
appears more probable that it refers to that system, that form of
government which God, who loves justice, appointed among the people of
Israel, and which was the best rule for leading a life of honesty and
integrity. And hence the word *to do* is improperly taken to signify *to
order or command.* Should any one choose to consider this last clause as
relating to God’s government, I am by no means disposed to disagree with
him. For there is nothing that more animates and encourages the faithful
to render obedience to God, or inspires them with greater zeal to
observe his law, than to find in this course of action that they are the
objects of his paternal care, and that the righteousness, which he
requires from his own people in words, is on his part reciprocated by
kind deeds.

<span id="viii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
99:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa099.htm#005.md)<span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>**5.** Exalt Jehovah our God, and worship
at his footstool; he  <span id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) is holy.
**6.** Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who
call upon his name; they called upon Jehovah, and he answered them.
**7.** He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar:  <span
id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) they kept his testimonies, and the
statute which he gave them. **8.** O Jehovah our God, thou wast a God
that wast favorable to them, though thou didst take vengeance upon their
inventions. **9.** Exalt Jehovah our God, and worship at his holy
mountain; for Jehovah our God is holy.

<span id="viii.ii-p7"></span> 

<span id="viii.ii-p8"></span><span id="viii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p9"></span>**5** *Exalt Jehovah our God* This
exhortation is properly addressed to the Church alone, because having
been made a partaker of the grace of God, she ought the more zealously
to devote herself to his service, and to the love of godliness. The
Psalmist, therefore, calls upon the Jews to exalt that God from whom
they had received such manifest help, and enjoins them to render that
worship appointed in his Law. The temple indeed is frequently in other
places denominated *God’s seat, or house,* or rest, or dwelling-place;
here it is called his footstool, and for the use of this metaphor, there
is the best of all reasons. For God desired to dwell in the midst of his
people in such a manner, as not only to direct their thoughts to the
outward temple and to the ark of the covenant, but rather to elevate
them to things above. Hence the term house or dwelling-place tended to
impart courage and confidence to them, that all the faithful might have
boldness to draw near unto God freely, whom they beheld coming to meet
them of his own accord.

<span id="viii.ii-p10"></span>But as the minds of men are prone to
superstition, it was necessary to check this propensity, lest they
should associate with their notions of God things fleshly and earthly,
and their thoughts should be wholly engrossed by the outward forms of
worship. The prophet, therefore, in calling the temple God’s footstool,
desires the godly to elevate their thoughts above it, for he fills
heaven and earth with his infinite glory. Nevertheless, by these means
he reminds us that true worship can be paid to God no where else than
upon mount Zion. For he employs a style of writing such as is calculated
to elevate the minds of the godly above the world, and, at the same
time, does not in the least degree detract from the holiness of the
temple, which alone of all places of the earth God had chosen as the
place where he was to be worshipped. From this we may see, since the
days of Augustine, how vainly many perplex themselves in endeavoring to
ascertain the reason for the prophet ordering God’s footstool to be
worshipped. The answer of Augustine is ingenious. If, says he, we look
to Christ’s manhood, we will perceive a reason why we may worship the
footstool of God, and yet not be guilty of idolatry; for that body in
which he wishes to be worshipped he took from the earth, and on this
earth nothing else than God is worshipped, for the earth is both the
habitation of Deity, and God himself condescended to become earth. All
this is very plausible, but it is foreign to the design of the prophet,
who, intending to distinguish between legal worship, (which was the only
worship that God sanctioned,) and the superstitious rites of the
heathen, summons the children of Abraham to the temple, as if to their
standard, there, after a spiritual manner, to worship God, because he
dwells in celestial glory.

<span id="viii.ii-p11"></span>Now that the shadowy dispensation has
passed away, I believe that God cannot otherwise be properly worshipped,
than when we come to him directly through Christ, in whom all the
fullness of the Godhead dwells. It were improper and absurd for any one
to designate him *a footstool.* For the prophet merely spake in this
manner to show that God was not confined to the visible temple, but that
he is to be sought for above all heavens,  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) inasmuch as he is elevated above the
whole world.

<span id="viii.ii-p13"></span>The frantic bishops of Greece, in the
second Council of Nice, very shamefully perverted this passage, when
they endeavored to prove from it that God was to be worshipped by images
and pictures. The reason  <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md)
assigned for exalting Jehovah our God, and worshipping at his footstool,
contains an antithesis: *he is holy* For the prophet, in hallowing the
name of the one God, declares all the idols of the heathen to be unholy;
as if he should say, Although the heathen claim for their idols an
imaginary sanctity, they are nevertheless very vanity, an offense, and
abomination. Some translate this *clauses for it is holy;* but it will
appear from the end of the psalm that it was the design of the prophet
by this title to distinguish God from all idols.

<span id="viii.ii-p15"></span><span id="viii.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p16"></span>**6.** *Moses and Aaron.* The Psalmist
magnifies the special grace which God in a very remarkable manner
vouchsafed to the seed of Abraham, that thence he chose for himself
prophets and priests to be, as it were, mediators between him and the
people, to ratify the covenant of salvation. And he mentions three
persons who were famous in former times. For Moses was, as it were, a
mediator to reconcile the people unto God. Aaron was invested with the
same office; and, subsequently, Samuel sustained the same character.
There is no doubt, however, that under these three persons he included
all the people with whom God had made a covenant. But he mentions the
names of those who were the depositaries and guardians of this
invaluable treasure. It may appear improper that he should speak of
Moses as *among the priests,* since his sons were only among the common
Levites, and that Moses himself, after the giving of the law, never held
the office of high priest. But as the Hebrews call <span
id="viii.ii-p16.1"></span>כוהנים, *chohanim,* those who are chief and
very eminent personages,  <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) such
as kings’ sons, there is nothing to prevent the prophet from giving this
designation to Moses, as if he had said that he was one of the holy
rulers of the Church.  <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) Moreover,
if we go back to the first original — to the period prior to the
publication of the law, it is certain that Moses was then invested with
the high priest’s office. The design of the prophet must also be kept in
mind, namely, that God not only adopted the seed of Abraham, but set
apart some of them to act as mediators, whom he enjoined to call upon
his name, in order that his covenant might be the more confirmed. For
the *invocation* of which he speaks must not be understood
indiscriminately of every manner of *calling upon,* but only of that
which belongs to the priests, who were chosen by God, as intercessors to
appear in his presence in the name of all the people, and to speak on
their behalf.

<span id="viii.ii-p19"></span>*They called upon Jehovah* The Psalmist
explains more fully what I have just now said, that God from the very
first, and with a special reference to his gracious covenant, bestowed
great benefits upon the descendants of Abraham — the Jews. And,
therefore, as often as they experienced the loving-kindness of God, it
behooved them to call to mind his former loving-kindness. The prophet,
too, makes particular mention of the visible symbol of *the cloudy
pillar,* by which God designed to testify in all ages that his presence
was ever with his people, according as he employed temporal signs, not
only for their benefit to whom they were exhibited, but also for the
benefit of those who were to succeed them. Not that God always showed a
cloudy pillar to his ancient people, but considering that the dullness
of men is so great, that they do not perceive the presence of God unless
they are put in mind by external signs, the prophet very properly
reminds the Jews of this memorable token. And as God had appeared openly
in the desert to their fathers, so their posterity might be well assured
that he would also be near to them. He adds, that they *had kept God’s
testimonies,* for the purpose of enforcing the duty of like obedience
upon succeeding generations.

<span id="viii.ii-p20"></span><span id="viii.ii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p21"></span>**8.** *O Jehovah our God* The prophet
here reminds them that God had heard their prayers because his grace and
their piety harmonized. Consequently, encouraged by their exemplary
success in prayer, their posterity ought to call upon God, not merely
pronouncing his name with their lips, but keeping his covenant with all
their heart. He farther reminds us that if God does not display his
glory so bountifully, and so profusely in every age, the fault is with
men themselves, whose posterity have either utterly forsaken, or greatly
declined from the faith of the fathers. It is not to be wondered at that
God should withdraw his hand, or at least not stretch it forth in any
remarkable way, when he beholds piety waxing cold on the earth.

<span id="viii.ii-p22"></span>*O God, thou hast been propitious to
them.*  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) From these words it is
quite obvious that what the Psalmist had formerly said concerning Moses,
Aaron, and Samuel, refers to the whole people; for surely they did not
officiate as priests merely for their own benefit, but for the common
benefit of all the Israelites. Hence the transition is more natural
which he makes from these three to the remaining body of the people. For
I neither restrict the relative, to these three persons, nor do I
interpret them exclusively of the same, but I rather think that the
state of the whole Church is pointed out; namely, that while God, at the
prayers of the priests, was propitious to the Jews, he, at the same
time, sharply punished them for their sins. For on the one hand, the
prophet magnifies the grace of God in that he had treated the people so
kindly, and had so mercifully forgiven their iniquity; on the other
hand, he specifies those awful examples of punishment by which he
punished them for their ingratitude, that their descendants might learn
to submit themselves dutifully to him. For it must not be forgotten,
that by how much God deals graciously with us, by so much will he the
less easily endure that we should treat his liberality with scorn.

<span id="viii.ii-p24"></span><span id="viii.ii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p25"></span>In the close of the psalm he repeats the
same sentence which we had in the fifth verse, only substituting *his
holy mountain* instead of *his footstool;* and as for the sake of
brevity he had formerly said somewhat obscurely <span
id="viii.ii-p25.1"></span>קדוש הוא, *kadosh hu, he is holy,* he now says
more plainly, *Jehovah our God is holy* His intention is to show that
God is not to be worshipped by the Israelites at random, (as the
religion of the heathen depended upon fancy alone,) but that his worship
is founded upon the assurance of faith.

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span> “*The king*’*s strength* seems here put for
the king himself.” — *Merrick* Street removes the original word for
*strength* to the end of the preceding verse, reading *holy and mighty*;
and renders the first part of this verse thus: “Thou art a king that
lovest judgment;” observing, that, in the Hebrew it is <span
id="viii.i-p3.1"></span>מלך, *melech*, not <span
id="viii.i-p3.2"></span>המלך, *hamelech*, that the word <span
id="viii.i-p3.3"></span>אהב, *aheb*, *that lovest*, is a participle
here, and that the pronoun <span id="viii.i-p3.4"></span>אתה, *atah*,
*thou*, belongs to the first clause. “According to the translation of
the English Bible,” says he, “there is a great want of connection. ‘The
king’s strength also loveth judgment: thou dost establish equity,’ etc.
There had been no king spoken of before except Jehovah, and the Psalmist
is here addressing him in the second person, not speaking of him in the
third.”

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span> <span id="viii.i-p7.1"></span>רגז, *ragaz*,
“denoting commotion either of the body or mind, imports in the latter
acceptation particularly two things, *fear* and *anger*, those two
principal emotions of the mind. In the sense of anger we have it in
<span id="viii.i-p7.2"></span>[Ge

the Hebrew <span id="viii.i-p7.6"></span>קצף, (affirmed of Pharaoh,
viz., that) *he was wroth*, is by the Chaldee rendered <span
id="viii.i-p7.7"></span>רגז. And this is much the more frequent
acceptation of the word in the Old Testament.” — *Hammond*’*s note* on
<span id="viii.i-p7.8"></span>[Ps
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004.md)<span id="viii.i-p7.8"></span>. On
the text before us, after observing that Abu Walid explains this root as
signifying in the Arabic *trembling* and *commotion*, arising sometimes
from anger, sometimes from fear, and other causes, the same critic says,
“Here the context may seem to direct the taking it in the notion of
commotion simply, as that signifies <span
id="viii.i-p7.9"></span>ἀκαταστασία, *sedition* or *tumult of rebels* or
other adversaries. And then the sense will be thus: ‘The Lord reigneth,
let the people be moved,’ *i* *e*., Now God hath set up David in his
throne, and peaceably settled the kingdom in him, in spite of all the
commotions of the people. The LXX. render it to this sense, as <span
id="viii.i-p7.10"></span>[Ps 4:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#004.md)<span
id="viii.i-p7.10"></span>, <span id="viii.i-p7.11"></span>ὀργιζέσθωσαν,
‘let the people be angry or regret it as much as they will.’” The verb
here, and the concluding verb of the verse, may be read in the future
tense: “The people *or* nations shall tremble, and the earth shall be
moved,” just as at the giving of the Law, “the people trembled,” and
“the earth shook.” Thus the passage may be regarded as a prediction of
the subjection of the heathen world to the dominion of Christ.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[116](cc11007.htm#fr_115.md) <span
id="viii.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p12"></span> “<span id="viii.i-p12.1"></span>A ceste
condition.” — *Fr*. “Upon condition.”

<span id="fn_116"></span>[117](cc11007.htm#fr_116.md) <span
id="viii.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p3"></span> The marginal translation in our English
Bible is, *it is holy*, connecting *holy* with Jehovah’s footstool,
mentioned in the preceding clause. This construction appears to be very
appropriate. The third, the fifth, and in effect the ninth verses, end
with this expression, which seems to be a kind of chorus, and thus
divides the psalm into three parts. The first part terminates with
ascribing *holiness* to the *name* of Jehovah; the second with
attributing the same property to his *abode*; and at the conclusion,
holiness, essential, infinite, and immutable holiness, is ascribed to
*Jehovah himself*.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[118](cc11007.htm#fr_117.md) <span
id="viii.ii-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p4"></span> That God spoke to Moses and Aaron out of
the cloudy pillar, there is no doubt. In <span
id="viii.ii-p4.1"></span>[Exod. 16:10](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#011.md)<span id="viii.ii-p4.1"></span>, we
read,

<span id="viii.ii-p5"></span>“And it came to pass as Aaron spoke unto
the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked
toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in
the cloud. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,” etc.

<span id="viii.ii-p6"></span>And when God said to Moses, <span
id="viii.ii-p6.1"></span>[Ex 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md)<span
id="viii.ii-p6.1"></span>, “Behold, I will stand before thee there upon
the rock in Horeb,” The meaning undoubtedly is, that the cloudy pillar,
from which he was to speak, would stand upon Horeb. See also <span
id="viii.ii-p6.2"></span>[Exod. 19:9](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#009.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#019.md)<span id="viii.ii-p6.2"></span>. To
this intercourse Aaron as well as Moses was admitted, as we learn from
the 24th verse of that chapter, and from <span
id="viii.ii-p6.3"></span>[Exod. 20:21](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#021.md),
[22](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#022.md)<span id="viii.ii-p6.3"></span>.
The only difficulty here is, how God can be said to have spoken to
Samuel out of the cloudy pillar, of which we have no particular account
in his history. To this it may be answered, that when God called upon
Samuel four times successively, at the fourth time he “came and stood,
and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel,” (verse 10,) which seems
parallel to those words of God to Moses, <span
id="viii.ii-p6.4"></span>[Ex 17:6](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#006.md)<span
id="viii.ii-p6.4"></span>, “I will stand before thee upon the rock,” and
may, therefore, be presumed to mean that the cloud, the usual emblem of
the Divine presence under the former dispensation, came and stood before
Samuel, and that God spake from it, though it is evident that at the
three preceding calls it did not appear. Again, when Samuel’s offerings
and prayers were so signally heard at Mizpeh, <span
id="viii.ii-p6.5"></span>[1 Samuel
7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1007.htm#000.md)<span id="viii.ii-p6.5"></span>, it
is said, verse 9, “The Lord answered him,” and verse 10, “The Lord
thundered with a great thunder;” and as where thunder is, a cloud is
supposed to exist, this answering of Samuel with thunder may not
unreasonably be supposed to denote God’s speaking to him at this time
also out of the cloud.

<span id="viii.ii-p18.9"></span>הראשונים, “*principal* or *chief men*
about the king,” as they are termed in <span
id="viii.ii-p18.10"></span>[1Ch
18:17](../../../bib/kjv/ch1018.htm#017.md)<span
id="viii.ii-p18.10"></span>. Of this sort was Ira the Jairite, who, in
<span id="viii.ii-p18.11"></span>[2Sa
20:26](../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#026.md)<span
id="viii.ii-p18.11"></span>, is called <span
id="viii.ii-p18.12"></span>כהן, which does not there denote *priest*,
but a *chief ruler* about David. Thus, as in the more general sense of
the word, it comprehends civil as well as ecclesiastical rulers, it is
evident that Moses, no less than Aaron, may be reckoned <span
id="viii.ii-p18.13"></span>בכהניו, *among God*’*s rulers* or *chief
men*; and, as Calvin states, it is to be noticed that Moses was,
properly speaking, the Priest of the Israelites before the appointment
of Aaron and his family to the sacerdotal office.

<span id="viii.ii-p23"></span> Hammond translates, “O God, thou was
propitiated for their sakes.” He observes, that <span
id="viii.ii-p23.1"></span>להם, *lahem*, which Calvin renders *to them*,
is not to be understood barely in the sense of the dative case, “thou
wast propitiated to them,” or “forgavest them;” but means *for them*,
that is, *for their sakes*: God sparing the people, for or on account of
the prayers of Moses, Aaron, and Samuel. God did not destroy them when
these holy and devoted men pleaded with him in their behalf; he spared
them, and drew back the hand of vengeance in answer to prayer. Such was
the effect of Moses’ intercessions. When the people caused Aaron to make
the golden calf and worshipped it, God’s anger was kindled against them.
And he said to Moses, “Now therefore, let me alone, that my wrath may
wax hot, and that I may consume them, and I will make of thee a great
nation.” Had Moses let God alone, the whole of that race would have been
utterly consumed. But he pleaded with God in their behalf, and “the Lord
repented him of the evil which he thought to do unto the people,” <span
id="viii.ii-p23.2"></span>[Ex
22:10-15](../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#010.md)<span
id="viii.ii-p23.2"></span>. Nor was Aaron less prevalent in turning away
the anger of God from the rebellious Israelites, as is evident from
<span id="viii.ii-p23.3"></span>[Nu
16:43-45](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#043.md)<span
id="viii.ii-p23.3"></span>. When, on the occasion of the rebellion and
murmuring of the people at Moses and Aaron on account of what befell
Korah and his company, God said to Moses, “Get thee up from among this
congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment;” Moses and Aaron
“fell upon their faces,” and prayed. Then it follows, verse 46, “And
Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the
altar; and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and
make an atonement for them; for there is wrath gone out from the Lord;
the plague is begun. And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the
midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the
people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people. And
he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.”
Equally successful were the intercessions of Samuel. When the Israelites
were sore pressed by the Philistines, and afraid of them, they “said to
Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the Lord our God for us, that he will save
us out of the hand of the Philistines.” Samuel did as they desired, and
God was propitiated by his prayers: “Samuel took a sucking lamb, and
offered it for a burnt-offering wholly unto the Lord; and Samuel cried
unto the Lord for Israel, and the Lord answered him.” — <span
