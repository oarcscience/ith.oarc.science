<span id="xxvi-p1"></span>PSALM 117

<span id="xxvi.i"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p1"></span><span id="xxvi.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
117:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/psa117.htm#001.md)<span id="xxvi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p2"></span>**1.** Praise Jehovah, all ye nations;
magnify him:, all ye peoples.  <span id="fr_384"></span>[385](#fn_384.md)
**2.** Because his mercy is strengthened  <span
id="fr_385"></span>[386](#fn_385.md) towards us: and the truth of Jehovah
remains for ever. Praise ye Jehovah.

<span id="xxvi.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="xxvi.i-p6"></span><span id="xxvi.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p7"></span>**1** *Praise Jehovah, all ye nations.* The
Holy Spirit having, by the mouth of the prophet, exhorted all nations to
celebrate the praises of God’s mercy and faithfulness, Paul, in his
Epistle to the Romans, very justly considers this as a prediction
respecting the calling of the whole world, (<span
id="xxvi.i-p7.1"></span>[Ro 15:11](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#011.md)<span
id="xxvi.i-p7.1"></span>.) How can unbelievers be qualified for praising
God, who, though not entirely destitute of his mercy, yet are insensible
of it, and are ignorant of his truth? It would therefore serve no
purpose for the prophet to address the heathen nations, unless they were
to be gathered together in the unity of the faith with the children of
Abraham. There is no ground for the censorious attempting, by their
sophistical arguments, to refute the reasoning of Paul. I grant that the
Holy Spirit elsewhere calls upon the mountains, rivers, trees, rain,
winds, and thunder, to resound the praises of God, because all creation
silently proclaims him to be its Maker. It is in a different manner that
he is praised by his rational creatures. The reason assigned is, that
*God’s mercy and truth* furnish materials for celebrating his praises.
Besides, the prophet does not mean that God shall be praised everywhere
by the Gentiles, because the knowledge of his character is confined to a
small portion of the land of Judea, but because it was to be spread over
the whole world. First, he enjoins God to be praised, *because his
goodness is increased,* or *strengthened,* for the Hebrew term admits of
both meanings. Secondly, *because his truth remains steadfast for ever*
How, then, are those qualified to celebrate his praises, who, with
brutal insensibility, pass over his goodness, and shut their ears
against his heavenly doctrine?

<span id="xxvi.i-p8"></span><span id="xxvi.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxvi.i-p9"></span>The *truth* of God, in this passage, is
properly introduced as an attestation of his grace. For he can be true
even when he menaces the whole world with perdition and ruin. The
prophet, however, has placed his *mercy* first in order that his
faithfulness and truth, comprising an assurance of his paternal
kindness, might encourage the hearts of the godly. His power and justice
are equally praiseworthy; but as men will never cordially praise God
until they are drawn by a foretaste of his goodness, the prophet very
justly selects God’s mercy and truth, which alone open the mouths of
those who are mute to engage in this exercise. When his truth is said to
be *everlasting,* it is not set in opposition to his mercy, as if it,
after flourishing for a season, then instantly passed away. The same
reason would go to prove, that it was small compared with his mercy,
which is said to be abundant. The meaning is, that God’s mercy is rich
towards us, flowing in a perennial stream, because united to his eternal
truth. If we read, *his mercy is confirmed,* all difficulty will be
removed, for then both constancy and stability will alike adorn his
mercy and his truth.

is no more than <span id="xxvi.i-p3.5"></span>πάντα τὰ ἔθνη, ‘all the

15](../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#000.md)<span id="xxvi.i-p3.6"></span>,
where, for a proof of God’s purpose that the Gentiles should be received
into the Church, and join with the believing Jews in one concert of
Christian love and faith, and *praise* God together in the same
congregation, the proof is brought, as from several other texts, so from
these words in this psalm. And this not only by expressly citing, verse
1, ‘And again praise the Lord, all ye nations, and laud him, all ye
people;’ but also in the front of the testimonies, by the phrases, ‘for
the truth of God,’ verse 8, ‘for the mercy *or* pity of God,’ verse 9,
both which are here mentioned, verse 2.” — *Hammond.*
