<span id="xiii-p1"></span>PSALM 104

<span id="xiii-p2"></span>This psalm differs from the preceding,
inasmuch as it neither treats of the special benefits which God bestows
upon his Church, nor lifts us up to the hope of the heavenly life, but
by presenting to us a lively image of his wisdom, power, and goodness in
the creation of the world, and in the order of nature, encourages us to
praise him for the manifestation he has made of himself as a father to
us in this frail and perishable life.  <span

<span id="xiii.i-p1"></span><span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
104:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#001.md)<span id="xiii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Bless Jehovah, O my soul! O Jehovah
my God! thou art exceeding great; thou hast clothed thyself with praise
and glory. **2.** Being arrayed  <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md)
with light as with a garment; and spreading out the heavens as a
curtain: **3.** Laying the beams of his upper rooms  <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) in the waters; making the clouds his
chariot; and walking upon the wings of the wind; **4.** Making the winds
his messengers; and his ministers a flaming fire.

<span id="xiii.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="xiii.i-p6"></span><span id="xiii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p7"></span>**1** *Bless Jehovah, O my soul!* After
having exhorted himself to praise God, the Psalmist adds, that there is
abundant matter for such an exercise; thus indirectly condemning himself
and others of ingratitude, if the praises of God, than which nothing
ought to be better known, or more celebrated, are buried by silence. In
comparing *the light* with which he represents God as *arrayed* to a
garment, he intimates, that although God is invisible, yet his glory is
conspicuous enough. In respect of his essence, God undoubtedly dwells in
light that is inaccessible; but as he irradiates the whole world by his
splendor, this is the garment in which He, who is hidden in himself,
appears in a manner visible to us. The knowledge of this truth is of the
greatest importance. If men attempt to reach the infinite height to
which God is exalted, although they fly above the clouds, they must fail
in the midst of their course. Those who seek to see him in his naked
majesty are certainly very foolish. That we may enjoy the light of him,
he must come forth to view with his clothing; that is to say, we must
cast our eyes upon the very beautiful fabric of the world in which he
wishes to be seen by us, and not be too curious and rash in searching
into his secret essence. Now, since God presents himself to us clothed
with light, those who are seeking pretexts for their living without the
knowledge of him, cannot allege in excuse of their slothfulness, that he
is hidden in profound darkness. When it is said that *the heavens are a
curtain,* it is not meant that under them God hides himself, but that by
them his majesty and glory are displayed; being, as it were, his royal
pavilion.

<span id="xiii.i-p8"></span><span id="xiii.i-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p9"></span>**3.** *Laying the beams of his chambers in
the waters* David now proceeds to explain at greater length what he had
briefly stated under the figure of God’s raiment. The scope of the
passage is shortly this, that we need not pierce our way above the
clouds for the purpose of finding God, since he meets us in the fabric
of the world, and is everywhere exhibiting to our view scenes of the
most vivid description. That we may not imagine that there is any thing
in Him derived, as if, by the creation of the world, he received any
addition to his essential perfection and glory, we must remember that he
clothes himself with this robe for our sake. The metaphorical
representation of God, as *laying the beams of his chambers in the
waters,* seems somewhat difficult to understand; but it was the design
of the prophet, from a thing incomprehensible to us, to ravish us with
the greater admiration. Unless beams be substantial and strong, they
will not be able to sustain even the weight of an ordinary house. When,
therefore, God makes the waters the foundation of his heavenly palace,
who can fail to be astonished at a miracle so wonderful? When we take
into account our slowness of apprehension, such hyperbolical expressions
are by no means superfluous; for it is with difficulty that they awaken
and enable us to attain even a slight knowledge of God.

<span id="xiii.i-p10"></span>What is meant by his *walking upon the
wings of the wind,* is rendered more obvious from the following verse,
where it is said, that *the winds are his messengers* God rides on the
clouds, and is carried upon the wings of the wind, inasmuch as he drives
about the winds and clouds at his pleasure, and by sending them hither
and thither as swiftly as he pleases, shows thereby the signs of his
presence. By these words we are taught that the winds do not blow by
chance, nor the lightnings flash by a fortuitous impulse, but that God,
in the exercise of his sovereign power, rules and controls all the
agitations and disturbances of the atmosphere. From this doctrine a
twofold advantage may be reaped. In the first place, if at any time
noxious winds arise, if the south wind corrupt the air, or if the north
wind scorch the corn, and not only tear up trees by the root, but
overthrow houses, and if other winds destroy the fruits of the earth, we
ought to tremble under these scourges of Providence. In the second
place, if, on the other hand, God moderate the excessive heat by a
gentle cooling breeze, if he purify the polluted atmosphere by the north
wind, or if he moisten the parched ground by south winds; in this we
ought to contemplate his goodness.

<span id="xiii.i-p11"></span>As the apostle, who writes to the Hebrews,
(<span id="xiii.i-p11.2"></span>[Heb
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#007)<span id="xiii.i-p11.2"></span>.md)
quotes this passage, and applies it to the angels, both the Greek and
Latin expositors have almost unanimously considered David as here
speaking allegorically. In like manner, because Paul, in quoting <span
id="xiii.i-p11.3"></span>[Ps 19:4](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#004.md)<span
id="xiii.i-p11.3"></span>, in his Epistle to the Romans, (<span
id="xiii.i-p11.4"></span>[Ro
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#018)<span id="xiii.i-p11.4"></span>.md)
seems to apply to the apostles what is there stated concerning the
heavens, the whole psalm has been injudiciously expounded as if it were
an allegory.  <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md) The design of the
apostle, in that part of the Epistle to the Hebrews referred to, was not
simply to explain the mind of the prophet in this place; but since God
is exhibited to us, as it were, visibly in a mirror, the apostle very
properly lays down the analogy between the obedience which the winds
manifestly and perceptibly yield to God, and that obedience which he
receives from the angels. In short, the meaning is, that as God makes
use of the winds as his messengers, turns them hither and thither, calms
and raises them whenever he pleases, that by their ministry he may
declare his power, so the angels were created to execute his commands.
And certainly we profit little in the contemplation of universal nature,
if we do not behold with the eyes of faith that spiritual glory of which
an image is presented to us in the world.

<span id="xiii.ii"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
104:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#005.md)<span id="xiii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p2"></span>**5.** He hath founded the earth upon its
foundations, so that it shall not be moved for ever. **6.** He hath
covered it with the deep as with a garment: the waters shall stand above
the mountains. **7.** At thy rebuke they shall flee; at the voice of thy
thunder they shall haste away.  <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md)
**8.** The mountains shall ascend, and the valleys shall descend  <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) to the place which thou hast founded
for them. **9.** Thou hast fixed a bound over which they shall not pass;
they shall not return to cover the earth.

<span id="xiii.ii-p5"></span> 

<span id="xiii.ii-p6"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p7"></span>**5** *He hath founded the earth upon its
foundations* Here the prophet celebrates the glory of God, as manifested
in the stability of the earth. Since it is suspended in the midst of the
air, and is supported only by pillars of water, how does it keep its
place so steadfastly that it cannot be moved? This I indeed grant may be
explained on natural principles; for the earth, as it occupies the
lowest place, being the center of the world, naturally settles down
there. But even in this contrivance there shines forth the wonderful
power of God. Again, if the waters are higher than the earth, because
they are lighter, why do they not cover the whole earth round about?
Certainly the only answer which philosophers can give to this is, that
the tendency of the waters to do so is counteracted by the providence of
God, that a dwelling-place might be provided for man. If they do not
admit that the waters are restrained by the determinate appointment of
God, they betray not only their depravity and unthankfulness, but also
their ignorance, and are altogether barbarous. The prophet, therefore,
not without reason, recounts among the miracles of God, that which would
be to us wholly incredible, did not even experience show its truth. We
are very base indeed if, taught by such undoubted a proof, we do not
learn that nothing in the world is stable except in as far as it is
sustained by the hand of God. The world did not originate from itself,
consequently, the whole order of nature depends on nothing else than his
appointment, by which each element has its own peculiar property. Nor is
the language of the prophet to be viewed merely as an exhortation to
give thanks to God; it is also intended to strengthen our confidence in
regard to the future, that we may not live in the world in a state of
constant fear and anxiety, as we must have done had not God testified
that he has given the earth for a habitation to men. It is a singular
blessing, which he bestows upon us, in his causing us to dwell upon the
earth with undisturbed minds, by giving us the assurance that he has
established it upon everlasting pillars. Although cities often perish by
earthquakes, yet the body of the earth itself remains. Yea, all the
agitations which befall it more fully confirm to us the truth, that the
earth would be swallowed up every moment were it not preserved by the
secret power of God.

<span id="xiii.ii-p8"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p9"></span>**6.** *He hath covered it with the deep as
with a garment,* This may be understood in two ways, either as implying
that now the sea covers the earth as a garment, or that at the
beginning, before God by his omnipotent word held gathered the waters
together into one place, the earth was covered with the deep. But the
more suitable sense appears to be, that the sea is now the covering of
the earth. At the first creation the deep was not so much a garment as a
grave, inasmuch as nothing bears less resemblance to the adorning of
apparel than the state of confused desolation and shapeless chaos in
which the earth then was. Accordingly, in my judgment, there is here
celebrated that wonderful arrangement by which the deep, although
without form, is yet the garment of the earth. But as the context seems
to lead to a different view, interpreters are rather inclined to explain
the language as denoting, That the earth was covered with the deep
before the waters had been collected into a separate place. This
difficulty is however easily solved, if the words of the prophet, *The
waters shall stand above the mountains,* are resolved into the potential
mood thus, *The waters would stand above the mountains;* which is
sufficiently vindicated from the usage of the Hebrew language. I have
indeed no doubt that the prophet, after having said that God had clothed
the earth with waters, adds, by way of exposition, that the waters would
stand above the mountains, were it not that they flee away at God’s
rebuke. Whence is it that the mountains are elevated, and that the
valleys sink down, but because bounds are set to the waters, that they
may not return to overwhelm the earth? The passage then, it is obvious,
may very properly be understood thus, — that the sea, although a mighty
deep, which strikes terror by its vastness, is yet as a beautiful
garment to the earth. The reason of the metaphor is, because the surface
of the earth stands uncovered. The prophet affirms that this does not
happen by chance; for, if the providence of God did not restrain the
waters, would they not immediately rush forth to overwhelm the whole
earth? He, therefore, speaks advisedly when he maintains that the
appearance of any part of the earth’s surface is not the effect of
nature, but is an evident miracle. Were God to give loose reins to the
sea, the waters would suddenly cover the mountains. But now, fleeing at
God’s rebuke, they retire to a different quarter. By *the rebuke of God,
and the voice of his thunder,* is meant the awful command of God, by
which he restrains the violent raging of the sea. Although at the
beginning, by his word alone, he confined the sea within determinate
bounds, and continues to this day to keep it within them, yet if we
consider how tumultuously its billows cast up their foam when it is
agitated, it is not without reason that the prophet speaks of it, as
kept in check by the powerful command of God; just as, both in Jeremiah,
(<span id="xiii.ii-p9.1"></span>[Jer
5:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer005.htm#022)<span id="xiii.ii-p9.1"></span>.md)
and in Job, (<span id="xiii.ii-p9.2"></span>[Job
28:25](../../../bib/kjv/job028.htm#025)<span id="xiii.ii-p9.2"></span>.md)
God, with much sublimity, commends his power, as displayed in the ocean.
*The ascending of the mountains, and the descending of the valleys,* are
poetical figures, implying, that unless God confined the deep within
bounds, the distinction between mountains and valleys, which contributes
to the beauty of the earth, would cease to exist, for it would engulf
the whole earth. It is said that God *has founded a place for the
valleys;* for there would be no dry land at the foot of the mountains,
but the deep would bear sway, did not God command the space there to be
unoccupied by the sea, as it were contrary to nature.

<span id="xiii.ii-p10"></span><span id="xiii.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.ii-p11"></span>**9.** *Thou hast set a bound which they
shall not pass* The miracle spoken of is in this verse amplified, from
its perpetuity. Natural philosophers are compelled to admit, and it is
even one of their first principles, that the water is circular, and
occupies the region intermediate between the earth and the air. It is
entirely owing to the providence of God, that part of the earth remains
dry and fit for the habitation of men. This is a fact of which mariners
have the most satisfactory evidence. Yea, were even the rudest and most
stupid of our race only to open their eyes, they would behold in the sea
mountains of water elevated far above the level of the land. Certainly
no banks, and even no iron gates, could make the waters, which in their
own nature are fluid and unstable, keep together and in one place, as we
see to be the case. I have just now said that earthquakes, which bring
destruction upon some places, leave the globe, upon the whole, as it was
before; and in like manner, although the sea, in some parts of the
world, overpasses its boundaries, yet the law, which confines it; within
certain limits, stands fast, that the earth may be a fit habitation for
men. The Baltic Sea, in our own time, inundated large tracts of land,
and did great damage to the Flemish people and other neighboring
nations. By an instance of this kind we are warned what would be the
consequence, were the restraint imposed upon the sea, by the hand of
God, removed. How is it that we have not thereby been swallowed up
together, but because God has held in that outrageous element by his
word? In short, although the natural tendency of the waters is to cover
the earth, yet this will not happen, because God has established, by his
word, a counteracting law, and as his truth is eternal, this law must
remain steadfast.

<span id="xiii.iii-p9"></span> 

<span id="xiii.iii-p10"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p11"></span>**10.** *Sending out springs by the
valleys* The Psalmist here describes another instance both of the power
and goodness of God, which is, that he makes fountains to gush out in
the mountains, and to run down through the midst of the valleys.
Although it is necessary for the earth to be dry, to render it a fit
habitation for us, yet, unless we had water to drink, and unless the
earth opened her veins, all kinds of living creatures would perish. The
prophet, therefore, speaks in commendation of that arrangement by which
the earth, though dry, yet supplies us with water by its moisture. The
word <span id="xiii.iii-p11.1"></span>נחלים, *nechalim,* which I have
rendered *springs,* is by some translated, *torrents* or *rivers;* but
*springs* is more appropriate. In the same sense it is added immediately
after, that *they run among the hills;* and yet, it is scarcely credible
that fountains could spring forth from rocks and stony places. But here
it may be asked, why the prophet says that *the beasts of the field
quench their thirst,* rather than men, for whose sake the world was
created? I would observe, in reply, that he obviously spake in this
manner, for the purpose of enhancing the goodness of God, who vouchsafes
to extend his care to the brute creation, yea, even to the *wild asses,*
under which species are included all other kinds of wild beasts. And he
purposely refers to desert places, that each of us may compare with them
the more pleasant, and the cultivated parts of the earth, afterwards
mentioned. Rivers run even through great and desolate wildernesses,
where the wild beasts enjoy some blessing of God; and no country is so
barren as not to have trees growing here and there, on which birds make
the air to resound with the melody of their singing. Since even those
regions where all lies waste and uncultivated, furnish manifest tokens
of the Divine goodness and power, with what admiration ought we to
regard that most abundant supply of all good things, which is to be seen
in cultivated and favorable regions? Surely in countries where not only
one river flows, or where not only grass grows for the feeding of wild
beasts, or where the singing of birds is heard not only from a few
trees, but where a manifold and varied abundance of good things
everywhere presents itself to our view, our stupidity is more than
brutish, if our minds, by such manifestations of the goodness of God,
are not fixed in devout meditation on his glory.

<span id="xiii.iii-p12"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p13"></span>The same subject is prosecuted in the
13th verse, where it is said *that God watereth the mountains from his
chambers* It is no ordinary miracle that the mountains, which seem to be
condemned to perpetual drought, and which, in a manner, are suspended in
the air, nevertheless abound in pastures. The prophet, therefore, justly
concludes that this fruitfulness proceeds from nothing else but the
agency of God, who is their secret cultivator. Labour cannot indeed, in
the proper sense, be attributed to God, but still it is not without
reason applied to him, for, by merely blessing the earth from the place
of his repose, he works more efficaciously than if all the men in the
world were to waste themselves by incessant labor.

<span id="xiii.iii-p14"></span>**14.** *Making grass to grow for cattle*
The Psalmist now comes to men, of whom God vouchsafes to take a special
care as his children. After having spoken of the brute creation, he
declares, that corn is produced, and bread made of it, for the
nourishment of the human race; and he mentions in addition to this, wine
and oil, two things which not only supply the need of mankind, but also
contribute to their cheerful enjoyment of life. Some understand the
Hebrew word <span id="xiii.iii-p14.1"></span>לעבדת, *laäbodath,* which I
have rendered *for the service,* to denote the labor which men bestow in
husbandry; for while grass grows on the mountains of itself, and without
human labor, corn and herbs, which are sown, can only be produced, as is
well known, by the labor and sweat of men. According to them the meaning
is, that God blesses the toil of men in the cultivation of the fields.
But this being too strained an interpretation, it is better to
understand the word *service,* in the ordinary sense of the term. With
respect to the word *bread,* I do not object to the view of those who
understand it in a restricted sense, although it probably includes all
kinds of food; only I dislike the opinion of those who exclude bread.
There is no force in the reason which they allege for taking this view,
namely, that in the following verse another use of bread is added, when
it is said, that it strengthens the heart of man; for there the same
thing is expressed in different words. The prophet, in stating that God
causeth the earth to bring forth *herbs* for the support of men, intends
to say that the earth supplies them not only with food in corn, but also
with other herbs and fruits; for the means of our sustenance is not
limited exclusively to one kind of food.

<span id="xiii.iii-p15"></span><span id="xiii.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iii-p16"></span>**15.** *And wine that cheereth the heart
of man* In these words we are taught, that God not only provides for
men’s necessity, and bestows upon them as much as is sufficient for the
ordinary purposes of life, but that in his goodness he deals still more
bountifully with them by cheering their hearts with wine and oil. Nature
would certainly be satisfied with water to drink; and therefore the
addition of wine is owing to God’s superabundant liberality. The
expression, *and oil to make his face to shine,* has been explained in
different ways. As sadness spreads a gloom over the countenance, some
give this exposition, That when men enjoy the commodities of wine and
oil, their faces shine with gladness. Some with more refinement of
interpretation, but without foundation, refer this to *lamps.* Others,
considering the letter <span id="xiii.iii-p16.1"></span>מ, *mem* to be
the sign of the comparative degree, take the meaning to be, that wine
makes men’s faces shine more than if they were anointed with oil. But
the prophet, I have no doubt, speaks of unguents, intimating that God
not only bestows upon men what is sufficient for their moderate use, but
that he goes beyond this, giving them even their delicacies.

<span id="xiii.iii-p17"></span>The words in the last clause, *and bread
that sustains man’s heart,* I interpret thus: Bread would be sufficient
to support the life of man, but God over and above, to use a common
expression, bestows upon them wine and oil. The repetition then of the
purpose which bread serves is not superfluous: it is employed to commend
to us the goodness of God in his tenderly and abundantly nourishing men
as a kind-hearted father does his children. For this reason, it is here
stated again, that as God shows himself a foster-father sufficiently
bountiful in providing bread, his liberality appears still more
conspicuous in giving us dainties.

<span id="xiii.iii-p18"></span>But as there is nothing to which we are
more prone, than to abuse God’s benefits by giving way to excess, the
more bountiful he is towards men, the more ought they to take care not
to pollute, by their intemperance, the abundance which is presented
before them. Paul had therefore good reason for giving that prohibition,
(<span id="xiii.iii-p18.1"></span>[Ro
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#014.md)<span
id="xiii.iii-p18.1"></span>)

<span id="xiii.iii-p19"></span>“Make not provision for the flesh, to
fulfill the lusts thereof;”

<span id="xiii.iii-p20"></span>for if we give full scope to the desires
of the flesh, there will be no bounds. As God bountifully provides for
us, so he has appointed a law of temperance, that each may voluntarily
restrain himself in his abundance. He sends out oxen and asses into
pastures, and they content themselves with a sufficiency; but while
furnishing us with more than we need, he enjoins upon us an observance
of the rules of moderation, that we may not voraciously devour his
benefits; and in lavishing upon us a more abundant supply of good things
than our necessities require, he puts our moderation to the test. The
proper rule with respect to the use of bodily sustenance, is to partake
of it that it may sustain, but not oppress us. The mutual communication
of the things needful for the support of the body, which God has
enjoined upon us, is a very good check to intemperance; for the
condition upon which the rich are favored with their abundance is, that
they should relieve the wants of their brethren. As the prophet in this
account of the divine goodness in providence makes no reference to the
excesses of men, we gather from his words that it is lawful to use wine
not only in cases of necessity, but also thereby to make us merry. This
mirth must however be tempered with sobriety, first, that men may not
forget themselves, drown their senses, and destroy their strength, but
rejoice before their God, according to the injunction of Moses, (<span
id="xiii.iii-p20.1"></span>[Le
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#040.md)<span
id="xiii.iii-p20.1"></span>;) and, secondly, that they may exhilarate
their minds under a sense of gratitude, so as to be rendered more active
in the service of God. He who rejoices in this way will also be always
prepared to endure sadness, whenever God is pleased to send it. That
rule of Paul ought to be kept in mind, (<span
id="xiii.iii-p20.2"></span>[Php
4:12](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012.md)<span
id="xiii.iii-p20.2"></span>,)

<span id="xiii.iii-p21"></span>“I have learned to abound, — I have
learned to suffer want.”

<span id="xiii.iii-p22"></span>If some token of the divine anger is
manifest, even he who has an overflowing abundance of all kinds of
dainty food, will restrict himself in his diet knowing that he is called
to put on sackcloth, and to sit among ashes. Much more ought he whom
poverty compels to be temperate and sober, to abstain from such
delicacies. In short, if one man is constrained to abstain from wine by
sickness, if another has only vapid wine, and a third nothing but water,
let each be content with his own lot, and willingly and submissively
wean himself from those gratifications which God denies him.

<span id="xiii.iii-p23"></span>The same remarks apply to oil. We see
from this passage that ointments were much in use among the Jews, as
well as among the other eastern nations. At the present day, it is
different with us, who rather keep ointments for medicinal purposes,
than use them as articles of luxury. The prophet, however, says, that
oil also is given to men, that they may anoint themselves therewith. But
as men are too prone to pleasure, it is to be observed, that the law of
temperance ought not to be separated from the beneficence of God, lest
they abuse their liberty by indulging in luxurious excess. This
exception must always be added, that no person may take encouragement
from this doctrine to licentiousness.

<span id="xiii.iii-p24"></span>Moreover, when men have been carefully
taught to bridle their lust, it is important for them to know, that God
permits them to enjoy pleasures in moderation, where there is the
ability to provide them; else they will never partake even of bread and
wine with a tranquil conscience; yea, they will begin to scruple about
the tasting of water, at least they will never come to the table but in
fearfulness. Meanwhile, the greater part of the world will wallow in
pleasures without discrimination, because they do not consider what God
permits them; for his fatherly kindness should be to us the best
mistress to teach us moderation.

<span id="xiii.iv-p8"></span><span id="xiii.iv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.iv-p9"></span>**16.** *The trees of Jehovah shall be
satiated* The Psalmist again treats of God’s general providence in
cherishing all the parts of the world. In the first place, he asserts,
that by the watering of which he had spoken the trees are satiated, or
filled with sap, that thus flourishing they may be a place of abode to
the birds. He next declares, that the wild deer and conies have also
their places of shelter, to show that no part of the world is forgotten
by Him, who is the best of fathers, and that no creature is excluded
from his care. The transition which the prophet makes from men to trees
is as if he had said, It is not to be wondered at, if God so bountifully
nourishes men who are created after his own image, since he does not
grudge to extend his care even to trees. By *the trees of the Lord,* is
meant those which are high and of surpassing beauty; for God’s blessing
is more conspicuous in them. It seems scarcely possible for any juice of
the earth to reach so great a height, and yet they renew their foliage
every year.

<span id="xiii.v-p2"></span>**19.** He hath appointed the moon to

<span id="xiii.v-p5"></span> 

<span id="xiii.v-p6"></span><span id="xiii.v-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p7"></span>**19.** *He hath appointed the moon to
distinguish seasons* The Psalmist now comes to another commendation of
God’s providence as manifested in the beautiful arrangement by which the
course of the sun and moon alternately succeeds each other; for the
diversity in their mutual changes is so far from producing confusion,
that all must easily perceive the impossibility of finding any better
method of distinguishing time. When it is said, that the *moon was
appointed to distinguish seasons,* interpreters agree that this is to be
understood of the ordinary and appointed feasts. The Hebrews having been
accustomed to compute their months by the moon, this served for
regulating their festival days and assemblies, both sacred and
political.  <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193.md) The prophet, I have
no doubt, by the figure synecdoche, puts a part for the whole,
intimating, that the moon not only distinguishes the days from the
nights, but likewise marks out the festival days, measures years and
months, and, in fine, answers many useful purposes, inasmuch as the
distinction of times is taken from her course. As to the sentence, The
*sun knoweth his going down,* I understand it not only of his daily
circuit, but as also denoting that by gradually approaching nearer us at
one time, and receding farther from us at another, he knows how to
regulate his movements by which to make summer, winter, spring, and
autumn. It is farther stated, *that the beasts of the forest creep forth
during the night,* because they go out of their dens with fear. Some
translate the verb <span id="xiii.v-p8.1"></span>רמש*, ramas, to walk;*
but its proper signification which I have given is not unsuitable; for
although hunger often drives wild beasts into fury, yet they *watch* for
the darkness of the night, that they may move abroad from their
hiding-places, and on account of this fearfulness they are said to creep
forth.

<span id="xiii.v-p9"></span><span id="xiii.v-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p10"></span>**21.** The *lions roar after their prey*
Although lions, if hunger compels them, go forth from their dens and
roar even at noon-day, yet the prophet describes what is most usually
the case. He therefore says, that lions do not venture to go abroad
during the daytime, but that, trusting to the darkness of the night,
they then sally forth in quest of their prey. Herein is manifested the
wonderful providence of God, that a beast so dreadful confines itself
within its den, that men may walk abroad with the greater freedom. And
if lions sometimes range with greater liberty, this is to be imputed to
the fall of Adam, which has deprived men of their dominion over the wild
beasts. There are, however, still some remains of the original blessing
conferred by God on men, inasmuch as he holds in check so many wild
beasts by the light of day, as if by iron cages or chains. The
expression, *They seek their food from God,* is not to be understood of
their casting themselves upon the care of God, as if they acknowledged
him to be their foster-father, but it points out the fact itself, that
God in a wonderful manner provides food for such ravenous beasts.

<span id="xiii.v-p11"></span><span id="xiii.v-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p12"></span>**22.** *The sun shall rise* The Psalmist
continues to prosecute the same subject, showing that God so distributes
the successions of time, as that the day belongs properly to man. Did
not God put a restraint upon so many wild beasts which are hostile to
us, the human race would soon become extinct. As wild beasts since the
fall of man may seem to be born to do us hurt, and to rend and tear in
pieces all whom they meet with, this savage cruelty must be kept under
check by the providence of God. And in order to keep them shut up within
their dens, the only means which he employs is to inspire them with
terror, simply by the light of the sun. This instance of divine
goodness, the prophet commends the more on account of its necessity; for
were it otherwise, men would have no liberty to go forth to engage in
the labors and business of life. Man being thus protected by the light
against the violence and injuries of wild beasts, in this is to be seen
the unparalleled goodness of God, who in so fatherly a manner has
provided for his convenience and welfare.

104:24-26](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#024.md)<span
id="xiii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vi-p2"></span>**24.** O Jehovah! how magnificent are thy
works! thou hast made all things in wisdom: the earth is full of thy
riches. **25.** Great is this sea, and wide in extent; therein are
things creeping innumerable, both small and great animals. **26.** There
go the ships  <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194.md) and the leviathan,
which thou hast made to sport itself in it.

<span id="xiii.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiii.vi-p5"></span><span id="xiii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vi-p6"></span>**24.** *O Jehovah! how magnificent are thy
works* The prophet does not make a full enumeration of the works of God,
which would be an endless task, but only touches upon certain
particulars, that every one may be led from the consideration of them to
reflect the more attentively on that wisdom by which God governs the
whole world, and every particular part of it. Accordingly, breaking off
his description, he exclaims with admiration, — *How greatly to be
praised are thy works!* even as we then only ascribe to God due honor
when seized with astonishment, we acknowledge that our tongues and all
our senses fail us in doing justice to so great a subject. If a small
portion of the works of God make us amazed, how inadequate are our
feeble minds to comprehend the whole extent of them! In the first place,
it is said, *that God has made all things in wisdom,* and then it is
added, *that the earth is full of his riches* The mention of *wisdom*
only is not intended to exclude the divine power, but the meaning is,
that there is nothing in the world confused, — that, so far from this,
the vast variety of things mixed together in it are arranged with the
greatest wisdom, so as to render it impossible for any thing to be
added, abstracted, or improved. This commendation is set in opposition
to the unhallowed imaginations, which often creep upon us when we are
unable to discover the designs of God in his works, as if indeed he were
subject to folly like ourselves, so as to be forced to bear the
reprehension of those who are blind in the consideration of his works.
The prophet also, by the same eulogium, reproves the madness of those
who dream, that the world has been brought into its present form by
chance, as Epicurus raved about the elements being composed of atoms. As
it is an imagination more than irrational to suppose, that a fabric so
elegant, and of such surpassing embellishment, was put together by the
fortuitous concourse of atoms, the prophet here bids us attend more
carefully to the wisdom of God, and to that wonderful skill which shines
forth in the whole government of the world. Under *riches* are
comprehended the goodness and beneficence of God; for it is not on his
own account that he has so richly replenished the earth but on ours,
that nothing which contributes to our advantage may be wanting. We ought
to know that the earth does not possess such fruitfulness and riches of
itself, but solely by the blessing of God, who makes it the means of
administering to us his bounty.

<span id="xiii.vi-p7"></span><span id="xiii.vi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vi-p8"></span>**25.** *Great is this sea, and wide in
extent* After having treated of the evidences which the earth affords of
the glory of God, the prophet goes down into the sea, and teaches us
that it is a new mirror in which may be beheld the divine power and
wisdom. Although the sea were not inhabited by fishes, yet the mere view
of its vastness would excite our wonder, especially when at one time it
swells with the winds and tempests, while at another it is calm and
unruffled. Again, although navigation is an art which has been acquired
by the skill of men, yet it depends on the providence of God, who has
granted to men a passage through the mighty deep. But the abundance and
variety of fishes enhance in no small degree the glory of God in the
sea. Of these the Psalmist celebrates especially *the leviathan or the
whale*  <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195.md) because this animal,
though there were no more, presents to our view a sufficient, yea, more
than a sufficient, proof of the dreadful power of God, and for the same
reason, we have a lengthened account of it in the book of Job. As its
movements not only throw the sea into great agitation, but also strike
with alarm the hearts of men, the prophet, by the word *sport,*
intimates that these its movements are only sport in respect of God; as
if he had said, The sea is given to the leviathans, as a field in which
to exercise themselves.

<span id="xiii.vii"></span>

<span id="xiii.vii-p1"></span><span id="xiii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
104:27-30](../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027.md)<span
id="xiii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vii-p2"></span>**27.** All things wait upon thee, that
thou mayest give them food in their season. **28.** Thou shalt give it
to them, and they shall gather it: thou shalt open thy hand, and they
shall be filled \[or satiated\] with good. **29.** Thou shalt hide thy
face, and they shall be afraid: thou shalt take away their spirit, and
they shall die, and return to their dust. **30.** Thou shalt send forth
thy spirit, and they shall be created:  <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196.md) and thou shalt renew the face of the
earth.

<span id="xiii.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xiii.vii-p5"></span><span id="xiii.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vii-p6"></span>**27.** *All these wait upon thee* The
prophet here again describes God as acting the part of the master of a
household, and a foster-father towards all sorts of living creatures, by
providing liberally for them. He had said before, that God made food to
grow on the mountains for the support of cattle, and that sustenance is
ministered to the very lions by the hand of the same God, although they
live upon prey. Now he amplifies this wonder of the divine beneficence
by an additional circumstance. While the different species of living
creatures are almost innumerable, and the number in each species is so
great, there is yet not one of them which does not stand in need of
daily food. The meaning then of the expression, *All things wait upon
thee,* is, that they could not continue in existence even for a few
days, unless God were to supply their daily need, and to nourish each of
them in particular. We thus see why there is so great a diversity of
fruits; for God assigns and appoints to each species of living creatures
the food suitable and proper for them. The brute beasts are not indeed
endued with reason and judgment to seek the supply of their wants from
God, but stooping towards the earth, they seek to fill themselves with
food; still the prophet speaks with propriety, when he represents them
as waiting upon God; for their hunger must be relieved by his bounty,
else they would soon die. Nor is the specification of *the season* when
God furnishes them with food superfluous, since God lays up in store for
them, that they may have the means of sustenance during the whole course
of the year. As the earth in winter shuts up her bowels, what would
become of them if he did not provide them with food for a long time? The
miracle, then, is the greater from the circumstance, that God, by making
the earth fruitful at stated seasons, extends in this way his blessing
to the rest of the year which threatens us with hunger and famine. How
wretched would we be when the earth in winter shuts up her riches, were
not our hearts cheered with the hope of a new increase? In this sense,
the Psalmist appropriately affirms, that God *opens his hand* If wheat
should grow up daily, God’s providence would not be so manifest. But
when the earth becomes barren, it is as if God shut his hand. Whence it
follows, that when he makes it fruitful, he, so to speak, stretches out
his hand from heaven to give us food. Now if he supply wild and brute
beasts with sustenance in due season, by which they are fed to the full,
his blessing will doubtless be to us as an inexhaustible source of
plenty, provided we ourselves do not hinder it from flowing to us by our
unbelief.

<span id="xiii.vii-p7"></span><span id="xiii.vii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.vii-p8"></span>**29** *Thou shalt hide thy face, and they
shall be afraid* In these words, the Psalmist declares, that we stand or
fall according to the will of God. We continue to live, so long as he
sustains us by his power; but no sooner does he withdraw his life-giving
spirit than we die. Even Plato knew this, who so often teaches that,
properly speaking, there is but one God, and that all things subsist, or
have their being only in him. Nor do I doubt, that it was the will of
God, by means of that heathen writer, to awaken all men to the
knowledge, that they derive their life from another source than from
themselves. In the first place, the Psalmist asserts, that *if God hide
his face they are afraid;* and, secondly, that *if he take away their
spirit they die, and return to their dust;* by which words he points
out, that when God vouchsafes to look upon us, that look gives us life,
and that as long as his serene countenance shines, it inspires all the
creatures with life. Our blindness then is doubly inexcusable, if we do
not on our part cast our eyes upon that goodness which gives life to the
whole world. The prophet describes step by step the destruction of
living creatures, upon God’s withdrawing from them his secret energy,
that from the contrast he may the better commend that continued
inspiration, by which all things are maintained in life and rigor. He
could have gone farther, and have asserted, that all things, unless
upheld in being by God, would return to nothing; but he was content with
affirming in general and popular language, that whatever is not
cherished by Him falls into corruption. He again declares, that the
world is daily *renewed,* because *God sends forth his spirit* In the
propagation of living creatures, we doubtless see continually a new
creation of the world. In now calling *that* God’s spirit, which he
before represented as the spirit of living creatures, there is no
contradiction. God sendeth forth that spirit which remains with him
whither he pleases; and as soon as he has sent it forth, all things are
created. In this way, what was his own he makes to be ours. But this
gives no countenance to the old dream of the Manicheeans, which that
filthy dog Servetus has made still worse in our own day. The Manicheeans
said that the soul of man is a particle of the Divine Spirit, and is
propagated from it as the shoot of a tree; but this base man has had the
audacity to assert, that oxen, asses, and dogs, are parts of the divine
essence. The Manichees at least had this pretext for their error, that
the soul was created after the image of God; but to maintain this with
respect to swine and cattle, is in the highest degree monstrous and
detestable. Nothing was farther from the prophet’s intention, than to
divide the *spirit of God* into parts, so that a portion of it should
dwell essentially in every living creature. But he termed that the
*spirit of God* which proceeds from him. By the way, he instructs us,
that it is ours, because it is given us, that it may quicken us. The
amount of what is stated is, that when we see the world daily decaying,
and daily renewed, the life-giving power of God is reflected to us
herein as in a mirror. All the deaths which take place among living
creatures, are just so many examples of our nothingness, so to speak;
and when others are produced and grow up in their room, we have in that
presented to us a renewal of the world. Since then the world daily dies,
and is daily renewed in its various parts, the manifest conclusion is,
that it subsists only by a secret virtue derived from God.

<span id="xiii.viii-p8"></span><span id="xiii.viii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.viii-p9"></span>**31.** *Glory be to Jehovah for ever*
The inspired writer shows for what purpose he has celebrated in the
preceding part of the psalm the power, wisdom, and goodness of God in
his works, namely, to stir up men to praise him. It is no small honor
that God for our sake has so magnificently adorned the world, in order
that we may not only be spectators of this beauteous theater, but also
enjoy the multiplied abundance and variety of good things which are
presented to us in it. Our gratitude in yielding to God the praise which
is his due, is regarded by him as a singular recompense. What the
Psalmist adds, *Let Jehovah rejoice in his works,* is not superfluous;
for he desires that the order which God has established from the
beginning may be continued in the lawful use of his gifts. As we read in
<span id="xiii.viii-p9.1"></span>[Ge
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#006.md)<span id="xiii.viii-p9.1"></span>,
that “it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth,” so when
he sees that the good things which he bestows are polluted by our
corruptions, he ceases to take delight in bestowing them. And certainly
the confusion and disorder which take place, when the elements cease to
perform their office, testify that God, displeased and wearied out, is
provoked to discontinue, and put a stop to the regular course of his
beneficence; although anger and impatience have strictly speaking no
place in his mind. What is here taught is, that he bears the character
of the best of fathers, who takes pleasure in tenderly cherishing his
children, and in bountifully nourishing them. In the following verse it
is shown, that the stability of the world depends on this rejoicing of
God in his works; for did he not give vigor to the earth by his gracious
and fatherly regard, as soon as he looked upon it with a severe
countenance, he would make it tremble, and would burn up the very
mountains.

<span id="xiii.viii-p10"></span><span id="xiii.viii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.viii-p11"></span>**33.** *I will sing to Jehovah whilst I
live* Here the Psalmist points out to others their duty by his own
example, declaring, that throughout the whole course of his life he will
proclaim the praises of God without ever growing weary of that exercise.
The only boundary which he fixes to the celebration of God’s praises is
death; not that the saints, when they pass from this world into another
state of existence, desist from this religious duty, but because the end
for which we are created is, that the divine name may be celebrated by
us on the earth. Conscious of his unworthiness to offer to God so
precious a sacrifice, he humbly prays, (verse 34,) *that the praises
which he will sing to God may be acceptable to him,* although they
proceed from polluted lips. It is true, that there is nothing more
acceptable to God, nor any thing of which he more approves, than the
publication of his praises, even as there is no service which he more
peculiarly requires us to perform. But as our uncleanness defiles that
which in its own nature is most holy, the prophet with good reason
betakes himself to the goodness of God, and on this ground alone pleads
that He would accept of his song of praise. Accordingly, the Apostle, in
<span id="xiii.viii-p11.1"></span>[Heb
13:15](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#015.md)<span
id="xiii.viii-p11.1"></span> teaches that our sacrifices of thanksgiving
are well pleasing to God, when they are offered to him through Christ.
It being however the case, that whilst all men indiscriminately enjoy
the benefits of God, there are yet very few who look to the author of
them, the prophet subjoins the clause, *I will rejoice in the Lord;*
intimating, that this is a rare virtue; for nothing is more difficult
than to call home the mind from those wild and erratic joys, which
disperse themselves through heaven and earth in which they evanish, that
it may keep itself fixed on God alone.

<span id="xiii.viii-p12"></span><span id="xiii.viii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.viii-p13"></span>**35.** *Let sinners perish from the
earth* This imprecation depends on the last clause of the 31st verse,
*Let Jehovah rejoice in his works* As the wicked infect the world with
their pollutions, the consequence is, that God has less delight in his
own workmanship, and is even almost displeased with it. It is
impossible, but that this uncleanness, which, being extended and
diffused through every part of the world, vitiates and corrupts such a
noble product of his hands, must be offensive to him. Since then the
wicked, by their perverse abuse of God’s gifts, cause the world in a
manner to degenerate and fall away from its first original, the prophet
justly desires that they may be exterminated, until the race of them
entirely fail. Let us then take care so to weigh the providence of God,
as that being wholly devoted to obeying him, we may rightly and purely
use the benefits which he sanctities for our enjoying them. Farther, let
us be grieved, that such precious treasures are wickedly squandered
away, and let us regard it as monstrous and detestable, that men not
only forget their Maker, but also, as it were, purposely turn to a
perverse and an unworthy end, whatever good things he has bestowed upon
them.

<span id="xiii-p3"></span> “For regularity of composition, richness of
imagery, sublimity of sentiment, and elegance and perspicuity of
diction, this hymn is perhaps the principal poem in the whole collection
of these inspired songs. As there is no allusion in it to the Mosaic
ritual, nor any mention of the deliverance of the Israelites from Egypt,
it should seem that it was of an earlier age than the Exodus. It
consists of parts sung alternately by two companies. The parts are
easily distinguished, inasmuch as one Semichorus always speaks of God in
the third person, the other addresses him in the second.” — *Horsley.*

<span id="fn_176"></span>[177](cc11012.htm#fr_176.md) <span
id="xiii.i-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.i-p3"></span> “It is a singular circumstance,” says
Horsley, “in the composition of this psalm, that each of the parts of
the First Semichorus after the first, \[that is, verses 2, 3, 4, 5, 10,
13, 14, 19,\] begins with a participle. And these participles are
accusatives, agreeing with <span id="xiii.i-p3.1"></span>יהוה, the
object of the verb <span id="xiii.i-p3.2"></span>ברכי, at the beginning
of the whole psalm. Bless Jehovah — putting on — extending — laying —
constituting — travelling — making — setting — sending — watering —
making — making. Thus, this transitive verb, in the opening of the
psalm, extending its government through the successive parts of the same
semichorus, except the last, unites them all in one long period. As this
singular artifice of composition seems to be the characteristic of a
particular species of ode, in this psalm, I have scrupulously conformed
to it in my translation, at the expense of the elegance of my English
style.” Calvin, for the most part, translates these words as
participles, but in the nominative case.

the supreme, yet the superior or middle region of the air, which is here
described as an upper story in a house laid firm with beams, (accounting
the earth and the region of air about that as the lower room,) and this

above the expansion or lower region of the air, which divides the waters
from the waters. This is most evident by verse 13, where God is said to
‘water the mountains <span id="xiii.i-p4.8"></span>מעליותיו, *from*
these *his upper rooms,* these clouds whence the rain descends.’ In
them, saith the Psalmist, ‘the beams of these upper rooms were laid,’
*i.e.,* whereas in the building of an *upper story,* there must be some
walls or pillars to support the weight of it, and in that the *beams*
are laid, God here by his own miraculous immediate power *laid,* and
ever since supported these upper rooms, there being nothing there but
*waters* to support them, and those we know the most fluid tottering
body, not able to support itself; and therefore that is another work of
his divine power, that the *waters* which are so fluid, and unable to
contain themselves within their own bounds, should yet hang in the
middle of the air, and be as walls or pillars to support that region of
air, which is itself another fluid body ” — *Hammond.* Fry, after
quoting Dr Geddes’ version, — “Flooring his chambers with waters,” and
Bishop Horsley’s “Laying the floors of his chambers upon the waters,”
goes on to say: — “After referring, however, to the different places
where the word occurs, and considering the structure of ancient
buildings, I conceive the allusion to be to the roof, or contignated
frame of the house. <span id="xiii.i-p4.9"></span>[Ge
19:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#008.md)<span id="xiii.i-p4.9"></span>,
seems decisive. We seem to lose somewhat of the beauty of the original
by translating <span id="xiii.i-p4.10"></span>עליות too literally. It
signifies certainly, *upper rooms,* or *stories*; but the allusion is
not to these on account of their situation, but as the part of the house
principally inhabited by its owner, the lower parts of eastern houses
being used for offices. — See Parkhurst and authors there quoted:
compare <span id="xiii.i-p4.11"></span>[Psalm
18](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#000.md)<span id="xiii.i-p4.11"></span>, ‘He
set darkness his veil around him, — his canopy the waters and thick
mists of the clouds.’” Fry’s translation is, “And framing his habitation
with waters.”

<span id="xiii.ii-p4"></span> Calvin here renders *mountains* and
*valleys* in the nominative case. In our English version they are
rendered in the accusative: “They go up by the mountains, they go down
by the valleys.” “It is not here certain,” says Hammond, “whether <span
id="xiii.ii-p4.1"></span>הרים, *mountains,* and <span
id="xiii.ii-p4.2"></span>בקעות, *valleys* or *plains,* be to be read in
the nominative or in the accusative case. If they be in the nominative,
then we must read as in a parenthesis, (‘the mountains ascend, the
plains or valleys slink down,’) joining the end of the verse, ‘unto the
place,’ etc. to ‘haste away,’ verse 7, thus: The waters once stood above
the mountains, — those places which now are such; — but at the uttering
God’s *voice,* they fled and hasted away (the mountains ascending and
the valleys descending) unto the place which thou hast prepared for
them.’ Thus the LXX. and Latin understand it, <span
id="xiii.ii-p4.3"></span>ἀναβαίνουσιν ὄρη καταβαίνουσι πεδία, ‘<span
id="xiii.ii-p4.4"></span>ascendunt montes, et descendunt campi,’ ‘the
mountains ascend, and the plains descend,’ referring to the change that
was made in the earth from being perfectly round and encompassed with
waters, into that inequality wherein now it is, great mountains in some
parts, and great cavities in other parts, wherein the waters were
disposed, which before covered the face of the earth. But they may be
more probably in the accusative case, and then <span
id="xiii.ii-p4.5"></span>מים, the ‘waters,’ verse 6, which were
understood, verse 7, though not mentioned, (for it was the waters that
there fled and hasted away,) must be here continued also, viz., that
‘the waters <span id="xiii.ii-p4.6"></span>יעלו, ascend,’ or ‘climb the
mountains,’ and <span id="xiii.ii-p4.7"></span>ירדו, ‘descend,’ or ‘fall
down upon the valleys,’ or ‘fissures,’ or ‘hollow places,’ ditches, and
the like receptacles of waters, (for so <span
id="xiii.ii-p4.8"></span>בקוע now signifies among the Rabbins.) And this
sense the Chaldee follows, ‘They ascend from the abyss to the mountains,
and they descend into the valleys, to the place,’ etc. And this is the
clearest exposition of it, rendering an account of the course of
*waters,* since the gathering of them together in the ocean, that from
thence they are, by the power of God, directed to pass through
subterranean *meatus* to the uppermost parts of the earth, the hills and
mountains, where they break forth in springs, and then, by their natural
weight, descend, and either find or make channels, by which they run
into the ocean again, that <span id="xiii.ii-p4.9"></span>מקום, *place*,
which God hath hewed out as a receptacle for them; and by their thus
passing, they are profitable for the use of men, in watering the cattle,
and the fruits that grow in the earth, verse 10, etc.”

<span id="xiii.iii-p4"></span> The wild ass differs from the tame only
by being stronger and nimbler, more courageous and lively. Wild asses
are still found in considerable numbers in the deserts of Great Tartary,
in Persia, Syria, the islands of the Archipelago, and throughout
Mauritania. They are gregarious, and have been known to assemble by
hundreds and thousands. It has been observed of these animals that,
though dull and stupid, they are remarkable for their instinct in
discovering in the arid desert the way to rivers, brooks, or fountains
of water, so that the thirsty traveler has only to observe and follow
their steps, in order to his being led to the cooling stream.

<span id="xiii.iv-p4"></span> “<span id="xiii.iv-p4.2"></span>חסידה*,
chasidah,* the original word for *the stork,* is from <span
id="xiii.iv-p4.3"></span>חסד, *piety,* <span
id="xiii.iv-p4.4"></span>*beneficence,* because, says Bythner, “the
stork nourishes, supports, and carries on its back, when weary, its aged
parents.” Storks are a species of birds very numerous in Palestine, and
other eastern countries. Doubdan thus speaks of them in his account of a
journey from Cana to Nazareth in Galilee, (page 513,) “All these fields
were so filled with flocks of storks, that they appeared quite white
with them, there being above a thousand in each flock, and when they
rose and hovered in the air they seemed like clouds. The evening they
rest in trees.” This account is confirmed by Dr Shaw, who informs us,
that as he lay at anchor near Mount Carmel, he saw “three flights of
them, some of which were more open and scattered, with larger intervals
between them; others were closer and more compact, as in the flight of
wrens and other birds, each of which took up more than three hours in
passing by us, extending itself at the same time more than half a mile
in breadth.” — See his *Travels,* volume 2, page 269. The stork
constructs her nest with exquisite skill of dry twigs of trees and
coarse grass from the marsh. But instead of confining herself to one
situation, she builds it sometimes on the highest parts of old ruins and
houses, — sometimes in the canals of ancient aqueducts, and sometimes on
the tops of the eastern mosques and dwelling-houses; so very familiar is
she by being never molested, the Mahometans accounting it profane to
kill, or even to hurt, or disturb this species of bird, because of their
important services in clearing the country of serpents, and other
venomous animals, on which they feed. She frequently retires from the
noise and bustle of the town to the adjacent field, selecting the
highest tree of the forest on which to build her nest, and always
preferring the fir, when it is equally suitable to her purpose — *Ibid.*
volume 2, page 272. Harmer remarks, that <span
id="xiii.iv-p4.5"></span>חסידה, c*hasidah,* seems to signify *the heron*
as well as *the stork*; and Dr Adam Clarke is of opinion, that *the
heron* is here meant, conceiving the description of its making the
fir-tree its house, as other bird.make their nests in the cedars of
Lebanon, to be more agreeable to its natural history than to that of the
stork properly speaking. He farther observes, that Aquila, who has given
us an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament, and who is said to
have been exquisitely skilled in the original language, always
understood the *chasidah* to mean *the heron,* rather than *the stork.*
“But,” he adds, “the two species resemble each other so much, that it is
not improbable but one Hebrew word stood for both,” and refers to
Doubdan, who supposes that storks in Palestine roost in trees —
*Harmer*’*s Observations,* volume 2, page 465, and volume 3, page 338.

<span id="xiii.iv-p5"></span> “<span id="xiii.iv-p5.1"></span>On,
chevreux.” — *Fr*. *marg.* “Or, the kids.” Calvin, by giving two
different translations of the original word, appears to have been at a
loss as to the animal meant. “The animal here intended,” says Mant, “is
the Ibex or Rock Goat, a species of wild goat, deriving its Hebrew name
from the wonderful manner in which it *mounts* to the top of the highest
rocks, to which quality the sacred writers allude in the other two
passages where the word occurs as well as in this. — See <span
id="xiii.iv-p5.2"></span>[1Sa
24:3](../../../bib/kjv/sa1024.htm#003.md)<span id="xiii.iv-p5.2"></span>;
<span id="xiii.iv-p5.3"></span>[Job
39:1](../../../bib/kjv/job039.htm#001.md)<span id="xiii.iv-p5.3"></span>.
To this quality natural historians bear abundant witness. Mr Cox thus
describes the action of the Ibex, in ascending the mountains of
Switzerland: — ‘He mounts a perpendicular rock of fifteen feet at three
leaps, or rather three successive bounds of five feet each. It does not
seem as if he found any footing on the rock, appearing to touch it
merely to be repelled, like an elastic substance striking against a hard
body. He is not supposed to take more than three successive leaps in
this manner. If he is between two rocks which are near each other, and
wants to reach the top, he leaps from the side of one rock to the other
alternately, till he has obtained the summit.’”

<span id="xiii.iv-p6"></span> “<span id="xiii.iv-p6.1"></span>Ou,
connils.” — *Fr* *marg.* “Or, the conies, *or* rabbits.” The Hebrew name
of this animal, <span id="xiii.iv-p6.2"></span>שפן, *shaphan,* from the
verbs <span id="xiii.iv-p6.3"></span>שפן, *shaphan,* or <span
id="xiii.iv-p6.4"></span>ספן, *saphan, to hide,* seems to indicate a
creature of a timid and harmless disposition. Feeble, and apprehensive
of danger, it seeks a shelter among the fissures of the rocks, where it
may be concealed from its enemies. To this circumstance allusion is here
made; and it is also referred to by Solomon, (<span
id="xiii.iv-p6.5"></span>[Pr
30:26](../../../bib/kjv/pro030.htm#026)<span id="xiii.iv-p6.5"></span>.md)
“The shaphans are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the
rocks.” It is evident from these words, that the shaphan is gregarious.
What particular animal then is indicated by this name? Calvin, from
giving the original term, one translation in the text, and a different
one on the margin, seems to have been uncertain as to the species of
animal intended, and on this point considerable variety of opinion has
obtained. Some copies of the Septuagint have *hedgehogs,* and others,
*hares,* the former being probably the right reading, as the Vulgate
agrees with it. Bochart supposed the *jerboa,* or *jumping-mouse,* to be
meant. But to this it has been justly objected, that the jerboa always
digs its habitation in the smoother places of the desert, especially
where the soil is fixed gravel; that it is not gregarious, nor
distinguished by feebleness, which it supplies by its wisdom. Nor can it
be the coney, or rabbit, that is here referred to; for, instead of
seeking a habitation among the rocks, it delights to burrow in the sandy
downs; and if it sometimes digs a place of shelter among the rocks, it
is only where the openings are filled with earth. It is now pretty
generally agreed, that *the shaphan* is the *Daman Israel,* as suggested
by Dr Shaw. “The Daman Israel,” says this traveler, “is an animal
likewise of Mount Lebanus, though common in other places of this
country. It is a harmless creature, of the same size and quality with
the rabbit, and with the like incurvating posture and disposition of the
fore-teeth. But it is of a browner color with smaller eyes, and a head
more pointed, like the marmots. The fore-feet likewise are short, and
the hinder are nearly as long in proportion as those of the jerboa.
Though this animal is known to burrow sometimes in the ground, yet as
its usual residence and refuge is in the holes and clifts of the rocks,
we have so far a more presumptive proof, that this creature may be the
shaphan of the Scriptures, than the jerboa. I could not learn why it was
called *Daman Israel, i.e., Israel*’*s lamb,* as those words are
interpreted.” Travels, volume 2, pages 160, 161. It is called in Amhara,
“Ashkoko.” Bruce confirms Dr Shaw’s opinion. He identifies the animals
by the several other particulars mentioned in Scripture, as well as by
their attachment to rocks, and their constant residence in holes and
caves, as noticed in this psalm. See also Paxton’s Illustrations of
Scripture, volume 2, pages 204-209.

id="xiii.v-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xiii.v-p3"></span> “What is here said of the *lions*
peculiarly, that they ‘roar after their prey, and seek their meat from
God,’ may be illustrated by what is observed of those creatures, that to
their great strength and greediness and rapacity, they are not
proportionably provided with swiftness of body to pursue in the desert
those beasts on which they prey, nor yet so quick-scented, as to be able
to follow and trace them to their places of repose. It hath therefore
been necessary to the providing for these animals, that some supply
should be made to these defects by some other way. And it hath been
affirmed by some, that their very *roaring* is useful to them for this
end, and that when they cannot overtake their prey, they do by that
fierce noise so astonish and amaze the poor beasts, that they fall down
before them. If this have that truth, which it professes to have, it
gives a clear account both of the phrase of *roaring after their prey,*
and of *seeking it* from God — of *roaring,* as being able to do nothing
else toward the getting it, but only thus to frighten the hearers, and
express his own hunger and want.” — *Hammond.*

version is correct, “My meditation of *or* on him shall be sweet;” and
with this the last clause of the verse would well accord, “I will be
glad in the Lord,” which is an effect of the sweetness felt in
meditating upon him. But all the ancient versions give the former
