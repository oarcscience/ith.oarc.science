<span id="xxviii-p1"></span>PSALM 119

<span id="xxviii-p2"></span>As this psalm treats of various matters, it
is difficult to give an epitome of its contents. There are, however, two
things which the prophet mainly aims at; the exhorting of the children
of God to follow godliness and a holy life; and the prescribing of the
rule, and pointing out the form of the true worship of God, so that the
faithful may devote themselves wholly to the study of the Law. Along
with these he frequently blends promises for the purpose of animating
the worshippers of God to live more justly and piously; and, at the same
time, he introduces complaints respecting the impious contempt of the
Law, lest they should become tainted by bad examples. In short, he
frequently passes from one topic to another, and prosecutes no one
particular subject continuously;  <span
id="fr_394"></span>[395](#fn_394.md) and therefore it will be best to
discuss each subject in its proper place.

<span id="xxviii.i"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p1"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
119:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#001.md)<span
id="xxviii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p2"></span>**א 1.** Blessed are they who are upright,
 <span id="fr_395"></span>[396](#fn_395.md) in their way, walking in the
law of Jehovah. **א 2.** Blessed are they who, keeping his testimonies,
seek him with all their heart. **א 3.** Surely they do not work
iniquity, who walk in his ways. **א** **4.** Thou hast commanded that
thy statutes should be observed carefully  <span
id="fr_396"></span>[397](#fn_396.md) **א 5.** I wish that my ways may be
directed to the observing of thy statutes! **א 6.** Then I shall not be
ashamed, when I have respect to all thy precepts. **א 7.** I will praise
thee in the uprightness of my heart, when I shall have learned the
judgments of thy righteousness. **א 8.** I will observe thy statutes: do
not forsake me very far.  <span id="fr_397"></span>[398](#fn_397.md)

<span id="xxviii.i-p6"></span> 

<span id="xxviii.i-p7"></span>Some call this the octonary psalm, because
that, through every successive eight verses, the initial words of each
line begin with the same letter in alphabetical order. That this was
done to aid the memory, may be gathered from each part containing a
doctrine, which ought to form a theme of constant meditation among the
children of God. For the purpose, therefore, of rendering it less
irksome to the reader, the prophet has distinguished every successive
eight verses by their beginning each with the corresponding letter of
the Hebrew alphabet, and thus all excuses, on the score of ignorance,
are removed, even from the callous and slothful. This help does not
extend to those who read it in other languages; but the principle must
not be overlooked, that the doctrine exhibited in this psalm should be
carefully studied by all the children of God, and treasured up in their
hearts, to render them the more conversant with it. Touching the author,
I assert nothing, because it cannot be ascertained, even by probable
conjecture, who he was; and expositors are agreed that no satisfactory
conclusion can be arrived at in the matter. As David surpassed all
others in point of poetical and devotional talent, I will not scruple
occasionally to insert his name.  <span
id="fr_398"></span>[399](#fn_398.md)

<span id="xxviii.i-p9"></span>It may be proper to take notice of certain
terms which frequently occur in the psalm. Of the term <span
id="xxviii.i-p9.1"></span>תורה, *torah,* I say nothing, which, having
its derivation from a word which signifies to *instruct,* is yet
uniformly taken for *law.* Some of the Rabbis affirm that <span
id="xxviii.i-p9.2"></span>חוקים, *chukim,* signifies statutes, or
divinely appointed rites, the, reason of which is very obvious. They say
that <span id="xxviii.i-p9.3"></span>פקדים, *phikudim,* denotes those
precepts which relate to natural justice. It is certain that <span
id="xxviii.i-p9.4"></span>משפטים, *mishpatim,* signifies commandments,
because this is proved by the etymology of the word. As to <span
id="xxviii.i-p9.5"></span>עדות, *edoth,* the Hebrews understand it of
the doctrine of the law, but with the certain indication, pointing out
to us that it is comprehensive of the manner in which God enters into
covenant with his people. The precepts of the law are denominated
judgments and righteousness, to inform us that God enjoins nothing
except what is right and just, and that mankind ought to seek for no
other rule for the perfecting of holiness, but what consists in
regulating their life by rendering obedience to the law. The meaning is
almost synonymous when they are called *the ways of the Lord,*
intimating that those who do not depart from the direction of the law,
may safely conclude that they are in no danger of going astray. The
ordinances of God, and the edicts offerings, have the term <span
id="xxviii.i-p9.6"></span>חוקים, *chukim,* applied to them
indiscriminately, and,<span id="xxviii.i-p9.7"></span>פקודים ,
*phikudim,* refers to different kinds of justice, as is manifest from
many parts of Scripture which demonstrates that there is no foundation
for the subtle distinction and difference formerly noticed. And in this
psalm almost all these terms are synonym as the context will show.
 <span id="fr_399"></span>[400](#fn_399.md) To procure greater respect for
the law, the prophet adorns it with a variety of titles, taking care
constantly to enjoin upon us the same doctrine. I now proceed to the
consideration of the contents of the psalm.

<span id="xxviii.i-p21"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p22"></span>**1** *Blessed are they who are upright*
In these words the prophet sets forth the same paradox which we met with
at the commencement of the Book of Psalms. All men naturally aspire
after happiness, but instead of searching for it in the right path, they
designedly prefer wandering up and down through endless by-paths, to
their ruin and destruction. The Holy Spirit deservedly condemns this
apathy and blindness. And but for man’s cupidity, which, with brutish
impetuosity, hurries him in the opposite direction, the meaning of the
words would appear quite plain to him. And the further a man wanders
from God, the happier does he imagine himself to be; and hence all
treat, as a fable, what the Holy Spirit declares about true piety and
the service of God. This is a doctrine which scarcely one among a
hundred receives.

<span id="xxviii.i-p23"></span>The term *way,* is here put for the
manner, or course and way of life: and hence he calls those upright in
their way, whose sincere and uniform desire it is to practice
righteousness, and to devote their life to this purpose. In the next
clause of the verse, he specifics more clearly, that a godly and
righteous life consists *in walking in the law of God* If a person
follow his own humor and caprice, he is certain to go astray; and even
should he enjoy the applause of the whole world, he will only weary
himself with very vanity. But it may be asked, whether the prophet
excludes from the hope of happiness all who do not worship God
perfectly? Were this his meaning, it would follow that none except
angels alone would be happy, seeing that the perfect observance of the
law is to be found in no part, of the earth. The answer is easy: When
uprightness is demanded of the children of God, they do not lose the
gracious remission of their sins, in which their salvation alone
consists. While, then, the servants of God are happy, they still need to
take refuge in his mercy, because their uprightness is not complete. In
this manner are they who faithfully observe the law of God said to be
truly happy; and thus is fulfilled that which is declared in <span
id="xxviii.i-p23.1"></span>[Ps
32:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#002.md)<span id="xxviii.i-p23.1"></span>,
“Blessed are they to whom God imputeth not sins.” In the second verse,
the same doctrine is confirmed more fully, by pronouncing blessed, not.
such as are wise in their own conceit, or assume a sort of fantastical
holiness, but those who dedicate themselves to the covenant of God, and
yield obedience to the dictates of hits law. Farther, by these words, he
tells us that God is by no means satisfied with mere external service,
for he demands the sincere and honest affection of the heart. And
assuredly, if God be the sole judge and disposer of our life:, the truth
must occupy the principal place in our heart, because it is not
sufficient to have our hands and feet only enlisted in his service.

<span id="xxviii.i-p24"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p25"></span>**3.** *Surely they do not work iniquity*
The statement, that they who follow God as their guide do not work
iniquity, may seem to be a mere common-place, and universally admitted
truth. The prophet has two reasons for making it; first, to teach us
that our life must be entirely under the direction of God; and,
secondly, that we may more diligently and carefully attend to his
doctrine. It is acknowledged by every one, that those who render
obedience to God are in no danger of going astray, and yet every one is
found turning aside to his own ways. Does not such licentiousness or
presumption palpably demonstrate that they have a greater regard for
their own devices than for the unerring law of God? And after all, as
often as a man happens to fall, is not the plea of inadvertence
instantly alleged, as if none ever sinned knowingly and voluntarily; or
as if the law of God, which is an antidote to all delinquencies, because
it keeps all our vicious propensities in check, did not furnish us with
sufficient wisdom to put us upon our guard? The prophet, therefore, very
justly declares, that those who are instructed in the law of God, cannot
set up the plea of ignorance when they fall into sin, seeing they are
willfully blind. Were they to attend carefully to God’s voice, they
would be well fortified against all the snares of Satan. To strike them
with terror, he informs them in the fourth verse, that God demands a
rigid observance of the law; from which it may be gathered, that he will
not suffer the contemners of it to escape with impunity. Besides, by
speaking to God in the second person, he places him before our eyes as a
Judge.

<span id="xxviii.i-p26"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p27"></span>**5** *I wish that my ways may be
directed* The original word <span id="xxviii.i-p27.1"></span>כון, *kun,*
is sometimes rendered to *establish,* and, accordingly, it may seem as
if the prophet were soliciting for himself the virtue of perseverance. I
am rather inclined to understand it as signifying to *direct;* for,
although God’s plainly instructing us in his law, the obtuseness of our
understanding, and the perversity of our hearts, constantly need the
direction of his Spirit. Our main desire, therefore, ought to be for an
understanding wisely regulated by the law of God, and also for a docile
and obedient heart. Next, he adds, if a man carefully observe the law of
God, he need be under no apprehension that he will ever regret what he
has done or undertaken to do. The word *respect* intimates, that we must
not be influenced by our own designs, nor decide, according to Carnal
reason, what we are to do, but must at once come to the determination,
that they who turn not aside, either to the right hand or the left, from
the observance of God’s commandments, are indeed in the right path. They
who reverently respect his law, may not escape the censure of the great
bulk of mankind, yet the prophet declares, that *They shall not be
ashamed,* because they have a good conscience in the presence of God and
the angels, and, with the approval of this celestial assembly, they are
well satisfied and contented; for if they depended upon the opinion of
the world, their courage would presently fail. He says, *all thy
precepts,* intimating, that among the snares of Satan, amid such thick
darkness and so great insensibility as ours, the utmost vigilance and
caution are necessary, if we would aim at being entirely exempted from
blame. Wherefore, in all that we do, we must endeavor to have the law
before us, to keep us from falling.

<span id="xxviii.i-p28"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p29"></span>**7.** *I will praise thee* He affirms it
to be a singular instance of the loving-kindness of God, if a person has
made considerable proficiency in his law. As a token and testimony of
this, he here puts the giving of thanks to God; as if he should say,
Lord, thou wilt confer upon me an inestimable blessing, if thou instruct
me in thy law. It follows, therefore, that nothing in this life is more
to be desired than this; and my fervent prayer is, that we may be fairly
and fully convinced of the truth of it. For while searching carefully
after such things as we deem advantageous to us, we do not overlook any
earthly convenience, and yet we neglect that which is of most
importance. The phrase, the *judgments of thy righteousness,* is the
same with the commandments, in which perfect righteousness is
comprehended; and thus the prophet commends God’s law on account of the
thorough perfection of the doctrine contained in it. From this verse we
learn, that none will praise God unfeignedly and cordially but he who
has made such proficiency in his school as to mold his life into
subjection to him. It is vain to make a pretense of praising God with
the mouth and the tongue if we dishonor him by our life. Hence the
prophet very justly here makes the fruit of genuine piety to consist in
celebrating the praises of God without hypocrisy.

<span id="xxviii.i-p30"></span><span id="xxviii.i-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p31"></span>**8** *I will observe thy statutes* In
these words he avers it to be his intention to observe the law of God,
but, conscious of his own weakness, he utters a prayer that God would
not deprive him of his grace. The term *forsake* is susceptible of two
interpretations, either that God withdraws his Spirit, or that he
permits his people to be brought low by adversity, as if he had forsaken
them. The latter interpretation agrees best with the context, and is
most in accordance with the phrase immediately subjoined, *very far* The
prophet is not altogether averse to the trial of his faith, only he is
apprehensive lest it might fail were the trial to be too long
protracted, and therefore he desires to be treated with tenderness in
his infirmity.,’ O God! thou sees my frame of mind, and, as I am but a
man, do not conceal too long from me the tokens of thy favor, or defer
helping me longer than is proper for me, lest, imagining myself to be
forsaken of thee, I turn aside from the direct pursuit of godliness.”

<span id="xxviii.ii"></span>

<span id="xxviii.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxviii.ii-p5"></span><span id="xxviii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.ii-p6"></span>**9.** *Wherewith shall a young man
cleanse his way?* In this place he repeats, in different words, the same
truth which he formerly advanced, That, however much men may pique
themselves upon their own works, there is nothing pure in their life
until they have made a complete surrender of themselves to the word of
the Lord. The more effectually to excite them to this, he produces, in
an especial manner, the example of children or youths. In mentioning
these, he by no means gives an unbridled license to those who have
arrived at mature years, or who are aged, as if they were competent to
regulate their own life, and as if their own prudence served as a law to
them; but because youth puts men where two ways meet, and renders it
imperative for them to select the course of life which they mean to
follow, he declares that, when a person sets about the regulation of his
life, no advice will prove of any advantage, unless he adopts the law of
God as his rule and guide. In this way the prophet stimulates men to an
early and seasonable regulation of their manners, and not to delay doing
so any longer, agreeably to the words of Solomon, “Remember thy Creator
in thy youth, ere the days of trouble come, and the years which shall be
grief unto thee,” <span id="xxviii.ii-p6.1"></span>[Ec
12:1](../../../bib/kjv/ecc012.htm#001.md)<span id="xxviii.ii-p6.1"></span>
 <span id="fr_401"></span>[402](#fn_401.md) They who defer from time to
time become hardened in their vicious practices, and arrive at mature
years, when it is too late to attempt a reformation. There is another
reason, arising from the fact, of the carnal propensities being very
powerful in youth, requiring a dortble restraint; and the more they are
inclined to excess, the greater is the necessity for curbing their
licentiousness. The prophet, therefore, not without reason, exhorts them
particularly to attend to the observance of the law. We may reason from
the greater to the less; for if the law of God possesses the power of
restraining the impetuosity of youth, so as to preserve pure and upright
all who take it for their guide, then, assuredly, when they come to
maturity, and their irregular desires are considerably abated, it will
prove the best antidote for correcting their vices. The reason,
therefore, of so much evil prevailing in the world, arises from men
wallowing in their own impurity, and being disposed to yield more to
their own inclination than to heavenly instruction. The only sure
protection is, to regulate ourselves according to God’s word. Some, wise
in their own conceit, throw themselves into the snares of Satan, others,
from listlessness and languor, live a vile and wicked life.

<span id="xxviii.ii-p8"></span><span id="xxviii.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.ii-p9"></span>**10.** *With my whole heart* Conscious
of the integrity of his heart, the prophet still implores the help of
God, that he might not stumble by reason of his infirmity. He makes no
boast of self-preparation, as if he had spontaneously begun to inquire
after God, but in praising the grace which he had experienced, he at the
same time aspires after steadfastness to persevere in walking in his
ways. It is folly on the part of the Papists to seize upon this and
similar passages, as if the saints, of their own free will, anticipated
the grace of the Holy Spirit, and afterwards were favored with his aid.
The prophet does not make a division between God and himself, but rather
prays God to continue his work till it is completed, agreeably with what
we are generally taught, to keep God mindful of his benefits until he
accomplish them.

<span id="xxviii.ii-p10"></span>In the meantime, there is good cause for
presenting our supplication to God, to stretch out his hand towards us
when he sees our minds so settled, that we are solicitous of nothing so
much as acting uprightly. And as he elevates us with confidence to ask
the gift of perseverance, when he inspires our hearts with proper
affection towards him, so also does he entreat us for the future not to
sink into a careless and languid state like soldiers who have been
discharged, but seek to be constantly directed by the spirit of wisdom,
and to be sustained by the principles of fortitude and virtue. David
here, from his own example, points out to us a rule, that by how much a
man finds himself succored by God, by so much ought he to be induced the
more carefully and earnestly to implore the continuance of his aid; for
unless he restrain us, we will instantly wander and go astray. This
sentiment is more explicitly stated in the original word <span
id="xxviii.ii-p10.1"></span>תשגני, *tashqeni,* which is in the passive
voice, and signifies, *to be led astray*  <span
id="fr_402"></span>[403](#fn_402.md) From the import of the term, I do not
mean to establish the doctrine that God secretly incites us to commit
sin, but only to let my readers know, that such is our liability to err,
that we immediately relapse into sin the instant he leaves us to
ourselves. This passage also admonishes us that the man who swerves but
a little from God’s commandments is guilty of going astray.

<span id="xxviii.ii-p12"></span><span id="xxviii.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.ii-p13"></span>**11.** *I have hid thy word in my
heart.* This psalm not being composed for the personal and peculiar use
of the author only, we may therefore understand, that as frequently as
David sets before us his own example, under this model he points out the
course we ought to pursue. Here we are informed that we are well
fortified against the stratagems of Satan when God’s law is deeply
seated in our hearts. For unless it have a fast and firm hold there, we
will readily fall into sin. Among scholars, those whose knowledge is
confined to books, if they have not the book always before them, readily
discover their ignorance; in like manner, if we do not imbibe the
doctrine of God, and are well acquainted with it, Satan will easily
surprise and entangle us in his meshes. Our true safeguard, then, lies
not in a slender knowledge of his law, or in a careless perusal of it,
but in hiding it deeply in our hearts. Here we are reminded, that
however men may be convinced of their own wisdom, they are yet destitute
of all right judgment, except as far as they have God as their teacher.

<span id="xxviii.ii-p14"></span><span id="xxviii.ii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.ii-p15"></span>**12.** *Blessed art thou, O Jehovah!*
Such had been the prophet’s proficiency, that he was not only one of
‘God’s disciples, but also a public teacher of the Church. Nevertheless,
acknowledging himself and all the upright to be only one their journey
till they arrive at the close of life, he fails not to ask for the
spirit of understanding. This passage informs us generally, that if God
do not enlighten us with the spirit of discernment, we are not competent
to behold the light which shines forth from his law, though it be
constantly before us. And thus it happens, that not a few are blind even
when surrounded with the clear revelation of this doctrine, because,
confident in their own perspicacity, they contemn the internal
illumination of the Holy Spirit. Farther, let us learn from this
passage, that none are possessed of such superiority of intellect as not
to admit of constant increase. If the prophet, upon whom God had
conferred so honorable an office as a teacher of the Church, confesses
himself to be only a disciple or scholar, what madness is it for those
who are, greatly behind him in point of attainments not to strain every
nerve to rise to higher excellence? Nor does he depend upon his own
merits for obtaining his requests; he beseeches God to grant them from a
regard to his own glory. This appears from the phraseology by which he
introduces his request, *Blessed art thou, O Jehovah!* intimating, that
his confidence of success originated in God’s being fully entitled to
all praise on account of his unbounded goodness, justice, and mercy.

<span id="xxviii.ii-p16"></span><span id="xxviii.ii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.ii-p17"></span>**13.** *With my lips* In this verse he
declares that the law of God was not only deeply engraven on his own
heart, but that it was his earnest and strenuous endeavor to gain over
many of his fellow-disciples into subjection to God. It is indeed a
heartless matter to speak of the law of God abstractly, as we see
hypocrites do, who talk very fluently about the whole doctrine of
godliness, to which they are entire strangers. What the prophet noticed
above, respecting the affection of the heart for God’s law, he now
likewise applies to the lips. And, immediately afterwards, he again
establishes the truth of what he had asserted about his cordial and
unfeigned endeavors to instruct others; by saying, that he derived no
less pleasure from the doctrine of God than from all the riches of the
world. He indirectly contrasts his holy love for the law, with which he
was inflamed, with the unholy avarice which has taken possession of
almost all the world. “As wealth attracts to itself the hearts of
mankind, so I have taken more exquisite delight in the progress which I
make in the doctrine of godliness, than if I abounded in all manner of
riches.”

<span id="xxviii.ii-p18"></span><span id="xxviii.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.ii-p19"></span>**15.** *In thy precepts* That to which
I formerly adverted must not be forgotten — the prophet’s not making a
boast of his own acquirements, but setting before others an example for
their imitation. We are aware that the majority of mankind are so much
involved in the cares of the world, as to leave no time or leisure for
meditating upon the doctrine of God. To meet this callous indifference,
he very seasonably commends diligence and attention. And even were we
not so ensnared by the world, we know how readily we lose sight of the
law of God, in the daily temptations which suddenly overtake us. It is
not therefore without reason that the prophet exhorts us to constant
exercise, and enjoins us to direct all our energies to the subject of
meditation on God’s precepts. And as the life of men is unstable, being
continually distracted by the carnality of their minds, he declares that
he will consider attentively the *ways of God.* Subsequently, he repeats
the exquisite pleasure he took in this pursuit. For our proficiency in
the law of God will be small, until we cheerfully and heartily set our
minds upon it. And, in fact, the commencement of a good life consists in
God’s law attracting us to him by its sweetness. By the same means the
lusts of the flesh, too, are subdued or mitigated. In our natural state,
what is more agreeable to us than that which is sinful? This will be the
constant tendency of our minds, unless the delight which we feel in the
law carry us in the opposite direction.

senses. They may be read as a separate clause, in this manner: O God!
display thy goodness to thy servant, and thus I shall live, or then I
shall esteem myself happy. Or the verse may form one connected
statement: O God! grant to thy servant the favor that, while I live, I
may keep thy commandments. If the former lection is adopted, then, by
these words, the prophet declares that, without the favor of God, he is
like a dead man; that though he might abound in every thing else, yet he
could not subsist without feeling that God was propitious towards him.
The latter interpretation is preferable, That the prophet asks as a
principal favor, that, while he lives, he may devote himself entirely to
God; being fully persuaded that the grand object of his existence
consists in his exercising himself in his service, an object which he
firmly resolves to pursue. For this reason these two clauses are
connected together, *that I may live, and keep thy word. “I* desire no
other mode of living than that of approving myself to be a true and
faithful servant of God.” All wish God to grant them a prolongation of
their life; a wish after which the whole world ardently aspire, and yet
there is scarcely one among a hundred who reflects upon the purpose for
which he ought to live. To withdraw us from cherishing such irrational
propensities, the prophet here describes the main object of our
existence. He declares it to be owing to the peculiar grace of the Holy
Spirit, that any person keeps the law of God. Had he imagined that the
preparing oneself for the observance of his law depended on his own free
will, then this prayer would have been nothing else than downright
hypocrisy.

<span id="xxviii.iii-p6"></span>Very similar is the doctrine contained
in the next verse. Having acknowledged, that power to keep the law is
imparted to men by God, he, at the same time, adds, that every man is
blind, until he also enlighten the eyes of his understanding. Admitting
that God gives light to us by his word, the prophet here means that we
are blind amid the clearest light, until he remove the veil from our
eyes. When he confesses that his eyes are veiled and shut, rendering him
unable to discern the light of the heavenly doctrine, until God, by the
invisible grace of his Spirit, open them, he speaks as if he were
deploring his own blindness, and that of the whole human race. But,
while God claims this power for himself, he tells us that the remedy is
at hand, provided we do not, by trusting to our own wisdom, reject the
gracious illumination offered to us. Let us learn, too, that we do not
receive the illumination of the Spirit of God to make us contemn the
external word, and take pleasure only in secret inspirations, like many
fanatics, who do not regard themselves spiritual, except they reject the
word of God, and substitute in its place their own wild speculations.
Very different is the prophet’s aim, which is to inform us that our
illumination is to enable us to discern the light of life, that God
manifests by his word. He designates the doctrine of the law, *marvelous
things,*  <span id="fr_403"></span>[404](#fn_403.md) to humble us, to
contemplate with admiration its height; and to convince us the more of
our need of the grace of God, to comprehend the mysteries, which surpass
our limited capacity. From which we infer, that not only the ten
commandments are included in the term la but also the covenant of
eternal salvation, with all its provisions, which God has made. And
knowing, as we do, that Christ, “in whom are hid all the treasures of
knowledge and wisdom,” “is the end of the law,” we need not be surprised
at the prophet commending it, in consequence of the sublime mysteries
which it contains, <span id="xxviii.iii-p7.1"></span>[Col
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003.md)<span id="xxviii.iii-p7.1"></span>;

<span id="xxviii.iii-p8"></span><span id="xxviii.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.iii-p9"></span>**19.** *I am a stranger on the earth.*
It is proper to inquire into the reason for his calling himself a
sojourner and stranger in the world. The great concern of the unholy and
worldly is to spend their life here easily and quietly; but those who
know that they have their journey to pursue, and have their inheritance
reserved for them in heaven, are not engrossed nor entangled with these
perishable things, but aspire after that place to which they are
invited. The meaning may be thus summed up: “Lord, since I must pass
quickly through the earth, what will become of me if I am deprived of
the doctrine of thy law?” We learn from these words from what point we
must commence our journey, if we would go on our way cheerfully unto
God.

<span id="xxviii.iii-p10"></span>Besides, God is said *to conceal his
commandments* from those whose eyes he does not open, because, not being
endued with spiritual vision, in seeing they see not, so that what is
before their eyes is hid from them. And, to demonstrate that he does not
present his request in a careless manner, the prophet adds, that his
affection for the law is most intense; for it is no common ardor which
is expressed by him in the following language, *My soul is rent with the
desire it hath at all times unto thy judgments.* As the man who may
concentrate all his thoughts on one point with such intensity as almost
to deprive him of the power of perception, may be said to be the victim
of his intemperate zeal, so the prophet declares the energy of his mind
to be paralyzed and exhausted by his ardent love for the law.  <span
id="fr_404"></span>[405](#fn_404.md) The clause, *at all times,* is meant
to express his perseverance; for it may occasionally happen that a man
may apply himself with great ardor to the study of the heavenly
doctrine; but it is only temporary-his zeal soon vanishes away.
Steadfastness is therefore necessary, lest, through weariness, we become
faint in our minds.

<span id="xxviii.iii-p12"></span><span id="xxviii.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.iii-p13"></span>**21.** *Thou hast destroyed the
proud.* Others render it:, *Thou hast rebuked the proud;* a translation
of which the Hebrew term <span id="xxviii.iii-p13.1"></span>גער*, gaar,*
admits when the letter <span id="xxviii.iii-p13.2"></span>ב*, beth,* is
joined with it in construction; but this being awaiting, it is better to
render it *destroy*  <span id="fr_405"></span>[406](#fn_405.md) It makes,
however, little difference to the main drift of the passage, there being
no doubt that the intention of the prophet is, to inform us that God’s
judgments instructed him to apply his mind to the study of the law; and
certainly this is an exercise which we ought on no account to defer till
God visit us with chastisement.. But when we behold him taking vengeance
upon the wicked, and the despisers of his word, we must be stupid,
indeed, if his rod do not teach us wisdom; and, doubtless, it is an
instance of special kindness on God’s part, to spare us, and only to
terrify us from afar, that he may bring us to himself without injuring
or chastising us at all.

<span id="xxviii.iii-p15"></span>It is not without reason that he
denominates all unbelievers *proud,* because it is true faith alone
which humbles us, and all rebellion is the offspring of pride. From this
we learn how profitable it is to consider carefully and attentively the
judgments of God, by which he overthrows such haughtiness. When the weak
in faith see the wicked rise in furious. opposition against God,
arrogantly casting off all restraint, and holding all religion in
derision with impunity, they begin to question whether there be a God
who sits as judge in heaven. God may, for a time, wink at this:
by-and-bye, we witness him setting forth some indication of his
judgment, to convince us that he hath not in vain uttered threatening
against the violators of his law; and we ought to bear in mind that all
who depart from him are reprobate.

<span id="xxviii.iii-p16"></span>Let it be carefully observed that, *by
wandering from his commandments,* is not meant all kinds of
transgression indiscriminately, but that unbridled licentiousness which
proceeds from impious contempt of God. It is, indeed, given as a general
sentence, that

<span id="xxviii.iii-p17"></span>*“every* one is cursed who continueth
not in all  
things which are written,” <span id="xxviii.iii-p17.2"></span>[De
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026.md)<span
id="xxviii.iii-p17.2"></span>

<span id="xxviii.iii-p18"></span>But as Godwin his paternal kindness,
bears with those who fail through infirmity of the flesh, so here we
must understand these judgments to be expressly executed upon the wicked
and reprobate; and their end, as Isaiah declares, is,

<span id="xxviii.iii-p19"></span>*“*that the inhabitants of the earth
may learn righteousness,”  
(<span id="xxviii.iii-p19.2"></span>[Isa
26:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#009.md)<span
id="xxviii.iii-p19.2"></span>)

<span id="xxviii.iii-p20"></span><span id="xxviii.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.iii-p21"></span>**22.** *Remove from me reproach* This
verse may admit of two senses: Let the children of God walk as
circumspectly as it is possible for them to do, they will not escape
being liable to many slanders, and therefore they have good reason to
petition God to protect the unfeigned godliness which they practice
against poisonous tongues. The following meaning may not inappropriately
be given to the passage: O Lord, since I am conscious to myself, and
thou art a witness of my unfeigned integrity, do not permit the
unrighteous to sully my reputation, by laying unfounded accusations to
my charge. But the meaning will be more complete if we read it as
forming one continued sentence: O God, permit not the ungodly to mock me
for endeavoring to keep thy law. For this impiety has been rampant in
the world even from the beginning, that the sincerity of God’s
worshippers has been matter of reproach and derision; even as, at this
day, the same reproaches are still cast upon God’s children, as if not
satisfied with the common mode of living, they aspired being wiser than
others. That which was spoken by Isaiah must now be accomplished,
“Behold I and my children, whom thou hast given me to be for a sign;” so
that God’s children, with Christ their head, are, among the profane, as
persons to be wondered at. Accordingly, Peter testifies that they charge
us with madness for not following their ways, (<span
id="xxviii.iii-p21.1"></span>[1Pe
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#004.md)<span
id="xxviii.iii-p21.1"></span>;) and as this reproach — the becoming the
subjects of ridicule on account of their unfeigned affection for God’s
law — tends to the dishonor of his name, the prophet very justly demands
the suppression of all these taunts; and Isaiah also, by his own
example, directs us to flee to this refuge, because, although the wicked
may arrogantly pour out their blasphemies on the earth, yet God sitteth
in heaven as our judge.

<span id="xxviii.iii-p22"></span>In the following verse, he states more
plainly that it was not in vain he besought God to vindicate him from
such calumnies; for he was held in derision, not only by the common
people, and by the most abandoned of mankind, but also by the chief men,
who sat as judges. The term, *to sit,* imports that they had spoken
injuriously and unjustly of him, not merely in their houses and at their
tables, but publicly and on the very judgment-seat, where it behooved
them to execute justice, and render to every one his due. The particle
<span id="xxviii.iii-p22.1"></span>גם, *gam,* which he employs, and
which signifies *also* or *even,* contains an implied contrast between
the secret whisperings of the common people, and the imperious decisions
of these imperious men, enhancing still more the baseness of their
conduct. Nevertheless, in the midst of all this he steadfastly
persevered in following after godliness. Satan was assailing him with
this device in order to drive him to despair, but he tells us that he
sought a remedy from it in meditation on the law of God. We are here
taught, that it is not unusual for earthly judges to oppress God’s
servants, and make a mock of their piety. If David could not escape this
reproach, why should we, in these times, expect to do so? Let us further
learn, that there is nothing more perverse than to place dependence upon
the judgments of men, because, in doing so, we must, of necessity,
constantly be in a state of vacillation. Let us therefore rest satisfied
with the approbation of God, though men causelessly defame us — not only
men of low degree, but also the very judges themselves, from whom the
utmost impartiality might be expected.

<span id="xxviii.iii-p23"></span><span id="xxviii.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.iii-p24"></span>**24.** *Also thy testimonies are my
delight* The particle <span id="xxviii.iii-p24.1"></span>גם, *gam,*
connects this with the preceding verse. To adhere unflinchingly to our
purpose, when the world takes up an unjust opinion of us, and, at the
same time, constantly to mediate on God’s law, is an example of
Christian fortitude seldom to be met with. The prophet now informs us
how he overcame this temptation. *Thy testimonies,* says he, *are my
delight: “*Although the cruel injustice of men, in charging me falsely,
grieves and annoys me, yet the pleasurable delight which I take in thy
law is a sufficient recompense for it all.” He adds, that God’s
testimonies *are his counselors,* by which we are to understand he did
not rely on his own judgment simply, but took counsel from the word of
God. This point ought to be carefully considered, inasmuch as we see how
blind affection predominates in directing the lives of men. Whence does
the avaricious man ask council, but from the erroneous principle which
he has assumed, that riches are superior to every thing? Why does the
ambitious man aspire after nothing so much as power, but because he
regards nothing equal to the holding of honorable rank in the world? It
is not surprising, therefore, that men are so grievously misled, seeing
they give themselves up to the direction of such evil counselors. Guided
by the word of God, and prudently yielding obedience to its dictates,
there will then be no inlet to the deceits of our flesh, and to the
delusions of the world, and we will stand invincible against all the
assaults of temptation.

<span id="xxviii.iv-p7"></span>**25.** *My soul cleaveth to the dust*
 <span id="fr_408"></span>[409](#fn_408.md) He means that he had no more
hope of life than if he had been shut up in the tomb; and this must be
carefully attended to, that we my not become impatient and grieved,
whenever it may please God to make us endure various kinds of death.
And, by his own example, he instructs us, when death stares us in the
face, and all hope of escape fails, to present our petitions to God, in
whose hand, as we have elsewhere seen, are the issues of death, and
whose peculiar prerogative it is to restore life to those that are dead,
(<span id="xxviii.iv-p8.2"></span>[Ps
68:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa068.htm#021.md)<span
id="xxviii.iv-p8.2"></span>) As the combat is hard, he betakes himself
to the promises of God, and invites others to do the same. The
expression, *according to thy word,*  <span
id="fr_409"></span>[410](#fn_409.md) is an acknowledgment, that should he
depart from God’s word, no hope would be left for him; but as God has
affirmed that the life of the faithful is in his hand, and under his
protection, shut up as he was in the grave, he yet comforted himself
with the expectation of life.

<span id="xxviii.iv-p10"></span><span id="xxviii.iv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.iv-p11"></span>**26.** *I have declared my ways.* In
the first part of this verse he affirms he had prayed sincerely, and had
not imitated the proud, who, trusting to their own wisdom, fortitude,
and opulence, make not God their refuge. That man is said *to declare
his ways to God,* who presumes neither to attempt nor undertake any
thing unless with His assistance, and, depending wholly on His
providence, commits all his plans to His sovereign pleasure, and centers
all his affections in Him; doing all this honestly, and not as the
hypocrites, who profess one thing with their lips, and conceal another
within their hearts. He adds, that *he was heard,* which was of great
importance in making him cherish good hope for the future.

<span id="xxviii.iv-p12"></span>In the second part of the verse he
solemnly declares, that he holds nothing more dear than the acquiring of
a true understanding of the law. There are not a few who make known
their desires unto God, but then they would that he would yield to their
extravagant passions. And, therefore, the prophet affirms that he
desires nothing more than to *be well instructed in God’s statutes.*
This statement is strengthened by the next verse, in which he once more
asks the knowledge of these to be communicated to him. In both passages
it must be carefully observed, that with the law of God set before us,
we will reap little benefit from merely perusing it, if we have not his
Spirit as our internal teacher.

<span id="xxviii.iv-p13"></span>Some expositors will have the word which
I have translated, *I will meditate,* to be, *I will entreat or argue,*
and thus the Hebrew term <span id="xxviii.iv-p13.1"></span>שוח,
*shuach,* is referred both to the words and thoughts. The latter meaning
is most in accordance with the scope of the passage. I take the import
of the prophet’s words to be this: — That I may meditate upon thy
wondrous works, make me to understand thy commandments. We will have no
relish for the law of God until he sanctify our minds, and render them
susceptible of tasting heavenly wisdom. And from this disrelish springs
indifference, so that it is a grievous thing for the world to give a
respectful attention to the law of God, having no savor for the
admirable wisdom contained in it. With great propriety, therefore, does
the prophet pray that this way may be opened to him by the gift of
knowledge. From these words we are instructed, that in proportion to the
spirit of knowledge given to us, our regard for the law of God, and our
delight in meditating on it, ought to increase.

<span id="xxviii.iv-p14"></span><span id="xxviii.iv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.iv-p15"></span>**28.** *My soul droppeth away for
grief* As a little before he said that his soul cleaved to the dust, so
now, almost in the same manner, he complains that it melted away with
grief. Some are of opinion that he alludes to tears, as if he had said
that his soul was dissolved in tears. But the simpler meaning is, that
his strength was poured out like water. The verb is in the future tense,
yet it denotes a continued action. The prophet assures himself of a
remedy for this his extreme sorrow, provided God stretch out his hand
towards him. Formerly, when almost lifeless, he entertained the
expectation of a revival through the grace of God; now also, by the same
means, he cherishes the hope of being restored to renovated and complete
vigor, notwithstanding he was nearly consumed. He repeats the
expression, *according to thy word,* because, apart from his word, God’s
power would afford us little comfort. But when he comes to our aid, even
should our courage and strength fail, his promise is abundantly
efficacious to fortify us.

<span id="xxviii.iv-p16"></span><span id="xxviii.iv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.iv-p17"></span>**29.** *Take away from me the way of
falsehood.* Knowing how prone the nature of man is to vanity and
falsehood, he first asks the sanctification of his thoughts, lest, being
entangled by the snares of Satan, he fall into error. Next, that he may
be kept from falsehood, he prays to be fortified with the doctrine of
the law. The second clause of the verse is interpreted variously. Some
render it, *make thy law pleasant to me.* And as the law is disagreeable
to the flesh, which it subdues and keeps under, there is good cause why
God should be asked to render it acceptable and pleasant to us. Some
expound it, *have mercy upon me according to thy law* as if the prophet
should draw pity from the fountain-head itself, because God in his law
promised it to the faithful. Both of these meanings appear to me forced;
and, therefore, I am more disposed to adopt another, freely *grant to me
thy law.* The original term, <span id="xxviii.iv-p17.1"></span>חנני
*channeni,* cannot be translated otherwise in Latin than, *gratify thou
me;* an uncouth and barbarous expression I admit, yet that will give me:
little concern, provided my readers comprehend the prophet’s meaning.
 <span id="fr_410"></span>[411](#fn_410.md) The amount is, that being full
of blindness, nothing is more easy than for us to be greatly deceived by
error. And, therefor unless God teach us by the Spirit of wisdom, we
will presently be hurried away into various errors. The means of our
being preserved from error are stated to consist in his instructing us
in his law. He makes use of the term *to gratify.* “It is indeed an
incomparable kindness that men are directed by thy law, but in
consequence of thy kindness being unmerited, I have no hesitation in
asking of thee to admit me as a participator of this thy kindness.” If
the prophet, who for some time previous served God, in now aspiring
after farther attainments, does not ask for a larger measure of grace to
be communicated to him meritoriously, but confesses it to be the free
gift of God, then that impious tenet, which obtains in the papacy, that
an increase of grace is awarded to merit as deserving of it, must fall
to the ground.

<span id="xxviii.iv-p19"></span><span id="xxviii.iv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.iv-p20"></span>**30.** *I have chosen the way of
truth.* In this and the following verse he affirms that he was so
disposed as to desire nothing more than to follow righteousness and
truth. It is, therefore, with great propriety he employs the term *to
choose.* The old adage, that man’s life is as it were at the point where
two ways meet, refers not simply to the general tenor of human life, but
to *every* particular action of it. For no sooner do we undertake any
thing, no matter how small, than we are grievously perplexed, and as if
hurried off by a tempest, are confounded by conflicting counsels. Hence
the prophet declares, that in order constantly to pursue the right path,
he had resolved and fully determined not to relinquish the truth. And
thus he intimates that he was not entirely exempted from temptations,
yet that he had surmounted them by giving himself up to the
conscientious observance of the law.

<span id="xxviii.iv-p21"></span>The last clause of the verse, *I have
set thy judgments before me,* relates to the same subject. There would
be no fixed choice on the part of the faithful, unless they steadily
contemplate the law, and did not suffer their eyes to wander to and fro.
In the subsequent verse he not only asserts his entertaining this holy
affection for the law, but also combines it with prayer, that he might
not become ashamed and enfeebled under the derision of the ungodly,
while he gave himself wholly to the law of God. Here he employs the same
term as formerly, when he said his soul cleaved to the dust, and, in
doing so, affirms he had so firmly taken hold of God’s law, that he
cannot be separated from it. From his expressing a fear lest he might be
put to shame or overwhelmed with reproach, we learn that the more
sincerely a man surrenders himself to God, the more will he be assailed
by the tongues of the vile and the venomous.

<span id="xxviii.iv-p22"></span><span id="xxviii.iv-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.iv-p23"></span>**32** *I will run the way of thy
commandments.* The meaning of the prophet is, that when God shall
inspire him with love for his la he will be vigorous and ready, nay,
even steady, so as not to faint in the middle of his course. His words
contain an implied admission of the supineness inability of men to make
any advancement in well-doing until God enlarge their hearts. No sooner
does God expand their hearts, than they are fitted not only for walking,
but also for running in the way of his commandments. He reminds us that
the proper observance of the law consists not merely in external works,
— that it demands willing obedience, so that the heart must, to some
extent, and in some way, enlarge itself. Not that it has the
self-determining power of doing this, but when once its hardness and
obstinacy are subdued, it moves freely without being any longer
contracted by its own narrowness. Finally, this passage tells us, when
God has once enlarged our hearts, there will be no lack of power,
because, along with proper affection, he will furnish ability, so that
our feet will be ready to run.

frequently done in this psalm, it being of the last importance for us to
know that the main thing in our life consists in having God for our
governor. The majority of mankind think of anything rather than this, as
that which they ought to ask from God. The Holy Spirit, therefore, often
inculcates this desire, and we ought always to keep it in mind, that not
only the inexperienced and unlearned, but those who have made great
progress, may not cease to aspire after farther advancement. And as the
Spirit of understanding comes from above, they should seek to be guided
by his invisible agency to the proper knowledge of the law.

<span id="xxviii.v-p6"></span>In the second clause of the verse the
prophet points out the particular kind of doctrine of which he treats,
that which virtually and effectually tends to renovate the heart of man.

*ekeb,* two ways. Some would have it to denote wages or reward, and then
the Psalmist’s meaning would be: After I have been well instructed, then
shall I know that those who apply themselves to the observance of thy
law will not labor in vain; and, therefore, for the sake of the reward,
I will keep thy commandments, persuaded that thou wilt never disappoint
thy servants. Others render it, *until the end,* because those whom God
teaches he teaches successfully, and, at the same time, strengthens them
for prosecuting their journey without feeling lassitude or languor by
the way, and enables them to persevere with constancy until they arrive
at the termination of their course. I am far from supposing that he has
no reference to the grace of perseverance. Let my readers, however,
consider whether this verse may not be taken simply as the words stand
in the original. The preposition *until* is not expressed by the
prophet, who merely says, *I will keep the end.* “Lord*,* I have need of
constant teaching, that I may not fall short of, but keep my eye
continually upon my mark; for thou commandest me to run in thy course,
on condition that death alone should be the goal. Unless thou teach me
daily, this perseverance will not be found in me. But if thou guide me,
I will be constantly upon the watch, and will never turn away my eyes
from my end, or aim.” In my version I have inserted the commonly
received reading.

<span id="xxviii.v-p7"></span><span id="xxviii.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.v-p8"></span>**34.** *Make me to understand* We are
here informed that true wisdom consists in being wise according to the
law of God, that it may preserve us in fear and obedience to him. In
asking God to confer this wisdom upon him, he owns that men, in
consequence of their natural blindness, aim at anything rather than
this. And, indeed, it is quite foreign to the notions usually prevalent
among mankind to strain every nerve to keep God’s law. The world esteems
as wise those only who look well to their own interests, are acute and
politic in temporal matters, and who even excel in the art of beguiling
the simple. In opposition to such a sentiment, the prophet pronounces
men to be void of true understanding as long as the fear of God does not
predominate among them. For himself he asks no other prudence than the
surrendering of himself entirely to God’s direction. At the same Lime,
he acknowledges this to be the special gift of God, which none can
procure by his own power or policy; for were each adequate to be his own
teacher in this matter, then this petition would be superfluous.

<span id="xxviii.v-p9"></span>Moreover, as the observance of the law is
no common occurrence, he employs two terms in reference to it. “Lord, it
is a high and hard thing to keep thy law strictly as it ought, which
demands from us purity beyond what we are able to attain; yet, depending
on the heavenly illumination of thy Spirit, I will not cease my
endeavors to keep it.” The following, however, renders the meaning more
clear: “Give me understanding to keep and observe thy law with my whole
heart.” Mention is made of *the whole heart,* to tell us how far they
are from the righteousness of the law who obey it only in the letter,
doing nothing deserving of blame in the sight of men. God puts a
restraint principally on the heart, that genuine uprightness may
flourish there, whose fruits may afterwards appear in the life. This
spiritual observance of the law is a most convincing evidence of the
necessity of being divinely prepared and formed for it.

<span id="xxviii.v-p10"></span><span id="xxviii.v-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.v-p11"></span>**35.** *Direct me in the path* The
frequent repetition of this phraseology by the prophet is not to be
considered as redundant. Seeing that the end of man’s existence ought to
consist in profiting in God’s school, we nevertheless perceive how the
world distracts him by its allurements, and how he also forms for
himself a thousand avocations calculated to withdraw his thoughts from
the main business of his life. The next clause of the verse, *in it I
take pleasure,* must be carefully attended to. For it is an indication
of rare excellence when a person so arranges his sentiments and
affections as to renounce all the enticements pleasant to the flesh, and
take delight in nothing so much as in the service of God. The prophet
had already attained to this virtue but he still perceives that he is
not yet perfect. Therefore, that his desire may be fully accomplished,
he solicits fresh assistance from God, according to the saying of Paul,

<span id="xxviii.v-p12"></span>“It is God that worketh in you, both to
will and to do of his good pleasures” <span
id="xxviii.v-p12.1"></span>[Php
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013.md)<span id="xxviii.v-p12.1"></span>.

<span id="xxviii.v-p13"></span>Let it be remembered, that he does not
boast of the inherent working of his nature, but sets forth the grace he
has received, that God may complete the work he has begun. “Lord, thou
hast given me courage, grant me also strength.” Hence in the term
*pleasure* there is an implied opposition to the lusts of the flesh,
which keep the hearts of mankind lettered by their enticements.

<span id="xxviii.v-p14"></span><span id="xxviii.v-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.v-p15"></span>**36.** *Incline my heart* In this verse
he confesses the human heart to be so far from yielding to the justice
of God, that it is more inclined to follow an opposite course. Were we
naturally and spontaneously inclined to the righteousness of the law,
there would be no occasion for the petition of the Psalmist, *Incline my
heart* It remains, therefore, that our hearts are full of sinful
thoughts, and wholly rebellious, until God by his grace change them.
This confession on the part of the prophet must not be overlooked, That
the natural corruption of man is so great, that he seeks for any thing
rather than what is right, until he be turned by the power of God to new
obedience, and thus begin to be inclined to that which is good.

<span id="xxviii.v-p16"></span>In the second clause of the verse the
prophet points to those impediments which prevent mankind from attaining
to the desire of righteousness; their being inclined to covetousness. By
a figure of speech,  <span id="fr_411"></span>[412](#fn_411.md) in which a
part is put for the whole, the species is put for the genus. The Hebrew
term, <span id="xxviii.v-p17.2"></span>בצע *batsang,* signifies *to use
violence,* or *to covet,* or *to defraud;* but covetousness is most in
accordance with the spirit of the passage, provided we admit the prophet
to have selected this species, “the root of all evils,” to demonstrate
that nothing is more opposed to the righteousness of God, (<span
id="xxviii.v-p17.3"></span>[1Ti
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#010.md)<span
id="xxviii.v-p17.3"></span>). We are here instructed generally, that we
are so much under the influence of perverse and vicious affections, our
hearts abhor the study of God’s law, until God inspire us with the
desire for that which is good.

<span id="xxviii.v-p18"></span><span id="xxviii.v-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.v-p19"></span>**37.** *Turn away mine eyes.* By these
words we are taught that all our senses are so filled with vanity, that,
until refined and rectified, their alienation from the pursuit of
righteousness is no matter of surprise. In the former verse he informed
us of the reigning of that depravity in the hearts of men, which he now
says reaches also to the outward senses. *“The* disease of covetousness
not only lurks in our hearts, but spreads over every part, so that
neither eyes, ears, feet, nor hands, have escaped its baneful influence;
in a word, nothing is exempted from corruption.” And we know, assuredly,
that the guilt of original sin is not confined to one faculty of man
only; it pervades his whole constitution. If our eyes must be turned
away from vanity by the special grace of God, it follows, that, as soon
as they are opened, they are eagerly set on the impostures of Satan, by
which they are beset on all sides. If Satan only laid snares for us, and
were we possessed of sufficient prudence to guard against his deceits,
it could not, with propriety, be said that God turned away our eyes from
vanity; but, as they are naturally set upon sinful allurements, there is
need for their being withdrawn from them. As often, then, as we open our
eyes, we must not forget that two gates are opened for the devil to
enter our hearts, unless God guard us by his Holy Spirit. The remarks
which he makes, in reference to the eyes, are equally applicable to the
other senses, inasmuch as he again employs that figure of speech, by
which a part is taken for the whole.

<span id="xxviii.v-p20"></span>The other clause of the verse corresponds
well with the meaning here given. Others may propose different
interpretations; I think, however, the following is the most natural:
Lord, as the whole life of mankind is accursed, so long as they employ
their powers in committing sin, grant that the power which I possess may
aspire after nothing except the righteousness which thou appointest us.
The better to manifest this, we must lay it down as a first principle,
that seeing, hearing, walking, and feeling, are God’s precious gifts;
that our understandings and will, with which we are furnished, are a
still more valuable gift; and, after all, there is no look of the eyes,
no motion of the senses, no thought of the mind, unmingled with vice and
depravity. Such being the case, the prophet, with good reason,
surrenders himself entirely to God, for the mortification of the flesh,
that he might begin to live anew.

<span id="xxviii.v-p21"></span><span id="xxviii.v-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.v-p22"></span>**38.** *Confirm thy word unto thy
servant.* Here we have briefly set forth the sole end and legitimate use
of prayer, which is, that we may reap the fruits of God’s promises.
Whence it comes to pass, that they commit sin who utter vague and
incoherent desires. For we perceive the prophet allows not himself to
petition or wish any thing but what God hath condescended to promise.
And certainly their presumption is great, who rush into the presence of
God without any call from his word; as if they would make him
subservient to their humor and caprice. The argument by which the
Psalmist enforces his plea deserves to be noticed*; because I am devoted
to thy fear.* The relative <span id="xxviii.v-p22.1"></span>אשר *asher,*
in this place bears the signification of the causal conjunction,
*because* or *for.* The prophet intimates that he does not content
himself with mere temporal enjoyments, as worldly men do; and that he
did not make a preposterous abuse of God’s promises, to secure the
delights of the flesh, but that he made his fear and reverence his aim.
And truly the best assurance which we can have of obtaining our requests
is when these and God’s service harmonize, and our sole desire is that
he may reign in and over us.

<span id="xxviii.v-p23"></span><span id="xxviii.v-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.v-p24"></span>**39.** *Take away my reproach.* It is
not certain to what reproach he alludes. Knowing that many calumniators
were on the watch to find occasion for reviling him, should they happen
to detect him in any offense, it is not without reason he dreaded lest
he might fall into such disgrace, and that by his own fault. Probably he
might be apprehensive of some other reproach, aware that wicked men
shamefully and injuriously slander the good generally, and, by their
calumnies, distort and pervert their good actions. The concluding
clause, *Because the judgments of God are good,* is the reason why God
should put to silence the mischievous tongues, which pour out the venom
of their malice without shame against the innocent, who are reverently
observing his law. If any be inclined to view the word *reproach* as
directed against God himself, such an interpretation is by no means
objectionable, That the prophet, whose aim it was to stand approved as
to his life in God’s sight, merely desired, when he appeared before his
tribunal, not to be judged as a reprobate man; just as if, with great
zeal and magnanimity, he would despise all the empty talk of the men of
the world, provided he stood upright in God’s sight. Above all, it
becomes holy men to dread the reproach of being suffused with shame at
God’s judgment-seat.

<span id="xxviii.v-p25"></span><span id="xxviii.v-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.v-p26"></span>**40.** *Behold, I have a desire to thy
precepts* This is a repetition of what he declared a little before, with
regard to his pious affection, and his love of righteousness; and that
nothing was wanting but God to complete the work which he had commenced.
If this interpretation be admitted, then, *to be quickened in the
righteousness of God,* will be tantamount to being quickened in the way.
The term *righteousness* is often put in this psalm for the law of God,
or the rule of a righteous life. This view tends to make the two parts
of the verse accord with one another. “Lord*,* this is now a remarkable
kindness thou hast done me, in having inspired me with a holy desire to
keep thy law; one thing is still necessary, that this same virtue
pervade my whole life.” But as the word *righteousness* is ambiguous, my
readers may, if they choose, understand it thus: Restore, defend, and
maintain me for the sake of thy goodness, which thou art wont to show to
all thy people. I have already pointed out the exposition which I
prefer.

<span id="xxviii.vi"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xxviii.vi-p5"></span><span id="xxviii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vi-p6"></span>**41.** *Let thy mercies come to me*
There can be no doubt, that, in mentioning the *mercy of God* first, and
afterwards *his salvation,* the Psalmist, according to the natural
order, puts the cause before the effect. By adopting this arrangement,
he acknowledges that there is no salvation for him but in the pure mercy
of God. And while he desires a gracious salvation, he, at the same time,
relies on the promise, as we have already elsewhere seen.

<span id="xxviii.vi-p7"></span>In the second verse he boasts that he is
furnished with the best defense against the calumnies of his enemies,
arising from his trust in the word of God. We may resolve the future
tense into the optative mood, as many do: O Lord, since *I have trusted
in thy word,* grant that my mouth with all boldness may repel the
slanders which they utter against me, and suffer me not to be silent
when they load me with unmerited reproach.” Whichever of these meanings
we adopt, we are taught that there will always be evil-speakers, who
will not cease to defame the children of God, though they be entirely
undeserving of such treatment. It is somewhat dubious to what particular
kind of reproach he refers; for the ungodly not only cover the children
of God with ignominy, but also make their faith the subject of ridicule.
I prefer the following interpretation, because it agrees best with the
context, and David is here placing his trust in God in opposition to
their derision. “I shall have something to reply to the base mockery of
the enemies who injure me without cause, in that God never disappoints
those who place their confidence in him.” If any one be inclined to
consider the passage as embracing both meanings, I offer no objection to
it. Besides, he does not simply say, that he trusted in God, but that he
also trusted in his word, which is the ground of his trust. We must
carefully attend to the correspondence and mutual relation between the
term *word,* in the first part of the verse, and that in the other. Were
not God, by his Word, to furnish us with another word for our defense,
we would instantly be overwhelmed with the insolence of our enemies. If,
then, we wish to be proof against the attacks of the world, the
commencement and foundation of our magnanimity is here pointed out to
us, — our trusting in God’s word, guarded by which, the Spirit of God
calls upon us boldly to contemn the virulent blasphemies of the ungodly.
And to qualify us for repelling such blasphemies, he connects the word
of hope with the word of confession.

<span id="xxviii.vi-p8"></span><span id="xxviii.vi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vi-p9"></span>**43.** *Take not the word of truth too
long out of my mouth*  <span id="fr_413"></span>[414](#fn_413.md) It may be
asked, why he demands rather to have his tongue filled with, than his
heart fortified by, the *word of truth;* inasmuch as the latter takes
the precedence, both in point of order and of excellence. What will it
profit us to be fluent and eloquent in speech, if our hearts are
destitute of faith? On the other hand, wherever there is firm faith,
there to speech will flow ultroneously. My reply is, that David was not
so concerned about outward confession as not to give the preference to
the faith of the heart; but considering that he is making his address to
God, there is nothing strange in his making mention only of the former,
under which, however, he includes also the latter. “Lord, support not
only my heart by faith, lest I be overwhelmed with temptation, but grant
me also freedom of speech, that I may fearlessly sound forth thy praises
among men.” We observe, when he asks to be endued with boldness of
speech, that he begins with the heart.

<span id="xxviii.vi-p11"></span>It may be farther inquired here, why he
says *too long,* just as if he were not afraid of being deprived of the
word of truth for a short time. Such a supposition were most absurd,
seeing we must watch every moment lest we be overtaken by the enemy,
when we are unarmed and powerless. The solution of this difficulty must
be drawn from our own experience; for in this, the infirmity of our
flesh, it is almost impossible but that, occasionally, even the stoutest
heart will quail under the violent assaults of Satan. And although their
faith fails not, yet it shakes, and they do not find such presence of
mind, as that there is constantly a uniform train of speech, and a
prompt reply to the derision’s of the ungodly; but, on the contrary,
they rather begin to stagger and quake for a short time. Conscious of
this weakness, which is perceptible in all mankind, he accommodates his
prayer in the following manner: “Though I am not always prepared with
that boldness of speech which is desirable, suffer me not to continue
long silent.” By this language the prophet tacitly admits, that he had
not been so steadfast and bold as was requisite, but that he was, as it
were, struck speechless by reason of fear. Whence we may learn, that the
faculty of speaking freely is no more in our power than are the
affections. of the heart. As far, then, as God directs our tongues, they
are prepared for ready utterance; but no sooner does he withdraw the
spirit of magnanimity, than not only our hearts faint, or rather fail,
but also our tongues become mute. The cause of this is subjoined in
these words, *for I have waited for thy judgments* for so he literally
expresses himself. From which we conclude, that *judgments* refer not
merely to the precepts of the law, but also to the promises, which
constitute the true foundation of our confidence. Some render it, *I was
afraid of thy. judgments,* deriving the word here employed from the root
<span id="xxviii.vi-p11.1"></span>חול *chul;* which translation I am
unable to say whether it be suitable or not. But of this I am certain,
that to understand *judgments* as equivalent to *punishments,* is quite
foreign to the design of the prophet.

<span id="xxviii.vi-p12"></span><span id="xxviii.vi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vi-p13"></span>**44.** *I will keep thy law
continually* He resolves to devote himself to the study of the law, not
for a short time only, but even to the termination of his life. The
employing of three synonymous words, <span
id="xxviii.vi-p13.1"></span>תמיד, *tamid,* <span
id="xxviii.vi-p13.2"></span>עולם, *olam,* <span
id="xxviii.vi-p13.3"></span>עד, *ed,* so far from being viewed as a
superfluous accumulation of terms, contains an implied indication, that,
unless the faithful make a strenuous and steady opposition, the fear of
God may be gradually effaced from their minds by various temptations,
and they will lose the affection which they bear for the law. In order,
therefore, that he may be the better prepared for meeting these trials,
he alludes to the difficulty and danger connected with them.

<span id="xxviii.vi-p14"></span><span id="xxviii.vi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vi-p15"></span>The next verse may be read as expressing
a desire that he might walk. Be this as it may, we retain the commonly
received reading, That David exults at the thought of his path becoming
plain and easy, in consequence of his seeking diligently after God’s
precepts; that is, *to walk at ease* The ways of men are frequently
rugged and obstructed, because they themselves lay various
stumblingblocks in them, or entangle themselves in many inextricable
windings. Hence it comes to pass, that while none will submit to the
word of God as their rule, every man endures the punishment legitimately
due to such arrogance. On all sides God lays snares for us, puts
pitfalls in our way, causes us to fall in with paths broken and rugged,
and at last shuts us up in a bottomless pit: and by how much the more
politic a mart is, by so much the more will he meet with obstructions in
his path.

<span id="xxviii.vi-p16"></span>This verse teaches us that, if any man
yield implicit obedience to God, he will receive this as his reward,
that he shall walk with a calm and composed mind; and should he meet
with difficulties, he will find the means of surmounting them. The
faithful, however readily and submissively they give themselves up to
God, may happen to find themselves involved in perplexity; nevertheless,
the end contemplated by Paul is accomplished, that though they be in
trouble and toil, yet they do not continue in irremediable distress,
because it is the duty (so to speak) of God to point out a way for them
where there seems to be no way, (<span id="xxviii.vi-p16.1"></span>[2Co
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008.md)<span
id="xxviii.vi-p16.1"></span>.) Moreover, when grievously oppressed, even
then they walk at ease, for they commit the doubtful issue of events to
God in such a manner, that, having him for their guide, they have no
doubt they will come out boldly from the depths of distress.

<span id="xxviii.vi-p17"></span><span id="xxviii.vi-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vi-p18"></span>**46.** *And I will steal, of thy
testimonies before kings*  <span id="fr_414"></span>[415](#fn_414.md) In
these words he seems to believe that he is in possession of that which
he formerly prayed for. Having said, “Take not away the word out of my
mouths” and now, as if he had obtained what he requested, he rises up,
and maintains he will not be dumb, even were he called upon to speak in
the presence of kings. There can be no question that he affirms he would
willingly stand forward in vindication of the glory of God in the face
of the whole world. He selects kings, who are generally more to be
dreaded than other men, and haughtily shut the mouths of God’s
witnesses. Sometimes, indeed, it happens we will not hold out even in
the presence of men in the humblest ranks of life. The moment a man sets
himself in opposition to the word of God, we instinctively shrink back
from fear; and that boldness of speech, of which we boasted at first,
instantly disappears: but our want of courage is most palpable when we
are summoned before the thrones of kings. And this is the reason why
David asserts, that he will not only hold out against enemies among the
meanest of men, but also will remain firm and fearless before kings.
These words inform us that we have profited well and truly by God’s
word, when our hearts are so completely fortified against the fear of
man, that we do not dread the presence of kings, even though all the
world attempts; to fill us with dejection and dismay. It is most
unbecoming that God’s glory should be obscured by their empty splendor.

<span id="xxviii.vi-p20"></span><span id="xxviii.vi-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vi-p21"></span>**47.** *And I will delight myself* The
sentiment contained in this verse is similar to that which he had
previously mentioned. The amount is, he held the commandments of God in
such high esteem, that he experienced nothing more pleasant to him than
the making of them his constant theme of meditation. By the term
*delight,* he expresses the intensity of his love. The phrase *I will
lift up my hands,* refers, to the same thing. It is a sure indication
that we eagerly desire a thing when we stretch out the hands to grasp
and enjoy it. This simile, therefor denotes the ardor of his desire.
 <span id="fr_415"></span>[416](#fn_415.md) If a man, by his mien and gait
pretend any such affection for the law of God, and yet pay no regard to
it in the affairs of life, he would be justly chargeable with the basest
hypocrisy. Again, he affirms, that that affection, so earnest and so
ardent, springs from the sweetness of the law of God having knit our
hearts to it. Finally, he says, he *would meditate on God’s
testimonies.* Along with the majority of commentators, I have no doubt
that the word <span id="xxviii.vi-p22.14"></span>שוח *shuach,* denotes
that silent and secret musing in which the children of God exercise
themselves.

<span id="xxviii.vii-p5"></span>**49.** *Remember thy word. He* prays
that God would really perform what he promised; for the event proves
that he does not forget his word. That he is speaking of the promises we
infer from the end of the verse, in which he declares, that cause was
given him to hope, for which there would be no place unless grace had
been presented to him. In the second verse he asserts, that though God
still kept him in suspense, yet he reposed with confidence in his word.
At the same time he informs us, that during his troubles and anxieties,
he did not search after vain consolation as the world is wont to d who
look around them in all quarters to find something to mitigate their
miseries; and if any allurements tickle their fancy, they make use of
these as a remedy for alleviating their sorrows. On the contrary, the
prophet says he was satisfied with the word of God itself; and that when
all other refuges failed him, there he found life full and perfect;
nevertheless, he covertly confesses, that if he do not acquire courage
from the word of God, he will become like a dead man. The ungodly may
sometimes experience elevation of spirit during their miseries, but they
are totally destitute of this inward strength of mind. The prophet,
then, had good reason for stating, that in the time of affliction the
faithful experience animation and rigor solely from the *word of God
inspiring them with life,.* Hence, if we meditate carefully on his word,
we shall live even in the midst of death, nor will we meet with any
sorrow so heavy for which it will not furnish us with a remedy. And if
we are bereft of consolation and succor in our adversities, the blame
must rest with ourselves; because, despising or overlooking the word of
God, we purposely deceive ourselves with vain consolation.

<span id="xxviii.vii-p6"></span><span id="xxviii.vii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vii-p7"></span>**51.** *The proud have greatly scorned
me* This example is eminently useful, as it serves to inform us, that
though our honesty may render us obnoxious to the insults of the
ungodly, we ought, by our unflinching constancy, to repel their pride,
lest we should take a dislike to the law of God. Many who, in other
respects, would be disposed to fear God, yield to this temptation. The
earth has always been filled with the impious contemners of God, and at
this day it is almost overrun with them. Wherefore, if we do not
disregard their reviling, there will be no stability in our faith. In
calling unbelievers *proud,* he applies to them a very appropriate
designation: for their wisdom consists in despising God, lightly
esteeming his judgments, trampling all piety under foot, and, in short,
pouring contempt upon the celestial kingdom. Were they not blinded with
pride, they would not follow such a headlong course. We must interpret
the words in this manner: Though the proud have treated me with scorn, I
have not turned aside from thy law. We must not overlook the,, particle
*very much,* or greatly, which imports, that he was harassed, not merely
occasionally or for a short time, by the ungodly, but that the attack
was continued from day to day. Let us learn from these words, that the
wicked, in consequence of their forming the great majority of mankind,
arrogate to themselves the greater liberty. The number of the godly who
worship God reverently is always small. Hence we must hold out against a
large troop and rabble of the impious if we would maintain our
integrity.

<span id="xxviii.vii-p8"></span><span id="xxviii.vii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vii-p9"></span>**52.** *I called to mind thy judgments
of old, O Jehovah!* In this psalm, *the judgments of God* are generally
taken for his statutes and decrees, that is, his *righteousness.*  <span
id="fr_416"></span>[417](#fn_416.md) In this place, in consequence of the
qualifying phrase, *of old,* it is more probable that they refer to the
examples by which God has made himself known as the righteous Judge of
the world. Why does he say that the law of God has been from
everlasting? This may to some extent be accounted for from the
righteousness here mentioned not being of recent growth, but truly
everlasting, because the written law is just an attestation of the law
of nature, through means of which God recalls to our memory that which
he has previously engraved on our hearts.

<span id="xxviii.vii-p11"></span>I am rather inclined to adopt another
interpretation, That David remembered the judgments of God, by which he
testified that he had established his law perpetually in the world, Such
a settlement is very necessary for us; because, when God does not make
bare his arm, his word frequently produces little impression. But when
he takes vengeance upon the ungodly, he confirms what he had spoken; and
this is the reason why in civil law penalties are called confirmations.
The term accords better with God’s judgments, by which he establishes
the authority of his law, as if a true demonstration accompanied his
words. And seeing he declares that he called to mind the most ancient of
God’s judgments, it becomes us to learn, that if his judgments are not
displayed as frequently as we would desire, for the strengthening of our
faith, this is owing to our ingratitude and apathy; for in no past age
have there been wanting clear demonstrations for this very purpose; and
thus it may with truth be affirmed, that God’s judgments have flowed in
one continued manner from age to age, and that the reason why we have
not perceived them is, our not deigning to open our eyes to behold them.
If any one object, that it is contrary to the nature of his judgments to
afford consolation to because they are calculated rather to strike us
with terror, the answer is at handy — that the faithful are made to
tremble for fear of God’s judgments, as far as is requisite for the
mortification of their flesh. On the other hand, these supply them with
a large source of consolation, from the fact of their learning from
them, that God exercises his superintending providence over the human
race. Farther, they learn, that after the wicked have reveled in
licentiousness for a season, they shall at length be sisted before the
judgment-seat of God; but that they themselves, after having patiently
combated under such a Guardian of their welfare, can be in no doubt
about their preservation.

<span id="xxviii.vii-p12"></span><span id="xxviii.vii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vii-p13"></span>**53.** *Terror seized me*  <span
id="fr_417"></span>[418](#fn_417.md) This verse may be understood in two
senses; either that the prophet was grievously afflicted when he saw
God’s law violated by the wicked, or that he was horror-struck at the
thought of their perdition. Some would render it *ardor,* which does not
so properly agree with the nature of the passage; I therefore abide by
the term *fear,* by which I think his ardent zeal is pointed out, in
that he was not only deeply grieved at the transgressions of the law,
but held in the utmost detestation the impious boldness of those who
lightly esteemed the law of God. At the same time, it is worthy of
notice, that it is no new ground of offense to the faithful, if numbers
throw off God’s yoke, and set up the standard of rebellion against him.
This, I repeat, must be attended to, because many derive flimsy and
frivolous pretexts for it, from the degeneracy of the age, as if they
must needs howl while they live among wolves. In the days of David, we
see there were many who apostatized from the faith, and yet, so far was
he from being discouraged or dismayed by these things, that the fear of
God rather kindled a holy indignation in his bosom. What is to be done,
then, when surrounded by bad examples, but that we should vie with each
other in holding them up to detestation? And here a contrast, if not
directly stated, is implied, between the flattering unction which we
apply to ourselves, believing that all is lawful which is common, and
the horror with which the prophet tells us he was seized. If the wicked,
haughtily and without restraint, set themselves in opposition to God, in
consequence of our not being alive to his judgments, we convert that
into an occasion of perverse confidence and insensibility. On the
contrary, the prophet asserts that he was seized with horror, because,
though he considered the long-suffering of God, on the one hand, yet, on
the other, he was fully persuaded that he must, sooner or later, call
for condign punishment.

<span id="xxviii.vii-p15"></span><span id="xxviii.vii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vii-p16"></span>**54.** *Thy statutes have been my
songs.*  <span id="fr_418"></span>[419](#fn_418.md) He repeats in different
words what he had formerly mentioned, that the law of God was his sole
or special delight during all his life. Singing is an indication of joy.
The saints are pilgrims in this world, and must be regarded as God’s
children and heirs of heaven, from the fact that they are sojourners on
earth. By the *house of their pilgrimage,* then, may be understood their
journey through life. One circumstance merits particular notice, that
David, during his exile from his native country, ceased not to draw
consolation, amid all his hardships, from the law of God, or rather a
joy which rose above all the sadness which his banishment occasioned to
him. It was a noble specimen of rare virtue, that when he was denied a
sight of the temple, could not draw near to the sacrifices, and was
deprived of the ordinances of religion, he yet never departed from his
God. The phrase, the *house of his pilgrimage,* is employed, therefore,
to enhance the conduct of David, who, when banished from his country,
still retained the law of God deeply engraved on his heart, and who,
amid the severity of that exile, which was calculated to deject his
spirits, cheered himself by meditating upon the law of God.

<span id="xxviii.vii-p18"></span><span id="xxviii.vii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vii-p19"></span>**55.** *By night I remembered thy
name, O Jehovah!* As the second clause of the verse depends on the
first, I consider the whole verse as setting forth one and the same
truth; and, therefore, the prophet means that he was induced, by the
remembrance he had of God, to keep the law. Contempt of the law
originates in this, that few have any regard for God; and hence, the
Scripture, in condemning the impiety of men, declares that they *have
forgotten* God, (<span id="xxviii.vii-p19.1"></span>[Ps
50:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#022.md)<span
id="xxviii.vii-p19.1"></span>*;* 78:11; 106:21). To rectify this, David
exhorts that the remembrance of God is the only remedy for preserving us
hi his fear, and in the observance of his law; and assuredly, as often
as his majesty occurs to our minds, it will tend to humble us, and the
very thought of it will provoke us to the cultivation of godliness. The
word *night* is not intended by him to mean the remembering of God
merely for, short time, but a perpetual remembrance of him; he, however,
refers to that season in particular, because then almost all our senses
are overpowered with sleep. “When other men are sleeping, God occurs to
my thoughts during my sleep.” He has another reason for alluding to the
night-season, That we may be apprised, that though there was none to
observe him, and none to put him in remembrance of it, — yea, though he
was shrouded in darkness, — yet he was as solicitous to cherish the
remembrance of God, as if’ he occupied the most public and conspicuous
place.

<span id="xxviii.vii-p20"></span><span id="xxviii.vii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.vii-p21"></span>**56.** *This was done to me.* I doubt
not that the prophet, under the term <span
id="xxviii.vii-p21.1"></span>זאת, *zoth,* comprehends all God’s
benefits; but as he comes before God in relation to blessings then being
enjoyed by him, he speaks as if he were pointing to them. Hence, under
this term is included an acknowledgment of all the benefits with which
he had been crowned; or, at all events, he declares that God had borne
testimony, by some signal deliverance, to the integrity of his conduct.
He does not boast of meriting any thing, as the Pharisees in our day do,
who, when they meet with any such matter in Scripture, pervert it to
prove the merit of works. But the prophet had no other design, than to
set himself in diametrical opposition to the despisers of God, who
either impute all their prosperity to their own industry, or ascribe it
to chance, and malignantly overlook or conceal God’s superintending
providence. He therefore calls upon himself to return to God, and
invites others to follow his example, and exhorts them, that as God is
an impartial judge, he will always reserve a recompense for piety.
Probably, too, by this holy boasting he repels the base slanders of the
ungodly, by which we lately saw he was grievously assailed.

<span id="xxviii.viii-p5"></span><span id="xxviii.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.viii-p6"></span>**57.** *Thou art my portion, O
Jehovah!* The meaning of this clause is doubtful, because the term
*Jehovah* may be rendered either in the nominative or vocative case, and
the phrase, *I have said,* may relate either to the former or latter
part of the verse. One lection then is, *Jehovah is my portion,* and,
therefore, *I have* *resolved to observe thy law.* Another is, *O God!
who art my portion, I have resolved to observe thy law.* A third is, *I
have* *said, or have resolved, that God is my portion, in order to
observe* his *law.* A fourth is, *I have said, or have resolved, O Lord!
that my portion is to observe thy law;* and this is the reading of which
I approve. The following interpretation is quite applicable, That God
being our portion, ought to animate and encourage us to observe his law.
We have already noticed in several other passages, that God is
denominated the heritage of the faithful, because he alone is sufficient
for their full and entire happiness. And seeing he has chosen us for his
peculiar possession, it is only reasonable on our part, that we should
rest satisfied with him alone; and if we do this, our hearts will also
be disposed to keep his law and, renouncing all the lusts of the flesh,
our supreme delight, and firm resolution, will be to continue in the
same.

<span id="xxviii.viii-p7"></span>I have already said, that this
exposition is not inconsistent with the scope of the passage, and that
it furnishes a very useful doctrine. But the last and fourth reading, of
which I remarked I approved, is more simple, — I am fully persuaded that
my best portion consists in keeping God’s law; — and this accords with
the saying of Paul, “Godliness is the best gain,” (<span
id="xxviii.viii-p7.1"></span>[1Ti
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#006.md)<span
id="xxviii.viii-p7.1"></span>). David here draws a comparison between
the keeping of the law, and the imaginary good which captivates the
ambition of mankind. “Let every one covet what seems to him good, and
revel in his own pleasures; I have no ground to envy them, provided I
retain this as my portion, the complete surrender of myself to the word
of God.”

<span id="xxviii.viii-p8"></span><span id="xxviii.viii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.viii-p9"></span>**58.** *I have earnestly besought thy
face.* In this verse David asserts, that he still persevered in the
exercise of prayer; for without prayer faith would become languid and
lifeless. The manner in which he expresses himself, which, in other
languages, might be unpolished, among the Hebrews, expresses that
familiar communication to which God admits, and even invites his
servants when they come into his presence. The substance of his prayers,
and the sum of his desires, he comprehends in a single sentence; namely,
that he implored the mercy of God, the sure hope of which he had formed
from his word. Let us observe, then, in the first place, we are aroused
from our supineness, that we may exercise our faith by prayer. In the
second place, the principal thing for which we ought to pray is, that
God, out of his free grace, may be favorable to us, look on our
affection, and grant us relief. God does, indeed, aid us in a variety of
ways, and our necessities also are innumerable; still the thing which we
must principally and particularly request is, that he: will have mercy
upon us, which is the source of every other blessing. And, in the last
place, that we may not present prayers that have no meaning, let us
learn that God, in all his promises, is set before us as if he were our
willing debtor.

<span id="xxviii.viii-p10"></span><span id="xxviii.viii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.viii-p11"></span>**59.** *I thought upon my ways*
 <span id="fr_420"></span>[421](#fn_420.md) The amount is, that after the
prophet had paid due regard to his manner of life, his only aim then was
to follow the teaching of the law. In these words he intimates
indirectly, that if it be inquired why men go astray, and are miserably
distracted amidst conflicting impulses, the reason is, their
thoughtlessly indulging themselves in the gratification of their
passions. Every man watches most carefully, and applies all his energy
to whatever his inclination may lead him, but all are blind in choosing
the object which they ought to pursue; or rather, as if their eyes were
sealed, they are either hurried away inconsiderately, or else, through
carelessness, wander imperceptibly from one object to another. One thing
is certain, that there is no one who carefully considers his ways; and,
therefore, it is not without reason the prophet exhorts us, that the
commencement of a godly life consists in men awaking from their
lethargy, examining their ways, and, at last, wisely considering what it
is to regulate their conduct properly. He next instructs us, that when a
person is inclined in good earnest to frame the course of his life well,
there is nothing better than for him to follow the direction which the
Lord points out. In fact, were not men infatuated, they would
universally and unanimously make choice of God to be the guide of their
life.

<span id="xxviii.viii-p13"></span><span id="xxviii.viii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.viii-p14"></span>**60.** *I made haste* Though the
words are in the past tense, they denote a continued act. The prophet
declares with what promptitude he dedicated himself to the service of
God. Diligence and dispatch demonstrate the favor of his zeal. Next, in
saying that he *delayed not,*  <span id="fr_421"></span>[422](#fn_421.md)
this, according to the Hebrew idiom, gives intensity to the idea
conveyed by the phrase, *I made haste* As among the Hebrews, *to speak
and not to keep silence* is equivalent to speaking freely, unreservedly,
and without dissimulation, as the occasion demands, so to *make haste
and not delay* is to run quickly without doubt or delay. If we reflect
on our own listlessness, and on the snares which Satan never fails to
put in our way, we will at once perceive that these words are not added
in vain. For let a man be ever so desirous of applying himself truly and
heartily to the righteousness of God, yet, according to Paul, we know
that *“*he does not the thing that he would,” (<span
id="xxviii.viii-p15.2"></span>[Rom.
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#015.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#018.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#019.md)<span
id="xxviii.viii-p15.2"></span>). Although no outward obstacle may stand
in our way, yet we are so retarded by impediments within, that nothing
is more difficult than to make haste to keep the law of God. At the same
time we must remember, that the prophet is here speaking comparatively
in reference to those who are chargeable with procrastination during the
greater part of their life, and who draw near to God, not only
hesitatingly and tardily, but also purposely loiter in their course, or
else prevent themselves from coming by their tortuous ways. The prophet
did not manifest more alacrity in serving God than Paul; all he intends,
therefore, is, that having surmounted all obstacles which lay in his
way, he prosecuted his journey with rapidity. And by his example he
teaches us, that the pleas which we offer in extenuation of our
indolence, either arising from the impediments presented by the world or
our own infirmity, are vain and frivolous.

<span id="xxviii.viii-p16"></span><span id="xxviii.viii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.viii-p17"></span>**61.** *The cords of the wicked have
caught hold of me.* Those who translate <span
id="xxviii.viii-p17.1"></span>חבלי*, cheblei,* by *sorrows,* bring out
no natural meaning, and perplex themselves as well as wrest the passage.
Two readings then remain, either of which may be admitted: *The cords of
the wicked have caught hold of me,* or *The companies of the wicked have
robbed me*  <span id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) Whether we adopt the
one or the other of these readings, what the prophet intends to declare
is, that when Satan assailed the principles of piety in his soul, by
grievous temptations, he continued with undeviating steadfastness in the
love and practice of God’s law. *Cords* may, however, be understood in
two ways; either, first, as denoting the deceptive allurements by which
the wicked endeavored to get him entangled in their society; or,
secondly, the frauds which they practiced to effect his ruin. If the
first sense is preferred, David intimates that he had manifested a rare
virtue, in continuing in the observance of God’s law, even when the
wicked seemed to have involved him in their nets; but as it is more
generally agreed that the verb <span id="xxviii.viii-p18.2"></span>עוד,
*ived,* signifies *to despoil* or *rob,* let us adopt this
interpretation — That the prophet being assailed by troops of the
ungodly, and afterwards robbed and rifled at their pleasure, never
deserted his ground. This was a proof of singular fortitude; for when we
are exposed to dangers and wrongs of a more than ordinary kind, if God
does not see our us we immediately begin to doubt of his providence: it
seems to be of no advantage for a man to be godly; we imagine also that
we may lawfully take revenge; and amidst these waves, the remembrance of
the Divine law is easily lost, and, as it were, submerged. But the
prophet assures us:, that to continue to love the law, and to practice
righteousness, when we are exposed as a prey to the ungodly, and
perceive no help from God, is an evidence of genuine piety.

<span id="xxviii.viii-p19"></span><span id="xxviii.viii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.viii-p20"></span>**62** *I will rise at midnight to
praise thee* In this verse he shows not only that he approved and
embraced with his whole heart whatever the Divine law contains, but that
he also gave evidence of his gratitude to God for having made him
partaker of so great a blessing. It seems to be quite a common thing
professedly to assent to God when he teaches us by his law; for who
would dare to lift up his voice against Him? But still the world is very
far from acknowledging that the truth which he has revealed is in all
respects reasonable. In the first place, such is the rebellion of our
corrupt nature, that every man would have somewhat either altered or
taken away. Again, if men had their choice, they would rather be
governed by their own will than by the word of God. In short, human
reason, as well as human passions, is widely at variance with the Divine
law. He then has profited not little, who both obediently embraces
revealed truth, and, taking sweet delight in it, gives thanks to God for
it. The prophet, however, does not simply declare that he magnifies
God’s righteous judgments; he also affirms that *he rose at midnight* to
do so, by which he expresses the earnestness of his desire; for the
studies and cares which break our sleep necessarily imply great
earnestness of soul. He also, at the same time, intimates, that in
bearing his testimony in behalf of the Divine law, he was far from being
influenced by ostentation, since in his secret retirement, when no human
eye was upon him, he pronounced the highest encomiums on God’s righteous
judgments.

<span id="xxviii.viii-p21"></span><span id="xxviii.viii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.viii-p22"></span>**63.** *I am a companion to all those
who fear thee* He does not simply speak of the brotherly love and
concord which true believers cultivate among themselves, but intimates
that, whenever he met with any individual who feared God, he gave him
his hand in token of fellowship, and that he was not only one of the
number of God’s servants, but also their helper. Such concord is
undoubtedly required in all the godly, that they may contribute to each
other’s advancement in the fear of God. There seems to be a tacit
comparison between this holy combination, by which the faithful mutually
keep up and foster among themselves the worship of God and true
godliness, and the impious associations which prevail every where in the
world. We see how worldly men array their troops against God, and assist
one another in their attempts to overthrow his worship. The more then is
it necessary for the children of God to be stirred up to the maintenance
of a holy unity. The Psalmist commends the faithful, first, for their
fearing God, and, secondly, for their observing the law. The fear of God
is the root or origin of all righteousness, and by dedicating our life
to His service, we manifest that His fear dwells in our hearts.

<span id="xxviii.viii-p23"></span><span id="xxviii.viii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.viii-p24"></span>**64.** *O Jehovah! the earth is full
of thy mercy* Here the prophet beseeches God, in the exercise of his
infinite goodness, which is reflected in every part of the world,
graciously to make him a partaker of the treasure of heavenly wisdom — a
manner of prayer which is very emphatic. When, therefore, he says *that
the earth is full of God’s mercy,* it is a kind of earnest entreaty. He
not only magnifies the goodness of God, in general, (as he does in other
places,) in leaving no part of the world devoid of the proofs of his
liberality, and in exercising it not only towards mankind, but also
towards the brute creation. What does he then? He desires that the mercy
of God, which is extended to all creatures, may be manifested towards
him in one thing, and that is, by enabling him to make progress in the
knowledge of the Divine law. Whence we gather, that he accounted the
gift of understanding as an inestimable treasure. No if to be endued
with the spirit of understanding is a chief token of God’s favor, our
want of this, proceeding from our own unbelief, is an indication of our
alienation from him. It behooves us to remember what we have stated
elsewhere, that it is an evidence that we have given ourselves up to the
most shameful sloth, when, contented with a superficial knowledge of
Divine truth, we are, in a great measure, indifferent about making
further progress, seeing so renowned a teacher of the Church labored
with the greatest ardor to become more and more acquainted with God’s
statutes. Besides, it is certain that he does not here treat of external
teaching, but of the inward illumination of the mind, which is the gift
of the Holy Spirit. The law was exhibited to all without distinction;
but the prophet, well aware that unless he were enlightened by the Holy
Spirit, it would be of little advantage to him, prays that he may be
taught effectually by supernatural influence.

<span id="xxviii.ix-p5"></span>**65.** *O Jehovah! thou hast done good
to thy servant.* Some understand this generally, as if the prophet
protested that, in whatever way God dealt with him, he took it in good
part, convinced that it would ultimately issue in his welfare; but as
express mention is made of the Divine word or promise, the prophet, I
have no doubt, celebrates the faithfulness of God in performing the
grace which he had promised. I have really experienced (as if he had
said) that Thou art true, and dost not delude thy servants with empty
words. Special reference is therefore here made to God’s promises,
because thence all his benefits flow to us, not, indeed, as from the
original fountain-head, but, as it were, by conduit pipes. Although his
free goodness is the only cause which induces him to deal bountifully
with us, yet we can hope for nothing at his hand until he first bring
himself under obligation to us by his word.

<span id="xxviii.ix-p6"></span><span id="xxviii.ix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.ix-p7"></span>**66.** *Teach me goodness of taste and
acknowledge* After having confessed that he had found, by experience,
the faithfulness of God to his promises, David here adds a request
similar to what is contained in the 64th verse, namely, that he may grow
in right understanding; although the phraseology is somewhat different;
for instead of *thy statutes,* as in that verse, he here uses *goodness
of taste and knowledge.* As the verb <span
id="xxviii.ix-p7.1"></span>טעם *taam,* signifies *to taste,* the noun
which is derived from it properly denotes *taste* It is, however,
applied to the mind. David, there is no doubt, prays that knowledge,
accompanied with sound discretion and judgment, might. be imparted to
him. Those who read, disjunctively, *goodness and taste,* mar the whole
sentence. It is, however, necessary, in order to our arriving at the
full meaning, that the latter clause should be added. He asserts that he
*believed God’s commandments,* in other words, that he cheerfully
embraced whatever is prescribed in the law; and thus he describes
himself as docile and obedient. As it was by the guidance of the Holy
Spirit that he became thus inclined to obedience, he pleads that another
gift may be bestowed upon him — the gift of a sound taste and good
understanding. Whence we learn, that these two things, right affection
and good understanding, are indispensably necessary to the due
regulation of the life. The prophet already believed God’s commandments;
but his veneration for the law, proceeding from a holly zeal, led him to
desire conformity to it, and made him afraid, and not without cause, of
inconsiderately going astray. Let us then learn, that after God has
framed our hearts to the obedience of his law, we must, at the same
time, ask wisdom from him by which to regulate our zeal.

<span id="xxviii.ix-p8"></span><span id="xxviii.ix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.ix-p9"></span>**67.** *Before I was brought low I went
astray* As the verb <span id="xxviii.ix-p9.1"></span>ענה *anah,*
sometimes signifies *to speak,* or *to testify,* some adopt this
rendering, *Before I meditated upon thy statutes I went astray;* but
this seems too forced. Others go still farther from the meaning, in
supposing it to be, that when the prophet went astray, he had nothing to
say in answer to God. I will not stop to refute these conceits, there
being no ambiguity in the words. David in his own person describes
either that wantonness or rebellion, common to all mankind, which is
displayed in this, that we never yield obedience to God until we are
compelled by his chastisements. It is indeed a monstrous thing
obstinately to refuse to submit ourselves to Him; and yet experience
demonstrates, that so long as he deals gently with us, we are always
breaking forth into insolence. Since even a prophet of God required to
have his rebellion corrected by forcible means, this kind of discipline
is assuredly most needful for us. The first step in obedience being the
mortifying of the flesh, to which all men are naturally disinclined, it
is not surprising if God bring us to a sense of our duty by manifold
afflictions. Yea, rather as the flesh is from time to time obstreperous,
even when it seems to be tamed, it is no wonder to find him repeatedly
subjecting us anew to the rod. This is done in different ways. He
humbles some by poverty, some by shame, some by diseases, some by
domestic distresses, some by hard and painful labors; and thus,
according to the diversity of vices to which we are prone, he applies to
each its appropriate remedy. It is now obvious how profitable a truth
this confession contains. The prophet speaks of himself even as
Jeremiah, (<span id="xxviii.ix-p9.2"></span>[Jer
31:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer031.htm#018.md)<span
id="xxviii.ix-p9.2"></span>,) in like manner, says of himself, that he
was *“as* a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke;*”* but still he sets
before us an image of the rebellion which is natural to us all. We are
very ungrateful, indeed, if this fruit which we reap from chastisements
do not assuage or mitigate their bitterness. So long as we are
rebellious against God, we are, in a state of the deepest wretchedness:
now, the only means by which He bends and tames us to obedience, is his
instructing us by his chastisements. The prophet, at the same time,
teaches us by his own example, that since God gives evidence of his
willingness that we should become his disciples, by the pains he takes
to subdue our hardness, we should at least endeavor to become gentle,
and, laying aside all stubbornness, willingly bear the yoke which he
imposes upon us.

<span id="xxviii.ix-p10"></span>The next verse needs no explanation,
being nearly of the same import as the last verse of the former eight.
He beseeches God to exercise his goodness towards him, not by causing
him to increase in riches and honors, or to abound in pleasures, but by
enabling him to make progress in the knowledge of the law. It is usual
for almost all mankind to implore the exercise of God’s goodness towards
them, and to desire that he would deal bountifully with them, in the way
of gratifying the diversity of the desires into which they are severally
hurried by the inclinations of the flesh; but David protests that he
would be completely satisfied, provided he experienced God to be liberal
towards him in this one particular, which almost all men pass over with
disdain.

<span id="xxviii.ix-p11"></span><span id="xxviii.ix-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.ix-p12"></span>**69.** *The proud have weaved*  <span
id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) *lies against me* He declares that,
notwithstanding the malignant interpretation which the wicked put upon
all that he did, and their attempts, by this artifice, to turn him aside
from following after and loving uprightness, the state of his mind
remained unaltered. It is a severe temptation, when, although innocent,
we are loaded with reproach and infamy, and are not only assailed by
injurious words, but also held up to the odium of the world by wicked
persons, under some specious pretense or other. We see many who
otherwise are good people, and inclined to live uprightly, either become
discouraged, or are greatly shaken, when they find themselves so
unworthily rewarded. On this account the prophet’s example is the more
to be attended t that we may not be appalled by the malignity of men;
that we may not cease to nourish within us the fear of God, even when
they may have succeeded in destroying our reputation in the sight of our
fellow-creatures; and that we may be contented to have our piety shining
at the judgment-scat of God, although it may be defaced by the calumnies
of men. So long as we depend upon the judgment of men, we will always be
in a state of fluctuation, as has been already observed. Farther, let
our works be never so splendid, we know that they will be of no account
in the sight of God, if, in performing them, our object is to gain the
favor of the world. Let us therefore learn to cast our eyes to that
heavenly stage, and to despise all the malicious reports which men may
spread against us. Let us leave the children of this world to, enjoy
their reward, since our crown is laid up for us in heaven, and not on
the earth. Let us disentangle ourselves from the snares with which Satan
endeavors to obstruct us, by patiently bearing infamy for a season. The
verb <span id="xxviii.ix-p13.1"></span>טפל*, taphal,* which otherwise
signifies *to join together,* is here, by an elegant metaphor, taken for
*to weave,* or *to trim;* intimating that the enemies of the prophet not
only loaded him with coarse reproaches, but also invented crimes against
him, and did so with great cunning and color of truth, that he might
seem to be the blackest of characters. But though they ceased not to
weave for him this web, he was enabled to break through it by his
invincible constancy; and, exercising a strict control over his heart,
he continued faithfully to observe the law of God. He applies to them
the appellation of *proud;* and the reason of this, it may be
conjectured, is, that the persons of whom he speaks were not the common
people, but great men, who inflated with confidence in their honors and
riches, rose up against him with so much the more audacity. He evidently
intimates that they trampled him under their feet by their proud
disdain, just as if he had been a dead dog.

<span id="xxviii.ix-p14"></span>With this corresponds the statement in
the subsequent verse (70th) that *their heart is fat as grease,*  <span
id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md) — *a* vice too common among the
despisers of God. Whence is it that wicked men, whom their own
conscience gnaws within, vaunt themselves so insolently against the most
eminent servants of God, but because a certain grossness overgrows their
hearts, so that they are stupefied, and even frenzied by their own
obstinacy? But wonderful and worthy of the highest praise is the
magnanimity of the prophet, who found all his delight in the law of God:
it is as if he declared that this was the food on which he fed, and with
which he was refreshed in the highest degree; which could not have been
the case had not his heart been freed, and thoroughly cleansed from all
unhallowed pleasures.

<span id="xxviii.ix-p16"></span><span id="xxviii.ix-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.ix-p17"></span>**71.** *It has been good for me that I
was afflicted.* He here confirms the sentiment which we have previously
considered — that it was profitable to him to be subdued by God’s
chastisements, that he might more and more be brought back and softened
to obedience. By these words he confesses that he was not exempt from
the perverse obstinacy with which all mankind are infected; for, had it
been otherwise with him, the profit of which he speaks, when he says
that his docility was owing to his being brought low, would have been
merely pretended; even as none of us willingly submits his neck to God,
until He soften our natural hardness by the strokes of a hammer. It is
good for us to taste continually the fruit which comes to us from God’s
corrections, that they may become sweet to us; and that, in this way,
we, who are so rebellious and wayward, may suffer ourselves to be
brought into subjection.

<span id="xxviii.ix-p18"></span>The last verse also requires no
exposition, as it contains a sentiment of very frequent occurrence in
this psalm, and, in itself, sufficiently plain, — That he preferred
God’s law to all the riches of the world, the immoderate desire of which
so deplorably infatuates the great bulk of mankind. He does not compare
the law of God with the riches he himself possessed; but he affirms,
that it was more precious in his estimation than a vast inheritance.

<span id="xxviii.x-p4"></span><span id="xxviii.x-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.x-p5"></span>**73.** *Thy hands have made and fashioned
me.* The avowal of the prophet, that he had been created by the hand of
God, greatly contributed to inspire him with the hope of obtaining the
favor which he supplicates. As we are the creatures and the workmanship
of God, and as he has not only bestowed upon us vital motion, in common
with the lower animals, but has, in addition thereto, given us the light
of understanding and reasons — this encourages us to pray that he would
direct us to the obedience of his law. And yet the prophet does not call
upon God, as if He were under any obligations to him; but, knowing that
God never forsakes the work which he has begun, he simply asks for new
grace, by which God may carry on to perfection what he has commenced. We
have need of the assistance of the *law,* since all that is sound in our
understandings is corrupted; so that we cannot perceive what is right,
unless we are taught from some other source. But our blindness and
stupidity are still more strikingly manifest, from the fact that
teaching will avail us nothing, until our souls are renewed by Divine
grace. What I have previously said must be borne in mind.. That whenever
the prophet prays for understanding being imparted to him, in order to
his learning the Divine commandments, he condemns both himself and all
mankind as in a state of blindness; for which the only remedy is the
illumination of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="xxviii.x-p6"></span><span id="xxviii.x-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.x-p7"></span>**74.** *They who fear thee shall see me
and be glad.* This verse is either connected with the preceding, or it
includes other benefits of God, besides the blessing mentioned in that
verse. Whether the Psalmist adverts only to one particular species of
blessing, or speaks generally, he by these words highly extols the
benefits with which God had honored him, that all genuine saints in
common might experience joy on that account. He does not mean to say
that this joy proceeds solely from the trust which he reposed in God,
but that it also proceeds from this, — that, having been preserved by
him in a remarkable way, and loaded with many benefits, his hope had
received an ample reward. As God invites all his servants in common to
trust in him, it follows, that, whenever he exhibits a token of his
grace towards any one of them, he testifies to all that he is faithful
to his promises, and that they have no reason to be afraid of his
disappointing those who trust in him.

<span id="xxviii.x-p8"></span><span id="xxviii.x-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.x-p9"></span>**75** *I have known, O Jehovah / that thy
judgments are justice.* By *judgments,* in this psalm, we are to
understand the precepts of the law; but as the prophet immediately adds,
that he was justly chastised, he seems to use the word in this verse,
for the punishments by which God stirs up men to repentance. These two
words, <span id="xxviii.x-p9.1"></span>צדק, *tsedek, justice,* in the
first clause, and <span id="xxviii.x-p9.2"></span>אמונה *emunah truth,*
in the last, have here nearly the same signification. In the first
clause, the prophet confesses in general that God so regulates his
judgments, as to shut the mouths of the ungodly, should any of them
complain of his cruelty or rigor; and that such equity shines forth in
them, as to extort from us the confession that nothing is better for men
than in this way to be called back to the consideration of themselves.
He next exhibits an example of this in his own person. Even hypocrites
sometimes yield God the praise of justice when he chastises others, and
they never condemn his severity, so long as they themselves are spared.
But it is the property of true piety to be less austere and rigid
censors of the faults of others than of our own. The *knowledge* of
which the prophet speaks, is a sure evidence of his having made a strict
and earnest examination of himself; for, had he not well weighed his own
guilt, he could not by assured experience have learned the righteousness
of God in his afflictions. If it is considered preferable to take the
word *judgments* in its usual acceptation, the meaning of the text will
be: Lord, I know that thy law is holy and just, and severely as thou
hast afflicted me, I still retain the persuasion of this truth; for even
in my afflictions I discern the righteousness, which corresponds with
the character of thy word.

<span id="xxviii.x-p10"></span><span id="xxviii.x-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.x-p11"></span>**76** *I beseech thee let thy goodness
be for my consolation.* Although he has acknowledged that he had been
justly humbled, yet he desires that his sorrow may be alleviated by some
consolation. He implores God’s mercy, as what was essentially necessary
to relieve and cure his miseries. He thus shows that nothing can remove
sorrow from the faithful, until they feel that God is reconciled to
them. In the Word in which God offers his mercy, there is to be found no
small comfort for healing all the grief to which men are liable. But the
Psalmist is now speaking of *actual* mercy, if I may use that term, when
God by the very deed declares the favor which he has promised. Confiding
in the Divine promise, he already cherished in his heart a joy,
proceeding from the hope of receiving the communications of Divine
grace. But as all our hope would end in mere disappointment, did not God
at length appear as our deliverer, he requests the performance of that
which God had promised him. Lord, as if he had said, since thou hast
graciously promised to be ready to succor me, be pleased to make good
thy word in effect. The observation which I have previously made ought
to be remembered, That it is not in vain to remind God of his promise.
It would be presumption for men to come into His presence, did he not,
of his own mere good pleasure, open up the way for them. When the
Psalmist says, *to thy servant,* he does not claim God’s mercy
exclusively to himself, as if it had. been promised to him alone by some
special oracle; but he applies to himself what God has promised to the
whole Church, which it is the peculiar province of faith to do; for
unless I believe that I am one of those to whom God addresses himself in
his word, so that his promises belong to me in common with others, I
will never have the confidence to call upon him.

<span id="xxviii.x-p12"></span><span id="xxviii.x-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.x-p13"></span>**77.** *Let thy companions come unto
me.* In this verse, the Psalmist repeats and confirms almost the same
request as in the preceding verse, although in phraseology somewhat
different. As he had just now said, that his sorrow could not be
removed, nor his joy restored, in any other way than by God’s mercy
being exercised towards him; so now he affirms that he cannot have
without being reconciled to God. He thus distinguishes himself from
worldly men, who are very little affected with a concern about having
God reconciled to them; or, rather, who do not cease securely to enjoy
themselves, although God is angry with them. He distinctly affirms,
that, until he know that God is reconciled to him, he is a dead man even
while living; but that, on the other hand, whenever God shall cause his
mercy to shine upon him, he will be restored from death to life. By the
way, he intimates that he was deprived for a time of the tokens of God’s
fatherly favor; for it would have been needless for him to have wished
that *it might come to him,* had it not been removed from him. As an
argument for obtaining what he supplicates, he asserts that *the law of
God was his delight;* nor could he otherwise hope that God would be
merciful to him. Besides, no man truly feels what virtue is in the
Divine favor, but he who, placing his chief happiness in that alone, is
convinced that all who dissever themselves from God are miserable and
accursed; a truth which the prophet had learned from the law.

<span id="xxviii.x-p14"></span><span id="xxviii.x-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.x-p15"></span>**78.** *Let the proud be put to shame.*
We have already often had occasion to remark, that, in the Hebrew
language, the future tense is frequently used in the sense of the
optative mood, as here, — They *shall be put to shame,* for, *Let them
be put to shame.* Still it would not be unsuitable to explain the
meaning thus’ As the proud have dealt mischievously with me, and
molested me without a cause, the Lord will give them their reward. But
as almost all interpreters are agreed that this is a prayer, in the
translation of the verse I am unwilling to depart from the generally
received explanation, especially as the language is expressly addressed
to God himself. It is important to attend to the reason why the Psalmist
hopes that God will be an enemy to *his* enemies; namely, because they
wickedly and maliciously assaulted him. The word <span
id="xxviii.x-p15.1"></span>שקר*, sheker,* which I have rendered
*falsely,* is by some translated, *without a cause;* but they seem only
to hit upon the one half of the prophet’s meaning; for this word, in my
opinion, is to be referred to the stratagems and artifices by which the
wicked endeavored to destroy David. Whence we gather, that whenever we
are wrongfully persecuted by wicked men, we are invited to have recourse
directly to God for protection. At the same time, we are taught that we
have no reason to be abashed at their insolence; for, whatever power
they may arrogate to themselves, He will beat down their loftiness, and
lay it low, to their shame; so that, being confounded, they will serve
as an example, to teach others that nothing is more ridiculous than to
sing the song of triumph before the victory is gained. The verb <span
id="xxviii.x-p15.2"></span>אשיח, *asiach,* in the second clause of the
verse, may be rendered, *I* *will speak of,* as well as *I* *will
meditate upon;* implying, that, when he had obtained the victory, he
would proclaim the goodness of God, which he had experienced. *To speak
of God’s statutes,* is equivalent to declaring out of the law, how
faithfully he guards his saints, how securely he delivers them, and how
righteously he avenges their wrongs.

<span id="xxviii.x-p16"></span><span id="xxviii.x-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.x-p17"></span>**79.** *Let such as fear thee turn unto
me.* In this verse, which is connected with the preceding, the Psalmist
affirms, that the deliverance which he obtained would afford common
instruction to all the godly. My condition, as if he had said, may, for
a time, have disheartened the righteous, as well as increased the
insolence of my enemies; but now, taking courage, they will turn their
eyes to this joyful spectacle. Moreover, let us learn from the two
marks, by which he distinguishes true believers, what is the nature of
genuine godliness. He puts *the fear,* or *the reverence of God,* in the
first, place; but he immediately joins to it *the knowledge of Divine
truth,* to teach us that these two things are inseparably connected. The
superstitious, indeed, exhibit a fear of God of a certain kind, but it
is a mere show, which quickly vanishes. Besides, they weary themselves
in their own inventions to no purpose; for God will take no account of
any other services, but those which are performed in obedience to his
commandments. True religion, then, and the worship of God, have their
origin in faith — in the faith of what he has enjoined; so that no
person can serve God aright, but he who has been taught in His school.

<span id="xxviii.x-p18"></span><span id="xxviii.x-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.x-p19"></span>**80.** *Let my heart be sound in thy
statutes* Having, a little before, desired to be endued with a sound
understanding, he now prays, in a similar manner, for sincere affection
of heart. The understanding and affections, as is well known, are the
two principal faculties of the human soul, both of which he clearly
shows to be depraved and perverse, when he requests that his
understanding may be illuminated, and, at the same time, that his heart
may be framed to the obedience of the law. This plainly refutes all that
the Papists babble about free will. The prophet not only here prays that
God would help him, because his will was weak; but he testifies, without
qualification, that uprightness of heart is. the gift of the Holy
Spirit. We are, moreover, taught by these words, in what the true
keeping of the law consists. A great part of mankind, after having
carelessly framed their life according to the Divine law, by outward
obedience, think that they want nothing. But the Holy Spirit here
declares that no service is acceptable to God, except that which
proceeds from integrity of heart. As to the word, <span
id="xxviii.x-p19.1"></span>תמים*, thamim,* rendered *sound,* we have
elsewhere said, that *a sound heart* is set in opposition to a double or
deceitful heart. It is as if the prophet had said, that those who are
without dissimulation, and who offer to God a pure heart, yield
themselves truly to Him. When it is added, *that I may not be put to
shame,* it is intimated, that such shall be the undoubted issue as to
all the proud, who, disdaining the grace of God, lean upon their own
strength; and as to all hypocrites, who, for a time, parade themselves
in gay colors. The amount, then, is, that unless God govern us by his
Spirit, and keep us in the performance of our duty, so that our hearts
may be sound in his statutes, although our shame may be hidden for a
time, yea, although all men should praise us, and hold us in admiration,
yet we cannot avoid falling, at length, into dishonor and ignominy.

<span id="xxviii.xi-p4"></span><span id="xxviii.xi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xi-p5"></span>**81.** *My soul hath fainted for thy
salvation.* The Psalmist intimates that, although worn out with
continual grief, and perceiving no issue to his calamities, yet trouble
and weariness had not produced such a discouraging effect upon his mind,
as to prevent him from always reposing with confidence in God. To bring
out the meaning the more distinctly, we must begin at the second clause,
which is obviously added by way of exposition. There he affirms that he
trusts in God; and this is the foundation of all. But, intending to
express the invincible constancy of his trust, he tells us that he
patiently endured all the distresses, under which others succumb. We see
some embracing with great eagerness the promises of God; but their
ardor, within a short time, vanishes; or, at least, is quenched by
adversity. It was far otherwise with David. The verb <span
id="xxviii.xi-p5.1"></span>כלה, *kalah,* which signifies to *faint,* or
to *be consumed,* seems, indeed, at first sight, to convey a different
meaning. But the prophet, in this passage, as in other places, by
*fainting* means that *patience,* which those who are deprived of all
strength, and who seem to be already dead, continue to cherish, and
which inspires their hearts with secret groanings, and such as cannot be
uttered. This fainting, then, is opposed to the delicacy of those who
cannot suffer a long delay.

<span id="xxviii.xi-p6"></span><span id="xxviii.xi-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xi-p7"></span>**82** *My eyes have waxed dim in looking
for thy word* This verse is very similar to the preceding, —
transforming to the eyes what had been said before concerning the soul.
The only difference is, that, instead of *longing after salvation* or
*help,* the expression, *longing after God’s word compromise,* is here
used; for *salvation* is an act, as it is termed; that is to say, it
consists in effect, whereas *a promise* keeps us suspended in
expectation. God may not, all at once, openly perform what he has
promised; and, in this case, it being only in his word that he promises
us help, there is no other way by which we can hope for help, than by
our reposing on his word. As, then, the word precedes, in order, the
help which God affords, or, rather, as it is the manner in which it is
represented to our view, the prophet, when sighing after salvation, very
properly declares that he kept his eyes fixed on the Divine word, until
his sight failed him. Here we have presented to us the wonderful and
incredible power of patience, under the infirmity of the flesh, when,
being faint and deprived of all rigor, we have recourse to God for help,
even while it is hidden from us. In short, the prophet, to prevent it
from being supposed that he was too effeminate and faint-hearted,
intimates that his fainting was not without cause. In asking God, *When
wilt thou comfort me?* he shows, with sufficient plainness, that he was
for a long time, as it were, cast off and forsaken.

<span id="xxviii.xi-p8"></span><span id="xxviii.xi-p8.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xi-p9"></span>**83.** *For I have been as a bottle in
the smoke.*  <span id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) The particle <span
id="xxviii.xi-p10.3"></span>כי, *ki,* translated *for,* might also, not
improperly, be resolved into the adverb of time, *when;* so that we
might read the verse in one connected sentence, thus’ *When I was like a
dried bottle, I, nevertheless, did not forget thy law.* The obvious
design of the Psalmist is to teach us, that, although he had been proved
by severe trials, and wounded to the quick, he yet had not been
withdrawn from the fear of God. In comparing himself to a *bottle* or
*bladder,* he intimates that he was, as it were, parched by the
continual heat of adversities. Whence we learn, that that sorrow must
have been intense which reduced him to such a state of wretchedness and
emaciation, that like a shriveled bottle he was almost dried up. It,
however, appears that he intends to point cut, not only the severity of
his affliction, but also its lingering nature that he was tormented, as
it were, at a slow fire;  <span id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) even
as the smoke which proceeds from heat dries bladders by slow degrees.
The prophet experienced a long series of grief’s, which might have
consumed him a hundred times, and that, by their protracted and
lingering nature, had he not been sustained by the word of God. In
short, it is a genuine evidence of true godliness, when, although
plunged into the deepest afflictions, we yet cease not to submit
ourselves to God.

<span id="xxviii.xi-p12"></span><span id="xxviii.xi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xi-p13"></span>**84.** *How many are the days of thy
servant? etc.* Some read these two clauses apart, as if the first were a
general complaint of the brevity of human life, such as is to be met
with in other psalms, and more frequently in the book of Job; and next,
in their opinion, there follows a special prayer of the Psalmist, that
God would take vengeance upon his enemies. But I rather prefer joining
the two clauses together, and limit both to David’s afflictions; as if
it had been said, Lord, how long hast thou determined to abandon thy
servant to the will of the ungodly? when wilt thou set thyself in
opposition to their cruelty and outrage, in order to take vengeance upon
them? The Scriptures often use the word *days* in this sense; as, for
example, “the days of Egypt,” <span id="xxviii.xi-p13.1"></span>[Eze
30:9](../../../bib/kjv/eze030.htm#009.md)<span
id="xxviii.xi-p13.1"></span>; “the days of Babylon,” and “the days of
Jerusalem,” <span id="xxviii.xi-p13.2"></span>[Ps
137:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa137.htm#007.md)<span
id="xxviii.xi-p13.2"></span>; a word which, in other places, is called
*“*the day of visitation,” <span id="xxviii.xi-p13.3"></span>[Isa
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#003.md)<span
id="xxviii.xi-p13.3"></span>. By the use of the plural number, is
denoted a certain determinate portion of time, which, in other places,
is compared to the “days of an hireling,” <span
id="xxviii.xi-p13.4"></span>[Job
14:6](../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#006.md)<span
id="xxviii.xi-p13.4"></span>; <span id="xxviii.xi-p13.5"></span>[Isa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/isa016.htm#014.md)<span
id="xxviii.xi-p13.5"></span>. The Psalmist does not, then, bewail in
general the transitory life of man, but he complains that the time of
his state of warfare in this world had been too long protracted; and,
therefore, he naturally desires that it might be brought to a
termination. In expostulating with God about his trouble, he does not do
so obstinately, or with a murmuring spirit; but still, in asking how
long it will be necessary for him to suffer, he humbly prays that God
would not delay to succor him. As to the point of his stirring him up by
prayer to execute vengeance, we have elsewhere seen in what sense it was
lawful for him to make such a request; namely, because the vengeance
which he desired to see was such as is properly suitable to God. It is
certain that he had divested himself of all the corrupt affections of
the flesh, that he might, with a pure and undisturbed zeal, desire God’s
judgment. He, however, in this passage, only wishes in general to be
delivered by the hand of God from the wrongs which were inflicted upon
him, without adjudging to perdition his adversaries; for he was quite
contented, provided God appeared to defend him.

<span id="xxviii.xi-p14"></span><span id="xxviii.xi-p14.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xi-p15"></span>**85** *The proud*  <span
id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) *have digged pits for me.* He
complains that he had been circumvented by the frauds and artifices of
his enemies; as if he had said, They have not only endeavored to injure
me by open force and the violence of the sword, but have also
maliciously sought to destroy me by snares and secret arts. The
additional clause, *which thing is not according to thy Law,* is
introduced as an argument, to excite God to exercise his mercy; for he
is the more inclined to succor his servants, when he sees that the
attempts made upon their welfare involve the violation of his own Law.
At the same time, the Psalmist furnishes a proof of his own innocence,
intimating that he had deserved no such treatment at their hands, and
that whatever they practiced, he, notwithstanding, patiently kept
himself under restraint; not attempting any thing which he knew to be
contrary to the Divine Law.

<span id="xxviii.xi-p17"></span><span id="xxviii.xi-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xi-p18"></span>**86.** *All thy commandments are
truth.* In this verse he again confirms the statement, That, in whatever
ways he was afflicted, his mind had not been distracted by various
devices, because, trusting in the word of God, he never doubted of his
assistance. In the first place, he tells us, that the consideration, by
which he was armed for repelling all assaults, was this, That the
faithful, under the conduct of God, engage in a prosperous warfare, the
salvation which they hope for from his word being absolutely certain.
For this reason he declares, that *the commandments of God are true;* by
which encomium he teaches us, that those who rely upon the word of God
are out of all danger; and he lays down this truth, that such a support
may always sustain our courage. In the second place, he complains of the
treachery of his enemies, as he declared before. Here the word <span
id="xxviii.xi-p18.1"></span>שקר, *sheker,* is repeated, by which he
means, that they had no regard to equity. From this consideration also
he was led to entertain the hope of deliverance; for it is the peculiar
office of God to succor the poor and afflicted who are wrongfully
oppressed.

<span id="xxviii.xi-p19"></span><span id="xxviii.xi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xi-p20"></span>**87.** *They have almost consumed me
upon the earth.* He repeats, in somewhat different words, what he had
spoken a little before, that, although he had been sorely tempted, he
had nevertheless kept his footing, because he had not given up with true
religion. A single declaration of this fact would have been enough for
those who are perfect; but if we call to mind our own weakness, we will
readily confess that it was not unworthy of being repeatedly stated. We
not only forget the law of God when we are shaken by extreme conflicts,
but the greater part lose their courage even before they engage in the
conflict. On which account this wonderful strength of the prophet is
worthy of more special notice, who, although almost reduced to death,
yet never ceased to revive his courage by continual meditation on the
law. Nor is it in vain that he adds, that it was *upon the earth* that
his enemies had almost consumed him, conveying the idea, that, when the
fears of death presented themselves to him on all sides in this world,
he elevated his mind above the world. If faith reach to heaven, it will
be an easy matter to emerge from despair.

<span id="xxviii.xi-p21"></span><span id="xxviii.xi-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xi-p22"></span>**88.** *Quicken me according to thy
goodness* This verse contains nothing new. In the beginning of it David
represents his life as depending on God’s mercy, not only because he was
conscious of human frailty, but because he saw himself daily exposed to
death in multiplied forms, or rather because he was convinced, that were
God’s power withdrawn from him, he would be laid prostrate as if he were
dead. He next promises, that when he shall be again restored to life, he
will not be ungrateful, but will duly acknowledge this as a blessing
from God, and that not only with the tongue, but also in his whole life.
As the various instances in which God succors us and delivers us from
dangers are so many new lives, it is reasonable that we should dedicate
to his service whatever additional time is allotted to us in this world.
When the law is called *the testimony of God’s mouth,* by this eulogium
its authority is very plainly asserted.

<span id="xxviii.xii-p4"></span><span id="xxviii.xii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xii-p5"></span>**89** *Thy word, O Jehovah I endure for
ever.* Many explain this verse as if David adduced the stability of the
heavens as a proof of God’s truth. According to them the meaning is,
that God is proved to be true because the heavens continually remain in
the same state.  <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) Others offer a
still more forced interpretation, That God’s truth is more sure than the
state of the heavens. But it appears to me that the prophet intended to
convey a very different idea. As we see nothing constant or of long
continuance upon earth, he elevates our minds to heaven, that they may
fix their anchor there. David, no doubt, might have said, as he has done
in many other places, that the whole order of the world bears testimony
to the steadfastness of God’s word — that word which is most true. But
as there is reason to fear that the minds of the godly would hang in
uncertainty if they rested the proof of God’s truth upon the state of
the world, in which such manifold disorders prevail; by placing God’s
truth in the heavens, he allots to it a habitation subject to no
changes. That no person then may estimate God’s word from the various
vicissitudes which meet his eye in this world, heaven is tacitly set in
opposition to the earth. Our salvation, as if it had been said, being
shut up in God’s word, is not subject to change, as all earthly things
are, but is anchored in a safe and peaceful haven. The same truth the
Prophet Isaiah teaches in somewhat different words:

<span id="xxviii.xii-p9"></span>“All flesh is grass, and all the
godliness thereof is as the flower of the field,” (<span
id="xxviii.xii-p9.1"></span>[Isa
40:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#006.md)<span
id="xxviii.xii-p9.1"></span>.)

<span id="xxviii.xii-p10"></span>He means, according to the Apostle
Peter’s exposition, (<span id="xxviii.xii-p10.1"></span>[1Pe
1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024.md)<span
id="xxviii.xii-p10.1"></span>) that the certainty of salvation is to be
sought in the word, and, therefor that they do wrong who settle their
minds upon the world; for the steadfastness of God’s word far transcends
the stability of the world.

<span id="xxviii.xii-p11"></span><span id="xxviii.xii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xii-p12"></span>**90.** *Thy truth is from generation
to generation* In this verse the Psalmist repeats and confirms the same
sentiment. He expressly teaches, that although the faithful live for a
short time as strangers upon earth, and soon pass away, yet their life
is not perishable, since they are begotten again of an incorruptible
seed. He, however, proceeds still farther. He had before enjoined us to
pierce by faith into heaven, because we will find nothing in the world
on which we can assuredly rest; and now he again teaches us, by
experience, that though the world is subject to revolutions, yet in it
bright and signal testimonies to the truth of God shine forth, so that
the steadfastness of his word is not exclusively confined to heaven, but
comes down even to us who dwell upon the earth. For this reason, it is
added, that the earth continues steadfast, even as it was established by
God at the beginning. Lord, as if it had been said, even in the earth we
see thy truth reflected as it were in a mirror; for though it is
suspended in the midst of the sea, yet it continues to remain in the
same state. These two things, then, are quite consistent; first, that
the steadfastness of God’s word is not to be judged of according to the
condition of the world, which is always fluctuating, and fades away as a
shadow; and, secondly, that yet men are ungrateful if they do not
acknowledge the constancy which in many respects marks the frame. work
of the world; for the earth, which otherwise could not occupy the
position it does for a single moment, abides notwithstanding steadfast,
because God’s word is the foundation on which it rests. Farther, no
person has any ground for objecting, that it is a hard thing to go
beyond this world in quest of the evidences of God’s truth, since, in
that case, it would be too remote from the apprehension of men. The
prophet meets the objection by affirming, that although it dwells in
heaven, yet we may see at our very feet conspicuous proofs of it, which
may gradually advance us to as perfect knowledge of it as our limited
capacity will permit. Thus the prophet, on the one hand, exhorts us to
rise above the whole world by faith, so that the word of God may be
found by experience to be adequate, as it really is adequate, to sustain
our faith; and, on the other hand, he warns us that we have no excuse,
if, by the very sight of the earth, we do not discover the truth of God,
since legible traces of it are to be found at our feet. In the first
clause, men are called back from the vanity of their own understanding;
and, in the other; their weakness is relieved, that they may have a
foretaste upon earth of what is to be found more fully in heaven.

<span id="xxviii.xii-p13"></span><span id="xxviii.xii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xii-p14"></span>**91.** *By thy judgments they continue
to this day.* The word, <span id="xxviii.xii-p14.1"></span>היום,
*hayom,* which, following other interpreters, I have translated *to this
days might* not improperly *rendered daily, or every day.* In that case,
however, the sense would be substantially the same; for the prophet
means, that the whole order of nature depends solely upon the
commandment or decree of God. In using the term *judgments,* he makes an
allusion to the law, intimating, that the same regard to rectitude which
is exhibited in the law is brightly displayed in every part; of God’s
procedure. From this it follows, that men are very perverse, when, by
their unbelief, they do what they can to shake and impair the
faithfulness of God, upon which all creatures repose; and, moreover,
when by their rebellion they impeach his righteousness, and deny the
authority of his commands, upon which the stability of the whole world
depends. It is a harsh manner of expression to say, that *all the
elements are God’s servants;* but it expresses more than if it had been
said, that all things are ready to yield obedience to him. How can we
account for it, that the air, which is so thin, does not consume itself
by blowing incessantly? How can we account for it, that the waters do
not waste away by flowing, but on the principle that these elements obey
the secret command of God? By faith, it is true, we perceive that the
continued existence of the world is owing to the fiat of God; but all
who have the smallest pretensions to understanding are led to the same
conclusion, from the manifest and undoubted proofs of this truth, which
every where meet their eye. Let it then be thoroughly impressed upon our
minds, that all things are so governed and maintained by the secret
operation of God, as that their continuing in the same state is owing to
their obeying his commandment or word. We must always remember the point
which the prophet aims at; which is, that God’s faithfulness, which
shines forth in his external works, may gradually conduct us higher,
until we attain such a persuasion of the truth of heavenly doctrine as
is entirely free from doubt.

<span id="xxviii.xii-p15"></span><span id="xxviii.xii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xii-p16"></span>**92.** *Had not thy law been my
delight* The prophet continues to prosecute almost the same theme;
affirming, that he would have been undone, had he not in his calamities
sought consolation from the law of God. The adverb, <span
id="xxviii.xii-p16.1"></span>אז *az,* signifies *then;* but as it is
sometimes used for *a long time,* it is equivalent here to *long ago;*
unless some may prefer to consider it as a significant and emphatic
pointing to the thing, as if he were still in the state which he
describes. He confirms from his own experience what he had previously
said, to make it manifest that he did not speak of things with which he
was unacquainted, but that he asserts what he had really experienced, —
namely, that there is no other solace, and no other remedy for
adversity, but our reposing upon the word of God, and our embracing the
grace and the assurance of our salvation which are offered in it. He
here unquestionably commends the very same word, which he had but now
said dwelt in heaven. Though it resound on earth, enter into our ears,
and settle in our hearts, yet it still retains its celestial nature; for
it descends to us in such a manner, as that it is not subject to the
changes of the world. The prophet declares that he was grievously
oppressed by a weight of afflictions enough to overwhelm him; but that
the consolation which he derived from the Divine Law in such desperate
circumstances, was as life to him.

<span id="xxviii.xii-p17"></span><span id="xxviii.xii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xii-p18"></span>**93.** *I will never forget thy
statutes.* This verse contains a thanksgiving. As the law of the Lord
had preserved him, he engages that he will never forget it. Yet he, at
the same time, admonishes himself and others how necessary it is to
cherish in the heart the remembrance of the Divine Law; for though we
have found from experience its life-giving power, yet we easily allow it
to pass from our memories, and on this account God afterwards justly
punishes us, by leaving us for a long time to languish in our sadness.

<span id="xxviii.xii-p19"></span><span id="xxviii.xii-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xii-p20"></span>**94.** *I am thine, save me.* In the
first place, he takes encouragement to pray from the consideration, that
he is one of God’s own stamp and coinage, as we speak. In the second
place, he proves that he is God’s from the fact of his keeping his
commandments. This ought not, however, to be understood as if he boasted
of any merit which he possessed; as, in dealing with men, it is
customary to adduce something meritorious which we have done as an
argument for obtaining what we desire: — I have always loved and
esteemed you, I have always studied to promote your honor and advantage;
my service has always been ready at your command. But David rather
brings forward the unmerited grace of God, and that alone; for no man,
by any efforts of his own, acquires the high honor of being under the
protection of God — an honor which proceeds solely from his free
adoption. The blessing which God had conferred upon him is therefore
here adduced as an argument why he should not forsake the work which he
had commenced. When he affirms, that he was earnestly intent upon the
Divine commandments, that also depended upon the Divine calling; for he
did not begin to apply his mind to God’s commandments before he was
called and received into his household. As he desires, in this verse,
that the Lord would save him, so, in the next verse, he expresses the
need he had of being saved, saying, *that the wicked sought for him to
destroy him;* by which he, at the same time, declares the constancy of
his godliness, inasmuch as he then set his mind upon the law of God — a
point worthy of special notice. Those who, at other times, would the
forward and willing to follow God, know not to what side to turn
themselves when they are assailed by the wicked, and, in that case, are
very prone to follow unhallowed counsel. It is therefore a great virtue
to do God the honor of resting contented with his promises alone, when
the wicked conspire for our destruction, and when, to all human
appearance, our life is in jeopardy. *To consider God’s testimonies* is,
in this place, equivalent to applying our minds to the word of God,
which sustains us against all assaults, effectually allays all fears,
and restrains us from following any perverse counsels.

<span id="xxviii.xii-p21"></span><span id="xxviii.xii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xii-p22"></span>**96.** *In all perfection, I have seen
the end.*  <span id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) The prophet again,
using other words, commends the same truth which he had taught in the
first verse of this part — that the word of God is not subject to
change, because it is elevated far above the perishable elements of this
world. He here asserts, that there is nothing under heaven so perfect
and stable, or so complete, in all respects, as not to have an end; and
that the Divine word alone possesses such amplitude as to surpass all
bounds and limits. Since the verb <span id="xxviii.xii-p23.1"></span>כלה
*kalah,* signifies *to consume and finish,* as well as *to make
perfect,* some take the noun <span id="xxviii.xii-p23.2"></span>תכלה
*tichelah,* for *measure* or *end* But it is necessary to translate it
*perfection,* that the comparison may be the more apparent, and the
better to amplify the faithfulness of the Divine word; the idea which
the prophet intended to convey being, that, after he had considered all
things, especially those which are distinguished by the greatest
perfection, he found that they were nothing when compared with God’s
word, inasmuch as all other things will soon come to an end, whereas the
word of God stands ever firm in its own eternity.  <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) Whence it follows, that we have no
ground for apprehending that it will forsake us in the midst of our
course.. It is termed *broad,* to denote that, though a man may mount
above the heavens, or descend into the lowest depths, or traverse the
whole space from the right to the left hand, yet he will not reach
farther than the truth of God conducts us. It remains that our minds
should embrace this vast extent; and such will be the case when they
shall have ceased to enclose and shut themselves up within the narrow
limits of this world.

<span id="xxviii.xiii-p4"></span><span id="xxviii.xiii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiii-p5"></span>**97.** *O how have I loved thy law!*
Not contented with a simple affirmation, the prophet exclaims, by way of
interrogation, that he was inflamed with incredible love to the law of
God; and, in proof of this, he adds, that he was continually engaged in
meditating upon it. If any person boasts that he loves the Divine Law,
and yet neglects the study of it, and applies his mind to other things,
he betrays the grossest hypocrisy; for the love of the law, and
especially such an ardent love of it as the prophet here expresses,
always produces continual meditation upon it. And, assuredly, unless
God’s law inflame and ravish our hearts with the love of it, many
allurements will quickly steal upon us, and lead us away to vanity. The
prophet, then, here commends such a love of the law, as, possessing all
our senses, effectually excludes all the deceits and corruption’s to
which we are otherwise too much inclined.

<span id="xxviii.xiii-p6"></span><span id="xxviii.xiii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiii-p7"></span>**98.** *Thou hast made me wiser than
my adversaries* He here declares, that he was more learned than his
adversaries, his instructors, and the aged, because he was a scholar of
God’s law. It is in a different sense that he describes himself as
endued with understanding above his adversaries, from that in which he
describes himself as wiser than his teachers. He surpassed his enemies,
because their cunning and artifices availed them nothing when they
employed these to the utmost to effect his destruction. The malice of
the wicked is always goading them to do mischief; and as they are often
artful and deceitful, we are afraid lest our simplicity should be
imposed upon by their deceits, unless we use the same crafts and
underhand dealings which they practice. Accordingly, the prophet
glories, that he found in God’s law enough to enable him to escape all
their snares. When he claims the credit of being superior in knowledge
to his instructors, he does not mean to deny that they also had learned
from the word of God what was useful to be known. But he gives God
thanks for enabling him to surpass, in proficiency, those from whom he
had learned the first elements of knowledge.  <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) Nor is it any new thing for the
scholar to excel his master, according as God distributes to each man
the measure of understanding. The faithful, it is true, are instructed
by the pains and labor of men, but it is in such a way, as that God is
still to be regarded as enlightening them. And it is owing to this that
the scholar surpasses the master; for God means to show as it were, with
the finger, that he uses the service of men in such a way as that he
himself continues still the chief teacher. Let us therefore learn to
commit ourselves to his tuition, that we may glory with David, that by
his guidance we have proceeded farther than man’s instruction could lead
us. He adds the same thing respecting *the aged,* for the more abundant
confirmation of his statement. Age is of great avail in polishing, by
long experience and practice, men who, by nature, are dull and rude. Now
the prophet asserts, that he had acquired, by the Divine Law, more
discretion than belongs to aged men.  <span
id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) In short, he means to affirm, that
whoever yields himself with docility to God, keeps his thoughts in
subjection to his word, and exercises himself diligently in meditating
upon the Law, will thence derive wisdom sufficient for enabling him to
consult his own safety in opposition to the stratagems of his enemies,
to exercise circumspection requisite for escaping their deceits; and,
finally, to match with the most eminent masters through the whole course
of his life. David, however, does not adduce his wisdom, that he may
boast of it before the world; but, by his own example, he warns us, that
nothing is better for us than to learn at God’s mouth, since those only
are perfectly wise who are taught in his school. At the same time,
sobriety is here enjoined upon the faithful, that they may not seek for
wisdom elsewhere than from God’s word, and that ambition or curiosity
may not incite them to vain boasting. In short, all are here recommended
to behave themselves with modesty and humility, that no man may claim to
himself such knowledge as elevates him above the Divine Law; but that
all men, however intelligent, may willingly yield themselves to the
lessons of heavenly wisdom revealed in the Divine Word. When he says,
that *he kept God’s statutes,* he teaches us what kind of meditation it
is of which we have spoken, to let us know that he did not coldly
philosophies upon God’s precepts, but devoted himself to them with
earnest affection.

<span id="xxviii.xiii-p10"></span><span id="xxviii.xiii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiii-p11"></span>**101.** *I have restrained my feet
from every evil path* He intimates that he proclaimed war against every
vice, that he might wholly devote himself to the service of God. From
this we learn the profitable lesson, that in order to our keeping God’s
Law, we must, from the commencement, beware lest our feet should step
aside into crooked by-paths; for with a nature so corrupted as ours is,
amidst so many allurements, and with minds so fickle, we are in the
greatest danger of being led astray; yea, it is a rare miracle if any
man hold on in his life in a right course, without turning aside in one
direction or another. The faithful, therefore, have need to exercise the
greatest circumspection, in order to keep their feet from going astray.

<span id="xxviii.xiii-p12"></span>In the next verse, David commends his
own constancy in observing the Law. He declares that ever since he had
learned from God the right manner of living, he had pursued the right
course. As the way is so slippery, and our feet so feeble, and our whole
disposition so prone to go astray after innumerable errors, no small
exertions are requisite on our part, in order to avoid declining from
God’s judgments. But we must attend to the manner of teaching to which
the Psalmist refers; for though all, without exception, to whom God’s
word is preached, are taught, yet scarce one in ten so much as tastes
it; yea, scarce one in a hundred profits to the extent of being enabled,
thereby, to proceed in a right course to the end. A peculiar manner of
teaching is, therefore, here pointed out — that which consists in God’s
drawing his chosen people to himself. I have been brought, as if the
Psalmist had said, into the way of salvation, and preserved in it by the
secret influence of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="xxviii.xiii-p13"></span><span id="xxviii.xiii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiii-p14"></span>**103.** *O how sweet have been thy
words to my palate!* He again repeats what he had previously stated in
different words, that he was so powerfully attracted by the sweetness of
the Divine Law, as to have no desire after any other delight. It is
possible that a man may be affected with reverence towards the Law of
God; but no one will cheerfully follow it, save he who has tasted this
sweetness. God requires from us no slavish service: he will have us to
come to him cheerfully, and this is the very reason why the prophet
commends the sweetness of God’s word so often in this psalm. If it is
demanded in what sense he declares that he took such sweet delight in
God’s Law, which, according to the testimony of Paul, (<span
id="xxviii.xiii-p14.1"></span>[1Co
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009.md)<span
id="xxviii.xiii-p14.1"></span>,) does nothing else but strike fear into
men, the solution is easy: The prophet does not speak of the dead letter
which kills those who read it, but he comprehends the whole doctrine of
the Law, the chief part of which is the free covenant of salvation. When
Paul contrasts the Law with the Gospel, he speaks only of the
commandments and threatening. Now if God were only to command, and to
denounce the curse, the whole of his communication would, undoubtedly,
be deadly. But the prophet is not here opposing the Law to the Gospel;
and, therefore, he could affirm that the grace of adoption, which is
offered in the Law, was sweeter to him than honey; that is to say, that
no delight was to him equal to this. What I have previously said must be
remembered, that the Law of God will be unsavory to us, or, at least,
that it will never be so sweet to us, as to withdraw us from the
pleasures of the flesh, until we have struggled manfully against our own
nature, in order to subdue the carnal affections which prevail within
us.

<span id="xxviii.xiii-p15"></span><span id="xxviii.xiii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiii-p16"></span>**104** *By thy statutes I have
acquired understanding* The prophet seems here to invert the order he
has just now laid down. He observed that he had kept his feet from going
astray, that he might observe God’s Law, and now he institutes a
contrary order, beginning with the observance of the Law; for he
declares that he had been taught by the word of God before he amended
his faults. Yet these two things are not inconsistent, — that the
faithful should withdraw themselves from their wanderings, in order to
frame their life according to the rule of God’s word, and that when they
are already advanced a considerable way in a holy life, the fear of God
being then more vigorous in them, they should regard all vices with more
intense hatred. The beginning of a good life, unquestionably, is when a
man endeavors to purge himself from vices; and the more a man has made
progress in a good life, he will burn with a, proportionate zeal in his
detestation of vices and in shunning them. Moreover, we are taught by
the words of the prophet, that the reason why men are so involved in
falsehoods, and entangled in perverse errors, is, because they have not
learned wisdom from the word of God. As the whole world are given to
folly, those who wander astray plead in excuse, that it is difficult for
them to guard against the allurements of vice. But the remedy will be
near at hand, if we follow the counsel of the prophet; that is to say,
if, instead of leaning on our own wisdom, we seek understanding from the
word of God, in which he not only shows what is right:. but also
fortifies our minds, and puts us on our guard against all the deceits of
Satan, and all the impostures of the world. Would to God that, at the
present day, this were thoroughly impressed on the minds of all who
boast themselves of being Christians; for then they would not be
continually driven about, as the greater part of them are, with such
inconstancy, according to the conflicting impulses of prevailing
opinions. As Satan is so sedulously exerting himself to spread abroad
the mists of error, let us apply ourselves with the greater earnestness
to the acquisition of this wisdom.

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p4"></span><span id="xxviii.xiv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p5"></span>**105.** *Thy word is a lamp to my
feet.* In this verse the Psalmist testifies that the Divine Law was his
schoolmaster and guide in leading a holy life. He thus, by his own
example, prescribes the same rule to us all; and it is highly necessary
to observe this rule; for while each of us follows what seems good in
his own estimation, we become entangled in inextricable and frightful
mazes. The more distinctly to understand his intention, it is to be
noted, that the word of God is set in opposition to all human counsels.
What the world judges right is often crooked and perverse in the
judgment of God, who approves of no other manner of living, than that
which is framed according to the rule of his law. It is also to be
observed, that David could not have been guided by God’s word, unless he
had first renounced the wisdom of the flesh, for it is only when we are
brought to do this, that we begin to be of a teachable disposition. But
the metaphor which he uses implies something more; namely, that unless
the word of God enlighten men’s path, the whole of their life is
enveloped in darkness and obscurity, so that they cannot do anything
else than miserably wander from the right way; and again, that when we
submit ourselves with docility to the teaching of God’s law, we are in
no danger of going astray. Were there such obscurity in God’s word, as
the Papists foolishly talk about, the commendation with which the
prophet here honors the law would be altogether undeserved. Let us,
then, be assured that an unerring light is to be found there, provided
we open our eyes to behold it. The Apostle Peter (<span
id="xxviii.xiv-p5.1"></span>[2Pe
1:19](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#019.md)<span
id="xxviii.xiv-p5.1"></span>) has more plainly expressed the same
sentiment, when he commends the faithful for taking heed to the word of
prophecy, “as unto a light that shineth in a dark place.”

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p6"></span><span id="xxviii.xiv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p7"></span>**106.** *I have sworn, and will
perform* Here the Psalmist speaks of his own constancy. He had declared
a little before, that during the whole course of his life, he had not
declined from God’s law, and now he speaks of the purpose of his mind.
By the word *swear,* he intimates that he had solemnly pledged himself
to God not to alter his determination. The true manner of keeping God’s
law is to receive and embrace what he commands heartily, and, at the
same time, uniformly, that our ardor may not forthwith abate, as is
often the case. This also is the proper rule of vowing, that we may
offer ourselves to God, and dedicate our life to him. It may, however,
be asked, whether the prophet’s oath may not be condemned as rash,
inasmuch as he presumed to engage to do far more than man’s ability is
equal to; for who is able to keep the law? The man, then, it may be
alleged, vows rashly, who promises to God a thing which it is beyond his
power to accomplish. The answer is obvious: Whenever the faithful vow to
Him, they do not look to what they are able to do of themselves, but
they depend upon the grace of God, to whom it belongs to perform what he
requires from them, in the way of supplying them with strength by his
Holy Spirit. When the question is in reference to service to be rendered
to God, they cannot vow anything without the Holy Spirit; for, as Paul
says in <span id="xxviii.xiv-p7.1"></span>[2Co
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#005.md)<span
id="xxviii.xiv-p7.1"></span>*,*

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p8"></span>*“*Not that are sufficient of ourselves
to think anything  
as of ourselves.”

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p9"></span>But when God stretches forth his hand to
us, he bids us be of good courage, and promises that he will never fail
us; and this is the source from which the boldness to swear, here spoken
of, proceeds. Nor is it any rashness at all, when, confiding in his
promises, by which he anticipates us, we, on our part, offer ourselves
to his service. The question, however, still remains unsolved; for
although the children of God ultimately prove victorious over all
temptations by the grace of the Holy Spirit, yet there is always some
infirmity about them. But it is to be observed, that the faithful, in
making vows and promises, have a respect not only to that article of the
covenant, by which God has promised that he will cause us to walk in his
commandments, but also to that other article which is, at the same time,
added concerning the free forgiveness of their sins, <span
id="xxviii.xiv-p9.1"></span>[Ezek.
11:20](../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#020.md), [Ezek.

103:13](../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#013.md)<span
id="xxviii.xiv-p9.2"></span>. David, therefore, according to the measure
of grace given him, bound himself by oath to keep God’s la encouraged by
these words of the prophet,

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p10"></span>“I will spare them, as a man spareth

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p12"></span>**107.** *I am greatly afflicted, O
Jehovah!* This verse teaches, that God did not cherish the fathers under
the law in his bosom so delicately as not to exercise them with grievous
temptations; for the Psalmist declares that he was not afflicted
lightly, or in an ordinary degree, but above measure. His prayer *to be
quickened* implies that he was at the point of death. He, however, at
the same time, shows, that though he was besieged by death, he yet
fainted not, because he leaned upon God — a point worthy of special
notice; for though, at the beginning, we may call upon God with much
alacrity, yet when the trial increases in severity, our hearts quail,
and, in the extremity of fear, our confidence is extinguished. Yet the
prophet implores God for grace, not in order to his life being preserved
in safety, but in order to his recovering the life he had lost, which
indicates both the low condition to which he was reduced, and his
continued confidence in God. We must also observe attentively the last
part of the clause*, according to thy word* We will pray coldly, or
rather we will not pray at all, if God’s promise does not inspire us
with courage in our sorrow and distress. In short, as we have said
elsewhere, it is indispensably necessary that we should have this key at
hand, in order to our having free access to the throne of grace.

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p13"></span><span id="xxviii.xiv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p14"></span>**108.** *O Jehovah! I beseech thee,
let the flee-will-offerings of my mouth.* This verse may be read in one
connected sentence, as well as divided into two members. According to
the former view, the sense will be, Receive, e Lord, my sacrifices, to
this end, that thou mayest teach me thy commandments. If we prefer
dividing the verse into two clauses, then it will consist of two
separate prayers; first, a prayer that God would accept the prophet’s
sacrifices; and, secondly, a prayer that he would instruct him in the
doctrine of the law. I am rather inclined to follow the first opinion.
The prophet affirms, as we have seen elsewhere, that nothing was more
precious to him than to understand the doctrine of the law. Lord, as if
he had said, do thou, according to thy good pleasure, accept the
sacrifices which I offer thee; and as my chief desire is, to be
instructed aright in thy law, grant that I may be a partaker of this
blessing, which I am so anxious to obtain. We should mark all the places
in which the knowledge of divine truth is preferred to all the other
benefits bestowed upon mankind; and doubtless, since it contains in it
the pledge of everlasting salvation, there is good reason why it should
be esteemed as an inestimable treasure. Yet the prophet begins at a
point remote from this, praying that God would vouchsafe to approve of
and accept his services. By the word <span
id="xxviii.xiv-p14.1"></span>נדבות, *nidboth,* I have no doubt he
denotes the sacrifices which were called *free-will-offerings.* I indeed
grant that he speaks properly of vows and prayers; but as the chosen
people to propitiate God, were wont to offer sacrifices, according as
every man had ability, he alludes to that custom which prevailed under
the law; even as Hosea (<span id="xxviii.xiv-p14.2"></span>[Ho
14:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002.md)<span
id="xxviii.xiv-p14.2"></span>) designates the praises of God “the calves
of the lips.” It was the design of God, by that ceremony, to testify to
the fathers that no prayers were acceptable to him, but those which were
joined with sacrifice, that they might always turn their minds to the
Mediator. In the first place, he acknowledges that he was unworthy of
obtaining any thing by his prayers, and that, if God heard him, it
proceeded from his free and unmerited grace. In the second place, he
desires that God would be favorable to him in the way of enabling him to
profit aright in the doctrine of the law. The verb, <span
id="xxviii.xiv-p14.3"></span>רצה *ratsah,* which he uses: signifies *to
favor of mere good will.* Whence it follows, that there is nothing
meritorious in our prayers, and that, whenever God hears them, it is in
the exercise of his free goodness.

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p15"></span><span id="xxviii.xiv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p16"></span>**109.** *My soul is continually in my
hand.* He declares, that no calamities, afflictions, or dangers, which
he had experienced: had withdrawn him from the service of God, and the
observance of his law. *To bear his soul in his hand,* is equivalent to
his being in danger of his life, so that the soul was, as it were
abandoned to the wind. Thus Job, (<span
id="xxviii.xiv-p16.1"></span>[Job
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#014.md)<span
id="xxviii.xiv-p16.1"></span>,) when he pines in his miseries: and is
looking for death every moment, and dreading it, complains that his soul
was in his hand; as if he had said, It is plucked from its own
dwelling-place: and is under the dominion of death.  <span
id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) This form of expression is therefore
unhappily wrested to an absurd meaning by ignorant people, who
understand the prophet as intimating, that it was in his own power to
govern his life as he pleased. So far from intending to convey such an
idea, by this circumstance he commends his own piety, declaring, that
although he was tossed among shipwrecks, and death in a hundred forms
hovered before his eyes, so that he could not rest in security for a
single moment, yet he had not cast from him the love and study of the
Divine law. Here, again, it is well to notice the severe and arduous
conflicts by which the fathers, under the law, were tried, that dangers
and fears may not frighten us, or, by the weariness they produce,
deprive us of courage, and thus prevent the remembrance of the Divine
law from remaining impressed on our hearts.

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p18"></span><span id="xxviii.xiv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p19"></span>**110.** *The wicked have laid a snare
for me* The meaning of this verse is similar to that of the preceding.
The prophet shows more definitely in what respect he carried his life in
his hand; namely, because, being hemmed in on all sides by the snares of
the wicked, he saw scarcely any hope of life. We have previously
observed how difficult it is to avoid wandering from the ways of the
Lord, when our enemies, by their subtle arts, endeavor to effect our
destruction. The depraved desire of our fallen nature incites us to
retaliate, nor do we see any way of preserving our life, unless we
employ the same arts by which they assail us; and we persuade ourselves
that it is lawful for us to howl among wolves. Such being the ease, we
ought, with the more attention, to meditate upon this doctrine, That,
when the wicked environ and besiege us by their wiles, the best thing we
can do is to follow whither God calls us, and to attempt nothing but
what is agreeable to his will.

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p20"></span><span id="xxviii.xiv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p21"></span>**111.** *I have thy testimonies as an
inheritance for ever.* He again confirms the sentiment, which cannot be
too often repeated, That the law of God was more precious to him than
all the pleasures, riches, and possessions, of the world. I have said,
that it is not in vain that these things are so often repeated; for we
see how violently the men of the world boil to gratify their unruly
lusts, with what multiplied anxieties they are agitated, while they are
unceasingly coveting innumerable objects; and, in the meantime, scarcely
one in a hundred is, in a moderate degree, aiming to apply his mind to
the study of the Divine law. The prophet, then, to stir us up by his own
example, asserts, that he took such pleasure in God’s, testimonies as to
esteem nothing more precious. It is love only which leads us to set a
value on any object; and, therefore, it is requisite, in order to our
observing the Divine law with the reverence due to it, that we begin
with this delight in it. It is not wonderful, if God’s testimonies
convey to our minds *a joy,* which, causing us to reject and despise all
other things, holds our affections fast bound to them. What can be
sweeter than to have heaven opened to us, that we may come freely into
the presence of God, when, adopting us to be his children, he pardons
our sins? What can be more desirable than to hear that he is so pacified
towards us, as to take upon himself the care of our life? This I have
thought good to observe briefly, that we might not think it strange to
find David rejoicing so greatly in God’s law. The similitude of
*inheritance* is of frequent occurrence in the Scriptures; and we apply
the designation of *inheritance* to that which we hold in the highest
estimation, so that we are contented to be deprived of all other things,
provided we retain the safe and full possession of that one thing.
Accordingly, the prophet intimates, that whatever good things he had
obtained he accounted them as adventitious, and that the truths revealed
in God’s word alone were to him as an inheritance. Without the Divine
word all other things were in his estimation as nothing; so that he
could willingly leave to others, riches, honors, comforts, and
pleasures, provided he possessed this incomparable treasure. It is not
meant to say that he; altogether despised the temporal benefits which
God bestows, but his mind was not bound fast to them.

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p22"></span><span id="xxviii.xiv-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p23"></span>**112.** *I have inclined my heart to
perform thy statutes.* In this verse he describes the right observance
of the law, which consists in Our cheerfully and heartily preparing
ourselves for doing what the law commands. Slavish and constrained
obedience differs little from rebellion. The prophet, therefore, in
order briefly to define what it is to serve God, asserts, that he
applied not only his hands, eyes, or feet, to the keeping of the law,
but that he began with the affection of the heart. Instead of the verb
*incline,* the verb *extend* might with propriety be employed; but I am
inclined to rest in the more generally received interpretation, which
is, that he devoted himself with sincere affection of heart to the
observance of the law. This inclination of the heart is oppose to the
wandering lusts which rise up against God, and drag us any where rather
than incline us to a virtuous life. The attempt of the Papists to defend
from this passage their doctrine of free will is mere trifling. They
infer from the words of the prophet, that it is in the power of man to
bend his own heart in whatever way he pleases. But the answer is easy.
The prophet does not here boast of what he had done by his own strength,
for he now repeats the very same word which he had employed before, when
he said, *Incline my heart to these testimonies.* If that prayer was not
feigned, he doubtless acknowledged by it that it was the peculiar work
of the Holy Spirit to incline and frame our hearts to God. But it is no
new thing for that to be ascribed to us which God works in us: Paul’s
statement to this effect is very plain,

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p24"></span>“It is God who worketh in you, both to
will and to do of his good pleasures” (<span
id="xxviii.xiv-p24.1"></span>[Php
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013.md)<span
id="xxviii.xiv-p24.1"></span>.)

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p25"></span>When the prophet says of himself that
*he inclined his heart,* he does not separate his own endeavor from the
grace of the Holy Spirit, by whose inspiration he has previously
declared that the whole was done. At the same time, he distinguishes the
constancy of his pious affection from the transient favor of others.
Thus, that he might not fail in the midst of his course, or even go
backward, he affirms that he had resolved to continue in the same course
during the whole of his life. The word <span
id="xxviii.xiv-p25.1"></span>עקב, *ekeb, to the end,* in my opinion, is
added to the word <span id="xxviii.xiv-p25.2"></span>לעולם, *leolam, for
ever,* by way of exposition; and to show us that he struggled manfully
against all obstacles and difficulties, that they might not break his
constancy; for no man perseveres in the service of God without arduous
exertions. Some take the word as denoting *a reward;*  <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md) but this seems too foreign to the
design of the passage.

<span id="xxviii.xv-p4"></span><span id="xxviii.xv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p5"></span>**113.** *I have hated crooked thoughts.*
Those who are of opinion that the word <span
id="xxviii.xv-p5.1"></span>סעפום *seaphim,* the first in the verse, and
which is rendered *crooked thoughts,* is an appellate noun, translate
it, *those who think evil;*  <span id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) but
it is more correct to understand it of the thoughts themselves,  <span
id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) and this interpretation is very
generally adopted. The noun <span id="xxviii.xv-p7.4"></span>סעף,
*saeph,* properly signifies *a branch,* but it is applied metaphorically
to the *thoughts,* which, growing out of the heart, as branches from the
trunk of a tree, spread themselves in every direction. As there is no
doubt that in this passage the term is taken in a bad sense, I have
added the epithet, *crooked,* which the etymology of the word requires.
 <span id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) As the branches of a tree shoot
out transversely, entangled and intertwined, so the thoughts of the
human mind are, in like manner, confusedly mingled together, turning and
twisting about in all directions. Some Jewish interpreters understand it
of the laws of the heathen, which, they say, were cut off from the law
of God, as branches from a tree; but although this is ingenious, it has
no solidity. I therefore keep by the more simple explanation, That the
crooked inventions of the human heart, and whatever the wicked devise,
according to their own perverse understandings, are set in opposition to
the law of God, which alone is right. And, assuredly, whoever would
truly embrace the law of God, must, necessarily, as his first business,
divest himself of all unhallowed and sinful thoughts, or rather go out
of his own nature. Such is the meaning, unless, perhaps, preferring
another metaphor, we understand <span id="xxviii.xv-p8.2"></span>סעפום,
*seaphim,* to signify *high thoughts,* since the verb <span
id="xxviii.xv-p8.3"></span>סעף, *saaph,* is taken for *to lift up.* Now
we know that no sacrifice is more acceptable to God than obedience, when
we entertain low thoughts of ourselves; and thus our docility begins
with humility. But as this exposition may seem also far-fetched, I pass
from it. Let what I have: said suffice us, That since God acknowledges
as the disciples of his law those only who are well purified from all
contrary imaginations, which corrupt our understanding, the prophet here
protests that he is an enemy to all crooked thoughts, which are wont to
draw men hither and thither.

<span id="xxviii.xv-p9"></span><span id="xxviii.xv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p10"></span>**114.** *Thou art my hiding place and
my shield.* The meaning is, that the prophet, persuaded that the only
way in which he could be safe, was by lying hid under the wings of God,
confided in his promises, and, therefore, feared nothing. And,
assuredly, the first point is, that the faithful should hold it as a
settled principle, that amidst the many dangers to which they are
exposed, the preservation of their life is entirely owing to the
protection of God; in order that they may be excited to flee to him, and
leaning upon his word, may confidently wait for the deliverance which he
has promised. This confidence, *That God is our refuge and our shield,*
is, no doubt, derived from the word; but we must remember that there is
here a mutual relation — that, when we have learned from the word of God
that we have in him a safe hiding-place, this truth is to be cherished
and confirmed in our hearts, under a consciousness of our absolute need
of the divine protection. Besides, although his power ought abundantly
to suffice in inspiring us with the hope of salvation, yet we should
always set the word before us, that our faith may not fail when his aid
is slow in coming.

<span id="xxviii.xv-p11"></span><span id="xxviii.xv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p12"></span>**115.** *Depart from me, ye wicked!*
Some explain this verse as if David declared that he would devote
himself with more alacrity and greater earnestness to the keeping of the
law, when the wicked should have desisted from assaulting him. And,
unquestionably, when we feel that God has delivered us, we are more than
stupid if this experience does not stir up within us an earnest desire
to serve him. If godliness does not increase in us in proportion to the
sense and experience we have of God’s grace, we betray base ingratitude.
This, then, is a true and useful doctrine; but the prophet meant to
convey a different sentiment in this place. As he saw how great a
hindrance the ungodly are to us, he banishes them to a distance from
him; or rather, he testifies that he will beware of entangling himself
in their society. Nor has he said this so much for his own sake as to
teach us by his example, that if we would hold on in the way of the Lord
without stumbling, we must endeavor, above all things, to keep at the
greatest possible distance from worldly and wicked men, not in regard to
distance of place, but in respect of intercourse and conversation.
Provided we contract an intimate acquaintance with them, it is scarcely
possible for us to avoid being speedily corrupted by the contagion of
their example. The dangerous influence of fellowship with wicked men is
but too evident from observation; and to this it is owing, that few
continue in their integrity to the close of life, the world being
fraught with corruption’s. From the extreme infirmity of our nature, it
is the easiest thing in the world to catch infection, and to contract
pollution even from the slightest touch. The prophet, then, with good
reason, bids the wicked depart from him, that he may advance in the fear
of God without obstruction. Whoever entangles himself in their
companionship will, in process of time, proceed the length of abandoning
himself to a contempt, of God, and of leading a dissolute life. With
this statement agrees the admonition of Paul, in <span
id="xxviii.xv-p12.1"></span>[2Co
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014.md)<span
id="xxviii.xv-p12.1"></span>, “Be ye not unequally yoked together with
unbelievers.” It was, indeed, beyond the prophet’s power to chase the
wicked to a distance from him; but by these words he intimates, that
from henceforth he will have no intercourse with them. He emphatically
designates God as *his God,* to testify that he makes more account of
him alone than of all mankind. Finding extreme wickedness universally
prevailing on the earth, he separated himself from men, that he might
join himself wholly to God. At the present day, that bad examples may
not carry us away to evil, it greatly concerns us to put God on our
side, and to abide constantly in him, because he is ours.

<span id="xxviii.xv-p13"></span><span id="xxviii.xv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p14"></span>**116.** *Sustain me by thy word, and I
shall live.* Many read, *According to thy word,* so that the letter
<span id="xxviii.xv-p14.1"></span>ב, *beth,* which signifies in, is
taken for the letter <span id="xxviii.xv-p14.2"></span>כ, *caph,* which
signifies *as;* and thus the sense would be, Sustain me according to the
promise which thou hast made to me, or, as thou hast promised to me.
And, undoubtedly, whenever God stretches out his hand to us to raise us
up when we are fallen, or supports us with his hand, he fulfills his
promises. The prophet, however, seems to pray, that constancy of faith
may be given him, to enable him to continue steadfast in the divine
word. We are said to fall from God’s word when we fall from the faith of
it; and in like manner, so long as we repose upon the truth and
certainty of it, he is our sustainer. But, as the prophet well knew that
there is not strength in man adequate to this, he asks from God ability
to persevere as the singular gift of the Holy Spirit. It follows, then,
that true stability is to be found no where else but in the word of God;
and that no man can steadfastly lean upon it but he who is strengthened
by the power of the Holy Spirit. We must therefore always beseech God,
who alone is the author and finisher of faith, to maintain in us this
grace. Farther, when the Psalmist places life in faith, he teaches, that
all that men promise themselves without the word is mere falsehood. It
is therefore the Lord alone who quickens us by his word, even as it is
said in Habakkuk, (<span id="xxviii.xv-p14.3"></span>[Hab
2:4](../../../bib/kjv/hab002.htm#004.md)<span
id="xxviii.xv-p14.3"></span>,) “The just shall live by faith.” Both
passages have the same meaning. After Habakkuk has derided the foolish
confidence of the flesh, with which men are generally inflated, and as
manifested in their raising themselves on high that they may fall with
the greater violence, he shows, that the faithful alone, whom the word
of God sustains, stand upon safe and sure ground.

<span id="xxviii.xv-p15"></span>If the first interpretation is adopted,
the second clause, *make me not ashamed of my expectation,* will be
added by way of exposition; for these two things — the prayer that the
prophet maybe preserved by God’s grace according to his word, and the
prayer that he may reap the fruit of his hope — would amount to nearly
the same thing. Yet, after having beseeched God to grant him constancy
to persevere, he seems now to proceed farther, praying that God would,
in very deed, show the thing which he had promised. Every man’s own
infirmity bears witness to the many doubts which intrude into our minds,
when, after long endurance, the issue is not answerable to our
expectation; for God, in that case:. seems to disappoint us.

<span id="xxviii.xv-p16"></span>To the same effect is the next verse,
except that no express mention is made of the word; and *safety* is put
for *life.* The prophet means to say, that whenever God withdrew his
word, it would be all over with his safety; but that, if he were
established by the Divine power, there was nothing of which he would
have reason to be afraid. The verb <span id="xxviii.xv-p16.1"></span>שעה
*shaah,* which we have translated *I will consider,* is rendered by
many, *I will delight,* and this sense is not unsuitable; for although
God may give a very desirable taste of his goodness in his bare word,
yet the savor of it is not a little increased when to the word the
effect is added, provided we do not perversely separate God’s benefits
from his promises. It is the true wisdom of faith to consider all his
benefits as the result or fruit of his promises, of which, if we make no
account, the enjoyment of all his good things will be of little
advantage to us, or rather will often prove hurtful and deadly. Yet it
appears to me preferable to render the verb by *consider;* for the more
experience any man has of God’s help, the more ought he to awaken
himself to consider heavenly doctrine. The Psalmist adds, that he will
continue to persevere in this meditation during the whole of his life.

<span id="xxviii.xv-p17"></span><span id="xxviii.xv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p18"></span>**118.** *Thou hast trodden under foot
all those who wander from thy statutes.* By *treading under foot* he
means, that God overthrows all the despisers of his law, and casts them
down from that loftiness which they assume to themselves. The phrase is
directed against the foolish, or rather frantic, confidence with which
the wicked are inflated, when they recklessly deride the judgments of
God; and, what is more, scruple not to magnify themselves against him,
as if they were not subject to his power. The last clause is to be
particularly noticed: *for their deceit is falsehood*  <span
id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md) By these words the prophet teaches,
that the wicked gain nothing by their wiles, but that they are rather
entangled in them, or at length discover that they were mere sleight of
hand. Those ignorantly mar the sense who interpose the copula *and,* as
if it had been said, that *deceit and falsehood were in them* The word
<span id="xxviii.xv-p19.3"></span>רמוה, *remyah,* signifies *a subtle
and crafty device.* Interpreters, indeed, often translate it *thought;*
but this term does not sufficiently express the propriety and force of
the Hebrew word. The prophet means, that, however well pleased the
wicked are with their own cunning, they yet do nothing else than deceive
themselves with falsehood. And it was needful to add this clause; for we
see how the great bulk of mankind are fatally intoxicated with their own
vain imaginations, and how difficult it is to believe what is here
asserted, — that the more shrewd they are in their own estimation, the
more do they deceive themselves.

<span id="xxviii.xv-p20"></span><span id="xxviii.xv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p21"></span>**119.** *Thou hast made all the wicked
of the earth to cease as dross.* The meaning of this verse is similar to
that of the preceding. By the similitude employed, there is described a
sudden and an unexpected change, when their imaginative glory and
happiness become dissipated in smoke. It is to be observed, that the
vengeance of God against the wicked is not all at once manifested, so
that they completely perish, or are exterminated from the earth; but as
God, in rooting them out one after another, shows himself to be the
judge of the world, and that he is purging the earth of them, it is not
wonderful to find the prophet speaking of their destruction in this
manner; for the Hebrew verbs often denote a continued act. As God, then,
executes his judgments by little and little, and often suspends
punishment until he see that the wicked abuse his long-suffering; it
becomes us, on our part, to continue patiently waiting until, as a
heathen writer observes, he compensate the delay of the punishment, by
its severity when inflicted. It is abundantly evident, that the particle
of similitude, *as,* is to be supplied before the word *dross*  <span
id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) Nor do I reject the opinion of those
who assert, that the wicked are compared to dross, because, so long as
they are mingled among the faithful as dregs, they infect and
contaminate them; but when they are removed as scum, the purity of the
godly shines forth with improved lustre. In the second place, the
prophet adds, that the judgments of God were not without fruit in him,
since they led him to love the doctrine of the law the more. Those who
are not induced to commit themselves to the protection of God, whenever,
by lifting up his hand, he shows that the world is governed by his
power, must certainly be very perverse; but when, of his own good
pleasure, he offers himself to us by his word, those who do not make
haste to embrace so great a boon are stupid indeed. On the other hand,
when he connives for a long time at the wickedness of men, devout
affection, which should ravish us with the love of God’s word,
languishes.

<span id="xxviii.xv-p23"></span><span id="xxviii.xv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p24"></span>**120.** *My flesh hath trembled for
fear of thee.*  <span id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) At first sight
the prophet seems to contradict himself. He had just now said, that, by
God’s severity, he was gently drawn to love his testimonies; now he
declares, that he was seized with terror. But although these two effects
differ widely from each other, yet, if we consider by what kind of
discipline God forms us to reverence his law, we will perceive that they
entirely harmonize. We require to be subdued by fear that we may desire
and seek after the favor of God. Since fear, then, is the beginning of
love, the prophet testifies, that he was awakened by a heart-felt fear
of God to look well to himself. Nor is the mortification of the flesh so
easy a matter, as that every one should consent to enter upon it,
without the constraint of violent means; and, therefore, it is not
wonderful if God struck his servant with terror, that, in this way, he
might bend his mind to a holy fear of him. It is an evidence of no
common wisdom to tremble before God when he executes his judgments, of
which the majority of mankind take no notice. We are then taught by
these words of the prophet, that we ought to consider attentively the
judgments of God, that they may not only gently instruct us, but that
they may also strike us with such terror as will lead us to true
repentance.

<span id="xxviii-p3"></span> It is, however, a mistake to suppose, that
no connection of thought is observed throughout this lengthened
composition, as has sometimes been asserted even by writers of note. “It
has been too commonly assumed,” says Jebb, that the 119th psalm is a
collection of unconnected thoughts. To this opinion, even that most
profound religious philosopher, Dr Barrow, inclines, (Sermon 48, on
<span id="xxviii-p3.1"></span>[Ps
119:60](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#060)<span id="xxviii-p3.1"></span>;.md)
and his eloquent words must, in this instance, be received with no small
caution. ‘this psalm,’ he says, ‘no less excellent in virtue than large
in bulk, containeth manifold reflections on the nature, the properties,
the adjuncts, and effects of God’s law; many sprightly ejaculations
about it, conceived in different forms of speech; some in way of
petition, some of thanksgiving, some of resolution, some of assertion or
aphorism; many useful directions many zealous exhortations to the
observance of it; the which are not ranged in any strict order, but,
like a variety of wholesome herbs in a fair field, do, with a grateful
confusion, lie dispersed, as they freely did spring in the heart, or
were suggested by the devout spirit of him who indicted this psalm;
where no coherence of sentences being designed, we may consider any one
of them absolutely or singly by itself.’ The fine imagination of this
eminent writer justly recognizes the beautiful variety, the variegations
of thought, the <span id="xxviii-p3.2"></span>πολυποίκιλος σοφία
exhibited in this psalm; but too much seems to be conceded to the
prevalent opinion of a want of connection. I willingly allow, that the
sentiments are not limited and enthralled by any exact or Procrustean
rule; that there are no measures of intellectual geometry adhered to,
reducing this divine poem to a rigid didactic system: that the mind of
the prophet is free, and flowing, and discursive. Still this very flow
of thought implies connection and association, and forbids the frigid
idea that the psalm is a mere canto of reflections, like Lord Bacon’s
collection of aphorisms, or the maxims of Isocrates. I do not intend to
maintain what could not be proved, that a consecutive order can be
traced throughout; but instances can, undoubtedly, be drawn of passages
which maintan a beautiful sequence and connection between their several
members.” — *Jebb*’*s Literal Translation of the Book of Psalms*, *with
Dissertations*, volume 2, pages 274-276.

literally *unto very much*. So the LXX. render it, <span

the Chaldee, ‘unto all at once,’ but the Syriac, *for ever*, both

*abundance*.”

<span id="fn_398"></span>[399](cc11027.htm#fr_398.md) <span
id="xxviii.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p8"></span> Some consider this psalm, as well as all
the other alphabetic psalms, to be much more modern compositions than
the time of David, and refer it to the time of the captivity in Babylon.
But many others, as Venema, Michaelis, etc., ascribe it to David, and
suppose it to have been written before his elevation to the throne. Its
contents, certainly, favor this latter opinion, seeming to accord so
well with the long and harassing persecution to which he was subjected
by the malice and revenge of Saul. If David was its author, it is the
most artificial and operose in its composition of all his psalms, and he
has exhibited in the treatment of his subject — which is the celebration
of the perfection of God’s law, and the happiness of those who obey it —
an extraordinary fecundity of expression, as if one of his intentions
had been to show in how many various shapes, and with what copiousness
of words, he could enunciate and illustrate a few and the same topics.
The aspirations for instruction, consolation, and protection, with which
almost every portion of this psalm is mingled, have a soothing and
delightful effect, whilst the language throughout is rendered impressive
by its peculiar strength and concinnity. It may, however, be doubtful,
whether it be just to elevate it, as has been done by some, above all
the other psalms. Dr Adam Clarke justly remarks, “Like all other
portions of divine revelation, it is elegant, important, and useful; and
while I admire the fecundity of the Psalmist’s genius, the unabating
flow of his poetic vein, his numerous synonymes, and his <span
id="xxviii.i-p8.1"></span>*copia* *verborum*, by which he is enabled to
expound, diversify, and illustrate the same idea: presenting it to his
reader in all possible points of view, so as to render it pleasing,
instructive, and impressive; I cannot rob the rest of the book of its
just praise by setting this, as many have done, above all the pieces it
contains. It is by far the longest, the most artificial, and most
diversified, yet, in proportion to its length, it contains the fewest
ideas of any in the book.”

<span id="fn_399"></span>[400](cc11027.htm#fr_399.md) <span
id="xxviii.i-p9.8"></span>

<span id="xxviii.i-p10"></span> Others deny that these and other similar
terms, which frequently occur in this psalm, are mere synonymes; and
they have endeavoured to show from etymological investigation, that,
although all of them designate the law, yet they present it under a
different aspect. Jebb has attempted, at some length, to point out the
specific differences between these words. The following is an abstract
of his remarks: — “The next peculiarity to be observed in this psalm is,
the regular recurrence of nine characteristic words, at least one or
other of which is found in each distich, with one solitary exception,
the second distich of the 12th division. These words are *law*,
*testimonies*, *precepts*, *statutes*, *commandments*, *judgments*,
*word*, *saying*; and a word which only twice occurs as a
characteristic, — *way*.

<span id="xxviii.i-p11"></span>“These are, doubtless, all designations
of the Divine Law; but it were doing a deep injury to the cause of
revealed truth to affirm that they are mere synonyms; in other words,
that the sentiments of this compendium of heavenly wisdom are little
better than a string of tautologies. The fact is, as some critics, both
Jewish and Christian, have observed, that each of these terms designates
the same law of God, but each under a different aspect, signifying the
different modes of its promulgation, and of its reception. Each of these
words will now be examined in order, and an attempt will be made to
discriminate them.

<span id="xxviii.i-p12"></span> “1. *Law*. This word is formed from a
verb which means to direct, to guide, to aim, to shoot forwards. Its
etymological meaning, then, would be a rule of conduct, a <span
id="xxviii.i-p12.1"></span>κανών σαφὴς. It means God’s law in general,
whether it be that universal rule called the law of nature, or that
which was revealed to his Church by Moses, and perfected by Christ. In
strictness, the law means a plain rule of conduct, rather placed clearly
in man’s sight, than enforced by any command; that is to say, this word
does not necessarily include its sanctions.

<span id="xxviii.i-p13"></span> “2. *Testimonies* are derived from a
word which signifies to bear witness, to testify. The ark of the
tabernacle is so called, as are the two tables of stone, and the
tabernacle: the earnests and witnesses of God’s inhabitation among his
people. Testimonies are more particularly God’s revealed law: the
witnesses and confirmation of his promises made to his people, and
earnests of his future salvation.

<span id="xxviii.i-p14"></span> “3. *Precepts*, from a word which means
*to place in trust*, mean something intrusted to man, ‘that which is
committed to thee:’ appointments of God, which consequently have to do
with the conscience, for which man is responsible, as an intelligent
being.

<span id="xxviii.i-p15"></span> “4. *Statutes*. The verb from which this
word is formed means to engrave or inscribe. The word means a definite
prescribed written law. The term is applied to Joseph’s law about the
portion of the priests in Egypt, to the law about the Passover, etc. But
in this psalm it has a more internal meaning; — that moral law of God,
which is engraved on the fleshy tables of the heart; the inmost and
spiritual apprehension of his will: not so obvious as the law and
testimonies, and a matter of more direct spiritual communication than
his precepts: the latter being more elaborated by the efforts of the
mind itself, divinely guided indeed, but perhaps more instrumentally,
and less passively, employed.

<span id="xxviii.i-p16"></span> “5. *Commandments*, derived from a verb
signifying to command or ordain. Such was God’s command to Adam about
the tree; to Noah about constructing the ark.

<span id="xxviii.i-p17"></span> “6. *Judgments*, derived from a word
signifying to govern, to judge or determine, mean judicial ordinances
and decisions: legal sanctions.

<span id="xxviii.i-p18"></span> “7. *Word*. There are two terms, quite
distinct in the Hebrew, but both rendered *word*, in each of our
authorized versions. The latter of these is rendered *saying* in the
former volume of this work. They are closely connected; since out of
twenty-two passages in which *word* occurs, in fourteen it is parallel
to, or in connection with, *saying*. From this very circumstance it is
evident they are not synonymous.

<span id="xxviii.i-p19"></span> “The term here rendered *word* means the
<span id="xxviii.i-p19.1"></span>Λόγος, or Word of God, in its most
divine sense; the announcement of God’s revealed will; his command; his
oracle; at times, the special communication to the prophets. The ten
commandments are called by this term in Exodus: and <span
id="xxviii.i-p19.2"></span>דביר is the oracle in the temple. In this
psalm it may be considered as, — 1. God’s revealed commandments in
general. 2. As a revealed promise of certain blessings to the righteous.
3. As a thing committed to him as the minister of God. 4. As a rule of
conduct; a channel of illumination.

<span id="xxviii.i-p20"></span> “8. As to the remaining word *way*, that
occurs but twice as a characteristic word, and the places in which it
occurs must rather be considered as exceptions to the general rule: so
that I am not disposed to consider it as intended to be a cognate
expression with the above. At all events, its meaning is so direct and
simple as to require no explanation: a plain rule of conduct; in its
higher sense, the assisting grace of God through Christ our Lord, who is
the Way, the Truth, and the Life.” — *Jebb*’*s Literal Translation of
the book of Psalms*, *with Dissertations*, volume 2, pages 279-293.

objectionable, as it does not correspond with the prayer in the
succeeding sentence, *Raise me up according to thy word*. “The Vulgar
translation of this clause,” says he, “‘my soul melteth,’ or, as other
interpreters think, ‘my soul is dissolved into tears,’ appears to be
inadmissible, chiefly on account of the next clause. Dathe, following
Driessenius, Knapp, and Seiler, explains it, as is here done, by ‘is
bowed down,’ a sense which the word <span id="xxviii.iv-p4.2"></span>דלף
has in the Arabic use of it, and which certainly agrees with the
connection much better than that of weeping or dissolving.”

<span id="xxviii.vii-p14"></span> The Hebrew word here used for *terror*
is <span id="xxviii.vii-p14.1"></span>זלעפה, *zalaphah*, and is supposed
to refer to the blasting or scorching wind, called the Simoom, well
known to the Eastern nations. Accordingly, Michaelis reads, “A deadly
East wind seizes me.” Cocceius reads, “Horror, as a tempest, has seized
upon me.” “The sacred writer,” says he, “represents the vehement
commotion of his mind as resembling a violent commotion in the air.”

*other*: therefore the cloth must be turned on each side every time the
needle is set in, to see that the stitch be fairly set. Thus narrowly

<span id="xxviii.xi-p10"></span> Bottles, among the Jews and other
nations of the East, were made of goats’ or kids’ skins, as is the
custom among the Eastern nations at this day. When the animal was
killed, they cut off its feet and head, and drew it, in that manner, out
of the skin without opening the belly. They afterwards sewed up the
places where the legs were cut off, and the tail, and when it was
filled, they tied it about the neck. In these bottles, not only water,
milk, and other liquids were put, but every thing intended to be carried
to a distance, whether dry or liquid. To these goat-skin vessels a
reference is here undoubtedly made. The peasantry of Asia are in the
habit of suspending them from the roof, or hanging them against the
walls of their tents or humble dwellings: here they soon become quite
black with smoke; for, as in their dwellings there are seldom any
chimneys, and the smoke can only escape through an aperture in the roof,
or by the door, whenever a fire is lighted the apartment is instantly
filled with dense smoke. Accordingly, some suppose that the allusion
here chiefly is to the blackness which a bottle contracts by hanging in
the smoke; and the translators of our English Bible, by referring in the
margin to <span id="xxviii.xi-p10.1"></span>[Job
30:30](../../../bib/kjv/job030.htm#030.md)<span
id="xxviii.xi-p10.1"></span>, as parallel to this, seem to have supposed
that the Psalmist refers to the *blackness* his face contracted by
sorrow. “But,” says Harmer, “this can hardly be supposed to be the whole
of his thought. In such a case, would he not rather have spoken of the
*blackness of a pot*, as it is supposed the prophet Joel does, (<span
id="xxviii.xi-p10.2"></span>[Joe
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/joe002.htm#006.md)<span
id="xxviii.xi-p10.2"></span>,) rather than to that of a *leather
bottle*?” — *Harmer*’*s Observations*, volume 1, page 218. When such
bottles are suspended in the smoky tent of an Arab, if they do not
contain liquids, or are not quite filled by the solids which they hold,
they become dry, shrunk, and shriveled; and to this, as well as to their
blackness, the Psalmist may allude. Long-continued bodily affliction and
mental trouble produce a similar change on the human frame, destroying
its beauty and strength by drying up the natural moisture. It has also
been thought that there is a contrast between such mean bottles and the
rich vessels of gold and silver which were used in the palaces of kings.
“My appearance in the state of my exile is as different from what it was
when I dwelt at court, as are the gold and silver vessels of a palace
from the smoky skin bottles of a poor Arab’s tent, where I am now
compelled to reside.” — *Ibid*. and *Paxton*’*s Illustrations*, volume
2, pages 409, 410.

*The proud*, *who have not acted according to thy Law*, *have dug pits

<span id="xxviii.xii-p6"></span> This is the explanation given by
Walford. His translation is —

<span id="xxviii.xii-p7"></span>“O Jehovah! for ever  
Is thy word established in the heavens.”

<span id="xxviii.xii-p8"></span>Upon which he observes: “The design of
these words is by no means obvious, and the interpreters vary greatly in
their explications. I have not met with any explanation that is
altogether satisfactory, and shall therefore give what appears to me to
be the true meaning. The design, in general, of the Psalmist is, to
celebrate the immutability of the word of God: whatever He speaks is
sure. To illustrate this position, he refers to the creation of the
heavens and of the earth; they were alike formed by the word of God, —
‘He spake, and it was done.’ By virtue of that word these vast
productions abide through all ages, so that the word of God is
established and displayed in heaven and upon earth. As the same word
uttered all the precepts and institutions of the law, and all the
promises of the covenant of mercy, the unchangeableness of these
precepts and promises is verified and manifested by the perpetual
conservation of all these instances of physical power and energy.”

to have for its root a verb signifying *to complete*, *to finish*: the
meaning is, ‘to every created thing, however perfect, I see a boundary;’
that is, it is limited as to its capability, as well as to its
duration.” — *Cresswell*.

id="xxviii.xiv-p17.2"></span>, “*He put his life in his hand*, and slew
the Philistines;” and <span id="xxviii.xiv-p17.3"></span>[1Sa
28:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1028.htm#021.md)<span
id="xxviii.xiv-p17.3"></span>, “And the woman came unto Saul, and said,
*I have put my life in my hand*.” Phillips thus explains the figure: “We
are accustomed to say, that an affair is in a person’s hands when the
management and issue of it rest entirely with him, and so we speak when
that affair is the life or death of an individual. Hence, similarly,
when the Hebrews spoke of a person’s life being in his own hands, they
might mean, that the preservation of his life was entirely with him,
that he was destitute of all external assistance, and that consequently
his life was in danger. This is particularly the case with military men,
who, as they fight bravely, or otherwise, may preserve or lose their
lives: so Jephthah, as appears from the passages above cited.” The
figure may, however, be taken from the circumstance, that what a man
carries openly in his hand is in danger of taking, or of being snatched
away by violence. “The LXX. have changed the person of the pronoun,
<span id="xxviii.xiv-p17.4"></span>ἐν ταῖς χερσι σου; *in thy hands*; as
also the Syriac. It is probable that these ancient interpreters did not
understand the phrase, and so expressed it according to what they
thought might be the original reading, thus affording a very obvious
sense. Augustine says, that many MSS. in his time had the second person.
However, no such MSS. are known now, and there is no doubt whatever of
the correctness of the present text. The Psalmist states that, though
his life was in danger, yet he did not forget God’s law.” — *Ibid*

<span id="fn_434"></span>[435](cc11027.htm#fr_434.md) <span
id="xxviii.xiv-p25.3"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xiv-p26"></span> Thus, in the Arabic, it is, “on
account of an eternal reward;” that is, the reward of grace promised to
all the faithful. According to this view, the Psalmist would have a
respect to the end and reward of faith and holy obedience. See <span
id="xxviii.xiv-p26.1"></span>[Heb
11:26](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#026.md)<span
id="xxviii.xiv-p26.1"></span>; <span id="xxviii.xiv-p26.2"></span>[1
Pet. 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#009.md)<span id="xxviii.xiv-p26.2"></span>.
As, however, the Psalmist, like all true believers, did not embrace and
obey the law of God, only or chiefly from the hope of reward, but was
chiefly attracted to obedience by love to God, and the intrinsic
excellence of the law, others prefer reading “the reward *is* eternal.”

<span id="fn_435"></span>[436](cc11027.htm#fr_435.md) <span
id="xxviii.xv-p5.2"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p6"></span> In the Chaldee, it is “vain thinkers;”
and thus the meaning would be, “I hate men that think evil, that devise
wicked devices, or that have false and evil opinions, opposite to God’s
law, or tending to seduce men from it.”

<span id="fn_436"></span>[437](cc11027.htm#fr_436.md) <span
id="xxviii.xv-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p7"></span> It signifies *thoughts* in <span
id="xxviii.xv-p7.1"></span>[Job
4:14](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#014.md)<span id="xxviii.xv-p7.1"></span>,
and <span id="xxviii.xv-p7.2"></span>[Job
20:2](../../../bib/kjv/job020.htm#002.md)<span id="xxviii.xv-p7.2"></span>;
and *opinions* in <span id="xxviii.xv-p7.3"></span>[1Ki
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021.md)<span
id="xxviii.xv-p7.3"></span>: and these may be either good or evil, their
character being determined by the context of the passage in which the
word occurs.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[438](cc11027.htm#fr_437.md) <span
id="xxviii.xv-p7.5"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p8"></span> The sense of the text also requires that
the word for *thoughts* should here be taken in a bad sense, for the
Psalmist affirms that he hates them, and sets God’s law in opposition to
them. Various epithets have been supplied to describe the character of
these thoughts, such as “crooked,” by Calvin, “vain,” by our English
version, and “high minded,” by Luther. Ainsworth supplies *wavering*,
observing, that the original term denotes the top branches of trees,
which are figuratively applied to the thoughts or opinions of the mind,
to denote that they are wavering and uncertain, as <span
id="xxviii.xv-p8.1"></span>[1Ki
18:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1018.htm#021.md)<span
id="xxviii.xv-p8.1"></span>; or to persons distracted with their own
cogitations. Poole remarks, agreeably to Calvin’s interpretation, that
the thoughts, or opinions, or devices of men differing from, or opposite
to God’s law, may be intended, since, in the next clause, God’s law is
opposed to them, and as some, both Jewish and Christian, expositors
understand the Hebrew word.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[439](cc11027.htm#fr_438.md) <span
id="xxviii.xv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p19"></span> Dimock thinks that, by this expression,
the Psalmist; probably alludes to the <span
id="xxviii.xv-p19.1"></span>*Lex Talionis* amongst the Jews, and that
the Apostle might refer to this passage in <span
id="xxviii.xv-p19.2"></span>[2Th
2:11](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#011.md)<span
id="xxviii.xv-p19.2"></span>; where he says, “that God should send them
strong *delusion*, that they should believe a *lie*.”

<span id="fn_439"></span>[440](cc11027.htm#fr_439.md) <span
id="xxviii.xv-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p22"></span> “Before the noun <span
id="xxviii.xv-p22.1"></span>סגים, rendered *dross*, the particle <span
id="xxviii.xv-p22.2"></span>כ, of similitude, is understood, so that the
Psalmist says, ‘Thou hast entirely removed (made to cease) all the
wicked of the earth as dross,’ which is removed from metals by fusion,
or from corn by winnowing. The society of men is as a mass of metal in
which the wicked are as rust and dross. The judgments of God, which are
searching, will cause a separation of the dross from the metal, and thus
He will destroy the one and preserve the other.” — *Phillips*

<span id="fn_440"></span>[441](cc11027.htm#fr_440.md) <span
id="xxviii.xv-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xxviii.xv-p25"></span> The verb <span
id="xxviii.xv-p25.1"></span>סמר, *samar*, rendered hath trembled,
denotes being seized with horror, so that the hair stands on end. It
occurs in Piel in <span id="xxviii.xv-p25.2"></span>[Job
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#015.md)<span
id="xxviii.xv-p25.2"></span>. This state of horror was produced on the
mind of the Psalmist by a contemplation of the divine judgments executed
on the wicked, who are rejected like dross; and he was thus brought to
fear God.
