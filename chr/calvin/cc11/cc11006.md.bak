<span id="vii-p1"></span>PSALM 98

<span id="vii-p2"></span>This psalm has a great resemblance to the
ninety-sixth, not only in matter, but language. The great scope of it is
to show that the glory of God would be illustriously displayed in the
spread of the knowledge of his name throughout the world, both from the
more ample fulfillment which would be given upon the manifestation of
the Savior, to the promises made to the posterity of Abraham, and from
the sudden extension of salvation to all parts of the earth. He calls
upon men to magnify the name of God on this account.

<span id="vii.i"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p1"></span><span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
98:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Sing unto Jehovah a new song, for he
hath done marvelous things: his own right hand, and the arm of his
holiness, hath gotten him the victory.  <span
id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) **2.** Jehovah hath made known his
salvation: his righteousness he hath revealed in the sight of the
heathen. **3.** He hath remembered his goodness and truth towards the
house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of
our God.  <span id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md)

<span id="vii.i-p5"></span> 

<span id="vii.i-p6"></span><span id="vii.i-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p7"></span>**1** *Sing unto Jehovah a new song* I have
already remarked, that the expression here used denotes an
extraordinary, not a common, ascription of praise. This appears from the
reason assigned for it, That God had manifested his salvation in a
singular and incredible manner. For having spoken of *marvelous things,*
he represents this as the sum of all, that God had procured salvation
*with his own right hand;*  <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) that
is, not by human means, or in an ordinary way, but delivering his Church
in an unprecedented manner. Isaiah enlarges upon this miracle of God’s
power:

<span id="vii.i-p9"></span>“The Lord looked if there were any to help,
and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm
brought salvation, and his righteousness sustained him,”  
(<span id="vii.i-p9.2"></span>[Isa
59:16](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#016)<span id="vii.i-p9.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.i-p10"></span>In both passages *the arm of God* stands
opposed to ordinary means, which although when employed they derogate
nothing from the glory of God, yet prevent us from so fully discovering
his presence as we might otherwise do. The language of the Psalmist
amounts to a declaration that God would not save the world by means of
an ordinary kind, but would come forth himself and show that he was the
author of a salvation in every respect so singular. He reasonably infers
that mercy of such a wonderful, and, to us, incomprehensible kind,
should be celebrated by no ordinary measures of praise. This is brought
out still more clearly in the verse which follows, where it is said that
*his* *salvation and righteousness are shown to the nations* What could
have been less looked for than that light should have arisen upon these
dark and benighted places, and that righteousness should have appeared
in the habitations of desperate wickedness? Salvation is mentioned
first, although it is, properly speaking, the effect of righteousness.
Such an inversion of the natural order is often observed in stating
divine benefits; nor is it surprising that what is the means, and should
be mentioned first, is sometimes set last, and follows by way of
explanation. I may add, that the righteousness of God, which is the
source of salvation, does not consist in his recompensing men according
to their works, but is just the illustration of his mercy, grace, and
faithfulness.

<span id="vii.i-p11"></span><span id="vii.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p12"></span>**3** *He hath remembered his goodness*
Having spoken of the general manifestation of his salvation, he now
celebrates his goodness more particularly to his own chosen people. God
exhibited himself as a Father to Gentiles as well as Jews; but to the
Jews first, who were, so to speak, the first-born.  <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) The glory of the Gentiles lay in their
being adopted and in-grafted into the holy family of Abraham, and the
salvation of the whole world sprung from the promise made to Abraham, as
Christ said, “Salvation is of the Jews,” (<span
id="vii.i-p13.2"></span>[Joh 4:22](../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#022.md)<span
id="vii.i-p13.2"></span>) The Psalmist therefore very properly observes,
that God in redeeming the world *remembered his truth,* which he had
given to Israel his people — language, too, which implies that he was
influenced by no other motive than that of faithfully performing what he
had himself promised.  <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) The more
clearly to show that the promise was not grounded at all on the merit or
righteousness of man, he mentions the *goodness* of God first, and
afterwards his *faithfulness,* which stood connected with it. The cause,
in short, was not to be found out of God himself, (to use a common
expression,) but in his mere good pleasure, which had been testified
long before to Abraham and his posterity. The word *remembered* is used
in accommodation to man’s apprehension; for what has been long suspended
seems to have been forgotten. Upwards of two thousand years elapsed from
the time of giving the promise to the appearance of Christ, and as the
people of God were subjected to many afflictions and calamities, we need
not wonder that they should have sighed, and given way to ominous fears
regarding the fulfillment of this redemption. When it is added, *all the
ends of the earth have seen the salvation of God,* this is not merely
commendatory of the greatness of the salvation, meaning that it should
be so illustrious that the report of it would reach the ends of the
earth; but it signifies that the nations formerly immersed in delusions
and superstitions would participate in it.

<span id="vii.ii"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p1"></span><span id="vii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Psalm
98:4-9](../../../bib/kjv/psa098.htm#004.md)<span id="vii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p2"></span>**4.** Exult before Jehovah all the earth;
make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise. **5.** Sing to Jehovah
upon the harp, upon the harp, and with the voice of a psalm.  <span
id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) **6.** With trumpets, and sound of the
cornet, sing before Jehovah the King. **7.** Let the sea roar, and the
fullness thereof; the world, and those who dwell therein.  <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) **8.** Let the floods clap their
hands:  <span id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) let the hills be joyful
together, **9.** Before Jehovah: for he cometh to judge the earth; with
righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with uprightness.

<span id="vii.ii-p8"></span> 

<span id="vii.ii-p9"></span><span id="vii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p10"></span>**4** *Exult before Jehovah all the earth*
Here he repeats the exhortation with which he had begun, and by
addressing it to the nations at large, he indicates that when God should
break down the middle wall of partition all would be gathered to the
common faith, and one Church formed throughout the whole world. When he
speaks of musical instruments the allusion is evidently to the practice
of the Church at that time, without any intention of binding down the
Gentiles to the observance of the ceremonies of the law. The repetition
made use of is emphatical, and implies that the most ardent attempts men
might make to celebrate the great work of the world’s redemption would
fall short of the riches of the grace of God. This is brought out still
more forcibly in what follows, where feeling is ascribed to things
inanimate. The whole passage has been elsewhere expounded, and it is
unnecessary to insist further upon it.

<span id="vii.i-p3"></span> The last clause is “literally, *have wrought
deliverance for him*, *i* *e*., not deliverance of him, as if God had
been himself in danger or distress; but that is done *for* any one,
which is done agreeably to his wishes and intentions, and at his
instigation. The original, therefore, expresses, that the deliverance
wrought was originally designed and decreed by God, and that his
immediate power effected the thing intended without any other aid.” —
*Horsley* Street translates, “hath wrought salvation for us.” He thinks
that instead of <span id="vii.i-p3.1"></span>לו, *for him*, we should
read <span id="vii.i-p3.2"></span>לנו, *for us*

<span id="fn_106"></span>[107](cc11006.htm#fr_106.md) <span
id="vii.i-p3.3"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p4"></span> The last part of this verse is in the same
words with <span id="vii.i-p4.1"></span>[Isa
52:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#010.md)<span id="vii.i-p4.1"></span>.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[108](cc11006.htm#fr_107.md) <span
id="vii.i-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p8"></span> “<span id="vii.i-p8.1"></span>Car apres
avoir parle des miracles, il les restreint specialement a une somme,
ascavoir, que Dieu *s*’*est acquis salut par sa propre vertu*.” — *Fr*.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[109](cc11006.htm#fr_108.md) <span
id="vii.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p13"></span> “<span id="vii.i-p13.1"></span>Afin qu’ils
fussent comme les aisnez.” — *Fr*.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[110](cc11006.htm#fr_109.md) <span
id="vii.i-p13.3"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p14"></span> “<span id="vii.i-p14.1"></span>Qu’il n’a
point este induit par autre raison, sinon afin que fidelement il
accomplist ce qu’il avoit promis.” — *Fr*.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[111](cc11006.htm#fr_110.md) <span
id="vii.ii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p3"></span> Horsley reads —

<span id="vii.ii-p4"></span>“Chant unto Jehovah to the harp,  
To the harp, and the sound of the zimrah.”

<span id="vii.ii-p5"></span>“<span id="vii.ii-p5.1"></span>זמרה here,”
he remarks, “as in <span id="vii.ii-p5.2"></span>[Ps
81:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa081.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.ii-p5.2"></span>, is
certainly the name of some musical instrument. But what the particular
instrument might be, which went by that name, is quite uncertain. I
therefore retain the Hebrew word.”

<span id="fn_111"></span>[112](cc11006.htm#fr_111.md) <span
id="vii.ii-p5.3"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p6"></span> Street is of opinion that the nominative
cases of the concluding part of this verse do not belong to the verb of
the preceding clause, but to the verb in the subsequent verse. “Roar let
the globe,” says he, “‘and those that inhabit it,’ is not so proper an
expression as ‘Let the globe and those that inhabit it clap the hand.’”

<span id="fn_112"></span>[113](cc11006.htm#fr_112.md) <span
id="vii.ii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p7"></span> “Let the floods *clap their hands*,” is a
most beautiful prosopopoeia, a figure for which the Hebrew poets are
remarkable, and which they manage with equal elegance and boldness.
Horsley renders, “Let the floods sound applause;” observing, that it is
literally “clap their hands.” “The verb <span
id="vii.ii-p7.1"></span>רנן,” he adds, “expresses the vibratory motion,
either of a dancer’s feet, or of a singer’s lip. Therefore, when applied
figuratively to an inanimate thing that can neither dance nor sing, it
is better to render its general sense than to confine it to either
particular image. Our language has no word, which, like the Hebrew, may
express dancing or singing indiscriminately.” The propriety of deviating
from the literal rendering may, however, be questioned. This ode is
highly animated; it is a burst of joy in God raised to the highest
pitch; and it is the property of this emotion, when felt in a high
degree, to express itself in the most daring and unusual figures. It may
be added, that the whole of the seventh and eighth verses furnish a
beautiful specimen of personification. With a sublimity of sentiment and
an energy of language which cannot be surpassed, all nature, animate and
inanimate, is summoned to unite in the song of joy, and to contend with
eager rivalry in celebrating the praises of its Creator.
