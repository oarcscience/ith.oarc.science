<span id="xii.i-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Ninth

<span id="xii.i-p2"></span>CHAPTER 29

<span id="xii.ii"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p1"></span><span id="xii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#001.md)<span id="xii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p2"></span>**1.** Now these *are* the words of the
letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of
the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to
the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away
captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;

<span id="xii.ii-p3"></span>**1.** Hi sunt sermones libri *(vel,*
epistolae) quem misit Jeremias propheta Jerusalem ad reliquias seniorum
captivitatis, et ad sacerdotes et ad prophetas, et ad universum populum,
quem captivum abduxerat Nebuchadnezer e Jerusalem in Babylonem;

<span id="xii.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.ii-p5"></span><span id="xii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p6"></span>Here the Prophet begins a new discourse,
even that he not only cried out constantly at Jerusalem, that the Jews
who still remained there should repent, but that he also mitigated the
grief of the exiles, and exhorted them to entertain the hope of
returning, provided they patiently endured the chastisement allotted to
them. The design of the Prophet was at the same time twofold; for he not
only intended to mitigate by comfort the sorrow of the exiles, but
designed also to break down the obstinacy of his own nation, so that
they who still remained at Jerusalem and in Judea might know that
nothing would be better for them than to join themselves to their other
brethren. The Jews, as it has already appeared, and as we shall
hereafter in many places see, had set their minds on an unreasonable
deliverance; God had fixed on seventy years, but they wished immediately
to break through and extricate themselves from the yoke laid on them.
Hence Jeremiah, in writing to the captives and exiles, intended to
accommodate what he said to the Jews who still remained at Jerusalem,
and who thought their case very fortunate, because they were not driven
away with their king and the rest of the multitude. But at the same time
his object was to benefit also the miserable exiles, who might have been
overwhelmed with despair, had not their grief been in some measure
mitigated. The Prophet, as we shall see, bids them to look forward to
the end of their captivity, and in the meantime exhorts them to
patience, and desires them to be quiet and peaceable, and not to raise
tumults, until the hand of God was put forth for their deliverance.

<span id="xii.ii-p7"></span>he says that he *wrote a book*  <span
id="fr_200"></span>[201](#fn_200.md) to the remaining *elders;*  <span
id="fr_201"></span>[202](#fn_201.md) for many of that age had died; as
nature requires, the old who approach near the goal of life, die first,
he then says that he *wrote* to them who still remained alive. We hence
conclude that his prophecy was designed for them all; and yet he
afterwards says, “Take wives and propagate;” but this, as we shall see,
is to be confined to those who were at that time in a fit age for
marriage. He did not however wish to exclude the aged from the comfort
of which God designed them to be partakers, and that by knowing that
there would be a happy end to their captivity, provided they retained
resignation of mind and patiently bore the punishment of God justly due
to them for having so often and in such various ways provoked him. Then
he adds, *the priests,* and the *prophets,* and then the *whole* people.
 <span id="fr_202"></span>[203](#fn_202.md)

<span id="xii.ii-p11"></span>But we must notice that he not only exhorts
the people to patience, but also the priests and the prophets. And
though, as we shall hereafter see, there were among them impostors, who
falsely boasted that they were prophets,  <span
id="fr_203"></span>[204](#fn_203.md) it is yet probable that they are also
included here who were endued with God’s Spirit, either because the
spirit was languid in them, or because God did not always grant to them
the knowledge of everything. It might then be that the prophets, to whom
God had not made known this, or whose minds were oppressed with evils,
were to be taught.

<span id="xii.ii-p13"></span>As to the priests, we hence conclude that
they had from the beginning neglected their office, for they would have
been God’s prophets, had they faithfully performed their sacerdotal
office; and it was, as it were, an extraordinary thing when God chose
other prophets, and not without reproach to the priests; for they must
have become degenerated and idle or deceptive, when they gloried in the
name alone, when they were destitute of the truth. This then was the
reason why they were to be taught in common with the people. It now
follows, —

<span id="xii.iii"></span>

<span id="xii.iii-p1"></span><span id="xii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002.md)<span id="xii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iii-p2"></span>**2.** (After that Jeconiah the king, and
the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the
carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)

<span id="xii.iii-p3"></span>**2.** Postquam egressus fuerat Jechaniah
rex et domina (*id est,* regina*, mater ejus,*) et proceres, principes
Jehudah et Jerusalem, et artifex et sculptor ex Jerusalem;

<span id="xii.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.iii-p5"></span><span id="xii.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iii-p6"></span>He mentions the time when the book was
sent, even after the calamity which had happened, when King Jeconiah and
his mother were driven into exile, and Zedekiah, his successor, was made
governor in his place, as we shall presently see. It was then during
these beginnings of a change that Jeremiah wrote. All things were then
in such a ferment, that some feared more than what was necessary, and
others entertained vain hopes, as the case usually is in a disordered
state of things. It was then after this fresh calamity that Jeremiah
wrote, as his words most especially shew. He might indeed, as in other
instances, have mentioned the year; but as he plainly declares that this
happened after the departure of Jeconiah, his purpose is sufficiently
evident, even that he wished in due time to give some relief to their
sorrow, who might have succumbed under it, had not God in a manner
stretched forth his hand to them. For we know that fresh grief is
difficult to be borne; and hence it is that it is called a bitter grief;
for it was a grievous novelty, when they were violently and suddenly
dragged out of their quiet nests. It was then Jeremiah’s object at that
time to give them some comfort; he also saw that those who were left in
Judea were greatly disturbed and continually agitating new schemes; for
Zedekiah’s kingdom was not as yet established, and they despised him and
were ever looking for their own king. As, then, things were thus in
disorder at home, and as the miserable exiles especially, were at first
very grievously afflicted, Jeremiah set before them a seasonable remedy.
This then is the reason why he points out the time.

<span id="xii.iii-p7"></span>The mother of Jeconiah, we know, was led
away with him into captivity; and she is called, <span
id="xii.iii-p7.1"></span>הריבגה, *egebire;*  <span
id="fr_204"></span>[205](#fn_204.md) for though she was not properly the
queen, she yet ruled in connection with her son. Some render <span
id="xii.iii-p8.1"></span>םיסירס, *sarisim,* eunuchs;  <span
id="fr_205"></span>[206](#fn_205.md) but I prefer the word “chiefs;” and
hence is added the word <span id="xii.iii-p9.3"></span>ירש, *shari,*
princes, that is, the courtiers, who governed the people, not only in
Jerusalem, but through the whole of Judea. He also adds the *artificers*
and *sculptors,*  <span id="fr_206"></span>[207](#fn_206.md) for
Nebuchadnezzar had chosen the best of them; he had deprived the city of
its nobles, that there might be none of authority among the Jews to
venture on any new attempt; and then he had taken away those who were
useful and ingenious, so that he left them no sculptors nor artificers.
It now follows, —

<span id="xii.iv"></span>

<span id="xii.iv-p1"></span><span id="xii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:3-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#003.md)<span id="xii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iv-p2"></span>**3.** By the hand of Elasah the son of
Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah
sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,

<span id="xii.iv-p3"></span>**3.** Per manum Eleasah filii Saphan et
Gamariae filii Helchiae, quos miserat Zedechias rex Jehudah ad
Nebhadnezer regem Babylonis Babylonem, dicendo,

<span id="xii.iv-p4"></span>**4.** Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God
of Israel, unto all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused
to be carried away from Jerusalem unto Babylon;

<span id="xii.iv-p5"></span>**4.** Sic dicit Jehovah exercituum, Deus
Israel, universae captivitati quam captivam adduxi e Jerusalem
Babylonem,

<span id="xii.iv-p6"></span>**5.** Build ye houses, and dwell *in them;*
and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;

<span id="xii.iv-p7"></span>**5.** AEdificate domos, et inhabitate;
plantate hortos, et comedite fructus eorum;

<span id="xii.iv-p8"></span>**6.** Take ye wives, and beget sons and
daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to
husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be
increased there, and not diminished.

<span id="xii.iv-p9"></span>**6.** Accipite uxores et generate filios et
filias; et accipite filiis vestris uxores, et filias vestras date nuptum
viris, ut generent filios et filias; et crescite *(aut,* multiplicamini)
illic, et ne minuamini.

<span id="xii.iv-p10"></span> 

<span id="xii.iv-p11"></span><span id="xii.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iv-p12"></span>This is the substance of the message, which
the Prophet, no doubt, explained to them at large; but here he touches
but briefly on what he wrote to the captives, even that they were
patiently to endure their exile until the time of their deliverance,
which was not to be such as many imagined, but such as God had fixed.
Well known indeed at that time was Jeremiah’s prophecy, not only in
Judea, but also to the captives, that their exile could not be completed
in a shorter time than seventy years.

<span id="xii.iv-p13"></span>It is said that he sent his *letter* by the
hand of the king’s ambassadors. It is probable that this was done by the
permission of Zedekiah; for there is no doubt but that in sending his
ambassadors he intended to obtain favor with King Nebuchadnezzar, by
whose nod he had come to the throne; for he was not of such dignity as
to be made king, though of the royal seed, had not Nebuchadnezzar
thought that it would be more advantageous to himself. For had he
appointed any other governor over the Jews, a sedition might have been
easily raised; he therefore intended in a measure to pacify them, for he
knew that they were a very refractory people. However, Zedekiah ruled
only by permission, not through his own power, nor on account of his
wealth, but through the good pleasure of a conqueror. He then sent his
ambassadors to promise all kinds of homage, and to know what was to be
done in future. As, then, he did not wish the return of Jeconiah, he
permitted his ambassadors to carry the letter of Jeremiah, not indeed
that he wished to obey God. It was not, then, owing to any sincere
regard for religion, but because he thought that it would be
advantageous to him, that the Jews should remain in Chaldea till the
death of Jeconiah; for he thus hoped that his kingdom would be
confirmed, for Jeconiah was, as it were, his rival. Nor is there a
doubt, but that Nebuchadnezzar wished to hold Zedekiah bound by this
fetter; for he could any day restore Jeconiah, who was his captive, to
his former state.

<span id="xii.iv-p14"></span>Now, then, we understand why Zedekiah did
not prohibit Jeremiah’s letter to be carried to the captives: he thought
that it would serve to tranquilize his kingdom. But the holy Prophet had
another thing in view; for his anxious object was, not to gain the favor
of the king, but to shew, as God had commanded him, how long the
captivity would be. Zedekiah indeed might have wished that a permission
should be given to the exiles to return; for those who remained in Judea
were only the dregs and offscourings of society; it was not an honorable
state of things: and it may be that he had also this in view, in sending
ambassadors to Nebuchadnezzar, that Jerusalem might not remain desolate,
but that a portion at least of the exiles might return, and that there
might also be some to cultivate the land which had been nearly stripped
of its inhabitants. But Jeremiah declared what he knew was by no means
acceptable to the king, that a return was in vain expected before the
termination of seventy years. We hence see that he spoke nothing to gain
the favor of the king; and yet the king did not regard with displeasure,
that the letter was sent to allay all commotions, and to restrain all
the violence of those who would have been otherwise too prone to make
some new attempts. This accounts for the circumstance, that the letter
was sent by the hand of *Elasah* and *Gemariah*

<span id="xii.iv-p15"></span>He adds, at the same time, that they were
sent by *Zedekiah* to *Babylon,* that is, to gain the favor of King
Nebuchadnezzar, or, at least, to secure his friendship. I now come to
the message itself:

<span id="xii.iv-p16"></span><span id="xii.iv-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iv-p17"></span>God commanded the captives to *build
houses* in Chaldea, to *plant vineyards,* and also to *marry wives,* and
to *beget children,* as though they were at home. It was not, indeed,
God’s purpose that they should set their hearts on Chaldea, on the
contrary, they were ever to think of their return: but until the end of
the seventy years, it was God’s will that they should continue quiet,
and not attempt this or that, but carry on the business of life as
though they were in their own country. As to their hope, then, it was
God’s will that their minds should be in a state of suspense until the
time of deliverance.

<span id="xii.iv-p18"></span>At the first view these two things seemed
inconsistent, — that the Jews were to live seventy years as though they
were the natives of the place, and that their habitations were not to be
changed, — and yet that they were ever to look forward to a return. But
these two things can well agree together: it was a proof of obedience
when they acknowledged that they were chastised by God’s hand, and thus
became willingly submissive to the end of the seventy years. But their
hope, as I have just observed, was to remain in suspense, in order that
they might not be agitated with discontent, nor be led away by some
violent feeling, but that they might so pass their time as to bear their
exile in such a way as to please God; for there was a sure hope of
return, provided they looked forward, according to God’s will, to the
end of the seventy years. It is then this subject on which Jeremiah now
speaks, when he says, *Build houses, and dwell in them; plant vineyards,
and eat of their fruit* For this whole discourse is to be referred to
the time of exile, he having beforehand spoken of their return; and this
we shall see in its proper place.

<span id="xii.iv-p19"></span>But the Jews could not have hoped for
anything good, except they were so resigned as to bear their correction,
and thus really proved that they did not reject the punishment laid on
them.

<span id="xii.iv-p20"></span>We now see that Jeremiah did not encourage
the Jews to indulge in pleasures, nor persuade them to settle for ever
in Chaldea. It was, indeed, a fertile and pleasant land; but he did not
encourage them to live there in pleasure, to indulge themselves and to
forget their own country; by no means: but he confined what he said to
the time of the captivity, to the end of the seventy years. During that
time, then, he wished them to enjoy the land of Chaldea, and all its
advantages, as though they were not exiles but natives of the place. For
what purpose? not that they might give themselves up to sloth, but that
they might not, by raising commotions, offend God, and in a manner close
up against themselves the door of his grace, for the time which he had
fixed was to be expected. For when we are driven headlong by a vehement
desire, we in a manner repel the favor of God; we do not then suffer him
to act as it becomes him: and when we take away from him his own rights
and will, it is the same as though we were unwilling to receive his
grace. This would have been the case, had they not quietly and
resignedly endured their calamity in Chaldea to the end of the time
which had been fixed by God.

<span id="xii.iv-p21"></span>We now perceive that the Prophet’s message
referred only to the time of exile; and we also perceive what was the
design of it, even to render them obedient to God, that they might thus
shew by their patience that they were really penitent, and that they
also expected a return in no other way than through God’s favor alone.

<span id="xii.iv-p22"></span><span id="xii.iv-p22.1"></span>

<span id="xii.iv-p23"></span>In bidding them to *take wives* for their
sons, and to *give* their *daughters* in marriage, he speaks according
to the usual order of nature; for it would be altogether unreasonable
for young men and young women to seek partners for themselves, according
to their own humor and fancy. God then speaks here according to the
common order of things, when he bids young men not to be otherwise
joined in marriage than by the consent of parents, and that young women
are not to marry but those to whom they are given.

<span id="xii.iv-p24"></span>He then adds, *Be ye multiplied there and
not diminished;* as though he had said, that the time of exile would be
so long, that except they propagated, they would soon come to nothing:
and God expressed this, because it was not his will that Abraham’s seed
should fail. It was indeed a kind of death, when he had driven them so
far, as though he had deprived them of the inheritance which he had
promised to be perpetual: he, however, administers comfort here by
commanding them to propagate their kind: for they could not have been
encouraged to do so, except they had their eyes directed to the hope of
a return. He then afforded them some taste of his mercy when he bade
them not to be *diminished* in Chaldea. He then adds, —

<span id="xii.v"></span>

<span id="xii.v-p1"></span><span id="xii.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007.md)<span id="xii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.v-p2"></span>**7.** And seek the peace of the city whither
I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD
for it: for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.

<span id="xii.v-p3"></span>**7.** Et quaerite pacem urbis ad quam
transtuli vos illuc (*sed abundat*), et orate pro ea Jehovam, quia in
pace ejus erit vobis pax.

<span id="xii.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.v-p5"></span><span id="xii.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.v-p6"></span>Jeremiah goes still farther, even that the
Jews had been led to Babylon, on the condition of rendering willing
obedience to the authority of King Nebuchadnezzar, and of testifying
this by their prayers. He not only bids them patiently to endure the
punishment laid on them, but also to be faithful subjects of their
conqueror; he not only forbids them to be seditious, but he would have
them to obey from the heart, so that God might be a witness of their
willing subjection and obedience.

<span id="xii.v-p7"></span>He says, *Seek the peace of the city;* this
may be understood of prayers; for <span id="xii.v-p7.1"></span>שרד*,
daresh,* often means to pray: but it may suitably be taken here, as I
think, in reference to the conduct of the people, as though he had said,
that the Jews were to do what they could, to exert themselves to the
utmost, so that no harm might happen to the Chaldean monarchy; for they
are afterwards directed to *pray* It may indeed be, that the same thing
is repeated in other words; but if any one weighs the subject more
fully, he will, I think, assent to what I have stated, that in the first
clause the Prophet bids them to be faithful to King Nebuchadnezzar and
to his monarchy. *Seek,* then*, the peace of the city:*  <span
id="fr_207"></span>[208](#fn_207.md) by peace, as it is well known, is to
be understood prosperity.

<span id="xii.v-p9"></span>But he was not satisfied with external
efforts, but he would have them to *pray* to God, that all things might
turn out prosperously and happily to the Babylonian king, even to the
end of their exile; for we must bear in mind that the Prophet had ever
that time in view. We hence learn that he exhorted the exiles to bear
the yoke of the king of Babylon, during the time allotted to the
captivity, for to attempt anything rashly was to fight against God, and
that he thus far commanded them quietly to bear that tyrannical
government.

<span id="xii.v-p10"></span>He repeats again what he had said, (though I
had passed it by,) that they had been *carried away captives:* for he
had spoken of it, “all the captivity which,” he says, “I made to
migrate,” or removed, or led captive, “from Jerusalem.” Now, again, he
repeats the same thing, that he had *carried them away captives,* <span
id="xii.v-p10.1"></span>יתילגה ושא*, asher egeliti;*  <span
id="fr_208"></span>[209](#fn_208.md) and he said this, that they might not
regard only the avarice, or the ambition, or the pride of King
Nebuchadnezzar, but that they might raise up their eyes to heaven, and
acknowledge Nebuchadnezzar as the scourge of God, and their exile as a
chastisement for their sins. God thus testified that he was the author
of their exile, that the Jews might not think that they had to do with a
mortal man, but on the contrary, understand that they were kicking
against the goad, if they murmured and complained, because they lived
under the tyranny of a foreign king. That they might not then be
agitated with vain thoughts, God comes forth and says, that the exile
was imposed on them by his just judgment, in order that they might know
that they would gain nothing by their perverseness, and that they might
not be disturbed by an anxious disquietude, nor dare to attempt anything
new, for this would be to resist God, and as it were to carry on war
with heaven. I will finish here.

<span id="xii.vi"></span>

<span id="xii.vi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xii.vi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that we may be more and
more habituated to render obedience to thee, and that whenever thou
chastisest us with thy scourges, we may examine our own consciences, and
humbly and suppliantly deprecate thy wrath, and never doubt but thou
wilt be propitious to us, after having chastised us with thy paternal
hand; and may we thus recumb on thy fatherly kindness, that we may ever
look forward with quiet minds, until the end appears, which thou hast
promised to us, and that when the warfare of this present life shall be
finished, we may reach that blessed rest, which has been prepared for us
in heaven, through Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xii.vii"></span>

<span id="xii.vii-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Tenth

<span id="xii.vii-p2"></span>In the last Lecture we did not finish the
seventh verse, in which the Prophet says that the Jews, as long as God
would have them to be exiles, were to be so fixed in Babylon, that they
ought to have deemed their union such, as though they were of the same
body. For by saying that *their peace* would be in the *peace* of
Babylon, he intimates that they could not be considered as a separate
people until the time of seventy years was completed. He therefore
commanded them to *pray* for the prosperity of Babylon.

<span id="xii.vii-p3"></span>At the first view this may seem hard; for
we know how cruelly that miserable people had been treated by the
Chaldeans. Then to pray for the most savage enemies, might have appeared
unreasonable and by no means suitable. But the Prophet mitigates the
hardness of the work by saying, that it would be profitable to them to
pray for the happy condition of Babylon, inasmuch as they were the
associates of their fortune. We know how much the prospect of what is
profitable avails to persuade us, as we think not of undertaking
anything except what we deem will be successful. For this reason then
the Prophet teaches the Jews that they ought not to refuse what was
required from them, when God bade them to pray for Babylon, because the
prosperity of that kingdom would be for their benefit, he intimates
also, as I have already hinted, that they were so connected with

<span id="xii.vii-p4"></span>Babylon, that they could not expect to be
exempt from all trouble and annoyance, if any adversity happened to
Babylon, for they were of the same body. We now perceive the meaning of
the Prophet.

<span id="xii.vii-p5"></span>But we may hence deduce a very useful
doctrine, — that we ought not only to obey the kings under whose
authority we live, but that we ought also to pray for their prosperity,
so that God may be a witness of our voluntary subjection. For if it was
the duty of the Jews to pray for the wellbeing of the Chaldeans for this
reason, because they were for a certain time under their authority,
there is no excuse for us, when we live under any legitimate prince, and
that not only for a few days, unless we testify our voluntary submission
before God; and he who prays to God for the happy state of the country
in which he lives, will not surely neglect his other duties.  <span
id="fr_209"></span>[210](#fn_209.md) The principal thing indeed is to
testify before God what our feeling is; and then other things must be
added, such as promptitude to perform all duties of obedience and
everything of the like kind. It now follows, —

<span id="xii.viii"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p1"></span><span id="xii.viii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#008.md)<span id="xii.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p2"></span>**8.** For thus saith the LORD of hosts,
the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that *be* in
the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye
cause to be dreamed.

<span id="xii.viii-p3"></span>**8.** Quoniam sic dicit Jehova
exercituum, Deus Israel, Ne decipiant vos prophetae vestri, qui sunt in
medio vestri, et divini vestri; et ne attendatis ad somnia vestra, quae
vos somniatis.

<span id="xii.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.viii-p5"></span><span id="xii.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p6"></span>As the minds of almost all were taken up,
as we have seen, with that vain and false confidence which they had
imbibed from false prophecies, that they should return after two years,
the Prophet gives this answer, and reminds them to beware of such
impostures. And thus we see that it is not sufficient for one simply to
teach what is right, except he also restores from error those who have
been already deceived or are in danger of being deceived. For to assert
the truth is only one-half of the office of teaching, because Satan ever
leads his ministers to corrupt the pure doctrine with falsehoods. It is
not then enough to proclaim the truth itself, except all the fallacies
of the devil be also dissipated, of which there is at this day a
manifest instance under the Papacy; for as the minds of almost all are
there inebriated with many corrupt inventions, were any one only to shew
that this or that is right, he would certainly never in this way
eradicate errors from the hearts of men. And hence Paul bids bishops not
only to be furnished with doctrine in order to shew the right way to the
teachable, but also to be so armed as to be able to resist adversaries
and to close their mouths. (<span id="xii.viii-p6.1"></span>Titus 1:9.)

<span id="xii.viii-p7"></span>Inasmuch then as from the beginning of the
world Satan has never ceased to try and attempt, as far as he could, to
corrupt the truth of God, or to immerse it in darkness, it has hence
been always necessary for God’s servants to be prepared to do these two
things — faithfully to teach the meek and humble, — and boldly to oppose
the enemies of truth and break down their insolence. This is the rule
which the Prophet now follows; he had exhorted the Jews to bear
patiently the tyranny to which they were subject, because it was God’s
yoke; but as on the other hand the false prophets boasted that there
would be a return in two years, it was necessary for him to oppose them;
on this point then he now speaks.

<span id="xii.viii-p8"></span>And that what he was going to say might
have more weight, he speaks again in God’s name, *Let not your prophets
who are in the midst of you deceive you* For while Jeremiah had many
adversaries at Jerusalem, the devil was also deceiving the miserable
exiles in Chaldea. He then warns them not to believe these impostors;
and though by way of concession he calls them prophets who were wholly
unworthy of so honorable a name, he yet by way of reproach gives them
afterwards the name of *diviners* Then the first name refers to that
outward profession in which they gloried, when they boasted that they
were sent by God and brought his commands. He then conceded to them the
name of prophets, but improperly, or as they say, catachristically; as
the case is at this day; for we do not always fight about names, but we
call those priests, bishops or prelates, who are so brutal that they
ought not to be classed among men. In like manner, as it has already
often appeared, the prophets spoke freely, and never hesitated to call
those prophets who had already gained some estimation among the people.
But that they might not be proud of such fallacious boasting, he
afterwards designated them by another name; he called them *diviners,*
and then *dreamers;* and afterwards he adds, *Attend not to your dreams*
He addresses here the whole people; and there were a few who, under the
color and pretense of having a prophetic spirit, announced prophecies.

<span id="xii.viii-p9"></span>But Jeremiah did not without reason
transfer to the whole people what belonged to a few; for we know that
the devil’s ministers are cherished not only through the foolish
credulity of men, but also through a depraved appetite. For the world is
never *deceived* but willingly, and men, as though they were given up to
their own destruction, seek for themselves falsehoods in every
direction, and though unwilling to be *deceived,* they yet for the most
part seek to be deceived. Were any one to ask, does the world wish to be
deceived? all would cry out, from the least to the greatest, that they
shun and fear nothing so much; and yet whence is it that as soon as
Satan gives any sign, he attracts vast multitudes, except that we are by
nature prone to what is false and vain? Then there is another evil, that
we prefer darkness to light. Jeremiah then did no wrong to the people by
telling them to beware of the dreams which, they dreamt.

<span id="xii.viii-p10"></span>Some indeed take <span
id="xii.viii-p10.1"></span>םימלחמ, *mechelmim,* in a transitive sense,
as it is in *Hiphil,* and ought to have been written here <span
id="xii.viii-p10.2"></span>םימילחמ*, mechelimim;* but it may be taken in
the neuter gender.  <span id="fr_210"></span>[211](#fn_210.md)

<span id="xii.viii-p12"></span>However this may be, the meaning of the
Prophet is not ambiguous; for he imputes this to all the Jews, that they
were deceived by vain dreams, and that the fault could not be confined
to a few impostors, for it was an evil common to them all. And the
pronoun <span id="xii.viii-p12.1"></span>םתא*, atere,* is emphatical,
*ye,* he says*, dream;* for he sets these false dreams in opposition to
prophecies. We know that God formerly revealed his will either by
visions or by dreams. There were then dreams, which were divine, of
which God was the author. But he shews here that the people devised all
these impostures for themselves, so that it availed them nothing to
pretend that they were prophets, the interpreters of God, and that they
announced what they had received by dreams; for what makes the
difference is, whether one dreams from his own brain, or whether God
reveals to him in a dream what ought to be deemed oracular. We now then
understand the design of the Prophet. It follows, —

<span id="xii.ix"></span>

<span id="xii.ix-p1"></span><span id="xii.ix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#009.md)<span id="xii.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ix-p2"></span>**9.** For they prophesy falsely to you in
my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD.

<span id="xii.ix-p3"></span>**9.** Quoniam fallaciter (*vel,* in
mendacio) ipsi prophetant vobis in nomine meo; non misi eos, dicit
Jehova.

<span id="xii.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.ix-p5"></span><span id="xii.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ix-p6"></span>He confirms what he had said by this reason,
that they ran without being called, according to what we found in <span
id="xii.ix-p6.1"></span>[Jer
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021.md)<span id="xii.ix-p6.1"></span>.
He then repudiates these false prophets, for they spoke not from the
mouth of God. But the difference was rendered very obscure and
indistinct, when they pompously alleged the name of God and professed
that they brought forward nothing but what they had learnt from him; yet
as we have elsewhere said, no one can be deceived except willingly and
knowingly; for God never leaves his faithful people destitute of the
spirit of discernment, provided they offer themselves cordially and
sincerely to be taught by his true and legitimate servants. And then the
Jews ought to have examined all the doctrines and all the prophecies by
the rule of the Law. But if the Law was difficult to be understood, they
ought, as I have said, to have sought of God the spirit of wisdom and
discernment.

<span id="xii.ix-p7"></span>Jeremiah then did not without reason reject
whatever the false prophets boasted of, for the purpose of gaining the
approbation and applause of the people; for they were not sent nor
approved by God. So also at this day, every one who wishes to
distinguish with certainty between various doctrines, by which the world
is agitated, nay, shaken, can without difficulty attain his object,
provided he offers himself as a scholar to Christ, and connects the Law
and the Prophets with the Gospel, and makes use of this rule to prove
all doctrines; and provided in the meantime he trusts not to his own
acumen, but submits himself to God and seeks of him the spirit of
judgment and discrimination. It ought also to be observed, that in the
same way the false prophets can be abundantly exposed when we thus shew
that they are not sent by God; and we further convince them of vanity,
when we prove their doctrine to be inconsistent with the Law and the
Gospel.

<span id="xii.ix-p8"></span>However this may be, this principle ought to
be held, that none ought to be attended to, but those who can shew that
they bring messages from God and are furnished with his word. We have
said elsewhere, that in order that any one may be *accounted* as sent by
God, it is necessary, first, that he should be rightly called, and
secondly, that he should faithfully execute his office; for whosoever
thrusts in himself without the command of God, though he may speak what
is true and holy, he yet deserves not the name of a Prophet or teacher;
and then vocation itself will not be sufficient, except there be
faithfulness and integrity. But what Jeremiah mainly insists on here is,
that those who promised the people a return in a short time did not
speak from the mouth of God: *They prophesy falsely,* he says, *in my
name;* how? *Because I have not sent them*. It follows —

<span id="xii.x"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p1"></span><span id="xii.x-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010.md)<span id="xii.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p2"></span>**10.** For thus saith the LORD, That after
seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform
my good word toward you, in causing you to return to this place.

<span id="xii.x-p3"></span>**10.** Quia sic dicit Jehova, secundum
mensuram (nam <span id="xii.x-p3.1"></span>תאלמ *accipitur metaphorice
pro mensura; sed adhuc aspera esset loquutio, ideo simplicius vertendum
est,* quia ubi impleti fuerint) in Babylone septuaginta anni, visitabo
vos, et suscitabo super vos sermonem meum bonum, ut reducam vos ad locum
hunc.

<span id="xii.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.x-p5"></span><span id="xii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p6"></span>In order to expose the dreams by which the
false prophets had inebriated the people, he again repeats what he had
said, that the end of their exile could not be expected until the end of
seventy years. And this way of teaching ought to be particularly
observed, for the truth of God will ever avail to dissipate all the
mists in which Satan never ceases to envelop the pure truth. As then we
have before seen, that when the people are imbued with any error, it
ought to be boldly resisted; so now we see with what weapons all God’s
servants ought to fight, in order to expose all those fallacies by which
pure doctrine is assailed, even by setting in opposition to them the
word of God: for this is the way which Jeremiah points out to us by his
own example. He had spoken of the false prophets, he warned the people
not to believe them; but as the minds of many were still vacillating, he
confirms what he had said that they were not sent by God, because God
never varies in his purpose, and never changes, and is never
inconsistent with himself: “Now he has prefixed seventy years for your
exile; whoever, then, tries to impugn that truth, is a professed and an
open enemy to God.” We now perceive the object of the Prophet; *When
seventy years then shall be fulfilled, etc*  <span
id="fr_211"></span>[212](#fn_211.md)

<span id="xii.x-p8"></span>The Prophet here puts a restraint on the
Jews, that they might not hasten before the time; and then he gives them
the hope of a return, provided they quietly rested until the end fixed
on by God. There are then two things in this verse, — that the people
would ill consult their own good, if they hastened and promised to
themselves a return before the end of seventy years, — and that when
that time was completed, the hope of a return would be certain, for God
had so promised.

<span id="xii.x-p9"></span>He adds, *And I will raise up my good word
towards you* By *good word* he means what might bring joy to the Jews.
Though God’s word is fatal to the unbelieving, yet it never changes its
nature; it ever remains good. And hence Paul says that the Gospel is a
fatal odor to many, but that it is, nevertheless, a sweet odor before
God, (<span id="xii.x-p9.1"></span>[2Co
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016)<span id="xii.x-p9.1"></span>;.md)
for it ought to be imputed to the fault of those who perish, that they
receive not the doctrine of the Gospel to their own salvation. The word
of God is then always good: but this commendation is to be referred to
experience, that is, when God really shews that he is propitious to us.
And a shorter definition cannot be given, than that the good word
denotes the promises, by which God testifies his paternal favor. But we
have seen elsewhere that threatenings are called an evil word: why so?
This character cannot, indeed, as it has been just said, be suitably
applied to God’s word; yet God’s word which threatens destruction is
called evil, as it is said,

<span id="xii.x-p10"></span>“I am he who create good and evil,” (<span
id="xii.x-p10.1"></span>[Isa 45:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa045.htm#007.md)<span
id="xii.x-p10.1"></span>)

<span id="xii.x-p11"></span>but it is so according to our apprehension
of its effects. And all this reasoning seems nearly superfluous, when we
understand that God by the word of evil strikes the unbelieving with
fear, but that the Prophet now means no other thing than to bear
testimony to God’s favor to the Jews: and hence he says, that they would
find by experience, that God had not in vain promised what he had before
mentioned.

<span id="xii.x-p12"></span>But he is said to *rouse up*  <span
id="fr_212"></span>[213](#fn_212.md) his good word, that is, when it
produced its effects before their eyes; for when God only speaks, and
the thing itself does not yet appear, his word seems in a manner to he
dormant and to be useless. And for seventy years the Jews could perceive
no other thing than that God was displeased with them, and thus they
were continually in fear; for the promise continued as it were dormant,
as its effects were not as yet visible. God then is said to rouse up his
word, when he proves that he has not promised anything in vain. The
meaning is, that the prophecy which Jeremiah had related would not be
fruitless; but if the people did not soon know this, yet God, when the
time came, would really prove that he deceives not his people, nor
allures them when he promises anything, by vain hopes.

<span id="xii.x-p14"></span>And the Prophet explains himself, for he
says that God would *restore* them to their own country: for this was
the *good word,* the promise of deliverance, as the word, according to
what the people felt, was evil, and bitter, and bad, when God had
threatened that he would cast away the reprobate. But it is an
accidental thing, as I have said, that men find God’s word to be evil
for them or adverse to them; for it proceeds from their own fault, and
not from the nature of the word. It follows —

<span id="xii.xi"></span>

<span id="xii.xi-p1"></span><span id="xii.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#011.md)<span id="xii.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xi-p2"></span>**11.** For I know the thoughts that I think
toward you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give
you an expected end.

<span id="xii.xi-p3"></span>**11.** Quia ego cognosco cogitationes meas,
quas ego cogito super vos, dicit Jehova, cogitationes pacis, et non in
malum; ut dem vobis finem et expectationem.

<span id="xii.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.xi-p5"></span><span id="xii.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xi-p6"></span>He confirms the same thing, and employs many
words, because it was difficult to raise up minds wholly broken down.
For the world labors under two extreme evils, — they sink in despair, or
are too much exalted by foolish pride: nay, there is no moderation
except when ruled by God’s Spirit we recumb on his word; for when they
devise vain hopes for themselves, they are immediately rapt up above the
clouds, fly here and there, and in short think that they can climb into
heaven; this is the excess of vain and foolish confidence: but when they
are dejected, then they fall down wholly frightened, nay, being
astonished and lifeless they lose every feeling, receive no comfort, and
cannot taste of anything which God promises. And both these evils
prevailed evidently among the Jews. We have seen how much the Prophet
labored to lay prostrate their pride and arrogance; for they laughed at
all threatenings, and remained ever secure; though God, as it were, with
an armed hand and a drawn sword menaced them with certain destruction,
yet nothing moved them. And when they were driven into exile, they were
extremely credulous when the false prophets promised them a quick
return; while, in the meantime, God, by his servants, shewed to them
that he would be gracious to them, and after seventy years would become
their deliverer; but they were deaf to all these things, nay, they
rejected with disdain all these promises, and said,

<span id="xii.xi-p7"></span>“What! will God, forsooth, raise up the
dead!” *  
*(<span id="xii.xi-p7.2"></span>[Eze
37:12](../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#012)<span id="xii.xi-p7.2"></span>.md)

<span id="xii.xi-p8"></span>This, then, is the reason why the Prophet
now speaks so largely of their future redemption: it was difficult to
persuade the Jews; for as they thought that they would soon return to
their own country, they could not endure delay, nor exercise the
patience which God commanded. They were at the same time, as we have
said, quite confident, inasmuch as the false prophets filled their minds
with vain hopes.

<span id="xii.xi-p9"></span>He therefore says, *I know the thoughts
which I think towards you* Some think that God claims here, as what
peculiarly belongs to him, the foreknowledge of future things; but this
is foreign to the Prophet’s meaning. There is here, on the contrary, an
implied contrast between the certain counsel of God, and the vain
imaginations in which the Jews indulged themselves. The same thing is
meant when Isaiah says,

<span id="xii.xi-p10"></span>“As far as the heavens are from the earth,
so far are my thoughts from your thoughts,” (<span
id="xii.xi-p10.1"></span>[Isa
55:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#009)<span id="xii.xi-p10.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xii.xi-p11"></span>for they were wont absurdly to measure God
by their own ideas. When anything was promised, they reasoned about its
validity, and looked on all surrounding circumstances; and thus they
consulted only their own brains. Hence God reproved them, and shewed how
preposterously they acted, and said, that his thoughts were as remote
from their thoughts as heaven is from the earth. So also in this place,
though the two parts are not here expressed; the Prophet’s object was no
other than to shew, that the Jews ought to have surrendered themselves
to God, and not to seek to be so acute as to understand how this or that
would be done, but to feel convinced that what God had decreed could not
be changed.

<span id="xii.xi-p12"></span>It must yet be remarked, that he speaks not
here of his hidden and incomprehensible counsel. What then are the
thoughts of which Jeremiah now speaks? They were those respecting the
people’s deliverance, after the time was completed, for God had promised
that he would then be propitious to his Church. We hence see that the
question here is not about the hidden counsels of God, but that the
reference is simply to the word which was well known to the Jews, even
to the prophecy of Jeremiah, by which he had predicted that the Jews
would be exiles for seventy years, and would at last find that their
punishment would be only a small chastisement, as it would only be for a
time: *I know* then *my thoughts* But still he indirectly condemns the
Jews, because they entertained no hope of deliverance except from what
came within the reach of their senses. He then teaches us that true
wisdom is to obey God, and to surrender ourselves to him; and that when
we understand not his counsel, we ought resignedly to wait until the due
time shall come.

<span id="xii.xi-p13"></span>He says that they were *thoughts of peace,*
 <span id="fr_213"></span>[214](#fn_213.md) that is, of benevolence. Peace,
as it has been often said, is taken for felicity, as in <span
id="xii.xi-p15.2"></span>[Jer
29:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#007.md)<span id="xii.xi-p15.2"></span>,

<span id="xii.xi-p16"></span>“For the peace of Babylon shall be your
peace;”

<span id="xii.xi-p17"></span>that is, if Babylon be prosperous, you
shall be partakers of the same happiness. So now, in this place, God
declares that his thoughts were those of peace, for he designed really
to shew by the effect his paternal kindness towards his people.

<span id="xii.xi-p18"></span>He afterwards adds, *that 1 may give you
the end and the expectation* By <span id="xii.xi-p18.1"></span>תירחא,
*achrit,* which means in Hebrew the last thing, we are to understand
here the end, as though he had said, that it was to be deemed as final
ruin, when people had been driven away to a foreign land. For it was no
small trial when the Jews were deprived of that land which was the rest
and habitation of God; it was the same as though they had been cut off
from every hope: it was then a sort of repudiation, and repudiation was
a kind of death. But here God declares that he would put an end to their
exile, as it was to be only for a time. It is hence to be inferred, that
the people did not perish when they were led into exile, but that they
were only chastised by God’s hand.

<span id="xii.xi-p19"></span>He adds *expectation,* which Jerome has
rendered “patience,” but in a very forced manner. There is, indeed, no
doubt but that by this second word the Prophet more fully and clearly
expressed what he meant by the first word, <span
id="xii.xi-p19.1"></span>תירחא*, achrit,* even the end that was wished
or desired, *I will* then *give you the end,* even that ye may enjoy the
promises, as ye wish and expect, and ought to hope for, since God has
made them.  <span id="fr_214"></span>[215](#fn_214.md) Here I will make an
end.

<span id="xii.xii"></span>

<span id="xii.xii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xii.xii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast
been pleased kindly to shew to us thy paternal love, and givest us daily
a testimony of it in thy Gospel, — O grant, that we may not go astray,
following our vagrant and erring thoughts, but acquiesce in thy simple
truth; and though we must be exercised in this world by many conflicts,
as our life is to be as it were a continual warfare, may we yet never
doubt but that there is prepared for us a sure rest in heaven through
Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xii.xiv"></span>

<span id="xii.xiv-p1"></span><span id="xii.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#012.md)<span id="xii.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xiv-p2"></span>**12.** Then shall ye call upon me, and ye
shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.

<span id="xii.xiv-p3"></span>**12.** Et invocabitis me et ibitis; et
orabitis me, et exaudiam vos.

<span id="xii.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.xiv-p5"></span><span id="xii.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xiv-p6"></span>Jeremiah pursues the same subject, even
that the Jews, after having undergone the punishment allotted to them by
God, would at length return to their own country and find God merciful,
and hence learn that their chastisement in exile would prove useful to
them. He had indeed in the last verse explained this with sufficient
clearness, but he now expresses the manner; and that would be by calling
on God. he uses two words, *Ye shall call on me,* he says, and pray. The
verb put between these two <span id="xii.xiv-p6.1"></span>םתכלה,
*elcatem,* is regarded almost by all as referring to a right course of
life, as though the Prophet had said, that those who before wandered
after their own lusts would now walk in the way of God, that is, in his
Law; but this seems to me to be too forced an explanation. I doubt not
then, but that the Prophet here indirectly reproves the indifference of
the people in not immediately acknowledging that they were chastised by
God’s hand, that they ought in due time to repent. To *go* then or to
walk is the same thing, in my judgment, as though he had said, “After
having suffered the exile, not of one year, but of seventy years, ye
shall then begin to be wise.”

<span id="xii.xiv-p7"></span>It was not only sloth but stupidity, that
they were not subdued by God’s scourges so as to call on him; but as
they were of a disposition so rude and refractory the Prophet here
briefly reminds them that many years had been necessary to subdue them,
as twenty or thirty years were not sufficient. We now then understand
the design of the word <span id="xii.xiv-p7.1"></span>קלה, *elek, to*
walk.  <span id="fr_215"></span>[216](#fn_215.md) The meaning then is, that
after having profited under the scourges of God, they would become
humble so as to deprecate his wrath.

<span id="xii.xiv-p9"></span>But there is added a promise, that God
would *hear* them. It may however appear, that God promised conversion
even in the first clause; and, no doubt, prayer is the fruit of
repentance, for it proceeds from faith; and repentance is the gift of
God. And further, we cannot call on God rightly and sincerely except by
the guidance and teaching of the Holy Spirit; for he it is who not only
dictates our words, but also creates groanings in our hearts. And thus
*Augustin,* writing against the Pelagians, understands the passage, and
proves that it is not in the power of man either to convert himself or
to pray; “for God,” he says, “would in vain promise what is in the power
of man to do; and this is the promise, *ye shall pray;* it then follows,
that we do not pray through the impulse of our own flesh, but when the
Holy Spirit directs our hearts, and in a manner prays in us.” I do not,
however, know whether the Prophet intended to speak in so refined a
manner. From other passages of Scripture it is easy to prove, that we
cannot pray to God, except he anticipates us by his own Spirit. But as
to this passage, I prefer to take a simpler meaning, that God would
*hear,* when they began to pray; but yet he shews that it would not be
after a short space of time, because they were almost untameable, and
would not repent until after many years. It follows, —

<span id="xii.xv"></span>

<span id="xii.xv-p1"></span><span id="xii.xv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#013.md)<span id="xii.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xv-p2"></span>**13.** And ye shall seek me, and find *me*,
when ye shall search for me with all your heart.

<span id="xii.xv-p3"></span>**13.** Et quaeretis me, et invenietis, quia
quaeretis in toto corde vestro.

<span id="xii.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.xv-p5"></span><span id="xii.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xv-p6"></span>He confirms in other words the same thing;
and yet the repetition, as we said yesterday, is not useless; for as the
Jews perversely despised all threatenings, so it was difficult for them
to receive any taste of God’s goodness from his promises. This then is
the reason why the Prophet employs many words on this subject. By the
word *seek,* he means prayers and supplications, as mentioned in the
last verse. And Christ also, exhorting his disciples to pray, says,
“Seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you.” There is
no doubt but that he speaks there of prayer; he yet adopted various
modes of speaking, derived from the common habits of men. But to seek,
when we feel the need of God’s grace, is nothing else than to pray.
Hence the Prophet says, *ye shall seek me and ye shall find me* And
though he addresses here the Israelites, yet this doctrine ought to be
extended to the whole Church; for God testifies that he will be
propitious to all who flee to him.

<span id="xii.xv-p7"></span>But as hypocrites are abundantly noisy, and
seem to surpass the very saints in the ardor of their zeal, when the
external profession is only regarded, the Prophet adds, *Because*  <span
id="fr_216"></span>[217](#fn_216.md) *ye shall seek me with your whole
heart* There is no doubt but that the Jews groaned a thousand times
every year when oppressed by the Chaldeans; for they had to bear all
kind of reproaches, and then they had nothing safe or secure. They were
therefore under the necessity, except they were harder than iron, to
offer some prayers. But God shews that the seasonable time would not
come, until their prayers proceeded from a right feeling; this he means
by the *whole heart.* It is indeed certain that men never turn to God
with their whole heart, nor is the whole heart ever so much engaged in
prayer as it ought to be; but the Prophet sets the whole heart in
opposition to a double heart. Perfection, then, is not what is to be
understood here, which can never be found in men, but integrity or
sincerity.

<span id="xii.xv-p10"></span>We now then perceive the meaning of the
Prophet’s words, — that the Jews, when they began in earnest to flee to
God, would find him propitious, provided only they did this in sincerity
of heart and not in dissimulation; and also that this would not take
place soon, for their hardness and obstinacy were greater than that they
could be brought to repent in a short time. Therefore God reminds them
that there was need of many evils, so that they might at length turn and
divest themselves of that perverseness to which they had wholly
surrendered themselves.

<span id="xii.xv-p11"></span>Now the whole of this, as I have already
observed, ought to be applied to the benefit of the Church; for this
promise is to be extended to all the godly, — that when they call on God
in their miseries, he will hear them. And Jeremiah seems to have taken
this sentence from Isaiah,

<span id="xii.xv-p12"></span>“As soon as thou callest on me, I will hear
thee; before thou speakest, I will stretch forth my hand.” (<span
id="xii.xv-p12.1"></span>[Isa
58:9](../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#009)<span id="xii.xv-p12.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xii.xv-p13"></span>And this circumstance also ought to be
noticed, that the Prophet addressed the Jews who were miserably
oppressed. Let us then know that this sentence is rightly addressed to
those in distress, who seem to have God against them and displeased with
them; and this is the seasonable time which is mentioned by David in
<span id="xii.xv-p13.1"></span>[Ps
32:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa032.htm#006.md)<span id="xii.xv-p13.1"></span>.

<span id="xii.xv-p14"></span>This passage also teaches us, that it is no
wonder that the Lord doubles his scourges and does not immediately
pardon us, because we are not so ready to bend as to return to him on
the first day. He is therefore constrained by our perverseness to
chastise us for a longer time; and yet this promise is still to be held
valid, that if we even late repent, God will be still propitious to us,
only that the reprobate are not under this pretext to indulge in their
vices; for we see that profane men trifle with God, and wickedly abuse
his paternal indulgence. Let the sinner then beware lest he should lay
up for himself a store of vengeance, if he waits till the end of life.
But there is still a hope set before those who have been long torpid in
their sins, that if they at length come, though late, they shall still
come in time, for God will hear them. But the exception ought to be
carefully observed, that God will not be intreated, except he is sought
with the whole heart, that is, in sincerity. So there is no reason for
us to wonder that his ears are often closed to our prayers, because we
only pretend to seek him, and that we are endued with no sincerity
appears from our life. It now follows, —

<span id="xii.xvi"></span>

<span id="xii.xvi-p1"></span><span id="xii.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#014.md)<span id="xii.xvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xvi-p2"></span>**14.** And I will be found of you, saith
the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you
from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you,
saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the place whence I
caused you to be carried away captive.

<span id="xii.xvi-p3"></span>**14.** Et inveniar a vobis, dicit Jehova,
et reducam captivitatem vestram, et colligam (*vel,* congregabo) vox ex
omnibus gentibus et ex omnibus locis quo expulero vos illue, dicit
Jehova; et redire faciam vos ad locum e quo expuli vos illinc
(*abundat*).

<span id="xii.xvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.xvi-p5"></span><span id="xii.xvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xvi-p6"></span>The Prophet now applies what he seemed to
have spoken generally. He then shews the effect of God’s favor, after
having been reconciled to his people, even that he would re*store* their
captivity, and gather them from all places. This was particularly said
to the Jews; but the two former verses contain, as I have said, a
general doctrine. He had before said, *Ye shall find me;* but he says
now, *I shall be found by you,* or, I will shew myself to you. There is
an implied contrast between the hiding and the manifestation, for God
had in a manner hid himself during the time of exile; but he suddenly
made his face to shine forth, and thus manifested himself as a Father,
after having apparently forgotten his people. Suitably then does the
Prophet speak here; for though the Lord ever looks on us, we on the
other hand do not see him, nay, we think that he is far from us. But he
then only appears to us, when we perceive that he cares for our
salvation.

<span id="xii.xvi-p7"></span>By saying, *from all nations and from all
places,* he evidently obviated a doubt which otherwise might have crept
into the minds of many, “How can it ever be that God will gather us
after we have been thus dispersed?” For no certain region had been
allotted to them, in which they might dwell together so as to form one
body; but they had been scattered as by a violent whirlwind like chaff
or stubble; and God had so driven them away that there was no hope of
being again gathered. As then it was incredible, that a people so
dispersed could be collected together, the Prophet says, “from all
nations and from all places.” The same thing is declared in the Psalm,

<span id="xii.xvi-p8"></span>“He will gather the dispersions of Israel.”
(<span id="xii.xvi-p8.1"></span>[Ps
147:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa147.htm#002)<span id="xii.xvi-p8.1"></span>.md)

<span id="xii.xvi-p9"></span>For when the Jews looked on their dreadful
dispersion, they could entertain no hope. We see then how the Prophet
encouraged them still to hope, and bade them to struggle against this
trial. The sentence seems to have been taken from Moses, for he says,

<span id="xii.xvi-p10"></span>“Though you be scattered through the
extreme parts of the world, yet God will gather you.” (<span
id="xii.xvi-p10.1"></span>[De
30:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#001.md)<span
id="xii.xvi-p10.1"></span>)

<span id="xii.xvi-p11"></span>We see that Moses there expressly reproves
the unbelief of the people, if they despaired of God’s mercy and
salvation, because they were torn and scattered. he therefore shews that
God’s power was abundantly sufficient to collect them again, though they
were scattered to the four quarters of the world. We now perceive the
object of the Prophet.  <span id="fr_217"></span>[218](#fn_217.md)

<span id="xii.xvi-p13"></span>And hence we may gather a useful doctrine,
— that God in a wonderful manner gathers his Church when scattered, so
as to form it into one body, however he may for a time obliterate its
name and even its very appearance. And of this he has given us some
proof in our time. For who could have thought that what we now see with
our eyes, would ever take place? that God would in a secret manner
gather his elect, when there was everywhere a dreadful desolation, and
no corner found in the world where two or three faithful men could dwell
together. We hence see that this prophecy has not been fulfilled only at
one time, but that the grace of God is here set forth, which he has
often manifested, and still manifests in gathering his Church. It
follows, —

<span id="xii.xvii"></span>

<span id="xii.xvii-p1"></span><span id="xii.xvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah

<span id="xii.xvii-p3"></span>**15.** Quoniam dixistis, Excitabit nobis
Jehova prophetas in Babylone;

<span id="xii.xvii-p6"></span>**17.** Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence,
and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so
evil.

ego mitto in eos gladium, famem, pestem; et ponam eos tanquam ficus
sordidas *(aut,* foetidas,) quae non comeduntur prae malitia *(id est,*
prae amaritudine.)

<span id="xii.xvii-p8"></span> 

<span id="xii.xvii-p9"></span><span id="xii.xvii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xvii-p10"></span>Many interpreters connect the first of
these verses with the preceding ones, and they seem not to think so
without reason; for the reason given is not unsuitable, if we refer to
what the Prophet had said, even that the Jews were by no means to hope
for a return until the end of seventy years. But the meaning I adopt is
more probable; the particle <span id="xii.xvii-p10.1"></span>יכ, *ki,*
is repeated; the first is causal, and the second an illative;  <span
id="fr_218"></span>[219](#fn_218.md) and consistently with the usage of
Scripture the learned and the experienced think that this is the real
meaning of the Prophet. He then says, that the captives were very
foolish who hoped for a quick end to their exile, because they had false
prophets who gave them such a promise; *ye have* then *said, that
prophets have been given you, in Chaldea,* and that God had there pitied
you, because there are those who prophesy of a return in a short time.
As then ye are so foolishly credulous, *Thus saith Jehovah to your
brethren,* he then turns his discourse to the exiles, and exhorts them
not to suffer themselves to be led astray. But here he indirectly
reproves them, because they could not bear a condition which was even
better than that of the residue, as though he had said, “What means this
your unreasonableness! that when all your ways are closed up against
you, and the power of your conqueror is so great that ye cannot move a
finger without his nod, ye should yet think that you shall be set free
in two years! and surely if you were before foolishly secure and
confident, your calamities ought now to make you humble. But your
brethren, who seem yet to enjoy liberty because they dwell at Jerusalem,
(for those alone were then remaining,) even these your brethren suffer
far more grievously than ye do.”

<span id="xii.xvii-p13"></span><span id="xii.xvii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xvii-p14"></span>We now perceive for what purpose the
Prophet, after having addressed the captives, turned his discourse to
King Zedekiah and to the Jews, who as yet remained at home or in their
own country; it was, that the captives might hence know how great was
their madness to promise to themselves a return, after having been
driven to remote lands, when final ruin was nigh both the king and the
people, who as yet remained at Jerusalem; *Thus* then *saith Jehovah to
the king who sits on the throne of David, and to all the people who sit
in this city, etc*

<span id="xii.xvii-p15"></span>To *sit,* as I have already said, is to
be taken here in two different senses; the king is said to sit on his
throne while he retains his dignity; but the people are said to sit
while they rest and dwell quietly in any place. It is not without reason
that the word *king* is here expressly mentioned, for the exiles were
ever wont to connect it with the hope of their return; “The Temple still
remains, God is there worshipped, and the kingdom still exists; these
things being secure, it cannot be all over with our nation.” The safety
of the people depended on the kingdom and the priesthood. When
therefore, on the one hand, they fixed their eyes on royalty, and on the
other hand, on the priesthood and sacrifices, they felt persuaded that
it could not be otherwise but that God would soon restore them; for God
had promised that the kingdom of David would be perpetual, as long as
the sun and moon would shine in heaven. Except then this splendor or
glory had been extinguished, the Israelites could not have been
humiliated, especially as those who had been led into exile were of the
tribe of Judah. We now understand why the word *king* was expressly
mentioned. Though, then, a king still sat on the throne of David, he yet
declares that his condition and that of his people was harder than that
of the captive multitude.

<span id="xii.xvii-p16"></span><span id="xii.xvii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xvii-p17"></span>He says, *I will pursue them with the
sword, and famine, and pestilence* The surrender of Jeconiah, as we have
elsewhere seen, was voluntary; he was therefore more kindly received by
the king of Babylon. At length the city was attacked, and as the siege
was long, there was more rage felt against the king and the whole
people, for the Chaldeans had been wearied by their obstinacy. Hence it
was, that they dealt more severely with them. But nothing happened
except through the just vengeance of God; for though they exasperated
the Chaldeans, there is no doubt but that God blinded their minds so
that they procured for themselves a heavier judgment. It was, then, a
punishment inflicted on them by God; and hence rightly does Jeremiah
testify that God was the author of those calamities, for the Chaldeans,
as we have seen elsewhere, were only ministers and executioners of God’s
vengeance; *Jehovah of hosts* then *says, Behold, I will pursue you,*
etc.

<span id="xii.xvii-p18"></span>He then adds, *And I will make them like
worthless figs* He calls the figs here <span
id="xii.xvii-p18.1"></span>םירעש, *sherim,* worthless; but in the
twenty-fourth chapter he called them bad; still the meaning is the same.
There is no doubt but that he refers to the prophecy which we there
explained. For the Prophet saw two baskets of figs, in one of which were
sweet figs, and in the other bitter. God asked, “What seest thou?” he
said, “Good figs, very good, and bad figs, very bad.” God afterwards
added, “The good and sweet figs are the captives; for I will at length
shew mercy to them, and liberty to return shall be given them. They
shall then be good figs, though now a different opinion is formed; for
they who still lived at Jerusalem, think themselves more happy than the
exiles; but the bad and bitter figs,” he says, “are this people who
pride themselves, because they have not been led into captivity; for I
will consume them with the pestilence, and the famine, and the sword.”
This was the Prophet’s language in that passage. He now again declares
that King Zedekiah and all the people would be like bitter and putrid
figs, which, being so bad, are not fit to be eaten. He then adds, —

<span id="xii.xviii"></span>

<span id="xii.xviii-p1"></span><span
id="xii.xviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah

<span id="xii.xviii-p2"></span>**18.** And I will persecute them with
the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver
them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and
an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations
whither I have driven them:

<span id="xii.xviii-p3"></span>**18.** Et persequar (ad verbum est, post
eos: persequar eos) gladio, fame et peste; et ponam eos in commotionem
(vel, concussionem) cunctis regnis terrae, in execrationem, et in
stuporem, et in sibilum, et in probrum inter cunctas gentes ad quas
expulero eos (vel, quo expulero eos illuc:)

<span id="xii.xviii-p4"></span>**19.** Because they have not hearkened
to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent unto them by my servants the
prophets, rising up early and sending *them*; but ye would not hear,
saith the LORD.

<span id="xii.xviii-p5"></span>**19.** Propterea quod non audierunt
sermones meos, inquit Jehovah, quos misi ad eos peer servos meos
Prophetas, mane surgendo et mittendo; et non audistis, inquit Jehova.

<span id="xii.xviii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xii.xviii-p7"></span><span id="xii.xviii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xviii-p8"></span>He goes on with the same subject, — that
he would not cease to consume them with pestilence, famine, and the
sword, until he wholly destroyed them, according to what we find in the
twenty-fourth chapter. He repeats what is in that chapter; but the words
are taken from the twenty-eighth chapter of Deuteronomy, and from the
twenty-ninth. The prophets, we know, drew the substance of their
doctrine from the fountain of the Law, and, strictly speaking, brought
forward nothing new, but accommodated the doctrine of Moses to the
circumstances of the time in which each lived.

<span id="xii.xviii-p9"></span>Hence we find among the curses of the Law
these words, *I will set them for a commotion,* or a concussion. The
word may be explained in two ways, — either that the nations would
tremble at such a sad spectacle, — or that they would shake their head.
The second view is to be preferred, according to what I have stated
elsewhere, *I will* then *set them for a commotion,* that is, every one
who shall see their miseries, will shake his head in contempt, as though
he had said, “All will assent to the just vengeance of God, and ye shall
be objects of reproach among all the heathens; for all will acknowledge
that ye suffer most justly for your sins.”

<span id="xii.xviii-p10"></span>He adds, *for a curse* The word <span
id="xii.xviii-p10.1"></span>הלא, *ale,* is properly an oath, but is
taken in many places for a curse, which is introduced or understood when
we swear. But as men often expose themselves to punishment for perjury,
the word means, frequently, a curse; and what is to be understood, as it
has been explained elsewhere, is a pattern or formula of a curse; and we
have seen in what sense the Prophet said this, that is, that every one
who wished to curse himself or others, or to imprecate, as they say,
some dire things, would take the Jews for an example, “May God curse
thee as he did the Jews;” or, “May he draw forth his severity to thy
ruin, as he did to the Jews.” He then says that they would be *for a
curse,* that is, that they would be so miserable that they would be
taken as an example in imprecations.

<span id="xii.xviii-p11"></span>He afterwards adds, *for an
astonishment,* as he had spoken of the shaking of the head, so now he
mentions astonishment, which is something more grievous, that is, when
such a spectacle presents itself as makes all men to stand astonished,
as not knowing what it means. *Hissing* is mentioned; as it is said
elsewhere that they would be a proverb, <span
id="xii.xviii-p11.1"></span>לשמ, *meshel,* and also a taunt, so Jeremiah
says in this place, that they would be a *hissing,* as he has spoken of
the shaking of the head.

<span id="xii.xviii-p12"></span>And lastly he adds, that they would be a
*reproach* even to all nations, for all would deem them worthy of their
calamities, however grievous they were, when a comparison would be made
between their iniquities and God’s vengeance. The reason follows,
*because they hearkened not to God* But I cannot now finish.

<span id="xii.xix"></span>

<span id="xii.xix-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xii.xix-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast
given so remarkable a proof both of thy wrath and of thy paternal
kindness in thy dealings with thine ancient people, — O grant, that we

never doubt but that thou wilt be merciful to us when we sincerely turn
to thee; and as we are so prone to all evil, yea, and rush headlong into
it, and as our wickedness and hardness are so great, grant to us, we
pray thee, the spirit of meekness, that we may in all things submit
ourselves to thee, and thus render ourselves thy children, that we may
also find thee to be our Father in thine only-begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="xii.xx"></span>

<span id="xii.xx-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Twelfth

<span id="xii.xx-p2"></span><span id="xii.xx-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xx-p3"></span>The Prophet, after having denounced God’s
judgment on those who remained in their own country as well as on the
exiles, subjoins this reason, because they *hearkened not* to the word
of the Lord; and this was a most grievous sin. Though ignorance is no
excuse before God, for those who are without the Law must perish; yet
the servant who knew his Lord’s will and did it not, shall be beaten
with many stripes. And the more abundant God’s grace is in calling us to
the right way of salvation, the more base is our ingratitude when we
close our ears and disregard the concern and care which he manifests for
our salvation. Let us then know that nothing is less tolerable than the
rejection of the prophetic word.

<span id="xii.xx-p4"></span>And we must notice what follows, *which I
sent them by my servants the prophets* The Jews might have otherwise
objected and said, that they did not intend to be rebellious against
God, but that there were many contentions among the prophets. Lest,
then, they should seek an evasion by a pretense of this kind, he says
that the word, brought by his ministers and witnesses the prophets, was
worthy of no less reverence than if angels came down from heaven to
them. And this passage serves to shew the use of external doctrine,
which fanatical men despise, thinking the hidden word sufficient, that
is, whatever they may dream. But God thus proves the obedience of our
faith, while he rules us by the hand and labor of men. Whosoever then
rejects the faithful teachers of the word, shews that he is a despiser
of God himself. The meaning is, that God defines his word, not as an
oracle of any kind, but as the doctrine which has been deposited with
faithful teachers.

<span id="xii.xx-p5"></span>He afterwards adds, *rising up early and
sending* The metaphor is taken from men who are sedulous and diligent.
We indeed know that God never awakes and never changes place; but he
could not otherwise express his paternal care toward his people, as
though he had said, that he was sedulously engaged in admonishing them.
And thus the more inexcusable was rendered the sloth of the people; for
God hastened as it were to rise up early, as they who spare no labor,
but willingly deprive themselves of some portion of their sleep, that
they may complete their work or their journey. As God then manifested so
much diligence in securing the wellbeing of men, the more shameful is
the sloth of men, when they become deaf, or are not moved, but remain in
their indifference. It now follows, —

<span id="xii.xxi"></span>

<span id="xii.xxi-p1"></span><span id="xii.xxi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:20-21](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#020.md)<span
id="xii.xxi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxi-p2"></span>**20.** Hear ye therefore the word of the
LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to
Babylon:

<span id="xii.xxi-p3"></span>**20.** Et vos audite sermonem Jehovae
cuncta captivitas, quam misi Jerosolyma Babylonem;

<span id="xii.xxi-p4"></span>**21.** Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the
God of Israel, of Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of
Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will
deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he
shall slay them before your eyes;

<span id="xii.xxi-p5"></span>**21.** Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus
Israel, ad Achab filium Colaniah, et ad Zedechiam filium Maassiae,
prophetantes vobis in nomine meo mendacium, Ecce ego ponam eos *(vel,*
tradam) in manum Nebuehadnezer regis Babylonis; et percutiet eos coram
oculis vestris:

<span id="xii.xxi-p6"></span> 

<span id="xii.xxi-p7"></span><span id="xii.xxi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxi-p8"></span>Jeremiah announces a special prophecy, but
in confirmation of his former doctrine. His object is still the same, to
prevent the captives, as they had begun, to listen to flatteries, and to
make them feel assured that they were to bear their exile till the end
of seventy years. But he speaks here of three impostors; he connects two
of them together, and mentions the third by himself. He directs his
discourse especially to all the captives, for he deigned not to address
those who professed to be God’s enemies, and sold themselves as slaves
to the devil for the purpose of deceiving. It was therefore useless to
spend labor on them. But he addressed the whole people, and at the same
time foretold what would happen to these two false prophets, even Ahab
and Zedekiah. He calls one the son of Kolaiah, and the other the son of
Maaseiah; for Ahab was a name then in frequent use, and Zedekiah was a
name which, on account of the memory of a pious and godly king, was in
high esteem among the good. To prevent then any mistake, he mentioned
their fathers.

<span id="xii.xxi-p9"></span>The import of the prophecy is, that a
judgment would soon overtake them, as they would be killed by King
Nebuchadnezzar. They were in exile, but such madness had possessed them,
that they hesitated not to provoke the wrath of that tyrant whom they
knew to be cruel and bloody. Then Jeremiah declares, that as they thus
deceived the people, they would soon be punished, as Nebuchadnezzar
would slay them. There is yet no doubt but that Nebuchadnezzar had
regard to his own private advantage; for before they were brought before
him, he wished to allay every cause of tumult. As they ceased not to
encourage the hope of a speedy return, without some check, it could not
be otherwise but that frequent disturbances would arise. Therefore
Nebuchadnezzar, as it is usual with earthly kings, consulted his own
benefit. But he was in the meantime the servant of God; for those two
impostors who had promised a return to the people, were to be exposed to
contempt. Their death then disclosed their vanity, for it thereby
appeared that they were not sent by God. It is indeed true that God’s
faithful servants are often cruelly treated, nay, even slain by the
ungodly. But the case was different as to these two. For they were not
proved guilty of falsehood, because they happened to have unhappily
prophesied, but because they raised up a standard as it were, and said,
that the people would soon return to their own country; and hence it was
that they were slain. We then see that what would take place was not
without reason foretold by Jeremiah; for from their death it might have
been concluded, that whatever they had promised respecting the return of
the people, were mere fallacies; and they were slain even before the
time which they had predicted. We now perceive the meaning. We shall now
notice the words.

<span id="xii.xxi-p10"></span>He says, *Hear ye, the, whole captivity,
the word of Jehovah* He would have the Jews to be attentive, for if a
thousand impostors had been killed, yet their faith in falsehood would
never have been destroyed, had not Jeremiah prophesied before the time
what would take place. He then sits here as a judge; for though
Nebuchadnezzar ordered them to be killed, yet it appears evident that it
was ordained by God, and indeed for this end, that the people might
learn to repent. We hence see that Jeremiah was their judge; and
Nebuchadnezzar afterwards executed what God by the mouth of his servant
had pronounced as a judgment. This is the reason why he addressed his
words to the whole people.

<span id="xii.xxi-p11"></span>He yet at the same time adds, that they
had been *sent* by God, *whom I have sent, etc.* and he said this, in
order that they might not imagine that they went there by *chance* or by
adverse fortune, and that they might acknowledge that when they were
deprived of their own country, it was a just punishment for their sins.

<span id="xii.xxi-p12"></span><span id="xii.xxi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxi-p13"></span>By saying, *I will give* (or *deliver*)
*them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar,* the Prophet still more clearly
expresses what I have just said, that they would be thus slain by the
order of the king, because God had determined what was to be done to
them. And he assigns the cause of their death or mentions its author,
that the Jews might not fix their eyes on the king of Babylon. What had
Nebuchadnezzar in view? to preserve a peaceable kingdom; he saw the
danger of a tumult if he pardoned these two men, who had disturbed the
people. Lest, then, the Jews should look only on the design of the king,
God here sets before them another and a higher reason, even because they
*prophesied falsely* in his *name. A* clearer explanation follows, —

<span id="xii.xxii"></span>

<span id="xii.xxii-p1"></span><span id="xii.xxii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022.md)<span id="xii.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxii-p2"></span>**22.** And of them shall be taken up a
curse by all the captivity of Judah which *are* in Babylon, saying, The
LORD make thee like Zedekiah, and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon
roasted in the fire;

<span id="xii.xxii-p3"></span>**22** Et sumetur ab ipsis maledictio apud
omnem captivatem Jehjudah, quae ist in Babylone, dicendo, Statuat to
Jehova ut Zedechiam et sicut Achab, quos combussit rex Babylonis igni
*(vel,* ustalavit, *vel,* frixit *etiam, ut alii vertunt;* <span
id="xii.xxii-p3.1"></span>הלק *non tantum significat comburere, sed
ustulare, vel paulatim urere, quod idem est, sed Hieronymus vertit
fuisse frictos;)*

<span id="xii.xxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.xxii-p5"></span><span id="xii.xxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxii-p6"></span>Here we are to notice the circumstances;
for if Jeremiah had only spoken of their death, the Jews might still
have been doubtful whether he had delivered a prophecy; but when now is
added what kind of punishment was inflicted on them, Jeremiah points out
as by the finger what was as yet unknown, and even incredible. It might
indeed have happened to the captives that the king should order them to
be slain, but it could not have occurred to any man to suppose what
Jeremiah declares, that they would be *roasted*  <span
id="fr_219"></span>[220](#fn_219.md) *in the fire* We hence see that God
here obviates the evasions of perverse minds, so that there would be no
room for evading, when he specifies the very kind of death which they
were to undergo.

<span id="xii.xxii-p8"></span>But he says first, *Taken from them shall
be a curse,* that is, the form of cursing. Mentioned yesterday was <span
id="xii.xxii-p8.1"></span>הלא, *ale,* an oath; he puts down now <span
id="xii.xxii-p8.2"></span>הללק, *kolle;* and <span
id="xii.xxii-p8.3"></span>ללק, *koll,* is to curse. The meaning then is,
that they would become an exemplar of a curse to all the captives, who
would say, *May God make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab whom the king
of Babylon roasted* The cause of their death is again repeated; and the
Prophet did not without reason dwell on this, that he might turn away
the eyes of the people from the immediate cause, which was commonly
known, that is, that Nebuchadnezzar would not endure any tumults to be
raised in his dominions; that they might therefore acknowledge God to be
the author of this punishment, he says, —

<span id="xii.xxiii"></span>

<span id="xii.xxiii-p1"></span><span
id="xii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#023.md)<span id="xii.xxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxiii-p2"></span>**23.** Because they have committed
villany in Israel, and have commited adultery with their neighbours’
wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not
commanded them; even I know, and *am* a witness, saith the LORD.

<span id="xii.xxiii-p3"></span>**23.** Propterea quod fecerunt (*vel,*
patrarunt) flagitium in Israel, et scortati sunt cum uxoribus sociorum
suorum, et locuti sunt sermonem in nomine meo mendaciter; quod (*vel,*
quem sermonem) non mandaveram ipsis; ego autem sum cognitor et testis,
dicit Jehova.

<span id="xii.xxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="xii.xxiii-p5"></span><span id="xii.xxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxiii-p6"></span>We perceive why the Prophet mentions the
cause of their death; it was, that the Jews might regard the event, not
according to their own thoughts, but that they might feel assured that
God took vengeance on the impiety of those who had falsely pretended his
name. For we know that we always look here and there, and that when we
find an immediate cause, we neglect and esteem as nothing the judgments
of God. In order then to correct this evil, Jeremiah again repeats that
Zedekiah and Ahab were not punished by the king of Babylon, but by God
himself, *because they committed villany in Israel.* Some render, <span
id="xii.xxiii-p6.1"></span>הלבנ, *nubele,* enormity or abomination; but
I am disposed to render it villany, or turpitude, or filthiness.  <span
id="fr_220"></span>[221](#fn_220.md) *They,* then, *committed a filthy
thing* He afterwards specifies two kinds, that they *committed adultery
with the wives of their friends,* and that they *falsely prophesied in
the name of God*

<span id="xii.xxiii-p8"></span>By the first clause we see how great was
the stupidity of the people, for they did not consider what was the life
of those who pretended to be witnesses for God, as though they were
angels come down from heaven. Their wickedness might indeed have been
concealed; but there is no doubt but that the Jews were extremely
stupid, for they had willingly seized on the vain promises, which
afforded them gratification. As, then, they were anxious to return, and
wished to be restored to their own country as it were against the will
of God, and sought to break through all obstacles by the force of their
own obstinacy; it was a just punishment, that they were so blinded as
not to see what was yet sufficiently manifest, even that these vaunting
prophets were adulterers, and that the filthiness of their life was so
great, that it was certain that they had nothing divine or heavenly in
them.

<span id="xii.xxiii-p9"></span>Then there is another kind of evil added,
that they *prophesied falsely* in God’s name. This was an atrocious
crime; for as his truth is precious to God, so it is a sacrilege that he
cannot bear, when his truth is turned into falsehood. But as the minds
of them all were so corrupted, that no one would open his eyes, God
testifies, that though their adulteries might be unknown to the people,
that though their vanity in their false prophecies might not be
perceived, yet it was enough that he *knew and was a witness*

<span id="xii.xxiii-p10"></span>Now this passage is worthy of special
notice; for hypocrites, until they find that they are proved guilty
before men, fear nothing, nay, they haughtily exalt themselves, even
when things are justly laid to their charge. Since, then, the hardness
and dishonesty of hypocrites are so great, it is necessary to summon
them before God’s tribunal, that they may know that they may a hundred
times be acquitted by the world, and yet that this derogates nothing
from God’s judgment. It now follows —

<span id="xii.xxiv"></span>

<span id="xii.xxiv-p1"></span><span id="xii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:24-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024.md)<span
id="xii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxiv-p2"></span>**24.** *Thus* shalt thou also speak to
Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,

<span id="xii.xxiv-p3"></span>**24.** Et ad Semaiah Nehelamitem dices,
dicendo, (sic dices,)

<span id="xii.xxiv-p4"></span>**25.** Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts,
the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name
unto all the people that *are* at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of
Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying,

<span id="xii.xxiv-p5"></span>**25.** Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus
Israel, dicendo, Propterea quod tu misisti in nomine meo literas ad
totum populum, qui est Jerosolymae, et ad Zephaniam filium Maassiae, et
ad cunctos sacerdotes, dicendo,

<span id="xii.xxiv-p6"></span>**26.** The LORD hath made thee priest in
the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the
house of the LORD, for every man *that is* mad, and maketh himself a
prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.

<span id="xii.xxiv-p7"></span>**26.** Jehova posuit to (vel, constituit
to) sacerdotem pro Jehoiada sacerdote, ut sitis praefecti domus Jehovae
super omnem virum insanum (vel, arreptitium) et prophetantem, ut ponas
ipsum in carcem (alii vertunt, in cippum) et in compedes (vel, manicas,
quod aliis magis placet.)

<span id="xii.xxiv-p8"></span>**27.** Now therefore why hast thou not
reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?

<span id="xii.xxiv-p9"></span>**27.** Et tu quare non increpuisti
Jeremiam Anathotitem, qui prophetat vobis?

<span id="xii.xxiv-p10"></span> 

<span id="xii.xxiv-p11"></span><span id="xii.xxiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxiv-p12"></span>Here Jeremiah prophesies respecting a
third person, who had written a letter to the priests and to the whole
people against himself, and had expostulated with the chief priest and
with others, because Jeremiah had, with impunity, long exhorted the
people to bear their long exile. This is the import of the passage; but
as to his punishment we shall see what it was at the end of the chapter.
I did not wish to give the whole, because I cannot finish this prophecy
today. I have therefore taken the former part only, even that Shemaiah
had not only encouraged the people, as others did, to hope for a return,
and to raise a commotion, but had also scattered his poison at
Jerusalem, and had endeavored to load Jeremiah with ill-will, that he
might be slain as a false prophet, and an enemy to the public good, as
well as to the Law and the Temple.

<span id="xii.xxiv-p13"></span>*Thou shalt* then *say to* or *of*
*Shemaiah,* for <span id="xii.xxiv-p13.1"></span>לא, al, may be taken in
either sense.  <span id="fr_221"></span>[222](#fn_221.md) His crime is now
related, we shall hereafter see what his punishment was. His crime was,
that he *wrote* in God’s *name* Had he only been a fanner of cruelty, he
would have deserved no pardon; but his crime was doubled, for he dared
to pretend the authority of God, and to boast that he was as it were his
scribe, as though he had said that his letter had been dictated by the
Holy Spirit, that he had not spoken his own thoughts, or presumptuously,
but that God could not endure the liberty given to Jeremiah; for though
he continually preached of long exile, yet the chief-priest suffered
him, and no one of the whole priestly order opposed him; and at the same
time he blames the people for their indulgence. That he did all this in
God’s name was far more grievous than if he had written as a private
individual. And it is said that he had written to the whole people, even
in order that they might all in a body unite against Jeremiah. For, had
he written only to the priests, they might have objected that they were
not at liberty to act so violently against Jeremiah, as sedition might
be raised. We hence see the craft of this base man; though he despised
the people, yet that all of them, even the least, might help the priests
to do this act of cruelty, and that there might be the union of all, he
included the whole people in his letter.

<span id="xii.xxiv-p15"></span><span id="xii.xxiv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxiv-p16"></span>He afterwards mentioned *the priest* and
*all the priests* The word *priest,* in the singular number, meant the
high-priest: then the *priests* were not only those descended from
Aaron, but all the Levites. There was the high-priest, and then the
descendants of Aaron were the chief, and, as it were, the colleagues of
the high priest; but the Levites were an inferior order, though here by
the priests he means also the Levites.

<span id="xii.xxiv-p17"></span><span id="xii.xxiv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxiv-p18"></span>Here follows the subject of the letter,
*Jehovah hath made thee a priest, etc*. Here the impostor Shemaiah
accuses the high-priest of ingratitude, because he had been chosen in
the place of another. For it is probable that Jehoiada was still living,
but that he had been led away into Chaldea with the other exiles. As
then so high a dignity had, beyond hope, and before the time, come to
the high-priest, the false prophet reproves him, because he did not
rightly acknowledge this favor of God, as though he had said, that he
was rendering an unworthy reward to God, who had raised him to that high
station: God, he said, *hath made thee a priest in the place of Jehoiada
the priest* Thus the ministers of Satan transform themselves into angels
of light; and yet they cannot so dexterously imitate God’s servants, but
that their deceit makes itself presently known; for craftiness is very
different from a right and prudent counsel. God endues his servants with
counsel and wisdom; but Satan, with craft and guile. Though, then, at
the first view, some artifice appears in this letter of the false
prophet, yet we may gather from its contents, that he falsely pretended
the name of God, that he falsely alleged that the chief priest was
chosen in the place of Jehoiada. *That ye should be,* he says: at first
he addresses the high-priest, but now he includes also *others, that ye
should be the keepers,* or the rulers *of the house of God*  <span
id="fr_222"></span>[223](#fn_222.md) For though the chief power was in the
high-priest, yet as he could not alone undertake everything, it was
necessary for him to have others connected with him. This is the reason
why Shemaiah not only says that the high-priest was a ruler in the
Temple of God, but after having placed him in the highest honor,
mentions also others.

<span id="xii.xxiv-p21"></span>He says *against every man* that is
*mad;* so <span id="xii.xxiv-p21.1"></span>עגשמ, *meshego,* is rendered
by Jerome, and I think not unsuitably; for the word means properly one
that is insane: but this was applied to false teachers, because they
boasted that they were under a divine impulse, when they spoke their own
thoughts. This appears evident from the ninth chapter of Hosea, where it
is said that the people would at length acknowledge that the prophets,
who had flattered them, were insane, and that the men of the Spirit were
mad. The Prophet conceded to them both names, that they were prophets
and men of the Spirit, that is, spiritual; but he proved that they had
only the names and not the reality: for prophets were called spiritual
men, because God inspired them with his Spirit; but the ungodly, when
they wished to revile the true prophets, called them mad. So did they
speak who were with Jehu, when a prophet came to anoint him, “What means
this mad fellow?” this word <span id="xii.xxiv-p21.2"></span>עגשמ,
*meshego,* is what they used; and they called him in contempt mad, who
had yet spoken by the secret impulse of the Spirit. (<span
id="xii.xxiv-p21.3"></span>[2Ki
9:11](../../../bib/kjv/kg2009.htm#011.md)<span
id="xii.xxiv-p21.3"></span>.) So, in like manner, do the ungodly rave in
contempt of God against everything found in Scripture.  <span
id="fr_223"></span>[224](#fn_223.md)

<span id="xii.xxiv-p24"></span>But as it has been already stated, it was
necessary to distinguish between the true servants of God and those only
in name; for many boasted that they were called by God, and yet were
impostors. God then called these mad and insane; but what did the
ungodly do? they transferred the reproach to the lawful servants of God.
So, in this place, Shemaiah says, that Jeremiah was mad, who falsely
pretended the name of God, and prophesied falsely.

<span id="xii.xxiv-p25"></span>He adds, *That thou shouldest put him in
prison,* or cast him into prison or the stocks, as some render the word.
Then he says, *in manacles,* that is, thou shouldest bind him, until his
impiety be known, so that thou mayest detain him in prison.  <span
id="fr_224"></span>[225](#fn_224.md) It is, indeed, probable that the chief
priests had assumed this power during the disordered state of things.
This proceeding no doubt resulted from a good principle; for God ever
designed that his Church should be well governed: he therefore commanded
in his Law, that when any dispute or question arose, the chief priest
was to be the judge, (<span id="xii.xxiv-p26.2"></span>[Deut.
17:8](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#009)<span id="xii.xxiv-p26.2"></span>;.md)
but when mention is here made of prison and of manacles, it: was an act,
no doubt, beyond the Law. It is therefore probable that it was added to
the Law of God when the state of things was in disorder and confusion
among the Jews. And whence was the origin of the evil? from the
ignorance and sloth of the priests. They ought to have been the
messengers of the God of hosts, the interpreters of the Law, the truth
ought to have been sought from their mouth; but they were dumb dogs,
nay, they had so degenerated, that nothing priestly was found in them;
they had forgotten the Law, there was no religion in them. As then they
had neglected their office, it was necessary to choose other prophets:
and as we have said elsewhere, it was as it were accidental that God
raised up prophets from the common people. There was, indeed, a
necessity of having prophets always in the ancient Church; but God would
have taken them from the Levites, except that he designed to expose them
to reproach before the whole people, when he made prophets even of
herdsmen, as in the case of Amos.

<span id="xii.xxiv-p27"></span>As then the priests suffered the
prophetic office to be transferred to the common people, a new way was
devised, that it might, not be any loss to them, as under the Papacy;
for we know that bishops are for no other reason made rulers in the
Church, but that there might be pastors and teachers. For of what use
could these asses be, whom we know to be for the most part destitute of
any learning? What could these men do, who are profane, and given up to
their own pleasures and enjoyments? In short, what could gamesters and
panders do? for such are almost all the Papal bishops. It was therefore
necessary to give up their office to brawling monks, “You shall teach,
for we resign to you the pulpits.” But, at the same time, they retained
the power of judgment in their own hands: when any controversy arose,
neither the noisy brawlers nor the dumb beasts could of themselves
decide anything; for ignorance prevented the latter, and power was
wanting to the former. How, then, did the bishops formerly condemn
heretics? and how do they condemn them still? Why, thus: When one was a
Carmelite, they called in the Franciscans; and when one was an
Augustinian, the Dominicans were summoned. For, as I have said, these
mute animals had no knowledge nor wisdom. And yet a certain dignity was
maintained by the bishops or their vicars, when they pronounced sentence
in condemning heretics. And such was probably the case among the ancient
people; for those who pretended to be prophets were summoned, and that
by the authority of the high-priest, under the pretext of law, but not
without some corruption added to it; for God had not given fetters and
manacles to the priests, that they might thus restrain those who might
create disturbance and corrupt the pure truth. But what remains I shall
defer to the next Lecture.

<span id="xii.xxv"></span>

<span id="xii.xxv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="xii.xxv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since we are
prone to what is false, and wholly devoted to vanity, we may be governed
by thy Spirit, and desire no other thing than to be obedient to thee;
and as we offer ourselves to thee, as thy disciples, grant that having
the light of thy word shining before us, we may follow the way which
thou shewest to us, and thus persevere in a right course, until we shall
at length come to that blessed rest which is prepared for us in heaven,
through Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="xii.xxvi"></span>

<span id="xii.xxvi-p1"></span>Lecture One Hundred and Thirteenth

<span id="xii.xxvi-p2"></span>We saw in the last Lecture the substance
of the letter which Shemaiah had written to the chief priest. He
reproved him for his neglect, because he did not silence Jeremiah
according to the right and duty of his office. This had a plausible
appearance; but it was a false principle which he assumed, — that
Jeremiah falsely pretended God’s name, and was not sent, and had no
command to prophesy;  <span id="fr_225"></span>[226](#fn_225.md) this was
false. Justly then does the Prophet now oppose him, and pronounce the
punishment which he deserved. It then follows, —

<span id="xii.xxvii"></span>

<span id="xii.xxvii-p1"></span><span
id="xii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:28-29](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#028.md)<span
id="xii.xxvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxvii-p2"></span>**28.** For therefore he sent unto us
*in* Babylon, saying, This *captivity is* long: build ye houses, and
dwell *in them;* and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

<span id="xii.xxvii-p3"></span>**28.** Nempe quia misit (vel, quia ideo,
ad verbum, quia ob id, vel, propterea) ad nos in Babylonem, dicendo,
Longum est (tempus exilii,) aedificate domos et habitate, plantate
hortos et comedite fractum eorum.

<span id="xii.xxvii-p4"></span>**29.** And Zephaniah the priest read
this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.

<span id="xii.xxvii-p5"></span>**29.** Legerat autem Zephania epistolam
hanc in auribus Jeremiae prophetae.

<span id="xii.xxvii-p6"></span> 

<span id="xii.xxvii-p7"></span><span id="xii.xxvii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxvii-p8"></span>The crime ascribed to Jeremiah was, —
that he rendered the captives indifferent, so that they cast off every
hope of deliverance, and disregarded their own country. But the design
of Jeremiah was far different; it was, that the people might not by too
much haste anticipate the promises of God, and that he might also extend
their hope to the end, prefixed. As there are two causal particles here
found, <span id="xii.xxvii-p8.1"></span>ןכ-לע יכ, *ki ol-ken,* some give
this rendering, “For for this cause,” that is, because he claimed the
name of a Prophet. The simpler meaning however is, that he gives a
reason why Shemaiah blamed the neglect of the priest, even because he
(Jeremiah) had habituated the captives to bear their exiles. But he
reproached the holy man, as though he had made them indifferent through
long delay. Jeremiah had indeed said that the time would be long; but
this particular phrase, *It is long,* means a different thing, as though
Jeremiah wished to bury in oblivion the hope of a return, because it
would have been foolish to languish so long.

<span id="xii.xxvii-p9"></span><span id="xii.xxvii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxvii-p10"></span>It follows, *And Zephaniah had read,
etc* The past perfect tense is more suitable here, for the verse ought
to be put in a parenthesis. The Prophet obviates a doubt which might
have been entertained. He then shews how the prophecy was made known to
him; he was one of the hearers when the letter was read. And it is
probable that the priest called Jeremiah on purpose, that he might be
proved guilty by his own accuser. However this may have been, he wished
to expose the holy man to the hatred of the people, or rather to their
fury. The constancy of Jeremiah was worthy of greater praise, while he
boldly reproved the arrogance of them all, who had nothing else in view
but to suppress God’s truth by force and tyranny.

<span id="xii.xxviii"></span>

<span id="xii.xxviii-p1"></span><span
id="xii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
29:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#030.md)<span
id="xii.xxviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxviii-p2"></span>**30.** Then came the word of the LORD
unto Jeremiah, saying,

<span id="xii.xxviii-p3"></span>**30.** Et fuit sermo Jehovae ad
Jeremiam, dicendo,

<span id="xii.xxviii-p4"></span>**31.** Send to all them of the
captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the
Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent
him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie:

<span id="xii.xxviii-p5"></span>**31.** Mitte ad totam captivitatem,
dicendo, Sic dicit Jehova de Semaiah Nehelamita, Propterea quod
prophetavit vobis Semaiah, cum ego non miserim ipsum, et confidere vos
fecit super mendacio;

<span id="xii.xxviii-p6"></span>**32.** Therefore thus saith the LORD;
Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall
not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the
good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath
taught rebellion against the LORD.

<span id="xii.xxviii-p7"></span>**32.** Ideo sic dicit Jehova, Ecce ego
visitans (id est, visitabo) super Semaiah Nehelamitam, et super semen
ejus, non erit illi vir, qui habitet in medio populi hujus, et non
videbit bonum quod ego faciam populo meo, dicit Jehova, quia aversionem
(vel, defectionem) loquutus est contra Jehovam.

<span id="xii.xxviii-p8"></span> 

<span id="xii.xxviii-p9"></span><span id="xii.xxviii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxviii-p10"></span>Jeremiah distinctly declares that this
impostor would not escape unpunished, because he had dared falsely to
pretend the name of God, and avowedly opposed Jeremiah. Here, then, the
Prophet makes no long discourse, but on the contrary simply declares by
the power of the Spirit what would take place. He speaks in God’s name,
for he had been sent as a herald to proclaim this judgment. This, then,
is the reason why he is so brief; for there was to be no dispute, though
the impostor on the other hand was carrying himself very high, and
hesitated not to overthrow the revealed truth of God, which had been
confirmed by many witnesses.

<span id="xii.xxviii-p11"></span>The sum of what is stated is, that
Shemaiah would not see the favor of God, and that none of his seed would
remain alive. It was a curse under the Law, as it is well known, that
one should have no seed left. (<span id="xii.xxviii-p11.1"></span>[De
28:18](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#018.md)<span
id="xii.xxviii-p11.1"></span>.) Jeremiah then denounces on Shemaiah this
punishment, that no one of his seed would remain alive, but that he
would die childless; and then he excludes him from the enjoyment of the
benefit which the Lord had determined to bestow on his people. He wished
to return after two years to his own country; Jeremiah commanded the
people patiently to endure their exile to the end of seventy years,
which was the time of their deliverance. As, then, Shemaiah despised the
lawful time, he was deprived of the favor of seeing that event.

<span id="xii.xxviii-p12"></span>Added then is the reason; first,
because he had abused the name of God; he *prophesied* and *I had not
sent him,* said the Lord; the second reason was, that he deceived the
people with a vain hope; falsehood of itself is worthy of a heavy
punishment; but when it was pernicious to God’s people, it became still
more heinous, and therefore worthy of a twofold punishment.

<span id="xii.xxviii-p13"></span>Now we see that Jeremiah esteemed as
nothing that he was condemned by Shemaiah; for he retained his own
dignity; though the impostor attempted to subvert his authority, yet the
Prophet speaks as though he was wholly unstained and not hurt nor
affected by any calumny. The same magnanimity of mind is what all
faithful teachers ought to possess, so as to look down, as from on high,
on all deceivers, and their chatterings, and curses, and to go on in
their course, however insolently the despisers of God may rise up
against them, and tear and overwhelm them with reproaches. Let then all
those who seek to serve God and his Church follow this example of the
Prophet, so that they may not be discouraged in their minds when they
find that they have to contend with dishonest men.

<span id="xii.xxviii-p14"></span>But Jeremiah is bidden to write to all
the captives, for Shemaiah was not worthy of being reproved; but God had
a regard for the public safety of the exiles, and reminded them of what
would take place. It is indeed probable that this prophecy was without
any fruit, until it was known by the event itself that Jeremiah had not
without reason thus prophesied. Until, then, Shemaiah died, and died
without any to succeed him, the people disregarded what had been
predicted; but at length they were constrained to acknowledge that
Jeremiah had not spoken his own thought, but had been furnished with a
message from God; for God really fulfilled what he had predicted by the
mouth of his Prophet.

<span id="xii.xxviii-p15"></span>The two reasons follow, why God
resolved to punish Shemaiah: the first is, that he had seized on the
prophetic office without a call; and hence we conclude, according to
what has already appeared, that this office which had been instituted by
God, was perverted, when any one intruded into it without a commission.
Let us then know that no one ought to be deemed a legitimate teacher,
except he can really shew that he has been called from above. I have in
several places stated that two things belonged to a call; the inward
call was the chief thing when the state of the Church was in disorder,
that is, when the priests neglected the duty of teaching, and wholly
departed from what their office required. When, therefore, the Church
became disordered, God applied an extraordinary remedy by raising up
prophets. But when the Church is rightly and regularly formed, no one
can boast that he is a pastor or a minister, except he is also called by
the suffrages of men. But as I have spoken on this subject more at large
on the twenty-third chapter, I only slightly refer to it now.

<span id="xii.xxviii-p16"></span>As to the present passage in which God
condemns Shemaiah for having thrust in himself without being called,
what is meant is, that he brought forward his own dreams, having been
furnished with no commission; for the prophetic office was then special.
Then Shemaiah is here rejected as an impostor, because he had only
brought forward prophecies suggested by his own brains, which yet he
falsely pretended to have been from God; and it was a most atrocious
crime, as it was a sacrilege to abuse, as Shemaiah did, the name of God.
But the atrocity of his sin the Prophet still further sets forth, by
saying that his prophecies were pernicious and fatal to the people. We
hence conclude how solicitous God was for the safety of his people, in
thus avenging the falsehoods which were calculated to lead them to ruin;
and Jeremiah shews that Shemaiah’s teaching was ruinous, because he
inebriated the people with false confidence; *he made you,* he says, *to
trust in falsehood;* for he promised them a quick return, when it was
God’s will, that the Jews should patiently bear their exile till the end
of the seventy years.

<span id="xii.xxviii-p17"></span><span id="xii.xxviii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxviii-p18"></span>But we may deduce from this passage a
useful doctrine, — that nothing is more pestiferous in a Church than for
men to be led away by a false confidence or trust. For it is the
foundation of all true religion to depend on the mouth or word of God;
and it is also the foundation of our salvation. As, then, the salvation
of men as well as true religion is founded on faith and the obedience of
faith; so also when we are drawn away to some false trust, the whole of
true religion falls to the ground, and at the same time every hope of
salvation vanishes. This ought to be carefully observed, so that we may
learn to embrace that doctrine which teaches us to trust in no other
than in the only true God, and reject all those inventions which may
lead us away from him, even in the least degree, so that we may not look
around us nor be carried here and there.

<span id="xii.xxviii-p19"></span>For this reason, as I have said, the
Prophet declares that Shemaiah would die childless, and be precluded
from enjoying the favor which God had resolved and even promised to
bestow on his people. And all this, as I have reminded you, was said for
the sake of the people; for this prophecy did no good to Shemaiah nor to
his posterity; but his punishment ought to have benefited the miserable
exiles so as to lead them to repentance, however late it may have been.
This is the import of the passage.

<span id="xii.ii-p8"></span> So it is rendered by the Sept., Vulg., and
Targ.; but “epistle,” or letter, by the Syr. The word properly means a
narrative; but as that is included in a book or in a letter, it is often
used for both. It is rendered “book” in our version in <span
id="xii.ii-p8.1"></span>[Ex 24:7](../../../bib/kjv/exo024.htm#007.md)<span
id="xii.ii-p8.1"></span>; and “letter” in <span

id="xii.ii-p8.3"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p9"></span> Rather, “old men;” literally it is, “to the
remainder of the aged of the transmigration.” Age, and not authority,
seems to be intended, though Grotins thinks they were the members of the
Sanhedrim. The word commonly rendered “captivity,” and when a verb, “to
lead captive,” means properly to be removed, to migrate, and
transitively, to remove, to carry away, to transfer, to translate. The
idea of captivity is not included in it, though sometimes implied. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[203](cc19011.htm#fr_202.md) <span
id="xii.ii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p10"></span> Here in the original ends the preceding
Lecture; but as this chapter has no connection with the foregoing, the
prayer which occurs here has been removed to the end of the last
chapter. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[204](cc19011.htm#fr_203.md) <span
id="xii.ii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xii.ii-p12"></span> The Targ. has “scribes;” the Sept. and
Syr., “false prophets;” and the Vulg., “prophets.” They were probably
teachers, and not those higher prophets who were favored with visions,
and sent forth by God to deliver special messages. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[205](cc19011.htm#fr_204.md) <span
id="xii.iii-p7.2"></span>

<span id="xii.iii-p8"></span> Rendered “governess” or lady — “domina,”
by the Vulg.; but “queen” by the Sept., the Syr., and the Targ. It was a
title most commonly given to the queen-mother. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[206](cc19011.htm#fr_205.md) <span
id="xii.iii-p8.2"></span>

<span id="xii.iii-p9"></span> The Versions have “eunuchs,” but the
Targ., “princes.” The word means an officer or an attendant on a
sovereign. It is rendered “officer” in <span
id="xii.iii-p9.1"></span>[Ge
37:36](../../../bib/kjv/gen037.htm#036.md)<span id="xii.iii-p9.1"></span>;
and “chamberlain” in <span id="xii.iii-p9.2"></span>[Es
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/est002.htm#003.md)<span id="xii.iii-p9.2"></span>.
That such officers were often eunuchs there can be no doubt, but the
word does not designate such a thing. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[207](cc19011.htm#fr_206.md) <span
id="xii.iii-p9.4"></span>

<span id="fn_207"></span>[208](cc19011.htm#fr_207.md) <span
id="xii.v-p7.2"></span>

<span id="xii.v-p8"></span> To, “seek the peace of the city” was, no
doubt, to promote it by their efforts, to be careful in preserving it.
To “seek the land,” in <span id="xii.v-p8.1"></span>[De
11:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu011.htm#012.md)<span id="xii.v-p8.1"></span>,
was to care for it; “not to seek the day,” in <span
id="xii.v-p8.2"></span>[Job 3:4](../../../bib/kjv/job003.htm#004.md)<span
id="xii.v-p8.2"></span>, was not to regard it. Hence, to “seek the peace
of the city,” was to care for, or regard it, so as to do everything to
promote it. It is said of Mordecai that he was “seeking the wealth
(rather, the good) of his people.” (<span id="xii.v-p8.3"></span>[Es
10:3](../../../bib/kjv/est010.htm#003)<span id="xii.v-p8.3"></span>.md) His
whole conduct was a proof of this. To “seek one’s hurt,” as in <span
id="xii.v-p8.4"></span>[Ps 38:12](../../../bib/kjv/psa038.htm#012.md)<span
id="xii.v-p8.4"></span>, was not to pray for it, but to use all means to
effect it. Therefore the first sense given by Calvin is the right one. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[209](cc19011.htm#fr_208.md) <span
id="xii.v-p10.2"></span>

<span id="xii.v-p11"></span> It is literally, “whom I have removed,” or
transplanted; “moved from home,” is the Sept.; “transferred,” the Vulg.;
“made to migrate,” the Targ. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[210](cc19011.htm#fr_209.md) <span
id="xii.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="xii.vii-p6"></span> To pray for the peace of a city or
country, and for the health or eternal salvation of rulers, is very
different from wishing success to their ambitious, rapacious, or
sanguinary undertakings; though this distinction is not generally
attended to.” — *Scott*.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[211](cc19011.htm#fr_210.md) <span
id="xii.viii-p10.3"></span>

<span id="xii.viii-p11"></span> All the ancient versions, and the Targ.
too, render this clause, “Your dreams which ye dream.” To dream a dream
is a common phraseology in Hebrew. There is no instance of the noun here
for dreams, in which it means dreamers, as Blayney renders it; the
marginal reading in our version in <span id="xii.viii-p11.1"></span>[Jer
27:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#009.md)<span id="xii.viii-p11.1"></span>,
is no doubt correct, as the word is in every other passage rendered
“dreams;” and the word is in another form when it means “dreamers,” see
<span id="xii.viii-p11.2"></span>[Ps
126:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa126.htm#001.md)<span
id="xii.viii-p11.2"></span>. The last word is not found but here in the
Hiphil form; but this form has not invariably a causative meaning, nor
does it seem to have it here. Then the clause would be, “neither attend
to your dreams which you are dreaming.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[212](cc19011.htm#fr_211.md) <span
id="xii.x-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p7"></span> The words literally are, “When at the mouth
(or extremity) of fillings (or, of fulfilments) in Babylon shall be
seventy years,” etc., that is, when seventy years shall be completed,
the whole number or measure being filled up. Blayney’s version is,
“Surely when seventy years have been completed at Babylon.” But <span
id="xii.x-p7.1"></span>יכ here is not rendered “surely,” but “when,” by
the Targ. and the ancient versions. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_212"></span>[213](cc19011.htm#fr_212.md) <span
id="xii.x-p12.1"></span>

<span id="xii.x-p13"></span> The Vulg. is the same, “<span
id="xii.x-p13.1"></span>suscitabo — I will awaken,” etc.; and so the
Sept. and the Targ.; but the Syr. is, “I will ratify,” or confirm. The
primary meaning of <span id="xii.x-p13.2"></span>םק is to rise, and in
Hiphil, as here, to cause to rise, that is, to rouse, to awaken; its
secondary meaning is, to stand, and in Hiphil, to cause to stand, that
is, to ratify or confirm. The first idea is the most striking: the word
of promise was as it were lying down and dormant for seventy years, and
now it was to be roused up: “I will rouse up for you the very word of
mine, the good.” This is the literal rendering, except we take the
secondary meaning of the verb, which is also very suitable, “I will
ratify for you,” etc. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_213"></span>[214](cc19011.htm#fr_213.md) <span
id="xii.xi-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xi-p14"></span> The word for “thoughts” might often be
rendered “purposes,” as it is sometimes in our version. The thoughts of
God are his purposes. So here: “For I — I know the very purposes which I
am purposing respecting you, saith Jehovah, — purposes of peace and not
for evil, to restore you to this place.” God, in saying, “to this
place,” represented himself as dwelling at Jerusalem, in the temple,
where he had promised his presence.

<span id="xii.xi-p15"></span>In mentioning purposes and not purpose, the
intention probably was to shew its firmness and certainty. The Hebrews
sometimes used the plural number in order to enhance the meaning, as
“wisdoms” for perfect wisdom, in <span id="xii.xi-p15.1"></span>[Pr
9:1](../../../bib/kjv/pro009.htm#001.md)<span id="xii.xi-p15.1"></span>.
Then the meaning of the word would be, “the very sure purpose;” and in a
version, the meaning, and not the word literally, ought to be given. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[215](cc19011.htm#fr_214.md) <span
id="xii.xi-p19.2"></span>

<span id="xii.xi-p20"></span> These two words are omitted in the Sept.;
“the end and patience,” is the Vulg.; “the end and hope,” the Targ.;
“the hope,” only, the Syr. It is better to retain the words apart than
to unite them, as many have done: “the end” was that of their troubles
and exile, and “the expectation” was that of a return to their own
country, — two things completely distinct though cotemporaneous: “To
give you the end (of your exile) and the expectation (of a return,)”
that is, the fulfillment of it. It is a metonymy, expectation is put for
its object, or the thing expected. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[216](cc19011.htm#fr_215.md) <span
id="xii.xiv-p7.2"></span>

<span id="xii.xiv-p8"></span> The two first verbs are wanting in the
Sept. and the Targ., and the second in the Syr. The Vulg. is according
to our version, which is literally the Hebrew: and there are no various
readings. It is difficult to understand the meaning here of the second
verb, go, or proceed. Some give this meaning, “And ye shall call upon me
and shall go to your country; and ye shall pray to me, and I will
hearken to you.” But the sense most suitable appears to be the
following, — “And ye shall call on me, and ye shall go on and intercede
with me, and I will hearken to you.” The verb <span
id="xii.xiv-p8.1"></span>ךלה is used in the sense of advancing or of
going on in a course that is begun. See <span
id="xii.xiv-p8.2"></span>[Ge
26:13](../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#013.md)<span id="xii.xiv-p8.2"></span>;
<span id="xii.xiv-p8.3"></span>[Ex
19:19](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#019.md)<span id="xii.xiv-p8.3"></span>.
To “intercede for themselves and others, was more than to call upon God.
From calling they would go on to intercede, earnestly to plead for
themselves and others, and then the promise is that God would hear them.
— *Ed*

<span id="fn_216"></span>[217](cc19011.htm#fr_216.md) <span
id="xii.xv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xv-p8"></span> The <span id="xii.xv-p8.1"></span>יכ here
is rendered “when” in our version, and in the ancient versions, except
the Sept., where it is; <span id="xii.xv-p8.2"></span>ὅτι, “for,” or
because. The most usual meaning of the particle is “because;” and it may
be so rendered here; for sincerity may be justly assigned as a reason
why prayers are heard, without the implication of any merit. Indeed, in
the very nature of things, prayer without sincerity cannot possibly be
accepted.

<span id="xii.xv-p9"></span>In our version the meaning of the two verbs
is reversed; the first ought rather to be rendered as meaning “to search
for,” and the latter to “seek.” With the first is connected “finding,”
and this implies searching, and the verb <span
id="xii.xv-p9.1"></span>שקב means sometimes to search for what is lost.
The verse should be, — “And ye shall search for me and ye shall find me,
because ye shall seek me with all your heart.” To seek God means to seek
his favor. They would search for him whom they had, as it were, lost,
and they would find him because they would seek his favor with all
sincerity; it would not be for a mercenary purpose, but for the sake of
enjoying God’s favor. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_217"></span>[218](cc19011.htm#fr_217.md) <span
id="xii.xvi-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xvi-p12"></span> The order found in this deserves notice;
restoration is mentioned first, and then the means necessary for the
purpose, the gathering of the people from all places; “I will restore
your captivity,” or captives, “and I will gather,” etc. The concluding
sentence is, “where I have removed you from there;” where, and from
there, instead of whence. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[219](cc19011.htm#fr_218.md) <span
id="xii.xvii-p10.2"></span>

<span id="xii.xvii-p11"></span> Gataker approves of this and says,
evidently referring to Calvin, “So an interpreter of prime note
rendereth it.” That <span id="xii.xvii-p11.1"></span>יכ is sometimes an
iliative is generally admitted; and here the connection cannot otherwise
be seen. There is a large gap after the 15th verse (<span
id="xii.xvii-p11.2"></span>[Jer
29:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#015.md)<span
id="xii.xvii-p11.2"></span>) in the Sept., the verses 16, 17, 18, 19,
and 20 (<span id="xii.xvii-p11.3"></span>[Jer
29:16-20](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#016.md)<span
id="xii.xvii-p11.3"></span>), are omitted, but not in the other versions
nor in the Targ.; and Blayney has thereby been led to put the 15th verse
out of its place and set it between the 20th and the 21st, but without
sufficient reason. The connection, as shewn by Calvin, is suitable as
the verse now is, and by removing it, the drift of what follows is not
so clearly seen.

<span id="xii.xvii-p12"></span>Another thing advanced by Blayney, though
countenanced by Houbigant and Horsley, two rival innovators, is not to
be admitted, — that the letter terminates at the end of the 20th verse
(<span id="xii.xvii-p12.1"></span>[Jer
29:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#020.md)<span
id="xii.xvii-p12.1"></span>), and not at the end of the 23d (<span
id="xii.xvii-p12.2"></span>[Jer
29:23](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#023.md)<span
id="xii.xvii-p12.2"></span>), and that what follows forms another
letter. It is evident that what is contained in the 24th (<span
id="xii.xvii-p12.3"></span>[Jer
29:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#024.md)<span
id="xii.xvii-p12.3"></span>) and in the following verses to the end, was
written in consequence of an answer from Babylon to this letter. Compare
verse 5th (<span id="xii.xvii-p12.4"></span>[Jer
29:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005)<span id="xii.xvii-p12.4"></span>.md)
with the 28th (<span id="xii.xvii-p12.5"></span>[Jer
29:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#028.md)<span
id="xii.xvii-p12.5"></span>). — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[220](cc19011.htm#fr_219.md) <span
id="xii.xxii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxii-p7"></span> “Fried” is the word used by the Sept.,
the Vulg., the Syr., and the Targ. The Hebrew word is found as a verb in
no other passage, but as a participle applied to parched corn, <span
id="xii.xxii-p7.1"></span>[Le
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/lev002.htm#014.md)<span id="xii.xxii-p7.1"></span>;
<span id="xii.xxii-p7.2"></span>[Joshua
11](../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#000.md)<span id="xii.xxii-p7.2"></span>. —
*Ed*

<span id="fn_220"></span>[221](cc19011.htm#fr_220.md) <span
id="xii.xxiii-p6.2"></span>

<span id="xii.xxiii-p7"></span> “Iniquity” is the Sept.; “folly,” the
Vulg.; “crime” or offense, the Syr.; and “disgrace,” the Targ. Vileness,
or abomination, is its meaning. It is applied to the sin of
prostitution, <span id="xii.xxiii-p7.1"></span>[Ge
34:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen034.htm#007.md)<span id="xii.xxiii-p7.1"></span>,
— of stealing, <span id="xii.xxiii-p7.2"></span>[Jos
7:15](../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#015.md)<span id="xii.xxiii-p7.2"></span>,
— of murder, <span id="xii.xxiii-p7.3"></span>[Jud
20:6](../../../bib/kjv/jdg020.htm#006.md)<span id="xii.xxiii-p7.3"></span>,
— of sodomy, <span id="xii.xxiii-p7.4"></span>[Jud
19:24](../../../bib/kjv/jdg019.htm#024.md)<span
id="xii.xxiii-p7.4"></span>, — of incest, <span
id="xii.xxiii-p7.5"></span>[2Sa
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/sa2013.htm#012.md)<span
id="xii.xxiii-p7.5"></span>, — and of base ingratitude, <span
id="xii.xxiii-p7.6"></span>[1Sa
25:25](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#025.md)<span
id="xii.xxiii-p7.6"></span>. The most suitable term for all these places
is abomination, and not “folly,” as in our version. It means what is
hateful, vile, contemptible, or abominable. It refers here to what was
abominably filthy — adultery; and to what was abominably wicked and
presumptuous — speaking lies in God’s name. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_221"></span>[222](cc19011.htm#fr_221.md) <span
id="xii.xxiv-p13.2"></span>

<span id="xii.xxiv-p14"></span> He is called the “Nehelamite.” Some
render the word “a dreamer:” but, as Blayney observes, “the termination
speaks it to be a patronymic.” It refers probably to the place of his
birth. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[223](cc19011.htm#fr_222.md) <span
id="xii.xxiv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxiv-p19"></span> The Hebrew is, “that there might be
overseers in the house of Jehovah for every one,” etc. He was a priest
under the high-priest for this purpose. Zephaniah was second in
authority, as it appears from <span id="xii.xxiv-p19.1"></span>[Jer
52:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#024.md)<span
id="xii.xxiv-p19.1"></span>. He was probably the ruler or governor of
the Temple, as Pashur was, <span id="xii.xxiv-p19.2"></span>[Jer
20:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer020.htm#001.md)<span id="xii.xxiv-p19.2"></span>.
Hence the paraphrase of the Targum as to this clause, “That thou
mightest be made the chief of the priests in the house of the sanctuary
of the Lord for every one,” etc. Blayney thinks it probable that
Zephaniah succeeded a priest called Jehoiada, in that office, who had
been either deposed for bad conduct or carried away into exile. Gataker
and Grotins think that the reference is to Jehoiada the priest, the
zealous reformer in the reign of Jehoash, <span
id="xii.xxiv-p19.3"></span>[2Ki
11:1-12:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg2011.htm#001.md)<span
id="xii.xxiv-p19.3"></span>; and that Shemaiah’s object was to rouse
Zephaniah to shew similar zeal for the house of God. If so, here is an
instance, not uncommon, in which a good example of zeal was perverted
for the purpose of encouraging zeal in exercising tyranny and
suppressing the truth.

<span id="xii.xxiv-p20"></span>It is somewhat singular that all the
ancient versions, as well as the Targum, give “overseers,” or officers,
in the singular number; the Vulg. is, “That thou mightest be a
commander... over every one;” the Sept., “That thou mightest be an
umpire;” the Syr., “That thou mightest be a censor.” But there are no
MSS. in favor of such a reading. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[224](cc19011.htm#fr_223.md) <span
id="xii.xxiv-p21.4"></span>

<span id="xii.xxiv-p22"></span> The word <span
id="xii.xxiv-p22.1"></span>ענשמ is rendered “frantic” by the Sept., —
“mad,” by the Vulg., — “raving in lies,” by the Syr., — and “foolish,”
by the Targ. As applied to prophets it means one in an ecstasy, or in
raptures, whether true or false, — an enthusiast, but taken mostly in a
bad sense.

<span id="xii.xxiv-p23"></span>The next word is in Hithpael,
“self-prophesying,” or prophesying of himself, not made a prophet by
God; imperfectly rendered, “prophesying,” by the Sept., Vulg., and Syr.
It may be rendered “pretending to be a prophet.” — *Ed*.

<span id="xii.xxiv-p26"></span> The last word is found only here, and is
rendered “dungeon” by the Sept., and “prison” by the Vulg., Syr., and
Targ. The Samaritan version, says: Parkhurst, uses it as a verb in <span
id="xii.xxiv-p26.1"></span>[Ex
14:3](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#003.md)<span id="xii.xxiv-p26.1"></span>,
in the sense of confining, shutting up. The noun, therefore, may well
designate a prison. — *Ed*.

id="xii.xxvi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="xii.xxvi-p3"></span> The verb for prophesying is in Hithpael
as before; he still represents Jeremiah as one who made himself a
Prophet, — “Who of himself prophesies to you;” and not as Blayney
renders the clause, “Who giveth himself out as a Prophet among you.”
What he meant is, that what Jeremiah prophesied came from himself, the
very thing which God ascribed to the false prophets; thus wicked men
impute to the good the very sin of which they themselves are guilty. —
*Ed*.
