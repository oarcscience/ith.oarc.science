<span id="viii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 25

<span id="viii.i"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p1"></span><span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p2"></span>**1.** The word that came to Jeremiah
concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the
son of Josiah king of Judah, that *was* the first year of Nebuchadrezzar
king of Babylon;

<span id="viii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Sermo qui fuit ad Jeremiam, ad omnem
populum Jehudah (*sed* לע *accipitur etiam hic diverso sensu: sermo enim
directus fuit ad Jeremiam ut esset illius testis ac proeco, deinde ad
populum ut tandem perveniret ex ore Jeremioe ad omnes Judoeos quod uni
dictum* *fuerat*) anno quarto Joakim filii Josiae regis Jehudah: hic est
annus primus Nebuchadnezer regis Babel.

<span id="viii.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.i-p5"></span><span id="viii.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.i-p6"></span>his prophecy no doubt preceded the vision
which we have just explained, and which had just been presented to
Jeremiah when Jehoiakim died, and when Zedekiah reigned in the place of
Jeconiah; who, being the last king, was substituted for his nephew
Jeconiah. But related now is the prophecy which Jeremiah was bidden to
proclaim in the fourth year of Jehoiakim; and he reigned, as we shall
hereafter see, eleven years. We hence conclude that his book is composed
of various addresses, but that the order of time has not always been
preserved. Now the sum of the whole is, that when God found that the
people could not be amended and restored to a right mind by any
warnings, he denounced final ruin both on the Jews and on all the
neighboring nations: but why he included the heathens we shall hereafter
see.

<span id="viii.i-p7"></span>He then says, that this prophecy was
committed to him *in the fourth year of Jehoiakim;* and he adds, that
the same year was *the first of King Nebuchadnezar* This seems
inconsistent with other places, where the third of Jehoiakim is
mentioned for the fourth year; and hence a long time is allotted for the
first year of Nebuchadnezar. But a solution of this is not difficult, if
we consider that Nebuchadnezar suddenly returned into Chaldea to settle
his affairs at home, when the report of his father’s death was brought
to him; for he feared, lest in his absence a tumult should arise, as it
often happened. He was therefore anxious to secure his own affairs; and
having settled things at home, he brought Jehoiakim into subjection, and
in the fourth year of his reign he compelled him to open his treasures,
and also led away captive those whom he wished. And it was at this time
that Daniel and his companions were led away into exile, and the
precious vessels of the Temple were removed. As to the first year of
Nebuchadnezar’s reign, he reigned first with his father; and then when
he reigned alone, the beginning of a new reign is justly mentioned as
the first year. Though then he was made king, yet as he did not exercise
the chief power until his father’s death, it was not until that event
that he was really king; this is the reason why mention is made of his
first year. But we ought especially to notice what the Prophet says, —
that *the word came* to him, not for his own sake, but that he might be
the public herald of God. It now follows, —

<span id="viii.ii"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p1"></span><span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#002.md)<span id="viii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p2"></span>**2.** The which Jeremiah the prophet spake
unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
saying,

<span id="viii.ii-p3"></span>**2.** Quem sermonem protulit Jeremias
Propheta ad totum populum Jehudah, et ad omnes habitatores Jerosolymae,
dicendo.

<span id="viii.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.ii-p5"></span><span id="viii.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ii-p6"></span>He shews more clearly in this verse what he
had just said, — that he was not taught from above, that he might
suppress what he had heard, but that he might proclaim it as from the
mouth of God; and hence he gives himself the honorable title of a
Prophet, as though he had said, that he came furnished with the
indubitable commands of God, and was at the same time honored with the
office of a Prophet; and he came thus, that no one might dare despise
his doctrine. Now follows his sermon, —

<span id="viii.iii"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p1"></span><span id="viii.iii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#003.md)<span id="viii.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p2"></span>**3.** From the thirteenth year of Josiah
the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, that *is* the three
and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come unto me, and I have
spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.

<span id="viii.iii-p3"></span>**3.** A tertio decimo anno Josiae filii
Ammon regis Jehudah ad hunc diem, hic tertius et vicesimus annus est,
loquutus est Jehova ad me, et loquutus sum ad vos, surgens mane; et non
audistis:

<span id="viii.iii-p4"></span>**4.** And the LORD hath sent unto you all
his servants the prophets, rising early and sending *them*; but ye have
not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear.

<span id="viii.iii-p5"></span>**4.** Et misit Jehova ad vos omnes suos
servos Prophetas, mane surgens et mittens; et non audistis et non
inclinastis aurem vestram ad audiendum;

<span id="viii.iii-p6"></span>**5.** They said, Turn ye again now every
one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in
the land that the LORD hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever
and ever.

<span id="viii.iii-p7"></span>**5.** Dicendo, Revertimini agedum quisque
a via sua mala eta malitia operum vestrorum; et habitate super terram,
quam dedit Jehova vobis et patribus vestris a seculo et usque in seculum
(et quoe sequuntur.)

<span id="viii.iii-p8"></span> 

<span id="viii.iii-p9"></span><span id="viii.iii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p10"></span>Jeremiah now expostulates with the Jews,
because they had not only perfidiously departed from the true worship of
God, and despised the whole teaching of his Law, but because they had
shaken off the yoke, and designedly and even obstinately rejected all
warnings, being not moved by reproofs nor even by threatenings. He does
not then simply charge them with impiety and ingratitude, but adds the
sin of perverseness, that they were like untameable wild beasts, and
could by no means be corrected.

<span id="viii.iii-p11"></span>He says, *that from the thirteenth year
of Josiah king of Judah, to that year,* which was the *twenty-third
year,* he had not ceased faithfully to perform the office committed to
him, but had effected nothing. It hence appears how incorrigible was
their wickedness. We have seen, at the beginning of the book, that he
was called by God to be a Prophet in the thirteenth year of King Josiah;
and he had now been engaged in his calling, as he declares, for
twenty-three years.

<span id="viii.iii-p12"></span>He had spent his time in vain, he had
consumed much labor without any fruit. It is then no wonder that he now
accuses them of perverseness, and that in the name of God; for he pleads
not his own cause, but shews what the Jews deserved, considering how
much God had labored in reclaiming them, and that they had rejected all
his warnings and refused all his remedies. Then *from the thirteenth
year of Josiah,* he says, *to this day;* and afterwards in a parenthesis
he adds, that he had already discharged his office for twenty-three
years.

<span id="viii.iii-p13"></span>We learn that the Prophet spoke thus
seventeen years before the destruction of the City and Temple; for he
had accomplished forty years before the people were driven into exile,
and before they who thought themselves safe, miserably perished. He
continued to the death of Josiah; and afterwards about twenty-two
transpired; for Jehoiakim reigned eleven years; and without reckoning
the short time of Jeconiah, Mathaniah, called also Zedekiah, was in the
eleventh year removed, and disgracefully and reproachfully put to death.
Thus it appears that the Prophet constantly labored for forty years.

<span id="viii.iii-p14"></span>Hence, also, we learn how diabolical was
the madness of that people in rejecting so many admonitions. And if we
connect another thing, to which I lately referred, that they had been
taught by many examples, it will appear still more evident that the
disease of impiety as to that people was altogether incurable.

<span id="viii.iii-p15"></span>But this passage deserves special
attention; for we here learn that we ought immediately to return to God
when he invites us; for faith is known by its promptitude. As soon then
as God speaks, it behoves us to be attentive, so that we may immediately
follow him. But if God ceases not for a whole year to warn and exhort
us, while at the same time his doctrine is despised, we become guilty of
intolerable sin. Let us then remember that *days* are here in a manner
mentioned as well as *years,* that the Jews might consider how many days
are included in every year; and let us also know that years are
mentioned by Jeremiah, that they might, understand that they had no
excuse, inasmuch as God had for so long a time ceased not to promote
their welfare, while in the meantime they persisted in their impiety,
and continued obstinate to the last. This is the reason why the Prophet
relates again when it was that he began to discharge his prophetic
office, even from the thirteenth year of Josiah.

<span id="viii.iii-p16"></span>He then adds, that it was their own fault
that they had not repented; *spoken,* he says, *has Jehovah to me, and I
to you*. By saying that the word of God was deposited with him, he no
doubt intended to assert his authority against the unbelievers, who
clamored that he presumptuously pretended God’s name, and that he had
not been sent by God. For we have elsewhere seen that the Church was
then miserably torn, having intestine broils, and many were boasting
that they were prophets; and we shall hereafter find the same thing in
other places. Thus, then, Jeremiah was not received by the whole people,
and his authority was disputed. Since then he had to contend with many
ungodly men, he here testifies that he came not of himself, but that the
prophetic office had been committed to him.

<span id="viii.iii-p17"></span>After having asserted the authority of
his call, he adds, that he had faithfully promoted the welfare of the
whole people; for he declares how faithful and diligent he had been when
he says, that he had *spoken* and *rose up early;* for to rise up early
means that he had been assiduous in his work. The Prophet then shews
that he had not been tardy or idle, and that he had not spoken
carelessly as many do, who seem to do what God commands, but display no
fervid zeal and no sedulity. The Prophet then, after having declared
that he had been sent from above, adds that he had exercised fidelity
and diligence, that he had strenuously served God and his Church. *I
have spoken to you,* he says, *as the Lord had spoken to* me, — how?
*rising up early*

<span id="viii.iii-p18"></span><span id="viii.iii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="viii.iii-p19"></span>He then adds, I *have spoken, and ye
heard not* He complains here that his work had been useless, and at the
same time shews that the whole fault was in the people. He confirms the
same thing in other words, *Jehovah has sent to* you *all his servants
the prophets, rising. up early, etc* He enhances their sin, — that they
had not only rejected one Prophet but even many; for God had not
employed Jeremiah alone to teach them, but had joined others with him,
so that they were less excusable. We hence see that their sin is in this
verse exaggerated; for the Jews had not only despised God in the person
of one man, but had also rejected all his servants. He might, indeed,
have simply said, that God had sent his servants, but he adds the word
*prophets,* in order that their ingratitude might appear more evident.
It was, indeed, very wicked to neglect God’s servants; but as prophecy
was an invaluable treasure, and a singular pledge and symbol of God’s
favor, it was a double crime when they thus despised the prophets, whose
very name ought to have been held sacred by them.

<span id="viii.iii-p20"></span>He afterwards applies to God what he had
said of himself, *rising up early* It is certain that God does not rise
up, as he sleeps not in the night; but the language is much more
expressive and forcible, when God himself is said to rise up early. And
it, was not without reason that the Prophet spoke so emphatically; for
though the Jews were sufficiently convicted of ingratitude for having
disregarded God’s servants, it was yet a monstrous impiety to shew no
regard for God. But when the unbelieving are proved guilty, they ever
fix their eyes on men, “He! it is with a mortal that I have to do; far
be it from me ever to rise up against God; but why is this so much
blamed, since I do not immediately perish? since I am not suddenly cast
down at the nod of man? what! am I not free to inquire, and to discuss,
and to examine every part of what is said? why do the prophets so
imperiously treat us, that it is not lawful to doubt any of their
words?” Thus, then, did the ungodly speak. But God on the other hand
answered them and said, that he was despised, as also Christ said,

<span id="viii.iii-p21"></span>“He who hears you hears me,  
and he who despises you despises me.” (<span
id="viii.iii-p21.2"></span>[Lu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016.md)<span
id="viii.iii-p21.2"></span>)

<span id="viii.iii-p22"></span>So also the Prophet sets forth God
himself as rising up early, exhorting the people and manifesting every
care for their wellbeing. This, then, is the design of the metaphor,
when he says, that God had sent to them and rose up early; he rose up
early while sending his servants.

<span id="viii.iii-p23"></span>Now as God fulminates against all
despisers of his doctrine, so from these words we may gather no small
consolation; for we certainly conclude that God watches over our safety
whenever sound and faithful teachers go forth: it is the same as though
he himself descended from heaven, rose up early, and was intent in
securing our salvation. This we learn from the very words of the
Prophet, when he says, that God rose up early. But as this testimony of
God’s favor and paternal care towards us is delightful, so to the same
extent dreadful is the vengeance that awaits those who neglect this
favor, who sleep when God is watching, who hear not when he is speaking,
who continue in their sloth and torpor when God of his own accord meets
them, and kindly and gently invites them to himself.

<span id="viii.iv"></span>

<span id="viii.iv-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.iv-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast
been pleased to choose us from our infancy to be thy people, and that
when we were wretched apostates, thou hast also been pleased to restore
us to the right way, by stretching forth thine hand to lead us, — O
grant, that we may not be deaf nor idle; but may it please thee, by thy
Spirit, especially to correct all obstinacy in our hearts, so that we
may render ourselves obedient and submissive to thee: and as thou hast
not ceased continually to call us, may we in our turn respond to thee,
and not only by our tongues, but also by our works, pursue the course
which thou hast appointed for us, until we shall reach the goal, and
enjoy that blessed state of glory which thou hast prepared for us in
heaven, through Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="viii.v"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p1"></span>Lecture Ninety-Fourth

<span id="viii.v-p2"></span>We began yesterday to explain God’s
complaint against the Jews, — that he had found them wholly refractory
and rebellious. He says, in one word, that they did *not hear him;* but
he afterwards adds, that they *did not incline their ear to hear him;*
by which mode of speaking, is set forth more fully their perverseness,
as they closed their ears as it were designedly; for not to incline the
ear is more than not to hear. Jeremiah then means, that they had so
hardened themselves against all that was taught by the prophets, that
they designedly rejected everything that was set before them by God’s
authority.

<span id="viii.v-p3"></span><span id="viii.v-p3.1"></span>

<span id="viii.v-p4"></span>He afterwards explains what God required
them to do, *Turn ye, I pray, every one from his evil way and from the
wickedness of your doings, and dwell in the land which Jehovah has given
to you and your fathers from age even to age* What God required was
doubtless most just; for he demanded nothing from the Jews but to
repent. There was also a promise added; God not only exhorted them to
repent, but wished also to be reconciled to them, and having blotted out
all memory of their sins, to shew them kindness: had they not been
harder than stones, they must have been turned to his service by so kind
a treatment. God might have indeed sharply reproved them, he might have
threatened them, he might, in short, have cut off every hope of pardon;
but he only required them to repent, and at the same time added a
promise of free forgiveness. As then they had despised so great a favor,
it follows that they must have been men of reprobate minds and of
irreclaimable habits.

<span id="viii.v-p5"></span>When they were bidden to repent of their
*evil way and of the wickedness of their doings,* it was done for sake
of amplifying; for the Prophet wished to take away from them every
pretense for evasion, lest they should ask what was the wickedness or
what was the evil way. He then intimates that they were fully proved
guilty; and for this purpose he made the repetition. By *way* is
designated a continued course of life; but as they had fully shewed
themselves perverse in many ways, he refers to their fruits, as though
he had said, that they in vain contended with God, by inquiring what had
been their evil way, for their whole life sufficiently testified that
they were wholly given to wickedness.

<span id="viii.v-p6"></span>Now there is a striking alliteration in the
verbs <span id="viii.v-p6.1"></span>ובש and <span
id="viii.v-p6.2"></span>ובשו: the verb <span
id="viii.v-p6.3"></span>ובש, *shebu,* means sometimes to rebel, it means
to return to the right way, and it means to rest or dwell in. He uses
the same verb, though the sense is different when he says, “Return ye,”
and “ye shall dwell.”  <span id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md)

<span id="viii.v-p8"></span>He also emphatically uses the word <span
id="viii.v-p8.1"></span>שיא*, aish* “every one:” it means properly
“man;” but it is taken in Hebrew for every one or each one, “each one
from his evil way.” The Prophet exempted none, lest they thought that
their fault was extenuated, had not the evil been universal. He hence
says, that *every one* was given to *wickedness;* as though he had said,
that impiety not only prevailed among the whole people, as the case
commonly is, but that every one had become corrupt, so that there was
not one sound or upright among the whole people.

<span id="viii.v-p9"></span>And this is what ought to be observed; for
we are wont, in a cold manner, to confess our sins, and to pray to God
when we are proved guilty, except when each one is touched with the
sense of his own guilt, and owns himself to be justly exposed to God’s
judgment; for while every one mingles with the multitude, it so happens
that no one acknowledges the heinousness of his own sins. Therefore, for
true and sincere repentance this peculiar examination is necessary, so
that every one may repent and not regard his friends.

<span id="viii.v-p10"></span>When he says, *Dwell ye in the land,*
though it be the imperative mood, yet it is a promise, by which God
declared that he was ready to receive the Jews into favor, provided they
returned from the heart to him: he proposed to them, as a symbol of his
paternal layout, the possession of the land; for that land was as it
were the pledge of their adoption; and the Jews, while they dwelt there,
might have felt assured that God was their Father. He adds, *From age
even to age;* as though he had said, “I am prepared to do you good not
only for one day, or for a short time, but also to shew you kindness
from age to age. It will then be your fault if ye be not happy, and if
this happiness will not pass on from you to your children and
grandchildren.” But the more delightful the invitation was, the more
detestable became the impiety of the people, as it will be stated
hereafter. He now adds, —

<span id="viii.vi"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p1"></span><span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#006.md)<span id="viii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p2"></span>**6.** And go not after other gods to serve
them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of
your hands; and I will do you no hurt.

<span id="viii.vi-p3"></span>**6.** Et ne ambuletis post deos alienos ad
serviendum ipsis, et ad incurvandum coram ipsis (id est, ad eos
adorandos,) et ne provocetis me in opere manuum vestrarum, et non
malefaciam vobis.

<span id="viii.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.vi-p5"></span><span id="viii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vi-p6"></span>The Prophet mentions here one kind of sin;
for though the Jews in many, and even in numberless ways kindled God’s
wrath, yet they especially procured a heavy judgment for themselves by
their superstitions. They indeed manifested their contempt of God by
adultery, theft, and plunder, but in a way not so direct; for when they
abandoned themselves to the superstitions of the Gentiles, they thus
shook off the yoke of God, as though they openly testified that he was
no longer their God. And we know that nothing is so much valued and
approved by God as a sincere attention to real piety; hence the Church
is taught in the first table of the Law how he is to be worshipped. This
is the reason why the Prophet especially reminds the Jews here that they
had, in this respect, been rebellious against God, because he could not
bring them back from their corrupt superstitions. He does not at the
same time absolve them of other sins; but he mentions this one kind, in
order that they might understand, that they were not only in part, but
altogether rebellious against God; for they wholly departed from him
when they vitiated his worship with wicked superstitions. We must then
bear in mind, that the Jews were not condemned for some small offenses,
but accused of the most heinous of sins; for they had become
covenant-breakers and apostates, and had forsaken God himself and his
law.

<span id="viii.vi-p7"></span>He says, *Walk ye not after foreign gods to
serve them and to worship them* He pointed out as by the finger, how
gross had been their impiety; for they had given themselves up to idols,
that they might basely serve them; they had wholly devoted themselves to
them. It was not then an excusable error, but a manifest treachery. He
adds, *Provoke me not by the work of your hands* No doubt the Prophet
meant by these words to confirm what has been already stated, that
idolatry is before God an intolerable wickedness: and at the same time
he shews, that they had not sinned through ignorance, for they had in
time been reminded of the atrocity of this sin. As then they had not
ceased from their superstitions, they were thus proved guilty of a
diabolical madness, for they feared not to provoke God against them. And
he says, *by the work of your hands;* and thus he speaks contemptuously
or rather reproachfully of idols. They called them gods, not that they
were ignorant that they were statues curiously made of wood and stone,
or of some other material; but still they thought that divinity was
connected with them, for they believed that God was thus rightly
worshipped. Now, then, the Prophet calls them *the work of hands,* as
though he had said, “If the Jews themselves are nothing, the idols are
less than nothing; for they are only the work of hands.” And this way of
speaking often occurs in the Prophets, by which God intended to shake
off the stupidity of men, who were become quite senseless in their own
devices; as though he had said, “Have you not a particle of a right
understanding in you? do you not know, that this which ye worship is the
work of your own hands? and what can your hands do? for what are ye
yourselves?” We now perceive what the Prophet had in view in using these
words.

<span id="viii.vi-p8"></span>There is, again; a promise given, *I will
not do you evil* God declares by these words that they would be exempt
from all trouble and distress, if they continued to walk according to
the rule of true religion; and thus he intimates that whatever evils
they had already endured, and would have hereafter to endure, could not
be imputed to anything but to their own perverseness, for God had of his
own free-will promised to spare them, provided they departed from their
wicked ways. And such a hope ought especially to encourage us to repent,
for we see that God is ready to receive us and seeks reconciliation with
us, and is always prepared to forgive all our sins, provided we from the
heart return to him; and he seems as one unwilling to inflict
punishment. Here again the impiety of the people is more fully proved,
for they refused to receive from God this invaluable favor. It follows,
—

<span id="viii.vii"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p1"></span><span id="viii.vii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p2"></span>**7**. Yet ye have not hearkened unto me,
saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your
hands to your hurt.

<span id="viii.vii-p3"></span>**7**. Et non audistis me, (non
auscultastic mihi) dicit Jehova, ut provocaretis (hoc est, quia
voluistis me irritare) in opere manuum vestrarum, in malum vobis.

<span id="viii.vii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.vii-p5"></span><span id="viii.vii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.vii-p6"></span>He proves what he had said before, that
the Jews had been wholly disobedient, though God had kindly offered and
shewed that he would be reconciled to them, provided they turned from
the heart to him. The fact that this message was not received by the
Jews, was an evidence of extreme and irreclaimable obstinacy. And he
enhances their guilt by saying, *that ye might provoke me;* for he
intimates that they were led away to evil by a voluntary purpose, as
though they wished to provoke God. The Prophet, then, by saying *that ye
might provoke me,* accuses them of deliberate wickedness. It, indeed,
often happens that men go astray through ignorance, and do not attend
because no one warns them; but since God had so many times exhorted the
Jews to repent, no other opinion could have been formed of them, but
that they designedly wished, not only to despise God, but also to
provoke him to the contest.

<span id="viii.vii-p7"></span>And this is what we ought carefully to
notice, for whosoever has been taught the will of God, unless he obeys,
he cannot escape the charge of a voluntary obstinacy, as he has
resolved, as it were, to carry on war with God. Though the ungodly do
not confess this, yet the fact is evident; and God, who is a righteous
judge, has declared that they who despised the prophetic doctrine were
so regarded.

<span id="viii.vii-p8"></span>And he says, *for evil to you,* in order
that they might know that God did not plead his own cause because he
stood in need of their service, but that he cared for their welfare. For
there is to be understood here an implied contrast, as though the
Prophet had said, “What loss has God suffered by your perverseness? Ye
have, indeed, tried to deprive him of his glory, for ye have adorned
your idols by spoils taken from him; but it is not in men’s power to
subtract anything from the rights of God; he remains ever perfect: then
it only turns out to your ruin when ye are rebellious. When, therefore,
God now reproves you, he does not maintain his own right, as though he
received any gain or loss from you; but it is an evidence of his mercy,
because he would not have you to perish, though he sees that you are led
into destruction by an insane impulse.” It afterwards follows, —

the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king
of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and
against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round
about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and
an hissing, and perpetual desolations.

<span id="viii.viii-p5"></span>**9.** Ecce ego mittam et accipiam (vel,

eas, et ponam eas in stuporem et sibilum, et in vastitares seculi (id
est, perpetuas.)

<span id="viii.viii-p6"></span> 

<span id="viii.viii-p7"></span><span id="viii.viii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p8"></span>Here follows a denunciation of
punishment; the Prophet says that God would no longer deal in words, for
their iniquity had ripened, according to what is in Genesis,

<span id="viii.viii-p9"></span>“My Spirit shall not contend (or strive)
any more with man.” (<span id="viii.viii-p9.1"></span>[Ge
6:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen006.htm#003)<span id="viii.viii-p9.1"></span>..md)

<span id="viii.viii-p10"></span>When God prepares to execute vengeance
on the wickedness of men, he says that there is no more time for
contending. A sudden execution of judgment is then what is here
intended; but he mentions at the same time the punishment. After having
explained the cause of so much severity, even because they would *not
hear the words of God,* he adds, *Behold, I will send for and take all
the families of the north,* etc. I have no doubt but that the Prophet
alludes to the edicts of kings, for when they wish to raise an army they
publish their edicts, and order those everywhere to meet who have either
given their names or been enlisted as soldiers. So God now by these
words intimates that the Chaldeans were under his power, so that they
were ready, as soon as he gave them a signal; according to other modes
of speaking he uses in other places, but in the same sense, “I will
hiss,” and also, “I will send an alarm.” The Scripture is full of
expressions of this kind, which shew that all mortals are prepared to
obey God whenever he intends to employ their services; not that it is
their purpose to serve God, but that he by a secret influence so rules
them and their tongues, their minds and hearts, their hands and their
feet, that they are constrained, willing or unwilling, to do his will
and pleasure. And in the same sense he calls Nebuchadnezzar his
*servant,* for that cruel tyrant never meant to offer his service to
God; but God employed him as his instrument, as though he had been hired
by him. And we shall see also elsewhere that he is called God’s servant.

<span id="viii.viii-p11"></span>And it ought to be noticed, for we hence
learn the fact, that many are God’s servants who are yet wholly unworthy
of so honorable a title; but they are not so called with respect to
themselves. Nebuchadnezzar thought that he was making war with the God
of Israel when he invaded Judea; and only ambition, and avarice, and
cruelty impelled him to undertake so many wars. When, therefore, we
think of him, of his designs and his projects, we cannot say that he was
God’s servant; but this is to be referred to God only, who governs by
his hidden and incomprehensible power both the devil and the ungodly, so
that they execute, though unwittingly, whatever he determines. There is
a great difference between these and God’s servants, who, when anything
is commanded them, seek to render that obedience which they ought — all
such are faithful servants. They are, then, justly called God’s
servants, for there is a mutual concord between God and them: God
commands, and they obey. But it is a mutilated and a half service when
the ungodly are led beyond the purpose of their own minds, and God uses
them as instruments when they think of and design another thing.

<span id="viii.viii-p12"></span>It must at the same time be noticed that
this name of servant is given, though in an inferior sense, to
Nebuchadnezzar for the sake of honor, in order that the Jews might be
made ashamed; for it was a great reproach to them that a heathen had
been chosen by God, and had obtained the title of a servant, when they
themselves had become aliens. The Prophet then, no doubt, intended to
cast reproach on them by raising to this dignity the king of Babylon.
There was also another reason, even that the Jews might know that
whatever they were to suffer would be inflicted by God’s hand, and that
they might not otherwise think of Nebuchadnezzar than as God’s scourge,
in order that they might thus be led to confess their sins and be really
humbled. We now perceive the meaning of the words.

<span id="viii.viii-p13"></span>He says *afterwards, I will bring them
on this land and on all its inhabitants, etc* By these words he confirms
what I have just referred to, that God had his vengeance ready as soon
as he purposed to treat the Jews as they deserved. As he had then said
that Nebuchadnezzar and all the people of the north were prepared by him
as hired soldiers, so he now adds that victory was in his power — *I
will bring them,* he says, *over the land* and over all the *neighboring
nations which are around*  <span id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) Why
the Prophet denounces punishment here on other nations we shall see
elsewhere. The Jews, in addition to other vain confidences, were wont to
flatter themselves with this, that if Nebuchadnezzar should invade the
territories of others, all would unite together against him, and that by
such a confederacy they could easily overcome him. As, then, the Jews
looked to all parts, and knew that the Egyptians were in alliance with
them, and were also persuaded that the Moabites, the Tyrians, the
Syrians, and all the rest would become confederates, they became
confident, and indulged in that security by which they deceived
themselves. This, therefore, is the reason why the Prophet expressly
threatens the nations by which they were surrounded, not for the sake of
these nations, but that the Jews might cease to entertain their vain
confidence.

<span id="viii.viii-p15"></span>God says that he would make all nations,
as well as the Jews, *an astonishment, a hissing, and perpetual
desolations* He intimates that it would be a dreadful calamity, such as
would astonish all that heard of it. As it is said elsewhere, “The
report alone will excite alarm;” so in this place, *I will make them for
an astonishment* When a moderate calamity is related to us, we are
indeed moved to pity; but when the greatness of the evil exceeds belief,
we then stand amazed, and all our senses are stunned. The Prophet then
means that the calamity which God would bring on the Jews would be, as
it were, monstrous, such as would stupify all that would hear of it.
 <span id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md)

<span id="viii.viii-p17"></span>At last he adds, that they would be *for
perpetual desolations* He does afterwards, indeed, mitigate the severity
of these words; for he confines God’s vengeance to seventy years. But
this mode of speaking is common in Scripture; for, <span
id="viii.viii-p17.1"></span>םלוע, *oulam* stands opposed to a short
time. It is to be taken in different senses, according to the
circumstances of the passage. It sometimes designates perpetuity, as
when the Prophet *says, from age to age,* that is, through continued
ages, or through a course of years, which shall last perpetually. But
age, or <span id="viii.viii-p17.2"></span>םלוע, *oulam,* is often to be
taken for the time allotted to the people until the coming of Christ;
and sometimes it means simply a long time, as here and in many other
places. It follows, —

<span id="viii.ix"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p1"></span><span id="viii.ix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#010.md)<span id="viii.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p2"></span>**10.** Moreover I will take from them the
voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom,
and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light
of the candle.

<span id="viii.ix-p3"></span>**10.** Et transire faciam (*hoc est,*
auferam) ab ipsis vocem gaudii, et vocem laetitiae, vocem sponsi et
vocem sponsae, vocem molarum (*id est,* strepitum molarum) et lumen
lucernae.

<span id="viii.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.ix-p5"></span><span id="viii.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p6"></span>He confirms here what I have just said, —
that the Jews were not to be chastised in a common manner, but be
exposed to extreme distress. For though all things may not be with us
prosperous and according to our wishes, yet marriages may still be
celebrated, and some hilarity may remain; we may yet eat and drink and
enjoy the necessaries of life, though we may have no pleasures; but the
Prophet shews here that such would be the devastation of the land, that
there would be no thoughts about marriages, that all hilarity and joy
would cease, that there would be no preparations of food, no grinding of
corn, and that, in short, all feasts usually kept by the light of
candles would be no more celebrated. Here, then, he describes to the
life that devastation which had been before mentioned.  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md)

<span id="viii.ix-p10"></span>The Prophet no doubt indirectly condemns
that insensibility by which the devil had possessed the minds of the
people; for though the prophets continually threatened them, yet there
was no end to their exultations and no moderation in them, according to
what is said by Isaiah, who complains of such wantonness, that they
said, “Let us feast, tomorrow we shall die;” and who also says,

<span id="viii.ix-p11"></span>“I have called you to sackcloth and ashes,
but ye went to the harp and to feastings.”  
(<span id="viii.ix-p11.2"></span>[Isa.
22:12](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#012.md),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013)<span id="viii.ix-p11.2"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.ix-p12"></span>When, therefore, the Prophet speaks here
of the *voice of joy and gladness,* of the noise of *millstones,* and of
lamps, he doubtless upbraids them with their stupid security; for they
feared nothing, and thought themselves safe even when God was shewing
himself, as with an outstretched hand, to be their avenging judge. It
follows, —

<span id="viii.x"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p1"></span><span id="viii.x-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011.md)<span id="viii.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p2"></span>**11.** And this whole land shall be a
desolation, *and* an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the
king of Babylon seventy years.

<span id="viii.x-p3"></span>**11.** Et erit tota terra haec in
vastitatem et in stuporem, et servient gentes hae regi Babylonis
septuaginta annis.

<span id="viii.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.x-p5"></span><span id="viii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p6"></span>Here the Prophet mentions the restriction of
which I have spoken, and thus he mitigates the severity of their
punishment. It is, then, a kind of correction; not that he changes
anything, but only by this sort of correction he explains what he before
meant by perpetual desolations.

<span id="viii.x-p7"></span>He says, *The whole land shall be a waste
and an astonishment,* or as some render it, “a desolation.” The word
<span id="viii.x-p7.1"></span>םמש, indeed, means to lay desolate, and
also to astonish; but as he had lately used the word in the sense of
astonishment, I see no reason for changing its meaning here, especially
as it is connected with <span id="viii.x-p7.2"></span>הברח, *charebe.*
But as to the drift of the passage, there is not much difference whether
we say, the land shall be a desolation, or an astonishment; for it was
to be a solitude — reduced to a desolation or a wilderness.  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md)

<span id="viii.x-p9"></span>*And serve shall these nations the king of
Babylon seventy years,* there the Prophet concludes his prophecy
concerning the future calamity of the people, even that the land would
be reduced to a solitude, so as to render every one passing through it
astonished, or that it was to become a horrid spectacle on account of
its desolation. And that a time of seventy years was fixed, it was a
testimony of God’s paternal kindness towards his people, not
indiscriminately towards the whole multitude, but towards the remnant of
whom he had spoken elsewhere. Then the Prophet means, that however
grievously the Jews had sinned, yet God would execute only a temporary
punishment; for after seventy years, as we shall see, he would restore
them to their own country, and repair what they had lost, even the
inhabitation of the promised land, the holy city, and the Temple. And
this is more fully expressed in the next verse.

<span id="viii.xi"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p1"></span><span id="viii.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#012.md)<span id="viii.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p2"></span>**12.** And it shall come to pass, when
seventy years are accomplished, *that* I will punish the king of
Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the
land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations.

<span id="viii.xi-p3"></span>**12.** Et erit cum impleti fuerint
septuaginta anni, visitabo super regem Babylonis et super populum ejus,
dicit Jehova, iniquitatem ipsorum, et super terram Chaldaorum, et ponam
eam in desolationes saeculi (id est, perpetuas.)

<span id="viii.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xi-p5"></span><span id="viii.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xi-p6"></span>The Prophet now, as I have said, shews more
clearly why the time of the captivity and exile had been defined, even
that the faithful might know that God would not forget his covenant,
though he deprived the people of the inheritance of the land. These
words were not addressed indiscriminately to the whole body of the
people, as we have observed before in other places; but the Prophet
intended to consult the benefit of God’s elect, who always retained a
concern for true religion; for they must have a hundred times despaired
had not this promise been added. This, then, was a special doctrine
intended as food for God’s children; for he addressed, as it was apart,
the *elect* and faithful only.

<span id="viii.xi-p7"></span>God says also, that at the end of seventy
years he would *visit the iniquity of the king of Babylon,* and of his
whole people. We hence learn that Nebuchadnezzar was not called God’s
servant because he deserved anything for his service, but because God
led him while he was himself unconscious, or not thinking of any such
thing, to do a service which neither he nor his subjects understood to
be for God. Though, then, the Lord employs the ungodly in executing his
judgments, yet their guilt is not on this account lessened; they are
still exposed to God’s judgment. And these two things well agree
together, — that the devil and all the ungodly serve God, though not of
their own accord, but whenever he draws them by his hidden power, and
that they are still justly punished, even when they have served God; for
though they perform his work, yet not because they are commanded to do
so. They are therefore justly liable to punishment, according to what
the Prophet teaches us here.

<span id="viii.xii"></span>

<span id="viii.xii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.xii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we see
everywhere evidences of thy wrath, and as our own conscience convinces
every one of us, so that we are constrained to confess that we are all,
from the highest to the lowest, guilty before thee, — O grant that we
may in due time return to the right way, and seek to be reconciled to
thee, and never doubt but that thou wilt be merciful and gracious to us,
whenever we solicit pardon in the name of thy only-begotten Son; and may
we also be so reconciled to thee, that we may know that thou art indeed
with us as our Father, by ruling us by thy Spirit, so that thy name may
to the end be glorified, through our Lord Jesus Christ. — Amen.

<span id="viii.xiii"></span>

<span id="viii.xiii-p1"></span>Lecture Ninety-Fifth

<span id="viii.xiii-p2"></span>We explained in the last Lecture the
verse in which God declared that he would punish the king of Babylon and
his people for their cruelty towards the Israelites. We said that this
was addressed peculiarly to the elect, for many of the people perished
without the hope of salvation. But God intended in the meantime to shew
his care for the remnant; and for this reason he defined the time of
exile, and predicted that he would be an enemy to the Babylonians, for
he would undertake the cause of his people.

<span id="viii.xiii-p3"></span>One thing I did not explain, that is,
what the Prophet says of eternal reproaches. Now, it seems that this was
not fulfilled; for though after seventy years Babylon was taken and was
reduced to a state of subjection, yet the city itself remained safe, and
for many ages was celebrated for its great splendor. The Prophet, then,
seems to have exceeded the limits of truth in speaking of these
desolations; for such did not take place when the city was taken by the
Medes and Persians. But, as we have said elsewhere, we ought not to
restrict to one time what is said in many places by the prophets
respecting the destruction of Babylon; for it pleased God, in various
ways and at different times, to execute his vengeance on that people;
and it appears evident from history that it would have been better for
the Babylonians to have perished at once than to have undergone so many
calamities. For in a short time after the people revolted from the
Persians, the city was recovered by the contrivance and craft of
Zopyrus; the nobles were then reduced into slavery, so that no dignity
remained. It was afterwards taken by Alexander; and after that Seleucus
obtained possession of it. On its ruins were then built the city
Ctesiphon, and at length it gradually decayed. But no change occurred
without a great diminution of the city’s opulence; and nothing more
disgraceful could have happened to it than for those who were in
authority to be taken and hung on gibbets, as Zenophon and other
historians relate.

<span id="viii.xiii-p4"></span>We now, then, see how this passage, and
others like it, are to be understood; for God does not speak only of one
time of vengeance, but he includes all those judgments by which he
vindicated the wrongs done to his people. It now follows, —

<span id="viii.xiv"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p1"></span><span id="viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:13](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#013.md)<span id="viii.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p2"></span>**13.** And I will bring upon that land
all my words which I have pronounced against it, *even* all that is
written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the
nations.

<span id="viii.xiv-p3"></span>**13.** Et adducam super terram illam
omnes sermones meos quod loquutus sum super eam, quicquid scriptum est
in libro hoc, quod prophetavit Jeremias super omnes gentes (*vel* in quo
prophetavit, *si placeat referre ad librum.)*

<span id="viii.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xiv-p5"></span><span id="viii.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p6"></span>He confirms what he had said before when
he says, that he would *bring* all his *words* on the Chaldeans; that
is, that he would give effect to all the prophecies, so that it would be
evident that Jeremiah had foretold nothing rashly, and that God had not
in vain threatened them by the mouth of his servant. Such is the
meaning, and hence we see what the Prophet intimates when he says, that
God would bring all his words, for he had then spoken. But as the
ungodly regard whatever is brought forward in God’s name as a matter of
sport and mockery, and boldly deride all threatenings, to *bring words*
means the same thing with proving by events that God does not terrify
men without accomplishing his words; in short, to bring words is to
prove their authority. And, as I have said, the expression has a
reference to the insensibility of men who give no credit to God’s words
until they are convinced by their accomplishment; for they think that
the air only is beaten, and thus they are not touched by any fear. But
God proves the power of his word when he executes what he has predicted.

<span id="viii.xiv-p7"></span>We then see that the Prophet intends
nothing else in this verse than to confirm what he had said before. And
he speaks of Chaldea and says, *upon that land*

<span id="viii.xiv-p8"></span>And we must at the same time notice
another form of speaking; for God says, that he had pronounced these
*words;* he afterwards says, that Jeremiah was his minister, and as it
were his herald; and he calls him also a scribe or a writer. God then
here declares that he was the author of all that Jeremiah had brought
forward; and yet he leaves his own office to his minister, for it is
necessary to secure authority to the prophets; otherwise, except God
visibly descended from heaven, men would either indiscriminately admit
what might be said, and without judgment receive falsehood and truth, or
they would become wholly hardened, so as to give no credit to prophetic
instruction. He says, *whatsoever is written in this book* The Prophet
no doubt wrote down a summary of what he had delivered; for as we have
said elsewhere, it was usual with the prophets, after they had spoken at
large to the people and preached diffusely, to affix a short summary to
the doors of the Temple. This volume then is what Jeremiah calls the
book, which was composed from his public addresses. It might in common
language be called a summary. Then he adds, *in what,* or, “what he
prophesied,”  <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) in order to shew
that he meant what he had before said; and so it might be rendered, that
is, what he prophesied; but the other exposition is not unsuitable, *in
which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations* It follows, —

<span id="viii.xv"></span>

<span id="viii.xv-p1"></span><span id="viii.xv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#014.md)<span id="viii.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xv-p2"></span>**14.** For many nations and great kings
shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them
according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.

<span id="viii.xv-p3"></span>**14.** Quia fecerunt in illis *(vel,* quia
coegerunt eos) in servitutem etiam ipsi, gentes multae *(vel,* robustae,
*vel,* validae) et reges magni; et rependam illis secundum actionem suam
et seceundum opus manuum ipsorum.

<span id="viii.xv-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xv-p5"></span><span id="viii.xv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xv-p6"></span>The beginning of the verse is obscure. When
the verb <span id="viii.xv-p6.1"></span>דבע, *obed,* is followed by
<span id="viii.xv-p6.2"></span>ב, *beth,* they think that it is to be
taken actively, and rendered, to force or drive to bondage. It means
properly, to serve; but they think that found as here it is a transitive
verb. Some render it, “they employed them;” but this is frigid and
ambiguous; for friends may be said to employ one another, when the work
is mutual; hence the meaning is not sufficiently expressed. But the
meaning may be given by a paraphrase, that they “forced them into
bondage.” Still the meaning of the Prophet is not yet sufficiently
clear; for <span id="viii.xv-p6.3"></span>ודבע, *obedu,* may be taken
either in the past or future tense. It is, indeed, in the past tense;
but the past may be taken for the future: thus the meaning may be
different. If it be taken in the past tense, then it cannot be applied
except to the Babylonians; for they were those who had treated the
Israelites as slaves, or had forced them into bondage; and <span
id="viii.xv-p6.4"></span>םב, *bem,* “them,” might be understood of the
Israelites; for we know that pronouns are often thus used, when the
Church, or God’s elect people, is the subject. Then the Prophet’s words
may be thus rendered, “for they have tyrannically ruled over them,” even
the Israelites, “and they themselves,” that is, the Israelites, shall in
their turn rule, the latter words being understood. But the meaning, as
it seems to me, would be more simple, were we to read the whole together
in this way, “For they also themselves shall rule over them, even over
strong and valiant nations and great kings, and I will recompense them,”
etc.

<span id="viii.xv-p7"></span>The reason which has constrained me to give
this interpretation is this: It is said in the last verse that Jeremiah
prophesied against all nations; then follows an explanation, and the
Prophet briefly shews, or reminds us, what would be the issue of these
prophecies, even that they also would themselves rule over these
nations. Then <span id="viii.xv-p7.1"></span>םב, *bem,* as I think,
refers to the Babylonians and other heathen nations; and it is a common
thing with the prophets, when they speak of the restoration of the
ancient Church, and of Christ’s coming, to promise power to God’s
children to hold the whole world under their feet. The sentence also
will flow better, when we give this version, “They shall rule.” There
is, indeed, a change as to time, but this is a common thing in Hebrew.
It is then; *For they shall rule over them,* that is, the nations.
Jeremiah had spoken of all heathen nations; mention had been made of all
that he had prophesied against all nations; and he says now what seemed
incredible, and hence the particle <span id="viii.xv-p7.2"></span>םג,
*gam,* is introduced, “even these very Israelites,” as though he had
said, “Though this shall happen beyond hope, so as to appear strange and
fabulous, yet God by the issue will shew that he has not in vain
communicated this to me; for they, even the Israelites, shall have their
turn to exercise dominion; and they shall constrain all nations to obey
them.” And what follows confirms my view; for he adds, *over strong
nations,* <span id="viii.xv-p7.3"></span>םיבר םיוג, *guim rebim,* (for
the <span id="viii.xv-p7.4"></span>ב, *beth,* may be repeated here;) or
we may render the words “many nations;” for the word <span
id="viii.xv-p7.5"></span>םיבר, *rebim,* means both; but as it follows
“and great kings,” I am disposed to render the words, “strong nations.”
Then he says, “For they shall rule over strong nations and great kings.”
 <span id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md)

<span id="viii.xv-p12"></span>He then subjoins, *I will recompense
them,* that is, both kings and nations, *according to their doing, and
according to the work of their hands,* because they had exercised every
kind of cruelty towards the miserable Israelites. Hence the Prophet
pursues the same subject, — that God would at length really shew, that
though he had been angry with his Church, yet all hope of mercy was not
lost, for he was mindful of his covenant. He thus mitigates the severity
of what he had previously said; he promises them something far better
than what the wretched Jews could have expected in their extreme
calamities.

<span id="viii.xv-p13"></span>We may again learn from the words of the
Prophet, that God so employed Nebuchadnezzar and others, that they
performed no service deserving of praise; for had they been without
fault, God must doubtless have unjustly punished them. This passage then
teaches us, that though the devil and the reprobate execute God’s
judgments, they yet deserve no praise for their obedience, for they have
no such purpose in view. It now follows, —

<span id="viii.xvi-p2"></span>**15.** For thus saith the LORD God of
Israel unto me; Take the wine-cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all
the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.

<span id="viii.xvi-p3"></span>**15.** Quia sic dixit Jehova Deus Israel
ad me, Sume calicem vini furoris (vel, iracundiae) Sume calicem vini

gentibus, ad quas ego mittam to ad eas (*sed hoc secundum redundat.)*

<span id="viii.xvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xvi-p5"></span><span id="viii.xvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvi-p6"></span>Jeremiah now explains more at large what
might on account of its brevity have appeared obscure. He had spoken of
all nations, but his discourse was abrupt; for he had not yet openly
told us that he had been sent by God as a herald to summon all kings and
nations before his tribunal, and to declare what was to be. As, then,
the Prophet had referred to nothing of this kind, his discourse was
ambiguous. But he now declares that a cup from God’s hand had been
delivered to him, which he was to give to all nations to drink. We hence
see that there is here nothing new, but that the Prophet is, as it were,
the interpreter of his previous prophecy, which was briefly stated.

<span id="viii.xvi-p7"></span>Moreover, that what he said might have
more weight, he relates a vision, *Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel
unto me, Take the cup of the wine of this fury from my hand*  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md) We have said in other places that the
fulfillment of prophetic truth was not without reason dwelt upon, and
that the servants of God were so armed, as though the execution of all
that they alleged was ready at hand. They were said to demolish cities
and to overthrow kingdoms even for this reason, because such was the
torpidity of men, that they gave no credit to God, except they were
brought to see the event as it were before their eyes. But as this
subject has been handled more fully elsewhere, I shall only touch upon
it here. He then says, that *a cup had been delivered* to him by God’s
hand; by which words he intimates, that he did not come forth of his own
will to terrify the Jews and other nations, but that he faithfully
proclaimed what had been committed to him; and he also intimates, that
God spoke nothing now but what he meant shortly to execute; and this is
what is to be understood by the word *cup.*

<span id="viii.xvi-p11"></span>He calls it *the cup of the wine of
fury,* or of wrath. This metaphor often occurs in the prophets, but in a
different sense. For God is said sometimes to inebriate men when he
stupifies them, and drives them at one time to madness, and at another
time deprives them of common sense and understanding, so that they
become like beasts; but he is said also to inebriate them, when, by
outward calamities, he fills them with astonishment. So now the Prophet
calls calamity the cup of wrath, even that calamity, which like fire was
to inflame the minds of all those who received no benefit from
chastisements. Madness, indeed, means no other thing than the despair of
those who perceive God’s hand stretched out against them, and thus rage
and clamor, and curse heaven and earth, themselves and God. This is what
we are to understand by *wrath* He compares this wrath to *wine,*
because they who are thus smitten by God’s hand are carried away as it
were beyond themselves, and repent not, nor think of their sins with
calmness of mind, but abandon themselves to a furious rage. We now then
understand why the Prophet says, that the *cup of the wine of wrath* had
been given to him.

<span id="viii.xvi-p12"></span>Then he adds, *An, make all the nations
to whom I send thee*  <span id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) *to drink
it* Here, again, he confirms what I lately referred to, that his office
was farther extended than to teach in the middle of the Church, but that
he had also been chosen to proclaim as a herald God’s judgments on all
nations. He was, indeed, sent to the Jews otherwise than to heathen
nations, for he was set over them as a teacher, and that for their
salvation, provided they were not irreclaimable; but he was sent to the
heathens expressly to threaten them with what was nigh at hand. He was,
however, sent both to the Jews and to all other nations, as he will
hereafter more distinctly shew in due order.

<span id="viii.xvi-p14"></span>We now see the design and object of what
is here said; — to add authority to his last prophecy, Jeremiah, in the
first place, sets forth the vision which had been presented to him; and
then he testifies that he brought nothing of his own, but only obeyed
God and faithfully performed his commands; and thirdly, he intimates
that he was not only appointed a teacher in the Church of God, but was
also a witness of his *vengeance* on all nations. It follows, —

<span id="viii.xvii"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xvii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md)<span id="viii.xvii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p2"></span>**16.** And they shall drink, and be
moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.

<span id="viii.xvii-p3"></span>**16.** Et bibant et moveantur et
insaniant (*ad verbum legendum esset,* bibent et inebriabuntur; *est
enim ubique,* <span id="viii.xvii-p3.1"></span>ו conversivum*; sed
potius resolvi debet copula in particulum finalem,* ut bibent et
inebrientur et insaniant) a facie gladii, quem ego mitto in medio
ipsorum (inter ipsos.)

<span id="viii.xvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xvii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p6"></span>Here the Prophet more fully shews what we
have before stated, that they were not vain terrors when he denounced
God’s judgments on all nations, for we call those threatenings childish
which are not accomplished. But the Prophet here declares that however
obstinately the Jews and others might resist, they could not possibly
escape God’s vengeance, as he was the judge of all. Hence the Prophet is
bidden to take a cup and to give it to others. But the Jews might have
still objected and said, “We may, indeed, take the cup from thine hand,
but what if we refuse? what if we cast away from us what thou givest us
to drink?” Hence the Prophet says that, willing or unwilling, they were
to take the cup, that they might drink and exhaust whatever was destined
for them by God’s judgment; he therefore says *that they may drink*

<span id="viii.xvii-p7"></span>He then adds, *that they may be incensed
and become distracted*  <span id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) These
two words refer, no doubt, to the grievousness of their punishment; for
he intimates that they would become, as it were, destitute of mind and
reason. When God kindly chastises us, and with paternal moderation, we
are then able with resignation to submit to him and to flee to his
mercy; but when we make a clamor and are driven almost to madness, we
then shew that an extreme rigor is felt, and that there is no hope of
pardon. The Prophet, then, intended to express, that so atrocious would
be the calamities of the nations with whom God was angry, that they
would become stupified and almost insane; and at the same time frantic,
for despair would lay hold on their minds and hearts, that they would
not be able to entertain any hope of deliverance, or to submit to God,
but that they would, as it is usual with the reprobate, rise up against
God and vomit forth their blasphemies.

<span id="viii.xvii-p11"></span>He says, *because of the sword that I
will send among them.* It appears from the word <span
id="viii.xvii-p11.1"></span>םתניב, *bintem,* “among them,” that there
would be mutual conflicts, that *they* would destroy one another. God,
then, would send his sword; but he would extend it now to the Chaldeans,
then to the Egyptians; now to the Assyrians, then to other nations, so
that with the same sword they would contend one with another, until at
last it would prove a ruin to them all. It now follows, —

<span id="viii.xviii"></span>

<span id="viii.xviii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:17](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#017.md)<span
id="viii.xviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xviii-p2"></span>**17.** Then took I the cup at the
LORD’S hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the LORD had
sent me:

<span id="viii.xviii-p3"></span>**17.** Et sumpsi calicem e manu
Jehovae, et propinavi cunctis gentibus ad quas misit me Jehova ad eas
(*sed iterum supervacuum est hoec repetitio*:)

<span id="viii.xviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xviii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xviii-p6"></span>The Prophet now adds that he obeyed
God’s command; for he had before often testified that he was constrained
to perform his office, which he would have willingly not have done, if
he was at liberty. But as he was bound to *obey* the divine call, it was
evident that it was not his fault, and that he was unjustly charged by
the people as the author of the evils denounced. We indeed know that the
prophets incurred much ill-will and reproach from the refractory and the
despisers of God, as though all their calamities were to be imputed to
them. Jeremiah then says, that he *took the cup* and *gave it to drink
to all the nations:* he intimates that he had no desire to do this, but
that necessity was laid on him to perform his office. He then shews who
these nations were, —

<span id="viii.xix"></span>

<span id="viii.xix-p1"></span><span id="viii.xix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#018.md)<span id="viii.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xix-p2"></span>**18.** *To wit,* Jerusalem, and the
cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make
them a desolation, an astonishment, an hissing, and a curse; as *it is*
this day;

<span id="viii.xix-p3"></span>**18.** Jerosolymae et urbibus Jehudah, et
regibus ejus, et principibus ejus, ad ponendum eos in vastitatem (*vel,*
solitudinem,) in stuporem, in sibulum, et maledictionem, sicut dies
haec;

<span id="viii.xix-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xix-p5"></span><span id="viii.xix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xix-p6"></span>He begins with Jerusalem, as it is said
elsewhere that judgment would begin at God’s house. (<span
id="viii.xix-p6.1"></span>[1Pe
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017)<span id="viii.xix-p6.1"></span>..md)
And there is nothing opposed to this in the context of the passage; for
though he had promised to the children of God a happy end to the evils
which they were shortly to endure, he nevertheless enumerates here all
the nations on whom God had bidden him to denounce judgments. In this
catalogue the Church obtains the first place; for though God be the
judge of the whole world, he yet justly begins with his own Church, and
that especially for two reasons — for as the father of a family watches
over his children and servants, and if there be anything wrong, his
solicitude is particularly manifested; so God, as he dwells in his
Church, cannot do otherwise than chastise it for its faults; — and then,
we know that they are less excusable, who, having been taught the will
of God, do yet go on indulging their own lusts, (<span
id="viii.xix-p6.2"></span>[Lu
12:47](../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#047.md)<span
id="viii.xix-p6.2"></span>;) for they cannot plead ignorance. Hence is
fulfilled what Christ declares, that those servants shall be more
grievously beaten, who, knowing their masters will, yet obstinately
disregard it. There is, then, a twofold fault in the members of the
Church; and no comparison can be made between them and the unbelieving
who are in thick darkness. Since God shines in his Church and shews the
way, as Moses says,

<span id="viii.xix-p7"></span>“Behold I set before you the way of life
and of death; I therefore call heaven and earth to witness that there is
no excuse for you. (<span id="viii.xix-p7.1"></span>[Deut.
30:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#015.md),
[19](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019)<span id="viii.xix-p7.1"></span>..md)

<span id="viii.xix-p8"></span>This, then, is the second reason why God
first visits the sins of the faithful, or of those who are counted
faithful.

<span id="viii.xix-p9"></span>There is also what appertains to an
example: God chastises his own children lest he should seem by his
indulgence to favor or countenance what is wicked and sinful. But this
third reason is in a manner accidental; and therefore I wished to state
it apart from the two other reasons. When, therefore, God so severely
treats his own Church, the unbelieving ought to draw this conclusion,
that if this be done in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
(<span id="viii.xix-p9.1"></span>[Lu
23:31](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#031.md)<span
id="viii.xix-p9.1"></span>.)

<span id="viii.xix-p10"></span>But the two things which I have before
mentioned ought to be deemed by us as sufficient reasons why God, while
suspending his vengeance as to the reprobate, punishes the elect as well
as all those who profess themselves to be members of his Church. We now
understand why Jeremiah mentions first the holy city, and then all the
cities of Judah, the kings also and the princes; for God had with open
bosom invited them to himself, but they had, as it were, from determined
wickedness, provoked his wrath by despising both his Law and his
Prophets.

<span id="viii.xix-p11"></span>He afterwards adds, *to make them a
waste,* or a solitude. This was a grievous denunciation, no doubt, and
we shall hereafter see that most became enraged against the holy man,
and in their fury endeavored to destroy him; yet he with all intrepid
mind fully declared what God had commanded him. He adds, *an
astonishment,* and in the third place, *an hissing,* even that they
would become detestable to all; for hissing intimates contempt,
reproach, and detestation. In the fourth place he mentions *a curse.* We
have already said what the Prophet meant by this word, even that the
Jews would become in this respect a proverb, so that when one cursed
another, he would use this form, “May God destroy thee as he destroyed
the Jews.”

<span id="viii.xix-p12"></span>It is then added, *as at this day* The
Prophet refers, no doubt, to the time of the city’s destruction. God had
indeed even then begun to consume the people; but we shall hereafter see
that the minds of the greater part were still very haughty: so that they
often raised their crests and looked for a new state of things, and
depended on aid from the Egyptians. But the Prophet here mentions what
was not yet completed, and as it were by the finger, points out the day
as having already come in which the city was to be destroyed and the
temple burnt up. This, then, refers to the certainty of what he
predicted. Some think that it was written after Jeremiah had been led
into exile; but this conjecture has nothing to support it.  <span
id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) It seems to me enough to suppose that
his object was to rouse the Jews from their security, and to shew that
in a short time all that he predicted would be accomplished, and that
they were no more to doubt of this than if the calamity was now before
their eyes. It follows, —

<span id="viii.xx"></span>

<span id="viii.xx-p1"></span><span id="viii.xx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#019.md)<span id="viii.xx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xx-p2"></span>**19.** Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his
servants, and his princes, and all his people;

<span id="viii.xx-p3"></span>**19.** Pharaoni *(pendit enim a superiori
versu quod propinaverit calicem Pharaoni,*) regi Egyptio, servis ejus et
principibus ejus et toti ejus populo;

<span id="viii.xx-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xx-p5"></span><span id="viii.xx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xx-p6"></span>It may here be asked, why he connects
Pharaoh with the Jews, and assigns the second place to the Egyptians
rather than to other nations? The reason is evident, — because the Jews
expected deliverance from them; and the cause of their irreclaimable
obstinacy was, that they could not be removed from that false confidence
by which the devil had once fascinated them. They departed from God by
making the Egyptians their friends; and when they found themselves
unequal to the Assyrians, they turned their hopes to the Egyptians
rather than to God; the prophets remonstrated with them, but with no
success.

<span id="viii.xx-p7"></span>As, then, the occasion of ruin to the
chosen people was Egypt, and as Pharaoh was, as it were, the fountain
and cause of destruction to Jerusalem, as well as to the whole people,
rightly does the Prophet, after having spoken of Jerusalem and the
cities of Judah, immediately mention Pharaoh in the second place; for he
was a friend to the Jews, and they were so connected together that they
were necessarily drawn together into destruction; for they had corrupted
one another, and encouraged one another in impiety, and with united
minds and confederate hearts kindled God’s wrath against themselves.
 <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) The Prophet, then, could not
have spoken of the Jews by themselves, but was under the necessity of
connecting the Egyptians with them, for the state of both people was the
same.

<span id="viii.xxi"></span>

<span id="viii.xxi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.xxi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we cease not
to abuse thy paternal kindness, that when thou sparest us for a time, it
is made by us the occasion of more audacity and liberty in sin, — O
grant that we may be so subdued by thy scourges as to return without
delay to thee, and to seek reconciliation with thee through the blood of
thine only-begotten Son, and also to be so displeased with our vices,
that we may from the heart submit to thee, so as to be governed by thy
Holy Spirit, until, having been cleansed from all our filth, we shall
come to that blessed glory which thou hast prepared for us in heaven,
and which has been obtained for us by the blood of the same, thy Son
Jesus Christ. — Amen.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p3"></span>**20.** Et promiscuae multitudini, et
cunctis regibus terrae Uz, et cunctis regibus terrae Philistim et

<span id="viii.xxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxiii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiii-p6"></span>Jeremiah, after having spoken of his own
nation and of the Egyptians, now mentions other nations who were
probably known by report to the Jews; for we see in the catalogue some
who were afar off. He then does not only speak of neighboring nations,
but also of others. His object, in short, was to shew that God’s
vengeance was near, which would extend here and there, so as to include
the whole world known to the Jews.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p7"></span>We stated yesterday the reason why he
connected the Egyptians with the Jews; but now nothing certain can be
assigned as a reason with regard to each of these nations; only it may
be said in general, that the Jews were thus reminded, not only to
acknowledge God’s judgment towards them as an evidence of his wrath, but
also to extend their thoughts farther and to consider all the
calamities, which would happen to nations far as well as nigh, in the
same light, so that they might know that human events revolve, not by
chance, but that God is a righteous judge, and that he sits in heaven to
chastise men for their sins.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p8"></span>It is a common proverb, that it is a
solace to the miserable to see many like them; but the Prophet had
something very different in view; for it was not his object to alleviate
the grief of his people by shewing that no nations would be free from
calamities; but his intention was to shew them in due time that whatever
happened would proceed from God; for if it had not been predicted that
the Chaldeans would have the whole of the east under their dominion, it
would have been commonly said, that the world was under the rule of
blind fortune, and thus men would have become more and more hardened in
their impiety; for it becomes the cause of obstinacy, when men imagine
that all things happen by chance. And for this reason God severely
reproves those who acknowledge not that he sends wars, famine, and
pestilence, and that nothing adverse takes place except through his
judgment. Hence the Jews were to learn before the time, that when God
afflicted them and other nations, they might know that it had been
predicted, and that therefore God was the author of these calamities,
and that they might also examine themselves so as to acknowledge their
sins; for they who dream that the world as to its evils is governed at
random by fortune, do not perceive that God is displeased with them; and
so they regard not what they suffer as a just punishment.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p9"></span>Many indeed confess God as the inflicter
of punishment, and yet they complain against him. But these two things
ought to be remembered, — that no adversity happens fortuitously, but
that God is the author of all those things which men regard as evils, —
and that he is so, because he is a righteous judge; which is the second
thing. God then in claiming for himself the disposal of all events, and
in declaring that the world is governed at his will, not only declares
that the chief power and the supreme government is in his hand, but goes
farther and shews, that things happening prosperously are evidences of
his goodness and justice, and that calamities prove that he cannot
endure the sins of men, but must punish them. To set forth this was the
Prophet’s design.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p10"></span>He says that God threatened *all the
promiscuous multitude*  <span id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) The word
<span id="viii.xxiii-p11.1"></span>ברע*,* means a swarm of bees; and it
means also any sort of mixture; and hence, when Moses said that many
went up with the people, he used. this word. (<span
id="viii.xxiii-p11.2"></span>[Ex
12:38](../../../bib/kjv/exo012.htm#038.md)<span
id="viii.xxiii-p11.2"></span>.) Nehemiah also says that he separated
such mixtures from the people of God, lest they who had become
degenerated, should corrupt true religion. (<span
id="viii.xxiii-p11.3"></span>[Ne
13:3](../../../bib/kjv/neh013.htm#003.md)<span
id="viii.xxiii-p11.3"></span>.) That the Church, then, might remain true
and faithful, he says that he took away <span
id="viii.xxiii-p11.4"></span>ברע*, oreb,* or this mixture. Now as to
this passage, I have no doubt but that the Prophet speaks thus generally
of the common people; and I extend this name to all the kingdoms, of
which he will hereafter speak. He then adds, *And all the kings of the
land of Uz.* We know that this was an eastern land. I know not why
Jerome rendered it “Ausitis,” and not as in the Book of Job, for the
same word is found there, (<span id="viii.xxiii-p11.5"></span>[Job
1:2](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#002.md)<span
id="viii.xxiii-p11.5"></span>) and we find that Job was born in the
eastern part of the world, for he was plundered by his neighbors, who
were men of the east. Some think that it was Armenia; but it could
hardly be a country so far off, for Cilicia was, with regard to Judea,
in the middle between them. I, then, rather think that Uz was directly
east to Judea.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p12"></span>He adds, *And all the kings of the land
of the Philistines* Whether Palestine had then many kings is uncertain;
it seems indeed probable; but what seems doubtful to me, I leave as
such. It is no objection that he mentions *all the kings,* since he
afterwards speaks of all the kings of Tyre and Sidon, though neither
Tyre nor Sidon had many kings; for they were only two cities. There is
then no doubt, but that the Prophet in speaking of all the kings of the
land, meant that though they succeeded one another, it was yet decreed
in heaven, that all these nations should perish. He therefore intended
to obviate every doubt; for the prophecy was not immediately fulfilled;
but the nations, of whom he now speaks, retained for a time their state,
so that the Prophet might have appeared false in his predictions. Hence
he distinctly mentions *all the kings,* so that the faithful might
suspend their judgment until the appointed time of God’s vengeance came.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p13"></span>He afterwards mentions *Ashkelon;*
which was not a maritime city, though not far from the sea. Then he adds
<span id="viii.xxiii-p13.1"></span>הזע, *oze,* which we call *Gaza,* for
the Greek translators have so rendered it. But what the Greek and Latin
writers have thought, that it was called Gaza, because Cyrus deposited
there his treasures while carrying on war here and there, is wholly
absurd; and it was a frivolous conjecture which occurred to their minds,
because Gaza means a treasure, and the Greek translators rendered Oze,
Gaza; but it was entertained without much thought. The situation of the
city is well known. He then mentions *Ekron,* a neighboring city, not
far from *Azotus,* which is also named. The Prophet says *Ashdod,* which
the Greeks have rendered Azotus, and the Latins have followed them. We
hence see that the Prophet refers to that part of the country which was
towards Syria.

<span id="viii.xxiii-p14"></span>But it may be asked, why he names the
*remnant of Ashdod?* Some think that he refers to neighboring towns, not
so much known, as Gath, which is elsewhere named, but less celebrated
But this exposition seems to me forced and absurd. The probability is,
that Ashdod had been conquered, but that owing to its advantageous
locality it was not wholly forsaken. For <span
id="viii.xxiii-p14.1"></span>תיראש, *sharit,* means what is left or
remains after a slaughter. What remained then in Ashdod, he delivered up
to God’s sword, that it might be destroyed. It follows, —

<span id="viii.xxiv"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#021.md)<span id="viii.xxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiv-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiv-p6"></span>The same words are ever to be repeated,
that Jeremiah made all these nations to drink the cup. He mentions the
*Idumeans,* the posterity of Esau, and also the *Moabites,* the
descendants of Lot, as also were the *Ammonites* There was a
relationship between these three nations and the Israelites; hence the
Prophet seems designedly to have connected these three nations together.
He adds —

<span id="viii.xxv-p2"></span>**22.** And all the kings of Tyrus, and
all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which *are* beyond
the sea,

<span id="viii.xxv-p3"></span>**22.** Et omnibus regibus Tyri et omnibus
regibus Sidonis, et omnibus regibus insulae, quae est (vel, qui sunt;
nam verbum nullum ponitur; potest igitur hoc tam ad reges ipsos quam ad
insulam referri; qui sunt ergo) ultra mare,

<span id="viii.xxv-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxv-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxv-p6"></span>As to the word *Island,* the number is to
be changed; for the Prophet means not one island, but the countries
beyond the sea. Some restrict the reference to Cyprus, Crete, Mitylene,
and other islands in the Mediterranean; but it is a common way of
speaking in Hebrew, to call all countries beyond the sea islands.

<span id="viii.xxv-p7"></span>“The kings of the islands shall come.”
(<span id="viii.xxv-p7.1"></span>[Ps
72:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa072.htm#010.md)<span
id="viii.xxv-p7.1"></span>.)

<span id="viii.xxv-p8"></span>The Prophet in that passage calls those
the kings of the islands who would come in ships to Judea. So also in
this place we may understand by the kings of the islands all those who
were beyond the sea.

<span id="viii.xxv-p9"></span>We now see that kings of one age only are
not those summoned to God’s tribunal; for why does the Prophet mention
all the kings of Tyre and all the kings of Sidon? Was it possible for
these two cities to have four or two kings at the same time? But we must
bear in mind what I have already stated, — that the children of God were
warned, lest they should entertain a too fervid expectation as to the
fulfillment of this prophecy. It is then the same as if he had said,
“Though God’s vengeance may not come upon the present king of Tyre or of
Sidon, it is yet suspended over all kings, and shall be manifested in
its time.”  <span id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) Tyre and Sidon, we
know, were cities of Phoenicia, and very celebrated; and Tyre had many
colonies afar off, among which the principal was Carthage; and the
Carthaginians offered honorable presents to it every year, in order to
shew that they were its descendants. And Tyre itself was a colony of
Sidon, according to historians; but it so prospered, that the daughter
as it were swallowed up the mother. But it appears evident that there
were kings there in the time of Isaiah and Jeremiah, though in the time
of Alexander both cities were republics; for many changes during that
period had taken place in them. Now the Prophet says only, that Tyre and
Sidon would be involved in the punishment which he denounced on both
kings and people. It follows —

*that are* in the utmost corners,

<span id="viii.xxvi-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxvi-p6"></span>I shall now only touch briefly on the
*extreme ones in a corner,* or those bounded by a corner, who were
almost unknown to the Jews on account of their distance.  <span
id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md) After having spoken of nations so very
remote, that he might not by prolixity be tedious, he mentions *all the
extreme ones in a corner,* that is, those who were bounded by the
farthest limits. As to *Dedan, Tema, and Buz,* we know that these
countries derived their names from their founders. Who Dedan was, we
learn from Moses, and also who Tema and Buz were. (<span
id="viii.xxvi-p7.2"></span>[Gen. 25:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#003.md),

id="viii.xxvi-p7.3"></span>.) Two of them were descendants of Abraham by
Keturah.  <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) There is no need of
saying more of these countries, for they are not known by us at this
day, and we cannot learn from geographers the extent of any of these
countries; for there was hardly a place at the time when heathen writers
began their records, which had not long before changed its name. We
however conclude that these were eastern countries. It follows —

all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert,

<span id="viii.xxvii-p3"></span>**24.** Et omnibus regibus Arabiae, et

<span id="viii.xxvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxvii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxvii-p6"></span>The Prophet now mentions the *kings of
Arabia,* who were neighbors on one side to the Jews. He has hitherto
mentioned nations towards the sea; he has named many maritime towns, and
also others which were at some distance from the sea, and yet were not
remote; for they were towns and countries intermediate between Judea and
Syria or Cilicia, or verging towards Cilicia. He now speaks of Arabia,
which was between Egypt and Babylon. And though Arabia was divided into
three parts; it was however sterile where it bordered on Judea; it might
therefore be said to be a desert.

<span id="viii.xxvii-p7"></span>But the Prophet, in the first place,
mentions *the kings of Arabia,* and then the *miscellaneous kings,* as
we may call them, that is, those who ruled in desert regions and were
hardly of any repute; we, indeed, know that they were petty robbers; and
these Arabs were sometimes called Schenites, because they dwelt in
tents. I therefore consider that these, by way of contempt, were called
*kings of the promiscuous multitude,* who excelled not in dignity nor in
wealth; and hence the Prophet adds, that they *dwelt in the desert,*
being a wandering people. It follows, —

<span id="viii.xxviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxviii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxviii-p6"></span>He now mentions nations more remote,
but whose fame was more known among the Jews. We, indeed, know that the
*Elamites,* who dwelt between Media and Persia, had ever been people of
great repute. As to *Media,* it was a very large kingdom and wealthy,
abounding in all delicacies; and we also know how fond of display were
the Medes. With regard to *Zimri,*  <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) it was an obscure nation in comparison
with the Elamites and the Medes. The Prophet, however, intimates that
every part of the earth, even the smallest kingdom, known to the Jews,
would be visited by God’s judgment, so that the whole earth, in every
direction, would become a witness that God sits in heaven as a judge. It
follows, —

<span id="viii.xxix"></span>

id="viii.xxix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah

<span id="viii.xxix-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxix-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxix-p6"></span>The Prophet speaks now of the kings of
the north who bordered on the king of Babylon; for as to Judea, Babylon
was northward. He calls all those who were towards Chaldea the kings of
the north. He then says, *Whether near or remote, every one shall be
against his brother,* and, in short, *all the kingdoms of the earth on
the face of the earth* There is no doubt, as we shall see, but that the
Prophet put in the last place the Chaldeans and their king. It is hence
probable that what he here predicts was to be *accomplished* by the hand
and power of the king of Babylon, who executed God’s vengeance on all
these nations. God, then, chose for himself the king of Chaldea as a
scourge, and guided him by his hand in punishing all the lands mentioned
here.

<span id="viii.xxix-p7"></span>I have already reminded you that this was
not predicted for the sake of the Jews, that they might derive any
alleviation to their grief from the circumstance of having associates,
because the condition of others was nothing better; but that God’s
design was another, that is, that in so great a confusion of all things,
when heaven and earth, as they say, were blended together, they might
know that nothing happens through the blind will of fortune. For God had
already testified by the mouth of his servant what he would do, and from
this prophecy it was easy to conclude that all these changes and violent
commotions were the effects of God’s judgment.

<span id="viii.xxix-p8"></span>The Prophet, after having shewn that the
most grievous calamities were nigh all the nations who were neighbors to
the Jews, and whose fame had reached them, says, in the last place, that
the *king of Sheshach would drink after them* Hitherto the Prophet seems
to have exempted the king of Babylon from all trouble and danger; for he
has mentioned all the nations, and has spoken not only of those who were
nigh the Jews, but also of the Persians, the Medes, and others. What,
then, could have been the design of all this, if the king of Babylon had
been passed by? It might have been asked, how can it be right and
consistent that this tyrant should escape punishment, though he was of
all the most cruel and the most wicked? Hence the Prophet now says, that
the king of Babylon, how much soever his violence prevailed among all
nations, and raged unpunished, would yet in his time be brought to a
reckoning. The meaning then is, that God would defer the punishment of
the Chaldeans until he employed them in destroying all the nations of
which Jeremiah has hitherto spoken.

<span id="viii.xxix-p9"></span>Respecting the king of Babylon being
called the *king of Sheshach,* a question has been raised, and some
think that some unknown king is intended; for we know that the word is a
proper name, as it appears from some passages of Scripture. (<span
id="viii.xxix-p9.1"></span>[1Ki
11:40](../../../bib/kjv/kg1011.htm#040.md)<span
id="viii.xxix-p9.1"></span>; <span id="viii.xxix-p9.2"></span>[2Ch
12:2](../../../bib/kjv/ch2012.htm#002.md)<span
id="viii.xxix-p9.2"></span>.) But this opinion is not well founded; for
the Prophet no doubt speaks here of some remarkable king; and there is
also no doubt but that he reminded them of some most important event, so
that there was no reason why delay should depress the minds of the
faithful, though they saw that this Sheshach was not immediately
punished with the rest. Others conjecture that Sheshach was a renowned
city in Chaldea. But there is no necessity for us to adopt such light
and frivolous conjectures. I have no doubt but that the opinion which
the Chaldee paraphraser has followed is the true one, that is, that
Sheshach was Babylon. For the sort of alphabet which the Jews at this
day call <span id="viii.xxix-p9.3"></span>שבתא, *atbash,* is no new
invention; it appears from Jerome it had been long known; he, indeed,
derived from great antiquity the practice, so to speak, of counting the
letters backwards. They put, the last letter, <span
id="viii.xxix-p9.4"></span>ת, in the place of <span
id="viii.xxix-p9.5"></span>א, the first, and then <span
id="viii.xxix-p9.6"></span>ש in the place of <span
id="viii.xxix-p9.7"></span>ב, and <span id="viii.xxix-p9.8"></span>כ
being in the middle of the letters was put for <span
id="viii.xxix-p9.9"></span>ל; and so they called Babel Sheshach.  <span
id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) And to designate Babylon by an obscure
name was suitable to the design of the Prophet. But every doubt is
removed by another passage in this Prophet,

<span id="viii.xxix-p12"></span>“How is Sheshach demolished! how fallen
is the glory (or praise) of the whole earth! how overthrown is
Babylon!”  
(<span id="viii.xxix-p12.2"></span>[Jer
51:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#040.md)<span
id="viii.xxix-p12.2"></span>.)

<span id="viii.xxix-p13"></span>There, no doubt, the Prophet explains
himself; there is therefore no need to seek any other interpretation. It
is a common thing, as we know, with the prophets to repeat the same
thing in other words; as he had mentioned Sheshach in the first clause,
to prevent any doubt he afterwards mentioned Babylon.

<span id="viii.xxix-p14"></span>But here a question arises; why did not
the Prophet openly and plainly denounce ruin on the king as well as on
the Chaldean nation? Many think that this was done prudently, that he
might not create an ill-will towards his own people; and Jerome brings
forward a passage from Paul, but absurdly, where he says,

<span id="viii.xxix-p15"></span>“Until a defection shall come,” (<span
id="viii.xxix-p15.1"></span>[2Th
2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003)<span id="viii.xxix-p15.1"></span>.md)

<span id="viii.xxix-p16"></span>but he did not understand that passage,
for he thought that Paul spoke of the Roman empire. One error brings
another; he supposed that Paul was cautious that he might not excite the
fury of the Roman Emperor against the Church; but it was no such thing.
Now, they who reject the opinion, which is the most correct, that
Sheshach was Babylon, make use of this argument, — that the Prophet was
not afraid to speak of Babylon, because he had declared openly of it
what he had to say, as we have already seen in other places, and as it
will appear more clearly hereafter. But I do not allow that the Prophet
was afraid to speak of Babylon, for we find that he boldly obeyed God,
so that he stood firm, as we may say, in the midst of many deaths; but I
think that he concealed the name for another reason, even that the Jews
might know that they had no cause to be in a hurry, though the
punishment of Babylon had been predicted, for the prophecy was, as it
were, buried, inasmuch as the Prophet withheld the very name of Babylon.
It was not, then, his purpose to provide for the peace of the Church,
nor was he afraid of the Chaldeans, lest he should kindle their fury
against God’s people; he had no such thing in view, but wished rather to
restrain too much haste.

<span id="viii.xxix-p17"></span>And this appears from the context;
*Drink,* he says, *shall the king of Sheshath after them;* that is, all
these nations must drink before God shall touch the king of Babylon. He
will not, then, be an idle spectator of all these calamities, but his
severity will proceed through all lands until it reaches its summit; and
then, he says, this king shall drink after the rest. Now, it might have
seemed a poor consolation that God would for so long a time spare the
king of Babylon; but all God’s children ought nevertheless to have
acquiesced in the admonition given them, that though they were to bear
in mind that each of these nations were to be punished by God’s hand,
they were yet to believe that the king of Babylon would have his turn,
and that they therefore were to restrain themselves, and not to be
carried away by too hasty a desire to look for his punishment, but
patiently to bear the yoke of tyranny laid on them, until the seasonable
time came of which they had been reminded. It follows, —

<span id="viii.xxx"></span>

<span id="viii.xxx-p1"></span><span id="viii.xxx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:27](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#027.md)<span id="viii.xxx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxx-p2"></span>**27.** Therefore thou shalt say unto
them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be
drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword
which I will send among you.

<span id="viii.xxx-p3"></span>**27.** Et dices ad eos, Sic dicit Jehova
exercituum, Deus Israel, Bibite et inebriamini, vomite et cadite, et ne
surgatis a facie gladii, quem ego mitto inter vos.

<span id="viii.xxx-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxx-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxx-p6"></span>Here the Prophet returns to his former
discourse. He had said that a cup was extended to him by God’s hand,
that he might give it to all nations to drink. He now repeats and
confirms the same thing, not indeed that he brought this message to all
the nations; for we have said the benefit arising from these predictions
belonged only to the Jews. Neither the Tyrians nor the Sidonians ever
knew that they were punished by God’s hand when they were plundered by
their enemies; this never came to their minds, nor had this been ever
taught them. The Prophet had not been appointed their teacher; but his
duty was only to warn his own nation.

<span id="viii.xxx-p7"></span>However, the Prophet, that his predictions
might have greater authority, is here introduced as God’s herald,
denouncing ruin on all nations, *Thou shalt therefore say to them, Thus
saith Jehovah,* etc. The true God was unknown to these heathens, except
they had heard that God was worshipped in Judea; but at the same time
they despised, yea, hated true religion. But, as I have already said,
the Prophet addressed his own people, the Jews alone, though he spoke of
aliens and distant nations. I cannot advance further now.

<span id="viii.xxxi"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.xxxi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since there are
before our eyes so many evidences of thy judgments and of thy goodness,
we may advance in the fear of thy name, and not go on to kindle thy
wrath more against us, but that, being touched with true repentance, we
may seek to be reconciled to thee, and that, commiserating the many
evils, by which the world is at this day afflicted, we may also strive
to restore those to the right way who seem to give themselves up to
their own ruin, so that by converting those to thee who are now far away
and aliens, thy name may be more glorified and proclaimed by us with one
consent, through Christ Jesus our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="viii.xxxii"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxii-p1"></span>Lecture Ninety-Seventh

<span id="viii.xxxii-p2"></span>We began yesterday to explain the verse
in which Jeremiah bids *all nations* to drink of the cup until they were
drunken. Of the metaphor of the cup an explanation has already been
given: the reason is, because God in his infinite wisdom knew what every
one deserved, or how just it was to chastise at one time in a lighter,
and at another time in a heavier degree. As then the measure is not the
same, the similitude of a cup is most suitable. Further, God sometimes
gives a cup to drink, that he who cannot bear a heavier punishment may
only taste it. For we know that God deals more severely with the strong
and the obstinate: but when any one is weak, he is treated more gently,
and is made only to sip or to taste of the cup.

<span id="viii.xxxii-p3"></span>But the Prophet says here that they were
to drink until they became drunken, according to what is said in another
place, when the heathens are spoken of, “They shall even exhaust the yew
dregs.” And God makes men drunken, as I have said before, even when he
blinds them and gives them the spirit of giddiness or stupor. (<span
id="viii.xxxii-p3.1"></span>[Obadiah
26](../../../bib/kjv/oba001.htm#026.md)<span id="viii.xxxii-p3.1"></span>
\[*sic*\].) But the word drunkenness refers to external chastisements.
*Drink ye,* then, *and be drunken;* that is, “think ye not that you have
suffered all, when God begins to punish you and has given you one
draught only; but the Lord will make you thoroughly drunken.” And hence
he adds, *Vomit ye and fall;* for they who indulge in excess and fill
themselves, so that they almost burst, must necessarily disgorge
themselves. And vomiting disorders the brain, so that the feet can no
longer perform their office, and no part of the body retains its power.
The meaning then is, that as God had for a long time deferred his
judgment, and all nations had hardened themselves when his
long-suffering invited them to repentance, the most dreadful vengeance
was now nigh them all, a vengeance which would compensate for the delay
or the length of endurance.

<span id="viii.xxxii-p4"></span>Some interpreters hence *conclude,* that
the punishment of all the nations of whom the Prophet now speaks, would
be of no avail to them: but this seems not to me to be well founded. For
he has spoken of the chosen people; and it is certain that some of them
repented, however small the number was, and we shall also see that
pardon and salvation are promised even to the heathens, after the
execution of God’s judgments. I therefore thus simply interpret these
words, — that they should not only taste of the cup, but also drink to
excess, so as to become like drunken men, wholly stupified, because the
heaviness of their punishment would deprive them of reason. In no way
more solid is the reason given by Jerome, when he says that the
Prophet’s discourse refers to the reprobate, because he subjoins, *And
rise no more* Jerome thought, that by this expression extreme despair is
intimated. But the Prophet, in my judgment, meant nothing else than that
God’s vengeance on all the nations would be so great that vestiges of it
would remain after a length of time; as the case is with a drunkard, who
cannot get rid of the effects of his excess in a night or in a day, but
he remains stupid for some time, or becomes frantic. This is what the
Prophet means when he says, *and they shall rise no more*  <span
id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md)

<span id="viii.xxxii-p8"></span>It now follows, On *account of the sword
which I send* among you. He now expresses without a figure what he had
said of drunkenness and vomiting, even that so great a horror would
seize their minds, that they would lie down wholly stupified. But God
declares that he would send a sword against them, that the Jews might
understand, as it has been already stated, that when all things would be
in a state of almost entire confusion, yet God’s judgment would be
within the limits of moderation. It now follows —

<span id="viii.xxxiii"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxiii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#028.md)<span
id="viii.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxiii-p2"></span>**28.** And it shall be, if they refuse
to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them,
Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.

<span id="viii.xxxiii-p3"></span>**28.** Et erit, si rennerint ad
sumendum (*hoc est,* sumere) calicem e manu tua ad bibendum, tunc dices
ad *eos (copula enim debetg resolvi in adverbium temporis,*) Sic dicit
Jehova exercituum, Bibendo bibetis.

<span id="viii.xxxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxxiii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxiii-p6"></span>In this verse the Prophet intimates,
that however refractory the nations might be, yet they could effect no
good by their obstinacy, for willing or unwilling they would be
constrained to drink of the cup. But in order to render the matter more
striking, he introduces them as refusing; *If they refuse to take the
cup, thou shalt say to them,* says God, *Drinking ye shall drink* We
have before said that the Prophet was not set a teacher over the
heathens: hence what he declares here appertained not to aliens; but the
whole benefit belonged to God’s Church. Therefore what is said was
spoken for God’s people, even that they might know that as God had
determined to punish the wickedness of men, none of all those threatened
with judgment could possibly escape. Men indeed are often like unruly
horses, who kick and are ferocious, and rage against their rider, and
also bite; but the Prophet shews that God possesses a power sufficient
to quell such obstinacy. He however reminds us how rebellious most would
be, nay, almost all, when chastised by God’s hand. It is indeed a rare
instance when he who has sinned, willingly and calmly submits to God,
and owns that he is justly punished: nay, they who confess that they
have deserved some heavy punishment, do yet complain against God; for
they dread his vengeance, and apprehend not his mercy, and promise not
to themselves any pardon. There is then no wonder that the Prophet
ascribes here to wicked men, both Jews and aliens, so hard and
rebellious a spirit, that they would resist God, and try to extricate
themselves from his hand, in short, that they would by all means attempt
to escape his judgment.

<span id="viii.xxxiii-p7"></span>This is the reason why he says, *If
they refuse to take the cup from thy hand* We hence see that we are not
to take the words in their literal sense: for the Prophet did not speak
to aliens, but what he had in view was the event itself, or rather the
disposition of the people. These nations had indeed some power, and
doubtless they strenuously defended their own safety; and this was the
act of refusing intended by the Prophet. For when the enemy attacked the
Moabites, they did not immediately yield; and the same was the case with
others. Tyre was almost unassailable, for it was situated in the sea;
where it was easy to prevent the approach of enemies. As then they had
resolutely opposed their enemies, they are said to have *refused the cup
from God’s hand,* for they thought that they could keep off the coming
evil. But however inconquerable they thought themselves to be, and how
much soever they trusted in their own power, yet God says, that their
efforts would be in vain and useless: *drinking,* he says, *ye shall
drink*  <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) The reason follows —

<span id="viii.xxxiv"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029.md)<span
id="viii.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p2"></span>**29.** For, lo, I begin to bring evil
on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly
punished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon
all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p3"></span>**29.** Quia ecce in urbe in qua
invocatum nomen meum super eam, ego incipio ad malefaciendum (ad malum
inferendum,) et vos inoxii eritis? Non eritis innoxii; quia gladium ego
advoco super incolas terrae, dicit Jehova exercituum.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxxiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p6"></span>A proof is added by comparing the less
and the greater; for the Prophet reasons thus, — “If God spares not the
city in which he has chosen a temple for himself, and designed his name
to be invoked, how can he spare aliens to whom he has never made any
promise, as he regarded them as strangers? If then the green tree is
consumed, how can the dry remain safe?” This is the import of the
passage. The Apostle uses the same argument in other words; for after
having said that judgment would begin at God’s house, he immediately
shews how dreadful that vengeance of God was to be which awaited his
open enemies! (<span id="viii.xxxiv-p6.1"></span>[1Pe
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md)<span
id="viii.xxxiv-p6.1"></span>.)

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p7"></span>We may hence gather a useful doctrine.
Since God not only declares that he will be indiscriminately the avenger
of wickedness, but also summons in the first place his Church which he
has chosen before his tribunal, its condition may seem to be worse than
that of alien nations. Hence the minds of the godly, when they view
things in this light, might be much depressed. It seems a singular favor
of God, that he unites us to himself; but yet this honor seems only to
lead to punishment: for God connives at the wickedness of heathens, and
seems to bury them in oblivion; but as soon as we fall into sin, we
perceive signs of his wrath. It would then be better to be at a distance
from him, and that he should not be so solicitous in his care for us.
Thus the faithful view the unbelieving as in a better state than
themselves. But this doctrine mitigates all the sharpness of that grief,
which might otherwise occasion great bitterness. For when it is
represented to us, that God begins at his Church, that he may more
heavily punish the unbelieving after having long endured them, and that
they may thus be far more grievously dealt with than the faithful, as
the dry tree is much sooner consumed than the green, — when therefore
this is set before us, we have doubtless a ground for comfort, and that
not small nor common.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p8"></span>We hence see why Jeremiah added this, —
that how much soever the nations would resist God, they would yet be
constrained, willing or unwilling, to yield, as God was more powerful
than they; and for this reason, that since God would not spare his
chosen people, the heathens could by no means escape unpunished, and not
find him to be the judge of the world. Let then this truth be remembered
by us, whenever our flesh leads us to complain or to be impatient; for
it is better for us that God should begin with us, as at length the
wicked shall in their turn be destroyed, and that we should endure
temporal evils, that God may at length raise us up to the enjoyment of
his paternal favor. And for this reason Paul also says, that it is a
demonstration of the just judgment of God when the faithful are exposed
to many evils. (<span id="viii.xxxiv-p8.1"></span>[2 Thess.
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#004.md),
[5](../../../bib/kjv/th2001.htm#005.md)<span
id="viii.xxxiv-p8.1"></span>.): For, when God chastises his own
children, of whose obedience he yet approves, do we not see as in a
glass what is yet concealed? even the dreadful punishment that awaits
all the unbelieving. God, then, represents to us at this day the
destruction of his enemies by the paternal chastisements with which he
visits us; and they are a certain proof or a lively exhibition of that
judgment which the unbelieving fear not, but thoughtlessly deride.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p9"></span>Now, he says, *Behold I begin to bring
evil,* etc. The verb <span id="viii.xxxiv-p9.1"></span>ערה, ero, means
properly to do evil; and it would be a strange thing to say that God
does evil, were it not that common usage explains the meaning. They who
are in any measure acquainted with Scripture know that calamities are
called evils, that is, according to the perceptions of men. The Lord
then is said to bring evil on men, not because he injures them or deals
unjustly and cruelly with them, but because what is adverse to men’s
minds is thought to be by them, and is called evil. Then he says, I
*begin to do evil in the city on which my name is called*  <span
id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md) God’s name is called on a people, when
he promises to be their guardian and defender, and his name is said to
be called upon men, when they betake themselves to his guardianship and
protection.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p11"></span>But we must notice the real meaning, —
that God’s name is called on a people, when they are deemed to be under
his guardianship and keeping; as God’s name is called on the children of
Abraham, because he had promised to be their God; and they boasted that
they were his peculiar people, even on account of their adoption. So
God’s name was called on Jerusalem, because there was the Temple and the
altar; and as God called it his rest or habitation, his name was there
well known, according to what we say in French, *Se reclamer, il se
reclame d’un tel,* that is, such an one claims this or that as his
patron, so that he shelters himself under his protection. So also the
Jews formerly called on God’s name, when they said that they had been
chosen to be his people: nay, this may also be applied to men; for the
name of Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham was called on the twelve tribes, even
for this reason, — because they regarded, when seeking to rely on God’s
covenant, their own origin, for they had descended from the holy
fathers, with whom God had made his covenant, and to whom he had
promised that he would be ever their God. All the Israelites called on
Abraham, not, that they offered him worship, but that, as they were his
offspring, they might feel justly assured that the gratuitous covenant
by which God had adopted them to himself, had been transmitted to them.
But this calling may be also taken in another sense, even because they
daily appeased God by sacrifices and prayers: when they committed their
safety to God, there was a sacrifice always added, and reconciliation
was also promised. Then to be called upon or invoked, <span
id="viii.xxxiv-p11.1"></span>ארקנ, *nukora,* may be taken in this sense,
even that they knew that God was reconciled to them, when they from the
heart repented. Since then God’s name was called upon in that city, how
was it possible that the Gentiles should escape that judgment to which
the holy city was of be exposed?

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p12"></span>But the former view seems to me the
best; and there is no doubt but that God speaks here to the free
adoption by which he had chosen that people for himself: hence was the
invocation or the glorying of which he now speaks.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p13"></span>But as it was difficult to make the
Jews to believe what the Prophet had said, he dwells on the subject, and
repeats what was before sufficiently clear. He not only says, *Shall ye
be treated as innocent?* but he mentions the word twice, *Shall ye by
being treated as innocent be treated as innocent?*  <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) And thus he rebuked the perverse
contumacy by which the heathens were filled, while looking on their
wealth, their number, and other things, and at the same time
disregarding all that the prophets proclaimed at Jerusalem, as though it
was nothing to them. The question is in itself emphatical, “Can ye by
any means be treated as innocent?” The verb <span
id="viii.xxxiv-p14.2"></span>הקנ, *nuke,* means to be innocent, but it
is applied to punishment; as the word <span
id="viii.xxxiv-p14.3"></span>ןוע, *on,* which means iniquity, is used to
designate punishment. So he is said not to be innocent who cannot exempt
himself from God’s judgment, nor be free from it.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p15"></span>He confirms this sentence when he says,
*For a sword am I calling for on all the inhabitants of the earth, saith
Jehovah of hosts* This confirmation is by no means superfluous, for the
insolence of the nations had increased through the forbearance of God,
for they had for a long time, yea, for many ages, been in a quiet state,
and had indulged themselves in their pleasures, and slept as it were in
their own dregs, according to what is said elsewhere. The Prophet then
says now, that God was calling for a sword on all the inhabitants of the
earth. For he had often and in various ways chastised his own people,
while the Gentiles were not in any danger and free from troubles. (<span
id="viii.xxxiv-p15.1"></span>[Jer
48:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#011.md)<span
id="viii.xxxiv-p15.1"></span>.) But he says now that he was calling for
a sword to destroy all those whom he seemed to have forgiven.

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p16"></span>But God is said to have called for men
as well as for a sword; for Nebuchadnezzar is said to have fought under
the banner of God; he is said to have been like a hired soldier. But God
now speaks of the sword, that we might know that it is in his power to
excite and to quell wars whenever it pleases him, and that thus the
sword, though wielded by the hand of man, is not yet called forth by the
will of man, but by the hidden power of God. It follows, —

<span id="viii.xxxv"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md)<span id="viii.xxxv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxv-p2"></span>**30.** Therefore prophesy thou against
them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on
high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily
roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread *the
grapes,* against all the inhabitants of the earth.

<span id="viii.xxxv-p3"></span>**30.** Et tu prophetabis ad eos *(vel,*
contra eos) omnia verba haec, et dices illis, Jehova ab excelso rugiet,
et ex habitaculo sanctitatis suae edet vocem suam; rugiendo rugiet super
habitaculum suum; celeusma (clamorem *potius generaliter)* quasi
prementium torcular respondebit super cunctos incolas terrae.

<span id="viii.xxxv-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxxv-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxxv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxv-p6"></span>The word <span
id="viii.xxxv-p6.1"></span>דדיה*, eidad,* is rendered *celeusma,* a
shout; but some render it a mournful singing; and it often occurs when
the vintage is spoken of. *Celeusma,* as it is well known, is the shout
of sailors. Its etymology is indeed general in its meaning; for <span
id="viii.xxxv-p6.2"></span>κελεύειν is to exhort, to encourage; and then
the noun is exhortation. But as this word is only used as to sailors, I
prefer to adopt the word sound, or a loud noise.

<span id="viii.xxxv-p7"></span>Then he says, *Prophesy thou against them
all these words, and say to them,* etc. I have already reminded you that
no command was given to the Prophet to go to the heathens and to address
each nation among them, or, in other words, to perform among them his
prophetic office. But though he did not move a foot from the city, yet
the influence of his prophecy reached through every region of the earth.
The preaching therefore of Jeremiah was not in vain, for the Jews
understood by what happened, that there was in the language of the holy
man the power of the Spirit for the salvation of all the godly, and for
the destruction of all the unbelieving. It is, then, in this sense that
God bids and commands him again to prophesy against all nations, and to
speak to them, not that he actually addressed them; but when he taught
the Jews, his doctrine had an influence on all nations.

<span id="viii.xxxv-p8"></span>And he says, *Jehovah from on high shall
roar, and from the habitation of his holiness shall send forth his
voice* The metaphor of roaring is sufficiently common. It seems indeed
unsuitable to apply it to God; but we know how tardy men are, and how
they indulge themselves in their own insensibility, even when God
threatens them. Hence God, adopting a hyperbolical mode of speaking,
reproves their stupidity, as he cannot move them except he exceeds the
limits of moderation. This then is the reason why he compares himself to
a lion, not that we are to imagine that there is anything savage or
cruel in him; but as I have said, men cannot be moved, except God puts
on another character and comes forth as a lion, while yet he testifies
not in vain elsewhere, that he is slow to wrath, inclined to mercy and
long-suffering. (<span id="viii.xxxv-p8.1"></span>[Ps.
86:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#005.md),
[15](../../../bib/kjv/psa086.htm#015)<span id="viii.xxxv-p8.1"></span>..md)
Let us then know that the impious contempt, by which most men are
fascinated, is thus condemned*,* when God does as it were in this manner
transform himself, and is constrained to represent himself as a lion.

<span id="viii.xxxv-p9"></span>Roar, then, he says, shall Jehovah, *from
on high, and from the habitation of his holiness shall he send forth his
voice* When he speaks of *on high,* it is probable that heaven is meant;
and *the habitation of his holiness* is often taken for the sanctuary or
the Temple; but in other places, when the same words are repeated,
heaven is also meant by the habitation of his holiness. There is yet
nothing unsuitable, if we say that the Prophet here refers to the
Temple, and that he thus refers to it, that he might raise upwards the
minds of the Jews, who had their thoughts fixed on the visible Temple:
nay, this seems to be required by the context. They indeed foolishly
thought that God was bound to them, because it had been said,

<span id="viii.xxxv-p10"></span>“Here is my rest for ever; here will my
name and power dwell.” (<span id="viii.xxxv-p10.1"></span>[Ps
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md)<span
id="viii.xxxv-p10.1"></span>)

<span id="viii.xxxv-p11"></span>They strangely thought that there was no
God but he who was inclosed in that visible and external sanctuary.
Hence was that pride which Isaiah reproves and severely condemns when he
says,

<span id="viii.xxxv-p12"></span>“Where is the place for my rest? the
heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool; what place then will
you build for me?” (<span id="viii.xxxv-p12.1"></span>[Isa
66:1](../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001.md)<span
id="viii.xxxv-p12.1"></span>.)

<span id="viii.xxxv-p13"></span>The Prophet there does not merely speak,
as many think, against superstition; but he rather beats down that
foolish arrogance, because the people thought that God could never be
separated from the material Temple. And yet it was not for nothing that
the Temple had the name of being the royal throne of God, provided vices
were removed. So now the Prophet, though he exalts God above the
heavens, yet alludes to the visible sanctuary, when he says, “Roar shall
Jehovah from on high, and from the habitation of his holiness shall he
send forth his voice;” that is, though the Gentiles think that God sits
and rests in a corner, yet his throne is in heaven: that he has chosen
for himself a terrestrial habitation, is no reason why the government of
the whole earth should not be in his hands; and therefore he manifests
proofs of his vengeance towards all nations; but for the sake of his
Church he will go forth as it were from his Temple: and he repeats
again, *Roaring he shall roar on his dwelling,* or habitation.  <span
id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) Jerome usually renders the last word
ornament, beauty; and yet this passage sufficiently proves that it
cannot mean any other thing than habitation, as well as many other
passages.

<span id="viii.xxxv-p15"></span>He afterwards proceeds to another
comparison, He *will respond a shout,* as those who tread the wine-press
*against all the inhabitants of the earth* This repetition and variety
confirm what I have said, — that God hyperbolically set forth the
vehemence of his voice in order to fill with terror the secure and the
torpid. And the Prophet seems here to intimate, that though there would
be none to cheer, yet God’s voice would be sufficiently powerful. For
they who tread the wine-press mutually encourage one another by
shouting; one calls on another, and thus they rouse themselves to
diligence. There is also a mutual concord among sailors, when they give
their shouts, as well as among the workmen who tread the grapes in the
wine-press. But though God would have no one to rouse him, yet he
himself would be sufficient; *he will respond a shout*  <span
id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md) The Prophet might have used another
word; but he says, he will *respond* — to whom? even to himself; that
is, though all united to extinguish God’s vengeance, yet he will come
forth a conqueror, nor will he have any need of help. It then follows, —

<span id="viii.xxxvi"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031.md)<span
id="viii.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p2"></span>**31.** A noise shall come *even* to the
ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he
will plead with all flesh; he will give them *that are* wicked to the
sword, saith the LORD.

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p3"></span>**31.** Pervenit (hoc est, perveniet)
sonitus (vel, impetus) ad extremitatem terrae; quia lis Jehovae cum
gentibus, judicium (id est, contentio, vel, disceptatio) ei contra omnem
carnem: impios dabit (tradet) ipsos ad gladium, dicit Jehova.

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxxvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p6"></span>He pursues the same subject; he says
that there would be a dreadful assault, and that it would extend to the
extreme parts of the earth. The word <span
id="viii.xxxvi-p6.1"></span>ןואש, *shaun,* means a noise or sound; but
it is also taken for violence or assault; and either meaning would not
be unsuitable here. *The sound* then, or assault, *shall come to the
extreme parts of the earth* It then follows, that God had a strife with
all nations; and here the Prophet seems to obviate a question that might
have been raised, “What does this mean? that God will suddenly raise a
commotion, after having been quiet and still for so many ages, without
giving any symptom of his vengeance?” For we have said that the nations
here mentioned had been long in a tranquil state. Hence the Prophet
answers this unexpressed objection and says, that God *had a contention*
with them.

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p7"></span>The time of contending is not always: he
who does not immediately bring his adversary before the judge, but deals
kindly with him, and seeks to obtain amicably from him what is right,
does not thereby forego what is justly due to him; but when he finds
that the contumacy of his adversary is such that his kind dealing
effects nothing, he may then litigate with him. The same thing is now
expressed by the Prophet, even that God would now *contend with the
nations and dispute with all flesh* God is indeed, properly speaking,
the judge of the world; and there is no arbiter or a judge in heaven or
on earth to be found before whom he can dispute; but yet this mode of
speaking ought to be especially noticed; for God thus silences all those
complaints which men are wont to make against him. Even they who are a
hundred times proved guilty, yet complain against God when he severely
punishes them, and they say that they are made to suffer more than they
deserve. Hence God for this reason says, that when he punishes he does
not exercise a tyrannical power, but that he does as it were dispute
with sinners. At the same time he sets forth his own goodness by
representing the end he has in view; for what he regards in rigidly
punishing wickedness, is nothing else than to obtain his own rights; and
as he cannot secure these by kind means, he extorts them as it were by
the aid of laws.  <span id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md)

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p11"></span>Let us then observe, that nothing is
detracted from God’s power and authority, when it is said, that he
disputes or contends with men; but that in this way all those clamors
are checked which the ungodly raise against him, as though he raged
immoderately against them, and also that thus the end of all punishment
is pointed out, even that God condescends to assume the character of an
opponent, and proposes nothing else than to require what is reasonable
and just, like him who having a cause to try before the judge, would
willingly agree beforehand, if possible, with his adversary; but as he
sees no hope, he has recourse to that remedy. So God contends with us;
for except we were wholly irreclaimable, we might be restored to his
favor; and reconciliation would be ready for us, were we only to allow
him his rights.

<span id="viii.xxxvii"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxvii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.xxxvii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou
seekest continually in various ways to restore us to thyself, — O grant,
that we may not by our untameable perverseness resist thy holy and kind
admonitions, nor continue torpid in our drowsiness, but anxiously flee
to thee, and so humbly solicit pardon, that we may thus shew that we
really and habitually repent, so that thy name may in every way be
glorified, until we shall come into thy celestial glory, through Christ
Jesus our Lord. — Amen.

id="viii.xxxix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxix-p2"></span>**32.** Thus saith the LORD of hosts,
Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind
shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p3"></span>**32.** Sic dicit Jehova exercituum,
Ecce malum egredietur a gente in gentem, et tempestas magna excitabitur
a lateribus terrae.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xxxix-p5"></span><span id="viii.xxxix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxix-p6"></span>Jeremiah goes on with the subject which
we began to explain in the last Lecture. He had before prophesied of
God’s judgments, which were nigh many nations, and which referred to
almost all the countries near and known to the Jews, and to some that
were afar off. The substance of what has been said is, — that God, who
had long spared the wickedness of men, would now become an avenger, so
that it might openly appear, that though he had deferred punishment, he
would not allow the ungodly to escape, for they would in proper time and
season be called to give an account.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p7"></span>To the same purpose is what he adds
here, *go forth shall evil from nation to nation* The explanation by
some is, that one nation would make war on another, and that thus they
would destroy themselves by mutual conflicts; and this meaning may be
admitted. It seems, however, to me that the Prophet meant another thing,
even that God’s vengeance would advance like a contagion through all
lands. And according to this view he adds a metaphor, or the simile of a
storm, or a tempest, or a whirlwind; for when a tempest arises, it
confines not itself to one region, but spreads itself far and wide. So
the Prophet now shews, that though God would not at one time punish all
the nations, he would yet be eventually the judge of all, for he would
pass far and wide like a storm. Thus, then, I interpret the passage, not
that the nations would make war with one another, but that when God had
executed his judgment on one nation, he would afterwards advance to
another, so that he would make no end until he had completed what
Jeremiah had foretold.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p8"></span>And this view appears still more evident
from the second clause of the verse, for this cannot be explained of
intestine wars, *raised shall be a tempest from the sides of the earth*
We hence see that the meaning is, that God would not be wearied after
having begun to summon men to judgment, but would include the most
remote, who thought themselves beyond the reach of danger. As when a
tempest rises, it seems only to threaten a small portion of the country,
but it soon spreads itself and covers the whole heavens; so also God
says, that his vengeance would come *from the sides of the earth,* that
is, from the remotest places, so that no distance would prevent the
completion of what he had foretold by his servant.

<span id="viii.xxxix-p9"></span>But this may also be accommodated to our
case; for whenever we see that this or that nation is afflicted by any
calamity, we ought to remember this truth, that God seasonably warns us,
that we may not abuse his patience, but anticipate him before his
scourge passes from some side of the earth to us. In short, as soon as
God manifests any sign of his wrath, it ought instantly to occur to us,
that it may spread in a moment through all the extremities of the earth,
so that no corner would be exempted. For if he makes known his power in
the whirlwind or the storm, how will it be, when he makes a fuller and a
nearer manifestation of his judgment, by stretching forth his hand as it
were in a visible manner? This, then, is the import of this verse. It
afterwards follows, —

<span id="viii.xl"></span>

<span id="viii.xl-p1"></span><span id="viii.xl-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#033.md)<span id="viii.xl-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xl-p2"></span>**33.** And the slain of the LORD shall be
at that day from *one* end of the earth even unto the *other* end of the
earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they
shall be dung upon the ground.

<span id="viii.xl-p3"></span>**33.** Et erunt interfecti Jehovae, in die
illa ab extremitate terrae ad extremitatem terrae: non plangentur, et
non colligentur, et non sepelientur; stercus in supereficie terrae erunt
(*id est,* pro stercore.)

<span id="viii.xl-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xl-p5"></span><span id="viii.xl-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xl-p6"></span>This verse explains what I have just said;
and hence it also appears that the Prophet did not speak of mutual
slaughters inflicted by one nation on another, but that he only declared
that God’s wrath would spread like a storm so as to extend to all
nations and lands. The Prophet no doubt continues the same subject; and
we see why he says here, *And the slain, of Jehovah shall be in that
day,* etc.; he calls our attention to God alone; he will speak otherwise
hereafter, he does not set here before us the ministers of God’s
vengeance, but God himself as acting by himself.

<span id="viii.xl-p7"></span>Hence he says, *the slain of Jehovah;* some
read, “the wounded;” and <span id="viii.xl-p7.1"></span>ללח*, chelal,*
means to wound and to kill; but “the slain” is more suitable here. *The
slain* then *of Jehovah shall be from one extremity of the earth to the
other;* as though he had said, that God would not be satisfied with
punishing three or four nations, but would shew himself the judge of all
the countries of the earth.

<span id="viii.xl-p8"></span>Now this passage is worthy of special
notice; for we often wonder why God connives at so many crimes committed
by men, which none of us would tolerate. But if we consider how dreadful
was the tempest of which the Prophet now speaks, we ought to know that
God rests for a time, in order that the ungodly and the wicked might be
the less excusable. It was at the same time doubtless a sad spectacle,
when so many regions and provinces were unceasingly suffering various
calamities, when one nation thought itself better off than its
neighbors, but presently found itself more cruelly treated. And yet this
was generally the case, for God’s wrath extended to the extremities of
the earth.

<span id="viii.xl-p9"></span>He amplifies the atrocity of the evil by
mentioning three things, — *They shall not be lamented, nor gathered,
nor buried; but they shall be as dung, and shall thus lie on the face of
the earth* We have said in other places that lamentation does no good to
the dead; but as it is what humanity requires, the want of it is rightly
deemed a temporal punishment. So when any one is deprived of burial, it
is certainly nothing to the dead if his body is not laid in a grave; for
we know that God’s holy servants have often been either burnt or hung or
exposed to wild beasts; and the whole Church complains that dead bodies
were lying around Jerusalem and became food to the birds of heaven and
to the beasts of the earth. But these things do not disprove the fact,
that burial is an evidence of God’s paternal kindness towards men. For
why has he appointed that men should be buried rather than brute
animals, except that he designed it to be an intimation of an immortal
life? As, then, burial is a sign of God’s favor, it is no wonder that he
often declares to the reprobate that their dead bodies would be cast
away, so as not to be honored, with a grave.

<span id="viii.xl-p10"></span>But we must remember this truth, — that
temporal punishments happen in common to God’s children and to aliens;
God extends without any difference temporal punishments to his own
children and to the unbelieving, and that in order that it may be made
evident that our hope ought not to be fixed on this world. But however
this may be, it is yet true that when God punishes the unbelieving in
this way, he adds at the same time some remark by which it may be
*understood,* that it happens not in vain nor undesignedly, that those
are deprived of burial, who deserve that God should exterminate them
from the earth, and that their memory should be obliterated, so that
they should not be connected among men. But we have said also in another
place, that such expressions admit of another meaning, which yet is not
at variance with the former, but connected with it, and that is, that so
great would be the slaughter, that none would be left to shew this
kindness to his friend or to his neighbor or to his brother. For when
four or ten or a hundred die, they may be buried; but when God slays by
the sword a great number in one day, none are found to take care of
burying the dead, as few remain alive, and even they dread their
enemies. When therefore the prophets say that those whom God slew would
be without lamentation and burial, they intimate that so great would be
the number, that all would lie on the ground; for no one would dare to
perform this humane act towards the dead, and were all to do their
utmost, they would not be able, as the number would be so great.

<span id="viii.xl-p11"></span>Thus Jeremiah confirms what we have said,
— that God’s vengeance would extend to all lands and all nations, so as
to involve in ruin the nobles as well as the common people, and to leave
remaining but a small number.

<span id="viii.xl-p12"></span>For the same purpose he adds what follows,
that they would be as *dung on the face of the earth* This is added by
way of contempt. It was then hardly credible, that so many illustrious,
wealthy, and powerful nations could thus in so short a time be
destroyed. But the Prophet, in order to shake off this false conceit,
says that they would become like dung, that however great their dignity
and power, their wealth and strength, might be, they could not yet
escape the hand of God, for he would reduce to nothing the glory of the
whole world. We now perceive the real meaning of the Prophet. It then
follows —

<span id="viii.xli"></span>

<span id="viii.xli-p1"></span><span id="viii.xli-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#034.md)<span id="viii.xli-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xli-p2"></span>**34.** Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and
wallow yourselves *in the ashes*, ye principal of the flock: for the
days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye
shall fall like a pleasant vessel.

<span id="viii.xli-p3"></span>**34.** Ulalate pastores, et clamate, et
volutate vos eximii gregis; quia impleti sunt dies vestri ad mactandum,
et dispersiones vestrae (vel, afflictiones, confractiones;) et cadetis
tanquam vas desiderii (id est, pretiosum.)

<span id="viii.xli-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xli-p5"></span><span id="viii.xli-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xli-p6"></span>I doubt not but that the Prophet now turns
his discourse especially to his own nation, which interpreters have not
observed, and hence have not understood the meaning of the Prophet. He
prophesied of God’s judgments, that the Jews might know that they in
vain looked for impunity, as the Lord would not pardon the ignorant and
destitute of all true knowledge, who might have pretended their
ignorance as an excuse; and also that this comfort might support the
minds of the godly, that the heathens, involved in the same guilt, would
be subjected to the same judgment; and lastly, that knowing the
difference between them and other nations, they might flee to God’s
mercy and be encouraged to repent by entertaining a hope of pardon.
After having then treated this general subject, he now returns to the
people over whom he was appointed a teacher. He might indeed have
declared from an eminence what was to take place through the whole
earth; for so extensive was the office of a herald which God had
conferred on him. He might then by the virtue of his office have
denounced ruin on all nations; but he ought not to neglect his special
care for the chosen people. And so I explain this passage; for he now
again directs his discourse to the Jews.

<span id="viii.xli-p7"></span>Hence he says, *Howl, ye pastors, and cry,
etc*. By pastors he means the king and his counsellors, the priests and
other rulers; and by *the choice of the flock* he seems to understand
the rich, whose condition was better than that of the common people.
Some in a more refined manner consider the *choice* of the flock to have
been those void of knowledge, unlike the scribes and priests and the
king’s counsellors; but this view seems not to be well-founded. I
therefore adopt what is more probable, — that the *choice of the flock*
were those who were rich and high in public esteem, and yet held no
office of authority in the commonwealth or in the Church. However this
may be, the Prophet shews, that as soon as God began to put forth his
hand to punish the Jews, there would be no ranks of men exempt from
lamentation, for he would begin with the pastors and the choice of the
flock.

<span id="viii.xli-p8"></span>He adds that *their days were fulfilled*
Here he indirectly condemns that wicked security which had for a long
time hardened them, so that they despised all threatenings; for God had
now for many years called on them, and had sent his Prophets one after
another; when they saw the execution of judgment suspended over them,
they considered it only as a bugbear, “Well, let the prophets continue
to pronounce their terrors, if they will do so, but nothing will come of
them.” Thus the ungodly turned God’s forbearance into an occasion for
their obstinacy. As then this evil was common among the Jews, the
Prophet now says, by way of anticipation, that *their days were
fulfilled* For there is to be understood this contrast, that God had
spared them, not that he had his eyes closed, or that he had not
observed their wicked deeds, but that he wished to give them time to
repent; but when he saw that their wickedness was unhealable, he now
says that their days were completed. And he adds, *to be killed* or
slain. I wonder that learned interpreters render this, “that they may
slay one another.” There is no need of adding anything, for the Prophet
meant to express no such sentiment, nor to restrict what he denounces
here on the Jews, to intestine or domestic wars; on the contrary, we
know that they were slain by aliens, even by the Chaldeans. This sense
then is forced, and is also inconsistent with history. It is added, *and
your dispersions*  <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) *also* are
fulfilled, or your breakings. The verb <span
id="viii.xli-p16.1"></span>ףופ, *puts,* means to scatter or to
dissipate, and also to afflict, to tear; and the sense of tearing or
breaking is what I prefer here. And he adds, *And ye shall fall as a
precious vessel* This simile appears not to be very appropriate, for why
should he not rather compare them to an earthen vessel, which is of no
value and easily broken? But his object was to point out the difference
in their two conditions, that though God had honored them with singular
privileges, yet all their excellency would not keep them safe; for it
often happens that a vessel, however precious, is broken. And he speaks
not of gold or silver vessels, but of fragile vessels, once in great
esteem. That he might then more grievously wound them, he says that they
had been hitherto precious vessels, or a precious vessel; for he speaks
of them all in the singular number, and that they were to be broken; and
thus he confirms what I said on the last verse, that hypocrites in vain
trusted in their present fortune, or in the superior blessings of God,
for he could turn to shame whatever glory he had conferred on them. It
follows, —

<span id="viii.xlii"></span>

<span id="viii.xlii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xlii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:35](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#035.md)<span id="viii.xlii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlii-p2"></span>**35.** And the shepherds shall have no
way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.

<span id="viii.xlii-p3"></span>**35.** Et peribit fuga a pastoribus, et
evasio ab eximiis gregis.

<span id="viii.xlii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xlii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xlii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlii-p6"></span>He explains what we have now observed,
for he had bidden the pastors to howl and the choice of the flock to
roll or to prostrate themselves in the dust; he now gives the reason,
even because they could not preserve their lives, no, not by an
ignominious flight. It is indeed very miserable, when any one cannot
otherwise secure his life than by seeking exile, where he must be poor,
and needy, and despised; but even this is denied by the Prophet to the
king and his counsellors, as well as to the rich through the whole city
and the whole land: *Perish,* he *says,* shall *flight* from them. This
mode of speaking is common in Hebrew:

<span id="viii.xlii-p7"></span>“Flight,” says David, “has perished from
me,” *  
*(<span id="viii.xlii-p7.2"></span>[Ps
142:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa142.htm#005.md)<span
id="viii.xlii-p7.2"></span>;)

<span id="viii.xlii-p8"></span>that is, I find no way of escape. So
here, *Perish shall flight;* that is, while looking here and there in
order to escape from danger, they shall be so shut up on every side,
that they shall necessarily fall a prey to their enemies. It follows, —

<span id="viii.xliii"></span>

<span id="viii.xliii-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xliii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:36](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#036.md)<span
id="viii.xliii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xliii-p2"></span>**36.** A voice of the cry of the
shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, *shall be
heard:* for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture.

<span id="viii.xliii-p3"></span>**36.** Vox clamoris pastorum et
ululatus eximoirum gregis, quia perdidit jehova pascua eorum.

<span id="viii.xliii-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xliii-p5"></span><span id="viii.xliii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xliii-p6"></span>He not merely repeats the same thing in
other words, but adds also something more grievous, that God would
render desolate their pastures. He pursues the same metaphor; for as he
used this comparison in speaking of the king’s counsellors and the
priests, so now he does the same; and what he means by pastures is the
community, the people, in the city and in the country;  <span
id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) as though he had said, that they had
hitherto ruled over that land which was rich and fertile, and in which
they enjoyed power and dignity, but that now they would be deprived of
all these benefits. He afterwards adds, —

<span id="viii.xliv"></span>

<span id="viii.xliv-p1"></span><span
id="viii.xliv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#037.md)<span id="viii.xliv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xliv-p2"></span>**37.** And the peaceable habitations are
cut down because of the fierce anger of the LORD.

<span id="viii.xliv-p3"></span>**37.** Et peribunt (*vel,* succidentur,
*vertunt* alii) pascua pacis (tuguria pacis, *hos est,* tranquilla) a
facie excandescentiae *(vel,* furoris) irae Jehovae.

<span id="viii.xliv-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xliv-p5"></span><span id="viii.xliv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xliv-p6"></span>He goes on with the same subject, that
the tents, previously tranquil, would perish or be destroyed. And he
designedly calls their dwellings peaceable; for the Jews, having found
that their enemies had not before disturbed them, still promised to
themselves the same good fortune in future.

<span id="viii.xliv-p7"></span>And the faithful indeed do act thus
rightly, and justly conclude from God’s previous benefits that he will
be kind to them as he had ever been so; but hypocrites, though they
repent not, yet absurdly think that God is bound to them; and though
they daily provoke his wrath, they yet securely continue in their
confidence of having peace. Since God then had until that time deferred
the grievousness of his wrath, the Prophet says, that though their tents
had been peaceable,  <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md) yet they
could not be exempted from *destruction* as soon as the indignation of
God’s wrath went forth. It might have been enough to make use of one of
these words, either of <span id="viii.xliv-p8.2"></span>ןורח, *cherun,*
or of <span id="viii.xliv-p8.3"></span>ףא, *aph;* but the Prophet used
the two, indignation and wrath,  <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md)
in order that he might fill the wicked with more terror; for as they
were obstinate in their wickedness, so they were not moved except God
doubled his strokes and set forth the extremity of his wrath. It
follows, —

<span id="viii.xlv"></span>

<span id="viii.xlv-p1"></span><span id="viii.xlv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
25:38](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#038.md)<span id="viii.xlv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlv-p2"></span>**38.** He hath forsaken his covert, as
the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the
oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.

<span id="viii.xlv-p3"></span>**38.** Dereliquit tanquam leo
tabernaculum suum; quia redacta est terra eorum in vastitatem a facie
irae oppressoris (*aut,* praedonis) et a facie excandescentiae irae
ejus.

<span id="viii.xlv-p4"></span> 

<span id="viii.xlv-p5"></span><span id="viii.xlv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlv-p6"></span>The Prophet in the last verse reminds us,
that the Jews in vain trusted in God’s protection, for he would forsake
his own Temple as well as the city. It was as it were a common saying
among them,

<span id="viii.xlv-p7"></span>“He has said, This is my rest for ever.”
(<span id="viii.xlv-p7.1"></span>[Ps
132:14](../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#014.md)<span
id="viii.xlv-p7.1"></span>.)

<span id="viii.xlv-p8"></span>But hypocrites did not consider that he
could still stand faithful to his promises, though he did not suffer
them to go unpunished. They could not therefore connect these two things
together, — that God would be always mindful of his covenant, — and that
still he would be the judge of his Church.

<span id="viii.xlv-p9"></span>This is the reason why the Prophet now
says, that God would *forsake as a lion his tabernacle* Some give this
explanation, that he would go forth for a short time, as hungry lions
are wont to do; but this is too far-fetched. I therefore have no doubt
that God sets forth his power under the character of a lion; for the
Jews would have been feared by all their enemies, had not God changed as
it were his station. But as they had expelled him by their vices, so
that he had no more an habitation among them, hence it was that they
became exposed to the plunder of all nations. The import of the passage
then is, that as long as God dwelt in the Temple he was like a lion, so
that by his roaring alone he kept at a distance all nations and defended
the children of Abraham; but that now, though he had not changed his
nature, nor was there anything taken away or diminished as to his power,
yet the Jews would not be safe, for he would forsake them.  <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md)

<span id="viii.xlv-p11"></span>And the reason is added, which clearly
confirms what has been said, *For their land* (he refers to the Jews)
*shall be desolate* But whence this desolation to Judea, except that it
was deprived of God’s protection? For had God defended it, he could have
repelled all enemies by a nod only. But as he had departed, hence it was
that they found an easy access, and that the land was thus reduced to a
waste.

<span id="viii.xlv-p12"></span>It is added, *on account of the
indignation of the oppressor.* Some render the last word “dove,” but not
correctly. They yet have devised a refined meaning, that God is called a
dove because of his kindness and meekness, though his wrath is excited,
for he is forced to put on the character of another through the
perverseness of men, when he sees that he can do nothing by his
benevolence towards them. But this is a far-fetched speculation. The
verb <span id="viii.xlv-p12.1"></span>הני, *inc,* means to oppress, to
take by force; and as it is most frequently taken in a bad sense, I
prefer to apply it here to enemies rather than to God himself. There are
many indeed who explain it of God, but I cannot embrace their view; for
Jeremiah joins together two clauses, that God would forsake his Temple,
as when a lion departs from his covert, and also that enemies would come
and find the place naked and empty; in short, he intimates that they
would be exposed to the will and plunder of their enemies, because they
would be at that time destitute of God’s aid. And as he had before
spoken of the indignation of God’s wrath, so now he ascribes the same to
their enemies, and justly so, for they were to execute his judgments;
what properly belongs to God is ascribed to them, because they were to
be his ministers.  <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md)

<span id="viii.xlvi"></span>

<span id="viii.xlvi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="viii.xlvi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast
been pleased to gather us, so that we may be under thy protection and
care, and to offer thyself to be our Shepherd, and even to exhibit
thyself as such through thine only-begotten Son, — O grant, that we may
willingly obey thee and hearken to the voice of that Shepherd whom thou
hast set over us, so that we may be preserved to the end by thy goodness
and power, and never wander from thee nor be carried away by our lusts,
but so continue under the shadow of thy wings, that thou mayest be ever
present with us and check our enemies, so that we may remain safe under
thy protection throughout life, as well as in death, through the same
Christ Jesus our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="viii.v-p7"></span> This is not quite correct: the verbs are

<span id="fn_129"></span>[130](cc19007.htm#fr_129.md) <span
id="viii.viii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="viii.viii-p16"></span> The three words are by the Sept. and
Arab. rendered “extinction — hissing — perpetual reproach;” by the
Vulg., “astonishment — hissing — perpetual solitudes;” by the Targ.,
“waste — astonishment — perpetual desolations;” and by the Syr.,
“astonishment — hissing — waste for ever.” The first word, <span
id="viii.viii-p16.1"></span>המש, means first, waste or desolation, and
then what waste occasions, wonder or astonishment. It evidently means
the latter here, as desolation is expressed by the last word; it is so
rendered by the Vulg. the Syr., and in our version and by Blayney and
others. The two words are again found together in the eleventh verse.
Here the order, as often is the case, is inverted; the effect is first
mentioned, then the cause: the cause of astonishment and hissing would
be the desolations. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_130"></span>[131](cc19007.htm#fr_130.md) <span
id="viii.ix-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.ix-p7"></span> As this verse is connected with the
foregoing, the <span id="viii.ix-p7.1"></span>ו would be better rendered
for, —

<span id="viii.ix-p8"></span>**10.** For I will make to cease from among
them The voice of exultation and the voice of joy, The voice of the
bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, The voice of the millstone, and
the light of the lamp.

<span id="viii.ix-p9"></span>The time for grinding was the morning; the
earliest thing in the morning was this work, and was done every day. The
time for the light of the lamp was the evening; when this disappears, it
is an evidence that there are no inhabitants. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[132](cc19007.htm#fr_131.md) <span
id="viii.x-p7.3"></span>

<span id="viii.x-p8"></span> As the first word means waste or
desolation, and means nothing else, and as the second word means
astonishment as well as desolation, the rendering of our version, and of
Calvin, must be right. As it is commonly the case, their order is here
inverted, being different from the order in which they are found in
verse ninth. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[133](cc19007.htm#fr_132.md) <span
id="viii.xiv-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xiv-p9"></span> Had the book been intended, the <span
id="viii.xiv-p9.1"></span>רשא, which, would have been followed by a
pronoun after the verb with the preposition <span
id="viii.xiv-p9.2"></span>ב, in, prefixed to it; for this is the idiom
of the language. All the versions render the phrase, “whatever Jeremiah
prophesied,” etc. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_133"></span>[134](cc19007.htm#fr_133.md) <span
id="viii.xv-p7.6"></span>

<span id="viii.xv-p8"></span> A reference to <span
id="viii.xv-p8.2"></span>[Jer
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.xv-p8.2"></span>,
will enable us to understand this passage. The words are alike. “Many
nations and great kings” in that verse mean the conquerors of the king
of Babylon; and so they mean the same here, no doubt. “All the nations”
in the preceding verse were “all the families of the north,” mentioned
in <span id="viii.xv-p8.3"></span>[Jer
25:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009.md)<span id="viii.xv-p8.3"></span>,
who were subject to the king of Babylon; and “them” at the beginning of
this verse are these nations, which are here spoken of as being
subjected to bondage or to servitude, while in <span
id="viii.xv-p8.4"></span>[Jer
27:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer027.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.xv-p8.4"></span>,
the king of Babylon himself is mentioned.

<span id="viii.xv-p9"></span>The verb <span
id="viii.xv-p9.1"></span>רבע, when followed by <span
id="viii.xv-p9.2"></span>ב, means invariably to enslave, to reduce to
bondage, to bring into subjection, or to subdue. Then the verse should
be thus rendered, —

<span id="viii.xv-p10"></span>For make them, even these, to serve,  
Shall many nations and great kings;

<span id="viii.xv-p11"></span>And I will render to them according to
their work, According to the doing of their own hands. This is the
meaning given by the Targ.; the Vulg. and the Syr. render the verb
incorrectly, though in both the pronoun them is made to refer to the
nations in the preceding verse. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[135](cc19007.htm#fr_134.md) <span
id="viii.xvi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvi-p8"></span> I conceive that the sentence may be thus
rendered, —

<span id="viii.xvi-p9"></span>Take the cup of the wine of fury, even
this, from my hand.

<span id="viii.xvi-p10"></span>So do Gataker and Venema render the
sentence, referring “this” to the cup and not to “fury.” The word for
“fury” is heat; it means hot, boiling, or burning wrath, — rendered
“fury” by the Vulg. and Syr., — “malediction” by the Targ., and
“unmixed” (the cup of this unmixed wine) by the Sept. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[136](cc19007.htm#fr_135.md) <span
id="viii.xvi-p12.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvi-p13"></span> Literally, “whom I send thee to them;”
which the Sept. have rendered almost word for word, <span
id="viii.xvi-p13.1"></span>πρὸς ἅ (ἔθνη)-πρὸς αὐτούς; but the first,
<span id="viii.xvi-p13.2"></span>πρὸς is not in the original. This was
an attempt to transplant the peculiarity of one language to another,
which is often the ease with the Septuagint. The Welsh is literally the
same with the Hebrew. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_136"></span>[137](cc19007.htm#fr_136.md) <span
id="viii.xvii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xvii-p8"></span> The Versions vary as to these two verbs:
the best rendering is, —

<span id="viii.xvii-p9"></span>And they shall drink and reel; And they
shall be distracted on account of the sword, Which I shall send among
them.

<span id="viii.xvii-p10"></span>Blayney’s version is nearly the same,
“drink and stagger and be out of their wits;” but it is better to
connect “the sword” with the latter verb only. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[138](cc19007.htm#fr_137.md) <span
id="viii.xix-p12.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xix-p13"></span> Blayney assents to this conjecture, and
not without some reason: he considers that God’s words are broken off at
the end of <span id="viii.xix-p13.1"></span>[Jer
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md)<span
id="viii.xix-p13.1"></span>, and are not resumed till the latter part of
<span id="viii.xix-p13.2"></span>[Jer
25:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#026.md)<span
id="viii.xix-p13.2"></span>, where God again continues his words thus,
“and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.” All the intermediate
verses he includes in a parenthesis, and regards them as written either
by Baruch or by the Prophet himself after the destruction of Jerusalem,
when his prophecies were compiled: and this accounts for the words, “as
at this day.” But Gateker rejects this view, and considers this prophecy
to have been announced after the Chaldean irruption in the third or
fourth year of Jehoiakim, referred to in <span
id="viii.xix-p13.3"></span>[Da
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#001.md)<span id="viii.xix-p13.3"></span>.
The devastation then produced was great, and finally completed in the
reign of Zedekiah. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[139](cc19007.htm#fr_138.md) <span
id="viii.xx-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xx-p8"></span> Gataker observes that servants, princes,
and people are mentioned together with the king, in order to preclude
every hope of escape; for the king might have been removed, and the
country left without being much disturbed. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[140](cc19007.htm#fr_139.md) <span
id="viii.xxiii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxiii-p11"></span> Venema and Blayney connect these words
with the former verse, and consider that the mixed people in Egypt are
meant; and this is most probable. So the Sept. “and all that are mixed
with them.” The Syr. is, “and all the borders of it,” that is Egypt. The
Vulg. is a paraphrase, “and the whole generally.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[141](cc19007.htm#fr_140.md) <span
id="viii.xxv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxv-p10"></span> The kings of Judah and the kings of
other countries are found also mentioned; and the reason seems to be,
that the calamities threatened to them did not come at once on one
generation, but gradually on successive generations. Such was the case
with respect to Judah, and also with other kingdoms; successive attacks
were made until they were at last wholly subjugated.

<span id="viii.xxv-p11"></span>As we find in <span
id="viii.xxv-p11.1"></span>[Isa
23:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa023.htm#002.md)<span id="viii.xxv-p11.1"></span>,
the people of Tyre called “the inhabitants of the isle,” we may render
the verse thus, —

<span id="viii.xxv-p12"></span>**22.** And all the kings of Tyre, and
all the kings of Sidon, even all the kings of the isle which is by the
side of the sea.

<span id="viii.xxv-p13"></span>This repetition was made on account of
the power and wealth of Tyre, a place thought impregnable. See <span

<span id="fn_142"></span>[143](cc19007.htm#fr_142.md) <span
id="viii.xxvi-p7.4"></span>

<span id="viii.xxvi-p8"></span> This is not quite correct. Dedan — there
are two of this name mentioned, <span id="viii.xxvi-p8.1"></span>[Ge
10:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen010.htm#007.md)<span id="viii.xxvi-p8.1"></span>,

25:3](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#003.md)<span id="viii.xxvi-p8.2"></span>;
the latter is probably meant here. Tema was one of Ishmael’s race, <span

22:21](../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#021.md)<span
id="viii.xxvi-p8.6"></span>; and of this family was Elihu, the most
remarkable of Job’s friends; he was a Buzite. <span

id="viii.xxviii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxviii-p7"></span> Blayney considers Zimri to be the same
with Zimran, one of Abraham’s sons by Keturah, and he and his brethren
were sent to “the east country.” (<span
id="viii.xxviii-p7.1"></span>[Gen.
25:2](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#002.md),
[6](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#006.md)<span
id="viii.xxviii-p7.1"></span>.) The Zameroeni, mentioned by Pliny as
inhabiting some part of Arabia, were probably the descendants of Zimri.
— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[145](cc19007.htm#fr_144.md) <span
id="viii.xxix-p9.10"></span>

<span id="viii.xxix-p10"></span> Both Venema and Gataker regard this as
one of the vagaries of the Rabbins, though countenanced by Jerome.
Various have been the reasons assigned for calling Babylon Sheshach.
Some derive the word from <span id="viii.xxix-p10.1"></span>שיש, which
means in Syriac, to dwell, to rest, and consider <span
id="viii.xxix-p10.2"></span>K a formative letter; and then they render
it “a great habitation.” Others derive it from an Arabic root which
means to be swift or to advance swiftly — the character of the sun or
fire, which was deified. The third party say, that it signifies a feast,
like the Saturnalian, which the Chaldeans <span
id="viii.xxix-p10.3"></span>σακέαν; for it was during a feast that
Babylon was taken, so that there was thus an intimation given of this by
calling him the king of this feast. See <span
id="viii.xxix-p10.4"></span>[Jer
51:39](../../../bib/kjv/jer051.htm#039.md)<span
id="viii.xxix-p10.4"></span>

<span id="viii.xxix-p11"></span>But the most probable account is that
given by Gataker, that Babylon was thus called from an idol in great
repute in the city, named Sheshach or Shach, and that it was on the
festival of this idol that the city was taken. This accounts for this
name being given to it, when its destruction is especially referred to.
Mishael, which terminated with God’s name, was changed into Meschach, or
rather Mishach, which contained the name of the Babylonian idol. (<span
id="viii.xxix-p11.1"></span>[Da
1:7](../../../bib/kjv/dan001.htm#007.md)<span
id="viii.xxix-p11.1"></span>.) — *Ed*

<span id="fn_145"></span>[146](cc19007.htm#fr_145.md) <span
id="viii.xxxii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxii-p5"></span> It is better, as in <span
id="viii.xxxii-p5.1"></span>[Jer
25:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#016.md)<span
id="viii.xxxii-p5.1"></span>, to connect “the sword” with this last
verb: the verse then would read thus, —

<span id="viii.xxxii-p6"></span>**27.** And say thou to them, thus saith
Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Drink ye and be drunken, vomit also
and fall; and ye shall not rise up before the sword which I shall send
among you.

<span id="viii.xxxii-p7"></span>The representation is, that they would
be so drunken as not to keep on their legs, and that having fallen they
would not be able to rise to make any resistance to the attack made upon
them. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_146"></span>[147](cc19007.htm#fr_146.md) <span
id="viii.xxxiii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxiii-p8"></span> Or we may render the words literally
as they are, —

<span id="viii.xxxiii-p9"></span>Drink ye, — ye shall drink.

<span id="viii.xxxiii-p10"></span>The first verb is an imperative, and
the second is in the future tense, and may be rendered, “ye must drink,”
for the future may thus be often rendered. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[148](cc19007.htm#fr_147.md) <span
id="viii.xxxiv-p9.2"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p10"></span> The literal rendering is, “which is
called my name on it:” and the Sept. tried to imitate the Hebrew idiom
by retaining “on it,” inconsistently with the Greek idiom; but the Vulg.
retains the character of the Latin, and renders the phrase, “on which my
name is called.” The Welsh, according to its idiom, is literally the
Hebrew. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[149](cc19007.htm#fr_148.md) <span
id="viii.xxxiv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxiv-p14"></span> Literally it is, — “And ye — shall ye,
being acquitted, be acquitted? ye shall not be acquitted.” The reference
is to a judicial process, which is distinctly mentioned in the 31st
verse (<span id="viii.xxxiv-p14.1"></span>[Jer
25:31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#031.md)<span
id="viii.xxxiv-p14.1"></span>). — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[150](cc19007.htm#fr_149.md) <span
id="viii.xxxv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxv-p14"></span> Or “against his habitation,” or
“resting-place,” as rendered by Blayney; “his place,” is the Sept.; and
““his habitation,” is the Syr. The Vulg. is Jerome’s version. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[151](cc19007.htm#fr_150.md) <span
id="viii.xxxv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxv-p16"></span> This verse seems to refer only to the
Jews, and the following to the nations, as to their doom. God is
represented in the latter part of this verse as responding to the shout
of all the nations against his own people, —

<span id="viii.xxxv-p17"></span>Roaring he will roar against his own
habitation; A shout like that of treaders of grapes Will he respond to
all the inhabitants of the earth.

<span id="viii.xxxv-p18"></span>This rendering prevents the necessity of
giving an unusual meaning to <span id="viii.xxxv-p18.1"></span>לא, as it
is commonly done. Coccius takes this view of the passage. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_151"></span>[152](cc19007.htm#fr_151.md) <span
id="viii.xxxvi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p8"></span> The terms are legal terms, —

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p9"></span>**31.** Gone has the sound to the
extremity of the earth; For a contention had Jehovah with the nations,
Into judgment hath he entered with all flesh; The wicked — he gave them
to the sword, saith Jehovah.

<span id="viii.xxxvi-p10"></span>The past is evidently used for the
future. “The sound” then was to go forth, and for the reasons here
assigned, — God would have a dispute with all, would try the matter as
it were by a judicial process, and would give up the condemned, the
wicked, to the sword. The object of this representation is very
correctly stated by Calvin. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[153](cc19007.htm#fr_152.md) <span
id="viii.xli-p8.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xli-p9"></span> This word is omitted by the Sept., and
Calvin’s rendering is that of the Vulg., and it is a verb like the
former in the Syr. and the Targ. On the contrary, the two words are
nouns, and ought to be so rendered, —

<span id="viii.xli-p10"></span>**34.** Howl, ye pastors, and cry, And
roll yourselves in the dust, ye illustrious of the flock, Because
fulfilled are your days For the slaughter and for your dispersions; And
ye shall fall like a precious vessel.

<span id="viii.xli-p11"></span>The word <span
id="viii.xli-p11.1"></span>רפאב, “in the dust,” is connected with the
verb here used in <span id="viii.xli-p11.2"></span>[Jer
6:26](../../../bib/kjv/jer006.htm#026.md)<span id="viii.xli-p11.2"></span>,
and in <span id="viii.xli-p11.3"></span>[Eze
27:30](../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#030.md)<span
id="viii.xli-p11.3"></span>, and it is supplied here by the Vulg. and
the Targ. The line is rendered by the Sept., —

<span id="viii.xli-p12"></span>And mourn, ye rams of the flock.

<span id="viii.xli-p13"></span>But the verb has no other sense but that
of rolling, though the other word may be rendered “rams,” as it is in
the masculine gender.

<span id="viii.xli-p14"></span>Venema gives the following version, —

<span id="viii.xli-p15"></span>Howl, ye pastors, and cry aloud, And
sprinkle yourselves with dust, ye illustrious of the flock; For
fulfilled are your days to be sacrificed; And there shall be your
breakings, And ye shall fall like a precious vessel.

<span id="viii.xli-p16"></span>He considers the first and the fourth
line as connected, and the second and the third; the pastors were to be
broken, and the illustrious of the flock to be slain in sacrifice. There
is certainly a congruity in the parts thus viewed. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[154](cc19007.htm#fr_153.md) <span
id="viii.xliii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xliii-p7"></span> So the Targ. renders the sentence, “For
the Lord hath destroyed their people.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[155](cc19007.htm#fr_154.md) <span
id="viii.xliv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xliv-p8"></span> The word rendered “tents” means
sometimes dwellings, or habitations, and sometimes pastures; and it is
thus variously translated in our version, according to what the context
requires. As “pastures” are mentioned in the previous verse, tents, or
habitations, would be the best word here, and more suitable to the verb
that is used, which means to reduce to silence, or to level, that is,
with the ground, and hence to demolish. The rendering of the Vulg. is
“fields — <span id="viii.xliv-p8.1"></span>arva,” but of the Syr. and
Targ. “habitations.” Venema and Blayney have “folds,” which are probably
the habitations intended. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[156](cc19007.htm#fr_155.md) <span
id="viii.xliv-p8.4"></span>

<span id="viii.xliv-p9"></span> Literally it is, “through the burning of
the wrath of Jehovah.” The word “fury,” by which it is often rendered,
is by no means suitable. The Versions vary: “the wrath of indignation”
is the Sept.; “the wrath of fury” the Vulg., “boiling wrath” the Sept.;
and “the fury of wrath” the Targ. The same words occur at the end of the
next verse. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[157](cc19007.htm#fr_156.md) <span
id="viii.xlv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="viii.xlv-p10"></span> Another view is taken by many, that God
is compared to a lion forsaking his covert for the sake of prey; so
Crotius, Gataker, Lowth, Henry, and Adam Clarke. Scott seems to agree
with Calvin’s view; which seems to be favored by what follows, “for
become has their land a waste,” etc.; though this may comport also with
the other view, for this may have been stated as a proof that God had
gone forth as a lion seeking his prey; that is, to destroy them. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[158](cc19007.htm#fr_157.md) <span
id="viii.xlv-p12.2"></span>

<span id="viii.xlv-p13"></span> There are several MSS. which have <span
id="viii.xlv-p13.1"></span>ברח, sword, for <span
id="viii.xlv-p13.2"></span>ןורח, burning or indignation, and so the
Sept. and the Targ.; and “the oppressing sword,” <span
id="viii.xlv-p13.3"></span>הנויה ברח, is found in two other places in
Jeremiah, 46:16, and <span id="viii.xlv-p13.4"></span>[Jer
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#016.md)<span id="viii.xlv-p13.4"></span>.
It is to be also observed, that <span id="viii.xlv-p13.5"></span>ןורח is
very seldom used but in connection with <span
id="viii.xlv-p13.6"></span>ףא, and we have it again in the next clause.
The true reading then most probably is <span
id="viii.xlv-p13.7"></span>ברח. The verse would then be as follows, —

<span id="viii.xlv-p14"></span>**38.** Left hath he like a lion his
covert; For their land hath become a desolation Through the oppressing
sword, And through the burning of his wrath.

<span id="viii.xlv-p15"></span>The <span id="viii.xlv-p15.1"></span>יכ
might be rendered “therefore,” instead of “for;” and thus the meaning
would be more evident. See <span id="viii.xlv-p15.2"></span>[Jer
25:30-31](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#030.md)<span
id="viii.xlv-p15.2"></span>, where “the roaring” as of a lion, and the
“sword,” are both mentioned; and this confirms the view here given. In
the two last lines, “the oppressing” or “devastating sword” is first
referred to, — the visible effect, and then “the burning of his wrath” —
the cause; an order often to be seen in the Prophets. — *Ed*
