<span id="vi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 23

<span id="vi.i"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p1"></span><span id="vi.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#001.md)<span id="vi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p2"></span>**1**. Woe be unto the pastors that destroy
and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD.

<span id="vi.i-p3"></span>**1**. Vae Pastoribus qui perdunt et dissipant
gregem pascuorum meorum! dicit Jehova.

<span id="vi.i-p4"></span>**2**. Therefore thus saith the LORD God of
Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my
flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will
visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.

<span id="vi.i-p5"></span>**2**. Propterea sic dicit Jehova, Deus
Israel, super Pastores pascentes populum meum, Vos dissipastis gregem
meum et dispulistis, et non visitastis eos (vel, oves meas;) Ecce ego
visitans (hoc est, visitabo) super vos malitiam actionum vestrarum,
dicit Jehova:

<span id="vi.i-p6"></span>**3**. And I will gather the remnant of my
flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring
them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.

<span id="vi.i-p7"></span>**3**. Ego autem colligam residuum ovium
mearum ex omnibus terris, ad quas expulero eas, et reverti faciam eas ad
caulas suas, et fructificabunt et multiplicabuntur.

<span id="vi.i-p8"></span> 

<span id="vi.i-p9"></span><span id="vi.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p10"></span>Here the Prophet promises the restoration of
the Church; but he reminds hypocrites that there was no reason for them
on that account to flatter themselves, especially the king, his
councillors, and the priests. Then this prophecy is a mixture of
promises and threatenings, for God promises that he would be propitious
to the miserable Jews, after having chastised them, so that the seed of
Abraham might not be entirely cut off: he yet deprives hypocrites of
vain confidence, so that they might not falsely apply to themselves the
hope of salvation, from which they had excluded themselves by their
impiety. And this is what ought to be noticed, for as soon as God’s
mercy is offered, hypocrites apply to themselves whatever God promises,
and become more and more insolent, as though they held him bound to
them; for impunity leads them to take more liberty to sin. Hence it is
that they boast that they are safe, for they consider themselves to be
the people of God. The Prophet, therefore, teaches here that whatever
God promises belongs to his elect, that it does not appertain
indiscriminately to all, nor ought to be extended to hypocrites who
falsely pretend his name, but that it peculiarly belongs to the elect,
though they may be small in number, and though they may be despised.

<span id="vi.i-p11"></span>He says first, *Wo to the pastors who
destroy,*  <span id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) etc. Here are contrary
things — a pastor and a destroyer! But he concedes to them the name
which was honorable; and yet he derides their false boasting, for they
thought that they could hide their crimes under this shade, falsely
claimed. Though then he calls them pastors, he yet removes the mask, and
thus shews that they in vain boasted while they assumed the name of
pastors. “Ye are pastors,” he says, ““and ye are destroyers! *who
dissipate* or scatter *the flock of my pastures.”*  <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md)

<span id="vi.i-p14"></span>Here God shews the reason why he was so
grievously displeased with these pastors; for by exercising tyranny over
the people, they not only injured men, but also injured and dishonored
God, who had received under his own protection his chosen people. It is
indeed true that they deserved such a scattering; for we have already
seen in many places, that the people could by no means be excused when
they were deceived by wicked and unfaithful leaders; for in this way was
rendered to them all their past reward for having provoked God’s wrath
against themselves, from the least to the greatest. But the impiety of
wicked pastors was not on this account excusable; for they ought to have
considered for what purpose this burden was laid on them, and also by
whom they had been appointed. God then intimates that great injury was
done to him, when the people were thus so ignominiously scattered. He
was himself the chief pastor; he had put as it were in his own place the
king and his counsellors and also the priests. Justly then does he now
condemn them, because they had *destroyed the flock* of God, according
to what is said in another place,

<span id="vi.i-p15"></span>“That they had destroyed his vineyard.”  
(<span id="vi.i-p15.2"></span>[Jer
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer012.htm#010.md)<span id="vi.i-p15.2"></span>;
<span id="vi.i-p15.3"></span>[Isa
5:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#003)<span id="vi.i-p15.3"></span>.md)

<span id="vi.i-p16"></span>In short, when God calls the Jews *the flock
of his pastures,* he does not regard what they deserved, or what they
were, but he, on the contrary, sets forth the favor bestowed on the seed
of Abraham. He has respect then here to his gratuitous adoption, though
the Jews had rendered themselves unworthy of such a benefit.

<span id="vi.i-p17"></span><span id="vi.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p18"></span>He afterwards adds, *Thus saith Jehovah, the
God of Israel, to the pastors who feed my people* In the same sense he
calls them now his people, as he had called them before the flock of his
pastures. They had alienated themselves from God, and he had already by
his own decree repudiated them; and God might in one respect have deemed
them aliens; and yet in respect of the covenant he acknowledged them as
his own; and hence he calls them *his people* He now then confirms what
we have already noticed, that these pastors were not only thieves and
robbers, but also sacrilegious; for they not only had exercised cruelty
towards the flock, but as far as they could injured and dishonored God
himself, who had undertaken the care of that people.

<span id="vi.i-p19"></span>But there is here a twofold concession, he
calls them *pastors,* and they are said to *feed* the people. He had
said before that they destroyed and scattered the flock, and now he says
that they *fed* them; but in what sense we well know, for by this kind
of irony he meant to reprove them; they boasted that they were pastors,
and they thought that their crimes would by such a covering be buried in
the sight of God, as in the sight of men. In a similar manner when we
speak in the present day of the Pope and his mitred bishops and filthy
clergy, we use expressions which are commonly employed. But Antichrist
is everything but a father, and we know how far they are from being
really bishops who assume the title; and as to the clergy, the name is
sacred, but they are very far from being God’s heritage. We indeed make
no account of these empty titles. But it is a great aggravation of their
guilt, that they being devils, should assume angelic names, that they
being wolves and robbers, and sacrilegious, should falsely pretend God’s
name, and recommend themselves by spurious titles, as though they were
pastors, bishops, abbots, and prelates, and what not.

<span id="vi.i-p20"></span>So then our Prophet calls those whom he
condemns, by way of taunt, *pastors,* and says that they *fed,* that is,
were called for this end, to do this work. But he afterwards adds, *My
flock have ye scattered, and driven away, and not visited*  <span
id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) Surely it was not to feed, to have no
care for the sheep. To *visit* is to be extended here to every part of
the duty of overseeing, as though he had said, that the flock had been
by them neglected, betrayed, and deserted. We hence see that they had
wholly neglected their pastoral office. But the other two things are
still worse, for they had *scattered* and *driven away* the flock. Their
sloth in neglecting the flock was not to be tolerated; but it was still
more intolerable when they exercised so much cruelty as to scatter the
flock as though they were deadly enemies; and yet these are the things
for which Jeremiah condemns them. We hence see that there was an implied
taunt, when he conceded to them the office of feeding.

<span id="vi.i-p25"></span>He then denounces judgment on them, I *will
visit upon you the wickedness of your doings* Here God declares that he
would punish the pastors, to whom was justly ascribed the scattering of
the people. For though no one was exempt from blame, as it has been
before stated; yet the main fault belonged to these pastors. This then
is the reason why God declares that he would take vengeance; for he
would not have his flock scattered with impunity.

<span id="vi.i-p26"></span><span id="vi.i-p26.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p27"></span>It then follows, *And I will gather* my
flock. As they had driven the people away, so God promises that it would
be his care to gather them. And yet he ascribes to himself what he had
imputed to them — that he had driven away his flock, but in a different
sense; the pastors had scattered the flock, not only by their sloth, but
also by their cruelty, for they became rapacious wolves; but God had
punished the people, for they all had fully deserved such a scattering.
We hence see that the ungodly execute God’s judgment; but they are not
on this account excusable as though they were God’s ministers, for they
have nothing less in view. Nor can God be involved in their sin, while
he thus employs them to execute his purpose. In short, the scattering of
the people was a just punishment from God, for they had all departed
from the faith, they had broken the sacred bond of the covenant, by
which God had bound them to himself. It was also the fault of the
pastors, because they avariciously and cruelly tyrannized over them. The
*pastors,* as I have said, were not only the priests, but also the king
and his counsellors.

<span id="vi.i-p28"></span>*I will gather,* he says, not the flock, but
*the remnant of the sheep* God intimates here that he would be so
merciful as to receive unto favor, not all indiscriminately, but a small
number, constituting the elect. And hence Paul carefully distinguished
between the people and the remnant of grace, or the gratuitous remnant;
for Christ appeared by his coming to have abolished the covenant by
which God had adopted the children of Abraham, but Paul does not admit
this. Now, if any one objects and says that the greater part of the
people had been cut off, this he allows; but he says that the covenant
remains valid in the remnant, and produces also examples, such as that
of which we now speak. God then has ever been the preserver of his
Church; and thus his gratuitous adoption, by which he had chosen the
seed of Abraham, never fails. But this adoption is effectual only as to
the remnant.

<span id="vi.i-p29"></span>As to the word *remnant,* the fewness of
those whom God had resolved to gather is not only intimated, but also
the vengeance, which as to time had gone before; for God seemed to have
destroyed the Jews when they were driven away into various lands, as
they had no name remaining, the kingdom and the priesthood were
abolished. It was therefore a certain kind of death, as I have before
said; but God here declares that there would be some remnant, according
to what is said in <span id="vi.i-p29.1"></span>[Isa
10:22](../../../bib/kjv/isa010.htm#022.md)<span id="vi.i-p29.1"></span>,
that God saved a few as it were from the consumption; for he refers
there to the very few that remained alive, when they thought that all
was over with the whole people, that there was no hope of restoration.

<span id="vi.i-p30"></span>*I will gather,* he says, *the residue of my
sheep from all the lands to which I shall have driven them* He again
confirms what I have stated, that there would be no place for mercy
until he had cleansed his Church from its many filthy pollutions. The
scattering then of the people into various lands was the purgation of
the Church, according to what God says, that he would separate the
refuse and the chaff from the wheat in chastising his people; for as the
chaff and the refuse are blown here and there when the wheat is
winnowed, and the wheat only remains and is afterwards laid up in the
granary; so when God drove his people away into various lands, he then
purged his Church. If any one objects and says, “Then the remnant were
dealt with like the refuse;” it is true as to the individuals, but God
refers here to himself, when he calls them his *own, sheep,* who were
yet unworthy of such an honor.

<span id="vi.i-p31"></span>He then adds, that he would *bring them back
to their folds,*  <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) *that they might
be fruitful,* that is, bring forth and increase, *and be multiplied* By
folds he no doubt means the land of Canaan; for there was then no wealth
in the world which the Jews would have preferred to the inheritance
promised to them; the whole world was to them an exile. For God had
chosen that land in which they dwelt, and had consecrated it to himself,
and he gave it to them as an earnest or a pledge of the eternal
inheritance. Rightly then does he now call that land folds, for they
lived there under his guardianship and protection. The temple was as it
were the pastoral staff; they knew that God dwelt there, that being
protected by his power they might continue in safety. Since then there
was safety for them under God’s protection in the land of Canaan, he
calls it their fold. Then he says, that they may *be fruitful,* and *be
multiplied;* for among other blessings their increase was not the least.
He afterwards adds, —

<span id="vi.ii"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p1"></span><span id="vi.ii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#004.md)<span id="vi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p2"></span>**4**. And I will set up shepherds over them
which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed,
neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.

<span id="vi.ii-p3"></span>**4**. Et excitabo super eos pastores, et
pascent eos (*hoc est,* qui pascant,) et non timebunt amplius, et non
pavebunt, et non deficient, dicit Jehova.

<span id="vi.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.ii-p5"></span><span id="vi.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ii-p6"></span>He confirms the promise, for he would give
them faithful and true pastors, who would perform their office as it
behoved them; for it would not be enough that the sheep should be
restored to their folds, except they were fed. We indeed know that a
sheep is a silly animal, and therefore has need of a shepherd to rule
and guide it. God then intimates by these words, that after he had
collected his flock into the fold it would be the object of his constant
care; for he would appoint pastors, who would discharge their office in
a far different way from wolves and sacrilegious robbers. He then adds a
promise as to their security, which we shall consider tomorrow.

<span id="vi.iii"></span>

<span id="vi.iii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vi.iii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou didst
formerly take such heavy vengeance on the impiety of thine ancient
people, that thou didst not spare even kings, who were representatives
of Christ, nor their counsellors, — O grant, that we at this day may
continue in obedience to thy word, and not so kindle thy vengeance
against us by our ingratitude, as to provoke thee to punish us with that
sad and dreadful desolation which thou formerly didst not in vain
denounce on thy people; but may thy Church become more and more
fruitful, so that we may know that thou art really gracious to us; and
may we thus in quietness give thee thanks, and suffer ourselves to be
ruled by thee, even by the hand of thine only-begotten Son, until we
shall be gathered from our scattering in this world into that eternal
rest which he has obtained for us by his own blood. — Amen.

<span id="vi.iv"></span>

<span id="vi.iv-p1"></span>Lecture Eighty-Fifth

<span id="vi.iv-p2"></span>We said in our yesterday’s Lecture, that when
the Lord promised to give pastors, he pointed out by this mode of
speaking the continuance of his favor; as though he had said, that he
would not only be the Redeemer of his people, but would also take care
of the safety of those whom he delivered from exile. The two things are
indeed necessary, for it would have profited them nothing to have the
hand of God stretched forth once in their behalf, except he continued
his favors to them to the end. The sum of the whole, then, is this, that
the Jews, after being restored to their own country, would be under
God’s protection, so that their safety would be secured, and be
permanent and not momentary.

<span id="vi.iv-p3"></span>By adding, *they shall not fear, nor dread,
nor fail,*  <span id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) or be lessened, he
intimates that the Jews would be in a tranquil state under the pastors
whom he would set over them. And we know that the duty of a true pastor
consists of two parts; for it is not enough for him to rule and guide
the sheep, except He also defends them against all violence, the
incursions of robbers and wolves. Now, this tranquillity is set in
contrast with the disquietude with which the Jews had been for a long
time harassed; for we know that they had been tossed with great
anxieties, owing to the continual incursions of their enemies. As, then,
they were trembling continually when they heard rumors of war, God
promises them here a better condition, as we shall hereafter see more
clearly. It now follows, —

<span id="vi.v"></span>

<span id="vi.v-p1"></span><span id="vi.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:5-6](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#005.md)<span id="vi.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v-p2"></span>**5**. Behold, the days come, saith the LORD,
that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign
and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.

<span id="vi.v-p3"></span>**5**. Ecce dies veniunt, dicit Jehova, et
suscitabo Davidi germen justum; et regnabit rex, et prudenter (*vel,*
prospere) aget: faciet judicium et justitiam in terra.

<span id="vi.v-p4"></span>**6**. In his days Judah shall be saved, and
Israel shall dwell safely: and this *is* his name whereby he shall be
called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.

<span id="vi.v-p5"></span>**6**. Diebus ejus servabitur Jehudah, et
Israel habitabit in fiducia (*hoc est,* tranquille: et hoc nomen, quo
vocabunt eum, Jehova justitia nostra.

<span id="vi.v-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.v-p7"></span><span id="vi.v-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v-p8"></span>The Prophet confirms what he had before said
of the renewal of the Church; for it would not have been in itself
sufficiently strong to say “I have promised pastors who shall faithfully
perform their duty,” except the only true Pastor had been set before
them, on whom God’s covenant was founded, and from whom was to be
expected the accomplishment of the promises which were hoped for. And it
was usual with all the prophets, whenever they gave the people the hope
of salvation, to bring forward the coming of the Messiah, for in him
have God’s promises always been, yea, and amen. (<span
id="vi.v-p8.1"></span>[2Co 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#020.md)<span
id="vi.v-p8.1"></span>.) This, indeed, appears now, under the Gospel,
more clear than formerly; but the faith of the Fathers could not have
been complete except they directed their thoughts to the Messiah. As,
then, neither the love of God could have been made certain to the
Fathers, nor the testimony of his kindness and paternal favor be
confirmed without Christ, this is the reason why the prophets were wont
to set Christ before their eyes whenever they sought to inspire the
miserable with a good hope, who otherwise must have been overwhelmed
with sorrow and driven into despair.

<span id="vi.v-p9"></span>What, therefore, so often occurs in the
prophets is deserving of special notice, so that we may know that God’s
promises will become ineffectual to us, or be suspended, or even vanish
away, except we raise all our thoughts to Christ, and seek in him what
would not be otherwise certain and sure to us.

<span id="vi.v-p10"></span>According to this principle the Prophet now
says, that the *days would come in which God would raise up to David a
righteous branch* He had spoken generally of pastors; but the Jews might
have still been in doubt, and hesitated to believe that any such thing
could be hoped for; hence God calls here their attention to the Messiah;
as though he had said, that no hope of salvation could be entertained
except through the Mediator who had been promised to them, and that
therefore they were not sufficiently wise except they turned their minds
to him. Moreover, as the accomplishment of salvation was to be expected
through the Mediator, God shews that the promise, that he would give
them pastors, ought not to be doubted. Hence it appears that I rightly
stated at the beginning, that the former doctrine is confirmed by this
passage in which God promises the coming of the Mediator. And the
demonstrative particle, *behold,* as we have elsewhere seen, is intended
to shew certainty; and it was necessary for the Jews to be thus
confirmed, because the time had not as yet arrived, and we know that
their faith must have been grievously shaken by so many and so long
trials, had they not some support. God, then, seems to point out the
event as by the finger, though it was as yet very remote. He does not
intimate a short time, but he thus speaks for the sake of making the
thing certain, so that they might not faint through a long expectation.
*Come,* then, he says, *shall the days in which he will raise up to
David a righteous branch*

<span id="vi.v-p11"></span>Though the preposition <span
id="vi.v-p11.1"></span>ל, *lamed,* is often redundant, yet in this place
it seems to me that God has a reference to the covenant which he had
made with David. And the Prophet did this designedly, because the Jews
were unworthy of being at all regarded by God; but he here promises that
he would be faithful to that covenant which he had once made with David,
because David himself was also faithful and embraced with true faith the
promise made to him. God then, as though he would have nothing to do
with that perverse and irreclaimable people, but with his servant David,
says, “I will raise up to David a righteous branch;” as though he had
said, “Though ye were even a hundred times unworthy of having a
Deliverer, yet the memory of David shall ever remain complete with me,
as he was perfect and faithful in keeping my covenant.” Now, it cannot
be doubted but that the Prophet speaks here of Christ.

<span id="vi.v-p12"></span>The Jews, in order to obscure this prophecy,
will have this to be applied to all the descendants of David; and thus
they imagine an earthly kingdom, such as it was under Solomon and
others. But such a thing cannot certainly be gathered from the words of
the Prophet; for he does not speak here of many kings, but of one only.
The word “branch,” I allow, may be taken in a collective sense; but what
is afterwards said? *A king shall reign* They may also pervert this, for
the word “king” is often taken for successors in a kingdom. This is
indeed true; but we ought to consider the whole context. It is said, *in
his days* Hence it appears evident that some particular king is
intended, and that the words ought not to be applied to many. And the
last clause is a further confirmation, *This shall be his name, by which
they shall call him, Jehovah our righteousness* Here also the Jews
pervert the words, for they make God the nominative case to the verb, as
though the words were, “Jehovah shall call him our righteousness;*”* but
this is contrary to all reason, for all must see that it is a forced and
strained version. Thus these miserable men betray their own
perverseness; for they pervert, without any shame, all the testimonies
in favor of Christ; and they think it enough to elude whatever presses
hard on them.

<span id="vi.v-p13"></span>We must now, then, understand that this
passage cannot be explained of any but of Christ only. The design of the
Holy Spirit we have already explained; God had from the beginning
introduced this pledge whenever he intended to confirm faith in his
promises; for without Christ God cannot be a Father and a Savior to men;
nor could he have been reconciled to the Jews, because they had departed
from him. How, indeed, could they have been received into favor without
expiation? and how could they have hoped that God would become a Father
to them, except they were reconciled to him? Hence without Christ they
could not rely on the promises of salvation. Rightly, then, have I said,
that this passage ought to be confined to the person of Christ.

<span id="vi.v-p14"></span>And we know of a certainty that he alone was
a righteous branch; for though Hezekiah and Josiah were lawful
successors, yet when we think of others, we must say, that they were
monsters. Doubtless, with the exception of three or four, they were all
spurious and covenant-breakers; yea, I say, spurious, for they had
nothing in common with David, whom they ought to have taken as an
example of piety. Since, then, they were wholly unlike their father
David, they could not have been called righteous branches. They were,
indeed, perfidious and apostates, for they had departed from God and his
law. We hence see that there is here an implied contrast between Christ
and all those spurious children who yet had descended from David, though
wholly unworthy of such an honor on account of their impiety. Therefore
as these kings had roused God’s wrath against the people, and had been
the cause of their exile, the Prophet says now, that there would be at
length a *righteous branch;*  <span id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) that
is, that though those did all they could to subvert God’s covenant by
their wicked deeds, there would come at length the true and the only
Son, who is elsewhere called the *first-born* in the whole world, (<span
id="vi.v-p15.2"></span>[Ps 89:27](../../../bib/kjv/psa089.htm#027.md)<span
id="vi.v-p15.2"></span>,) and that he would be a righteous branch.

<span id="vi.v-p16"></span>And this ought to be carefully noticed; for
neither Hezekiah nor Josiah, nor any like them, when viewed in
themselves, were worthy of this sacred distinction,

<span id="vi.v-p17"></span>“I will make him the first-born in the
earth;” and further,  
“My Son art thou.” (<span id="vi.v-p17.2"></span>[Ps
2:7](../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#007)<span id="vi.v-p17.2"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.v-p18"></span>This could not have been said of any mortal
man, viewed in himself. And then it is said,

<span id="vi.v-p19"></span>“I will be to him a Father, and he shall be
to me a Son;”

<span id="vi.v-p20"></span>and the Apostle tells us, that this cannot be
applied even to angels. (<span id="vi.v-p20.1"></span>[Heb
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#005)<span id="vi.v-p20.1"></span>..md) As,
then, this dignity is higher than angels’ glory, it is certain that none
of David’s successors were worthy of such an honor. Hence Christ is
justly called a righteous Branch. At the same time, the Prophet, as I
have already reminded you, seems to set the perfect integrity of Christ
in opposition to the impiety of those who under a false pretense had
exercised authority, as though they were of that sacred race of whom it
had been said, “I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son.”

<span id="vi.v-p21"></span>It follows, — *And reign shall a king* This
also has not been added without reason, shortly after Jeconiah had been
driven into exile, and also the whole royal family had been exposed to
every kind of reproach. The crown, indeed, was cast on the ground, as it
has already appeared, and was trodden under feet. There was, therefore,
no hope of a future kingdom when the seed of Abraham had become, as it
were, extinct. This is the reason why God promises what we now hear of
the restoration of the throne; and we may easily infer from what all the
prophets have said, that the salvation of the people was dependent on
the person of their king; and whenever God bade the people to entertain
hope, he set a king before their eyes. A king was to be their head under
God’s government. We now see the design of the Prophet in saying, that a
*king would reign*

<span id="vi.v-p22"></span>Some think that a king is to be understood as
in opposition to a tyrant, because many kings had departed from their
duty, and committed robbery under that specious authority. I have no
doubt but that the word king was expressed, lest the people should doubt
the fulfillment of this prophecy; for if it had been only said, “I will
raise up to David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign,” they might,
indeed, have entertained some hope, but it would have been small, and
not full and complete. We, indeed, know that Zerubbabel and others
excelled in some things, and were highly regarded for David’s sake; but
there was then no kingdom. God therefore intended here expressly to
testify that there would be the high privilege of a kingdom, that there
might be nothing wanting to the Jews, as the power of Christ would not
be inferior to the power of David. *Reign,* then, *shall a king;* that
is, he shall reign gloriously, so that there would not be merely some
remnants of pristine dignity, but that a king would flourish, become
strong, and attain perfection, such as it was under David and Solomon,
and much more excellent.  <span id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md)

<span id="vi.v-p29"></span>It *follows,* — *And shall act prudently, and
shall do judgment and justice in the land;* or, “he shall prosper,” for
<span id="vi.v-p29.1"></span>לכש, *shecal,* means both; yet the Prophet
seems here to speak of right judgment rather than of success, for the
two clauses ought to be read together, “he shall act prudently,” and “he
shall do judgment and justice.” It seems then that he means this in
short, — that Christ would be endued with the spirit of wisdom as well
as of uprightness and equity, so that he would possess all the
qualifications, and fulfill all the duties of a good and perfect king.
 <span id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md)

<span id="vi.v-p31"></span>And in the first place, wisdom or prudence is
necessary; for probity alone would not be sufficient in a king. In
private individuals indeed it is of no small value; but probity in a
king, without wisdom, will avail but little, hence, the Prophet here
commends Christ for his good discernment, and then mentions his zeal for
equity and justice. It is indeed true that Christ’s excellences are not
sufficiently set forth by expressions such as these; but the similitude
is taken from men; for the first endowment of a king is wisdom, and then
integrity in the second place. And we know that Christ is often compared
to earthly kings, or set forth to us under the image of an earthly king,
in which we may see him; for God accommodates himself to our ignorance.
As, then, we cannot comprehend the unspeakable justice of Christ or his
wisdom, hence God, that he may by degrees lead us to the knowledge of
Christ, shadows him forth to us under these figures or types. Though,
then, what is said here does not come up to the perfection of Christ,
yet the comparison ought not to be deemed improper; for God speaks to us
according to the measure of our capacities, and could not at once in a
few words fully express what Christ is. But we must bear in mind that
from earthly kings we must ascend to Christ; for though he is compared
to them, yet there is no equality; after having contemplated in the type
what our minds can comprehend, we ought to ascend farther and much
higher.

<span id="vi.v-p32"></span>Hence, the difference between the
righteousness of Christ and the righteousness of kings ought to be here
noticed. They who rule well can in no other way administer righteousness
and judgment than by being careful to render to every one his own, and
that by checking the audacity of the wicked, and by defending the good
and the innocent; this only is what can be expected from earthly kings.
But Christ is far different; for he is not only wise so as to know what
is right and best, but he also endues his own people with wisdom and
knowledge; he executes judgment and righteousness, not only because he
defends the innocent, aids them who are oppressed, gives help to the
miserable, and restrains the wicked; but he *doeth righteousness,*
because he regenerates us by his Spirit, and he also *doeth judgment,*
because he bridles, as it were, the devil. We now then understand the
design of what I said, that we ought to mark the transcendency of Christ
over earthly kings, and also the analogy; for there is some likeness and
some difference: the difference between Christ and other kings is very
great, and yet there is a likeness in some things; and earthly kings are
set forth to us as figures and types of him.

<span id="vi.v-p33"></span><span id="vi.v-p33.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v-p34"></span>It then follows, that *Judah shall be saved*
in the days of this king. By *days* we are not to understand the life
only of Christ, which he lived in this world, but that perpetuity of
which Isaiah speaks, when in wonder he asks,

<span id="vi.v-p35"></span>“His age who shall declare?” (<span
id="vi.v-p35.1"></span>[Isa 53:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#008.md)<span
id="vi.v-p35.1"></span>;)

<span id="vi.v-p36"></span>for he died once, that he might live to God,
according to what Paul says. (<span id="vi.v-p36.1"></span>[Ro
6:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#010)<span id="vi.v-p36.1"></span>..md) It
was then but a short beginning of life when Christ was manifested in the
world, and held converse with men; but his life is to continue for ever.
It is then the same thing as though the Prophet had said, that when
Christ came and descended from the Father, the Church would be saved.

<span id="vi.v-p37"></span>If it be now asked, “How long shall it be
saved?” the answer is, “As long as the King himself shall continue; and
there is no end to his kingdom.” It follows then that the salvation of
the Church will be for ever. This is the import of the whole.

<span id="vi.v-p38"></span>Now, though the Prophet speaks of the
deliverance of the people, there is yet no doubt but that he especially
sets forth what properly belongs to the kingdom of Christ. He is set
over us as a king, that he might be our Savior; and his salvation,
though it extends to our bodies, ought yet to be viewed as properly
belonging to our souls; for the kingdom of Christ is spiritual, and so
is everything connected with it. Hence, when the Prophet says that
*saved would be Judah,* it is the same thing as though he promised that
the happiness of the Church would be real and solid under Christ.

<span id="vi.v-p39"></span>He adds, *Israel shall dwell in confidence;*
for in a happy life the first thing is, that we possess tranquil and
quiet minds; for tranquillity has not been without reason commended by
the ancients. When all things which men covet are heaped together, and
what they think necessary for happiness, they yet cannot be otherwise
than miserable if their minds are not in a right state. It is not then
without cause that tranquillity is added, when mention is made of
salvation. And experience itself teaches us, that we have no salvation,
unless we, relying on Christ the Mediator, have peace with God, as Paul
also mentions it as the fruit of faith, and shews that we cannot
otherwise but be always miserable: we have peace*,* he says, with God.
(<span id="vi.v-p39.1"></span>[Ro
5:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#001)<span id="vi.v-p39.1"></span>..md) He
hence also concludes that our very miseries are a help to our salvation;
for afflictions prove patience, patience exercises hope, and hope never
makes us ashamed; and the proof of this is added, because God thus
really shews that he is present with us.

<span id="vi.v-p40"></span>We hence see how fitly the Prophet connects
tranquillity of mind with happiness. Moreover it is certain that we do
not yet enjoy either salvation or peace, such as are here promised; but
let us learn by faith what salvation is, and also what is rest even in
the midst of the agitations to which we are continually exposed; for we
recumb on God when we cast our anchor in heaven. Since, then, the
Prophet says here that Judah would be saved and that Israel would be in
a tranquil state, let us know that he includes the whole kingdom of
Christ from the beginning to the end, and that therefore it is no wonder
that he speaks of that perfect happiness, the first fruits of which now
only appear.

<span id="vi.v-p41"></span>He then adds, *And this is the name by which
they shall call him, Jehovah our Righteousness* By these words the
Prophet shews more clearly that he speaks not generally of David’s
posterity, however excellent they may have been, but of the Mediator,
who had been promised, and on whom depended the salvation of the people;
for he says that this would be his name, *Jehovah our Righteousness*
 <span id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md)

<span id="vi.v-p43"></span>Those Jews, who seem more modest than others,
and dare not, through a dogged pertinacity, to corrupt this passage, do
yet elude the application of this title to Christ, though it be suitable
to him; for they say that the name is given to him, because he is the
minister of God’s justice, as though it was said, that whenever this
king appeared all would acknowledge God’s justice as shining forth in
him. And they adduce other similar passages, as when Moses calls the
altar, “Jehovah my banner,” or my protection. (<span
id="vi.v-p43.1"></span>[Ex 17:15](../../../bib/kjv/exo017.htm#015.md)<span
id="vi.v-p43.1"></span>.) But there is no likeness whatever between an
altar and Christ. For the same purpose they refer to another passage,
where it is said,

<span id="vi.v-p44"></span>“And this is the name by which they shall
call Jerusalem,  
Jehovah our peace.” (<span id="vi.v-p44.2"></span>[Eze
48:35](../../../bib/kjv/eze048.htm#035)<span id="vi.v-p44.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vi.v-p45"></span>Now Moses meant nothing else than that the
altar was a monument of God’s protection; and Ezekiel only teaches, that
the Church would be as it were a mirror in which God’s mercy would be
seen, as it would shine forth then, as it were, visibly. But this cannot
for the same reason be applied to Christ; he is set forth here as a
Redeemer, and a name is given to him, — what name? the name of God. But
the Jews object and say, that he was God’s minister, and that it might
therefore be in a sense applied to him, though he was no more than a
man.

<span id="vi.v-p46"></span>But all who without strife and prejudice
judge of things, can easily see that this name is suitably applied to
Christ, as he is God; and the Son of David belongs to him as he is man.
The Son of David and Jehovah is one and the same Redeemer. Why is he
called the Son of David? even because it was necessary that he should be
born of that family. Why then is he called Jehovah? we hence conclude
that there is something in him more excellent than what is human; and he
is called Jehovah, because he is the only-begotten Son of God, of one
and the same essence, glory, eternity, and divinity with the Father.

<span id="vi.v-p47"></span>It hence appears evident to all who judge
impartially and considerately, that Christ is set forth here in his
twofold character, so that the Prophet brings before us both the glory
of his divinity and the reality of his humanity. And we know how
necessary it was that Christ should come forth as God and man; for
salvation cannot be expected in any other way than from God; and Christ
must confer salvation on us, and not only be its minister. And then, as
he is God, he justifies us, regenerates us, illuminates us into a hope
of eternal life; to conquer sin and death is doubtless what only can be
effected by divine power. Hence Christ, except he was God, could not
have performed what we had to expect from him. It was also necessary
that he should become man, that he might unite us to himself; for we
have no access to God, except we become the friends of Christ; and how
can we be so made, except by a brotherly union? It was not then without
the strongest reason, that the Prophet here sets Christ before us both
as a true man and the Son of David, and also as God or Jehovah, for he
is the only-begotten Son of God, and ever the same in wisdom and glory
with the Father, as John testifies in <span id="vi.v-p47.1"></span>[Jer.
17:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#005.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#011.md)<span id="vi.v-p47.1"></span>.

<span id="vi.v-p48"></span>We now then perceive the simple and real
meaning of this passage, even that God would restore his Church, because
what he had promised respecting a Redeemer stood firm and inviolable.
Then he adds what this Redeemer would be and what was to be expected
from him; he declares that he would be the true God and yet the Son of
David; and he also bids us to expect righteousness from him, and
everything necessary to a full and perfect happiness.

<span id="vi.v-p49"></span>But by saying, God *our righteousness,* the
Prophet still more fully shews that righteousness is not in Christ as
though it were only his own, but that we have it in common with him, for
he has nothing separate from us. God, indeed, must ever be deemed just,
though iniquity prevailed through the whole world; and men, were they
all wicked, could do nothing to impugn or mar the righteousness of God.
But yet God is not our righteousness as he is righteous in himself, or
as having his own peculiar righteousness; and as he is our judge, his
own righteousness is adverse to us. But Christ’s righteousness is of
another kind: it is ours, because Christ is righteous not for himself,
but possesses a righteousness which he communicates to us. We hence see
that the true character of Christ is here set forth, not that he would
come to manifest divine justice, but to bring righteousness, which would
avail to the salvation of men, For if we regard God in himself, as I
have said, he is indeed righteous, but is not our righteousness. If,
then, we desire to have God as our righteousness, we must seek Christ;
for this cannot be found except in him. The righteousness of God has
been set forth to us in Christ; and all who turn away from him, though
they may take many circuitous courses, can yet never find the
righteousness of God. Hence Paul says that he has been given or made to
us righteousness, — for what end? that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him. (<span id="vi.v-p49.1"></span>[1Co
1:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#030)<span id="vi.v-p49.1"></span>..md)
Since, then, Christ is made our righteousness, and we are counted the
righteousness of God in him, we hence learn how properly and fitly it
has been said that he would be *Jehovah,* not only that the power of his
divinity might defend us, but also that we might become righteous in
him, for he is not only righteous for himself, but he is our
righteousness.  <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md)

<span id="vi.vi"></span>

<span id="vi.vi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vi.vi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that we, having been all
slaves to sin and to iniquity, but regenerated by the Spirit of thy
only-begotten Son, may truly and with sincere desire seek to serve and
worship thee alone, and so consecrate ourselves to thee, that it may
appear that we do not falsely profess the name of Christ, but that we
are truly his members, being partakers of that new life which he brought
us; and may we make such progress in it, that, having finished our
course on earth, we may at length come to that fullness of life and
happiness which has been procured for us by him, and which is laid up in
heaven for us. — Amen.

<span id="vi.vii-p1"></span>Lecture Eighty-Sixth

<span id="vi.viii"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p1"></span><span id="vi.viii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:7-8](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#007.md)<span id="vi.viii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p2"></span>**7**. Therefore, behold, the days come,
saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, the LORD liveth, which
brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;

<span id="vi.viii-p3"></span>**7**. Propterea ecce dies veniunt,
(venient,) dicit Jehova, quibus non dicetur *(ad verbum,* et non
dicetur, — non dicent) amplius, Vivit Jehova, qui eduxit filios Israel e
terra Egypti;

<span id="vi.viii-p4"></span>**8**. But, the LORD liveth, which brought
up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north
country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they
shall dwell in their own land.

<span id="vi.viii-p5"></span>**8**. Quin potius, Vivit Jehova, qui
eduxit et adduxit (ascendere fecit et introduxit, *ad verbum)* semen
domus Israel e terra Aquilonis, et ex omnibus terris, ad quas expuleram
eos illue; et habitabunt super terram suam.  <span
id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md)

<span id="vi.viii-p7"></span> 

<span id="vi.viii-p8"></span><span id="vi.viii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p9"></span>The Prophet, after having spoken of the
Redeemer who was to be sent, now sets forth in high terms that great
favor of God, and says that it would be so remarkable and glorious, that
the former redemption would be nothing to the greatness and excellency
of this. When the children of Israel were brought up out of Egypt, God,
we know, testified his power by many miracles, in order that this favor
towards his people might appear the more illustrious; and rightly did
the Prophets exhort and encourage the faithful to entertain good hope by
calling to their minds what was then done. But our Prophet enhances the
second redemption by this comparison, that hereafter the kindness of
God, with which he favored his people when he delivered them from the
bondage of Egypt, would not be remembered, but that something more
remarkable would be done, so that all would talk of it, and that all
would proclaim the immense benefit, which God would confer on them in
delivering them from their exile in Babylon.  <span
id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md)

<span id="vi.viii-p11"></span>He then says that the *days would come in
which it would not be said, Live does Jehovah,* who brought his *people
from Egypt,* but who brought his people *from the land of the North*
 <span id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) Yet he does not mean that the
memory of God’s favor towards the Israelites, when he brought them from
Egypt, was to be abolished; but he reasons here from the less to the
greater, as though he had said that it was an evidence of God’s favor
that could not be sufficiently praised, when he delivered his people
from the land of Egypt, that if it were taken by itself, it was worthy
of being for ever remembered; but that when compared with the second
deliverance it would appear almost as nothing. The meaning is, that the
second redemption would be so much more remarkable than the first, that
it would obscure the remembrance of it, though it would not obliterate
it.

<span id="vi.viii-p15"></span>And this passage deserves to be especially
noticed, for we hence learn how much we ought to value that redemption
which we have obtained through the only-begotten Son of God. And hence,
also, it follows that we are more bound to God than the Fathers under
the Law, as he has dealt far more bountifully with us, and has put forth
his power more fully and effectually in our behalf. We further learn,
that the Prophet does not in this prophecy include a few years only, but
the whole kingdom of Christ and its whole progress. He indeed speaks of
the return of the people to their own country, and this ought to be
allowed, though Christians have been too rigid in this respect; for
passing by the whole intermediate time between the return of the people
and the coming of Christ, they have too violently turned the prophecies
to spiritual redemption. There is no doubt but that the Prophet makes a
beginning with the free return of the people from captivity; but, as I
have said, Christ’s redemption is not to be separated from this,
otherwise the accomplishment of the promise would not appear to us, for
a small portion only returned to their own land. We also know that they
were harassed with many and continual troubles, so that their condition
was always miserable, for nothing is worse than a state of disquietude.
We know further, that they were spoiled, and that often, and were also
reduced to a state of bondage. We know how cruelly they were treated at
one time by the Egyptians, and at another by the kings of Syria. Then
more was promised by Jeremiah than what God has really performed, except
we include in this prophecy the kingdom of Christ. But as God so
restored his Church by the hand of Cyrus, that it might be a kind of
prelude to a future and perfect redemption, it is no wonder that the
prophets, whenever they spoke of the people’s return and of the end of
their exile, should look forward to Christ and to his spiritual kingdom.

<span id="vi.viii-p16"></span>We now, then, see the design of the
Prophet, when he says that the days would come in which their first
redemption would not be spoken of by the people, as a remarkable or as
the chief evidence of God’s favor and power, as their second redemption
would far exceed it.

<span id="vi.viii-p17"></span>As to the formula or manner of speaking,
*Live does Jehovah,* we know that the ancients used such words in making
a solemn oath, and whenever they sought to animate themselves with hope
under adversities. Whenever, then, they found themselves so pressed down
that they had no other escape from evil than through God’s favor, they
usually said that the God who had formerly been the Redeemer of his
people still lived, and that there was no diminution of his power, so
that he could ten times, or a hundred times, or a thousand times, if
necessary, bring help to his Church and to every member of it.

<span id="vi.viii-p18"></span><span id="vi.viii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p19"></span>He says, *from all the lands to which I
shall have driven them,* and he says this for two reasons, which we
shall presently state. The change of person does not obscure the
meaning: *Live,* he says, *does Jehovah, who brought out and led his
people from the land of the north, and from all the lands to which I had
driven them;* but there is no ambiguity in the sense.

<span id="vi.viii-p20"></span>As to the subject itself, it seems that
God in the first place intended to remind the Jews of their sins, as
this knowledge was to be the way to repentance, or a preparation for it.
For except they were convinced that they were chastised for their sins
by God’s hand, they would either have thought that their exile was by
chance, or have given way to murmuring complaints as they often did. But
God here declares that he was the author of their exile, in order that
the Jews might know that God justly punished them for their many and
grievous sins. But God, in the second place, shews that it was in his
power, whenever he pleased, to restore those whom he had afflicted. It
was the same as to raise from death those whom he had slain, according
to what is said elsewhere,

<span id="vi.viii-p21"></span>“God is he who kills, and who brings to
life.”  
(<span id="vi.viii-p21.2"></span>[1Sa
2:6](../../../bib/kjv/sa1002.htm#006)<span id="vi.viii-p21.2"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.viii-p22"></span>Many indeed can destroy, but they cannot
heal the wound which they may have made. But with regard to God, he is
both a righteous Judge and a merciful Savior. As, then, death is in his
power whenever he punishes men for their wickedness, so also he has life
in his hand and at his bidding, whenever he intends to shew mercy. We
now, then, perceive what the Prophet had in view in saying that the Jews
had been driven away by God.

<span id="vi.viii-p23"></span>He afterwards adds, *They shall dwell in
their own land* It was necessary that the Jews should have been
sustained by this support until the coming of Christ, for they saw that
they would be in that inheritance which had been promised to the fathers
as a pledge of eternal life and of the heavenly kingdom. It now follows,
—

<span id="vi.ix"></span>

<span id="vi.ix-p1"></span><span id="vi.ix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009.md)<span id="vi.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ix-p2"></span>**9**. Mine heart within me is broken because
of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a
man whom wine hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the
words of his holiness.

<span id="vi.ix-p3"></span>**9**. Propter prophetas *(alii,* ad

confractum est) cor meum in medio mei; commota sunt *(vel,* concussa)

loquitur de ossibus, sermo erit aptior,* luxata esse ossa;) fui tanquam
vir ebrius super quem transiit vinum *(hoc est* tanquam vir obrutus
vino) a facie Jehovae, et a facie sermonum sanctitatis ejus.

<span id="vi.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.ix-p5"></span><span id="vi.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ix-p6"></span>The Prophet here again inveighs against the
wickedness of the people; but as the prophets by their flatteries had
then led astray the king and his princes, as well as the people, the
Prophet directed his discourse to them, and says that his *heart* was
troubled *on account of the prophets* We know that men think themselves
half absolved when no one severely reproves them. When, therefore, the
prophets ceased from their work, there was so great a security among the
whole people, that there was no fear of God in them. This is the reason
why the Prophet now says that his heart was troubled on account of so
much indifference; for the prophets were, as it is said elsewhere, like
dumb dogs; they overlooked the most grievous and the most atrocious
sins, they made no effort to restore the people to the right way.
*Troubled,* then, he says, is *my heart for the prophets*; a heavier
judgment awaited them, for they ought to have been the instruments of
God’s Spirit, the heralds of his judgments; they ought to have
undertaken his cause by using exhortations, reproofs, and threatenings.

<span id="vi.ix-p7"></span>There is yet no doubt but that what is said
ought to be extended to the whole body of the people. But Jeremiah
wished to begin with the prophets, as though he had said that it was
monstrous that the prophets boasted that they were God’s ministers, and
yet were dumb in the midst of so much wickedness. *On account of the
prophets,*  <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) he says, *broken is my
heart* Then he says that his *bones* were disjointed. In the first
chapter of Genesis, when Moses speaks of the Spirit as moving on the
waters, he uses the same verb, but in a different conjugation. However
this may be, it is most suitable to say that his bones were disjointed.
 <span id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) And we know that the bones are
tied together by sinews, that they may not be moved from their places;
for the loosening of one bone renders the whole body almost useless. He
meant, then, by this kind of speaking, to express the most painful
perturbation of mind, as though he had said that what he had, as the
firmost and strongest thing, was become weak and altogether feeble.

<span id="vi.ix-p12"></span>He afterwards compares himself to a drunken
man; by which metaphor he understands that he was completely stunned,
and that all his senses were taken from him. And he adds, *over whom
wine has passed* The verb <span id="vi.ix-p12.1"></span>רבע, *ober,*
means to pass beyond; but to pass over is its meaning here. He who is
overcome by immoderate drinking seems as though he was drowned; for when
one falls under the water, he is no more sunk than he who drowns his
brain with wine; for drunkenness is like a grave, inasmuch as it holds
the whole man under its power. Yet the Prophet meant no other thing than
that this monstrous thing rendered those astonied who were of a sane and
sound mind, and that it also shook and disjointed all the members, and
terrified and confounded minds otherwise quiet and tranquil. For,
certainly, Jeremiah was a wise man, and was also endued with courage, so
that he would not have quailed under every evil though great; nor could
he have been easily overwhelmed with stupor like a drunken man. Hence by
these comparisons he shows how dreadful and monstrous it was, that the
prophets were so unconcerned as not to say a word, when they saw that
impiety and contempt of God were so rampant, when they saw the whole
land defiled with every kind of wickedness, as we shall presently see.

<span id="vi.ix-p13"></span>Then he says, *On account of Jehovah, and on
account of the words of his holiness* By saying, *on account of
Jehovah,* he brings God before them as a judge and avenger; as though he
had said, “If they believe that there is a God in heaven, it is a wonder
that they are so brutish as to dare to boast of his name, and yet
silently to allow heaven and earth to be mingled together. Where, then,
is their reason, when they dare so heedlessly to profess a name so
fearful and awful? for whenever God’s name is mentioned, there ought to
come into their minds not only his goodness and mercy, but also his
severity, and then his power, which is dreadful to all the wicked. As
then these men dare thus to trifle with God, must not their stupidity be
monstrous?” What, then, the Prophet means is this, — that it was a
wonder that the prophets undertook their office, and yet had no concern
for the glory of God.

<span id="vi.ix-p14"></span>And he adds, *On account of the words of his
holiness* Men would seek easiness were not God to rouse them by his
word. But as the Law had been written for the Jews, as these false
prophets knew that if they wished rightly to perform their work, they
ought to have been the expounders of the Law — as these things were
sufficiently known, the Prophet justly refers here to the word of God,
as though he would put a bridle in their mouths, lest they should, after
their usual manner, evade what a bare profession of God’s name implied.
Since, then, God had testified in his Law how he would have his people
ruled, how was it that these prophets were not terrified by God’s words?
And as hypocrites not only despise God himself, and depreciate his
glory, but also disregard the doctrine of his law, the Prophet adorns
God’s words with a remarkable encomium, calling his words the words of
*his holiness* And he thus calls God’s words holy, and therefore
inviolable, in order that the ungodly might know, that a dreadful
vengeance was nigh them, because they disregarded both God and his holy
words. It follows —

<span id="vi.x"></span>

<span id="vi.x-p1"></span><span id="vi.x-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#010.md)<span id="vi.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.x-p2"></span>**10**. For the land is full of adulterers;
for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the
wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force *is*
not right.

<span id="vi.x-p3"></span>**10**. Quia adulteriis referta est terra,
quia a facie jurisjurandi (*vel,* perfidae) luxit terra, aruerunt
speciosa deserti (*vel,* caulae deserti; *nam pluribus* modis vertunt;)
et fuit cursus eorum malus, et robur eorum non rectum.

<span id="vi.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.x-p5"></span><span id="vi.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.x-p6"></span>Jeremiah now assigns the reason why he was so
much horrified by the insensibility which he observed in the prophets.
If things were in good order, or if, at least, they were tolerable, the
prophets would have more calmly addressed the Jews; for what need is
there to make a great ado when men willingly follow what God commands?
When, therefore, we have to do with meek and modest men, vehemence is
foolish; and they who thus bestir themselves, and seek, through great
ambition, to shew very fervid zeal when there is no need, are nothing
but apes; but when things are in disorder and confusion, then vehemence
is wanted. Jeremiah now declares that things were so extremely out of
order, that the prophets could not have been silent, except they were
like logs of wood.

<span id="vi.x-p7"></span>These two things, then, ought to be connected
together, — that the prophets were dumb, — and that they were dumb when
there was the greatest necessity for speaking; for they saw the land
filled with adulteries. Though he names adulterers, he yet condemns the
crime. As then the land was polluted by adulteries and perjuries, as
they all gave themselves up to do evil, it was by no means to be
tolerated that the prophets should not be indignant, as though things
were well ordered and peaceable.

<span id="vi.x-p8"></span>We hence see how much God abhors sloth in the
ministers of his word, in those whom he appoints as teachers in his
Church, while they connive at wickedness, and heedlessly pass by
adulteries, and fornications, and perjuries, and frauds, and other kinds
of wrongs; for if there were even the least particle of religion in
their hearts, they would certainly have been moved, and could not have
been for a moment silent. For if that zeal ought to be in all God’s
children, which was in the Psalmist,

<span id="vi.x-p9"></span>“The zeal of thine house has consumed me, and
the reproaches of them who reproached thee have fallen upon me,” *  
*(<span id="vi.x-p9.2"></span>[Ps
69:10](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#010)<span id="vi.x-p9.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="vi.x-p10"></span>how inexcusable must be the indifference of
prophets, when they see God’s name exposed to mockery, and when they see
every kind of wickedness prevailing? We now see not only what the
Prophet teaches in this passage, but also the usefulness of his doctrine
and how it ought to be applied. Let us then learn, that the more liberty
men take in sinning, and the more audaciously their impiety and contempt
of God break out, the more sharply ought prophets and faithful teachers
to reprove and condemn them; and that it is the time of fighting, when
the world thus presumptuously and furiously rise up against God.

<span id="vi.x-p11"></span>The Prophet mentions some kinds of evil, and
yet does not enumerate all kinds; but under adulteries and perjuries he
includes also other crimes. As to the word <span
id="vi.x-p11.1"></span>הלא, *ale,* it properly means swearing; but as
cursing often accompanies it, some render it here “execration.”  <span
id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) But I rather think that what is meant is
perjury, and that swearing here is taken in a bad sense, signifying
swearing falsely in the name of God.

<span id="vi.x-p15"></span>*Mourned,* he says, *has the land, and dried
up have the pastures of the desert* Here the Prophet strikingly shews
how shameful was that torpor of which he speaks, for the land itself
cried out, and not only the land which was cultivated and had on it many
men, but also the very mountains and their recesses. He says that the
land was in mourning, because God shewed his judgments everywhere by
rendering the fields barren, and by other means which he used as
punishments. And it is a very striking mode of speaking, when the
Prophet mentions the mourning of the land, as though it assumed the
character of a mourner, when it saw God angry on account of the
wickedness of men. It is, indeed, a kind of personification, though he
does not introduce the land as speaking; but he describes mourning as it
appeared in the sterility of the land, and also in hails and storms, in
unseasonable rains, in droughts, and in other calamities.

<span id="vi.x-p16"></span>Whenever then God raises his hand to punish
men for their sins, if they themselves perceive it not, the very land,
which is without sense and feeling, ought to fill them with shame for
their madness; for mourning appears in the very land, as though it knew
that God was displeased with it. When, therefore, men sleep in their
sins, and thus disregard God’s vengeance, how monstrous must be their
torpor! And if this be intolerable in the common people, what can be
said of the prophets, who ought to proclaim such words as these, —
“Cursed is he who has transgressed the precepts of this law” — *“*cursed
is he who has corrupted the worship of God” — or, “who hath dealt
unjustly with his neighbor,” — and whatever else the law contains?
(<span id="vi.x-p16.1"></span>[De
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026.md)<span id="vi.x-p16.1"></span>;
<span id="vi.x-p16.2"></span>[Deut.
28:47](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#047.md),
[58](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#058)<span id="vi.x-p16.2"></span>..md) We
now then perceive how emphatical are the words when the Prophet says,
*Mourned has the land* And he amplifies the same thing by saying, *Dried
up have the beautiful places of the desert;* as though he had said, that
God’s judgments were seen in the remotest places, not only in the
plains, where the greater number of men dwelt, did the land mourn; but
if any one ascended the mountains, where shepherds only with their
flocks were to be found, even there the wrath of God was visible; and
the very mountains cried out that God was angry; and yet men still
deluded themselves, who, at the same time were expounders of the law,
who were the mouth of God, and to whom he had committed the office of
reproving; but they were dumb! We now understand what these words
contain, and what is to be learnt from them.

<span id="vi.x-p17"></span>He adds, that their *course was evil,*  <span
id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) and that their *strength was not right*
By *course* he no doubt means their doings and all their actions, and
also the aid which they proposed to themselves; for our life is called a
course, because God has not created us that we may lie down in one
place, but he has set before us an end for which we are to live.
Therefore, by course, the Scripture means all our doings, and the *very*
end for which we are to live. He then says, that all their *strength*
had been *perverted;* that is, that they had applied all their powers to
do evil. It then hence appears that, except the prophets had been
perfidious, they would have thought it full time to cry out, when men
provoked God with so much audacity in their wicked courses. It follows —

<span id="vi.xi"></span>

<span id="vi.xi-p1"></span><span id="vi.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#011.md)<span id="vi.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xi-p2"></span>**11**. For both prophet and priest are
profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD.

<span id="vi.xi-p3"></span>**11**. Quia tam propheta quam sacerdos impia
egerunt; etiam in domo mea deprehendi (*vel,* reperi) malitiam ipsorum,
dicit Jehova.

<span id="vi.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xi-p5"></span><span id="vi.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xi-p6"></span>He adds here that it ought not to appear
strange that the prophets were silent when they ought to have loudly
cried out, because they were guilty themselves: and whence can freedom
of *speech come* except from a good *conscience?* Hypocrites, who
indulge themselves, are indeed often severe against others, and even
more than necessary; but no one can dare honestly to cry out against
wickedness, but he who is innocent. For he who condemns others seems to
make a law for himself, according to what a heathen writer has said,
*(Cicero in Salustium.)* Then the Prophet here shews to us why the
prophets were not only idle, but were even like stocks and stones; for
in speaking against wickedness, it was necessary for them in the first
place to amend themselves; for their lives were wholly dissolute. As
then they were of all the most wicked, they could not boldly cry out
against others; and hence the Prophet condemns them, because their own
impiety prevented them to perform their own duty.

<span id="vi.xi-p7"></span>It is, indeed, possible for one to live
soberly, honestly, and justly, and yet to connive at the wickedness of
others; but the Prophet here condemns the prophets and priests on two
accounts, — for being mute, and for not undertaking God’s cause when
they saw the land polluted with all kinds of defilements; and he then
shews the fountain of this evil, that is, the cause why they were idle
and wholly indifferent, and that was, because they dared not say a word
against those crimes of which they were themselves guilty, *yea,* with
which they were more loaded than even the common people. We now perceive
the Prophet’s object in saying that both the *priests* and the
*prophets* had *acted impiously;*  <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md)
it was to shew, that their contempt of God, for which they were
notorious, and also their wickedness, had taken away from them all power
and freedom in acting.

<span id="vi.xi-p11"></span>It is added, *Even in my house have I found
their wickedness* He enhances what he had said of their impiety; for
they were not only infamous and wicked in common life, as to the duties
of the Second Table; but they also corrupted the whole service of God,
and the true Prophets were derided by them. For what was found to be the
priests’ wickedness in the Temple, except that they practiced a sort of
merchandise under the cover of the priesthood? and then the prophets
vitiated and adulterated God’s worship; and what was religion to them
but the means of filthy lucre or gain? When, therefore, the prophets
thus trod under foot the service of God, corrupted and perverted the Law
to make gain or to acquire power, their impiety was not only seen in the
habits of daily life, but also in the very Temple of God, that is, with
regard to the sacerdotal office.

<span id="vi.xi-p12"></span>Now, since this is true as to what took
place under the Law, there is no wonder that such a base example is to
be seen in the present day. And hence also is discovered the folly of
the Papists, who think that they ingeniously evade every objection as to
the crimes of the Pope and his filthy clergy, by saying that the Pope
indeed may be wicked, as almost all of them have been, and that the same
thing may be said of their mitred bishops; but that the Pope, as a Pope,
cannot err, and that the bishops, as bishops, that is, in their
government and office, are ruled by the Holy Spirit, because they
represent the Church. But are they better than these ancient priests,
whom God himself had expressly appointed, and to whom he commanded
obedience to be rendered by the whole people? But the Prophet not only
says here that they were wicked, that they acted impiously and wickedly
towards their neighbors, that they committed plunders and robberies,
that they were given to violence and rapacity, that they abandoned
themselves to adultery and to every other crime; but he says also, that
their wickedness was found in the very Temple, that is, in the very
sacred office itself; for not only was their life wicked, but they also
impiously and perfidiously corrupted the doctrine of God and subverted
his worship.

<span id="vi.xii"></span>

<span id="vi.xii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vi.xii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast been
pleased to set before us an example of every perfection in thine
only-begotten Son, we may study to form ourselves in imitation of him,
and so to follow not only what he has prescribed, but also what he
really performed, that we may prove ourselves to be really his members,
and thus confirm our adoption; and may we so proceed in the whole course
of our life, that we may at length be gathered into that blessed rest
which the same, thine only-begotten Son, hath obtained for us by his own

<span id="vi.xiii-p1"></span>Lecture Eighty-Seventh

<span id="vi.xiv"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p1"></span><span id="vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:12](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#012.md)<span id="vi.xiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p2"></span>**12**. Wherefore their way shall be unto
them as slippery *ways* in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and
fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, *even* the year of their
visitation, saith the LORD.

<span id="vi.xiv-p3"></span>**12**. Propterea erit via eorum ipsis
tanquam lubricitates, in caligine impingent, et cadent in ea; quia
inducam super eos malum, annum visitationis eorum, dicit Jehova.

<span id="vi.xiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xiv-p5"></span><span id="vi.xiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p6"></span>Here he declares to false prophets and
unfaithful priests that the Lord’s judgment was nigh at hand, because
they had deceived the people. But he speaks figuratively when he says,
that their *way* would be to them *as lubricities. By way* he
understands the means which they thought to be of the best kind, as
elsewhere, nearly in the same sense, what is deemed delectable, or what
conduces to sustain life, is called “the table” of the wicked. (<span
id="vi.xiv-p6.1"></span>[Ps 69:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022.md)<span
id="vi.xiv-p6.1"></span>.) The meaning then is, that when they thought
all things prosperous, as if one made his way through a plain, they
would find themselves on a slippery ground. *Their way,* then, would be
to them as *lubricities,*  <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) that is,
when they seemed to take a safe counsel and so prudently to set all
things in order, as that nothing could happen amiss to them, their way
would become slippery, and that in darkness. He doubles the evil; for
one may stand on a slippery ground, and yet may take care of himself on
seeing danger; but when darkness is added to the slippery ground, he who
can neither stand nor move can hardly do otherwise than fall, either on
this or that side: hence he says, *they shall stumble and fall in it*

<span id="vi.xiv-p12"></span>The reason follows, even because the Lord
was displeased with them. They could not then escape ruin, for they had
to do with God. But as the ungodly derive false confidence from God’s
forbearance, so that they dare to glory in their wickedness, he adds,
*the year of their visitation* Though, then, God would not immediately
put forth his hand to punish them, yet their time was to come; for the
year of visitation means the suitable time which God has determined
within himself. He indeed defers punishment; but when hypocrites and his
despisers have long abused his forbearance, he then suddenly begins to
thunder against them; and this is the year of visitation. It follows, —

<span id="vi.xv"></span>

<span id="vi.xv-p1"></span><span id="vi.xv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:13-14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#013.md)<span id="vi.xv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xv-p2"></span>**13**. And I have seen folly in the prophets
of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.

<span id="vi.xv-p3"></span>**13**. In prophetis (Et in prophetis)
Samariae vidi fatuitatem *(vel,* insulsum, *aut,* insulsitatem;)
prophetant in Baal, et errare faciunt *(vel,* decipiunt) populum meum
Israel.

<span id="vi.xv-p4"></span>**14**. I have seen also in the prophets of
Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies:
they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from
his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the
inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.

<span id="vi.xv-p5"></span>**14**. Et in prophetis Jerusalem vidi
pravitatem, adulterando et ambulando in fallacia; et roborant manus
improborum, ut non revertantur quisque a malitia sua; erunt mihi onmes
tanquam Sodoma, et habitatores ejus tanquam Gomorrha.

<span id="vi.xv-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.xv-p7"></span><span id="vi.xv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xv-p8"></span>These two verses are to be read together; for
there is no doubt but that the Prophet here compares the false prophets,
who had corrupted God’s worship in the kingdom of Israel, with those in
Jerusalem who wished to appear more holy and more perfect. And he thus
compares them that he might set forth those who sought to be deemed
God’s faithful ministers, as being by far the worst; for he says, that
he had found *fatuity* in the prophets of Samaria, but *depravity* in
the prophets of Jerusalem. They are, therefore, mistaken in my judgment
who take also, <span id="vi.xv-p8.1"></span>הלפת, *tephle,* as meaning
depravity; for they do not consider that he here enhances by comparison
their wickedness who thought themselves the best, as they say, without
exception.

<span id="vi.xv-p9"></span>As to the prophets of Samaria, they had been
long ago condemned; nor was there any at Jerusalem who dared openly to
defend them; for they had departed from the worship of God, and had led
away the people from the only true Temple and altar. They were then held
at that time in the kingdom of Judah as apostates, perfidious, and
unprincipled. But the kingdom of Judah still wished to be deemed pure
and blameless; and the prophets, who were there, boasted that they were
uncorrupt and free from every spot. The Prophet therefore says, that
fatuity had been found in the prophets of Samaria, that is, in those who
had corrupted the ten tribes, and vitiated there the pure worship of
God; but that there was more wickedness in the prophets of Jerusalem and
of the kingdom of Judah, because they were not only foolish, but also
designedly subverted all religion, and allowed liberty in all kinds of
wickedness, so that they carried as it were a banner in approbation of
every species of iniquity. We hence see that the object of Jeremiah was
to shew, that the prophets of the kingdom of Judah surpassed in impiety
those very prophets whom they proudly condemned; for they were not only
fatuitous and foolish, but had designedly as it were conspired against
God, and had become open enemies not only to religion but to all laws.

<span id="vi.xv-p10"></span>As to the words, that he *found* fatuity
 <span id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) in the prophets of Samaria, he
speaks in the person of God, who is the only fit judge. And he subjoins
the cause of their senselessness, because *they prophesied by Baal, and
made the people of Israel to go astray* Had Jeremiah spoken only of
these, he would no doubt have used stronger terms in describing their
sin; but as he was contrasting them with those who were worse, he was
satisfied with the word fatuity; as though he had said, “Were any one to
consider them by themselves, they were indeed very wicked, and deserved
the most severe punishment; but if they be compared with the prophets of
Judah, then they must be deemed only fatuitous and sottish.” Then the
copulative is to be rendered thus, “I have, indeed, seen fatuity in the
prophets of Samaria;” and then differently in the following clause, “but
in the prophets of Judah I have seen depravity.” It is to be read
adversatively in this verse, and concessively in the former. Then *in
the prophets of Jerusalem have I seen depravity*  <span
id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md)

<span id="vi.xv-p15"></span><span id="vi.xv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xv-p16"></span>It follows, *They commit adultery, and walk
in deception* Expositors think that there is a change of number; but
what if these words be applied to the people? as though Jeremiah had
said, “When any one is an adulterer, when any one walks in deception,
that is, when any one is fraudulent, *they strengthen, the hands of the
wicked.”* And, doubtless, this sense seems here to be the most correct.
Then Jeremiah shews how they surpassed other prophets in impiety, even
because they dissimulated when they saw on one hand adulteries
prevailing, and on the other frauds, plunders, and perjuries; and not
only so, but they undertook the patronizing of the wicked, and
strengthened the hands of the ungodly, and added audacity to their
madness. For as fear weakens the hands, so does shame; as, then, these
prophets removed shame as well as fear from the wicked and ungodly, so
they strengthened their hands; that is, they gave them more confidence,
so that they rushed headlong into every evil more freely and with
greater liberty.

<span id="vi.xv-p17"></span>*That they might not return,* he says*,
every one from his wickedness* This is added for the sake of
explanation; for, as I have said, either the fear of God or shame from
men might have checked their audacity; but when they were confirmed and
countenanced, they broke out into all excesses, and hardened themselves
in their obstinacy: *That they might not return, every one from his
wickedness.*

<span id="vi.xv-p18"></span>In the last place he adds, *They shall be to
me all of them as Sodom, and its inhabitants as Gomorrah* We see that
the last clause is confined to the citizens of Jerusalem. Then God says,
that these prophets would be like the Sodomites, and the citizens of
Jerusalem like the citizens of Gomorrah. This is not to be understood
only as to crimes, but also as to punishment; as though he had said,
that there was no more hope of pardon for them than for the Sodomites,
for they had provoked to the utmost the wrath of God, so that he could
not now spare them. It then follows, —

<span id="vi.xvi"></span>

<span id="vi.xvi-p1"></span><span id="vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015.md)<span id="vi.xvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xvi-p2"></span>**15**. Therefore thus saith the LORD of
hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood,
and them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is
profaneness gone forth into all the land.

<span id="vi.xvi-p3"></span>**15**. Propterea sic dicit Jehova

amaritudine (*aut,* veneno; alii vertunt, absynthio, הנעל, sed nomen

significat amaritudinem noxiam et virulentem et mortiferam,) et potabo
eos aquis veneni (*alii vertunt,* fellis*; diximus alibide hac voce,*
שאר,) quoniam a prophetis Jerusalem egressa est impietas in totam
terram.

<span id="vi.xvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xvi-p5"></span><span id="vi.xvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xvi-p6"></span>This verse is addressed to the prophets of
the kingdom of Judah, as we learn from its conclusion; and thus the
exposition which I have given is confirmed, even this, that God
extenuates the fault of other prophets, in speaking of the prophets of
Jerusalem, who boasted of greater sanctity. But he declares that they
would have poison for meat and gall for drink; as though he had said, “I
will pursue them with every kind of punishment.” He expresses evidently
the same thing I have before referred to, that their table would become
a snare to them. (<span id="vi.xvi-p6.1"></span>[Ps
69:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#022)<span id="vi.xvi-p6.1"></span>..md)
The ungodly, indeed, always think that they can by their arts escape;
God on the other hand declares, that though they might have a table
prepared, they yet would find nothing on it, but poison for meat, and
gall for drink. For as to God’s children and faithful servants, evils
are turned to their benefit; so as to the ungodly and his wicked
despisers, all things must necessarily turn out for their ruin, even
meat and drink, and their course of life, and in a word everything.

<span id="vi.xvi-p7"></span>The cause follows, *For gone forth is
impiety*  <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md) *through the whole land
from the prophets of Jerusalem* By which words he declares that they
were the authors of all evils, so that in comparison with them the
prophets of Samaria might have been deemed in a manner righteous. But
there is no doubt but that this declaration was considered too severe;
yet we see by what necessity Jeremiah was constrained thus to speak; for
the lamp of God as yet remained at Jerusalem, according to what is said
in many passages, nor was the light of sound doctrine wholly put out.
They professed that they continued to obey the Law; and at the same time
they were much worse than others, for not only the worship of God in the
Temple and in the city was corrupted, but adulteries, frauds, plunders,
and all kinds of wickedness prevailed everywhere. He adds —

<span id="vi.xvii-p2"></span>**16**. Thus saith the LORD of hosts,
Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they
make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, *and* not out of

<span id="vi.xvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xvii-p5"></span><span id="vi.xvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xvii-p6"></span>What is here said must have appeared very
severe, and must have grievously offended the people; for Jeremiah
forbade them to hear the teaching of the prophets. He indeed concedes to
them the name of prophets, which was a sacred name; but yet he
discredits them, and deprives them of all dignity. he speaks not of
magicians or impostors, who were aliens to God’s people; he speaks not
of Egyptians, or Chaldeans, or any like them, nor does he speak of the
prophets of Samaria, but of those who daily appeared in the Temple and
boasted that they were divinely chosen, endued with the spirit of
revelation, and that they brought nothing but what God had committed to
them. As then Jeremiah forbade them to hear these, some great perplexity
must have necessarily seized the minds of all, especially of the simple,
— “What does this mean? why does God suffer these unprincipled men to
occupy a place in the Temple, and to exercise there the prophetic
office, while at the same time they are cheats, perjurers, and
impostors?”

<span id="vi.xvii-p7"></span>In the same manner we see that many at this
day are perplexed on account of the discords by which the Church is
harassed, and as it were torn to pieces. We are constrained to contend
with those who arrogate to themselves the name of the Catholic Church,
who boast that they are bishops, vicars of Christ, successors of the
Apostles. When therefore the ignorant see such hostile conflicts in the
very bosom of the Church, they must necessarily be terrified, and such
stumbling-block shakes dreadfully their faith. Hence this passage ought
to be especially noticed; for though at first ignorant people may be
disturbed by such a prohibition as this, yet every one who really fears
God will exercise his mind, so that he may distinguish between false and
true prophets; and God will never leave his chosen people destitute of
the spirit of judgment and discernment, when teachers contend on both
sides, and tumults nearly overthrow the Church; even then, as I have
said, God will preserve his own elect, provided we piously and humbly
strive to submit to his word; he will also guide us by his hand, so that
we may not be deceived. Since then God had commanded *Jeremiah* to
forbid the people to hear the false prophets, let us not at this day
wonder, that faithful teachers who desire to maintain true doctrine and
genuine piety, feel themselves constrained to oppose these men of titles
who shelter themselves under the masked names of pastors, and prelates,
and bishops, that they may delude the unwary and the ignorant; *Hear
not,* he says, *the words of the prophets who prophesy to you*

<span id="vi.xvii-p8"></span>He adds, *They make you to be vain;* that
is, they infatuate you.  <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) But this
would not have been sufficient, had he not added what more fully
confirmed it. Hence Jeremiah says, that they brought forward the vision
of their own hearts, and did not speak what came from God’s mouth. This
is a mark which can never deceive us, except we willingly throw
ourselves into the snares and intrigues of Satan, as many do who
wilfully seek to be deceived, and even hunt for falsehoods; but
whosoever applies his mind to the study of truth, can never be deceived,
if by this mark, which is set before us, he distinguishes between
prophets and prophets; for every one who speaks according to the mere
suggestions of his own mind must be an impostor. No one then ought to be
deemed a sound teacher, but he who speaks from God’s mouth.

<span id="vi.xvii-p12"></span>But here a question may be raised, How can
the common people understand that some speak from God’s mouth, and that
others propound their own glosses? I answer, That the doctrine of the
Law was then sufficient to guide the minds of the people, provided they
closed not their eyes; and if the Law was sufficient at that time, God
does now most surely give us *a clearer* light by his prophets, and
especially by his Gospel. Since then God has once given us his
testimony, every one ought to obey him as soon as he knows what is
right, what he ought to follow, and what he ought to shun.

<span id="vi.xvii-p13"></span>We now then see how useful this passage
is; for there is nothing more miserable than for men to be tossed here
and there, and to be led astray from the way of salvation. There is
therefore nothing more desirable than to know this way with certainty,
Now, God shews us the way here as by the finger; for he says that those
who speak from his mouth can be heard with safety; but that others are
to be *rejected,* how much soever they may boast of being prophets, and
thus seek under the guise of authority to subject men’s minds captive to
themselves. And this ought to suffice at this day to put an end to all
controversies; for on this no doubt depends almost every question that
is now agitated in the world. The Papists will have their own devices to
be taken as oracles, and claim to be the Church; but we, on the other
hand, say that perfect wisdom is alone to be found in the Law, in the
Prophets, and in the Gospel. Were we then to attend to the mouth of God,
it would be easy to settle all the disputes between us. It hence also
follows, that the Papists are deceived because they deign not to ask at
God’s mouth, but choose to become slaves to men and to their own
falsehoods, rather than to inquire what pleases God; for he himself has
spoken, and has not spoken hiddenly, neither doubtfully nor obscurely;
for there is nothing more clear than his teaching, provided men do not
become wilfully blind. He then adds, —

<span id="vi.xviii"></span>

<span id="vi.xviii-p1"></span><span id="vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:17-18](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#017.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xviii-p2"></span>**17**. They say still unto them that
despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto
every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil
shall come upon you.

<span id="vi.xviii-p3"></span>**17**. Dicentes dicendo iis qui me
contemnunt, Loquutus est Jehova, Pax erit vobis, et omnibus qui ambulant
(cunctis ambulantibus; est quidem singularis numerus, ad verbum, cuique
ambulanti) in pravitate cordis sui, dicunt, Non veniet super vos malum.

<span id="vi.xviii-p4"></span>**18**. For who hath stood in the counsel
of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his
word, and heard *it*?

<span id="vi.xviii-p5"></span>**18**. Nam quis stetit in consilio
Jehovae? et vidit et audivit sermonem ejus? Quis attendit ad sermonem
ejus et audivit?

<span id="vi.xviii-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.xviii-p7"></span><span id="vi.xviii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xviii-p8"></span>Jeremiah introduces another mark by which
the false prophets might be known as different from the true prophets, —
they flattered the ungodly and wicked despisers of God. He thus repeats
what he had before said, that they strengthened the hands of the wicked,
so that they became hardened in their impiety, and threw aside every
care for repentance. Though he uses different words, yet the meaning is
the same, that they *promised peace,* or prosperity, to the despisers of
God, for the word <span id="vi.xviii-p8.1"></span>םולש, *shalum,* means
to live well or happily.

<span id="vi.xviii-p9"></span>*They say,* then, *to those who despise*
or reject me; for <span id="vi.xviii-p9.1"></span>ףאנ, *nats,* means
both. The doubling of the word for “saying,” is also emphatical, <span
id="vi.xviii-p9.2"></span>רומא םירמא, *amrim amur:*  <span
id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md) for we know with how much haughtiness and
confidence the false prophets dared to announce their dreams; for they
were led by the spirit of pride, as they were the children of Satan.
Hence then was their confidence, so that they made their declarations as
though they had come down from heaven. *They say,* then, *by saying;*
that is, they promise, and that with great effrontery, that peace would
be to all the despisers of God; and not only so, but they pretended
God’s name, *Spoken, has Jehovah*  <span id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md)
They wished to be deemed the instruments or agents of the Holy Spirit,
while they were vainly announcing, as it has been said, their own
imaginations. And hence Jeremiah applied to them, though improperly, the
word *vision, They speak the vision of their own heart* By using this
word he makes a concession; for he might have said only, that they
adduced nothing but trifles, even the falsehoods which they themselves
had devised, but he mentions the word <span
id="vi.xviii-p13.2"></span>ןוזח, *chezun,* which in itself ought to be
deemed of high import. And yet he means that they were only apes as
prophets, when they prattled of visions and confidently declared that
they brought forward the revelations of the Spirit. He then concedes to
them, though improperly, that they saw visions; but what did they see?
even that *Jehovah had spoken, Peace shall be to you*

<span id="vi.xviii-p14"></span>Then he says, *They promise to those who
walk in the wickedness of their own heart,* that all things shall turn
out well to them, No *evil shall come upon you;* as though he had said,
“They promise impunity to all the wicked.”

<span id="vi.xviii-p15"></span><span id="vi.xviii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xviii-p16"></span>The verse which follows is usually thus
explained, Jeremiah condemns the false teachers for their carelessness,
because they attended not to the word of God, and regarded as nothing
what the Law contained. But interpreters seem to me to have been
certainly much mistaken in this view; for Jeremiah here shews
throughout, he passage how insolently and arrogantly the false teachers
conducted themselves in audaciously opposing the true and faithful
servants of God, *Who has stood in the counsel of Jehovah?* They no
doubt spoke thus tauntingly of the true prophets, “What! These announce
to you pestilence, war, famine, as though they were angels sent by God
from heaven; have they stood in the counsel of God?” Thus I connect this
verse with the former, for I am fully persuaded that he refers here to
the arrogance which the false teachers manifested towards the true
teachers.  <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md)

<span id="vi.xviii-p20"></span>Examples of this in our time give a plain
exposition to this passage. For when the Papists feel themselves driven
to an extremity, when they prevail nothing by clamor and falsehood, they
run to this sort of evasion, “He! if we must determine everything in
religion by the Law, the Prophets, and the Gospel, what certainty can be
found? The Scripture is like a nose of wax, for it can be turned to
anything, and no meaning can with certainty be elicited; thus all things
will remain perplexed and doubtful, if authority belongs to the
Scripture alone.” We then see that the enemies of truth at this day,
when they cannot otherwise cover their filthiness, labor to throw all
things into confusion, and to discredit God’s word, and to introduce
such darkness, that white cannot be distinguished from black, that light
becomes mixed with darkness.

<span id="vi.xviii-p21"></span>Similar to this was the perverse
wickedness of the false teachers. For Jeremiah and his associates, when
they came forth, declared that God’s vengeance could no longer be
deferred, for the people continued to provoke it; and they announced
themselves as the heralds of God and witnesses to his hidden purpose;
but these unprincipled men, that they might lull to sleep, yea, and
stupify the consciences of men, said, “Eh! *who has stood in the counsel
of Jehovah? who has heard? who has attended? who has seen?* all these
things are uncertain; and though these severely threaten you with
pestilence, war, and famine, yet there is no reason why ye ought to
fear. Be then easy, and quietly and cheerfully enjoy yourselves, for
they do not understand the purpose of God.” And this meaning we shall
presently see confirmed by what is said in verse 22, <span
id="vi.xviii-p21.1"></span>ידוסב ודמעםאו, *veam omdu besudi,* “And if
they had stood in my counsel.” There is then no doubt but that he turns
against them what they perversely boasted. But it now follows, —

<span id="vi.xix"></span>

<span id="vi.xix-p1"></span><span id="vi.xix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:19](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#019.md)<span id="vi.xix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xix-p2"></span>**19**. Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is

upon the head of the wicked.

<span id="vi.xix-p5"></span>I shall defer the consideration of this to

<span id="vi.xx-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vi.xx-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we are ever
inclined to be led away by ensnaring flatteries, and thus seek death and
final ruin for ourselves, — O grant that we may learn to tremble at
those denunciations announced by the prophets, by which thou shewest to
us thy wrath, so that we may be roused to true repentance, and not
harden ourselves through thy forbearance in what is evil, but pursue our
heavenly course, until having at length put off all our vices, we shall
be restored to that perfect form in which thy holy image fully shines
forth, through Jesus Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="vi.xxi"></span>

<span id="vi.xxi-p1"></span>Lecture Eighty-Eighth

<span id="vi.xxi-p2"></span><span id="vi.xxi-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxi-p3"></span>The verse which I read at the end of my last
Lecture must be now repeated to you, *Behold, the tempest* (or
*whirlwind*) *of Jehovah! it shall go forth with fury; even the
impending whirlwind! on the head of the ungodly shall it abide,* or
fall; for <span id="vi.xxi-p3.1"></span>לוחי, *ichul,* means both. The
Prophet now assails with more vehemence the false teachers, for they
were almost stupid. None, indeed, can betray so much audacity as to
oppose God, except when wholly blinded by Satan. Hence our Prophet deals
with the false teachers as with fanatics or those wholly stupified: he
tells them that God would come like a *whirlwind* Whether we render it a
whirlwind or a storm, there is not much difference.  <span
id="fr_98"></span>[99](#fn_98.md) And he adds, that they could not escape,
for the wrath of God was impending over them, and would at length remain
on them.

<span id="vi.xxi-p7"></span>Now, it is usual in Scripture to deal very
sharply with hypocrites, and especially with false teachers, because
Satan rules in them to an awful extent. And doubtless, as I have already
said, except a person be fascinated with illusions, he could not dare to
oppose God. There is, then, no wonder that the Prophet fulminates
against these ungodly teachers; for it was nothing but play and sport to
them to pretend God’s sacred name that they might deceive the people. He
afterwards adds, —

<span id="vi.xxii"></span>

<span id="vi.xxii-p1"></span><span id="vi.xxii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:20](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#020.md)<span id="vi.xxii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxii-p2"></span>**20**. The anger of the LORD shall not
return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts
of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.

<span id="vi.xxii-p3"></span>**20**. Non revertetur iracundia Jehovae
usque dum fecerit, et usque dum stabilierit cogitationes cordis sui: in
extremitate dierum intelligetis hoc intelligentia (*hoc est,*
intelligetis hujus rei intelligentiam, *ad verbum*.)

<span id="vi.xxii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xxii-p5"></span><span id="vi.xxii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxii-p6"></span>He confirms what he had said, lest the
hypocrites, with whom he had to do, should think that their punishment
would be light and soon pass away. For though they may have seen that
God’s hand was armed against them, yet they took comfort, because they
expected that it would only be for a short time. Hence Jeremiah here
reminds them that they were much deceived if they thought that they
could dissipate as a cloud the vengeance that, was at hand; for God
would not cease to punish them until he had destroyed them.

<span id="vi.xxii-p7"></span>There was another security which deceived
the ungodly: they were not terrified by threatenings of the Prophet,
because they thought that God was in a manner dallying with them
whenever he denounced ruin. And, doubtless, the wicked could not have so
securely indulged themselves, had it not been that they did not believe
that God’s word would be fulfilled. As, then, God’s threatenings did not
strike hypocrites with terror, the Prophet here declares that there was
no reason for them to harbor the vain hope that God only uttered words,
and that there would be no execution of his vengeance.

<span id="vi.xxii-p8"></span>*Turn back,* he says, *shall not the anger
of Jehovah until he has performed and confirmed the thoughts of his
heart* Jeremiah shews that God had not spoken in vain by his servants,
according to what is done by men, who often speak rashly, for their
tongue frequently outruns their purpose. But he reminds them here that
God is far different from men, for he ever speaks in earnest, and his
prophetic word is a sure evidence of his hidden purpose, as it will
again be presently declared. This is the reason why he mentions *the
thoughts of his heart*

<span id="vi.xxii-p9"></span>We must not yet think that God is like us,
as though he reflected on this thing and on that, and formed many
purposes, while one thing or another comes into his mind; no, such a
gross idea as this cannot be entertained, and cannot be consistent with
the nature of God.

<span id="vi.xxii-p10"></span>But Jeremiah calls, by a kind of metaphor,
the counsel of God his *thoughts,* even that fixed and unchangeable
counsel, which he declared by his prophets. Sometimes, indeed, God
threatened, in order to restore men to repentance; but we must bear in
mind that he neither varies himself nor changes his purpose. Whatever,
then, the prophets announced in his name, flowed from his hidden
purpose, and it was the same as though he had made known to us his own
heart. And it is no small commendation to prophetic doctrine that God as
it were connected his heart with his mouth. The mouth of God is the
doctrine itself; and he says now that it had proceeded from the depth of
his heart. It hence follows that there is nothing frustratory,
(deceptive,) as they say, in God’s word; for he here declares that
whatever he had committed to his servants were the thoughts of his
heart. And to *confirm,* or establish, must be applied to the execution
of his thoughts.

<span id="vi.xxii-p11"></span>The sum of the whole is, that God now
pronounces a sentence against the people, which could not be reversed;
for he had once for all decreed to destroy the men who were obstinate in
their sins.

<span id="vi.xxii-p12"></span>But he seems to refer to the word <span
id="vi.xxii-p12.1"></span>לוחי, *ichul,* which means, as I have said, to
fall, and also to abide or to lie upon. According to this meaning, he
says now, that the anger of God would not return, so as to change its
course, until it had completed what had already been decreed, even what
God had resolved respecting the destruction of the people.

<span id="vi.xxii-p13"></span>Then he adds, *In the extremity of days ye
shall understand the knowledge of this thing* So it is literally; but we
may give a simpler version, “Ye shall perceive the knowledge of this
matter,” or “Ye shall know what this means.” The Prophet, no doubt,
exults over the insensibility of those who could not be moved by such
awful warnings. We know how great is the hardness of the ungodly,
especially when Satan possesses their minds and hearts. There is,
indeed, no iron and no stone which has so much hardness as there is in
the perversely wicked; and they in a manner assail God with the greatest
obstinacy, as though they were victorious, for they despise all his
warnings and threatenings. Hence the Prophet derides their insolence, or
rather their madness, and. says, “Ye shall understand,” but too late;
for by *extremity of days,*  <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) he
means the time which God had appointed for his anger. But yet God had in
due time warned them that they might repent before his judgment came. It
was now then the same as though he left them in their own stupor, and
said that they could not, however, escape the hand of God by their
perverseness, according to what Paul says,

<span id="vi.xxii-p16"></span>“Let him who is ignorant, be ignorant.”  
(<span id="vi.xxii-p16.2"></span>[1Co
14:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#038.md)<span
id="vi.xxii-p16.2"></span>.)

<span id="vi.xxii-p17"></span>He no doubt checks the arrogance of those
who rejected every sound doctrine and all right counsels.

<span id="vi.xxii-p18"></span>So, then, the Prophet teaches us here that
hypocrites gain nothing by setting up their own contumacy and arrogance
in opposition to God, for they will find, though too late, that God has
not spoken in vain. We then see that by *extremity of days* is to be
understood that time when the door shall be closed, because they did not
in due time respond to God when he invited them to himself, and set
before them the hope of salvation.

<span id="vi.xxii-p19"></span>There is also another truth taught us
here, that we are to seek God while he may be found, and call upon him
while he is near. (<span id="vi.xxii-p19.1"></span>[Isa
55:6](../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#006)<span id="vi.xxii-p19.1"></span>..md)
For if we abuse his forbearance and despise him who speaks to us today,
we shall find out too late, and not without the most grievous sorrow,
that we have been deceived by the devil, because we did not attend to
God calling us. It follows, —

<span id="vi.xxiii"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p1"></span><span id="vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021.md)<span id="vi.xxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p2"></span>**21**. I have not sent these prophets,
yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.

<span id="vi.xxiii-p3"></span>**21**. Non misi prophetas, et ipsi
concurrerunt; non loquutus sum ad eos, et ipsi prophetarunt.

<span id="vi.xxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xxiii-p5"></span><span id="vi.xxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p6"></span>The Prophet again warns the Jews not to be
perverted by the flatteries of false teachers, and not to disregard the
threatenings of God. We have already said that the minds of the people
were then lulled asleep by false teachers, who promised them impunity.
And there is no evil worse than when false teachers, under the name of
God, flatter us, and drive away every fear and concern for our souls.
This evil prevailed among the ancient people, as it does also at this
day. Indeed the greater part of the world have ever sought flatterers,
and when God sees that men thus indulge themselves, and in a manner seek
for themselves snares, he gives loose reins to Satan and his ministers,
that they may deceive those miserable men who thus wilfully seek to be
deceived. The object, then, of Jeremiah was to remind the people often,
that all flatteries were nothing but the wiles of Satan, or some deadly
poison which stupified all their senses. For when one gives a person
poison, which extinguishes the senses of the body and the faculties of
the mind, it is all over with the miserable being who has been thus
drugged. We see a similar thing done by false teachers, who soothe
miserable sinners and promise peace to them, as we saw in our last
lecture. As, then, it was difficult to awaken men out of this stupor,
which became, as it were, innate in them, and as Satan always employs
the same intrigues, it was necessary for the holy Prophet to urge his
doctrine more and more.

<span id="vi.xxiii-p7"></span>God now says that he did *not send the
Prophets,* and yet they *ran* For this objection might have appeared
sufficient against Jeremiah, — that he was alone, and that the other
prophets were many in number. It is, indeed, the dictate of common
sense, that we ought to believe a hundred persons rather than one.
Jeremiah, then, was alone, and there was a great number of false
prophets; and the prophetic name was common to them all. It was
therefore necessary to meet this objection, which was calculated to
render God’s faithful servant contemptible. Hence he mentions the
difference between the false teachers with whom he contended and
himself, as though he had said, “I indeed am alone, but sent by God; and
I am thoroughly convinced of my legitimate calling, and am also ready to
prove that I bring no inventions of my own brain; let not, then, a false
comparison of one man with a great multitude deceive you. For the
question here is not of men or of their authority, but what we ought to
inquire is, who sends them? If God be the author of my mission, then I,
though alone, am superior to the whole world; and if they have not been
called by God, though they were a hundredfold more than they are, yet
all that they boast of means nothing, for in God alone we ought to
believe.” We now see the design of the Prophet in saying that the
prophets *ran,* but were not *sent,* that they *prophesied,* but had
received no commands from God.

<span id="vi.xxiii-p8"></span>Now this passage especially teaches us
that no one is worthy of being heard except he be a true minister of
God. But there are two things necessary to prove a person to be such — a
divine call, and faithfulness and integrity. Whosoever, then, thrusts in
himself, however he may pretend a prophetic name, may be safely
rejected, for God claims the right of being heard to himself alone. Yet
a simple and naked call is not sufficient; but he who is called must
also faithfully labor for his God; and both these things are intimated
here, for he says that the prophets ran, though they were not sent, and
that they prophesied, though they were without any command from God. I
indeed allow that the same thing is here repeated, according to common
usage, in Hebrew, in different words; yet the stronger expression is
found in the second clause, for to send belongs properly to the call,
and to command to the execution of the office. For God in the first
place chose his prophets, and committed to them the office of teaching,
and then he commanded them what to say, and dictated to them as it were
his message, that they might not bring forward anything devised by
themselves, but be only his heralds, as it has appeared elsewhere.
 <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md)

<span id="vi.xxiii-p10"></span>We hence learn also that our ears ought
not to be open to impostors, who boldly pretend the name of God, but
that we ought to distinguish between true and false teachers; for
Jeremiah does not here speak to a few men, but he addresses the whole
people. And what he designed to shew was, that they in vain sought to
escape under the pretense of ignorance, who were not attentive to sound
doctrine; for except they designedly neglected God and his word, they
might have known whom to believe. It hence follows that frivolous is the
excuse which many consider at this day to be as it were their sacred
asylum; for they plead in their own behalf they have been deceived by
false teachers. But we ought to see and to inquire whether God has sent
them, and whether they teach as coming from his school, and bring
anything but what they have received from his mouth.

<span id="vi.xxiii-p11"></span>I shall not here speak at large of God’s
call; but if any one wishes for a very short definition, let him take
the following: There is a twofold call; one is internal and the other
belongs to order, and may, therefore, be called external or
ecclesiastical. But the external call is never legitimate, except it be
preceded by the internal; for it does not belong to us to create
prophets, or apostles, or pastors, as this is the special work of the
Holy Spirit. Though then one be called and chosen by men a hundred
times, he cannot yet be deemed a legitimate minister, except he has been
called by God; for there are peculiar endowments required for the
prophetic, the apostolic, and the pastoral office, which are not in the
power or at the will of men. We hence see that the hidden call of God is
ever necessary, in order that any one may become a prophet, or an
apostle, or a pastor. But the second call belongs to order; for God will
have all things carried on by us orderly and without confusion. (<span
id="vi.xxiii-p11.1"></span>[1Co
14:40](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040.md)<span
id="vi.xxiii-p11.1"></span>.) Hence has arisen the custom of electing.
But it often happens that the call of God is sufficient, especially for
a time. For when there is no Church, there is no remedy for the evil,
except God raises up extraordinary teachers. Then the ordinary call, of
which we now speak, depends on a well-ordered state of things. Wherever
there is a Church of God, it has its own laws, it has a certain rule of
discipline: there no one should thrust in himself, so as to exercise the
prophetic or the pastoral office, though he equaled all the angels in
sanctity. But when there is no Church, God raises up teachers in an
unusual way, who are not chosen by men; for such a thing cannot be done,
where no Church is formed.

<span id="vi.xxiii-p12"></span>This subject deserves, indeed, to be much
more diffusely treated; but as I am not wont to digress unto particular
points, it is enough for me to state what the present passage requires,
which seems to be this, — that none ought to be acknowledged as God’s
servants and teachers in the Church, except those who have been sent by
God, and to whom he has, as it were, stretched forth his hand and given
them their commission. But as the internal call of God cannot be surely
known by us, we ought to see and ascertain whether he who speaks is the
organ or instrument of the Holy Spirit. For whosoever brings forward his
own figments and devises, is unworthy of being attended to. Hence, let
him who speaks shew really that he is God’s ambassador; but how can he
shew this? By speaking from the mouth of God himself; that is, let him
not bring anything of his own, but faithfully deliver, as from hand to
hand, what he has received from God. But as there might be still some
perplexity on the subject, it follows —

<span id="vi.xxiv"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiv-p1"></span><span id="vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:22](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#022.md)<span id="vi.xxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiv-p2"></span>**22**. But if they had stood in my
counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should
have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.

<span id="vi.xxiv-p3"></span>**22**. Quod si stetissent in concilio meo,
certe (*copula enim ita resolvi debet*) udire fecissent verba mea
populum meum (*hoc est,* docuissent populum meum sermones meos) et
reduxissent eos a via sua mala, et a malitia studiorum ipsorum.

<span id="vi.xxiv-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xxiv-p5"></span><span id="vi.xxiv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiv-p6"></span>This verse is as it were an explanation of
the former; for many might have been perplexed, if it had only been said
to them, that there are none who are fit and legitimate teachers but
those who had been sent and entrusted with what God had commanded. Hence
the Prophet here calls our attention to the truth which is certain and
manifest; for God had delivered the sum of all truth in his Law. As then
the perfection of wisdom was found in the Law, from which the prophets
drew whatever we read in their writings, no excuses, such as the
following, could be admitted, — “How can we know that the prophets speak
from God’s mouth, that they bring nothing devised by themselves, that
they have the instructions which God approves?”

<span id="vi.xxiv-p7"></span>The Prophet then calls the attention of the
Jews to the Law, as though He had said as Moses did,

<span id="vi.xxiv-p8"></span>“There is no need to ascend above the
clouds, or to descend into the depths, or to run beyond the sea; for the
Law and the word is nigh in thy mouth, that is, God has set before you
whatever is necessary and useful to be known.” (<span
id="vi.xxiv-p8.1"></span>[De
30:12-14](../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#012.md)<span
id="vi.xxiv-p8.1"></span>; <span id="vi.xxiv-p8.2"></span>[Ro
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006)<span id="vi.xxiv-p8.2"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.xxiv-p9"></span>This, then, is fully made known to you, nor
will the knowledge of anything necessary be obscure, if ye attend to the
Law. Hence the cause of error is not only your sloth, but also your
perverseness; for ye wilfully neglect the Law, and remain doubtful and
inquire, “Which is the way?”

<span id="vi.xxiv-p10"></span>“This is the way,” said Moses, “walk ye in
it.” (<span id="vi.xxiv-p10.1"></span>[De
5:33](../../../bib/kjv/deu005.htm#033)<span id="vi.xxiv-p10.1"></span>..md)

<span id="vi.xxiv-p11"></span>We now then perceive what Jeremiah had in
view: he had before said, that none were to be attended to, except they
who were sent and spoke from the mouth of God; but he now explains what
he meant, even that the Law contained the whole sum of wisdom. But as he
had before introduced the false prophets, as boldly deriding the true
and faithful servants of God, by objecting to them and saying, “Who had
stood in the counsel of God? these imagine that they have fallen from
the clouds, they terrify you with dreadful threatenings, as though they
were angels from heaven,” — as then the false prophets were thus wont to
speak disdainfully of God’s servants, and alleged that they did not
stand in God’s counsel, Jeremiah now retorts upon them, and says,
speaking in God’s name, *If they had stood in my counsel,* they would
doubtless have spoken from my Law; as though he had said, “They believe
not my servants, because they are men and not angels; they hence deny
that they are of my counsel: thus they persuade the whole people to
despise the doctrine of salvation. There are, however, some prophets
whom I have sent: now, if they wish to be deemed sent, let them prove
themselves to be so.” What is the true proof? If they had stood in my
counsel, they would have doubtless made known my word to my people. What
is that word? the definition follows, even the word of the Law, *They
would have turned* the straying people from their *evil way*  <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md)

<span id="vi.xxiv-p15"></span>The passage may seem obscure, but from the
context itself we can gather that the real design of the Prophet was to
convict the false teachers, that they might no longer boast of God’s
name, and falsely pretend that they were endued with the prophetic
office, and glory in that distinction. He says that it was an evident
proof that they were not God’s prophets, because they did not faithfully
teach what they ought to have derived from the Law.

<span id="vi.xxiv-p16"></span>It is indeed certain, that no one has been
God’s counsellor, according to what Scripture says in many places, when
the object is to check the arrogance of those who, in their curiosity,
attempt to penetrate into the hidden judgments of God, (<span
id="vi.xxiv-p16.1"></span>[Isa
40:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#013.md)<span
id="vi.xxiv-p16.1"></span>;) and Paul, while speaking of God’s eternal
election, it being incomprehensible, exclaims, Who has been his
counsellor? (<span id="vi.xxiv-p16.2"></span>[Romans
11](../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#000.md)<span id="vi.xxiv-p16.2"></span>:
34.) He uses a similar language in the First Epistle to the Corinthians,
(<span id="vi.xxiv-p16.3"></span>[1Co
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016)<span id="vi.xxiv-p16.3"></span>:.md)
and why? that he might check the temerity of the human mind, which
ventures farther than it is lawful. But afterwards Paul adds by way of
correction, “But we have the mind of Christ:” how so? because he has
made known his counsel to us. When, therefore, the false prophets denied
that God’s servants were his counsellors, they might indeed have said
so, viewing them only as mortal men; but their object was to discredit
and to render void the word of God; so that they wished to put a
restraint not only on men, but also on God himself. This was an
intolerable insult to God.

<span id="vi.xxiv-p17"></span>Moreover the Prophet now turns as it were
upon them, “There is then no Prophet of God in the world!” But fixed was
that saying, that there would ever be some prophets; and none of the
Jews could have dared to deny Moses to have been divinely inspired.
This, then, being allowed, the Prophet now indirectly reproves them,
“Where are the prophets of God?” and as they laid claim to this
distinction, he says, “Doubtless ye stand not in God’s counsel. How so?
because the counsel of God is included in his Law; and as ye have
departed from the doctrine of true religion, as ye have no care to
convey instruction, as your doctrine does not teach men the fear of God,
nor leads to repentance, it follows that ye are not God’s counsellors
nor his prophets.” But that this may appear more evident, we must bear
in mind what Moses said, that God has his own secret things, but that
whatever is taught in the Law belongs to us and to our children. (<span
id="vi.xxiv-p17.1"></span>[De
29:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#029.md)<span
id="vi.xxiv-p17.1"></span>.) There is then no reason why the inquiry
should be difficult respecting the true prophets of God; for they,
without controversy, deserve to be heard as the angels of God, who are
faithful interpreters of his Law; but they who lead us away from the Law
ought to be firmly and boldly rejected.

<span id="vi.xxiv-p18"></span>But we must also bear in mind the
definition that is given when it is said, that they ought to have
*turned* the people *from their evil way, and from the wickedness of
their doings*  <span id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) We indeed know
that the worst men insolently pretend to preach God’s word, as the
Papists do at this day: though they have inebriated the whole world with
their ungodly and delirious doctrines, they yet boast that they are the
servants of God. Hence the Prophet, after having spoken generally of
God’s word, adds a special distinction, — that the doctrine of God is
that which edifies, which teaches and leads men to repentance and the
fear of God, according to what Paul says, that the Scripture is useful
for these purposes, (<span id="vi.xxiv-p19.1"></span>[2Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#016)<span id="vi.xxiv-p19.1"></span>;.md)
for by so saying, he intended to condemn all false interpreters of
Scripture, as there were many then who boasted that they were the best
teachers, while yet they only pleased itching ears. As then there were
many who regarded display and not edification, Paul says, that the
Scripture is useful; and therefore he rejected with contempt all
expositions in which there was nothing useful. So also in this place the
Prophet shews that the right and legitimate use of Scripture was when it
was employed to restore men from their evil way.

<span id="vi.xxiv-p20"></span>There is, indeed, here an instance of a
part being stated for the whole: for if we only exhort men to repent,
there will be no great fruit; and our teaching would be defective, for
the doctrine of repentance would be inefficient without faith and
without calling on the name of God. But the Prophet did not intend here
to mention every part of a sound and useful doctrine; he deemed it
enough to confute the false teachers who wished to be alone in repute,
while yet they had no care to edify the people; for they saw all things
in disorder, they saw crimes prevailing everywhere, they saw a dreadful
contempt of God, but to these things they were wholly blind. It might
then have been hence easily inferred that they neither faithfully
labored for God nor manifested any care for the safety of the Church;
for they thus betrayed miserable souls, whose ruin they saw was near at
hand.

<span id="vi.xxiv-p21"></span>We now then see the whole design of the
Prophet. But there is no doubt but that to the *evil way* he added *the
wickedness of their doings,* in order that he might more fully expose
the insensibility of those who under such an urgency were silent and
remained inactive. There is sometimes the need of a moderate reproof;
but when people allow themselves an extreme license in wickedness, when
impunity is everywhere permitted, and when such corruptions prevail in
common, that nothing remains untainted, if then the tongue of the
teacher is silent and as it were tied, is he not rightly called an idle
and a dumb dog? And thus the Prophet enhances the insensibility, for
which he condemns the false teachers; they were silent, as though things
were in a good order, while they had to witness not only common crimes,
but even a vast accumulation of all kinds of crimes; for the people gave
themselves up not only to one kind of wickedness, but to all kinds, and
wholly despised God and his Law. It afterwards follows, —

<span id="vi.xxv"></span>

<span id="vi.xxv-p1"></span><span id="vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#023.md)<span id="vi.xxv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxv-p2"></span>**23** *Am* I a God at hand, saith the LORD,
and not a God afar off?

<span id="vi.xxv-p3"></span>**23**. An Deus e propinquo, dicit Jehova?
Et non Deus e longinquo?

<span id="vi.xxv-p4"></span>**24**. Can any hide himself in secret
places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven
and earth? saith the LORD.

<span id="vi.xxv-p5"></span>**24**. An absonderit vir in latebris et ego
non videbo eum, dicit Jehova? An non coelos et terram impleo, dicit
Jehova?

<span id="vi.xxv-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.xxv-p7"></span><span id="vi.xxv-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxv-p8"></span>Here he especially shakes off from
hypocrites their self-delusions; for they were torpid in their vices,
because they thought that they could in a manner blind the eyes of God.
They did not indeed say so; but the heedless security of men would,
never be so great as it is, were they to believe that nothing is hid
from God, but that he penetrates into the inmost recesses of the heart,
that he discerns between the thoughts and the feelings, and leaves not
unobserved the very marrow. If, then, this truth were fixed in the
hearts of all, they would certainly obey God with more reverence, and
also dread his threatenings.

<span id="vi.xxv-p9"></span>As, then, they are so heedlessly torpid, it
follows, that they imagine God as not having a clear sight, who sees
only things nigh him, like one who has a deficient vision, who can see
what is near at hand, but not what is far off. Such is what hypocrites
dream God to be, who after the manner of men either connives at things,
or is blind, or at least does not clearly see but what is near at hand.
We now understand the design of the Prophet in saying, that Jehovah is
God afar off as well as near at hand.

<span id="vi.xxvi"></span>

<span id="vi.xxvi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vi.xxvi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as nothing
necessary to be known for salvation is wanting in thy holy and celestial
oracles, we may carefully and diligently study them, and so labor to
make progress in the fear of thy name, in reliance on that grace which
is offered to us in Christ, that we may derive real fruit from the
reading and hearing of thy word; and may we also learn to turn
everything to edification, so that thy name may be really glorified in
us, and that we may through the whole course of our life make progress
in faith and repentance, until we shall at length attain to that perfect
holiness, to which thou daily invitest us, when we shall be wholly
divested of all the filth of our flesh, and become fully renewed after
the image of thy Son, our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="vi.xxvii"></span>

<span id="vi.xxvii-p1"></span>Lecture Eighty-Ninth

<span id="vi.xxvii-p2"></span>*Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah? and
not a God afar off? Will a man hide himself in darkness,* or in coverts,
*and I shall not see him,* or that I could not see him, *saith Jehovah?
Do not I fill heaven and earth, saith Jehovah?* Here the Prophet most
sharply reproves the hypocrites, who thought that they had no concern
with God, as is the case always with those who delude themselves in
their sins. Though this truth is ever professed by them, that God is the
judge of the world, and that an account must some time be rendered to
him; yet they afterwards think that they can by some evasion escape, so
that God will forgive them. In short, it is usual with hypocrites to
trifle as it were childishly with God. On this account, God is
grievously displeased with them, and declares that he is far different
from what they imagine him to be. For while they thus set themselves up
as arbitrators, so that they subject God to their own laws, they think
him to be as it were full of apprehension, and that he sees nothing, or
at least very little; he says, that he is not only a God *near at hand*
but also *afar off*  <span id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md)

<span id="vi.xxvii-p7"></span>Some apply this to time, as though he
denied that he lately came into existence; and so they think that the
only true and eternal God is compared with idols, which men form
presumptuously for themselves. But the other meaning is far more
suitable, — even that he is a God afar off; for as it is said elsewhere,

<span id="vi.xxvii-p8"></span>“Though he dwells on high, yet he sees
everything  
that is done on earth.” (<span id="vi.xxvii-p8.2"></span>[Ps
102:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p8.2"></span>)

<span id="vi.xxvii-p9"></span>As, then, nothing escapes his sight, he is
said to be a God afar off, while hypocrites thought him to be a God only
near at hand, as we say in French, <span id="vi.xxvii-p9.1"></span>*De
courte veue,* who sees only things near, as it were before the eyes. But
a question has much more force than if it was said, that he was not
merely a God near at hand; and this mode of speaking conveys reproof;
for hypocrites greatly detract from his majesty, when they thus,
according to their own notions, imagine that he can see no more than a
mortal man. They would not indeed have dared to speak thus; but when any
one examined all their counsels and their actions, he would have found
that they could have never shewn so much audacity, had they not deceived
themselves with the vain notion, that God could be deceived  <span
id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md) And, therefore, Jeremiah does not
relate their words, but points out the wickedness which sufficiently
manifested itself in their doings, though they professed otherwise with
their tongues.

<span id="vi.xxvii-p11"></span><span id="vi.xxvii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxvii-p12"></span>And that this is the meaning appears more
clearly from the next verse, which ought to be read in connection with
this; *Will a man hide himself in coverts, that I should not see him?*
 <span id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) This verse is added by way of
explanation; there can therefore be no doubt respecting the words, far
off and near, — that God is said to be a God afar off; because his eyes
penetrate into the lowest depths, so that nothing can escape him.

<span id="vi.xxvii-p20"></span>It is a wonder that the Greek translators
made so great a mistake; for they wholly changed the sense, — that God
is God nigh at hand, but not afar off. In the first place, they did not
consider the question, and then, as they did not see the drift of the
passage, they contrived from their own brains what is wholly remote from
the words of the Prophet. This sentiment, that God is nigh and not afar
off, is indeed true; but what is meant here is quite another thing, —
that God sees in a way very different from men, for he fully and
perfectly sees what is farthest from him, according to the passage we
have quoted from <span id="vi.xxvii-p20.1"></span>[Ps
102:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#019.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p20.1"></span>; and there is another in <span
id="vi.xxvii-p20.2"></span>[Ps
139:7-12](../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#007.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p20.2"></span>, where the Psalmist says,

<span id="vi.xxvii-p21"></span>“Where shall I flee from thy face? for if
I ascend into heaven, thou art there; if I lie down in hell, there thou
stretchest forth thine hand; if I take the wings of the dawn and fly to
the clouds, even thine hand will lay hold of me there; if I seek
coverts, even the night itself is before thee as the light, and darkness
shines as the light.”

<span id="vi.xxvii-p22"></span>If, then, we join together these two
passages, there will appear nothing ambiguous in the words of Jeremiah,
— even that God penetrates with his eyes into the lowest depths, so that
nothing is hid from him.

<span id="vi.xxvii-p23"></span>But Jeremiah not only explains the
meaning of the last verse, but also makes a practical use of it; *Will
any one,* he says, *hide himself in coverts that I should not see him?*
The seeing of God has a reference to his judgment. Then all frivolous
speculations ought to be cast aside, since Scripture says that God sees
all things; but we ought especially to consider for what purpose it is
that he sees all things; which is evidently this, — that he may at last
call to judgment whatever is done by men. There is then an application
of the doctrine to our case; for we hence learn, that whatsoever we do,
think, and speak, is known to God.

<span id="vi.xxvii-p24"></span>By *coverts,* or hiding-places, he means
all the secret frauds which men think they can cover; but by such an
attempt they gain nothing but a heavier judgment. By coverts then we are
to understand all those vain thoughts which hypocrites entertain; for
they think that they can so hide themselves that God cannot see their
purposes. Hence God laughs them to scorn, and says in effect, “Let them
enter into their coverts, let them hide themselves as much as they
please, I yet do see them in their coverts no less clearly than if they
were quite close to me.”

<span id="vi.xxvii-p25"></span>To confirm this he adds, *Do not I fill
heaven and earth, saith Jehovah?* This must not be refinedly explained
of the infinite essence of God. It is indeed true, that his essence
extends through heaven and earth, as it is interminable. But Scripture
will not have us to feed on frivolous and unprofitable notions; it
teaches only what avails to promote true religion. What therefore God
declares here, that he fills heaven and earth, ought to be applied to
his providence and his power; as though he had said, that he is not so
taken up with things in heaven that he neglects the concerns of earth,
as profane men dream; but he is said to fill heaven and earth, because
he governs all things, because all things are noticed by him, because he
is, in short, the judge of the world.

<span id="vi.xxvii-p26"></span>We now perceive what the Prophet means;
and this passage is entitled to particular notice, because this error of
imagining a God like ourselves is inbred almost in us all. Hence it is,
that men allow themselves so much liberty; for they consider it a light
thing to discharge their duty towards God, because they reflect not what
sort of being he is, but they think of him according to their own
understanding and character. As, then, we are thus gross in our ideas,
it becomes us carefully to reflect on this passage, where God declares,
that he is not only a God *near at hand,* that is, that he is not like
us, who have only a limited power of seeing, but that he sees in the
thickest darkness as well as in the clearest light; and that therefore
it avails those nothing to deceive themselves who dig for themselves
caverns, as it is said in Isaiah, and hide themselves in deep
labyrinths. (<span id="vi.xxvii-p26.1"></span>[Isa
2:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#021.md)<span
id="vi.xxvii-p26.1"></span>.) He thus denies that they gain anything,
and gives this as the reason,

<span id="vi.xxvii-p27"></span>“Because he fills heaven and earth;”

<span id="vi.xxvii-p28"></span>that is, his providence, his power, and
his justice are so diffused everywhere, that wherever men betake
themselves, it is impossible for them to be concealed from him. It
follows, —

<span id="vi.xxviii"></span>

<span id="vi.xxviii-p1"></span><span
id="vi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#025.md)<span id="vi.xxviii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxviii-p2"></span>**25**. I have heard what the prophets
said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have
dreamed.

<span id="vi.xxviii-p3"></span>**25**. Audivi quod dicunt (*vel,* quid
dicant,) prophetae prophetantes in nomine meo, dicendo, somniavi,
somniavi.

<span id="vi.xxviii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xxviii-p5"></span><span id="vi.xxviii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxviii-p6"></span>Jeremiah returns again to those impostors
who soothed the people with their blandishments. Whenever Jeremiah and
those who were like him, who faithfully performed their office, treated
the people with severity by reproving and threatening them for their
sins, these unprincipled men rose up against, them, and under the name
of prophets flattered the ungodly despisers of God. It was, as we have
before said, a most grievous trial, when in the very Church itself the
ministers of Satan thus falsely pretended the name of God. The Jews
would have unhesitantly despised and laughed to scorn what the vain
prophets of the Gentiles might have boasted; for they knew that these
had no knowledge of God; but when the false prophets of whom he now
speaks occupied a place in the Church, and in high terms boasted that
they were God’s servants, this would have greatly disturbed the weak and
shaken their faith, and even wholly upset it, had not God stretched
forth his hand. It is therefore no wonder that Jeremiah dwells so much
on this subject; for it was an evil that could not be easily cured; had
he said only, that they were not to be esteemed, the weak would not have
been satisfied. It was hence necessary for him often to repeat this
truth, that they were all to know that there was need of discrimination
and judgment, and that those who pretended God’s name were not to be
indiscriminately allowed to be his prophets.

<span id="vi.xxviii-p7"></span>He then repeats what we have before
observed, but in other words, — I *have heard,* says God, *what the
prophets say who prophesy in my name*  <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) An objection is anticipated, for it
might have been said, “What can this mean? the prophets disagree! and
what is to be done under these dissensions? they who differ dazzle our
eyes with an illustrious title, and boldly affirm that they have been
sent by God. As, then, there is such a conflict between the prophets,
what are we to do?” God meets this objection, and declares that it was
not unknown to him what the false prophets boasted of. He adds, that
they *prophesied in his name* It was an offense, which must have greatly
distressed weak minds, to hear of this profanation of God’s name. For as
it behoves us reverently to receive what proceeds from God, so it is no
small danger when God’s name is falsely and mendaciously pretended. As,
then, they might have been greatly disturbed by this false pretext of
what was good, it is here expressly said, that they had used the name of
God, but he adds, *falsely*

<span id="vi.xxviii-p11"></span>We hence see the truth of what I have
said, that those who affirm that they are prophets and ostentatiously
pretend God’s name, ought not to be received indiscriminately, but that
judgment ought to be exercised; for it has been God’s will in all ages
to try the faith of his servants by permitting to Satan and his
ministers the liberty of pretending falsely his holy name. And as we see
that the Church has ever been exposed to this evil, there is no cause
for us to be disturbed at this day, when the same thing happens, for it
is nothing new. Let us, therefore, learn to harden ourselves against
such trials; and whenever false prophets try our faith, let; us remain
firm, holding this principle, — that we ought wisely to consider,
whether God himself speaks, or whether men falsely boast themselves to
be his servants.

<span id="vi.xxviii-p12"></span>To *dream* is to be taken here in a good
sense; for, as we have seen elsewhere, God was wont to make himself
known to his servants by dreams. It is not then every kind of dreams
that is to be understood here, but, such dreams as were from above. The
false prophets, indeed, stated what was not true by using this language;
for it was the same as though they testified that they did not bring
their own devices, but faithfully related what they had received from
God. As the Pope at this day declares that he is the vicar of Christ and
the successor of Peter, while he exercises tyranny over the Church; so
also these, by a specious pretext, deceived the simple by saying that
they brought nothing human, but were only witnesses as to God’s oracles.
It follows, —

<span id="vi.xxix"></span>

<span id="vi.xxix-p1"></span><span id="vi.xxix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:26-27](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xxix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxix-p2"></span>**26**. How long shall *this* be in the
heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, *they are* prophets of
the deceit of their own heart;

<span id="vi.xxix-p3"></span>**26**. Quosque erit in corde prophetarum

<span id="vi.xxix-p4"></span>**27**. Which think to cause my people to
forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his
neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.

<span id="vi.xxix-p5"></span>**27**. Cogitantes ut faciant oblivisci
populum meum nominis mei per somnia sua (vel, in somniis suis, ad
verbum,) qua narrant quisque socio suo; quemadmodum obliti sunt patres
eorum nominis mei in Baal.

<span id="vi.xxix-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.xxix-p7"></span><span id="vi.xxix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxix-p8"></span>Here God reproves the false prophets, and
also promises to his people what was especially to be desired, — that he
would cleanse his Church from such pollutions. He then shews that it was
his purpose to take vengeance, because the false prophets had dared in
such an impious and bold manner to abuse his sacred name. For it ever
occurred to their minds, “How is it that God permits this? Is it because
he cares not for the safety of his people? or does it give him any
delight when he sees truth mingled with falsehood, and light with
darkness?” Hence God here shews that he for a time bore with that
sacrilegious audacity which the false prophets practiced, but that he
did not so connive at it as not at length to punish them.

<span id="vi.xxix-p9"></span>*How long?* he says, which is the same as
though he had said, “It shall not be perpetual; though I may delay, yet
they shall know that they have with extreme perverseness abused my
forbearance.” And he also enhances their crime by saying, *How long
shall it be in the heart of the prophets to prophesy falsehood?* By this
way of speaking he intimates, that they erred not through ignorance, as
many do, who through want of knowledge bring forth what they do not
understand; but God here complains that these prophets, as it were
designedly, rose up to suppress the truth. Then by *heart* is to be
understood thought or purpose; as though he had said, that they
designedly made a false pretense as to his name, that it was their
settled purpose to deceive the people.  <span
id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md)

<span id="vi.xxix-p13"></span>He adds, that they were *prophets of the
deceit of their own heart.* This deceit of the heart is put in
opposition to true doctrine; and thus God intimates that whatever men
bring forward from themselves is deceitful, for nothing can proceed from
them but vanity. There is yet no doubt but that he condemns that foolish
conceit, of which the false prophets proudly boasted, that they were
alone wise, as the case is now under the Papacy; how arrogantly do
unprincipled men prattle whenever they speak of their own figments?
Nothing can be more silly, and yet they think that they surpass the
angels in acuteness and in high speculations. Such was the arrogance
displayed by the false prophets of old. But God declares that whatever
men invent, and whatever they devise, which they have not received from
his mouth, is only the *deceit of the heart.*

<span id="vi.xxix-p14"></span>And this ought to be carefully noticed;
for there are many plausible refinements, in which there is nothing
solid, but they are mere trifles. If, then, at any time these vain
thoughts seem pleasing to us, let us bear in mind what Jeremiah says
here, that whatever proceeds not from God is the *deceit of the heart;*
and further, that though the whole world applaud falsehoods and
impostures, we ought yet to know that everything is a deceit which has
not God himself as its author.

<span id="vi.xxix-p15"></span><span id="vi.xxix-p15.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxix-p16"></span>Then follows a clearer definition, that
they *made his people to forget his name by their dreams, as their
fathers had forgotten it through Baal.*  <span
id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) We may infer from this verse, that
those with whom Jeremiah contended were not openly the enemies of the
Law; for they held many principles of true religion. They maintained in
common with the true and sincere worshippers of God this truth, — that
the only true God ought to be worshipped; and also this, — that there
was only one legitimate altar on which sacrifices according to the Law
were to be offered. On these points, then, there was no controversy. But
yet they deceived the people by their flatteries; for they made gain of
their prophetic office. Hence Jeremiah condemns them, because they made
God’s name to be forgotten by their dreams, as their fathers had
forgotten it through Baal; as though he had said, “These dreams are like
the fictitious and spurious forms of worship, by which true religion was
formerly subverted; for their fathers worshipped Baal and Baalim: they
set up for themselves these false gods, and thus subverted the glory of
God by their own devices.” The impiety of the false prophets, who lived
in the time of Jeremiah, was not indeed so gross; and yet it was an
indirect defection, for they brought forward their dreams, and falsely
professed that. they were God’s servants, though he had not commissioned
them.

<span id="vi.xxix-p18"></span>We have said elsewhere (<span
id="vi.xxix-p18.1"></span>[Jer
23:21](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#021)<span id="vi.xxix-p18.1"></span>.md)
that their crime was twofold; first, they ran when not called nor sent;
and secondly, they brought forward their own fancies and not the word of
God. And this passage ought to be carefully noticed; for we here learn,
that not only open defection cannot be endured by God, but also indirect
depravations, which stealthily withdraw us from the fear of God. Then
these two evils must be carefully avoided in the Church, if we desire to
continue entire in our obedience to God. One evil is sufficiently known,
that is, when truth is openly turned into falsehood, when men are drawn
away into idolatry and filthy superstitions, or when the ancient people,
as Jeremiah says, forgat the name of God through Baal. But the other
evil is more hidden, and therefore more dangerous, that is, when some
appearance of true religion is retained, and men are yet insidiously
drawn away from the fear of God and his true worship, and from pure
doctrine, as we see to be the case at this day in the Churches, which
profess to have separated from the Papacy that they might embrace the
doctrine of the Gospel: there are many among them who insidiously
corrupt the simple and genuine doctrine of the Gospel. We see how many
curious men there are at this time, who disturb all things by their own
inventions, and how absurdly many seek refinements, and how confidently
also do many propound their own inventions as oracles! It behoves us
then to be watchful, not only that we may shun open abominations, but
that we may also retain the pure and true word of God, so as not to
allow false workers insidiously to corrupt and vitiate anything. It
follows, —

<span id="vi.xxx"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p1"></span><span id="vi.xxx-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:28](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#028.md)<span id="vi.xxx-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p2"></span>**28**. The prophet that hath a dream, let
him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word
faithfully. What *is* the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD.

<span id="vi.xxx-p3"></span>**28**. Propheta apud quem est somnium,
narrabit somnium; et apud quem est sermo meus, narrabit sermonem meum
veritatis: quid palae ad triticum, dicit Jehova?

<span id="vi.xxx-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xxx-p5"></span><span id="vi.xxx-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p6"></span>We ought also to read this verse
attentively, for doubtless it contains a doctrine especially useful. I
have already said, that the faith of many might have failed at seeing a
conflict in the Temple of God, not only among the common people, but
also among the prophets of God. God did not appear from heaven, nor did
he send his angels, but would have himself to be heard through men. They
who came to the Temple expected the prophets to teach them. There the
ministers of Satan appeared, who corrupted and perverted all things.
There were a few, who sincerely declared the truth of God, and
faithfully explained what God commanded. What could miserable men do in
this case, who were willing to obey, and possessed a teachable spirit?
Hence it was, that many threw aside every concern for religion, and gave
themselves up to despair: “What means all this? why are there so many
discords, so many disputes, so many contentions, so many invectives?
Where can we now betake ourselves? It is better not to care for anything
any more.” Thus many took occasion to indulge their indifference,
choosing not to weary themselves any more, nor to seek what God was,
what his will was, whether there was salvation for them, whether there
was any hope, rather than to entangle themselves in troublesome and
thorny disputes.

<span id="vi.xxx-p7"></span>Such a temptation existed in the time of
Jeremiah. He, therefore, applied in due time a suitable remedy and said,
*The Prophet, who has a dream,* that is, with whom is a dream, *he will
relate a dream;* and then, *The Prophet with whom is my word, he will
speak my word;*  <span id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) as though God
had said, that it was all extremely wicked thing to obstruct the way of
truth by falsehood. But this is what usually happens, as I have already
said; for where Satan has his agents, an obstacle seems to be in our way
which prevents us to go on and proceed in the course of true religion.
For when those who are right-minded, as we have said, see the prophets
themselves contending, disputing, and quarrelling, they stand still,
nay, they go backward. Now God shews that this is extremely
unreasonable. Then the meaning is, as though he had said, “Let not the
false prophets by Their fallacies impede the course of God’s servants,
that they may not proceed, and that his word should not be reverently
heard.”

<span id="vi.xxx-p9"></span>Unless we attend to this which the Prophet
had in view, the passage will appear unmeaning. It has been often
quoted, but this circumstance has not certainly been observed. We ought,
therefore, ever to consider, why is a thing said. This verse depends on
what is gone before; and God here answers a question, which might have
been raised, — “What then must we do, for falsehoods conflict with
truth?” God answers, that his word ought not to be prejudiced by this
circumstance; as though he had said, “Let nothing prevent my Prophets
from teaching; I bid them to be heard.” We hence conclude, that those do
wrong to God, who allege the controversies, by which religion is torn
and as it were lacerated, and think that they thus obtain a license to
indulge their impiety; for it is not a reason that can avail them, that
Satan and his ministers labor to discredit the authority of God and of
his servants. Though these false prophets insinuate themselves, though
they may set up themselves against the true and faithful servants of
God, yet let dreams, that is, prophetic revelations, retain their
weight, and *let him with whom is God’s word, speak the word of God,* so
that it may be heard. This clause refers to the hearers; they were not
to desist from rendering obedience to the Law, how much soever Satan
might strive to subvert their faith by attempting to destroy its unity.

<span id="vi.xxx-p10"></span>It afterwards follows, *What is the chaff
to the wheat?* This addition was also wholly necessary, for many might
have again objected and said, that they had no sufficient judgment to
distinguish between the true and false prophets. God here gives the
answer, that the difference between true and false doctrine was nothing
less to him who made a careful examination than between wheat and chaff
And by this comparison he shews how foolishly and absurdly many detract
from the authority of the Law on this *pretense,* that there are many
who falsely interpret it. For when any one rejects the wheat because it
is covered with chaff, does he not deserve to perish through hunger? and
who will pity him who says that he has indeed wheat on his floor, but
that it is mixed with chaff, and therefore not fit for food? Why, then,
thou silly man, dost not thou separate the chaff from the wheat? But
thou choosest to perish through want, rather than to cleanse the wheat
that thou mayest have it for thy food. So also in the Temple the wheat
is often mixed with the chaff, the pure truth of God is often defiled
with many glosses and vain figments; and yet, except it be our own
fault, we shall be able to distinguish between the wheat and the chaff.
 <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) But if we be negligent, and
think that it is a sufficient excuse for despising the word of God,
because Satan brings in his fallacies, we shall perish in our sloth like
him who neglects to cleanse his wheat that he might turn it to bread.
But the time will not allow me to say more.

<span id="vi.xxxi"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxi-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vi.xxxi-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as thou art
graciously pleased daily to set before us thy sure and certain will, we
may open our eyes and cars, and raise all our thoughts to that which not
only reveals to us what is right, but also confirms us in a sound mind,
so that we may go on in the course of true religion, and never turn
aside, whatever Satan and his ministers may devise against us, but that
we may stand firm and persevere, until having finished our warfare, we
shall, at length come unto that blessed rest which has been prepared for
us in heaven by Jesus Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="vi.xxxii"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxii-p1"></span>Lecture Ninetieth

<span id="vi.xxxii-p2"></span>We saw yesterday that though the false
prophets corrupted the true doctrine, yet the prophetic office remained
in its honor without any loss to its authority. Hence Jeremiah said that
all their fallacies ought not to be an hinderance to the faithful, so as
to prevent them to proceed in the course of their calling, and that no
one should object and say, that in so confused a state of things he
could not know what to avoid and what to follow; he said that the
difference between wheat and chaff was easily perceived, provided men
were not wilfully blind. He now adds, —

<span id="vi.xxxiii"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p1"></span><span
id="vi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#029.md)<span id="vi.xxxiii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p2"></span>**29** *Is* not my word like as a fire?
saith the LORD; and like a hammer *that* breaketh the rock in pieces?

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p3"></span>**29**. An non ut sit sermo meus quasi
ignis (*hoc est,* an non sermo meus tanquam ignis) dicit Jehova? Et
tanquam malleus conterens saxum (*vel,* rupem.)

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p5"></span><span id="vi.xxxiii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p6"></span>He confirms what he said of the chaff and
the wheat, but in different words. It was a fit comparison when Jeremiah
compared God’s word to wheat, and the figments of men to chaff. But as
the Jews, through their ingratitude, rendered the word of God
ineffectual, so it did not become to them a spiritual support, the
Prophet says that it would become like *a fire* and like a *hammer,*
 <span id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) as though he had said, that
though the Jews were void of judgment, as they had become hardened in
their wickedness, yet the word of God could not be rendered void, or at
least its power could not be taken away; for as Paul says,

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p10"></span>“If it is not the odor of life unto
life, it is the odor of death unto death to those who perish,” (<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p10.1"></span>[2Co
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p10.1"></span>)

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p11"></span>and so also the same Apostle says in
another place, that God’s servants had vengeance in their power, for
they bear the spiritual sword, in order to cast down every height that
exalteth itself against Christ; but he adds,

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p12"></span>“After the obedience” of the faithful
“had been completed.”  
(<span id="vi.xxxiii-p12.2"></span>[2Co
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#006.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p12.2"></span>)

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p13"></span>The first and as it were the natural use
of God’s word is to bring salvation to men; and hence it is called food;
but it turns into poison to the reprobate: and this is the reason for so
great a diversity.

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p14"></span>He said, first, that God’s word was
wheat, because souls are nourished by it unto a celestial life; and
nothing can be more delightful than this comparison. But now he declares
it to be *fire* and a *hammer* There is in these terms some appearance
of contradiction; but there is a distinction to be made as to the
hearers, for they who reverently embrace the word of God, as it becomes
them, and with genuine docility of faith, find it to be food to them;
but the ungodly, as they are unworthy of such a benefit, find it to be
far otherwise. For the word which is in itself life-giving, is changed
into fire, which consumes and devours them; and also it becomes a hammer
to break, to tear them in pieces, and to destroy them.

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p15"></span>The import of the whole is, that God’s
word ever retains its own dignity; for if it happens to be despised by
men, it cannot yet be deprived of its vigor and efficacy; if it be not
wholesome for food, it will be like fire or like a hammer. Then these
two comparisons belong to the wicked, for God’s word has another sense
when called fire with reference to the faithful, even because it dries
up and consumes the lusts of the flesh, as silver and gold are purified
by fire. Hence the word of God is properly and fitly called fire, even
with regard to the faithful; but not a devouring but a refining fire.
But when it comes to the reprobate, it must necessarily destroy them,
for they receive not the grace that it offers to them. It may also be
called a hammer, for it subdues the depraved affections of the flesh and
such as are opposed to God even in the elect; but it does not break the
elect, for they suffer themselves to be subdued by it.

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p16"></span>But this *hammer* is said to break the
stone or the rock because the reprobate will not hear to be corrected;
they must, therefore, be necessarily broken and destroyed. For this
reason Paul also, while speaking of the refractory, says,

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p17"></span>“Let him who is ignorant be ignorant.”  
(<span id="vi.xxxiii-p17.2"></span>[1Co
14:38](../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#038.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p17.2"></span>)

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p18"></span>For by these words he means that they
will at last find how great is the hardness of that word with which they
dare to contend through the perverseness of their heart. But that
passage which I have before quoted well explains what is here said by
Jeremiah, even that truth in itself is wholesome, but that it turns into
an odor of death unto death to those who perish. (<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p18.1"></span>[2Co
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiii-p18.1"></span>.) Paul, indeed, speaks of the Gospel, but
this may be also applied to the Law. It now follows, —

<span id="vi.xxxiv"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p1"></span><span id="vi.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:30-32](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#030.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p2"></span>**30**. Therefore, behold, I *am* against
the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his
neighbour.

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p3"></span>**30**. Propterea ecce ego ad *(vel,*
super) prophetas, dicit Jehova, qui furantur sermones meos, quisque a
socio suo:

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p4"></span>**31**. Behold, I *am* against the
prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p5"></span>**31**. Ecce ego ad *(vel,* super, *vel,*
contra) prophetas, dicit Jehova, qui mollificant *(vel,* tollunt)
linguam suam, et dicunt, sermo *(vel,* dictio:)

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p6"></span>**32**. Behold, I *am* against them that
prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my
people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them
not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at
all, saith the LORD.

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p7"></span>**32**. Ecce ego super *(vel,* ad, *vel,*

decipiunt populum meum in mendaciis suis et levitate sua; et ego *(hoc

utilitate non proderunt (proficiendo non afferent utilitatem) populo
huic, dicit Jehova.

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p8"></span> 

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p9"></span><span id="vi.xxxiv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p10"></span>Jeremiah returns again to the false
teachers, who were the authors of all the evils; for they fascinated the
people with their flatteries, so that every regard for sound and
heavenly doctrine was almost extinguished. But while God declares that
he is an avenger against them, he does not exempt the people from
punishment. We indeed know that a just reward was rendered to the
reprobate, when God let loose the reins to the ministers of Satan with
impunity to deceive them. But as the people acquiesced in those false
allurements, while Jeremiah so severely reproved the false teachers, he
reminds the people how foolishly they betook themselves under the shadow
of those men, thinking themselves to be safe.

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p11"></span>He says, first, *Behold, I am, against
the prophets, who steal my words every one from his neighbor.* Many
explain this verse as though God condemned the false prophets, who
borrowed something from the true prophets, so that they might be their
rivals and as it were their apes; and no doubt the ungodly teachers had
ever from the beginning made some assumptions, that they might be deemed
God’s servants. But it seems, however, a forced view, that they stole
words from the true prophets, for the words express what is different,
that they stole *every one from his friend* Jeremiah would not have
called God’s faithful servants by this name. I rather think that their
secret arts are here pointed out, that they secretly and designedly
conspired among themselves, and then that they spread abroad their own
figments according to their usual manner. For the ungodly and the
perfidious, that they might obtain credit among the simple and unwary,
consulted together and devised all their measures craftily, that they
might not be immediately found out; and thus one took from the other
what he afterwards announced and published. And this is what Jeremiah
calls stealing, because they secretly consulted, and then declared to
the people what they agreed upon among themselves; and they did this as
though every one had derived his oracle from heaven. I have, therefore,
no doubt but that the Prophet condemns these hidden consultations when
he says that every one stole from his neighhour.  <span
id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md)

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p13"></span>We indeed see the same thing now under
the Papacy, for the monks and unprincipled men of the same character
have their own false doctrines; and when they ascend the pulpit, every
one speaks as though he was endued with some special gift; and yet they
steal every one from his friend, for they are like the soothsayers or
the magi, who concocted among themselves their own falsehoods, and only
brought out what they deemed necessary to delude the common people.
This, then, was one of the vices which the Prophet shews prevailed among
the false teachers, — that no one attended to the voice of God, but that
every one took furtively from his friend what he afterwards openly
proclaimed.

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p14"></span><span id="vi.xxxiv-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p15"></span>He adds, secondly, *Behold, I am against
the prophets, who mollify their own tongue* Almost all interpreters take
<span id="vi.xxxiv-p15.1"></span>הקל, *lekech,* as signifying to render
sweet or soft; and they understand that the false prophets are
condemned, because they flattered the wicked for the sake of gain; for
had they offended or exasperated them, they could not have attached them
to themselves. They then think that to mollify their tongue means here
that they used their tongue in speaking smooth and flattering things.
But others give another explanation, — that they mollified their tongue
because they polished their words in imitation of God’s servants, so
that their speech was sweeter than honey. But as <span
id="vi.xxxiv-p15.2"></span>הקל, *lekech,* means to receive and to take,
and sometimes to raise on high, and sometimes to carry, I see not why it
should not be taken in its proper meaning. I certainly see no reason to
turn its meaning to a metaphor, when it can be taken in its plain sense
of raising their tongue; they elevated themselves, and in high terms
boasted that the office of teaching had been committed to them, for we
know how haughtily false teachers elevate themselves. Therefore the
verse may be taken thus, that God would punish those impostors who
raised their tongue, that is, who proudly boasted and boldly arrogated
to themselves authority, as though they were messengers from heaven.
 <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md)

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p18"></span>It afterwards follows, *And they say,*
<span id="vi.xxxiv-p18.1"></span>םאנ, *nam,* *he saith.* We know that it
was a common thing for all the prophets to add, <span
id="vi.xxxiv-p18.2"></span>הוהי םאנ, *nam Jeve,* the saying of Jehovah,
or the word of Jehovah, in order to shew that they said nothing but what
they had received from above. And if we read this verse as connected
together, we shall find true what I have said — that the verb <span
id="vi.xxxiv-p18.3"></span>הקל, *lekech,* does not mean the smoothness
or adulation used, but, the lofty vaunting of the false teachers, who
wished to be deemed the organs of the Holy Spirit, and assumed to
themselves all the authority of God. For their elation was this, that
they confidently boasted that God himself had spoken, and said that it
was *the word;* and they did this, that whatever they prattled might
appear indisputed, though it was sufficiently evident that they falsely
pretended the name of God.

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p19"></span><span id="vi.xxxiv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p20"></span>He adds, thirdly, *Behold, I am against
those who prophesy dreams of falsehood* It was indeed necessary to say
here, that though the false teachers arrogated to themselves what alone
belonged to the servants of God, they were yet mendacious. He afterwards
adds, *They narrate them, and cause my people to err by their falsehoods
and their levity* The meaning is, that however proudly they might, have
pretended the name of prophets, they were yet impostors, who deceived
the people by narrating to them their false dreams. The word *dream* is
taken here in a good sense, but the word added to it, shews that they
boasted of dreams which were only their own; and this is again confirmed
when Jeremiah says, that they deceived the people by *their falsehoods;*
and he adds, by *their levity,*  <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md)
which some render “flattery.” I doubt not but that it means their
inventions, which were vain, because they proceeded only from vain
presumption.

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p24"></span>He adds, *Though I sent them not nor
commanded them* This negation ought especially to be noticed; for God
shews how we are to form a judgment, when a question is raised
respecting true and false teachers. Whatever, therefore, is without
God’s command is like the wind, and will of itself vanish away. There
is, then, no solidity in anything but in God’s command. Hence it
follows, that all those who speak according to their own fancies are
mendacious, and that whatever they bring forward has no weight in it;
for God sets these two things in opposition the one to the other; on the
one side are falsehood and levity, and on the other, his command and his
call. It hence follows, that no one, except he simply obeys God and
faithfully declares what he has received from him, can be of any
account; for his whole weight is lighter than a feather, and all his
apparent wisdom is falsehood.

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p25"></span>At last he says, that they *would not
profit his people* In which words he warns the people to shun them as
the plague. But we see how the world indulges itself in this respect;
for they who are drowsy seek to absolve themselves on the plea of
ignorance, and throw the blame on their pastors, as though they were
themselves beyond the reach of danger. But the Lord here reminded the
people, that the teachers whom they received were pestilent; though for
another reason he testified that they were useless, and that in order
that he might shake off the vain confidence of the Jews, who were wont
to set up this shield against all God’s threatenings, that their false
teachers promised them wonderful things. It follows, —

<span id="vi.xxxv"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxv-p1"></span><span id="vi.xxxv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#033.md)<span id="vi.xxxv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxv-p2"></span>**33**. And when this people, or the
prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What *is* the burden of
the LORD? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even
forsake you, saith the LORD.

<span id="vi.xxxv-p3"></span>**33**. Quod si interrogaverint to populus
hic, vel Propheta, vel Sacerdos, dicendo. Quod onus Jehovae? Tunc dices
illis, Quod onus? Derelinquam vos, inquit Jehova.

<span id="vi.xxxv-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xxxv-p5"></span><span id="vi.xxxv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxv-p6"></span>It appears sufficiently evident from this
passage, — that the contumacy of the Jews was so great, that they sought
from every quarter some excuse for their insensibility, as though they
could with impunity despise God when they rejected his word. For the
devil by his artifice fascinates the reprobate, when he renders God’s
word either hateful or contemptible; and whenever he can exasperate
their minds, so that they hear not God’s word except with disdain and
bitterness, he gains fully his object. The Jews, then, were led into
such a state of mind, that they regarded God’s word with hatred; and
they were thus alienated from all docility and from every care for
religion. In short, the prophets, as it is well known, everywhere employ
the word <span id="vi.xxxv-p6.1"></span>אשמ, *mesha,* which means a
burden.

<span id="vi.xxxv-p7"></span>Now, a burden means a prophecy, which
terrifies the despisers of God by threatening them with vengeance. As,
then, their minds were exasperated, they called through hatred the word
of God a burden, and used it as a proverbial saying, “It is a burden, a
burden.” They ought to have been moved by God’s threatenings, and to
have trembled on hearing that he was angry with them. The word burden,
then, ought to have humbled them; but, on the contrary, they became
exasperated, first, through haughtiness, then through an indomitable
contumacy, and thirdly, they kindled into rage. We hence see how the
expression arose, that the prophets called their prophecies burdens. God
now severely condemns this fury, because they hesitated not thus openly
to shew their insolence. It was surely a most shameful thing, that the
word of God should be thus called in disdain and contempt, in the ways
and streets; for they thus acted disdainfully and insolently against
God; for it was the same as though they treated his word with open
contempt. It was then no wonder that he reproved this fury with so much
vehemence, by saying, *But if this people ask thee, What is the burden
of Jehovah?*

<span id="vi.xxxv-p8"></span>This manner of asking was altogether
derisive, when they said to Jeremiah and to other servants of God, “What
is the burden?” that is, “What dost thou bring to us, what trouble is to
come on us?” They thus not only spoke contemptuously of God’s word, but,
as though this wickedness was not sufficient, they became, as I have
said, irritated and exasperated. If, then, *they ask thee, What is the
burden?* And he speaks not only of the common people, but of the very
prophets and priests.

<span id="vi.xxxv-p9"></span>We hence learn how great a contempt for God
then prevailed, so that there was no integrity either in the priestly or
the prophetic order. It is indeed wonderful with what impudence they
dared to boast themselves to be God’s servants, while they spoke with so
much insolence! But the same thing happens in the world in our day; for
we see that the ministers of Satan in no other way hold the world under
their power, than by alluring the minds of the ungodly; and at the same
time they cause God’s word to be hated, and say that it brings not only
troubles, but also torments. Since, then, these unprincipled men, who
thus lead with hatred and disdain the true doctrine, occupy pulpits, we
need not wonder that the same evil prevailed in the ancient Church.

<span id="vi.xxxv-p10"></span>It follows: *If a prophet or a priest ask
thee, What is the burden of Jehovah? thou shalt say to them, What
burden? I will forsake thee, saith Jehovah.* This was a most grievous
threatening, but it has not been well considered and rightly understood;
for interpreters have overlooked the implied contrast between the
presence and the absence of God. Nothing could have been more acceptable
to the Jews than God’s silence. And yet in no other way does he more
clearly show that he is a Father to us, caring for our salvation, than
by familiarly addressing us. Whenever, then, the prophetic word is
announced, we have a sure and a clear evidence of God’s presence, as
though he wished to be connected with us. But when the ungodly not only
reject so remarkable a benefit, but also furiously repel, as far as they
can, such a favor, they desire and seek the absence of God. Therefore
God says, “Ye cannot bear my word, by which symbol I shew that I am
present with you; *I will forsake you;”* that is, “I will no longer
endure this indignity, but I will depart from you; there shall be
hereafter no *prophecy.”*  <span id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115.md)

<span id="vi.xxxv-p15"></span>At the first view this was not deemed
grievous to the Jews; for as I have said, the ungodly desire nothing
more than that God should be silent, and they thought that they had
gained their greatest happiness, when with consciences lulled to sleep
they indulged themselves in their filth. It was then their chief wish
that God should depart from them. But yet there was nothing more to be
dreaded. The Prophet then shews here that they were extremely infatuated
and wholly fascinated by the devil, for they could desire nothing more
dreadful than that God should depart from them; as though he had said,
“My word is a weariness to you, and I in my turn will now avenge myself,
for I am weary of forbearing you, when I see that you can by no means be
healed; and as I have been hitherto assiduous in instructing you, and
have found you unteachable, I will now in my turn leave you.” It
follows, —

<span id="vi.xxxvi"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvi-p1"></span><span id="vi.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#034.md)<span id="vi.xxxvi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvi-p2"></span>**34**. And *as for* the prophet, and the
priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will
even punish that man and his house.

<span id="vi.xxxvi-p3"></span>**34**. Et propheta et sacerdos et populus
qui dixerit, Onus Jehovae, visitabo super virum illum (hoc est,
quicunque fuerit, sive propheta, sive sacerdos, sive homo quispiam
vulgaris, visitabo super virum illum,) et super domum ejus.

<span id="vi.xxxvi-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xxxvi-p5"></span><span id="vi.xxxvi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvi-p6"></span>Prophecy might indeed have been called a
burden, when anything sad was announced; but it might also have been so
called, when men were aroused to fear God, or when they were exhorted to
repent. But God has a reference here to that wicked impiety, when men
dared in ridicule to call any prophecy a burden. And hence it appears,
that they were all so given up to their sins, that the very name of
God’s judgment was hated by them. We now then perceive the Prophet’s
meaning when he said, that God would punish all those who called his
word a burden; for the Prophets themselves were wont to speak thus; and
we find that Jeremiah in many places used this word. He does not then
speak here generally, but points out, as by the finger, a vice which
prevailed; for the Jews had so hardened themselves in hatred to sound
doctrine, that they said, “He! these Prophets do nothing but terrify us
by threatenings and by denouncing ruin on us; and what will be the end
of all this?” God says, that he would take punishment on all who thus
spoke and on all their families. It hence appears how much he abominated
this blasphemy; and hence also we see how precious to God is the honor
of his word; for it is not of every kind of sin that God speaks when he
extends his vengeance to posterity. It is the same thing as though
Jeremiah had said, “It is altogether intolerable, when men became
irritated and exasperated against God’s word.” And yet this evil is not
an evil of one age only. We see that the Israelites ever complained of
God’s rigor; hence that saying,

<span id="vi.xxxvi-p7"></span>“The ways of the Lord are not tortuous,
but rather your ways, O house of Israel.”  
(<span id="vi.xxxvi-p7.2"></span>[Eze
18:25](../../../bib/kjv/eze018.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.xxxvi-p7.2"></span>.)

<span id="vi.xxxvi-p8"></span>And here we must notice the wickedness of
the human mind; for God, as it has been before stated, has nothing else
in view by calling us to himself, but to make us partakers of eternal
life and salvation. It is then God’s design to receive us for the
purpose or saving us; this is the end intended by, all the prophets; and
hence the Prophet called before the word of God wheat; but what is done
by men? They despise this favor; and not only so, but turn food into
poison and cease not to provoke God’s wrath. He was, therefore,
constrained to threaten them. When he finds us teachable, he allures us
to himself even with paternal kindness. But when we provoke him to
wrath, we in a manner force him to put on another character, according
to what he says, that he will be refractory towards the refractory.
(<span id="vi.xxxvi-p8.1"></span>[Ps
18:26](../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#026.md)<span
id="vi.xxxvi-p8.1"></span>.) Yet we complain when God deals rigidly with
us. We cease not to carry on war with him; but when he restrains and
checks our insolence, we immediately expostulate with him, as though he
were too severe and his word offended us. Whence is this offense? even
from our obstinate wickedness. Were men to put an end to their sinful
course, the Lord would change his manner of dealing with them, and
gently treat them and foster them as chickens under his wings; but this
they suffer not; nay, they reject such a treatment as much as they can.
Hence it is, that they abhor the name of God and his word. What then is
the excuse for the complaint, when they say that God is too rigorous, as
though his word were a burden? There is none; for they are themselves
refractory against God, and thus his word becomes a hammer to break
their heads, to shatter and destroy them. We now see the reason why God
not only declares that he was angry with these ungodly despisers of his
word, but also denounces the same vengeance on their posterity.  <span

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p5"></span><span id="vi.xxxvii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p6"></span>Here the Prophet explains himself more
clearly; he shews why God would not have his word to be called a burden.
Why so? because they in a manner closed the way, so that they derived no
benefit from God’s word, while they regarded it with disdain and hatred;
for the word burden was an obstacle, so that they gave no access to God,
nor opened their ears to hear his word. God then bids them to come with
empty and sincere hearts; for it is a real preparation for a teachable
spirit, when we acknowledge that we ought to believe in God’s word, and
also when we are not possessed by a perverse feeling which forms a
prejudice and in a manner holds us bound, so that we are not free to
form a right judgment.

<span id="vi.xxxvii-p7"></span>The import of the passage then is this,
that the Jews, renouncing their blasphemies, were to prepare themselves
reverently to hear God’s word, for hearing is due to God; and then that
this word was to be heard with sincere hearts, so that no weariness, nor
pride, nor hatred, nor any depraved feeling, might hinder his word from
being believed and reverently heard by all. This then is what the
Prophet means when he says, “Ye shall hereafter change your impious
expression, and shall *say, What has Jehovah answered? what has Jehovah
spoken?”* That is, they shall not themselves close the door, but
willingly come to the school of God, being meek and teachable, so that
nothing would hinder them from rendering honor to God and from embracing
his word, that they might be terrified by his threatenings, and that
being allured by his promises they might devote themselves wholly to
him.

<span id="vi.xxxviii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as nothing is

grant, that as thou hast favored us with so singular a benefit, which
thou manifest to us daily, we may be attentive to hear thee and submit
ourselves to thee in true fear, meekness, and humility, so that we may
be prepared in the spirit of meekness to receive whatever proceeds from
thee, and that thus thy word may not only be precious to us, but also
sweet and delightful, until we shall enjoy the perfection of that life,
which thine only-begotten Son has procured for us by his own blood. —

<span id="vi.xl-p2"></span>**36**. And the burden of the LORD shall ye
mention no more: for every man’s word shall be his burden; for ye have
perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God

<span id="vi.xl-p3"></span>**36**. Et oneris, Jehovae non recordabimini
amplius, quia onus erit cuique sermo ejus; et pervertistis sermones Dei
vivi, Jehovae exercituum, Dei nostri.

<span id="vi.xl-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xl-p5"></span><span id="vi.xl-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p6"></span>Jeremiah goes on with the same subject, that
every one ought calmly and meekly to hear God speaking, he said, as we
saw yesterday, that the prophets were to be asked as to what God had
spoken and what he had answered; he thereby intimated that there must be
docility, in order that God’s word may obtain credit, authority, and
favor among us. He again repeats, that the word burden could not be
endured by God; for, as we explained yesterday, this word was used
commonly by the Jews as expressive of hatred or disdain, being as they
were unwilling to receive sound doctrine.

<span id="vi.xl-p7"></span>In forbidding them to mention the word
*burden,* it was the same thing as though he had said, “Let not this
form of speaking be any longer in use among you.” He then adds, *For to
every one his word shall be his burden.* By these words he shews that
what is bitter in prophecies is as it were accidental; for God has
nothing else in view in addressing men, but to call them to salvation.
The word of God then in itself ought to be deemed sweet and delightful.
Whence then is this bitterness and hatred towards it? even from the
wickedness of men alone. As when a sick person, eating the most
wholesome food finds it turned into poison, the cause being in himself;
so it is with us, it is our own fault that the word of God becomes a
burden. It was, moreover, the Prophet’s design to shew that the Jews had
no reason to complain that prophecies were grievous to them, and always
announced some trouble; for God wishes to address men with lenity and
kindness, but he is forced by their wickedness to deal sharply with
them. The Prophet seems, however, to go still farther, as though he had
said, “Though prophecies should cease, yet every one shall be a prophet
to himself; for as they murmur against God, and cannot bear his
judgment, however silent God’s ministers may be, they will yet afford a
sufficient cause for condemnation, who dare thus to rise up against
God.”

<span id="vi.xl-p8"></span>We now see the design of the Prophet in
saying, *Ye shall no more mention the burden of Jehovah;* that is, “This
shameful proverb, which brands God’s word with disgrace, shall no more
be used by you; this wicked practice shall cease, *for else to every one
of you; his word shall be a burden;”* so the causal particle <span
id="vi.xl-p8.1"></span>יכ, *ki,* is to be rendered. But if another sense
be preferred, I feel no objection, that is, that they ought to have
considered the reason why God did not deal more mildly with them; which
was, because they were of a perverse disposition, and thus they refused
the paternal kindness which he was prepared to shew, provided they
received it.  <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md)

<span id="vi.xl-p12"></span>This passage is entitled to special notice,
for we see how the greater part cannot bear threatenings and terrors
when announced to them. Hence they entertain contempt and hatred towards
heavenly doctrine; and yet none consider why God so often threatens and
terrifies them in his word. For if men ceased to sin, God would cease to
contend with them; but when they continually provoke him, is he to be
silent? and further, are his prophets to suffer everything just to be
violated, and God himself to be despised? Let us then know that the
fault is in us when God seems to deal rigidly with us, for we do not
allow him to use such a paternal language as he always would, were it
not that we put a hinderance in the way.

<span id="vi.xl-p13"></span>The Prophet also adds, *For ye have
corrupted the words of the living God, of Jehovah of hosts our God* So
ought the words to be rendered. Here he justly accuses them, that they
perverted the words of God, and in two ways, because they constrained
God by their wickedness to speak otherwise than he wished, and also,
because they were preposterous interpreters of his dealings. For though
God may severely chastise us, yet it is our duty to receive his reproofs
with a meek spirit, as they are necessary for us; but when we murmur and
become refractory, we pervert the word of God. We hence see that the
word of God is not only perverted in one way, but when we furiously
oppose him, we prevent him to deal gently and kindly with us; and we do
the same when we submit not to his reproofs, but rage against him
whenever he summons us to judgment. And as their wantonness was in this
instance so great, the Prophet here sets up against them in express
terms the power of God.

<span id="vi.xl-p14"></span>He says first, that he is the *living God;*
and by this term he reminded them that the ungodly, who vomited thus
their blasphemies against him, would not go unpunished; “See,” he says,
“with whom ye have to do; for you contend with the living God; this
audacity will rebound on your own heads; ye then carry on a fatal war.”
He, secondly, adds, that he is *Jehovah of hosts;* by which expression
he again shews his power. And, thirdly, he says, that he is the *God* of
that people; as though he had said, that not only their impiety was
madness in daring to contend with God, but that it was also connected
with ingratitude; for God had adopted them as his people, and had
promised to be their God.

<span id="vi.xl-p15"></span>We now then see the design of the Prophet;
he first warned them not to entertain hatred in their hearts to
prophetic doctrine; secondly, he shewed that the whole fault was in
themselves, as they constrained God to deal severely with them; and
further, that they perverted the word of God, being false interpreters
of it, and closing the door against his kindness when he invited all the
pious and the teachable; and lastly, he exalts God’s power and commends
his goodness, that he might thus aggravate the sin of the people in
daring to carry on war with God himself, and in despising the favor
conferred on them. It follows, —

<span id="vi.xli"></span>

<span id="vi.xli-p1"></span><span id="vi.xli-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#037.md)<span id="vi.xli-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xli-p2"></span>**37**. Thus shalt thou say to the prophet,
What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken?

<span id="vi.xli-p3"></span>**37**. Sic dices Prophetae, Quid respondit
tibi Jehova? Et quid loquutus est tibi Jehova?

<span id="vi.xli-p4"></span> 

<span id="vi.xli-p5"></span><span id="vi.xli-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xli-p6"></span>He repeats what we noticed yesterday, and
almost in the same words. The meaning is, that if we desire to profit in
God’s school, we must beware lest our minds be preoccupied by any
corrupt feeling. For whence is it that God’s word is not savored by us,
or excites in us a bitter spirit? even because we are infected by some
sinful lust or passion which wholly corrupts our judgment. God then
would have us to come to him free from every vicious disposition, and to
be so teachable as to inquire only what he teaches, what he may answer
to us; for whosoever becomes thus disentangled and free, will doubtless
find the prophetic doctrine to be for his benefit. There is then but one
cause why God’s word does not profit us, but on the contrary is
injurious and fatal to us, and that is, because we seek not what God
speaks, that is, because we are not teachable, nor come to learn, but
either sloth, or contempt, or ingratitude, or perverseness, or something
of this kind, bears rule in us.

<span id="vi.xli-p7"></span>Now he says here, that the prophets ought to
be asked as *to what God speaks,* or as to *what he may answer*  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) In these words he exculpates God’s
faithful servants; for if a hearer is ready to obey, he will find from a
faithful teacher what may justly please and do him good. In short he
shews that there is nothing wrong in the prophets when their doctrine
does not please us, but that this happens because we do not regard what
Jeremiah here reminds us of, that we ought to hear God that we may
learn, and that we may obey his voice. It follows, —

<span id="vi.xlii"></span>

<span id="vi.xlii-p1"></span><span id="vi.xlii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:38-39](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#038.md)<span
id="vi.xlii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xlii-p2"></span>**38**. But since ye say, The burden of the
LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD, Because ye say this word, The
burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say,
The burden of the LORD;

<span id="vi.xlii-p3"></span>**38**. Quod si onus Jehovae dixeritis,
propterea sic dicit Jehovah, Ne dicatis hoc verbum *(hoc est,* ne
proferatis hunc sermonem) onus Jehovae; et misi ad vos *(sed debet

<span id="vi.xlii-p4"></span>**39**. Therefore, behold, I, even I, will
utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you
and your fathers, *and cast you* out of my presence:

<span id="vi.xlii-p5"></span>**39**. Propterea ecce ego et tollam vos
tollendo *(vel,* obliviscar vestri obliviscendo, *ut alii vertunt;
tertia est sententia,* obliviscar vestri, ut tollam, *vel,* ad

relinquam, *male,)* et urbem hanc, quam dedi vobis et patribus vestris,
a facie mea.

<span id="vi.xlii-p6"></span> 

<span id="vi.xlii-p7"></span><span id="vi.xlii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xlii-p8"></span>Here the Prophet confirms what he had said,
for God might have seemed to be too indignant, having been so grievously
offended at one short expression. The Jews had borrowed from the
prophets themselves, when they called prophecies burdens, as we have
already said, and as we find in many places. Now as the lubricity of
language is great, though the Jews might have done wrong as to one word,
it might yet have appeared an insufficient reason for the punishment
which God threatened to inflict. But the Prophet here shews that God was
justly angry with them, for he had sent to them, and often warned them
not to use this form of speaking, which was a manifest evidence of their
impiety. As then they had thus disregarded God and his warnings, was it
an excusable mistake? In short, Jeremiah shews that they had not erred
inconsiderately, as it often happens as to those who speak rashly and
thoughtlessly, but that this perverted way of speaking proceeded from
determined wickedness, from a wish to affix some mark of disgrace to
God’s word; and thus they acted in disdain towards God himself. This
then is the import of the words.

<span id="vi.xlii-p9"></span><span id="vi.xlii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xlii-p10"></span>*If ye shall say,* even when I warn you
not to speak in this manner; if then ye persevere in this obstinacy,
*Behold I,* etc.; God here declares that he would take vengeance. As to
this sentence, most interpreters derive the verb from <span
id="vi.xlii-p10.1"></span>השנ, *nushe,* making <span
id="vi.xlii-p10.2"></span>ה, *he,* the final letter; but I doubt the
correctness of this; yet if this explanation be adopted, we must still
hold that the Prophet alludes to the verb, to take away, which
immediately follows. But I am disposed to take another view, that God
would by *removing remove them.* It must be noticed that the word <span
id="vi.xlii-p10.3"></span>אשמ, *mesha,* which has often been mentioned,
comes from the same root; <span id="vi.xlii-p10.4"></span>אשמ, *mesha,*
a burden, is derived from <span id="vi.xlii-p10.5"></span>אשנ, *nusha,*
to remove or take away. As therefore this proverb was commonly used,
that prophetic doctrine ever brought some burden and trouble, God
answers, “I will take you away;” that is, “ye shall find by experience
how grievous and burdensome your wickedness is to me, it shall rebound
on your heads; ye have burdened and treated with indignity my word, and
I will treat you with indignity,” but in what manner? *I will take you
away even by taking you away.* If any one approves more of the sense of
forgetting, let him follow his own judgment; but that explanation
appears to me unmeaning, “I will forget you,” except <span
id="vi.xlii-p10.6"></span>אשנ, *nusha,* be taken in the second place as
signifying to take away. “I will forget you, that I may take you away.”
 <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md)

<span id="vi.xlii-p14"></span>He adds, *And I will pluck you up;* which
some render, “I will forsake you,” but they seem not to understand what
the Prophet intended; for he declares something more grievous and more
dreadful than before, when he says, *I will pluck you up;* and yet this
sense does not satisfy me. The verb <span id="vi.xlii-p14.1"></span>שטנ,
*nuthash,* means to extend, and metaphorically to cast far off; and
casting off or away seems to suit the passage best. God then would not
only remove or take away the Jews from their own place, but would also
cast them far off into distant countries. He thus denounces on them an
exile, by which they were to be driven as it were into another world.
For had they dwelt in the neighborhood, it would have been more
tolerable to them, but as they were to be driven away, as by a violent
storm to the farthest and remotest regions, it was much more grievous.

<span id="vi.xlii-p15"></span>He afterwards says, *And the city also
which I gave to you and to your fathers* The verbs, to cast away and to
pluck up, do not well suit stones; but as to the sense, it may rightly
be said that God would take away the city with its inhabitants, as
though they were driven away by the wind. And this was added designedly,
for the Jews relying on this promise, “This is my rest for ever, here
will I dwell,” thought it impossible that the sanctuary of God would
ever be destroyed. As then this vain confidence deceived them, that the
city which God had chosen as his habitation would stand always, the
Prophet expressly adds that the city itself would perish.

<span id="vi.xlii-p16"></span>And it is also added, that it was *given*
to them and their *fathers* He anticipates all objections, and shakes
off from the Jews the vain hope by which they were inebriated, even that
the city was given perpetually to them, and that God resided there to
defend them; “This donation,” he says, “will not keep you nor the city
itself from destruction.” He adds, *From my presence;* for it was
customary for them to pretend God’s name, when they sought to harden
their hearts against the threatenings of the prophets; but God here
answers them and says, *from my presence;* as though he had said, “In
vain do ye harbor the thought respecting the perpetuity of the city and
the Temple; for this depends on my will and good pleasure. As ye then
stand or fall as it seems right to me, I now declare that ye shall be
ejected and wholly removed from my presence.” It follows, —

<span id="vi.xliii"></span>

<span id="vi.xliii-p1"></span><span id="vi.xliii-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
23:40](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#040.md)<span id="vi.xliii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xliii-p2"></span>**40**. And I will bring an everlasting
reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

<span id="vi.xliii-p3"></span>**40**. Et ponam super vos opprobrium
aeternum, et *opprobria (est quidem aliud verbum,* dedecora) aeterna,
quod oblivioni non tradetur (*potest referri ad utrunque membrum: nam in

oblivioni non tradetur; *sed potest, quemadmodum dixi, hoc extendi ad
totum complexum.*

<span id="vi.xliii-p7"></span> 

<span id="vi.xliii-p8"></span><span id="vi.xliii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xliii-p9"></span>What is here contained is, that though the
Jews justly gloried for a time in being the peculiar people of God, yet
this would avail them nothing, as they had divested themselves of that
honor in which they had excelled, by the abnegation of true religion.
Here then the Prophet strips the Jews of that foolish boasting with
which they were inflated when they said that they were the people of
God, and threatens that God having taken away their glory would make
them lie under perpetual shame.

<span id="vi.xliii-p10"></span>We at the same time know, that such
threatenings are to be restricted as to time, they extend only to the
coming of Christ; for the Church of God could not have been doomed to
eternal reproach. But as to hypocrites, as there was no repentance, so
they never obtained pardon; but God delivered his own from eternal
reproach when Christ the Redeemer appeared; yet these words are to be
understood as rightly addressed to the ungodly despisers of God. Now
follows, —

<span id="fn_72"></span>[73](cc19005.htm#fr_72.md) <span
id="vi.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p12"></span> It is an exclamation in the Sept. and Syr.;
“Oh! the Pastors,” etc., but a denunciation in the Vulg. and the Targ.,
“Wo to the Pastors,” etc. The original may be rendered in either way;
the latter is the most suitable here. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[74](cc19005.htm#fr_73.md) <span
id="vi.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p13"></span> The word is singular in Hebrew, “pasture,”
or feeding. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_74"></span>[75](cc19005.htm#fr_74.md) <span
id="vi.i-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p21"></span> The meaning seems to be that they had caused
the flock to be scattered and driven away through their bad conduct,
because they did not take care of them, as the last verb means. The two
first verbs are indeed in Hiphil, and may be rendered causatively thus,
—

<span id="vi.i-p22"></span>Ye have caused my sheep to be scattered, And
have caused them to be driven away; And ye have not cared for them.

<span id="vi.i-p23"></span>The last verb is not in Hiphil, and states
the reason why the sheep had been dispersed. It means to oversee, to
take care of, to attend to. The dispersion was owing to the neglect of
the pastors in taking care of the sheep. The scattering or dispersion
was their exile; which God states in the third verse was his act as a
punishment for their wickedness, but the cause of dispersion was the
conduct of the pastors.

<span id="vi.i-p24"></span>We see here an instance of the order in which
ideas are often stated by the Prophets. Scattering, though mentioned
first, is the last act, the most ostensible; the driving out of the land
was the previous act, and the first in order, though the last stated,
was the neglect of the pastors in taking an oversight of them. It is to
begin with the effect and to go back to the cause. “You have caused them
to be scattered to all lands, you have made them to be driven out of
their own land, and you have neglected to take care of them.” These are
the three points of accusation, but stated in an inverted order. There
are constant instances of this kind of arrangement. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[76](cc19005.htm#fr_75.md) <span
id="vi.i-p31.1"></span>

<span id="vi.i-p32"></span> “To their own pasture,” is the Sept. and
Arab.; “to their own country,” the Vulg.; “to their own fold,” the Syr.;
“to their own places,” the Targ. The Hebrew is, “to their own folds;”
the word is plural, and means generally “habitations,” either for men,
or cattle, or beasts. As sheep are mentioned, “folds” no doubt is the
proper word. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[77](cc19005.htm#fr_76.md) <span
id="vi.iv-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vi.iv-p4"></span> This verb is omitted by the Sept. and Arab.,
and rendered, “no one of their number shall be sought,” by the Vulg.;
“nor wander,” by the Syr.; “nor be moved,” by the Targ. Our version has
followed that of Montanus, “neither shall they be lacking.” Venema and
Gataker render it, “nor shall they be missing;” and Blayney, “nor shall
they be visited,” that is, with judgment. But the verb is used in the
sense of being wanting or missing, see <span id="vi.iv-p4.1"></span>[Nu
31:49](../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#049.md)<span id="vi.iv-p4.1"></span>;
<span id="vi.iv-p4.2"></span>[1 Sam.
25:7](../../../bib/kjv/sa1025.htm#007.md), [1 Sam.
15:21](../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#021.md)<span id="vi.iv-p4.2"></span>;
and this is the meaning most suitable to this passage, —

<span id="vi.iv-p5"></span>And I will set over them pastors, And they
will feed them; And they shall fear no more, nor be terrified, Nor be
missing, saith Jehovah.

<span id="vi.iv-p6"></span>— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[78](cc19005.htm#fr_77.md) <span
id="vi.v-p14.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v-p15"></span> The Sept. and Arab. give, “a righteous
sun-rising — <span id="vi.v-p15.1"></span>ἀνατολὴν δίκαιαν;” the Vulg.,
“a righteous branch;” the Syr., “a ray of righteousness.” The Vulg. is
alone correct, as there can be no doubt as to the original words. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_78"></span>[79](cc19005.htm#fr_78.md) <span
id="vi.v-p22.1"></span>

<span id="vi.v-p23"></span> We cannot express the words in our language
without changing the terms as follows, “And a ruler shall rule,” or, “a
reigner shall reign.”

<span id="vi.v-p24"></span>Bochart says that this double use of the same
word, as a substantive and a verb, imports in Hebrew what is enhancive,
according to what Calvin says here. The king was to be a king indeed,
with full power and dignity, and with a large extent of empire.

<span id="vi.v-p25"></span>The Welsh will express the words literally, —
<span id="vi.v-p25.1"></span>A breniniaetha brenin.

<span id="vi.v-p26"></span>And so it is rendered in Greek, —

<span id="vi.v-p27"></span><span id="vi.v-p27.1"></span>Καὶ βασιλεύσει
βασιλεὺς

<span id="vi.v-p28"></span>— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[80](cc19005.htm#fr_79.md) <span
id="vi.v-p29.2"></span>

<span id="vi.v-p30"></span> The verb <span id="vi.v-p30.1"></span>לכש
first means to be wise or prudent, and in Hiphil, as here, to
understand, to act wisely or prudently; and secondly, as the natural
effect of wisdom, it means sometimes to prosper. But the first sense is
given to it here by all the Versions: “and shall understand,” is the
Septuagint; “and shall be wise,” the Vulgate; “and shall act prudently,”
the Syriac. Our version is the Targum, Blayney gives the same idea with
Calvin, “and shall act wisely;” which is no doubt the correct one. —
*Ed*

<span id="fn_81"></span>[82](cc19005.htm#fr_81.md) <span
id="vi.v-p49.2"></span>

<span id="vi.v-p50"></span> “This king,” says Venema, “is the true God,
the meritorious cause and pledge of our righteousness, and also the
efficient cause and exemplar of all holiness, piety, and virtue.” He
holds that Messiah alone is spoken of here, and blames Grotius for
applying the passage in the first place to Zerubbabel, and maintains
that what is said here cannot be applied to any but to the Messiah. He
mentions, as a proof of this, his name — “a righteous Branch;” his royal
dignity — “a king shall reign;” his title — “Jehovah our righteousness,”
his prosperity and the security of his kingdom. All these things comport
with the character of no one, but with that of our Lord Jesus Christ. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[83](cc19005.htm#fr_82.md) <span
id="vi.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p6"></span> These two verses are omitted here in the
Sept. and Arab., but are given at the end of the chapter. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[84](cc19005.htm#fr_83.md) <span
id="vi.viii-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p10"></span> It is a fact worthy of being observed,
that what God effected in the course of his providence was more
remarkable, and is represented as more astonishing, than what he did by
means of many and wonderful miracles: the secret working of his
providence on the minds of men is more wonderful and effects greater
things than his power when put forth to reverse the course of nature.
Though he performs no miracles now, yet he works in a way more wonderful
than if he did. We cannot but see this if we notice the course of events
with enlightened eyes. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[85](cc19005.htm#fr_84.md) <span
id="vi.viii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.viii-p12"></span> The verse begins with <span
id="vi.viii-p12.1"></span>ןכל, rendered “therefore,” or, “on this
account,” by the Vulg., the Syr., and by our own version; but, “after
this,” by Blayney, and “moreover,” by Gataker. It might be rendered
“surely,” or doubtless, as it is by Venema, —

<span id="vi.viii-p13"></span>Surely, behold the days are coming, saith
Jehovah, When they shall no more say, Jehovah lives, etc.

<span id="vi.viii-p14"></span>It is better to render the <span
id="vi.viii-p14.1"></span>ו, “when,” than “that,” as in our version. The
Sept. and Vulg, render it “and,” which gives no meaning in either
language. Calvin follows the Syr., and gives the sense, “in which.” —
*Ed*

<span id="fn_85"></span>[86](cc19005.htm#fr_85.md) <span
id="vi.ix-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ix-p8"></span> These words are connected with the former
verse in the Sept. where they seem to have no meaning. The Vulg. puts
them as a heading to what follows, and Blayney has done the same,
“concerning the prophets.” The Syr. connects them with the following
words, as Calvin does, and our version, and also the Arab. and Targ. The
most suitable rendering would be, —

<span id="vi.ix-p9"></span>For the prophets broken is my heart within
me.

<span id="vi.ix-p10"></span>The sentence is otherwise hardly complete.
It may be rendered “with regard to the prophets,” etc. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[87](cc19005.htm#fr_86.md) <span
id="vi.ix-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vi.ix-p11"></span> The idea of shaking or trembling is
commonly given here to the verb: “are shaken,” Sept.; “have trembled,”
Vulg., Syr., and Targ. The word “tremble” is the most suitable. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[88](cc19005.htm#fr_87.md) <span
id="vi.x-p11.2"></span>

<span id="vi.x-p12"></span> The early Versions and the Targum differ as
to this word: the Sept., the Syr., and the Arab. have “on account of
these,” that is, adulterers; the Vulg.,” on account of a curse,” that is
of God; the Targ., “on account of false swearing.” Blayney says, that
there is nothing here about swearing, and renders the words “because of
these:” but the 14th verse (<span id="vi.x-p12.1"></span>[Jer
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014)<span id="vi.x-p12.1"></span>.md)
decides the question, where we have “adultery” and “walking in lies,”
ascribed to the same persons, the prophets. That, <span
id="vi.x-p12.2"></span>הלא means sometimes “false swearing,” is evident
from <span id="vi.x-p12.3"></span>[Ho
4:2](../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#002.md)<span id="vi.x-p12.3"></span>; and
in <span id="vi.x-p12.4"></span>[Ho
10:4](../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#004.md)<span id="vi.x-p12.4"></span>, we
have the word “falsely” added to it. Their false swearing was their
unfaithfulness to God’s covenant, their apostasy in worshipping idols.
And the charge of being “adulterers” seems to refer to their spiritual
adultery — their idolatry, and not as Calvin and others think, to that
which is natural. Everything in the context favors this view; their
wickedness was found in God’s house, verse 11 (<span
id="vi.x-p12.5"></span>[Jer 23:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#011.md)<span
id="vi.x-p12.5"></span>); and a comparison is made between them and the
Samaritan prophets, verse 14 (<span id="vi.x-p12.6"></span>[Jer
23:14](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#014)<span id="vi.x-p12.6"></span>.md).
The construction of this verse leads us to the same conclusion: when two
<span id="vi.x-p12.7"></span>יכ occur in succession, as here, they may
be rendered as and so, —

<span id="vi.x-p13"></span>As the land has been filled with adulterers,
So for false swearing has the land mourned, Withered have the pastures
of the wilderness; And their course has become calamitous, And their
strength not firm, (that is, to run their course.)

<span id="vi.x-p14"></span>Houbigant and Horsley have re-arranged the
whole verse, and made several transpositions. Had these learned men for
a moment reflected how such delocations of words, as they suppose, could
have taken place, they would have, no doubt, restrained their innovating
propensities. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[89](cc19005.htm#fr_88.md) <span
id="vi.x-p17.1"></span>

<span id="vi.x-p18"></span> That the word means “course,” is evident
from <span id="vi.x-p18.1"></span>[Jer
8:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer008.htm#006.md)<span id="vi.x-p18.1"></span>,
where it can have no other meaning. So it is rendered by the Sept. and
the Vulg. Blayney gives it another meaning.

<span id="vi.x-p19"></span>Their will also hath been wickedness,  
And their might without right.

<span id="vi.x-p20"></span>He derives it from <span
id="vi.x-p20.1"></span>הצר, to choose, and not from <span
id="vi.x-p20.2"></span>ףיר, run: but the sense of the last line is
hardly discernible. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_89"></span>[90](cc19005.htm#fr_89.md) <span
id="vi.xi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xi-p8"></span> This verb is used three times in <span
id="vi.xi-p8.1"></span>[Jer. 3:1](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#001.md),
[2](../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#002.md)<span id="vi.xi-p8.1"></span>, and
9, and in every instance in the sense of defiling the land with
adultery, and in the two last verses, with spiritual adultery —
idolatry. It is rendered here passively by the Sept. and the Vulg.,
“have become defiled;” but it is most commonly used in a transitive
sense; and so Jun. and Trem. render it here, and consider it, the land,
as understood after it; and this is most consistent with the context, —

<span id="vi.xi-p9"></span>For both prophet and priest have defiled it:
Also in my house have I found Their wickedness, saith Jehovah.

<span id="vi.xi-p10"></span>The “house” of God is here put in contrast
with the land or the country; and in <span id="vi.xi-p10.1"></span>[Jer
23:15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#015.md)<span id="vi.xi-p10.1"></span>,
it is expressly said that from Jerusalem pollution had gone forth
throughout all the land. Idolatry is evidently what is meant throughout
this passage, from verse 9 to 15 (<span id="vi.xi-p10.2"></span>[Jer
23:9-15](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#009.md)<span
id="vi.xi-p10.2"></span>). Calvin as to this verb has followed the
Syriac version. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[91](cc19005.htm#fr_90.md) <span
id="vi.xiv-p6.2"></span>

<span id="vi.xiv-p7"></span> Such is the word literally; but there is
here an ellipsis, not uncommon in Hebrew; the word way is left out
before “lubricities” or slipperinesses. The word being plural, and a
reduplicate, expresses what is extreme — “most slippery,” or, wholly
slippery, —

<span id="vi.xiv-p8"></span>**12.** Therefore their way shall be to
them, As a way wholly slippery in thick darkness; They shall drive on
and fall in it; For I will bring on them an evil — The year of their
visitation, saith Jehovah.

<span id="vi.xiv-p9"></span>It is not darkness, but thick darkness is
what the word means; and it is connected with the previous words by the
Targ. and by all the versions, except the Syr.; which Blayney has thus
followed, —

<span id="vi.xiv-p10"></span>Into darkness shall they be thrust and
shall fall therein.

<span id="vi.xiv-p11"></span>But this spoils the whole force of the
passage: their way was to be altogether slippery, and also in thick
darkness; along which they would be hurried on, or slide, or drive on,
and the inevitable effect would be falling. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[92](cc19005.htm#fr_91.md) <span
id="vi.xv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xv-p11"></span> Rendered “iniquities” by the Sept.;
“fatuity” by the Vulg.; “falsehood” by the Syr.; and “impiety by the
Targ. Blayney has, “that which was disgusting.” The word, as here, is
found only in two other places, <span id="vi.xv-p11.1"></span>[Job
1:22](../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#022.md)<span id="vi.xv-p11.1"></span>;
<span id="vi.xv-p11.2"></span>[Job
24:12](../../../bib/kjv/job024.htm#012.md)<span id="vi.xv-p11.2"></span>.
It means, not what is “disgusting,” but what is crude, insipid,
untempered, and hence figuratively, what is unreasonable, absurd,
fatuitous, foolish. It is rendered “folly” in Job. The Vulg., which is
followed by Calvin, gives its best meaning here — “fatuity.” To prophesy
by Baal was the effect of infatuation: it was an absurd and fatuitous
thing. This was the character of the thing in itself; and the evil which
this fatuity produced was to lead the people astray. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[93](cc19005.htm#fr_92.md) <span
id="vi.xv-p11.3"></span>

<span id="vi.xv-p12"></span> Or “wickedness — <span
id="vi.xv-p12.1"></span>pravitatem,” rendered “horrible things” by the
Sept., and “folly” by the Syr. The Vulg. and the Targ. go altogether
astray. The word means properly horridness, hideousness, or a horrid
thing, and may be rendered enormity. The difference found in the Targ.
and the Versions, as to the word and the manner of rendering the words
which follow, seems to shew that the passage was not understood. I offer
the following version, —

<span id="vi.xv-p13"></span>**14.** But among the prophets of Jerusalem
Have I seen a horrid thing — The committing of adultery and walking in
falsehood; And they have strengthened the hand of the wicked, That they
might not turn, each from his wickedness: They are all of them become to
me like Sodom, And its inhabitants like those of Gomorrah.

<span id="vi.xv-p14"></span>The verb I render “the committing of
adultery,” is an infinitive without a preposition; it cannot be
otherwise rendered in our language, but in Welsh it can be rendered
literally, as an infinitive without a preposition, though commonly in
that language, as in Hebrew, the infinitive mood has a preposition
before it. The “horrid thing” was adultery, that is, idolatry, combined
with “walking in falsehood,” that is, with a false profession of
prophesying in God’s name, which is afterwards more distinctly
specified. Here was the difference between the prophets: those of
Samaria were idolaters, and consistently they prophesied in the name of
Baal; but the prophets of Jerusalem were not only idolaters, but added
to this sin the enormity of defending all they did by alleging that they
were the Lord’s prophets. This was the horrid thing. It is a great sin
to advocate error, but to do this in the name of the Lord, or by
perverting his word, is a horrid thing. The last line presents an
instance of that ellipsis mentioned in a Note on the 12th verse. The
word “inhabitants” is to be understood before Gomorrah. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[94](cc19005.htm#fr_93.md) <span
id="vi.xvi-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xvi-p8"></span> This is the Syr., but it is not the
meaning; it is properly rendered “pollution,” or defilement, by the
Sept., the Vulg., and Arab., but improperly flattery, by the Targ. The
verb from which it comes is commonly rendered to defile; see <span
id="vi.xvi-p8.1"></span>[Isa 24:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#005.md)<span
id="vi.xvi-p8.1"></span>; <span id="vi.xvi-p8.2"></span>[Mic
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/mic004.htm#011.md)<span id="vi.xvi-p8.2"></span>.
The “profaneness” of our version, and “the perverseness” of Blayney,
seem incorrect; the word is used in neither sense. The pollution here
was by idolatry — the adultery beforementioned. This pollution had
spread from Jerusalem through the whole land. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[95](cc19005.htm#fr_94.md) <span
id="vi.xvii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xvii-p9"></span> The Sept. gives this version, “for they
make a vain vision for themselves; from their heart they speak, and not
from the mouth of the Lord.” Though the sense is given, yet it is not a
correct version. The Vulg. and Syr. keep nearer to the original, and
render the first clause “and they deceive you.” The words literally are,
“Infatuating you are they.” The whole verse is as follows, —

<span id="vi.xvii-p10"></span>**16.** Thus saith Jehovah of hosts,
Hearken not to the words of the prophets, Who prophesy unto you;
Infatuating you are they; The vision of their own heart do they speak,
And not from the mouth of Jehovah.

<span id="vi.xvii-p11"></span>The “And” in the last line is supplied in
several copies, is given by the Sept. and the Syr. To render “from,” as
Blayney does, “after the mouth,” etc., is no improvement. To speak “from
the mouth of the Lord” is very striking. All the Versions retain the
preposition “from,” and the Targ. gives “word” for “mouth.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[96](cc19005.htm#fr_95.md) <span
id="vi.xviii-p9.3"></span>

<span id="vi.xviii-p10"></span> Some, as Venema and Blayney, think that
<span id="vi.xviii-p10.1"></span>םירמא belongs to the preceding verse;
but this would not consist with the Hebrew idiom, where a participle
often precedes a verb in the future tense, but never follows it; nor is
this countenanced by any of the Versions or the Targ. The words as they
stand are indeed unusual; the probability is that <span
id="vi.xviii-p10.2"></span>רומא should be <span
id="vi.xviii-p10.3"></span>ורמא, and all the Versions give it as such,
“they say.” Then it would be, “Saying they say;” which imports the
boldness and the confidence of the false prophets; that is, “They boldly
say.” — *Ed*

<span id="fn_96"></span>[97](cc19005.htm#fr_96.md) <span
id="vi.xviii-p10.4"></span>

<span id="vi.xviii-p11"></span> There is a difference in the early
versions as to this clause; it is connected in the Sept. and Arab. with
the preceding, “They say to those who reject the word of the Lord,”
etc., and Blayney has followed this arrangement. The Vulg., the Syr.,
and the Targ., take it as a separate clause, and render it as here. The
Hebrew no doubt admits of either constructions, but the Lord appears to
be the speaker, and therefore the latter construction ought to have the
preference, —

<span id="vi.xviii-p12"></span>**17.** They boldly say to those who
despise me, Spoken hath Jehovah, “Peace shall be to you;”

<span id="vi.xviii-p13"></span>And to every one who walks in the
resolutions of his own heart, They say, “Not come upon you shall evil.”
This rendering also corresponds more with what is said in <span
id="vi.xviii-p13.1"></span>[Jer
23:25](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#025.md)<span
id="vi.xviii-p13.1"></span>, that the prophets prophesied lies in God’s
name. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[98](cc19005.htm#fr_97.md) <span
id="vi.xviii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xviii-p17"></span> What seems to militate against this view
is the fact, that these false prophets themselves pretended to a divine
revelation; they announced their message as coming from God. Hence these
questions seem to deny their pretensions. He seems to say, “Who of you
have been in the council of Jehovah?” The tautology may be avoided
without having recourse to the emendations which Blayney proposes, —

<span id="vi.xviii-p18"></span>But who (of you) has stood in the secret
council of Jehovah? And saw and understood his business? Who has
listened to his word and heard it?

<span id="vi.xviii-p19"></span>We know that <span
id="vi.xviii-p19.1"></span>רבד means not only a word, but also a thing,
affair, business, matter, any thing represented or imagined. The verb to
“see,” which implies a vision, proves that it means the latter here.
Then in the last line it means a message, because it was what was
listened to and heard. But the verb <span
id="vi.xviii-p19.2"></span>עמש, in the first clause, comports with
seeing, and understanding is what it sometimes signifies; and in the
last clause it comports with listening, which is that of hearing. The
Prophet refers to a vision and to a message, or to an affair as set
before one admitted into the council chamber of his sovereign, (for this
is the representation,) and to a message given to him who is
commissioned to transact the business. It is not an unusual thing in
Scripture to use a word in two different senses in the same passage; but
the surrounding context is always sufficient to make the subject clear.
— *Ed*

<span id="fn_98"></span>[99](cc19005.htm#fr_98.md) <span
id="vi.xxi-p3.2"></span>

<span id="vi.xxi-p4"></span> “Storm,” or tempest, is the most suitable
here. The word <span id="vi.xxi-p4.1"></span>המח, after Jehovah, seems
to belong to it — “hot tempest;” the reference is to the burning winds
of the south. See <span id="vi.xxi-p4.2"></span>[Jer.
4:11](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#011.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/jer004.htm#012.md)<span id="vi.xxi-p4.2"></span>. The
verse may be thus rendered, —

<span id="vi.xxi-p5"></span>Behold the burning tempest of Jehovah! It
shall go forth, yea, a pregnant tempest; On the head of the wicked shall
it burst.

<span id="vi.xxi-p6"></span>The tempest or storm would be “burning,” and
also “pregnant,” or in travail, as the word means; and being as it were
in labor, it would “burst,” or literally bring forth on the head of the
wicked. The verb is not from <span id="vi.xxi-p6.1"></span>לחי, but from
<span id="vi.xxi-p6.2"></span>לוח, which means not only to be in labor
but also to bring forth. “It shall come,” is the Sept. and the Vulg.;
our version is the Targum. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_99"></span>[100](cc19005.htm#fr_99.md) <span
id="vi.xxii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxii-p14"></span> Literally, “at the posteriority of days,”
meaning, at a future time, without designating any particular period; it
is the same as “hereafter.” The words which follow can hardly be
rendered literally in our language — “ye shall discern it with
discernment.” What is the antecedent to “it,” which is, <span
id="vi.xxii-p14.1"></span>ה, a feminine gender? Venema says that it is
to be taken as a neuter; but if so, what does it refer to? It appears to
me that there is nothing in the passage to which it can be referred,
except to the “tempest,” which is feminine, in the former verse; they
would understand at a future time the meaning of that tempest, that it
was from the Lord as a punishment for their sins. This they did not
understand at the time. These two verses are found nearly in the same
words at the end of <span id="vi.xxii-p14.2"></span>[Jer
23:30](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#030.md)<span id="vi.xxii-p14.2"></span>:
The last word is omitted there, — “At the posteriority of days ye shall
discern it,” or understand it, or consider it.

<span id="vi.xxii-p15"></span>The Vulg. here is, “at the last days ye
shall understand his counsel;” the Sept., “at the last of days ye shall
understand it;” and the Targ., “at the end of days ye shall by
understanding understand this.”

<span id="fn_100"></span>[101](cc19005.htm#fr_100.md) <span
id="vi.xxiii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiii-p9"></span> The order here is according to the usual
style of the prophets; the most visible act is mentioned first — the
prophets ran without being sent; then the previous act is referred to, —
God never spoke to them, and yet they prophesied. They ran as though God
had communicated something to them; but God neither spoke to them nor
sent them. They had neither a mission nor a message from God. In the
following verse, consistently still with the style of Scripture, the
order is reversed. The message is first referred to, and then the
mission. They had no message, because they never “stood” or were present
in God’s council; and then they did not go forth for the purpose of
turning the people from their evil way. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[102](cc19005.htm#fr_101.md) <span
id="vi.xxiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiv-p12"></span> In the Sept. there is no corresponding
clause to the “if” at the beginning of the verse. The Vulg. and the
Targ., as in our version, make the “turning” to be such a clause, but
strangely render it in the first person singular, “then would I have
turned them,” etc. The rendering of Calvin, is the most suitable, only
the <span id="vi.xxiv-p12.1"></span>ו after <span
id="vi.xxiv-p12.2"></span>םא, might better be rendered “then” than
“surely,” —

<span id="vi.xxiv-p13"></span>But if they had stood in my council, Then
would they have caused my people to hear my words, And turned them from
their wicked way, And from the wickedness of their doings.

<span id="vi.xxiv-p14"></span>Blayney renders the verse in the same way,
making the corresponding clause to begin at the second line. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[103](cc19005.htm#fr_102.md) <span
id="vi.xxiv-p18.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxiv-p19"></span> Their “evil way” was their idolatry, and
“the wickedness of their doings” was their injustice and immoral
conduct. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[104](cc19005.htm#fr_103.md) <span
id="vi.xxvii-p2.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxvii-p3"></span> “Am I not a God here upon earth, that
seems farther from me, as well as in heaven, that seemeth nearer to me,
as being the place of my special residence? do you think that because my
palace is in heaven I take no notice of what is done upon earth?” —
*Gataker*. This appears to be the meaning; for he says afterwards, “Do
not I fill heaven and earth?”

<span id="vi.xxvii-p4"></span>The words seem literally to be, —

<span id="vi.xxvii-p5"></span>**21.** Am I a God of nearness, saith
Jehovah? And not a God of distance?

<span id="vi.xxvii-p6"></span>— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_104"></span>[105](cc19005.htm#fr_104.md) <span

<span id="vi.xxvii-p10"></span> “The Scripture,” says Venema, “often

inferred from their doings.” — *Ed*.

id="vi.xxvii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxvii-p13"></span> The future here ought to be rendered
potentially, —

<span id="vi.xxvii-p14"></span>Can a man hide in hiding-places, That I
should not see him, saith Jehovah? Do not I fill the heavens and the
earth, saith Jehovah?

<span id="vi.xxvii-p15"></span> The first line may be thus rendered more
literally, —

<span id="vi.xxvii-p16"></span>Can a man secrete himself in secrecies?

<span id="vi.xxvii-p17"></span>In Welsh, —

<span id="vi.xxvii-p18"></span><span id="vi.xxvii-p18.1"></span>A lecha
dyn mewn llechveydd?

<span id="vi.xxvii-p19"></span>“The heavens,” and not “heaven,” ought to
be the word in the last line; and so does Blayney render it. The visible
and the invisible heaven are intended. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[107](cc19005.htm#fr_106.md) <span
id="vi.xxviii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxviii-p8"></span> The more literal rendering is as
follows, —

<span id="vi.xxviii-p9"></span>**25.** I have heard what the prophets
have said, Who have prophesied in my name falsely, saying. — “I have
dreamed, I have dreamed.”

<span id="vi.xxviii-p10"></span>— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[108](cc19005.htm#fr_107.md) <span
id="vi.xxix-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxix-p10"></span> Emendators have been very busy in
correcting the first words in this verse, without the authority of any
MSS., or of the early versions. When there is a meaning and a striking
one, emendations, merely conjectural, are surely to be repudiated.
Houbigant, Blayney, and Horsley, have their corrections, but we can do
without them. What seems to have prompted conjectural emendations has
been the <span id="vi.xxix-p10.1"></span>ה prefixed to <span
id="vi.xxix-p10.2"></span>שי; but Gataker removed this difficulty; his
version is substantially as follows, —

<span id="vi.xxix-p11"></span>How long! — Is it in the heart of these
prophets, To be prophesying falsehood, And prophesying the deceit of
their own hearts?

<span id="vi.xxix-p12"></span>To be “in the heart” is to be resolved, to
form a purpose or determination. See <span
id="vi.xxix-p12.1"></span>[Isa
63:4](../../../bib/kjv/isa063.htm#004.md)<span id="vi.xxix-p12.1"></span>.
It is the same, as though it was said, “Are these prophets resolved?” To
be “in the heart” means also to delight in a thing. See <span
id="vi.xxix-p12.2"></span>[Ps
40:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa040.htm#008.md)<span id="vi.xxix-p12.2"></span>.
The meaning then may be, “Is it the delight of these prophets?” etc. But
the first sense is the most suitable. “How long!” is an exclamation of
wonder at their perseverance in their wicked course. They had been often
warned, and yet they continued. Then follows a question, whether it was
their settled purpose to persevere in prophesying falsely? — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[109](cc19005.htm#fr_108.md) <span
id="vi.xxix-p16.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxix-p17"></span> Calvin begins this verse as our version,
“Who think,” etc. So the Sept.; the Vulg. is, “who seek (or wish),
volunt.” Blayney has, “who study.” The verb means sometimes to contrive
or to purpose a thing after counting the reasons for and against. It may
be rendered here, “who design.” The Syriac is, “whose counsel is.” It
was their design and intended object to make the people to forget God’s
name through their dreams. But how to forget his name? for they
professed to announce their dreams in his name. God’s name here
evidently means his revealed name, himself as revealed in his word. —
*Ed*

<span id="fn_109"></span>[110](cc19005.htm#fr_109.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p8"></span> All the early versions and the Targ. render
the last verb in the imperative mood, “Let him speak,” etc. And so most
of modern expounders. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_110"></span>[111](cc19005.htm#fr_110.md) <span
id="vi.xxx-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxx-p11"></span> The difference between the chaff and the
wheat is what the Sept. and Vulg. intimate, “What is the chaff to the
wheat?” But the Syr. has another idea, “Why mingle ye the chaff with the
wheat?” The literal rendering of the Hebrew is, “Why to the chaff the
wheat?” The mixture is what seems to be intended. So thought Gataker and
Blayney, who rendered it, “What has the chaff to do with the wheat?”
that is, why do you mix them together? And so does Adam Clarke view the
phrase. Venema, Henry, Scott, and Lowth take the first meaning, which is
also that of our version; but the other is more agreeable to the
original. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_111"></span>[112](cc19005.htm#fr_111.md) <span
id="vi.xxxiii-p6.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p7"></span> The particle <span
id="vi.xxxiii-p7.1"></span>הכ at the beginning of this verse, rendered
<span id="vi.xxxiii-p7.2"></span>ut by Calvin, seems to be without
meaning. It is omitted by the Vulg., and rendered “behold” by the Sept.
and Syr., as though it was <span id="vi.xxxiii-p7.3"></span>הנח. Venema
regarded it either as a noun, burning, from <span
id="vi.xxxiii-p7.4"></span>הוכ, to burn, or a misprint for <span
id="vi.xxxiii-p7.5"></span>חכ, strength, vigor, power. The last is
adopted by Blayney, and approved by Horsley, and is countenanced by the
Targ., “Are not all my words strong as fire?” Blayney’s version is, —

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p8"></span>Is not the power of my word like fire?

<span id="vi.xxxiii-p9"></span>This is the most probable meaning; though
there is no different reading, yet the difference between the two
letters is very small. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[113](cc19005.htm#fr_112.md) <span
id="vi.xxxiv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p12"></span> Various have been the expositions of
this sentence: they adopted the manner of the true prophets, as some
say, and used their words, an instance of which is found in <span
id="vi.xxxiv-p12.1"></span>[Jer
28:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/jer028.htm#001.md)<span
id="vi.xxxiv-p12.1"></span>; and this is the view of Scott; others hold
that the imitation in saying, “Thus saith the Lord,” is what is referred
to. It has also been suggested that they are intended — who, knowing the
truth, withheld it from the people; and that to withhold what they knew,
is represented here as stealing. But none of these views sufficiently
account for the words here used, “who steal my words every one from his
neighbor.” They were God’s words committed to the people, and these
prophets stole them, that is, by rendering them void by their falsehoods
and vain dreams, as Satan is said to steal the seed sown in the heart of
the way-side hearer. This is the view taken by Grotius, Venema, and
Gataker. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[114](cc19005.htm#fr_113.md) <span
id="vi.xxxiv-p15.3"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p16"></span> There are those who, with Houbigant,
suppose a transposition in the word, the <span
id="vi.xxxiv-p16.1"></span>ח being put last instead of being first; and
then it would mean to render smooth. But this does not suit the passage.
The probable idea is what is given paraphrastically by the Sept., “who
send forth the prophecies of the tongue;” they derived their prophecies
from their own hearts and their own tongues, and said that they came
from God. They took or used their tongues only, and at the same time
professed to speak God’s words. Or we may consider the taking or using
the tongue as meaning only profession, as though it was said, “who
profess and say, ‘He saith.’”

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p17"></span>The Syr. is, “who pervert their own
tongues,” which means that they used them falsely; and the Targ., “who
prophesy according to the will of their own heart.” — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[115](cc19005.htm#fr_114.md) <span
id="vi.xxxiv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p21"></span> The word is rendered “errors,” by the
Sept.; “miracles,” by the Vulg.; “lasciviousness,” by the Syr.; and
“rashness,” by the Targ. It comes from a verb which means to swell, to
overflow. As a feminine noun it is only found here, and as a participial
noun in two places, <span id="vi.xxxiv-p21.1"></span>[Judg.
9:4](../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#004.md), [Zeph.
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004.md)<span id="vi.xxxiv-p21.1"></span>,
in which places it evidently means licentious persons; and I once
thought that as used here it means licentiousness; see Note on <span
id="vi.xxxiv-p21.3"></span>[Zep
3:4](../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#004.md)<span id="vi.xxxiv-p21.3"></span>,
in vol. 4 on the Minor Prophets: but I now think that the meaning most
suitable here is excess or overflowing in words — vaunting boasting. The
false prophets boasted that they were prophesying in God’s name; they
were telling lies, and boasting that they were sent by God. In this way
they succeeded in leading astray the people, Venema renders it “vain
boasting.”

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p22"></span>Behold, I am against those who prophesy
Lying dreams, saith Jehovah; And who declare them, that they may lead
astray My people by their lies and by their vauntings.

<span id="vi.xxxiv-p23"></span>Then follows a virtual denial of their
vauntings, for God had “not sent’ nor “commanded” them; and the
conclusion of the verse refers to their lies, for what they said would
“not profit” the people. Thus we see a perfect correspondence between
what is said in this and in the following verse, and the order is
according to the usual style of the Prophets, it being reversed in the
latter instance; their vauntings were false, because God did not send
them; and their lies were vain, for they would not profit the people. —
*Ed*.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[116](cc19005.htm#fr_115.md) <span
id="vi.xxxv-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxv-p11"></span> The latter part of the verse is rendered
by the Septuagint, “Ye are the assumption. (<span
id="vi.xxxv-p11.1"></span>λὢμμα,) I will dash you to pieces, saith the
Lord;” by the Vulgate, “Ye are the burden, I will surely cast you away,
saith the Lord;” by the Syriac, “This is the word of the Lord; I will
pluck you up, saith the Lord;” and by the Targum, “Such is the prophecy;
I will cast you away, saith the Lord.”

<span id="vi.xxxv-p12"></span>Blayney considers that these words <span
id="vi.xxxv-p12.1"></span>אשמ חמ-תא ought to be thus arranged <span
id="vi.xxxv-p12.2"></span>אשמה םתא, consistently with all the Versions
and the Targum; the letters are the same, only differently connected.
This, doubtless, is the right reading, though not found in any MS.; both
the Versions and the sense being in its favor. Then as to the verb, the
most suitable meaning here is to cast off, as Blayney renders it. The
verse then would read as follows, —

<span id="vi.xxxv-p13"></span>**33.** And when ask thee shall this
people, Or a prophet or a priest, saying, “What is the burden of
Jehovah?” Then say to them, “Ye are the burden;” And I will cast you
off; saith Jehovah.

<span id="vi.xxxv-p14"></span>It was a suitable answer to mockers, who
made, as it were, a sport of the true Prophets. — Ed.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[117](cc19005.htm#fr_116.md) <span
id="vi.xxxvi-p8.2"></span>

<span id="vi.xxxvi-p9"></span> The beginning of this verse will read
better in connection with the last, in apposition with “you” whom the
Lord threatened to cast off, —

<span id="vi.xxxvi-p10"></span>Then say to them, “Ye are the burden;”
And I will cast you off, saith Jehovah —

<span id="vi.xxxvi-p11"></span>**34.** Even the prophet and the priest
and the people: Who will say, “The burden of Jehovah,” Yea, I will
punish that man and his house.

<span id="vi.xxxvi-p12"></span>Notice here the change of order in the
words; in the preceding verse we find “the people and the prophet and
the priest;” but here, “the prophet and the priest and the people.”
Whoever he might be, whether a prophet or a priest or one of the
people,” that man was to be punished. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[118](cc19005.htm#fr_117.md) <span
id="vi.xl-p8.2"></span>

<span id="vi.xl-p9"></span> This sentence, as given by the Sept. and
Vulg., bears the meaning first mentioned by Calvin, but another, as
given by the Syr., “for the word, let it be to man his prophecy,” that
is, the Lord’s prophecy. The meaning of which seems to be, that the
burden, or prophecy, ought to be deemed by every man as the word of God,
or ought to be called his word; it was no longer to be called burden,
but God’s word. According to Calvin and many others, the meaning is,
“the word, or the phrase,” the burden of the Lord, “which ye use in
derision, shall really be a burden to you.” The <span
id="vi.xl-p9.1"></span>יכ in this case must be rendered else or
otherwise. But the following words do not well connect; and as
punishment in case of disregarding the injunction here given is
afterwards especially specified, to mention it here seems improper. I am
therefore inclined to regard the two last clauses as including reasons
for the prohibition; and I give this version,

<span id="vi.xl-p10"></span>**36.** And “the burden of Jehovah” ye shall
no more mention; For the burden, it is become to every one his word; And
ye have perverted the words of the living God, Of Jehovah of hosts, our
God.

<span id="vi.xl-p11"></span>The word burden was used by all, it had
become a common word; and by using it in derision, they turned the words
of the living God into contempt, instead of receiving them as his words
and obeying them. This was the process, they first ridiculed them, and
then despised and neglected them. Hence God prohibited the use of the
expression, “the burden of Jehovah.” The only objection to the rendering
above is, that <span id="vi.xl-p11.1"></span>היה, a future, is rendered
as a present, “it is become;” but this is what is often done. Besides,
<span id="vi.xl-p11.2"></span>יכ is sometimes conversive as well as the
<span id="vi.xl-p11.3"></span>ו. — *Ed*

<span id="fn_118"></span>[119](cc19005.htm#fr_118.md) <span
id="vi.xli-p7.1"></span>

<span id="vi.xli-p8"></span> “Thus shalt thou say to the Prophet,” that
is, every one of you. The singular is used, as is the case often,
instead of the plural. The Syr. indeed adopts the plural, “Thus shall ye
say,” etc. They are here directed how to address a Prophet. — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[120](cc19005.htm#fr_119.md) <span
id="vi.xlii-p10.7"></span>

<span id="vi.xlii-p11"></span> The variety in the Versions as to this
clause, and the different constructions given of it by expositors, seem
to intimate some derangement in the text, and the text itself as it now
exists, (and there are no different readings,) is not according to the
Hebrew idiom; for <span id="vi.xlii-p11.1"></span>יננה, “behold me,” is
commonly, if not uniformly, followed by a participle and then by a verb,
preceded by <span id="vi.xlii-p11.2"></span>ו conversive in the past
tense. See <span id="vi.xlii-p11.3"></span>[Jer
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#007.md)<span id="vi.xlii-p11.3"></span>;
<span id="vi.xlii-p11.4"></span>[Jer
10:18](../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#018.md)<span id="vi.xlii-p11.4"></span>;
<span id="vi.xlii-p11.5"></span>[Jer
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/jer016.htm#016.md)<span id="vi.xlii-p11.5"></span>.
This is not the case here. Besides, when a verb, and the same verb as a
gerund are put together, which is no uncommon thing, the gerund in
general, if not always, precedes the verb; not so here, if we take <span
id="vi.xlii-p11.6"></span>יתישנ, as most do, to be from <span
id="vi.xlii-p11.7"></span>אשנ. These anomalies are evident in the text
as it now stands. Suppose the misplacing of one word, and put <span
id="vi.xlii-p11.8"></span>אשנ after <span
id="vi.xlii-p11.9"></span>יננה, and the sentence will be perfectly
grammatical, and the version would be as follows, —

<span id="vi.xlii-p12"></span>Therefore, behold, I will carry off and
let you go; Yea, I will dismiss you and the city, Which I gave to you
and to your fathers, From my presence.

<span id="vi.xlii-p13"></span>Alluding to burden, he says that he would
carry them off as one carries a burden, and then let them go, or throw
them down: the verb <span id="vi.xlii-p13.1"></span>השנ means to loosen,
to disengage one’s self from a thing, to remit, to let go. Then <span
id="vi.xlii-p13.2"></span>שמנ has a similar meaning, to set loose, to
relax, to set free, to dismiss, to cast off; which intimates that he
would not suffer them to continue as it were in his presence. It is the
same verb as in <span id="vi.xlii-p13.3"></span>[Jer
23:33](../../../bib/kjv/jer023.htm#033.md)<span id="vi.xlii-p13.3"></span>
— *Ed*

<span id="fn_120"></span>[121](cc19005.htm#fr_120.md) <span
id="vi.xliii-p3.2"></span>

<span id="vi.xliii-p4"></span> It is singular in three MSS., and in all
the early Versions, and the Targum; and the verb which follows requires
it to be so, —

<span id="vi.xliii-p5"></span>**40.** And I will bring on you a
perpetual reproach, And a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.

<span id="vi.xliii-p6"></span>The word for “shame” is stronger than that
for “reproach,” as Parkhurst tells us; but shame is the feeling, and is
rendered sometimes confusion, and reproach is what is outwardly
disgraceful. The Sept. and Vulg. have reproach and disgrace, by which
the distinction is not marked. The reproach or disgrace was to be such
as to create such a shame as would never be forgotten. The outward
reproach is mentioned first, and then the shame that it would occasion.
