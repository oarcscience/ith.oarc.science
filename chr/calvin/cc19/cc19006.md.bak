<span id="vii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 24

<span id="vii.i"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p1"></span><span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
24:1-2](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#001.md)<span id="vii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p2"></span>**1**. The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two
baskets of figs *were* set before the temple of the LORD, after that
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son
of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the
carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.

<span id="vii.i-p3"></span>**1**. Videre me fecit (ostendit mihi
visionem) Jehova, et ecce duo calathi ficuum positi coram Templo
Jehovae, postquam transtulerat Nebuchadne-zer, rex Babylonis, Jechoniam,
filium Joakim, regem Jehudah, et principes Jehudah, et artificem et
inclusorem *(vel,* sculptorem)  <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md)
e Jerusalem, et ab-duxerat eos Babylonem:

<span id="vii.i-p7"></span>**2**. One basket *had* very good figs,
*even* like the figs *that are* first ripe: and the other basket *had*
very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.

<span id="vii.i-p8"></span>**2**. Calathus unus ficuum bonarum valde,
sicuti sunt ficus praecoces; et alter calathus ficuum malarum valde,
quae non comederentur propter malitiam *(hoc est,* adeo malae erant.)

<span id="vii.i-p9"></span> 

<span id="vii.i-p10"></span><span id="vii.i-p10.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p11"></span>The meaning of this vision is, that there
was no reason for the ungodly to flatter themselves if they continued in
their wickedness, though God did bear with them for a time. The King
Jeconiah had been then carried away into exile, together with the chief
men and artisans. The condition of the king and of the rest appeared
indeed much worse than that of the people who remained in the country,
for they still retained a hope that the royal dignity would again be
restored, and that the city would flourish again and enjoy abundance of
every blessing, though it was then nearly emptied; for everything
precious had become a prey to the conqueror; and we indeed know how
great was the avarice and rapacity of Nebuchadnezzar. The city then was
at that time almost empty, and desolate in comparison with its former
splendor. They however who remained might indeed have hoped for a better
state of things, but those who had gone into exile were become like dead
bodies. Hence miserable *Jeconiah,* who was banished and deprived of his
kingdom, was apparently undergoing a most grievous punishment, together
with his companions, who had been led away with him; and the Jews who
remained at Jerusalem no doubt flattered themselves, as though God had
dealt more kindly with them. Had they really repented, they would indeed
have given thanks to God for having spared them; but as they had abused
his forbearance, it was necessary to set before them what this chapter
contains, even that they foolishly reasoned when they concluded, that
God had been more propitious to them than to the rest.

<span id="vii.i-p12"></span>But this is shewn by a vision: the Prophet
saw two baskets or flaskets; and he saw them full of figs, and that
before the temple of God; but the figs in one were sweet and savory; and
the figs in the other were bitter, so that they could not be eaten. By
the sweet figs God intended to represent Jeconiah and the other exiles,
who had left their country: and he compares them to the ripe figs; for
ripe figs have a sweet taste, while the other figs are rejected on
account of their bitterness. In like manner, *Jeconiah* and the rest had
as it were been consumed; but there were figs still remaining; and he
says that the lot of those was better whom God had in due time punished,
than of the others who remained, as they were accumulating a heavier
judgment by their obstinacy. For since the time that Nebuchadnezzar had
spoiled the city and had taken from it everything valuable, those who
remained had not ceased to add sins to sins, so that there was a larger
portion of divine vengeance ready to fall on them.

<span id="vii.i-p13"></span>We now see the design of this vision. And he
says that the vision was presented to him by God; and to say this was
*very* necessary, that his doctrine might have more weight with the
people. God, indeed, often spoke without a vision; but we have elsewhere
stated what was the design of a vision; it was a sort of seal to what
was delivered; for in order that the Prophet might possess greater
authority, they not only spoke, but as it were sealed their doctrine, as
though God had graven on it, as it were by his finger, a certain mark.
But as this subject has been elsewhere largely handled, I shall now pass
it by.

<span id="vii.i-p14"></span>*Behold,* he says, *two baskets of figs set
before the temple.*  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) The place
ought to be noticed. It may have been that the Prophet was not allowed
to move a step from his own house; and the vision may have been
presented to him in the night, during thick darkness: but the temple
being mentioned, shews that a part of the people had not been taken away
without cause, and the other part left in the city; for it had proceeded
from God himself. For in the temple God manifested himself; and
therefore the prophets, when they wished to storm the hearts of the
ungodly, often said,

<span id="vii.i-p16"></span>“Go forth shall God from his temple.” (<span
id="vii.i-p16.1"></span>[Isa
26:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa026.htm#021.md)<span id="vii.i-p16.1"></span>;
<span id="vii.i-p16.2"></span>[Mic
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/mic001.htm#003)<span id="vii.i-p16.2"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.i-p17"></span>The temple then is to be taken here for the
tribunal of God. Hence, he says, that these two baskets were set in the
temple; as though he said, that the whole people stood at God’s
tribunal, and that those who had been already cast into exile had not
been carried away at the will of their enemies, but because God designed
to punish them.

<span id="vii.i-p18"></span>The time also is mentioned, *After Yeconiah
the son of Jehohoiakim had been carried away;* for had not this been
added, the vision would have been obscure, and no one at this day could
understand why God had set two baskets in the presence of Jeremiah. A
distinction then is made here between the exiles and those who dwelt in
their own country; and at the same time they were reduced to great
poverty, and the *city* was deprived of its splendor; there was hardly
any magnificence in the Temple, the royal palace was spoiled, and the
race of David only reigned by permission. But though the calamity of the
city and people was grievous, yet, as it has been said, the Jews who
remained in the city thought themselves in a manner happy in comparison
with their brethren, who were become as it were dead; for God had
ejected the king, and he was treated disdainfully as a captive, and the
condition of the others was still worse. This difference then between
the captives and those who remained in the land is what is here
represented.

<span id="vii.i-p19"></span><span id="vii.i-p19.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p20"></span>He now adds, that one *basket* had *very
good figs,* and that the other had *very bad figs.* If it be asked
whether Jeconiah was in himself approved by God, the answer is easy, —
that he was suffering punishment for his sins. Then the Prophet speaks
here comparatively, when he calls some good and others bad. We must also
notice, that he speaks not here of persons but of punishment; as though
he had said, “ye feel a dread when those exiles are mentioned, who have
been deprived of the inheritance promised them by God: this seems hard
to you; but this is moderate when ye consider what end awaits you.” He
then does not call Jeconiah and other captives good in themselves; but
he calls them good figs, because God had chastened them more gently than
he intended to chastise Zedekiah and the rest. Thus he calls the Jews
who remained bad figs, not only for this reason, because they were more
wicked, though this was in part the reason, but he had regard to the
punishment that was nigh at hand; for the severity of God was to be
greater towards those whom he had spared, and against whom he had not
immediately executed his vengeance. We now perceive the meaning of the
Prophet. The rest we shall defer to the next Lecture.

<span id="vii.ii"></span>

<span id="vii.ii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vii.ii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that since thou
delayest with so much forbearance the punishments which we have
deserved, and daily draw on ourselves, — O grant, that we may not
indulge ourselves, but carefully consider how often, and in how many
different ways we have provoked thy wrath against us, that we may thus
learn humbly to present ourselves to thee for pardon, and with true
repentance so implore thy mercy, that we may from the heart desire
wholly to submit ourselves to thee, that whether thou chastisest us, or,
according to thine infinite goodness, forgivest us, our condition may be
ever blessed, not by flattering ourselves in our torpitude, but by
finding thee to be our kind and bountiful Father, being reconciled to us
in thine only-begotten Son. — Amen.

<span id="vii.iii-p1"></span>Lecture Ninety-Second

<span id="vii.iv"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p1"></span><span id="vii.iv-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
24:3-5](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#003.md)<span id="vii.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p2"></span>**3.** Then said the LORD unto me, What
seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and
the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.

<span id="vii.iv-p3"></span>**3.** Et dixit Jehova ad me, Quid tu vides
Jeremiah? et dixi, Ficus, ficus bonas, bonas valde; et malas, malas
valde, quae non comedantur propter malitiam.

<span id="vii.iv-p4"></span>**4.** Again the word of the LORD came unto
me, saying,

<span id="vii.iv-p5"></span>**4.** Et fuit sermo Jehovae ad me, dicendo,

<span id="vii.iv-p6"></span>**5.** Thus saith the LORD, the God of
Israel, Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are
carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into
the land of the Chaldeans for *their* good.

<span id="vii.iv-p7"></span>**5.** Sic dicit Jehova, Deus Israel, Sicuti
ficus bonae istae, sic agnoscam captivitatem Jehudah, quem emisi ex hoc
loco in terram Chaldaeorum ad beneficentiam.

<span id="vii.iv-p8"></span> 

<span id="vii.iv-p9"></span><span id="vii.iv-p9.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p10"></span>In the last Lecture we began to explain the
meaning of the vision which the Prophet relates. We said that the
miserable exiles whose condition might have appeared to be the worst,
are yet compared to good figs, and that those who still remained in the
country are compared to bad and bitter figs. We have explained why God
shewed this vision to his servant Jeremiah, even because the captives
might have otherwise been driven to despair, especially through the
weariness of delay, for they saw that their brethren were still in
possession of the inheritance granted them by God, while they were
driven into a far country, and as it were disinherited, so that no one
could regard them as God’s people. As then despair might have
overwhelmed their minds, God designed to give them some comfort. On the
other hand, those who remained in the land not only exulted over the
miserable exiles, but also abused the forbearance of God, so that they
obstinately resisted all threatenings, and thus hardened themselves more
and more against God’s judgment, hence God declares what was remotest
from what was commonly thought, that they had a better lot who lived
captives in Babylon than those who remained quietly as it were in their
own nest.

<span id="vii.iv-p11"></span><span id="vii.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p12"></span>We have said that the badness of the figs
is not to be explained of guilt, but of punishment: and this is what
Jeremiah confirms, when he says, *As these good figs, so will I
acknowledge the captivity for good,* or for beneficence, <span
id="vii.iv-p12.1"></span>הבוט, *thube.* It is well known that captivity
means the persons led captive, it being a collective word. Then he says,

<span id="vii.iv-p13"></span>“I will acknowledge the captives of Judah,
whom I have driven from this people, so as to do them good again.”
 <span id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md)

<span id="vii.iv-p15"></span>As this doctrine was then incredible, God
calls the attention of the Jews to the final issue; as though he had
said, that they were mistaken who took only a present view of things,
and did not extend their thoughts to the hope of mercy. For they thus
reasoned, “It is better to remain in the country where God is
worshipped, where the Temple is and the altar, than to live among
heathen nations; it is better to have some liberty than to be under the
yoke of tyranny; it is better to retain even the name of being a
separate people than to be scattered here and there, so as not to be a
community at all.” Hence, according to their state at that time, they
thought their condition better: but God corrected this wrong judgment;
for they ought to have looked to the end, and what awaited the exiles
and captives as well as those whom the king of Babylon had for a time
spared. Though, indeed, it was the Prophet’s object to alleviate the
grief of those who had been led away into Chaldea, yet he had a special
regard to the people over whom he was appointed an instructor and
teacher. He was then at Jerusalem; and we know how perverse were those
whom he had to contend with, for none could have been more obstinate
than that people. As God had delayed his punishment, they supposed that
they had wholly escaped, especially as they had an uncle as a successor
to their captive king.

<span id="vii.iv-p16"></span>Hence, then, was their contempt of
threatenings; hence was their greater liberty in sinning: they thought
that God had taken vengeance on the exiles, and that they were saved as
being the more excellent portion of the community. The Prophet,
therefore, in order to break down this presumption, which he could not
bend, set before them this vision, which had been given him from above.
We now, then, see that the doctrine especially set forth is, that God
would remember the captives for the purpose of doing them good, as
though he had said that a wrong judgment was formed of the calamity of a
few years, and that the end was to be looked to. It follows —

<span id="vii.v"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p1"></span><span id="vii.v-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
24:6](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006.md)<span id="vii.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p2"></span>**6.** For I will set mine eyes upon them for
good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them,
and not pull *them* down; and I will plant them, and not pluck *them*
up.

<span id="vii.v-p3"></span>**6.** Et ponam (*vel,* adjiciam) oculum meum
super eos in beneficentiam, et reducam eos ad terram hanc, et aedificabo
eos et non diruam, et plantabo eos et non evellam.

<span id="vii.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.v-p5"></span><span id="vii.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.v-p6"></span>He confirms what he said in the last verse,
but in other words, for it was difficult to persuade them that they were
happier who were apparently lost, than those who still enjoyed some
measure of safety. He had said that he would *acknowledge* them; but he
now adds, *I will set my eye upon them* He uses a metaphor which often
occurs in Scripture, for God is said to turn away his face when he hides
his favor; and in the same sense he is said to forget, to depart, not to
care, to despise, to cast away. Then, as God might have seemed to have
no more any care for this people, he says, “I will set my eyes on them.”
But he goes even farther, for he refers to the sentence announced in the
last verse — he had said that he was the author of their exile, “I have
cast them into the land of the Chaldeans” but he now confirms the same
thing, though in other words, when he says, “Mine eyes will I set on
them *for good.”* For God is said to visit men, not only when he
manifests his favor towards them, but also when he chastises them and
punishes them for their sins. He had then set his eyes on them to
execute punishment; he says now that he would act differently, that he
would kindly treat the miserable.

<span id="vii.v-p7"></span>He afterwards says, *I will restore them*
For, as he had sent them away, it was in his power to restore them. As,
then, he could heal the wound inflicted by his own hand, this promise
ought to have been sufficient to dispel every doubt from the minds of
the captives as to their return; and further, the Jews, who as yet
remained in Jerusalem and in the land of Judah, ought to have known that
they in vain boasted in their good lot, as though God treated them
better than their captive brethren, for it was in his power to restore
those whom he had banished.

<span id="vii.v-p8"></span>And he adds, *I will build and not pull them
down, I will plant and not pluck them up* This mode of speaking would
not be so significant either in Latin or in Greek; but such a
repetition, as it is well known, often occurs in Hebrew. But whenever a
negative is added to an affirmative, such form of expression is to be
thus interpreted, “I shall be so far from plucking them up, that I will
plant them; I shall be so far from pulling them down, that I will build
them up;” or, “since I had pulled them down, I will now build them up;
since I had plucked them up, I will now plant them:” or a perpetuity may
be meant, as though God had said, “I will plant them, so as not to pluck
them again; I will build them, so as not to pull them down again.” But
the most frequent import of such expressions is what I first mentioned,
“I will not pull them down, but on the contrary build them up; I will
not pluck them up, but on the contrary plant them.”

<span id="vii.v-p9"></span>The meaning of the whole is, that however sad
might be the calamities of the people in Chaldea, they being as exiles
reduced to a desolate condition, yet God could collect them again, like
one who plants a tree or builds a house. The metaphor of building is
common in Scripture, and also that of planting. God is said to plant
men, when he introduces a certain order among them, or when he allots to
them a certain place to dwell in, or when he grants them peace and
quietness. God is said in <span id="vii.v-p9.1"></span>[Ps
44:2](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.v-p9.1"></span>, to
have planted his people; but I will not refer to the many passages which
are everywhere to be met with. God often says that he had planted his
vineyard. (<span id="vii.v-p9.2"></span>[Isa
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.v-p9.2"></span>,
etc.) And then well known is this passage,

<span id="vii.v-p10"></span>“The branch of the Lord, and the planting
for his glory.”  
(<span id="vii.v-p10.2"></span>[Isa
60:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021)<span id="vii.v-p10.2"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.v-p11"></span>This is said of the preservation of the
Church.

<span id="vii.v-p12"></span>The meaning then is, that though God
severely chastised the exiles who had been led into Chaldea, yet their
condition was not to be estimated by one day, or a month, or a few
years, but that a happy end was to be expected. And as God intended at
length to shew himself reconcilable and propitious, it follows that the
calamity which had happened to them was lighter than that which awaited
the rest, who resolutely despised God and his prophets, and thus
increased the vengeance which had been already denounced on them. It
follows, —

<span id="vii.vi"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p1"></span><span id="vii.vi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
24:7](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#007.md)<span id="vii.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p2"></span>**7.** And I will give them an heart to know
me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their
God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.

<span id="vii.vi-p3"></span>**7.** Et dabo illis cor ad cognoscendum me,
quod ego sum Jehova; et erunt mihi in populum, et ego ero ipsis in Deum,
quia revertentur ad me in toto corde suo.

<span id="vii.vi-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.vi-p5"></span><span id="vii.vi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.vi-p6"></span>Here is added the main benefit, that God
would not only restore the captives, that they might dwell in the land
of promise, but would also change them inwardly; for except God gives us
a conviction as to our own sins, and then leads us by his Spirit to
*repentance,* whatever benefit he may bestow on us, they will only
conduce to our greater ruin. The Prophet has hitherto spoken of the
alleviation of punishment, as though he had said, “God will stretch
forth his hand to restore his people to their own country.” Then the
remission of punishment is what has been hitherto promised; but now the
Prophet speaks of a much more excellent favor, that God would not only
mitigate punishment, but that he would also inwardly change and reform
their hearts, so that they would not only return to their own country,
but would also become a true Church, a name of which they had vainly
boasted. For though they had been chosen to be a peculiar people, yet,
as they had departed from true religion, they were only a Church in
name. But now God promises that he would bring them, not only to enjoy
temporal and fading blessings, but also eternal salvation, for they
would truly fear and serve him.

<span id="vii.vi-p7"></span>And this is what we ought carefully to
observe, for the more bountiful God is towards men, the more is his
vengeance kindled by ingratitude. What, then, would it avail us to
abound in all good things, except we had evidences of God’s paternal
favor towards us? But when we regard this end, that God testifies to us
that he is our Father by his bounty towards us, we then make a right use
of all his blessings; and God’s benefits cannot conduce to our salvation
except we regard them in this light. Hence Jeremiah, after having spoken
of the people’s restoration, justly exalts this favor above everything
else, that the people would repent, so that they would not only fully
partake of all the blessings they could expect, but would also worship
God in sincerity and truth.

<span id="vii.vi-p8"></span>Now, God says that he would give *them a
heart to know him* The word heart is to be taken here for the mind or
understanding, as it means often in Hebrew. It, indeed, means frequently
the seat of the affections, and also the soul of man, as including
reason or understanding and will. But though the heart is taken often
for the seat of the affections, it is yet applied to designate the other
part of the soul, according to these words,

<span id="vii.vi-p9"></span>“Hitherto God has not given thee a heart to
understand.” (<span id="vii.vi-p9.1"></span>[De
29:4](../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#004)<span id="vii.vi-p9.1"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.vi-p10"></span>The Latins sometimes take it in this sense,
according to what Cicero shews when he quotes these words of Ennius,
“Catus AElius Sextus was a man remarkable in understanding.” *(Egregie
cordatus*; Cic. 1 Tuscul.) Then, in this passage, the word heart is put
for the light of the understanding. Yet another thing must be stated,
that a true knowledge of God is not, as they say, imaginary, but is ever
connected with a right feeling.

<span id="vii.vi-p11"></span>From the words of the Prophet we learn that
repentance is the peculiar gift of God. Had Jeremiah said only that they
who had been previously driven by madness into ruin, would return to a
sane mind, he might have appeared as one setting up free-will and
putting conversion in the power of man himself, according to what the
Papists hold, who dream that we can turn to either side, to good as well
as to evil; and thus they imagine that we can, after having forsaken
God, of ourselves turn to him. But the Prophet clearly shews here, that
it is God’s peculiar gift; for what God claims for himself, he surely
does not take away from men, as though he intended to deprive them of
any right which may belong to them, according to what the Pelagians
hold, who seem to think that God appears almost envious when he declares
that man’s conversion is in his power; but this is nothing less than a
diabolical madness. It is, then, enough for us to know, that what God
claims for himself is not taken away from men, for it is not in their
power.

<span id="vii.vi-p12"></span>Since, then, he affirms that he would
*give* them *a heart* to understand, we hence learn that men are by
nature blind, and also that when they are blinded by the devil, they
cannot return to the right way, and that they cannot be otherwise
capable of light than by having God to illuminate them by his Spirit. We
then see that man, from the time he fell, cannot rise again until God
stretches forth his hand not only to help him, (as the Papists say, for
they dare not claim to themselves the whole of repentance, but they
halve it between themselves and God,) but even to do the whole work from
the beginning to the end; for God is not called the helper in
repentance, but the author of it. God, then, does not say, “I will help
them, so that when they raise up their eyes to me, they shall be
immediately assisted;” no, he does not say this; but what he says is, “I
will give them a heart to understand.” And as understanding or knowledge
is the main thing in repentance, it follows that man remains wholly
under the power of the devil, and is, as it were, his slave, until God
draws him forth from his miserable bondage. In short, we must maintain,
that as soon as the devil draws us from the right way of salvation,
nothing can come to our minds but what sinks us more and more in ruin,
until God interposes, and thus restore us when thinking of no such
thing.

<span id="vii.vi-p13"></span>This passage also shews, that we cannot
really turn to God until we acknowledge him to be the Judge; for until
the sinner sets himself before God’s tribunal, he will never be touched
with the feeling of true repentance. Let us then know that the door of
repentance is then opened to us, when God constrains us to look to him.
At the same time there is more included in the term *Jehovah* than the
majesty of God, for he assumes this principle, which ought to have been
sufficiently known to the whole people, that he was the only true God
who had chosen for himself the seed of Abraham, who had published the
Law by Moses, who had made a covenant with the posterity of Abraham.
There is then no doubt but that the Prophet meant that when the Jews
became illuminated, they would be convinced of what they had forgotten,
that is, that they had departed from the only true God. This mode of
speaking then means the same as though he had said, “I will open their
eyes, that they may at length acknowledge that they are apostates, and
be thus humbled when made sensible how grievous was their impiety in
forsaking me the fountain of living waters.”

<span id="vii.vi-p14"></span>He afterwards adds, that they should be *to
him a people,* and that he in his turn would be *to them a God;* for
they would *return* to him *with the whole heart* By these words the
Prophet shews more clearly what he had before referred to, that God’s
blessings would be then altogether salutary when they regarded their
giver. As long then as we regard only the blessings of God, our
insensibility produces this effect, that the more bountiful he is
towards us, the more culpable we become. But when we regard God’s bounty
and paternal kindness towards us, we then really enjoy his blessings.
This is the meaning of the Prophet’s words when he says,

<span id="vii.vi-p15"></span>“I shall be to you a God, and ye shall be
to me a people.”

<span id="vii.vi-p16"></span>What this mode of speaking means has been
stated elsewhere.

<span id="vii.vi-p17"></span>Though God rules the whole world, he yet
declares that he is the God of the Church; and the faithful whom he has
adopted, he favors with this high distinction, that they are his people;
and he does this that they may be persuaded that there is safety in him,
according to what is said by Habakkuk,

<span id="vii.vi-p18"></span>“Thou art our God, we shall not die.”
(<span id="vii.vi-p18.1"></span>[Hab
1:12](../../../bib/kjv/hab001.htm#012)<span id="vii.vi-p18.1"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.vi-p19"></span>And of this sentence Christ himself is the
best interpreter, when he says, that he is not the God of the dead, but
of the living, (<span id="vii.vi-p19.1"></span>[Lu
20:38](../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#038)<span id="vii.vi-p19.1"></span>;.md)
he proves by the testimony of Moses, that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
though dead, were yet alive. How so; because God would not have declared
that he was their God, were they not living to him. Since then he
regards them as his people, he at the same time shews that there is life
for them laid up in him. In short, we see that there is here promised by
God not a restoration for a short time, but he adds the hope of eternal
life and salvation; for the Jews were not only to return to their own
country, when the time came to leave Chaldea, and a liberty granted them
to build their own city; but they were also to become the true Church of
God.

<span id="vii.vi-p20"></span>And the reason is also added, *Because they
will return to me,* he says, *with their whole heart* He repeats what we
have already observed, that they would be wise *(cordatos)* and
intelligent, whereas they had been for a long time stupid and foolish,
and the devil had so blinded them, that they were not capable of
receiving sound doctrine. But these two things, the reconciliation of
God with men and repentance, are necessarily connected together, yet
repentance ought not to be deemed as the cause of pardon or of
reconciliation, as many falsely think who imagine that men deserve
pardon because they repent. It is indeed true that God is never
propitious to us, except when we turn to him; but the connection, as it
has been already stated, is not such that repentance is the cause of
pardon, nay, this very passage clearly shews that repentance itself
depends on the grace and mercy of God. Since this is true, it follows
that men are anticipated by God’s gratuitous kindness.

<span id="vii.vi-p21"></span>We hence further learn, that God is not
otherwise propitious to us than according to his good pleasure, so that
the cause of all is only in himself. Whence is it that a sinner returns
to the right way and seeks God from whom he has departed? Is it because
he is moved to do so of himself? Nay, but because God illuminates his
mind and touches his heart, or rather renews it. How is it that God
illuminates him who has become blind? Surely for this we can find no
other cause than the gratuitous mercy of God. When God then is
propitious to men, so as to restore them to himself, does he not
anticipate them by his grace? How then can *repentance* be called the
cause of reconciliation, when it is its effect? It cannot be at the same
time its effect and cause.

<span id="vii.vi-p22"></span>We ought therefore carefully to notice the
context here, for though the Prophet says that the Jews, when they
returned, would be God’s people, because they would turn to him with
their whole heart, he yet had before explained whence this turning or
conversion would proceed, even because God would shew them mercy. They
who pervert such passages according to their own fancies, are not so
acquainted with Scripture as to know that there is a twofold
reconciliation of men with God: He is first reconciled to men in a
hidden manner, for when they despise him, he anticipates them by his
grace, and illuminates their minds and renews their hearts. This first
reconciliation is what they do not understand. But there is another
reconciliation, known by experience, even when we feel that the wrath of
God towards us is pacified, and are indeed made sensible of this by the
effects. To this the reference is made in these words,

<span id="vii.vi-p23"></span>“Turn ye to me, and I will turn to you,”
(<span id="vii.vi-p23.1"></span>[Zec
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/zac001.htm#003)<span id="vii.vi-p23.1"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.vi-p24"></span>that is, “I appear severe and rigid to you;
but whence is this? even because ye cease not to provoke my wrath;
return to me, and you shall find me ready to spare you.” God therefore
did not then first begin to pardon sinners, when he does them good, but
as he had been previously pacified, hence he turns them to himself, and
afterwards shews that he is really reconciled to them.

<span id="vii.vi-p25"></span>By the *whole heart,* is intimated
sincerity or integrity, as by a double heart, or a heart and a heart, is
signified dissimulation. It is certain that no one turns to God in such
a manner that he puts off all the affections of the flesh, that he is
renewed at once in God’s image, so that he is freed from every stain.
Such a conversion is never found in man. But when the Scripture speaks
of the whole heart, it is in contrast with dissimulation;

<span id="vii.vi-p26"></span>“with my whole heart have I sought thee,”
says David; “I have hid thy words and will keep them: I have prayed for
thy favor; I will ask,” etc., (<span id="vii.vi-p26.1"></span>[Ps
119:10-16](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#010.md)<span
id="vii.vi-p26.1"></span>;)

<span id="vii.vi-p27"></span>“They will seek me,” as Moses says, “with
their whole heart.”  
(<span id="vii.vi-p27.2"></span>[De
4:29](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#029.md)<span id="vii.vi-p27.2"></span>;
<span id="vii.vi-p27.3"></span>[De
10:12](../../../bib/kjv/deu010.htm#012)<span id="vii.vi-p27.3"></span>.md)

<span id="vii.vi-p28"></span>David did not divest himself of everything
sinful, for he confesses in many places that he was laboring under many
sins; but the clear meaning is, that what God requires is integrity. In
short, the whole heart is integrity, that is when we deal not
hypocritically with God, but desire from the heart to give up ourselves
to him.

<span id="vii.vi-p29"></span>As we have before refuted the error of
those who think that repentance is the cause why God becomes reconciled
to us, so now we must know that God will not be propitious to us except
we seek him. For there is a mutual bond of connection, so that God
anticipates us by his grace, and also calls us to himself; in short, he
draws us, and we feel in ourselves the working of the Holy Spirit. We do
not indeed turn, unless we are turned; we do not turn through our own
will or efforts, but it is the Holy Spirit’s work. Yet he who under
pretext of grace indulges himself and cares not for God, and seeks not
repentance, cannot flatter himself that he is one of God’s people; for
as we have said, repentance is necessary. It follows, — but I cannot
to-day finish this part, for he speaks of the badness of the figs, and
of the remnant which still remained.

<span id="vii.vii"></span>

<span id="vii.vii-p1"></span>PRAYER

<span id="vii.vii-p2"></span>Grant, Almighty God, that as we are placed
in this world, that while daily receiving so many blessings, we may so
pass our time as to regard our end and hasten towards the goal, — O
grant, that the benefits and blessings by which thou invitest us to
thyself, may not be impediments to us, and keep us attached to this
world, but on the contrary stimulate us to fear thy name as well as to
appreciate thy mercy, so that we may thus know thee to be our God, and
strive on our part to present ourselves to thee as thy people, and so
consecrate ourselves and all our services to thee, that thy name may be
glorified in us, through Christ our Lord. — Amen.

<span id="vii.ix-p1"></span><span id="vii.ix-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
24:8](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#008.md)<span id="vii.ix-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ix-p2"></span>**8.** And as the evil figs, which cannot be
eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give
Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of
Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of
Egypt:

<span id="vii.ix-p3"></span>**8.** Et sicut ficus malae, quae non
comeduntur prae malitia (*id est,* amaritudine,) sic certe (*est* <span
id="vii.ix-p3.1"></span>יכ, *sed abundat,* certe sic,) dicit Jehova, ita
ponam Zedekiam, regem jehudah, et principesejus, et reliquias Jerusalem,
quae residuae sunt in terra hac, et eos qui habitant in terra AEgypti.

<span id="vii.ix-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.ix-p5"></span><span id="vii.ix-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ix-p6"></span>God, after having promised to deal kindly
with the captives, now declares that he would execute heavier punishment
on King Zedekiah, and the whole people who yet remained in their own
country. We have stated why God exhibited this vision to the Prophet,
even that he might support their minds who saw nothing but grounds of
despair, and that also, on the other hand, he might correct their pride
who flattered themselves in their own lot, because God had deferred his
vengeance as to them. Then the Prophet, having given comfort to the
miserable exiles, now speaks against Zedekiah and his people, who
boasted that God was propitious to them, and that they had not only been
fortunate, but also wise in continuing in their own country.

<span id="vii.ix-p7"></span>He then says that *Zedekiah* and *his
princes,* and all who remained in Judea, were like the *bad figs,* which
could not be eaten on account of their bitterness. I have said that this
is to be referred to punishment and not to guilt. They had sinned, I
allow, most grievously; but we are to regard the design of the Prophet.
The meaning then is, that though the condition of those who had been
driven into captivity was for the present harder, yet God would deal
more severely with those who remained, because he had for a time spared
them, and they did not repent, but hardened themselves more and more in
their wickedness.

<span id="vii.ix-p8"></span>Now we know that Zedekiah was set over the
kingdom of Judah, when Jeconiah surrendered himself to Nebuchadnezzar:
he was the uncle of Jeconiah, and reigned eleven years; and during that
time he ought to have been at least wise at the expense of another. For
Eliakim, who was also called Jehoiakim, had been chastised, and that not
only once; but Nebuchadnezzar, after having spoiled the temple, rendered
him tributary to himself, on his return to Chaldea. At length, after
having been often deceived by him, he became extremely displeased with
him; and his son, who had reigned with his father, three months after
his death, voluntarily surrendered himself into the power and will of
the conqueror. Mathaniah afterwards reigned, of whom the Prophet speaks
here. So, he says, *will I render*  <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) *Zedekiah* (called previously
Mathaniah) *the king of Judah, and his princes, and the remnants of
Jerusalem, who remain in this land,* (for the greater part had been led
into exile,) *and those who dwell in the land of Egypt,* for many had
fled thither; and we know that they were confederates with the
Egyptians, and that through a vain confidence in them they often
rebelled.

<span id="vii.ix-p12"></span>And this was also the reason why the
prophets so sharply reproved them: they relied on the help of Egypt, and
took shelter under its protection. When, therefore, they found
themselves exposed to the will of their enemies, they fled into Egypt.
But Nebuchadnezzar afterwards, as we shall see, conquered Egypt also.
Thus it happened that they were only for a short time beyond the reach
of danger. But as fugitive slaves, when recovered, are afterwards
treated more severely by their masters, so also the rage of King
Nebuchadnezzar became more violent against them. It now follows —

<span id="vii.x"></span>

<span id="vii.x-p1"></span><span id="vii.x-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
24:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#009.md)<span id="vii.x-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.x-p2"></span>**9.** And I will deliver them to be removed
into all the kingdoms of the earth for *their* hurt, *to be* a reproach
and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive
them.

<span id="vii.x-p3"></span>**9.** Et ponam eos in commotionem (*vel,*
strepitum, *vel,* perturbationem, *alii* concussionem *vertunt*) in
malum omnibus regnis terrae, in probrum, et parabolam, et proverbium, et
execrationem in omnibus locis quo ejecero ipsos (*vel,* expulero.)

<span id="vii.x-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.x-p5"></span><span id="vii.x-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.x-p6"></span>Here the Prophet borrows his words from
Moses, in order to secure authority to his prophecy; for the Jews were
ashamed to reject Moses, as they believed that the Law came from God: it
would at least have been deemed by them an abominable thing to deny
credit to the Law. And yet they boldly rejected all the prophets, though
they were but faithful interpreters of the Law, as the case is with the
Papists of the present day, who, though they dare not deny but that the
Scripture contains celestial truth, yet furiously reject what is alleged
from it. Similar was the perverseness of the Jews. Hence the prophets,
in order to gain more credit to their words, often borrowed their very
words from Moses, as though they had recited from a written document
what had been dictated to them. For in Deuteronomy and in other places
Moses spoke a language of this kind, — that God would give up the people
to a concussion or a commotion, for a reproach, for a proverb, for a
taunt, to all the nations of the earth. (<span
id="vii.x-p6.1"></span>[De 28:37](../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#037.md)<span
id="vii.x-p6.1"></span>; <span id="vii.x-p6.2"></span>[1Ki
9:7](../../../bib/kjv/kg1009.htm#007)<span id="vii.x-p6.2"></span>..md)

<span id="vii.x-p7"></span>It is then the same as though Jeremiah had
said, that the time would at length come when the Jews would find that
so many maledictions had not been pronounced in vain by Moses. They no
doubt read Moses; but as they were so stupid, no fear, no reverence for
God was felt by them, even when he terrified them with such words as
these. The Prophet then says, that the time was now near when they
should know by experience that God had not in vain threatened them.

<span id="vii.x-p8"></span>*I will set them for a commotion* The verb
<span id="vii.x-p8.1"></span>עוז, *zuo,* means to move and to be noisy.
Many render the noun here “noise,” others “perturbation,” and others,
“the shaking of the head;” for we are wont to shake the head in scorn.
 <span id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md)

<span id="vii.x-p12"></span>However this may be, we are to read in
connection with this the following words, — that they would *be for a
reproach, and a terror, and a taunt, and an execration, to all nations*
It is then said, on *account of evil:* for the preposition <span
id="vii.x-p12.1"></span>ל*, lamed,* is to be taken here in different
senses: before “commotion,” it means “for;” but here it is causal, “on
account of.” The severe and dreadful vengeance of God would be such,
that it would move and disturb all nations. He indeed mentions *all
kingdoms,* but the meaning is the same. He then adds *reproach,* that
is, that they would be subjected to the condemnation of all nations.
They had refused to submit to God’s judgment, and when he would have
made them ashamed for their good, they had wickedly resisted. It was
therefore necessary to subject them to the reproach of all people.

<span id="vii.x-p13"></span>It is added, *for a proverb and for a tale,*
or as some read, “for a parable and for a proverb.” The word <span
id="vii.x-p13.1"></span>לשמ, *meshel,* means a common saying; but here
it signifies a scoff, and a similar meaning must be given to, <span
id="vii.x-p13.2"></span>הנינש, *shenine,* a tale or a fable. By both
words he means, that when the heathens wished to describe a most
grievous calamity, they would take this example, “Yes, it is all over
with the Jews, no nation has become so wretched.” The same view is to be
taken of *execration;* for he intimates that they would become a type
and a pattern of a curse, “Yes, may you perish like the Jews; may God
execute vengeance on you, as he has done on the Jews.” He then adds,
that this would happen to them *in all places wherever* God would
*drive* them; as though the Prophet had said, that God would not be
satisfied with their exile, though that was to be grievous and bitter;
but that when driven to distant lands they would become objects of
reproach, so that all would point at them with the finger of scorn,
accompanied with every mark of reproach, and would be also taking them
as an example of execration. He afterwards adds —

<span id="vii.xi"></span>

<span id="vii.xi-p1"></span><span id="vii.xi-p1.1"></span>[Jeremiah
24:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#010.md)<span id="vii.xi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xi-p2"></span>**10.** And I will send the sword, the
famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they be consumed from off
the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.

<span id="vii.xi-p3"></span>**10.** Et mittam in ipsos gladium, famem et
pestem, usque dum consumantur e superficie terrae, quam dedi ipsis et
patribus ipsorum.

<span id="vii.xi-p4"></span> 

<span id="vii.xi-p5"></span><span id="vii.xi-p5.1"></span>

<span id="vii.xi-p6"></span>He confirms the former verse, — that God
would then with extreme rigor punish them, by allowing the city and the
inhabitants who remained, to be given up to the will of their enemies.
And Jeremiah still speaks as from the mouth of Moses, that his prophecy
might be more weighty, and that he might frighten those men who were so
refractory. There are here three kinds of punishments which we often
meet with, under which are included all other punishments. But as God
for the most part punishes the sins of men by pestilence, or by famine,
or by war, he connects these three together when his purpose is to
include all kinds of punishment.

<span id="vii.xi-p7"></span>He adds, *Until they be consumed from the
face of the land;* he says not “until they be consumed in the land,” but
from the face of it, <span id="vii.xi-p7.1"></span>לעמ*, mol,* from upon
it: for the Jews were not consumed in their own country; but he consumed
them by degrees elsewhere, so that they gradually pined away: they were
driven into exile, and that was their final destruction.  <span
id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) What this clause means I have
explained in another place.

<span id="vii.xi-p9"></span>The Prophet adds, *which I gave to them and
to their fathers.* His object here was to shake off from the Jews that
foolish confidence with which they were inebriated: for as they had
heard of the land in which they dwelt, that it was the rest of God, and
as they knew that it had been given to them by an hereditary right,
according to what had been promised to their fathers, they thought that
it could never be taken away from them. They therefore became torpid in
their sins, as though God was bound to them. The Prophet ridicules this
folly by saying, that the promise and favor of God would not prevent him
from depriving them of the land and of its possession, and from
rejecting them as though they were aliens, notwithstanding the fact,
that he had formerly adopted them as his children.

<span id="vii.xi-p10"></span>We now see the meaning of both parts of
this vision. For the Prophet wished to alleviate the sorrow of the
exiles when he said, that their state at length would be better; and so
he promised that God would be reconciled to them after having for a time
chastised them. Thus it is no small comfort to us when we regard the
end; for as the Apostle says to the Hebrews, when we feel the scourges
of God, sorrow is a hinderance to a patient suffering, as chastisement
is for the present grievous, bitter, and difficult to be endured. (<span
id="vii.xi-p10.1"></span>[Heb
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#011)<span id="vii.xi-p10.1"></span>..md)
It is therefore necessary, if we would patiently submit to God, to have
regard to the issue: for until the sinner begins to taste of God’s grace
and mercy, he will fret and murmur, or he will be stupid and hardened;
and certainly he will receive no comfort. Afterwards the Prophet shews,
on the other hand, that though God may spare us for a time, there is yet
no reason for us to indulge ourselves, for he will at length make up for
the delay by the heaviness of his punishment: the more indulgently he
deals with us, the more grievous and dreadful will be his vengeance,
when he sees that we have abused his forbearance. Now follows —

<span id="fn_121"></span>[122](cc19006.htm#fr_121.md) <span
id="vii.i-p3.1"></span>

<span id="vii.i-p4"></span> What this word exactly means it is difficult
to know; it is rendered differently in the Versions and in the Targ. It
is rendered here by the Sept. “prisoners,” and in <span
id="vii.i-p4.2"></span>[2 Kings 24:14](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#014.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/kg2024.htm#016.md)<span id="vii.i-p4.2"></span>,
“encloser, or joiner — <span id="vii.i-p4.3"></span>συγκλείς;” by the
Vulg. in three places, “clausor,” and “inclusor — closer and incloser,”
and also in <span id="vii.i-p4.4"></span>[Jer
29:2](../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#002.md)<span id="vii.i-p4.4"></span>. The
word is not found elsewhere. The Targ. renders it “porters,” and the
Syr. “soldiers.” As the word “artificer,” or mechanic, includes workers
in wood and iron, that is, carpenters and smiths, it is probable that
<span id="vii.i-p4.5"></span>רגסמ means workers in embroidery,
sculpture, and jewellery, Parkhurst was disposed to render it a setter,
or incloser of precious stones; but Blayney renders it an armourer, who
made the coats of mail which inclosed the body, as the word from which
it comes means to inclose. It probably includes all engaged in the
curious works of art, especially the three branches before mentioned.
Perhaps the best modern word for it would be, the artist, —

<span id="vii.i-p5"></span>“after Nebuchadrezar, the king of Babylon,
removed Jeconiah, the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and the
princes of Judah, and the mechanic and the artist, from Jerusalem, and
brought them to Babylon.”

<span id="vii.i-p15"></span> Blayney’s rendering is “offered according
to law before the temple.” See <span id="vii.i-p15.1"></span>[De

id="vii.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="vii.iv-p14"></span> The word “acknowledge,” or own, would lead
us to attach rather a different meaning to this expression: God would
own them “good,” as the good figs. The next verse refers to God’s
purpose to do them good. — *Ed*.

id="vii.ix-p8.1"></span>

<span id="vii.ix-p9"></span> Rather “make.” The verb <span
id="vii.ix-p9.1"></span>ןתנ, to give, means often to make, to
constitute; and such is its meaning evidently here. As the figs were
bad, unfit for eating; so God would make Zedekiah, the princes, etc.,
like them. The previous words, “yea, thus saith Jehovah,” would be
better included in a parenthesis:

<span id="vii.ix-p10"></span>**8.** But like the bad figs, which cannot
be eaten, they being so bad, (yea, thus saith Jehovah,) so will I make
Zedekiah, etc.

<span id="vii.ix-p11"></span>— *Ed*.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[126](cc19006.htm#fr_125.md) <span
id="vii.x-p8.2"></span>

<span id="vii.x-p9"></span> “Vexation,” as rendered by the Vulg., and in
several places in our version, is the best word. The word which follows
is of a similar import, “for evil,” that is, annoyance. The verse is as
follows, —

<span id="vii.x-p10"></span>**9.** And I will make them a vexation, an
evil, To all the kingdoms of the earth, — A reproach and a proverb, A
taunt and an execration, In all the places where I shall drive them.

<span id="vii.x-p11"></span>The word for “taunt” is rendered in other
places “a byword:” it denotes what is sharp and cutting. They were to be
objects and subjects of these things. Being a vexation and an evil, or
an annoyance to others, they would become objects of reproach and
execration, and subjects of proverbs and of taunts. See a note on <span
id="vii.x-p11.2"></span>[Jer 15:4](../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#004.md)<span
id="vii.x-p11.2"></span>; vol. 2 — *Ed*.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[127](cc19006.htm#fr_126.md) <span
id="vii.xi-p7.2"></span>

<span id="vii.xi-p8"></span> The “sword” means war, and by war they were
led captive. But their consumption in captivity is not what is here
related; but their removal from their own land, and the means employed
for that purpose. He had spoken before of what they would become in
exile; but here he goes back as it were to describe their misery at the
time of their captivity; they would be removed from their own land
either by captivity, signified by the sword, or by famine, or by
pestilence. — *Ed*.
