<span id="ii-p1"></span>CHAPTER 16

<span id="ii.i"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p1"></span><span id="ii.i-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
16:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001.md)<span id="ii.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p2"></span>**1.** Now concerning the collection for the
saints, as I have given order to the Churches of Galatia, even so do ye.

<span id="ii.i-p3"></span>**1.** Caeterum de collecta quae fit in
sanctos, quemadmodum ordinavi Ecclesiis Galatiae, ita et vos facite.

<span id="ii.i-p4"></span>**2.** Upon the first *day* of the week let
every one of you lay by him in store, as *God* hath prospered him, that
there be no gatherings when I come.

<span id="ii.i-p5"></span>**2.** In una sabbatorum unusquisque vestrum
apud se seponat, thesaurizans quod successerit, ne, quum venero, tunc
collectae fiant.  <span id="fr_147"></span>[148](#fn_147.md)

<span id="ii.i-p7"></span>**3.** And when I come, whomsoever ye shall
approve by *your* letters, them will I send to bring your liberality
unto Jerusalem.

<span id="ii.i-p8"></span>**3.** Ubi autem affuero, quos probaveritis
per epistolas, eos mittam, ut perferant beneficentiam vestram in
Ierusalem.

<span id="ii.i-p9"></span>**4.** And if it be meet that I go also, they
shall go with me.

<span id="ii.i-p10"></span>**4.** Quodsi fuerit operae pretium me quoque
proficisci, mecum proficiscentur.

<span id="ii.i-p11"></span>**5.** Now I will come unto you, when I shall
pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.

<span id="ii.i-p12"></span>**5.** Veniam autem ad vos, quum Macedoniam
transiero: Macedoniam enim pertransiturus sum.

<span id="ii.i-p13"></span>**6.** And it may be that I will abide, yea,
and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I
go.

<span id="ii.i-p14"></span>**6.** Apud vos autem forte permanebo, aut
etiam hibernabo, ut vos me deducatis quocunque proficiscar.

<span id="ii.i-p15"></span>**7.** For I will not see you now by the way;
but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.

<span id="ii.i-p16"></span>**7.** Nolo enim vos nunc in transcursu
videre: sed spero me ad aliquod tempus mansurum apud vos, si Dominus
permiserit.

<span id="ii.i-p17"></span> 

<span id="ii.i-p18"></span><span id="ii.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p19"></span>**1.** *But concerning the collection* Luke
relates (<span id="ii.i-p19.2"></span>[Ac
11:28](../../../bib/kjv/act011.htm#028)<span id="ii.i-p19.2"></span>.md)
that the prediction of Agabus, foretelling that there would be a famine
under Claudius Caesar, gave occasion for alms being collected by the
saints, with the view of affording help to the brethren in Jerusalem.
For though the Prophet had foretold, that this calamity would be
generally prevalent almost throughout the world, yet as they were more
heavily oppressed with penury at Jerusalem, and as all the Gentile
Churches were bound, if they would not be held guilty of very great
ingratitude, to afford aid to that place from which they had received
the gospel, every one, consequently, forgetful of self, resolved to
afford relief to Jerusalem. That the pressure of want was felt heavily
at Jerusalem, appears from the Epistle to the Galatians, (<span
id="ii.i-p19.3"></span>[Ga 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.i-p19.3"></span>,) where Paul relates, that he had been charged
by the Apostles to stir up the Gentiles to afford help.  <span
id="fr_148"></span>[149](#fn_148.md) Now the Apostles would never have
given such a charge, had they not been constrained by necessity.
Farther, this passage is an evidence of the truth of what Paul states
there also — that he had been careful to exhort the Gentiles to afford
help in such a case of necessity. Now, however, he prescribes the method
of relief; and that the Corinthians may accede to it the more readily,
he mentions that he had already prescribed it to the Churches of
Galatia; for they would necessarily be the more influenced by example,
as we are wont to feel a natural backwardness to anything that is not
ordinarily practiced. Now follows the method — by which he designed to
cut off all hinderances and impediments.

<span id="ii.i-p21"></span><span id="ii.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p22"></span>**2.** *On one of the Sabbaths.* The end is
this — that they may have their alms ready in time. He therefore exhorts
them not to wait till he came, as anything that is done suddenly, and in
a bustle, is not done well, but to contribute on the Sabbath what might
seem good, and according as every one’s ability might enable — that is,
on the day on which they held their sacred assemblies. The clause
rendered on *one of the Sabbaths, (*<span id="ii.i-p22.1"></span>κατὰ
μίαν σαββάτων*,)* Chrysostom explains to mean — *the first Sabbath.* In
this I do not agree with him; for Paul means rather that they should
contribute, one on one Sabbath and another on another; or even each of
them every Sabbath, if they chose. For he has an eye, first of all, to
convenience, and farther, that the sacred assembly, in which the
communion of saints is celebrated, might be an additional spur to them.
Nor am I more inclined to admit the view taken by Chrysostom — that the
term *Sabbath* is employed here to mean the *Lord’s day,* (<span
id="ii.i-p22.2"></span>[Re 1:10](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.i-p22.2"></span>,) for the probability is, that the Apostles, at
the beginning, retained the day that was already in use, but that
afterwards, constrained by the superstition of the *Jews,* they set
aside that day, and substituted another. Now the *Lord’s day* was made
choice of, chiefly because our Lord’s *resurrection* put an end to the
shadows of the law. Hence the day itself puts us in mind of our
Christian liberty. We may, however, very readily infer from this
passage, that believers have always had a certain day of rest from labor
— not as if the worship of God consisted in idleness, but because it is
of importance for the common harmony, that a certain day should be
appointed for holding sacred assemblies, as they cannot be held every
day. For as to Paul’s forbidding elsewhere (<span
id="ii.i-p22.3"></span>[Ga 4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010.md)<span
id="ii.i-p22.3"></span>) that any distinction should be made between one
day and another, *that* must be understood to be with a view to
religion,  <span id="fr_149"></span>[150](#fn_149.md) and not with a view
to polity or external order.  <span id="fr_150"></span>[151](#fn_150.md)

<span id="ii.i-p25"></span>*Treasuring up* I have preferred to retain
the Greek *participle,* as it appeared to me to be more emphatic.  <span
id="fr_151"></span>[152](#fn_151.md) For although <span
id="ii.i-p26.2"></span>θησανρίζειν means to *lay up,* yet in my opinion,
he designed to admonish the Corinthians, that whatever they might
contribute for the saints would be their best and safest *treasure.* For
if a heathen poet could say — “What riches you give away, those alone
you shall always *have,*  <span id="fr_152"></span>[153](#fn_152.md) how
much more ought that consideration to have influence among us, who are
not dependent on the gratitude of men, but have God to look to, who
makes himself a debtor in the room of the poor man, to restore to us one
day, with large interest, whatever we give away? (<span
id="ii.i-p27.4"></span>[Pr 19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017.md)<span
id="ii.i-p27.4"></span>.) Hence this statement of Paul corresponds with
that saying of Christ —

<span id="ii.i-p28"></span>Lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven,
where it will not be exposed either to thieves, or to moths. (<span
id="ii.i-p28.1"></span>[Mt 6:20](../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#020.md)<span
id="ii.i-p28.1"></span>.)

<span id="ii.i-p29"></span>*According as he has prospered.* Instead of
this the old translation has rendered it, *What may seem good to him,*
misled, no doubt, by the resemblance between the word made use of, and
another.  <span id="fr_153"></span>[154](#fn_153.md) Erasmus renders it,
*What will be convenient.*  <span id="fr_154"></span>[155](#fn_154.md)
Neither the one nor the other pleased me, for this reason — that the
proper signification of the word brings out a meaning that is much more
suitable; for it means — to *go on prosperously.* Hence he calls every
one to consider his ability — “Let every one, according as God hath
blessed him, lay out upon the poor from his increase.”

<span id="ii.i-p32"></span><span id="ii.i-p32.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p33"></span>**3.** *And when I come* As we are cheerful
in giving, when we know for certain, that what we give is well laid out,
he points out to the Corinthians a method, by which they may be assured
of a good and faithful administration — by selecting approved persons,
to whom they may intrust the matter. Nay more, he offers his own
services, if desired, which is an evidence that he has the matter at
heart.

<span id="ii.i-p34"></span><span id="ii.i-p34.1"></span>

<span id="ii.i-p35"></span>**5.** *When I shall pass through Macedonia*
The common opinion is, that this espistle was sent from Philippi.
Persons coming thence to Corinth by land, required to pass through
Macedonia; for that colony is situated in the farthest extremity,
towards the Emathian mountains. Paul, it is true, might, instead of
going by land, have gone thither by sea, but he was desirous to visit
the Macedonian Churches, that he might confirm them in passing. So much
for the common opinion. To me, however, it appears more probable, that
the epistle was written at Ephesus; for he says a little afterwards,
that *he will remain there until Pentecost,* (<span
id="ii.i-p35.2"></span>[1Co 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.i-p35.2"></span>)  <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) ; and
he salutes the Corinthians, not in the name of the Philippians, but of
the *Asiatics.* (<span id="ii.i-p36.1"></span>[1Co
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#019)<span id="ii.i-p36.1"></span>..md)
 <span id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) Besides, in the second epistle
he explicitly states, that, after he had sent away this epistle, he
passed over into Macedonia. (<span id="ii.i-p37.1"></span>[2Co
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#013)<span id="ii.i-p37.1"></span>..md)
Now after passing through Macedonia, he would be at a distance from
Ephesus, and in the neighborhood of Achaia. Hence I have no doubt that
he was at Ephesus at that time: *thence* he could sail by a straight
course to Achaia. For visiting Macedonia, a long circuit was needed, and
a more disagreeable route. Accordingly he lets them know that he will
not come to them by a direct course, as he required to *go through
Macedonia*

<span id="ii.i-p38"></span>To the Corinthians, however, he promises
something farther — that he would *make a longer stay with them* By this
he shows his affection towards them. For what reason had he for delay,
except that he was concerned as to their welfare? On the other hand, he
lets them know how fully assured he is of their affection towards him in
return, by taking it, as it were, for granted that he would be conducted
forward by them in the way of kindness; for he says this from
*confidence* in their friendship.  <span
id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md)

<span id="ii.i-p40"></span>After saying everything, however, he subjoins
this limitation — *if the Lord permit* With this reservation, saints
ought to follow up all their plans and deliberations; for it is an
instance of great rashness to undertake and determine many things for
the future, while we have not even a moment in our power. The main thing
indeed is, that, in the inward affection of the mind, we submit to God
and his providence, whatever we resolve upon;  <span
id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) but at *the* same time, it is becoming
that we should accustom ourselves to such forms of expression, that
whenever we have to do with what is future we may make everything depend
on the divine will.  <span id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md)

<span id="ii.ii"></span>

<span id="ii.ii-p1"></span><span id="ii.ii-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
16:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008.md)<span id="ii.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii-p2"></span>**8.** But I will tarry at Ephesus until
Pentecost.

<span id="ii.ii-p3"></span>**8.** Commorabor autem Ephesi usque ad
Pentecosten.

<span id="ii.ii-p4"></span>**9.** For a great door and effectual is
opened unto me, and *there are* many adversaries.

<span id="ii.ii-p5"></span>**9.** Nam ostium milli aperture est magnum
et efficax, et  <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md) adversarii
multi.

<span id="ii.ii-p7"></span>**10.** Now if Timotheus come, see that he
may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I
also *do*

<span id="ii.ii-p8"></span>**10.** Quodsi venerit Timotheus, videte, ut
absque metu sit apud vos: opus enim Domini operatur, quemadmodum et ego.

<span id="ii.ii-p9"></span>**11.** Let no man therefore despise him: but
conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him
with the brethren.

<span id="ii.ii-p10"></span>**11.** Ne quis igitur eum spernat: sed
prosequamini eum cum pace,  <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) ut
veniat ad me: exspecto enim eum cum fratribus.

<span id="ii.ii-p12"></span>**12.** As touching *our* brother Apollos, I
greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was
not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have
convenient time.

<span id="ii.ii-p13"></span>**12.** Porro de Apollo fratre, multum
hortatus sum illum, ut veniret ad vos cum fratribus, at omnino non fuit
voluntas nunc eundi: veniet autem, quam opportunitatem nactus erit.

<span id="ii.ii-p14"></span> 

<span id="ii.ii-p15"></span><span id="ii.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii-p16"></span>**8.** *I will remain.* From this statement
I have argued above, that this epistle was sent from Ephesus, rather
than from Philippi. For the probability is, that the Apostle speaks of
the place in which he was at the time, and not of a place, in going to
which he would require to make a long circuit; and farther, in passing
through Macedonia,  <span id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) it would
have been necessary to leave Corinth when already in the neighborhood of
it, and cross the sea in order to reach Ephesus. He accordingly tells
them beforehand that he will *remain at Ephesus until Pentecost,* adding
the reason — in order that they may wait for him the more patiently.
Erasmus has preferred to render it — *until the fiftieth day,*
influenced by frivolous conjectures rather than by any solid argument.
He objects, that there was as yet no day of Pentecost appointed among
Christians, as it is now celebrated; and this I grant. He says, that it
ought not to be understood as referring to the Jewish solemnity, because
in various instances he annuls and condemns the superstitious observance
of days. (<span id="ii.ii-p17.2"></span>[Ga
4:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#010.md)<span id="ii.ii-p17.2"></span>;
<span id="ii.ii-p17.3"></span>[Ro
14:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#005.md)<span id="ii.ii-p17.3"></span>;
<span id="ii.ii-p17.4"></span>[Col.
2:16](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#016.md),
[17](../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#017)<span id="ii.ii-p17.4"></span>..md) I
do not concede to him, however, that Paul celebrated that day at Ephesus
from being influenced by a superstitious regard to the day, but because
there would be a larger assembly at that time, and he hoped that, in
that way, an opportunity would be presented to him of propagating the
gospel. Thus, when he was hastening forward to Jerusalem, he assigned as
the reason of his haste, *that he might arrive there at Pentecost,*
(<span id="ii.ii-p17.5"></span>[Ac
20:16](../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#016)<span id="ii.ii-p17.5"></span>;.md)
but while others presented themselves there for the purpose of
sacrificing according to the ritual of the law, he himself had another
object in view — that his ministry might be the more useful in
proportion to the largeness of the attendance. It were, however, an
excessively poor meaning to understand Paul here as simply specifying
fifty days. Besides, when he expressly says <span
id="ii.ii-p17.6"></span>τὴν πεντηκοστήν *(the Pentecost,)* he cannot but
be understood as speaking of a particular day. As to this festival, see
<span id="ii.ii-p17.7"></span>[Le
23:16](../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#016.md)<span id="ii.ii-p17.7"></span>

<span id="ii.ii-p18"></span><span id="ii.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii-p19"></span>**9.** *For a great and effectual door is
opened to me.* He assigns two reasons for remaining for a longer time at
Ephesus — 1st, Because an opportunity is afforded him there of
furthering the gospel; and 2dly, Because, in consequence of the great
number of *adversaries* that were there, his presence was particularly
required. “I shall do much good by prolonging my stay here for a little
while, and were I absent, Satan would do much injury.” In the first
clause, he makes use of a metaphor that is quite in common use, when he
employs the term *door* as meaning *an opportunity.* For the Lord opened
up a way for him for the furtherance of the gospel. He calls this a
*great* door, because he could gain many. He calls it *effectual,*
inasmuch as the Lord blessed his labor, and rendered his doctrine
*effectual* by the power of His Spirit. We see, then, how this holy man
 <span id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) sought everywhere Christ’s
glory, and did not select a place with a view to his own convenience or
his own pleasure; but simply looked to this — *where* he might do most
good, and serve his Lord with most abundant fruit; and in addition to
this, he did not merely not shrink back from hardships, but presented
himself, of his own accord, where he saw that he would have to contend
more keenly, and with greater difficulty. For the reason why he
*remained*  <span id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) was, that *many
adversaries* were at hand; and the better equipped he was for enduring
their assault, he required to be so much the better prepared, and the
more resolute.

<span id="ii.ii-p22"></span><span id="ii.ii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii-p23"></span>**10.** *But if Timothy come.* He speaks as
if he were not as yet certain as to his coming. Now he charges them as
to Timothy, so that he may be with them in safety — not as though he
were in danger of his life among them, but because he would have enemies
of Christ  <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) to oppose him. He
wishes, therefore, that they should carefully take heed that no injury
be done to him.

<span id="ii.ii-p25"></span>He adds the reason — for he *worketh the
work of the Lord* Hence we infer, that the Church of Christ ought to be
concerned for the preservation of the lives of ministers. And assuredly,
it is reasonable, that, in proportion as an individual is endowed with
superior gifts for the edification of believers, and applies himself to
it the more strenuously, his life ought to be so much dearer to us.

<span id="ii.ii-p26"></span>The clause — *as I also do,* is made use of,
either to express his *excellence,* or simply to point out the
similarity as to office, inasmuch as both labored in the word.

<span id="ii.ii-p27"></span><span id="ii.ii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii-p28"></span>**11.** *Let no man, therefore, despise him*
Here we have a *second* charge, *that they may not despise* him —
perhaps because he was as yet of a youthful age, which usually draws
forth less respect. He wishes them, therefore, to take care, that there
be no hinderance in the way of this faithful minister of Christ being
held in due esteem — unless, perhaps, it be that Paul reckoned this very
thing to be an evidence of contempt, if they were not concerned, as it
became them to be, in reference to his life. This injunction, however,
appears to include something farther, that they should not undervalue
Timothy, from ignorance of his worth.

<span id="ii.ii-p29"></span>In the *third* place, he charges them to
*conduct him forward in peace,* or, in other words, *safe from all
harm,* for *peace* here means safety.

<span id="ii.ii-p30"></span><span id="ii.ii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="ii.ii-p31"></span>**12.** *As to our brother Apollos.* He had
succeeded Paul in the work of building up the Corinthians; and hence he
has in previous passages ascribed to him the office of *watering.*
(<span id="ii.ii-p31.1"></span>[1Co
3:6](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#006.md)<span id="ii.ii-p31.1"></span>, and
<span id="ii.ii-p31.2"></span>[Ac
19:1](../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001)<span id="ii.ii-p31.2"></span>..md)
He now states a reason why he does not come with the others, and he
states the reason of this, in order that the Corinthians may not suspect
that he had been hindered by him. For the better he was known by them,
they were so much the more favourably disposed towards him, and they
would be the more ready to conjecture, that matters had been designedly
contrived, that he should not go to them, in *consequence* of offense
having been taken.  <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) They might,
at least, be prepared to inquire among themselves: “Why has he sent
these persons to us rather than Apollos?” He answers, that it was not
owing to him, inasmuch as he *entreated him;* but he promises that he
*will come as soon as he has opportunity.*

<span id="ii.iii-p3"></span>**13.** Vigilate, state in fide, viriliter

<span id="ii.iii-p5"></span>**14.** Omnia vestra in caritate fiant.

<span id="ii.iii-p6"></span>**15.** I beseech you, brethren, (ye know
the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and *that*
they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)

<span id="ii.iii-p7"></span>**15.** Hortor autem vos, fratres, nostis
domum Stephanae, primitias esse Achaiae, atque ut se in ministerium
sanctorum ordinaverint:

<span id="ii.iii-p8"></span>**16.** That ye submit yourselves unto such,
and to every one that helpeth with *us*, and laboureth.

<span id="ii.iii-p9"></span>**16.** Ut etiam subiecti sitis tallbus, et
omnibus qui cooperantur et laborant.

<span id="ii.iii-p10"></span>**17.** I am glad of the coming of
Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on our
part they have supplied.

<span id="ii.iii-p11"></span>**17.** Gaudeo autem de praesentia
Stephanie, et Fortunati, et Achaici: quia quod deerat a vobis, ipsi
suppleverunt.

<span id="ii.iii-p12"></span>**18.** For they have refreshed my spirit
and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.

<span id="ii.iii-p13"></span>**18.** Refocillarunt enim spiritum meum et

<span id="ii.iii-p18"></span>**21.** The salutation of *me* Paul with
mine own hand.

<span id="ii.iii-p19"></span>**21.** Salutatio mea manu Pauli.

<span id="ii.iii-p20"></span>**22.** If any man love not the Lord Jesus
Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.

<span id="ii.iii-p21"></span>**22.** Si quis non amat Dominum Iesum
Christum, sit anathema maranatha.

<span id="ii.iii-p22"></span>**23.** The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
*be* with you.

vobiscum.

<span id="ii.iii-p26"></span>The first epistle to the Corinthians was
written from Philippi by Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, and
Timotheus.

<span id="ii.iii-p27"></span>Ad Corinthios prior missa fuit e Philippis
per Stephanam, et Fortunatum, et Andronicum, et Timotheum.  <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167.md)

<span id="ii.iii-p29"></span> 

<span id="ii.iii-p30"></span><span id="ii.iii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p31"></span>**13.** *Watch ye*. A short exhortation,
but of great weight. He exhorts them to *watch,* in order that Satan may
not oppress them, finding them off their guard. For as the warfare is
incessant, the *watching* requires to be incessant too. Now watchfulness
of spirit is this — when, free and disentangled from earthly cares, we
meditate on the things of God. For as the body is weighed down by
*surfeiting and drunkenness,* (<span id="ii.iii-p31.1"></span>[Lu
21:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#034)<span id="ii.iii-p31.1"></span>,.md)
so as to be fit for nothing, so the cares and lusts of the world,
idleness or carelessness, are like a spiritual surfeiting that
overpowers the mind.  <span id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md)

<span id="ii.iii-p33"></span>The *second* thing is that they *persevere
in the faith,* or that they hold fast the faith, so as to *stand firm;*
because that is the foundation on which we rest. It is certain, however,
that he points out the means of perseverance — by resting upon God with
a firm faith.

<span id="ii.iii-p34"></span>In the *third* exhortation, which is much
of the same nature, he stirs them up to manly fortitude. And, as we are
naturally weak, he exhorts them *fourthly to* strengthen themselves, or
gather strength. For where we render it *be strong,* Paul makes use of
only one word, which is equivalent to *strengthen yourselves.*

<span id="ii.iii-p35"></span><span id="ii.iii-p35.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p36"></span>**14.** *Let all your things be done in
love* Again he repeats what is the rule in all those transactions, in
which we have dealings with one another. He wishes, then, that *love*
shall be the directress; because the Corinthians erred chiefly in this
respect — that every one looked to himself without caring for others.

<span id="ii.iii-p37"></span><span id="ii.iii-p37.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p38"></span>**15.** *Ye know the house of Stephanas* We
know, from daily experience, of what advantage it is, that those should
have the highest authority, whom God has adorned with the most
distinguished gifts. Accordingly, if we wish to secure the welfare of
the Church, let us always take care that honor be conferred upon the
good: let their counsels have the greatest weight; let others give way
to them, and allow themselves to be governed by their prudence. This
Paul does in this instance, when admonishing the Corinthians to show
respect to the *house of Stephanas.* Some manuscripts add, *and
Fortunatus.*  <span id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) For God manifests
himself to us when he shows us the gifts of his Spirit. Hence, if we
would not appear to be despisers of God, let us voluntarily *submit
ourselves* to those, on whom God has conferred superior gifts.

<span id="ii.iii-p40"></span>Now, that they may be the more inclined to
put honor upon *that house,* (for as to the other, it appears to me to
be, in this place at least, a spurious addition,) he reminds them that
they were the *first-fruits of Achaia,* that is, that the household of
Stephanas were the first that had embraced the gospel. Not indeed as
though the first in order of time were in every case superior to the
others, but where there is perseverance along with this, it is with good
reason, that honor is conferred upon those, who have in a manner paved
the way for the gospel by promptitude of faith. It must be observed,
however, that he dignifies with this honorable title those, who had
consecrated to believers their services and resources. For the same
reason, he bestows commendation a little afterwards upon Fortunatus and
Achaicus, that, in proportion to a man’s superiority of excellence,
 <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) he might be held so much the
more in esteem, that he might be able to do the more good. Farther, in
order that the Corinthians may be the more disposed to love them, he
says, that *what had been wanting* on the part of their entire Church
*had been compensated for* by their vicarious services.

<span id="ii.iii-p42"></span><span id="ii.iii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p43"></span>**19.** *With the Church that is in their
house* A magnificent eulogium, inasmuch as the name of the Church is
applied to a single family! At the same time it is befitting, that all
the families of the pious should be regulated in such a manner as to be
so many little Churches. As to the term *Congregation,* which Erasmus
has used in preference, it is foreign to Paul’s design; for it was not
his intention to designate a crowd of persons by a mere common term, but
to speak in honorable terms of the management of a Christian household.
His saluting them in the name of Aquila and Priscilla, confirms what I
have noticed above — that the Epistle was written at Ephesus, not at
Philippi. For Luke informs us, that they remained at Ephesus, when Paul
went elsewhere. (<span id="ii.iii-p43.2"></span>[Ac
18:19](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#019)<span id="ii.iii-p43.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ii.iii-p44"></span><span id="ii.iii-p44.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p45"></span>**20.** *Salute one another with a holy
kiss.* The practice of kissing was very common among the Jews, as is
manifest from the Scriptures. In *Greece,* though it was not so common
and customary, it was by no means unknown; but the probability is, that
Paul speaks here of a solemn kiss, with which they saluted each other in
the sacred assembly. For I could easily believe, that from the times of
the Apostles a kiss was used in connection with the administration of
the Supper;  <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) in place of which,
among nations that were somewhat averse to the practice of kissing,
there crept in the custom of kissing the patine.  <span
id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) However this may be, as it was a token
of mutual love. I have no doubt, that Paul meant to exhort them to the
cultivation of good-will among themselves — not merely in their minds
 <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md) and in needful services, but
also by that token, provided only it was *holy,* that is, neither
unchaste nor deceitful,  <span id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) —
though, at the same time, *holy* may be taken to mean *sacred.*

<span id="ii.iii-p50"></span><span id="ii.iii-p50.1"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p51"></span>**22.** *If any man love not the Lord
Jesus* The close of the Epistle consists of *three* parts. He entreats
the grace of Christ in behalf of the Corinthians: he makes a declaration
of his love towards them, and, with the severest threatening, he
inveighs against those that falsely took upon themselves the Lord’s
name, while not loving him from the heart. For he is not speaking of
strangers, who avowedly hated the Christian name, but of pretenders and
hypocrites, who troubled the Churches for the sake of their own belly,
or from empty boasting.  <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) On such
persons he denounces an anathema, and he also pronounces a curse upon
them. It is not certain, however, whether he desires their destruction
in the presence of God, or whether he wishes to render them odious —
nay, even execrable, in the view of believers. Thus in <span
id="ii.iii-p52.2"></span>[Ga 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008.md)<span
id="ii.iii-p52.2"></span>, when pronouncing one who corrupts the Gospel
to be *accursed,*  <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md) he does not
mean that he was rejected or condemned by God, but he declares that he
is to be abhorred by us. I expound it in a simple way as follows: “Let
them perish and be cut off, as being the pests of the Church.” And
truly, there is nothing that is more pernicious, than that class of
persons, who prostitute a profession of piety to their own depraved
affections. Now he points out the origin of this evil, when he says,
that they do not love Christ, for a sincere and earnest love to Christ
will not suffer us to give occasion of offense to brethren.  <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md)

<span id="ii.iii-p55"></span>What he immediately *adds* — *Maranatha,*
is somewhat more difficult. Almost all of the ancients are agreed, that
they are Syriac terms.  <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md)
*Jerome,* however, explains it: *The Lord cometh;* while others render
it, *At the coming of the Lord,* or, *Until the Lord comes.* Every one,
however, I think, must see how silly and puerile is the idea, that the
Apostle spoke to Greeks in the Syriac tongue, when meaning to say — *The
Lord has come.* Those who translate it, *at the coming of the Lord,* do
so on mere conjecture; and besides, there is not much plausibility in
that interpretation. How much more likely it is, that this was a
customary form of expression among the Hebrews, when they wished to
excommunicate any one. For the Apostles never speak in foreign tongues,
except when they repeat anything in the person of another, as for
example, *Eli, Eli, lammah sabathani,* (<span
id="ii.iii-p56.2"></span>[Mt
27:46](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#046)<span id="ii.iii-p56.2"></span>,.md)
*Talitha cumi,* (<span id="ii.iii-p56.3"></span>[Mr
5:41](../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#041)<span id="ii.iii-p56.3"></span>,.md)
and *Ephphata,* (<span id="ii.iii-p56.4"></span>[Mr
7:34](../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#034)<span id="ii.iii-p56.4"></span>,.md)
or when they make use of a word that has come into common use, as *Amen*
— *Hosanna.* Let us see, then, whether *Maranatha* suits with
excommunication. Now Bullinger,  <span id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md)
on the authority of Theodore Bibliander, has affirmed, that, in the
Chaldee dialect, *Maharamata* has the same meaning as the Hebrew term
<span id="ii.iii-p61.1"></span>חרם, *cherem, (accursed,)*  <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) and I was myself at one time assured
of the same thing by Wolfgang Capito,  <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md) a man of blessed memory It is nothing
unusual, however, for the Apostles to write such terms differently from
the way in which they are pronounced in the language from which they are
derived; as may be seen even from the instances brought forward above.
Paul, then, after pronouncing an anathema on those who *do not love
Christ,*  <span id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) deeply affected with
the seriousness of the matter, as if he reckoned that he had not said
enough, added a term that was in common use among the Jews, and which
they made use of in pronouncing a sentence of anathema — just as if,
speaking in Latin, I should say, “I excommunicate thee,” but if I add —
“and pronounce thee an anathema,” this would be an expression of more
intense feeling.  <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md)

<span id="ii.iii-p46"></span> “That the Apostle,” says Dr. Brown in his
Commentary on 1st Peter, “meant the members of the Churches, on
receiving this Epistle, to salute one another is certain; that he meant,
that at all their religious meetings they should do so, is not
*improbable.* That he meant to make this an everlasting ordinance in all
Christian Churches, though it has sometimes been asserted, has never
been proved, and is by no means likely. That the practice prevailed
extensively, perhaps universally, in the earlier ages, is established on
satisfactory evidence. ‘After the prayers,’ says Justin Martyr, who
lived in the earlier part of the second century, giving an account in
his Apology of the religious customs of the Christians — ’after the
prayers, we embrace each other with a kiss.’ Tertullian speaks of it as
an ordinary part of the religious services of the Lord’s day; and in the
Apostolical Constitutions, as they are *termed,* the manner in which it
was performed is particularly described. ‘Then let the men apart, and
the women apart, salute each other with a kiss in the Lord.’ Origen’s
Note on <span id="ii.iii-p46.1"></span>[Ro
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md)<span id="ii.iii-p46.1"></span>,
is: ‘From this passage the custom was delivered to the Churches, that,
after prayer, the brethren should salute one another with a kiss.’ This
token of love was generally given at the Holy Supper. It was likely,
from the prevalence of this custom, that the calumny of Christians
indulging in licentiousness at their religious meetings originated; and
it is not improbable that, in order to remove everything like an
occasion to calumniators, the practice which, though in itself innocent,
had become not for the use of edifying, was *discontinued.”* — *Brown’s*
Expository Discourses on 1st Peter, volume in. pages 309, 310. “It is
remarkable that, by the testimony of Suetonius, an edict was published
by one of the Roman Emperors, for the abolition of this practice among
his subjects, — perhaps in order to check abuses, for the prevention of
which our Apostle enjoins that it shall be a *holy salutation.”* —
*Chalmers* on the Romans, volume in. page 428. — Ed.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[173](cc40001.htm#fr_172.md) <span
id="ii.iii-p46.2"></span>

<span id="ii.iii-p47"></span> By the <span
id="ii.iii-p47.1"></span>*patine* or <span
id="ii.iii-p47.2"></span>*paten,* is meant the *plate* or *salver* on
which the wafer or bread was placed in the observance of the mass. The
term is made use of by *Dr. Stillingfleet* in his “Preservative from
Popery,” (title 7, chapter 5,) in speaking of the practice of the Church
of Rome in the adoration of the host: “The priest in every mass, as soon
as he has consecrated the bread and wine, with bended knees, he adores
the sacrament; that which he has consecrated, that very thing which is
before him, upon the <span id="ii.iii-p47.3"></span>*patine,* and in the
chalice; and gives the same worship and subjection, both of body and
mind, to it as he could to God or Christ himself.” In *Young’s* Lectures
on Popery, (Loud. 1836,) page 140, the following account is given of the
sacrifice of the mass: “Upon the altar is the chalice, or cup, which is
to contain the wine, mixed with a little water; and covering the cup is
the <span id="ii.iii-p47.4"></span>*paten,* or *plate,* intended to hold
the cake or wafer. After an almost endless variety of movements, and
forms, and prayers, and readings, the priest goes to the altar, and,
taking the cup containing wine and water, with the wafer upon the
*cover,* — *these* having been before consecrated and transubstantiated
into the body and blood of Christ, — he raises his eyes and says, ‘Take,
O Holy Trinity, this oblation, which I, unworthy sinner, offer in honor
of thee, of the blessed Virgin Mary, and of all the saints, for the
salvation of the living, and for the rest and quiet of all the faithful
that are dead.’ Then, setting down the chalice, he says, ‘Let this
sacrifice be acceptable to Almighty *God.’”* The name <span
id="ii.iii-p47.5"></span>*paten* is preserved in the English Liturgy to
this day. In the prayer of consecration, in the communion service — in
connection with the words, *“who,* in the same night that he was
betrayed, took bread,” it is said, *“here* the priest is to take the
*paten* into his hands.” Calvin, when commenting upon <span
id="ii.iii-p47.6"></span>[Ro
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md)<span id="ii.iii-p47.6"></span>,
after having stated that it was customary among the primitive
Christians, before partaking of the Lord’s Supper, to kiss each other in
token of sacred friendship, and afterwards to give alms, says, *“*<span
id="ii.iii-p47.7"></span>*Hinc* fluxit ritus ille, qui hodie est apud
Papistas, *osculandoe patents,* et conferendse oblationis. Quorum
alterum merae est superstitionis, sine ullo fructu: alterum non alto
facit, nisi ad explendam sacerdotum avari-tiam, si tamen expleri
posset;*”* — *“*From this has sprung that ceremony which is at this day
among Papists, of *kissing the patine,* and making an offering. The
former is mere superstition without any advantage: the latter serves no
purpose, except to *satisfy* the greed of the priests, if *satis*fied it
can be.” *­Poole,* in his Annotations on <span
id="ii.iii-p47.8"></span>[Ro
16:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#016.md)<span id="ii.iii-p47.8"></span>,
says, “The primitive Christians did use it” (the *holy kiss) “in* their
assemblies; so *Tertullian* testifieth, (Lib. Dec.,) and they did it
especially in receiving the Eucharist. So Chrysostom witnesseth, (Hom.
77 in <span id="ii.iii-p47.9"></span>[John
16](../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#000)<span id="ii.iii-p47.9"></span>,.md)
‘we do well,’ saith he, ‘to *kiss in the mysteries,* that we may become
*one.’* This custom for good reasons is laid down, and the *Romanists*
in room of it, keep up a foolish and superstitious ceremony, which is to
*kiss the pax* in the mass.” — Ed.

remarks that the original term there employed, *anathema,* denotes
*cursing,* and answers to the Hebrew word <span
id="ii.iii-p53.3"></span>חרם; and he explains the expression — “let him
be accursed,” as meaning, “Let him be held by you as accursed.”

<span id="ii.iii-p57"></span> Beza, in his poems, has recorded the
following tribute to the memory of this distinguished man —

<span id="ii.iii-p58"></span>“Henrici Bullingeri, Ecclesiastae Tigurini,
spectatisa, doctrine, pictaris, et eximii candoris viri, memoriae;” —
(To the memory of HENRY Bullinger, ecclesiastick of Tigurum, a man most
distinguished for learning and piety, and extraordinary candour.)

<span id="ii.iii-p59"></span>“<span id="ii.iii-p59.1"></span>Doctrina si
interire, si Pietas mori,  
Occidere si Candor potest:  
Doctrina, Pietas, Candor, hoc tumulo iacent,  
Henrice, tecum condita.  
Mori sed absit ilia posse dixerim;  
Quae viuere jubent mortnos,  
Immo interire forsan ilia si queant  
Subireque tumuli specum,  
Tu tu, illa doctis, tu piis, tu candidis,  
Et non mori certissimis,  
Edaci ab ipsa morte chartis asseras,  
Ipso approbante Numine.  
Foedus beatum! mortuum ilia to excitant,  
Et tu mori ilia non sinis:  
At hunc, amici, cur fleamus mortuum,  
Qui viuat aliis et sibi?”

<span id="ii.iii-p60"></span>“If Learning could expire, if Piety could
die,  
If Candour could sink down,  
Learning, Piety, Candour, are laid in this mound,  
O Henry, buried along with thee!  
But forbid that I should say that those things could die,  
Which command the dead to live.  
Nay, if they could possibly expire,  
And be entombed,  
Thou, by thy writings learned, pious, candid,  
And perfectly secured against death,  
Wouldst shield them from devouring death,  
The Deity himself approving.  
Blessed agreement! They raise thee up from death,  
And thou dost not suffer them to die!  
But, my friends, why should we weep for him, as dead,  
Who lives to others and himself?”

having occasion to speak of the etymology of the term *Pharisees,* says
that he considered it to be derived — not as was commonly supposed, from
a word signifying to *separate* — -but from a term denoting
*interpretation,* this having been the view given of it by *Capito* —
*“*<span id="ii.iii-p63.3"></span>sanctae memoriae viro,” — “a man of
sacred memory.” It is stated by Beza in his life of Calvin, that when at
Basle, Calvin lived on intimate terms with those two distinguished men,
Simon Grynaeus and Wolfgang Capito, and devoted himself to the study of
Hebrew. — Calvin’s Tracts, volume 1. — Ed.

(Maran atha) is a Syro-Chaldee expression, signifying ‘the Lord is to

vicious. Hence with the words Anathema Maranatha the Jews began their
papers of *excommunication.”* — *Bloomfield.*
