*Calvin's Commentaries, Vol. 40: Corinthians, Part II*, tr. by John
King, \[1847-50\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

<span id="v"></span>

<span id="v-p1"></span>THE AUTHOR’S DEDICATORY EPISTLE.

<span id="v-p2"></span>TO THAT MOST ACCOMPLISHED MAN,

<span id="v-p3"></span>MELCHIOR WOLMAR RUFUS, LAWYER.

<span id="v-p4"></span>JOHN CALVIN

<span id="v-p5"></span>HEALTH.

<span id="v-p6"></span>Should you be disposed to charge me, not merely
with neglect, but even with incivility, for not having written to you
for so long a time, I confess I have scarcely any apology to offer. For
if I were to allege that the distance between us is so great, and that,
during fully five years, I have met with no one that was going in your
direction, this indeed were true, but it would be, I readily
acknowledge, but a lame excuse. It appeared to me, accordingly, that I
could not do better than offer to you some compensation, that might make
up for the errors of the past, and might at once set me clear from all
blame. Here, then, you have a commentary on the Second Epistle of Paul
to the Corinthians, prepared by me with as much care as was in my power.
 <span id="fr_194"></span>[195](#fn_194) For I have no doubt that you
will, in your kindness, accept of this as a sufficient compensation. At
the same time there are other and weightier considerations, that have
induced me to dedicate this to you.

<span id="v-p8"></span>First of all, I remember with what fidelity
 <span id="fr_195"></span>[196](#fn_195) you cherished and strengthened
the friendship, which had begun, (now long since,) in some small degree,
to subsist between us — how generously you were prepared to lay out
yourself and your services on my account, when you thought that you had
an opportunity presented to you of testifying your affection towards me;
how carefully you made offer to me of your assistance  <span
id="fr_196"></span>[197](#fn_196) for my advancement, had not the
calling in which I was at that time engaged prevented me from availing
myself of it. Nothing, however, has had greater weight with me than the
recollection of the first time I was sent by my father to learn civil
law. Under your direction and tuition, I conjoined with the study of law
Greek literature, of which you were at that time a most celebrated
professor. And certainly it was not owing to you that I did not make
greater proficiency; for, with your wonted kindness of disposition, you
would have had no hesitation in lending me a helping hand for the
completion of my course, had I not been called away by my father’s
death, when I had little more than started. I am, however, under no
small obligations to you in this respect, that I was initiated by you in
the rudiments, at least, which were afterwards of great advantage to me.
Hence I could not satisfy myself without leaving to posterity some
memorial of my gratitude, and at the same time rendering to you some
fruit, such as it is, of your labor.  <span
id="fr_197"></span>[198](#fn_197) Farewell.

<span id="v-p12"></span>Geneva, 1*st August* 1546.
