<span id="i-p1"></span>CHAPTER 15

<span id="i.i"></span>

<span id="i.i-p1"></span><span id="i.i-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
15:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001.md)<span id="i.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="i.i-p2"></span>**1.** Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you
the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and
wherein ye stand;

<span id="i.i-p3"></span>**1.** Notum autem vobis facio, fratres,
evangelium quod evangelizavi vobis, quod et recepistis, in quo etiam
stetistis.

<span id="i.i-p4"></span>**2.** By which also ye are saved, if ye keep
in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain:

<span id="i.i-p5"></span>**2.** Per quod etiam salutem habetis: quo
pacto annuntiarim vobis, si tenetis, nisi frustra credidistis.

<span id="i.i-p6"></span>**3.** For I delivered unto you first of all
that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according
to the scriptures;

<span id="i.i-p7"></span>**3.** Tradidi enim vobis imprimis quod et
acceperam, quod Christus mortuus fuerit, pro peccatis nostris secundum
Scripturas,

<span id="i.i-p8"></span>**4.** And that he was buried, and that he rose
again the third day according to the scriptures:

<span id="i.i-p9"></span>**4.** Et quod sepultus sit, et quod resurrexit
tertio die, secundum Scripturas.

<span id="i.i-p10"></span>**5.** And that he was seen of Cephas, then of
the twelve:

<span id="i.i-p11"></span>**5.** Et quod visus fait Cephae, deinde ipsis
duodecim:

<span id="i.i-p12"></span>**6.** After that, he was seen of above five
hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this
present, but some are fallen asleep.

<span id="i.i-p13"></span>**6.** Postea visus fait plus quam qaingentis
fratribus simul, ex quibus plures manent  <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) adhuc ad hunc usque diem: qaidam autem
obdormierunt.

<span id="i.i-p15"></span>**7.** After that, he was seen of James; then
of all the apostles.

<span id="i.i-p16"></span>**7.** Deinde visus fait Iacobo: post
apostolis omnibus:

<span id="i.i-p17"></span>**8.** And last of all he was seen of me also,
as of one born out of due time.

<span id="i.i-p18"></span>**8.** Postremo vero onmium, velut abortivo,
visus fait et mihi.

<span id="i.i-p19"></span>**9.** For I am the least of the apostles,
that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the
church of God.

<span id="i.i-p20"></span>**9.** Ego enim sum minimus apostolorum, qui
non sum idoneus ut dicar apostolus: quandoquidem persequutus sum
ecclesiam Dei.

<span id="i.i-p21"></span>**10.** But by the grace of God I am what I
am: and his grace which *was bestowed* upon me was not in vain; but I
laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God
which was with me.

<span id="i.i-p22"></span>**10.** Sed gratia Dei sum id quod sum: et
gratia ejus, quae mihi collata est, non fuit inanis, sed copiosius quam
illi omnes laboravi: non ego tamen, sed gratia Dei quae mihi aderat.

<span id="i.i-p23"></span> 

<span id="i.i-p24"></span><span id="i.i-p24.1"></span>

<span id="i.i-p25"></span>**1.** *Now I make known to you.* He now
enters on another subject — the resurrection — the belief of which among
the Corinthians had been shaken by some wicked persons. It is uncertain,
however, whether they doubted merely as to the ultimate resurrection of
the body, or as to the immortality of the soul also. It is abundantly
well known, that there were a variety of errors as to this point. Some
philosophers contended that souls are immortal. As to the resurrection
of the body, it never entered into the mind of any one of them. The
Sadducees, however, had grosser views; for they thought of nothing but
the present life; nay more, they thought that the soul of man was a
breath of wind without substance. It is not, therefore, altogether
certain (as I have already said) whether the Corinthians had at this
time gone to such a height of madness, as to cast off all expectation of
a future life, or whether they merely denied the resurrection of the
body; for the arguments which Paul makes use of seem to imply, that they
were altogether bewitched with the mad dream of the Sadducees.

<span id="i.i-p26"></span>For example, when he says,

<span id="i.i-p27"></span>Of what advantage is it to be baptized for the
dead?  
(<span id="i.i-p27.2"></span>[1Co
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#029)<span id="i.i-p27.2"></span>..md)

<span id="i.i-p28"></span>Were it not better to eat and to drink?  
(<span id="i.i-p28.2"></span>[1Co
15:32](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032)<span id="i.i-p28.2"></span>..md)

<span id="i.i-p29"></span>Why are we in peril every hour? (<span
id="i.i-p29.1"></span>[1Co 15:30](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#030.md)<span
id="i.i-p29.1"></span>,)

<span id="i.i-p30"></span>and the like, it might very readily be
replied, in accordance with the views of the philosophers, “Because
after death the soul survives the body.” Hence some apply the whole of
Paul’s reasoning contained in this chapter to the immortality of the
soul. For my part, while I leave undetermined what the error of the
Corinthians was, yet I cannot bring myself to view Paul’s words as
referring to anything else than the resurrection of the body. Let it,
therefore be regarded as a settled point, that it is of this exclusively
that he treats in this chapter. And what if the impiety of Hymeneus and
Philetus had extended thus far,  <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) who
said that *the resurrection was already past,* (<span
id="i.i-p31.2"></span>[2Ti 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018.md)<span
id="i.i-p31.2"></span>,) and that there would be nothing more of it?
Similar to these, there are at the present day some madmen, or rather
devils,  <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) who call themselves
Libertines.  <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md) To me, however, the
following conjecture appears more probable — that they were carried away
by some delusion,  <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md) which took away
from them the hope of a future resurrection, just as those in the
present day, by imagining an allegorical resurrection,  <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md) take away from us the true resurrection that
is promised to us.

<span id="i.i-p36"></span>However this may be, it is truly a dreadful
case, and next to a prodigy, that those who had been instructed by so
distinguished a master, should have been capable of falling so quickly
 <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) into errors of so gross a nature. But
what is there that is surprising in this, when in the Israelitish Church
the Sadducees had the audacity to declare openly that man differs
nothing from a brute, in so far as concerns the essence of the soul, and
has no enjoyment but what is common to him with the beasts? Let us
observe, however, that blindness of this kind is a just judgment from
God, so that those who do not rest satisfied with the truth of God, are
tossed hither and thither by the delusions of Satan.

<span id="i.i-p38"></span>It is asked, however, why it is that he has
left off or deferred to the close of the Epistle, what should properly
have had the precedence of everything else? Some reply, that this was
done for the purpose of impressing it more deeply upon the memory. I am
rather of opinion that Paul did not wish to introduce a subject of such
importance, until he had asserted his authority, which had been
considerably lessened among the Corinthians, and until he had, by
repressing their pride, prepared them for listening to him with
docility.

<span id="i.i-p39"></span>*I make known to you.* To *make known* here
does not mean to teach what was previously unknown to them, but to
recall to their recollection what they had heard previously. “Call to
your recollection, along with me, that gospel which you had learned,
before you were led aside from the right course.” He calls the doctrine
of the resurrection *the* *gospel,* that they may not imagine that any
one is at liberty to form any opinion that he chooses on this point, as
on other questions, which bring with them no injury to salvation.

<span id="i.i-p40"></span>When he adds, *which I preached to you,* he
amplifies what he had said: *“If* you acknowledge me as an apostle, I
have assuredly taught you so.” There is another amplification in the
words — *which also ye have received,* for if they now allow themselves
to be persuaded of the contrary, they will be chargeable with
fickleness. A *third* amplification is to this effect, that they had
hitherto continued in that belief with a firm and steady resolution,
which is somewhat more than that they had once believed. But the most
important thing of all is, that he declares that their salvation is
involved in this, for it follows from this, that, if the resurrection is
taken away, they have no religion left them, no assurance of faith, and
in short, have no faith remaining. Others understand in another sense
the word *stand,* as meaning that they are *upheld;* but the
interpretation that I have given is a more correct one.  <span
id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md)

<span id="i.i-p42"></span><span id="i.i-p42.1"></span>

<span id="i.i-p43"></span>**2.** *If you keep in memory* — *unless in
vain*  <span id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) These two expressions are very
cutting. In the *first,* he reproves their carelessness or fickleness,
because such a sudden fall was an evidence that they had never
understood what had been delivered to them, or that their knowledge of
it had been loose and floating, inasmuch as it had so quickly vanished.
By the *second,* he warns them that they had needlessly and uselessly
professed allegiance to Christ, if they did not hold fast this main
doctrine.  <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md)

<span id="i.i-p46"></span><span id="i.i-p46.1"></span>

<span id="i.i-p47"></span>**3.** *For I delivered to you first of all*
He now confirms what he had previously stated, by explaining that the
resurrection had been preached by him, and that too as a fundamental
doctrine of the gospel. *First of all,* says he, as it is wont to be
with a foundation in the erecting of a house. At the same time he adds
to the authority of his preaching, when he subjoins, that he *delivered*
nothing but *what he had received,* for he does not simply mean that he
related what he had from the report of others, but that it was what had
been enjoined upon him by the Lord.  <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) For the word  <span
id="fr_11"></span>[12](#fn_11.md) must be explained in accordance with the
connection of the passage. Now it is the duty of an apostle to bring
forward nothing but what he *has received from the Lord,* so as from
hand to hand  <span id="fr_12"></span>[13](#fn_12) (as they say.md) to
administer to the Church the pure word of God.

<span id="i.i-p51"></span>*That Christ died, etc*. See now more clearly
whence he received it, for he quotes *the Scriptures* in proof. In the
first place, he makes mention of the death of Christ, nay also of his
burial, that we may infer, that, as he was like us in these things, he
is so also in his resurrection. He has, therefore, died with us that we
may rise with him. In his burial, too, the reality of the death in which
he has taken part with us, is made more clearly apparent. Now there are
many passages of Scripture in which Christ’s death and *resurrection*
are predicted, but nowhere more plainly  <span
id="fr_13"></span>[14](#fn_13.md) than in <span id="i.i-p52.2"></span>[Isa
53](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#000.md)<span id="i.i-p52.2"></span>, in
<span id="i.i-p52.3"></span>[Da
9:26](../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026.md)<span id="i.i-p52.3"></span>, and
in <span id="i.i-p52.4"></span>[Ps
22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#000.md)<span id="i.i-p52.4"></span>

<span id="i.i-p53"></span>*For our sins* That is, that by taking our
curse upon him he might redeem us from it. For what else was Christ’s
death, but a sacrifice for expiating our sins — what but a satisfactory
penalty, by which we might be reconciled to God — what but the
condemnation of one, for the purpose of obtaining forgiveness for us? He
speaks also in the same manner in <span id="i.i-p53.1"></span>[Ro
4:25](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025.md)<span id="i.i-p53.1"></span>, but
in that passage, on the other hand, he ascribes it also to the
resurrection as its effect — that it confers righteousness upon us; for
as sin was done away through the death of Christ, so righteousness is
procured through his resurrection. This distinction must be carefully
*observed,* that we may know what we must look for from the death of
Christ, and what from his resurrection. When, however, the Scripture in
other places makes mention only of his death, let us understand that in
those cases his *resurrection* is included in his death, but when they
are mentioned separately, the commencement of our salvation is (as we
see) in the one, and the consummation of it in the other.

<span id="i.i-p54"></span><span id="i.i-p54.1"></span>

<span id="i.i-p55"></span>**5.** *That he was seen by Cephas* He now
brings forward *eye* *witnesses, (*<span
id="i.i-p55.1"></span>αὐτόπτας*)* as they are called by Luke, (<span
id="i.i-p55.2"></span>[Lu 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002.md)<span
id="i.i-p55.2"></span>,) who saw the accomplishment of what the
Scriptures had foretold would take place. He does not, however, adduce
them all, for he makes no mention of women. When, therefore, he says
that he appeared first to Peter, you are to understand by this that he
is put before all the *men,* so that there is nothing inconsistent with
this in the statement of Mark (<span id="i.i-p55.3"></span>[Mr
16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009)<span id="i.i-p55.3"></span>.md) that
*he appeared to Mary.*

<span id="i.i-p56"></span>But how is it that he says, that *he appeared
to the twelve,* when, after the death of Judas, there were only eleven
remaining? Chrysostom is of opinion that this took place after Matthias
had been chosen in his room. Others have chosen rather to correct the
expression, looking upon it as a mistake  <span
id="fr_14"></span>[15](#fn_14.md) But as we know, that there were *twelve*
in number that were set apart by Christ’s appointment, though one of
them had been expunged from the roll, there is no absurdity in supposing
that the name was retained. On this principle, there was a body of men
at Rome that were called <span id="i.i-p57.6"></span>Centumviri,  <span
id="fr_15"></span>[16](#fn_15.md) while they were in number 102.  <span
id="fr_16"></span>[17](#fn_16.md) By *the twelve,* therefore, you are
simply to understand the chosen Apostles.

<span id="i.i-p60"></span>It does not quite appear *when* it was that
this *appearing to more than five hundred* took place. Only it is
possible that this large multitude assembled at Jerusalem, when he
manifested himself to them. For Luke (<span id="i.i-p60.1"></span>[Lu
24:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#033)<span id="i.i-p60.1"></span>.md)
makes mention in a general way of the disciples who had assembled with
the eleven; but how many there were he does not say. Chrysostom refers
it to the ascension, and explains the word <span
id="i.i-p60.2"></span>ἐπάνω to mean, *from on high.*  <span
id="fr_17"></span>[18](#fn_17.md) Unquestionably, as to what he says in
reference to his having appeared to James apart, this may have been
subsequently to the ascension.

<span id="i.i-p62"></span>By *all the Apostles* I understand not merely
the *twelve,* but also those disciples to whom Christ had assigned the
office of preaching the gospel.  <span id="fr_18"></span>[19](#fn_18.md) In
proportion as our Lord was desirous that there should be many witnesses
of his resurrection, and that it should be frequently testified of, let
us know that it should be so much the more *surely believed among us.*
(<span id="i.i-p63.2"></span>[Lu
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001)<span id="i.i-p63.2"></span>..md)
Farther, inasmuch as the Apostle proves the resurrection of Christ from
the fact that he appeared to many, he intimates by this, that it was not
figurative but true and natural, for the eyes of the body cannot be
witnesses of a spiritual resurrection.

<span id="i.i-p64"></span><span id="i.i-p64.1"></span>

<span id="i.i-p65"></span>**8.** *Last of all to me, as to one born
prematurely,* He now introduces himself along with the others, for
Christ had manifested himself to him as alive, and invested with glory.
 <span id="fr_19"></span>[20](#fn_19.md) As it was no deceptive vision, it
was calculated to be of use  <span id="fr_20"></span>[21](#fn_20.md) for
establishing a belief in the resurrection, as he also makes use of this
argument in <span id="i.i-p67.2"></span>[Ac
26:8](../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#008.md)<span id="i.i-p67.2"></span>. But
as it was of no small importance that his authority should have the
greatest weight and influence among the Corinthians, he introduces, by
the way, a commendation of himself personally, but at the same time
qualified in such a manner that, while he claims much for himself, he is
at the same time exceedingly modest. Lest any one, therefore, should
meet him with the objection: “Who art thou that we should give credit to
thee?” he, of his own accord, confesses his unworthiness, and, in the
first place, indeed he compares himself to one that is *born
prematurely,* and that, in my opinion, with reference to his sudden
conversion. For as infants do not come forth from the womb, until they
have been there formed and matured during a regular course of time, so
the Lord observed a regular period of time in creating, nourishing, and
forming his Apostles. Paul, on the other hand, had been cast forth from
the womb when he had scarcely received the vital spark.  <span
id="fr_21"></span>[22](#fn_21.md) There are some that understand the term
rendered *abortive* as employed to mean *posthumous;*  <span
id="fr_22"></span>[23](#fn_22.md) but the former term is much more
suitable, inasmuch as he was in one moment begotten, and born, and a man
of full age. Now this premature birth renders the grace of God more
illustrious in Paul than if he had by little and little, and by
*successive* steps, grown up to maturity in Christ.

<span id="i.i-p70"></span><span id="i.i-p70.1"></span>

<span id="i.i-p71"></span>**9.** *For I am the least* It is not certain
whether his enemies threw out this for the purpose of detracting from
his credit, or whether it was entirely of his own accord, that he made
the *acknowledgment.* For my part, while I have no doubt that, he was at
all times voluntarily, and even cheerfully, disposed to abase himself,
that he might magnify the grace of God, yet I suspect that in this
instance he wished to obviate calumnies. For that there were some at
Corinth that made it their aim to detract from his dignity by malicious
slander, may be inferred not only from many foregoing passages, but also
from his adding a little afterwards a comparison, which he would
assuredly never have touched upon, if he had not been constrained to it
by the wickedness of some, “Detract from me as much as you please — I
shall suffer myself to be cast down below the ground — I shall suffer
myself to be of no account whatever,  <span
id="fr_23"></span>[24](#fn_23.md) that the goodness of God towards me may
shine forth the more. Let me, therefore, be reckoned the *least of the
Apostles:* nay more, I acknowledge myself to be unworthy of this
distinction. For by what merits could I have attained to that honor?
When *I persecuted the Church of God,* what did I merit? But there is no
reason why you should judge of me according to my own worth,  <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md) for the Lord did not look to what I was,
but made me by his grace quite another man.” The sum is this, that Paul
does not refuse to be the most worthless of all, and next to nothing,
provided this contempt does not impede him in any degree in his
ministry, and does not at all detract from his doctrine. He is contented
that, as to himself, he shall be reckoned unworthy of any honor,
provided only he commends his apostleship in respect of the *grace
conferred upon him.* And assuredly God had not adorned him with such
distinguished endowments in order that his grace might lie buried or
neglected, but he had designed thereby to render his apostleship
illustrious and distinguished.

<span id="i.i-p74"></span><span id="i.i-p74.1"></span>

<span id="i.i-p75"></span>**10.** *And his grace was not vain.* Those
that set free-will in opposition to the grace of God, that whatever good
we do may not be ascribed wholly to Him, wrest these words to suit their
own interpretation — as if Paul boasted, that he had by his own industry
taken care that God’s grace toward him had not been misdirected. Hence
they infer, that God, indeed, offers his grace, but that the right use
of it is in man’s own power, and that it is in his own power to prevent
its being ineffectual. I maintain, however, that these words of Paul
give no support to their error, for he does not here claim anything as
his own, as if he had himself, independently of God, done anything
praiseworthy. What then? That he might not seem to glory to no purpose
in mere words, while devoid of reality, he says, that he affirms nothing
that is not openly apparent. Farther, even admitting that these words
intimate, that Paul did not abuse the grace of God, and did not render
it ineffectual by his negligence, I maintain, nevertheless, that there
is no reason on that account, why we should divide between him and God
the praise, that ought to be ascribed wholly to God, inasmuch as he
confers upon us not merely the power of doing well, but also the
inclination and the accomplishment.

<span id="i.i-p76"></span>*But more abundantly* Some refer this to
vain-glorious boasters,  <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md) who, by
detracting from Paul, endeavored to set off themselves and their goods
to advantage, as, in their opinion at least, it is not likely that he
wished to enter upon a contest with the Apostles. When he compares
himself, however, with the Apostles, he does so merely for the sake of
those wicked persons, who were accustomed to bring them forward for the
purpose of detracting from his reputation, as we see in the Epistle to
the Galatians (<span id="i.i-p77.3"></span>[Ga
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011)<span id="i.i-p77.3"></span>..md)
Hence the probability is, that it is of the Apostles that he speaks,
when he represents his own labors as superior to theirs, and it is quite
true, that he was superior to others, not merely in respect of his
enduring many hardships, encountering many dangers, abstaining from
things lawful, and perseveringly despising all *perils;* (<span
id="i.i-p77.4"></span>[2Co 11:26](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#026.md)<span
id="i.i-p77.4"></span>;) but also because the Lord gave to his labors a
much larger measure of success.  <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md)
For I take *labor* here to mean the fruit of his labor that appeared.

<span id="i.i-p79"></span>*Not I, but the grace* The old translator, by
leaving out the article, has given occasion of mistake to those that are
not acquainted with the Greek language, for in consequence of his having
rendered the words thus — *not I, but the grace of God with me,*  <span
id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md) they thought that only the half of the
praise is ascribed to God, and that the other half is reserved for man.
They, accordingly, understand the meaning to be that Paul labored not
alone, inasmuch as he could do nothing without co-operating grace,
 <span id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md) but at the same time it was under
the influence of his own free-will, and by means of his own strength.
His words, however, have quite a different meaning, for what he had said
was his own, he afterwards, correcting himself, ascribes wholly to the
grace of God — *wholly,* I say, not in part, for whatever he might have
seemed to do, was *wholly,* he declares, the work of grace. A remarkable
passage certainly, both for laying low the pride of man, and for
magnifying the operation of Divine grace in us. For Paul, as though he
had improperly made himself the author of anything good, corrects what
he had said, and declares the *grace of God* to have been the efficient
cause of the whole. Let us not think that there is here a mere pretense
of humility  <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md) It is in good earnest
that he speaks thus, and from knowing that it is so in truth. Let us
learn, therefore, that we have nothing that is good, but what the Lord
has graciously given us, that we do nothing good but what he *worketh in
us,* (<span id="i.i-p82.5"></span>[Php
2:13](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#013)<span id="i.i-p82.5"></span>.md) —
not that we do nothing ourselves, but that we do nothing without being
influenced — that is, under the guidance and impulse of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="i.ii"></span>

<span id="i.ii-p1"></span><span id="i.ii-p1.1"></span>[1 Corinthians
15:11-19](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#011.md)<span id="i.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="i.ii-p2"></span>**11.** Therefore whether *it were* I or they,
so we preach, and so ye believed.

<span id="i.ii-p3"></span>**11.** Sire ego igitur, sive illi, ita
praedicamus, et ita credidistis.

<span id="i.ii-p4"></span>**12.** Now if Christ be preached that he rose
from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of
the dead?

<span id="i.ii-p5"></span>**12.** Si autem Christus praedicatur
excitatus a mortuis, quomodo dicunt quidam, mortuorum resurrectionem non
esse?

<span id="i.ii-p6"></span>**13.** But if there be no resurrection of the
dead, then is Christ not risen:

<span id="i.ii-p7"></span>**13.** Si autem mortuorum resur-rectionon
est, neque Christus resurrexit.

<span id="i.ii-p8"></span>**14.** And if Christ be not risen, then *is*
our preaching vain, and your faith *is* also vain.

<span id="i.ii-p9"></span>**14.** Quodsi Christus non resurrexit, inanis
igitur est praedicatio nostra, inanis et fides vestra.

<span id="i.ii-p10"></span>**15.** Yea, and we are found false witnesses
of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom
he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.

<span id="i.ii-p11"></span>**15.** Invenimur etiam falsi testes Dei,
quia testati sumus a Deo, quod suscitaverit Christum; quem non
suscitavit, siquidem mortui non resurgunt.

<span id="i.ii-p12"></span>**16.** For if the dead rise not, then is not
Christ raised:

<span id="i.ii-p13"></span>**16.** Si enim mortui non resurgunt, neque
Christus resurrexit.

<span id="i.ii-p14"></span>**17.** And if Christ be not raised, your
faith *is* vain; ye are yet in your sins.

<span id="i.ii-p15"></span>**17.** Si autem Christus non resurrexit,
vana est fides vestra: adhuc estis in peccatis vestris.

<span id="i.ii-p16"></span>**18.** Then they also which are fallen
asleep in Christ are perished.

<span id="i.ii-p17"></span>**18.** Ergo et qui obdormierunt in Christo
perierunt.

<span id="i.ii-p18"></span>**19.** If in this life only we have hope in
Christ, we are of all men most miserable.

<span id="i.ii-p19"></span>**19.** Quodsi in hac vita solum speramus in
Christo, miserrimi sumus omnium hominum.

<span id="i.ii-p20"></span> 

<span id="i.ii-p21"></span><span id="i.ii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="i.ii-p22"></span>**11.** *Whether I or they* Having compared
himself with the other Apostles, he now associates himself with them,
and them with him, in agreement as to their preaching. “I do not now
speak of myself, but we have all taught so with one mouth, and still
continue to teach so.” For the verb <span
id="i.ii-p22.1"></span>κηρύσσομεν *(we preach)* is in the present tense
— intimating a continued act, or perseverance in teaching.  <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md) “If, then, it is otherwise, our
apostleship is void: nay more — *so ye believed:* your religion,
therefore, goes for nothing.”

<span id="i.ii-p24"></span><span id="i.ii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="i.ii-p25"></span>**12.** *But of Christ.* He now begins to
prove the resurrection of all of us from that of Christ. For a mutual
and reciprocal inference holds good on the one side and on the other,
both affirmatively and negatively — from Christ to us in this way: *If
Christ is risen, then we will rise* — *If Christ is not risen, then we
will not rise* — from us to Christ on the other hand: *If we rise, then
Christ is risen* — *If we do not rise, then neither is Christ risen.*
The ground-work of the argument to be drawn from Christ to us in the
former inference is this: “Christ did not die, or rise again for
himself, but for us: hence his resurrection is the foundation.  <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md) of ours, and what was accomplished in
him, must be fulfilled in us also.” In the negative form, on the other
hand, it is thus: “Otherwise he would have risen again needlessly and to
no purpose, because the fruit of it is to be sought, not in his own
person, but in his members.”

<span id="i.ii-p27"></span>Observe the ground-work, on the other hand,
of the former *inference* to be deduced from us to him; for the
resurrection is not from nature, and comes from no other quarter than
from Christ alone. For in Adam we die, and we recover life only in
Christ; *hence* it follows that his *resurrection* is the foundation of
ours, so that if *that* is taken away, it cannot stand  <span
id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md) The ground-work of the negative
*inference* has been already stated; for as he could not have risen
again but on our account, his resurrection would be null and void,
 <span id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md) if it were of no advantage to us.

<span id="i.ii-p30"></span><span id="i.ii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="i.ii-p31"></span>**14.** *Then is our preaching vain* — not
simply as having some mixture of falsehood, but as being altogether an
empty fallacy. For what remains if Christ has been swallowed up by death
— if he has become extinct — if he has been overwhelmed by the curse of
sin — if, in fine, he has been overcome by Satan? In short, if that
fundamental article is subverted, all that remains will be of no moment.
For the same reason he adds, that their *faith will be vain,* for what
solidity of faith will there be, where no hope of life is to be seen?
But in the death of Christ, considered in itself,  <span
id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md) there is seen nothing but ground of
despair, for he cannot be the author of salvation to others, who has
been altogether vanquished by death. Let us therefore bear in mind, that
the entire gospel consists mainly in the death and resurrection of
Christ, so that we must direct our chief attention to this, if we would
desire, in a right and orderly manner, to make progress in the gospel —
nay more, if we would not remain *barren and unfruitful.* (<span
id="i.ii-p32.2"></span>[2Pe 1:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#008.md)<span
id="i.ii-p32.2"></span>.)

<span id="i.ii-p33"></span><span id="i.ii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="i.ii-p34"></span>**15.** *We are also found to be false
witnesses.* The other disadvantages, it is true, which he has just now
recounted, were more serious, as regards us — that *faith was made vain*
— that the whole doctrine of the gospel was useless and worthless, and
that we were bereft of all hope of salvation. Yet this also was no
trivial absurdity — that the Apostles, who were ordained by God to be
the heralds of his eternal truth, were detected as persons who had
deceived the world with falsehoods; for this tends to God’s highest
dishonor.

<span id="i.ii-p35"></span>The expression, *false witnesses of God,* we
may understand in two ways — either that by *lying* they used the name
of God under a false pretext, or that they were detected as *liars,* in
testifying what they had received from God. The *second* of these I
rather prefer, because it involves a crime that is much more heinous,
and he had spoken previously as to men.  <span
id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md) Now, therefore, he teaches that, if the
resurrection of Christ is denied, God is made guilty of falsehood in the
witnesses that have been brought forward and hired by him.  <span
id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36.md) The reason, too, that is added,
corresponds well — because they had declared what was false, not as from
themselves, but from God.

<span id="i.ii-p38"></span>I am at the same time well aware that there
are some that give another rendering to the particle <span
id="i.ii-p38.1"></span>κατα The old interpreter renders it *against.*
 <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37.md) Erasmus, on the other hand —
*concerning.*  <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38.md) But, as it has also
among the Greeks the force of <span id="i.ii-p40.4"></span>ἀπό, (from,)
this signification appeared to me to be more in accordance with the
Apostle’s design. For he is not speaking here of the reputation of men,
(as I have already stated,  <span id="fr_39"></span>[40](#fn_39) .md) but
he declares that God will be exposed to the charge of falsehood,
inasmuch as what they publish has come forth from him.

<span id="i.ii-p42"></span><span id="i.ii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="i.ii-p43"></span>**17.** *Ye are yet in your sins* For
although Christ by his death atoned for our sins, that they might no
more be imputed to us in the judgment of God, and has

<span id="i.ii-p44"></span>crucified our old man, that its lusts might
no longer reign in us, (<span id="i.ii-p44.1"></span>[Rom.
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md),
[12](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#012)<span id="i.ii-p44.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="i.ii-p45"></span>and, in fine, has

<span id="i.ii-p46"></span>by death destroyed the power of death, and
the devil himself, (<span id="i.ii-p46.1"></span>[Heb
2:14](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#014)<span id="i.ii-p46.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="i.ii-p47"></span>yet there would have been none of all these
things, if he had not, by rising again, come off victorious. Hence, if
the resurrection is overthrown, the dominion of sin is set up anew.

<span id="i.ii-p48"></span><span id="i.ii-p48.1"></span>

<span id="i.ii-p49"></span>**18.** *Then they who are fallen asleep.*
Having it in view to prove, that if the resurrection of Christ is taken
away, faith is useless, and Christianity  <span
id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md) is a mere deception, he had said that the
*living* remain in their sins; but as there is a clearer illustration of
this matter to be seen in the *dead,* he adduces them as an example.
*“Of* what advantage were it to the dead that they once were Christians?
Hence our brethren who are now dead, did to no purpose live in the faith
of Christ.” But if it is granted that the essence of the soul is
immortal, this argument appears, at first sight, conclusive; for it will
very readily be replied, that the dead have not *perished,* inasmuch as
their souls live in a state of separation from their bodies. Hence some
fanatics conclude that there is no life in the period intermediate
between death and the resurrection; but this frenzy is easily refuted.
 <span id="fr_41"></span>[42](#fn_41.md) For although the souls of the dead
are now living, and enjoy quiet repose, yet the whole of their felicity
and consolation depends exclusively on the resurrection; because it is
well with them on this account, and no other, that they wait for that
day, on which they shall be called to the possession of the kingdom of
God. Hence as to the hope of the dead, all is over, unless that day
shall sooner or later arrive.

<span id="i.ii-p52"></span><span id="i.ii-p52.1"></span>

<span id="i.ii-p53"></span>**19.** *But if in this life* Here is another
absurdity — that we do not merely by believing lose our time and pains,
inasmuch as the fruit of it perishes at our death, but it were better
for us not to believe; for the condition of unbelievers were preferable,
and more to be desired. To *believe in this life* means here to limit
the fruit of our faith to this life, so that our faith looks no farther,
and does not extend beyond the confines of the present life. This
statement shows more clearly that the Corinthians had been imposed upon
by some mistaken fancy of a figurative resurrection, such as Hymeneus
and Philetus, as though the last fruit of our faith were set before us
in this life. (<span id="i.ii-p53.1"></span>[2 Tim.
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017.md),
[18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018)<span id="i.ii-p53.1"></span>..md) For
as the resurrection is the completion of our salvation, and as to all
blessings is, as it were, the farthest goal,  <span
id="fr_42"></span>[43](#fn_42.md) the man who says that our resurrection is
already past, leaves us nothing better to hope for after death. However
this may be, this passage gives at all events no countenance to the
frenzy of those who imagine that the soul sleeps as well as the body,
until the day of the *resurrection.*  <span
id="fr_43"></span>[44](#fn_43.md) They bring forward, it is true, this
objection — that if the soul continued to live when separated from the
body, Paul would not have said that, if the resurrection were taken
away, we would *have hope only in this life,* inasmuch as there would
still be some felicity remaining for the soul. To this, however, I
reply, that Paul did not dream of Elysian fields,  <span
id="fr_44"></span>[45](#fn_44.md) and foolish fables of that sort, but
takes it for granted, that the entire hope of Christians looks forward
to the final day of judgment — that pious souls do even at this day rest
in the same expectation, and that, consequently, we are bereft of
everything, if a confidence of this nature deceives us.

<span id="i.ii-p57"></span>But why does he say that we *would be the
most miserable of all men,* as if the lot of the Christian were worse
than that of the wicked? For *all things,* says Solomon, *happen alike
to the good and to the bad.* (<span id="i.ii-p57.1"></span>[Ec
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#002)<span id="i.ii-p57.1"></span>..md) I
answer, that all men, it is true, whether good or bad, are liable to
distresses in common, and they feel in common the same inconveniences,
and the same miseries; but there are two reasons why Christians have in
all ages fared worse, in addition to which, there was one that was
peculiar to the times of Paul. The *first* is, that while the Lord
frequently chastises the wicked, too, with his lashes, and begins to
inflict his judgments upon them, he at the same time peculiarly afflicts
his own in various ways; — in the *first* place, because he *chastises
those whom he loves,* (<span id="i.ii-p57.2"></span>[Heb
12:6](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006)<span id="i.ii-p57.2"></span>;.md)
and *secondly,* in order that he may train them to patience, that he may
try their obedience, and that he may gradually prepare them by the cross
for a true renovation. However it may be as to this, that statement
always holds good in the case of believers *It is time, that judgment
should begin at the house of God.* (<span id="i.ii-p57.3"></span>[Jer
25:29](../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029.md)<span id="i.ii-p57.3"></span>;
<span id="i.ii-p57.4"></span>[1Pe
4:17](../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017.md)<span id="i.ii-p57.4"></span>
 <span id="fr_45"></span>[46](#fn_45) .md) Again,

<span id="i.ii-p59"></span>we are reckoned as sheep appointed for
slaughter.  
(<span id="i.ii-p59.2"></span>[Ps
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022)<span id="i.ii-p59.2"></span>..md)

<span id="i.ii-p60"></span>Again,

<span id="i.ii-p61"></span>ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ
in God.  
(<span id="i.ii-p61.2"></span>[Col
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003)<span id="i.ii-p61.2"></span>..md)

<span id="i.ii-p62"></span>Meanwhile, the condition of the wicked is for
the most part the more desirable, because the Lord feeds them up, as
hogs for the day of slaughter.

<span id="i.ii-p63"></span>The *second* reason is, that believers, even
though they should abound in riches and in blessings of every kind, they
nevertheless do not go to excess, and do not gormandize at their ease;
in fine, they do not enjoy the world, as unbelievers do, but go forward
with anxiety, constantly *groaning,* (<span id="i.ii-p63.1"></span>[2Co
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002)<span id="i.ii-p63.1"></span>,.md)
partly from a consciousness of their weakness, and partly from an eager
longing for the future life. Unbelievers, on the other hand, are wholly
intent on intoxicating themselves with present delights.  <span
id="fr_46"></span>[47](#fn_46.md)

<span id="i.ii-p65"></span>The *third* reason, which was peculiar, as I
have said, to the age of the Apostle, is — that at that time the name of
*Christians* was so odious and abominable, that no one could then take
upon himself the name of Christ without exposing his life to imminent
peril. It is, therefore, not without good reason that he says that
Christians would be *the most miserable of all men*, if their confidence
were confined to this world.

<span id="i.iii-p21"></span><span id="i.iii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="i.iii-p22"></span>**20.** *But now hath Christ risen.* Having
shown what dreadful confusion as to everything would follow, if we were
to deny that the dead rise again, he now again assumes as certain, what
he had sufficiently established previously — that *Christ has risen;*
and he adds that he is the *first-fruits,*  <span
id="fr_47"></span>[48](#fn_47.md) by a similitude taken, as it appears,
from the ancient ritual of the law. For as in the *first-fruits* the
produce of the entire year was consecrated, so the power of Christ’s
resurrection is extended to all of us — unless you prefer to take it in
a more simple way — that in him the first fruit of the resurrection was
gathered. I rather prefer, however, to understand the statement in this
sense — that the rest of the dead will follow him, as the entire harvest
does the *first-fruits;*  <span id="fr_48"></span>[49](#fn_48.md) and this
is confirmed by the succeeding statement.

<span id="i.iii-p25"></span><span id="i.iii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="i.iii-p26"></span>**21.** *Since by man came death* The point
to be proved is, that Christ is the *first-fruits,* and that it was not
merely as an individual that he was raised up from the dead. He proves
it from contraries, because death is not from nature, but from man’s
sin. As, therefore, Adam did not die for himself alone, but for us all,
it follows, that Christ in like manner, who is the antitype,  <span
id="fr_49"></span>[50](#fn_49.md) did not rise for himself alone; for he
came, that he might restore everything that had been ruined in Adam.

<span id="i.iii-p28"></span>We must observe, however, the force of the
argument; for he does not contend by similitude, or by example, but has
recourse to opposite causes for the purpose of proving opposite effects.
The cause of death is Adam, and we die in him: hence Christ, whose
office it is to restore to us what we lost in Adam, is the cause of life
to us; and his resurrection is the ground-work and pledge of ours. And
as the former was the beginning of death, so the latter is of life. In
the fifth chapter of the Romans (<span id="i.iii-p28.1"></span>[Ro
5](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#000)<span id="i.iii-p28.1"></span>.md) he
follows out the same comparison; but there is this difference, that in
that passage he reasons respecting a spiritual life and death, while he
treats here of the resurrection of the body, which is the fruit of
spiritual life.

<span id="i.iii-p29"></span><span id="i.iii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="i.iii-p30"></span>**23.** *Every one in his own order.* Here
we have an anticipation of a question that might be proposed: *“If*
Christ’s life,” some one might say, “draws ours along with it, why does
not this appear? Instead of this, while Christ has risen from the grave,
we lie rotting there.” Paul’s answer is, that God has appointed another
order of things. Let us therefore reckon it enough, that we now have in
Christ the *first-fruits,*  <span id="fr_50"></span>[51](#fn_50.md) and
that his coming  <span id="fr_51"></span>[52](#fn_51.md) will be the time
of our resurrection. For *our life* must still be *hid with him,*
because he has not yet *appeared.* (<span id="i.iii-p32.2"></span>[Col.
3:3](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#003.md),
[4](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004)<span id="i.iii-p32.2"></span>..md) It
would therefore be preposterous to wish to anticipate that day of the
revelation of Christ.

<span id="i.iii-p33"></span><span id="i.iii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="i.iii-p34"></span>**24.** *Then cometh the end, when he shall
have delivered. He* put a bridle upon the impatience of men, when he
forewarned them, that the fit time for the new life  <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md) would not be before Christ’s coming. But
as this world is like a stormy sea, in which we are continually tossed,
and our condition is so uncertain, or rather is so full of troubles, and
there are in all things such sudden changes, this might be apt to
trouble weak minds. Hence he now leads them forward to that day, saying
that all things will be set in order. *Then,* therefore, shall come
*the* end — that is, the goal of our course — a quiet harbour — a
condition that will no longer be exposed to changes; and he at the same
time admonishes us, that that *end* must be waited for, because it is
not befitting that we should be crowned in the middle of the course. In
what respect Christ will *deliver up the kingdom to the Father,* will be
explained in a little. When he says, *God and the Father,* this may be
taken in two senses — either that God the Father is called the God and
Father of Christ, or that the name of *Father* is added by way of
explanation. The conjunction <span id="i.iii-p35.2"></span>*et* *(and)*
will in the *latter* case mean *namely.* As to the *former*
signification, there is nothing either absurd, or unusual, in the
saying, that Christ is inferior to God, in respect of his human nature.

<span id="i.iii-p36"></span>*When he shall have abolished all rule.*
Some understand this as referring to the powers that are opposed to
Christ himself; for they have an eye to what immediately follows, *until
he shall have put all his enemies, etc.* This clause, however,
corresponds with what goes before, when he said, that Christ would not
sooner *deliver up the kingdom* Hence there is no reason why we should
restrict in such a manner the statement before us. I explain it,
accordingly, in a general way, and understand by it — all powers that
are lawful and *ordained by God.* (<span id="i.iii-p36.1"></span>[Ro
13:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001)<span id="i.iii-p36.1"></span>..md)
In the *first* place, what we find in the Prophets (<span
id="i.iii-p36.2"></span>[Isa
13:10](../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010.md)<span id="i.iii-p36.2"></span>;
<span id="i.iii-p36.3"></span>[Eze
32:7](../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007)<span id="i.iii-p36.3"></span>.md) as
to the darkening of the sun and moon, that God alone may shine forth,
while it has begun to be fulfilled under the reign of Christ, will,
nevertheless, not be fully accomplished until the last day; but then
*every height shall be brought low,* (<span id="i.iii-p36.4"></span>[Lu
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005)<span id="i.iii-p36.4"></span>,.md)
that the glory of God may alone shine forth. Farther, we know that all
earthly principalities and honors are connected exclusively with the
keeping up of the present life, and, consequently, are a part of the
world. Hence it follows that they are temporary.

<span id="i.iii-p37"></span>Hence as the world will have an end, so also
will government, and magistracy, and laws, and distinctions of ranks,
and different orders of dignities, and everything of that nature. There
will be no more any distinction between servant and master, between king
and peasant, between magistrate and private citizen. Nay more, there
will be then an end put to angelic principalities in heaven, and to
ministries and superiorities in the Church, that God may exercise his
power and dominion by himself alone, and not by the hands of men or
angels. The angels, it is true, will continue to exist, and they will
also retain their distinction. The righteous, too, will shine forth,
every one according to the measure of his grace; but the angels will
have to resign the dominion, which they now exercise in the name and by
the commandment of God. Bishops, teachers, and Prophets will cease to
hold these distinctions, and will resign the office which they now
discharge. *Rule*, and *authority,* and *power* have much the same
meaning in this passage; but these three terms are conjoined to bring
out the meaning more fully.

<span id="i.iii-p38"></span><span id="i.iii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="i.iii-p39"></span>**25.** *For he must reign* He proves that
the time is not yet come when Christ will *deliver up the kingdom to the
Father,* with the view of showing at the same time that the *end* has
not yet come, when all things will be put into a right and tranquil
state, because Christ has not yet subdued all his enemies. Now that
*must* be brought about, *because* the Father has placed him at his
right hand with this understanding, that he is not to resign the
authority that he has received, until they have been subdued under his
power. And this is said for the consolation of the pious, that they may
not be impatient on account of the long delay of the resurrection. This
statement occurs in <span id="i.iii-p39.1"></span>[Ps
110:1](../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001.md)<span id="i.iii-p39.1"></span>

<span id="i.iii-p40"></span>Paul, however, may seem to refine upon the
word *until* beyond what the simple and natural meaning of the word
requires; for the Spirit does not in that passage give intimation of
what shall be afterwards, but simply of what must be previously. I
answer, that Paul does not conclude that Christ will *deliver up the
kingdom to the Father,* on the ground of its having been so predicted in
the Psalm, but he has made use of this quotation from the Psalm, for the
purpose of proving that the day of *delivering up the kingdom* had not
yet arrived, because Christ has still to do with his enemies. Paul,
however, explains in passing what is meant by Christ’s sitting at the
right hand of the Father, when in place of that figurative expression he
makes use of the simple word *reign.*

<span id="i.iii-p41"></span>*The last enemy* — *death* We see that there
are still many enemies that resist Christ, and obstinately oppose his
reign. But *death* will be *the last enemy*  <span
id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md) *that will be destroyed.* Hence Christ
must still be the administrator of his Father’s kingdom. Let believers,
therefore, be of good courage, and not give up hope, until everything
that must precede the resurrection be accomplished. It is asked,
however, in what sense he affirms that death shall be the *last enemy*
 <span id="fr_54"></span>[55](#fn_54.md) *that will be destroyed,* when it
has been already destroyed by Christ’s death, or at least, by his
resurrection, which is the victory over death, and the attainment of
life? I answer, that it was *destroyed* in such a way as to be no longer
deadly to believers, but not in such a way as to occasion them no
uneasiness. The Spirit of God, it is true, dwelling in us is life; but
we still carry about with us a mortal body. (<span
id="i.iii-p43.2"></span>[1Pe 1:24](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024.md)<span
id="i.iii-p43.2"></span>.) The substance of death in us will one day be
drained off, but it has not been so as yet. We are *born again of
incorruptible seed,* (<span id="i.iii-p43.3"></span>[1Pe
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023)<span id="i.iii-p43.3"></span>,.md)
but we have not yet arrived at perfection. Or to sum up the matter
briefly in a similitude, the sword of death which could penetrate into
our very hearts has been blunted. It wounds nevertheless still, but
without any danger;  <span id="fr_55"></span>[56](#fn_55.md) for we die,
but by dying we enter into life. In fine, as Paul teaches elsewhere as
to sin, (<span id="i.iii-p44.2"></span>[Ro
6:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#012)<span id="i.iii-p44.2"></span>,.md)
such must be our view as to death — that *it dwells* indeed in us, but
it does not *reign*

<span id="i.iii-p45"></span><span id="i.iii-p45.1"></span>

<span id="i.iii-p46"></span>**27.** *He hath put all things under his
feet* Some think that this quotation is taken from <span
id="i.iii-p46.1"></span>[Ps 8:6](../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006.md)<span
id="i.iii-p46.1"></span>*,* and I have no objection to this, though
there would be nothing out of place in reckoning this statement to be an
inference that is drawn by Paul from the nature of Christ’s kingdom. Let
us follow, however, the more generally received opinion. Paul shows from
that Psalm, that God the Father has conferred upon Christ the power of
all things, because it is said, *Thou hast put all things under his
feet* The words are in themselves plain, were it not that there are two
difficulties that present *themselves* — *first,* that the Prophet
speaks here not of Christ alone, but of the whole human race; and
*secondly,* that by *all things* he means only those things that have to
do with the convenience of the life of the body, as we find in <span
id="i.iii-p46.2"></span>[Ge 2:19](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019.md)<span
id="i.iii-p46.2"></span>. The solution of the former difficulty is easy;
for as Christ is the *first-born of every creature,* (<span
id="i.iii-p46.3"></span>[Col 1:15](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015.md)<span
id="i.iii-p46.3"></span>,) and the *heir of all things,* (<span
id="i.iii-p46.4"></span>[Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md)<span
id="i.iii-p46.4"></span>,) God, the Father, has not conferred upon the
human race the use of all creatures in such a way as to hinder that in
the mean time the chief power, and, so to speak, the rightful dominion,
remain in Christ’s hands. Farther, we know, that Adam lost the right
that had been conferred upon him, so that we can no longer call anything
our own. For the *earth was cursed,* (<span id="i.iii-p46.5"></span>[Ge
3:17](../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017)<span id="i.iii-p46.5"></span>,.md)
and everything that it contains; and it is through Christ alone that we
recover what has been taken from us.  <span
id="fr_56"></span>[57](#fn_56.md) It is with propriety, therefore, that
this commendation belongs to Christ personally — that the Father has
*put all things under his feet,* inasmuch as we rightfully possess
nothing except in him. For how shall we become heirs of God, if we are
not his sons, and by whom are we made his sons but by Christ.

<span id="i.iii-p48"></span>The solution of the *second* difficulty is
as follows — that the Prophet, it is true, especially mentions *fowls of
heaven, fishes of the sea,* and *beasts of the field,* because this kind
of dominion is visible, and is more apparent to the eye; but at the same
time the general statement reaches much farther — to the heavens and the
earth, and everything that they contain. Now the subjection must have a
corrrespondence with the character of him who rules — that is, it has a
suitableness to his condition, so as to correspond with it. Now Christ
does not need animals for food, or other creatures for any necessity. He
rules, therefore, that all things may be subservient to his glory,
inasmuch as he adopts us as participants in his dominion. The fruit of
this openly appears in visible creatures; but believers feel in their
consciences an inward fruit, which, as I have said, extends farther.

<span id="i.iii-p49"></span>*All things put under him, except him who
put all things under him.* He insists upon two things — *first,* that
all things must be brought under subjection to Christ before he restores
to the Father the dominion of the world, and *secondly,* that the Father
has given all things into the hands of his Son in such a way as to
retain the principal right in his own hands. From the *former* of these
it follows, that the hour of the last judgment is not yet come — from
the *second,* that Christ is now the medium between us and the Father in
such a way as to bring us at length to him. Hence he immediately infers
as follows: *After he shall have subjected all things to him, then shall
the Son subject himself to the Father.* “Let us wait patiently until
Christ shall vanquish all his enemies, and shall bring us, along with
himself, under the dominion of God, that the kingdom of God may in every
respect be accomplished in *us.*”

<span id="i.iii-p50"></span>This statement, however, is at first view at
variance with what we read in various passages of Scripture respecting
the eternity of Christ’s kingdom. For how will these things correspond —
Of *his kingdom there will be no end,* (<span
id="i.iii-p50.1"></span>[Dan. 7:14](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014.md),
[27](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027.md)<span id="i.iii-p50.1"></span>;
<span id="i.iii-p50.2"></span>[Lu
1:33](../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#033.md)<span id="i.iii-p50.2"></span>;
<span id="i.iii-p50.3"></span>[2Pe
1:11](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#011)<span id="i.iii-p50.3"></span>,.md)
and *He himself shall be subjected?* The solution of this question will
open up Paul’s meaning more clearly. In the *first* place, it must be
observed, that all power was delivered over to Christ, inasmuch as he
was manifested in the flesh. It is true that such distinguished majesty
would not correspond with a mere man, but, notwithstanding, *the Father
has exalted him* in the same nature in which he was abased, and has

<span id="i.iii-p51"></span>given, him a name, before which every knee
must bow, etc. (<span id="i.iii-p51.1"></span>[Phil.
2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010)<span id="i.iii-p51.1"></span>..md)

<span id="i.iii-p52"></span>Farther, it must be observed, that he has
been appointed Lord and highest King, so as to be as it were the
Father’s Vicegerent in the government of the world — not that he is
employed and the Father unemployed (for how could that be, inasmuch as
he is the wisdom and counsel of the Father, is of one essence with him,
and is therefore himself God?) But the reason why the Scripture
testifies, that Christ now holds dominion over the heaven and the earth
in the room of the Father is — that we may not think that there is any
other governor, lord, protector, or judge of the dead and living, but
may fix our contemplation on him alone.  <span
id="fr_57"></span>[58](#fn_57.md) We acknowledge, it is true, God as the
ruler, but it is in the face of the man Christ. But Christ will then
restore the kingdom which he has received, that we may cleave wholly to
God.  <span id="fr_58"></span>[59](#fn_58.md) Nor will he in this way
resign the kingdom, but will transfer it in a manner from his humanity
to his glorious divinity, because a way of approach will then be opened
up, from which our infirmity now keeps us back. Thus then Christ will be
*subjected to the Father,* because the vail being then removed, we shall
openly behold God reigning in his majesty,  <span
id="fr_59"></span>[60](#fn_59.md) and Christ’s humanity will then no longer
be interposed to keep us back from a closer view of God.  <span
id="fr_60"></span>[61](#fn_60.md)

<span id="i.iii-p57"></span><span id="i.iii-p57.1"></span>

<span id="i.iii-p58"></span>**28.** *That God may be all in all* Will it
be so in the Devil and wicked men also? By no means — unless perhaps we
choose to take the verb to be as meaning, *to* *be known, and openly
beheld.* In that case the meaning will be: *“For* the present, as the
Devil resists God, as wicked men confound and disturb the order which he
has established, and as endless occasions of offense present themselves
to our view, it does not distinctly appear that *God is all in all;* but
when Christ will have executed the judgment which has been committed to
him by the Father, and will have cast down Satan and all the wicked, the
glory of God will be conspicuous in their destruction. The same thing
may be said also respecting powers that are sacred and lawful in their
kind, for they in a manner hinder God’s being seen aright by us in
himself. Then, on the other hand, God, holding the government of the
heaven and the earth by himself, and without any medium, will in that
respect be *all,* and will consequently at last be so, not only in all
persons, but also in all creatures.”

<span id="i.iii-p59"></span>This is a pious interpretation,  <span
id="fr_61"></span>[62](#fn_61.md) and, as it corresponds sufficiently well
with the Apostle’s design, I willingly embrace it. There would, however,
be nothing out of place in understanding it as referring exclusively to
believers, in whom God has now begun his kingdom, and will then perfect
it, and in such a way that they shall cleave to him wholly. Both
meanings sufficiently refute of themselves the wicked frenzies of some
who bring forward this passage in proof of them. Some imagine, that God
will be *all in all* in this respect, that all things will vanish and
dissolve into nothing. Paul’s words, however, mean nothing but this,
that all things will be brought back to God, as their alone beginning
and end, that they may be closely bound to him. Others infer from this
that the Devil and all the wicked will be saved — as if God would not
altogether be better known in the Devil’s destruction, than if he were
to associate the Devil with himself, and make him one with himself. We
see then, how impudently madmen of this sort wrest this statement of
Paul for maintaining their blasphemies.

<span id="i.iv-p15"></span><span id="i.iv-p15.1"></span>

<span id="i.iv-p16"></span>**29.** *Else what shall they do* He resumes
his enumeration of the absurdities, which follow from the error under
which the Corinthians labored. He had set himself in the outset to do
this, but he introduced instruction and consolation, by means of which
he interrupted in some degree the thread of his discourse. To this he
now returns. In the first place he brings forward this objection — that
the baptism which those received who are already regarded as dead, will
be of no avail if there is no resurrection. Before expounding this
passage, it is of importance to set aside the common exposition, which
rests upon the authority of the ancients, and is received with almost
universal consent. Chrysostom, therefore, and Ambrose, who are followed
by others, are of opinion  <span id="fr_62"></span>[63](#fn_62.md) that the
Corinthians were accustomed, when any one had been deprived of baptism
by sudden death, to substitute some living person in the place of the
deceased — to be baptized at his grave. They at the same time do not
deny that this custom was corrupt, and full of superstition, but they
say that Paul, for the purpose of confuting the Corinthians, was
contented with this single fact,  <span id="fr_63"></span>[64](#fn_63.md)
that while they denied that there was a resurrection, they in the mean
time declared in this way that they believed in it. For my part,
however, I cannot by any means be persuaded to believe this,  <span
id="fr_64"></span>[65](#fn_64.md) for it is not to be credited, that those
who denied that there was a resurrection had, along with others, made
use of a custom of this sort. Paul then would have had immediately this
reply made to him: “Why do you trouble us with that old wives’
superstition, which you do not yourself approve of?” Farther, if they
had made use of it, they might very readily have replied: “If this has
been hitherto practiced by us through mistake, rather let the mistake be
corrected, than that it should have weight attached to it for proving a
point of such importance.”

<span id="i.iv-p20"></span>Granting, however, that the argument was
conclusive, can we suppose that, if such a corruption as this had
prevailed among the Corinthians, the Apostle, after reproving almost all
their faults, would have been silent as to this one? He has censured
above some practices that are not of so great moment. He has not
scrupled to give directions as to women’s having the head covered, and
other things of that nature. Their corrupt administration of the Supper
he has not merely reproved, but has inveighed against it with the
greatest keenness. Would he in the meantime have uttered not a single
word in reference to such a base profanation of baptism, which was a
much more grievous fault? He has inveighed with great vehemence against
those who, by frequenting the banquets of the Gentiles, silently
countenanced their superstitions. Would he have suffered this horrible
superstition of the Gentiles to be openly carried on in the Church
itself under the name of sacred baptism? But granting that he might have
been silent, what shall we say when he expressly makes mention of it? Is
it, I pray you, a likely thing that the Apostle would bring forward in
the shape of an argument a sacrilege  <span
id="fr_65"></span>[66](#fn_65.md) by which baptism was polluted, and
converted into a mere magical abuse, and yet not say even one word in
condemnation of the fault? When he is treating of matters that are not
of the highest importance, he introduces nevertheless this parenthesis,
that he *speaks as a man.* (<span id="i.iv-p21.2"></span>[Ro
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005.md)<span id="i.iv-p21.2"></span>;
<span id="i.iv-p21.3"></span>[Ro
6:19](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019.md)<span id="i.iv-p21.3"></span>;
<span id="i.iv-p21.4"></span>[Ga
3:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015)<span id="i.iv-p21.4"></span>..md)
Would not this have been a more befitting and suitable place for such a
parenthesis? Now from his making mention of such a thing without any
word of reproof, who would not understand it to be a thing that was
allowed? For my part, I assuredly understand him to speak here of the
right use of baptism, and not of an abuse of it of that nature.

<span id="i.iv-p22"></span>Let us now inquire as to the meaning. At one
time I was of opinion, that Paul here pointed out the universal design
of baptism, for the advantage of baptism is not confined to this life;
but on considering the words afterwards with greater care, I perceived
that Paul here points out something peculiar. For he does not speak of
all when he says, *What shall they do, who are baptized*? *etc.*
Besides, I am not fond of interpretations, that are more ingenious than
solid. What then? I say, that those are *baptized for dead,* who are
looked upon as already dead, and who have altogether despaired of life;
and in this way the particle <span id="i.iv-p22.1"></span>ὑπέρ will have
the force of the Latin <span id="i.iv-p22.2"></span>*pro,* as when we
say, <span id="i.iv-p22.3"></span>*habere pro derelicto;* — *to reckon
as abandoned*  <span id="fr_66"></span>[67](#fn_66.md) This signification
is not a forced one. Or if you would prefer another signification, to be
*baptized for the dead* will mean — to be baptized so as to profit the
dead — not the living,  <span id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md) Now it is
well known, that from the very commencement of the Church, those who
had, while yet catechumens,  <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md) fallen
into disease,  <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md) if their life was
manifestly in danger, were accustomed to ask baptism, that they might
not leave this world before they had made a profession of Christianity;
and this, in order that they might carry with them the seal of their
salvation.

<span id="i.iv-p27"></span>It appears from the writings of the Fathers,
that as to this matter, also, there crept in afterwards a superstition,
for they inveigh against those who delayed baptism till the time of
their death, that, being once for all purged from all their sins, they
might in this state meet the judgment of God.  <span
id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md) A gross error truly, which proceeded
partly from great ignorance, and partly from hypocrisy! Paul, however,
here simply mentions a custom that was sacred, and in accordance with
the Divine institution — that if a catechumen, who had already in his
heart embraced the Christian faith,  <span
id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md) saw that death was impending over him, he
asked baptism, partly for his own consolation, and partly with a view to
the edification of his brethren. For it is no small *consolation to*
carry the token of his salvation sealed in his body. There is also an
*edification,* not to be lost sight of — that of making a confession of
his faith. They were, then, *baptized for the dead,* inasmuch as it
could not be of any service to them in this world, and the very occasion
of their asking baptism was that they despaired of life. We now see that
it is not without good reason that Paul asks, *what they would do* if
there remained no hope after death?  <span
id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md) This passage shows us, too, that those
impostors who had disturbed the faith of the Corinthians, had contrived
a figurative resurrection, making the farthest goal of believers to be
in this world, His repeating it a second time, *Why are they also
baptized for the dead?* gives it greater emphasis: “Not only are those
baptized who think that they are to live longer, but those too who have
death before their eyes; and that, in order that they may in death reap
the fruit of their baptism.”

<span id="i.iv-p31"></span><span id="i.iv-p31.1"></span>

<span id="i.iv-p32"></span>**30.** *Why are we also? “If* our
resurrection and ultimate felicity are in this world, why do we of our
own accord abandon it, and voluntarily encounter death?” The argument
might also be unfolded in this manner: “To no purpose would we *stand in
peril every hour,* if we did not look for a better life, after death has
been passed through.” He speaks, however, of voluntary dangers, to which
believers expose their lives for the purpose of confessing Christ. “This
magnanimity of soul, I say, in despising death, would be ascribed to
rashness rather than firmness, if the saints perished at death, for it
is a diabolical madness to purchase by death an immortal fame.”  <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md)

<span id="i.iv-p34"></span><span id="i.iv-p34.1"></span>

<span id="i.iv-p35"></span>**31.** *I die daily* Such a contempt of
death he declares to be in himself, that he may not seem to talk bravely
when beyond the reach of danger. *“I* am every *day,”* says he,
“incessantly beset with death. What madness were it in me to undergo so
much misery, if there were no reward in reserve for me in heaven? Nay
more, if my glory and bliss lie in this world, why do I not rather
*enjoy* them, than of my own accord *resign* them?” He says that he
*dies daily,* because he was constantly beset with dangers so formidable
and so imminent, that death in a manner was impending over him. A
similar expression occurs in <span id="i.iv-p35.1"></span>[Ps
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md)<span id="i.iv-p35.1"></span>,
and we shall, also, find one of the same kind occurring in the second
Epistle. (<span id="i.iv-p35.2"></span>[2Co
11:23](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#023)<span id="i.iv-p35.2"></span>..md)

<span id="i.iv-p36"></span>*By our glory.* The old translation reads
*propter, (because* of,)  <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md) but it
has manifestly arisen from the ignorance of transcribers; for in the
Greek particle  <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) there is no
ambiguity. It is then an oath, by which he wished to arouse the
Corinthians, to be more attentive in listening to him, when reasoning as
to the matter in hand.  <span id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md)
*“Brethren,* I am not some philosopher prattling in the shade.  <span
id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) As I expose myself every day to death, it
is necessary that I should think in good earnest of the heavenly life.
Believe, therefore, a man who is thoroughly experienced.”

<span id="i.iv-p41"></span>It is also a form of oath that is not common,
but is suited to the subject in hand. Corresponding to this was that
celebrated oath of Demosthenes, which is quoted by Fabius,  <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md) when he swore by the Shades of those who
had met death in the field of Marathon, while his object was to exhort
them to defend the Republic.  <span id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) So in
like manner Paul here swears by *the glory which Christians have in
Christ.* Now that glory is in heaven. He shows, then, that what they
called in question was a matter of which he was so well assured, that he
was prepared to make use of a sacred oath — a display of skill which
must be carefully noticed.

<span id="i.iv-p44"></span><span id="i.iv-p44.1"></span>

<span id="i.iv-p45"></span>**32.** *If according to the manner of men*
He brings forward a notable instance of death, from which it might be
clearly seen that he would have been worse than a fool, if there were
not a better life in reserve for us beyond death; for it was an
ignominious kind of death to which he was exposed. “To what purpose were
it,” says he, “for me to incur infamy in connection with a most cruel
death, if all my hopes were confined to this world?” *According to the
manner of men,* means in this passage, *in respect of human life, so
that we obtain a reward in this world.*

<span id="i.iv-p46"></span>Now by those that *fought with beasts,* are
meant, not those that were thrown to wild beasts, as Erasmus mistakingly
imagined, but those that were condemned to be set to fight with wild
beasts — to furnish an amusement to the people. There were, then, two
kinds of punishment, that were totally different — to be thrown to wild
beasts, and to fight with wild beasts. For those that were thrown to
wild beasts were straightway torn in pieces; but those that fought with
wild beasts went forth armed into the arena, that if they were endued
with strength, courage, and agility, they might effect their escape by
dispatching the wild beasts. Nay more, there was a game in which those
who fought with wild beasts were trained, like the gladiators  <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md) Usually, however, very few escaped,
because the man who had dispatched one wild beast, was required to fight
with a second,  <span id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) until the cruelty
of the spectators was satiated, or rather was melted into pity; and yet
there were found men so abandoned and *desperate,* as to hire themselves
out for this!  <span id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) And this, I may
remark by the way, is that kind of *hunting* that is punished so
severely by the ancient canons, as even civil laws brand it with a mark
of infamy.  <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md)

<span id="i.iv-p51"></span>I return to Paul.  <span
id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md) We see what an extremity God allowed his
servant to come to, and how wonderfully, too, he rescued him. Luke,
 <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) however, makes no mention of this
*fight.* Hence we may infer that he endured many things that have not
been committed to writing.

<span id="i.iv-p54"></span>*Let us eat and drink* This is a saying of
the Epicureans, who reckon man’s highest good as consisting in present
enjoyment. Isaiah also testifies that it is a saying made use of by
profligate persons, (<span id="i.iv-p54.2"></span>[Isa
22:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013)<span id="i.iv-p54.2"></span>,.md)
who, when the Prophets of God threaten them with ruin,  <span
id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) with the view of calling them to
repentance, making sport of those threatenings, encourage themselves in
wantonness and unbridled mirth, and in order to show more openly their
obstinacy, say, “Since die we must, let us meanwhile enjoy the time, and
not torment ourselves before the time with empty fears.” As to what a
certain General said to his army,  <span id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md)
“My fellowsoldiers, let us dine heartily, for we shall sup to-day in the
regions below,”  <span id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) that was an
exhortation to meet death with intrepidity, and has nothing to do with
this subject. I am of opinion, that Paul made use of a jest in common
use among abandoned and desperately wicked persons, or (to express it
shortly) a common proverb among the Epicureans to the following purpose:
“If death is the end of man, there is nothing better than that he should
indulge in pleasure, free from care, so long as life lasts.” Sentiments
of this kind are to be met with frequently in Horace.  <span
id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md)

<span id="i.iv-p63"></span><span id="i.iv-p63.1"></span>

<span id="i.iv-p64"></span>**33.** *Be not deceived. Evil communications
corrupt good manners* As nothing is easier than to glide into profane
speculation, under the pretext of inquiring,  <span
id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) he meets this danger, by warning them
that *evil communications* have more effect than we might suppose, in
polluting our minds and corrupting our morals.  <span
id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) To show this, he makes use of a quotation
from the poet Menander,  <span id="fr_92"></span>[93](#fn_92.md) as we are
at liberty to borrow from every quarter everything that has come forth
from God. And as all truth is from God, there is no doubt that the Lord
has put into the mouth of the wicked themselves, whatever contains true
and salutary doctrine. I prefer, however, that, for the handling of this
subject, recourse should be had to Basil’s Oration to the Young. Paul,
then, being aware that this proverb was in common use among the Greeks,
chose rather to make use of it, that it might make its way into their
minds more readily, than to express the same thing in his own words. For
they would more readily receive what they had been accustomed to — as we
have *experience* of in proverbs with which we are familiar.

<span id="i.iv-p68"></span>Now it is a sentiment that is particularly
worthy of attention, for Satan, when he cannot make a direct assault
upon us,  <span id="fr_93"></span>[94](#fn_93.md) deludes us under this
pretext, that there is nothing wrong in our raising any kind of
disputation with a view to the investigation of truth. Here, therefore,
Paul in opposition to this, warns us that we must guard against *evil
communications,* as we would against the most deadly poison, *because,*
insinuating themselves secretly into our minds, they straightway corrupt
our whole life. Let us, then, take notice, that nothing is more
pestilential than corrupt doctrine and profane disputations, which draw
us off, even in the smallest degree, from a right and simple faith;
 <span id="fr_94"></span>[95](#fn_94.md) for it is not without good reason
that Paul exhorts us not to be *deceived.*  <span
id="fr_95"></span>[96](#fn_95.md)

<span id="i.iv-p72"></span><span id="i.iv-p72.1"></span>

<span id="i.iv-p73"></span>**34.** *Awake righteously* As he saw that
the Corinthians were in a manner intoxicated,  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[97](#fn_96.md) through excessive carelessness, he
arouses them from their torpor. By adding, however, the adverb
*righteously,* he intimates in what way he would have them *wake up* For
they were sufficiently attentive and clear-sighted as to their own
affairs: nay more, there can be no doubt that they congratulated
themselves on their acuteness; but in the mean time they were drowsy,
where they ought most of all to have been on the watch. He says
accordingly, *awake righteously* — that is, *“Direct* your mind and aim
to things that are good and holy.”

<span id="i.iv-p75"></span>He adds at the same time the reason, — *For
some,* says he, *among you are in ignorance of God* This required to be
stated: otherwise they might have thought that the admonition was
unnecessary; for they looked upon themselves as marvellously wise. Now
he convicts them of *ignorance of God,* that they may know that the main
thing was wanting in them. A useful admonition to those who lay out all
their agility in flying through the air, while in the mean time they do
not see what is before their feet, and are stupid where they ought, most
of all, to have been clear-sighted.

<span id="i.iv-p76"></span>*To your shame* Just as fathers, when
reproving their children for their faults, put them to shame, in order
that they may by that shame cover their shame. When, however, he
declared previously that he did not wish to shame them, (<span
id="i.iv-p76.1"></span>[1Co 4:14](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#014.md)<span
id="i.iv-p76.1"></span>,) his meaning was that he did not wish to hold
them up to disgrace, by bringing forward their faults to public view in
a spirit of enmity and hatred.  <span id="fr_97"></span>[98](#fn_97.md) In
the mean time, however, it was of advantage for them to be sharply
reproved, as they were still indulging themselves in evils of such
magnitude. Now Paul in reproaching them with *ignorance of God,* strips
them entirely of all honor.

<span id="i.v-p36"></span><span id="i.v-p36.1"></span>

<span id="i.v-p37"></span>**35.** *How will they be raised up?* There is
nothing that is more at variance with human reason than this article of
faith. For who but God alone could persuade us that bodies, which are
now liable to corruption, will, after having rotted away, or after they
have been consumed by fire, or torn in pieces by wild beasts, will not
merely be restored entire, but in a greatly better condition. Do not all
our apprehensions of things straightway reject this as a thing fabulous,
nay, most absurd?  <span id="fr_99"></span>[100](#fn_99.md) Paul, with the
view of removing entirely this appearance of absurdity, makes use of an
*anhypophora,*  <span id="fr_100"></span>[101](#fn_100.md) that is, he
brings forward by way of objection, in the person of another, what
appears at first view to be at variance with the doctrine of a
resurrection. For this question is not that of one who inquires
doubtingly as to the mode, but of one who argues from impossibility —
that is, what is said as to the resurrection is a thing incredible.
Hence in his reply he repels such an objection with severity. Let us
observe, then, that the persons who are here introduced as speaking, are
those who endeavor to disparage, in a way of scoffing, a belief in the
resurrection, on the ground of its being a thing that is impossible.

<span id="i.v-p40"></span><span id="i.v-p40.1"></span>

<span id="i.v-p41"></span>**36.** *Thou fool, that which thou sowest*
The Apostle might have replied, that the mode, which is to us
incomprehensible, is nevertheless easy with God. Hence, we must not here
form our judgment according to our own understanding, but must assign to
the stupendous and secret power of God the honor of believing, that it
will accomplish what we cannot comprehend. He goes to work, however, in
another way. For he shows, that the resurrection is so far from being
against nature, that we have every day a clear illustration of it in the
course of nature itself — in the growth of the fruits of the earth. For
from what but from rottenness spring the fruits that we gather out of
the earth? For when the seed has been sown, unless the grains *die,*
there will be no increase. Corruption, then, being the commencement and
cause of production, we have in this a sort of picture of the
resurrection. Hence it follows, that we are beyond measure spiteful and
ungrateful in estimating the power of God, if we take from him what is
already manifest before our eyes.

<span id="i.v-p42"></span><span id="i.v-p42.1"></span>

<span id="i.v-p43"></span>**37.** *Thou sowest not that body that will
spring up.* This comparison consists of two *parts* — *first,* that it
is not to be wondered that bodies rise from rottenness, inasmuch as the
same thing takes place as to seed; and *secondly,* that it is not at
variance with reason, that our bodies should be restored in another
condition, since, from bare grain, God brings forth so many ears of
corn, clothed with admirable contrivance, and stored with grains of
superior quality. As, however, he might seem to intimate, by speaking in
this way, that many bodies will therefore rise out of one, he modifies
his discourse in another way, by saying that God *forms the body as it
pleases him,* meaning that in that also there is a difference in respect
of quality.

<span id="i.v-p44"></span>He adds, *to every seed its own body* By this
clause he restricts what he had said respecting another body; for he
says that, while the body is different, it is in such a way as to
retain, nevertheless, its particular kind.

<span id="i.v-p45"></span><span id="i.v-p45.1"></span>

<span id="i.v-p46"></span>**39.** *All flesh is not, etc*. Here we have
another comparison leading to the same conclusion, though there are some
that explain it otherwise. For when he says, that under the name of
*flesh* is comprehended the body of a man as well as of a beast, and yet
the *flesh* in those two cases is different, he means by this that the
substance indeed is the same, but there is a difference as to quality.
The sum is this — that whatever diversity we see in any particular kind
is a sort of prelude of the resurrection, because God clearly shows,
that it is no difficult thing with him to renew our bodies by changing
the present condition of things.  <span
id="fr_101"></span>[102](#fn_101.md)

<span id="i.v-p48"></span><span id="i.v-p48.1"></span>

<span id="i.v-p49"></span>**41.** *There is one glory of the sun, and
another glory of the moon* Not only is there a difference between
heavenly bodies and earthly, but even the heavenly bodies have not all
the same glory; for the sun surpasses the moon, and the other stars
differ from each other. This dissimilarity, accordingly, appears  <span
id="fr_102"></span>[103](#fn_102.md) in the *resurrection* of the dead. A
mistake, however, is commonly fallen into in the application;  <span
id="fr_103"></span>[104](#fn_103.md) for it is supposed that Paul meant to
say, that, after the resurrection, the saints will have different
degrees of honor and glory. This, indeed, is perfectly true, and is
proved by other declarations of Scripture; but it has nothing to do with
Paul’s object. For he is not arguing as to what difference of condition
there will be among the saints after the resurrection, but in what
respect our bodies at present differ from those that we will one day
receive.  <span id="fr_104"></span>[105](#fn_104.md)

<span id="i.v-p53"></span>He removes, then, every idea of absurdity, by
instituting this comparison: The substance of the sun and moon is the
same, but there is a great difference between them in point of dignity
and excellence. Is it to be wondered, then, if our body puts on a more
excellent quality?  <span id="fr_105"></span>[106](#fn_105.md) “I do not
teach that anything will take place at the resurrection but what is
already presented before the eyes of all.” That such is the meaning of
the words is clear from the context. For whence and for what purpose
would Paul make such a transition, were he now comparing them with one
another in respect of the difference of their condition, while up to
this point he has been comparing the present condition of all with their
future condition, and immediately proceeds with that comparison?

<span id="i.v-p55"></span><span id="i.v-p55.1"></span>

<span id="i.v-p56"></span>**43.** *It is sown in corruption* That there
may be no doubt remaining, Paul explains himself, by unfolding the
difference between their present condition, and that which will be after
the resurrection. What connection, then, would there be in his
discourse, if he had intended in the first instance  <span
id="fr_106"></span>[107](#fn_106.md) to distinguish between the different
degrees of future glory among the saints? There can, therefore, be no
doubt, that he has been, up to this point, following out one subject. He
now returns to the first similitude that he had made use of, but applies
it more closely to his design. Or, if you prefer it, keeping up that
similitude, he figuratively compares the time of the present life to the
seed-time, and the resurrection to the harvest; and he says, that our
body is now, indeed, subject to mortality and ignominy, but will then be
glorious and incorruptible. He says the same thing in other words in
<span id="i.v-p57.2"></span>[Php
3:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021.md)<span id="i.v-p57.2"></span>

<span id="i.v-p58"></span>Christ will change our vile body,  
that he may make it like to his own glorious body.

<span id="i.v-p59"></span><span id="i.v-p59.1"></span>

<span id="i.v-p60"></span>**44.** *It is sown an animal body.* As he
could not express *each* particular by enumerating one by one, he sums
up all *comprehensively* in one word, by saying that the body is now
*animal,*  <span id="fr_107"></span>[108](#fn_107.md) but it will then be
*spiritual.* Now that is called *animal* which is quickened by *(*<span
id="i.v-p61.8"></span>*anima)* the soul: that is *spiritual* which is
quickened by the *Spirit.*  <span id="fr_108"></span>[109](#fn_108.md) Now
it is the soul that quickens the body, so as to keep it from being a
dead carcase. Hence it takes its title very properly from it. After the
resurrection, on the other hand, that quickening influence, which it
will receive from the Spirit, will be more excellent.  <span
id="fr_109"></span>[110](#fn_109.md) Let us, however, always bear in mind,
what we have seen previously — that the substance of the body is the
same,  <span id="fr_110"></span>[111](#fn_110.md) and that it is the
quality only that is here treated of. Let the present quality of the
body be called, for the sake of greater plainness, *animation;*  <span
id="fr_111"></span>[112](#fn_111.md) let the future receive the name of
*inspiration.* For as to the soul’s now *quickening* the body, that is
effected through the intervention of many helps; for we stand in need of
drink, food, clothing, sleep, and other things of a similar nature.
Hence the weakness of *animation* is clearly manifested. The energy of
the Spirit, on the other hand, for *quickening,* will be much more
complete, and, consequently, exempted from necessities of that nature.
This is the simple and genuine meaning of the Apostle; that no one may,
by philosophizing farther, indulge in airy speculations, as those do,
who suppose that the substance of the body will be spiritual, while
there is no mention made here of substance, and no change will be made
upon it.

<span id="i.v-p66"></span><span id="i.v-p66.1"></span>

<span id="i.v-p67"></span>**45.** *As it is written, The first Adam was
made* Lest it should seem to be some new contrivance as to the *animal
body,*  <span id="fr_112"></span>[113](#fn_112.md) he quotes Scripture,
which declares that Adam *became a living soul,* (<span
id="i.v-p68.2"></span>[Ge 2:7](../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007.md)<span
id="i.v-p68.2"></span>) — meaning, that his body was quickened by the
soul, so that he became a living man. It is asked, what is the meaning
of the word *soul* here? It is well known, that the Hebrew word <span
id="i.v-p68.3"></span>נפש, *(nephesh,)* which Moses makes use of, is
taken in a variety of senses; but in this passage it is taken to mean
either vital motion, or the *very* *essence* of life itself. The second
of these I rather prefer. I observe that the same thing is affirmed as
to beasts — that they were made *a living soul,* (<span
id="i.v-p68.4"></span>[Gen. 1:20](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#020.md),
[24](../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024)<span id="i.v-p68.4"></span>;.md) but
as the soul of every animal must be judged of according to its kind,
there is nothing to hinder that a *soul,* that is to say, vital motion,
may be common to all; and yet at the same time the *soul* of man may
have something peculiar and distinguishing, namely, immortal *essence,*
as the light of intelligence and reason.

<span id="i.v-p69"></span>*The last Adam.* This expression we do not
find anywhere *written.*  <span id="fr_113"></span>[114](#fn_113.md) Hence
the phrase, *It is written,* must be understood as referring exclusively
to the first clause; but after bringing forward this testimony of
Scripture, the Apostle now begins in his own person to draw a contrast
between Christ and Adam. *“Moses* relates that Adam was furnished with a
*living soul;* Christ, on the other hand, is endowed with a *life-giving
Spirit.* Now it is a much greater thing to be *life,* or the *source of
life,* than simply to *live.”*  <span id="fr_114"></span>[115](#fn_114.md)
It must be observed, however, that Christ did also, like us, become a
*living soul;* but, besides the *soul,* the Spirit of the Lord was also
poured-out upon him, that by his power he might rise again from the
dead, and raise up others, This, therefore, must be observed, in order
that no one may imagine, (as Apollinaris  <span
id="fr_115"></span>[116](#fn_115) did of old,.md) that the Spirit was in
Christ in place of a soul. And independently of this, the interpretation
of this passage may be taken from the eighth chapter of the Romans,
where the Apostle declares, that *the body, indeed, is dead, on account
of sin,* and we *carry* in us the elements of death; but that *the
Spirit of Christ, who raised him up from the dead, dwelleth also in us,*
and that he is life, to raise up us also one day from the dead. (<span
id="i.v-p72.6"></span>[Rom. 8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010.md),
[11](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011)<span id="i.v-p72.6"></span>..md) From
this you see, that we have *living souls,* inasmuch as we are men, but
that we have the *life-giving Spirit* of Christ poured out upon us by
the grace of regeneration. In short, Paul’s meaning is, that the
condition that we obtain through Christ is greatly superior to the lot
of the *first man,* because a *living soul* was conferred upon Adam in
his own name, and in that of his posterity, but Christ has procured for
us the Spirit, who is *life.*

<span id="i.v-p73"></span>Now as to his calling Christ *the last Adam,*
the reason is this, that as the human race was created in the *first
man,* so it is renewed in Christ. I shall express it again, and more
distinctly: All men were created in the *first man,* because, whatever
God designed to give to all, he conferred upon that one man, so that the
condition of mankind was settled in his person. He by his fall  <span
id="fr_116"></span>[117](#fn_116.md) ruined himself and those that were
his, because he drew them all, along with himself, into the same ruin:
Christ came to restore our nature from ruin, and raise it up to a better
condition than ever. They  <span id="fr_117"></span>[118](#fn_117.md) are
then, as it were, two sources, or two roots of the human race. Hence it
is not without good reason, that the one is called the *first man,* and
the other the *last.* This, however, gives no support to those madmen,
who make Christ to be one of ourselves, as though there were and always
had been only two men, and that this multitude which we behold, were a
mere phantom! A similar comparison occurs in <span
id="i.v-p75.2"></span>[Ro 5:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012.md)<span
id="i.v-p75.2"></span>

<span id="i.v-p76"></span><span id="i.v-p76.1"></span>

<span id="i.v-p77"></span>**46.** *But this is not first, which is
spiritual.* “It is necessary,” says he, “that before we are restored in
Christ, we derive our origin from Adam, and resemble him. Let us,
therefore, not wonder, if we begin with the *living soul,* for as *being
born* precedes in order *being born again,* so *living* precedes *rising
again.”*

<span id="i.v-p78"></span><span id="i.v-p78.1"></span>

<span id="i.v-p79"></span>**47.** *The first Adam was from the earth.*
The *animal* life comes first, because the *earthy man* is first.  <span
id="fr_118"></span>[119](#fn_118.md) The spiritual life will come
afterwards, as Christ, the *heavenly man,* came after Adam. Now the
Manichees perverted this passage, with the view of proving that Christ
brought a body from heaven into the womb of the Virgin. They mistakingly
imagined, however, that Paul speaks here of the substance of the body,
while he is discoursing rather as to its condition, or quality. Hence,
although the *first man* had an immortal soul, and that too, not taken
from the earth, yet he, nevertheless, savoured of the earth, from which
his body had sprung, and on which he had been appointed to live. Christ,
on the other hand, brought us from heaven a *life-giving Spirit,* that
he might regenerate us into a better life, and elevated above the earth.
 <span id="fr_119"></span>[120](#fn_119.md) In fine, we have it from Adam —
that we live in this world, as branches from the root: Christ, on the
other hand, is the beginning and author of the heavenly life.

<span id="i.v-p82"></span>But some one will say in reply, Adam is said
to be *from the earth* — Christ *from heaven;* the nature of the
comparison  <span id="fr_120"></span>[121](#fn_120.md) requires this much,
that Christ have his body *from heaven,* as the body of Adam was formed
*from the earth;* or, at least, that the origin of man’s soul should be
*from the earth,* but that Christ’s soul had come forth from heaven. I
answer, that Paul had not contrasted the two departments of the subject
with such refinement and minuteness, (for this was not necessary;) but
when treating of the nature of Christ and *Adam,* he made a passing
allusion to the creation of Adam, that he had been formed *from the
earth,,* and at the same time, for the purpose of commending Christ’s
excellence, he states, that he is the Son of God, who came down to us
from heaven, and brings with him, therefore, a heavenly nature and
influence. This is the simple meaning, while the refinement of the
Manichees is a mere calumny.

<span id="i.v-p84"></span>We must, however, reply to another objection
still. For Christ, so long as he lived in the world, lived a life
similar to ours, and therefore earthly: hence it is not a proper
contrast. The solution of this question will serve farther to refute the
contrivance  <span id="fr_121"></span>[122](#fn_121.md) of the Manichees.
For we know, that the body of Christ was liable to death, and that it
was exempted from corruption, not by its essential property, (as they
speak,)  <span id="fr_122"></span>[123](#fn_122.md) but solely by the
providence of God. Hence Christ was not merely *earthy* as to the
essence of his body, but was also for a time in an earthly condition;
for before Christ’s power could show itself in conferring the heavenly
life, it was necessary that he should die in the *weakness of the
flesh,* (<span id="i.v-p86.2"></span>[2Co
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004)<span id="i.v-p86.2"></span>..md) Now
this heavenly life appeared first in the resurrection, that he might
quicken us also.

<span id="i.v-p87"></span><span id="i.v-p87.1"></span>

<span id="i.v-p88"></span>**49.** *As we have borne* Some have thought,
that there is here an exhortation to a pious and holy life, into which
Paul was led by way of digression; and on that account they have changed
the verb from the future tense into the hortative mood. Nay more, in
some Greek manuscripts the reading is <span
id="i.v-p88.1"></span>φορέσωμεν *(let us bear,)*  <span
id="fr_123"></span>[124](#fn_123.md) but as that does not suit so well in
respect of connection, let us adopt in preference what corresponds
better with the object in view and the context.  <span
id="fr_124"></span>[125](#fn_124.md) Let us observe, in the first place,
that this is not an exhortation, but pure doctrine, and that he is not
treating here of newness of life, but pursues, without any interruption,
the thread of his discourse respecting the resurrection of the flesh.
The meaning accordingly will be this: “As the *animal nature,* which has
the *precedency* in us, is the image of Adam, so we shall be conformed
to Christ in the *heavenly nature;* and this will be the completion of
our restoration. For we *now* begin to bear the image of Christ, and are
every day more and more transformed into it;  <span
id="fr_125"></span>[126](#fn_125.md) but that image consists in spiritual
regeneration. But *then* it will be fully restored both in body and in
soul, and what is now begun will be perfected, and *accordingly* we will
obtain in reality what we as yet only hope for.” If, however, any one
prefers a different reading, this statement will serve to spur forward
the Corinthians; and if there had been a lively meditation of sincere
piety and a new life, it might have been the means of kindling up in
them at the same time the hope of heavenly glory.

<span id="i.v-p92"></span><span id="i.v-p92.1"></span>

<span id="i.v-p93"></span>**50.** *Now this I say* This clause
intimates, that what follows is explanatory of the foregoing statement.
“What I have said as to *bearing the image of the heavenly Adam* means
this — that we must be renewed in respect of our bodies, inasmuch as our
bodies, being liable to corruption, cannot inherit God’s incorruptible
kingdom. Hence there will be no admission for us into the kingdom of
Christ, otherwise than by Christ’s renewing us after his own image.”
*Flesh and blood,* however, we must understand, *according to the
condition in which they at present are,* for our flesh will be a
participant in the glory of God, but it will be — as renewed and
quickened by the Spirit of Christ.

<span id="i.vi-p19"></span><span id="i.vi-p19.1"></span>

<span id="i.vi-p20"></span>Hitherto he has included two things in his
reasoning. In *the first* place, he shows that there will be a
resurrection from the dead: *secondly,* he shows of what nature it will
be. Now, however, he enters more thoroughly into a description of the
manner of it. This he calls a *mystery,* because it had not been as yet
so clearly unfolded in any statement of revelation; but he does this to
make them more attentive. For that wicked doctrine had derived strength
from the circumstance, that they disputed as to this matter carelessly
and at their ease;  <span id="fr_126"></span>[127](#fn_126.md) as if it
were a matter in which they felt no difficulty. Hence by the term
*mystery,* he admonishes them to learn a matter, which was not only as
yet unknown to them, but ought to be reckoned among God’s heavenly
secrets.

<span id="i.vi-p22"></span>**51.** *We shall not indeed all sleep.* Here
there is no difference in the Greek manuscripts, but in the Latin
versions there are three different readings. The *first* is, *We shall
indeed all die, but we shall not all be changed.* The *second* is, *We
shall indeed all rise again, but we shall not all be changed.*  <span
id="fr_127"></span>[128](#fn_127.md) The *third* is, *We shall not indeed
all sleep, but we shall all be changed.* This diversity, I conjecture,
had arisen from this — that some readers, who were not the most
discerning, dissatisfied with the true reading, ventured to conjecture a
reading which was more approved by them.  <span
id="fr_128"></span>[129](#fn_128.md) For it appeared to them, at first
view, to be absurd to say, that *all would not die,* while we read
elsewhere, that *it is appointed unto all men once to die.* (<span
id="i.vi-p24.2"></span>[Heb 9:27](../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027.md)<span
id="i.vi-p24.2"></span>.) Hence they altered the meaning in this way —
All *will not be changed, though all will rise again, or will die;* and
the *change* they interpret to mean — the glory that the sons of God
alone will obtain. The true reading, however, may be judged of from the
context.

<span id="i.vi-p25"></span>Paul’s intention is to explain what he had
said — that we will be conformed to Christ, because *flesh and blood
cannot inherit the kingdom of God.* A question presented itself,  <span
id="fr_129"></span>[130](#fn_129.md) what then will become of those who
will be still living at the day of the Lord? His answer is, that
although *all will not die,* yet they will be renewed, that mortality
and corruption may be done *away.* It is to be observed, however, that
he speaks exclusively of believers; for although the resurrection of the
wicked will also involve *change,* yet as there is no mention made of
them here, we must consider everything that is said, as referring
exclusively to the elect. We now see, how well this statement
corresponds with the preceding one, for as he had said, that *we shall
bear the image of Christ,* he now declares, that this will take place
when we shall be *changed,* so that

<span id="i.vi-p27"></span>mortality may be swallowed up of life, (<span
id="i.vi-p27.1"></span>[2Co 5:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004.md)<span
id="i.vi-p27.1"></span>,)

<span id="i.vi-p28"></span>and that this renovation is not inconsistent
with the fact, that Christ’s advent will find some still alive.

<span id="i.vi-p29"></span>We must, however, unravel the difficulty —
that *it is appointed unto all men once to die;* and certainly, it is
not difficult to unravel it in this way — that as a *change* cannot take
place without doing away with the previous system, that *change* is
reckoned, with good reason, a kind of *death;* but, as it is not a
separation of the soul from the body, it is not looked upon as an
ordinary death. It will then be *death,* inasmuch as it will be the
destruction of corruptible nature: it will not be a *sleep,* inasmuch as
the soul will not quit the body; but there will be a sudden transition
from corruptible nature into a blessed immortality.

<span id="i.vi-p30"></span><span id="i.vi-p30.1"></span>

<span id="i.vi-p31"></span>**52.** *In a moment* This is still of a
general nature; that is, it includes all. For in all the change will be
sudden and instantaneous, because Christ’s advent will be sudden. And to
convey the idea of *a moment,* he afterwards makes use of the phrase
*twinkling* (or *jerk)* of the eye, for in the Greek manuscripts there
is a twofold, reading — <span id="i.vi-p31.1"></span>ῥοπὣ *(jerk,)* or
<span id="i.vi-p31.2"></span>ῥιπὣ *(twinkling.)*  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[131](#fn_130.md) It matters nothing, however, as to the
sense. Paul has selected a movement of the body, that surpasses all
others in quickness; for nothing is more rapid than a movement of the
eye, though at the same time he has made an allusion to *sleep,* with
which *twinkling of the eye* is contrasted.  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[132](#fn_131.md)

<span id="i.vi-p34"></span>*With the last trump.* Though the repetition
of the term might seem to place it beyond a doubt, that the word
*trumpet* is here taken in its proper acceptation, yet I prefer to
understand the expression as metaphorical. In <span
id="i.vi-p34.2"></span>[1Th 4:16](../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016.md)<span
id="i.vi-p34.2"></span>, he connects together the *voice of the
archangel* and the *trump of God:* As therefore a commander, with the
sound of a trumpet, summons his army to battle, so Christ, by his far
sounding proclamation, which will be heard throughout the whole world,
will summon all the dead. Moses tells us, (<span
id="i.vi-p34.3"></span>[Ex 19:16](../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016.md)<span
id="i.vi-p34.3"></span>,) what loud and terrible sounds were uttered on
occasion of the promulgation of the law. Far different will be the
commotion *then,* when not one people merely, but the whole world will
be summoned to the tribunal of God. Nor will the living only be
convoked, but even the dead will be called forth from their graves.
 <span id="fr_132"></span>[133](#fn_132.md) Nay more, a commandment must be
given to dry bones and dust that, resuming their former appearance and
reunited to the spirit, they come forth straightway as living men into
the presence of Christ.

<span id="i.vi-p36"></span>*The dead shall rise* What he had declared
generally as to all, he now explains particularly as to the living and
the dead. This distinction, therefore, is simply an exposition of the
foregoing statement — *that all will not die, but all will be changed*
“Those who have already died,” says he, *“will* rise again
incorruptible.” See what a change there will be upon the *dead!*
“Those,” says he, “who will be still alive will themselves also be
*changed.”* You see then as to both.  <span
id="fr_133"></span>[134](#fn_133.md) You now then perceive how it is, that
*change* will be common to all, but not *sleep.*  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[135](#fn_134.md)

<span id="i.vi-p39"></span>When he says, *We shall be changed,* he
includes himself in the number of those, who are to live till the advent
of Christ. As it was now the *last times,* (<span
id="i.vi-p39.1"></span>[1Jo 2:18](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018.md)<span
id="i.vi-p39.1"></span>,) *that day* (<span id="i.vi-p39.2"></span>[2Ti
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018)<span id="i.vi-p39.2"></span>.md) was
to be looked for by the saints every hour. At the same time, in writing
to the Thessalonians, he utters that memorable prediction respecting the
scattering  <span id="fr_135"></span>[136](#fn_135.md) that would take
place in the Church before Christ’s coming. (<span
id="i.vi-p40.2"></span>[2Th 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003.md)<span
id="i.vi-p40.2"></span>.) This, however, does not hinder that he might,
by bringing the Corinthians, as it were, into immediate contact with the
event, associate himself and them with those who would at that time be
alive.

<span id="i.vi-p41"></span><span id="i.vi-p41.1"></span>

<span id="i.vi-p42"></span>**53.** *For this corruptible must* Mark, how
we shall live in the kingdom of God both in body and in soul, while at
the same time *flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God* — for
they shall previously be delivered from corruption. Our nature then, as
being now corruptible and mortal, is not admissible into the kingdom of
God, but when it shall have put off corruption, and shall have been
beautified with in-corruption, it will then make its way into it. This
passage, too, distinctly proves, that we shall rise again in that same
flesh that we now carry about with us, as the Apostle assigns a new
quality to it which will serve as a garment. If he had said, *This
corruptible must be renewed,* the error of those fanatics, who imagine
that mankind will be furnished with new bodies, would not have been so
plainly or forcibly overthrown. Now, however, when he declares that
*this corruptible shall be invested with glory,* there is no room left
for cavil.

<span id="i.vi-p43"></span><span id="i.vi-p43.1"></span>

<span id="i.vi-p44"></span>**54.** *Then shall be brought to pass the
saying* This is not merely an amplification, *(*<span
id="i.vi-p44.1"></span>ἐπεξεργασία*,)*  <span
id="fr_136"></span>[137](#fn_136.md) but a confirmation, too, of the
preceding statement. For what was foretold by the Prophets must be
fulfilled. Now this prediction will not be fulfilled, until our bodies,
laying aside corruption, will *put on incorruption* Hence this last
result, also, is necessary. To *come to pass,* is used here in the sense
of being *fully accomplished,* for what Paul quotes is now begun in us,
and is daily, too, receiving further accomplishment; but it will not
have its complete fulfillment until the last day.

<span id="i.vi-p46"></span>It does not, however, appear quite manifest,
from what passage he has taken this quotation, for many statements occur
in the Prophets to this effect. Only the probability is, that the first
clause is taken either from <span id="i.vi-p46.1"></span>[Isa
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008.md)<span id="i.vi-p46.1"></span>,
where it is said that *death will be for ever destroyed* by the Lord,
 <span id="fr_137"></span>[138](#fn_137.md) or, (as almost all are rather
inclined to think,) from <span id="i.vi-p47.11"></span>[Ho
13:14](../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014.md)<span id="i.vi-p47.11"></span>,
where the Prophet, bewailing the obstinate wickedness of Israel,
complains that he was like an untimely child, that struggles against the
efforts of his mother in travail, that he may not *come* forth from the
womb, and from this he concludes, that it was owing entirely to himself,
that he was not delivered from death. *I will ransom them,* says he,
from *the power of the grave: I will rescue them from death.* It matters
not, whether you read these words in the future of the indicative, or in
the subjunctive  <span id="fr_138"></span>[139](#fn_138.md) for in either
way the meaning amounts to this — that God was prepared to confer upon
them salvation, if they would have allowed the favor to be conferred
upon them, and that, therefore, if they perished, it was their own
fault.

<span id="i.vi-p49"></span>He afterwards adds, *I will be thy
destruction, O death! thy ruin, O grave!* In these words God intimates,
that he accomplishes the salvation of his people  <span
id="fr_139"></span>[140](#fn_139.md) only when death and the grave are
reduced to nothing. For no one will deny, that in that passage there is
a description of completed salvation. As, therefore, we do not see such
a destruction of death, it follows, that we do not yet enjoy that
complete salvation, which God promises to his people, and that,
consequently, it is delayed until *that day. Then,* accordingly, *will
death be swallowed up,* that is, it will be reduced to nothing,  <span
id="fr_140"></span>[141](#fn_140.md) that we may have manifestly, in every
particular, and in every respect, (as they say,) a complete victory over
it.  <span id="fr_141"></span>[142](#fn_141.md)

<span id="i.vi-p53"></span><span id="i.vi-p53.1"></span>

<span id="i.vi-p54"></span>As to the second clause, in which he triumphs
over death and the grave, it is not certain whether he speaks of
himself, or whether he meant there also to quote the words of the
Prophet. For where we render it, “I will be thy destruction, O death! —
thy ruin, O grave*!”* the Greeks have translated it, “*Where, O death,
is thy suit?*  <span id="fr_142"></span>[143](#fn_142.md) *where, O grave,
thy sting?”* Now although this mistake of the Greeks is excusable from
the near resemblance of the words,  <span
id="fr_143"></span>[144](#fn_143.md) yet if any one will attentively
examine the context, he will see that they have gone quite away from the
Prophet’s intention. The true meaning, then, will be this — that the
Lord will put an end to death, and destroy the grave. It is possible,
however, that, as the Greek translation was in common use, Paul alluded
to it, and in that there is nothing inconsistent, though he has not
quoted literally, for instead of *victory* he has used the term
*action,* or *law-suit.*  <span id="fr_144"></span>[145](#fn_144.md) I am
certainly of opinion, that the Apostle did not deliberately intend to
call in the Prophet as a witness, with the view of making a wrong use of
his authority, but simply accommodated, in passing, to his own use a
sentiment that had come into common use, as being, independently of
this, of a pious nature.  <span id="fr_145"></span>[146](#fn_145.md) The
main thing is this — that Paul, by an exclamation of a spirited nature,
designed to rouse up the minds of the Corinthians, and lead them on, as
it were, to a near view of the resurrection. Now, although we do not as
yet behold the victory with our eyes, and the day of triumph has not yet
arrived, (nay more, the dangers of war must every day be encountered,)
yet the assurance of faith, as we shall have occasion to observe ere
long, is not at all thereby diminished.

<span id="i.vi-p59"></span><span id="i.vi-p59.1"></span>

<span id="i.vi-p60"></span>**56.** *The sting of death is sin* In other
words, “Death has no dart with which to wound us except *sin,* since
*death* proceeds from the anger of God. Now it is only with our sins
that God is angry. Take away sin, therefore, and death will no more be
able to harm us.” This agrees with what he said in <span
id="i.vi-p60.1"></span>[Ro 6:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023.md)<span
id="i.vi-p60.1"></span>, that *the wages of sin is death.* Here,
however, he makes use of another metaphor, for he compared sin to a
*sting,* with which alone death is armed for inflicting upon us a deadly
wound. Let *that* be taken away, and death is disarmed, so as to be no
longer hurtful. Now with what view Paul says this will be explained by
him ere long.

<span id="i.vi-p61"></span>*The strength of sin is the law* It is the
law of God that imparts to that sting its deadly power, because it does
not merely discover our guilt, but even increases it. A clearer
exposition of this statement may be found in <span
id="i.vi-p61.1"></span>[Ro 7:9](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009.md)<span
id="i.vi-p61.1"></span>, where Paul teaches us that we *are alive,* so
long as we are *without the law,* because in our own opinion it is well
with us, and we do not feel our own misery, until the law summons us to
the judgment of God, and wounds our conscience with an apprehension of
eternal death. Farther, he teaches us that sin has been in a manner
lulled asleep, but is kindled up by the law, so as to rage furiously.
Meanwhile, however, he vindicates the law from calumnies, on the ground
that it is *holy, and good, and just,* and is not of itself the parent
of sin or the cause of death. Hence he concludes, that whatever there is
of evil is to be reckoned to our own account, inasmuch as it manifestly
*proceeds* from the depravity of our nature. Hence the law is but the
*occasion* of injury. The true *cause* of ruin is in ourselves. Hence he
speaks of the law here as the *strength or power of sin*, because it
executes upon us the judgment of God. In the mean time he does not deny,
that sin inflicts death even upon those that know not the law; but he
speaks in this manner, because it exercises its tyranny upon them with
less violence. For *the law came that sin might abound,* (<span
id="i.vi-p61.2"></span>[Ro 5:20](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020.md)<span
id="i.vi-p61.2"></span>,) or that it *might become beyond measure
sinful.* (<span id="i.vi-p61.3"></span>[Ro
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013)<span id="i.vi-p61.3"></span>..md)

<span id="i.vi-p62"></span><span id="i.vi-p62.1"></span>

<span id="i.vi-p63"></span>**57.** *But thanks be to God* From this it
appears, why it it was that he made mention both of sin and of the law,
when treating of death. Death has no *sting* with which to wound except
*sin,* and the law imparts to this *sting* a deadly power. But Christ
has conquered sin, and by conquering it has procured victory for us, and
*has* *redeemed us from the curse of the law.* (<span
id="i.vi-p63.1"></span>[Ga 3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013.md)<span
id="i.vi-p63.1"></span>.) Hence it follows, that we are no longer lying
under the power of death. Hence, although we have not as yet a full
discovery of those benefits, yet we may already with confidence glory in
them, because it is necessary that what has been accomplished in the
Head should be accomplished, also, in the members. We may, therefore,
triumph over death as subdued, because Christ’s victory is ours.

<span id="i.vi-p64"></span>When, therefore, he says, that *victory has
been given to us,* you are to understand by this in the *first* place,
that it is inasmuch as Christ has in his own person abolished sin, has
satisfied the law, has endured the curse, has appeased the anger of God,
and has procured life; and farther, because he has already begun to make
us partakers of all those benefits. For though we still carry about with
us the remains of sin, it, nevertheless, does not reign in us: though it
still *stings* us, it does not do so fatally, because its edge is
blunted, so that it does not penetrate into the vitals of the soul.
Though the law still threatens, yet there is presented to us on the
other hand, the liberty that was procured for us by Christ, which is an
antidote to its terrors. Though the remains of sin still dwell in us,
yet the Spirit who raised up Christ from the dead is *life, because of
righteousness.* (<span id="i.vi-p64.1"></span>[Ro
8:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010)<span id="i.vi-p64.1"></span>..md)
Now follows the conclusion.

<span id="i.vi-p65"></span><span id="i.vi-p65.1"></span>

<span id="i.vi-p66"></span>**58.** *Wherefore, my brethren* Having
satisfied himself that he had sufficiently proved the doctrine of the
resurrection, he now closes his discussion with an exhortation; and this
has much more force, than if he had made use of a simple conclusion with
an affirmation. *Since your labor,* says he, *is not in vain in the
Lord, be steadfast, and abound in good works* Now he says that *their
labor is not in vain,* for this reason, that there is a reward laid up
for them with God. This is that exclusive hope which, in the first
instance, encourages believers, and afterwards sustains them, so that
they do not stop short in the race. Hence he exhorts them to remain
*steadfast,* because they rest on a firm foundation, as they know that a
better life is prepared for them in heaven.

<span id="i.vi-p67"></span>He adds — *abounding in the work of the
Lord;* for the hope of a resurrection makes us not be *weary* in well
doing, as he teaches in <span id="i.vi-p67.1"></span>[Col
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010.md)<span id="i.vi-p67.1"></span>. For
amidst so many occasions of offense as constantly present themselves to
us, who is there that would not despond, or turn aside from the way,
were it not that, by thinking of a better life he is by this means kept
in the fear of God? Now, on the other hand, he intimates, that if the
hope of a resurrection is taken away, then, the foundation (as it were)
being rooted up, the whole structure of piety falls to the ground.
 <span id="fr_146"></span>[147](#fn_146.md) Unquestionably, if the hope of
reward is taken away and extinguished, alacrity in running will not
merely grow cold, but will be altogether destroyed.

1:3.46,) the Apostle “calling himself so as being an Apostle not formed
and matured by previous preparation and instruction.” *Penn,* after
quoting the definition given by Eustathius of the term <span
id="i.i-p68.2"></span>ἔκτρωμα — <span id="i.i-p68.3"></span>τὸ μήπω
τετυπώμενον — *an unformed foetus,* remarks: “To all the other Apostles
our Lord appeared after his resurrection, when they had attained their
*adult form* in his ministry; but to St. Paul he appeared at the first
moment of his spiritual conception, and *before he was formed or
moulded.”* The same view, in substance, is given by *McKnight.*
“Although he” (Paul) “calls himself *an abortive Apostle,* it was not on
account of his being sensible of any imperfection in his commission, or
of any weakness in his qualifications as an Apostle; for he affirms,
<span id="i.i-p68.4"></span>[2Co
11:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#005.md)<span id="i.i-p68.4"></span>, that
he was *in nothing behind the very greatest of the Apostles;* but he
called himself an *abortive Apostle,* because, as he tells us (<span
id="i.i-p68.5"></span>[1Co 15:9](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009.md)<span
id="i.i-p68.5"></span>,) he *had persecuted the Church of God,* and
because he was made an Apostle without that previous course of
instruction and preparation, which the other Apostles enjoyed who had
attended Jesus Christ during his ministry on earth; so that, in the
proper sense of the word, he was <span id="i.i-p68.6"></span>ἔκτρωμα —
born before he was brought to maturity. That want, however, was
abundantly supplied by the many revelations which his master gave him

*Gratia Dei meoum,* uti vetus Itala vertit, quasi effectus inter
Gra-tiam Dei, et Pauli arbitrium distribueretur; nihil enim habuit ipse,

voluit; sed quia po-tens illa gratia demonstratio et testimonium
irrefragabile erat resurrectionis Domini.” — “Not the *grace of God with
me,* as the old Italic version renders it, as though the effect were
divided between God’s grace and Paul’s free-will; for he has nothing
that he has not received, but <span id="i.i-p82.4"></span>ἡ σὺν ἐμοί*,
which with me*, that every thing may be wholly and entirely ascribed to
grace alone. Nor does he speak thus, merely for the purpose of showing
humility and modesty, though he had it also in view to testify this, but
because that grace was a powerful demonstration and irrefragable
testimony of our Lord’s resurrection.” — Heideggeri Labores Exegetici in

only the latter suits his view of Paul’s argument.” It is justly
observed, however, by Dr. Alexander, in his translation of Billroth,
that Calvin may be considered to have “used the word <span

<span id="i.ii-p51"></span> It is mentioned by Beza in his life of
Calvin, that before leaving France in 1534, he “published his admirable
treatise, entitled Psychopannychia, against the error of those who,
reviving a doctrine which had been held in the earliest ages, taught
that the soul, when separated from the body, falls *asleep.”* — Calvin’s

Psychopannychitae finxerunt: animas post mortem dormire, aut in nihilum
cum corporibus redigi. *Perire* enim dicuntur infideles quoad animas,
non physice, quod corruptae intercant; sed theologice, quod viventes
felicitatern coelestem non consequantur; sed in tartara ad paenas solae
vel cum corporibus tandem detrudantur;” — “By no means, however, does it
follow from this, according to the contrivance of the soul-sleepers,
that souls sleep after death, or are reduced to nothing along with the
body. For unbelievers are said to *perish* as to their souls, not
physically, as though they corrupted, and died, but theologically,
because, while living they do not attain heavenly felicity, but are at
length thrust down to hell for punishment, alone, or along with the

<span id="i.iii-p23"></span> “Although the resurrection of Christ,

them, yet it more especially agrees with the offering of the *sheaf,*
commonly called <span id="i.iii-p23.1"></span>עומר, *omer,* not only as
the thing itself, but also as to the circumstances of the *time.* For
first there was the *passover,* and the day following was a *sabbatic*
day, and on the *day following* that, the first-fruits were offered. So
Christ, our *passover,* was crucified: the day following his crucifixion
was the *Sabbath,* and the day following *that,* he, the *first-fruits

God presented to him at a stated season, not only as a token of the

the dead. He was the first in order of time, for although some were
restored to life by the Prophets, and by himself during his personal
ministry, none came out of their graves to return to them no more till
after his resurrection; and as he was the first in respect of time, so
he was the first in order of succession; all the saints following him as
the harvest followed the presentation of the *first-fruits* of the
temple. The interval is long, and the dreary sterility of the grave
might justify the thought, that the seed committed to it has perished
for ever. But our hope rests upon his power, which can make the
wilderness blossom as the rose; and we wait till heavenly influences
descend as the dew of herbs, when the barren soil shall display all the
luxuriance of vegetation, and death itself shall teem with *life.”* —

our Savior’s conquest, the advancement of his triumphs, and the
prostration of all enemies whatever beneath his power. Now to say that
‘the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,’ by no means affords a
proof of this position. Though death might be destroyed, and be the last
enemy that shall be destroyed, it would not thence appear but that other
enemies might remain not destroyed. But the proper rendering is, ‘Death,

that the Apostle calls it the *last* in respect of duration, in relation

<span id="i.iii-p54"></span> “The mediatorial kingdom of Christ will end
when its design is accomplished; he will cease to exercise an authority
which has no longer an object. When all the elect are converted by the
truth, and, being collected into one body, are presented to the Father
‘a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing;’
when idolatry, superstition, and heresy are overthrown, and all evil is
expelled from the kingdom of God; when the plans and efforts of wicked
spirits are defeated, and they are shut up in their prison, from which
there is no escape; when death has yielded up his spoils, and laid his
scepter at the feet of his Conqueror; when the grand assize has been
held, his impartial sentence has pronounced the doom of the human race,
and their everlasting abodes are allotted to the righteous and the
ungodly, nothing will remain to be done by the power with which our
Savior was invested at his ascension; and his work being finished, his
commission will expire. On this subject we cannot speak with certainty,
and are in great danger of error, because the event is future, and our
information is imperfect. Here analogy fails, and the utmost caution is
necessary in borrowing an illustration from human affairs; but without
insinuating that the two cases are exactly similar, may we not say, that
as a regent or vicegerent of a King to whom the royal authority has been
intrusted for a time, resigns it at the close, and the sovereign himself
resumes the reins of government; so our Redeemer, who now sways the
scepter of the universe, will return his delegated power to him from
whom he received it, and a new order of things will commence under which
the dependence of men upon the Godhead will be immediate; and Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, one in essence, counsel, and operation, will reign
for ever over the inhabitants of heaven. This is the probable meaning of

conversos olim multi erant qui Baptismum diu differebant, etiam usque ad
mortem, adeoque aegri in lecto baptizabantur, ut per Baptismum expiati
ab omni culpa et poena illico puri evolarent in coelum:” — “Among the
converted there were anciently many who deferred baptism for a long
time, even up to the time of their death, and were accordingly baptized
when sick in bed, that cleared by baptism from all fault and punishment,
they might fly up to heaven pure.” Milner, in his Church History,
(volume 2,) when treating of Gregory Nazianzen, says, “In another
discourse, he protests against the too common practice of delaying
baptism, which, from the example of Constantine, had grown very
fashionable, for reasons equally corrupt and superstitious. Men lived in
sin as long as they thought they could safely, and deferred baptism till
their near approach to death, under a groundless hope of washing away
all their guilt at once.” See also Turretine’s Theology, (Geneva, 1690,)

<span id="i.iv-p30"></span> “Baptism,” says Dr. Dick, in his Lectures on
Theology, (volume 4) “imports our interest in the resurrection of Christ
and its consequences. It was called by the ancients ‘the earnest of good
things to come,’ and ‘the type of the future resurrection.’ May not this
be the meaning of that passage in the fifteenth chapter of the first
Epistle to the Corinthians, concerning which there has been such a
diversity of opinion? ‘Else what shall they do which are baptized for
the dead, if the dead rise not? why are they then baptized for the
dead?’ (<span id="i.iv-p30.1"></span>[1Co
15:29](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#029)<span id="i.iv-p30.1"></span>..md)
Some of the Fathers understood the expression, <span
id="i.iv-p30.2"></span>ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν, to mean to be baptized *into the
hope of the resurrection of the dead;* or, what amounts to the same
thing, to submit to baptism that they might fill up the places of those
who had died, thus declaring their belief that they had not perished,
but were alive in a better world, and their hope that, through Jesus
Christ, to whom they dedicated themselves in baptism, they also should
be raised again to enjoy the same glorious recompense. According to this
view of the passage, a resurrection to life is one of the blessings
signified and sealed by this institution. It assures us of a triumph
over death and the grave, through the redeeming blood of Christ, with
which we are sprinkled; and of admission into heaven, for which we are
qualified by the washing of *regeneration.”* — *Ed.*

<span id="i.iv-p71"></span> “The connection is not that in which we
should have expected such a maxim to be inserted. It is in the midst of
a very affecting and instructive view of the resurrection of the dead
and the life everlasting; but the occasion of it was this: the
Corinthians had received, from the intrusion of false teachers,
principles which militated against that great doctrine. They had been
taught to explain it away, and to resolve it merely into a moral process
which takes place in the present world; interpreting what is said of the
resurrection of the dead in a mystical and figurative manner. The
apostle insinuates, that it was by a mixture of the corrupt
communications of these men with the Christian Church, and the intimate
contact into which they had permitted themselves to come with them, that
they had been led off from the fundamental doctrine of the gospel, and
rejected a primary part of the apostolic testimony. ‘For if there be no
resurrection of the dead, then,’ as he observed, ‘is Christ not risen,
and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith
is also vain; ye are yet in your sins.’ We see, that notwithstanding the
apostle had planted pure Christianity among the Corinthians, and had
confirmed it by the most extraordinary miracles and supernatural
operations, yet such was the contagion of evil example and corrupt
communication, that the members of the Corinthian Church, in a very
short time, departed from the fundamental article of the truth as it is
in Jesus Christ; and hence we may learn the importance, nay, the
necessity, of being on our guard in this respect, and of avoiding such
confidence in ourselves as might induce us to neglect the caution here
so forcibly expressed — ’Be not deceived; evil communications corrupt
good manners.’” — *R. Hall’s Works,* (Lond. 1846,) volume 6, pages 273,

<span id="i.v-p47"></span> “Nearly allied to these are the examples of
peculiar transformations undergone by various insects, and the state of
rest and insensibility which precede those transformations; such as the
chrysalis or aurelia state of butterflies, moths, and silkworms. The
<span id="i.v-p47.1"></span>myrmeleon forniicaleo, of whose larva, and
its extraordinary history, Reaumur and Roesel have given accurate
descriptions, continues in its insensible or chrysalis state about four
weeks. The <span id="i.v-p47.2"></span>libellula, or dragon-fly,
continues still longer in its state of inaction. Naturalists tell us
that the worm repairs to the margin of its pond, in quest of a
convenient place of abode, during its insensible state. It attaches
itself to a plant, or piece of dry wood, and the skin, which gradually
becomes parched and brittle, at last splits opposite to the upper part
of the thorax: through this aperture the insect, now become winged,
quickly pushes its way, and being thus extricated front confinement,
begins to expand its wings, to flutter, and, finally, to launch into the
air with that gracefulness and ease which are peculiar to this majestic
tribe. Now who that saw, for the first time, the little pendant coffin
in which the insect lay entombed, and was ignorant of the transformation
of which we are now speaking, would ever predict that, in a few weeks,
perhaps in a few days or hours, it would become one of the most elegant
and active of *winged* insects? And who that contemplates, with the mind
of a philosopher, this current transformation, and knows that two years
before the insect mounts into the air, even while it is living in water,
it has the rudiments of wings, can deny that the body of a dead man may,
at some future period, be again invested with vigor and activity, and
soar to regions for which some latent organization may have peculiarly
fitted it?” — *Olythus Gregory’s* Letters on the Evidences of the

‘The first man Adam was made a living soul; the second Adam was a

signified him to live himself; but a quickening spirit signifies a power
to make others live. *That* the first Adam could not do; the more
excellent kind of life which he had (for there was a complication of
lives in the first creation of this man) he could not *lose:* but he
could not *give.* He could not *lose* it from himself; but he could
never have *given* it, by any power or immediate efficiency of his own,
to another. Here the second Adam — the constitution of the second Adam —
was far above that of the first, in that he could quicken others — a
*quickening spirit,* not only quickened passively, but quickened
actively, such a spirit as could give spirit, and diffuse life.” —

id="i.vi-p32.4"></span>ὀφθαλμοῦ, *(the eye,)* it would probably mean, a
*cast* or *inclination* of the eye. <span id="i.vi-p32.5"></span>̔ΡιπὟ,
(the common reading,) is derived from <span
id="i.vi-p32.6"></span>ῥίπτω, to *throw.* <span

stated by *Parkhurst,)* to mean — <span id="i.vi-p32.8"></span>επιμύσις—
*the shutting or twinkling of the eyelids.*

id="i.vi-p35.1"></span>,) says the prophetic teacher. And how startling,
how stupendous the summons! Nothing equal to it, nothing like it, was
ever heard through all the regions of the universe, or all the
revolutions of time. When conflicting armies have discharged the
bellowing artillery of war, or when victorious armies have shouted for
joy of the conquest, the seas and shores have rung, the mountains and
plains have echoed. But the shout of the archangel, and the trump of
God, will resound from pole to poles — will pierce the center and shake
the pillars of heaven. Stronger — stronger still — it will penetrate
even the deepest recesses of the tomb! It will pour its amazing thunder
into all those abodes of silence. The dead, the very dead, shall
*hear.”* — *Hervey’s* Theron and Aspasio, volume 2 page *66.* — *Ed.*

which the Targum and Syriac agree, in reading the verb as a passive,
<span id="i.vi-p47.2"></span>כלע in Piel, as here, commonly signifies to
destroy, *destroy utterly;* in Kal, the more usual signification is that
of *swallowing,* which most of the versions have unhappily adopted,
<span id="i.vi-p47.3"></span>לנצח the Greek translators render by; <span
id="i.vi-p47.4"></span>ἰσχύσας, εἰς τέλος, εἰς νῖκος; attaching to the
term the idea of what is *overpowering, durable, complete.* The
significations of the Hebrew root <span id="i.vi-p47.5"></span>נצח, used
only in Niphal and Piel, are — to *shine, lead, lead on, be complete;*
in Chald. to *surpass; excel, vanquish;* hence the idea of *victory,
eternity, etc.*<span id="i.vi-p47.6"></span>, attaching to <span
id="i.vi-p47.7"></span>נצח, and of *completely, entirely, for ever,*
etc., to <span id="i.vi-p47.8"></span>לנצח נצח. The words are therefore

subject is, as here, not the millennial state of the Church, but the
state of glory after the resurrection of the body. It will be then only,

righteous, which Isaiah likewise *predicts.”* — *Henderson* on Isaiah. —

<span id="i.vi-p51"></span> “This victory will not be gradual only, but
total and entire. Every thing of mortality, that was hanging about these
glorious victors, shall be *swallowed up* in perfect and endless life.
Death is unstung first — disarmed — and then easily overcome. Its sting
is said to be sin — the deadliest thing in death. A plain farther proof,
by the way, the Apostle intended death also in the moral sense. And the
insulting inquiry, ‘where is it?’ implies ‘tis not any where to be
found; and signifies a total abolition of it, and, by consequence, must
infer that every thing of death besides must, as to them, for ever cease
and be no more. Which also the phrase of *swallowing up* doth with great
emphasis *express.”* — *Howe’s* Works, (Lond. 1834,) page 1035. — *Ed.*

id="i.vi-p56.7"></span>κεντρον, *(sting;)* and the Apostle’s sentence
preserves the same order as in the Greek of Hosea; so that the
transposition lies wholly at the door of those MSS. which are *more
recent than those ancient copies.”* The *Vat.* version has <span
id="i.vi-p56.8"></span>νεικος; instead of <span

version <span id="i.vi-p56.10"></span>νεικος is used in the 54th verse
manifestly instead of <span id="i.vi-p56.11"></span>νικος*,* it
abundantly appears that it is a mere difference of spelling. The words
to which Calvin refers, as having been mistaken for each other from
their *near resemblance,* are, <span id="i.vi-p56.12"></span>δικη
*(law-suit)* and <span id="i.vi-p56.13"></span>νικος, (or <span
