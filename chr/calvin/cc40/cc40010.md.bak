<span id="xi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 5

<span id="xi.i"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p1"></span><span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>[2 Corinthians
5:1-8](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001.md)<span id="xi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p2"></span>**1.** For we know that if our earthly house
of *this* tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house
not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

<span id="xi.i-p3"></span>**1.** Scimus enim, quod, si terrenum nostrum
domicilium destruatur, aedificationem ex Deo habemus, domum non
manufactam, aeternam in coelis.

<span id="xi.i-p4"></span>**2.** For in this we groan, earnestly
desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:

<span id="xi.i-p5"></span>**2.** Etenim in hoc gemimus, domicilium
nostrum quod est e coelo, superinduere desiderantes:

<span id="xi.i-p6"></span>**3.** If so be that being clothed we shall
not be found naked.

<span id="xi.i-p7"></span>**3.** Siquidem etiam vestiti, non nudi
reperiamur.  <span id="fr_504"></span>[505](#fn_504.md)

<span id="xi.i-p9"></span>**4.** For we that are in *this* tabernacle do
groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed
upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.

<span id="xi.i-p10"></span>**4.** Etenim dum sumus in tabernaculo,
gemimus gravati; eo quod non exui volumus,  <span
id="fr_505"></span>[506](#fn_505.md) sed superindui, ut destruatur, quod
mortale est, a vita.

<span id="xi.i-p12"></span>**5.** Now he that hath wrought us for the
selfsame thing *is* God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the
Spirit.

<span id="xi.i-p13"></span>**5.** Qui autem aptavit nos ad hoc ipsum,
Deus est: qui etiam dedit nobis arrhabonem Spiritus.

<span id="xi.i-p14"></span>**6.** Therefore *we are* always confident,
knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the
Lord:

<span id="xi.i-p15"></span>**6.** Confidimus ergo semper, et scimus,
quod habitantes in corpore, peregrinamur a Domino.

<span id="xi.i-p16"></span>**7.** (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)

<span id="xi.i-p17"></span>**7.** Per fidem enim ambulamus, et non per
aspectum.

<span id="xi.i-p18"></span>**8.** We are confident, *I say,* and willing
rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.

<span id="xi.i-p19"></span>**8.** Confidimus, inquam, et libentius
optamus peregrinari a corpore, et habitare apud Dominum.

<span id="xi.i-p20"></span> 

<span id="xi.i-p21"></span><span id="xi.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p22"></span>**1.** *For we know.* Here follows an
amplification <span id="xi.i-p22.2"></span>(επεξεργασια) or
embellishment of the foregoing statement.  <span
id="fr_506"></span>[507](#fn_506.md) For Paul has it in view, to correct in
us impatience, dread, and dislike of the cross, contempt for what is
mean, and in fine, pride, and effeminacy; and this can only be
accomplished by raising up our minds as high as heaven, through contempt
of the world. Now he has recourse to two arguments. On the one hand, he
shows the miserable condition of mankind in this life, and on the other
hand, the supreme and perfect blessedness, which awaits believers in
heaven after death. For what is it that keeps men so firmly bound in a
misplaced attachment to this life, but their deceiving themselves with a
false imagination — thinking themselves happy in living here? On the
other hand, it is not enough to be aware of the miseries of this life,
if we have not at the same time in view the felicity and glory of the
future life. This is common to good and bad alike — that both are
desirous to live. This, also, is common to both — that, when they
consider, how many and how great miseries they are here exposed to,
(with this difference, however, that unbelievers know of no adversities
but those of the body merely, while the pious are more deeply affected
 <span id="fr_507"></span>[508](#fn_507) by spiritual distresses,.md) they
often groan, often deplore their condition, and desire a remedy for
their evils. As, however, all naturally view death with horror,
unbelievers never willingly quit this life, except when they throw it
off in disgust or despair. Believers, on the other hand, depart
willingly, because they have a better hope set before them beyond this
world. This is the sum of the argument. Let us now examine the words one
by one.

<span id="xi.i-p25"></span>*We know,* says he. This knowledge does not
spring from the human intellect, but takes its rise from the revelation
of the Holy Spirit. Hence it is peculiar to believers. Even the heathens
had some idea of the immortality of the soul, but there was not one of
them, that had assurance of it — not one of them could boast that he
spoke of a thing that was *known* to him.  <span
id="fr_508"></span>[509](#fn_508.md) Believers alone can *affirm* this,
 <span id="fr_509"></span>[510](#fn_509.md) to whom it has been testified
of by the word and Spirit of God.

<span id="xi.i-p28"></span>Besides, it is to be observed, that this
knowledge is not merely of a general kind, as though believers were
merely in a general way persuaded, that the children of God will be in a
better condition after death, and had no assurance as to themselves
individually,  <span id="fr_510"></span>[511](#fn_510.md) for of how very
little service this would be for affording a consolation, so difficult
of attainment! On the contrary, every one must have a knowledge peculiar
to himself, for this, and this only, can animate me to meet death with
cheerfulness — if I am fully persuaded, that I am departing to a better
life.

<span id="xi.i-p30"></span>The body, such as we now have it, he calls a
*house of tabernacle* For as *tabernacles*  <span
id="fr_511"></span>[512](#fn_511.md) are constructed, for a temporary
purpose, of slight materials, and without any firm foundation, and then
shortly afterwards are thrown down, or fall of their own accord, so the
mortal body is given to men as a frail hut,  <span
id="fr_512"></span>[513](#fn_512.md) to be inhabited by them for a few
days. The same metaphor is made use of, also, by Peter in his Second
Epistle, (<span id="xi.i-p32.2"></span>[2 Pet.
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#014)<span id="xi.i-p32.2"></span>,.md) and
by Job, (<span id="xi.i-p32.3"></span>[Job
4:19](../../../bib/kjv/job004.htm#019)<span id="xi.i-p32.3"></span>,.md)
when he calls it a *house of clay.* He places in contrast with this a
*building of perpetual duration.* It is not certain, whether he means by
this term a state of blessed immortality, which awaits believers after
death, or the incorruptible and glorious body, such as it will be after
the resurrection. In whichever of these senses it is taken, it will not
be unsuitable; though I prefer to understand it as meaning, that the
blessed condition of the soul after death is the commencement of this
*building,* and the glory of the final resurrection is the consummation
of it.  <span id="fr_513"></span>[514](#fn_513.md) This exposition will
correspond better with the Apostle’s context. The epithets, which he
applies to this building, tend to confirm more fully its perpetuity.

<span id="xi.i-p34"></span><span id="xi.i-p34.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p35"></span>**3.** *Since clothed* He restricts to
believers, what he had stated respecting the certainty of a future life,
as it is a thing peculiar to them. For the wicked, too, are stripped of
the body, but as they bring nothing within the view of God, but a
disgraceful nakedness, they are, consequently, not clothed with a
glorious body. Believers, on the other hand, who appear in the view of
God, clothed with Christ, and adorned with His image, receive the
glorious robe of immortality. For I am inclined to take this view,
rather than that of Chrysostom and others, who think that nothing new is
here stated, but that Paul simply repeats here, what he had previously
said as to putting on an eternal habitation. The Apostle, therefore,
makes mention here of a twofold clothing, with which God invests us —
the righteousness of Christ, and sanctification of the Spirit in this
life; and, after death, immortality and glory. The *first* is the cause
of the *second,* because

<span id="xi.i-p36"></span>those whom God has determined to glorify, he
first justifies. (<span id="xi.i-p36.1"></span>[Ro
8:30](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#030)<span id="xi.i-p36.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.i-p37"></span>This meaning, too, is elicited from the
particle *also,* which is without doubt introduced for the purpose of
amplifying — as if Paul had said, that a new robe will be prepared for
believers after death, since they have been clothed in this life *also.*

<span id="xi.i-p38"></span><span id="xi.i-p38.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p39"></span>**4.** *We groan, being burdened, because we
desire not to be unclothed.* The wicked, too, *groan,* because they are
not contented with their present condition; but afterwards an opposite
disposition prevails, that is, a clinging to life, so that they view
death with horror, and do not feel the long continuance of this mortal
life to be a burden. The *groaning* of believers, on the other hand,
arises from this — that they know, that they are here in a state of
exile from their native land, and that they know, that they are here
shut up in the body as in a prison. Hence they feel this life to be *a
burden,* because in it they cannot enjoy true and perfect blessedness,
because they cannot escape from the bondage of sin otherwise than by
death, and hence they aspire to be elsewhere.

<span id="xi.i-p40"></span>As, however, it is natural for all animals to
desire existence, how can it be, that believers are willing to cease to
exist? The Apostle solves this question, when he says, that believers do
not desire death for the sake of losing any thing, but as having regard
to a better life. At the same time, the words express more than this.
For he admits, that we have naturally an aversion to the quitting of
this life, considered in itself, as no one willingly allows himself to
be striped of his garments. Afterwards, however, he adds, that the
natural horror of death is overcome by confidence;  <span
id="fr_514"></span>[515](#fn_514.md) as an individual will, without any
reluctance, throw away a coarse, dirty, threadbare, and, in one word,
tattered garment, with the view of his being arrayed in an elegant,
handsome, new, and durable one.

<span id="xi.i-p42"></span>Farther, he explains the metaphor by saying —

<span id="xi.i-p43"></span>that what is mortal may be destroyed  <span
id="fr_515"></span>[516](#fn_515.md) by life. For as flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of God,  
(<span id="xi.i-p44.3"></span>[1Co
15:50](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050)<span id="xi.i-p44.3"></span>,.md)

<span id="xi.i-p45"></span>it is necessary, that what is corruptible in
our nature should perish, in order that we may be thoroughly renewed,
and restored to a state of perfection. On this account, our body is
called a prison, in which we are confined.

<span id="xi.i-p46"></span><span id="xi.i-p46.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p47"></span>**5.** *Now he that hath fitted us.* This is
added in order that we may know, that this disposition is supernatural.
For mere natural feeling will not lead us forward to this, for it does
not comprehend that hundredfold recompense which springs from the
*dying* of a single *grain.* (<span id="xi.i-p47.1"></span>[Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024)<span id="xi.i-p47.1"></span>..md)
We must, therefore, be *fitted* for it by God. The manner of it is at
the same time subjoined — that he confirms us by his Spirit, who is as
it were an *earnest* At the same time the particle *also* seems to be
added for the sake of amplification. “It is God who forms in us this
desire, and, lest our courage should give way or waver, the Holy Spirit
is given us as an *earnest,* because by his testimony he confirms, and
ratifies the truth of the promise.” For these are *two* offices of the
Holy Spirit — *first,* to show to believers what they ought to desire,
and *secondly,* to influence their hearts efficaciously, and remove all
their doubt, that they may steadfastly persevere in choosing what is
good. There would, however, be nothing unsuitable in extending the word
*fitted,* so as to denote that renovation of life, with which God adorns
his people even in this life, for in this way he already separates them
from others, and shows that they are, by means of his grace, marked out
for a peculiar condition.

<span id="xi.i-p48"></span><span id="xi.i-p48.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p49"></span>**6.** *Therefore we are always confident*
That is, as exercising dependence on the *earnest of the Spirit;* for,
otherwise, we always tremble, or, at least, are courageous or alarmed by
turns, and do not retain a uniform and even tenor of mind. Hence, that
good courage of which Paul speaks has no place in us, unless it is
maintained by the Spirit of God. The connecting particle *and,* which
immediately follows, ought to be understood as meaning *because,* in
this way: We are of good courage, *Because* *we know that we are
absent,* etc. For this knowledge is the cause of our calmness and
confidence; for the reason, why unbelievers are constantly in a ferment
of anxiety, or obstinately murmur against God, is, that they think they
will ere long cease to exist, and they place in this life the highest
and uppermost summit of their felicity.  <span
id="fr_516"></span>[517](#fn_516.md) We, on the other hand, live in the
exercise of contentment,  <span id="fr_517"></span>[518](#fn_517.md) and go
forward to death with alacrity,  <span id="fr_518"></span>[519](#fn_518.md)
because a better hope is laid up for us.

<span id="xi.i-p53"></span>*We are absent from the Lord* Scripture
everywhere proclaims, that God is *present* with us: Paul here teaches,
that we are *absent* from him. This is seemingly a contradiction; but
this difficulty is easily solved, when we take into view the different
respects, in which he is said to be *present* or *absent.* He is, then,
*present* with all men, inasmuch as he upholds them by his power. He
dwells in them, because

<span id="xi.i-p54"></span>in him they live and move and have their
being.  
(<span id="xi.i-p54.2"></span>[Ac
17:28](../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028)<span id="xi.i-p54.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.i-p55"></span>He is *present* with his believing people by
the energy of his Spirit; he lives in them, resides in the midst of
them, nay more, *within* them. But in the mean time he is *absent* from
us, inasmuch as he does not present himself to be seen face to face,
because we are as yet in a state of exile from his kingdom, and have not
as yet attained that blessed immortality, which the angels that are
*with* him enjoy. At the same time, to be *absent,* in this passage,
refers merely to knowledge, as is manifest from the reason that is
afterwards added.

<span id="xi.i-p56"></span><span id="xi.i-p56.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p57"></span>**7.** *For we walk by faith* <span
id="xi.i-p57.1"></span>(Εἰδος) I have here rendered <span
id="xi.i-p57.2"></span>*aspectum,* (*sight,*) because few understood the
meaning of the word <span id="xi.i-p57.3"></span>*species,*
(*appearance.*)  <span id="fr_519"></span>[520](#fn_519.md) He states the
reason, why it is that we are now *absent from the Lord* — because we do
not as yet see him *face to face.* (<span id="xi.i-p58.6"></span>[1Co
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012)<span id="xi.i-p58.6"></span>..md)
The manner of that absence is this — that God is not openly beheld by
us. The reason why he is not seen by us is, that we *walk by faith* Now
it is on good grounds that *faith* is opposed to *sight,* because it,
perceives those things that are hid from the view of men — because it
reaches forth to future things, which do not as yet appear. For such is
the condition of believers, that they resemble the dead rather than the
living — that they often seem as if they were forsaken by God — that
they always have the elements of death shut up within them. Hence they
must necessarily *hope against hope.* (<span id="xi.i-p58.7"></span>[Ro
4:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#018)<span id="xi.i-p58.7"></span>..md)
Now the things that are hoped for are hid, as we read in <span
id="xi.i-p58.8"></span>[Ro 8:24](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#024.md)<span
id="xi.i-p58.8"></span>, and faith is the

<span id="xi.i-p59"></span>manifestation of things which do not
appear.  
(<span id="xi.i-p59.2"></span>[Heb
11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001)<span id="xi.i-p59.2"></span>..md)
 <span id="fr_520"></span>[521](#fn_520.md)

<span id="xi.i-p61"></span>It is not to be wondered, then, if the
apostle says, that we have not as yet the privilege of *sight,* so long
as we *walk by faith* For we *see,* indeed, but it is *through a glass,
darkly;* (<span id="xi.i-p61.1"></span>[1Co
13:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#012)<span id="xi.i-p61.1"></span>,.md)
that is, in place of the reality we rest upon the word.

<span id="xi.i-p62"></span><span id="xi.i-p62.1"></span>

<span id="xi.i-p63"></span>**8.** *We are confident, I say* He again
repeats, what he had said respecting the confidence of the pious — that
they are so far from breaking down under the severity of the cross, and
from being disheartened by afflictions, that they are made thereby more
courageous. For the worst of evils is death, yet believers long to
attain it, as being the commencement of perfect blessedness. Hence *and*
may be regarded as equivalent to *because,* in this way: “Nothing can
befall us, that can shake our confidence and courage, since death (which
others so much dread) is to us *great gain.* (<span
id="xi.i-p63.1"></span>[Php 1:21](../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#021.md)<span
id="xi.i-p63.1"></span>.) For nothing is better than to quit the body,
that we may attain near intercourse with God, and may truly and openly
enjoy his presence. Hence by the decay of the body we lose nothing that
belongs to us.”

<span id="xi.i-p64"></span>Observe here — what has been once stated
already — that true faith begets not merely a contempt of death, but
even a desire for it,  <span id="fr_521"></span>[522](#fn_521.md) and that
it is, accordingly, on the other hand, a token of unbelief, when dread
of death predominates in us above the joy and consolation of hope.
Believers, however, desire death — not as if they would, by an
importunate desire, anticipate their Lord’s day, for they willingly
retain their footing in their earthly station, so long as their Lord may
see good, for they would rather live to the glory of Christ than *die to
themselves,* (<span id="xi.i-p65.2"></span>[Ro
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#007)<span id="xi.i-p65.2"></span>,.md)
and for their own advantage;  <span id="fr_522"></span>[523](#fn_522.md)
for the desire, of which Paul speaks, springs from faith. Hence it is
not at all at variance with the will of God. We may, also, gather from
these words of Paul, that souls, when released from the body, live in
the presence of God, for if, on being *absent from the body,* they have
God *present,*  <span id="fr_523"></span>[524](#fn_523.md) they assuredly
live with him.

<span id="xi.i-p68"></span>Here it is asked by some — “How then did it
happen that the holy fathers dreaded death so much, as for example
David, Hezekiah, and the whole of the Israelitish Church, as appears
from <span id="xi.i-p68.1"></span>[Ps
4](../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#000.md)<span id="xi.i-p68.1"></span>, from
<span id="xi.i-p68.2"></span>[Isa
38:3](../../../bib/kjv/isa038.htm#003.md)<span id="xi.i-p68.2"></span>, and
from <span id="xi.i-p68.3"></span>[Ps
115:17](../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#017.md)<span id="xi.i-p68.3"></span>?”
I am aware of the answer, that is usually returned — that the reason,
why death was so much dreaded by them was, that the revelation of the
future life was as yet obscure, and the consolation, consequently, was
but small. Now I acknowledge, that this, in part, accounts for it, but
not entirely, for the holy fathers of the ancient Church did not in
every case tremble, on being forewarned of their death. Nay more, they
embraced death with alacrity, and with joyful hearts. For Abraham
departed without regret, *full of days.*  <span
id="fr_524"></span>[525](#fn_524.md) (<span id="xi.i-p69.8"></span>[Ge
25:8](../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#008)<span id="xi.i-p69.8"></span>..md) We
do not read that Isaac was reluctant to die. (<span
id="xi.i-p69.9"></span>[Ge 35:29](../../../bib/kjv/gen035.htm#029.md)<span
id="xi.i-p69.9"></span>.) Jacob, with his last breath, declares that he
is

<span id="xi.i-p70"></span>waiting for the salvation of the Lord. (<span
id="xi.i-p70.1"></span>[Ge 49:18](../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#018.md)<span
id="xi.i-p70.1"></span>.)

<span id="xi.i-p71"></span>David himself, too, dies peacefully, without
any regrets, (<span id="xi.i-p71.1"></span>[1Ki
2:10](../../../bib/kjv/kg1002.htm#010)<span id="xi.i-p71.1"></span>,.md)
and in like manner Hezekiah. As to the circumstance, that David and
Hezekiah did, each of them, on one occasion deprecate death with tears,
the reason was, that they were punished by the Lord for certain sins,
and, in consequence of this, they felt the anger of the Lord in death.
Such was the cause of their alarm, and this believers might feel even at
this day, under the reign of Christ. The *desire,* however, of which
Paul speaks, is the disposition of a well-regulated mind.  <span
id="fr_525"></span>[526](#fn_525.md)

<span id="xi.ii"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xi.ii-p1.1"></span>[2 Corinthians
5:9-12](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#009.md)<span id="xi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p4"></span>**10.** For we must all appear before the

<span id="xi.ii-p15"></span><span id="xi.ii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p16"></span>**9.** *Wherefore we strive.* Having shown
how magnanimous Christians ought to be in the endurance of afflictions,
 <span id="fr_530"></span>[531](#fn_530.md) so that even in dying they may
be conquerors over death, and that too, because by afflictions and death
they attain to a blessed life, he now from the same source draws also
another conclusion — that they must, by all means, make it their main
desire to please God. And indeed it cannot but be, that the hope of a
resurrection, and thoughtfulness as to the judgment, will awaken in us
this desire; as, on the other hand, the true reason why we are so
indolent and remiss in duty is, that we seldom, if ever, think of what
ought to be constantly kept in remembrance,  <span
id="fr_531"></span>[532](#fn_531.md) that we are here but lodgers  <span
id="fr_532"></span>[533](#fn_532.md) for a short time, that we may, after
finishing our course, return to Christ. Observe, however, what he says —
that this is the desire both of the *living* and of the *dead,* by which
statement the immortality of the soul is again confirmed.

<span id="xi.ii-p20"></span><span id="xi.ii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p21"></span>**10.** *We must be manifested.* Though this
is common to all, yet all without distinction do not raise their views
in such a way as to consider every moment, that they must appear before
the judgment-seat of Christ. But while Paul, from a holy desire of
acting aright, constantly sisted himself before the bar of Christ, he
had it in view to reprove indirectly those ambitious teachers, who
reckoned it enough to have the plaudits of their fellow-men.  <span
id="fr_533"></span>[534](#fn_533.md) For when he says, that no one can
escape, he seems in a manner to summon them to that heavenly tribunal.
Farther, though the word translated *to be manifested* might be rendered
to *appear,* yet Paul had, in my opinion, something farther in view —
that we shall then come forth to the light, while for the present many
are concealed, as it were, in the darkness. For then *the books,* which
are now shut, *will be opened.* (<span id="xi.ii-p22.2"></span>[Da
7:10](../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#010)<span id="xi.ii-p22.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.ii-p23"></span>*That every one may give account.* As the
passage relates to the recompensing of deeds, we must notice briefly,
that, as evil deeds are punished by God, so also good deeds are
rewarded, but for a different reason; for evil deeds are requited with
the punishment that they deserve, but God in rewarding good deeds does
not look to merit or worthiness. For no work is so full and complete in
all its parts as to be deservedly well-pleasing to him, and farther,
there is no one whose works are in themselves well-pleasing to God,
unless he render satisfaction to the whole law. Now no one is found to
be thus perfect. Hence the only resource is in his accepting us through
unmerited goodness, and justifying us, by not imputing to us our sins.
After he has received us into favor, he receives our works also by a
gracious acceptance. It is on this that the reward hinges. There is,
therefore, no inconsistency in saying, that he rewards good works,
provided we understand that mankind, nevertheless, obtain eternal life
gratuitously. On this point I have expressed myself more fully in the
preceding Epistle, and my Institutes will furnish a full discussion of
it.  <span id="fr_534"></span>[535](#fn_534.md) When he says *in the body,*
I understand him to mean, not merely outward actions, but all the deeds
that are done in this corporeal life.

<span id="xi.ii-p25"></span><span id="xi.ii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p26"></span>**11.** *Knowing therefore.* He now returns
to speak of himself, or he again applies the general doctrine to himself
personally. “I am not ignorant,” says he, “nor devoid of the fear of
God, which ought to reign in the hearts of all the pious.” To *know the
terror of the Lord,* then, is to be influenced by this consideration —
that an account must one day be rendered before the judgment-seat of
Christ; for the man who seriously considers this must of necessity be
touched with fear, and shake off all negligence.  <span
id="fr_535"></span>[536](#fn_535.md) He declares, therefore, that he
discharges his apostleship faithfully and with a *pure conscience,*
(<span id="xi.ii-p27.2"></span>[2Ti
1:3](../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003)<span id="xi.ii-p27.2"></span>,.md) as
one that *walks in the fear of the Lord,* (<span
id="xi.ii-p27.3"></span>[Ac 9:31](../../../bib/kjv/act009.htm#031.md)<span
id="xi.ii-p27.3"></span>,) thinking of the account to be rendered by
him. As, however, his enemies might object: “You extol yourself, it is
true, in magnificent terms, but who is there that sees what you affirm?”
He says, in reply to this, that he discharges indeed the work of a
teacher in the sight of men, but that it is known to God with what
sincerity of mind he acts. “As my mouth speaks to men, so does my heart
to God.”

<span id="xi.ii-p28"></span>*And I trust* This is a kind of correction
of what he had said, for he now boasts that he has not merely God as the
witness of his integrity, but also the Corinthians themselves, to whom
he had given proof of himself. Two things, therefore, are to be observed
here: in the *first* place, that it is not enough that an individual
conducts himself honorably and assiduously  <span
id="fr_536"></span>[537](#fn_536.md) among men, if his *heart is not right
in the sight of God,* (<span id="xi.ii-p29.2"></span>[Ac
8:21](../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#021)<span id="xi.ii-p29.2"></span>;.md)
and *secondly,* that boasting is vain, where evidence of the reality
itself is wanting. For none are more bold in arrogating everything to
themselves, than those that have nothing. Let, therefore, the man who
would have credit given him, bring forward such works as may afford
confirmation to his statements. To be *made manifest in their
consciences* is more than to be known by proofs; for conscience reaches
farther than carnal judgment.

<span id="xi.ii-p30"></span><span id="xi.ii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xi.ii-p31"></span>**12.** *For we commend not ourselves.* He
confirms what he had said immediately before, and at the same time
anticipates a calumny that might be brought against him. For it might
seem as if he were too careful as to his own praise, inasmuch as he
spoke so frequently respecting himself. Nay, it is probable that this
reproach had been cast upon him by the wicked. For when he says — *We
commend not ourselves again,* he says this as if speaking in his own
person. To *commend* is taken in a bad sense, as meaning to *boast,* or
to *brag.*

<span id="xi.ii-p32"></span>When he adds — that he *gives them occasion
of glorying,* he intimates in the *first* place, that he pleads *their*
cause rather than his own, inasmuch as he gives up all with a view to
their glory, and he again indirectly reproves their ingratitude, because
they had not perceived it to be their duty to magnify, of their own
accord, his Apostleship, so as not to impose upon him this necessity;
and farther, because they had not perceived, that it was *their*
interest rather than that of Paul himself, that his Apostleship should
be accounted honorable. We are here taught, that Christ’s servants ought
to be concerned as to their own reputation, only in so far as is for the
advantage of the Church. Paul affirms with truth, that he is actuated by
this disposition.  <span id="fr_537"></span>[538](#fn_537.md) Let others
see that they do not on false grounds pretend to follow his example.
 <span id="fr_538"></span>[539](#fn_538.md) We are taught farther, that
*that* alone is a minister’s true praise, that is common to him with the
whole Church, rather than peculiar to himself exclusively — in other
words, that redounds to the advantage of all.

<span id="xi.ii-p35"></span>*That ye may have something in opposition to
those* He intimates, in passing, that it is necessary to repress the
vanity of those that make empty boasts, and that it is the duty of the
Church to do so. For as ambition of this nature is a peculiarly
destructive pestilence, it is dangerous to encourage it by
dissimulation. As the Corinthians had not taken care to do this, Paul
instructs them how they should act for the future.

<span id="xi.ii-p36"></span>To *glory in appearance, not in heart,* is
to disguise one’s self by outward show, and to regard sincerity of heart
as of no value; for those that will be truly wise *will never glory but
in God.* (<span id="xi.ii-p36.1"></span>[1Co
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031)<span id="xi.ii-p36.1"></span>..md)
But wherever there is empty show, *there* is no sincerity, and no
integrity of heart.

<span id="xi.iii"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p1"></span><span id="xi.iii-p1.1"></span>[2 Corinthians
5:13-17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#013.md)<span id="xi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p2"></span>**13.** For whether we be beside ourselves,
*it is* to God; or whether we be sober, *it is* for your cause.

<span id="xi.iii-p3"></span>**13.** Nam sive insanimus, Deo insanimus:
sive sani sumus, vobis sani sumus.

<span id="xi.iii-p4"></span>**14.** For the love of Christ constraineth
us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:

<span id="xi.iii-p5"></span>**14.** Caritas enim Christi constringit
nos: iudicantes illud, quodsi unus pro omnibus mortuus fuit, ergo omnes
sunt mortui.  <span id="fr_539"></span>[540](#fn_539.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p7"></span>**15.** And *that* he died for all, that
they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him
which died for them, and rose again.

<span id="xi.iii-p8"></span>**15.** Et quidem pro omnibus mortuus est:
ut qui vivunt, posthac non sibi vivant, sed ei qui pro omnibus mortuus
est, et resurrexit.

<span id="xi.iii-p9"></span>**16.** Wherefore henceforth know we no man
after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet
now henceforth know we *him* no more.

<span id="xi.iii-p10"></span>**16.** Itaque nos posthac neminem novimus
secundum carnem: quin etiam si secundum carnem novimus Christum, iam non
amplius novimus.

<span id="xi.iii-p11"></span>**17.** Therefore if any man *be* in
Christ, *he is* a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all
things are become new.

<span id="xi.iii-p12"></span>**17.** Proinde si quis in Christo, nova
sit creatura,  <span id="fr_540"></span>[541](#fn_540.md) vetera
praeterierunt: ecce, nova facta sunt omnia.

<span id="xi.iii-p14"></span> 

<span id="xi.iii-p15"></span><span id="xi.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p16"></span>**13.** *Whether we are beside ourselves.*
This is said by way of concession; for Paul’s glorying was sane, or it
was, if we may so term it, a sober and most judicious madness;  <span
id="fr_541"></span>[542](#fn_541.md) but as he appeared foolish in the eyes
of many, he speaks according to their views. Now he declares two things:
in the *first* place, that he makes no account of himself, but has this
one object in view — that he may serve God and the Church; and,
*secondly,* that he fears not the opinion of men, so that he is prepared
for being reckoned either sane or insane, provided only he transacts
faithfully the affairs of God and the Church. The meaning, therefore, is
this: “As to my making mention so frequently of my integrity, persons
will take this as they choose. It is not, however, for my own sake that
I do it, but, on the contrary, I have God and the Church exclusively in
view. Hence I am prepared to be silent and to speak, according as the
glory of God and the advantage of the Church will require, and I shall
be quite contented that the world reckon me *beside myself,* provided
only it is not to myself, but to God, that I am *beside myself.*”  <span
id="fr_542"></span>[543](#fn_542.md) This is a passage that is deserving
not merely of notice, but also of constant meditation; for unless we
shall have our minds thus regulated, the smallest occasions of offense
will from time to time draw us off from our duty.

<span id="xi.iii-p21"></span><span id="xi.iii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p22"></span>**14.** *For the love of Christ.* The term
*love* may be taken either in a *passive* signification, or in an
*active.* I prefer the latter. For if we be not harder than iron, we
cannot refrain from devoting ourselves entirely to Christ, when we
consider what great love he exercised towards us, when he endured death
in our stead. Paul, too, explains himself when he adds, that it is
reasonable that we should *live to him,* being dead to ourselves. Hence,
as he had previously stated: (<span id="xi.iii-p22.1"></span>[2Co
5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011)<span id="xi.iii-p22.1"></span>,.md)
that he was stirred up to duty by fear, inasmuch as an account was one
day to be rendered by him, so he now brings forward another motive —
that measureless love of Christ towards us, of which he had furnished us
with an evidence in his death. “The knowledge,” I say, “of this love,
ought to *constrain* our affections, that they may go in no other
direction than that of loving him in return.

<span id="xi.iii-p23"></span>There is a metaphor  <span
id="fr_543"></span>[544](#fn_543.md) implied in the word *constrain,*
denoting that it is impossible but that every one that truly considers
and ponders that wonderful love, which Christ has manifested towards us
by his death, becomes, as it were, bound to him, and *constrained* by
the closest tie, and devotes himself wholly to his service.

<span id="xi.iii-p25"></span>*If one died for all.* This design is to be
carefully kept in view — that *Christ died for us, that we might die to
ourselves.* The exposition is also to be carefully noticed — that to
*die to ourselves is to live to Christ;* or if you would have it at
greater length, it is to renounce ourselves, that we may *live to
Christ;* for Christ. redeemed us with this view — that he might have us
under his authority, as his peculiar possession. Hence it follows that
we are no longer our own masters. There is a similar passage in <span
id="xi.iii-p25.1"></span>[Ro
14:7-9](../../../bib/kjv/rom014.htm#007.md)<span id="xi.iii-p25.1"></span>.
At the same time, there are two things that are here brought forward
separately — that we are dead in Christ, in order that all ambition and
eagerness for distinction may be laid aside, and that it may be felt by
us no hardship to be made as nothing; and farther, that we owe to Christ
our life and death, because he has wholly bound us to himself.  <span
id="fr_544"></span>[545](#fn_544.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p27"></span><span id="xi.iii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p28"></span>**16.** *Therefore we henceforth know no
man.* To *know,* here, is taken as meaning to *reckon.* “We do not judge
according to external appearance, so as to reckon that man to be the
most illustrious who seems so in appearance.” Under the term *flesh,* he
includes all external endowments which mankind are accustomed to hold in
estimation; and, in short, every thing which, apart from regeneration,
is reckoned worthy of praise. At the same time, he speaks more
particularly of outward disguise, or *appearance,* as it is termed. He
alludes, also, without doubt, to the death of which he had made mention.
“Since we ought, all of us, to be dead to the present life, nay more, to
be nothing in ourselves, no one must be reckoned a servant of Christ on
the ground of carnal excellence.”

<span id="xi.iii-p29"></span>*Nay, though we have known Christ.* The
meaning is — “Though Christ lived for a time in this world, and was
known by mankind in those things that have to do with the condition of
the present life, he must now be known in another way — *spiritually,*
so that we may have no worldly thoughts respecting him.” This passage is
perverted by some fanatics, such as Servetus,  <span
id="fr_545"></span>[546](#fn_545.md) for the purpose of proving, that
Christ’s human nature is now absorbed by the Divinity. But how very far
removed such a frenzy is from the Apostle’s intention, it is not
difficult to perceive; for he speaks here, not of the substance of his
body, but of external appearance, nor does he affirm that the flesh is
no longer perceived by us in Christ, but says, that Christ is not
*judged* of from that.  <span id="fr_546"></span>[547](#fn_546.md)

<span id="xi.iii-p32"></span>Scripture proclaims throughout, that Christ
does now as certainly lead a glorious life in our flesh, as he once
suffered in it.  <span id="fr_547"></span>[548](#fn_547.md) Nay more, take
away this foundation, and our whole faith falls to the ground; for
whence comes the hope of immortality, except from this, that we have
already a pattern  <span id="fr_548"></span>[549](#fn_548.md) of it in the
person of Christ? For as righteousness is restored to us on this ground,
that Christ, by fulfilling the law in our nature, has abolished Adam’s
disobedience, so also life has been restored to us by this means, that
he has opened up for our nature the kingdom of God, from which it had
been banished, and has given it a place in the heavenly dwelling. Hence,
if we do not now recognize Christ’s flesh,  <span
id="fr_549"></span>[550](#fn_549.md) we lose the whole of that confidence
and consolation that we ought to have in him. But we acknowledge Christ
as man, and as our brother in his flesh — not in a fleshly manner;
because we rest solely in the consideration of his spiritual gifts.
Hence he is spiritual to us, not as if he laid aside the body, and
became a spirit, but because he regenerates and governs his own people
by the influence of his Spirit.

<span id="xi.iii-p36"></span><span id="xi.iii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iii-p37"></span>**17.** *Therefore if any man is in
Christ.* As there is something wanting in this expression, it must be
supplied in this way — “*If any one* is desirous to hold some place *in
Christ,* that is, in the kingdom of Christ, or in the Church  <span
id="fr_550"></span>[551](#fn_550.md) let him be a *new creature* ” By this
expression he condemns every kind of excellence that is wont to be in
much esteem among men, if renovation of heart is wanting. “Learning*,*
it is true, and eloquence, and other endowments, are valuable, and
worthy to be honored; but, where the fear of the Lord and an upright
conscience are wanting, all the honor of them goes for nothing. Let no
one, therefore, glory in any distinction, inasmuch as the chief praise
of Christians is self-renunciation.”

<span id="xi.iii-p39"></span>Nor is this said merely for the purpose of
repressing the vanity of the false apostles, but also with the view of
correcting the ambitious judgments of the Corinthians, in which outward
disguises were of more value than real sincerity — though this is a
fault that is common to almost all ages. For where shall we find the man
that does not attach much more importance to show, than to true
holiness? Let us, therefore, keep in view this admonition — that all
that are not renewed by the Spirit of God, should be looked upon as
nothing in the Church, by whatever ornaments they may in other respects
be distinguished.

<span id="xi.iii-p40"></span>*Old things are passed away.* When the
Prophets speak of the kingdom of Christ, they foretell that there will
be *new heavens and a new earth,* (<span id="xi.iii-p40.1"></span>[Isa
65:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#017)<span id="xi.iii-p40.1"></span>,.md)
meaning thereby, that all things will be changed for the better, until
the happiness of the pious is completed. As, however, Christ’s kingdom
is spiritual, this change must take place chiefly in the Spirit, and
hence it is with propriety that he begins with this. There is,
therefore, an elegant and appropriate allusion, when Paul makes use of a
commendation of this kind, for the purpose of setting forth the value of
regeneration. Now by *old things* he means, the things that are not
formed anew by the Spirit of God. Hence this term is placed in contrast
with renewing grace. The expression *passed away,* he uses in the sense
of *fading away,* as things that are of short duration are wont to fall
off, when they have passed their proper season. Hence it is only the
*new man,* that flourishes and is vigorous  <span
id="fr_551"></span>[552](#fn_551.md) in the kingdom of Christ.

<span id="xi.iv"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p4"></span>**19.** To wit, that God was in Christ,

<span id="xi.iv-p11"></span><span id="xi.iv-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p12"></span>**18.** *All things are of God.* He means,
all things that belong to Christ’s kingdom. “If we would be Christ’s, we
must be regenerated by God. Now that is no ordinary gift.” He does not,
therefore, speak here of creation generally; but of the grace of
regeneration, which God confers peculiarly upon his elect, and he
affirms that it is *of God* — not on the ground of his being the Creator
and Artificer of heaven and earth, but inasmuch as he is the new Creator
of the Church, by fashioning his people anew, according to his own
image. Thus all flesh is abased, and believers are admonished that they
must now live to God, inasmuch as they are a *new creature.* (<span
id="xi.iv-p12.1"></span>[2Co 5:17](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#017.md)<span
id="xi.iv-p12.1"></span>.) This they cannot do, unless they forget the
world, as they are also no longer *of the world,* (<span
id="xi.iv-p12.2"></span>[Joh
17:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#016)<span id="xi.iv-p12.2"></span>,.md)
because they are *of God*

<span id="xi.iv-p13"></span>*Who hath reconciled us* Here there are
*two* leading points — the *one* relating to the reconciliation of men
with God; and the *other,* to the way in which we may enjoy the benefit
of this reconciliation. Now these things correspond admirably with what
goes before, for as the Apostle had given the preference to a good
conscience above every kind of distinction, (<span
id="xi.iv-p13.1"></span>[2Co 5:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#011.md)<span
id="xi.iv-p13.1"></span>,) he now shows that the whole of the gospel
tends to this. He shows, however, at the same time, the dignity of the
Apostolical office, that the Corinthians may be instructed as to what
they ought to seek in him, whereas they could not distinguish between
true and false ministers, for this reason, that nothing but show
delighted them. Accordingly, by making mention of this, he stirs them up
to make greater proficiency in the doctrine of the gospel. For an absurd
admiration of profane persons, who serve their own ambition rather than
Christ, originates in our not knowing, what the office of the preaching
of the gospel includes, or imports.

<span id="xi.iv-p14"></span>I now return to those *two leading points*
that are here touched upon. The first is — that God *hath reconciled us
to himself by Christ* This is immediately followed by the declaration —
*Because God was in Christ,* and has in his person accomplished
reconciliation. The manner is subjoined — *By not imputing unto men
their trespasses* Again, there is annexed a *second* declaration —
*Because Christ having been made a sin-offering for our sins, has
procured righteousness for us.* The *second* part of the statement is —
that the grace of reconciliation is applied to us by the gospel, that we
may become partakers of it. Here we have a remarkable passage, if there
be any such in any part of Paul’s writings. Hence it is proper, that we
should carefully examine the words one by one.

<span id="xi.iv-p15"></span>*The ministry of reconciliation* Here we
have an illustrious designation of the gospel, as being an embassy for
reconciling men to God. It is also a singular dignity of ministers —
that they are sent to us by God with this commission, so as to be
messengers, and in a manner sureties.  <span
id="fr_552"></span>[553](#fn_552.md) This, however, is not said so much for
the purpose of commending ministers, as with a view to the consolation
of the pious, that as often as they hear the gospel, they may know that
God treats with them, and, as it were, stipulates with them as to a
return to his grace. Than this blessing what could be more desirable?
Let us therefore bear in mind, that this is the main design of the
gospel — that whereas we are *by nature children of wrath,* (<span
id="xi.iv-p16.2"></span>[Eph 2:3](../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#003.md)<span
id="xi.iv-p16.2"></span>,) we may, by the breaking up of the quarrel
between God and us, be received by him into favor. Ministers are
furnished with this commission, that they may bring us intelligence of
so great a benefit, nay more, may assure us of God’s fatherly love
towards us. Any other person, it is true, might also be a witness to us
of the grace of God, but Paul teaches, that this office is specially
intrusted to ministers. When, therefore, a duly ordained minister
proclaims in the gospel, that God has been made propitious to us, he is
to be listened to just as an ambassador of God, and sustaining, as they
speak, a public character, and furnished with rightful authority for
assuring us of this.

<span id="xi.iv-p17"></span><span id="xi.iv-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p18"></span>**19.** *God was in Christ.* Some take this
as meaning simply — *God reconciled the world to himself in Christ;* but
the meaning is fuller and more *comprehensive* — *first,* that God was
in Christ; and, *secondly,* that he reconciled the world to himself by
his intercession. It is also of the Father that this is affirmed; for it
were an improper expression, were you to understand it as meaning, that
the divine nature of Christ was in him.  <span
id="fr_553"></span>[554](#fn_553.md) The Father, therefore, was in the Son,

10:38](../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#038)<span id="xi.iv-p20.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.iv-p21"></span>Therefore he that hath the Son, hath the
Father also. For Paul has made use of this expression with this view —
that we may learn to be satisfied with Christ alone, because in him we
find also God the Father, as he truly communicates himself to us by him.
Hence the expression is equivalent to this — “Whereas God had withdrawn
to a distance from us, he has drawn near to us in Christ, and thus
Christ has become to us the true Emmanuel, and his coming is God’s
drawing near to men.”

<span id="xi.iv-p22"></span>The *second* part of the statement points
out the office of Christ — his being *our propitiation,* (<span
id="xi.iv-p22.1"></span>[1Jo 2:2](../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#002.md)<span
id="xi.iv-p22.1"></span>,) because *out of Him,* God is displeased with
us all, inasmuch as we have revolted from righteousness.  <span
id="fr_554"></span>[555](#fn_554.md) For what purpose, then, has God
appeared to men in Christ? For the purpose of *reconciliation* — that,
hostilities being removed, those who were aliens, might be adopted as
sons. Now, although Christ’s coming as our Redeemer originated in the
fountain of Divine love towards us, yet until men perceive that God has
been propitiated by the Mediator, there must of necessity be a variance
remaining, with respect to them, which shuts them out from access to
God. On this point we shall speak more fully ere long.

<span id="xi.iv-p24"></span>*Not imputing to them.* Mark, in what way
men return into favor with God — when they are regarded as righteous, by
obtaining the remission of their sins. For so long as God imputes to us
our sins, He must of necessity regard us with abhorrence; for he cannot
be friendly or propitious to sinners. But this statement may seem to be
at variance with what is said elsewhere — that, we were loved by Him
before the creation of the world, (<span id="xi.iv-p24.1"></span>[Eph
1:4](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#004)<span id="xi.iv-p24.1"></span>,.md)
and still more with what he says, (<span id="xi.iv-p24.2"></span>[Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016)<span id="xi.iv-p24.2"></span>,.md)
that the love, which he exercised towards us was the reason, why He
expiated our sins by Christ, for the cause always goes before its
effect. I answer, that we were loved before the creation of the world,
but it was only *in Christ* In the mean time, however, I confess, that
the love of God was first in point of time, and of order, too, as to
God, but with respect to us, the commencement of his love has its
foundation in the sacrifice of Christ. For when we contemplate God
without a Mediator, we cannot conceive of Him otherwise than as angry
with us: a Mediator interposed between us, makes us feel, that He is
pacified towards us. As, however, this also is necessary to be known by
us — that Christ came forth to us from the fountain of God’s free mercy,
the Scripture explicitly teaches both — that the anger of the Father has
been appeased by the sacrifice of the Son, and that the Son has been
offered up for the expiation of the sins of men on this ground — because
God, exercising compassion towards them, receives them, on the ground of
such a pledge, into favor.  <span id="fr_555"></span>[556](#fn_555.md)

<span id="xi.iv-p26"></span>The whole may be summed up thus: “Where sin
is, *there* the anger of God is, and therefore God is not propitious to
us without, or before, his blotting out our sins, by not imputing them.
As our consciences cannot apprehend this benefit,  <span
id="fr_556"></span>[557](#fn_556.md) otherwise than through the
intervention of Christ’s sacrifice, it is not without good reason, that
Paul makes *that* the commencement and cause of reconciliation, with
regard to us.

<span id="xi.iv-p28"></span>*And hath committed to us.* Again he
repeats, that a commission has been given to the ministers of the gospel
to communicate to us this grace. For it might be objected, “Where is
Christ now, the peacemaker between God and us? At what a distance he
resides from us!” He says, therefore, that as he has *once suffered*,
 <span id="fr_557"></span>[558](#fn_557.md) (<span
id="xi.iv-p29.2"></span>[1Pe 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#018.md)<span
id="xi.iv-p29.2"></span>,) so he daily presents to us the fruit of his
suffering through means of the Gospel, which he designed, should be in
the world,  <span id="fr_558"></span>[559](#fn_558.md) as a sure and
authentic register of the reconciliation, that has once been effected.
It is the part of ministers, therefore, to apply to us, so to speak, the
fruit of Christ’s death.

<span id="xi.iv-p31"></span>Lest, however, any one should dream of a
magical application, such as Papists contrive,  <span
id="fr_559"></span>[560](#fn_559.md) we must carefully observe what he
immediately subjoins — that it consists wholly in the preaching of the
Gospel. For the Pope, along with his priests, makes use of this pretext
for giving a color of warrant for the whole of that wicked and execrable
system of merchandise, which they carry on, in connection with the
salvation of souls. “The Lord,” say they, “has furnished us with a
commission and authority to forgive sins.” This I acknowledge, provided
they discharge that embassy, of which Paul here makes mention. The
absolution, however, which they make use of in the Papacy, is entirely
magical; and besides, they inclose pardon of sins in lead and parchment,
or they connect it with fictitious and frivolous superstitions. What
resemblance do all these things bear to the appointment of Christ? Hence
the ministers of the Gospel restore us to the favor of God in a right
and orderly manner, when they bear testimony to us by means of the
Gospel as to the favor of God having been procured for us. Let this
*testimony* be removed, and nothing remains but mere imposture. Beware,
then, of placing even the smallest drop of your confidence on any thing
apart from the Gospel.

<span id="xi.iv-p33"></span>I do not, indeed, deny, that the grace of
Christ is applied to us in the sacraments, and that our reconciliation
with God is then confirmed in our consciences; but, as the testimony of
the Gospel is engraven upon the sacraments, they are not to be judged of
separately by themselves, but must be taken in connection with the
Gospel, of which they are appendages. In fine, the ministers of the
Church are *ambassadors,* for testifying and proclaiming the benefit of
*reconciliation,* only on this condition — that they speak from the
Gospel, as from an authentic register.

<span id="xi.iv-p34"></span><span id="xi.iv-p34.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p35"></span>**20.** *As if God did beseech you* This is
of no small importance for giving authority to the embassy: nay more, it
is absolutely necessary, for who would rest upon the testimony of men,
in reference to his eternal salvation? It is a matter of too much
importance, to allow of our resting contented with the promise of men,
without feeling assured that they are ordained by God, and that God
speaks to us by them. This is the design of those commendations, with
which Christ himself signalizes his Apostles:

<span id="xi.iv-p36"></span>He that heareth you, heareth me, etc. (<span
id="xi.iv-p36.1"></span>[Lu 10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016.md)<span
id="xi.iv-p36.1"></span>.)

<span id="xi.iv-p37"></span>Whatsoever you shall loose on earth, shall
be loosed in heaven, (<span id="xi.iv-p37.1"></span>[Mt
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018)<span id="xi.iv-p37.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="xi.iv-p38"></span>and the like.

<span id="xi.iv-p39"></span>*We entreat you, in Christ’s stead.* Hence
we infer, with what propriety Isaiah exclaims,

<span id="xi.iv-p40"></span>How blessed are the feet of them that preach
the Gospel!  
(<span id="xi.iv-p40.2"></span>[Isa
52:7](../../../bib/kjv/isa052.htm#007)<span id="xi.iv-p40.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.iv-p41"></span>For that one thing, that is of itself
sufficient for completing our felicity, and without which we are most
miserable, is conferred upon us, only through means of the Gospel. If,
however, this duty is enjoined upon all the ministers of the Church, in
such a way, that he who does not discharge this embassy is not to be
regarded either as an Apostle, or as a Pastor, we may very readily judge
from this, as to the nature of the Pope’s entire hierarchy. They are
desirous, indeed, to be looked upon as Apostles and Pastors; but as they
are dumb idols, how will their boasting  <span
id="fr_560"></span>[561](#fn_560.md) correspond with this passage of Paul’s
writings. The word *entreat* is expressive of an unparalleled  <span
id="fr_561"></span>[562](#fn_561.md) commendation of the grace of Christ,
inasmuch as He stoops so low, that he does not disdain to *entreat* us.
So much the less excusable is our depravity, if we do not, on meeting
with such kindness, show ourselves teachable and compliant.

<span id="xi.iv-p44"></span>*Be reconciled.* It is to be observed, that
Paul is here addressing himself to believers. He declares, that he
brings to them every day this embassy. Christ therefore, did not suffer,
merely that he might once expiate our sins, nor was the gospel appointed
merely with a view to the pardon of those sins which we committed
previously to baptism, but that, as we daily sin, so we might, also, by
a daily remission, be received by God into his favor. For this is a
continued embassy,  <span id="fr_562"></span>[563](#fn_562.md) which must
be assiduously sounded forth in the Church, till the end of the world;
and the gospel cannot be preached, unless remission of sins is promised.

<span id="xi.iv-p46"></span>We have here an express and suitable
declaration for refuting the impious tenet of Papists, which calls upon
us to seek the remission of sins after Baptism from some other source,
than from the expiation that was effected through the death of Christ.
Now this doctrine is commonly held in all the schools of Popery — that,
after baptism, we merit the remission of sins by penitence, through
means of the aid of the *keys,*  <span id="fr_563"></span>[564](#fn_563.md)
(<span id="xi.iv-p47.1"></span>[Mt
16:19](../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#019)<span id="xi.iv-p47.1"></span>,.md)
— as if baptism itself could confer this  <span
id="fr_564"></span>[565](#fn_564.md) upon us without penitence. By the term
*penitence,* however, they mean *satisfactions.* But what does Paul say
here? He calls us to go, not less *after* baptism, than *before* it, to
the one expiation made by Christ, that we may know that we always obtain
it gratuitously. Farther, all their prating as to the administration of
the *keys* is to no purpose, inasmuch as they conceive of *keys* apart
from the Gospel, while they are nothing else than that testimony of a
gratuitous reconciliation, which is made to us in the Gospel.

<span id="xi.iv-p49"></span><span id="xi.iv-p49.1"></span>

<span id="xi.iv-p50"></span>**21.** *Him who knew no sin.* Do you
observe, that, according to Paul, there is no return to favor with God,
except what is founded on the sacrifice of Christ alone? Let us learn,
therefore, to turn our views in that direction, whenever we desire to be
absolved from guilt. He now teaches more clearly, what we adverted to
above — that God is propitious to us, when he acknowledges us as
righteous. For these two things are equivalent — that we are acceptable
to God, and that we are regarded by him as righteous.

<span id="xi.iv-p51"></span>To *know no sin* is to be free from sin. He
says, then, that Christ, while he was entirely exempt from sin, was
*made sin for us.* It is commonly remarked, that *sin* here denotes an
expiatory sacrifice for sin, and in the same way the Latin’s term it,
<span id="xi.iv-p51.1"></span>*piaculum*  <span
id="fr_565"></span>[566](#fn_565.md) Paul, too, has in this, and other
passages, borrowed this phrase from the Hebrews, among whom <span
id="xi.iv-p52.2"></span>אשם (*asham*) denotes an *expiatory sacrifice,*
as well as an *offense* or *crime.*  <span
id="fr_566"></span>[567](#fn_566.md) But the signification of this word, as
well as the entire statement, will be better understood from a
comparison of both parts of the antithesis. *Sin* is here contrasted
with *righteousness,* when Paul teaches us, that *we were made the
righteousness of God,* on the ground of *Christ’s having been made sin.
Righteousness,* here, is not taken to denote a quality or habit, but by
way of imputation, on the ground of Christ’s righteousness being
reckoned to have been received by us. What, on the other hand, is
denoted by *sin?* It is the guilt, on account of which we are arraigned
at the bar of God. As, however, the curse of the individual was of old
cast upon the victim, so Christ’s condemnation was our absolution, and
*with his stripes we are healed.* (<span id="xi.iv-p53.3"></span>[Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005)<span id="xi.iv-p53.3"></span>..md)

<span id="xi.iv-p54"></span>*The righteousness of God in him* In the
first place, the *righteousness of God* is taken here to denote — not
that which is given us by God, but that which is approved of by him, as
in <span id="xi.iv-p54.1"></span>[Joh
12:43](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#043.md)<span id="xi.iv-p54.1"></span>,
the *glory of God* means — that which is in estimation with him — the
*glory of men* denotes the vain applause of the world. Farther, in <span
id="xi.iv-p54.2"></span>[Ro 3:23](../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#023.md)<span
id="xi.iv-p54.2"></span>, when he says, that we have *come short of the
glory of God,* he means, that there is nothing that we can glory in
before God, for it is no very difficult matter to appear righteous
before men, but it is a mere delusive appearance of righteousness, which
becomes at last the ground of perdition. Hence, *that* is the only true
righteousness, which is acceptable to God.

<span id="xi.iv-p55"></span>Let us now return to the contrast between
*righteousness* and *sin* How are we righteous in the sight of God? It
is assuredly in the same respect in which Christ was a sinner. For he
assumed in a manner our place, that he might be a criminal in our room,
and might be dealt with as a sinner, not for his own offenses, but for
those of others, inasmuch as he was pure and exempt from every fault,
and might endure the punishment that was due to us — not to himself. It
is in the same manner, assuredly, that we are now *righteous in him* —
not in respect of our rendering satisfaction to the justice of God by
our own works, but because we are judged of in connection with Christ’s
righteousness, which we have put on by faith, that it might become ours.
On this account I have preferred to retain the particle <span
id="xi.iv-p55.1"></span>ἐν, (*in,*) rather than substitute in its place
*per,* (*through,*) for that signification corresponds better with
Paul’s intention.  <span id="fr_567"></span>[568](#fn_567.md)

<span id="xi.i-p60"></span> “Concerning the import of the original term
<span id="xi.i-p60.1"></span>ὑπόστασις, translated *substance*, (<span
id="xi.i-p60.2"></span>[Heb 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001.md)<span
id="xi.i-p60.2"></span>,) there has been a good deal of discussion, and
it has been understood to signify *confidence* or *subsistence*. Faith
is the confidence of things hoped for; because it assures us, not only
that there are such things, but that, through the power and faithfulness
of God, we shall enjoy them. It is the *subsistence* of things hoped
for; because it gives them, although future, a present *subsistence* in
the minds of believers, so that they are influenced by them as if they
were actually present. Thus the word was understood by some of the Greek
commentators, who were the most competent judges of its meaning. ‘Since
things which we hope for,’ says Chrysostom, ‘seem not to subsist, faith
gives them subsistence, or rather it does not *give* it, but is itself
their substance. Thus the resurrection of the dead is not past, nor does
it subsist, but faith gives it subsistence in our souls.’ ‘Faith,’ says
another, ‘gives subsistence to the resurrection of the dead, and places
it before our eyes...’ The objects of faith are not only future good,
but invisible things, both good and evil, which are made known by divine
revelation; and of these it is the evidence, <span
id="xi.i-p60.3"></span>ἔλεγχος the *demonstration* or *conviction*...
Being past, and future, and invisible on account of their distance from
us, or the spirituality of their nature, they cannot be discovered by
our senses, but the conviction of their reality is as strong in the mind
of a believer, as if they were placed before his eyes.” — *Dick’s

severed from the people he belonged unto. The apostle considers himself,
while in the body, as living among such a sort of people as dwell in
bodies, a like sort of people to himself, and would be no longer a home
— dweller with them, but travel away from them, to join and be a dweller
with another people. For also, on the other hand, he considers, ‘with
the Lord,’ an invisible world where he resides, and an incorporeal
people he presides over.” — *Howe’s Works*, (Lond. 1834,) p. 1023. — Ed.

<span id="xi.iii-p20"></span>defends his speaking so much of his
integrity. Though some men would count him out of his wits for it, yet
he regards not their judgment; for if he were in an ecstasy, or beside
himself, his purpose was to serve God and his Church, and therefore he
did not regard the opinion of men, whether he were accounted mad or
sober, so he might perform the end of his Apostleship. The sense,
therefore, of it, as Calvin renders it, is this — ’Let men take it as
they will, that I speak so much of my integrity, I do it not upon my own
account, but have respect to God and the Church in speaking of it; for I
am as ready to be silent as to speak, when my silence may glorify God

<span id="xi.iii-p30"></span> The views held by Servetus respecting the
Supreme Being, and a Trinity of persons in the Godhead, “were obscure
and chimerical beyond all measure, and amounted, in general, to the
following propositions: — That the Deity, before the creation of the
world, had produced within himself two personal representations, or
manners of existence, which were to be the medium of intercourse between
him and mortals, and by whom, consequently, he was to reveal his will,
and to display his mercy and beneficence to the children of men; \[...\]
and that these two representations were to cease after the destruction
of this terrestrial globe, and to be *absorbed into the substance of the
Deity*, from whence they had been formed.” — *Moshem’s Ecclesiastical
History*, volume 4, pp. 475, 476. — *Ed.*

<span id="xi.iii-p31"></span> “He (Paul) remembered the words of his
Divine Master — ’Whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my
brother, and sister, and mother;’ and he was taught by them, that though
Christianity does not burst asunder the ties of kindred, it requires of
all its followers that they be guided by higher considerations in
advancing its interests. This may throw light on the bold expression
which we find him elsewhere using, when he is speaking of the
obligations which believers are under, ‘not to live to themselves, but
unto him which died for them, and rose again.’ ‘Henceforth know we no
man after the flesh; yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh,
yet now henceforth know we him no more.’“ — *M’Crie’s Sermons*, p. 21. —

imputatur. Ideo enim additurn est: <span id="xi.iv-p56.3"></span>ἐν αὐτῷ

ille est peccatum in nobis, nempe ex imputatione. Libet autem hic ex
Augustino locum insignem exscribere, velut istius commentarium
plenissimum. Sic igitur ille Serm. 5. de verbis Apostoli: *Deus Pater
eum, qui non noverat peccatum* (nempe Iesum Christum) *peccatum
effecit,ut nos simus justitia Dei* (non nostra) *in ipso* (non in
nobis.) His adde <span id="xi.iv-p56.5"></span>[Php
3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009.md)<span id="xi.iv-p56.5"></span>;” —
“Righteous before God, and that by a righteousness which is not inherent
in us, but which, being in Christ, is imputed to us by God through
faith. For it is on this account that it is added: <span
id="xi.iv-p56.6"></span>ἐν αὐτῷ (*in him*.) We are, therefore, the
righteousness of God in him in the same way as he is sin in us — by
imputation. I may here quote a remarkable passage from Augustine, as a
most complete commentary upon it. In Serm. 5 on the words of the Apostle
he expresses himself thus: *God the Father made him sin who had not
known sin*, (Jesus Christ,) *that we might be the righteousness of God*
(not our own) *in him* (not in ourselves.) To these add <span
id="xi.iv-p56.7"></span>[Php 3:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#009.md)<span
