<span id="xix-p1"></span>CHAPTER 13

<span id="xix.i"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p1"></span><span id="xix.i-p1.1"></span>[2 Corinthians
13:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#001.md)<span id="xix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p2"></span>**1.** This *is* the third *time* I am coming
to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be
established.

<span id="xix.i-p3"></span>**1.** Hic tertius erit adventus meus ad vos.
In ore duorum aut trium testium stabilietur omne verbum. (<span
id="xix.i-p3.1"></span>[Deut. 19:5](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#005.md),
[Matt. 18:16](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#016.md), [John
8:17](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#017.md), [Heb.
10:28](../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#028)<span id="xix.i-p3.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.i-p4"></span>**2.** I told you before, and foretell you,
as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to
them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come
again, I will not spare:

<span id="xix.i-p5"></span>**2.** Praedixi et praedico, ut praesens quum
essem iterum, ita et absens nunc scribo iis, qui ante peccaverunt, et
reliquis omnibus: quod, si venero denuo, non parcam.

<span id="xix.i-p6"></span>**3.** Since ye seek a proof of Christ
speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.

<span id="xix.i-p7"></span>**3.** Quandoquidem esperimentum quaeritis in
me loquentis Christi: qui erga vos non est infirmus, sed potens est in
vobis.

<span id="xix.i-p8"></span>**4.** For though he was crucified through
weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in
him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.

<span id="xix.i-p9"></span>**4.** Nam quamvis crucifixus fuit ex
infirmitate, vivit tamen ex virtute Dei: siquidem et nos infirmi sumus
in illo, sed vivmus cum illo ex virtute Dei erga vos.

<span id="xix.i-p10"></span> 

<span id="xix.i-p11"></span><span id="xix.i-p11.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p12"></span>**1.** *This will be the third.* He goes on
to reprove still farther the insolence of those of whom he had been
speaking, some of whom living in profligacy and licentiousness, and
others, carrying on contentions and strifes among themselves, cared
nothing for his reproof. For his discourse did not apply to the entire
body of the Church, but to certain diseased and half-rotten members of
it. Hence he now, with greater freedom, uses sharpness, because he has
to do with particular individuals, not with the whole body of the
people, and besides this, it was with persons of such a stamp, that he
perceived, that he would do them no good by kindness, and mild remedies.
After having spent a year and a half among them, (<span
id="xix.i-p12.1"></span>[Ac 18:11](../../../bib/kjv/act018.htm#011.md)<span
id="xix.i-p12.1"></span>,) he had visited them a *second* time. Now he
forewarns them, that he will come to them a *third* time, and he says,
that his three comings to them will be in the place of three witnesses.
He quotes the law as to the authority of witnesses; not in the natural
and literal sense, as it is termed, but by accommodation,  <span
id="fr_942"></span>[943](#fn_942.md) or similitude, applying it to his
particular purpose.

<span id="xix.i-p14"></span>“The declaration of the law,” says he, “is,
that we must rest on the testimony of *two or three witnesses* for
putting an end to disputes.”  <span id="fr_943"></span>[944](#fn_943.md)
(<span id="xix.i-p15.1"></span>[De
19:15](../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015)<span id="xix.i-p15.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.i-p16"></span>For the word *established* means that a
decision is pronounced respecting a matter, that the strife may cease.
“I, indeed, am but one individual, but coming a *third* time I shall
have the authority of *three* witnesses, or, my three comings will be in
the place of three testimonies.” For the threefold effort that was made
for their welfare, and perseverance, as made trial of on three different
occasions, might, with good reason, be held equivalent to three persons.

<span id="xix.i-p17"></span><span id="xix.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p18"></span>**2.** *I told you before, and foretell
you.* The friendly and agreeable admonitions, that he had addressed to
them so frequently, had been of no advantage. He, accordingly, betakes
himself to a more severe remedy, with which he had previously threatened
them in words when present with them. When we see him act with so much
strictness, we need have no doubt, that they were surprisingly
ungovernable and obstinate; for it appears from his writings, what
mildness, and what unwearied patience he was otherwise prepared to
manifest. As, however, it is the part of a good parent to forgive and
bear with many things, so it is the part of a foolish parent, and one
that has no proper regard for the welfare of his children, to neglect to
use severity, when there is occasion for it, and to mingle strictness
with mildness. We are well aware, that nothing is more hurtful than
excessive indulgence  <span id="fr_944"></span>[945](#fn_944.md) Let us,
therefore, use mildness, when we can safely do so, and that too,
dignified and properly regulated: let us act with greater severity, when
necessity requires.

<span id="xix.i-p20"></span>It is asked, however, why it was, that the
Apostle allowed himself to expose the particular faults of individuals
in so open a manner, as in a manner to point his finger at the very
persons? I answer, that he would never have done so, if the sins had
been hid, but as they were manifest to all, and matter of notoriety, so
as to furnish a pernicious example, it was necessary that he should not
spare the authors of a public scandal.  <span
id="fr_945"></span>[946](#fn_945.md)

<span id="xix.i-p22"></span>It is asked, *secondly,* what kind of
chastisement he threatens to inflict upon them, as he could scarcely
chastise them more severely in words. I have no doubt that he means,
that he will inflict punishment upon them by excommunication. For what
is more to be dreaded, than being cut off from the body of Christ,
expelled from the kingdom of God, and *delivered over to Satan for
destruction,* (<span id="xix.i-p22.1"></span>[1Co
5:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#005)<span id="xix.i-p22.1"></span>,.md)
unless you repent?

<span id="xix.i-p23"></span><span id="xix.i-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p24"></span>**3.** *Since ye seek a proof* A twofold
meaning may be drawn from these words. The *first* is, “Since you wish
to try me, whether I speak of myself, or whether Christ speaks by me;*”*
and in this way Chrysostom, and Ambrose, explain it. I am rather
inclined, however, to understand him as declaring, that it does not so
much concern himself as Christ, when his authority is detracted from —
that when his admonitions are despised, Christ’s patience is tried. “It
is Christ that speaks by me; when therefore, you bring my doctrine under
your lash, it is not so much to me as to him that you do injury.”

<span id="xix.i-p25"></span>Some one, however, will object thus: “What!
Will a man’s doctrine, then, be exempted from all investigation, so soon
as he makes it his boast, that he has Christ as his authority? And what
false prophet will not make this his boast? What distinction, then, will
there be between truth and falsehood, and what will, in that case,
become of that injunction:

<span id="xix.i-p26"></span>Try the spirits, whether they are of God.”
(<span id="xix.i-p26.1"></span>[1Jo
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#001)<span id="xix.i-p26.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.i-p27"></span>Every objection of this nature Paul
anticipates, when he says that Christ has wrought efficaciously in them
by his ministry. For these two clauses, *Christ speaking in me,* and,
*who is mighty in you, not weak,* must be read in connection, in this
sense: “Christ, by exercising his power towards you in my doctrine, has
declared that he spoke by my mouth, so that you have no excuse on the
ground of ignorance.”

<span id="xix.i-p28"></span>We see, that he does not merely boast in
words, but proves in reality that Christ speaks in him, and he convinces
the Corinthians, before requiring them to give him credit. Whoever,
then, will speak in the Church, whatever be the title that he claims for
himself, it will be allowable to inquire as to his doctrine, until
Christ has manifested himself in him, and thus it will not be of Christ
that judgment will be formed, but of the man. When, however, it is
apparent, that it is the word of God that is advanced, what Paul says
holds good — that it is God himself who is not believed  <span
id="fr_946"></span>[947](#fn_946.md) Moses spake with the same confidence.
(<span id="xix.i-p29.2"></span>[Nu
16:11](../../../bib/kjv/num016.htm#011)<span id="xix.i-p29.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.i-p30"></span>What are we — I and Aaron? You are tempting
God.

<span id="xix.i-p31"></span>In like manner, Isaiah:

<span id="xix.i-p32"></span>Is it too small a thing that you grieve
men,  
unless you grieve my God also? (<span id="xix.i-p32.2"></span>[Isa
7:13](../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#013)<span id="xix.i-p32.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.i-p33"></span>For there is no more room for shuffling,
when it has been made apparent, that it is a minister of God that
speaks, and that he discharges his office faithfully. I return to Paul.
As the confirmation of his ministry had been so decided among the
Corinthians, inasmuch as the Lord had shown himself openly, it is not to
be wondered, if he takes it so much amiss, that he meets with
resistance. On good grounds, truly,  <span
id="fr_947"></span>[948](#fn_947.md) might he throw back upon them, as he
does, the reproach, that they were rebels against Christ.

<span id="xix.i-p35"></span><span id="xix.i-p35.1"></span>

<span id="xix.i-p36"></span>**4.** *For though he was crucified.* He
speaks, with particular intention, of Christ’s abasement, with the view
of intimating indirectly,  <span id="fr_948"></span>[949](#fn_948.md) that
nothing was despised in him, but what they would have been prepared to
despise, also, in Christ himself, inasmuch as he

<span id="xix.i-p38"></span>emptied himself, even to the death of the
cross.  
(<span id="xix.i-p38.2"></span>[Php
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#008)<span id="xix.i-p38.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.i-p39"></span>He shows, however, at the same time, how
absurd it is to despise in Christ  <span
id="fr_949"></span>[950](#fn_949.md) the abasement of the cross, inasmuch
as it is conjoined with the incomparable glory of his resurrection.
“Shall Christ be esteemed by you the less, because he showed signs of
weakness in his death, as if his heavenly life, that he leads
subsequently to his resurrection, were not a clear token of his Divine
power?” For as the term *flesh* here means Christ’s human nature,  <span
id="fr_950"></span>[951](#fn_950.md) so the word *God* is taken here to
denote his Divinity.

<span id="xix.i-p42"></span>Here, however, a question arises — whether
Christ labored under such infirmity as to be subjected to necessity
against his will; for, what we suffer *through weakness,* we suffer from
constraint, and not from our own choice. As the Arians of old abused
this pretext for effectually opposing the divinity of Christ, the
orthodox Fathers gave this explanation of it — that it was effected by
appointment, inasmuch as Christ so desired, and not from his being
constrained by any necessity. This answer is true, provided it be
properly understood. There are some, however, that mistakenly extend the
appointment to Christ’s human will — as if this were not the condition
of his nature, but a permission contrary to his nature. For example:
“His dying,” they say, “did not happen because his humanity was,
properly speaking, liable to death, but by appointment, because he chose
to die.” I grant, indeed, that he died, because he chose to do so; but,
whence came this choice, but from this — that he had, of his own accord,
clothed himself with a mortal nature  <span
id="fr_951"></span>[952](#fn_951.md) If, however, we make Christ’s human
nature so unlike ours, the main support of our faith is overturned. Let
us, therefore, understand it in this way — that Christ suffered by
appointment, not by constraint, because, *being in the form of God* he
could have exempted himself from this necessity, but, nevertheless, he
suffered *through weakness,* because he *emptied himself* (<span
id="xix.i-p43.2"></span>[Php 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#006.md)<span
id="xix.i-p43.2"></span>.)

<span id="xix.i-p44"></span>*We are weak in him.* To be *weak in Christ*
means here to be a partaker of Christ’s weakness. Thus he makes his own
weakness glorious, because in it he is conformed to Christ, and he no
longer shrinks back from the disgrace, that he has in common with the
Son of God; but, in the mean time, he says that he will *live towards
them* after Christ’s example. “I also,” says he, “will be a partaker of
Christ’s life, after I shall have been exempted from weakness.”  <span
id="fr_952"></span>[953](#fn_952.md) To *weakness* he opposes *life,* and,
accordingly, he understands by this term a condition that is
flourishing, and full of honor.  <span id="fr_953"></span>[954](#fn_953.md)
The clause *towards you* may also be taken in connection with the *power
of God,* but it is of no importance, as the meaning always remains the
same — that the Corinthians, when they began to judge aright, would have
respectful and honorable views of the power of God, which was in Paul,
and would no longer despise outward infirmity.

<span id="xix.ii"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p1"></span><span id="xix.ii-p1.1"></span>[2 Corinthians
13:5-9](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#005.md)<span id="xix.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p2"></span>**5.** Examine yourselves, whether ye be in
the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that
Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?

<span id="xix.ii-p3"></span>**5.** Vosmet iposo tentate, num sitis in
fide: vos ipsos probate. Annon cognoscitis vosmet ipsos, quod Iesus
Christus in vobis est, nisi si cubi reprobi estis?

<span id="xix.ii-p4"></span>**6.** But I trust that ye shall know that
we are not reprobates.

<span id="xix.ii-p5"></span>**6.** At spero vos cognituros, quod nos non
simus reprobi.

<span id="xix.ii-p6"></span>**7.** Now I pray to God that ye do no evil;
not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is
honest, though we be as reprobates.

<span id="xix.ii-p7"></span>**7.** Opto autem apud Deum, ne quid male
faciatis; non quo nos probati appareamus, sed ut vos quod honestum est
faciatis, nos vero veluti reprobi sumus.

<span id="xix.ii-p8"></span>**8.** For we can do nothing against the
truth, but for the truth.

<span id="xix.ii-p9"></span>**8.** Non enim possumus quicquam adversus
veritatem, sed pro veritate.

<span id="xix.ii-p10"></span>**9.** For we are glad, when we are weak,
and ye are strong: and this also we wish, *even* your perfection.

<span id="xix.ii-p11"></span>**9.** Gaudemus enim, quum nos infirmi
fuerimus, vos autem validi fueritis: hoc vero etiam optamus, vestram
integritatem.

<span id="xix.ii-p12"></span> 

<span id="xix.ii-p13"></span><span id="xix.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p14"></span>**5.** *Try yourselves.* He confirms, what
he had stated previously — that Christ’s power showed itself openly in
his ministry. For he makes them the judges of this matter, provided they
descend, as it were, into themselves, and acknowledge what they had
received from him. In the first place, as there is but one Christ, it
must be of necessity, that the same Christ must dwell alike in minister
and people. Now, dwelling in the people, how will he deny himself in the
minister.  <span id="fr_954"></span>[955](#fn_954.md) Farther, he had shown
his power in Paul’s preaching, in such a manner that it could be no
longer doubtful or obscure to the Corinthians, if they were not
altogether stupid.  <span id="fr_955"></span>[956](#fn_955.md) For, whence
had they faith? whence had they Christ? whence, in fine, had they every
thing? It is with good reason, therefore, that they are called to look
into themselves, that they may discover there, what they despise as a
thing unknown. *Then* only has a minister a true and well grounded
assurance for the approbation of his doctrine, when he can appeal to the
consciences of those whom he has taught, that, if they have any thing of
Christ, and of sincere piety, they may be constrained to acknowledge his
fidelity. We are now in possession of Paul’s object.

<span id="xix.ii-p17"></span>This passage, however, is deserving of
particular observation on two accounts. For, in the *first* place, it
shows the relation,  <span id="fr_956"></span>[957](#fn_956.md) which
subsists between the faith of the people, and the preaching of the
minister — that the one is the mother, that produces and brings forth,
and the other is the daughter, that ought not to forget her origin.
 <span id="fr_957"></span>[958](#fn_957.md) In the *second* place, it
serves to prove the assurance of faith, as to which the Sorbonnic
sophists have made us stagger, nay more, have altogether rooted out from
the minds of men. They charge with rashness all that are persuaded that
they are the members of Christ, and have Him remaining in them, for they
bid us be satisfied with a “moral conjecture,”  <span
id="fr_958"></span>[959](#fn_958.md) as they call it — that is, with a mere
opinion  <span id="fr_959"></span>[960](#fn_959.md) so that our consciences
remain constantly in suspense, and in a state of perplexity. But what
does Paul say here? He declares, that all are *reprobates,* who doubt
whether they profess Christ and are a part of His body. Let us,
therefore, reckon *that* alone to be right faith, which leads us to
repose in safety in the favor of God, with no wavering opinion, but with
a firm and steadfast assurance.

<span id="xix.ii-p22"></span>*Unless by any means you are reprobates.*
He gives them in a manner their choice, whether they would rather be
*reprobates,* than give due testimony to his ministry; for he leaves
them no alternative, but either to show *respect* to his Apostleship, or
to allow that they are *reprobates.* For, unquestionably, their faith
had been founded upon his doctrine, and they had no other Christ, than
they had received from him, and no other gospel than what they had
embraced, as delivered to them by him, so that it were vain for them to
attempt to separate any part of their salvation from his praise.

<span id="xix.ii-p23"></span><span id="xix.ii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p24"></span>**6.** *I hope that you shall know* He
presses them still more urgently, while indulging this confident
persuasion — that he will not be rejected by the Corinthians. One of two
things was necessary — that they should either assign to Paul the honor
due to an Apostle, or condemn themselves for unbelief, and acknowledge
that they have no Church. He softens, however, the severity of the
statement, by making use of the expression — I *hope;* but in such a
manner as to remind them the better of their duty; for to disappoint the
hopes that have been entertained as to our integrity, is excessively
cruel. “I hope,” says he, “that you shall know — when you have been
restored to a sound mind.” He prudently, however, says nothing as to
himself in this second clause, calling them to consider God’s benefits,
by which they had been distinguished; nay more, he puts their salvation
in the place of his authority.

<span id="xix.ii-p25"></span><span id="xix.ii-p25.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p26"></span>**7.** *I desire before God.* Again he
*declares,* that he cares nothing for his own honor, but is simply
desirous of promoting their advantage. For nothing was so undesirable
for them, as to deprive themselves of advantage from his doctrine — as
they had begun to do, through their pride and contempt. “As to myself,”
says he, “for my reputation among men, I am not concerned. My only fear
is, lest you should offend God. Nay more, I am prepared to be as a
*reprobate,* provided you are free from all blame.” “I am a
*reprobate,”* says he, “in the judgment of mankind, who very frequently
reject those who are deserving of the highest honor.”  <span
id="fr_960"></span>[961](#fn_960.md) At the same time, the particle *as* is
not superfluous. For it corresponds with what he says elsewhere — *as
deceivers and yet true.* (<span id="xix.ii-p27.2"></span>[2Co
6:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#008)<span id="xix.ii-p27.2"></span>..md)
And this, certainly, is the true rule — that the Pastor, having no
regard to himself, should be devoted exclusively to the edification of
the Church. Let him be concerned as to his own reputation, in so far as
he sees it to be conducive to the public advantage. Let him be prepared
to feel indifferent to it, whenever he may do so, without public
disadvantage.

<span id="xix.ii-p28"></span><span id="xix.ii-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p29"></span>**8.** *For we can do nothing*: That is —
“I do not seek, or desire any other power, than what the Lord has
conferred upon me, that I may promote the truth. To false Apostles it is
all one, provided they have power; and they feel no concern to make use
of their power for the promotion of what is good.” In short, he defends
and maintains the honor of his ministry, in so far as it is connected
with the truth of God. “What does it matter to me? For unless I have in
view to promote the truth, all the power that I shall claim will be
false and groundless. If, however, I lay out, whatever I have, for the
promotion of the truth, I, in that case, do not consult my own interest.
Now, when the authority of doctrine is safe, and truth is uninjured, I
have what I desire. In contending, therefore, so keenly, I am not
influenced by any exclusive regard for myself personally.” By this
consideration, however, he intimates, that the man, who fights and
labors for the truth alone will not take it amiss, should occasion
require it, to be regarded in the judgment of men as a *reprobate,*
provided this does not interfere with the glory of God, the edification
of the Church, and the authority of sound doctrine.

<span id="xix.ii-p30"></span>This passage must be carefully observed,
because it limits the power, which the Pastors of the Church should
have, and fixes its proper bounds — that they be ministers of the truth.
Papists loudly tell us, that it is said,

<span id="xix.ii-p31"></span>He that heareth you, heareth me;  
he that despiseth you, despiseth me, (<span id="xix.ii-p31.2"></span>[Lu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016)<span id="xix.ii-p31.2"></span>.md);

<span id="xix.ii-p32"></span>and likewise:

<span id="xix.ii-p33"></span>Obey them that are set over you, (<span
id="xix.ii-p33.1"></span>[Heb
13:17](../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#017)<span id="xix.ii-p33.1"></span>.md);

<span id="xix.ii-p34"></span>and under this pretext they take to
themselves the utmost liberty, so as to usurp unbounded dominion, while
they are, at the same time, the avowed and sworn enemies of the truth,
and aim at its destruction by every means in their power. For exposing
such impudence, this one statement of Paul will suffice — which
declares, that they must themselves be in subjection to the truth.
 <span id="fr_961"></span>[962](#fn_961.md)

<span id="xix.ii-p36"></span><span id="xix.ii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="xix.ii-p37"></span>**9.** *For, we rejoice.* Either the causal
particle <span id="xix.ii-p37.1"></span>γὰρ, (*for,*) must be taken as
meaning — *therefore;* or it is a second reason, why he does not refuse
to be regarded as a *reprobate* — for their sake, and with a view to
their advantage. Let the reader select whichever he may choose, for it
is of no consequence.  <span id="fr_962"></span>[963](#fn_962.md) When he
says, *Provided you are strong, I shall willingly submit to be reckoned
weak,* there is an antithesis in the words — not in the meaning; for
*weakness* means here, as formerly, (<span id="xix.ii-p38.2"></span>[2Co
13:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004)<span id="xix.ii-p38.2"></span>,.md)
*contempt.* On the other hand, he means that the Corinthians will be
*strong,* if they are full of the power and grace of God.

<span id="xix.ii-p39"></span>*And this also,* He now again repeats, what
he had already stated several times, that he was from necessity — not
from his own inclination, more severe than they would have wished; and
farther, that by this means, *too,*  <span
id="fr_963"></span>[964](#fn_963.md) he *spared* them, that he might not be
constrained to resort to severer measures, when he was present with
them.

<span id="xix.ii-p41"></span>The *perfection,* of which he speaks,
consists in a fit proportion, and sound condition, of all the members.
Now  <span id="fr_964"></span>[965](#fn_964.md) he alludes to good
physicians, who cure particular diseases in such a way as not in any
part to mutilate the body;  <span id="fr_965"></span>[966](#fn_965.md) and,
as he is concerned to secure a perfection of this nature, he says, that,
for that reason, he provides against the necessity of having recourse to
severer measures.  <span id="fr_966"></span>[967](#fn_966.md) For we see,
that those, who at first shrink back from the slight pain, or uneasy
feeling of a plaster, are at length constrained to endure the torture of
burning, or amputating, and that, too, where the issue is extremely
doubtful.  <span id="fr_967"></span>[968](#fn_967.md)

<span id="xix.iii-p2"></span>**10.** Therefore I write these things
being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to
the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to
destruction.

of love and peace shall be with you.

<span id="xix.iii-p13"></span>The second epistle to the Corinthians was
written from Philippi, a city of Macedonia, by Titus and Lucas.

<span id="xix.iii-p14"></span>*Ad Corinthios secumda missa fuit a
Philippis Macedoniae* — *per Titum et Lucam.*

<span id="xix.iii-p15"></span> 

<span id="xix.iii-p16"></span><span id="xix.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p17"></span>**10.** *According to the power* In the
*first* place, he arms the strictness of which he speaks, with the
authority of God, that it may not appear to be thunder without
lightning, or a rashly excited onset.  <span
id="fr_969"></span>[970](#fn_969.md) Farther, he lets them know, that he
would rather employ his power to another purpose, for which it was
peculiarly designed — the promoting of their edification. “I shall not
rashly have recourse to cruel remedies, nor will I give indulgence to my
passion, but will simply execute the commission that the Lord has given
me.”

<span id="xix.iii-p19"></span>When he speaks of *power given him for
edification, and not for destruction,* he employs these terms for a
somewhat different purpose from what he had done previously in <span
id="xix.iii-p19.1"></span>[2Co
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#008.md)<span id="xix.iii-p19.1"></span>.
For in that passage there was a commendation of the Gospel from the
advantage it yields — because what is for our advantage is wont to be
agreeable, and is willingly received by us. Here, however, he simply
means to declare, that although he might justly inflict upon the
Corinthians a severe blow, yet it was much more his inclination to
exercise his power for their *advantage,* than for their *destruction* —
the former being its proper design. For as the Gospel, in its own
nature, is the *power of God unto salvation,* (<span
id="xix.iii-p19.2"></span>[Ro
1:16](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#016)<span id="xix.iii-p19.2"></span>,.md)
and an *odor of life unto life,* (<span id="xix.iii-p19.3"></span>[2
Cor. 2:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#015.md),
[16](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#016)<span id="xix.iii-p19.3"></span>,.md)
but in a way of contingency, is an *odor of death;* so the authority,
which is conferred upon the Ministers of it, ought to be salutary to the
hearers. If, on the other hand, it turns out to their condemnation, that
is contrary to its nature. The meaning, therefore, is this: “Do not,
through your own fault, allow *that* to turn to your destruction, which
God has appointed for salvation.” In the mean time, the Apostle
admonishes all pastors by his example, in what manner they should limit
the use of their power.

<span id="xix.iii-p20"></span><span id="xix.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p21"></span>**11.** *Finally, brethren* He qualifies
whatever there has been of sharpness throughout the whole of the
epistle, as he did not wish to leave their minds in an exasperated
state,  <span id="fr_970"></span>[971](#fn_970.md) but rather to soothe
them. For *then* only are reproofs beneficial, when they are in a manner
seasoned with honey, that the hearer may, if possible, receive them in
an agreeable spirit. At the same time, he appears to turn from a few
diseased persons  <span id="fr_971"></span>[972](#fn_971.md) to the entire
Church. Hence he declares*,* that he aims at promoting its *perfection,*
and desires its consolation.

<span id="xix.iii-p24"></span>To *be of one mind,* and to *live in
peace,* are expressions which mean two different things; for the one
takes its rise from the other. The *former* relates to agreement of
sentiment; the *latter* denotes benevolence, and union of hearts.

<span id="xix.iii-p25"></span>*And the God of peace* This he adds, that
his exhortation may have more weight with them, but, at the same time,
he intimates that God will be with us, if we cultivate peace among
ourselves; but that those that are at variance with each other are at a
distance from him.  <span id="fr_972"></span>[973](#fn_972.md) For where
there are strifes and contentions, *there,* it is certain, the devil
reigns.

<span id="xix.iii-p28"></span>Now what agreement is there between light
and darkness?  
(<span id="xix.iii-p28.2"></span>[2Co
6:14](../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#014)<span id="xix.iii-p28.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.iii-p29"></span>He calls him the *God of peace and love,*
because he has recommended to us peace and love, because he loves them,
and is the author of them. Of the *kiss* here mentioned we have spoken
in the two preceding Epistles.

<span id="xix.iii-p30"></span><span id="xix.iii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xix.iii-p31"></span>**14.** *The grace of the Lord Jesus.* He
closes the Epistle with a prayer, which contains three clauses, in which
the sum of our salvation consists. In the *first* place, he desires for
them the *grace of Christ; secondly,* the *love of God;* and, *thirdly,*
the *communion of the Spirit* The term *grace* does not here mean
unmerited favor, but is taken by metonymy, to denote the whole benefit
of redemption. The order, however, may appear to be here inverted,
because the *love of God* is placed *second,* while it is the source of
that grace, and hence it is *first* in order. I answer, that the
arrangement of terms in the Scriptures is not always so very exact; but,
at the same time, this order, too, corresponds with the common form of
doctrine, which is contained in the Scriptures — that

<span id="xix.iii-p32"></span>when we were enemies to God,  
we were reconciled by the death of his Son, (<span
id="xix.iii-p32.2"></span>[Ro
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010)<span id="xix.iii-p32.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="xix.iii-p33"></span>though the Scripture is wont to speak of
this in two ways. For it sometimes declares what I have quoted from Paul
— that there was enmity between us and God, before we were reconciled
through Christ. On the other hand, we hear what John says — that

<span id="xix.iii-p34"></span>God so loved the world, that he gave his
only-begotten Son, etc. (<span id="xix.iii-p34.1"></span>[Joh
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#016)<span id="xix.iii-p34.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xix.iii-p35"></span>The statements are apparently opposite;
but it is easy to reconcile them; because in the one case we look to
God, and in the other to ourselves. For God, viewed in himself, loved us
before the creation of the world, and redeemed us for no other reason
than this — because he loved us. As for us, on the other hand, as we see
in ourselves nothing but occasion of wrath, that is, sin, we cannot
apprehend any love of God towards us without a Mediator. Hence it is
that, with respect to us, the beginning of love is from the grace of
Christ. According to the former view of the matter, Paul would have
expressed himself improperly, had he put the love of God before the
grace of Christ, or, in other words, the cause before the effect; but
according to the latter, it were a suitable arrangement to begin with
the grace of Christ, which was the procuring cause of God’s adopting us
into the number of his sons, and honoring us with his love, whom
previously he regarded with hatred and abhorrence on account of sin.

<span id="xix.iii-p36"></span>The *fellowship of the Holy Spirit* is
added, because it is only under his guidance, that we come to possess
Christ, and all his benefits. He seems, however, at the same time, to
allude to the diversity of gifts, of which he had made mention
elsewhere, (<span id="xix.iii-p36.1"></span>[2Co
12:11](../../../bib/kjv/co2012.htm#011.md)<span
id="xix.iii-p36.1"></span>;) because God does not give the Spirit to
every one in a detached way, but distributes to each according to the
measure of grace, that the members of the Church, by mutually
participating, one with another, may cherish unity.

<span id="xix.i-p21"></span> It might almost seem as if Baxter must have
had this passage of Calvin in his eye, when penning his celebrated
apology for animadverting so freely on the faults of the ministers of
religion in his times. “If it should be objected, that I should not have
spoken so plainly and sharply against the sins of the ministry, or that
I should not have published it to the view of the world, or, at least,
that I should have done it in another tongue, and not in the ears of the
vulgar. When the sin is open in the sight of the world, it is in vain to
attempt to hide it; and when the sin is public, the confession should
also be public. If the ministers of England had sinned only in Latin, I
would have made shift to have admonished them in Latin, or else should
have said nothing to them. But if they will sin in English, they must
hear of it in *English.*” — *Baxter’s* Reformed Pastor, (Glasgow, 1829,)

<span id="xix.ii-p21"></span> “<span id="xix.ii-p21.1"></span>D’vne

Rhemish Translators, when commenting on this *very* passage, take
occasion to oppose the idea of the attainableness of assurance of faith.
“The Heretiques,” say they, “argue hereupon, that every one may know
himself certainly to be in grace; where the Apostle speaketh expressly
and onely of faith, the act whereof a man may know and feele to be in
himself, because it is an act of understanding, though he cannot be
assured that he hath his sinnes remitted, and that he is in all pointes
in a state of grace and salvation; because euery man that is of the
Catholike faith is not alwaies of good life and agreeable thereunto, nor
the acts of our will so subject to understanding, that we can knowe
certainely whether we be good or euill.” Dr. Fulke, in his Refutation of
the errors of the Rhemish Doctors, (Loud. 1601,) p. 584, after
furnishing suitable replies to the arguments thus advanced, concludes by
remarking, that “our certeintie dependeth not upon our will or workes,
but upon the promise of God through faith, that Christ is in us, and we
in him, therefore we shall not misse of the performance of his
promises.” — Ed.

comparing, however, this verse with a subsequent one, I am of opinion
that Paul by this term simply means, that it was his design, that those
members of the Corinthian Church which had been dislocated, as it were,
having been restored to their proper place, the entire body should be
renovated by the members being mutually connected together, (as in <span
