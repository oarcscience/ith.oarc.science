<span id="xvi-p1"></span>CHAPTER 10

<span id="xvi.i"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p1"></span><span id="xvi.i-p1.1"></span>[2 Corinthians
10:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#001.md)<span id="xvi.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p2"></span>**1.** Now I Paul myself beseech you by the
meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence *am* base among you,
but being absent am bold toward you:

<span id="xvi.i-p3"></span>**1.** Pro ipse ego Paulus exhortor vos
 <span id="fr_737"></span>[738](#fn_737.md) per lenitatem et mansuetudinem
Christi, qui secundum faciem humilis quidem sum inter vos, absens autem
audax sum in vos.

<span id="xvi.i-p5"></span>**2.** But I beseech *you*, that I may not be
bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be
bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the
flesh.

<span id="xvi.i-p6"></span>**2.** Rogo autem, ne praesens audeam ea
fiducia, qua cogito audax esse in quosdam, qui nos aestimant, acsi
secundum carnem ambularemus.

<span id="xvi.i-p7"></span>**3.** For though we walk in the flesh, we do
not war after the flesh:

<span id="xvi.i-p8"></span>**3.** Nam in carne ambulantes, non secundum
carnem militamus.

<span id="xvi.i-p9"></span>**4.** (For the weapons of our warfare *are*
not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)

<span id="xvi.i-p10"></span>**4.** Siquidem arma militiae nostrae non
carnilia sunt, sed potentia Deo ad destructionem munitionum, quibus
consilia destruimus.

<span id="xvi.i-p11"></span>**5.** Casting down imaginations, and every
high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and
bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;

<span id="xvi.i-p12"></span>**5.** Et omnem celsitudinem, quae
extollitur adversus cognitionem Dei: et captivam ducimus omnem
cogitationem ad obediendum Christo:  <span
id="fr_738"></span>[739](#fn_738.md)

<span id="xvi.i-p14"></span>**6.** And having in a readiness to revenge
all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.

<span id="xvi.i-p15"></span>**6.** Et in promptu habemus vindictam
adversus omnem inobedientiam, quum impleta fuerit vestra obedientia.

<span id="xvi.i-p16"></span> 

<span id="xvi.i-p17"></span><span id="xvi.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p18"></span>Having finished his exhortation, he now
proceeds partly to refute the calumnies with which he had been defamed
by the false apostles, and partly to repress the insolence  <span
id="fr_739"></span>[740](#fn_739.md) of certain wicked persons, who could
not bear to be under restraint. Both parties, with the view of
destroying Paul’s authority, construed the vehemence with which he
thundered in his Epistles to be <span
id="xvi.i-p19.2"></span>θρασοδειλίαν — (*mere bravado,*)  <span
id="fr_740"></span>[741](#fn_740.md) because when present he was not
equally prepared to show himself off in respect of appearance, and
address, but was mean and contemptible. “See,” said they, “here is a
man, that, under a consciousness of his inferiority, is so very modest
and timid, but now, when at a distance, makes a fierce attack! Why is he
less bold in speech than in letters? Will *he* terrify us, when he is at
a distance, who, when present, is the object of contempt? How comes he
to have such confidence as to imagine, that he is at liberty to do
anything with us?”  <span id="fr_741"></span>[742](#fn_741.md) They put
speeches of this kind into circulation, with the view of disparaging his
strictness, and even rendering it odious. Paul replies, that he is not
*bold* except in so far as he is constrained by necessity, and that the
meanness of his bodily presence, for which he was held in contempt,
detracted nothing from his authority, inasmuch as he was distinguished
by spiritual excellence, not by carnal show. Hence those would not pass
with impunity, who derided either his exhortations, or his reproaches,
or his threatenings. The words *I myself* are emphatic; as though he had
said, that however the malevolent might blame him for inconstancy, he
was in reality not changeable, but remained uniformly the same.

<span id="xvi.i-p22"></span>**1.** *I exhort you.* The speech is abrupt,
as is frequently the case with speeches uttered under the influence of
strong feeling. The meaning is this: “I beseech you, nay more, I
earnestly entreat you by the *gentleness of Christ,* not to compel me,
through your obstinacy, to be more severe than I would desire to be, and
than I will be, towards those who despise me, on the ground of my having
nothing excellent in external appearance, and do not recognize that
spiritual excellence, with which the Lord has distinguished me, and by
which I ought rather to be judged of.”

<span id="xvi.i-p23"></span>The form of entreaty, which he makes use of,
is taken from the subject in hand, when he says — by *the meekness and
gentleness of Christ* Calumniators took occasion to find fault with him,
because his bodily presence was deficient in dignity,  <span
id="fr_742"></span>[743](#fn_742.md) and because, on the other hand, when
at a distance, he thundered forth in his Epistles. Both calumnies he
befittingly refutes, as has been said, but he declares here, that
nothing delights him more than *gentleness,* which becomes a minister of
Christ, and of which the Master himself furnished an example.

<span id="xvi.i-p25"></span>Learn of me, says he, for I am meek and
lowly.  
My yoke is easy and my burden is light.  
(<span id="xvi.i-p25.3"></span>[Matt.
11:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029.md),
[30](../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030)<span id="xvi.i-p25.3"></span>..md)

<span id="xvi.i-p26"></span>The Prophet also says of him,

<span id="xvi.i-p27"></span>His voice will not be heard in the
streets:  
a bruised reed he shall not break, etc. (<span
id="xvi.i-p27.2"></span>[Isa. 42:2](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002.md),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003)<span id="xvi.i-p27.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xvi.i-p28"></span>That gentleness, therefore, which Christ
showed, he requires also from his servants. Paul, in making mention of
it, intimates that he is no stranger to it.  <span
id="fr_743"></span>[744](#fn_743.md) “I earnestly beseech you not to
despise that *gentleness,* which Christ showed us in his own person, and
shows us every day in his servants, nay more, which ye see in me.”

<span id="xvi.i-p30"></span>*Who in presence* He repeats this, as if in
the person of his adversaries, by way of imitating them.  <span
id="fr_744"></span>[745](#fn_744.md) Now he confesses, so far as words go,
what they upbraided him with, yet, as we shall see, in such a way as to
concede nothing to them in reality.

<span id="xvi.i-p32"></span><span id="xvi.i-p32.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p33"></span>**2.** *I beseech you, that I may not be
bold, when I am present.* Some think, that the discourse is incomplete,
and that he does not express the matter of his request.  <span
id="fr_745"></span>[746](#fn_745.md) I am rather of opinion, however, that
what was wanting in the former clause is here completed, so that it is a
general exhortation. “Show yourselves docile and tractable towards me,
that I may not be constrained to be more severe.” It is the duty of a
good pastor to allure his sheep peacefully and kindly, that they may
allow themselves to be governed, rather than to constrain them by
violence. Severity, it is true, is, I acknowledge, sometimes necessary,
but we must always set out with *gentleness,* and persevere in it, so
long as the hearer shews himself tractable.  <span
id="fr_746"></span>[747](#fn_746.md) Severity must be the last resource.
“We must,” says he, “try all methods, before having recourse to rigor;
nay more, let us never be rigorous, unless we are constrained to it.” In
the mean time, as to their reckoning themselves pusillanimous and timid,
when he had to come to close quarters, he intimates that they were
mistaken as to this, when he declares that he will stoutly resist face
to face the contumacious  <span id="fr_747"></span>[748](#fn_747.md) “They
despise me,” says he, “as if I were a pusillanimous person, but they
will find that I am braver and more courageous than they could have
wished, when they come to contend in good earnest.” From this we see,
*when* it is time to act with severity — after we have found, on trial
being made, that allurements and mildness have no good effect. “I shall
do it with reluctance,” says Paul, “but still I have determined to do
it.” Here is an admirable medium; for as we must, in so far as is in our
power, *draw* men rather than *drive* them, so, when mildness has no
effect, in dealing with those that are stern and refractory, rigor must
of necessity be resorted to: otherwise it will not be moderation, nor
equableness of temper, but criminal cowardice.  <span
id="fr_748"></span>[749](#fn_748.md)

<span id="xvi.i-p38"></span>*Who account of us.* Erasmus renders it —
“Those who think that we walk, as it were, according to the flesh.” The
Old Interpreter came nearer, in my opinion, to Paul’s true meaning —
“<span id="xvi.i-p38.1"></span>Qui nos arbitrantur, tanquam secundum
carnem ambulemus;” — (“Those who think of us as though we walked
according to the flesh;”  <span id="fr_749"></span>[750](#fn_749) .md)
though, at the same time, the phrase is not exactly in accordance with
the Latin idiom, nor does it altogether bring out the Apostle’s full
meaning. For <span id="xvi.i-p39.1"></span>λογιζεσθαι is taken here to
mean — *reckoning* or *esteeming.*  <span
id="fr_750"></span>[751](#fn_750.md) “They think of us,” says Paul, “or
they take this view of us, as though we walked according to the flesh.”

<span id="xvi.i-p41"></span>*To walk according to the flesh,* Chrysostom
explains to mean — acting unfaithfully, or conducting one’s self
improperly in his office;  <span id="fr_751"></span>[752](#fn_751.md) and,
certainly, it is taken in this sense in various instances in Paul’s
writings. The term *flesh,* however, I rather understand to mean —
outward pomp or show, by which alone the false Apostles are accustomed
to recommend themselves. Paul, therefore, complains of the
unreasonableness of those who looked for nothing in him except the
*flesh,* that is, visible appearance, as they speak, or in the usual
manner of persons who devote all their efforts to ambition. For as Paul
did not by any means excel in such endowments, as ordinarily procure
praise or reputation among the *children of this world,* (<span
id="xvi.i-p42.5"></span>[Lu 16:8](../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p42.5"></span>,) he was despised as though he had been one of
the common herd. But by whom?  <span id="fr_752"></span>[753](#fn_752.md)
Certainly, by the ambitious, who estimated him from mere appearance,
while they paid no regard to what lay concealed within.

<span id="xvi.i-p44"></span><span id="xvi.i-p44.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p45"></span>**3.** *For though we walk in the flesh.
Walking in the flesh* means here — *living it the world;* or, as he
expresses it elsewhere,

<span id="xvi.i-p46"></span>being at home in the body. (<span
id="xvi.i-p46.1"></span>[2Co 5:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p46.1"></span>.)

<span id="xvi.i-p47"></span>For he was shut up in the prison of his
body. This, however, did not prevent the influence of the Holy Spirit
from showing itself marvelously in his weakness. There is here again a
kind of concession, which, at the same time, is of no service to his
adversaries.

<span id="xvi.i-p48"></span>Those *war according to the flesh,* who
attempt nothing but in dependence upon worldly resources, in which
alone, too, they glory. They have not their confidence placed in the
government and guidance of the Holy Spirit. Paul declares that he is not
one of this class, inasmuch as he is furnished with other weapons than
those of the flesh and the world. Now, what he affirms respecting
himself is applicable, also, to all true ministers of Christ.  <span
id="fr_753"></span>[754](#fn_753.md) For they

<span id="xvi.i-p50"></span>carry an inestimable treasure in earthen
vessels,

<span id="xvi.i-p51"></span>as he had previously said. (<span
id="xvi.i-p51.1"></span>[2Co 4:7](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p51.1"></span>.) Hence, however they may be surrounded with
the infirmities of the flesh, the spiritual power of God, nevertheless,
shines forth resplendently in them.

<span id="xvi.i-p52"></span><span id="xvi.i-p52.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p53"></span>**4.** *For the weapons of our warfare.* The
warfare corresponds with the kind of weapons. He glories in being
furnished with *spiritual* weapons. The warfare, accordingly, is
*spiritual.* Hence it follows by way of contraries,  <span
id="fr_754"></span>[755](#fn_754.md) that it is *not according to the
flesh* In comparing the ministry of the gospel to a *warfare,* he uses a
most apt similitude. The life of a Christian, it is true, is a perpetual
warfare, for whoever gives himself to the service of God will have no
truce from Satan at any time, but will be harassed with incessant
disquietude. It becomes, however, ministers of the word and pastors to
be standard-bearers, going before the others; and, certainly, there are
none that Satan harasses more, that are more severely assaulted, or that
sustain more numerous or more dreadful onsets. That man, therefore, is
mistaken, who girds himself for the discharge of this office, and is not
at the same time furnished with courage and bravery for contending; for
he is not exercised otherwise than in fighting. For we must take this
into account, that the gospel is like a fire, by which the fury of Satan
is en-kindled. Hence it cannot but be that he will arm himself for a
contest, whenever he sees that it is advanced.

<span id="xvi.i-p55"></span>But by what weapons is he to be repelled? It
is only by spiritual weapons that he can be repelled. Whoever,
therefore, is unarmed with the influence of the Holy Spirit, however he
may boast that he is a minister of Christ, will nevertheless, not prove
himself to be such. At the same time, if you would have a full
enumeration of spiritual weapons, doctrine must be conjoined with zeal,
and a good conscience with the efficacy of the Spirit, and with other
necessary graces. Let now the Pope go, and assume to himself the
apostolic dignity  <span id="fr_755"></span>[756](#fn_755.md) What could be
more ridiculous, if our judgment is to be formed in accordance with the
rule here laid down by Paul!

<span id="xvi.i-p57"></span>*Mighty through God.* Either *according to
God,* or *from God.* I am of opinion, that there is here an implied
antithesis, so that this *strength* is placed in contrast with the
*weakness* which appears outwardly before the world, and thus, paying no
regard to the judgments of men, he would seek from God approbation of
his fortitude.  <span id="fr_756"></span>[757](#fn_756.md) At the same
time, the *antithesis* will hold good in another sense — that the power
of his arms depends upon God, not upon the world.

<span id="xvi.i-p59"></span>*In the demolishing of fortresses.* He makes
use of the term *fortresses* to denote contrivances, and every high
thing that is exalted against God,  <span
id="fr_757"></span>[758](#fn_757.md) as to which we shall find him speaking
afterwards. It is, however, with propriety and expressiveness that he so
designates them; for his design is to boast, that there is nothing in
the world so strongly fortified as to be beyond his power to overthrow.
I am well aware how carnal men glory in their empty shows, and how
disdainfully and recklessly they despise me, as though there were
nothing in me but what is mean and base, while they, in the mean time,
were standing on a lofty eminence. But their confidence is foolish, for
that armor of the Lord, with which I fight, will prevail in opposition
to all the bulwarks, in reliance upon which they believe themselves to
be invincible. Now, as the world is accustomed to fortify itself in a
twofold respect for waging war with Christ — on the one hand, by
cunning, by wicked artifices, by subtilty, and other secret
machinations; and, on the other hand, by cruelty and oppression, he
touches upon both these methods. For by *contrivances* he means,
whatever pertains to carnal wisdom.

<span id="xvi.i-p61"></span>The term *high thing* denotes any kind of
glory and power in this world. There is no reason, therefore, why a
servant of Christ should dread anything, however formidable, that may
stand up in opposition to his doctrine. Let him, in spite of it,
persevere, and he will scatter to the winds every machination of
whatever sort. Nay more, the kingdom of Christ cannot be set up or
established, otherwise than by throwing down everything in the world
that is exalted. For nothing is more opposed to the spiritual wisdom of
God than the wisdom of the flesh; nothing is more at variance with the
grace of God than man’s natural ability, and so as to other things.
Hence the only foundation of Christ’s kingdom is the abasement of men.
And to this effect are those expressions in the Prophets:

<span id="xvi.i-p62"></span>The moon shall be ashamed, and the sun shall
be confounded,  
when the Lord shall begin to reign in that day; (<span
id="xvi.i-p62.2"></span>[Isa
24:23](../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023)<span id="xvi.i-p62.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xvi.i-p63"></span>Again,

<span id="xvi.i-p64"></span>The loftiness of man shall be bowed down,
and the high looks of mortals shall be abased, and the Lord alone shall
be  
exalted in that day.(<span id="xvi.i-p64.2"></span>[Isa
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#015.md)<span id="xvi.i-p64.2"></span>,
and <span id="xvi.i-p64.3"></span>[Isa
2:17](../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#017)<span id="xvi.i-p64.3"></span>.md)

<span id="xvi.i-p65"></span>Because, in order that God alone may shine
forth, it is necessary that the glory of the world should vanish away.

<span id="xvi.i-p66"></span><span id="xvi.i-p66.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p67"></span>**5.** *And bring into captivity* I am of
opinion, that, having previously spoken more particularly of the
conflict of spiritual armor, along with the hinderances that rise up in
opposition to the gospel of Christ, he now, on the other hand, speaks of
the ordinary preparation, by which men must be brought into subjection
to him. For so long as we rest in our own judgment, and are wise in our
own estimation, we are far from having made any approach to the doctrine
of Christ. Hence we must set out with this, that

<span id="xvi.i-p68"></span>he who is wise must become a fool, (<span
id="xvi.i-p68.1"></span>[1Co 3:18](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p68.1"></span>,)

<span id="xvi.i-p69"></span>that is, we must give up our own
understanding, and renounce the wisdom of the flesh, and thus we must
present our minds to Christ empty that he may fill them. Now the form of
expression must be observed, when he says, that he *brings every thought
into captivity,* for it is as though he had said, that the liberty of
the human mind must be restrained and bridled, that it may not be wise,
apart from the doctrine of Christ; and farther, that its audacity cannot
be restrained by any other means, than by its being carried away, as it
were, *captive.* Now it is by the guidance of the Spirit, that it is
brought to allow itself to be placed under control, and remain in a
voluntary captivity.

<span id="xvi.i-p70"></span><span id="xvi.i-p70.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.i-p71"></span>**6.** *And are in readiness to avenge.*
This he adds, lest insolent men should presumptuously lift themselves up
in opposition to his ministry, as if they could do so with impunity.
Hence he says, that power had been given him — not merely for
constraining voluntary disciples to subjection to Christ, but also for
inflicting *vengeance* upon the rebellious,  <span
id="fr_758"></span>[759](#fn_758.md) and that his threats were not empty
bugbears,  <span id="fr_759"></span>[760](#fn_759.md) but had the execution
quite in readiness — to use the customary expression. Now this vengeance
is founded on Christ’s word —

<span id="xvi.i-p74"></span>whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be
bound also in heaven. (<span id="xvi.i-p74.1"></span>[Mt
18:18](../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018)<span id="xvi.i-p74.1"></span>..md)

<span id="xvi.i-p75"></span>For although God does not thunder forth
immediately on the minister’s pronouncing the sentence, yet the decision
is ratified,  <span id="fr_760"></span>[761](#fn_760.md) and will be
accomplished in its own time. Let it, however, be always understood,
that it is when the minister fights with spiritual armor. Some
understand it as referring to bodily punishments, by means of which the
Apostles inflicted vengeance upon contumacious and impious persons; as
for example, Peter struck Ananias and Sapphira dead, and Paul struck
Elymas the sorcerer blind. (<span id="xvi.i-p76.2"></span>[Ac
5:1-10](../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001.md)<span id="xvi.i-p76.2"></span>,
and <span id="xvi.i-p76.3"></span>[Ac
13:6-11](../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#006.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p76.3"></span>.) But the other meaning suits better, for the
Apostles did not make use of that power invariably or indiscriminately.
Paul, however, speaks in general terms that he has *vengeance* ready at
hand against all the disobedient.

<span id="xvi.i-p77"></span>*When your obedience shall be fulfilled* How
prudently he guards against alienating any by excessive severity! For as
he had threatened to inflict punishment upon the rebellious, that he may
not seem to provoke them, he declares that another duty had been
enjoined upon him with regard to them — simply that of making them
obedient to Christ. And, unquestionably, this is the proper intention of
the gospel, as he teaches both in the commencement and in the close of
the Epistle to the Romans. (<span id="xvi.i-p77.1"></span>[Ro
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005.md)<span id="xvi.i-p77.1"></span>, and
<span id="xvi.i-p77.2"></span>[Ro
16:26](../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026)<span id="xvi.i-p77.2"></span>..md)
Hence all Christian teachers ought carefully to observe this order, that
they should first endeavor with gentleness to bring their hearers to
obedience, so as to invite them kindly before proceeding to inflict
punishment upon rebellion.  <span id="fr_761"></span>[762](#fn_761.md)
Hence, too, Christ  <span id="fr_762"></span>[763](#fn_762.md) has given
the commandment as to *loosing* before that of *binding.*  <span
id="fr_763"></span>[764](#fn_763.md)

<span id="xvi.ii"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p1"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p1.1"></span>[2 Corinthians
10:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#007.md)<span id="xvi.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p2"></span>**7.** Do ye look on things after the
outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ’s, let
him of himself think this again, that, as he *is* Christ’s, even so
*are* we Christ’s.

<span id="xvi.ii-p3"></span>**7.** Quae secundum faciem sunt videtis: si
quis sibi confidit, quia sit Christi, hoc reputet etiam ex se ipso
rursum, quod sicuti ipse Christi, ita et nos Christi.

<span id="xvi.ii-p4"></span>**8.** For though I should boast somewhat
more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and
not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:

<span id="xvi.ii-p5"></span>**8.** Nam etsi abundantius glorier de
potestate nostra, quam dedit nobis Dominus in aedificationem, et non in
destructionem vestram, non pudefiam;

<span id="xvi.ii-p6"></span>**9.** That I may not seem as if I would
terrify you by letters.

<span id="xvi.ii-p7"></span>**9.** Ne autem videar terrere vos per
Epistolas.

<span id="xvi.ii-p8"></span>**10.** For *his* letters, say they, *are*
weighty and powerful; but *his* bodily presence *is* weak, and *his*
speech contemptible.

<span id="xvi.ii-p9"></span>**10.** (Siquidem Epistolae, inquiunt,
graves sunt ac robustae; praesentia autem corporis infirma, et sermo
contemptus.)

<span id="xvi.ii-p10"></span>**11.** Let such an one think this, that,
such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such *will we be*
also in deed when we are present.

<span id="xvi.ii-p11"></span>**11.** Hoc cogitet qui talis est, quod
quales sumus absentes, sermone per Epistolas, tales sumus etiam
praesentes, opere.

<span id="xvi.ii-p12"></span> 

<span id="xvi.ii-p13"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p14"></span>**7.** *That are according to appearance.*
In the first place, the clause *according to appearance*, may be taken
in two ways: either as meaning the reality itself, visible and manifest,
or an outward mask,  <span id="fr_764"></span>[765](#fn_764.md) that
deceives us. The sentence, too, may be read either interrogatively or
affirmatively: nay more, the verb <span id="xvi.ii-p15.2"></span>βλέπετε
may be taken either in the imperative mood, or in the subjunctive. I am
rather of opinion, however, that it is expressive of chiding, and that
the Corinthians are reaproved, because they suffered their eyes to be
dazzled with empty show. “You greatly esteem others who swell out with
mighty airs of importance, while you look down upon me, because I have
nothing of show and boasting.” For Christ himself contrasts the
*judgment that is according to appearance* with *righteous judgment*.
(<span id="xvi.ii-p15.3"></span>[Joh
7:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#024.md)<span id="xvi.ii-p15.3"></span>,
and <span id="xvi.ii-p15.4"></span>[Joh
8:15](../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#015)<span id="xvi.ii-p15.4"></span>..md)
Hence he reproves the Corinthians, because, contenting themselves with
show, or appearance, they did not seriously consider, what kind of
persons ought to be looked upon as the servants of Christ.

<span id="xvi.ii-p16"></span>*If any one trusteth in himself* — an
expression that is full of great confidence, for he takes it, as it
were, for granted, that he is so certainly a minister of Christ, that
this distinction cannot be taken from him. “Whoever,” says he, “is
desirous to be looked upon as a minister of Christ, must necessarily
count me in along with himself.” For what reason? “*Let him*,” says he.
“*think for himself*, for whatever things he may have in himself, that
make him worthy of such an honor, the same will he find in me.” By this
he hinted to them, that whoever they might be that reviled him, ought
not to be looked upon as the servants of Christ. It would not become all
to speak thus confidently, for it might certainly happen — nay, it
happens every day, that they same claim is haughtily advanced by
persons, that are of no reputation, and are nothing else than a dishonor
to Christ.  <span id="fr_765"></span>[766](#fn_765.md) Paul, however,
affirmed nothing respecting himself but what he had openly given proof
of by clear and sure evidences among the Corinthians. Now should any
one, while destitute of all proof of the reality, recommend himself in a
similar manner, what would he do but expose himself to ridicule? To
*trust in one’s self* is equivalent to assuming to one’s self power and
authority on the pretext that he serves Christ, while he is desirous to
be held in estimation.

<span id="xvi.ii-p18"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p19"></span>**8.** *For though I should boast more
largely of my authority*. It was a sign of modesty, that he put himself
into the number of those, whom he greatly excelled. At the same time, he
was not disposed to show such modesty, as not to retain his authority
unimpaired. He accordingly adds, that he has said less than his
authority entitled him to say; for he was not one of the ordinary class
of ministers, but was even distinguished among the Apostles. Hence he
says: “Though I should boast more, *I should not be ashamed*, for there
will be good ground for it.” He anticipates an objection, because he
does not fail to speak of his own glory, while at the same time he
refrains from making farther mention of it, that the Corinthians may
understand, that, if he boasts, it is against his will, as in truth the
false Apostles constrained him to it; otherwise he would not have done
so.

<span id="xvi.ii-p20"></span>By the term *power* he means — the
authority of his Apostleship, which he had among the Corinthians for,
through all the ministers of the word have the same office in common,
there are nevertheless, degrees of honor. Now God had placed Paul on a
higher eminence than others, inasmuch as he had made use of his
endeavors for founding  <span id="fr_766"></span>[767](#fn_766.md) that
Church, and had in many ways put honor upon his Apostleship. Lest,
however, malevolent persons should stir up odium against him, on the
ground of his making use of the term *power*, he adds the purpose for
which it was given him — the salvation of the Corinthians. Hence it
follows, that it ought not to be irksome to them, or grievous, for who
would not bear patiently, nay more, who would not love what he knows to
be of advantage to him? In the mean time, there is an implied contrast
between his power, and that in which the false apostles gloried — which
was of such a nature that the Corinthians received no advantage from it,
and experienced no edification. There can, however, be no doubt, that
all the ministers of the word are also, furnished with *power*; for of
what sort were a preaching of the word, that was without *power*? Hence
it is said to all —

<span id="xvi.ii-p22"></span>He that heareth you, heareth me;  
he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me. (<span id="xvi.ii-p22.2"></span>[Lu
10:16](../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016)<span id="xvi.ii-p22.2"></span>..md)

<span id="xvi.ii-p23"></span>As however, many, on false grounds, claim
for themselves what they have not, we must carefully observe, how far
Paul extends his *power* — so as to be to the edification of believers.
Those, then, who exercise *power* in the way of destroying the Church,
prove themselves to be tyrants, and robbers — not pastors. In the
*second* place, we must observe, that he declares, that it was given to
him by God. He, therefore, that is desirous to have any thing in his
power to do, must have God as the Author of his power. Others, it is
true, will boast of this also, as the Pope with full mouth thunders
forth, that he is Christ’s vicar. But what evidence does he give of
this?  <span id="fr_767"></span>[768](#fn_767.md) For Christ has not
conferred *power* of this kind upon dumb persons, but upon the Apostles,
and his other ministers, that the doctrine of his Gospel might not be
without defense. Hence the whole *power* of ministers is included in the
word — but in such a way, nevertheless, that Christ may always remain
Lord and Master. Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that in lawful
authority these two things are required — that it be given by God, and
that it be exercised for the welfare of the Church. It is well known,
who they are, on whom God has conferred this *power*, and in what way he
has limited the power he has given. Those exercise it in a proper
manner, who faithfully obey his commandment.

<span id="xvi.ii-p25"></span>Here, however, a question may be proposed.
“God says to Jeremiah,

<span id="xvi.ii-p26"></span>Behold, I set thee over the nations, and
kingdoms,  
to plant, and to pluck up, to build and to destroy.  
(<span id="xvi.ii-p26.3"></span>[Jer
1:10](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010)<span id="xvi.ii-p26.3"></span>..md)

<span id="xvi.ii-p27"></span>We have, also, found it stated a little
before, (<span id="xvi.ii-p27.1"></span>[2Co
10:5](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005)<span id="xvi.ii-p27.1"></span>.md)
that the Apostles were set apart on the same footing — that they might
destroy every thing that exalted itself against Christ. Nay more, the
teachers of the gospel cannot build up in any other way, than by
destroying the old man. Besides, they preach the gospel to the
condemnation and destruction of the wicked.” I answer that, what Paul
says here, has nothing to do with the wicked, for he addresses the
Corinthians, to whom he wished his Apostleship to be beneficial. With
regard to them, I say, he could do nothing but with a view to
edification. We have already observed, also, that this was expressly
stated, that the Corinthians might know, that the authority of this holy
man was not assailed by any one but Satan, the enemy of their salvation,
while the design of that authority was their edification.

<span id="xvi.ii-p28"></span>At the same time, it is in other respects
true in a general way, that the doctrine of the gospel has in its own
nature a tendency to *edification* — not to *destruction*. For as to its
destroying, that comes from something apart from itself — from the fault
of mankind, while they stumble at the stone that was appointed form as a
*foundation* (<span id="xvi.ii-p28.1"></span>[1Pe
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008)<span id="xvi.ii-p28.1"></span>..md)
As to the fact, that we are renewed after the image of God by the
destruction of the old man — that is not at all at variance with Paul’s
words, for in that case destruction is taken in a good sense, but here
in a bad sense, as meaning the ruin of what is God’s, or as meaning the
destruction of the soul — as if he had said, that his *power* was not
injurious to them, for instead of this the advantage of it for their
salvation was manifested.

<span id="xvi.ii-p29"></span><span id="xvi.ii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.ii-p30"></span>**9** *That I may not seem to terrify*.
Again he touches on the calumny which he had formerly refuted, (<span
id="xvi.ii-p30.1"></span>[2Co
10:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#002)<span id="xvi.ii-p30.1"></span>,.md)
that he was bold in his writings, while in their presence his courage
failed him. On this pretext they disparaged his writings.  <span
id="fr_768"></span>[769](#fn_768.md) “What!” Said they, “will he terrify us
by letters when at a distance, while, if present with us, he would
scarcely venture to mutter a word!” Lest, therefore, his letters should
have less weight, he answers, that no objection is advanced against him,
that should either destroy or weaken his credit, and that of his
doctrine, for *deeds* were not to be less valued than *words*. He was
not less powerful in actions when present, than he was by words when
absent. Hence it was unfair, that his bodily presence should be looked
upon as contemptible. By *deed*, here, he means, in my opinion, the
efficacy and success of his preaching, as well as the excellences that
were worthy of an Apostle, and his whole manner of life. *Speech*, on
the other hand, denotes — not the very substance of doctrine, but simply
the form of it, and the bark, so to speak: for he would have contended
for doctrine with greater keeness. The contempt, however, proceeded from
this — that he was deficient in that ornament and splendor of eloquence,
which secures favor.  <span id="fr_769"></span>[770](#fn_769.md)

<span id="xvi.iii"></span>

Corinthians 10:12-18](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#012.md)<span
id="xvi.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p2"></span>**12.** For we dare not make ourselves of
the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but
they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among
themselves, are not wise.

<span id="xvi.iii-p3"></span>**12.** Non enim audemus nos quibusdam
inserere aut comparare, qui se ipsos commendant: verum ipsi in se ipsis
se metientes, et se ipsos comparantes sibi, non sapiunt.

<span id="xvi.iii-p4"></span>**13.** But we will not boast of things
without *our* measure, but according to the measure of the rule which
God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.

<span id="xvi.iii-p5"></span>**13.** Nos autem non sine modo
gloriabimur, sed pro mensura regulae, quam nobis distribuit Deus:
mensura, inquam, perveniendi etiam usque ad vos.

<span id="xvi.iii-p6"></span>**14.** For we stretch not ourselves beyond
*our measure*, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far
as to you also in *preaching* the gospel of Christ:

<span id="xvi.iii-p7"></span>**14.** Non enim quasi ad vos non
perveniremus, supra modum extendimus nos ipsos: siquidem usque ad vos
pertigimus in Evangelio Christi.

<span id="xvi.iii-p8"></span>**15.** Not boasting of things without
*our* measure, *that is,* of other men’s labours; but having hope, when
your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to
our rule abundantly,

<span id="xvi.iii-p9"></span>**15.** Non gloriantes sine modo in alienis
laboribus,  <span id="fr_770"></span>[771](#fn_770.md) spem autem habentes,
crescente fide vestra in vobis, nos magnificatum iri secundum nostram
regulam in exuberantiam.

<span id="xvi.iii-p11"></span>**16.** To preach the gospel in the
*regions* beyond you, *and* not to boast in another man’s line of things
made ready to our hand.

<span id="xvi.iii-p12"></span>**16.** Ut etiam ultra vos evangelizem,
non in aliena regula, ut de iis, quae parata sunt, glorier.

<span id="xvi.iii-p13"></span>**17.** But he that glorieth, let him
glory in the Lord.

<span id="xvi.iii-p14"></span>**17.** Caeterum qui gloriatur in Domino
glorietur.

<span id="xvi.iii-p15"></span>**18.** For not he that commendeth himself
is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.

<span id="xvi.iii-p16"></span>**18.** Non enim qui se ipsum commendat,
ille probatus est: sed quem Dominus commendat.

<span id="xvi.iii-p17"></span> 

<span id="xvi.iii-p18"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p19"></span>**12.** *For we dare not.* He says this by
way of *irony,* for afterwards he does not merely compare himself boldly
with them, but, deriding their vanity, he leaves them far behind him.
Now by this *irony* he gives a stroke, not merely to those foolish
boasters,  <span id="fr_771"></span>[772](#fn_771.md) but also to the
Corinthians, who encouraged them in their folly by their misdirected
approbation. “I am satisfied,” says he, “with my moderate way; for I
would not dare to put myself on a footing with your Apostles, who are
the heralds of their own excellence.” In the mean time, when he
intimates that their glory consists of mere speaking and boasting, he
shows, how silly and worthless they are, while he claims for himself
deeds instead of words, that is, true and solid ground of glorying. He
may seem, however, to err in the very thing for which he reproves
others, for he immediately afterwards commends himself. I answer, that
his design must be taken into view, for those do not aim at their own
commendation, who, entirely free from ambition, have no desire but to
serve the Lord usefully.  <span id="fr_772"></span>[773](#fn_772.md) As to
this passage, however, there is no need of any other explanation than
what may be gathered from the words themselves, for those are said to
*commend themselves,* who, while in poverty and starvation as to true
praise, exalt themselves in vain-glorious boasting, and falsely give
out, that they are what they are not. This, also, appears from what
follows.

<span id="xvi.iii-p22"></span>*But they measure themselves by
themselves* Here he points out, as with his finger their folly. The man
that has but one eye sees well enough among the blind: the man that is
dull of hearing hears distinctly enough among the totally deaf. Such
were those that were satisfied with themselves, and showed themselves
off among others, simply because they did not look to any that were
superior to themselves, for if they had compared themselves with Paul,
or any one like him, they would have felt constrained to lay aside
immediately that foolish impression which they entertained, and would
have exchanged boasting for shame.

<span id="xvi.iii-p23"></span>For an explanation of this passage we need
look no farther than to the monks; for as they are almost all of them
the most ignorant asses, and at the same time are looked upon as learned
persons, on account of their long robe and hood, if any one has merely a
slight smattering of elegant literature, he proudly spreads out his
feathers like a peacock — a marvelous fame goes abroad respecting him —
among his companions he is adored  <span
id="fr_773"></span>[774](#fn_773.md) Were, however, the mask of the hood
laid aside,  <span id="fr_774"></span>[775](#fn_774.md) and a thorough
examination entered upon, their vanity would at once be discovered. Why
so? The old proverb holds good: “Ignorance is pert.”  <span
id="fr_775"></span>[776](#fn_775.md) But the excessively insolent arrogance
of the monks  <span id="fr_776"></span>[777](#fn_776.md) proceeds chiefly
from this — that they *measure themselves by themselves;* for, as in
their cloisters there is nothing but barbarism,  <span
id="fr_777"></span>[778](#fn_777.md) it is not to be wondered, if the man
that has but one eye is a king among the blind. Such were Paul’s rivals,
for inwardly they flattered themselves, not considering what virtues
entitled a person to true praise, and how far short they came of the
excellence of Paul, and those like him. And, certainly, this single
consideration might justly have covered them with shame, but it is the
just punishment of the ambitious, that by their silliness they expose
themselves to ridicule, (than which there is nothing that they are more
desirous to avoid,) and in place of glory, which they are immoderately
desirous of,  <span id="fr_778"></span>[779](#fn_778.md) they incur
disgrace.

<span id="xvi.iii-p30"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p31"></span>**13.** *But we will not boast beyond our
measure* He now contrasts his own moderation with the folly of the false
Apostles,  <span id="fr_779"></span>[780](#fn_779.md) and, at the same
time, he shows what is the true measure of glorying — when we keep
within the limits that have been marked out for us by the Lord. “Has the
Lord given me such a thing? I shall be satisfied with this measure. I
shall not either desire or claim to myself any thing more.” This he
calls the *measure of his rule.*  <span
id="fr_780"></span>[781](#fn_780.md) For every one’s rule, according to
which he ought to regulate himself is this — God’s gift and calling. At
the same time, it is not lawful for us to glow in God’s gift and calling
on our own account, but merely in so far as it is expedient for the
glory of him, who is so liberal to us with this view — that we may
acknowledge ourselves indebted to him for everything.  <span
id="fr_781"></span>[782](#fn_781.md)

<span id="xvi.iii-p35"></span>*A measure to reach.* By this clause he
intimates, that he stands in no need of commendations expressed in words
among the Corinthians, who were a portion of his glow, as he says
elsewhere, (<span id="xvi.iii-p35.1"></span>[Php
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001)<span id="xvi.iii-p35.1"></span>,.md)
*ye are my crown.* He carries out, however, the form of expression,
which he had previously entered upon. “I have,” says he, “a most ample
field for glorying, so as not to go beyond my own limits, and you are
one department of that field.” He modestly reproves, however, their
ingratitude,  <span id="fr_782"></span>[783](#fn_782.md) in overlooking, in
a manner, his apostleship, which ought to have been especially in
estimation among them, on the ground of God’s commendation of it. In
each clause, too, we must understand as implied, a contrast between him
and the false Apostles, who had no such approbation to show.

<span id="xvi.iii-p37"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p37.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p38"></span>**14.** *For we do not overstretch.* He
alludes to persons who either forcibly stretch out their arms, or raise
themselves up on their feet, when wishing to catch hold of what is not
at their hand,  <span id="fr_783"></span>[784](#fn_783.md) for of this
nature is a greedy thirst for glory, nay more, it is often more
disgusting. For ambitious persons do not merely stretch out their arms
and lift up their feet, but are even carried headlong with the view of
obtaining some pretext for glorying.  <span
id="fr_784"></span>[785](#fn_784.md) He tacitly intimates that his rivals
were of this stamp. He afterwards declares on what ground he had come to
the Corinthians — because he had founded their church by his ministry.
Hence he says, *in the gospel of Christ;* for he had not come to them
empty,  <span id="fr_785"></span>[786](#fn_785.md) but had been the first
to bring the gospel to them. The preposition *in* is taken by some in
another way; for they render it, *by* the gospel, and this meaning does
not suit ill. At the same time, Paul seems to set off to advantage his
coming to the Corinthians, on the ground of his having been furnished
with so precious a gift.

<span id="xvi.iii-p42"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p42.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p43"></span>**15.** *In the labors of others.* He now
reproves more freely the false Apostles, who, while they had put forth
their hand in the reaping of another man’s harvest, had the audacity at
the same time to revile those, who had prepared a place for them at the
expense of sweat and toil. Paul had built up the Church of the
Corinthians — not without the greatest struggle, and innumerable
difficulties. Those persons afterwards come forward, and find the road
made and the gate open. That they may appear persons of consequence,
they impudently claim for themselves what did not of right belong to
them, and disparage Paul’s labors.

<span id="xvi.iii-p44"></span>*But having hope.* He again indirectly
reproves the Corinthians, because they had stood in the way of his
making greater progress in advancing the gospel. For when he says that
he hopes that, when *their faith is increased* the boundaries of his
glowing will be enlarged, he intimates, that the weakness of faith under
which they labored was the reason, why his career had been somewhat
retarded. “I ought now to have been employed in gaining over new
Churches, and that too with your assistance, if you had made as much
proficiency as you ought to have done; but now you retard me by your
infirmity. I hope, however, that the Lord will grant, that greater
progress will be made by you in future, and that in this way the glory
of my ministry will be increased according to the rule of the divine
calling.”  <span id="fr_786"></span>[787](#fn_786.md) To *glory in things
that have been prepared* is equivalent to *glorying in the labors of
others;* for, while Paul had fought the battle, *they* enjoyed the
triumph.  <span id="fr_787"></span>[788](#fn_787.md)

<span id="xvi.iii-p47"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p47.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p48"></span>**17.** *But he that glorieth* This
statement is made by way of correction, as his glorying might be looked
upon as having the appearance of empty boasting. Hence he cites himself
and others before the judgment-seat of God, saying, that those glory on
good grounds, who are approved by God. To *glory in the Lord,* however,
is used here in a different sense from what it bears in the first
chapter of the former Epistle, (<span id="xvi.iii-p48.1"></span>[1Co
1:31](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031)<span id="xvi.iii-p48.1"></span>,.md)
and in <span id="xvi.iii-p48.2"></span>[Jer
9:24](../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024.md)<span id="xvi.iii-p48.2"></span>.
For in those passages it means — to recognize God as the author of all
blessings, in such a way that every blessing is ascribed to his grace,
while men do not extol themselves, but glorify him alone. Here, however,
it means — to place our glory at the disposal of God alone,  <span
id="fr_788"></span>[789](#fn_788.md) and reckon every thing else as of no
value. For while some are dependent on the estimation of men, and weigh
themselves in the false balance of public opinion, and others are
deceived by their own arrogance, Paul exhorts us to be emulous of this
glow — that we may please the Lord, by whose judgment we all stand or
fall.

<span id="xvi.iii-p50"></span>Even heathens say, that true glory
consists in an upright *conscience.*  <span
id="fr_789"></span>[790](#fn_789.md) Now that is so much, but it is not
all; for, as almost all are blind through excessive self-love, we cannot
safely place confidence in the estimate that we form of ourselves. For
we must keep in mind what he says elsewhere, (<span
id="xvi.iii-p51.5"></span>[1Co
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004)<span id="xvi.iii-p51.5"></span>,.md)
that he is not conscious to himself of anything wrong, and yet is *not
thereby justified.* What then? Let us know, that to God alone must be
reserved the right of passing judgment upon us; for we are not competent
judges in our own cause. This meaning is confirmed by what follows —

<span id="xvi.iii-p52"></span><span id="xvi.iii-p52.1"></span>

<span id="xvi.iii-p53"></span> *For not he that commendeth himself is
approved* “For it is easy to impose upon men by a false impression, and
this is matter of every day occurrence. Let us, therefore, leaving off
all other things, aim exclusively at this — that we may be approved by
God, and may be satisfied to have his approbation alone, as it justly
ought to be regarded by us as of more value than all the applauses of
the whole world. There was one that said, that to have Plato’s favorable
judgment was to him worth a thousand.  <span
id="fr_790"></span>[791](#fn_790.md) The question here is not as to the
judgment of mankind, in respect of the superiority of one to another,
but as to the sentence of God himself, who has it in his power to
overturn all the decisions that men have pronounced.

in commenting on which he says, “As the embassy of salvation and of
eternal life has been committed to the Apostles, so, on the other hand,
they have been armed with *vengeance* against all the ungodly, who
reject the salvation offered to them, as Paul teaches. (<span
id="xvi.i-p80.2"></span>[2Co 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#006.md)<span
id="xvi.i-p80.2"></span>.) But this is placed in last order, because it
was proper that the true and real design of preaching the gospel should
be first exhibited. That we are reconciled to God belongs to the nature
of the gospel; that believers are adjudged to eternal life may be said
to be accidentally connected with it. For this reason, Paul, in the
passage which I lately quoted, when he threatens vengeance against
unbelievers, immediately adds — *after that your obedience shall have
been fulfilled;* (<span id="xvi.i-p80.3"></span>[2Co
10:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#006)<span id="xvi.i-p80.3"></span>.md)

salvation, but that it is accidental to it that it brings destruction to
any.” — Calvin on John, vol. 2, p. 273. — *Ed.*

it also rendered them inaccessible to that auspicious light of improved
science, whose salutary beams had already been felt in several of the
European provinces. The instructors of youth, dignified with the
venerable titles of Artists, Grammarians, Physicians, and Dialecticians,
loaded the memories of their laborious pupils with a certain quantity of
barbarous terms, arid and senseless distinctions, and scholastic
precepts delivered in the most inelegant style, and all such that could
repeat this jargon with a certain readiness and rapidity were considered
