<p><a name="xvi.i-p5"></A><b>2. </b>But I beseech <i>you</i>, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</p>

<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p17"></A><a name="xvi.i-p17.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p18"></A>Having finished his exhortation, he now proceeds partly to refute the calumnies with which he had been defamed by the false apostles, and partly to repress the insolence   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_739"></A><A HREF="#fn_739"><FONT SIZE="1">740</FONT></A>
 			  of certain wicked persons, who could not bear to be under restraint. Both parties, with the view of destroying Paul&#8217;s authority, construed the vehemence with which he thundered in his Epistles to be <a name="xvi.i-p19.2"></A>&#952;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#959;&#948;&#949;&#953;&#955;&#8055;&#945;&#957; &#8212; (<i>mere bravado,</i>)   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_740"></A><A HREF="#fn_740"><FONT SIZE="1">741</FONT></A>
 			  because when present he was not equally prepared to show himself off in respect of appearance, and address, but was mean and contemptible. &#8220;See,&#8221; said they, &#8220;here is a man, that, under a consciousness of his inferiority, is so very modest and timid, but now, when at a distance, makes a fierce attack! Why is he less bold in speech than in 			 letters? Will <i>he </i>terrify us, when he is at a distance, who, when present, is the object of contempt? How comes he to have such confidence as to imagine, that he is at liberty to do anything with us?&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_741"></A><A HREF="#fn_741"><FONT SIZE="1">742</FONT></A>
 			  They put speeches of this kind into circulation, with the view of disparaging his strictness, and even rendering it odious. Paul replies, that he is not <i>bold </i>except in so far as he is constrained by necessity, and that the meanness of his bodily presence, for which he was held in contempt, detracted nothing from his authority, inasmuch as he was distinguished by spiritual excellence, not by carnal show. Hence those 			 would not pass with impunity, who derided either his exhortations, or his reproaches, or his threatenings. The words <i>I myself</i> are emphatic; as though he had said, that however the malevolent might blame him for inconstancy, he was in reality not changeable, but remained uniformly the same.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p22"></A><b>1. </b><i>I exhort you.</i> The speech is abrupt, as is frequently the case with speeches uttered under the influence of strong feeling. The meaning is this: &#8220;I beseech you, nay more, I earnestly entreat you by the <i>gentleness of Christ, </i>not to compel me, through your obstinacy, to be more severe than I would desire to be, and than I will be, towards those who despise me, on the ground of my having nothing excellent in external appearance, and do not recognize that spiritual excellence, with which the Lord has distinguished me, and by which I ought rather to be judged of.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p23"></A>The form of entreaty, which he makes use of, is taken from the subject in hand, when he says &#8212; by <i>the meekness and gentleness of Christ</i> Calumniators took occasion to find fault with him, because his bodily presence was deficient in dignity,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_742"></A><A HREF="#fn_742"><FONT SIZE="1">743</FONT></A>
 			  and because, on the other hand, when at a distance, he thundered forth in his Epistles. Both calumnies he befittingly refutes, as has been said, but he declares here, that nothing delights him more than <i>gentleness, </i>which becomes a minister of Christ, and of which the Master himself furnished an example.</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.i-p25"></A>Learn of me, says he, for I am meek and lowly.<br> 			 My yoke is easy and my burden is light.<br> 			 (<a name="xvi.i-p25.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029">Matt. 11:29</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#030">30</a><a name="xvi.i-p25.3"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p26"></A>The Prophet also says of him,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.i-p27"></A>His voice will not be heard in the streets:<br> 			 a bruised reed he shall not break, etc. (<a name="xvi.i-p27.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#002">Isa. 42:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#003">3</a><a name="xvi.i-p27.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p28"></A>That gentleness, therefore, which Christ showed, he requires also from his servants. Paul, in making mention of it, intimates that he is no stranger to it.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_743"></A><A HREF="#fn_743"><FONT SIZE="1">744</FONT></A>
 			  &#8220;I earnestly beseech you not to despise that <i>gentleness,</i> which Christ showed us in his own person, and shows us every day in his servants, nay more, which ye see in me.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p30"></A><i>Who in presence</i> He repeats this, as if in the person of his adversaries, by way of imitating them.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_744"></A><A HREF="#fn_744"><FONT SIZE="1">745</FONT></A>
 			  Now he confesses, so far as words go, what they upbraided him with, yet, as we shall see, in such a way as to concede nothing to them in reality.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p32"></A><a name="xvi.i-p32.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p33"></A><b>2. </b><i>I beseech you, that I may not be bold, when I am present.</i> Some think, that the discourse is incomplete, and that he does not express the matter of his request.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_745"></A><A HREF="#fn_745"><FONT SIZE="1">746</FONT></A>
 			  I am rather of opinion, however, that what was wanting in the former clause is here completed, so that it is a general exhortation. &#8220;Show yourselves docile and tractable towards me, that I may not be constrained to be more severe.&#8221; It is the duty of a good pastor to allure his sheep peacefully and kindly, that they may allow themselves to be governed, rather than to constrain them by violence. Severity, it is true, 			 is, I acknowledge, sometimes necessary, but we must always set out with <i>gentleness, </i>and persevere in it, so long as the hearer shews himself tractable.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_746"></A><A HREF="#fn_746"><FONT SIZE="1">747</FONT></A>
 			  Severity must be the last resource. &#8220;We must,&#8221; says he, &#8220;try all methods, before having recourse to rigor; nay more, let us never be rigorous, unless we are constrained to it.&#8221; In the mean time, as to their reckoning themselves pusillanimous and timid, when he had to come to close quarters, he intimates that they were mistaken as to this, when he declares that he will stoutly resist face to face the 			 contumacious   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_747"></A><A HREF="#fn_747"><FONT SIZE="1">748</FONT></A>
 			  &#8220;They despise me,&#8221; says he, &#8220;as if I were a pusillanimous person, but they will find that I am braver and more courageous than they could have wished, when they come to contend in good earnest.&#8221; From this we see, <i>when </i>it is time to act with severity &#8212; after we have 			 found, on trial being made, that allurements and mildness have no good effect. &#8220;I shall do it with reluctance,&#8221; says Paul, &#8220;but still I have determined to do it.&#8221; Here is an admirable medium; for as we must, in so far as is in our power, <i>draw </i>men rather than <i>drive </i>them, so, when mildness has no 			 effect, in dealing with those that are stern and refractory, rigor must of necessity be resorted to: otherwise it will not be moderation, nor equableness of temper, but criminal cowardice.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_748"></A><A HREF="#fn_748"><FONT SIZE="1">749</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p38"></A><i>Who account of us.</i> Erasmus renders it &#8212; &#8220;Those who think that we walk, as it were, according to the flesh.&#8221; The Old Interpreter came nearer, in my opinion, to Paul&#8217;s true meaning &#8212; &#8220;<a name="xvi.i-p38.1"></A>Qui nos arbitrantur, tanquam secundum carnem ambulemus;&#8221; &#8212; (&#8220;Those who think of us as though we walked according to the flesh;&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_749"></A><A HREF="#fn_749"><FONT SIZE="1">750</FONT></A>
 			 ) though, at the same time, the phrase is not exactly in accordance with the Latin idiom, nor does it altogether bring out the Apostle&#8217;s full meaning. For <a name="xvi.i-p39.1"></A>&#955;&#959;&#947;&#953;&#950;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; is taken here to mean &#8212; <i>reckoning </i>or <i>esteeming.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_750"></A><A HREF="#fn_750"><FONT SIZE="1">751</FONT></A>
 			  &#8220;They think of us,&#8221; says Paul, &#8220;or they take this view of us, as though we walked according to the flesh.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p41"></A><i>To walk according to the flesh,</i> Chrysostom explains to mean &#8212; acting unfaithfully, or conducting one&#8217;s self improperly in his office;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_751"></A><A HREF="#fn_751"><FONT SIZE="1">752</FONT></A>
 			  and, certainly, it is taken in this sense in various instances in Paul&#8217;s writings. The term <i>flesh, </i>however, I rather understand to mean &#8212; outward pomp or show, by which alone the false Apostles are accustomed to recommend themselves. Paul, therefore, complains of the unreasonableness of those who looked for nothing in him except the <i>flesh, </i>that is, visible appearance, as they speak, or in the usual manner of persons who devote all their efforts to ambition. For as Paul did not by any means excel in such endowments, as ordinarily procure praise or reputation among the <i>children of this world, </i>(<a name="xvi.i-p42.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#008">Lu 16:8</a><a name="xvi.i-p42.5"></A>,) he was despised as though he had 			 been one of the common herd. But by whom?   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_752"></A><A HREF="#fn_752"><FONT SIZE="1">753</FONT></A>
 			  Certainly, by the ambitious, who estimated him from mere appearance, while they paid no regard to what lay concealed within.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p44"></A><a name="xvi.i-p44.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p45"></A><b>3. </b><i>For though we walk in the flesh. Walking in the flesh </i>means here &#8212; <i>living it the world;</i> or, as he expresses it elsewhere,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.i-p46"></A>being at home in the body. (<a name="xvi.i-p46.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#006">2Co 5:6</a><a name="xvi.i-p46.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p47"></A>For he was shut up in the prison of his body. This, however, did not prevent the influence of the Holy Spirit from showing itself marvelously in his weakness. There is here again a kind of concession, which, at the same time, is of no service to his adversaries.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p48"></A>Those <i>war according to the flesh, </i>who attempt nothing but in dependence upon worldly resources, in which alone, too, they glory. They have not their confidence placed in the government and guidance of the Holy Spirit. Paul declares that he is not one of this class, inasmuch as he is furnished with other weapons 			 than those of the flesh and the world. Now, what he affirms respecting himself is applicable, also, to all true ministers of Christ.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_753"></A><A HREF="#fn_753"><FONT SIZE="1">754</FONT></A>
 			  For they</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.i-p50"></A>carry an inestimable treasure in earthen vessels,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p51"></A>as he had previously said. (<a name="xvi.i-p51.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#007">2Co 4:7</a><a name="xvi.i-p51.1"></A>.) Hence, however they may be surrounded with the infirmities of the flesh, the spiritual power of God, nevertheless, shines forth resplendently in them.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p52"></A><a name="xvi.i-p52.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p53"></A><b>4.</b> <i>For the weapons of our warfare.</i> The warfare corresponds with the kind of weapons. He glories in being furnished with <i>spiritual </i>weapons. The warfare, accordingly, is <i>spiritual. </i>Hence it follows by way of 			 contraries,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_754"></A><A HREF="#fn_754"><FONT SIZE="1">755</FONT></A>
 			  that it is <i>not according to the flesh</i> In comparing the ministry of the gospel to a <i>warfare,</i> he uses a most apt similitude. The life of a Christian, it is true, is a perpetual warfare, for whoever gives himself to the service of God will have no 			 truce from Satan at any time, but will be harassed with incessant disquietude. It becomes, however, ministers of the word and pastors to be standard-bearers, going before the others; and, certainly, there are none that Satan harasses more, that are more severely assaulted, or that sustain more numerous or more dreadful onsets. That man, therefore, is mistaken, who girds himself for the discharge of this office, and is not at the same time furnished with courage and bravery for contending; for 			 he is not exercised otherwise than in fighting. For we must take this into account, that the gospel is like a fire, by which the fury of Satan is en-kindled. Hence it cannot but be that he will arm himself for a contest, whenever he sees that it is advanced.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p55"></A>But by what weapons is he to be repelled? It is only by spiritual weapons that he can be repelled. Whoever, therefore, is unarmed with the influence of the Holy Spirit, however he may boast that he is a minister of Christ, will nevertheless, not prove himself to be such. At the same time, if you would have a full enumeration of spiritual weapons, doctrine must be conjoined with zeal, and a good conscience with the efficacy of the Spirit, and 			 with other necessary graces. Let now the Pope go, and assume to himself the apostolic dignity  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_755"></A><A HREF="#fn_755"><FONT SIZE="1">756</FONT></A>
 			 What could be more ridiculous, if our judgment is to be formed in accordance with the rule here laid down by Paul!</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p57"></A><i>Mighty through God.</i> Either <i>according to God, </i>or <i>from God. </i>I am of opinion, that there is here an implied antithesis, so that this <i>strength </i>is placed in contrast with the <i>weakness </i>which appears outwardly before the world, and thus, paying no regard to the judgments of men, he would seek from God approbation of his fortitude.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_756"></A><A HREF="#fn_756"><FONT SIZE="1">757</FONT></A>
 			  At the same time, the <i>antithesis </i>will hold good in another sense &#8212; that the power of his arms depends upon God, not upon the world.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p59"></A><i>In the demolishing of fortresses.</i> He makes use of the term <i>fortresses </i>to denote contrivances, and every high thing that is exalted against God,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_757"></A><A HREF="#fn_757"><FONT SIZE="1">758</FONT></A>
 			  as to which we shall find him speaking afterwards. It is, however, with propriety and expressiveness that he so designates them; for his design is to boast, that there is nothing in the world so strongly fortified as to be beyond his power to overthrow. I am well aware how carnal men glory in their empty shows, and how disdainfully and recklessly they despise me, as though there were nothing in me but what is mean and base, while they, in the mean time, were 			 standing on a lofty eminence. But their confidence is foolish, for that armor of the Lord, with which I fight, will prevail in opposition to all the bulwarks, in reliance upon which they believe themselves to be invincible. Now, as the world is accustomed to fortify itself in a twofold respect for waging war with Christ &#8212; on the one hand, by cunning, by wicked artifices, by subtilty, and other secret machinations; and, on the other hand, by cruelty and oppression, he touches upon both these 			 methods. For by <i>contrivances </i>he means, whatever pertains to carnal wisdom.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p61"></A>The term <i>high thing</i> denotes any kind of glory and power in this world. There is no reason, therefore, why a servant of Christ should dread anything, however formidable, that may stand up in opposition to his doctrine. Let him, in spite of it, persevere, and he will scatter to the winds every machination of 			 whatever sort. Nay more, the kingdom of Christ cannot be set up or established, otherwise than by throwing down everything in the world that is exalted. For nothing is more opposed to the spiritual wisdom of God than the wisdom of the flesh; nothing is more at variance with the grace of God than man&#8217;s natural ability, and so as to other things. Hence the only foundation of Christ&#8217;s kingdom is the abasement of men. And to this effect are those expressions in the Prophets:</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.i-p62"></A>The moon shall be ashamed, and the sun shall be confounded,<br> 			 when the Lord shall begin to reign in that day; (<a name="xvi.i-p62.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa024.htm#023">Isa 24:23</a><a name="xvi.i-p62.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p63"></A>Again,</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p64"></A>The loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the high looks of mortals shall be abased, and the Lord alone shall be <br> 			 exalted in that day.(<a name="xvi.i-p64.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#015">Isa 5:15</a><a name="xvi.i-p64.2"></A>, and <a name="xvi.i-p64.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#017">Isa 2:17</a><a name="xvi.i-p64.3"></A>)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p65"></A>Because, in order that God alone may shine forth, it is necessary that the glory of the world should vanish away.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p66"></A><a name="xvi.i-p66.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p67"></A><b>5.</b> <i>And bring into captivity</i> I am of opinion, that, having previously spoken more particularly of the conflict of spiritual armor, along with the hinderances that rise up in opposition to the gospel of Christ, he now, on the other hand, speaks of the ordinary preparation, by which men must be brought into subjection to him. 			 For so long as we rest in our own judgment, and are wise in our own estimation, we are far from having made any approach to the doctrine of Christ. Hence we must set out with this, that</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.i-p68"></A>he who is wise must become a fool, (<a name="xvi.i-p68.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#018">1Co 3:18</a><a name="xvi.i-p68.1"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p69"></A>that is, we must give up our own understanding, and renounce the wisdom of the flesh, and thus we must present our minds to Christ empty that he may fill them. Now the form of expression must be observed, when he says, that he <i>brings every thought into captivity, </i>for it is as though he had said, that the liberty of the human mind must be restrained and bridled, that it may not be wise, apart from the doctrine of Christ; and farther, 			 that its audacity cannot be restrained by any other means, than by its being carried away, as it were, <i>captive. </i>Now it is by the guidance of the Spirit, that it is brought to allow itself to be placed under control, and remain in a voluntary captivity.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p70"></A><a name="xvi.i-p70.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p71"></A><b>6.</b> <i>And are in readiness to avenge.</i> This he adds, lest insolent men should presumptuously lift themselves up in opposition to his ministry, as if they could do so with impunity. Hence he says, that power had been given him &#8212; not merely for constraining voluntary disciples to subjection to 			 Christ, but also for inflicting <i>vengeance </i>upon the rebellious,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_758"></A><A HREF="#fn_758"><FONT SIZE="1">759</FONT></A>
 			  and that his threats were not empty bugbears,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_759"></A><A HREF="#fn_759"><FONT SIZE="1">760</FONT></A>
 			  but had the execution quite in readiness &#8212; to use the customary expression. Now this vengeance is founded on Christ&#8217;s word &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.i-p74"></A>whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven. (<a name="xvi.i-p74.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#018">Mt 18:18</a><a name="xvi.i-p74.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p75"></A>For although God does not thunder forth immediately on the minister&#8217;s pronouncing the sentence, yet the decision is ratified,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_760"></A><A HREF="#fn_760"><FONT SIZE="1">761</FONT></A>
 			 and will be accomplished in its own time. Let it, however, be always understood, that it is when the minister fights with spiritual armor. Some understand it as referring to bodily punishments, by means of which the Apostles inflicted vengeance upon contumacious and impious persons; as for example, Peter struck Ananias and Sapphira dead, and Paul struck Elymas the sorcerer blind. (<a name="xvi.i-p76.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act005.htm#001">Ac 5:1-10</a><a name="xvi.i-p76.2"></A>, and 			 <a name="xvi.i-p76.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#006">Ac 13:6-11</a><a name="xvi.i-p76.3"></A>.) But the other meaning suits better, for the Apostles did not make use of that power invariably or indiscriminately. Paul, however, speaks in general terms that he has <i>vengeance </i>ready at hand against all the disobedient.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.i-p77"></A><i>When your obedience shall be fulfilled</i> How prudently he guards against alienating any by excessive severity! For as he had threatened to inflict punishment upon the rebellious, that he may not seem to provoke them, he declares that another duty had been enjoined upon him with regard to them &#8212; simply that of making them obedient to Christ. And, unquestionably, this is the 			 proper intention of the gospel, as he teaches both in the commencement and in the close of the Epistle to the Romans. (<a name="xvi.i-p77.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005">Ro 1:5</a><a name="xvi.i-p77.1"></A>, and <a name="xvi.i-p77.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#026">Ro 16:26</a><a name="xvi.i-p77.2"></A>.) Hence all Christian teachers ought carefully to observe this order, that they should first endeavor with gentleness to bring their 			 hearers to obedience, so as to invite them kindly before proceeding to inflict punishment upon rebellion.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_761"></A><A HREF="#fn_761"><FONT SIZE="1">762</FONT></A>
 			  Hence, too, Christ   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_762"></A><A HREF="#fn_762"><FONT SIZE="1">763</FONT></A>
 			  has given the commandment as to <i>loosing </i>before that of <i>binding.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_763"></A><A HREF="#fn_763"><FONT SIZE="1">764</FONT></A>

(<a name="xvi.ii-p15.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#024">Joh 7:24</a><a name="xvi.ii-p15.3"></A>, and <a name="xvi.ii-p15.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#015">Joh 8:15</a><a name="xvi.ii-p15.4"></A>.) Hence he reproves the Corinthians, because, contenting themselves with show, or appearance, they did not seriously consider, what kind of persons ought to be looked upon as the servants of Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p16"></A><i>If any one trusteth in himself</i> &#8212; an expression that is full of great confidence, for he takes it, as it were, for granted, that he is so certainly a minister of Christ, that this distinction cannot be taken from him. &#8220;Whoever,&#8221; says he, &#8220;is desirous to be looked upon as a minister of Christ, must necessarily count me in along with himself.&#8221; For what reason? 			 &#8220;<i>Let him</i>,&#8221; says he. &#8220;<i>think for himself</i>, for whatever things he may have in himself, that make him worthy of such an honor, the same will he find in me.&#8221; By this he hinted to them, that whoever they might be that reviled him, ought not to be looked upon as the servants of Christ. It would not become all to speak thus confidently, for it might certainly happen &#8212; nay, it happens every day, that they 			 same claim is haughtily advanced by persons, that are of no reputation, and are nothing else than a dishonor to Christ.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_765"></A><A HREF="#fn_765"><FONT SIZE="1">766</FONT></A>
 			  Paul, however, affirmed nothing respecting himself but what he had openly given proof of by clear and sure evidences among the Corinthians. Now should any one, while destitute of all proof of the reality, recommend himself in a similar manner, what would he do but expose himself to ridicule? To<i> trust in one&#8217;s self</i> is equivalent to assuming to one&#8217;s self power and authority on the pretext that he serves Christ, while 			 he is desirous to be held in estimation.</p>

<p><a name="xvi.ii-p19"></A><b>8.</b> <i>For though I should boast more largely of my authority</i>. It was a sign of modesty, that he put himself into the number of those, whom he greatly excelled. At the same time, he was not disposed to show such modesty, as not to retain his authority unimpaired. He accordingly adds, that he has said less than his 			 authority entitled him to say; for he was not one of the ordinary class of ministers, but was even distinguished among the Apostles. Hence he says: &#8220;Though I should boast more, <i>I should not be ashamed</i>, for there will be good ground for it.&#8221; He anticipates an objection, because he does not fail to speak of his own glory, while at the same time he refrains from making farther mention of it, that the 			 Corinthians may understand, that, if he boasts, it is against his will, as in truth the false Apostles constrained him to it; otherwise he would not have done so.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p20"></A>By the term <i>power</i> he means &#8212; the authority of his Apostleship, which he had among the Corinthians for, through all the ministers of the word have the same office in common, there are nevertheless, degrees of honor. Now God had placed Paul on a higher eminence than others, inasmuch as he had made use of his endeavors for founding  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_766"></A><A HREF="#fn_766"><FONT SIZE="1">767</FONT></A>
 			 that Church, and had in many ways put honor upon his Apostleship. Lest, however, malevolent persons should stir up odium against him, on the ground of his making use of the term <i>power</i>, he adds the purpose for which it was given him &#8212; the salvation of the Corinthians. Hence it follows, that it ought not to be irksome to them, or grievous, for who would not bear patiently, nay more, who would not love what he knows to be of advantage to him? In the mean time, there is an implied 			 contrast between his power, and that in which the false apostles gloried &#8212; which was of such a nature that the Corinthians received no advantage from it, and experienced no edification. There can, however, be no doubt, that all the ministers of the word are also, furnished with <i>power</i>; for of what sort were a preaching of the word, that was without <i>power</i>? Hence it is said to all &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.ii-p22"></A>He that heareth you, heareth me;<br> 			 he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me. (<a name="xvi.ii-p22.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#016">Lu 10:16</a><a name="xvi.ii-p22.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p23"></A>As however, many, on false grounds, claim for themselves what they have not, we must carefully observe, how far Paul extends his <i>power</i> &#8212; so as to be to the edification of believers. Those, then, who exercise <i>power</i> in the way of destroying the Church, prove themselves to be tyrants, and robbers &#8212; not pastors. In the <i>second</i> place, we must observe, that he declares, that it was given to him by God. He, therefore, that is 			 desirous to have any thing in his power to do, must have God as the Author of his power. Others, it is true, will boast of this also, as the Pope with full mouth thunders forth, that he is Christ&#8217;s vicar. But what evidence does he give of this?  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_767"></A><A HREF="#fn_767"><FONT SIZE="1">768</FONT></A>
 			 For Christ has not conferred <i>power</i> of this kind upon dumb persons, but upon the Apostles, and his other ministers, that the doctrine of his Gospel might not be without defense. Hence the whole <i>power</i> of ministers is included in the word &#8212; but in such a way, nevertheless, that Christ may always remain Lord and Master. Let us, therefore, bear in mind, that in lawful authority these two things are required &#8212; that it be given by God, and that it be exercised for the welfare 			 of the Church. It is well known, who they are, on whom God has conferred this <i>power</i>, and in what way he has limited the power he has given. Those exercise it in a proper manner, who faithfully obey his commandment.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p25"></A>Here, however, a question may be proposed. &#8220;God says to Jeremiah,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.ii-p26"></A>Behold, I set thee over the nations, and kingdoms, <br> 			 to plant, and to pluck up, to build and to destroy.<br> 			 (<a name="xvi.ii-p26.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#010">Jer 1:10</a><a name="xvi.ii-p26.3"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p27"></A>We have, also, found it stated a little before, (<a name="xvi.ii-p27.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005">2Co 10:5</a><a name="xvi.ii-p27.1"></A>) that the Apostles were set apart on the same footing &#8212; that they might destroy every thing that exalted itself against Christ. Nay more, the teachers of the gospel cannot build up in any other way, than by destroying the old man. Besides, they preach the gospel to the condemnation and 			 destruction of the wicked.&#8221; I answer that, what Paul says here, has nothing to do with the wicked, for he addresses the Corinthians, to whom he wished his Apostleship to be beneficial. With regard to them, I say, he could do nothing but with a view to edification. We have already observed, also, that this was expressly stated, that the Corinthians might know, that the authority of this holy man was not assailed by any one but Satan, the enemy of their salvation, while the design of that 			 authority was their edification.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.ii-p28"></A>At the same time, it is in other respects true in a general way, that the doctrine of the gospel has in its own nature a tendency to <i>edification</i> &#8212; not to <i>destruction</i>. For as to its destroying, that comes from something apart from itself &#8212; from the fault of mankind, while they stumble at the stone that was appointed form as a <i>foundation</i> (<a name="xvi.ii-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008">1Pe 2:8</a><a name="xvi.ii-p28.1"></A>.) As to the fact, that we are renewed after the image of God by the destruction of the old man &#8212; that is not at all at variance with Paul&#8217;s words, for in that case destruction is taken in a good sense, but here in a bad sense, as meaning the ruin of what is God&#8217;s, or as meaning the destruction of the soul &#8212; as if he had said, that his <i>power</i> was not injurious to them, for instead of this the advantage of it for their salvation was manifested.</p>

He was not less powerful in actions when present, than he was by words when absent. Hence it was unfair, that his bodily presence should be looked upon as contemptible. By <i>deed</i>, here, he means, in my opinion, the efficacy and success of his preaching, as well as the excellences that were worthy of an Apostle, and his whole manner of life. <i>Speech</i>, on the other hand, denotes &#8212; not the very substance of doctrine, but simply the form of it, and the bark, so to speak: for he would have contended for doctrine with greater keeness. The contempt, however, proceeded from this &#8212; that he was deficient in that ornament and splendor of eloquence, which secures favor.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_769"></A><A HREF="#fn_769"><FONT SIZE="1">770</FONT></A>

 			  As to this passage, however, there is no need of any other explanation than what may be gathered from the words themselves, for those are said to <i>commend themselves, </i>who, while in poverty and starvation as to true praise, exalt themselves in vain-glorious boasting, and falsely give out, that they are what they are not. This, also, appears from what follows.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.iii-p22"></A><i>But they measure themselves by themselves</i> Here he points out, as with his finger their folly. The man that has but one eye sees well enough among the blind: the man that is dull of hearing hears distinctly enough among the totally deaf. Such were those that were satisfied with themselves, and showed themselves off among others, simply because they did not look to any that were superior to themselves, for 			 if they had compared themselves with Paul, or any one like him, they would have felt constrained to lay aside immediately that foolish impression which they entertained, and would have exchanged boasting for shame.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.iii-p23"></A>For an explanation of this passage we need look no farther than to the monks; for as they are almost all of them the most ignorant asses, and at the same time are looked upon as learned persons, on account of their long robe and hood, if any one has merely a slight smattering of elegant literature, he proudly spreads out his feathers like a peacock &#8212; a marvelous fame goes abroad respecting him &#8212; among his companions he is 			 adored   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_773"></A><A HREF="#fn_773"><FONT SIZE="1">774</FONT></A>
 			  Were, however, the mask of the hood laid aside,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_774"></A><A HREF="#fn_774"><FONT SIZE="1">775</FONT></A>
 			  and a thorough examination entered upon, their vanity would at once be discovered. Why so? The old proverb holds good: &#8220;Ignorance is pert.&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_775"></A><A HREF="#fn_775"><FONT SIZE="1">776</FONT></A>
 			  But the excessively insolent arrogance of the monks   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_776"></A><A HREF="#fn_776"><FONT SIZE="1">777</FONT></A>

 			  it is not to be wondered, if the man that has but one eye is a king among the blind. Such were Paul&#8217;s rivals, for inwardly they flattered themselves, not considering what virtues entitled a person to true praise, and how far short they came of the excellence of Paul, and those like him. And, certainly, this single consideration might justly have covered them with shame, but it is the just punishment of the ambitious, that by their silliness they expose themselves to 			 ridicule, (than which there is nothing that they are more desirous to avoid,) and in place of glory, which they are immoderately desirous of,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_778"></A><A HREF="#fn_778"><FONT SIZE="1">779</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xvi.iii-p35"></A><i>A measure to reach.</i> By this clause he intimates, that he stands in no need of commendations expressed in words among the Corinthians, who were a portion of his glow, as he says elsewhere, (<a name="xvi.iii-p35.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#001">Php 4:1</a><a name="xvi.iii-p35.1"></A>,) <i>ye are my crown. </i>He carries out, however, the form of expression, which he had previously entered upon. &#8220;I have,&#8221; says he, &#8220;a most ample field for glorying, so as not to go beyond my own limits, and you are one department of that field.&#8221; He modestly reproves, however, their ingratitude,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_782"></A><A HREF="#fn_782"><FONT SIZE="1">783</FONT></A>
 			  in overlooking, in a manner, his apostleship, which ought to have been especially in estimation among them, on the ground of God&#8217;s commendation of it. In each clause, too, we must understand as implied, a contrast between him and the false Apostles, who had no such approbation to show.</p>

<p><a name="xvi.iii-p38"></A><b>14.</b> <i>For we do not overstretch.</i> He alludes to persons who either forcibly stretch out their arms, or raise themselves up on their feet, when wishing to catch hold of what is not at their hand,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_783"></A><A HREF="#fn_783"><FONT SIZE="1">784</FONT></A>
 			  for of this nature is a greedy thirst for glory, nay more, it is often more disgusting. For ambitious persons do not merely stretch out their arms and lift up their feet, but are even carried headlong with the view of obtaining some pretext for glorying.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_784"></A><A HREF="#fn_784"><FONT SIZE="1">785</FONT></A>
 			  He tacitly intimates that his rivals were of this stamp. He afterwards declares on what ground he had come to the Corinthians &#8212; because he had founded their church by his ministry. Hence he says, <i>in the gospel of Christ; </i>for he had not come to them empty,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_785"></A><A HREF="#fn_785"><FONT SIZE="1">786</FONT></A>
 			  but had been the first to bring the gospel to them. The preposition <i>in</i> is taken by some in another way; for they render it, <i>by </i>the gospel, and this meaning does not suit ill. At the same time, Paul seems to set off to advantage his coming to the Corinthians, on the ground of his having been furnished with so 			 precious a gift.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.iii-p42"></A><a name="xvi.iii-p42.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.iii-p43"></A><b>15.</b> <i>In the labors of others.</i> He now reproves more freely the false Apostles, who, while they had put forth their hand in the reaping of another man&#8217;s harvest, had the audacity at the same time to revile those, who had prepared a place for them at the expense of sweat and toil. Paul had built up the Church of 			 the Corinthians &#8212; not without the greatest struggle, and innumerable difficulties. Those persons afterwards come forward, and find the road made and the gate open. That they may appear persons of consequence, they impudently claim for themselves what did not of right belong to them, and disparage Paul&#8217;s labors.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.iii-p44"></A><i>But having hope.</i> He again indirectly reproves the Corinthians, because they had stood in the way of his making greater progress in advancing the gospel. For when he says that he hopes that, when <i>their faith is increased</i> the boundaries of his glowing will be enlarged, he intimates, that the 			 weakness of faith under which they labored was the reason, why his career had been somewhat retarded. &#8220;I ought now to have been employed in gaining over new Churches, and that too with your assistance, if you had made as much proficiency as you ought to have done; but now you retard me by your infirmity. I hope, however, that the Lord will grant, that greater progress will be made by you in future, and that in this way the glory of my ministry will be increased according to the rule of the 			 divine calling.&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_786"></A><A HREF="#fn_786"><FONT SIZE="1">787</FONT></A>
 			  To <i>glory in things that have been prepared</i> is equivalent to <i>glorying in the labors of others; </i>for, while Paul had fought the battle, <i>they </i>enjoyed the triumph.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_787"></A><A HREF="#fn_787"><FONT SIZE="1">788</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xvi.iii-p48"></A><b>17.</b> <i>But he that glorieth</i> This statement is made by way of correction, as his glorying might be looked upon as having the appearance of empty boasting. Hence he cites himself and others before the judgment-seat of God, saying, that those glory on good grounds, who are approved by God. To <i>glory 			 in the Lord, </i>however, is used here in a different sense from what it bears in the first chapter of the former Epistle, (<a name="xvi.iii-p48.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#031">1Co 1:31</a><a name="xvi.iii-p48.1"></A>,) and in <a name="xvi.iii-p48.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer009.htm#024">Jer 9:24</a><a name="xvi.iii-p48.2"></A>. For in those passages it means &#8212; to recognize God as the 			 author of all blessings, in such a way that every blessing is ascribed to his grace, while men do not extol themselves, but glorify him alone. Here, however, it means &#8212; to place our glory at the disposal of God alone,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_788"></A><A HREF="#fn_788"><FONT SIZE="1">789</FONT></A>
 			  and reckon every thing else as of no value. For while some are dependent on the estimation of men, and weigh themselves in the false balance of public opinion, and others are deceived by their own arrogance, Paul exhorts us to be emulous of this glow &#8212; that we may please the Lord, by whose judgment we all stand or fall.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.iii-p50"></A>Even heathens say, that true glory consists in an upright <i>conscience.</i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_789"></A><A HREF="#fn_789"><FONT SIZE="1">790</FONT></A>
 			  Now that is so much, but it is not all; for, as almost all are blind through excessive self-love, we cannot safely place confidence in the estimate that we form of ourselves. For we must keep in mind what he says elsewhere, (<a name="xvi.iii-p51.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#004">1Co 4:4</a><a name="xvi.iii-p51.5"></A>,) that he is not conscious to himself of anything wrong, and yet is <i>not thereby justified. </i>What then? Let us know, that to God alone must be 			 reserved the right of passing judgment upon us; for we are not competent judges in our own cause. This meaning is confirmed by what follows &#8212;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.iii-p52"></A><a name="xvi.iii-p52.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvi.iii-p53"></A> <i>For not he that commendeth himself is approved</i> &#8220;For it is easy to impose upon men by a false impression, and this is matter of every day occurrence. Let us, therefore, leaving off all other things, aim exclusively at this &#8212; that we may be approved by God, and may be satisfied to have his approbation alone, as it justly ought to be regarded by us 			 as of more value than all the applauses of the whole world. There was one that said, that to have Plato&#8217;s favorable judgment was to him worth a thousand.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_790"></A><A HREF="#fn_790"><FONT SIZE="1">791</FONT></A>
 			  The question here is not as to the judgment of mankind, in respect of the superiority of one to another, but as to the sentence of God himself, who has it in his power to overturn all the decisions that men have pronounced.</p>

For this reason, Paul, in the passage which I lately quoted, when he threatens vengeance against unbelievers, immediately adds 				  &#8212; <i>after that your obedience shall have been fulfilled;</i> (<a name="xvi.i-p80.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#006">2Co 10:6</a><a name="xvi.i-p80.3"></A>) for he means, that it belongs peculiarly to the gospel to invite all to salvation, but that it is accidental to it that it brings destruction to any.&#8221; &#8212; Calvin on John, vol. 2, p. 273. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xvi.iii-p24"></A> &#8220;The principal places in the public schools of learning were filled very frequently by monks of the mendicant orders. This unhappy circumstance prevented their emerging from that ignorance and darkness which had so long enveloped them; and it also rendered them inaccessible to that auspicious light of improved science, whose salutary beams had already been felt in several of the European provinces. The instructors of youth, 				  dignified with the venerable titles of Artists, Grammarians, Physicians, and Dialecticians, loaded the memories of their laborious pupils with a certain quantity of barbarous terms, arid and senseless distinctions, and scholastic precepts delivered in the most inelegant style, and all such that could repeat this jargon with a certain readiness and rapidity were considered as men of uncommon eloquence and erudition. The whole body of the philosophers extolled Aristotle beyond all measure, while 				  scarcely any studied him, and none understood him.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Mosheim&#8217;s </i>Ecclesiastical History, (Lond. 1825,) volume 4  &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>
