<span id="x-p1"></span>CHAPTER 4

<span id="x.i"></span>

<span id="x.i-p1"></span><span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>[2 Corinthians
4:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#001.md)<span id="x.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p2"></span>**1.** Therefore seeing we have this ministry,
as we have received mercy, we faint not;

<span id="x.i-p3"></span>**1.** Quamobrem habentes ministerium hoc,
sicuti misericordiam sumus consequuti, non deficimus,

<span id="x.i-p4"></span>**2.** But have renounced the hidden things of
dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God
deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to
every man’s conscience in the sight of God.

<span id="x.i-p5"></span>**2.** Sed reiicimus latebras dedecoris, non
ambulantes in astutia, neque dolo tractantes sermonem Dei: sed
manifestatione veritatis commendantes nos apud omnem conscientiam
hominum coram Deo.

<span id="x.i-p6"></span>**3.** But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to
them that are lost:

<span id="x.i-p7"></span>**3.** Si autem velatum est Evangelium nostrum:
in iis qui pereunt velatum est.

<span id="x.i-p8"></span>**4.** In whom the god of this world hath
blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the
glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto
them.

<span id="x.i-p9"></span>**4.** Quibus deus saeculi hujus excoecavit
sensus: nempe infidelibus, ut ne illis resplendeat claritas Evangelii
gloriæ Christi, qui est imago Dei invisibilis.

<span id="x.i-p10"></span>**5.** For we preach not ourselves, but Christ
Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus’ sake.

<span id="x.i-p11"></span>**5.** Non enim nosmet ipsos praedicamus, sed
Iesum Christum Dominum; nos veto servos vestros propter Iesum.

<span id="x.i-p12"></span>**6.** For God, who commanded the light to
shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to *give* the light of
the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

<span id="x.i-p13"></span>**6.** Quoniam Deus qui iussit e tenebris
lumen splendescere, idem illuxit in cordibus nostris ad illuminationem
cognitionis gloriæ Dei in facie Iesu Christi.

<span id="x.i-p14"></span> 

<span id="x.i-p15"></span><span id="x.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p16"></span>**1.** *Having this ministry.* He now returns
to a commendation of himself personally, from which he had digressed
into a general discussion, in reference to the dignity of the gospel.
As, therefore, he has been treating of the nature of the gospel, so he
now shows how faithful and upright a minister of it he is. He has
previously shown, what is the true gospel of Christ. He now shows what
he preaches to be such. *“Having,”* says he, “*this ministry”* — that
*ministry,* the excellence of which he had extolled in terms so
magnificent, and the power and usefulness of which he had so abundantly
shown forth. Hence, in order that he may not seem to extol himself too
much, he premises that it was not by his own efforts, or by his own
merits, that he had reached such a pinnacle of honor, but had been led
forward by the mercy of God exclusively. Now there was more implied in
making the *mercy* of God the reason of his Apostleship, than if he had
attributed it to the *grace* of God. *We faint not*  <span
id="fr_422"></span>[423](#fn_422.md) that is, we are not deficient in our
duty,  <span id="fr_423"></span>[424](#fn_423.md) so as not to discharge it
with fidelity.

<span id="x.i-p19"></span><span id="x.i-p19.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p20"></span>**2.** *But renounce the hidden things.* While
he commends his own sincerity,  <span id="fr_424"></span>[425](#fn_424.md)
he, on the other hand, indirectly reproves the false Apostles, who,
while they corrupted by their ambition the genuine excellence of the
gospel, were, nevertheless, desirous of exclusive distinction. Hence the
faults, from which he declares himself to be exempt, he indirectly
imputes to them. By the *hidden things of disgrace,* or *concealments,*
some understand the shadows of the Mosaic law. Chrysostom understands
the expression to mean the vain show, by which they endeavored to
recommend themselves. I understand by it — all the disguises, with which
they adulterated the pure and native beauty of the gospel. For as chaste
and virtuous women, satisfied with the gracefulness of natural beauty,
do not resort to artificial adornings, while harlots never think
themselves sufficiently adorned, unless they have corrupted nature, so
Paul glories in having set forth the pure gospel, while others set forth
one that was disguised, and covered over with unseemly additions. For as
they were ashamed of the simplicity of Christ, or at least could not
have distinction  <span id="fr_425"></span>[426](#fn_425.md) from true
excellencies of Apostles, they framed a new gospel, not unlike a profane
philosophy, swelled up with empty bombast, while altogether devoid of
the efficacy of the Spirit. Spurious ornaments of this nature,  <span
id="fr_426"></span>[427](#fn_426.md) by which the gospel is disfigured, he
calls the *concealments of disgrace,* because the nakedness of those,
who have recourse to concealments and disguises, must of necessity be
dishonorable and disgraceful.

<span id="x.i-p24"></span>As to himself, he says that he rejects or
disdains disguises, because Christ’s face, the more that it is seen
opened up to view in his preaching, shines forth so much the more
gloriously. I do not, however, deny, that he alludes at the same time to
the veil of Moses, (<span id="x.i-p24.1"></span>[Ex
34:33](../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#033)<span id="x.i-p24.1"></span>,.md) of
which he had made mention, but he ascribes a quite different veil to the
false Apostles. For Moses covered his face, because the excessive
brightness of the glory of the law could not be endured by tender and
blear eyes. They,  <span id="fr_427"></span>[428](#fn_427.md) on the other
hand, put on a veil by way of ornament. Besides, as they would be
despicable, nay, infamous, if the simplicity of the gospel shone forth,
they, on this account, hide their shame under ever so many cloaks and
masks.

<span id="x.i-p26"></span>*Not walking in craftiness.* There can be no
doubt, that the false Apostles delighted themselves greatly in the
*craftiness* that Paul reproves, as though it had been a distinguished
excellence, as we see even at this day some, even of those who profess
the gospel, who would rather be esteemed subtile than sincere, and
sublime rather than solid, while in the mean time all their refinement
is mere childishness. But what would you do? It delights them to have a
name for acuteness, and they have, under that pretext, applause among
the ignorant.  <span id="fr_428"></span>[429](#fn_428.md) We learn,
however, in what estimation Paul holds this appearance of excellence.
*Craftiness* he declares to be unworthy of Christ’s servants.

<span id="x.i-p28"></span>As to what follows — *nor handling
deceitfully* — I am not sure that this sufficiently brings out Paul’s
meaning; for the verb <span id="x.i-p28.1"></span>δολοῦν does not so
properly mean *acting fraudulently,* as what is called falsifying  <span
id="fr_429"></span>[430](#fn_429.md) as horse-jockeys  <span
id="fr_430"></span>[431](#fn_430.md) are wont to do. In this passage, at
least, it is placed in contrast with upright preaching, agreeably to
what follows.

<span id="x.i-p31"></span>*But by manifestation of the truth* He claims
to himself this praise — that he had proclaimed the pure doctrine of the
gospel in simplicity and without disguise, and has the *consciences of
all* as witnesses of this *in the sight of God.* As he has placed the
*manifestation of the truth* in contrast with the disguised  <span
id="fr_431"></span>[432](#fn_431.md) doctrine of the sophists, so he
appeals the decision to their consciences, and to the judgment-seat of
God, whereas they abused the mistaken judgment of men, or their corrupt
affection, and were not so desirous to be in reality worthy of praise as
they were eager to appear so. Hence we infer, that there is a contrast
here between the *consciences* of men and their *ears.* Let the servants
of Christ, therefore, reckon it enough to have approved their integrity
to the *consciences of men in the sight of God,* and pay no regard to
the corrupt inclinations of men, or to popular applause.

<span id="x.i-p33"></span><span id="x.i-p33.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p34"></span>**3.** *But if our gospel is hid* It might
have been an easy thing to pour calumny upon what he had said as to the
clearness of his preaching, because he had many adversaries. That
calumny he repels with stern authority, for he threatens all who do not
acknowledge the power of his gospel, and warns them that this is a token
of reprobation and ruin. *“*Should any one affirm that he does not
perceive that manifestation of Christ of which I boast, he clearly shows
himself, by this very token, to be a reprobate,  <span
id="fr_432"></span>[433](#fn_432.md) for my sincerity in the work of
instructing  <span id="fr_433"></span>[434](#fn_433.md) is clearly and
distinctly perceived by all that have eyes. Those, therefore, from whom
it is hid, must be blind, and destitute of all rational understanding.”
The sum is this — that the blindness of unbelievers detracts nothing
from the clearness of his gospel; for the sun is not less resplendent,
that the blind do not perceive his light.  <span
id="fr_434"></span>[435](#fn_434.md)

<span id="x.i-p38"></span>But some one will say that this applies
equally to the law, for in itself it is a *lamp*  <span
id="fr_435"></span>[436](#fn_435.md) *to guide our feet,* (<span
id="x.i-p39.2"></span>[Ps 119:105](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#105.md)<span
id="x.i-p39.2"></span>,) *enlightens the eyes,* (<span
id="x.i-p39.3"></span>[Ps 19:8](../../../bib/kjv/psa019.htm#008.md)<span
id="x.i-p39.3"></span>,) etc., and is hid only from those that perish. I
answer that, when Christ is included in the law, the sun shines forth
through the midst of the clouds, so that men have light enough for their
use; but when Christ is disjoined from it, there is nothing left but
darkness, or a false appearance of light, that dazzles men’s eyes
instead of assisting them. It is, however, a token of great confidence,
that he ventures to regard as reprobates all that reject his doctrine.
It is befitting, however, that all that would be looked upon as
ministers of God’s word should be endued with the like confidence, that
with a fearless confidence they may unhesitatingly summon all the
adversaries of their doctrine to the judgment-seat of God, that they may
bring thence a sure condemnation.

<span id="x.i-p40"></span><span id="x.i-p40.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p41"></span>**4.** *Whose minds the god of this world* He
intimates, that no account should be made of their perverse obstinacy.
“They do not see,” says he, “the sun at mid-day, because *the devil has
blinded their understandings.”* No one that judges rightly can have any
doubt, that it is of Satan that the Apostle speaks. Hilary, as he had to
do with Arians, who abused this passage, so as to make it a pretext for
denying Christ’s true divinity, while they at the same time confessed
him to be God, twists the text in this way — “God hath blinded the
understandings of this world.” In this he was afterwards followed by
Chrysostom, with the view of not conceding to the Manicheans their *two
first principles.*  <span id="fr_436"></span>[437](#fn_436.md) What
influenced Ambrose does not appear. Augustine had the same reason as
Chrysostom, having to contend with the Manicheans.

<span id="x.i-p43"></span>We see what the heat of controversy does in
carrying on disputes. Had all those men calmly read Paul’s words, it
would never have occurred to any one of them to twist them in this way
into a forced meaning; but as they were harassed by their opponents,
they were more concerned to refute them, than to investigate Paul’s
meaning. But what occasion was there for this? For the subterfuge of the
Arians was childish — that if the devil is called the *god of this
world,* the name of God, as applied to Christ, does not express a true,
eternal, and exclusive divinity. For Paul says elsewhere, *many are
called gods,* (<span id="x.i-p43.1"></span>[1Co
8:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#005)<span id="x.i-p43.1"></span>;.md) but
David, on the other hand, sings forth — *the gods of the nations are
demons.*  <span id="fr_437"></span>[438](#fn_437.md) (<span
id="x.i-p44.8"></span>[Ps 96:5](../../../bib/kjv/psa096.htm#005.md)<span
id="x.i-p44.8"></span>.) When, therefore, the devil is called the *god*
of the wicked, on the ground of his having dominion over them, and being
worshipped by them in the place of God, what tendency has this to
detract from the honor of Christ? And as to the Manicheans, this
appellation gives no more countenance to the Manicheans, than when he is
called the *prince of this world.* (<span id="x.i-p44.9"></span>[Joh
14:30](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030)<span id="x.i-p44.9"></span>..md)
 <span id="fr_438"></span>[439](#fn_438.md)

<span id="x.i-p46"></span>There is, therefore, no reason for being
afraid to interpret this passage as referring to the devil, there being
no danger in doing so. For should the Arians come forward and contend,
 <span id="fr_439"></span>[440](#fn_439.md) that Christ’s divine essence is
no more proved from his having the appellation *God* applied to him,
than Satan’s is proved from its being applied to *him,* a cavil of this
nature is easily refuted; for Christ is called God without any addition,
 <span id="fr_440"></span>[441](#fn_440.md) nay, he is called *God blessed
for ever.* (<span id="x.i-p48.2"></span>[Ro
9:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#005)<span id="x.i-p48.2"></span>..md) He
is said to be that God who was

<span id="x.i-p49"></span>in the beginning, before the creation of the
world.  
(<span id="x.i-p49.2"></span>[Joh
1:1-3](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001)<span id="x.i-p49.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.i-p50"></span>The devil, on the other hand, is called the
*god of this world,* in no other way than as Baal is called the god of
those that worship him, or as the dog is called the god of Egypt.  <span
id="fr_441"></span>[442](#fn_441.md) The Manicheans, as I have said, for
maintaining their delusion, have recourse to other declarations of
Scripture, as well as this, but there is no difficulty in refuting those
also. They contend not so much respecting the *term,* as respecting the
*power.* As the *power* of *blinding* is ascribed to Satan, and dominion
over unbelievers, they conclude from this that he is, from his own
resources, the author of all evil, so as not to be subject to God’s
control — as if Scripture did not in various instances declare, that
devils, no less than the angels of heaven, are servants of God, each of
them severally in his own manner. For, as the latter dispense to us
God’s benefits for our salvation, so the former execute his wrath. Hence
good angels are called *powers* and *principalities,* (<span
id="x.i-p51.3"></span>[Eph 3:10](../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010.md)<span
id="x.i-p51.3"></span>,) but it is simply because they exercise the
power given them by God. For the same reason Satan is *the prince of
this world,* not as if he conferred dominion upon himself, or obtained
it by his own right, or, in fine, exercised it at his own pleasure. On
the contrary, he has only so much as the Lord allows him. Hence
Scripture does not merely make mention of the good spirit of God, and
good angels, but he also speaks of evil spirits of God. *An* *evil
spirit from God came upon Saul.* (<span id="x.i-p51.4"></span>[1Sa
16:14](../../../bib/kjv/sa1016.htm#014)<span id="x.i-p51.4"></span>..md)
Again, chastisements through means of *evil angels.* (<span
id="x.i-p51.5"></span>[Ps 78:49](../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#049.md)<span
id="x.i-p51.5"></span>.)

<span id="x.i-p52"></span>With respect to the passage before us, the
*blinding* is a work common to God and to Satan, for it is in many
instances ascribed to God; but the *power* is not alike, nor is the
*manner* the same. I shall not speak at present as to the manner.
Scripture, however, teaches that Satan *blinds* men,  <span
id="fr_442"></span>[443](#fn_442.md) not merely with God’s permission, but
even by his command, that he may execute his vengeance. Thus Ahab was
deceived by Satan, (<span id="x.i-p53.2"></span>[1Ki
22:21](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#021)<span id="x.i-p53.2"></span>,.md)
but could Satan have done this of himself? By no means; but having
offered to God his services for inflicting injury, he was sent to be a

<span id="x.i-p54"></span>lying spirit in the mouth of all his
prophets.  
(<span id="x.i-p54.2"></span>[1Ki
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#022)<span id="x.i-p54.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.i-p55"></span>Nay more, the reason why God is said to
*blind* men is, that after having deprived us of the right exercise of
the understanding, and the light of his Spirit, he delivers us over to
the devil, to be hurried forward by him to a *reprobate mind,* (<span
id="x.i-p55.1"></span>[Ro 1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028.md)<span
id="x.i-p55.1"></span>,) gives him the power of deception, and by this
means inflicts just vengeance upon us by the minister of his wrath.
Paul’s meaning, therefore, is, that all are possessed by the devil, who
do not acknowledge his doctrine to be the sure truth of God. For it is
more severe to call them slaves of the devil,  <span
id="fr_443"></span>[444](#fn_443.md) than to ascribe their blindness to the
judgment of God. As, however, he had a little before adjudged such
persons to destruction, (<span id="x.i-p56.1"></span>[2Co
4:3](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#003)<span id="x.i-p56.1"></span>,.md) he
now adds that they perish, for no other reason than that they have drawn
down ruin upon themselves, as the effect of their own unbelief.

<span id="x.i-p57"></span>*Lest the light of the glorious gospel of
Christ should shine upon them.* This serves to confirm what he had said
— that if any one rejected his gospel, it was his own blindness that
prevented him from receiving it. “For nothing,” says he, “appears in it
but Christ, and that not obscurely, but so as to shine forth clearly.”
He adds, that Christ is the *image of God,* by which he intimates that
they were utterly devoid of the knowledge of God, in accordance with
that statement —

<span id="x.i-p58"></span>He that knoweth not me knoweth not my
Father.  
(<span id="x.i-p58.2"></span>[Joh
14:7](../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#007)<span id="x.i-p58.2"></span>..md)

<span id="x.i-p59"></span>This then is the reason, why he pronounced so
severe a sentence upon those that had doubts as to his Apostleship —
because they did not behold Christ, who might there be distinctly
beheld. It is doubtful whether he employed the expression, *the gospel
of the glory of Christ,* as meaning the glorious gospel, agreeably to
the Hebrew idiom; or whether he means by it — the gospel, in which
Christ’s glory shone forth. The *second* of these meanings I rather
prefer, as having in it more completeness.

<span id="x.i-p60"></span>When, however, Christ is called the *image of
the invisible God,* this is not meant merely of his essence, as being
the “co-essential of the Father,” as they speak,  <span
id="fr_444"></span>[445](#fn_444.md) but rather has a reference to us,
because he represents the Father to us. The Father himself is
represented as *invisible,* because he is in himself not apprehended by
the human understanding. He exhibits himself, however, to us by his Son,
and makes himself in a manner visible.  <span
id="fr_445"></span>[446](#fn_445.md) I state this, because the ancients,
having been greatly incensed against the Arians, insisted more than was
befitting on this point — how it is that the Son is inwardly the *image
of the Father* by a secret unity of essence, while they passed over what
is mainly for edification — in what respects he is the *image of God* to
us, when he manifests to us what had otherwise been hid in him. Hence
the term *image* has a reference to us, as we shall see again presently
 <span id="fr_446"></span>[447](#fn_446.md) The epithet *invisible,* though
omitted in some Greek manuscripts, I have preferred to retain, as it is
not superfluous.  <span id="fr_447"></span>[448](#fn_447.md)

<span id="x.i-p65"></span><span id="x.i-p65.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p66"></span>**5.** *For we preach not ourselves* Some make
this to be an instance of *Zeugma,*  <span
id="fr_448"></span>[449](#fn_448.md) in this manner: We preach not
ourselves to be lords, but God’s only Son, whom the Father has set over
all things, to be the one Lord.  <span id="fr_449"></span>[450](#fn_449.md)
I do not, indeed, find fault with that interpretation, but as the
expression is more emphatic <span id="x.i-p68.2"></span>(εμφατικωτερα)
and has a more extensive signification,  <span
id="fr_450"></span>[451](#fn_450.md) when it is said, that one *preaches
himself.* I am more inclined to retain this interpretation, especially
as it is almost unanimously approved of. For there are other ways in
which men *preach themselves,* than by arrogating to themselves
dominion, as for example, when they aim at show, rather than at
edification — when they are desirous in any way to have distinction —
when, farther, they make gain of the gospel. Ambition, therefore, and
avarice, and similar vices in a minister, taint the purity of his
doctrine, so that Christ has not there the exclusive distinction. Hence,
he that would preach Christ alone, must of necessity forget himself.

<span id="x.i-p70"></span>*And ourselves your servants.* Lest any one
should mutter out the objection—”But in the mean time you say many
things respecting yourself,” he answers, that he desires nothing
farther, than that he should be their *servant.* “Whatever things I
declare respecting myself (so loftily, and boastfully, in your opinion)
have this object in view — that I may in Christ *serve* you
advantageously.” It follows, that the Corinthians are excessively proud
and ungrateful, if they reject this condition. Nay more, it follows,
that they had been previously of a corrupt judgment, inasmuch as they
had not perceived his holy affection.

<span id="x.i-p71"></span>Here, however, all pastors of the Church are
admonished as to their state and condition, for by whatever title of
honor they may be distinguished, they are nothing more than the
*servants* of believers, and unquestionably, they cannot serve Christ,
without serving his Church at the same time. An honorable servitude, it
is true, this is, and superior to any principality,  <span
id="fr_451"></span>[452](#fn_451.md) but still it is a *servitude,* so that
Christ alone may be elevated to distinction — not encumbered by the
shadow of a single rival  <span id="fr_452"></span>[453](#fn_452.md) Hence
it is the part of a good pastor, not merely to keep aloof from all
desire of domineering, but to regard it as the highest pitch of honor,
at which he aspires — that he may *serve* the people of God. It is the
duty of the people, on the other hand, to esteem the servants of Christ
first of all on the ground of the dignity of their Master, and then
farther on account of the dignity and excellence of their office, that
they may not despise those, whom the Lord has placed in so illustrious a
station.

<span id="x.i-p74"></span><span id="x.i-p74.1"></span>

<span id="x.i-p75"></span>**6.** *God who commanded light to shine out
of darkness.* I see that this passage may be explained in four different
ways. In the *first* place thus: “God has *commanded light to shine
forth out of darkness:* that is, by the ministry of men, who are in
their own nature *darkness,* He has brought forward the *light* of His
gospel into the world.” *Secondly,* thus: “God has made the *light* of
the gospel to take the place of the law, which was wrapt up in *dark*
shadows, and thus, He has brought *light* out of *darkness*.” Those that
are fond of subtleties, would be prepared readily to receive expositions
of that sort, but any one, who will examine the matter more closely,
will perceive, that they do not correspond with the Apostle’s intention.
The *third* exposition is that of Ambrose: “When all things were
involved in darkness, God kindled up the light of His gospel. For
mankind were sunk in the darkness of ignorance, when God on a sudden
shone forth upon them by his gospel.” The *fourth* is that of
Chrysostom, who is of opinion, that Paul alluded to the creation of the
world, in this way: “God, who by his word created light, drawing it, as
it were, out of the darkness  <span id="fr_453"></span>[454](#fn_453.md) —
that same Being has now enlightened us in a spiritual manner, when we
were buried in darkness.” This transition,  <span
id="fr_454"></span>[455](#fn_454.md) from light that is visible and
corporeal to what is spiritual, has more of elegance, and there is
nothing forced in it. The preceding one,  <span
id="fr_455"></span>[456](#fn_455.md) however, is not unsuitable. Let every
one follow his own judgment.

<span id="x.i-p79"></span>*Hath shined in our hearts.* He speaks of a
twofold illumination, which must be carefully observed — the one is that
of the gospel, the other is secret, taking place in our hearts.  <span
id="fr_456"></span>[457](#fn_456.md) For as God, the Creator of the world,
pours forth upon us the brightness of the sun, and gives us eyes to
receive it, so, as the Redeemer, in the person of his Son, He shines
forth, indeed, upon us by His gospel, but, as we are blind, that would
be in vain, if He did not at the same time enlighten our understandings
by His Spirit. His meaning, therefore, is, that God has, by His Spirit,
opened the eyes of our understandings, so as to make them capable of
receiving the light of the gospel.

<span id="x.i-p81"></span>*In the face of Jesus Christ.* In the same
sense in which he had previously said that Christ is the *image of the
Father,* (<span id="x.i-p81.1"></span>[2Co
4:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#004)<span id="x.i-p81.1"></span>.md) he
now says, that the glory of God is manifested to us *in his face.* Here
we have a remarkable passage, from which we learn that God is not to be
*sought out* (<span id="x.i-p81.2"></span>[Job
11:7](../../../bib/kjv/job011.htm#007)<span id="x.i-p81.2"></span>.md) in
His unsearchable height,

<span id="x.i-p82"></span>(for He dwells in light that is inaccessible,
<span id="x.i-p82.1"></span>[1Ti
6:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#016)<span id="x.i-p82.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="x.i-p83"></span>but is to be known by us, in so far as He
manifests himself in Christ. Hence, whatever men desire to know
respecting God, apart from Christ, is evanescent, for they wander out of
the way. True, indeed, God in Christ appears in the first instance to be
mean, but he appears at length to be glorious in the view of those, who
hold on, so as to come from the cross to the resurrection.  <span
id="fr_457"></span>[458](#fn_457.md) Again we see, that in the word person
 <span id="fr_458"></span>[459](#fn_458.md) there is a reference made to
us,  <span id="fr_459"></span>[460](#fn_459.md) because it is more
advantageous for us to behold God, as He appears in His only-begotten
Son, than to search out His secret essence.

<span id="x.ii-p18"></span><span id="x.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p19"></span>**7.** *But we have this treasure.* Those
that heard Paul glorying in such a magnificent strain as to the
excellence of his ministry, and beheld, on the other hand, his person,
contemptible and abject in the eyes of the world, might be apt to think
that he was a silly and ridiculous person, and might look upon his
boasting as childish, while forming their estimate of him from the
meanness of his person.  <span id="fr_463"></span>[464](#fn_463.md) The
wicked, more particularly, caught hold of this pretext, when they wished
to bring into contempt every thing that was in him. What, however, he
saw to be most of all unfavorable to the honor of his Apostleship among
the ignorant, he turns by an admirable contrivance into a means of
advancing it. First of all, he employs the similitude of a *treasure,*
which is not usually laid up in a splendid and elegantly adorned chest,
but rather in some *vessel* that is mean and worthless;  <span
id="fr_464"></span>[465](#fn_464.md) and then farther, he subjoins, that
the *power of God* is, by that means, the more illustrated, and is the
better seen. “Those, who allege the contemptible appearance of my
person, with the view of detracting from the dignity of my ministry, are
unfair and unreasonable judges, for a *treasure* is not the less
valuable, that the vessel, in which it is deposited, is not a precious
one. Nay more, it is usual for great *treasures* to be laid up in
earthen pots. Farther, they do not consider, that it is ordered by the
special Providence of God, that there should be in ministers no
appearance of excellence, lest any thing of distinction should throw the
*power of God* into the shade. As, therefore, the abasement of
ministers, and the outward contempt of their persons give occasion for
glory accruing to God, that man acts a wicked part, who measures the
dignity of the gospel by the person of the minister.”

<span id="x.ii-p22"></span>Paul, however, does not speak merely of the
universal condition of mankind, but of his own condition in particular.
It is true, indeed, that all mortal men are *earthen vessels* Hence, let
the most eminent of them all be selected, and let him be one that is
adorned to admiration with all ornaments of birth, intellect, and
fortune,  <span id="fr_465"></span>[466](#fn_465.md) still, if he be a
minister of the gospel, he will be a mean and merely *earthen*
depository of an inestimable *treasure* Paul, however, has in view
himself, and others like himself, his associates, who were held in
contempt, because they had nothing of show.

<span id="x.ii-p24"></span><span id="x.ii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p25"></span>**8.** *While we are pressed on every side.*
This is added by way of explanation, for he shows, that his abject
condition is so far from detracting from the glory of God, that it is
the occasion of advancing it. “We are reduced,” says he, “to straits,
but the Lord at length opens up for us an outlet;  <span
id="fr_466"></span>[467](#fn_466.md) we are oppressed with poverty, but the
Lord affords us help. Many enemies are in arms against us, but under
God’s protection we are safe. In fine, though we are brought low, so
that it might seem as if all were over with us,  <span
id="fr_467"></span>[468](#fn_467.md) still we do not perish.” The last is
the severest of all. You see, how he turns to his own advantage every
charge that the wicked bring against him.  <span
id="fr_468"></span>[469](#fn_468.md)

<span id="x.ii-p29"></span><span id="x.ii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p30"></span>**10.** *The mortification of Jesus*  <span
id="fr_469"></span>[470](#fn_469.md) He says more than he had done
previously, for he shows, that the very thing that the false apostles
used as a pretext for despising the gospel, was so far from bringing any
degree of contempt upon the gospel, that it tended even to render it
glorious. For he employs the expression — *the mortification of Jesus
Christ* — to denote everything that rendered him contemptible in the
eyes of the world, with the view of preparing him for participating in a
blessed resurrection. In the first place, the sufferings of Christ,
 <span id="fr_470"></span>[471](#fn_470.md) however ignominious they may be
in the eyes of men, have, nevertheless, more of honor in the sight of
God, than all the triumphs of emperors, and all the pomp of kings. The
end, however, must also be kept in view, that we *suffer with him,* that
we may be *glorified together with him.* (<span
id="x.ii-p32.2"></span>[Ro 8:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#017.md)<span
id="x.ii-p32.2"></span>.) Hence he elegantly reproves the madness of
those, who made his peculiar fellowship with Christ a matter of
reproach. At the same time, the Corinthians are admonished to take heed,
lest they should, while haughtily despising Paul’s mean and abject
appearance, do an injury to Christ himself, by seeking an occasion of
reproach  <span id="fr_471"></span>[472](#fn_471.md) in his sufferings,
which it becomes us to hold in the highest honor.

<span id="x.ii-p34"></span>The word rendered *mortification,*  <span
id="fr_472"></span>[473](#fn_472.md) is taken here in a different sense
from what it bears in many passages of Scripture. For it often means
self-denial, when we renounce the lusts of the flesh, and are renewed
unto obedience to God. Here, however, it means the afflictions by which
we are stirred up to meditate on the termination of the present life. To
make the matter more plain, let us call the former the *inward*
mortification, and the latter the *outward.* Both make us conformed to
Christ, the one directly, the other indirectly, so to speak. Paul speaks
of the former in <span id="x.ii-p35.1"></span>[Col
3:5](../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005.md)<span id="x.ii-p35.1"></span>, and
in <span id="x.ii-p35.2"></span>[Ro
6:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#006.md)<span id="x.ii-p35.2"></span>,
where he teaches that

<span id="x.ii-p36"></span>our old man is crucified, that we may walk in
newness of life

<span id="x.ii-p37"></span>He treats of the second in <span
id="x.ii-p37.1"></span>[Ro 8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029.md)<span
id="x.ii-p37.1"></span>, where he teaches, that we were *predestinated*
by God to this end — that we might be *conformed to the image of his
Son.* It is called, however, a *mortification* of Christ only in the
case of believers, because the wicked, in the endurance of the
afflictions of this present life, share with Adam, but the elect have
participation with the Son of God, so that all those miseries that are
in their own nature accursed, are helpful to their salvation. All the
sons of God, it is true, have this in common, that they *bear about the
mortification, of Christ;*  <span id="fr_473"></span>[474](#fn_473.md) but,
according as any one is distinguished by a larger measure of gifts, he,
in that proportion, comes so much the nearer to conformity with Christ
in this respect.

<span id="x.ii-p39"></span>*That the life of Jesus.* Here is the best
antidote to adversity — that as Christ’s death is the gate of life, so
we know that a blessed resurrection will be to us the termination of all
miseries,  <span id="fr_474"></span>[475](#fn_474.md) inasmuch as Christ
has associated us with himself on this condition, that we shall be
partakers of his life, if in this world we submit to die with him.

<span id="x.ii-p41"></span>The sentence that immediately follows may be
explained in two ways. If you understand the expression *delivered unto
death* as meaning to be incessantly harassed with persecutions and
exposed to dangers, this would be more particularly applicable to Paul,
and those like him, who were openly assailed by the fury of the wicked.
And thus the expression, for Jesus’ sake, will be equivalent to *for the
testimony of Christ.* (<span id="x.ii-p41.1"></span>[Re
1:9](../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#009)<span id="x.ii-p41.1"></span>..md) As,
however, the expression *to be daily delivered unto death,* means
otherwise — to have death constantly before our eyes, and to live in
such a manner, that our life is rather a shadow of death,  <span
id="fr_475"></span>[476](#fn_475.md) I have no objection, that this
passage, also, should be expounded in such a way as to be applicable to
all believers, and that, too, to every one in his order. Paul himself,
in <span id="x.ii-p42.3"></span>[Ro
8:36](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#036.md)<span id="x.ii-p42.3"></span>,
explains in this manner <span id="x.ii-p42.4"></span>[Ps
44:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022.md)<span id="x.ii-p42.4"></span>. In
this way *for Christ’s sake* would mean — because this condition is
imposed upon all his members. Erasmus, however, has rendered it, with
not. so much propriety, *we who live.* The rendering that I have given
is more suitable — *while we live.* For Paul means that, so long as we
are in the world, we resemble the dead rather than the living.

<span id="x.ii-p43"></span><span id="x.ii-p43.1"></span>

<span id="x.ii-p44"></span>**12.** *Hence death indeed.* This is said
ironically, because it was unseemly that the Corinthians should live
happily, and in accordance with their desire, and that they should, free
from anxiety, take their ease, while in the mean time Paul was
struggling with incessant hardships.  <span
id="fr_476"></span>[477](#fn_476.md) Such an allotment would certainly have
been exceedingly unreasonable. It was also necessary that the folly of
the Corinthians should be reproved, inasmuch as they contrived to
themselves a Christianity without the cross, and, not content with this,
held in contempt the servants of Christ, because they were not so
effeminate.  <span id="fr_477"></span>[478](#fn_477.md) Now as *death*
denotes all afflictions, or a life full of vexations, so also *life*
denotes a condition that is prosperous and agreeable; agreeably to the
maxim: “Life is — not *to live,* but *to be well.*”  <span
id="fr_478"></span>[479](#fn_478.md)

<span id="x.iii-p16"></span><span id="x.iii-p16.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p17"></span>**13.** *Having the same spirit.* This is a
correction of the foregoing irony. He had represented the condition of
the Corinthians as widely different from his own, (not according to his
own judgment, but according to *their* erroneous view,) inasmuch as they
were desirous of a gospel that was pleasant and free from all
molestation of the cross, and entertained less honorable views of him,
because his condition was less renowned. Now, however, he associates
himself with them in the hope of the same blessedness. “Though God
spares you, and deals with you more indulgently, while he treats me with
somewhat more severity, this diversity, nevertheless, will be no
hinderance in the way of the like glorious resurrection awaiting both of
us. For where there is oneness of faith, there will, also, *there* be
one inheritance.” It has been thought, that the Apostle speaks here of
the holy fathers, who lived under the Old Testament, and represents them
as partakers with us, in the same faith. This, indeed, is true, but it
does not accord with the subject in hand. For it is not Abraham, or the
rest of the fathers, that he associates with himself in a fellowship of
faith, but rather the Corinthians, whereas they separated themselves
from him by a perverse ambition. “However my condition,” says he, “may
appear to be the worse for the present, we shall, nevertheless, one day
be alike participants in the same glory, for we are connected together
by one faith.” Whoever will examine the connection attentively, will
perceive, that this is the true and proper interpretation. By metonymy,
he gives the name of the *spirit of faith*  <span
id="fr_480"></span>[481](#fn_480.md) to faith itself, because it is a gift
of the Holy Spirit.

<span id="x.iii-p19"></span>*As it is written* What has given occasion
for the mistake  <span id="fr_481"></span>[482](#fn_481.md) is, that he
quotes the testimony of David. It ought, however, to be taken in
connection with the confession — not with the oneness of faith, or if
you prefer it, it agrees with what follows — not with what goes before,
in this way: “Because we have an assured hope of a blessed resurrection,
we are bold to speak and preach what we believe, as it is written*, I
believed, therefore have I spoken* ” Now, this is the commencement of
<span id="x.iii-p20.2"></span>[Ps
116](../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#000.md)<span id="x.iii-p20.2"></span>,
 <span id="fr_482"></span>[483](#fn_482.md) where David acknowledges, that,
when he had been reduced to the last extremity, he was so overpowered
that he almost gave way, but, having soon afterwards regained
confidence, he had overcome that temptation. Accordingly, he opens the
Psalm thus: *I believed, therefore will I speak.* For faith is the
mother  <span id="fr_483"></span>[484](#fn_483.md) of confession. Paul, it
is true, stirring himself up to imitate him,  <span
id="fr_484"></span>[485](#fn_484.md) exhorts the Corinthians to do the
same, and, in accordance with the common Greek translation, has used the
preterite instead of the future, but this is of no consequence  <span
id="fr_485"></span>[486](#fn_485.md) For he simply means to say, that
believers ought to be magnanimous, and undaunted, in

<span id="x.iii-p25"></span>confessing  <span
id="fr_486"></span>[487](#fn_486.md) what they have believed with their
heart.  
(<span id="x.iii-p26.3"></span>[Rom.

[10](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#010)<span id="x.iii-p26.3"></span>..md)

<span id="x.iii-p27"></span>Let now our pretended followers of Nicodemus
 <span id="fr_487"></span>[488](#fn_487.md) mark, what sort of fiction they
contrive for themselves in the place of faith, when they would have
faith remain inwardly buried, and altogether silent, and glory in this
wisdom — that they utter, during their whole life, not a single word of
right confession.

<span id="x.iii-p29"></span><span id="x.iii-p29.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p30"></span>**15.** *For all things are for your sakes*
He now associates himself with the Corinthians, not merely in the hope
of future blessedness, but also in these very afflictions, in which they
might seem to differ from him most widely, for he lets them know, that,
if he is afflicted, it is for their benefit. Hence it follows, that
there was good reason why they should transfer part of them to
themselves. What Paul states, depends *first* of all on that secret
fellowship, which the members of Christ have with one another, but
*chiefly* on that mutual connection and relationship, which required
more especially to be manifested among them. Now this admonition was
fraught with great utility to the Corinthians, and brought with it
choice consolation. For what consolation there is in this — that while
God, sparing our weakness, deals with us more gently, those that are
endowed with more distinguished excellence, are afflicted for the common
advantage of all! They were also admonished, that, since they could not
aid Paul otherwise, they should, at least, help him by their prayers and
sympathy.

<span id="x.iii-p31"></span>*That the grace which hath abounded.* That
agreement  <span id="fr_488"></span>[489](#fn_488.md) between the members
of Christ he now commends on the ground of the fruit that springs from
it — its tendency to advance the glory of God. By a metonymy, according
to his usual manner, he means, by the term *grace,* that blessing of
deliverance, of which he had made mention previously — that,

<span id="x.iii-p33"></span>while he was weighed down, he was,
nevertheless, not in anxiety: while oppressed with poverty, he was not
left destitute, etc.,  
(<span id="x.iii-p33.2"></span>[2 Cor.
4:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#008.md),
[9](../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#009)<span id="x.iii-p33.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="x.iii-p34"></span>and in fine, that he had a deliverance
continually afforded him from every kind of evil  <span
id="fr_489"></span>[490](#fn_489.md) *This grace,* he says, *overflows.* By
this he means, that it was not confined to himself personally, so that
he alone enjoys it, but it extends itself farther — namely, to the
Corinthians, to whom it was of great advantage. When he makes the
overflowing of God’s gift consist in gratitude, tending to the glory of
its Author, he admonishes us, that every blessing that God confers upon
us perishes through our carelessness, if we are not prompt and active in
rendering thanks.

<span id="x.iii-p36"></span><span id="x.iii-p36.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p37"></span>**16.** *For which cause we faint not*
 <span id="fr_490"></span>[491](#fn_490.md) He now, as having carried his
point, rises to a higher confidence than before. “There is no cause,”
says he, *“*why we should lose heart, or sink down under the burden of
the cross, the issue of which is not merely so desirable to myself, but
is also salutary to others.” Thus he exhorts the Corinthians to
fortitude by his own example, should they happen at any time to be
similarly afflicted. Farther, he beats down that insolence, in which
they in no ordinary degree erred, inasmuch as under the influence of
ambition, they held a man in higher estimation, the farther he was from
the cross of Christ.

<span id="x.iii-p39"></span>*Though our outward man.* The *outward man,*
some improperly and ignorantly confound with the *old man,* for widely
different from this is the *old man,* of which we have spoken in <span
id="x.iii-p39.2"></span>[Romans
4:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#006.md)<span id="x.iii-p39.2"></span>.
Chrysostom, too, and others restrict it entirely to the body; but it is
a mistake, for the Apostle intended to comprehend, under this term,
everything that relates to the present life. As he here sets before us
*two men,* so you must place before your view *two kinds of life* — *the
earthly* and the *heavenly.* The *outward man* is the maintenance of the
*earthly* life, which consists not merely in the *flower of one’s age,*
(<span id="x.iii-p39.3"></span>[1Co
7:36](../../../bib/kjv/co1007.htm#036)<span id="x.iii-p39.3"></span>,.md)
and in good health, but also in riches, honors, friendships, and other
resources.  <span id="fr_491"></span>[492](#fn_491.md) Hence, according as
we suffer a diminution or loss of these blessings, which are requisite
for keeping up the condition of the present life, is our *outward man*
in that proportion corrupted. For as we are too much taken up with the
present life, so long as everything goes on to our mind, the Lord, on
that account, by taking away from us, by little and little, the things
that we are engrossed with, calls us back to meditate on a better life.
Thus, therefore, it is necessary, that the condition of the present life
should decay,  <span id="fr_492"></span>[493](#fn_492.md) in order that the
*inward man* may be in a flourishing state; because, in proportion as
the *earthly* life declines, does the *heavenly* life advance, at least
in believers. For in the reprobate, too, the *outward man* decays,
 <span id="fr_493"></span>[494](#fn_493.md) but without anything to
compensate for it. In the sons of God, on the other hand, a decay of
this nature is the beginning, and, as it were, the cause of production.
He says that this takes place *daily,* because God continually stirs us
up to such meditation. Would that this were deeply seated in our minds,
that we might uninterruptedly make progress amidst the decay of the
*outward man!*

<span id="x.iii-p43"></span><span id="x.iii-p43.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p44"></span>**17.** *Momentary lightness.* As our flesh
always shrinks back from its own destruction, whatever reward may be
presented to our view, and as we are influenced much more by present
feeling than by the hope of heavenly blessings, Paul on that account
admonishes us, that the afflictions and vexations of the pious have
little or nothing of bitterness, if compared with the boundless
blessings of everlasting glory. He had said, that the decay of the
*outward man* ought to occasion us no grief, inasmuch as the renovation
of the *inward man* springs out of it. As, however, the *decay* is
visible, and the *renovation* is invisible, Paul, with the view of
shaking us off from a carnal attachment to the present life, draws a
comparison between present miseries and future felicity. Now this
comparison is of itself abundantly sufficient for imbuing the minds of
the pious with patience and moderation, that they may not give way,
borne down by the burden of the cross. For whence comes it, that
patience is so difficult a matter but from this, — that we are
confounded on having experience of evils for a brief period,  <span
id="fr_494"></span>[495](#fn_494.md) and do not raise our thoughts higher?
Paul, therefore, prescribes the best antidote against your sinking down
under the pressure of afflictions, when he places in opposition to them
that future blessedness which is *laid up for thee in heaven.* (<span
id="x.iii-p45.2"></span>[Col 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#005.md)<span
id="x.iii-p45.2"></span>.) For this comparison makes that *light* which
previously seemed *heavy,* and makes that *brief* and *momentary* which
seemed of boundless duration.

<span id="x.iii-p46"></span>There is some degree of obscurity in Paul’s
words, for as he says, *With hyperbole unto hyperbole,*  <span
id="fr_495"></span>[496](#fn_495.md) so the Old Interpreter, and Erasmus
 <span id="fr_496"></span>[497](#fn_496.md) have thought that in both terms
the magnitude of the heavenly glory, that awaits believers is extolled;
or, at least, they have connected them with the verb *worketh out.* To
this I have no objection, but as the distinction that I have made is
also not unsuitable, I leave it to my readers to make their choice.

<span id="x.iii-p49"></span>*Worketh out an eternal weight* Paul does
not mean, that this is the invariable effect of afflictions; for the
great majority are most miserably weighed down here with evils of every
kind, and yet that very circumstance is an occasion of their heavier
destruction, rather than a help to their salvation. As, however, he is
speaking of believers, we must restrict exclusively to them what is here
stated; for this is a blessing from God that is peculiar to them — that
they are prepared for a blessed resurrection by the common miseries of
mankind.

<span id="x.iii-p50"></span>As to the circumstance, however, that
Papists abuse this passage, to prove that afflictions are the causes of
our salvation, it is exceedingly silly;  <span
id="fr_497"></span>[498](#fn_497.md) unless, perhaps, you choose to take
*causes* in the sense of *means,* (as they commonly speak.) We, at
least, cheerfully acknowledge, that

<span id="x.iii-p52"></span>we must through many tribulations  <span
id="fr_498"></span>[499](#fn_498.md)  
enter into the kingdom of heaven, (<span id="x.iii-p53.5"></span>[Ac
14:22](../../../bib/kjv/act014.htm#022)<span id="x.iii-p53.5"></span>,.md)

<span id="x.iii-p54"></span>and as to this there is no controversy.
While, however, our doctrine is, that the momentary lightness of
afflictions worketh out in us an *eternal weight*  <span
id="fr_499"></span>[500](#fn_499.md) *of life,* for this reason, that all
the sons of God are

<span id="x.iii-p56"></span>predestinated to be conformed to Christ,
(<span id="x.iii-p56.1"></span>[Ro
8:29](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029)<span id="x.iii-p56.1"></span>,.md)

<span id="x.iii-p57"></span>in the endurance of the cross, and in this
manner are prepared for the enjoyment of the heavenly inheritance, which
they have through means of God’s gracious adoption; Papists, on the
other hand, imagine that they are meritorious works,  <span
id="fr_500"></span>[501](#fn_500.md) by which the heavenly kingdom is
acquired.

<span id="x.iii-p59"></span>I shall repeat it again in a few words. We
do not deny that afflictions are the path by which the heavenly kingdom
is arrived at, but we deny that by afflictions we merit the inheritance,
 <span id="fr_501"></span>[502](#fn_501.md) which comes to us in no other
way than through means of God’s gracious adoption. Papists, without
consideration, seize hold of one little word, with the view of building
upon it a tower of Babel, (<span id="x.iii-p60.2"></span>[Ge
11:9](../../../bib/kjv/gen011.htm#009)<span id="x.iii-p60.2"></span>,.md) —
that the kingdom of God is not an inheritance procured for us by Christ,
but a reward that is due to our works. For a fuller solution, however,
of this question, consult my Institutes.  <span
id="fr_502"></span>[503](#fn_502.md)

<span id="x.iii-p62"></span><span id="x.iii-p62.1"></span>

<span id="x.iii-p63"></span>*While we look not.* Mark what it is, that
will make all the miseries of this world easy to be endured, — if we
carry forward our thoughts to the eternity of the heavenly kingdom. For
a moment is long, if we look around us on this side and on that; but,
when we have once raised our minds heavenward, a thousand years begin to
appear to us to be like a moment. Farther, the Apostle’s words intimate,
that we are imposed upon by the view of present things, because there is
nothing there that is not *temporal;* and that, consequently, there is
nothing for us to rest upon but confidence in a future life. Observe the
expression, *looking at the things which are unseen,*  <span
id="fr_503"></span>[504](#fn_503.md) for the eye of faith penetrates beyond
all our natural senses, and faith is also on that account represented as
a *looking at things that are invisible.* (<span
id="x.iii-p64.2"></span>[Heb 11:1](../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#001.md)<span
id="x.iii-p64.2"></span>.)

<span id="x.i-p29"></span> The verb <span id="x.i-p29.1"></span>δολοῦν
is applied by *Lucian* (in Hermot. 59) to vintners adulterating wine, in
which sense it is synonymous with <span
id="x.i-p29.2"></span>καπηλέυειν, made use of by Paul in <span

id="x.i-p29.3"></span>. Beza’s rendering of the clause exactly
corresponds with the one to which Calvin gives the preference — “<span
id="x.i-p29.4"></span>Neque falsantes sermonem Dei;” — “Nor falsifying
the word of God.” Tyndale (1534) renders the clause thus — “Nether
corrupte we the worde of God.” The rendering in the Rheims version
(1582) is — “Nor adulterating the word of God.” — *Ed.*

<span id="x.i-p42"></span> The Manicheans, so called from Manes their

<span id="x.i-p44"></span> “<span id="x.i-p44.1"></span>Les dieux des
Gentils sont diables;” — “The gods of the Gentiles are devils.” Calvin
here, as in many other instances, quotes according to the *sense*, not
according to the *words*. The passage referred to is rendered by Calvin
— “All the gods of the nations are vanities,” (“<span
id="x.i-p44.2"></span>ou, idoles,” “or idols,”) the Hebrew word being,
as he notices, <span id="x.i-p44.3"></span>אלילים, (*elilim*,) mere
nothings, (<span id="x.i-p44.4"></span>[1Co
8:4](../../../bib/kjv/co1008.htm#004)<span id="x.i-p44.4"></span>,.md)
instead of <span id="x.i-p44.5"></span>אלהים, (*elohim*,) gods. (See
Calvin on the Psalms, vol. 4, pp. 50, 51.) There can be no doubt that
Calvin, in quoting this passage here, has an eye to what is stated by
Paul in <span id="x.i-p44.7"></span>[1Co
10:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#020.md)<span id="x.i-p44.7"></span>. —

<span id="x.i-p45"></span> Calvin, when commenting on the passage
referred to, remarks, that “the devil is called the prince of this
world, not because he has a kingdom separated from God, (as the
Manicheans imagined,) but because, by God’s permission, he exercises his
tyranny over the world.” — Calvin on John, volume 2. — *Ed*.

id="x.i-p47.2"></span>

<span id="x.i-p48"></span> Calvin obviously means by this clause —
without anything being added having a tendency to qualify or limit the
appellation. In accordance with this he says in the Institutes, (volume
1,) that the “title,” God, “is not conferred on any man without some
addition, as when it is said that Moses would be a god to Pharaoh.”

that a world inhabited by reasonable creatures, God’s own offspring, is
universally fallen into a confederacy and combination with another god,
with an enemy — god, an adversary — god, against the living and true
God! Men have changed their God. And what a fearful choice have they
made! Fallen into a league with those wicked creatures that were weary
of his government before, and that were, thereupon, thrown down into an
abyss of darkness, and bound up in the chains thereof, unto the judgment
of the great day. But doth the Scripture say this in vain? or hath it
not a meaning when it calls the devil *the god of this world*? O with
what amazement should it strike our hearts, to think that so it is, that
the whole order of creatures is gone off from God, and fallen into a

<span id="x.i-p61"></span> Calvin manifestly refers to an expression
made use of by the Council of Nice, A.D. 325, to express unity of
essence in the first and second persons of the Trinity, the Son having
been declared to be <span id="x.i-p61.1"></span>ὁμοούσις τῷ Πατρὶ —
*co-essential with the Father*. “It had been used in the same sense by
some writers before the meeting of the Council. It is remarkable,
however, that it had been rejected by the Council of Antioch, A.D. 263,
on account of the inference which Paul of Samosata pretended to draw
from it, namely, that if Christ and the Spirit were consubstantial with
the Father, it followed that there were three substances — one prior and
two posterior — derived from it. To guard against this inference, the
Council declared that the Son was not <span
id="x.i-p61.2"></span>ὁμοούσιος τῷ Πατρὶ (*consubstantial with the
Father*.) “Paul” (*of Samosata*) “seems to have explained the term as
signifying *specific*, or *of the same species*; and it is certain that
this sense had sometimes been given to it. Thus Aristotle calls the
stars <span id="x.i-p61.3"></span>ὁμοούσια meaning that they were all of
the same nature. But in the creed of Nice it is expressive of unity of
essence, and was adopted, after considerable discussion, as proper to be
opposed to the Arians, who affirmed that the essence of the Son was
different and separate from the Father.” — *Dick’s Theology*, volume 2.
The reader will also find the same expression largely treated of by
Calvin in the *Institutes*, volume 1 — 1. See also Institutes, volume 2,

extremity by all the troubles that surround us, but we can breathe well
enough for all that.’ Probably there are meant by this thing desired,
two degrees or steps of inward trouble... Either it is a trouble that

<span id="x.ii-p31"></span> “<span
id="x.ii-p31.1"></span>*Mortificationem*.” — Such is Calvin’s rendering
of the original term <span id="x.ii-p31.2"></span>νέκρωσιν, and it is
evidently employed to convey the idea of *putting to death*, the main
idea intended to be expressed being, as our author shows, that the
apostles were, for the sake of Christ, subjected to humiliating and
painful sufferings, which gave them, in a manner, an outward conformity
to their Divine Master in the *violent death* inflicted upon him. The
term mortification, when taken in strict accordance with its etymology,
in the sense of putting to death, appears to bring out more fully the
apostle’s meaning, than the word “dying,” made use of in our authorized
version. Beza, who gives the same rendering as Calvin, subjoins the
following valuable observations: — “*Mortificationem* <span
id="x.ii-p31.3"></span>τὴν νέκρωσιν — <span id="x.ii-p31.4"></span>Sic
vocat Paulus miseram illam conditionem fidelium, ac pr’sertim
ministrorum (de his enim proprie agitur) qui *quotidie* (ut ait David)
*occiduntur*, quasi *destinationem ad coedem* dicas: additurque *Domini
Iesu*, vel, (ut legit vetus interpres) *Iesu Christi*, tum ut declaretur
causa propter quam mundus illos ita persequitur; tum etiam quia hac
quoque in parte Christo capiti sunt conformes, Christusque adeo ipse
quodammodo in iis morte afficitur. Ambrosius maluit *mortem*
interpretari, nempe quia in altero membro sit mentio *vitoe* Christi. At
ego, si libuisset a Pauli verbis discedere, *coedem* potius exposuissem:
quia non temere Paulus <span id="x.ii-p31.5"></span>ςέκρωσιν maluit
scribere quam <span id="x.ii-p31.6"></span>θάνατον, quoniam etiam
Christus hic considerandus nobis est non ut simpliciter mortuus, sed ut
interemptus. Verum ut modo dixi <span id="x.ii-p31.7"></span>νέκρωσις
nec *mortem* nec *coedem* hic significat, sed conditionem illam
*quotidianis mortibus* obnoxiam, qualis etiam fuit Christi ad tempus;” —
“*Mortification* <span id="x.ii-p31.8"></span>τὴν νέκρωσιν This term
Paul makes use of to denote that miserable condition of believers, and
more especially of ministers, (for it is of them properly that he
speaks,) who are, as David says, *killed every day* — as though you
should say a *setting apart for slaughter*; and it is added — *of the
Lord Jesus*, or (as the old interpreter renders it) *of Jesus Christ*,
partly with the view of explaining the reason why the world thus
persecutes them, and partly because in this respect also they are
conformed to Christ, the Head, and even Christ himself is, in them, in a
manner put to death. Ambrose has preferred to render it *death*, for
this reason, that in the other clause mention is made of the *life* of
Christ. For my own part, however, were I to depart from Paul’s words, I
would rather render it *slaughter*, inasmuch as Paul did not rashly make
use of <span id="x.ii-p31.9"></span>νέκρωσιν rather than <span
id="x.ii-p31.10"></span>θάνατον, since Christ also is to be viewed by us
here, not simply as having died, but as *having been put to death*. But,
as I said a little ago, <span id="x.ii-p31.11"></span>νέκρωσις here does
not mean *death* nor *slaughter*, but a condition which exposed *every
day* *to deaths*, such as Christ’s, also, was for a time.” — *Ed.*

Calvin who condemned so pernicious a sentiment was considered by them as
carrying his severity to an extreme, he showed clearly that his opinion
was in unison, not only with those of the fathers of the Church, but
also with the doctrine of the most learned theologians of the age, such
as Melancthon, Bucer, and Martyr, as well as the ministers of Zurich;

<span id="x.iii-p64"></span> “The word which is here rendered *look*
signifies *to take aim at*, (<span id="x.iii-p64.1"></span>σκοποῦντων
ἡμῶν) This is a very steady intuition, which a man hath of the mark
which he is aiming at, or the end which he designs; he must always have
it in his eye. And by this looking, saith the Apostle, we find that,
notwithstanding all the decays of the *outward man, the inward man* *is
reviewed day by* *day* — life, and vigor, and spirit continually
entering in at our eyes from that glorious aim which we have before us.
This will need a very steady determination of mind unto such objects by
a commanding light and glory that they carry with them, so that the soul
feels not a disposition in itself to direct or look off.” — *Howe’s
Works*, (Lond. 1834,) p. 543. — *Ed.*
