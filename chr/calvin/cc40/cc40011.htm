<p><a name="xii.i-p27"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Assisting.</i> He has repeated the instructions of embassy with which the ministers of the gospel have been furnished by God. After they have faithfully communicated these instructions, they must also use their endeavor, that they may be carried into effect, 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_571"></A><A HREF="#fn_571"><FONT SIZE="1">572</FONT></A>
 			  in order that their labor may not be in vain. They must, I say, add continual exhortation&#8217;s,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_572"></A><A HREF="#fn_572"><FONT SIZE="1">573</FONT></A>
 			  that their embassy may be efficacious. This is what he means by <a name="xii.i-p29.2"></A>&#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;, (<i>fellow-workers,</i>) that is, devoted to the advancement of the work; for it is not enough to <i>teach, </i>if you do not also <i>urge</i>. In this way, the particle <a name="xii.i-p29.3"></A>&#963;&#8059;&#957; would have a relation to God, or to the embassy, which he assigns to his servants. For the doctrine of the gospel is helped by exhortations, so as not to be without effect, and ministers connect their endeavors with God&#8217;s commission;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_573"></A><A HREF="#fn_573"><FONT SIZE="1">574</FONT></A>
 			  as it is the part of an ambassador to enforce by arguments, what he brings forward in the name of his prince.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p31"></A>The particle <a name="xii.i-p31.1"></A>&#963;&#8059;&#957; may also be taken as referring to the endeavors of ministers in common; for if they do the Lord&#8217;s work in good earnest, they must mutually lend a helping hand to each other, so as to give assistance to each other. I rather prefer, however, the former exposition. Chrysostom interprets it as referring to the hearers, 			 with whom ministers are <i>fellow-workers, </i>when they rouse them up from slothfulness and indolence.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p32"></A>Ministers are here taught, that it is not enough simply to advance doctrine. They must also labor that it may be received by the hearers, and that not once merely, but continually. For as they are messengers between God and men, the <i>first </i>duty devolving upon them is, to make offer <i>of the grace of God,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_574"></A><A HREF="#fn_574"><FONT SIZE="1">575</FONT></A>
 			  and the <i>second </i>is, to strive with all their might, that it may not be offered in vain.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xii.i-p34"></A><a name="xii.i-p34.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p35"></A><b>2.</b> <i>For he saith, In an acceptable time.</i> He quotes a prediction of Isaiah, exceedingly appropriate to the exhortation of which he speaks. It is without doubt of the kingdom of Christ that he there speaks,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_575"></A><A HREF="#fn_575"><FONT SIZE="1">576</FONT></A>
 			  as is manifest from the context. The Father, then, appointing his Son a leader, for the purpose of gathering together a Church, addresses him in these words:</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xii.i-p37"></A>&#8220;I have heard thee in an acceptable time.&#8221; (<a name="xii.i-p37.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#008">Isa 49:8</a><a name="xii.i-p37.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p38"></A>We know, however, what a degree of correspondence   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_576"></A><A HREF="#fn_576"><FONT SIZE="1">577</FONT></A>
 			  there is between the Head and the members. For Christ was heard in our name, as the salvation of all of us is entrusted into his hand, and nothing else has he taken under his charge. Hence we are all admonished in the person of Christ &#8212; not to slight the opportunity that is afforded for obtaining salvation. While the rendering of the Greek interpreter is, <a name="xii.i-p39.2"></A>&#949;&#8016;&#960;&#961;&#8057;&#963;&#948;&#949;&#954;&#964;&#959;&#957;,<i> 			 </i>(<i>acceptable,</i>)   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_577"><FONT SIZE="1">578</FONT></A>
 			  the word made use of by the Prophet is, <a name="xii.i-p40.3"></A>&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503;, (<i>ratson,</i>) that is, benevolence, or free favour.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_578"></A><A HREF="#fn_578"><FONT SIZE="1">579</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p42"></A>The quotation must be applied to the subject in hand in this way: &#8220;As God specifies a particular time for the exhibition of his grace, it follows that all times are not suitable for that. As a particular <i>day of salvation</i> is named, it follows that a free offer of salvation is not made every day.&#8221; Now this altogether depends on the providence of God, 			 for the<i> acceptable time</i> is no other than what is called in <a name="xii.i-p42.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004">Ga 4:4</a><a name="xii.i-p42.1"></A>, <i>the fullness of the time</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_579"></A><A HREF="#fn_579"><FONT SIZE="1">580</FONT></A>
 			  The order of arrangement also must be observed. First, he makes mention of a <i>time of benevolence, </i>and then afterwards of a <i>day of salvation</i> By this it is intimated, that salvation flows to us from the mercy of God exclusively, as from a fountainhead. Hence we must not seek the cause in ourselves, as if we by means 			 of our own works moved God to assign to us his favor, for whence comes the <i>day of salvation? </i>It is because it is the <i>acceptable time, </i>that is, the time which God has in his free favor appointed. In the mean time, we must keep in view what Paul designs to teach &#8212; that there is need of prompt expedition, that we may not allow the opportunity to pass unimproved, inasmuch as it displeases God, that 			 the grace that he offers to us should be received by us with coolness and indifference.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p44"></A><i>Behold now is the time</i> The Prophet had spoken of the time, when Christ was to be manifested in the flesh for the redemption of men. Paul transfers the prophecy to the time when Christ is revealed by the continued preaching of the gospel, and it is with good reason that he does so, for as <i>salvation</i> was once sent to the whole world, when Christ appeared, 			 so now it is sent to us every day, when we are made partakers of the gospel. Here we have a beautiful passage, and affording no ordinary consolation, because, while the gospel is preached to us, we know assuredly that the way is opened up for us into the kingdom of God, and that there is a signal of divine benevolence raised aloft, to invite us to receive <i>salvation, </i>for the opportunity of obtaining it must be judged of by the call. Unless, however, we embrace 			 the opportunity, we must fear the threatening that Paul brings forward &#8212; that, in a short time, the door will be shut against all that have not entered in, while opportunity was afforded. For this retribution always follows contempt of the word.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xii.i-p45"></A><a name="xii.i-p45.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p46"></A><b>3.</b> <i>Giving no offense</i> We have already on several occasions remarked, that Paul sometimes commends the ministry of the gospel generally, and at other times his own integrity.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_580"></A><A HREF="#fn_580"><FONT SIZE="1">581</FONT></A>
 			  In the present instance, then, he speaks of himself, and sets before us in his own person a living picture of a good and faithful apostle, that the Corinthians may be led to see how unfair they were in their judgment, in preferring before him empty blusterers.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_581"></A><A HREF="#fn_581"><FONT SIZE="1">582</FONT></A>
 			  For as they assigned the praise to mere pretences,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_582"></A><A HREF="#fn_582"><FONT SIZE="1">583</FONT></A>
 			  they held in the highest esteem persons that were effeminate and devoid of zeal, while, on the other hand, as to the best ministers, they cherished no views but such as were mean and abject. Nor is there any reason to doubt, that those very things that Paul makes mention of to his own commendation, had been brought forward by them in part as a ground of contempt; and they were so much the more deserving of reproof, inasmuch as they converted into matter of reproach, 			 what was ground of just praise.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p50"></A>Paul, therefore, treats here of <i>three </i>things: In the <i>first </i>place, he shows what are the excellences, on the ground of which preachers of the gospel ought to be esteemed; <i>secondly, </i>he shows that he is himself endowed with those excellences; <i>thirdly, </i>he admonishes the Corinthians not to acknowledge as Christ&#8217;s servants those who conduct themselves otherwise than he prescribes here by his example. His design is, that 			 he may procure authority for himself and those that were like him, with a view to the glory of God and the good of the Church, or may restore it where it has fallen into decay; and <i>secondly, </i>that he may call back the Corinthians from an unreasonable attachment to the false apostles, which was a hinderance in the way of their making so much proficiency in the gospel as was necessary. Ministers give occasion of stumbling, when by their own misconduct they hinder the progress of the gospel 			 on the part of their hearers. <i>That </i>Paul says he does not do; for he declares that he carefully takes heed not to stain his apostleship by any spot of disgrace.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p51"></A>For this is the artifice of Satan &#8212; to seek some misconduct on the part of ministers, that may tend to the dishonor of the gospel. For when he has been successful in bringing the ministry into contempt, all hope of profit is at an end. Hence the man who would usefully serve Christ, must strive with his whole might to maintain the credit of his ministry. The method is &#8212; to take care that he be deserving of honor, for nothing is more ridiculous 			 than striving to maintain your reputation before others, while you call forth upon yourself reproach by a wicked and base life. That man, therefore, will alone be honorable, who will allow himself in nothing that is unworthy of a minister of Christ.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xii.i-p52"></A><a name="xii.i-p52.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p53"></A><b>4. </b><i>In much patience.</i> The whole of the enumeration that follows is intended to show, that all the tests by which the Lord is accustomed to try his servants were to be found in Paul, and that there was no kind of test to which he had not been subjected, in order that the faithfulness of his ministry might be more fully established.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_583"></A><A HREF="#fn_583"><FONT SIZE="1">584</FONT></A>
 			  Among other things that he enumerates, there are some that are under all circumstances required for all the servants of Christ. Of this nature are <i>labors, sincerity, knowledge, watchings, gentleness, love, the word of truth, the Spirit, the power of God, the armor of righteousness. </i>There are other things that are not necessary in all cases; for in order that any one may be a servant of Christ, it is not absolutely 			 necessary, that he be put to the test by means of <i>stripes</i> and <i>imprisonments</i> Hence these things will in some cases be wanting in the experience of the best. It becomes all, however, to be of such a disposition as to present themselves to be tried, as Paul was, with <i>stripes</i> and <i>imprisonments, </i>if the Lord shall see meet.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p55"></A><i>Patience</i> is the regulation of the mind in adversity, which is an excellence that ought invariably to distinguish a good minister.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_584"></A><A HREF="#fn_584"><FONT SIZE="1">585</FONT></A>
 			  <i>Afflictions</i> include more than <i>necessities;</i> for by the term <i>necessity</i> here I understand <i>poverty. </i>Now this is common to many ministers, there being few of them 			 that are not in poor circumstances; but at the same time not to all. For why should a moderate amount of riches prevent a man from being reckoned a servant of Christ, who, in other respects, is pious, is of upright mind and honorable deportment, and is distinguished by other excellences. As the man that is poor is not on that account to be straightway accounted a good minister, so the man that is rich is not on that account to be rejected. Nay more, Paul in another passage glories not less in 			 his <i>knowing how to abound, </i>than in <i>knowing how to be in want. </i>(<a name="xii.i-p56.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi004.htm#012">Php 4:12</a><a name="xii.i-p56.4"></A>.) Hence we must observe the distinction that I have mentioned, between <i>occasional </i>and <i>invariable </i>grounds 			 of commendation.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_585"></A><A HREF="#fn_585"><FONT SIZE="1">586</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xii.i-p58"></A><a name="xii.i-p58.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p59"></A><b>5.</b> <i>In tumults</i> In proportion to the calmness and gentleness of Paul&#8217;s disposition was there the greater excellence displayed in his standing undaunted in the face of <i>tumults; </i>and he takes praise to himself on this account &#8212; that while he 			 regarded tumults with abhorrence, he nevertheless encountered them with bravery.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_586"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">587</FONT></A>
 			  Nor does the praise simply consist in his being unmoved by <i>tumults,</i> (this being commonly found among all riotous persons,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_587"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">588</FONT></A>
 			 ) but in his being thrown into no alarm by tumults that had been stirred up through the fault of others. And, unquestionably, two things are required on the part of ministers of the Gospel &#8212; that they should endeavor to the utmost of their power to maintain peace, and yet on the other hand go forward, undaunted, through the midst of commotions, so as not to turn aside from the right course, though heaven and earth should be mingled.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_588"></A><A HREF="#fn_588"><FONT SIZE="1">589</FONT></A>
 			  Chrysostom, however, prefers to understand <a name="xii.i-p62.1"></A>&#7936;&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#8055;&#945;&#953;&#962; to mean &#8212; frequent expulsions,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">590</FONT></A>
 			  inasmuch as there afforded him a place of rest.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_590"></A><A HREF="#fn_590"><FONT SIZE="1">591</FONT></A>
 			  <i>In fastings</i> He does not mean &#8212; hunger arising from destitution, but a voluntary exercise of abstinence.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xii.i-p65"></A><a name="xii.i-p65.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p66"></A><i>Knowledge </i>may be taken in two senses &#8212; either as meaning doctrine itself, or skill in acting properly and <i>knowingly. </i>The latter appears to me the more likely, as he immediately adds &#8212; <i>the word of truth</i> The <i>Spirit </i>is taken 			 by <i>metonymy, </i>to denote spiritual graces. Frivolous, however, is the cavil of Chrysostom, who infers from this, that the other excellences are peculiar to the Apostle, because he makes mention of the <i>Spirit </i>separately, as if <i>kindness, knowledge, pureness, armor of righteousness, </i>were from any other source, than from the Holy Spirit. He makes 			 mention, however, of the Spirit separately, as a general term in the midst of particular instances.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">592</FONT></A>
 			  The <i>power of God</i> showed itself in many things &#8212; in magnanimity, in efficacy in the maintaining of the truth, in the propagation of the Gospel, in victory over enemies, and the like.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xii.i-p68"></A><a name="xii.i-p68.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p69"></A><b>7. </b><i>By the armor of righteousness</i> By<i> righteousness</i> you must understand &#8212; rectitude of conscience, and holiness of life. He employs the metaphor of <i>armor,</i> because all 			 that serve God require to fight, inasmuch as the devil is always on the alert, to molest them. Now they must be completely armed, because, if he does not succeed in one onset, he thereupon makes a new attempt, and attacks them at one time from before, at another from behind &#8212; now on this side, and then on that.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">593</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xii.i-p71"></A><a name="xii.i-p71.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p72"></A><b>8.</b> <i>By honor and dishonor</i> This is no slight test for subjecting a man to trial, for to a man of a noble spirit nothing is more unpleasant, than to incur disgrace. Hence we may observe in all histories, that there have been few men of heroism that have not fallen back, on being irritated by insults.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">594</FONT></A>
 			  Hence it is indicative of a mind well established in virtue, not to be moved away from one&#8217;s course by any disgrace that may be incurred &#8212; a rare virtue, but one without which you cannot show that you are a servant of God. We must, it is true, have a regard to good character, but it must be only in so far as the edification of our brethren requires it, and in such a way as not to be dependent on reports   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_594"><FONT SIZE="1">595</FONT></A>
 			  &#8212; nay more, so as to maintain in the same even course in <i>honor </i>and in <i>dishonor. </i>For God allows us to be tried even by the slander of wicked men, with the view of trying us,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_595"></A><A HREF="#fn_595"><FONT SIZE="1">596</FONT></A>
 			  whether we act uprightly from disinterested motives;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">597</FONT></A>
 			  for if one is drawn aside from duty by the ingratitude of men, that man shows that he had not his eye directed to God alone. As then we see that Paul was exposed to infamy and insults, and yet did not on that account stop short, but held forward with undaunted courage, and broke through every impediment so as to reach the goal,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_597"></A><A HREF="#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">598</FONT></A>
 			  let us not give way, if the same thing should befall us.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.i-p78"></A><i>As deceivers</i> Here he relates, not simply in what estimation he was held by the wicked and those that were <i>without, </i>(<a name="xii.i-p78.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#012">1Co 5:12</a><a name="xii.i-p78.1"></A>,) but also what views were entertained of him by those that were 			 <i>within. </i>Now let every one consider with himself, how unseemly was the ingratitude of the Corinthians, and how great was his magnanimity in struggling forward, in spite of such formidable obstacles. By indirect representations, however, he sharply reproves their perverse judgment, when he says that he <i>lives </i>and is <i>joyful, </i>while they despised him as 			 one that was dead and overwhelmed with grief. He reproaches them, also, with ingratitude, when he says, that he <i>made many rich, </i>while he was contemned on account of his poverty.

 			  if you are inclined to connect this with what goes before, the meaning will be this, &#8212; &#8220;I have ample ground of glorying, and an upright conscience <i>opens my mouth. </i>Your entertaining unfavorable views of us, is not owing to any fault on our part, but arises from your being unfair judges.

 			  It is quite a common figure, to speak of a <i>narrow and contracted heart </i>as denoting either <i>grief, </i>or <i>disgust, </i>while, on the other hand, <i>an enlarged heart </i>is employed to denote dispositions of an opposite kind. Hence Paul here says nothing but what we every day 			 experience, for when we have to do with friends, our <i>heart is enlarged, </i>all our feelings are laid open, there is nothing there that is hid, nothing shut, &#8212; nay more, the whole mind leaps and exults to unfold itself openly to view.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_603"></A><A HREF="#fn_603"><FONT SIZE="1">604</FONT></A>

By the <i>same requital </i>he means &#8212; mutual duty, for 			 there is a mutual return of duty between a father and his sons. For as it is the duty of parents to nourish their children, to instruct them, to direct them by their counsel, and to defend them, so it is the dictate of equity, that children should <i>requite their parents. </i>(<a name="xii.ii-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004">1Ti 5:4</a><a name="xii.ii-p30.1"></A>.)

In our exposition, on the other hand, (which is Chrysostom&#8217;s, also,) there is nothing forced.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_606"></A><A HREF="#fn_606"><FONT SIZE="1">607</FONT></A>

<p><a name="xii.ii-p34"></A><b>14.</b> <i>Be not yoked</i> As if regaining his authority, he now reproves them more freely, because they associated with unbelievers, as partakers with them in outward idolatry. For he has exhorted them to show themselves docile to him as to a father: he now, in accordance with the rights that belong to him, 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_607"></A><A HREF="#fn_607"><FONT SIZE="1">608</FONT></A>
 			  reproves the fault into which they had fallen. Now we mentioned in the former epistle   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_608"></A><A HREF="#fn_608"><FONT SIZE="1">609</FONT></A>
 			  what this fault was; for, as they imagined that there was nothing that was unlawful for them in outward things, they defiled themselves with wicked superstitions without any reserve. For in frequenting the banquets of unbelievers, they participated along with them in profane and impure rites, and while they sinned grievously, they nevertheless thought themselves innocent. On this account Paul inveighs here against outward idolatry, and exhorts Christians to stand 			 aloof from it, and have no connection with it. He begins, however, with a general statement, with the view of coming down from that to a particular instance, for to be <i>yoked with unbelievers </i>means nothing less than to</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xii.ii-p37"></A>have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,<br> 			 (<a name="xii.ii-p37.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011">Eph 5:11</a><a name="xii.ii-p37.2"></A>,)</p>

 			 in token of agreement.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p40"></A>Many are of opinion that he speaks of marriage, but the context clearly shows that they are mistaken. The word that Paul makes use of means &#8212; to be connected together in drawing the same yoke. It is a metaphor taken from oxen or horses, which require to walk at the same pace, and to act together in the same work, when fastened under one yoke.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_610"></A><A HREF="#fn_610"><FONT SIZE="1">611</FONT></A>
 			 When, therefore, he prohibits us from having partnership with unbelievers in drawing the same yoke, he means simply this, that we should have no fellowship with them in their pollutions. For <i>one </i>sun shines upon us, we eat of the same bread, we breathe the same air, and we cannot altogether refrain from intercourse with them; but Paul speaks of the yoke of impiety, that is, of participation in works, in which Christians cannot lawfully have fellowship. On this principle marriage 			 will also be prohibited, inasmuch as it is a snare, by which both men and women are entangled into an agreement with impiety; but what I mean is simply this, that Paul&#8217;s doctrine is of too general a nature to be restricted to marriage exclusively, for he is discoursing here as to the shunning of idolatry, on which account, also, we are prohibited from contracting marriages with the wicked.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p42"></A><i>For what fellowship</i> He confirms his exhortation on the ground of its being an absurd, and, as it were, monstrous connecting together of things in themselves much at variance; for these things can no more coalesce than fire and water. In short it comes to this, that unless they would have everything thrown into confusion, they must refrain from the pollutions of the wicked. Hence, too, we infer, that even 			 those that do not in their hearts approve of superstitions are, nevertheless, polluted by dissimulation if they do not openly and ingenuously stand aloof from them.</p>

 			  The meaning, however, is not doubtful.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_612"></A><A HREF="#fn_612"><FONT SIZE="1">613</FONT></A>
 			  For Moses takes a word or thought of <i>Belial</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_613"></A><A HREF="#fn_613"><FONT SIZE="1">614</FONT></A>
 			  to mean a wicked and base thought,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_614"></A><A HREF="#fn_614"><FONT SIZE="1">615</FONT></A>
 			  and in various instances   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_615"></A><A HREF="#fn_615"><FONT SIZE="1">616</FONT></A>

Hence it is, that Paul has employed the word here to mean the devil, the head of all wicked persons. For from what holds good as to the two heads, he comes down without delay to the members: &#8220;As there is an irreconcilable variance between Christ and Satan, so we also must keep aloof from partnership with the wicked.&#8221; When, however, Paul 			 says that a Christian has no participation with an unbeliever, he does not mean as to food, clothing, estates, the sun, the air, as I have mentioned above, but as to those things that are peculiar to unbelievers, from which the Lord has separated us.</p>

<p><a name="xii.ii-p51"></A><b>16. </b><i>What agreement hath the temple of God with idols?</i> Hitherto he has in general terms prohibited believers from associating with the wicked. He now lets them know what was the chief reason, why he had prohibited them from such an association &#8212; because they had ceased to reckon the profession of idolatry to be a sin. He had censured that liberty, 			 and had exposed it at great length in the former Epistle. It is probable, however, that all had not yet been gained over, so as to receive the counsel which he had given. Hence it was that he complained of their being <i>straitened in their own bowels</i> &#8212; the only thing that hindered their proficiency.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_616"></A><A HREF="#fn_616"><FONT SIZE="1">617</FONT></A>
 			  He does not, however, resume that subject anew, but contents himself with a short admonition, as we are accustomed to do, when we treat of things that are well known. At the same time his brevity does not prevent his giving sharp cuts. For how much emphasis there is in that single word, where he teaches that there is no agreement between the <i>temple of God</i> and <i>idols!</i> &#8220;It is a sacrilegious profanation,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_617"></A><A HREF="#fn_617"><FONT SIZE="1">618</FONT></A>
 			  when an<i> idol</i> or any <i>idolatrous </i>service is introduced into the <i>temple of God</i> Now we are the true <i>temples of God. </i>Hence it is sacrilege to defile ourselves with any contamination of idols. This one consideration, I 			 say, should be to you as good as a thousand. If you are a Christian, <i>what have you to do with idols, </i>(<a name="xii.ii-p53.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#008">Ho 14:8</a><a name="xii.ii-p53.2"></A>,) for you are the <i>temple of God?&#8221; </i>Paul, however, as I have already in part noticed, contends rather by way of exhortation than of doctrine, inasmuch as it would have been 			 superfluous to be still treating of it, as if it were a thing doubtful or obscure.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xii.ii-p54"></A><i>As God saith, I will walk.</i> He proves that we are the <i>temples of God</i> from this, that God of old promised to the people of Israel that he would dwell in the midst of them. In the first place, God cannot dwell <i>among </i>us, without dwelling in each one of us, for he promises this as a singular privilege &#8212; <i>I will dwell in the midst of you</i> Nor does this <i>dwelling </i>or presence consist merely in earthly blessings, but must be understood chiefly of spiritual grace. Hence it does not mean simply that God is near us, as though he were in the 			 air, flying round about us, but it means rather that he has his abode in our hearts. If, then, any one objects, that the particle <i>in</i> simply means <i>among, </i>I grant it; but I affirm that, from the circumstance that God promises that he will dwell <i>among </i>us, we may infer that he also remains <i>in</i> us.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_618"></A><A HREF="#fn_618"><FONT SIZE="1">619</FONT></A>
 			  And such was the type of the ark, of which mention is made by Moses in that passage, from which Paul appears to have borrowed this quotation. (<a name="xii.ii-p55.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#012">Le 26:12</a><a name="xii.ii-p55.2"></A>.) If, however, any one thinks that Paul had rather in his eye <a name="xii.ii-p55.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze037.htm#027">Eze 37:27</a><a name="xii.ii-p55.3"></A>, the 			 argument will be the same. For the Prophet, when describing the restoration of the Church, mentions as the chief good, the presence of God, which he had himself in the beginning promised by Moses. Now what was prefigured by the ark, was manifested to us more fully in Christ, when he became to us Immanuel   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_619"></A><A HREF="#fn_619"><FONT SIZE="1">620</FONT></A>
 			  (<a name="xii.ii-p56.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#023">Mt 1:23</a><a name="xii.ii-p56.2"></A>.) On this account, I am of opinion that it is Ezekiel, rather than Moses, that is here quoted, because Ezekiel alludes at the same time to the type of the ark, and declares that it will have its fulfillment under the reign of Christ. Now the Apostle takes it for granted, that God dwells nowhere but in a sacred place. If we say of a man, 			 &#8220;he dwells here,&#8221; that will not make the place a <i>temple; </i>but as to God there is this peculiarity, that whatever place he honors with his presence, he at the same time sanctifies.</p>

For he makes use of a 			 circumlocution to describe the priests, when he says, <i>Ye that bear the vessels of the Lord, </i>inasmuch as they had the charge of the <i>vessels, </i>by means of which the sacrifices, and other parts of divine worship, were performed. There can be no doubt that his design is to admonish them, that, while eagerly desirous to come forth,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_620"></A><A HREF="#fn_620"><FONT SIZE="1">621</FONT></A>
 			  they should be on their guard against any contamination from the many pollutions with which the country   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_621"></A><A HREF="#fn_621"><FONT SIZE="1">622</FONT></A>
 			  was overrun. Now this is no less applicable to us, than to the ancient Levites, for if so much purity is required on the part of the <i>keepers of the vessels, </i>how much more in the <i>vessels </i>themselves!   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_622"></A><A HREF="#fn_622"><FONT SIZE="1">623</FONT></A>
 			  Now all our members are <i>vessels, </i>set apart for the spiritual worship of God; we are also a <i>royal priesthood. </i>(<a name="xii.ii-p61.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009">1Pe 2:9</a><a name="xii.ii-p61.2"></A>.) Hence, as we are redeemed by the grace of God, it is befitting that we keep ourselves undefiled in respect of all uncleanness, that we may 			 not pollute the sanctuary of God. As, however, while remaining in this world, we are nevertheless redeemed, and rescued, from the pollutions of the world, so we are not to quit life with the view of departing from all uncleanness, but must simply avoid all participation. The sum is this. &#8220;If with a true affection of the heart, we aim at the benefit of redemption, we must beware of defiling ourselves by any contamination from its pollutions.&#8221;</p>

<p><a name="xii.ii-p63"></A><b>18. </b><i>I will be a Father unto you.</i> This promise does not occur in one passage merely, but is repeated in various instances. Paul has added it with this view, that a recognition of the great honor to which God has exalted us, might be a motive to stir us up to a more ardent desire for holiness. For when God has restored his Church which he has 			 gathered from profane nations, their redemption is attended with this fruit, that believers are seen to be his <i>sons and daughters</i> It is no common honor that we are reckoned among the sons of God: it belongs to us in our turn to take care, that we do not show ourselves to be degenerate children to him. For what injury we do to God, if while we call him father, we defile ourselves with abominations of idols! Hence, the 			 thought of the high distinction to which he has elevated us, ought to whet our desire for holiness and purity.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xii.i-p33"></A> &#8220;<i>The grace of God</i>,&#8221; says Dr. Brown, when commenting on <a name="xii.i-p33.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1005.htm#012">1Pe 5:12</a><a name="xii.i-p33.1"></A>, &#8220;properly signifies &#8212; the kindness, the free favor of God, as a principle in the Divine mind; but is often employed to signify the deeds of kindness, the gifts and benefits, in which the principle finds expression. It has been common to interpret the phrase here as equivalent to the gospel, 				  the revelation of God&#8217;s grace; and the Apostle has been considered as affirming that the doctrine which those he was writing to had embraced, and to which they had adhered &#8212; to use the Apostle Paul&#8217;s phrase, &#8216;which they had received, and in which they stood,&#8217; was the true gospel. But I doubt if the gospel is ever called the grace of God in the New Testament; and I equally doubt whether the words, thus understood, are an accurate statement of what this Epistle actually contains. There are just 				  two other passages in the New Testament in which the grace of God has been supposed to be a designation of the gospel. After stating the message of mercy, which the ministers of reconciliation are called to deliver, the Apostle, in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, says &#8212; &#8217;We beseech you that ye receive not <i>the grace</i>, or <i>this grace of God in vain</i>,&#8217; (<a name="xii.i-p33.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001">2Co 6:1</a><a name="xii.i-p33.2"></A>.) The reference here 				  is, no doubt, to the gospel, but the meaning of the phrase, <i>the grace of God</i>, is plainly just this divine favor, this benefit which so expresses, and, as it were, embodies, the divine grace. And in the Epistle to Titus, the same Apostle states, that &#8216;the grace of God bringing salvation&#8217; has been manifested, or has &#8216;appeared, teaching&#8217; those who apprehend it, &#8216;to deny ungodliness, and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present world.&#8217; (<a name="xii.i-p33.3"></A>Titus 2:11, 12.) The grace of God is often said to mean here the gospel, but the gospel is the manifestation, the revelation of this grace; and the truth, taught in the passage is, that the free, sovereign mercy of God, when it is apprehended by the sinner, is the true principle of holiness in the heart and life.&#8221; &#8212; <i>Brown&#8217;s</i> Expository Discourses on First Peter, volume 3 pp. 295, 296. &#8212; 				  <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xii.ii-p25"></A> &#8220;From a tender and considerate regard to the good of the Christians at Corinth, he&#8221; (Paul) &#8220;had determined not to revisit them, until their unseemly heats and factions were allayed. How was he affected while he waited at Ephesus to receive the tidings of this longed-for but protracted issue? &#8216;O ye Corinthians! our mouth is opened unto you; our heart is enlarged!&#8217; What a picture of a heart! We see him standing on the shore of the &#8216;gean Sea, over 				  against Corinth, with his arms extended towards that city, and in the attitude of speaking. We hear the words by which he seeks to relieve his overcharged breast, heaving and ready to burst with the fullness of those desires which he had long felt to come among them, satisfy them of the sincerity of his affection, and replenish their souls with the consolation with which he himself had been comforted. &#8216;O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged! Ye are not straitened in 				  us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. Now, for a recompense in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; <i>M&#8217;Crie&#8217;s Sermons</i>, p. 29. &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

It is employed to denote 				  <i>reciprocal affection</i>, from an interesting peculiarity in the disposition of the <i>stork</i>. &#8220;This bird,&#8221; says Paxton, in his Illustrations of Scripture, (Edin. 1842,) volume 2, p. 432, &#8220;has long been celebrated for her amiable and pious dispositions, in which she has no rival among the feathered race. Her kind benevolent temper she discovers in feeding her parents in the time of incubation, when they 				  have not leisure to seek their food, or when they have become old, and unable to provide for themselves.&#8221; The English word <i>stork</i> is derived from <a name="xii.ii-p31.4"></A>&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#947;&#8052;, affection, while the Hebrew name for this animal, <a name="xii.ii-p31.5"></A>&#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;&#1492;, (<i>chasidah</i>,) is derived from <a name="xii.ii-p31.6"></A>&#1495;&#1505;&#1491; (<i>chesed</i>,) <i>beneficence</i>, because, says <i>Bythner</i>, &#8220;the stork nourishes, supports, and carries on its back, when weary, its aged parents.&#8221; See Calvin on the Psalms, vol. 4, p. 158, n. 2 Calvin, when commenting on <a name="xii.ii-p31.9"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#004">1Timothy 5:4</a><a name="xii.ii-p31.9"></A>, says, &#8220;<a name="xii.ii-p31.10"></A>Ips&#8217; quoque ciconi&#8217; gratitudinem suo exemplo 				  nos docent.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="xii.ii-p41"></A>  &#8220;<i>Joachim Camerarius</i>, in his Commentary on the New Testament, (Cambridge 1642,) suggests, that <a name="xii.ii-p41.1"></A>&#7952;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#950;&#965;&#947;&#959;&#8166;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;, may have a reference to a <i>balance</i>, and that Paul &#8212; would not have the Corinthians <i>unequally balanced</i> with unbelievers.
