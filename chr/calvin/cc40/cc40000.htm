<p><a name="i.i-p25"></A><b>1. </b><i>Now I make known to you.</i> He now enters on another subject &#8212; the resurrection &#8212; the belief of which among the Corinthians had been shaken by some wicked persons. It is uncertain, however, whether they doubted merely as to the ultimate resurrection of the body, or as to the immortality of the soul also. It is 			 abundantly well known, that there were a variety of errors as to this point. Some philosophers contended that souls are immortal. As to the resurrection of the body, it never entered into the mind of any one of them. The Sadducees, however, had grosser views; for they thought of nothing but the present life; nay more, they thought that the soul of man was a breath of wind without substance. It is not, therefore, altogether certain (as I have already said) whether the Corinthians had at this 			 time gone to such a height of madness, as to cast off all expectation of a future life, or whether they merely denied the resurrection of the body; for the arguments which Paul makes use of seem to imply, that they were altogether bewitched with the mad dream of the Sadducees.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p26"></A>For example, when he says,</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="i.i-p27"></A>Of what advantage is it to be baptized for the dead?<br> 			 (<a name="i.i-p27.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#029">1Co 15:29</a><a name="i.i-p27.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="i.i-p28"></A>Were it not better to eat and to drink? <br> 			 (<a name="i.i-p28.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#032">1Co 15:32</a><a name="i.i-p28.2"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="i.i-p29"></A>Why are we in peril every hour? (<a name="i.i-p29.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#030">1Co 15:30</a><a name="i.i-p29.1"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p30"></A>and the like, it might very readily be replied, in accordance with the views of the philosophers, &#8220;Because after death the soul survives the body.&#8221; Hence some apply the whole of Paul&#8217;s reasoning contained in this chapter to the immortality of the soul. For my part, while I leave undetermined what the error of the Corinthians was, yet I cannot bring myself to view Paul&#8217;s words as referring to anything else than the resurrection of the body. Let 			 it, therefore be regarded as a settled point, that it is of this exclusively that he treats in this chapter. And what if the impiety of Hymeneus and Philetus had extended thus far,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#fn_1"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>
 			 who said that <i>the resurrection was already past, </i>(<a name="i.i-p31.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#018">2Ti 2:18</a><a name="i.i-p31.2"></A>,) and that there would be nothing more of it? Similar to these, there are at the present day some madmen, or rather devils,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#fn_2"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>
 			  who call themselves Libertines.  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>
 			  To me, however, the following conjecture appears more probable &#8212; that they were carried away by some delusion,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>
 			  which took away from them the hope of a future resurrection, just as those in the present day, by imagining an allegorical resurrection,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>
 			  take away from us the true resurrection that is promised to us.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p36"></A>However this may be, it is truly a dreadful case, and next to a prodigy, that those who had been instructed by so distinguished a master, should have been capable of falling so quickly  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>
 			  into errors of so gross a nature. But what is there that is surprising in this, when in the Israelitish Church the Sadducees had the audacity to declare openly that man differs nothing from a brute, in so far as concerns the essence of the soul, and has no enjoyment but what is common to him with the beasts? Let us observe, however, that blindness of this kind is a just judgment from God, so that those who do not rest satisfied with the truth of God, are 			 tossed hither and thither by the delusions of Satan.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p38"></A>It is asked, however, why it is that he has left off or deferred to the close of the Epistle, what should properly have had the precedence of everything else? Some reply, that this was done for the purpose of impressing it more deeply upon the memory. I am rather of opinion that Paul did not wish to introduce a subject of such importance, until he had asserted his authority, which had been considerably lessened among the Corinthians, and until 			 he had, by repressing their pride, prepared them for listening to him with docility.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p39"></A><i>I make known to you.</i> To <i>make known </i>here does not mean to teach what was previously unknown to them, but to recall to their recollection what they had heard previously. &#8220;Call to your recollection, along with me, that gospel which you had learned, before you were led aside from the right 			 course.&#8221; He calls the doctrine of the resurrection <i>the</i> <i>gospel, </i>that they may not imagine that any one is at liberty to form any opinion that he chooses on this point, as on other questions, which bring with them no injury to salvation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p40"></A>When he adds, <i>which I preached to you, </i>he amplifies what he had said: <i>&#8220;If </i>you acknowledge me as an apostle, I have assuredly taught you so.&#8221; There is another amplification in the words &#8212; <i>which also ye have 			 received, </i>for if they now allow themselves to be persuaded of the contrary, they will be chargeable with fickleness. A <i>third </i>amplification is to this effect, that they had hitherto continued in that belief with a firm and steady resolution, which is somewhat more than that they had once believed. But the most important thing of all is, that he declares that their salvation is involved 			 in this, for it follows from this, that, if the resurrection is taken away, they have no religion left them, no assurance of faith, and in short, have no faith remaining. Others understand in another sense the word <i>stand, </i>as meaning that they are <i>upheld; </i>but the interpretation that I have given is a more correct one.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="i.i-p42"></A><a name="i.i-p42.1"></A></p>  		  
<p class="Super"><a name="i.i-p43"></A><b>2. </b><i>If you keep in memory </i>&#8212;<i> unless in vain</i>    			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>
 			  These two expressions are very cutting. In the <i>first, </i>he reproves their carelessness or fickleness, because such a sudden fall was an evidence that they had never understood what had been delivered to them, or that their knowledge of it had been loose and floating, inasmuch as it had so quickly vanished. By the <i>second, </i>he warns them that they 			 had needlessly and uselessly professed allegiance to Christ, if they did not hold fast this main doctrine.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>

<p class="Normal"><a name="i.i-p46"></A><a name="i.i-p46.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p47"></A><b>3. </b><i>For I delivered to you first of all</i> He now confirms what he had previously stated, by explaining that the resurrection had been preached by him, and that too as a fundamental doctrine of the gospel. <i>First of all, </i>says he, as it is wont 			 to be with a foundation in the erecting of a house. At the same time he adds to the authority of his preaching, when he subjoins, that he <i>delivered </i>nothing but <i>what he had received, </i>for he does not simply mean that he related what he had from the report of others, but that it was what had been enjoined upon him by the 			 Lord.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A>
 			  For the word   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A>
 			  must be explained in accordance with the connection of the passage. Now it is the duty of an apostle to bring forward nothing but what he <i>has received from the Lord, </i>so as from hand to hand   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>
 			  (as they say) to administer to the Church the pure word of God.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p51"></A><i>That Christ died, etc</i>. See now more clearly whence he received it, for he quotes <i>the Scriptures </i>in proof. In the first place, he makes mention of the death of Christ, nay also of his burial, that we may infer, that, as he was like us in these things, he is so also in his resurrection. He has, 			 therefore, died with us that we may rise with him. In his burial, too, the reality of the death in which he has taken part with us, is made more clearly apparent. Now there are many passages of Scripture in which Christ&#8217;s death and <i>resurrection </i>are predicted, but nowhere more plainly   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>
 			  than in <a name="i.i-p52.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#000">Isa 53</a><a name="i.i-p52.2"></A>, in <a name="i.i-p52.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026">Da 9:26</a><a name="i.i-p52.3"></A>, and in <a name="i.i-p52.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#000">Ps 22</a><a name="i.i-p52.4"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p53"></A><i>For our sins</i> That is, that by taking our curse upon him he might redeem us from it. For what else was Christ&#8217;s death, but a sacrifice for expiating our sins &#8212; what but a satisfactory penalty, by which we might be reconciled to God &#8212; what but the condemnation of one, for the purpose of obtaining forgiveness for us? He speaks also in the same 			 manner in <a name="i.i-p53.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025">Ro 4:25</a><a name="i.i-p53.1"></A>, but in that passage, on the other hand, he ascribes it also to the resurrection as its effect &#8212; that it confers righteousness upon us; for as sin was done away through the death of Christ, so righteousness is procured through his resurrection. This distinction must be carefully <i>observed, </i>that we may know what we must 			 look for from the death of Christ, and what from his resurrection. When, however, the Scripture in other places makes mention only of his death, let us understand that in those cases his <i>resurrection </i>is included in his death, but when they are mentioned separately, the commencement of our salvation is (as we see) in the one, and the consummation of it in the other.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="i.i-p54"></A><a name="i.i-p54.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p55"></A><b>5. </b><i>That he was seen by Cephas</i> He now brings forward <i>eye</i> <i>witnesses, (</i><a name="i.i-p55.1"></A>&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8057;&#960;&#964;&#945;&#962;<i>) </i>as they are called by Luke, (<a name="i.i-p55.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#002">Lu 1:2</a><a name="i.i-p55.2"></A>,) who saw the accomplishment of what the Scriptures had foretold would take place. He does not, however, adduce them all, for he makes no mention of women. When, therefore, he says that he appeared first to Peter, you are to understand by this that he is put before all the <i>men, </i>so that there is nothing inconsistent with this in the statement of Mark 			 (<a name="i.i-p55.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009">Mr 16:9</a><a name="i.i-p55.3"></A>) that <i>he appeared to Mary.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p56"></A>But how is it that he says, that <i>he appeared to the twelve, </i>when, after the death of Judas, there were only eleven remaining? Chrysostom is of opinion that this took place after Matthias had been chosen in his room. Others have chosen rather to correct the expression, looking upon it as a mistake   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>
 			  But as we know, that there were <i>twelve </i>in number that were set apart by Christ&#8217;s appointment, though one of them had been expunged from the roll, there is no absurdity in supposing that the name was retained. On this principle, there was a body of men at Rome that were called <a name="i.i-p57.6"></A>Centumviri, 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A>
 			  while they were in number 102.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A>
 			  By <i>the twelve, </i>therefore, you are simply to understand the chosen Apostles.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p60"></A>It does not quite appear <i>when </i>it was that this <i>appearing to more than five hundred</i> took place. Only it is possible that this large multitude assembled at Jerusalem, when he manifested himself to them. For Luke (<a name="i.i-p60.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#033">Lu 24:33</a><a name="i.i-p60.1"></A>) makes mention in a general way of the disciples who had assembled with the eleven; but how many there were he does not say. Chrysostom refers it to the ascension, and explains the word <a name="i.i-p60.2"></A>&#7952;&#960;&#8049;&#957;&#969; to mean, <i>from on high.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>
 			  Unquestionably, as to what he says in reference to his having appeared to James apart, this may have been subsequently to the ascension.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p62"></A>By <i>all the Apostles</i> I understand not merely the <i>twelve, </i>but also those disciples to whom Christ had assigned the office of preaching the gospel.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A>
 			  In proportion as our Lord was desirous that there should be many witnesses of his resurrection, and that it should be frequently testified of, let us know that it should be so much the more <i>surely believed among us. </i>(<a name="i.i-p63.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#001">Lu 1:1</a><a name="i.i-p63.2"></A>.) Farther, inasmuch as the Apostle proves the resurrection of Christ 			 from the fact that he appeared to many, he intimates by this, that it was not figurative but true and natural, for the eyes of the body cannot be witnesses of a spiritual resurrection.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="i.i-p64"></A><a name="i.i-p64.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p65"></A><b>8. </b><i>Last of all to me, as to one born prematurely, </i>He now introduces himself along with the others, for Christ had manifested himself to him as alive, and invested with glory.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A>
 			  As it was no deceptive vision, it was calculated to be of use   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A>
 			  for establishing a belief in the resurrection, as he also makes use of this argument in <a name="i.i-p67.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#008">Ac 26:8</a><a name="i.i-p67.2"></A>. But as it was of no small importance that his authority should have the greatest weight and influence among the Corinthians, he introduces, by the way, a commendation of himself personally, but at the same time qualified in such a manner that, while he claims much for 			 himself, he is at the same time exceedingly modest. Lest any one, therefore, should meet him with the objection: &#8220;Who art thou that we should give credit to thee?&#8221; he, of his own accord, confesses his unworthiness, and, in the first place, indeed he compares himself to one that is <i>born prematurely, </i>and that, in my opinion, with reference to his sudden conversion. For as infants do not come forth 			 from the womb, until they have been there formed and matured during a regular course of time, so the Lord observed a regular period of time in creating, nourishing, and forming his Apostles. Paul, on the other hand, had been cast forth from the womb when he had scarcely received the vital spark.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A>
 			  There are some that understand the term rendered <i>abortive </i>as employed to mean <i>posthumous;</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A>
 			  but the former term is much more suitable, inasmuch as he was in one moment begotten, and born, and a man of full age. Now this premature birth renders the grace of God more illustrious in Paul than if he had by little and little, and by <i>successive </i>steps, grown up to maturity in Christ.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="i.i-p70"></A><a name="i.i-p70.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p71"></A><b>9. </b><i>For I am the least</i> It is not certain whether his enemies threw out this for the purpose of detracting from his credit, or whether it was entirely of his own accord, that he made the <i>acknowledgment. </i>For my part, while I have no doubt that, he was at all times 			 voluntarily, and even cheerfully, disposed to abase himself, that he might magnify the grace of God, yet I suspect that in this instance he wished to obviate calumnies. For that there were some at Corinth that made it their aim to detract from his dignity by malicious slander, may be inferred not only from many foregoing passages, but also from his adding a little afterwards a comparison, which he would assuredly never have touched upon, if he had not been constrained to it by the wickedness of 			 some, &#8220;Detract from me as much as you please &#8212; I shall suffer myself to be cast down below the ground &#8212; I shall suffer myself to be of no account whatever,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A>
 			  that the goodness of God towards me may shine forth the more. Let me, therefore, be reckoned the <i>least of the Apostles: </i>nay more, I acknowledge myself to be unworthy of this distinction. For by what merits could I have attained to that honor? When <i>I persecuted the Church of God, </i>what did I merit? But there is no reason why you should judge of me according to my own worth,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A>
 			  for the Lord did not look to what I was, but made me by his grace quite another man.&#8221; The sum is this, that Paul does not refuse to be the most worthless of all, and next to nothing, provided this contempt does not impede him in any degree in his ministry, and does not at all detract from his doctrine. He is contented that, as to himself, he shall be reckoned unworthy of any honor, provided only he commends his apostleship in respect of the 			 <i>grace conferred upon him. </i>And assuredly God had not adorned him with such distinguished endowments in order that his grace might lie buried or neglected, but he had designed thereby to render his apostleship illustrious and distinguished.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="i.i-p74"></A><a name="i.i-p74.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p75"></A><b>10.</b> <i>And his grace was not vain.</i> Those that set free-will in opposition to the grace of God, that whatever good we do may not be ascribed wholly to Him, wrest these words to suit their own interpretation &#8212; as if Paul boasted, that he had by his own industry taken care that God&#8217;s grace toward 			 him had not been misdirected. Hence they infer, that God, indeed, offers his grace, but that the right use of it is in man&#8217;s own power, and that it is in his own power to prevent its being ineffectual. I maintain, however, that these words of Paul give no support to their error, for he does not here claim anything as his own, as if he had himself, independently of God, done anything praiseworthy. What then? That he might not seem to glory to no purpose in mere words, while devoid of reality, he 			 says, that he affirms nothing that is not openly apparent. Farther, even admitting that these words intimate, that Paul did not abuse the grace of God, and did not render it ineffectual by his negligence, I maintain, nevertheless, that there is no reason on that account, why we should divide between him and God the praise, that ought to be ascribed wholly to God, inasmuch as he confers upon us not merely the power of doing well, but also the inclination and the accomplishment.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.i-p76"></A><i>But more abundantly</i> Some refer this to vain-glorious boasters,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A>
 			  who, by detracting from Paul, endeavored to set off themselves and their goods to advantage, as, in their opinion at least, it is not likely that he wished to enter upon a contest with the Apostles. When he compares himself, however, with the Apostles, he does so merely for the sake of those wicked persons, who were accustomed to bring them forward for the purpose of detracting from his reputation, as we see in the Epistle to the Galatians 			 (<a name="i.i-p77.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011">Ga 1:11</a><a name="i.i-p77.3"></A>.) Hence the probability is, that it is of the Apostles that he speaks, when he represents his own labors as superior to theirs, and it is quite true, that he was superior to others, not merely in respect of his enduring many hardships, encountering many dangers, abstaining from things lawful, and perseveringly despising all <i>perils; </i>(<a name="i.i-p77.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#026">2Co 11:26</a><a name="i.i-p77.4"></A>;) but also because the Lord gave to his labors a much larger measure of success.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A>

 			  they thought that only the half of the praise is ascribed to God, and that the other half is reserved for man.

 			  but at the same time it was under the influence of his own free-will, and by means of his own strength. His words, however, have quite a different meaning, for what he had said was his own, he afterwards, correcting himself, ascribes wholly to the grace of God &#8212; <i>wholly, </i>I say, not in part, for whatever he might have seemed to do, was <i>wholly, </i>he declares, the work of grace. A remarkable passage certainly, both for laying low the pride of man, and for magnifying the operation of Divine grace in us. For Paul, as though he had improperly made himself the author of anything good, corrects what he had said, and declares the <i>grace of God</i> to have been the efficient cause of the whole.

 			  They bring forward, it is true, this objection &#8212; that if the soul continued to live when separated from the body, Paul would not have said that, if the resurrection were taken away, we would <i>have hope only in this life, </i>inasmuch as there would still be some felicity remaining for the soul.

<p><a name="i.ii-p57"></A>But why does he say that we <i>would be the most miserable of all men, </i>as if the lot of the Christian were worse than that of the wicked?

I answer, that all men, it is true, whether good or bad, are liable to distresses in common, and they feel in common the same inconveniences, and the same miseries; but there are two reasons why Christians have in all ages fared worse, in addition to which, there was one that was peculiar to the times of Paul. The <i>first 			 </i>is, that while the Lord frequently chastises the wicked, too, with his lashes, and begins to inflict his judgments upon them, he at the same time peculiarly afflicts his own in various ways; &#8212; in the <i>first </i>place, because he <i>chastises those whom he loves, </i>(<a name="i.ii-p57.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006">Heb 12:6</a><a name="i.ii-p57.2"></A>;) and <i>secondly, </i>in order that he may train them to patience, that he may try their obedience, and that he may gradually prepare them by the cross for a true renovation. However it may be as to this, that statement always holds good in the case of believers <i>It is time, that judgment should begin at the house of God. </i>(<a name="i.ii-p57.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#029">Jer 25:29</a><a name="i.ii-p57.3"></A>; <a name="i.ii-p57.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017">1Pe 4:17</a><a name="i.ii-p57.4"></A>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A>

<p><a name="i.ii-p63"></A>The <i>second </i>reason is, that believers, even though they should abound in riches and in blessings of every kind, they nevertheless do not go to excess, and do not gormandize at their ease; in fine, they do not enjoy the world, as unbelievers do, but go forward with anxiety, constantly <i>groaning, </i>(<a name="i.ii-p63.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#002">2Co 5:2</a><a name="i.ii-p63.1"></A>,) partly from a consciousness of 			 their weakness, and partly from an eager longing for the future life.

</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.ii-p65"></A>The <i>third </i>reason, which was peculiar, as I have said, to the age of the Apostle, is &#8212; that at that time the name of <i>Christians </i>was so odious and abominable, that no one could then take upon himself the name of Christ without exposing his life to imminent peril.

 			  by a similitude taken, as it appears, from the ancient ritual of the law.

I rather prefer, however, to understand the statement in this sense 			 &#8212; that the rest of the dead will follow him, as the entire harvest does the <i>first-fruits;</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">49</FONT></A>

<p><a name="i.iii-p26"></A><b>21.</b> <i>Since by man came death</i> The point to be proved is, that Christ is the <i>first-fruits, </i>and that it was not merely as an individual that he was raised up from the dead. He proves it from contraries, because death is not from nature, but 			 from man&#8217;s sin. As, therefore, Adam did not die for himself alone, but for us all, it follows, that Christ in like manner, who is the antitype,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">50</FONT></A>
 			  did not rise for himself alone; for he came, that he might restore everything that had been ruined in Adam.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iii-p28"></A>We must observe, however, the force of the argument; for he does not contend by similitude, or by example, but has recourse to opposite causes for the purpose of proving opposite effects. The cause of death is Adam, and we die in him: hence Christ, whose office it is to restore to us what we lost in Adam, is the cause of life to us; and his resurrection is the ground-work and pledge of ours. And as the former was the beginning of death, so the 			 latter is of life. In the fifth chapter of the Romans (<a name="i.iii-p28.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#000">Ro 5</a><a name="i.iii-p28.1"></A>) he follows out the same comparison; but there is this difference, that in that passage he reasons respecting a spiritual life and death, while he treats here of the resurrection of the body, which is the fruit of spiritual life.</p>

 			  would not be before Christ&#8217;s coming. But as this world is like a stormy sea, in which we are continually tossed, and our condition is so uncertain, or rather is so full of troubles, and there are in all things such sudden changes, this might be apt to trouble weak minds. Hence he now leads them forward to that day, saying that all things will be set in order. <i>Then, </i>therefore, shall come 			 <i>the </i>end &#8212; that is, the goal of our course &#8212; a quiet harbour &#8212; a condition that will no longer be exposed to changes; and he at the same time admonishes us, that that <i>end </i>must be waited for, because it is not befitting that we should be crowned in the middle of the course. In what respect Christ will <i>deliver up the kingdom to the 			 Father,</i> will be explained in a little. When he says, <i>God and the Father, </i>this may be taken in two senses &#8212; either that God the Father is called the God and Father of Christ, or that the name of <i>Father </i>is added by way of explanation. The conjunction <a name="i.iii-p35.2"></A><i>et</i><i> (and) </i>will in the <i>latter </i>case mean <i>namely. </i>As to the <i>former </i>signification, there is nothing either absurd, or unusual, in the saying, that Christ is inferior to God, in respect of his human nature.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iii-p36"></A><i>When he shall have abolished all rule.</i> Some understand this as referring to the powers that are opposed to Christ himself; for they have an eye to what immediately follows, <i>until he shall have put all his enemies, etc.</i> This 			 clause, however, corresponds with what goes before, when he said, that Christ would not sooner <i>deliver up the kingdom</i> Hence there is no reason why we should restrict in such a manner the statement before us. I explain it, accordingly, in a general way, and understand by it &#8212; all powers that are lawful and <i>ordained by God. </i>(<a name="i.iii-p36.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#001">Ro 13:1</a><a name="i.iii-p36.1"></A>.) In the <i>first </i>place, what we find in the Prophets (<a name="i.iii-p36.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa013.htm#010">Isa 13:10</a><a name="i.iii-p36.2"></A>; <a name="i.iii-p36.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze032.htm#007">Eze 32:7</a><a name="i.iii-p36.3"></A>) as to the 			 darkening of the sun and moon, that God alone may shine forth, while it has begun to be fulfilled under the reign of Christ, will, nevertheless, not be fully accomplished until the last day; but then <i>every height shall be brought low, </i>(<a name="i.iii-p36.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk003.htm#005">Lu 3:5</a><a name="i.iii-p36.4"></A>,) that the glory of God may alone shine forth. Farther, we know that all earthly principalities and 			 honors are connected exclusively with the keeping up of the present life, and, consequently, are a part of the world. Hence it follows that they are temporary.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iii-p37"></A>Hence as the world will have an end, so also will government, and magistracy, and laws, and distinctions of ranks, and different orders of dignities, and everything of that nature. There will be no more any distinction between servant and master, between king and peasant, between magistrate and private citizen. Nay more, there will be then an end put to angelic principalities in heaven, and to ministries and superiorities in the Church, that 			 God may exercise his power and dominion by himself alone, and not by the hands of men or angels. The angels, it is true, will continue to exist, and they will also retain their distinction. The righteous, too, will shine forth, every one according to the measure of his grace; but the angels will have to resign the dominion, which they now exercise in the name and by the commandment of God. Bishops, teachers, and Prophets will cease to hold these distinctions, and will resign the office which 			 they now discharge. <i>Rule</i>, and <i>authority, </i>and <i>power </i>have much the same meaning in this passage; but these three terms are conjoined to bring out the meaning more fully.</p>

<p><a name="i.iii-p39"></A><b>25.</b> <i>For he must reign</i> He proves that the time is not yet come when Christ will <i>deliver up the kingdom to the Father, </i>with the view of showing at the same time that the <i>end </i>has not yet 			 come, when all things will be put into a right and tranquil state, because Christ has not yet subdued all his enemies. Now that <i>must </i>be brought about, <i>because </i>the Father has placed him at his right hand with this understanding, that he is not to resign the authority that he has received, until they have been subdued under his power. And this is said for the consolation of the pious, that they may 			 not be impatient on account of the long delay of the resurrection. This statement occurs in <a name="i.iii-p39.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001">Ps 110:1</a><a name="i.iii-p39.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iii-p40"></A>Paul, however, may seem to refine upon the word <i>until </i>beyond what the simple and natural meaning of the word requires; for the Spirit does not in that passage give intimation of what shall be afterwards, but simply of what must be previously. I answer, that Paul does not conclude that Christ will <i>deliver up the kingdom to the Father, </i>on the ground of its having been so predicted in the Psalm, but he has made use of this quotation from the Psalm, for the purpose of proving that the day of <i>delivering up the kingdom </i>had not yet arrived, because Christ has still to do with his enemies. Paul, however, explains in passing what is meant by Christ&#8217;s sitting at the right hand of the Father, when in place of 			 that figurative expression he makes use of the simple word <i>reign.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iii-p41"></A><i>The last enemy</i> &#8212; <i>death</i> We see that there are still many enemies that resist Christ, and obstinately oppose his reign. But <i>death </i>will be <i>the last enemy </i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">54</FONT></A>
 			 <i> that will be destroyed. </i>Hence Christ must still be the administrator of his Father&#8217;s kingdom. Let believers, therefore, be of good courage, and not give up hope, until everything that must precede the resurrection be accomplished. It is asked, however, in what sense he affirms that death shall be the <i>last enemy </i>  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">55</FONT></A>
 			 <i> that will be destroyed, </i>when it has been already destroyed by Christ&#8217;s death, or at least, by his resurrection, which is the victory over death, and the attainment of life? I answer, that it was <i>destroyed </i>in such a way as to be no longer deadly to believers, but not in such a way as to occasion them no uneasiness. The Spirit of God, it is true, dwelling in us is life; but we still carry about 			 with us a mortal body. (<a name="i.iii-p43.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#024">1Pe 1:24</a><a name="i.iii-p43.2"></A>.) The substance of death in us will one day be drained off, but it has not been so as yet. We are <i>born again of incorruptible seed, </i>(<a name="i.iii-p43.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#023">1Pe 1:23</a><a name="i.iii-p43.3"></A>,) but we have not yet arrived at perfection. Or 			 to sum up the matter briefly in a similitude, the sword of death which could penetrate into our very hearts has been blunted. It wounds nevertheless still, but without any danger;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">56</FONT></A>
 			  for we die, but by dying we enter into life. In fine, as Paul teaches elsewhere as to sin, (<a name="i.iii-p44.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#012">Ro 6:12</a><a name="i.iii-p44.2"></A>,) such must be our view as to death &#8212; that <i>it dwells </i>indeed in us, but it does not <i>reign</i></p>

<p><a name="i.iii-p46"></A><b>27.</b> <i>He hath put all things under his feet</i> Some think that this quotation is taken from <a name="i.iii-p46.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006">Ps 8:6</a><a name="i.iii-p46.1"></A><i>, </i>and I have no objection to this, though there would be 			 nothing out of place in reckoning this statement to be an inference that is drawn by Paul from the nature of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. Let us follow, however, the more generally received opinion. Paul shows from that Psalm, that God the Father has conferred upon Christ the power of all things, because it is said, <i>Thou hast put all things under his feet</i> The words are in themselves plain, 			 were it not that there are two difficulties that present <i>themselves</i> &#8212; <i>first, </i>that the Prophet speaks here not of Christ alone, but of the whole human race; and <i>secondly, </i>that by <i>all things </i>he means only those things that have to do with the convenience of the life of the body, as we find in 			 <a name="i.iii-p46.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#019">Ge 2:19</a><a name="i.iii-p46.2"></A>. The solution of the former difficulty is easy; for as Christ is the <i>first-born of every creature, </i>(<a name="i.iii-p46.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#015">Col 1:15</a><a name="i.iii-p46.3"></A>,) and the <i>heir of all things, </i>(<a name="i.iii-p46.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002">Heb 1:2</a><a name="i.iii-p46.4"></A>,) God, the Father, has not conferred upon the human race the use of all creatures in such a way as to hinder that in the mean time the chief power, and, so to speak, the rightful dominion, remain in Christ&#8217;s hands. Farther, we know, that Adam lost the right that had been conferred upon him, so that we can no longer call anything our own. For the <i>earth was cursed, 			 </i>(<a name="i.iii-p46.5"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#017">Ge 3:17</a><a name="i.iii-p46.5"></A>,) and everything that it contains; and it is through Christ alone that we recover what has been taken from us.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">57</FONT></A>
 			  It is with propriety, therefore, that this commendation belongs to Christ personally &#8212; that the Father has <i>put all things under his feet, </i>inasmuch as we rightfully possess nothing except in him. For how shall we become heirs of God, if we are not his sons, and by whom are we made his sons but by Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iii-p48"></A>The solution of the <i>second </i>difficulty is as follows &#8212; that the Prophet, it is true, especially mentions <i>fowls of heaven, fishes of the sea, </i>and <i>beasts of the field, </i>because this kind of dominion is visible, and is more apparent to the eye; but at the same time the general statement reaches much farther &#8212; to the heavens and the earth, and everything that they contain. Now the subjection must have a corrrespondence with the 			 character of him who rules &#8212; that is, it has a suitableness to his condition, so as to correspond with it. Now Christ does not need animals for food, or other creatures for any necessity. He rules, therefore, that all things may be subservient to his glory, inasmuch as he adopts us as participants in his dominion. The fruit of this openly appears in visible creatures; but believers feel in their consciences an inward fruit, which, as I have said, extends farther.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iii-p49"></A><i>All things put under him, except him who put all things under him.</i> He insists upon two things &#8212; <i>first, </i>that all things must be brought under subjection to Christ before he restores to the Father the dominion of the world, and <i>secondly, </i>that the Father has given all things into the hands of his Son in such a way as to retain the principal right in his own hands. From the <i>former </i>of these it follows, that the hour of the last judgment is not yet come &#8212; from the <i>second, </i>that Christ is now the medium between us and the Father in such a way as to bring us at length to him. Hence he immediately infers as follows: 			 <i>After he shall have subjected all things to him, then shall the Son subject himself to the Father. </i>&#8220;Let us wait patiently until Christ shall vanquish all his enemies, and shall bring us, along with himself, under the dominion of God, that the kingdom of God may in every respect be accomplished in <i>us.</i>&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iii-p50"></A>This statement, however, is at first view at variance with what we read in various passages of Scripture respecting the eternity of Christ&#8217;s kingdom. For how will these things correspond &#8212; Of <i>his kingdom there will be no end, </i>(<a name="i.iii-p50.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014">Dan. 7:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#027">27</a><a name="i.iii-p50.1"></A>; <a name="i.iii-p50.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#033">Lu 1:33</a><a name="i.iii-p50.2"></A>; 			 <a name="i.iii-p50.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2001.htm#011">2Pe 1:11</a><a name="i.iii-p50.3"></A>,) and <i>He himself shall be subjected? </i>The solution of this question will open up Paul&#8217;s meaning more clearly. In the <i>first </i>place, it must be observed, that all power was delivered over to Christ, inasmuch as he was manifested in the flesh. It is true that such distinguished majesty would not correspond with a mere man, but, notwithstanding, <i>the Father has exalted him </i>in the same 			 nature in which he was abased, and has</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="i.iii-p51"></A>given, him a name, before which every knee must bow, etc. (<a name="i.iii-p51.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009">Phil. 2:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010">10</a><a name="i.iii-p51.1"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iii-p52"></A>Farther, it must be observed, that he has been appointed Lord and highest King, so as to be as it were the Father&#8217;s Vicegerent in the government of the world &#8212; not that he is employed and the Father unemployed (for how could that be, inasmuch as he is the wisdom and counsel of the Father, is of one essence with him, and is therefore himself God?) But the reason why the Scripture testifies, that Christ now holds dominion over 			 the heaven and the earth in the room of the Father is &#8212; that we may not think that there is any other governor, lord, protector, or judge of the dead and living, but may fix our contemplation on him alone.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">58</FONT></A>
 			  We acknowledge, it is true, God as the ruler, but it is in the face of the man Christ. But Christ will then restore the kingdom which he has received, that we may cleave wholly to God.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">59</FONT></A>
 			  Nor will he in this way resign the kingdom, but will transfer it in a manner from his humanity to his glorious divinity, because a way of approach will then be opened up, from which our infirmity now keeps us back. Thus then Christ will be <i>subjected to the Father, </i>because the vail being then removed, we shall openly behold God reigning in his 			 majesty,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">60</FONT></A>
 			  and Christ&#8217;s humanity will then no longer be interposed to keep us back from a closer view of God.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">61</FONT></A>

The same thing may be said also respecting powers that are sacred and lawful in their kind, for they in a manner hinder God&#8217;s being seen aright by us in himself. Then, on the other hand, God, holding the government of the heaven and the earth by himself, and without any medium, will in that respect be <i>all, </i>and will consequently at last be so, not only in all persons, but also in all creatures.&#8221;</p>

 			  and, as it corresponds sufficiently well with the Apostle&#8217;s design, I willingly embrace it. There would, however, be nothing out of place in understanding it as referring exclusively to believers, in whom God has now begun his kingdom, and will then perfect it, and in such a way that they shall cleave to him wholly. Both meanings sufficiently refute of themselves the wicked frenzies of some who bring forward this passage in proof of them. Some imagine, that 			 God will be <i>all in all </i>in this respect, that all things will vanish and dissolve into nothing.

Others infer from this that the Devil and all the wicked will be saved &#8212; as if God would not altogether be better known in the Devil&#8217;s destruction, than if he were to associate the Devil with himself, and make him one with himself.

<p><a name="i.iv-p16"></A><b>29.</b> <i>Else what shall they do</i> He resumes his enumeration of the absurdities, which follow from the error under which the Corinthians labored. He had set himself in the outset to do this, but he introduced instruction and consolation, by means of which he interrupted in some degree the thread 			 of his discourse. To this he now returns. In the first place he brings forward this objection &#8212; that the baptism which those received who are already regarded as dead, will be of no avail if there is no resurrection. Before expounding this passage, it is of importance to set aside the common exposition, which rests upon the authority of the ancients, and is received with almost universal consent. Chrysostom, therefore, and Ambrose, who are followed by others, are of opinion   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">63</FONT></A>
 			  that the Corinthians were accustomed, when any one had been deprived of baptism by sudden death, to substitute some living person in the place of the deceased &#8212; to be baptized at his grave. They at the same time do not deny that this custom was corrupt, and full of superstition, but they say that Paul, for the purpose of confuting the Corinthians, was contented with this single fact,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">64</FONT></A>
 			  that while they denied that there was a resurrection, they in the mean time declared in this way that they believed in it. For my part, however, I cannot by any means be persuaded to believe this,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">65</FONT></A>
 			  for it is not to be credited, that those who denied that there was a resurrection had, along with others, made use of a custom of this sort. Paul then would have had immediately this reply made to him: &#8220;Why do you trouble us with that old wives&#8217; superstition, which you do not yourself approve of?&#8221; Farther, if they had made use of it, they might very readily have replied: &#8220;If this has been hitherto practiced by us through mistake, rather let 			 the mistake be corrected, than that it should have weight attached to it for proving a point of such importance.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iv-p20"></A>Granting, however, that the argument was conclusive, can we suppose that, if such a corruption as this had prevailed among the Corinthians, the Apostle, after reproving almost all their faults, would have been silent as to this one? He has censured above some practices that are not of so great moment. He has not scrupled to give directions as to women&#8217;s having the head covered, and other things of that nature. Their corrupt administration of 			 the Supper he has not merely reproved, but has inveighed against it with the greatest keenness. Would he in the meantime have uttered not a single word in reference to such a base profanation of baptism, which was a much more grievous fault? He has inveighed with great vehemence against those who, by frequenting the banquets of the Gentiles, silently countenanced their superstitions. Would he have suffered this horrible superstition of the Gentiles to be openly carried on in the Church itself 			 under the name of sacred baptism? But granting that he might have been silent, what shall we say when he expressly makes mention of it? Is it, I pray you, a likely thing that the Apostle would bring forward in the shape of an argument a sacrilege  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">66</FONT></A>
 			  by which baptism was polluted, and converted into a mere magical abuse, and yet not say even one word in condemnation of the fault? When he is treating of matters that are not of the highest importance, he introduces nevertheless this parenthesis, that he <i>speaks as a man. </i>(<a name="i.iv-p21.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom003.htm#005">Ro 3:5</a><a name="i.iv-p21.2"></A>; <a name="i.iv-p21.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#019">Ro 6:19</a><a name="i.iv-p21.3"></A>; <a name="i.iv-p21.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#015">Ga 3:15</a><a name="i.iv-p21.4"></A>.) Would not this have been a more befitting and suitable place for such a parenthesis? Now from his making mention of such a thing without any word of reproof, who would not understand it to be a thing that was allowed? For my part, I assuredly understand him to speak here of the right use of baptism, and not of an abuse of it of that nature.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iv-p22"></A>Let us now inquire as to the meaning. At one time I was of opinion, that Paul here pointed out the universal design of baptism, for the advantage of baptism is not confined to this life; but on considering the words afterwards with greater care, I perceived that Paul here points out something peculiar. For he does not speak of all when he says, <i>What shall they do, who are 			 baptized</i>? <i>etc.</i> Besides, I am not fond of interpretations, that are more ingenious than solid. What then? I say, that those are <i>baptized for dead, </i>who are looked upon as already dead, and who have altogether despaired of life; and in this way the particle <a name="i.iv-p22.1"></A>&#8017;&#960;&#8051;&#961; will 			 have the force of the Latin <a name="i.iv-p22.2"></A><i>pro</i><i>, </i>as when we say, <a name="i.iv-p22.3"></A><i>habere pro derelicto</i><i>;</i> &#8212; <i>to reckon as abandoned</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">67</FONT></A>
 			  This signification is not a forced one. Or if you would prefer another signification, to be <i>baptized for the dead</i> will mean &#8212; to be baptized so as to profit the dead &#8212; not the living,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">68</FONT></A>
 			  Now it is well known, that from the very commencement of the Church, those who had, while yet catechumens,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">69</FONT></A>
 			  fallen into disease,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">70</FONT></A>
 			  if their life was manifestly in danger, were accustomed to ask baptism, that they might not leave this world before they had made a profession of Christianity; and this, in order that they might carry with them the seal of their salvation.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iv-p27"></A>It appears from the writings of the Fathers, that as to this matter, also, there crept in afterwards a superstition, for they inveigh against those who delayed baptism till the time of their death, that, being once for all purged from all their sins, they might in this state meet the judgment of God.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">71</FONT></A>
 			  A gross error truly, which proceeded partly from great ignorance, and partly from hypocrisy! Paul, however, here simply mentions a custom that was sacred, and in accordance with the Divine institution &#8212; that if a catechumen, who had already in his heart embraced the Christian faith,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">72</FONT></A>
 			  saw that death was impending over him, he asked baptism, partly for his own consolation, and partly with a view to the edification of his brethren. For it is no small <i>consolation to </i>carry the token of his salvation sealed in his body. There is also an <i>edification, </i>not to be lost sight of &#8212; that of making a confession of his faith. They were, 			 then, <i>baptized for the dead,</i> inasmuch as it could not be of any service to them in this world, and the very occasion of their asking baptism was that they despaired of life. We now see that it is not without good reason that Paul asks, <i>what they would do </i>if there remained no hope after death?   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">73</FONT></A>
 			  This passage shows us, too, that those impostors who had disturbed the faith of the Corinthians, had contrived a figurative resurrection, making the farthest goal of believers to be in this world, His repeating it a second time, <i>Why are they also baptized for the dead? </i>gives it greater emphasis: &#8220;Not only are those baptized who think that they are to live longer, but those too 			 who have death before their eyes; and that, in order that they may in death reap the fruit of their baptism.&#8221;</p>

What madness were it in me to undergo so much misery, if there were no reward in reserve for me in heaven? Nay more, if my glory and bliss lie in this world, why do I not rather <i>enjoy </i>them, than of my own accord <i>resign </i>them?&#8221; He says that he <i>dies daily, </i>because he was constantly beset with dangers so formidable and so imminent, that 			 death in a manner was impending over him. A similar expression occurs in <a name="i.iv-p35.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa044.htm#022">Ps 44:22</a><a name="i.iv-p35.1"></A>, and we shall, also, find one of the same kind occurring in the second Epistle.

 			  there is no ambiguity. It is then an oath, by which he wished to arouse the Corinthians, to be more attentive in listening to him, when reasoning as to the matter in hand.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A>

<p><a name="i.iv-p41"></A>It is also a form of oath that is not common, but is suited to the subject in hand. Corresponding to this was that celebrated oath of Demosthenes, which is quoted by Fabius,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">79</FONT></A>
 			  when he swore by the Shades of those who had met death in the field of Marathon, while his object was to exhort them to defend the Republic.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">80</FONT></A>
 			  So in like manner Paul here swears by <i>the glory which Christians have in Christ.</i> Now that glory is in heaven. He shows, then, that what they called in question was a matter of which he was so well assured, that he was prepared to make use of a sacred oath &#8212; a display of skill which must be carefully noticed.</p>

There were, then, two kinds of punishment, that were totally different &#8212; to be 			 thrown to wild beasts, and to fight with wild beasts. For those that were thrown to wild beasts were straightway torn in pieces; but those that fought with wild beasts went forth armed into the arena, that if they were endued with strength, courage, and agility, they might effect their escape by dispatching the wild beasts. Nay more, there was a game in which those who fought with wild beasts were trained, like the gladiators   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">81</FONT></A>
 			  Usually, however, very few escaped, because the man who had dispatched one wild beast, was required to fight with a second,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">82</FONT></A>
 			  until the cruelty of the spectators was satiated, or rather was melted into pity; and yet there were found men so abandoned and <i>desperate, </i>as to hire themselves out for this!   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">83</FONT></A>
 			  And this, I may remark by the way, is that kind of <i>hunting </i>that is punished so severely by the ancient canons, as even civil laws brand it with a mark of infamy.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">84</FONT></A>

<p><a name="i.iv-p54"></A><i>Let us eat and drink</i> This is a saying of the Epicureans, who reckon man&#8217;s highest good as consisting in present enjoyment. Isaiah also testifies that it is a saying made use of by profligate persons, (<a name="i.iv-p54.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013">Isa 22:13</a><a name="i.iv-p54.2"></A>,) who, when the Prophets of God threaten them with ruin,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">87</FONT></A>
 			  with the view of calling them to repentance, making sport of those threatenings, encourage themselves in wantonness and unbridled mirth, and in order to show more openly their obstinacy, say, &#8220;Since die we must, let us meanwhile enjoy the time, and not torment ourselves before the time with empty fears.&#8221; As to what a certain General said to his army,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">88</FONT></A>

 			  that was an exhortation to meet death with intrepidity, and has nothing to do with this subject. I am of opinion, that Paul made use of a jest in common use among abandoned and desperately wicked persons, or (to express it shortly) a common proverb among the Epicureans to the following purpose: &#8220;If death is the end of man, there is nothing better than that he should indulge in pleasure, free from care, so long as life lasts.&#8221; Sentiments of 			 this kind are to be met with frequently in Horace.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">90</FONT></A>

 			  he meets this danger, by warning them that <i>evil communications </i>have more effect than we might suppose, in polluting our minds and corrupting our morals.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">92</FONT></A>
 			  To show this, he makes use of a quotation from the poet Menander,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">93</FONT></A>
 			  as we are at liberty to borrow from every quarter everything that has come forth from God. And as all truth is from God, there is no doubt that the Lord has put into the mouth of the wicked themselves, whatever contains true and salutary doctrine. I prefer, however, that, for the handling of this subject, recourse should be had to Basil&#8217;s Oration to the Young. Paul, then, being aware that 			 this proverb was in common use among the Greeks, chose rather to make use of it, that it might make its way into their minds more readily, than to express the same thing in his own words. For they would more readily receive what they had been accustomed to &#8212; as we have <i>experience </i>of in proverbs with which we are familiar.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.iv-p68"></A>Now it is a sentiment that is particularly worthy of attention, for Satan, when he cannot make a direct assault upon us,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">94</FONT></A>
 			  deludes us under this pretext, that there is nothing wrong in our raising any kind of disputation with a view to the investigation of truth. Here, therefore, Paul in opposition to this, warns us that we must guard against <i>evil communications, </i>as we would against the most deadly poison, <i>because, </i>insinuating themselves secretly into our minds, they straightway corrupt our whole life.

By adding, however, the adverb <i>righteously, </i>he intimates in what way he would have them <i>wake up </i>For they were sufficiently attentive and clear-sighted as to their own affairs: nay more, there can be no doubt that they congratulated themselves on their acuteness; but in the mean 			 time they were drowsy, where they ought most of all to have been on the watch.

 			  Paul, with the view of removing entirely this appearance of absurdity, makes use of an <i>anhypophora,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">101</FONT></A>
 			  that is, he brings forward by way of objection, in the person of another, what appears at first view to be at variance with the doctrine of a resurrection. For this question is not that of one who inquires doubtingly as to the mode, but of one who argues from impossibility &#8212; that is, what is said as to the resurrection is a thing incredible. Hence in his reply he repels such an objection with severity. Let us observe, then, that the persons 			 who are here introduced as speaking, are those who endeavor to disparage, in a way of scoffing, a belief in the resurrection, on the ground of its being a thing that is impossible.</p>

<p><a name="i.v-p41"></A><b>36.</b> <i>Thou fool, that which thou sowest</i> The Apostle might have replied, that the mode, which is to us incomprehensible, is nevertheless easy with God. Hence, we must not here form our judgment according to our own understanding, but must assign to the stupendous and secret power of God the 			 honor of believing, that it will accomplish what we cannot comprehend. He goes to work, however, in another way. For he shows, that the resurrection is so far from being against nature, that we have every day a clear illustration of it in the course of nature itself &#8212; in the growth of the fruits of the earth. For from what but from rottenness spring the fruits that we gather out of the earth? For when the seed has been sown, unless the grains <i>die, </i>there will be no increase. Corruption, then, being the commencement and cause of production, we have in this a sort of picture of the resurrection. Hence it follows, that we are beyond measure spiteful and ungrateful in estimating the power of God, if we take from him what is already manifest before our eyes.</p>

<p><a name="i.v-p43"></A><b>37.</b> <i>Thou sowest not that body that will spring up.</i> This comparison consists of two <i>parts</i> &#8212; <i>first, </i>that it is not to be wondered that bodies rise from rottenness, inasmuch as the same thing 			 takes place as to seed; and <i>secondly, </i>that it is not at variance with reason, that our bodies should be restored in another condition, since, from bare grain, God brings forth so many ears of corn, clothed with admirable contrivance, and stored with grains of superior quality. As, however, he might seem to intimate, by speaking in this way, that many bodies will therefore rise out of one, he modifies his discourse in another way, by saying that 			 God <i>forms the body as it pleases him, </i>meaning that in that also there is a difference in respect of quality.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.v-p44"></A>He adds, <i>to every seed its own body</i> By this clause he restricts what he had said respecting another body; for he says that, while the body is different, it is in such a way as to retain, nevertheless, its particular kind.</p>

The sum is this &#8212; that whatever diversity we see in any particular kind is a sort of prelude of the resurrection, because God clearly shows, that it is no difficult thing with him to renew our bodies by changing the present condition of things.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">102</FONT></A>

 			  in the <i>resurrection </i>of the dead. A mistake, however, is commonly fallen into in the application;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">104</FONT></A>
 			  for it is supposed that Paul meant to say, that, after the resurrection, the saints will have different degrees of honor and glory. This, indeed, is perfectly true, and is proved by other declarations of Scripture; but it has nothing to do with Paul&#8217;s object. For he is not arguing as to what difference of condition there will be among the saints after the resurrection, but in what respect our bodies at present differ from those that we will one day 			 receive.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">105</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.v-p53"></A>He removes, then, every idea of absurdity, by instituting this comparison: The substance of the sun and moon is the same, but there is a great difference between them in point of dignity and excellence.

 			 &#8220;I do not teach that anything will take place at the resurrection but what is already presented before the eyes of all.&#8221; That such is the meaning of the words is clear from the context. For whence and for what purpose would Paul make such a transition, were he now comparing them with one another in respect of the difference of their condition, while up to this point he has been comparing the present condition of all with their future condition, and immediately proceeds with that 			 comparison?</p>

 			  to distinguish between the different degrees of future glory among the saints? There can, therefore, be no doubt, that he has been, up to this point, following out one subject. He now returns to the first similitude that he had made use of, but applies it more closely to his design. Or, if you prefer it, keeping up that similitude, he figuratively compares the time of the present life to the seed-time, and the resurrection to the harvest; 			 and he says, that our body is now, indeed, subject to mortality and ignominy, but will then be glorious and incorruptible. He says the same thing in other words in <a name="i.v-p57.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021">Php 3:21</a><a name="i.v-p57.2"></A></p>

<p><a name="i.v-p60"></A><b>44. </b><i>It is sown an animal body.</i> As he could not express <i>each </i>particular by enumerating one by one, he sums up all <i>comprehensively </i>in one word, by saying that the body is now <i>animal,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">108</FONT></A>
 			  but it will then be <i>spiritual. </i>Now that is called <i>animal </i>which is quickened by <i>(</i><a name="i.v-p61.8"></A><i>anima</i><i>) </i>the soul: that is <i>spiritual </i>which is quickened by the 			 <i>Spirit.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_108"><FONT SIZE="1">109</FONT></A>
 			  Now it is the soul that quickens the body, so as to keep it from being a dead carcase. Hence it takes its title very properly from it. After the resurrection, on the other hand, that quickening influence, which it will receive from the Spirit, will be more excellent.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">110</FONT></A>
 			  Let us, however, always bear in mind, what we have seen previously &#8212; that the substance of the body is the same,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">111</FONT></A>
 			  and that it is the quality only that is here treated of. Let the present quality of the body be called, for the sake of greater plainness, <i>animation;</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_111"><FONT SIZE="1">112</FONT></A>
 			  let the future receive the name of <i>inspiration. </i>For as to the soul&#8217;s now <i>quickening </i>the body, that is effected through the intervention of many helps; for we stand in need of drink, food, clothing, sleep, and other things of a similar nature. Hence the weakness of <i>animation </i>is clearly 			 manifested. The energy of the Spirit, on the other hand, for <i>quickening, </i>will be much more complete, and, consequently, exempted from necessities of that nature. This is the simple and genuine meaning of the Apostle; that no one may, by philosophizing farther, indulge in airy speculations, as those do, who suppose that the substance of the body will be spiritual, while there is no mention made here of substance, and no change will be made upon 			 it.</p>

<p><a name="i.v-p67"></A><b>45.</b> <i>As it is written, The first Adam was made</i> Lest it should seem to be some new contrivance as to the <i>animal body,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_112"><FONT SIZE="1">113</FONT></A>
 			  he quotes Scripture, which declares that Adam <i>became a living soul, </i>(<a name="i.v-p68.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007">Ge 2:7</a><a name="i.v-p68.2"></A>) &#8212; meaning, that his body was quickened by the soul, so that he became a living man. It is asked, what is the meaning of the word <i>soul </i>here? It is well known, 			 that the Hebrew word <a name="i.v-p68.3"></A>&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;, <i>(nephesh,) </i>which Moses makes use of, is taken in a variety of senses; but in this passage it is taken to mean either vital motion, or the <i>very</i> <i>essence </i>of life itself. 			 The second of these I rather prefer. I observe that the same thing is affirmed as to beasts &#8212; that they were made <i>a living soul, </i>(<a name="i.v-p68.4"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#020">Gen. 1:20</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen001.htm#024">24</a><a name="i.v-p68.4"></A>;) but as the soul of every animal must be judged of according to its kind, there is nothing to hinder that a <i>soul, </i>that is 			 to say, vital motion, may be common to all; and yet at the same time the <i>soul </i>of man may have something peculiar and distinguishing, namely, immortal <i>essence, </i>as the light of intelligence and reason.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.v-p69"></A><i>The last Adam.</i> This expression we do not find anywhere <i>written.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_113"><FONT SIZE="1">114</FONT></A>
 			  Hence the phrase,<i> It is written, </i>must be understood as referring exclusively to the first clause; but after bringing forward this testimony of Scripture, the Apostle now begins in his own person to draw a contrast between Christ and Adam. <i>&#8220;Moses </i>relates that Adam was furnished with a <i>living soul; </i>Christ, on the other hand, is endowed with a <i>life-giving Spirit. </i>Now it is a much greater thing to be <i>life, </i>or the <i>source of life, </i>than simply to <i>live.&#8221;</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_114"><FONT SIZE="1">115</FONT></A>
 			  It must be observed, however, that Christ did also, like us, become a <i>living soul; </i>but, besides the <i>soul, </i>the Spirit of the Lord was also poured-out upon him, that by his power he might rise again from the dead, and raise up others, This, therefore, must be observed, in order that no one may imagine, (as Apollinaris 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_115"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">116</FONT></A>
 			  did of old,) that the Spirit was in Christ in place of a soul. And independently of this, the interpretation of this passage may be taken from the eighth chapter of the Romans, where the Apostle declares, that <i>the body, indeed, is dead, on account of sin, </i>and we <i>carry</i> in us the elements of death; but that <i>the Spirit of Christ, who raised him up from the dead, dwelleth also in us, </i>and that he is life, to raise up us also one day from the dead. (<a name="i.v-p72.6"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010">Rom. 8:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011">11</a><a name="i.v-p72.6"></A>.) From this you see, that we have <i>living souls, </i>inasmuch as we are men, but that we have the <i>life-giving 			 Spirit </i>of Christ poured out upon us by the grace of regeneration. In short, Paul&#8217;s meaning is, that the condition that we obtain through Christ is greatly superior to the lot of the <i>first man, </i>because a <i>living soul </i>was conferred upon Adam in his own name, and in that of his posterity, but Christ has procured for us the Spirit, who is <i>life.</i></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.v-p73"></A>Now as to his calling Christ <i>the last Adam, </i>the reason is this, that as the human race was created in the <i>first man, </i>so it is renewed in Christ. I shall express it again, and more distinctly: All men were created in the <i>first man, </i>because, whatever God designed to give to all, he conferred upon that one man, so that the condition of mankind was settled in his person. He by his fall   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">117</FONT></A>
 			  ruined himself and those that were his, because he drew them all, along with himself, into the same ruin: Christ came to restore our nature from ruin, and raise it up to a better condition than ever. They   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">118</FONT></A>
 			  are then, as it were, two sources, or two roots of the human race. Hence it is not without good reason, that the one is called the <i>first man, </i>and the other the <i>last. </i>This, however, gives no support to those madmen, who make Christ to be one of ourselves, as though there were and always had been only two men, and that this multitude which we 			 behold, were a mere phantom! A similar comparison occurs in <a name="i.v-p75.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012">Ro 5:12</a><a name="i.v-p75.2"></A></p>

Let us, therefore, not wonder, if we begin with the <i>living soul, </i>for as 			 <i>being born</i> precedes in order <i>being born again, </i>so <i>living </i>precedes <i>rising again.&#8221;</i></p>

 			  The spiritual life will come afterwards, as Christ, the <i>heavenly man, </i>came after Adam. Now the Manichees perverted this passage, with the view of proving that Christ brought a body from heaven into the womb of the Virgin. They mistakingly imagined, however, that Paul speaks here of the substance of the body, while he is discoursing rather as to its condition, or quality. Hence, although the <i>first man </i>had an immortal soul, and that too, not taken from the earth, yet he, nevertheless, savoured of the earth, from which his body had sprung, and on which he had been appointed to live. Christ, on the other hand, brought us from heaven a <i>life-giving Spirit, </i>that he might regenerate us into a better life, and elevated above the earth.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">120</FONT></A>

<p><a name="i.v-p82"></A>But some one will say in reply, Adam is said to be <i>from the earth</i> &#8212; Christ<i> from heaven; </i>the nature of the comparison  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">121</FONT></A>
 			 requires this much, that Christ have his body <i>from heaven, </i>as the body of Adam was formed <i>from the earth; </i>or, at least, that the origin of man&#8217;s soul should be <i>from the earth, </i>but that Christ&#8217;s soul had come forth from heaven. I answer, that Paul had not contrasted the two departments of the subject with such refinement and minuteness, (for this was not necessary;) but when treating of the nature of Christ and <i>Adam, </i>he made a passing allusion to the 			 creation of Adam, that he had been formed <i>from the earth,, </i>and at the same time, for the purpose of commending Christ&#8217;s excellence, he states, that he is the Son of God, who came down to us from heaven, and brings with him, therefore, a heavenly nature and influence. This is the simple meaning, while the refinement of the Manichees is a mere calumny.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.v-p84"></A>We must, however, reply to another objection still. For Christ, so long as he lived in the world, lived a life similar to ours, and therefore earthly: hence it is not a proper contrast. The solution of this question will serve farther to refute the contrivance  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">122</FONT></A>
 			  of the Manichees. For we know, that the body of Christ was liable to death, and that it was exempted from corruption, not by its essential property, (as they speak,)  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">123</FONT></A>
 			  but solely by the providence of God. Hence Christ was not merely <i>earthy </i>as to the essence of his body, but was also for a time in an earthly condition; for before Christ&#8217;s power could show itself in conferring the heavenly life, it was necessary that he should die in the <i>weakness of the flesh, </i>(<a name="i.v-p86.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2013.htm#004">2Co 13:4</a><a name="i.v-p86.2"></A>.)

 			  Let us observe, in the first place, that this is not an exhortation, but pure doctrine, and that he is not treating here of newness of life, but pursues, without any interruption, the thread of his discourse respecting the resurrection of the flesh. The meaning accordingly will be this: &#8220;As the <i>animal nature, </i>which has the <i>precedency 			 </i>in us, is the image of Adam, so we shall be conformed to Christ in the <i>heavenly nature; </i>and this will be the completion of our restoration.

 			  but that image consists in spiritual regeneration. But <i>then </i>it will be fully restored both in body and in soul, and what is now begun will be perfected, and <i>accordingly </i>we will obtain in reality what we as yet only hope for.&#8221; If, however, any one prefers a different reading, this statement will serve to spur forward the Corinthians; and if there had been a lively 			 meditation of sincere piety and a new life, it might have been the means of kindling up in them at the same time the hope of heavenly glory.</p>

<p><a name="i.vi-p20"></A>Hitherto he has included two things in his reasoning. In <i>the first </i>place, he shows that there will be a resurrection from the dead: <i>secondly, </i>he shows of what nature it will be. Now, however, he enters more thoroughly into a description of the manner of it. This he calls a <i>mystery, </i>because it had not been as yet so clearly unfolded in any statement of revelation; but he does this to make them more attentive. For that wicked doctrine had derived strength from the circumstance, that they disputed as to this matter carelessly and at their ease;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">127</FONT></A>
 			  as if it were a matter in which they felt no difficulty. Hence by the term <i>mystery, </i>he admonishes them to learn a matter, which was not only as yet unknown to them, but ought to be reckoned among God&#8217;s heavenly secrets.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p22"></A><b>51. </b><i>We shall not indeed all sleep.</i> Here there is no difference in the Greek manuscripts, but in the Latin versions there are three different readings. The <i>first </i>is, <i>We shall indeed all die, but we shall not all be changed. </i>The <i>second </i>is, <i>We shall indeed all rise again, but we shall not all be changed.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">128</FONT></A>
 			  The <i>third </i>is, <i>We shall not indeed all sleep, but we shall all be changed. </i>This diversity, I conjecture, had arisen from this &#8212; that some readers, who were not the most discerning, dissatisfied with the true reading, ventured to conjecture a reading which was more approved by them.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">129</FONT></A>
 			  For it appeared to them, at first view, to be absurd to say, that <i>all would not die, </i>while we read elsewhere, that <i>it is appointed unto all men once to die. </i>(<a name="i.vi-p24.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027">Heb 9:27</a><a name="i.vi-p24.2"></A>.) Hence they altered the meaning in this way &#8212; All <i>will not be 			 changed, though all will rise again, or will die; </i>and the <i>change </i>they interpret to mean &#8212; the glory that the sons of God alone will obtain. The true reading, however, may be judged of from the context.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p25"></A>Paul&#8217;s intention is to explain what he had said &#8212; that we will be conformed to Christ, because <i>flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.</i> A question presented itself,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">130</FONT></A>
 			  what then will become of those who will be still living at the day of the Lord? His answer is, that although <i>all will not die, </i>yet they will be renewed, that mortality and corruption may be done <i>away. </i>It is to be observed, however, that he speaks exclusively of believers; for although the resurrection of the wicked will also involve <i>change, 			 </i>yet as there is no mention made of them here, we must consider everything that is said, as referring exclusively to the elect. We now see, how well this statement corresponds with the preceding one, for as he had said, that <i>we shall bear the image of Christ, </i>he now declares, that this will take place when we shall be <i>changed, 			 </i>so that</p>  		  
<p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="i.vi-p27"></A>mortality may be swallowed up of life, (<a name="i.vi-p27.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#004">2Co 5:4</a><a name="i.vi-p27.1"></A>,)</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p28"></A>and that this renovation is not inconsistent with the fact, that Christ&#8217;s advent will find some still alive.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p29"></A>We must, however, unravel the difficulty &#8212; that <i>it is appointed unto all men once to die; </i>and certainly, it is not difficult to unravel it in this way &#8212; that as a <i>change </i>cannot take place without doing away with the previous system, that <i>change </i>is reckoned, with good reason, a kind of <i>death; </i>but, as it is not a separation of the soul from the body, it is not looked upon as an ordinary death. It will then be <i>death, </i>inasmuch as it will be the destruction of corruptible nature: it will not be a <i>sleep, </i>inasmuch as the soul will not quit the body; 			 but there will be a sudden transition from corruptible nature into a blessed immortality.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="i.vi-p30"></A><a name="i.vi-p30.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p31"></A><b>52. </b><i>In a moment</i> This is still of a general nature; that is, it includes all. For in all the change will be sudden and instantaneous, because Christ&#8217;s advent will be sudden. And to convey the idea of <i>a moment, </i>he afterwards makes use of the phrase <i>twinkling </i>(or <i>jerk) </i>of the eye, for in the Greek manuscripts there is a twofold, reading &#8212; <a name="i.vi-p31.1"></A>&#8165;&#959;&#960;&#8035; <i>(jerk,) </i>or <a name="i.vi-p31.2"></A>&#8165;&#953;&#960;&#8035; <i>(twinkling.)</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">131</FONT></A>
 			  It matters nothing, however, as to the sense. Paul has selected a movement of the body, that surpasses all others in quickness; for nothing is more rapid than a movement of the eye, though at the same time he has made an allusion to <i>sleep, </i>with which <i>twinkling of the eye</i> is contrasted.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">132</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p34"></A><i>With the last trump.</i> Though the repetition of the term might seem to place it beyond a doubt, that the word <i>trumpet</i> is here taken in its proper acceptation, yet I prefer to understand the expression as 			 metaphorical. In <a name="i.vi-p34.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016">1Th 4:16</a><a name="i.vi-p34.2"></A>, he connects together the <i>voice of the archangel </i>and the <i>trump of God: </i>As therefore a commander, with the sound of a trumpet, summons his army to battle, so Christ, by his far 			 sounding proclamation, which will be heard throughout the whole world, will summon all the dead. Moses tells us, (<a name="i.vi-p34.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016">Ex 19:16</a><a name="i.vi-p34.3"></A>,) what loud and terrible sounds were uttered on occasion of the promulgation of the law. Far different will be the commotion <i>then, </i>when not one people merely, but the whole world will be summoned to the tribunal of 			 God. Nor will the living only be convoked, but even the dead will be called forth from their graves.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">133</FONT></A>
 			  Nay more, a commandment must be given to dry bones and dust that, resuming their former appearance and reunited to the spirit, they come forth straightway as living men into the presence of Christ.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p36"></A><i>The dead shall rise</i> What he had declared generally as to all, he now explains particularly as to the living and the dead. This distinction, therefore, is simply an exposition of the foregoing statement &#8212; <i>that all will not die, but all will be changed</i>  &#8220;Those who have already died,&#8221; says he, <i>&#8220;will </i>rise again incorruptible.&#8221; See what a change there will be upon the <i>dead! </i>&#8220;Those,&#8221; says he, &#8220;who will be still alive will themselves also be <i>changed.&#8221; </i>You see then as to both.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">134</FONT></A>

</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p39"></A>When he says, <i>We shall be changed, </i>he includes himself in the number of those, who are to live till the advent of Christ. As it was now the <i>last times, </i>(<a name="i.vi-p39.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#018">1Jo 2:18</a><a name="i.vi-p39.1"></A>,) <i>that day </i>(<a name="i.vi-p39.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#018">2Ti 1:18</a><a name="i.vi-p39.2"></A>) was to be looked for by the saints every hour. At the same time, in writing to the Thessalonians, he utters that memorable prediction respecting the scattering   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">136</FONT></A>
 			  that would take place in the Church before Christ&#8217;s coming. (<a name="i.vi-p40.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#003">2Th 2:3</a><a name="i.vi-p40.2"></A>.) This, however, does not hinder that he might, by bringing the Corinthians, as it were, into immediate contact with the event, associate himself and them with those who would at that time be alive.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="i.vi-p41"></A><a name="i.vi-p41.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p42"></A><b>53. </b><i>For this corruptible must</i> Mark, how we shall live in the kingdom of God both in body and in soul, while at the same time <i>flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God</i> &#8212; for they shall previously be delivered from corruption. Our nature then, as being now 			 corruptible and mortal, is not admissible into the kingdom of God, but when it shall have put off corruption, and shall have been beautified with in-corruption, it will then make its way into it. This passage, too, distinctly proves, that we shall rise again in that same flesh that we now carry about with us, as the Apostle assigns a new quality to it which will serve as a garment. If he had said, <i>This corruptible must be renewed, </i>the error of 			 those fanatics, who imagine that mankind will be furnished with new bodies, would not have been so plainly or forcibly overthrown. Now, however, when he declares that <i>this corruptible shall be invested with glory, </i>there is no room left for cavil.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="i.vi-p43"></A><a name="i.vi-p43.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p44"></A><b>54. </b><i>Then shall be brought to pass the saying</i> This is not merely an amplification, <i>(</i><a name="i.vi-p44.1"></A>&#7952;&#960;&#949;&#958;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#945;&#963;&#8055;&#945;<i>,)</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">137</FONT></A>
 			  but a confirmation, too, of the preceding statement. For what was foretold by the Prophets must be fulfilled. Now this prediction will not be fulfilled, until our bodies, laying aside corruption, will <i>put on incorruption</i> Hence this last result, also, is necessary. To <i>come to 			 pass, </i>is used here in the sense of being <i>fully accomplished, </i>for what Paul quotes is now begun in us, and is daily, too, receiving further accomplishment; but it will not have its complete fulfillment until the last day.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p46"></A>It does not, however, appear quite manifest, from what passage he has taken this quotation, for many statements occur in the Prophets to this effect. Only the probability is, that the first clause is taken either from <a name="i.vi-p46.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#008">Isa 25:8</a><a name="i.vi-p46.1"></A>, where it is said that <i>death will be for ever destroyed </i>by the Lord,  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">138</FONT></A>
 			  or, (as almost all are rather inclined to think,) from <a name="i.vi-p47.11"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014">Ho 13:14</a><a name="i.vi-p47.11"></A>, where the Prophet, bewailing the obstinate wickedness of Israel, complains that he was like an untimely child, that struggles against the efforts of his mother in travail, that he may not <i>come </i>forth from the womb, and from this he concludes, that it was owing entirely to himself, that he was not 			 delivered from death. <i>I will ransom them, </i>says he, from <i>the power of the grave: I will rescue them from death. </i>It matters not, whether you read these words in the future of the indicative, or in the subjunctive  			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">139</FONT></A>
 			 for in either way the meaning amounts to this &#8212; that God was prepared to confer upon them salvation, if they would have allowed the favor to be conferred upon them, and that, therefore, if they perished, it was their own fault.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p49"></A>He afterwards adds,<i> I will be thy destruction, O death! thy ruin, O grave!</i> In these words God intimates, that he accomplishes the salvation of his people   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">140</FONT></A>
 			  only when death and the grave are reduced to nothing. For no one will deny, that in that passage there is a description of completed salvation. As, therefore, we do not see such a destruction of death, it follows, that we do not yet enjoy that complete salvation, which God promises to his people, and that, consequently, it is delayed until <i>that day. Then, </i>accordingly, <i>will death be swallowed up, </i>that is, it will be reduced to nothing,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_140"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">141</FONT></A>
 			  that we may have manifestly, in every particular, and in every respect, (as they say,) a complete victory over it.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">142</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="i.vi-p53"></A><a name="i.vi-p53.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p54"></A>As to the second clause, in which he triumphs over death and the grave, it is not certain whether he speaks of himself, or whether he meant there also to quote the words of the Prophet. For where we render it, &#8220;I will be thy destruction, O death! &#8212; thy ruin, O grave<i>!&#8221; </i>the Greeks have translated it, &#8220;<i>Where, O death, is thy suit?</i> 			   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">143</FONT></A>
 			  <i>where, O grave, thy sting?&#8221; </i>Now although this mistake of the Greeks is excusable from the near resemblance of the words,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">144</FONT></A>
 			  yet if any one will attentively examine the context, he will see that they have gone quite away from the Prophet&#8217;s intention. The true meaning, then, will be this &#8212; that the Lord will put an end to death, and destroy the grave. It is possible, however, that, as the Greek translation was in common use, Paul alluded to it, and in that there is nothing inconsistent, though he has not quoted literally, for instead of <i>victory </i>he has used the term <i>action, </i>or <i>law-suit.</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">145</FONT></A>
 			  I am certainly of opinion, that the Apostle did not deliberately intend to call in the Prophet as a witness, with the view of making a wrong use of his authority, but simply accommodated, in passing, to his own use a sentiment that had come into common use, as being, independently of this, of a pious nature.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">146</FONT></A>
 			  The main thing is this &#8212; that Paul, by an exclamation of a spirited nature, designed to rouse up the minds of the Corinthians, and lead them on, as it were, to a near view of the resurrection. Now, although we do not as yet behold the victory with our eyes, and the day of triumph has not yet arrived, (nay more, the dangers of war must every day be encountered,) yet the assurance of faith, as we shall have occasion to observe ere long, is not at all thereby 			 diminished.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="i.vi-p59"></A><a name="i.vi-p59.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p60"></A><b>56. </b><i>The sting of death is sin</i> In other words, &#8220;Death has no dart with which to wound us except <i>sin, </i>since <i>death </i>proceeds from the anger of God. Now it is only with our sins that God is angry. Take away sin, 			 therefore, and death will no more be able to harm us.&#8221; This agrees with what he said in <a name="i.vi-p60.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#023">Ro 6:23</a><a name="i.vi-p60.1"></A>, that <i>the wages of sin is death. </i>Here, however, he makes use of another metaphor, for he compared sin to a <i>sting, </i>with which alone death is armed for inflicting upon us a deadly wound. Let 			 <i>that </i>be taken away, and death is disarmed, so as to be no longer hurtful. Now with what view Paul says this will be explained by him ere long.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p61"></A><i>The strength of sin is the law</i> It is the law of God that imparts to that sting its deadly power, because it does not merely discover our guilt, but even increases it. A clearer exposition of this statement may be found in <a name="i.vi-p61.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#009">Ro 7:9</a><a name="i.vi-p61.1"></A>, 			 where Paul teaches us that we <i>are alive, </i>so long as we are <i>without the law, </i>because in our own opinion it is well with us, and we do not feel our own misery, until the law summons us to the judgment of God, and wounds our conscience with an apprehension of eternal death. Farther, he teaches us that sin has been in a manner lulled asleep, but is kindled up by the law, so as to rage furiously. 			 Meanwhile, however, he vindicates the law from calumnies, on the ground that it is <i>holy, and good, and just, </i>and is not of itself the parent of sin or the cause of death. Hence he concludes, that whatever there is of evil is to be reckoned to our own account, inasmuch as it manifestly <i>proceeds </i>from the depravity of our nature. Hence the law is but the <i>occasion 			 </i>of injury. The true <i>cause </i>of ruin is in ourselves. Hence he speaks of the law here as the <i>strength or power of sin</i>, because it executes upon us the judgment of God. In the mean time he does not deny, that sin inflicts death even upon those that 			 know not the law; but he speaks in this manner, because it exercises its tyranny upon them with less violence. For <i>the law came that sin might abound, </i>(<a name="i.vi-p61.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#020">Ro 5:20</a><a name="i.vi-p61.2"></A>,) or that it <i>might become beyond measure sinful. </i>(<a name="i.vi-p61.3"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#013">Ro 7:13</a><a name="i.vi-p61.3"></A>.)</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="i.vi-p62"></A><a name="i.vi-p62.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p63"></A><b>57. </b><i>But thanks be to God</i> From this it appears, why it it was that he made mention both of sin and of the law, when treating of death. Death has no <i>sting </i>with which to wound except <i>sin, </i>and the law imparts to this 			 <i>sting </i>a deadly power. But Christ has conquered sin, and by conquering it has procured victory for us, and <i>has</i> <i>redeemed us from the curse of the law. </i>(<a name="i.vi-p63.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013">Ga 3:13</a><a name="i.vi-p63.1"></A>.) Hence it follows, that we are no longer lying under the power of death. 			 Hence, although we have not as yet a full discovery of those benefits, yet we may already with confidence glory in them, because it is necessary that what has been accomplished in the Head should be accomplished, also, in the members. We may, therefore, triumph over death as subdued, because Christ&#8217;s victory is ours.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p64"></A>When, therefore, he says, that <i>victory has been given to us, </i>you are to understand by this in the <i>first </i>place, that it is inasmuch as Christ has in his own person abolished sin, has satisfied the law, has endured the curse, has appeased the anger of God, and has 			 procured life; and farther, because he has already begun to make us partakers of all those benefits. For though we still carry about with us the remains of sin, it, nevertheless, does not reign in us: though it still <i>stings </i>us, it does not do so fatally, because its edge is blunted, so that it does not penetrate into the vitals of the soul. Though the law still threatens, yet there is presented to us on the other hand, the liberty that was 			 procured for us by Christ, which is an antidote to its terrors. Though the remains of sin still dwell in us, yet the Spirit who raised up Christ from the dead is <i>life, because of righteousness. </i>(<a name="i.vi-p64.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#010">Ro 8:10</a><a name="i.vi-p64.1"></A>.) Now follows the conclusion.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="i.vi-p65"></A><a name="i.vi-p65.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p66"></A><b>58. </b><i>Wherefore, my brethren</i> Having satisfied himself that he had sufficiently proved the doctrine of the resurrection, he now closes his discussion with an exhortation; and this has much more force, than if he had made use of a simple conclusion with an affirmation. <i>Since your labor, </i>says he, <i>is not in vain in the Lord, be steadfast, and abound in good works</i> Now he says that <i>their labor is not in vain, </i>for this reason, that there is a reward laid up for them with God. This is that exclusive hope which, in the first 			 instance, encourages believers, and afterwards sustains them, so that they do not stop short in the race. Hence he exhorts them to remain <i>steadfast, </i>because they rest on a firm foundation, as they know that a better life is prepared for them in heaven.</p>  		  
<p><a name="i.vi-p67"></A>He adds &#8212; <i>abounding in the work of the Lord; </i>for the hope of a resurrection makes us not be <i>weary </i>in well doing, as he teaches in <a name="i.vi-p67.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#010">Col 1:10</a><a name="i.vi-p67.1"></A>. For 			 amidst so many occasions of offense as constantly present themselves to us, who is there that would not despond, or turn aside from the way, were it not that, by thinking of a better life he is by this means kept in the fear of God? Now, on the other hand, he intimates, that if the hope of a resurrection is taken away, then, the foundation (as it were) being rooted up, the whole structure of piety falls to the ground.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">147</FONT></A>
 			  Unquestionably, if the hope of reward is taken away and extinguished, alacrity in running will not merely grow cold, but will be altogether destroyed.</p>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="i.iii-p54"></A> &#8220;The mediatorial kingdom of Christ will end when its design is accomplished; he will cease to exercise an authority which has no longer an object. When all the elect are converted by the truth, and, being collected into one body, are presented to the Father &#8216;a glorious Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing;&#8217; when idolatry, superstition, and heresy are overthrown, and all evil is expelled from the kingdom of God; when the plans and 				  efforts of wicked spirits are defeated, and they are shut up in their prison, from which there is no escape; when death has yielded up his spoils, and laid his scepter at the feet of his Conqueror; when the grand assize has been held, his impartial sentence has pronounced the doom of the human race, and their everlasting abodes are allotted to the righteous and the ungodly, nothing will remain to be done by the power with which our Savior was invested at his ascension; and his work being 				  finished, his commission will expire. On this subject we cannot speak with certainty, and are in great danger of error, because the event is future, and our information is imperfect. Here analogy fails, and the utmost caution is necessary in borrowing an illustration from human affairs; but without insinuating that the two cases are exactly similar, may we not say, that as a regent or vicegerent of a King to whom the royal authority has been intrusted for a time, resigns it at the close, and 				  the sovereign himself resumes the reins of government; so our Redeemer, who now sways the scepter of the universe, will return his delegated power to him from whom he received it, and a new order of things will commence under which the dependence of men upon the Godhead will be immediate; and Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one in essence, counsel, and operation, will reign for ever over the inhabitants of heaven.

Men lived in sin as long as they thought they could safely, and deferred baptism till their near approach to death, under a groundless hope of washing away all their guilt at once.&#8221; See also Turretine&#8217;s Theology, (Geneva, 1690,) volume 3  &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="i.iv-p30"></A> &#8220;Baptism,&#8221; says Dr. Dick, in his Lectures on Theology, (volume 4) &#8220;imports our interest in the resurrection of Christ and its consequences. It was called by the ancients &#8216;the earnest of good things to come,&#8217; and &#8216;the type of the future resurrection.&#8217; May not this be the meaning of that passage in the fifteenth chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians, concerning which there has been such a diversity of opinion? &#8216;Else what 				  shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not? why are they then baptized for the dead?&#8217; (<a name="i.iv-p30.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#029">1Co 15:29</a><a name="i.iv-p30.1"></A>.)

According to this view of the passage, a 				  resurrection to life is one of the blessings signified and sealed by this institution. It assures us of a triumph over death and the grave, through the redeeming blood of Christ, with which we are sprinkled; and of admission into heaven, for which we are qualified by the washing of <i>regeneration.&#8221;</i> &#8212; <i>Ed.</i></p> 			 </P>

<p class="Footnote"><a name="i.iv-p71"></A> &#8220;The connection is not that in which we should have expected such a maxim to be inserted. It is in the midst of a very affecting and instructive view of the resurrection of the dead and the life everlasting; but the occasion of it was this: the Corinthians had received, from the intrusion of false teachers, principles which militated against that great doctrine. They had been taught to explain it away, and to resolve it merely into a moral process 				  which takes place in the present world; interpreting what is said of the resurrection of the dead in a mystical and figurative manner. The apostle insinuates, that it was by a mixture of the corrupt communications of these men with the Christian Church, and the intimate contact into which they had permitted themselves to come with them, that they had been led off from the fundamental doctrine of the gospel, and rejected a primary part of the apostolic testimony. &#8216;For if 				  there be no resurrection of the dead, then,&#8217; as he observed, &#8216;is Christ not risen, and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain; ye are yet in your sins.&#8217; We see, that notwithstanding the apostle had planted pure Christianity among the Corinthians, and had confirmed it by the most extraordinary miracles and supernatural operations, yet such was the contagion of evil example and corrupt communication, that the members of the Corinthian Church, in a 				  very short time, departed from the fundamental article of the truth as it is in Jesus Christ; and hence we may learn the importance, nay, the necessity, of being on our guard in this respect, and of avoiding such confidence in ourselves as might induce us to neglect the caution here so forcibly expressed &#8212; &#8217;Be not deceived; evil communications corrupt good manners.&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; <i>R.

<p class="Footnote"><a name="i.v-p47"></A> &#8220;Nearly allied to these are the examples of peculiar transformations undergone by various insects, and the state of rest and insensibility which precede those transformations; such as the chrysalis or aurelia state of butterflies, moths, and silkworms. The <a name="i.v-p47.1"></A>myrmeleon forniicaleo, of whose larva, and its extraordinary history, Reaumur and Roesel have given accurate descriptions, continues in its 				  insensible or chrysalis state about four weeks. The <a name="i.v-p47.2"></A>libellula, or dragon-fly, continues still longer in its state of inaction. Naturalists tell us that the worm repairs to the margin of its pond, in quest of a convenient place of abode, during its insensible state. It attaches itself to a plant, or piece of dry wood, and the skin, which gradually becomes parched and brittle, at last splits opposite to the upper part of the thorax: through 				  this aperture the insect, now become winged, quickly pushes its way, and being thus extricated front confinement, begins to expand its wings, to flutter, and, finally, to launch into the air with that gracefulness and ease which are peculiar to this majestic tribe. Now who that saw, for the first time, the little pendant coffin in which the insect lay entombed, and was ignorant of the transformation of which we are now speaking, would ever predict that, in a few weeks, perhaps in a few days or 				  hours, it would become one of the most elegant and active of <i>winged </i>insects? And who that contemplates, with the mind of a philosopher, this current transformation, and knows that two years before the insect mounts into the air, even while it is living in water, it has the rudiments of wings, can deny that the body of a dead man may, at some future period, be again invested with vigor and activity, and soar to regions for which some latent organization may have peculiarly fitted it?&#8221; &#8212; 				  <i>Olythus Gregory&#8217;s </i>Letters on the Evidences of the Christian Religion, page 225. &#8212; Ed.</p> 			 </P>
