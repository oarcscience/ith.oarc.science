<span id="xiv-p1"></span>CHAPTER 8

<span id="xiv.i"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p1"></span><span id="xiv.i-p1.1"></span>[2 Corinthians
8:1-7](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#001.md)<span id="xiv.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p2"></span>**1.** Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit
of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;

<span id="xiv.i-p3"></span>**1.** Certiores autem vos facio, fratres, de
gratia Dei, quae data est in Ecclesiis Macedoniae;

<span id="xiv.i-p4"></span>**2.** How that in a great trial of
affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded
unto the riches of their liberality.

<span id="xiv.i-p5"></span>**2.** Quoniam in multa probatione
afflictionis exsuperavit gaudium ipsorum, et profunda illorum paupertas
exundavit in divitias simplicitatis  <span
id="fr_657"></span>[658](#fn_657.md) eorum.

<span id="xiv.i-p7"></span>**3.** For to *their* power, I bear record,
yea, and beyond *their* power, *they were* willing of themselves;

<span id="xiv.i-p8"></span>**3.** Nam pro viribus (testor) atque etiam
supra vires fuerunt voluntarii;

<span id="xiv.i-p9"></span>**4.** Praying us with much intreaty that we
would receive the gift, and *take upon us* the fellowship of the
ministering to the saints.

<span id="xiv.i-p10"></span>**4.** Multa cum obtestatione rogantes nos,
ut gratiam et societatem ministrii susciperemus in sanctos.

<span id="xiv.i-p11"></span>**5.** And *this they did*, not as we hoped,
but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of
God.

<span id="xiv.i-p12"></span>**5.** Ac non quatenus sperabamus: sed se
ipsos dediderunt, primum Domino, deinde et nobis per voluntatem Dei:

<span id="xiv.i-p13"></span>**6.** Insomuch that we desired Titus, that
as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.

<span id="xiv.i-p14"></span>**6.** Ut abhortaremur Titum, ut quemadmodum
ante coepisset, ita et consummaret erga vos hanc quoque gratiam.

<span id="xiv.i-p15"></span>**7.** Therefore, as ye abound in every
*thing, in* faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and *in* all diligence,
and *in* your love to us; *see* that ye abound in this grace also.

<span id="xiv.i-p16"></span>**7.** Verum quemadmodum ubique abundatis
fide, et scientia, et omnia diligentia, et ea, quae ex vobis erga nos
est caritate: facite, ut in hac quoque beneficentia abundetis.

<span id="xiv.i-p17"></span> 

<span id="xiv.i-p18"></span><span id="xiv.i-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p19"></span>As, in the event of the Corinthians
retaining any feeling of offense, occasioned by the severity of the
preceding Epistle, that might stand in the way of Paul’s authority
having influence over them, he has hitherto made it his endeavor to
conciliate their affections. Now, after clearing away all occasion of
offense, and regaining favor for his ministry, he recommends to them the
brethren at Jerusalem, that they may furnish help to their necessities.
He could not, with any great advantage, have attempted this in the
commencement of the Epistle. Hence, he has prudently deferred it, until
he has prepared their minds for it. Accordingly, he takes up the whole
of this chapter, and the next, in exhorting the Corinthians to be active
and diligent in collecting alms to be taken to Jerusalem for relieving
the indigence of the brethren. For they were afflicted with a great
famine, so that they could scarcely support life without being aided by
other churches. The Apostles had intrusted Paul with this matter, (<span
id="xiv.i-p19.1"></span>[Ga 2:10](../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#010.md)<span
id="xiv.i-p19.1"></span>,) and he had promised to concern himself in
reference to it, and he had already done so in part, as we have seen in
the former Epistle.  <span id="fr_658"></span>[659](#fn_658.md) Now,
however, he presses them still farther.

<span id="xiv.i-p21"></span>**1.** *I make known to you.* He commends
the Macedonians, but it is with the design of stimulating the
Corinthians by their example, although he does not expressly say so; for
the former had no need of commendation, but the latter had need of a
stimulus. And that he may stir up the Corinthians the more to emulation,
he ascribes it to the *grace of God* that the Macedonians had been so
forward to give help to their brethren. For although it is acknowledged
by all, that it is a commendable virtue to give help to the needy, they,
nevertheless, do not reckon it to be a gain, nor do they look upon it as
the *grace of God* Nay rather, they reckon, that it is so much of what
was theirs taken from them, and lost. Paul, on the other hand, declares,
that we ought to ascribe it to the grace of God, when we afford aid to
our brethren, and that it ought to be desired by us as a privilege of no
ordinary kind.

<span id="xiv.i-p22"></span>He makes mention, however, of a twofold
favor, that had been conferred upon the Macedonians. The *first* is,
that they had endured afflictions with composure and cheerfulness. The
*second* is, that from their slender means, equally as though they had
possessed abundance,  <span id="fr_659"></span>[660](#fn_659.md) they had
taken something — to be laid out upon their brethren. Each of these
things, Paul affirms with good reason, is a work of the Lord, for all
quickly fail, that are not upheld by the Spirit of God, who is the
Author of all consolation, and distrust clings to us, deeply rooted,
which keeps us back from all offices of love, until it is subdued by the
grace of the same Spirit.

<span id="xiv.i-p24"></span><span id="xiv.i-p24.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p25"></span>**2.** *In much trial* — In other words,
while they were tried with adversity, they, nevertheless, did not cease
to rejoice in the Lord: nay, this disposition rose so high, as to
swallow up sorrow; for the minds of the Macedonians, which must
otherwise have been straitened, required to be set free from their
restraints, that they might liberally  <span
id="fr_660"></span>[661](#fn_660.md) furnish aid to the brethren.

<span id="xiv.i-p27"></span>By the term *joy* he means that spiritual
consolation by which believers are sustained under their afflictions;
for the wicked either delude themselves with empty consolations, by
avoiding a perception of the evil, and drawing off the mind to rambling
thoughts, or else they wholly give way to grief, and allow themselves to
be overwhelmed with it. Believers, on the other hand, seek occasions of
*joy* in the affliction itself, as we see in the 8th chapter of the
Romans.  <span id="fr_661"></span>[662](#fn_661.md)

<span id="xiv.i-p29"></span>*And their deep poverty.* Here we have a
metaphor taken from exhausted vessels, as though he had said, that the
Macedonians had been emptied, so that they had now reached the bottom.
He says, that even in such straits they had abounded in liberality, and
had been rich, so as to have enough — not merely for their own use, but
also for giving assistance to others. Mark the way, in which we shall
always be liberal even in the most straitened poverty — if by liberality
of mind we make up for what is deficient in our coffers.

<span id="xiv.i-p30"></span>*Liberality* is opposed to niggardliness, as
in <span id="xiv.i-p30.1"></span>[Ro
12:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#008.md)<span id="xiv.i-p30.1"></span>,
where Paul requires this on the part of deacons. For what makes us more
close-handed than we ought to be is — when we look too carefully, and
too far forward, in contemplating the dangers that may occur — when we
are excessively cautious and careful — when we calculate too narrowly
what we will require during our whole life, or, in fine, how much we
lose when the smallest portion is taken away. The man, that depends upon
the blessing of the Lord, has his mind set free from these trammels, and
has, at the same time, his hands opened for beneficence. Let us now draw
an argument from the less to the greater. “Slender means, nay poverty,
did not prevent the Macedonians from doing good to their brethren: What
excuse, then, will the Corinthians have, if they keep back, while
opulent and affluent in comparison of them?”

<span id="xiv.i-p31"></span><span id="xiv.i-p31.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p32"></span>**3.** *To their power, and even beyond
their power.* When he says that they were *willing of themselves,* he
means that they were, of their own accord, so well prepared for the
duty, that they needed no exhortation. It was a great thing — to strive
up to the measure of their ability; and hence, to exert themselves
*beyond* their ability, showed a rare, and truly admirable excellence.
 <span id="fr_662"></span>[663](#fn_662.md) Now he speaks according to the
common custom of men, for the common rule of doing good is that which
Solomon prescribes, (<span id="xiv.i-p33.1"></span>[Pr
5:15](../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#015)<span id="xiv.i-p33.1"></span>.md) —

<span id="xiv.i-p34"></span>to drink water out of our own fountains, and
let the rivulets go past, that they may flow onwards to others.  <span
id="fr_663"></span>[664](#fn_663.md)

<span id="xiv.i-p36"></span>The Macedonians, on the other hand, making
no account of themselves, and almost losing sight of themselves,
concerned themselves rather as to providing for others.  <span
id="fr_664"></span>[665](#fn_664.md) In fine, those that are in straitened
circumstances are willing beyond their ability, if they lay out any
thing upon others from their slender means.

<span id="xiv.i-p38"></span><span id="xiv.i-p38.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p39"></span>**4.** *Beseeching us with much entreaty.*
He enlarges upon their promptitude, inasmuch as they did not only not
wait for any one to admonish them, but even *besought* those, by whom
they would have been admonished, had they not anticipated the desires of
all by their activity.  <span id="fr_665"></span>[666](#fn_665.md) We must
again repeat the comparison formerly made between the less and the
greater. “If the Macedonians, without needing to be besought, press
forward of their own accord, nay more, anticipate others by using
entreaties, how shameful a thing is it for the Corinthians to be
inactive, more especially after being admonished! If the Macedonians
lead the way before all, how shameful a thing is it for the Corinthians
not, at least, to imitate their example! But what are we to think, when,
not satisfied with *beseeching,* they added to their requests *earnest
entreaty,* and much of it too?” Now from this it appears, that they had
*besought,* not as a mere form, but in good earnest.

<span id="xiv.i-p41"></span>*That the favor and the fellowship.* The
term *favor* he has made use of, for the purpose of recommending alms,
though at the same time the word may be explained in different ways.
This interpretation, however, appears to me to be the more simple one;
because, as our heavenly Father freely bestows upon us all things, so we
ought to be imitators of his unmerited kindness in doing good, (<span
id="xiv.i-p41.1"></span>[Mt 5:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#045.md)<span
id="xiv.i-p41.1"></span>); or at least, because, in laying out our
resources, we are simply the dispensers of his *favor.* The *fellowship
of this ministry* consisted in his being a helper to the Macedonians in
this *ministry.* They contributed of their own, that it might be
*administered* to the saints. They wished, that Paul would take the
charge of collecting it.

<span id="xiv.i-p42"></span><span id="xiv.i-p42.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p43"></span>**5.** *And not as* He expected from them an
ordinary degree of willingness, such as any Christian should manifest;
but they went beyond his expectation, inasmuch as they not only had
their worldly substance in readiness, but were prepared to devote even
*themselves. They gave themselves,* says he, *first to God, then to us.*

<span id="xiv.i-p44"></span>It may be asked, whether their giving
themselves to God, and to Paul, were two different things. It is quite a
common thing, that when God charges or commands through means of any
one, he associates the person whom he employs as his minister, both in
authority to enjoin, and in the obedience that is rendered.

<span id="xiv.i-p45"></span>It seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to
us;

<span id="xiv.i-p46"></span>say the Apostles, (<span
id="xiv.i-p46.1"></span>[Ac 15:28](../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028.md)<span
id="xiv.i-p46.1"></span>,) while at the same time they merely, as
instruments, declared what had been revealed and enjoined by the Spirit.
Again,

<span id="xiv.i-p47"></span>The people believed the Lord and his servant
Moses,  
(<span id="xiv.i-p47.2"></span>[Ex
14:31](../../../bib/kjv/exo014.htm#031)<span id="xiv.i-p47.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="xiv.i-p48"></span>while at the same time Moses had nothing
apart from God. This, too, is what is meant by the clause that follows —
*by the will of God* For, as they were obedient to God, who had
committed themselves to his ministry, to be regulated by his counsel,
they were influenced by this consideration in listening to Paul, as
speaking from God’s mouth.

<span id="xiv.i-p49"></span><span id="xiv.i-p49.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p50"></span>**6.** *That we should exhort Titus.* Now
this is an exhortation that is of greater force, when they learn that
they are expressly summoned to duty.  <span
id="fr_666"></span>[667](#fn_666.md) Nor was it offensive to the
Macedonians, that he was desirous to have the Corinthians as partners in
beneficence. In the mean time an apology is made for Titus, that the
Corinthians may not think that he pressed too hard upon them, as if he
had not confidence in their good disposition. For he did that, from
having been entreated, and it was rather in the name of the Macedonians,
than in his own.

<span id="xiv.i-p52"></span><span id="xiv.i-p52.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.i-p53"></span>**7.** *But as* He had already been very
careful to avoid giving offense, inasmuch as he said, that Titus had
entreated them, not so much from his own inclination, as in
consideration of the charge given him by the Macedonians. Now, however,
he goes a step farther, by admonishing them, that they must not even
wait for the message of the Macedonians being communicated to them; and
that too, by commending their other virtues. “You ought not merely to
associate yourselves as partners with the Macedonians, who require that;
but surpass them in this respect, too, as you do in others.”

<span id="xiv.i-p54"></span>He makes a distinction between *utterance*
and *faith,* because it. is impossible that any one should have *faith,*
and that, too, in an eminent degree, without being at the same time much
exercised in the word of God. *Knowledge* I understand to mean,
*practice* and *skill,* or *prudence.* He makes mention of their *love*
to himself, that he may encourage them also from regard to himself
personally, and in the mean time he gives up, with a view to the public
advantage of the brethren, the personal affection with which they
regarded him.  <span id="fr_667"></span>[668](#fn_667.md) Now in this way
he lays a restraint upon himself in everything, that he may not seem to
accuse them when exhorting them.

<span id="xiv.ii"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p1"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p1.1"></span>[2 Corinthians
8:8-12](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008.md)<span id="xiv.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p2"></span>**8.** I speak not by commandment, but by
occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of
your love.

<span id="xiv.ii-p3"></span>**8.** Non secundum imperium loquor, sed per
aliorum sollicitudinem, et vestrae dilectionis sinceritatem approbans.

<span id="xiv.ii-p4"></span>**9.** For ye know the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became
poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.

<span id="xiv.ii-p5"></span>**9.** Nostis enim gratiam Domini nostri
Iesu Christi, quod propter vos pauper factus sit, quum esset dives: ut
vos illius paupertate ditesceretis.

<span id="xiv.ii-p6"></span>**10.** And herein I give *my* advice: for
this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but
also to be forward a year ago.

<span id="xiv.ii-p7"></span>**10.** Et consilium in hoc do: nam hoc
vobis conducit: qui quidem non solum facere, verum etiam velle coepistis
anno superiore.

<span id="xiv.ii-p8"></span>**11.** Now therefore perform the doing *of
it*; that as *there was* a readiness to will, so *there may be* a
performance also out of that which ye have.

<span id="xiv.ii-p9"></span>**11.** Nunc autem etiam illud quod facere
coepistis, perficite: ut quemadmodum voluntas prompta fuit, ita et
perficiatis ex eo quod suppetit.

<span id="xiv.ii-p10"></span>**12.** For if there be first a willing
mind, *it is* accepted according to that a man hath, *and* not according
to that he hath not.

<span id="xiv.ii-p11"></span>**12.** Etenim si iam adest animi
promptitudo, ea iuxta id quod quisque possidet, accepta est: non iuxta
id quod non possidet.

<span id="xiv.ii-p12"></span> 

<span id="xiv.ii-p13"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p14"></span>**8.** *I speak not according to
commandment* Again he qualifies his exhortation, by declaring that he
did not at all intend to compel them, as if he were imposing any
necessity upon them, for that is to *speak according to commandment,*
when we enjoin any thing definite, and peremptorily require that it
shall be done. Should any one ask — “Was it not lawful for him to
prescribe what he had by commandment of the Lord?” The answer is easy —
that God, it is true, everywhere charges us to help the necessities of
our brethren, but he nowhere specifies the sum;  <span
id="fr_668"></span>[669](#fn_668.md) that, after making a calculation, we
might divide between ourselves and the poor. He nowhere binds us to
circumstances of times, or persons, but calls us to take the rule of
love as our guide.

<span id="xiv.ii-p16"></span>At the same time, Paul does not here look
to what is lawful for him, or unlawful, but says, that he does not
*command* as if he reckoned that they required to be constrained by
*command* and requirement, as though they refused to do their duty,
unless shut up to it by necessity. He assigns, on the other hand, two
reasons why he, notwithstanding, stirs them up to duty: *first,* Because
the concern felt by him for the saints compels him to do so; and,
*secondly,* Because he is desirous, that the love of the Corinthians
should be made known to all. For I do not understand Paul to have been
desirous to be assured of their love, (as to which he had already
declared himself to be perfectly persuaded,)  <span
id="fr_669"></span>[670](#fn_669.md) but he rather wished that all should
have evidence of it. At the same time, the first clause in reference to
the anxiety of others, admits of two meanings — either that he felt an
anxiety as to the individuals, which did not allow him to be inactive,
or that, yielding to the entreaties of others, who had the matter at
heart, he spoke not so much from his own feeling, as at the suggestion
of others.

<span id="xiv.ii-p18"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p19"></span>**9.** *For ye know the grace.* Having made
mention of love, he adduces Christ as an all perfect and singular
pattern of it. “Though he was rich,” says he, “he resigned the
possession of all blessings, that he might enrich us by his poverty.” He
does not afterwards state for what purpose he makes mention of this, but
leaves it to be considered by them; for no one can but perceive, that we
are by this example stirred up to *beneficence,* that we may not spare
ourselves, when help is to be afforded to our brethren.

<span id="xiv.ii-p20"></span>Christ *was rich,* because he was God,
under whose power and authority all things are; and farther, even in our
human nature, which he put on, as the Apostle bears witness, (<span
id="xiv.ii-p20.1"></span>[Heb 1:2](../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#002.md)<span
id="xiv.ii-p20.1"></span>; <span id="xiv.ii-p20.2"></span>[Heb
2:8](../../../bib/kjv/heb002.htm#008)<span id="xiv.ii-p20.2"></span>,.md)
he was the *heir of all things,* inasmuch as he was placed by his Father
over all creatures, and all things were placed under his feet. He
nevertheless *became poor,* because he refrained from possessing, and
thus he gave up his right for a time. We see, what destitution and
penury as to all things awaited him immediately on his coming from his
mother’s womb. We hear what he says himself, (<span
id="xiv.ii-p20.3"></span>[Lu 9:58](../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#058.md)<span
id="xiv.ii-p20.3"></span>,)

<span id="xiv.ii-p21"></span>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the
air have nests: the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.

<span id="xiv.ii-p22"></span>Hence he has consecrated poverty in his own
person, that believers may no longer regard it with horror. By his
*poverty* he has *enriched* us all for this purpose — that we may not
feel it hard to take from our abundance what we may lay out upon our
brethren.

<span id="xiv.ii-p23"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p24"></span>**10.** *And in this I give my advice.* The
*advice* he places in contrast with the *commandment* of which he had
spoken a little before. (<span id="xiv.ii-p24.1"></span>[2Co
8:8](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#008)<span id="xiv.ii-p24.1"></span>..md)
“I merely point out what is expedient in the way of *advising* or
*admonishing.”* Now this *advantage* is not perceived by the judgment of
the flesh; for where is the man to be found, who is persuaded that it is
of *advantage* to deprive himself of something with the view of helping
others? It is, indeed, the saying of a heathen — “What you have given
away is the only riches that you will always have;  <span
id="fr_670"></span>[671](#fn_670.md) but the reason is, that whatever is
given to friends is placed beyond all risk.” The Lord, on the other
hand, would not have us influenced by the hope of a reward, or of any
remuneration in return, but, on the contrary, though men should be
ungrateful, so that we may seem to have lost what we have given away, he
would have us, not- withstanding, persevere in doing good. The
advantage, however, arises from this — that

<span id="xiv.ii-p29"></span>“He that giveth to the poor (as Solomon
says in <span id="xiv.ii-p29.1"></span>[Pr
19:17](../../../bib/kjv/pro019.htm#017)<span id="xiv.ii-p29.1"></span>.md)
lendeth to the Lord,”

<span id="xiv.ii-p30"></span>whose blessing, of itself, is to be
regarded as a hundredfold more precious than all the treasures of the
world. The word *useful,* however, is taken here to mean *honorable,* or
at least Paul measures what is *useful* by what is *honorable,* because
it would have been disgraceful to the Corinthians to draw back, or to
stop short in the middle of the course, when they had already advanced
so far. At the same time it would also have been *useless,* inasmuch as
everything that they had attempted to do would have come short of
acceptance in the sight of God.

<span id="xiv.ii-p31"></span>*Who had begun not only to do.* As *doing*
is more than *willing,* the expression may seem an improper one; but
*willing* here is not taken simply, (as we commonly say,) but conveys
the idea of spontaneous alacrity, that waits for no monitor. For there
are *three* gradations, so to speak, as to acting. *First*<span
id="xiv.ii-p31.1"></span>, we sometimes act unwillingly, but it is from
shame or fear. *Secondly,* we act willingly, but at the same time it is
from being either impelled, or induced from influence, apart from our
own minds. *Thirdly,* we act from the prompting of our own minds, when
we of our own accord set ourselves to do what is becoming. Such
*cheerfulness* of anticipation is better than the actual *performance*
of the deed.  <span id="fr_671"></span>[672](#fn_671.md)

<span id="xiv.ii-p33"></span><span id="xiv.ii-p33.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.ii-p34"></span>**11.** *Now what ye have begun to do.* It
is probable, that the ardor of the Corinthians had quickly cooled down:
otherwise they would, without any delay, have prosecuted their purpose.
The Apostle, however, as though no fault had as yet been committed,
gently admonishes them to complete, what had been well begun.

<span id="xiv.ii-p35"></span>When he adds — *from what you have,* he
anticipates an objection; for the flesh is always ingenious in finding
out subterfuges. Some plead that they have families, which it were
inhuman to neglect; others, on the ground that they cannot give much,
make use of this as a pretext for entire exemption. Could I give so
small a sum? All excuses of this nature Paul removes, when he commands
every one to contribute according to the measure of his ability. He
adds, also, the reason: that God looks to the heart — not to what is
given, for when he says, that readiness of mind is acceptable to God,
according to the individual’s ability, his meaning is this — “If from
slender resources you present some small sum, your disposition is not
less esteemed in the sight of God, than in the case of a rich man’s
giving a large sum *from his abundance.* (<span
id="xiv.ii-p35.1"></span>[Mr
12:44](../../../bib/kjv/mar012.htm#044)<span id="xiv.ii-p35.1"></span>..md)
For the disposition is not estimated according to what you have not,
that is, God does by no means require of thee, that thou coldest
contribute more than thy resources allow.” In this way none are excused;
for the rich, on the one hand, owe to God a larger offering, and the
poor, on the other hand, ought not to be ashamed of their slender
resources.

<span id="xiv.iii-p2"></span>**13.** For *I mean* not that other men be
eased, and ye burdened:

<span id="xiv.iii-p3"></span>**13.** Non enim ut aliis relaxatio sit,
vobis autem angustia: sed ut ex aequabilitate.

<span id="xiv.iii-p4"></span>**14.** But by an equality, *that* now at
this time your abundance *may be a supply* for their want, that their
abundance also may be *a supply* for your want: that there may be
equality:

<span id="xiv.iii-p5"></span>**14.** In praesenti tempore vestra copia
illorum succurrat inopiae: et illorum copia vestrae succurrat inopiae,
quo fiat aequabilitas.

<span id="xiv.iii-p6"></span>**15.** As it is written, He that *had
gathered* much had nothing over; and he that *had gathered* little had
no lack.

<span id="xiv.iii-p7"></span>**15.** Quemadmodum scriptum est (<span
id="xiv.iii-p7.1"></span>[Ex
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#018)<span id="xiv.iii-p7.1"></span>..md)
Qwui multum habebat, huic nihil superfluit: et qui paulum habebat, is
nihilominus habuit.

<span id="xiv.iii-p8"></span>**16.** But thanks *be* to God, which put
the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.

<span id="xiv.iii-p9"></span>**16.** Gratia autem Deo, qui dedit eandem
sollicitudinem pro vobis in corde Titi,

<span id="xiv.iii-p10"></span>**17.** For indeed he accepted the
exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.

<span id="xiv.iii-p11"></span>**17.** Qui exhortationem acceperit: quin
potius, quum esset diligentior, suapte sponte ad vos venerit.

<span id="xiv.iii-p12"></span> 

<span id="xiv.iii-p13"></span><span id="xiv.iii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p14"></span>**13.** *Not that others.* This is a
confirmation of the preceding statement — that a readiness of will is
well-pleasing to God alike in poverty and in wealth, inasmuch as God
does not mean that we should be reduced to straits, in order that others
may be at ease through our liberality. True, indeed, it is certain, that
we owe to God, not merely a part, but all that we are, and all that we
have, but in His kindness He spares us thus far, that He is satisfied
with that participation of which the Apostle here speaks, What he
teaches here you must understand to mean an abatement from the rigor of
law.  <span id="fr_672"></span>[673](#fn_672.md) In the mean time, it is
our part to stir ourselves up from time to time to liberality, because
we must not be so much afraid of going to excess in this department. The
danger is on the side of excessive niggardliness.

<span id="xiv.iii-p16"></span>This doctrine, however, is needful in
opposition to fanatics, who think that you have done nothing, unless you
have stripped yourself of every thing, so as to make every thing common;
 <span id="fr_673"></span>[674](#fn_673.md) and, certainly, they gain this
much by their frenzy, that no one can give alms with a quiet conscience.
Hence we must carefully observe Paul’s (<span
id="xiv.iii-p17.6"></span>ἐπιείκεια) *mildness,*  <span
id="fr_674"></span>[675](#fn_674.md) and moderation, in stating that our
alms are well-pleasing to God, when we relieve the necessity of our
brethren from our abundance — not in such a way that they are at ease,
and we are in want, but so that we may, from what belongs to us,
distribute, so far as our resources allow, and that with a cheerful
mind.  <span id="fr_675"></span>[676](#fn_675.md)

<span id="xiv.iii-p20"></span>*By an equality* *Equality* may be taken
in two senses, either as meaning a mutual compensation, when like is
given for like, or, as meaning a proper adjustment. I understand <span
id="xiv.iii-p20.2"></span>ἰσότητα simply as meaning — an *equality of
proportional right,*  <span id="fr_676"></span>[677](#fn_676.md) as
Aristotle terms it.  <span id="fr_677"></span>[678](#fn_677.md) In this
signification it is made use of, also, in <span
id="xiv.iii-p22.4"></span>[Col
4:1](../../../bib/kjv/col004.htm#001.md)<span id="xiv.iii-p22.4"></span>,
where he exhorts “masters to give to their servants what is *equal.*” He
certainly does not mean, that they should be equal in condition and
station, but by this term he expresses that humanity and clemency, and
kind treatment, which masters, in their turn, owe to their servants.
Thus the Lord recommends to us a proportion of this nature, that we may,
in so far as every one’s resources admit, afford help to the indigent,
that there may not be some in affluence, and others in indigence. Hence
he adds — at *the present time.* At that time, indeed, necessity pressed
upon them. Hence we are admonished that, in exercising beneficence, we
must provide for the present necessity, if we would observe the true
rule of equity.

<span id="xiv.iii-p23"></span><span id="xiv.iii-p23.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p24"></span>**14.** *And their abundance* It is
uncertain, what sort of *abundance* he means. Some interpret it as
meaning, that this had been the case, inasmuch as the Gospel had flowed
out to them from the Church at Jerusalem, from which source they had, in
their penury, been assisted by their spiritual riches. This, I think, is
foreign to Paul’s intention. It ought rather, in my opinion, to be
applied to the communion of saints, which means, that whatever duty is
discharged to one member, redounds to the advantage of the entire body.
“If it is irksome to you to help your brethren with riches that are of
no value, consider how many blessings you are destitute of, and these
too, far more precious, with which you may be enriched by those who are
poor as to worldly substance. This participation, which Christ has
established among the members of his body, should animate you to be more
forward, and more active in doing good.” The meaning may, also, be this.
“You now relieve them according to the necessity of the occasion, but
they will have an opportunity given them at another time of requiting
you.”  <span id="fr_678"></span>[679](#fn_678.md) I approve rather of the
other sentiment, which is of a more general nature, and with this
accords what he again repeats in reference to equality. For the system
of proportional right in the Church is this — that while they
communicate to each other mutually according to the measure of gifts and
of necessity, this mutual contribution produces a befitting symmetry,
though some have more, and some less, and gifts are distributed
unequally.  <span id="fr_679"></span>[680](#fn_679.md)

<span id="xiv.iii-p27"></span><span id="xiv.iii-p27.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p28"></span>**15.** *As it is written.* The passage,
that Paul quotes, refers to the manna, but let us hear what the Lord
says by Moses. He would have this to serve as a never-failing proof,
that men do not live by bread alone, but are Divinely supported, by the
secret influence of *His* will, who maintains and preserves all things
that he has created. Again, in another passage, (<span
id="xiv.iii-p28.1"></span>[De 8:3](../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003.md)<span
id="xiv.iii-p28.1"></span>,) Moses admonishes them, that they had been
nourished for a time with such food, that they might learn that men are
supported — not by their own industry or labor, but by the blessing of
God. Hence it appears, that in the manna, as in a mirror, there is
presented to us an emblem of the ordinary food that we partake of. Let
us now come to the passage that Paul quotes. When the manna had fallen,
they were commanded to gather it in heaps, so far as every one could,
though at the same time, as some are more active than others, there was
more gathered by some than was necessary for daily use,  <span
id="fr_680"></span>[681](#fn_680.md) yet no one took for his own private
use more than an homer,  <span id="fr_681"></span>[682](#fn_681.md) for
that was the measure that was prescribed by the Lord. This being the
case, all had as much as was sufficient, and no one was in want. This we
have in <span id="xiv.iii-p30.1"></span>[Ex
16:18](../../../bib/kjv/exo016.htm#018.md)<span id="xiv.iii-p30.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p31"></span>Let us now apply the history to Paul’s
object. The Lord has not prescribed to us an homer, or any other
measure, according to which the food of each day is to be regulated, but
he has enjoined upon us frugality and temperance, and has forbidden,
that any one should go to excess, taking advantage of his abundance. Let
those, then, that have riches, whether they have been left by
inheritance, or procured by industry and efforts, consider that their
abundance was not intended to be laid out in intemperance or excess, but
in relieving the necessities of the brethren. For whatever we have is
*manna,* from whatever quarter it comes, provided it be really *ours,*
inasmuch as riches acquired by fraud, and unlawful artifices, are
unworthy to be called so, but are rather *quails* sent forth by the
anger of God. (<span id="xiv.iii-p31.1"></span>[Nu
11:31](../../../bib/kjv/num011.htm#031.md)<span
id="xiv.iii-p31.1"></span>.) And as in the case of one hoarding the
manna, either from excessive greed or from distrust, what was laid up
immediately putrified, so we need not doubt that the riches, that are
heaped up at the expense of our brethren, are accursed, and will soon
perish, and that too, in connection with the ruin of the owner; so that
we are not to think that it is the way to increase, if, consulting our
own advantage for a long while to come, we defraud our poor brethren of
the beneficence that we owe them.  <span
id="fr_682"></span>[683](#fn_682.md) I acknowledge, indeed, that there is
not enjoined upon us an equality of such a kind, as to make it unlawful
for the rich to live in any degree of greater elegance than the poor;
but an equality is to be observed thus far — that no one is to be
allowed to starve, and no one is to hoard his abundance at the expense
of defrauding others. The poor man’s *homer*  <span
id="fr_683"></span>[684](#fn_683.md) will be coarse food and a spare diet;
the rich man’s *homer* will be a more abundant portion, it is true,
according to his circumstances, but at the same time in such a way that
they live temperately, and are not wanting to others.

<span id="xiv.iii-p34"></span><span id="xiv.iii-p34.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p35"></span>**16.** *But thanks be to God who hath
put.* That he may leave the Corinthians without excuse, he now at length
adds, that there had been provided for them active prompters, who would
attend to the matter. And, in the first place, he names Titus, who, he
says, had been divinely raised up. This was of great importance in the
case. For his embassy would be so much the more successful, if the
Corinthians recognized him as having come to them, from having been
stirred up to it by God. From this passage, however, as from innumerable
others, we infer that there are no pious affections that do not proceed
from the Spirit of God;  <span id="fr_684"></span>[685](#fn_684.md) and
farther, that this is an evidence of God’s concern for his people, that
he raises up ministers and guardians, to make it their endeavor to
relieve their necessities. But if the providence of God shows itself in
this manner, in providing the means of nourishment for the body, how
much greater care will he exercise as to the means of spiritual
nourishment, that his people may not be in want of them! Hence it is His
special and peculiar work to raise up pastors.  <span
id="fr_685"></span>[686](#fn_685.md)

<span id="xiv.iii-p38"></span><span id="xiv.iii-p38.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iii-p39"></span>*His receiving the exhortation* means that
he had undertaken this business,  <span
id="fr_686"></span>[687](#fn_686.md) from being exhorted to it by Paul. He
afterwards corrects this by saying, that Titus had not been so much
influenced by the advice of others, as he had felt stirred up of his own
accord, in accordance with his active disposition.

also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is

eiusdem Domini gloriam, et animi vestri promptitudinem:

<span id="xiv.iv-p7"></span>**20.** Avoiding this, that no man should
blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:

<span id="xiv.iv-p8"></span>**20.** Declinantes hoc, ne quis nos carpat
in hac exsuperantia, quae administratur a nobis.

<span id="xiv.iv-p9"></span>**21.** Providing for honest things, not
only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.

<span id="xiv.iv-p10"></span>**21.** Procurantes honesta, non tantum
coram Deo, sed etiam coram hominibus.

<span id="xiv.iv-p11"></span>**22.** And we have sent with them our
brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now
much more diligent, upon the great confidence which *I have* in you.

<span id="xiv.iv-p12"></span>**22.** Misimus autem una cum illis fratrem

<span id="xiv.iv-p13"></span>**23.** Whether *any do enquire* of Titus,
*he is* my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren *be
enquired of, they are* the messengers of the churches, *and* the glory

<span id="xiv.iv-p14"></span>**23.** Sive Titi nomine, qui socius meus
est, et erga vos adiutor, sive aliorum, qui fratres nostri sunt, et
Apostoli Ecclesiarum, gloria Christi.  <span
id="fr_688"></span>[689](#fn_688.md)

<span id="xiv.iv-p16"></span>**24.** Wherefore shew ye to them, and
before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your
behalf.

<span id="xiv.iv-p17"></span>**24.** Proinde documentum caritatis
vestrae et nostrae de vobis gloriationis erga eos ostendit et in
conspectu Ecclesiarum.

<span id="xiv.iv-p18"></span> 

<span id="xiv.iv-p19"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p19.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p20"></span>**18.** *We have sent with him the
brother.* The circumstance that *three* persons are sent, is an
evidence, that great expectations were entertained respecting the
Corinthians, and it became them to be so much the more attentive to
duty, that they might not disappoint the hopes of the Churches. It is
uncertain, however, who this *second* person was; only that some
conjecture that it was Luke, others that it was Barnabas. Chrysostom
prefers to consider it to have been Barnabas. I agree with him, because
it appears that, by the suffrages of the Churches,  <span
id="fr_689"></span>[690](#fn_689.md) he was associated with Paul as a
companion. As, however, it is almost universally agreed, that Luke was
one of those who were the bearers of this Epistle, I have no objection
that he be reckoned to be the *third* that is made mention of.

<span id="xiv.iv-p22"></span>Now the second person, whoever he may be,
he honors with a signal commendation, that he had conducted himself as
to the gospel in a praiseworthy manner, that is, he had earned applause
by promoting the gospel. For, although Barnabas gave place to Paul in
the department of *speaking,* yet in *acting* they both concurred. He
adds farther, that he had received praise, not from one individual, or
even from one Church merely, but from all the Churches. To this general
testimony he subjoins a particular one, that is suitable to the subject
in hand — that he had been chosen for this department by the concurrence
of the Churches. Now it was likely, that this honor would not have been
conferred upon him, had he not been long before known to be qualified
for it. We must observe, however, the mode of election — that which was
customary among the Greeks — <span id="xiv.iv-p22.1"></span>χειροτονία,
(*a show of hands*,)  <span id="fr_690"></span>[691](#fn_690.md) in which
the leaders  <span id="fr_691"></span>[692](#fn_691.md) took the precedence
by authority and counsel, and regulated the whole proceeding, while the
common people intimated their approval.  <span
id="fr_692"></span>[693](#fn_692.md)

<span id="xiv.iv-p26"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p26.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p27"></span>**19.** *Which is administered by us.* By
commending his ministry, he still farther encourages the Corinthians. He
says, that it tends to promote the glory of God, and their kindness of
disposition. Hence it comes, that these two things are conjoined — the
glory of God and their liberality, and that the *latter* cannot be given
up without the *former* being proportionally diminished. There is, in
addition to this, the labor of those distinguished men, which it were
very inconsistent to reject, or allow to pass unimproved.

<span id="xiv.iv-p28"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p28.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p29"></span>**20.** *Avoiding this,*  <span
id="fr_693"></span>[694](#fn_693.md) *that no one* Lest any one should
think, that the Churches had an unfavorable opinion of Paul, as if it
had been from distrusting his integrity that they had associated
partners with him, as persons that are suspected are wont to have guards
set over them, he declares that he had been the adviser of this measure,
with the view of providing against calumnies. Here some one will ask,
“Would any one have been so impudent, as to venture to defame with even
the slightest suspicion the man, whose fidelity must have been, in all
quarters, beyond every surmise?” I answer, Who is there that will be
exempt from Satan’s bite, when even Christ himself was not spared by
them? Behold, Christ is exposed to the reproaches  <span
id="fr_694"></span>[695](#fn_694.md) of the wicked, and shall his servants
be in safety? (<span id="xiv.iv-p31.2"></span>[Mt
10:25](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#025)<span id="xiv.iv-p31.2"></span>..md)
Nay rather, the more upright a person is, in that proportion does Satan
assail him by every kind of contrivance, if he can by any means shake
his credit, for there would arise from this a much greater occasion of
stumbling.  <span id="fr_695"></span>[696](#fn_695.md) Hence the higher the
station in which we are placed, we must so much the more carefully
imitate Paul’s circumspection and modesty. He was not so lifted up, as
not to be under control equally with any individual of the flock.  <span
id="fr_696"></span>[697](#fn_696.md) He was not so self-complacent, as to
think it beneath his station to provide against calumnies. Hence he
prudently shunned dangers, and used great care not to furnish any wicked
person with a handle against him. And, certainly, nothing is more apt to
give rise to unfavorable surmises, than the management of public money.

<span id="xiv.iv-p34"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p34.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p35"></span>**21.** *Providing things honest* I am of
opinion, that there were not wanting, even among the Corinthians, some
who would have proceeded so far as to revile, if occasion had been
allowed them. Hence he wished them to know the state of matters, that he
might shut the mouths of all everywhere. Accordingly he declares, that
he is not merely concerned to have a good conscience in the sight of
God, but also to have a good character among men. At the same time,
there can be no doubt, that he designed to instruct the Corinthians, as
well as all others, by his example, that, in doing what is right, the
opinion of men is not to be disregarded. The first thing,  <span
id="fr_697"></span>[698](#fn_697.md) it is true, is that the person take
care, that he be a good man. This is secured, not by mere outward
actions, but by an upright conscience. The next thing is, that the
persons, with whom you are conversant, recognize you as such.

<span id="xiv.iv-p37"></span>Here, however, the object in view must be
looked to. Nothing, assuredly, is worse than ambition, which vitiates
the best things in the world, disfigures, I say, the most graceful, and
makes sacrifices of the sweetest smell have an offensive odor before the
Lord. Hence this passage is slippery, so that care must be taken  <span
id="fr_698"></span>[699](#fn_698.md) lest one should pretend to be
desirous, in common with Paul, of a good reputation, and yet be very far
from having Paul’s disposition, for he *provided things honest in the
sight of men,* that no one might be stumbled by his example, but that,
on the contrary, all might be edified. Hence we must, if we would desire
to be like him, take care that we be not on our own account desirous of
a good name. “He that is regardless of fame,” says Augustine, “is cruel,
because it is not less necessary before our neighbor, than a good
conscience is before God.” This is true, provided you consult the
welfare of your brethren with a view to the glory of God, and in the
mean time are prepared to bear reproaches and ignominy in place of
commendation, if the Lord should see it meet. Let a Christian man,
however, always take care to frame his life with a view to the
edification of his neighbors, and diligently take heed, that the
ministers of Satan shall have no pretext for reviling, to the dishonor
of God and the offense of the good.

<span id="xiv.iv-p39"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p39.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p40"></span>**22.** *On account of the great
confidence.* The meaning is, “I am not afraid of their coming to you
proving vain and fruitless; for I have felt beforehand an assured
confidence, that their embassy will have a happy issue; I am so well
aware of their fidelity and diligence.” He says that the brother, whose
name he does not mention, had felt more eagerly inclined; partly because
he saw that he  <span id="fr_699"></span>[700](#fn_699.md) had a good
opinion of the Corinthians, partly because he had been encouraged by
Titus, and partly because he saw many distinguished men apply themselves
to the same business with united efforts. Hence one thing only remained
— that the Corinthians themselves should not be wanting on their part.
 <span id="fr_700"></span>[701](#fn_700.md)

<span id="xiv.iv-p43"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p43.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p44"></span>In calling them the *Apostles of the
Churches,* he might be understood in *two* senses — either as meaning
that they had been set apart by God as *Apostles to the Churches,* or
that they had been appointed by the Churches to undertake that office.
The *second* of these is the more suitable. They are called also the
*glory of Christ,* for this reason, that as he alone is the glory of
believers, so he ought also to be glorified by them in return. Hence,
all that excel in piety and holiness are the *glory of Christ,* because
they have nothing but by Christ’s gift.

<span id="xiv.iv-p45"></span><span id="xiv.iv-p45.1"></span>

<span id="xiv.iv-p46"></span>He mentions two things in the close: “See
that our brethren behold your love,” and secondly, “Take care, that it
be not in vain that I have boasted of you.” For <span
id="xiv.iv-p46.1"></span>αὐτούς (*to them*,) appears to me to be
equivalent to <span id="xiv.iv-p46.2"></span>*coram ipsis,* (*before
them,*) for this clause does not refer to the poor, but to the
messengers of whom mention had been made.  <span
id="fr_701"></span>[702](#fn_701.md) For he immediately afterwards
subjoins, that they would not be alone witnesses, but in consequence of
the report given by them, a report would go out even to distant
Churches.

and lawful use of a man’s estate, both for his own comfort and for the
good of others, or 2, of the honest use of matrimony.” “The latter
meaning,” he remarks, “better suits with the whole context, both
foregoing and following, and thus it is explained in the end of <span

id="xiv.ii-p25.1"></span>, (see p. 69,) but in the present instance he
takes occasion, most appropriately to his particular purpose, to notice
the connection in which the poet introduces it, which is as follows: —

<span id="xiv.ii-p26"></span>“<span id="xiv.ii-p26.1"></span>*Callidus
effracta nummos fur auferet arca;  
Prosternet patrios impia flamma Lares.  
Extra fortunam est, quicquid donatur amicis;  
Quas dederis, solas semper habebis opes* ”

<span id="xiv.ii-p27"></span>“The dexterous thief will break open your
chest, and carry off your money; a fire, raised by a base incendiary,
will lay in the dust your paternal mansion; but whatever has been given
to friends is placed beyond all risk. What you have given away is the
only wealth that you will always retain.” — MARTIAL, <span
id="xiv.ii-p27.1"></span>[Ephesians
5:39-42](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#039.md)<span
id="xiv.ii-p27.1"></span>.

<span id="xiv.ii-p28"></span>It is mentioned by *Dr. Bennett,* in his
Lectures on Christ’s Preaching, (p. 104,) that on the tomb of Robert of
Doncaster, there was the following inscription — “What I gave, I have;
what I kept I lost.” — *Ed.*

the Apostle, as unfaithful in the management of the collections.” —
