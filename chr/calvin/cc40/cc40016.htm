<p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p16"></A><a name="xvii.i-p16.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p17"></A><b>1.</b> <i>Would that ye did bear with me.</i> As he saw that the ears of the Corinthians were still in part pre-engaged,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_792"></A><A HREF="#fn_792"><FONT SIZE="1">793</FONT></A>
 			  he has recourse to another contrivance, for he turns to express a wish, as persons do when they do not venture openly to entreat.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_793"></A><A HREF="#fn_793"><FONT SIZE="1">794</FONT></A>
 			  Immediately afterwards, however, as if gathering confidence, he nevertheless entreats the Corinthians to bear with his<i> folly</i>. He gives the name of <i>folly</i> to that splendid proclamation of his praises, which afterwards follows. Not as if he were a fool in glorying; for he was constrained to it by necessity, 			 and besides, he restrained himself in such a manner, that no one could justly regard him as going beyond bounds; but as it is an unseemly thing to herald one&#8217;s own praises, and a thing that is foreign to the inclinations of a modest man, he speaks by way of concession.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p20"></A>What I have rendered in the imperative &#8212; <i>bear with me, </i>Chrysostom interprets as an affirmation, and certainly the Greek word is ambiguous, and either sense suits sufficiently well. As, however, the reasons that the Apostle subjoins are designed to induce the Corinthians to <i>bear with him, </i>and as we will find him afterwards expostulating with them again on the ground of their not conceding anything to him, I have followed the Old Interpreter.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_794"></A><A HREF="#fn_794"><FONT SIZE="1">795</FONT></A>
 			  By saying, <i>Would that, </i>etc., he had seemed to be distrustful; <i>now, </i>as if correcting that hesitation, he openly and freely commands.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p22"></A><a name="xvii.i-p22.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p23"></A><b>2.</b> <i>For I am jealous</i> Mark why it is that he acts the fool, for <i>jealousy</i> hurries a man as it were headlong. &#8220;Do not demand that I should show the equable temper   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_795"></A><A HREF="#fn_795"><FONT SIZE="1">796</FONT></A>
 			  of a man that is at ease, and not excited by any emotion, for that vehemence of vehemence of jealousy, with which I am inflamed towards you, does not suffer me to be at ease.&#8221; As, however, there are two kinds of jealousy &#8212; the one springs from self love, and of a wicked and perverse nature, while the other is cherished by us on God&#8217;s account,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_796"></A><A HREF="#fn_796"><FONT SIZE="1">797</FONT></A>
 			  he intimates of what sort his zeal is. For many are zealous &#8212; for themselves, not for God. <i>That</i> on the other hand, is the only pious and right zeal, that has an eye to God, that he may not be defrauded of the honors that of right belong to him.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p26"></A><i>For I have united you to one man.</i> That his zeal was of such a nature, he proves from the design of his preaching, for its tendency was to join them to Christ in marriage, and retain them in connection with him.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_797"></A><A HREF="#fn_797"><FONT SIZE="1">798</FONT></A>
 			  Here, however, he gives us in his own person a lively picture of a good minister; for One alone is the Bridegroom of the Church &#8212; the Son of God. All ministers are the <i>friends of the Bridegroom, </i>as the Baptist declares respecting himself. (<a name="xvii.i-p27.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#029">Joh 3:29</a><a name="xvii.i-p27.2"></A>.) Hence all ought to be concerned, that the fidelity of this 			 sacred marriage remain unimpaired and inviolable. This they cannot do, unless they are actuated by the dispositions of the Bridegroom, so that every one of them may be as much concerned for the purity of the Church, as a husband is for the chastity of his wife. Away then with coldness and indolence in this matter, for one that is cold   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_798"></A><A HREF="#fn_798"><FONT SIZE="1">799</FONT></A>
 			  will never be qualified for this office. Let them, however, in the mean time, take care, not to pursue their own interest rather than that of Christ, that they may not intrude themselves into his place, lest while they give themselves out as his <i>paranymphs,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_799"></A><A HREF="#fn_799"><FONT SIZE="1">800</FONT></A>
 			  they turn out to be in reality adulterers, by alluring the bride to love themselves.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p30"></A><i>To present you as a chaste virgin.</i> We are married to Christ, on no other condition than that we bring virginity as our dowry, and preserve it entire, so as to be free from all corruption. Hence it is the duty of ministers of the gospel to purify our souls, that they may be <i>chaste virgins to 			 Christ; </i>otherwise they accomplish nothing. Now we may understand it as meaning, that they individually present themselves as<i> chaste virgins to Christ,</i> or that the minister presents the whole of the people, and brings them forward into Christ&#8217;s presence. I approve rather of the second interpretation. Hence I have given a different rendering from Erasmus.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_800"></A><A HREF="#fn_800"><FONT SIZE="1">801</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p32"></A><a name="xvii.i-p32.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p33"></A><b>3.</b> <i>But I fear</i> He begins to explain, what is the nature of that <i>virginity </i>of which he has made mention &#8212; our cleaving to Christ alone, sincerely, with our whole heart. God, indeed, everywhere requires from us, that we be joined with him in body and in spirit, and he warns us 			 that he is a <i>jealous God, </i>(<a name="xvii.i-p33.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#005">Ex 20:5</a><a name="xvii.i-p33.1"></A>,) to avenge with the utmost severity the wrong done to him, in the event of any one&#8217;s drawing back from him. This connection, however, is accomplished in Christ, as Paul teaches in Ephesians, (<a name="xvii.i-p33.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#025">Eph. 5:25</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#027">27</a><a name="xvii.i-p33.2"></A>.) He points out, however, at present the means of it &#8212; when we remain in the pure simplicity of the gospel, for, as in contracting marriages among men, there are written contracts   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_801"></A><A HREF="#fn_801"><FONT SIZE="1">802</FONT></A>
 			  drawn out, so the spiritual connection between us and the Son of God is confirmed by the gospel, as a kind of written contract.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_802"></A><A HREF="#fn_802"><FONT SIZE="1">803</FONT></A>
 			  Let us maintain the fidelity, love, and obedience, that have been there promised by us; he will be faithful to us on his part.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p36"></A>Now Paul says that he is concerned, that the minds of the Corinthians may not be <i>corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ</i> Paul, it is true, says in Greek <a name="xvii.i-p36.1"></A>&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8057;&#957;<i>, </i>which Erasmus renders <i>towards Christ,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_803"></A><A HREF="#fn_803"><FONT SIZE="1">804</FONT></A>
 			  but the Old Interpreter has come nearer, in my opinion, to Paul&#8217;s intention,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_804"></A><A HREF="#fn_804"><FONT SIZE="1">805</FONT></A>
 			  because by the <i>simplicity that is in Christ</i> is meant, that which keeps us in the unadulterated and pure doctrine of the gospel, and admits of no foreign admixtures   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_805"></A><A HREF="#fn_805"><FONT SIZE="1">806</FONT></A>
 			  By this he intimates that men&#8217;s minds are <i>adulterated,</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_806"></A><A HREF="#fn_806"><FONT SIZE="1">807</FONT></A>
 			  whenever they turn aside, even in the least degree, to the one side or to the other, from the pure doctrine of Christ. Nor is it without good reason, for who would not condemn a matron as guilty of unchastity, so soon as she lends an ear to a seducer? So in like manner we, when we admit wicked and false teachers, who are Satan&#8217;s vile agents, show but too clearly, that we do not maintain conjugal fidelity towards Christ. We must also take 			 notice of the term <i>simplicity,</i> for Paul&#8217;s fear was not, lest the Corinthians should all at once openly draw back altogether from Christ, but lest, by turning aside, by little and little, from the simplicity which they had learned, so as to go after profane and foreign contrivances, they should at length become adulterated.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p41"></A>He brings forward a comparison <i>as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty</i> For if false teachers have a show of wisdom, if they have any power of eloquence for persuading, if they plausibly insinuate themselves into the minds of their hearers, and instill their poison by fawning artifices, it was in a similar way that Satan also <i>beguiled Eve, </i>as he did not openly 			 declare himself to be an enemy, but crept in privily under a specious pretext.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p42"></A><a name="xvii.i-p42.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p43"></A><b>4.</b> <i>For if he that cometh.</i> He now reproves the Corinthians for the excessive readiness, which they showed to receive the false apostles. For while they were towards Paul himself excessively morose and irritable,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_807"></A><A HREF="#fn_807"><FONT SIZE="1">808</FONT></A>
 			  so that on any, even the least occasion, they were offended if he gave them even the slightest reproof, there was, on the other hand, nothing that they did not bear with, on the part of the false Apostles. They willingly endured their pride, haughtiness, and unreasonableness. An absurd reverence of this nature he condemns, because in the mean time they showed no discrimination or judgment. &#8220;How is it that they 			 take   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_808"></A><A HREF="#fn_808"><FONT SIZE="1">809</FONT></A>
 			  so much liberty with you, and you submit patiently to their control? Had they brought you another Christ, or another gospel, or another Spirit, different from what you received through my hands, I would assuredly approve of your regard for them, for they would be deserving of such honor. But as they have conferred upon you nothing, that I had not given you previously, what sort of gratitude do you show in all but adoring those, to whom you are indebted for nothing, 			 while you despise me, through whom God has bestowed upon you so many and so distinguished benefits?&#8221; Such is the reverence that is shown even at this day by Papists towards their pretended Bishops. For while they are oppressed by their excessively harsh tyranny,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_809"></A><A HREF="#fn_809"><FONT SIZE="1">810</FONT></A>
 			  they submit to it without difficulty; but, at the same time, do not hesitate to treat Christ himself with contempt.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_810"></A><A HREF="#fn_810"><FONT SIZE="1">811</FONT></A>
</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p48"></A>The expressions &#8212; <i>another Christ, </i>and <i>another gospel, </i>are made use of here in a different sense from what they bear in <a name="xvii.i-p48.1"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#008">Ga 1:8</a><a name="xvii.i-p48.1"></A>. For <i>another</i> is used there in opposition to what is true and genuine, and hence it means <i>false </i>and <i>counterfeit. </i>Here, on the other hand, he means to say &#8212; &#8220;If the gospel had come to you through their ministry, and not through mine.&#8221;</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p49"></A><a name="xvii.i-p49.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p50"></A><b>5.</b> <i>For I reckon that I am.</i> He now convicts them of ingratitude, by removing the only thing that could serve as an excuse for them, for he shows that he is on a level, even with the chief of the Apostles. The Corinthians, therefore, were ungrateful   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_811"></A><A HREF="#fn_811"><FONT SIZE="1">812</FONT></A>
 			  in not esteeming him more highly, after having found him, by experience, to be such; while, on the other hand, the authority that was justly due to him, they transferred to persons of no value. For the sake of modesty, however, he says that he <i>reckons </i>so, while the thing was known and manifest to all. His meaning, however, is, that God had honored his Apostleship with no less distinguished marks of favor, than that 			 of John or Peter. Now the man that despises the gifts of God, which he himself recognizes, cannot clear himself from the charge of being spiteful and ungrateful. Hence, wherever you see the gifts of God, you must there reverence God himself:   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_812"></A><A HREF="#fn_812"><FONT SIZE="1">813</FONT></A>
 			  I mean, that every one is worthy of honor, in so far as he is distinguished by graces received from God, and especially if any advantage has redounded to thee from them.</p>  		  
<p class="Normal"><a name="xvii.i-p53"></A><a name="xvii.i-p53.1"></A></p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p54"></A><b>6.</b> <i>But though I am rude</i> There was one thing   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_813"></A><A HREF="#fn_813"><FONT SIZE="1">814</FONT></A>
 			  in which he might appear, at first view, to be inferior &#8212; that he was devoid of eloquence. This judgment,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_814"></A><A HREF="#fn_814"><FONT SIZE="1">815</FONT></A>
 			  therefore, he anticipates and corrects, while he <i>acknowledges </i>himself, indeed, to be <i>rude</i> and unpolished <i>in speech, </i>while at the same time he maintains that he has <i>knowledge</i>  By <i>speech</i> here he means, elegance of expression; and by <i>knowledge</i> he means, the very substance of doctrine. For as man has both a soul and a body, so also in doctrine, there is the thing itself that is taught, and the ornament of expression with 			 which it is clothed. Paul, therefore, maintains that he understands, what should be taught, and what is necessary to be known, though he is not an eloquent orator, so as to know how to set off his doctrine by a polished and eloquent manner of expression.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p57"></A>It is asked, however, whether elegance of <i>speech</i>   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_815"></A><A HREF="#fn_815"><FONT SIZE="1">816</FONT></A>
 			  is not also necessary for Apostles; for how will they otherwise be prepared for teaching? <i>Knowledge</i> might perhaps suffice for others, but how could a teacher be dumb? I answer, that, while Paul acknowledges himself to be <i>rude in speech, </i>it is not as though he were a mere infant, but as 			 meaning, that he was not distinguished by such splendid eloquence as others, to whom he yields the palm as to this, retaining for himself what was the principal thing &#8212; the reality itself,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_816"></A><A HREF="#fn_816"><FONT SIZE="1">817</FONT></A>
 			  while he leaves them talkativeness without gravity. If, however, any one should inquire, why it is that the Lord, <i>who made men&#8217;s tongues, </i>(<a name="xvii.i-p59.2"></A><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo004.htm#011">Ex 4:11</a><a name="xvii.i-p59.2"></A>,) did not also endow so eminent an apostle with eloquence, that nothing might be wanting to him, I answer, that he was furnished with a <i>sufficiency </i>for supplying the want of eloquence. For we see and feel, what majesty there is in his writings, what elevation appears in them, what a weight of meaning is couched under them, what power is discovered in them. In fine, they are thunderbolts, not mere words. Does not the efficacy of the Spirit appear more clearly in a naked rusticity of words, (so to speak,) than under the disguise of elegance and ornament? Of this matter, however, we have 			 treated more largely in the former Epistle.   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_817"></A><A HREF="#fn_817"><FONT SIZE="1">818</FONT></A>
 			  In short, he admits, as far as words are concerned, what his adversaries allege by way of objection, while he denies in reality what they hold forth. Let us also learn, from his example, to prefer deeds to words, and, to use a barbarous but common proverb &#8212; &#8220;<a name="xvii.i-p60.2"></A>Teneant alii quid <i>nominis, </i>nos autem quid <i>rei</i>;&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;Let others know something of the <i>name, </i>but let us know something of the <i>reality.</i>&#8221;   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_818"></A><A HREF="#fn_818"><FONT SIZE="1">819</FONT></A>
 			  If eloquence is superadded, let it be regarded by us as something over and above; and farther, let it not be made use of for disguising doctrine, or adulterating it, but for unfolding it in its genuine simplicity.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.i-p62"></A><i>But everywhere.</i> As there was something magnificent in placing himself on a level with the chief Apostles, that this may not be ascribed to arrogance, he makes the Corinthians judges, provided they judge from what they have themselves experienced; for they had known sufficiently well, from many proofs, that he did not boast needlessly, 			 or without good reason. He means, therefore, that he needs not make use of words, inasmuch as reality and experience afford clear evidence of every thing that he was about to say   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_819"></A><A HREF="#fn_819"><FONT SIZE="1">820</FONT></A>

 			  and so great an anxiety for their salvation, that he made a regard to himself a secondary consideration. Hence he says, that he had of his own accord made a surrender of his own greatness, that they might become great through his abasement. For his design was, that he might promote their salvation. He now indirectly charges them with ingratitude, in imputing to him as a fault so pious a disposition &#8212; not indeed for the purpose of reproaching him, but with the view 			 of restoring them so much the better to a sound mind. And certainly, he wounded them more severely by speaking <i>ironically, </i>than if he had spoken in a simple way, and without a figure. He might have said, &#8220;What is this? Am I despised by you, because I have lowered myself for your advantage?&#8221; The questioning, however, which he makes use of, was more forcible for putting them to shame.</p>  		  
<p><a name="xvii.ii-p20"></A><i>Because I preached freely</i> This is a part of his abasement. For he had given up his own right, as though his condition had been inferior to that of others; but such was the unreasonableness of some of them, that they esteemed him the less on that account, as if he had been undeserving of remuneration. The reason, why he had given his services to the Corinthians 			 gratuitously, is immediately subjoined &#8212; for he did not act in this manner everywhere, but, as we have seen in the former Epistle,   			 &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_823"></A><A HREF="#fn_823"><FONT SIZE="1">824</FONT></A>

Hence he always makes use of some cloak for the purpose of insnaring us, and does not immediately <i>show his horns, </i>(as the common expression is,) but rather makes it his endeavor to appear as an<i> 			 angel</i> Even when he tempts us to gross crimes, he makes use, nevertheless, of some pretext that he may draw us, when we are off our guard, into his nets.

 			  are to be found among the Jews, which make some restriction upon the permission that the Lord had given. Hence, perhaps, in process of time, (as things generally deteriorate,) they came to think, that all criminals should be beaten with stripes to that number, though the Lord did not prescribe, how far severity should go, but where it was to stop; unless perhaps you prefer to receive what is stated by others, that they exercised greater cruelty upon Paul. This is 			 not at all improbable, for if they had been accustomed ordinarily to practice this severity upon all, he might have said that he was beaten according to custom.

As, however, flight gives no evidence of a valiant spirit, it may be asked, why it is that he makes mention of his flight?

 			  for if Paul had not fought for Christ with a new and unusual activity, the wicked would never have been thrown into such a commotion.

For the law would not punish a man, that would throw 			 himself down from the walls to save his life from the flames; and what difference is there between a fire, and a fierce attack from robbers?
