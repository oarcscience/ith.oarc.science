<span id="iv-p1"></span>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.

<span id="iv-p2"></span>The Epistles Of Paul To The Corinthians contain
more of admonition and reproof than most of his other Epistles. While
The Church Of Corinth was more than ordinarily distinguished in respect
of spiritual gifts, it had fallen into corruptions and abuses, from
which the other Churches appear to have been, to a great extent, free.
There is, accordingly — as might be expected — in these Epistles, more
frequent reference to local evils, than in most of the other Epistles of
the New Testament. They are not, however, on that account the less
adapted for general utility. While the reproofs which they contain were
occasioned by the corrupt state of a particular Church, they will be
found to involve general principles of the highest importance to the
Church of Christ under all circumstances. The Epistles to the
Corinthians “have,” says Dr. Guyse, in his Preface to the *Second*
Epistle, “some advantages that are not to be met with in any other part
of the word of God, as they may be deemed the seat of divine directions,
relating to the spiritual privileges, rights, and powers, worship and
discipline of the Churches of Christ; to the purity of doctrines,
manners, and celebrations of Gospel ordinances; and to the unity, peace,
and order, mutual watch and care, and religious respect to faithful
pastors, that ought to be preserved among them.”

<span id="iv-p3"></span>As, in the perusal of the four Gospels, the
attentive reader can scarcely fail to observe, that many of the
instructive sayings of our blessed Lord, which are placed on record by
the Evangelists, arose naturally out of occurrences of an accidental
nature, — though taking place under the watchful superintendence of him

<span id="iv-p4"></span>without whom not even a sparrow falleth on the
ground,  
(<span id="iv-p4.2"></span>[Mt
10:29](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029)<span id="iv-p4.2"></span>,)

<span id="iv-p5"></span>— so we find a large portion of the invaluable
directions furnished in the Epistles of the New Testament for the
regulation of the Church in every subsequent age, presented
*incidentally* — as if suggested to the mind of the sacred writer by
corruptions of doctrine and practice, into which some particular Church
in the primitive age had been left to fall. While the unhappily corrupt
state of the Church of Corinth, as indicated in the two Epistles
addressed to it, tended to mar, in no inconsiderable degree, the
prosperity of the cause of Christ in that city, and was an occasion of
poignant grief to the mind of Paul, who felt the more solicitous for
their welfare from his sustaining to them the relationship — not simply
of an *instructor,* but of *a father,* (<span id="iv-p5.1"></span>[1Co
4:15](../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#015)<span id="iv-p5.1"></span>,) the
flagrant abuses which had crept in among them were, in the providence of
God, overruled for good to the Church of Christ generally, by giving
occasion for a fuller development than might otherwise have been
necessary, of some of the most important principles of practical
Christianity.

<span id="iv-p6"></span>The Epistles to the Church of Corinth are a
portion of Paul’s writings, which, as is justly observed by Dr.
Alexander, in his Preface to Billroth on the Corinthians, “occupies a
very important place in the sacred canon. Besides containing some <span
id="iv-p6.1"></span>*loca classica* upon several of the most essential
positions in doctrinal theology, such, for instance, as the deity of
Christ, the personality and agency of the Holy Spirit, the resurrection
of the body, etc., the two Epistles to the Corinthians may be regarded
as constituting the great code of practical ethics for the Christian
Church. In this respect they stand to the science of practical theology
in a relation analogous to that occupied by the Epistles to the Romans,
the Galatians, and the Hebrews, to the science of systematic divinity;
they contain the fullest development of those principles on which that
science must rest, and the practices which its rules are to authorize or
inculcate.”  <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184)

<span id="iv-p8"></span>What increases not a little the utility of
Paul’s Epistles to the Corinthian Church is the circumstance that the
*latter* Epistle was written by him a considerable time (about a year,
it is generally supposed) subsequently to the *former,* when opportunity
had been given for the Apostle’s receiving accounts as to the effect
produced upon the minds of the Corinthians by the faithful, though at
the same time affectionate counsels and admonitions, which he had
addressed to them in his *first* Epistle. The Apostle had been intensely
anxious as to the effect, which his former Epistle might produce on the
minds of the Corinthians. While his authority as an Apostle, and that
too in a Church which he had himself planted, was at stake, he was, we
may believe, chiefly concerned for the purity of doctrine and
discipline, as in danger of being seriously impaired by the corrupt
state of the Church of Corinth. With feelings of deep solicitude he left
Ephesus, where it is generally believed he wrote his *first* Epistle to
the Corinthian Church, and proceeded to Troas, a sea-port town on the
coast of the AEgean Sea, hoping to meet with Titus there on his return
from Corinth. Disappointed in this expectation, he went forward to
Macedonia, where he at length met with Titus, and received most
gratifying accounts as to the favorable reception, which his former
Epistle had met with from the Corinthians, and the salutary effect which
it had produced in remedying, to a great extent., the evils that he had
found occasion to censure.

<span id="iv-p9"></span>It must have afforded to the mind of the Apostle
no ordinary satisfaction to learn, that his admonitions and reproofs had
awakened in the minds of the Corinthians the most poignant grief in
reflecting on the unworthy part which they had acted — that they had
manifested unabated esteem and affection toward him as their spiritual
father — that they had, in accordance with his instructions, excluded
from their society a gross offender, whose unnatural crime they had too
long connived at; and farther, that the exercise of discipline in that
painful case had been most salutary in its effects upon the offender
himself, so that the Apostle, from what he had learned as to the
evidences of repentance, was now prepared to instruct the Corinthian
Christians to receive him back, without hesitation or delay, into their
fellowship. He had, also, the satisfaction of learning, that his
exhortations, in the close of his former Epistle, to liberality in
contributing for the relief of the “poor saints at Jerusalem,” had been
promptly and cheerfully responded to. While Paul’s *second* Epistle to
the Corinthians furnishes in these and other respects, express proofs of
the beneficial effects of his *former* Epistle, his entire silence in
the *latter* Epistle in reference to various evils unsparingly censured
by him in the *former,* gives reason to believe that, in connection with
these also, a more hopeful state of matters had begun to appear. Among
these we may notice their party contendings, their vexatious lawsuits,
their corrupt administration of the Sacred Supper, their disorderly
exercise of spiritual gifts, and, in fine, their erroneous views on the
important subject of the resurrection.

<span id="iv-p10"></span>Thus “the success” of the first Epistle to the
Corinthians, as is justly observed by Barnes, in the Introduction to his
Notes on that Epistle, “was all that Paul could desire. It had the
effect to repress their growing strifes, to restrain their disorders, to
produce true repentance, and to remove the person who had been guilty of
incest in the Church. The whole Church was deeply affected with his
reproofs, and engaged in hearty zeal in the work of reform. (<span
id="iv-p10.1"></span>[2Co 7:9-11](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#009)<span
id="iv-p10.1"></span>.) The authority of the Apostle was recognised, and
his Epistle read with fear and trembling. (<span
id="iv-p10.2"></span>[2Co 7:15](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#015)<span
id="iv-p10.2"></span>.) The act of discipline which he had required on
the incestuous person was inflicted by the whole Church. (<span
id="iv-p10.3"></span>[2Co 2:6](../../../bib/kjv/co2002.htm#006)<span
id="iv-p10.3"></span>.) The collection which he had desired, (<span
id="iv-p10.4"></span>[1Co 16:1-4](../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#001)<span
id="iv-p10.4"></span>,) and in regard to which he had boasted of their
liberality to others, and expressed the utmost confidence that it would
be liberal, (<span id="iv-p10.5"></span>[2 Cor.
9:2](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#002),
[3](../../../bib/kjv/co2009.htm#003)<span id="iv-p10.5"></span>,) was
taken up agreeably to his wishes, and their disposition on the subject
was such as to furnish the highest satisfaction to his mind. (<span
id="iv-p10.6"></span>[2 Cor. 7:13](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#014)<span id="iv-p10.6"></span>.) Of
the success of his letter, however, and of their disposition to take up
the collection, Paul was not apprised until he had gone into Macedonia,
where Titus came to him, and gave him information of the happy state of
things in the Church at Corinth. (<span id="iv-p10.7"></span>[2 Cor.
7:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#004),
[13](../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#013)<span id="iv-p10.7"></span>.) Never
was a letter more effectual than this was, and never was authority in
discipline exercised in a more happy and successful way.”

<span id="iv-p11"></span>At the same time, Paul’s *second* Epistle to
the Corinthian Church is of a mixed character, being designed in part to
rectify evils still existing among them, and to vindicate the Apostle
from injurious aspersions, thrown out against him by the false teachers.
In various parts of the Epistle, but more particularly toward the close,
he establishes his claims to apostolical authority.

<span id="iv-p12"></span>A succinct view of the general tenor and design
of this Epistle is given by Poole, in his Annotations, in the following
terms: — *“*The occasion of his” (Paul’s) “writing this second Epistle
seemeth to be partly the false teachers aspersing him:

<span id="iv-p13"></span>**1.** As an *inconstant man,* because he had
promised to come in person to Corinth, and was not yet come; the reason
of which he showeth, <span id="iv-p13.1"></span>[2Co
1:12-2:4](../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#012)<span id="iv-p13.1"></span>,
was not levity, but the troubles he met with in Asia, and his desire to
hear that they had first reformed the abuses he had taxed them for.

<span id="iv-p14"></span>**2.** As an *imperious man,* because of the
incestuous person against whom he had wrote; which charge he avoids, by
showing the necessity of his writing in that manner, and giving new
orders for the restoring him, upon the repentance he had showed.

<span id="iv-p15"></span>**3.** As a *proud* and *vain-glorious man.*

<span id="iv-p16"></span>**4.** As a *contemptible person* — *base in
his person,* as he expresseth it.

<span id="iv-p17"></span>The further occasions of his writing were — to
commend them for their kind reception of, and compliance with, the
precepts and admonitions of his former Epistle, and their kind reception
of Titus — as also to exhort them to a liberal contribution to the
necessities of the saints in Judea, to which they had showed their
forwardness a year before; and his hearing that there was yet a party
amongst them bad enough, that went on vilifying him and his authority,
as well as in other sinful courses; against whom he vindicateth himself,
magnifying his office, assuring them that he was about to come to
Corinth, when they should find him present, such as being absent he had
by his letters declared himself, if they were not reformed.

<span id="iv-p18"></span>“The substance, therefore, of this Epistle, is
partly *apologetical,* or *excusatory,* where he excuseth himself for
his not coming to Corinth so soon as he thought, and for his so severe
writing as to the incestuous person — partly *hortatory,* where he
persuadeth them *more generally* to walk worthy of the gospel; *more
specially* (<span id="iv-p18.1"></span>[2Co
8:9](../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009)<span id="iv-p18.1"></span>) to a
liberal contribution to the saints — partly *minatory* or *threatening,*
where he threateneth severity against those whom, when he came amongst
them, he should find contumacious and impenitent offenders. He concludes
the Epistle (as usually) with a salutation of them, pious exhortations
to them, and a prayer for them.”

<span id="iv-p19"></span>Calvin, it will be observed, dedicates his
Commentary on the *second* Epistle to the Corinthians to Melchior
Wolmar, a man of great celebrity, under whom Calvin acquired a knowledge
of the Greek language. “The academy of Bourges,” says Beza, in his Life
of Calvin, “had \[...\] acquired great celebrity through Andrew Alciat,
(undoubtedly the first lawyer of his age,) who had been invited to it
from Italy. Calvin thought right to study under him also. He accordingly
went thither, and on grounds both religious and literary, formed a
friendship with Melchior Wolmar, a German from Rothweil, and professor
of Greek. I have the greater pleasure in mentioning his name, because he
was my own teacher, and the only one I had from boyhood up to youth. His
learning, piety, and other virtues, together with his admirable
abilities as a teacher of youth, cannot be sufficiently praised. On his
suggestion, and with his assistance, Calvin learned Greek. The
recollection of the benefit which he thus received from Wolmar he
afterwards publicly testified, by dedicating to him his Commentary on
the First” (*Second*) “Epistle to the Corinthians.”  <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185)

<span id="iv-p21"></span>The circumstances connected with his attendance
on the instructions of that distinguished teacher are interesting, as
giving occasion to mark the leadings of providence in preparing Calvin
for the important work, which was afterwards assigned him in the Church
of Christ. His father had originally intended him for the ministry, and
procured for him a benefice in the cathedral church of Noyon, and
afterwards the rectory of Pont-Eveque, the birthplace of his father.

<span id="iv-p22"></span>Not long afterwards, however, his father
resolved to send him to study civil law, as a more likely means of
worldly preferment, while in the mean time Calvin, having been made
acquainted with the doctrines of the reformed faith by one of his own
relations, Peter Robert Olivet, had begun to feel dissatisfied with the
Romish Church, and had left off attendance on the public services of the
Church. With the view of devoting himself to the study of law, he
removed to Orleans, and placed himself under the tuition of Peter De
L’etoile, a French lawyer of great celebrity, and made in a short time
surprising progress, so that very frequently, in the absence of the
professors, he supplied their place, and was regarded as a teacher
rather than a pupil. He afterwards went to Bourges, with the view of
prosecuting the study of law under the celebrated Andrew Alciat. While
there he formed, as is stated in the foregoing extract from Beza’s Life
of Calvin, an intimate friendship with Melchior Wolmar, his instructor
in the Greek tongue. Having received intimation of the sudden death of
his father, he broke off abruptly the studies in which he was engaged,
and having returned to Noyon, his native town, he soon afterwards
devoted himself to other and higher pursuits. The study of civil law, to
which he had devoted himself for a time, in compliance with his father’s
wishes, though ultimately abandoned, was not without its use, in
connection with those sacred pursuits to which his subsequent life was
devoted. It may be interesting to the reader to observe unequivocal
evidences of this, as furnished in the following encomiums pronounced
upon Calvin by two eminent writers of sound and unbiassed judgment: —

<span id="iv-p23"></span>“A founder,” says Hooker, “it” (the
Presbyterian polity) “had, whom, for mine own part, I think incomparably
the wisest man that ever the French Church did enjoy, since the hour it
enjoyed him. *His bringing up was in the study of the civil law.* Divine
knowledge he gathered, not by hearing and reading, so much as by
teaching others. For, though thousands were debtors to him as touching
knowledge in that kind, yet he to none but only to God, the Author of
that most blessed fountain, the Book of Life, and of the admirable
dexterity of wit, together with the helps of other learning, which were
his guide.”  <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186) “Calvin,” says M.
D’alembert, “who with justice enjoyed a high reputation, was a scholar
of the first order. He wrote in Latin as well as is possible in a dead
language, and in French with a purity that was extraordinary for his
time. This purity, which is to the present day admired by our critics,
renders his writings greatly superior to almost all of the same age; as
the works of MM. de Port Royal are still distinguished on the same
account, from the barbarous rhapsodies of their opponents and
contemporaries. Calvin *being a skilful lawyer,* and as enlightened a
divine as a heretic can be, *drew up, in concert with the magistrates, a
code of laws,”* etc.  <span id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187)

<span id="iv-p26"></span>While Calvin’s large acquirements in the study
of civil law were thus eminently serviceable in other and higher
departments of labor, the other branch of study cultivated by him while
at Bourges — the knowledge of the Greek tongue — was more directly
fitted to prepare him, though he little thought of it at the time, for
the sacred pursuits in which Providence called him to engage, with
devotedness and success, in after years. Under the tuition of Wolmar, he
appears to have applied himself to the study of the Greek language with
the greatest diligence and ardour. “He did not indeed,” says Tholuck,
“learn Greek before his residence in Bourges, but he could not have been
then, at most, more than twenty-two years old; and it is not therefore
strange, that, with his resolute spirit, he made himself complete master
of it.”  <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188) His instructor in this
department, Melchior Wolmar, was a man of distinguished talent, and of
high moral worth. Beza, who, as we have seen, expresses in his Life of
Calvin, in the strongest terms, his esteem for Wolmar, his sole
instructor, has furnished in his <span id="iv-p27.1"></span>*Icones,*
(French edition,) entitled, “<span id="iv-p27.2"></span>Les vrais
Pourtraits des Hommes illustres,” (<span id="iv-p27.3"></span>à Génève
1581, pp. 148-51,) the following interesting sketch of the leading
particulars of the life of this distinguished man.

<span id="iv-p28"></span>“Melior Wolmar of Rotweil, Professor of Civil
Law, and of the Greek Language, in the University of Tübingen,
(originally called Melchior, but latterly Joachim Camerarius, a very
learned personage, and also Professor of Literature in Tübingen,
admiring the probity of Wolmar, softened the name and changed it thus,)
was born at Rotweil, which is an allied town of the Cantons, was brought
up at Berne, and studied at Paris, where he immediately became well
known for his admirable expertness in the Greek and Latin languages, as
also in the town of Orleans, and more particularly at Bourges, where,
being in the pay of Margaret Of Valois, Queen Of Navarre, and Duchess of
Berry, he read in Greek and in Latin, was admitted as teacher by the
advice of Andrew Alciat, the prince of lawyers in our times. Farther,
his house was frequented by men that were learned and fearers of God,
among whom must be numbered John Calvin, who had no hesitation in
placing himself under Wolmar, to learn from him the Greek language, he
having opened a school expressly for certain young men of good family
and of great hope, in which he succeeded so admirably, that there could
not have been found a man better qualified for the successful training
of youth, and there was no one who had educated in a proper manner so
large a number as he had done.

<span id="iv-p29"></span>“France would have reaped more fruits of
Melior’s industry, had not the persecutions that arose against the
Church of God, and respect for Ulrich, Duke Of Wittemberg, by whom he
was invited, drawn him away to Tübingen in the year 1535, when, having
read in law, and having interpreted Greek authors during upwards of
twenty years with great honor, he was at length permitted to resign.
Having retired, with his wife, named Margaret, to Isne, a town belonging
to that lady, he was attacked with paralysis, and at the end of some
months, he and his wife (overcome as she was with grief) died on the
same day — it being the will of God, that those whom a sacred friendship
had held bound during the space of twenty-seven years complete, should
be inclosed in the same tomb.

<span id="iv-p30"></span>“He was an accomplished personage in all the
gifts that are requisite for making a man accomplished. Above all he was
amazingly charitable to the poor, and at the same time so remote from
ambition, that, while he had the Greek and Latin languages at his
command, he put to the press nothing but an elegant preface,  <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189) introductory to the Grammar of
Demetrius Chalcondyles.

<span id="iv-p32"></span>“Having had in my childhood, as my preceptor,
so distinguished a personage, (revered by me, while he lived, as my own
father), I have bewailed his death, and that of his wife, in three Latin
Epigrams, now rendered into French. He died at Isne in the year 1561, at
the age of 64 years.

<span id="iv-p49"></span>Calvin’s Commentary On The Second Epistle To
The Corinthians appears to have been published by him only a few months
after his Commentary on the *First* Epistle, his dedication to his
Commentary on the *Second* Epistle bearing date 1st August 1546, while
his *first* dedication to the Commentary on the *First* Epistle bears
date 24th January 1546.

<span id="iv-p50"></span>In Senebier’s Literary History of Geneva,
quoted in Calvin on Genesis, (vol. 1.) a list of Calvin’s Commentaries
is given in the order in which they are supposed to have been published.
In that list the Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans is placed first
in order, and is stated to have been published in 1540. Next in order is
the “Commentary on all the Epistles of Paul,” which is stated to have
been published in 1548. It will be observed, however, that while the
Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans is supposed to have been
published in 1540, the *first* dedication to the Commentary on the
*First* Epistle to the Corinthians, and the dedication to the Commentary
on the *Second* Epistle, both of them bear date 1546. It is stated by
Beza in his Life of Calvin, that during the contentions which prevailed
in the Church in 1548, and some preceding years, Calvin was “not only
not idle, but, as if he had been living in retirement, wrote most
learned commentaries on six of Paul’s Epistles.”  <span
id="fr_192"></span>[193](#fn_192) The six Epistles referred to appear to
have been the two Epistles to the Corinthians, and the Epistles to the
Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians, Calvin’s Commentary
on the last four of these having been published, as appears from the
dedication prefixed to it, in 1548.

<span id="iv-p52"></span>What is chiefly of importance to be observed,
in connection with the respective dates of the Epistles above referred
to, is the circumstance noticed by Beza — that Calvin wrote his “most
learned Commentaries” on those Epistles “*as if he had been living in
retirement,*” while in reality amidst scenes, which would have
incapacitated any ordinary mind for such pursuits. In the careful study
of these interesting portions of the Volume of Inspiration, Calvin’s
devout mind found refreshment amidst scenes of turmoil; and we cannot
doubt, that while preparing, under circumstances like these, his
Commentaries on the Epistles to the Corinthians, and most of Paul’s
other Epistles, he had ample experience of what he himself so
beautifully expresses, when commenting on <span id="iv-p52.1"></span>[Ps
119:50](../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#050)<span id="iv-p52.1"></span>,

<span id="iv-p53"></span>This is my comfort in my affliction, for thy
word hath quickened me:

<span id="iv-p54"></span>“The Prophet... had good reason for stating,
that in the time of affliction the faithful experience animation and
vigour solely from the *word of God inspiring them with life.* Hence, if
we meditate carefully on his word, we shall live even in the midst of
death, nor will we meet with any sorrow so heavy for which it will not
furnish us with a remedy. And if we are bereft of consolation and
succour in our adversities, the blame must rest with ourselves; because,
despising or overlooking the word of God, we purposely deceive ourselves
with vain consolation.”  <span id="fr_193"></span>[194](#fn_193)

<span id="iv-p36"></span> There is here, obviously, a play upon words,
(common in that age,) founded on the coincidence between the names of
*Melior* and *Margaret* with *melior* (*Fr. meilleur*) *better*, and
*margarita* (*Fr. marguerite*) *a pearl.* — *Ed.*

<span id="iv-p37"></span> The original versions of the *first* and
*third* Epigrams are given in Beza’s “Poemata Varia,” (Genevae, 1614,)
p. 47, as follows: —

<span id="iv-p38"></span>“Melioris Volmarii, patria Rotvillensis, viri
spectatiss. tum pietatis, tum doctrinae, praeceptoris perpetua memoria
colendi, et Margaritae ipsius coniugis: uno eodemque die fato functorum,
et eodem tumulo conditorum, Memoriae;” — “To the memory of Melchior
Wolmar, a native of Rotweil, a man most highly esteemed at once for
piety and learning, an instructor to be ever kept in remembrance, and
Margaret, his spouse, who died on one and the same day, and were buried
in the same tomb”

<span id="iv-p39"></span>“<span id="iv-p39.1"></span>Coniugii exemplum
rarum, certumque beati  
Spectate cuncti coniuges:  
Una dies nobis Meliorem sustulit, una  
Et Margaritam sustulit:  
Sic uno quos vita thoro coniunxerat, uno  
Mors una tumulo condidit:  
Una ambos donec reddat lux unius olim  
Beatitatis compotes.”

<span id="iv-p40"></span>“<span id="iv-p40.1"></span>Quum tumulo lateat
Melior Volmarius isto,  
Cui Margarita adest comes,  
Est illi cur inuideas Mausole, diuque  
Celebrata Pyramidum strues,  
Namque nihil melius Meliore, nec India quidquam  
Fert Margarita carius.”

<span id="iv-p41"></span>In addition to the above, two Latin Epigrams by
Beza, in honor of Wolmar, are to be found in his “Poemata Varia:” —

<span id="iv-p42"></span>“<span id="iv-p42.1"></span>In Meliorem
Volmarum praeceptorem summe observandum, doctissime Homerum in Academia
Bituricensi interpretantem, anno Domini cloloXXXiv, quum ageret annum
Beza 15

<span id="iv-p43"></span>“<span id="iv-p43.1"></span>Flacce, tibi
quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus,  
Sed num propterea caecus Homerus erat?  
Immo oculis captus quinam credatur Homerus,  
Quem sequitur vaturn caetera turba ducem?  
Illius sed enim splendorem longa vetustas  
Obruerat densis, heu, nimium tenebris.  
Tu Melior, donec fato meliora renato  
Dux ipsi fieres, Volmare magne, duci.”

<span id="iv-p44"></span>BEZA’s “Poemata Varia,” p. 77.

<span id="iv-p45"></span>“<span id="iv-p45.1"></span>Meliori Volmaro
praeceptori, summe observando.

<span id="iv-p46"></span><span id="iv-p46.1"></span>Ergo placet nostros
iterum vulgare furores?  
Ergo semel non est desipuisse satis?  
Sic, Volmare, iubes: et ego tibi (quaeso) iubenti  
Quid tandem iusta cum ratione negem?

<span id="iv-p47"></span><span id="iv-p47.1"></span>Quid facerem? quae
nos tibi consecrauimus olim,  
Eripere haec eadem quo tibi iure queam?  
Adde, quod ipse tuus quum sit quoque muneris auctor  
Haec quum dona petis, tu tua dona petis.  
Fama igitur valeat, nos iam nil fama moratur  
Fas, tibi quo placeam, displicuisse mihi.”
