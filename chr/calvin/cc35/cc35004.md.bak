<span id="v-p1"></span>Chapter 15

<span id="v.i"></span>

<span id="v.i-p1"></span><span id="v.i-p1.1"></span>[John
15:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#001.md)<span id="v.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p2"></span>**1.** I am the true Vine, and my Father is the
Husbandman. **2.** Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he will
take away, and every branch that beareth fruit he will prune, that it
may bear more fruit. **3.** You are already clean, on account of the
word which I have spoken to you. **4.** Abide in me, and I in you. As
the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so
neither can you, unless you abide in me. **5.** I am the Vine, you are
the branches. He who abideth in me, and I in him, beareth much fruit;
for without me you can do nothing. **6.** If any one abide not in me, he
shall be cast out, and wither as a branch; and men shall gather it, and
cast it into the fire, and it shall be burned.

<span id="v.i-p3"></span> 

<span id="v.i-p4"></span><span id="v.i-p4.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p5"></span>**1.** *I am the true Vine.* The general
meaning of this comparison is, that we are, by nature, barren and dry,
except in so far as we have been engrafted into Christ, and draw from
him a power which is new, and which does not proceed from ourselves. I
have followed other commentators in rendering <span
id="v.i-p5.1"></span>ἄμπελος by *vitis*, (*a vine*,) and <span
id="v.i-p5.2"></span>κλήματα by *palmites*, (*branches*.) Now, *vitis*
(*a vine*) strictly denotes the plant itself, and not a field planted
with *vines*, which the Latin writers call *vinea*, (*a vineyard*;)
although it is sometimes taken for *vinea* a vineyard; as, for example,
when Cicero mentions in the same breath, *pauperum agellos et*
vlticulas, *the small fields and* small vineyards *of* *the poor*
*Palmites* (*branches*) are what may be called the *arms* of the tree,
which it sends out above the ground. But as the Greek word <span
id="v.i-p5.3"></span>κλὢμα sometimes denotes *a vine*, and <span
id="v.i-p5.4"></span>ἄμπελος, *a vineyard*, I am more disposed to adopt
the opinion, that Christ compares himself to a field planted with
*vines*, and compares us to the plants themselves. On that point,
however, I will not enter into a debate with any person; only I wish to
remind the reader, that he ought to adopt that view which appears to him
to derive greater probability from the context.

<span id="v.i-p6"></span>First, let him remember the rule which ought to
be observed in all parables; that we ought not to examine minutely every
property of *the vine*, but only to take a general view of the object to
which Christ applies that comparison. Now, there are three principal
parts; first, that we have no power of doing good but what comes from
himself; secondly, that we, having a root in him, are dressed and pruned
by the Father; thirdly, that he removes the unfruitful branches, that
they may be thrown into the fire and burned.

<span id="v.i-p7"></span>There is scarcely any one who is ashamed to
acknowledge that every thing good which he possesses comes from God;
but, after making this acknowledgment, they imagine that universal grace
has been given to them, as if it had been implanted in them by nature.
But Christ dwells principally on this, that the vital sap — that is, all
life and strength  <span id="fr_75"></span>[76](#fn_75.md) — proceeds from
himself alone. Hence it follows, that the nature of man is unfruitful
and destitute of everything good; because no man has the nature of a
*vine*, till he be implanted in him. But this is given to the elect
alone by special grace. So then, the Father is the first Author of all
blessings, who plants us with his hand; but the commencement of life is
in Christ, since we begin to take root in him. When he calls himself
*the* true *vine* the meaning is, *I am* truly *the* *vine*, and
therefore men toil to no purpose in seeking strength anywhere else, for
from none will useful fruit proceed but from *the branches* which shall
be produced by me.

<span id="v.i-p9"></span><span id="v.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p10"></span>**2.** *Every branch in me that beareth not
fruit* As some men corrupt the grace of God, others suppress it
maliciously, and others choke it by carelessness, Christ intends by
these words to awaken anxious inquiry, by declaring that all *the
branches* which shall be unfruitful will be cut off from *the vine* But
here comes a question. Can any one who is engrafted into Christ be
without fruit? I answer, many are supposed to be *in the vine*,
according to the opinion of men, who actually have no root *in the vine*
Thus, in the writings of the prophets, the Lord calls the people of
Israel *his vine*, because, by outward profession, they had the name of
The Church.

<span id="v.i-p11"></span>*And every branch that beareth, fruit he
pruneth.* By these words, he shows that believers need incessant culture
that they may be prevented from degenerating; and that they produce
nothing good, unless God continually apply his hand; for it will not be
enough to have been once made partakers of adoption, if God do not
continue the work of his grace in us. He speaks of pruning or
*cleansing*,  <span id="fr_76"></span>[77](#fn_76.md) because our flesh
abounds in superfluities and destructive vices, and is too fertile in
producing them, and because they grow and multiply without end, if we
are not *cleansed* or *pruned*  <span id="fr_77"></span>[78](#fn_77.md) by
the hand of God. When he says that vines are *pruned*, *that they may
yield more abundant fruit*, he shows what ought to be the progress of
believers in the course of true religion?  <span
id="fr_78"></span>[79](#fn_78.md)

<span id="v.i-p15"></span><span id="v.i-p15.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p16"></span>**3.** *You are already clean, on account of
the word.* He reminds them that they have *already* experienced in
themselves what he had said; that they have been planted in him, and
have also been *cleansed* or *pruned* He points out the means of
*pruning*, namely, doctrine; and there can be no doubt that he speaks of
outward preaching, for he expressly *mentions the word,* which they had
heard from his mouth. Not that *the word* proceeding from the mouth of a
man has so great efficacy, but, so far as Christ works in the heart by
the Spirit, *the word* itself is the instrument of *cleansing* Yet
Christ does not mean that the apostles are pure from all sin, but he
holds out to them their experience, that they may learn from it that the
continuance of grace is absolutely necessary. Besides, he commends to
them the doctrine of the gospel from the fruit which it produces, that
they may be more powerfully excited to meditate on it continually, since
it resembles the vine-dresser’s knife to take away what is useless.

<span id="v.i-p17"></span><span id="v.i-p17.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p18"></span>**4.** *Abide in me.* He again exhorts them to
be earnest and careful in keeping the grace which they had received, for
the carelessness of the flesh can never be sufficiently aroused. And,
indeed, Christ has no other object in view than to keep us

<span id="v.i-p19"></span>as a hen keepeth her chickens under her
wings,  
(<span id="v.i-p19.2"></span>[Mt
23:37](../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#037)<span id="v.i-p19.2"></span>.md)

<span id="v.i-p20"></span>lest our indifference should carry us away,
and make us fly to our destruction. In order to prove that he did not
begin the work of our salvation for the purpose of leaving it imperfect
in the middle of the course, he promises that his Spirit will always be
efficacious in us, if we do not prevent him. *Abide in me*, says he;
*for I am ready to abide in you* And again, *He who abideth in me
beareth much fruit.* By these words he declares that all who have a
living root in him are fruit-bearing *branches*

<span id="v.i-p21"></span><span id="v.i-p21.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p22"></span>**5.** Without me you can do nothing. This is
the conclusion and application of the whole parable. So long as we are
separate from him, we bear no fruit that is good and acceptable to God,
for we are unable to do anything good. The Papists not only extenuate
this statement, but destroy its substance, and, indeed, they altogether
evade it; for, though in words they acknowledge that we can do nothing
without Christ, yet they foolishly imagine that they possess some power,
which is not sufficient in itself, but, being aided by the grace of God,
co-operates (as they say,) that is, works along with it;  <span
id="fr_79"></span>[80](#fn_79.md) for they cannot endure that man should be
so much annihilated as to do nothing of himself. But these words of
Christ are too plain to be evaded so easily as they suppose. The
doctrine invented by the Papists is, that we can do nothing without
Christ, but that, aided by him, we have something of ourselves in
addition to his grace. But Christ, on the other hand, declares that we
can do nothing of ourselves. The branch, he says, beareth not fruit of
itself; and, therefore, he not only extols the aid of his co-operating
grace, but deprives us entirely of all power but what he imparts to us.
Accordingly, this phrase, *without me,* must be explained as meaning,
except from me.

<span id="v.i-p24"></span>Next follows another sophism; for they allege
that *the branch* has something from nature, for if another branch,
which is not fruit-bearing, be engrafted in the vine, it will produce
nothing. But this is easily answered; for Christ does not explain what
the branch has naturally, before it become united to the vine, but
rather means that we begin to become branches at the time when we are
united to him. And, indeed, Scripture elsewhere shows that, before we
are in him, we are dry and useless wood.

<span id="v.i-p25"></span><span id="v.i-p25.1"></span>

<span id="v.i-p26"></span>**6.** *If any one abide not in me.* He again
lays before them the punishment of ingratitude, and, by doing so,
excites and urges them to perseverance. It is indeed the gift of God,
but the exhortation to fear is not uncalled for, lest our flesh, through
too great indulgence, should root us out.

<span id="v.i-p27"></span>*He is cast out, and withered, like a branch.*
Those who are cut off from Christ are said to *wither* like a dead
branch; because, as the commencement of strength is from him, so also is
its uninterrupted continuance. Not that it ever happens that any one of
the elect is dried up, but because there are many hypocrites who, in
outward appearance, flourish and are green for a time, but who
afterwards, when they ought to yield fruit, show the very opposite of
that which the Lord expects and demands from his people.  <span
id="fr_80"></span>[81](#fn_80.md)

<span id="v.ii"></span>

<span id="v.ii-p1"></span><span id="v.ii-p1.1"></span>[John
15:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#007.md)<span id="v.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii-p2"></span>**7.** If you abide in me, and my words abide
in you, you shall ask what you will,  <span
id="fr_81"></span>[82](#fn_81.md) and it shall be done for you. **8.** In
this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and become my
disciples. **9.** As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you;
abide in my love. **10.** If you keep my commandments, you will abide in
my love, as I also have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his
love. **11.** These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may abide
in you, and that your joy may be full.

<span id="v.ii-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.ii-p5"></span><span id="v.ii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii-p6"></span>**7.** *If you abide in me.* Believers often
feel that they are starved, and are very far from that rich fatness
which is necessary for yielding abundant fruit. For this reason it is
expressly added, whatever those who are in Christ may need, there is a
remedy provided for their poverty, as soon as they ask it from God. This
is a very useful admonition; for the Lord often suffers us to hunger, in
order to train us to earnestness in prayer. But if we fly to him, we
shall never want what we ask, but, out of his inexhaustible abundance,
he will supply us with every thing that we need, (<span
id="v.ii-p6.1"></span>[1Co 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.ii-p6.1"></span>.)

<span id="v.ii-p7"></span>*If my words abide in you.* He means that we
take root in him by faith; for as soon as we have departed from the
doctrine of the Gospel, we seek Christ separately from himself. When he
promises that he will grant whatever we wish, he does not give us leave
to form wishes according to our own fancy. God would do what was ill
fitted to promote our welfare, if he were so indulgent and so ready to
yield to us; for we know well that men often indulge in foolish and
extravagant desires. But here he limits the wishes of his people to the
rule of praying in a right manner, and that rule subjects, to the good
pleasure of God, all our affections. This is confirmed by the connection
in which the words stand; for he means that his people *will* or
*desire* not riches, or honors, or any thing of that nature, which the
flesh foolishly desires, but the vital sap of the Holy Spirit, Which
enables them to bear fruit.

<span id="v.ii-p8"></span><span id="v.ii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii-p9"></span>**8.** *In this my Father is glorified* This
is a confirmation of the former statement; for he shows that we ought
not to doubt that God will listen to the prayers of his people, when
they desire to be rendered fruitful; for this contributes very greatly
to his glory. But by this end or effect he likewise kindles in them the
desire of doing good; for there is nothing which we ought to value more
highly than that the name of God may be glorified by us. To the same
effect is the latter clause, *that you may become my disciples;* for he
declares that he has no one in his flock who does not *bear fruit* to
the *glory* of God.

<span id="v.ii-p10"></span><span id="v.ii-p10.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii-p11"></span>**9.** *As the Father hath loved me.* He
intended to express something far greater than is commonly supposed; for
they who think that he now speaks of the sacred *love* of God the
Father, which he always had towards the Son, philosophize away from the
subject; for it was rather the design of Christ to lay, as it were, in
our bosom a sure pledge of God’s *love* towards us. That abstruse
inquiry, as to the manner in which the Father always *loved* himself in
the Son, has nothing to do with the present passage. But the *love*
which is here mentioned must be understood as referring to us, because
Christ testifies that *the Father loves* him, as he is the Head of the
Church. And this is highly necessary for us; for he who without a
Mediator, inquires how he is *loved* by God, involves him in a
labyrinth, in which he will neither discover the entrance, nor the means
of extricating himself. We ought therefore to cast our eyes on Christ,
in whom will be found the testimony and pledge of the love of God; for
the love of God was fully poured out on him, that from him it might flow
to his members. He is distinguished by this title, that he is *the
beloved Son*, in whom the will of the Father is satisfied, (<span
id="v.ii-p11.1"></span>[Mt 3:17](../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017.md)<span
id="v.ii-p11.1"></span>.) But we ought to observe the end, which is,
that God may accept us in him. So, then, we may contemplate in him, as
in a mirror, God’s paternal love towards us all; because he is not
*loved* apart, or for his own private advantage, but that he may unite
us with him to the Father.

<span id="v.ii-p12"></span>*Abide in my love.* Some explain this to
mean, that Christ demands from his disciples mutual *love;* but others
explain it better, who understand it to mean the *love* of Christ
towards us. He means that we should continually enjoy that love with
which he once loved us, and, therefore, that we ought to take care not
to deprive ourselves of it; for many reject the grace which is offered
to them, and many throw away what they once had in their hands. So,
then, since we have been once received into the grace of Christ, we must
see that we do not fall from it through our own fault.

<span id="v.ii-p13"></span>The conclusion which some draw from these
words, that there is no efficacy in the grace of God. unless it be aided
by our steadfastness, is frivolous. For I do not admit that the Spirit
demands from us no more than what is in our own power, but he shows us
what we ought to do, that, if our strength be deficient, we may seek it
from some other quarter. In like manner, when Christ exhorts us, in this
passage, to perseverance, we must; not rely on our own strength and
industry, but we ought to pray to him who commands us, that he would
confirm us in his love.

<span id="v.ii-p14"></span><span id="v.ii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii-p15"></span>**10.** *If you keep my commandments.* He
points out to us the method of perseverance. his, to follow where he
calls, for, as Paul says,

<span id="v.ii-p16"></span>They who are in Christ walk not according to
the flesh, but according to the Spirit,  
(<span id="v.ii-p16.2"></span>[Ro
8:1](../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#001)<span id="v.ii-p16.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.ii-p17"></span>For these two things are continually united,
that faith which perceives the undeserved love of Christ toward us, and
a good conscience and newness of life. And, indeed, Christ does not
reconcile believers to the Father, that they may indulge in wickedness
without reserve, and without punishment; but that, governing them by his
Spirit, he may keep them under the authority and dominion of his Father.
Hence it follows, that the love of Christ is rejected by those who do
not prove, by true obedience, that they are his disciples.

<span id="v.ii-p18"></span>If any one object that, in that case, the
security of our salvation depends on ourselves, I reply, it is wrong to
give such a meaning to Christ’s words; for the obedience which believers
render to him is not the cause why he continues his love toward us, but
is rather the effect of his love. For whence comes it that they answer
to their calling, but because they are led by the Spirit of adoption of
free grace?

<span id="v.ii-p19"></span>But again, it may be thought that the
condition imposed on us is too difficult, that we should *keep the
commandments* of Christ, which contain the absolute perfection of
righteousness, — a perfection which far exceeds our capacity, — for
hence it follows, that the love of Christ will be useless, if we be not
endued with angelical purity. The answer is easy; for when Christ speaks
of the desire of living a good and holy life, he does not exclude what
is the chief article in his doctrine, namely, that which alludes to
righteousness being freely imputed, in consequence of which, through a
free pardon, our duties are acceptable to God, which in themselves
deserved to be rejected as imperfect and unholy. Believers, therefore,
are reckoned as *keeping* *the commandments* of Christ when they apply
their earnest attention to them, though they be far distant from the
object at which they aim; for they are delivered from that rigorous
sentence of the law,

<span id="v.ii-p20"></span>Cursed be he that hath not confirmed all the
words of this law to do them,  
(<span id="v.ii-p20.2"></span>[De
27:26](../../../bib/kjv/deu027.htm#026)<span id="v.ii-p20.2"></span>.md).

<span id="v.ii-p21"></span>*As I also have kept my Father’s
commandments.* As we have been elected in Christ, so in him the image of
our calling is exhibited to us in a lively manner; and therefore he
justly holds himself out to us as a pattern, to the imitation of which
all the godly ought to be conformed. “In me,” says he, “is brightly
displayed the resemblance of those things which I demand from you; for
you see how sincerely I am devoted to obedience to *my Father*, and how
I persevere in this course. *My Father*, too, hath loved me, not for a
moment, or for a short time, but his love toward me is constant.” This
conformity between the Head and the members ought to be always placed
before our eyes, not only that believers may form themselves after the
example of Christ, but that, they may entertain a confident hope that
his Spirit will every day form them anew to be better and better, that
they may walk to the end in newness of life.

<span id="v.ii-p22"></span><span id="v.ii-p22.1"></span>

<span id="v.ii-p23"></span>**11.** *These things I have spoken to you.*
He adds, that his love is far from being unknown to the godly, but that
it is perceived by faith, so that they enjoy blessed peace of
conscience; for the *joy* which he mentions springs from that peace with
God which is possessed by all that have been justified by free grace. As
often, then, as God’s fatherly love towards us is preached, let us know
that there is given to us ground for true *joy*, that, with peaceable
consciences, we may be certain of our salvation.

<span id="v.ii-p24"></span>*My joy and your joy.* It is called
*Christ*’*s joy* and *our joy* in various respects. It is *Christ*’*s*,
because it is given to us by him; for he is both the Author and the
Cause of it. I say that he is the *Cause* of it, because we were freed
from guilt, when

<span id="v.ii-p25"></span>the chastisement of our peace was laid on
him, (<span id="v.ii-p25.1"></span>[Isa
53:5](../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005)<span id="v.ii-p25.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.ii-p26"></span>I call him also the Author of it, because by
his Spirit he drives away dread and anxiety in our hearts, and then
arises that calm cheerfulness. It is said to be *ours* for a different
reason; because we enjoy it since it has been given to us. Now since
Christ declares that *he spake these things*, *that the disciples might
have joy*, we conclude from these words, that all who have duly profited
by this sermon have something on which they can rest.

<span id="v.ii-p27"></span>*That my joy may abide in you.* By the word
*abide* he means, that it is not a fleeting or temporary *joy* of which
he speaks, but a *joy* which never fails or passes away. Let us
therefore learn that we ought to seek in the doctrine of Christ the
assurance of salvation, which retains its vigor both in life and in
death.

<span id="v.ii-p28"></span>*That your joy may be full.* He adds, that
this *joy* will be solid and *full;* not that believers will be entirely
free from all sadness, but that the ground for *joy* will be far
greater, so that no dread, no anxiety, no grief, will swallow them up;
for those to whom it has been given to glory in Christ will not be
prevented, either by life, or by death, or by any distresses, from
bidding defiance to sadness.

<span id="v.iii"></span>

<span id="v.iii-p1"></span><span id="v.iii-p1.1"></span>[John
15:12-15](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#012.md)<span id="v.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii-p2"></span>**12.** This is my commandment, that you love
one another, as I have loved you**. 13.** Greater love hath no one than
this, that one should lay down his life for his friends. **14.** You are
my friends, if you do the things that I command you.  <span
id="fr_82"></span>[83](#fn_82.md) **15.** Henceforth I will not call you
servants, for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth; but I have
called you friends, because I have made known to you all things that I
have heard from my Father.

<span id="v.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="v.iii-p5"></span><span id="v.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii-p6"></span>**12.** *This is my commandment.* Since it is
proper that we regulate our life according to the *commandment* of
Christ, it is necessary, first of all, that we should understand what it
is that he *wills* or *commands* He now therefore repeats what he had
formerly said, that it is his will, above all things, that believers
should cherish *mutual love* among themselves. True, the love and
reverence for God comes first in order, but as the true proof of it is
*love* toward our neighbors, he dwells chiefly on this point. Besides,
as he formerly held himself out for a pattern in maintaining the general
doctrine, so he now holds himself out for a pattern in a particular
instance; for he loved all his people, that they may love each other. Of
the reason why he lays down no express rule, in this passage, about
loving unbelievers, we have spoken under the former chapter.

<span id="v.iii-p7"></span><span id="v.iii-p7.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii-p8"></span>**13.** *Greater love hath no one than this.*
Christ sometimes proclaims the greatness of his love to us, that he may
more fully confirm our confidence in our salvation; but now he proceeds
further, in order to inflame us, by his example, to love the brethren.
Yet he joins both together; for he means that we should taste by faith
how inestimably delightful his goodness is, and next he allures us, in
this way, to cultivate brotherly love. Thus Paul writes:

<span id="v.iii-p9"></span>Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us,
and hath given himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God of a
sweet-smelling savor, (<span id="v.iii-p9.1"></span>[Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002)<span id="v.iii-p9.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iii-p10"></span>God might have redeemed us by a single word,
or by a mere act of his will, if he had not thought it better to do
otherwise for our own benefit, that, by not sparing his own well-beloved
Son, he might testify in his person how much he cares for our salvation.
But now our hearts, if they are not softened by the inestimable
sweetness of Divine love, must be harder than stone or iron.

<span id="v.iii-p11"></span>But a question is put. How did Christ die
for friends, since

<span id="v.iii-p12"></span>we were enemies, before he reconciled us,
(<span id="v.iii-p12.1"></span>[Ro
5:10](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010)<span id="v.iii-p12.1"></span>;.md)

<span id="v.iii-p13"></span>for, by expiating our sins through the
sacrifice of his death, he destroyed the enmity that was between God and
us? The answer to this question will be found under the third chapter,
where we said that, in reference to us, there is a state of variance
between us and God, till our sins are blotted out by the death of
Christ; but that the cause of this grace, which has been manifested in
Christ, was the  <span id="fr_83"></span>[84](#fn_83.md) In this way, too,
Christ laid down his life for those who were strangers, but whom, even
while they were strangers, he loved, otherwise he would not have died
for them.

<span id="v.iii-p15"></span><span id="v.iii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii-p16"></span>**14.** *You are my friends.* He does not
mean that we obtain so great an honor by our own merit, but only reminds
them of the condition on which he receives us into favor, and deigns to
reckon us among his friends; as he said a little before,

<span id="v.iii-p17"></span>If you keep my commandments, you will abide
in my love,  
(<span id="v.iii-p17.2"></span>[Joh
15:10](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#010)<span id="v.iii-p17.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iii-p18"></span>For the grace of God our Savior hath
appeared, teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we
should live soberly, and righteously, and piously, in this world,  
(<span id="v.iii-p18.2"></span>Titus 2:11.)

<span id="v.iii-p19"></span>But ungodly men, who, through wicked
contempt of the Gospel, want only oppose Christ, renounce his
friendship.

<span id="v.iii-p20"></span><span id="v.iii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="v.iii-p21"></span>**15.** *Henceforth I will not call you
servants.* By another argument he shows his love toward the disciples,
which was, that he opened his mind fully to them, as familiar
communication is maintained among *friends.* “I have condescended,” he
says, “far more to you than a mortal man is wont to condescend to his
*servants* Let this be regarded by you, therefore, as a pledge of my
love toward you, that I have, in a kind and friendly manner, explained
to you the secrets of heavenly wisdom which I had heard from the
Father.” It is indeed a noble commendation of the Gospel, that we have
the heart of Christ opened (so to speak) in it, so that we can no longer
doubt of it or perceive it slightly. We have no reason for desiring to
rise above the clouds, or to penetrate into the deep, (<span
id="v.iii-p21.1"></span>[Rom. 10:6](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#006.md),
[7](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#007)<span id="v.iii-p21.1"></span>.md) to
obtain the certainty of our salvation. Let us be satisfied with this
testimony of his love toward us which is contained in the Gospel, for it
will never deceive us. Moses said to the ancient people,

<span id="v.iii-p22"></span>What nation under heaven is so highly
favored as to have God near to them, as God talked, with you this day?  
(<span id="v.iii-p22.2"></span>[De
4:7](../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007)<span id="v.iii-p22.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iii-p23"></span>But far higher is the distinction which God
hath conferred on us, since God hath entirely conveyed himself to us in
his Son. So much the greater is the ingratitude and wickedness of those
who, not satisfied with the admirable wisdom of the Gospel, fly with
proud eagerness to new speculations.

<span id="v.iii-p24"></span>*All that I have heard from my Father.* It
is certain that the disciples did not know all that Christ knew, and
indeed it was impossible that they should attain to so great a height;
and because the wisdom of God is incomprehensible, he distributed to
each of them a certain measure of knowledge, according as he judged to
be necessary. Why then does he say that he revealed *all things*? I
answer, this is limited to the person and office of the Mediator. He
places himself between God and us, having received out of the secret
sanctuary of God those things which he should deliver to us — as the
phrase is — from hand to hand. Not one of those things, therefore, which
related to our salvation, and which it was of importance for us to know
was omitted by Christ in the instructions given to his disciples. Thus,
so far as he was appointed to be the Master and Teacher of the Church,
he heard nothing from the Father which he did not faithfully teach his
disciples. Let us only have an humble desire and readiness to learn, and
we shall feel that Paul has justly called the Gospel *wisdom to make men
perfect*, (<span id="v.iii-p24.1"></span>[Col
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#028)<span id="v.iii-p24.1"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iv-p2"></span>**16.** You have not chosen me, but I have
chosen you; and I have ordained you to go and bear fruit, and that your
fruit should continue; that whatever you shall ask from the Father in my
name he may give you. **17.** These things I command you, that you may
love another. **18.** If the world hate you, you know that it hated me
before it hated you. **19.** If you were of the world, the world would
love what was its own; but because you are not of the world, but I have
chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. **20.**
Remember the word which I said to you, The servant is not greater than
his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if
they have kept my word, they will keep yours also. **21.** But all these
things they will do to you on account of my name, because they know not
him who sent me.

<span id="v.iv-p3"></span> 

<span id="v.iv-p4"></span><span id="v.iv-p4.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p5"></span>**16.** *You have not chosen me.* He declares
still more clearly that it must not be ascribed to their own merit, but
to his grace, that they have arrived at so great an honor; for when he
says that *he was not chosen by them*, it is as if he had said, that
whatever they have they did not obtain by their own skill or industry.
Men commonly imagine some kind of concurrence to take place between the
grace of God and the will of man; but that contrast, *I chose you*, *I
was not chosen by you*, claims, exclusively, for Christ alone what is
usually divided between Christ and man; as if he had said, that a man is
not moved of his own accord to seek Christ, until he has been sought by
him.

<span id="v.iv-p6"></span>True, the subject now in hand is not the
ordinary *election* of believers, by which they are adopted to be the
children of God, but that special *election*, by which he set apart his
disciples to the office of preaching the Gospel. But if it was by free
gift, and not by their own merit, that they were *chosen* to the
apostolic office, much more is it certain that the *election*, by which,
from being the children of wrath and an accursed seed, we become the
children of God, is of free grace. Besides, in this passage Christ
magnifies his grace, by which they had been *chosen* to be Apostles, so
as to join with it that former election by which they had been engrafted
into the body of the Church; or rather, he includes in these words all
the dignity and honor which he had conferred on them. Yet I acknowledge
that Christ treats expressly of the apostleship; for his design is, to
excite the disciples to execute their office diligently and faithfully.
 <span id="fr_84"></span>[85](#fn_84.md)

<span id="v.iv-p8"></span>He takes, as the ground of his exhortation,
the undeserved favor which he had bestowed on them; for the greater our
obligations to the Lord, the more earnest ought we to be in performing
the duties which he demands from us; otherwise it will be impossible for
us to avoid the charge of base ingratitude. Hence it appears that there
is nothing which ought more powerfully to kindle in us the desire of a
holy and religious life, than when we acknowledge that we owe every
thing to God, and that we have nothing that is our own; that both the
commencement of our salvation, and all the parts which follow from it,
flow from his undeserved mercy. Besides, how true this statement of
Christ is, may be clearly perceived from the fact, that Christ *chose*
to be his apostles those who might have been thought to be the most
unfit of all for the office; though in their person he intended to
preserve an enduring monument of his grace. For, as Paul says, (<span
id="v.iv-p8.1"></span>[1Co 2:16](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#016.md)<span
id="v.iv-p8.1"></span>,) who among men shall be found fit for
discharging the embassy by which God reconciles mankind to himself? Or
rather, what mortal is able to represent the person of God? It is Christ
alone who makes them fit by his election. Thus Paul ascribes his
*apostleship* to *grace*, (<span id="v.iv-p8.2"></span>[Ro
1:5](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#005)<span id="v.iv-p8.2"></span>,.md) and
again mentions that

<span id="v.iv-p9"></span>he had been separated from his mother’s
womb,  
(<span id="v.iv-p9.2"></span>[Ga
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015)<span id="v.iv-p9.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iv-p10"></span>Nay more, since we are altogether useless
servants, those who appear to be the most excellent of all will not be
fit for the smallest calling, till they have been *chosen*. Yet the
higher the degree of honor to which any one has been raised, let him
remember that he is under the deeper obligations to God.

<span id="v.iv-p11"></span>*And I have appointed you.* The election is
hidden till it is actually made known, when a man receives an office to
which he had been appointed; as Paul, in the passage which I quoted a
little ago, where he says that *he had been separated from his
mother*’*s womb*, adds, that he was created an apostle, because *it so
pleased God* His words are:

<span id="v.iv-p12"></span>When it pleased God, who separated me from my
mother’s womb, and called me by his grace,  
(<span id="v.iv-p12.2"></span>[Ga
1:15](../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015)<span id="v.iv-p12.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.iv-p13"></span>Thus also the Lord testifies that he *knew*
Jeremiah *before he was in his mother*’*s womb*, (<span
id="v.iv-p13.1"></span>[Jer 1:5](../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005.md)<span
id="v.iv-p13.1"></span>,) though he calls him to the prophetical office
at the proper and appointed time. It may happen, no doubt, that one who
is duly qualified enters into the office of teaching; or rather, it
usually happens in the Church that no one is called till he be endued
and furnished with the necessary qualifications. That Christ declares
himself to be the Author of both is not wonderful; since it is only by
him that God acts, and he acts along with the Father. So then, both
election and ordination belong equally to both.

<span id="v.iv-p14"></span>*That you may go.* He now points out the
reason why he mentioned his grace. It was, to make them apply more
earnestly to the work. The apostleship was not a place of honor without
toil, but they had to contend with very great difficulties; and
therefore Christ encourages them not to shrink from labors, and
annoyances, and dangers. This argument is drawn from the end which they
ought to have in view; but Christ reasons from the effect, when he says,

<span id="v.iv-p15"></span>*That you may bear fruit;* for it is hardly
possible that any one would devote himself earnestly and diligently to
the work, if he did not expect that the labor would bring some
advantage. Christ, therefore, declares that their efforts will not be
useless or unsuccessful, provided that they are ready to obey and follow
when he calls them.  <span id="fr_85"></span>[86](#fn_85.md) For he not
only enjoins on the apostles what their calling involves and demands,
but promises to them also prosperity and success, that they may not be
cold or indifferent. It is hardly possible to tell how great is the
value of this consolation against those numerous temptations which daily
befall the ministers of Christ. Whenever, then, we see that we are
losing our pains, let us call to remembrance that Christ will, at
length, prevent our exertions from being vain or unproductive; for the
chief accomplishment of this promise is at the very time when there is
no appearance of *fruit.* Scorners, and those whom the world looks upon
as wise men, ridicule our attempts as foolish, and tell us that it is in
vain for us to attempt to mingle heaven and earth; because the *fruit*
does not yet correspond to our wishes. But since Christ, on the
contrary, has promised that the happy result, though concealed for a
time, will follow, let us labor diligently in the discharge of our duty
amidst the mockeries of the world.

<span id="v.iv-p17"></span>*And that your fruit may abide.* A question
now arises, why does Christ say that this *fruit* will be perpetual? As
the doctrine of the Gospel obtains souls to Christ for eternal
salvation, many think that this is the perpetuity of *the fruit* But I
extend the statement much farther, as meaning that the Church will last
to the very end of the world; for the labor of the apostles yields
*fruit* even in the present day, and our preaching is not for a single
age only, but will enlarge the Church, so that new *fruit* will be seen
to spring up after our death.

<span id="v.iv-p18"></span>When he says, *your fruit*, he speaks as if
it had been obtained by their own industry, though Paul teaches that
*they who plant or water are nothing*, (<span
id="v.iv-p18.1"></span>[1Co 3:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#007.md)<span
id="v.iv-p18.1"></span>.) And, indeed, the formation of the Church is so
excellent a work of God, that the glory of it ought not to be ascribed
to men. But as the Lord displays his power by the agency of men, that
they may not labor in vain, he is wont to transfer to them even that
which belongs peculiarly to himself. Yet let us remember that, when he
so graciously commends his disciples, it is to encourage, and not to
puff them up.

<span id="v.iv-p19"></span>*That your Father may give you all that you
ask in my name.* This clause was not added abruptly, as many might
suppose; for, since the office of teaching far exceeds the power of men,
there are added to it innumerable attacks of Satan, which never could be
warded off but by the power of God. That the apostles may not be
discouraged, Christ meets them with the most valuable aid; as if he had
said, “If the work assigned to you be so great that you are unable to
fulfill the duties of your office, my Father will not forsake you; for I
have appointed you to be ministers of the Gospel on this condition, that
my Father will have his hand stretched out to assist you, whenever you
pray to him, *in my name*, to grant you assistance.” And, indeed, that
the greater part of teachers either languish through indolence, or
utterly give way through despair, arises from nothing else than that
they are sluggish in the duty of prayer.

<span id="v.iv-p20"></span>This promise of Christ, therefore, arouses us
to call upon God; for whoever acknowledges that the success of his work
depends on God alone, will offer his labor to him with fear and
trembling. On the other hand, if any one, relying on his own industry,
disregard the assistance of God, he will either throw away his spear and
shield, when he comes to the trial, or he will be busily employed, but
without any advantage. Now, we must here guard against two faults, pride
and distrust; for, as the assistance of God is fearlessly disregarded by
those who think that the matter is already in their own power, so many
yield to difficulties, because they do not consider that they fight
through the power and protection of God, under whose banner they go
forth to war.

<span id="v.iv-p21"></span><span id="v.iv-p21.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p22"></span>**17.** *These things I command you.* This
too, was appropriately added, that the Apostles might know that mutual
love among ministers is demanded above all things, that they may be
employed, with one accord, in building up the Church of God; for there
is no greater hindrance than when every one labors apart, and when all
do not direct their exertions to the common good. If, then, ministers do
not maintain brotherly intercourse with each other, they may possibly
erect some large heaps, but latterly disjointed and confused; and, all
the while, there will be no building of a Church.

<span id="v.iv-p23"></span><span id="v.iv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p24"></span>**18.** *If the world hate you.* After having
armed the Apostles for the battle, Christ exhorts them likewise to
patience; for the Gospel cannot be published without instantly driving
the world to rage. Consequently, it will never be possible for godly
teachers to avoid the hatred of the world. Christ gives them early
information of this, that they may not be instances of what usually
happens to raw recruits, who, from wont of experience, are valiant
before they have seen their enemies, but who tremble as soon as the
battle is commenced. And not only does Christ forewarn his disciples,
that nothing may happen to them which is new and unexpected, but
likewise confirms them by his example; for it is not reasonable that
Christ should be *hated by the world*, and that we, who represent his
person, should have the world on our side, which is always like itself.

<span id="v.iv-p25"></span>*You know.* I have translated the verb <span
id="v.iv-p25.1"></span>γινώσκετε in the indicative mood, *you know*; but
if any one prefer to translate it in the imperative mood, *know ye*, I
have no objection, for it makes no change in the meaning. There is
greater difficulty in the phrase which immediately follows, <span
id="v.iv-p25.2"></span>πρῶτον ὑμῶν, *before you*; for when he says that
he is *before* the disciples, this may be referred either to *time* or
to *rank* The former exposition has been more generally received,
namely, that Christ *was hated by the world* before the Apostles were
*hated* But I prefer the second exposition, namely, that Christ, who is
far exalted above them, was not exempted from the hatred of the world,
and therefore his ministers ought not to refuse the same condition; for
the phraseology is the same as that which we have seen twice before, in
<span id="v.iv-p25.3"></span>[Joh
1:27](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#027.md)<span id="v.iv-p25.3"></span> and
30, *He who cometh after me is preferred to me*, (<span
id="v.iv-p25.4"></span>ὅτι πρῶτός μου ἦν,) *for he was before me*

<span id="v.iv-p26"></span><span id="v.iv-p26.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p27"></span>**19.** *If you were of the world.* This is
another consolation, that the reason why they are *hated by the world*
is, that they have been separated from it. Now, this is their true
happiness and glory, for in this manner they have been rescued from
destruction.

<span id="v.iv-p28"></span>*But I have chosen you out of the world. To
choose* means here *to separate* Now, if they were *chosen out of the
world*, it follows that they were a part *of the world*, and that it is
only by the mercy of God that they are distinguished from the rest who
perish. Again, by the term, *the world*, Christ describes, in this
passage, all who have not been regenerated by the Spirit of God; for he
contrasts the Church with *the world*, as we shall see more fully under
the seventeenth chapter. And yet this doctrine does not contradict the
exhortation of Paul,

<span id="v.iv-p29"></span>Be at peace with all men, as far as lieth in
you,  
(<span id="v.iv-p29.2"></span>[Ro
12:18](../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#018)<span id="v.iv-p29.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="v.iv-p30"></span>for the exception which he adds amounts to
saying, that we ought to see what is right and proper for us to do that
no man, by seeking to please *the world*, may give himself up to its
corruptions.

<span id="v.iv-p31"></span>But there is still another objection that may
be urged; for we see that it commonly happens that wicked men, who are
*of the world*, are not only *hated*, but accursed by others. In this
respect, certainly, *the world loveth* not *what is its own*. I reply,
earthly men, who are regulated by the perception of their flesh, never
have a true hatred of sin, but only so far as they are affected by the
consideration of their own convenience or injury. And yet the intention
of Christ was not to deny that *the world* foams and rages within itself
by internal quarrels. He only intended to show, *that the world hates*
nothing in believers but what is of God. And hence, too, it plainly
appears how foolish are the dreams of the Anabaptists, who conclude,
from this single argument that they are the servants of God, because
they displease the greater part of men. For it is easy to reply, that
many who are *of the world* favor their doctrine, because they are
delighted at the thought of having every thing in shameful confusion;
while many who are *out of the world* hate it, because they are desirous
that the good order of the state should remain unbroken.

<span id="v.iv-p32"></span><span id="v.iv-p32.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p33"></span>**20.** *Remember the word.* It might also be
read in the indicative mood, *You remember the word*, and the meaning is
not very different; but I think that it is more suitable to read it in
the imperative mood, *Remember the word.* It is a confirmation of what
Christ had spoken immediately before, when he said that he was hated by
the world, though he was far more excellent than his disciples; for it
is unreasonable that the condition of *the servant* should be better
than that of *his master* Having spoken of persons, he likewise makes
mention of doctrine.

<span id="v.iv-p34"></span>*If they have heard my word, they will keep
yours also.* Nothing gives greater uneasiness to the godly than when
they see the doctrine, which is of God, haughtily despised by men; for
it is truly shocking and dreadful, and the sight of it might shake the
stoutest heart. But when we remember on the other hand, that not less
obstinate resistance was manifested against the Son of God himself, we
need not wonder that the doctrine of God is so little reverenced among
men. When he calls it *his doctrine* and *their doctrine*, this refers
to the ministry. Christ is the only Teacher of the Church; but he
intended that *his doctrine*, of which he had been the first Teacher,
should be afterwards preached by the apostles.

<span id="v.iv-p35"></span><span id="v.iv-p35.1"></span>

<span id="v.iv-p36"></span>**21.** *But all these things they will do to
you.* As the fury of the world is monstrous, when it is so enraged
against the doctrine of its own salvation, Christ assigns the reason to
be, that it is hurried on by blind ignorance to its own destruction; for
no man would deliberately engage in battle against God. It is blindness
and ignorance of God, therefore, that hurries on the world, so that it
does not hesitate to make war with Christ. We ought, then, always to
observe the cause of this conduct, and the true consolation consists in
nothing else than the testimony of a good conscience. It should also
excite gratitude in our minds, that, while the world perishes in its
blindness, God hath given to us his light. Yet let it be understood that
hatred of Christ arises from stupidity of mind, when God is not known;
for, as I have often said, unbelief is blind; not that wicked men do not
understand or know anything, but because all the knowledge that they
have is confused, and quickly vanishes away. On this subject I have
elsewhere treated more largely.

<span id="v.v"></span>

<span id="v.v-p1"></span><span id="v.v-p1.1"></span>[John
15:22-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#022.md)<span id="v.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="v.v-p2"></span>**22.** If I had not come and spoken to them,
they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
**23.** He who hateth me hateth my Father also. **24.** If I had not
done among them the works which no other man did, they would not have
had sin; but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.
**25.** But that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their
law. They have hated me without a cause. **26.** But when the Comforter
is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth,
who proceedeth from the Father, will testify of me: **27.** And you also
will bear testimony, (or, are witnesses) because from the beginning you
are with me.

<span id="v.v-p3"></span> 

<span id="v.v-p4"></span><span id="v.v-p4.1"></span>

<span id="v.v-p5"></span>**22.** *If I had not come.* He had said that
the Jews regarded the Gospel with hatred, because they did not know God.
Lest any one should think that this tended to alleviate their guilt, he
adds, that it is through malice that they are blind, just as if one were
to shut his eyes, that he might not be compelled to see the light. For
otherwise it might have been brought as an objection against Christ. “If
they do not know thy Father, how comes it that thou dost not cure their
ignorance? Why didst thou not at least make trial whether they were
altogether incapable of being taught, or not?” He replies, that he has
performed the duty of a good and faithful Teacher, but without success,
because their malice would not suffer them to acquire soundness of mind.
In the person of those men he intended to strike terror into all who
reject the truth of God, when it is offered to them, or intentionally
fight against it, when it is known. And though a dreadful vengeance
awaits them, still Christ, in this passage, looks chiefly to his own
disciples, to animate them by the confident and well-grounded
expectation of victory, lest, at any time, they should yield to the
malice of wicked men; for when we learn that such will be the issue, we
may already triumph, as if we were in the midst of the battle.

<span id="v.v-p6"></span>*They would not have sin.* It may be thought
that Christ intended by these words to say, that there is no other sin
but unbelief; and there are some who think so. Augustine speaks more
soberly, but he approaches to that opinion; for, since faith forgives
and blots out all sins, he says, that the only sin that damns a man is
unbelief. This is true, for unbelief not only hinders men from being
delivered from the condemnation of death, but is the source and cause of
all evils. But the whole of that reasoning is inapplicable to the
present passage; for the word *sin* is not taken in a general sense, but
as related to the subject which is now under consideration; as if Christ
had said, that their ignorance is utterly inexcusable, because in his
person they maliciously rejected God; just as if we were to pronounce a
person to be innocent, just, and pure, when we wished merely to acquit
him of a single crime of which he had been accused. Christ’s acquittal
of them, therefore, is confined to one kind of *sin*, because it takes
away from the Jews every pretense of ignorance in this *sin*,  <span
id="fr_86"></span>[87](#fn_86.md) of despising and hating the Gospel.

<span id="v.v-p8"></span>But there is still another question that
arises: “Was not unbelief sufficient to condemn men before the coming of
Christ?” There are fanatics who reason inconclusively from this passage,
that all who died before the coming of Christ died without faith, and
remained in a state of doubt and suspense till Christ manifested himself
to them; as if there were not many passages of Scripture which testify
that their conscience alone was sufficient to condemn them. *Death*,
says Paul, *reigned in the world even to Moses*, (<span
id="v.v-p8.1"></span>[Ro 5:14](../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.v-p8.1"></span>.) And again he declares, that

<span id="v.v-p9"></span>they who have sinned without law shall perish
without law,  
(<span id="v.v-p9.2"></span>[Ro
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/rom002.htm#012)<span id="v.v-p9.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v-p10"></span>What, then, does Christ mean? There is
undoubtedly an admission made in these words, by which he means that the
Jews have nothing more to offer in extenuation of their guilt, since
they knowingly and willfully rejected the life which was offered to
them. Thus the excuse which he makes for them does not free them from
all blame, but only extenuates the heinousness of their crime, according
to that saying, *The* *servant*, *who knoweth the will of his master*,
*and despiseth it*, *shall be severely punished*?  <span
id="fr_87"></span>[88](#fn_87.md) For it was not the intention of Christ
here to promise pardon to any, but to hold his enemies convicted, who
had obstinately rejected the grace of God, that it might be fully
evident that they were unworthy of all pardon and mercy.

<span id="v.v-p14"></span>*If I had not come and SPOKEN TO THEM.* It
ought to be observed, that he does not speak of his coming, as viewed by
itself, but as connected with his doctrine, for they would not have been
held guilty of so great a crime on account of his bodily presence alone,
but the contempt of the doctrine made them utterly inexcusable.

<span id="v.v-p15"></span><span id="v.v-p15.1"></span>

<span id="v.v-p16"></span>**23.** *He who hateth me hateth my Father
also.* This is a remarkable passage, which teaches us that no man can
hate the doctrine of the Gospel without manifesting his impiety against
God. There are many, indeed, who profess differently in words; for,
though they abhor the Gospel, still they wish to be thought very good
servants of God; but it is false, for a contempt of God is concealed
within. In this manner Christ discovers the hypocrisy of many by the
light of his doctrine; and on this subject we have spoken more largely
under that passage,

<span id="v.v-p17"></span>Whosoever doeth what is evil hateth the light
 <span id="fr_88"></span>[89](#fn_88.md) (<span id="v.v-p18.2"></span>[Joh
3:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#020)<span id="v.v-p18.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="v.v-p19"></span>and under that passage,

<span id="v.v-p20"></span>He who honoureth not the Son honoureth not the
Father,  <span id="fr_89"></span>[90](#fn_89.md)  
(<span id="v.v-p21.3"></span>[Joh
5:23](../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#023)<span id="v.v-p21.3"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v-p22"></span><span id="v.v-p22.1"></span>

<span id="v.v-p23"></span>**24.** *If I had not done among them the
works* Under the word *works* he includes, in my opinion, all the proofs
which he gave of his Divine glory; for by miracles, and by the power of
the Holy Spirit, and by other demonstrations, he clearly proved that he
was the Son of God, so that in him was plainly seen the majesty *of the
Only-begotten Son*, as we have seen under <span
id="v.v-p23.1"></span>[Joh 1:14](../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014.md)<span
id="v.v-p23.1"></span>  <span id="fr_90"></span>[91](#fn_90.md) It is
commonly objected, that he did not perform more miracles or greater
miracles than Moses and the Prophets. The answer is well known, that
Christ is more eminent in miracles in this respect, that he was not
merely a minister, like the rest, but was strictly the Author of them;
for he employed his own name, his own authority, and his own power, in
performing miracles. But, as I have said, he includes in general all the
testimonies of heavenly and spiritual power by which his Divinity was
displayed.

<span id="v.v-p25"></span>*They have seen and hated.* He concludes that
his enemies cannot escape by any shifts to which they may have recourse,
since they despised his power, which evidently was altogether Divine;
for God had openly manifested his Divinity in the Son; and therefore it
would serve no purpose for them to say that they had only to do with a
mortal man. This passage reminds us to consider attentively the works of
God, in which, by displaying his power, he wishes us to render the honor
which is due to him. Hence it follows, that all who obscure the gifts of
God, or who contemptuously overlook them, are ungrateful to God, and
malicious.

<span id="v.v-p26"></span><span id="v.v-p26.1"></span>

<span id="v.v-p27"></span>**25.** *But that the word may be fulfilled.*
What is contrary to nature appears to be incredible. But nothing is more
contrary to reason than to hate God; and, therefore, Christ says that so
great was the malice with which their minds were envenomed, that *they
hated him without a cause* Christ quotes a passage from <span
id="v.v-p27.1"></span>[Ps 35:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa035.htm#019.md)<span
id="v.v-p27.1"></span>, which, he says, is now *fulfilled* Not that the
same thing did not happen, formerly, to David, but to reprove the
obstinate malice of the nation, which reigned perpetually from age to
age, being continued from grandfathers to grandchildren in unbroken
succession; as if he had said, that they were in no respect better than
their fathers, who *hated* David *without a cause.*

<span id="v.v-p28"></span>*Which is written in their Law.* By the word
*Law,* he means the Psalms; for the whole doctrine of the Prophets was
nothing else than an appendage to *the Law*; and we know that the
ministry of Moses lasted till the time of Christ. He calls it their
*Law*, not as an expression of respect for them, but to wound them more
deeply by a designation which was well known among them; as if he had
said, “They have *a Law* transmitted to them by hereditary right, in
which they see their morals painted to the life.”

<span id="v.v-p29"></span><span id="v.v-p29.1"></span>

<span id="v.v-p30"></span>**26.** *But when the Comforter is come.*
After having explained to the apostles that the Gospel ought not to be
less highly valued by them, because it has many adversaries, even within
the Church itself; Christ now, in opposition to the wicked fury of those
men, produces the testimony of the Spirit, and if their consciences rest
on this testimony, they will never be shaken; as if he had said, “True,
the world will rage against you; some will mock, and others will curse
your doctrine; but none of their attacks will be so violent as to shake
the firmness of your faith, when *the Holy Spirit* shall have been given
to you to establish you by his testimony.” And, indeed, when the world
rages on all sides, our only protection is, that the truth of God,
scaled by the Holy Spirit on our hearts, despises and defies all that is
in the world; for, if it were subject to the opinions of men, our faith
would be overwhelmed a hundred times in a day.

<span id="v.v-p31"></span>We ought, therefore, to observe carefully in
what manner we ought to remain firm among so many storms. It is because

<span id="v.v-p32"></span>we have received, not the spirit of the world,
but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things which have
been given to us by God,  
(<span id="v.v-p32.2"></span>[1Co
2:12](../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#012)<span id="v.v-p32.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v-p33"></span>This single witness powerfully drives away,
scatters, and overturns, all that the world rears up to obscure or crush
the truth of God. All who are endued with this Spirit are so far from
being in danger of falling into despondency on account of the hatred or
contempt of the world, that every one of them will obtain glorious
victory over the whole world. Yet we must beware of relying on the good
opinion of men; for so long as faith shall wonder in this manner, or
rather, as soon as it shall have gone out of the sanctuary of God, it
must become involved in miserable uncertainty. It must, therefore, be
brought back to the inward and secret testimony of the Spirit, which,
believers know, has been given to them from heaven.

<span id="v.v-p34"></span>The Spirit is said to *testify of Christ*,
because he retains and fixes our faith on him alone, that we may not
seek elsewhere any part of our salvation. He calls him also the
*Comforter*, that, relying on his protection, we may never be alarmed;
for by this title Christ intended to fortify our faith, that it may not
yield to any temptations. When he calls him *the Spirit of truth*, we
must apply the term to the matter in hand; for we must presuppose a
contrast to this effect, that, when they have not this Witness, men are
carried about in various ways, and have no firm resting-place, but,
wherever he speaks, he delivers the minds of men from all doubt and fear
of being deceived.

<span id="v.v-p35"></span>When he says that he *will send him from the
Father*, and, again, that *he proceedeth from the Father*, he does so in
order to increase the weight of his authority; for the testimony of *the
Spirit* would not be sufficient against attacks so powerful, and against
efforts so numerous and fierce, if we were not convinced that *he
proceedeth from God* So then it is Christ who sends the Spirit, but it
is from the heavenly glory, that we may know that it is not a gift of
men, but a sure pledge of Divine grace. Hence it appears how idle was
the subtlety of the Greeks, when they argued, on the ground of these
words, that the Spirit does not *proceed* from the Son; for here Christ,
according to his custom, mentions *the Father* in order to raise our
eyes to the contemplation of his Divinity.

<span id="v.v-p36"></span><span id="v.v-p36.1"></span>

<span id="v.v-p37"></span>**27.** *And you also bear testimony.* Christ
means that the testimony of *the Spirit* will not be of such a nature
that the apostles shall have it for their private advantage, or that
they alone shall enjoy it, but that by them it will be widely diffused,
because they will be organs of the Holy Spirit, as indeed, he spoke by
their mouth. We now see in what way *faith is by hearing*, (<span
id="v.v-p37.1"></span>[Ro 10:17](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#017.md)<span
id="v.v-p37.1"></span>,) and yet it derives its certainty from the
*seal* and *earnest of the Spirit*, (<span id="v.v-p37.2"></span>[Eph.
1:13](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#013.md),
[14](../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#014)<span id="v.v-p37.2"></span>..md)
Those who do not sufficiently know the darkness of the human mind
imagine that faith is formed naturally by hearing and preaching alone;
 <span id="fr_91"></span>[92](#fn_91.md) and there are many fanatics who
disdain the outward preaching, and talk in lofty terms about secret
revelations and inspirations, (<span
id="v.v-p38.2"></span>ἐνθουσιασμοὺς) But we see how Christ joins these
two things together; and, therefore, though there is no faith till the
Spirit of God seal our minds and hearts, still we must not go to seek
visions or oracles in the clouds; but the word,

<span id="v.v-p39"></span>which is near us, in our mouth and heart,  
(<span id="v.v-p39.2"></span>[Ro
10:8](../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#008)<span id="v.v-p39.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="v.v-p40"></span>must keep all our senses bound and fixed on
itself, as Isaiah says beautifully:

<span id="v.v-p41"></span>My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words
which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor
out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed
saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever,  
(<span id="v.v-p41.2"></span>[Isa
59:21](../../../bib/kjv/isa059.htm#021)<span id="v.v-p41.2"></span>..md)

<span id="v.v-p42"></span>*Because you are with me from the beginning.*
This clause was added in order to inform us that so much the greater
credit is due to the apostles on this ground, that they were
eye-witnesses of what they relate; as John says,

<span id="v.v-p43"></span>what we have heard, what we have seen,  
what our hands have handled, we declare to you;  
(<span id="v.v-p43.3"></span>[1Jo
1:1](../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#001)<span id="v.v-p43.3"></span>.md)

<span id="v.v-p44"></span>for thus the Lord intended to provide for our
welfare in every possible way, that nothing might be wanting for a full
confirmation of the Gospel.
