<span id="ix-p1"></span>CHAPTER 19.

<span id="ix.i"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p1"></span><span id="ix.i-p1.1"></span>[John
19:1-6](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#001.md)<span id="ix.i-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p2"></span>**1.** Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and
scourged him. **2.** And the soldiers, platting a crown of thorns, put
it on his head, and put on him a purple robe, **3.** And said, Hail,
King of the Jews! and struck him with the palms of their hands. **4.**
Pilate therefore went out again, and said to them, Behold, I bring him
out to you, that you may know that I find no guilt in him. **5.** Jesus
then went out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Then he
said to them,  <span id="fr_155"></span>[156](#fn_155.md) Behold the man!
**6.** When therefore the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried
out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Take you
him, and crucify him; for I find no guilt in him.

<span id="ix.i-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.i-p5"></span><span id="ix.i-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p6"></span>**1.** *Then Pilate therefore took Jesus.*
Pilate adheres to his original intention; but to the former ignominy he
adds a second, hoping that, when Christ shall have been scourged, the
Jews will be satisfied with this light chastisement. When he labors so
earnestly, and without any success, we ought to recognize in this the
decree of Heaven, by which Christ was appointed to death. Yet his
innocence is frequently attested by the testimony of the judge, in order
to assure us that he was free from all sin, and that he was substituted
as a guilty person in the room of others, and bore the punishment due to
the sins of others. We see also in Pilate a remarkable example of a
trembling conscience. He acquits Christ with his mouth, and acknowledges
that *there is no guilt in him,* and yet inflicts punishment on him, as
if he were guilty. Thus, they who have not so much courage as to defend,
with unshaken constancy, what is right, must be driven hither and
thither, and led to adopt opposite and conflicting opinions.

<span id="ix.i-p7"></span>We all condemn *Pilate;* and yet, it is
shameful to relate that there are so many *Pilates*  <span
id="fr_156"></span>[157](#fn_156.md) in the world, who *scourge Christ,*
not only in his members, but also in his doctrine. There are many who,
for the purpose of saving the life of those who are persecuted for the
sake of the Gospel, constrain them wickedly to deny Christ. What is
this, but to expose Christ to ridicule, that he may lead a dishonorable
life? Others select and approve of certain parts of the Gospel, and yet
tear the whole Gospel to pieces. They think that they have done
exceedingly well, if they have corrected a few gross abuses. It would be
better that the doctrine should be buried for a time, than that it
should be *scourged* in this manner, for it would spring up again ill
spite of the devil and of tyrants; but nothing is more difficult than to
restore it to its purity after having been once corrupted.

<span id="ix.i-p9"></span><span id="ix.i-p9.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p10"></span>**2.** *And the soldiers, platting a crown of
thorns.* This was unquestionably done by the authority of Pilate, in
order to affix a mark of infamy on the Son of God, for having *made
himself a king;* and that in order to satisfy the rage of the Jews, as
if he had been convinced that the accusations which they brought against
Christ were well founded. Yet the wickedness and insolence of the
soldiers is indulged more freely than had been ordered by the judge; as
ungodly men eagerly seize on the opportunity of doing evil whenever it
is offered to them. But we see here the amazing cruelty of the Jewish
nation,  <span id="fr_157"></span>[158](#fn_157.md) whose minds are not
moved to compassion by so piteous a spectacle; but all this is directed
by God, in order to reconcile the world to himself by the death of his
Son.

<span id="ix.i-p12"></span><span id="ix.i-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ix.i-p13"></span>**6.** *Take you him.* He did not wish to
deliver Christ into their hands, or to abandon him to their fury; only
he declares that he will not be their executioner. This is evident from
the reason immediately added, when he says that *he finds no guilt in
him;* as if he had said, that he will never be persuaded to shed
innocent blood for their gratification. That it is only the priests and
officers who demand that he shall be crucified, is evident from the
circumstance that the madness of the people was not so great, except so
far as those bellows contributed afterwards to kindle it.

<span id="ix.ii"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p1"></span><span id="ix.ii-p1.1"></span>[John
19:7-11](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#007.md)<span id="ix.ii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p2"></span>**7.** The Jews answered him, We have a law,
and according to our law he ought to die, because he made himself the
Son of God. **8.** When therefore Pilate heard this saying, he was the
more afraid; **9.** And went again into the hall, and said to Jesus,
Whence art thou? And Jesus gave him no answer. **10.** Then Pilate said
to him, Speakest thou not to me? Knowest thou not that I have power to
crucify thee, and have power to release thee? **11.** Jesus answered,
Thou wouldest have no power against me, unless it were given to thee
from above; therefore he who hath delivered me to thee hath the greater
sin.

<span id="ix.ii-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.ii-p4"></span><span id="ix.ii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p5"></span>**7.** *We have a law.* They mean that, in
proceeding against Christ, they do what is right, and are not actuated
by hatred or sinful passion; for they perceived that Pilate had
indirectly reproved them. Now, they speak as in the presence of a man
who was ignorant of *the law;* as if they had said, “We are permitted to
live after our own manner, and our religion does not suffer any man to
boast of being *the Son of God.*” Besides, this accusation was not
altogether void of plausibility, but they erred grievously in the
application of it. The general doctrine was undoubtedly true, that it
was not lawful for men to assume any honor which is due to God, and that
they who claimed for themselves what is peculiar to God alone *deserved
to be put to death.* But the source of their error related to the person
of Christ, because they did not consider what are the titles given by
Scripture to the Messiah, from which they might easily have learned that
he was the *Son of God,* and did not even deign to inquire whether or
not Jesus was the Messiah whom God had formerly promised.

<span id="ix.ii-p6"></span>We see, then, how they drew a false
conclusion from a true principle, for they reason badly. This example
warns us to distinguish carefully between a general doctrine and the
application of it,  <span id="fr_158"></span>[159](#fn_158.md) for there
are many ignorant and unsteady persons who reject the very principles of
Scripture, if they have once been deceived by the semblance of truth;
and such licentiousness makes too great progress in the world every day.
Let us, therefore, remember that we ought to guard against imposition,
so that principles which are true may remain in all their force, and
that the authority of Scripture may not be diminished.

<span id="ix.ii-p8"></span>On the other hand, we may easily find a reply
to wicked men, who falsely and improperly allege the testimony of
Scripture, and the principles which they draw from it, to support their
bad designs; just as the Papists, when they extol in lofty terms the
authority of the Church, bring forward nothing about which all the
children of God are not agreed. They maintain that the Church is the
mother of believers, that she is the pillar of truth, that she ought to
be heard, that she is guided by the Holy Spirit.  <span
id="fr_159"></span>[160](#fn_159.md) All this we ought to admit, but when
they wish to appropriate to themselves all the authority that is due to
the Church, they wickedly, and with sacrilegious presumption, seize what
does not at all belong to them. For we must inquire into the grounds of
what they assume as true, that they deserve the title of The Church; and
here they utterly fail. In like manner, when they exercise furious
cruelty against all the godly, they do so on this pretence, that they
have been ordained to defend the faith and peace of the Church. But when
we examine the matter more closely, we plainly see that there is nothing
which they have less at heart than the defense of true doctrine, that
nothing affects them less than a care about peace and harmony, but that
they only fight to uphold their own tyranny. They who are satisfied with
general principles, and do not attend to the *circumstances,* imagine
that the Papists do right in attacking us; but the investigation of the
matter quickly dissipates that smoke by which they deceive the simple.
 <span id="fr_160"></span>[161](#fn_160.md)

<span id="ix.ii-p12"></span><span id="ix.ii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p13"></span>**8.** *He was the more afraid.* These words
may be explained in two ways. The first is, that Pilate dreaded lest
some blame should be imputed to him, if a tumult arose, because he had
not condemned Christ. The second is, that, after having heard the name
of *the Son of God,* his mind was moved by religion. This second view is
confirmed by what immediately follows:

<span id="ix.ii-p14"></span><span id="ix.ii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p15"></span>**9.** *And he entered again into the hall,
and said to Jesus; Whence Art Thou?* It is evident from this that he was
in a state of perplexity and anguish, because *he was afraid* that he
would be punished for sacrilege, if he laid his hand on *the Son of God*
It ought to be observed that, when he asks *whence Christ is,* he does
not inquire about his country, but the meaning is, as if he had said,
“Art thou a man born on the earth, or art thou some god?” The
interpretation which I give to this passage, therefore, is, that Pilate,
struck with the fear of God, was in perplexity and doubt as to what he
ought to do;  <span id="fr_161"></span>[162](#fn_161.md) for he saw, on the
one hand, the excitement of a mutiny, and, on the other hand, conscience
held him bound not to offend God for the sake of avoiding danger.

<span id="ix.ii-p17"></span>This example is highly worthy of
observation. Though the countenance of Christ was so disfigured, yet, as
soon as Pilate hears the name of God, he is seized with the *fear* of
violating the majesty of God in a man who was utterly mean and
despicable. If reverence for God had so much influence on an irreligious
man, must not they be worse than reprobate, who now judge of divine
things in sport and jest, carelessly, and without any *fear?* for,
indeed, Pilate is a proof that men have naturally a sentiment of
religion, which does not suffer them to rush fearlessly in any direction
they choose, when the question relates to divine things. This is the
reason why I said that those who, in handling the doctrine of Scripture,
are not more impressed with the majesty of God, than if they had been
disputing about the shadow of an ass, *are given up to a reprobate
mind,* (<span id="ix.ii-p17.1"></span>[Ro
1:28](../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#028)<span id="ix.ii-p17.1"></span>..md)
Yet they will one day feel to their destruction, what veneration is due
to the name of God, which they now treat with such disdainful and
outrageous mockery. It is shocking to relate how haughtily the Papists
condemn the plain and ascertained truth of God, and with what cruelty
they shed innocent blood. Whence, I beseech you, comes that drunken
stupidity, but because they do not recollect that they have anything to
do with God?

<span id="ix.ii-p18"></span>*And Jesus gave him no answer.* We ought not
to think it strange that Jesus makes no reply; at least, if we keep in
mind what I have formerly mentioned, that he did not stand before Pilate
to plead his own cause, — as is customary with persons accused who are
desirous to be acquitted, — but rather to suffer condemnation; for it
was proper that he should be condemned, when he appeared in our room.
This is the reason why he makes no defense; and yet Christ’s silence is
not inconsistent with what Paul says,

<span id="ix.ii-p19"></span>Remember that Christ, before Pilate, made a
good confession,  
(<span id="ix.ii-p19.2"></span>[1Ti
6:13](../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#013)<span id="ix.ii-p19.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="ix.ii-p20"></span>for there he maintained the faith of the
Gospel, as far as was necessary, and his death was nothing else than the
sealing of the doctrine delivered by him. Christ left nothing undone of
what was necessary to make a lawful confession, but he kept silence as
to asking an acquittal. Besides, there was some danger that Pilate would
acquit Christ as one of the pretended gods, as Tiberius wished to rank
him among the gods of the Romans. Justly, therefore, does Christ, by his
silence, frown on this foolish superstition.

<span id="ix.ii-p21"></span><span id="ix.ii-p21.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p22"></span>**10.** *Knowest thou not that I have power
to crucify thee?* This shows that the dread with which Pilate had been
suddenly seized was transitory, and had no solid root; for now,
forgetting all fear, he breaks out into haughty and monstrous contempt
of God. He threatens Christ, as if there had not been a Judge in heaven;
but this must always happen with irreligious men, that, shaking off the
fear of God, they quickly return to their natural disposition. Hence
also we infer, that it is not without good reason that *the heart of
man* is called *deceitful,* (<span id="ix.ii-p22.1"></span>[Jer
17:9](../../../bib/kjv/jer017.htm#009)<span id="ix.ii-p22.1"></span>;.md)
for, though some fear of God dwells in it, there likewise comes from it
mere impiety. Whoever, then, is not regenerated by the Spirit of God,
though he pretend for a time to reverence the majesty of God, will
quickly show, by opposite facts, that this fear was hypocritical.

<span id="ix.ii-p23"></span>Again, we see in Pilate an image of a proud
man, who is driven to madness by his ambition; for, when he wishes to
exalt his power, he deprives himself of all praise and reputation for
justice. He acknowledges that Christ is innocent, and therefore he makes
himself no better than a robber, when he boasts that he has power to cut
his throat! Thus, wicked consciences, in which faith and the true
knowledge of God do not reign, must necessarily be agitated, and there
must be within them various feelings of the flesh, which contend with
each other; and in this manner God takes signal vengeance on the pride
of men, when they go beyond their limits, so as to claim for themselves
infinite power. By condemning themselves for injustice, they stamp on
themselves the greatest reproach and disgrace. No blindness, therefore,
is greater than that of pride; and we need not wonder, since pride feels
the hand of God, against which it strikes, to be armed with vengeance.
Let us therefore remember, that we ought not rashly to indulge in
foolish boastings, lest we expose ourselves to ridicule; and especially
that those who occupy a high rank ought to conduct themselves modestly,
and not to be ashamed of being subject to God and to his laws.

<span id="ix.ii-p24"></span><span id="ix.ii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ii-p25"></span>**11.** *Thou wouldest have no power.* Some
explain this in a general sense, that nothing is done in the world but
by the permission of God; as if Christ had said, that Pilate, though he
thinks that he can do all things, will do nothing more than God permits.
The statement is, no doubt, true, that this world is regulated by the
disposal of God, and that, whatever may be the efforts of wicked men,
still they cannot even move a finger but as the secret power of God
directs. But I prefer the opinion of those who confine this passage to
the office of the magistrate; for by these words Christ rebukes the
foolish boasting of Pilate, in extolling himself, as if his power had
not been from God; as if he had said, Thou claimest every thing for
thyself’, as if thou hadst not to render an account one day to God; but
it was not without His providence that thou wast made a judge. Consider,
then, that His heavenly throne is far higher than thy tribunal. It is
impossible to find any admonition better fitted to repress the insolence
of those who rule over others, that they may not abuse their authority.
The father imagines that he may do what he pleases towards his children,
the husband towards his wife, the master towards his servants, the
prince towards his people, unless when they look to God, who hath
determined that their authority shall be limited by a fixed rule.

<span id="ix.ii-p26"></span>*Therefore he who delivered me to thee.*
Some think that this declares the Jews to be more guilty than Pilate,
because, with wicked hatred and malicious treachery, they are enraged
against an innocent man, that is, those of them who were private
individuals, and not clothed with lawful authority. But I think that
this circumstance renders their guilt more heinous and less excusable on
another ground, that they constrain a divinely appointed government to
comply with their lawless desires; for it is a monstrous sacrilege to
pervert a holy ordinance of God for promoting any wickedness. The
robber, who, with his own hand, cuts the throat of a wretched passenger,
is justly held in abhorrence; but he who, under the forms of a judicial
trial, puts to death an innocent man, is much more wicked. Yet Christ
does not aggravate their guilt, for the purpose of extenuating that of
Pilate; for he does not institute a comparison between him and them, but
rather includes them all in the same condemnation, because they equally
pollute a holy power. There is only this difference, that he makes
direct attack on the Jews, but indirectly censures Pilate, who complies
with their wicked desire.

<span id="ix.iii"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p1"></span><span id="ix.iii-p1.1"></span>[John
19:12-16](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#012.md)<span id="ix.iii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p2"></span>**12.** From that time Pilate sought to
release him; but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man,
thou art not Caesar's friend: whoever maketh himself a king speaketh
against Caesar. **13.** When Pilate, therefore, had heard this saying,
he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat, in a place
which is called the Stone-pavement, and in Hebrew, Gabbatha. **14.** And
it was the preparation of the passover, about the sixth hour; and he
saith to the Jews, Behold your King!  <span
id="fr_162"></span>[163](#fn_162.md) **15.** But they cried out, Away with
him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify
your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
**16.** Then, therefore, he delivered him to them to be crucified; and
they took Jesus, and led him away.

<span id="ix.iii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.iii-p5"></span><span id="ix.iii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p6"></span>**12.** *From that time Pilate sought to
release him.* Though *Pilate* does not conduct himself conscientiously,
and is actuated more by ambition than by a regard to justice, and, on
that account, is wretchedly irresolute, yet his modesty is commendable
on this ground, that, when he is severely reproved by Christ, he does
not fly into a passion, but, on the contrary, is still more disposed to
release him. He is a judge, and yet he meekly permits the accused person
to be his reprover; and, indeed, scarcely one person in a hundred will
be found, who so mildly suffers a reproof, even from one who is his
equal.

<span id="ix.iii-p7"></span>*Thou art not Caesar’s friend.* By threats
they prevail on Pilate to condemn Christ; for they could do nothing that
was more hateful, or more fitted to produce terror, than to hold him
suspected of disloyalty to Caesar. “Thou showest,” say they, “that thou
dost not care about Caesar’s authority, if thou acquit him who has
endeavored to throw every thing into confusion.” This wickedness at
length broke down the resolution of Pilate, who, till now, had only been
shaken by their furious clamours. Nor is it without a good reason that
the Evangelist so laboriously examines and details those circumstances;
for it is of great importance to us to know, that Pilate did not condemn
Christ, before he had several times acquitted him with his own mouth, in
order that we may learn from it, that it was for our sins that he was
condemned, and not on his own account. We may also learn from it, how
voluntarily he offered himself to die, when he disdained to avail
himself of the favorable disposition of the judge towards him; and,
indeed, it was this obedience that caused his death to be *a sacrifice
of sweet savour,* (<span id="ix.iii-p7.1"></span>[Eph
5:2](../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#002)<span id="ix.iii-p7.1"></span>,.md)
for blotting out all sins.

<span id="ix.iii-p8"></span><span id="ix.iii-p8.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p9"></span>**13.** *And sat down on the judgment-seat.*
Hence we see what conflicting opinions passed through the mind of
Pilate, as if he had been a stage-player who was acting two characters.
He ascends *the judgment-seat,* in order to pronounce sentence of death
on Christ solemnly, and in the customary form;  <span
id="fr_163"></span>[164](#fn_163.md) and yet he declares openly, that he
does so reluctantly and against his conscience. When he calls Christ
*king,* he speaks ironically, meaning that it was a trivial charge which
the Jews brought against him; or rather, for the purpose of allaying
their fury, he warns them, that it would bring disgrace on the whole
nation, if a report were spread abroad, that a person of that nation had
been condemned to die for aspiring to kingly power.

<span id="ix.iii-p11"></span>*In the place which is called the
Stone-pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.* When the Evangelist says,
that <span id="ix.iii-p11.1"></span>גבתא (*Gabbatha*) was the name of
the place *in* Hebrew he means the Chaldaic or Syriac language, which
was then in common use; for in *Hebrew,* <span id="ix.iii-p11.2"></span>
גבה(*Gabach*) means *to be lofty.* It was proper, therefore, that Christ
should be condemned from *a lofty place,* that he, coming from heaven as
the supreme Judge, may acquit us at the last day.

<span id="ix.iii-p12"></span><span id="ix.iii-p12.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p13"></span>**14.** *About the sixth hour.* The
Evangelists appear to differ, and even to contradict each other, in the
computation of time. The other three Evangelists say that *the darkness*
came on *about the sixth hour,* while Christ was hanging on the cross,
(<span id="ix.iii-p13.1"></span>[Mt
27:45](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#045.md)<span id="ix.iii-p13.1"></span>;
<span id="ix.iii-p13.2"></span>[Mr
15:33](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#033.md)<span id="ix.iii-p13.2"></span>;
<span id="ix.iii-p13.3"></span>[Lu
23:44](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#044)<span id="ix.iii-p13.3"></span>..md)
Mark, too says expressly that it was *the third hour* when the sentence
was pronounced on him, (<span id="ix.iii-p13.4"></span>[Mr
15:25](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#025)<span id="ix.iii-p13.4"></span>..md)
But this may be easily explained. It is plain enough from other passages
that the day was at that time divided into four parts, as the night also
contained four watches; in consequence of which, the Evangelists
sometimes allot not more than four hours to each day, and extend each
hour to three, and, at the same time, reckon the space of an hour, which
was drawing to a close, as belonging to the next part. According to this
calculation, *John* relates that Christ was condemned *about the sixth
hour,* because the time of the day was drawing towards *the sixth hour,*
or towards the second part of the day. Hence we infer that Christ was
crucified at or about *the sixth hour;* for, as the Evangelist
afterwards mentions, (<span id="ix.iii-p13.5"></span>[Joh
19:20](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#020)<span id="ix.iii-p13.5"></span>,.md)
*the place was near to the city. The darkness* began between the sixth
and ninth hour, and lasted till the ninth hour, at which time Christ
died.

<span id="ix.iii-p14"></span><span id="ix.iii-p14.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p15"></span>**15.** *We have no king but Caesar.* This
is a display of shocking madness, that the priests, who ought to have
been well acquainted with the Law, reject Christ, in whom the salvation
of the people was wholly contained, on whom all the promises depended,
and on whom the whole of their religion was founded; and, indeed, by
rejecting Christ, they deprive themselves of the grace of God and of
every blessing. We see, then, what insanity had seized them. Let us
suppose that Jesus Christ was not the Christ;  <span
id="fr_164"></span>[165](#fn_164.md) still they have no excuse for
acknowledging *no other king but Caesar.* For, first, they revolt from
the spiritual kingdom of God; and, secondly, they prefer the tyranny of
the Roman Empire, which they greatly abhorred, to a just government,
such as God had promised to them. *Thus* wicked men, in order to fly
from Christ, not only deprive themselves of eternal life, but draw down
on their heads every kind of miseries. On the other hand, the sole
happiness of the godly is, to be subject to the royal authority of
Christ, whether, according to the flesh, they are placed under a just
and lawful government, under the oppression of tyrants.

<span id="ix.iii-p17"></span><span id="ix.iii-p17.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iii-p18"></span>**16.** *Then, therefore, he delivered him
to them to be crucified.* Pilate was, no doubt constrained by their
importunity to *deliver* Christ; and yet this was not done in a
tumultuous manner, but he was solemnly condemned in the ordinary form,
because there were also two robbers who, after having been tried, were
at the same time condemned to be crucified. But John employs this
expression, in order to make it more fully evident that Christ, though
he had not been convicted of any crime, was given up to the insatiable
cruelty of the people.

<span id="ix.iv"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p1"></span><span id="ix.iv-p1.1"></span>[John
19:17-22](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#017.md)<span id="ix.iv-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p2"></span>**17.** And he, bearing his cross, went forth
to a place which is called (the place) of a Skull, and: in Hebrew,
Golgotha;  <span id="fr_165"></span>[166](#fn_165.md) **18.** Where they
crucified him, and two others with him, on either side one, and Jesus in
the midst. **19.** And Pilate wrote also a title, and put it on the
cross; and it was written, Jesus of Nazareth, The King Of The Jews
·**20.** This title then many of the Jews read, because the place where
Jesus was crucified was near to the city; and it was written in Hebrew,
and Greek, and Latin· **21.** The chief priests of the Jews, therefore,
said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am
King, of the Jews. **22.** Pilate answered, What I have written I have
written.

<span id="ix.iv-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.iv-p5"></span><span id="ix.iv-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p6"></span>**17.** *He went forth to a place.* The
circumstances which are here related contribute greatly, not only to
show the truth of the narrative, but likewise to build up our faith. We
must look for righteousness through the satisfaction made by Christ. To
prove that he is the sacrifice for our sins, he wished both to be led
out of the city, and to be hanged on a tree; for the custom was, in
compliance with the injunction of the Law, that the sacrifices, the
blood of which was shed for sin, were carried out of the camp, (<span
id="ix.iv-p6.1"></span>[Lev. 6:30](../../../bib/kjv/lev006.htm#030.md),
[Lev. 16:27](../../../bib/kjv/lev016.htm#027.md)<span
id="ix.iv-p6.1"></span>;) and the same Law declares that

<span id="ix.iv-p7"></span>he who hangeth on a tree is accursed,  
(<span id="ix.iv-p7.2"></span>[De
21:23](../../../bib/kjv/deu021.htm#023)<span id="ix.iv-p7.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.iv-p8"></span>Both were fulfilled in Christ, that we might
be fully convinced that atonement has been made for our sins by the
sacrifice of his death; that

<span id="ix.iv-p9"></span>he was made subject to the curse, in order
that he might redeem us from the curse of the law,  
(<span id="ix.iv-p9.2"></span>[Ga
3:13](../../../bib/kjv/gal003.htm#013)<span id="ix.iv-p9.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="ix.iv-p10"></span>that

<span id="ix.iv-p11"></span>he was made sin, in order that we might be
the righteousness of God in him,  
(<span id="ix.iv-p11.2"></span>[2Co
5:21](../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#021)<span id="ix.iv-p11.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="ix.iv-p12"></span>that he was led out of the city, in order
that he might carry with him, and take away, our defilements which were
laid on him, (<span id="ix.iv-p12.1"></span>[Heb
12:12](../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#012)<span id="ix.iv-p12.1"></span>..md)
To the same purpose is the statement about the robbers, which
immediately follows: —

<span id="ix.iv-p13"></span><span id="ix.iv-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p14"></span>**18.** *And two others with him, on either
side one, and Jesus in the midst.* As if the severity of the punishment
had not been sufficient of itself, he is hanged *in the midst* between
two robbers, as if he not only had deserved to be classed with other
robbers, but had been the most wicked and the most detestable of them
all. We ought always to remember, that the wicked executioners of Christ
did nothing but what had been determined by the hand and purpose of God;
 <span id="fr_166"></span>[167](#fn_166.md) for God did not surrender his
Son to their lawless passions, but determined that, according to his own
will and good pleasure, he should be offered as a sacrifice. And if
there were the best reasons for the purpose of God in all those things
which he determined that his Son should suffer, we ought to consider, on
the one hand, the dreadful weight of his wrath against sin, and, on the
other hand, his infinite goodness towards us. In no other way could our
guilt be removed than by the Son of God becoming a curse for us. We see
him driven out into an accursed place, as if he had been polluted by a
mass of all sorts of crimes, that there he might appear to be accursed
before God and men. Assuredly we are prodigiously stupid, if we do not
plainly see in this mirror with what abhorrence God regards sin; and we
are harder than stones, if we do not tremble at such a judgment as this.

<span id="ix.iv-p16"></span>When, on the other hand, God declares that
our salvation was so dear to him, that he did not spare his
only-begotten Son, what abundant goodness and what astonishing grace do
we here behold! Whoever, then, takes a just view of the causes of the
death of Christ, together with the advantage which it yields to us, will
not, like *the Greeks,* regard the doctrlne of *the cross as
foolishness,* nor, like the Jews, will he regard it as *an offense,*
(<span id="ix.iv-p16.1"></span>[1Co
1:23](../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#023)<span id="ix.iv-p16.1"></span>,.md)
but rather as an invaluable token and pledge of the power, and wisdom,
and righteousness, and goodness of God.

<span id="ix.iv-p17"></span>When John says, that the name of the place
was *Golgotha,* he means that, in the Chaldaic or Syriac language, it
was called <span id="ix.iv-p17.1"></span>גלגלתא, (*Gulgaltha.*) The name
is derived from <span id="ix.iv-p17.2"></span>גלגל, (*Gilgel,*  <span
id="fr_167"></span>[168](#fn_167) .md) which signifies, *to roll;* because
*a skull* is round like a ball or globe.  <span
id="fr_168"></span>[169](#fn_168.md)

<span id="ix.iv-p20"></span><span id="ix.iv-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p21"></span>**19.** *And Pilate wrote also a title.* The
Evangelist relates a memorable action of Pilate, after having pronounced
the sentence. It is perhaps true that it was customary to affix
*titles,* when malefactors were executed, that the cause of the
punishment might be known to all, and might serve the purpose of an
example. But in Christ there is this extraordinary circumstance, that
the *title* which is affixed to him implies no disgrace; for Pilate’s
intention was, to avenge himself indirectly on the Jews, (who, by their
obstinacy, had extorted from him an unjust sentence of death on an
innocent man,) and, in the person of Christ, to throw blame on the whole
nation. Thus he does not brand Christ with the commission of any crime.

<span id="ix.iv-p22"></span>But the providence of God, which guided the
pen of Pilate, had a higher object in view. It did not, indeed, occur to
Pilate to celebrate Christ as the Author of salvation, and the Nazarene
of *God,* and the King of a chosen people; but God dictated to him this
commendation of the Gospel, though he knew not the meaning of what he
wrote. It. was the same secret guidance of the Spirit that caused *the
title* to be published in three languages; for it is not probable that
this was an ordinary practice, but the Lord showed, by this preparatory
arrangement, that the time was now at hand, when the name of his Son
should be made known throughout the whole earth.

<span id="ix.iv-p23"></span><span id="ix.iv-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p24"></span>**21.** *The chief priests of the Jews said
therefore to Pilate.* They feel that they are sharply rebuked; and,
therefore, they would wish that *the title* were changed, so as not to
involve the nation in disgrace, but to throw the whole blame on Christ.
But yet they do not conceal their deep hatred of the truth, since the
smallest spark of it is more than they are able to endure. Thus Satan
always prompts his servants to endeavor to extinguish, or, at least, to
choke, by their own darkness, the light of God, as soon as the feeblest
ray of it appears.

<span id="ix.iv-p25"></span><span id="ix.iv-p25.1"></span>

<span id="ix.iv-p26"></span>**22.** *What I have written I have
written.* Pilate’s firmness must be ascribed to the providence of God;
for there can be no doubt that they attempted, in various ways, to
change his resolution. Let us know, therefore, that he was held by a
Divine hand, so that he remained unmoved. Pilate did not yield to the
prayers of the priests, and did not allow himself to be corrupted by
them; but God testified, by his mouth, the firmness and stability of the
kingdom of his Son. And if, in the writing of Pilate, the kingdom of
Christ was shown to be so firm that it could not be shaken by all the
attacks of its enemies, what value ought we to attach to the testimonies
of the Prophets, whose tongues and hands God consecrated to his service?

<span id="ix.iv-p27"></span>The example of *Pilate* reminds us, also,
that it is our duty to remain steady in defending the truth. A heathen
refuses to retract what he has justly and properly written concerning
Christ, though he did not understand or consider what he was doing. How
great, then, will be our dishonor, if, terrified by threatenigs or
dangers, we withdraw from the profession of his doctrine, which God hath
sealed on our hearts by his Spirit! Besides, it ought to be observed how
detestable is the tyranny of the Papists, which prohibits the reading of
the Gospel, and of the whole of the Scripture, by the common people.
Pilate, though he was a reprobate man, and, in other respects, an
instrument of Satan, was nevertheless, by a secret guidance, appointed
to be a herald of the Gospel, that he might publish a short summary of
it in three languages. What rank, therefore, shall we assign to those
who do all that they can to suppress the knowledge of it, since they
show that they are worse than Pilate?

<span id="ix.v"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p1"></span><span id="ix.v-p1.1"></span>[John
19:23-24](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#023.md)<span id="ix.v-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p2"></span>**23.** Then the soldiers, when they had
crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to each soldier
a part. They took also his coat.  <span
id="fr_169"></span>[170](#fn_169.md) But the coat was without seam, woven
from the top throughout. **24.** They said therefore among themselves,
Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the
Scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They divided my garments
among them, and cast lots on my vesture: these things therefore the
soldiers did.

<span id="ix.v-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.v-p5"></span><span id="ix.v-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.v-p6"></span>**23.** *Then the soldiers.* The other
Evangelists also mention the *parting* of Christ’s *garments among the
soldiers,* (<span id="ix.v-p6.1"></span>[Mt
27:35](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#035.md)<span id="ix.v-p6.1"></span>;
<span id="ix.v-p6.2"></span>[Mr
15:24](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#024.md)<span id="ix.v-p6.2"></span>;
<span id="ix.v-p6.3"></span>[Lu
23:34](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#034)<span id="ix.v-p6.3"></span>..md)
There *were four* soldiers who *parted* among themselves all his
*garments,* except *the coat,* which, being *without seam* could not be
divided, and therefore *they cast lots* on it. To fix our minds on the
contemplation of the purpose of God, the Evangelists remind us that, in
this occurrence also, there was a fulfillment of Scripture. It may be
thought, however, that the passage, which they quote from <span
id="ix.v-p6.4"></span>[Ps 22:19](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#019.md)<span
id="ix.v-p6.4"></span>, is inappropriately applied to the subject in
hand; for, though David complains in it that he was exposed as a prey to
his enemies, he makes use of the word *garments* to denote
metaphorically all his property; as if he had said, in a single word,
that “he had been stripped naked and bare by wicked men;” and, when the
Evangelists disregard the figure, they depart from the natural meaning
of the passage. But we ought to remember, in the first place, that the
psalm ought not to be restricted to David, as is evident from many parts
of it, and especially from a clause in which it is written, *I will
proclaim thy name among the Gentiles,* (<span id="ix.v-p6.5"></span>[Ps
22:22](../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#022)<span id="ix.v-p6.5"></span>.md)
which must be explained as referring to Christ. We need not wonder,
therefore, if that which was faintly shadowed out in David is beheld in
Christ with all that superior clearness which the truth ought to have,
as compared with the figurative representation of it.

<span id="ix.v-p7"></span>Let us also learn that. Christ was stripped of
his *garments,* that he might clothe us with righteousness; that his
naked body was exposed to the insults of men, that we may appear in
glory before the judgment-seat of God. As to the allegorical meaning to
which some men have tortured this passage, by making it mean, that
heretics tear Scripture in pieces, it is too far-fetched; though I would
not object to such a comparison as this, —that, as the *garments* of
Christ were once divided by ungodly *soldiers,* so, in the present day,
there are perverse men who, by foreign inventions, tear the whole of the
Scripture, with which Christ is clothed, in order that he may be
manifested to us. But the wickedness of the Papists, accompanied by
shocking blasphemy against God, is intolerable. They tell us, that
Scripture is torn to pieces by heretics, but that *the coat* — *that*
is, the Church — remains entire; and thus they endeavor to prove that,
without paying any attention to the authority of Scripture, the unity of
faith consists in the mere title of the Church; as if the unity of the
Church were itself founded on any thing else than the authority of
Scripture. When, therefore, they separate faith from Scripture, so that
it may continue to be attached to the Church alone, by such a divorce
they not only strip Christ of his *garments,* but tear in pieces his
body by shocking sacrilege. And though we should admit what they
maintain, that *the coat without seam* is a figure of the Church, they
will be very far from gaining their point: for it will still remain to
be proved, that the Church is placed under their authority, of which
they show no sign whatever.

<span id="ix.vi"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p1"></span><span id="ix.vi-p1.1"></span>[John
19:25-27](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#025.md)<span id="ix.vi-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p2"></span>**25.** Now there stood by the cross of Jesus
his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary
Magdalene. **26.** Jesus, therefore, seeing his mother, and the disciple
whom he loved standing by her, saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy
son! **27.** Then he saith to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from
that hour, the disciple took her to his own home.

<span id="ix.vi-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.vi-p4"></span><span id="ix.vi-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p5"></span>**25.** *Now there stood by the cross of
Jesus.* The Evangelist here mentions incidentally, that while Christ
obeyed God the Father, he did not fail to perform the duty which he
owed, as a son, towards *his mother.* True, he forgot himself, and he
forgot every thing, so far as was necessary for the discharge of
obedience to his Father, but, after having performed that duty, he did
not neglect what he owed to *his mother.* Hence we learn in what manner
we ought to discharge our duty towards God and towards men. It often
happens that, when God calls us to the performance of any thing, our
parents, or wife, or children, draw us in a contrary direction, so that
we cannot give equal satisfaction to all. If we place men in the same
rank with God, we judge amiss. We must, therefore, give the preference
to the command, the worship, and the service of God; after which, as far
as we are able, we must give to men what is their due.

<span id="ix.vi-p6"></span>And yet the commands of the first and second
table of the Law never jar with each other, though at first sight they
appear to do so; but we must begin with the worship of God, and
afterwards assign to men an inferior place. Such is the import of the
following statements:

<span id="ix.vi-p7"></span>He who loveth father or mother more than me,
is not worthy of me,  
(<span id="ix.vi-p7.2"></span>[Mt
10:41](../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#041)<span id="ix.vi-p7.2"></span>;.md)

<span id="ix.vi-p8"></span>and,

<span id="ix.vi-p9"></span>If any one hate not his father, and mother,
and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, he cannot be my
disciple,  
(<span id="ix.vi-p9.2"></span>[Lu
14:26](../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026)<span id="ix.vi-p9.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.vi-p10"></span>We ought, therefore, to devote ourselves to
the interests of men, so as not in any degree to interfere with the
worship and obedience which we owe to God. When we have obeyed God, it
will then be the proper time to think about parents, and wife, and
children; as Christ attends to *his mother,* but it is after that he is
on the cross, to which he has been called by his Father’s decree.

<span id="ix.vi-p11"></span>Yet, if we attend to the time and place when
these things happened, Christ’s affection for *his mother* was worthy of
admiration. I say nothing about the severe tortures of his body; I say
nothing about the reproaches which he suffered; but, though horrible
blasphemies against God filled his mind with inconceivable grief, and
though he sustained a dreadful contest with eternal death and with the
devil, still, none of these things prevent him from being anxious about
*his mother.* We may also learn from this passage, what is the honor
which God, by the Law, commands us to render to parents, (<span
id="ix.vi-p11.1"></span>[Ex 20:12](../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#012.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p11.1"></span>.) Christ appoints *the disciple* to be his
substitute, and charges him to support and take care of *his mother;*
and hence it follows, that the honor which is due to parents consists,
not in cold ceremony,  <span id="fr_170"></span>[171](#fn_170.md) but in
the discharge of all necessary duties.

<span id="ix.vi-p13"></span>On the other hand, we ought to consider the
faith of those holy women  <span id="fr_171"></span>[172](#fn_171.md) It is
true that, in following Christ to the cross, they displayed more than
ordinary affection; but, if they had not been supported by faith they
could never have been present at this exhibition. As to John himself, we
infer that, though his faith was choked for a short time, it was not
wholly extinguished. How shameful will it be, if the dread of the cross
deters us from following Christ, when the glory of his resurrection is
placed before our eyes, whereas the women beheld in it nothing but
disgrace and cursing!

<span id="ix.vi-p15"></span>*Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.* He
calls her either the wife or the daughter *of Cleophas;* but I prefer
the latter interpretation.  <span id="fr_172"></span>[173](#fn_172.md) He
says, that she was *the sister of the mother of Jesus,* and, in saying
so, he adopts the phraseology of the Hebrew language, which includes
cousins, and other relatives,  <span id="fr_173"></span>[174](#fn_173.md)
under the term *brothers.* We see that it was not in vain that *Mary
Magdalene* was delivered from *seven devils,* (<span
id="ix.vi-p17.2"></span>[Mr 16:9](../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#009.md)<span
id="ix.vi-p17.2"></span>; <span id="ix.vi-p17.3"></span>[Lu
8:2](../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#002)<span id="ix.vi-p17.3"></span>;.md)
since she showed hersclf, to the last, to be so faithful a disciple to
Christ.

<span id="ix.vi-p18"></span><span id="ix.vi-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p19"></span>**26.** *Woman, behold thy son!*  <span
id="fr_174"></span>[175](#fn_174.md) As if he had said, “Henceforth I shall
not be an inhabitant of the earth, so as to have it in my power to
discharge to thee the duties of a *son;* and, therefore, I put this man
in my room, that he may perform my office.” The same thing is meant,
when he says to John,

<span id="ix.vi-p21"></span>*Behold thy mother!* For by these words he
charges him to treat her as a *mother,* and to take as much care of her
as if she had been his own *mother.*

<span id="ix.vi-p22"></span>In refraining from mentioning his *mother’s*
name and in simply calling her *Woman!* some think that he did so, in
order not to pierce her heart with a deeper wound. I do not object to
this view; but there is another conjecture which is equally probable,
that Christ intended to show that, after having completed the course of
human life, he lays down the condition in which he had lived, and enters
into the heavenly kingdom, where he will exercise dominion over angels
and men; for we know that Christ was always accustomed to guard
believers against looking at the flesh, and it was especially necessary
that this should be done at his death.

<span id="ix.vi-p23"></span><span id="ix.vi-p23.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vi-p24"></span>**27.** *The disciple took her to his own
home.* It is a token of the reverence due by a *disciple* to his master,
that John so readily obeys the command of Christ. Hence also it is
evident, that the Apostles had their families; for John could not have
exercised hospitality towards the mother of Christ, or have *taken her
to his own home,* if he had not had a house and a regular way of living.
Those men, therefore, are fools, who think that the Apostles
relinquished their property, and came to Christ naked and empty; but
they are worse than fools, who make perfection to consist in beggary.

<span id="ix.vii"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p1"></span><span id="ix.vii-p1.1"></span>[John
19:28-30](../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#028.md)<span id="ix.vii-p1.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p2"></span>**28.** After this, Jesus, knowing that all
things were now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
saith, I thirst. **29.** And a vessel full of vinegar was placed there;
and, filling a sponge with vinegar, they fixed it on hyssop, and put it
to his mouth. **30.** When, therefore, Jesus had received the vinegar,
he said, It is finished; and, bowing his head, he yielded up his breath.

<span id="ix.vii-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.vii-p4"></span><span id="ix.vii-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p5"></span>**28.** *Jesus, knowing that all things were
now accomplished.* John purposely passes by many things which are
related by the other three Evangelists. He now describes the last act,
which was an event of the greatest importance.When John says that *a
vessel was placed there,* he speaks of it as a thing that was customary.
There has been much controversy on this subject; but I agree with those
who think (and, indeed, the custom is proved by histories) that it was a
kind of beverage usually administered for the purpose of accelerating
the death of wretched malefactors, when they had undergone sufficient
torture  <span id="fr_175"></span>[176](#fn_175.md) Now, it ought to be
remarked, that Christ does not ask any thing to *drink* till *all things
have been accomplished;* and thus he testified his infinite love towards
us, and the inconceivable earnestness of his desire to promote our
salvation. No words can fully express the bitterness of the sorrows
which he endured; and yet he does not desire to be freed from them, till
the justice of God has been satisfied, and till he has made a perfect
atonement.  <span id="fr_176"></span>[177](#fn_176.md)

<span id="ix.vii-p8"></span>But how does he say, that all things were
accomplished, while the most important part still remained to be
performed, that is, his death? Besides, does not his resurrection
contribute to the *accomplishment* of our salvation? I answer, John
includes those things which were immediately to follow. Christ had not
yet died: and had not yet risen again; but he saw that nothing now
remained to hinder him from going forward to death and resurrection. In
this manner he instructs us, by his own example, to render perfect
obedience, that we may not think it hard to live according to his good
pleasure, even though we must languish in the midst of the most
excruciating pains.

<span id="ix.vii-p9"></span>*That the Scripture might be fulfilled.*
From what is stated by the other Evangelists, (<span
id="ix.vii-p9.1"></span>[Mt 27:48](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#048.md)<span
id="ix.vii-p9.1"></span>; <span id="ix.vii-p9.2"></span>[Mark
15:23](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#023.md),
[36](../../../bib/kjv/mar015.htm#036.md)<span id="ix.vii-p9.2"></span>;
<span id="ix.vii-p9.3"></span>[Lu
23:36](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#036)<span id="ix.vii-p9.3"></span>,.md)
it may readily be concluded that the passage referred to is <span
id="ix.vii-p9.4"></span>[Ps 69:21](../../../bib/kjv/psa069.htm#021.md)<span
id="ix.vii-p9.4"></span>,

<span id="ix.vii-p10"></span>They gave me gall for my food, and in my
thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.

<span id="ix.vii-p11"></span>It is, undoubtedly, a metaphorical
expression, and David means by it, not only that they refused to him the
assistance which he needed, but that they cruelly aggravated his
distresses. But there is no inconsistency in saying that what had been
dimly shadowed out in David was more clearly exhibited in Christ: for
thus we are enabled more fully to perceive the difference between truth
and figures, when those things which David suffered, only in a
figurative manner, are distinctly and perfectly manifested in Christ. To
show that he was the person whom David represented, Christ chose to
drink *vinegar;* and he did so for the purpose of strengthening our
faith.

<span id="ix.vii-p12"></span>*I thirst.* Those who contrive a
metaphorical meaning for the word *thirst,* as if he meant that, instead
of a pleasant and agreeable beverage, they gave him bitterness, as if
they intended to flay his throat,  <span
id="fr_177"></span>[178](#fn_177.md) are more desirous to be thought
ingenious than to promote true edification; and, indeed, they are
expressly refuted by the Evangelist, who says that Christ asked for
vinegar when he was near death; from which it is evident that he did not
desire any luxuries.  <span id="fr_178"></span>[179](#fn_178.md)

<span id="ix.vii-p15"></span><span id="ix.vii-p15.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p16"></span>**29.** *And, having filled a sponge with
vinegar, they fixed it on hyssop.* When he says that they *fixed the
sponge on hyssop,* the meaning is, that they fastened it to the end of a
bunch of *hyssop,* that it might be raised to Christ’s mouth; for, in
that country, *hyssops* grow as large as small shrubs,  <span
id="fr_179"></span>[180](#fn_179.md)

<span id="ix.vii-p18"></span><span id="ix.vii-p18.1"></span>

<span id="ix.vii-p19"></span>**30.** *It is finished.* He repeats the
same word which he had lately employed,  <span
id="fr_180"></span>[181](#fn_180.md) Now this word, which Christ employs,
well deserves our attention; for it shows that the whole accomplishment
of our salvation, and all the parts of it, are contained in his death.
We have already stated that his resurrection is not separated from his
death, but Christ only intends to keep our faith fixed on himself alone,
and not to allow it to turn aside in any direction whatever. The
meaning, therefore, is, that every thing which contributes to the
salvation of men is to be found in Christ, and ought not to be sought
anywhere else; or — which amounts to the same thing — that the
perfection of salvation is contained in him.

<span id="ix.vii-p21"></span>There is also an implied contrast; for
Christ contrasts his death with the ancient sacrifices and with all the
figures; as if he had said,” Of all that was practiced under the *Law,*
there was nothing that had any power in itself to make atonement for
sins, to appease the wrath of God, and to obtain justification; but now
the true salvation is exhibited and manifested to the world.” On this
doctrine depends the abolition of all the ceremonies of the Law; for it
would be absurd to follow shadows, since we have the body in Christ.

<span id="ix.vii-p22"></span>If we give our assent to this word which
Christ pronounced, we ought to be satisfied with his death alone for
salvation, and we are not at liberty to apply for assistance in any
other quarter; for he who was sent by the Heavenly Father to obtain for
us a full acquittal, and to accomplish our redemption, knew well what
belonged to his office, and did not fail in what he knew to be demanded
of him. It was chiefly for the purpose of giving peace and tranquillity
to our consciences that he pronounced this word, *It is finished.* Let
us stop here, therefore, if we do not choose to be deprived of the
salvation which he has procured for us.  <span
id="fr_181"></span>[182](#fn_181.md)

<span id="ix.vii-p24"></span>But the whole religion of Popery tends to
lead men to contrive for themselves innumerable methods of seeking
salvation; and hence we infer, that it is full to overflowing with
abominable sacrileges. More especially, this word of Christ condemns the
abomination of the Mass. All the sacrifices of the Law must have ceased,
for the salvation of men has been completed by the one sacrifice of the
death of Christ. What right, then, have the Papists, or what plausible
excuse can they assign for saying, that they are authorised to prepare a
new sacrifice, to reconcile God to men? They reply that it is not a new
sacrifice, but the very sacrifice which Christ offered. But this is
easily refuted; for, in the first place, they have no command to offer
it; and, secondly, Christ, having once accomplished, by a single
oblation, all that was necessary to be done, declares, from the cross,
that all *is finished.* They are worse than forgers, therefore, for they
wickedly corrupt and falsify the testament sealed by the precious blood
of the Son of God.

<span id="ix.vii-p25"></span>*He yielded up his breath.* All the
Evangelists take great care to mention the death of Christ, and most
properly; for we obtain from it our confident hope of life, and we
likewise obtain from it a fearless triumph over death, because the Son
of God has endured it in our room, and, in his contest with it, has been
victorious. But we must attend to the phraseology which John employs,
and which teaches us, that all believers, who die with Christ,
peacefully commit their souls to the guardianship of God, who is
faithful, and will not suffer to perish what he hath undertaken to
preserve. The children of God, as well as the reprobate, die; but there
is this difference between them, that the reprobate give up the soul,
without knowing where it goes, or what becomes of it;  <span
id="fr_182"></span>[183](#fn_182.md) while the children of God commit it,
as a precious trust, to the protection of God, who will faithfully guard
it till the day of the resurrection. The word *breath* is manifestly
used here to denote the immortal soul.

<span id="ix.viii-p2"></span>**31.** The Jews, therefore, that the
bodies might not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath-day, (for it was
the preparation, and it was the great day of that Sabbath,) besought
Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken
away. **32.** Then the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first,
and of the other who was crucified with him. **33.** But when they came
to Jesus, and saw that he was already dead, they broke not his legs;
**34.** But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and
immediately there came out of it blood and water. **35.** And he who saw
it hath borne testimony of it, and his testimony is true, and he knoweth
that he saith true, that you may believe. **36.** And these things were
done  <span id="fr_183"></span>[184](#fn_183.md) that the Scripture might
be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. **37.** And again,
another Scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.

<span id="ix.viii-p4"></span> 

<span id="ix.viii-p5"></span><span id="ix.viii-p5.1"></span>

<span id="ix.viii-p6"></span>**31.** *For it was the preparation.* This
narrative also tends to the edification of our faith; first, because it
shows that what had been foretold in the Scriptures is fulfilled in the
person of Christ; and, secondly, because it contains a mystery of no
ordinary value. The Evangelist says, that *the Jews besought* that the
bodies *might be taken down* from the crosses. This had undoubtedly been
enjoined by the Law of God; but the Jews, as is usually the case with
hypocrites, direct their whole attention to small matters, and yet pass
by the greatest crimes without any hesitation; for, in order to a strict
observance of their Sabbath, they are careful to avoid outward
pollution; and yet they do not consider how shocking a crime it is to
take away the life of an innocent man. Thus we saw a little before, that

<span id="ix.viii-p7"></span>they did not enter into the governor’s
hall, that they might not be defiled,  
(<span id="ix.viii-p7.2"></span>[Joh
18:28](../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#028)<span id="ix.viii-p7.2"></span>,.md)

<span id="ix.viii-p8"></span>while the whole country was polluted by
their wickedness. Yet, by their agency, the Lord carries into effect
what was of the greatest importance for our salvation, that, by a
wonderful arrangement, the body of Christ remains uninjured, and *blood
and water low out of his side.*

<span id="ix.viii-p9"></span>*And it was the great day of that Sabbath*
 <span id="fr_184"></span>[185](#fn_184.md) Another reading more generally
approved is, *and that Sabbath-day was great*; but the reading which I
have adopted is supported by many manuscripts that are ancient and of
great authority. Let the reader choose for himself. If we read <span
id="ix.viii-p10.4"></span>ἐκείνου in the genitive case, (<span
id="ix.viii-p10.5"></span>ἐκείνου τοῦ σαββάτου of that Sabbath) the word
Sabbath must be understood to denote the week; as if the Evangelist had
said, that the festival of that week was very solemn, on account of the
Passover. Note, the Evangelist speaks of the following day, which began
at sunset. But, if we choose rather to read <span
id="ix.viii-p10.6"></span>ἐκείνη, in the nominative case, <span
id="ix.viii-p10.7"></span>ἦν γὰρ μεγάλη ἡ ἡμέρα ἐκείνη τοῦ σαββάτου, and
*That was the great day of the Sabbath*, the meaning will be nearly the
same in substance; only there would be this difference in the words,
that the Passover, which was to take place on the following day, would
render that Sabbath more solemn.

<span id="ix.viii-p11"></span><span id="ix.viii-p11.1"></span>

<span id="ix.viii-p12"></span>**33.** *But when they came to Jesus, and
saw that he was already dead.* That they break the legs of the two
robbers, and after having done so, find that Christ is already dead, and
therefore do not touch his body, appears to be a very extraordinary work
of the providence of God. Ungodly men will, no doubt, say that it
happens naturally that one man dies sooner than another; but, if we
examine carefully the whole course of the narrative, we shall be
constrained to ascribe it to the secret purpose of God, that the death
of Christ was brought on much more rapidly than men could have at all
expected, and that this prevented his legs from being broken.

<span id="ix.viii-p13"></span><span id="ix.viii-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.viii-p14"></span>**34.** *But one of the soldiers pierced
his side with a spear.* When *the soldier pierced Christ’s side with his
spear,* he did so for the purpose of ascertaining if he was dead; but
God had a higher object in view, as we shall immediately see. It was a
childish contrivance of the Papists, when, out of the Greek word <span
id="ix.viii-p14.1"></span>λόγχε, which means a spear,  <span
id="fr_185"></span>[186](#fn_185.md) they manufactured the proper name of a
man, and called this soldier Longinus, and, to give an air of
plausibility to their story, foolishly alleged that he had been formerly
blind, and that, after having received his sight, he was converted to
the faith. Thus they have placed him in the catalogue of the saints.
 <span id="fr_186"></span>[187](#fn_186.md) Since their prayers, whenever
they call on God, rest on such intercessors, what, I ask, will they ever
be able to obtain? But they who despise Christ, and seek the
intercessions of the dead, deserve that the devil should drive them to
ghosts and phantoms.

<span id="ix.viii-p18"></span>*And immediately there came out blood and
water.* Some men have deceived themselves by imagining that this was a
miracle; for it is natural that the blood, when it is congealed, should
lose its red color, and come to resemble water. It is well known also
that water is contained in the membrane which immediately adjoins the
intestines. What has led them astray is, that the Evangelist takes so
much pains to explain that blood flowed along with the water, as if he
were relating something unusual and contrary to the order of nature. But
he had quite a different intention; namely, to accommodate his narrative
to the passages of Scripture which he immediately subjoins, and more
especially that believers might infer from it what he states elsewhere,
that Christ came with water and blood, (<span
id="ix.viii-p18.1"></span>[1Jo
5:6](../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#006)<span id="ix.viii-p18.1"></span>..md)
By these words he means that Christ brought the true atonement and the
true washing; for, on the one hand, forgiveness of sins and
justification, and, on the other hand, the sanctification of the soul,
were prefigured in the Law by those two symbols, sacrifices and
washings. In sacrifices, blood atoned for sins, and was the ransom for
appeasing the wrath of God. Washings were the tokens of true holiness,
and the remedies for taking away uncleanness and removing the pollutions
of the flesh.

<span id="ix.viii-p19"></span>That faith may no longer rest on these
elements, John declares that the fulfillment of both of these graces is
in Christ; and here he presents to us a visible token of the same fact.
The sacraments which Christ has left to his Church have the same design;
for the purification and sanctification of the soul, which consists in
newness of life, (<span id="ix.viii-p19.1"></span>[Ro
6:4](../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#004)<span id="ix.viii-p19.1"></span>,.md)
is pointed out to us in Baptism, and the Lord’s Supper is the pledge of
a perfect atonement. But they differ widely from the ancient figures of
the Law; for they exhibit Christ as being present, whereas the figures
of the Law pointed out that he was still at a distance. For this reason
I do not object to what Augustine says, that our sacraments have flowed
from Christ’s side; for, when Baptism and the Lord’s Supper lead us to
Christ’s side, that by faith we may draw from it, as from a fbuntain,
what they represent, then are we truly washed from our pollutions, and
renewed to a holy life, and then do we truly live before God, redeemed
from death, and delivered from condemnation.

<span id="ix.viii-p20"></span><span id="ix.viii-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ix.viii-p21"></span>**36.** *A bone of him shall not be

where Moses treats of the paschal lamb. Note, Moses takes for granted
that that lamb was a figure of the true and only sacrifice, by which the
Church was to be redeemed. Nor is this inconsistent with the fact, that
it was sacrificed as the memorial of a redemption which had been already
made; for, while God intended that it should celebrate the former favor,
he also intended that it should exhibit the spiritual deliverance of the
Church, which was still future. On that account Paul, without any
hesitation, applies to Christ the rule which Moses lays down about
eating the lamb:

<span id="ix.viii-p22"></span>for even Christ, our Passover, is sacred
for us. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither
with, the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread
of sincerity and truth,  
(<span id="ix.viii-p22.2"></span>[1 Cor.
5:7](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007.md),
[8](../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#008)<span id="ix.viii-p22.2"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.viii-p23"></span>From this analogy, or resemblance, faith
derives no ordinary advantage, for, in all the ceremonies of the Law, it
beholds the salvation which has been manifested in Christ. Such is also
the design of the Evangelist John, when he says that Christ was not only
the pledge of our redemption, but also the price of it, because in him
we see accomplished what was formerly exhibited to the ancient people
under the figure of the passover. Thus also the Jews are reminded that
they ought to seek in Christ the substance of all those things which the
Law prefigured, but did not actually accomplish.

<span id="ix.viii-p24"></span><span id="ix.viii-p24.1"></span>

<span id="ix.viii-p25"></span>**37.** *They shall look on him whom they
pierced.* This passage is violently tortured by those who endeavor to
explain it literally as referring to Christ. Nor is this the purpose for
which the Evangelist quotes ib but rather to show that Christ is that
God who formerly complained, by Zechariah, that the Jews had *pierced*
his heart, (<span id="ix.viii-p25.1"></span>[Zec
12:10](../../../bib/kjv/zac012.htm#010)<span id="ix.viii-p25.1"></span>.md)
Now, God speaks there after the manner of men, declaring that He is
wounded by the sins of his people, and especially by their obstinate
contempt of his word, in the same manner as a mortal man receives a
deadly wound, when his heart is *pierced;* as he says, elsewhere, that
*his Spirit was deeply grieved,*  <span
id="fr_187"></span>[188](#fn_187.md) Now, as Christ is *God manifested in
the flesh* (<span id="ix.viii-p26.3"></span>[1Ti
3:16](../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#016)<span id="ix.viii-p26.3"></span>,.md)
John says that in his visible flesh was plainly accomplished what his
Divine Majesty had endured from the Jews, so far as it was capable of
enduring; not that God can be at all affected by the outrages of men, or
that the reproaches which are cast at him from the earth ever reach him,
but because by this mode of expression he intended to declare with what
enormous sacrilege the wickedness of men is chargeable, when it rises in
rebellion against heaven. What was done by the hand of a Roman soldier
the \]Evangelist John justly imputes to the Jews; as they are elsewhere
said *to have crucified the Son of God,* (<span
id="ix.viii-p26.4"></span>[Ac
2:36](../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#036)<span id="ix.viii-p26.4"></span>,.md)
though they did not lay a finger on his body.

<span id="ix.viii-p27"></span>A question now arises as to this passage
taken from the prophet,  <span id="fr_188"></span>[189](#fn_188.md) Does
God promise to the Jews repentance to salvation, or, does he threaten
that he will come as an avenger? For my own part, when I closely examine
the passage, I think that it includes both; namely, that out of a
worthless and unprincipled nation God will gather a remnant for
salvation, and that, by his dreadful vengeance, he will show to
despisers who it is with whom they have to do; for we know that they
were wont to treat the prophets as insolently as if the prophets had
told nothing but fables, and had received no commission from God. God
declares that they will not pass unpunished, for he will at length
maintain his cause.

<span id="ix.ix"></span>

<span id="ix.ix-p2"></span>**38.** After these things, Joseph of
Arimathen (who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, through fear of
the Jews) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and
Pilate gave him leave. He came, then, and took the body of Jesus.
**39.** And Nicodemus, also, (who at first came to Jesus by night,) came
bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight.
**40.** Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes
with spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury. **41.** And in the
place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden there
was a new sepulcher, in which no person had yet been laid. **42.** There
they laid Jesus, therefore, on account of the preparation of the Jews;
for the sepulcher was near at hand.

<span id="ix.ix-p3"></span> 

<span id="ix.ix-p4"></span><span id="ix.ix-p4.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ix-p5"></span>**38.** *Joseph of Arimathea besought
Pilate.* John now relates by whom, and in what place, and with what
magnificence, Christ was buried. He mentions two persons who buried
Christ; namely, *Joseph* and *Nicodemus,* the former of whom requested
Pilate to give him the dead body, which otherwise would have been
exposed to the lawless violence of the soldiers. Matthew (<span
id="ix.ix-p5.1"></span>[Mt 27:57](../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#057.md)<span
id="ix.ix-p5.1"></span>) says, that he was *a rich man,* and Luke (<span
id="ix.ix-p5.2"></span>[Lu 23:50](../../../bib/kjv/luk023.htm#050.md)<span
id="ix.ix-p5.2"></span>) says, that he was *a counsellor;* that is, he
held the rank of a senator. As to *Nicodemus,* we have seen, in the
Third Chapter of this Gospel, that he held an honorable rank among his
own countrymen; and that he was also *rich,* may be easily inferred from
the great expense which he laid out in procuring this *mixture.*

<span id="ix.ix-p6"></span>Till now, therefore, *riches* had prevented
them from professing to be the disciples of Christ, and might afterwards
have no less influence in keeping them from making a profession so much
hated and abhorred. The Evangelist expressly says, that *Joseph* has
formerly been kept back by this *fear* from venturing to declare openly
that he was *a disciple* of Christ; and as to *Nicodemus,* he repeats
what we have already seen, that he came to Jesus secretly, and *by
night,* (<span id="ix.ix-p6.1"></span>[Joh
3:2](../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#002.md)<span id="ix.ix-p6.1"></span> and
<span id="ix.ix-p6.2"></span>[Joh
7:50](../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#050)<span id="ix.ix-p6.2"></span>..md)
Whence, therefore, do they derive such heroic magnanimity that, when
affairs are at the lowest ebb, they fearlessly come forth to public
view? I say nothing of the great and evident danger which they must have
incurred; but the most important point is, that they did not scruple to
place themselves in a state of perpetual warfare with their own nation.
It is therefore certain that this was effected by a heavenly impulse, so
that they who, *through, fear,* did not render the honor due to him
while he was alive, now run to his dead body, as if they had become new
men.

<span id="ix.ix-p7"></span>They bring their spices to embalm the body of
Christ; but they would never have done so, if they had been perfumed
with the sweet sayour of his death. This shows the truth of what Christ
had said,

<span id="ix.ix-p8"></span>Unless a grain of corn die, it remaineth
alone;  
but when it is dead, it bringeth forth much fruit,  
(<span id="ix.ix-p8.3"></span>[Joh
12:24](../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024)<span id="ix.ix-p8.3"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.ix-p9"></span>For here we have a striking proof that his
death was more quickening than his life; and so great was the efficacy
of that sweet sayour which the death of Christ conveyed to the minds of
those two men, that it quickly extinguished all the passions belonging
to the flesh. So long as ambition and the love of money reigned in thenb
the grace of Christ had no charms for them; but now they begin to
disrelish the whole world.

<span id="ix.ix-p10"></span>Besides, let us learn that their example
points out to us what we owe to Christ. Those two men, as a testimony of
their faith, not only took down Christ from the cross with great hazard,
but boldly carried him to the grave. Our slothfulness will be base and
shameful if, now that he reigns in the heavenly glory, we withhold from
him the confession of our faith. So much the less excusable is the
wickedness of those who, though they now deny Christ by base hypocrisy,
plead in his behalf the example of Nicodemus. In one thing, I admit,
they resemble him, that they endeavor, as far as lies in their power, to
bury Christ; but the time for burying is past, since he hath ascended to
the right hand of the Father, that he may reign gloriously over angels
and men, and that every tongue may proclaim his dominion, (<span
id="ix.ix-p10.1"></span>[Phil. 2:9](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#009.md),
[10](../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010)<span id="ix.ix-p10.1"></span>..md)

<span id="ix.ix-p11"></span>*Secretly, through fear of the Jews.* As
this fear is contrasted with the holy boldness which the Spirit of the
Lord wrought in the heart of *Joseph,* there is reason to believe that
it was not free from blame. Not that all fear, by which believers guard
against tyrants and enemies of the Church, is faulty, but because the
weakness of faith is manifested, whenever the confession of faith is
withheld *through fear.* We ought always to consider what the Lord
commands, and how far he bids us advance. He who stops in the middle of
the course shows that he does not trust in God, and he who sets a higher
value on his own life than on the command of God is without excuse.

<span id="ix.ix-p12"></span>*Who was a disciple of Jesus.* When we
perceive that the Evangelist bestows on *Joseph* the honorable
designation of *a disciple,* at a time when he was excessively timid,
and did not venture to profess his faith before the world, we learn from
it how graciously God acts towards his people, and with what fatherly
kindness he forgives their offenses. And yet the false *Nicodemites*
have no right to flatter themselves, who not only keep their faith
concealed within their own breast, but, by pretending to give their
consent to wicked superstitions, do all that is in their power to deny
that they are *disciples* of Christ.

<span id="ix.ix-p13"></span><span id="ix.ix-p13.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ix-p14"></span>**40.** *As the custom of the Jews is to
bury.* When Christ had endured extreme ignominy on the cross, God
determined that his burial should be honourable, that it might serve as
a preparation for the glory of his resurrection. The money expended on
it by *Nicodemus* and *Joseph* is very great, and may be thought by some
to be superfluous; but we ought to consider the design of God, who even
led them, by his Spirit, to render this honor to his own Son, that, by
the sweet savor of his grave he might take away our dread of the cross.
But those things which are cut of the ordinary course ought not to be
regarded as an example.

<span id="ix.ix-p15"></span>Besides, the Evangelist expressly states
that he was buried according to *the custom of the Jews.* By these words
he informs us that this was one of the ceremonies of the Law; for the
ancient people, who did not receive so clear a statement of the
resurrection, and who had not such a demonstration and pledge of it as
we have in Christ, needed such aids to support them, that they might
firmly believe and expect the coming of the Mediator  <span
id="fr_189"></span>[190](#fn_189.md) We ought, therefore, to attend to the
distinction between us, who have been enlightened by the brightness of
the Gospel, and the rather, to whom the figures supplied the absence of
Christ. This is the reason why allowance could then be made for a
greater pomp of ceremonies, which, at the present *day,* would not be
free from blame; for those who now bury the dead at so great an expense
do not, strictly speaking, bury dead men, but rather, as far as lies in
their power, draw down from heaven Christ himself, the King of life, and
lay him in the tomb, for his glorious resurrection  <span
id="fr_190"></span>[191](#fn_190.md) abolished those ancient ceremonies.

<span id="ix.ix-p18"></span>Among the heathen, too, there was great
anxiety and ceremony in burying the dead, which unquestionably derived
its origin from the ancient Fathers of the Jews,  <span
id="fr_191"></span>[192](#fn_191.md) in the same manner as sacrifices; but,
as no hope of the resurrection existed along them, they were not
imitators of the Fathers, but apes of them; for the promise and word of
God is, as it were, the soul, which gives life to ceremonies. Take away
the word, and all the ceremonies which men observe, though outwardly
they may resemble the worship of godly persons, is nothing else than
foolish or mad superstition. For our part, as we have said, we ought now
to maintain sobriety and moderation in this matter, for immoderate
expense quenches the sweet savour of Christ’s resurrection.

<span id="ix.ix-p20"></span><span id="ix.ix-p20.1"></span>

<span id="ix.ix-p21"></span>**41.** *Now, in the place where he was
crucified there was a garden.* This is the *third* point, as I have
said, which ought to be observed in the history of the burial. It is
related by the Evangelist for various reasons. In the first place, it
did not happen by accident, but by an undoubted providence of God, that
the body of Christ was buried *in a new sepulchre;* for although he died
as all other men die, still, as he was to be *the first-born from the
dead,* (<span id="ix.ix-p21.1"></span>[Col
1:18](../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018)<span id="ix.ix-p21.1"></span>,.md)
and *the first-fruits of them that rise,* (<span
id="ix.ix-p21.2"></span>[1Co
15:20](../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020)<span id="ix.ix-p21.2"></span>.md)
he had a *new sepulcher, in which no person had ever been laid* True,
*Nicodemus* and *Joseph* had a different object in view; for, in
consequence of the short time that now remained till sunset, which was
the commencement of the Sabbath, they looked to the convenience of the
place, but, contrary to their intention God provided for his own Son *a
sepulchre* which had not yet been used. The good men are merely
gratified by *the place being near at hand,* that they might not violate
the Sabbath; but God offers them what they did not seek, that the burial
of his Son might have some token to distinguish him from the rank of
other men. The local situation served also to prove the truth of his
resurrection, and to throw no small light on the narrative which is
contained in the following chapter.

<span id="ix.ii-p9"></span> These statements regarding “The *Church*”
our Author considers to be what logicians call the major proposition of
the syllogism; and by the Latin word *“*<span
id="ix.ii-p9.1"></span>*hypothesis“* rendered in French *“*<span
id="ix.ii-p9.2"></span>*l’application,”* he evidently means the minor
proposition, which he declares not only to be unsupported by proof, but
to be utterly false. His own early training and habits, as a lawyer,
naturally led him to throw the argument into this form, especially when
it related to a criminal prosecution; for even in our own times
indictments invariably take the form of a syllogism. He appears to have
conceived the accusation against Christ to run thus: “Any mere man,
declaring himself to be *the Son of God,* is guilty of blasphemy, and
deserves to die. But Jesus of Nazareth, who is a mere man, *hath made
himself to be the Son of God.* Therefore, *according to our law,* Jesus
*ought to die.”* The major proposition cannot, be questioned, being
manifestly taken from the law of Moses. The minor proposmon consists of
two parts. 1. Jesus is a mere man. 2. Jesus *hath made himself to be the
Son of God.* The second part is true, but the first is false; and,
consequently, the whole argument, plausible as it had seemed, falls to
the ground. It ought to have been known and acknowledged by the *Jews,*
that the honorable rank of *the Son of God,* though it could not without
blasphemy be claimed by a mere child of Adam, belonged of right to Jesus
of Nazareth, of whom, even before his birth, the angel said to the
Virgin Mary,

<span id="ix.viii-p16"></span> Dr Bloomfield subjoins the following note
to this verse: — “The epitaph of this soldier, (if genuine,) said to be
found in the Church of St Mary, at Lyons, is as follows: — <span
id="ix.viii-p16.1"></span>*Qui Salvatoris latus Cruce Cuspfdefixit,*
Lo,’Ginus *Mc jacet* —*’ Here lies* Longinu’s, *who pierced the Savior’s
side on the Cross with a spear.’”* As the learned annotator has thus
summarily adverted to this legendary tale, it is right that the reader
should be briefly put in possession of the whole of it, as it has been
collected by Moreri from Tillemont and other ecclesiastical writers, in
his “Directory” under the head, *St Longin* — (*St* Longinns.) This *St
Longinus* is twofold: “some saying, that he was *the soldier* that
pierced our Lord’s side with a spear; and some, that he was *the
centurion* who commanded the guard at the cross. The legends report both
these persons to have been converted to the Christian faith, to have
suffered martyrdom, and to have been canonized.” Moreri, however, though
an ecclesiastic of the Romish Church, was constrained to add, *The acts
of both Longinuses are manifestly false; and the circumstances they
allege mutually refute each other.”*

<span id="ix.viii-p17"></span>It would appear that the name *Longinus*
has been formed from the Greek <span id="ix.viii-p17.1"></span>λόγχη*,
spear: Longinus* being the Latin form of <span
id="ix.viii-p17.2"></span>λόγχιμνος*,* — *spear-man.* Thus, *St
Longinus* is found to be a similar saint to the *Sancta Veronica,*
reported by Brydone. “The Greeks,” continues Moreri, celebrate the
martyrdom of Longinus, *the centurion,* on the 16th of October, the
Latins on the 15th of March, and the Copts on the 1st of November. The
martyrdom of Longinus, *the soldier,* is *not* acknowledged by the
Greeks; but the Latins commemorate it on different days; some on the
15th of March, some on the 1st of September, others on the 22nd of
November; or 11th of December.” We thus see how little this offspring of
credulity and superstition merits the attention of the readers of the
*Gospel.* — *Granville Penn’s Annotations.*
